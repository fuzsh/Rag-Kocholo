        "text": "Saluting the legends of Beale Street\n\nThe Beale Street Brass Notes offer a tangible tribute to the many talented people who had put Memphis music and Beale Street on the world map.\n\nRecipients in alphabetic order by last name or group name.\n\nEmerson Able (1931-2015)\n\nNote ceremony 11/14/12. Former band director at Manassas High School and outstanding sax player with a great group, Able spans Memphis music history from Jimmie Lunceford to Isaac Hayes and beyond.\n\nLamar Alexander (1940- )\n\nThe former governor and current senator of Tennessee, Lamar Alexander, is also a classically trained pianist. This benefited Alexander during campaign fundraisers across the state early in his career. A supporter of Memphis music, Alexander has twice performed at the Memphis in May Sunset Symphony.\n\nLyman Aldrich\n\nNote ceremony 5/2/2013. Lyman Aldrich is a founder of the Memphis In May International Festival, which has produced the Beale Street Music Festival for 36 years. He is also the founder of Memphis Music, Inc., which brought all of the music studios in Memphis together to promote Memphis music worldwide.\n\nArdent Studios (founded 1958)\n\nWhen high school buddies John Fry, John King, and Fred Smith decided to gather up a band and rent a studio in 1958, they were met with a disappointing outcome. Dissatisfied with the studio, Fry converted his parent's garage into his music space. The threesome built their own equipment and eventually picked out a name that would encompass the passion and the spirit they had for their studio: Ardent. While recording the first Big Star album in 1971, Ardent moved to Madison Avenue, where they are still located today. The studio established a name for itself with early classics by Sam & Dave, Led Zeppelin, Isaac Hayes, Leon Russell, and The Staples Singers, then scored hits in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s with such artists as James Taylor, ZZ Top, R.E.M., George Thorogood, The Allman Brothers, Bob Dylan, and Jimmie and Stevie Ray Vaughan. The legacy continues in the new millennium with hits recorded by The White Stripes, 3 Doors Down, Cat Power, North Mississippi Allstars, The Raconteurs, and award-winning music for such films as Hustle and Flow and Black Snake Moan. To date, Ardent has amassed over 70 gold and platinum albums and singles.\n\nLil' Hardin Armstrong (1898-1971)\n\nLillian \"Lil\" Hardin Armstrong was a jazz pianist, composer, arranger, singer, and bandleader. She was the second wife of Louis Armstrong, with whom she collaborated on many recordings in the 1920s. Her compositions include \"Struttin' with Some Barbecue,\" \"Don't Jive Me,\" \"Two Deuces,\" \"Knee Drops,\" \"Doin' the Suzie-Q,\" \"Just for a Thrill\" (which was a hit when revived by Ray Charles in 1959), \"Clip Joint,\" and \"Bad Boy\" (a hit for Ringo Starr in 1978). Armstrong was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2014. She was born Lillian Hardin in Memphis, Tennessee, where she grew up in a household with her grandmother, Priscilla Martin, a formerly enslaved person from near Oxford, Mississippi. Hardin first received piano instruction from her third-grade teacher, Violet White. Her mother then enrolled her in Mrs. Hook's School of Music. At Fisk University, a college for African Americans in Nashville, she was taught a more acceptable approach to the instrument. She received a diploma from Fisk, returning to Memphis in 1917. In August 1918, she moved to Chicago with her mother and stepfather. By then, she had become proficient in reading music, a skill that helped her get a job as a sheet music demonstrator at Jones Music Store.\n\nEarl 'The Pearl\" Banks (1936- )\n\nNote ceremony 8/3/2013. Veteran bluesman Earl \"The Pearl\" has played with various notables, including O.V. Wright, Albert King, Koko Taylor, and many more. He has played for over 50 years on Beale Street and truly connects the district to its musical heritage.\n\nThe Bar-Kays (formed 1964)\n\nThe Bar-Kays, which consisted of guitarist Jimmy King, trumpeter Ben Cauley, organist Ronnie Caldwell, saxophonist Phalon Jones, bassist James Alexander, and drummer Carl Cunningham, were formed in Memphis in 1968. The Bar-Kays caught the attention of Stax Records, which signed them in 1967. After serving as a backup band, the Bar-Kays released their own hit called \"Soul Finger.\" Shortly after that, all the band members except James Alexander and Ben Cauley were tragically killed in the same plane crash that took the life of recording artist Otis Redding. Alexander reformed the Bar-Kays, which backed Isaac Hayes' hit \"Hot Buttered Soul.\" The new group consisted of Alexander on bass, Willie Hall on drums, Winston Stewart on organ, Barry Wilkins and Vernon Burch on guitar, Harvey Henderson on the saxophone, and vocalist Larry Dodson. This group had some success and remained intact until 1988. A third ensemble was assembled in 1990 by Alexander and Dodson. Alexander's son is the award-winning rapper and record producer Phalon \"Jazze Pha\" Alexander, named after Phalon Jones.\n\nBeale Street Flippers (formed 1988)\n\nThe Beale Street Flippers began with Rarecas Bonds. In 1988, Bonds made his way to Beale Street, where the excitement of Memphis in May sent him into a tumbling frenzy. After Bonds started receiving tip money for his flipping, he visited Beale Street daily. Scoring popularity and a cameo appearance in \"The Firm,\" Bonds began encountering competition. Instead of battling his competition, Bonds asked the guys to join him. Over the years, they have performed at many national events, including NBA games and on TV's America's Got Talent.\n\nRobert “Wolfman” Belfour (1940-2015)\n\nHe was an American blues musician - born in Red Banks, Mississippi. His father taught him the guitar at a young age, and he continued his tutelage in the blues from musicians Otha Turner, R. L. Burnside, and Junior Kimbrough. Kimbrough, in particular, had a profound influence on him. His music is deeply rooted in Mississippi Hill Country traditions, in contrast to those of delta blues. His playing is characterized by a profoundly percussive attack and alternate tunings. His father died when Belfour was thirteen, and his music was relegated to what free time he had, as his energy went to help his mother provide for the family. In 1959, he married Noreen Norman and moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he would work in construction for the next 35 years. In the 1980s, Belfour began playing on Beale Street. In 1994, he had eight songs featured on David Evans's compilation album, The Spirit Lives On, Deep South Country Blues, and Spirituals in the 1990s, released by the German Hot Fox label. This led him to Fat Possum Records, and his first album, \"What's Wrong With You,\" released in 2000.\n\nWilliam Bell (1939- )\n\nNote ceremony 8/5/10. Born in Memphis, Bell began recording with Stax in 1961. A composer of dozens of songs, Bellco wrote \"Born Under a Bad Sign\" with Albert King and had a hit himself with \"I Forgot to be Your Lover,\" which has been sampled by several artists since. In 1997, he received the Rhythm and Blues Foundation's R&B Pioneer Award.\n\nBig Star (founded 1971)\n\nNote ceremony 11/13/10. The pop power group produced three critically acclaimed albums and included Alex Chilton, Jody Stephens, Andy Hummel, and Chris Bell. An American garage band response to the British invasion, the complex harmonies, and thoughtful lyrics made the band a cult classic.\n\nBill Black (1926-1965)\n\nNote ceremony 7/5/2014. Born in Memphis, Bill Black honed his skills playing cigar box guitar as a teen. After a stint in the Army during WWII, Black returned to Memphis and began performing as a bass fiddle player. He connected with Scotty Moore, and they played with several musicians around town. Sam Phillips asked them to back Elvis Presley for a recording session, resulting in \"That's Alright Mama.\" Black toured with Elvis for a few years before leaving to find the Bill Black Combo. He opened a recording studio. The Combo was asked to tour with the Beatles in 1964, although Black was too ill to participate, and he passed away in 1965.\n\nJ. Blackfoot (born John Colbert; 1946-2011)\n\nJ. Blackfoot was an American soul singer. A member of The Soul Children in the late 1960s and 1970s, he subsequently had a moderately successful solo career. His biggest hit was \"Taxi,\" which reached the US and UK charts in 1984. John Colbert was born in Greenville, Mississippi, and moved with his family as a child to Memphis, Tennessee. Generally known as \"J.\" or \"Jay,\" he acquired the nickname \"Blackfoot\" as a child for his habit of walking barefoot on the tarred sidewalks. In 1965, while spending some time at Tennessee State Penitentiary in Nashville for car theft, he met Johnny Bragg, the founder of The Prisonaires vocal group. After leaving prison, Colbert recorded a single under his own name for the small Sur-Speed label before returning to Memphis. There, David Porter of Stax Records heard him singing in a street-corner group. After the plane crash that claimed the lives of Otis Redding and four members of The Bar-Kays, Colbert joined the reconstituted group as lead singer. He performed with them for several months but did not record. In 1968, after Sam & Dave had moved from Stax to Atlantic Records, Porter and his songwriting and production partner Isaac Hayes decided to put together a new vocal group of two men and two women. They recruited Blackfoot, together with Norman West, Anita Louis, and Shelbra Bennett, to form The Soul Children. Between 1968 and 1978, The Soul Children had 15 hits on the R&B chart, including three that crossed over to the Billboard Hot 100, and recorded seven albums. The Soul Children disbanded in 1979. Blackfoot worked with bands in the Memphis area and recorded solo for the local Prime Cut label. In 1983, he began working again with writer and producer Homer Banks, with whom he had recorded with The Soul Children. He recorded \"Taxi,\" a song originally written for Johnnie Taylor but not recorded by him. Blackfoot's record rose to no. 4 on the R&B chart and no. 90 on the pop chart, also reaching no. 48 in the UK. Colbert recorded several albums and had several more R&B hits on Banks' Sound Town label before moving to the Edge label formed by Al Bell in 1986. In 1987, he had another significant hit, \"Tear Jerker,\" a duet with Ann Hines, reaching no. 28 on the R&B chart. He later moved to the Basix label, continuing to release albums into the new millennium. In 2007, Blackfoot and West reformed the Soul Children with Hines and fourth member Cassandra Graham. In 2010, Blackfoot appeared as part of David Porter's music revue.\n\nThe Blackwood Brothers (formed 1934)\n\nThe Blackwood Brothers are an American southern gospel quartet. Pioneers of the Christian music industry, they are 8-time Grammy Award winners in addition to winning 7 Gospel Music Association Dove Awards. They are also members of the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Southern Gospel Museum, and Hall of Fame. The Blackwood Brothers Quartet was formed in 1934 amid the Great Depression when preacher Roy Blackwood (1900–71) moved his family back home to Choctaw County, Mississippi. His brothers, Doyle Blackwood (1911–74) and 15-year-old James Blackwood (1919–2002), already had some experience singing with Vardaman Ray and Gene Catledge. After adding Roy's 13-year-old son, R.W. Blackwood (1921–54), to sing baritone, the brothers began to travel and sing locally. By 1940, they were affiliated with the Stamps-Baxter Music Company to sell songbooks. They were appearing on the 50,000-watt radio station KMA (AM) in Shenandoah, Iowa. Doyle left in 1942 and was replaced by Don Smith. After Doyle left, The Quartet relocated to Memphis, Tennessee in 1950. The move proved to be successful for the group as they began to appear on television station WMCT in the coming years. In 1952, they signed a major recording contract with RCA Victor. After the move to Memphis, Roy left and was replaced by Calvin Newton, who was replaced with Cat Freeman. After Freeman left, Alden Toney was hired to sing tenor. In 1951, Alden Toney and Don Smith left and were replaced by Dan Huskey and Bill Lyles. In 1952, Dan Huskey left and was replaced by Bill Shaw. On June 14, 1954, the Blackwood Brothers lineup of Bill Shaw (tenor), James Blackwood (lead), R.W. Blackwood (baritone), Bill Lyles (bass), and Jackie Marshall (piano) won the Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts competition on national television with their rendition of \"Have You Talked To The Man Upstairs?\" The win propelled them into the national spotlight beyond just the Southern United States.\n\nBobby \"Blue\" Bland (1930-2013)\n\nRobert Calvin Bland was born in 1930 in Rosemark, Tennessee. When he and his mother later moved to Memphis, Bland took his love for singing to Beale Street, where he met B.B. King and Johnny Ace and formed the Beale Streeters. When Bland came home from the Army in 1955, he saw that his former bandmates were becoming successful, so Bland quickly jumped back into the music scene and began recording with saxophonist Bill Harvey's band. His \"It's My Life, Baby\" recording was his first hit. It has been followed by the release of a steady string of classic blues standards supporting his long and successful career in the music industry. He received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997.\n\nBarbara Blue (1937- )\n\nNote ceremony 5/8/2015.

The original members of the group were Booker T. Jones (organ, piano), Steve Cropper(guitar), Lewie Steinberg (bass), and Al Jackson Jr. (drums). In the 1960s, as members of the house band of Stax Records, they played on hundreds of recordings by artists such as Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Bill Withers, Sam & Dave, Carla Thomas, Rufus Thomas, Johnnie Taylor, and Albert King. They also released instrumental records under their own name, best known as the 1962 hit single \"Green Onions.\" As originators of the unique Stax sound, the group was one of its era's most prolific, respected, and imitated. By the mid-1960s, bands on both sides of the Atlantic were trying to sound like Booker T. & the M.G.'s. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2008, and the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\nDennis Brooks (1950-2009)\n\nNote ceremony 2/3/11.

Not only was much of the music from Memphis, but the band they assembled for the subsequent 1980 film had direct Memphis roots, featuring Stax greats Steve Cropper on guitar and Donald \"Duck\" Dunn on bass. The movie, two albums, and a sequel renewed interest in Memphis music.\n\nRev. W. Herbert Brewster (1897-1987)\n\nWilliam Herbert Brewster was born in Somerville, Tennessee, on July 2, 1897.

He composed the song \"Walk Right In\" in 1913. It was revived and made a hit for a group called the Rooftop Singers in 1963, which brought him some fame but hardly any money.

Racism was very heavy in the South, and Mr.Hulbert had to overcome a mountain of obstacles to get to the point where he was known for his volunteerism, philanthropy, and charitable work within the community. Maurice Hulbert Sr. made a strong impact in the history of Memphis, especially on Beale Street and within Black Memphis. Mr. Hulbert was considered an elegant & elite dancer who opened the first black dancing studio in Memphis. He also owned successful restaurants and nightclubs, including the Flamingo, the Manhattan, and the Harlem House. One of his best-known musical contributions was his music group combo and band known as Hulbert's Lo-Down Houns, where he was the bandleader and a musician. Coming from humble beginnings, his travels and business entertainment connections allowed him the opportunity to invite and book talents such as Ethel Waters, Duke Ellington, and black baseball teams. His charitable contributions allowed him the opportunity to support and fund community projects such as the Robert R. Elks Lodge No. 1477. In 1951, at the 14th Annual Blues Bowl game, he was crowned king. W.C. Handy also attended the 14th Annual Blues Bowl.

George Hunt has made a significant mark on not just African-American art but American art as a whole. Memphis artist George Hunt was born in rural Louisiana, near Lake Charles, and his grandmother noted early in life that he had a special power to \"see things.\" In addition to large doses of indigenous music, one of the things he saw was the civil rights movement and that experience became a painting in 1997, which in turn, became a US Postage Stamp issued in 2005 as part of the United States Postal Service series, \"To Form A More Perfect Nation.\" George Hunt was honored for his painting, \"America Cares/Little Rock Nine\" at ceremonies in Little Rock and Memphis. The painting was originally commissioned for the Central High School Museum but first spent five years hanging in the White House in Washington, D.C. First Lady Hillary Clinton, in a personal note to Mr. Hunt, wrote, \"We are grateful that our visitors and staff have such a powerful image of hope and freedom to greet, inspire and inform them.\"Alberta Hunter (1895-1984)\n\nAlberta Hunter was born in 1895 in Memphis but left for Chicago as a teenager, where she peeled potatoes and worked hard to get her foot in the door with local club owners. Hunter got her first break in 1917 when she landed a five-year association with the Dreamland ballroom. Her career skyrocketed in the 1920s as she made regular appearances in clubs and on stage in musicals in New York, Paris, and London. She wrote several songs, including the critically acclaimed \"Downhearted Blues.\" In 1928, Hunter played Queenie in the first London production of Show Boat. After her mother's death in 1954, Hunter sought a career change, which led her to the medical profession. Hunter was working at a New York hospital in 1961 when a record producer approached her about taking a break from nursing to record again.

She later added the mandolin, banjo, and harmonica to her repertoire. Of all the instruments she played, Cordell was most noted for the electric guitar. After marrying William Jackson in 1943, she settled in Memphis, where she set up equipment in her living room and began to record demos and send them to Sam Phillips, founder of Sun Records. Unable to break into the Sun Records label's stable of male artists, Jackson created Moon Records in 1956 to record her own single, \"Beboppers Christmas,\" which led her to release additional rockabilly singles by other small bands and is widely thought to be the first woman to produce, engineer, arrange and promote music on her own rock and roll music label. Though she never stopped recording until her death, her career had waned somewhat until it was rejuvenated in the 1980s when Alex Chilton and Tav Falco recorded some of her Moon Records songs.

From this came the legend that he sold his soul to the Devil at the legendary \"crossroads\" (the intersection of Mississippi Highways 61 and 49) in exchange for his great talent. He made just two sets of recordings in Texas in 1936 and 1937 before dying in 1938 at age 27 near Greenwood, Mississippi.

He played on many notable and adventurous records with Max Roach, John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy, and MJT +3, in addition to recordings with his fellow Memphians. He also headlined an influential quartet at the Five Spot in New York. He died in 1963 at the age of 23; his influence and the amount of recordings he made at that time are stunning.

Lloyd joined Chico Hamilton in 1960, though the band was known for playing \"chamber jazz\" at the beginning of Lloyd's tenure. His influence as a composer and a player quickly pushed it in a more progressive post-bop direction, especially after Hamilton asked him to be the group's \"music director.\" Lloyd's key musical partner in the band was Hungarian guitarist Gabor Szabo. In 1964, Lloyd left Hamilton's group to join alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderly. During this period, he recorded two albums as a leader for Columbia Records; his sidemen were other young musicians, including Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams. Through 1965- 1969, Lloyd led a quartet with pianist Keith Jarrett, bassist Cecil McBee (later Ron McClure), and drummer Jack DeJohnette.

He was an unsung hero of the 1960s hardbop scene, performing and recording with many of its finest artists, and only in recent years has he begun to garner appreciation for his long-running legacy in jazz and the understated power of his talent. Like fellow Memphis jazz artists George Coleman, Booker Little, and Frank Strozier, Mabern attended Manassas High School, and after an early attempt at playing the drums, he taught himself piano and fell under the spell of pianist Phineas Newborn Jr., an influence that would shape and linger with Mabern for the rest of his life.\n\nBobby Manuel (1945- )\n\nBobby Manuel is one of the longest-working musicians in the Memphis scene.
