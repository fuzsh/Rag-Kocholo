        "text": "Bob Einstein, best known for his recurring role on Curb Your Enthusiasm and for creating the stuntman character Super Dave Osborne, died Wednesday after a battle with cancer, our sister site Deadline reports. He was 76.\n\nEinstein began his Hollywood career as a writer for several variety series, including The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour and the short-lived Van Dyke and Company. His behind-the-scenes work earned him two Emmy Awards (in 1969 and 1977), as well as four more Emmy nominations.\n\nIn front of the camera, Einstein became known for his satirical character Super Dave Osborne, an optimistic but hapless stuntman whose daredevil adventures would always go awry. Einstein first debuted the character in 1972, then went on to appear as Super Dave Osborne on various variety and talk shows for the next several decades. Super Dave also headlined several of his own specials, including Super Dave’s All Stars and Super Dave’s Spike-tacular.\n\nEinstein later recurred as Marty Funkhouser, one of Larry David’s closest friends, on Curb Your Enthusiasm. He appeared in 22 total episodes of the HBO comedy, including five installments of Season 9 in 2017. According to an HBO representative, Einstein was originally scheduled to be part of Curb‘s upcoming 10th season, but his health had prevented him from filming.\n\nUPDATE: In a statement on Wednesday, David said, “Never have I seen an actor enjoy a role the way Bob did playing Marty Funkhouser on Curb. It was an amazing, unforgettable experience knowing and working with him. There was no one like him, as he told us again and again. We’re all in a state of shock.”\n\nEinstein’s TV credits also included episodes of Arrested Development, Comedy Bang! Bang! and Anger Management."
