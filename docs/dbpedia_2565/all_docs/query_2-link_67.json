He was the son of actress/singer Thelma Leeds and comedian Harry Einstein. Bob was the older brother of actor/comedian/writer/director Albert Brooks and younger brother of Clifford Einstein, a founding partner of L.A.'s Dailey Advertising. He also had a half-brother, Charles Einstein (who died in 2007), who wrote for television series such as \"Lou Grant\" and \"Playhouse 90.\" Bob grew up in a Jewish household, and he contracted polio when he was 6 years old. Einstein attended Chapman University, where he was a member of the basketball team, and he graduated in 1965.\n\nCareer\n\nBob began his entertainment career as a writer and performer on \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" and he won an Emmy for his work as a writer on the show, along with fellow writer Steve Martin. He would win his second Emmy for \"Van Dyke and Company\" in 1977; Einstein was a performer, producer, writer, and writing supervisor on the show.

The obituary on his official website states, \"Donations can be made in Mr. Einstein's memory to the Leukemia Lymphoma Society Bob Einstein Memorial.\" After Bob's death, his younger brother, Albert, tweeted, \"R.I.P. My dear brother Bob Einstein. A great brother, father and husband. A brilliantly funny man. You will be missed forever.\" \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" creator Larry David spoke about working with Bob, stating, \"Never have I seen an actor enjoy a role the way Bob did playing 'Marty Funkhouser' on 'Curb.' It was an amazing, unforgettable experience knowing and working with him. There was no one like him, as he told us again and again. We're all in a state of shock.\" Einstein was cremated, and his ashes were given to his family.\n\nAwards and Nominations\n\nEinstein earned six Primetime Emmy nominations, winning Outstanding Writing Achievement in Comedy, Variety or Music for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\" (1969) and Outstanding Comedy-Variety or Music Series for \"Van Dyke and Company\" (1977).
