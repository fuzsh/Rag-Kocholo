        "text": "Gene Powell -the past Chairman of the Board of Regents for the UT system- says about the T-ring.\n\n\"Billy-When I read your article this morning I quickly ran through a mental list of my early successes in life and thought about how all of them led up to my T-Ring and how the T-Ring then led to numerous other achievements ...........\" \"I always wear the T-Ring on my right hand and that means that I earned that ring with four long, hard, brutal years of work and that the ring came from someone all of them highly respected\" (DKR).\n\n\"When I was sworn in as a Regent in the spring of 2009 it was very important to me that (a) I have my T-Ring on for the swearing in and (b) that Edith and Darrell be in attendance.\"\n\nRandy McEachern says ‘Every day I wear this “T” ring, it means so much to me.” “Different people see it differently, but it’s the blood, the sweat, the hard work on the field and in the classroom.”\n\nTodd Dodge -1982-1985- says, “No one else could ever understand what went into earning the “T” ring. If you stop to reflect on what it means and the other people wearing it and what it means to them, you realize you’re in a pretty special fraternity of athletes.”\n\nJerry Gray - 1981-1984- understood early that graduating from Texas and receiving a T -ring was necessary for his career. But, he said, “The other thing was I became aware that if you graduated from Texas, you could get a job anywhere in the state because of your tremendous support system.\n\nIn 1996 the UT Athletic administration decided to present the T-ring to all qualifying athletes in all sports- not just football. The football T-ring still is designed with a topaz color stone with the \"T\" in relief. In all other sports, the \"T\" ring contains an orange stone with the \"T\" in relief.\n\nA T-Ring Reflection Point by Billy Dale\n\nhttps://texas-lsn.squarespace.com/player-and-fan-memories\n\nThe T-ring journey is synergistic and symbolic, with each recipient taking different paths to letter and graduate. For me, playing football and graduating was very difficult. My years as a student-athlete were filled with discouraging moments, setbacks, and academic challenges. The “T” ring reminds me that I succeeded in adversity.\n\nPage Elizabeth Bauerkemper, in her 2013 report titled Beyond Sports: A Guidebook for Potential Collegiate Female Student-Athletes, said, \"Many of the lessons and experiences that come from participation in athletics are career transferable skills. For example, competing with a team improves communication, leadership skill, toughness, and reliability. In addition, athletics teaches many life lessons, including how to try again after failure, triumph with class, and the advantages of going the extra mile. Employers value these skills and attributes and can enhance your career.\"\n\nFrank Denius, in his book On the Way, captures the essence of the T-ring for many recipients. But, he says, \"There is a purpose in our hardships because they demand persistence and determination to overcome. Moreover, adversity and difficulty often draw out qualities in a person that otherwise might never be realized and incorporated into useful life.\" I agree with Frank Denius.\n\nMany student-athletes every year overcome injuries, obstacles, and other hardships to fulfill their dreams of earning their T-Ring. This group of men and women possess a unique spirit, focused commitment, and an irrepressible passion for having an equity stake in Longhorn traditions that honor the past, shape the present, and empower the future.\n\nAs I look at my T-ring 50-plus years after earning it, Frank Denius and Gene Powell's words resonate with me. Looking into the burnt orange stone with the white 'T' in relief is like looking into a crystal ball that reflects my past instead of my future. My reflection in the T-Ring confirms that overcoming hardship in my formative years was an important benchmark that prepared me for the journey ahead. The T-ring validates my \"four long, hard, brutal years of work.\"\n\nBilly Dale is a proud 1971 T-Ring recipient.\n\nHAS STEVE WORSTER BEEN FORGOTTEN?\n\nby Larry Carlson https:// texaslsn.org\n\nThis summer's news that Longhorn greats Dan Neil and Michael Huff are on the ballot for next year's voting for the College Football Hall of Fame was welcome. Appropriate.\n\nBut I cannot understand for the life of me, how Steve Worster is not already in the HOF, and appears to have disappeared from consideration. It makes no sense.\n\nWorster, who died two years ago at 73, defined the wishbone fullback position and was simply the best to ever play the position in that revolutionary formation. Anywhere.\n\nThe sturdy Longhorn whose name adorned the 1967 signing class at UT, known forevermore as \"The Worster Bunch,\" spearheaded the 'bone when it was born in 1968, his soph year and first season of eligibility. The Bridge City bruiser ran over folks for three years, his Texas teams winning 30 straight games and capturing two national titles and three Southwest Conference championships.\n\nHe was twice an All-American and was a consensus first-team All-SWC choice all three years he played.\n\nThe face of Longhorn football, mighty \"Woo\" set the pace for greats who would follow in his large, deep footsteps.\n\nSeveral of Worster's Texas teammates were long ago inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Backfield mate Chris Gilbert is in. So are superlative blockers Bob McKay and Jerry Sisemore.\n\nThe best of UT's ground-gainers from yesteryear – Earl Campbell, Ricky Williams, Jimmy Saxton and Roosevelt Leaks – are Hall of Famers, as they should be.\n\nOther legendary men who wore the burnt orange, including Vince Young, Tommy Nobis, Johnnie Johnson, Ken Sims, Steve McMichael, Jerry Gray and Derrick Johnson...all are present and accounted for, as are the hosses and bosses of pre-DKR football such as Bobby Layne, Harrison Stafford and Bud McFadin.\n\nHow in the hell is Worster not there?\n\nSomebody, get Chris Del Conte on the phone. The UT powers that be need to tend to business with the sport's big dogs and fat cats on this unseemly oversight. Let's face it. The College Football Hall of Fame is diminished by the absence of the matchless Steve Worster.\n\n(TLSN's Larry Carlson is a member of the Football Writers Association of America. He teaches sports media at Texas State University and lives in San Antonio.)\n\nFor my friend Billy Dale, after reading your post today.\n\n\"Your problem Willis is too much Sweet Lucy.\"\n\nCoach Carl Davis was the most “colorful.” coach I ever had. “Willis, you’re so clumsy you trip over the center line” [on the basketball court]. And \"Willis, you run real fast, your problem is you run too long in one place.\" And, “Willis, the problem with you is you drink too much “Sweet Lucy” (aka water).\n\nMy water consumption was also a problem with Head Coach Fred Johnson. He took it as insubordination. It began during two-a-day football practices. We were allowed an 8-ounce empty Coke bottle filled with water halfway through each practice.\n\nBy then, the water was hot from being exposed to the sun. No concern, though, because he also insisted we take salt tablets. In fairness to our coaches, this was the protocol almost everywhere.\n\nFrom antiquity to the late 1960s, athletes were advised not to drink during exercise since fluid ingestion was believed to impair athletic performance. Water would slow you down.\n\nPublications soon began to warn of the dangers of dehydration, citing illnesses and deaths. I first heard about the shift from salt tablets to sports drinks in the early ’70s. By then, I was in college.\n\nLater, another coach and friend would teach me fairness and respect for others like my Dad and Coach Frasier had. His name was Darrell Royal. He once said, “The real make of a man is how he treats people who can do nothing for him.”\n\nThe first person to recruit me to play college football was Coach Burley Bearden, head coach at the University of Texas at Arlington. Coach Bearden was told about me by Carrol Brister, a football scout from Arcadia, Texas. Arcadia was also the home of my brother Buddy. He and Buddy were friends.\n\nCoach Bearden met my Dad and me at the Taco House in Angleton. The greasy spoon restaurant was on Highway 35, with a jukebox constantly playing Roy Orbison’s hits. Daddy and I ate breakfast there often. The price was low enough, and the food was not half bad. And we both liked Roy Orbison—although three songs in a row was enough. I think of that every time I watch Pretty Woman on TV, which has only been two or three times.\n\nCoach Bearden began,“Coach Fred Johnson will not recommend you.” That night, he offered me a scholarship, so whatever Coach Johnson told him was not a deal-breaker. And I’m sure my brother Buddy informed the scout I was no longer on Coach Johnson’s Christmas card list.\n\nBut it made me wonder why the next school recruited me, knowing Coach Johnson would not endorse me. I soon discovered few other colleges had heard of me. They became aware of me by watching films of games provided by Coach Johnson that showed how great my teammate Larry Webb was. Larry was the star linebacker and fullback with all the awards, and he deserved all of them.\n\nLarry was also the linebacker lined up just a few feet behind me, an unheralded defensive tackle. I had no awards, but I was 6’ 5 1/2” and 210 pounds and almost impossible to miss on film if you were scouting Larry.\n\nContrary to Coach Davis’s joke, he later said I was fast for a lineman, whatever that meant. I learned much later that the great Texas college football coaches and recruiters knew more about the integrity of high school coaches than they did the players they were recruiting.\n\nThey would go the extra mile to consider a high school player recommended by a coach they respected and trusted. I did not have that advantage, but I had Larry Webb lined up behind me on film.\n\n✯ ✯ ✯\n\nI first watched The University of Texas play football at my friend Billy Adam’s home. Billy Adam’s family owned a Color TV. I had never seen one. That was a big deal then; ours was black and white. That night, I became a fan of Duke Carlisle. He was the first college football player I ever became a fan. That night, I also became a fan of University of Texas football.\n\nI was only thirteen.\n\n✯ ✯ ✯\n\nSeveral years later, during my junior year of high school in the Fall of 1966, Coach Carl Davis walked into the Angleton gym while we practiced basketball.\n\nCoach Davis announced over the weekend that he had seen the best high school running back he had ever seen during the state playoffs. His name was Steve Worster from Bridge City. Bridge City had beaten Conroe 41-17 in the 3A Bi-district game. Angleton was a 3A school, too.\n\nIf we had won our district, we would have played Bridge City. Back then, Texas had only four classifications in high school sports, with 4A being the biggest.\n\nCoach Davis was not the only coach in the stands during that game. We soon learned that Darrell K Royal, Head Football Coach of The University of Texas, was as impressed by Worster as Carl Davis.\n\nI followed Worster’s next games in the news to see if the Conroe game was a fluke. Bridge City next handled Clear Creek, 36-7, before defeating San Marcos, 28-7.\n\nI also knew that would soon end when Bridge City faced the top-ranked team in the state, unbeaten McKinney. They had the best defense in the state and shut teams down all year. During the playoffs, McKinney had given up only seven points in three games.\n\nSteve Worster proved unstoppable and carried the ball 36 times for 249 yards and three touchdowns, leading his team to an impressive 30-6 win over previously unbeaten McKinney.\n\nNow, the stage was set to see which of the more than 75 colleges offers nationwide he would accept. Because of Worster’s choice and Duke Carlisle, I became the biggest Texas Longhorn fan this side of the Rio Grande.\n\n✯ ✯ ✯\n\nA year later, Leon Manley recruited Larry Webb and me to play football at the University of Texas on the same day during a visit to Angleton High School. Larry and I were friends. We duck hunted and fished together in the rice fields surrounding my parent’s farmhouse on 40 acres and the Brazoria County Saltgrass Country on weekends.\n\nCoach Manley and Angleton High School counselor John Craven told me I would need to take additional algebra courses that summer to be admitted to the University of Texas. They had it all planned out. I could take these courses at Alvin Junior College, only 20 miles away. UT would accept the credits from Alvin Junior College. The college was state-supported, so the tuition was reasonable. Coach Fred Johnson was not in the meeting.\n\nI had no clue why they recruited me at the time, knowing that Coach Royal sought high school coaches’ recommendations. And knowing Johnson would never recommend me.\n\n✯ ✯ ✯\n\nA decade later, in 1978, Texas Monthly published a story about Coach Johnson entitled “The Great Rockdale Mutiny.”\n\nThe article reads in part, “Fred Johnson has been a high school football coach, and on the record, a very good one. Eighteen of those years, taking whatever talent has come to him in towns like Mission, Kerrville, Gonzales, Angleton,and Rockdale, he has turned in winning seasons.\n\nLast year, Johnson’s teams won state championships in football and track. This year, he is out of a job.”\n\nThe article continued: “But this was no ordinary coaching ouster. Johnson resigned after every team member signed a petition asking for his dismissal, and the resulting upheaval, replete with overtones of ideology and class, has threatened to tear this Central Texas town apart.”\n\nJohnson was quoted in the article as saying, “Players learn the willingness to give their time, accept strict rules, and subordinate themselves for the good of the team. Some don’t and can’t accept those things and become failures.”\n\nHis words rang familiar. Ten years before the Rockdale High School Mutiny, Fred Johnson insisted I meet in his office to discuss my insubordination. He explained that he had done his best with me but had resigned to the fact that he had failed and I would always be a loser. His words did not discourage me but had the opposite effect.\n\n✯ ✯ ✯\n\nLarry Webb and I visited Austin and the UT campus unofficially. Larry said, “You want to meet Steve Wooster? He’s a roommate with Jay Cormier from Freeport.” Jay played high school football at Brazosport, just a few minutes south of Angleton.\n\n“No thanks,” I said, “I’ve got to meet a friend.” She was a girl from Austin named Cindy Barefield who often visited her mother in Angleton. We had a couple dates in Angleton, but Austin was a four-hour drive. I could not afford 30 cents a gallon for gas, and my tires were always threadbare.\n\nWhen Larry and I met later, he said, “You should have come and met Worster.\n\nI responded, “Let’s see Larry, have lunch with my beautiful date, or meet Steve Wooster.” When I got home the next day, I had second thoughts; I could have seen her again the next time she visited Angleton. I still regret that decision.\n\nThe truth is it had nothing to do with her. I was too shy and intimidated to meet my high school football idol. “Big Woo,” Steve Worster soon became the cornerstone of the Texas Longhorn’s famed Wishbone offense. I never met him. He died on August 13, 2022. I’m still a fan.\n\n✯ ✯ ✯\n\nI also never took the needed math classes due to my parents’ divorce two months after Coach Manley’s visit. In those days, divorce was a huge deal. No one in my family had ever divorced in our known family history. I was devastated when I saw my mother’s tears. They had been married for 20 years.\n\n✯ ✯ ✯\n\nAfter college, Larry Webb and I stayed in touch until about a decade before his tragic death. I suddenly lost track of him. After college, he worked with Pelican’s Wharf Restaurant in Austin and later in San Antonio. I ate at both several times to visit him.\n\nLarry played on two of UT’s National Champion football teams. Larry was a better player than me. Those teams had more talent than I’d ever seen. I would have never started, but the bench was not a bad seat to watch the games, and what an honor it would have been, not to mention the financial advantages of a scholarship. I had no money.\n\n✯ ✯ ✯\n\nLarry Webb died on February 3, 2019. He’d been suffering for four or five years from Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is a progressive and fatal brain disease associated with repeated traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), including concussions and repeated blows to the head. He ultimately died of Renal Cell Carcinoma while in hospice care. I miss him.\n\nLarry’s story is at https://texas-lsn.squarespace.com/larry-webb-2019\n\nPhotos below - Larry signing with Texas, playing high school football, diagnosed with CTE, and"
