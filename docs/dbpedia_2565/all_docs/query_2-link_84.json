        "text": "Bob Einstein, best known for his recurring role as Marty Funkhouser on HBO’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and for creating the hapless stuntman character Super Dave Osborne, died Wednesday in Indian Wells, California. He was 76.\n\nHe was the older brother of actor-director Albert Brooks, who tweeted, “R.I.P. My dear brother Bob Einstein. A great brother, father and husband. A brilliantly funny man. You will be missed forever.”\n\nThe entertainment website Deadline reported that the two-time Emmy Award winner had recently been diagnosed with cancer.\n\nEinstein began his career as a writer for several variety series, including “The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour” and “The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour.” His work earned him Emmy Awards in 1969 and 1977, as well as four more nominations.\n\nIn 1972, he debuted the character Super Dave Osborne, an unlucky stuntman whose daredevil adventures would always go awry.\n\nHe appeared in 22 total episodes of the Larry David comedy series “Curb Your Enthusiasm” as Funkhouser. His other TV credits include appearances on “Arrested Development,” “Anger Management” and “Roseanne.”"
