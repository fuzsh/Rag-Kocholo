Scroll down to see more celebrity weight loss transformations!\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nBilly Gardell - 150 pounds\n\nThe Mike & Molly alum got real about his weight loss — going from 370 pounds at his heaviest to \"float[ing] between 205 and 210,\" he told Entertainment Tonight in April 2023.\n\n\"I think you got to find peace with yourself and at some point, look in the mirror and go, 'You know, it's probably time to take care of you.' And I didn't get that note early on,\" the actor shared, noting he tackled his health during the COVID-19 pandemic, which involved him undergoing bariatric surgery, eating healthier and more. \"But I'm a big believer that when you get it, you get it. It doesn't matter what it is, as long as you get it.\"\n\nDespite the fact that Gardell has made incredible improvements to his physical health — including that he no longer has Type 2 diabetes and has a notably lower heart rate — body-shamers still troll him.\n\n“There's always people online that, you know, when I was heavy, they were like 'You're too heavy!' And now it's like, 'Are you sick?’” he said. “Can I just walk the earth, please?!\"\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nQuinton Aaron — 97 Pounds\n\nThe Blind Side actor revealed in February 2022 that he went from 559 pounds to 462 pounds after gaining weight during the coronavirus pandemic. Aaron detailed his weight loss progress to TMZ, noting that he cut out candy and bread to start off the new year.\n\n“I used the new year as a way to get a new me,” the Baby Pact actor told the outlet at the time, revealing that he used to eat two jumbo-sized KitKat packs and two Reese’s packs every morning. He has since added salad to his diet and begun walking and stretching in order to reach his goal weight of losing 64 more pounds by May 2022.\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Gregory Gourdet/Instagram\n\nGregory Gourdet — 40 Pounds\n\nAfter a tough start to 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Top Chef alum lost 40 pounds, sharing his progress via Instagram in January 2022.\n\n“Between gyms closing, a running injury (I have a torn meniscus) and survival eating at work, I gained a good amount of weight in 2020,” the Kann restaurant founder wrote. “At my highest weight ever, I pressed the health reset button in July. But everything that had worked in the past including yoga and intermittent fasting just wasn’t working. I power walked on a treadmill for months until my therapist told me I could run again. I went keto for the first time and extended my fasting to 20 to 24 hours a few days a week and finally started losing the extra weight.”\n\nHe also shared an empowering message about his journey: \"Reminder that health isn’t measured by weight. Thick or thin, always love yourself. Live in whatever body you feel comfortable in and don’t compare yourself to people on the internet. We all come in different shapes and sizes and can all do different things in our bodies.”\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nJacob Batalon — 112 Pounds\n\nThe Marvel star reflected on his 112-pound weight loss after spending most of 2020 working on his overall health. “I decided to get into this sort of transformation, or this sort of journey, with my health and fitness at the end of 2019. Even when I wasn’t doing anything physical, I found myself getting sleepy at work and it was because of all the fat food I was eating,\" he explained to Men's Health in December 2021. “I could not believe I let myself get this far. That’s what sort of started it all.” After establishing a diet and exercise regimen, the Spider-Man: Homecoming actor dropped a significant amount of weight. \"I found a lot of light in the dark in the sense that a lot of people were suffering and I was fortunate and lucky enough to have found my health and all those things,\" he told the outlet.\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Grant Gustin/Instagram\n\nGrant Gustin\n\nGustin has been working hard to bulk up amid criticism over his slim physique throughout the years. The Virginia native shared a side-by-side photo showing how much muscle he's put on while quarantining at home.\n\n\"A little progress report from last season to this season. About 7 months ago I decided to break my cycle of not taking care of myself as well as I should,\" he wrote via Instagram. \"As many of you know, I've had some anxiety and sometimes depression for as long as I can remember. Over the last 7-10 years or so as I've been more of a 'public figure' and had a busier schedule, my anxiety only got worse. It has always had a terrible affect [sic] on my appetite and just motivation in general.\n\nThe actor said he decided to work on being \"a better me\" amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"That’s included eating better(and more), working out, daily meditation, and just trying to be more present and happy with who I am,\" Gustin continued. \"I will always be a work in progress, but I’m proud of myself for taking steps I wish I could’ve taken a long time ago to be a better version of myself physically and mentally - not only for myself but also for the people around me. All this to say, around episode 2 or 3 of season 7, Flash is gonna have a little bit of beef on his lanky frame. But more importantly I feel much happier and more present than I have in a long time.\"\n\nCredit: Erik Pendzich/Shutterstock; Courtesy Adrienne Bailon/Instagram\n\nAdrienne Bailon — 20 Pounds\n\nThe former Cheetah Girls star opened up about how staying committed to her wellness journey helped her through the coronavirus pandemic in May 2020. \"During this time more than ever...

One month earlier, she told fans that she was feeling \"good\" after slimming down and working with a \"really great\" nutritionist. \"I thought it was a thyroid thing, so I was going to the doctor and getting blood work done,\" she replied to an Instagram follower. \"I think it’s really important to also check up on your health because even though it wasn’t a thyroid thing, I did discover that my glucose levels were pretty high and that could’ve led to some maybe pre-diabetic problems.\"\n\nCredit: TLC; Courtesy Jorge Nava/Instagram\n\nJorge Nava — More Than 120 Pounds\n\nWhile serving time in prison, the 90 Day Fiancé star turned to fitness and debuted his more than 120-pound weight loss. \"I know it's a tough time for everyone right now.

In an interview on “Behind the Medal” podcast released on December 20, 2019, the British singer revealed that he quit smoking three years prior and got into running to “clean my lungs out.” He started by only being able to run for “three songs” bit is now fit enough to do 45 minutes in the morning followed by a swim or sit-ups. The “Put It All on Me” singer attributed his weight gain to American food while on tour saying, “You finish a gig in America [and] you get a tray of chicken wings, sit in the back of the bus, watch The Simpsons, drink a couple bottles of wine. Then that’s every single day so it just piles on you.”\n\nCredit: David J Phillip/AP/Shutterstock; Courtesy Ryan Lochte/Instagram\n\nRyan Lochte — 21 Pounds\n\nAfter being plagued by scandals following the Rio 2016 games, the Olympic swimmer took a break from the sport. But in October 2019, Lochte shared a before and after photo of himself on Instagram, announcing that he’d lost 21 pounds in just two months and was getting ready for a Tokyo 2020 bid. “Getting my groove back thanks to the help of @fitplan_app,” wrote the gold medalist. “I’ve adjusted my diet and upgraded my fitness routine and I’m down 21 pounds since Nationals in August! Not only is it my goal to make my 5th olympics but it would be an honor to represent USA in Tokyo next Summer!”\n\nCredit: Curtis Means/Ace Pictures/Shutterstock; Courtesy of Gia Giudice/Instagram\n\nJoe Giudice — Up to 70 Pounds\n\nThe Real Housewives of New Jersey star was nearly unrecognizable after the 41 months he spent in prison for fraud. On October 13, 2019, days after Joe was released from ICE custody, his daughter Gia Giudice shared a full-length Instagram photo of him that showed a remarkably slimmed-down frame. At the time, Massachusetts-based nutritionist and trainer Ray Abdwell told Us Weekly the 5-foot-5 reality star could have lost up to 70 pounds of body fat while gaining muscle mass. “Given his height, I would guess Joe has lost anywhere from 40 to 60 pounds of body fat. It could possibly be even more, even up to around 70 pounds,” said the pro. “When someone loses a sizable amount of body fat, the greatest indicators are in the belly area and around the face, which Joe has clearly done.”\n\nCredit: Blitz Pictures/Shutterstock; MediaPunch/Shutterstock\n\nSimon Cowell — 20 Pounds\n\nSwitching to a vegan diet and living a more active lifestyle made a 20-pound difference! “When you're 60, and you have a 5-year-old little boy, who, when he wakes up, is bouncing off the ceiling, it's like, you've got to try and keep that energy yourself,” the X-Factor judge told Us Weekly in September 2019 of getting healthier in an effort to keep up with his son, Eric. “So that was my biggest thing, but changing my diet and everything else. I've got to play football with him. I've got to take him go-karting. So that was a much-needed push.”\n\nCredit: Getty Images (2)\n\nMissy Elliott — 30 Pounds\n\nElliott flaunted her new body on Instagram in May 2018. “Proudly to say it’s been 4 months I have only drank water no other juices or soda & I cut out bread & Lord knows that’s been the hardest for me!” The “Work It” rapper — who looks fantastic now, though her weight has fluctuated a bit — not only showed off a slimmed-down figure, she also said her new diet helped her skin glow and made her feel less sluggish. “Didn’t [lose] 70 pounds that was during my Under Construction album,” Elliott wrote on Twitter in 2014. “I lost 30 eating healthy/work out to @shauntfitness T25 videos.”\n\nCredit: Janette Pellegrini/Getty Images; Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic\n\nJordin Sparks — 50 Pounds\n\nThe \"Tattoo\" singer radiated confidence while showing off her 50-pound weight loss at the 2012 Teen Choice Awards. \"There is no secret,\" she told Us on the red carpet. \"It's just eating better and working out!
