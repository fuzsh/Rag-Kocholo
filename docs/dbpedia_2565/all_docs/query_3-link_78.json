        "text": "A NOTE FROM THE PRODUCING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n\nCatharsis Is Just Another Word For Theatre That Changes You\n\nAs my father always told me, art teaches us hard and painful lessons so we don’t have to go through them ourselves.\n\nThese lessons have an almost indescribable impact on our hearts and souls. Our marketing team has tried hard to find a jazzy way to describe that impact. Why are people cheering during the fatal end of Hamlet? Everyone lies there, dead, yet the audience can’t help but applaud passionately. The Diary of Anne Frank brought many people who walked through our doors to tears. How could something so tragic, so painful, prompt others to tell their friends they must see it?\n\nAristotle (I hesitate to sound pretentious by bringing up his name, but you are at a Greek tragedy) famously used the word “catharsis” when discussing that the purpose of tragedy is to arouse “terror and pity.” When we vicariously experience deeply painful things in a controlled circumstance, specifically in art (on a stage, in a song, in a novel, in a painting), the audience’s own personal angst becomes externally directed and their empathy is stimulated for the protagonist. The result is profoundly beneficial for both society and the individual.\n\nIt’s why you’re here tonight. It’s why we offer tragic stories. It is suspense, horror, joy, and all the emotions that would still come to life on our stage even if Aristotle never mentioned catharsis thousands of years ago.\n\nCatharsis, I will sadly admit, now feels like a pompous word. In fairness, it’s the only word that truly captures the emotional journey art is meant to take us on. But perhaps some things are just better sensed rather than characterized by an often-confusing short-hand term to describe the ineffable.\n\nSo here you are, watching a play that Aristotle knew well, that is full of pity and terror. Though the story is 2,500 years old, it is still profoundly moving and asks questions we are still wrestling with today. What is justice? What is vengeance? What will religion demand from us? And is mercy the most remarkable human trait of all?\n\nNo, I won’t tell you this play is cathartic. I simply hope that you leave here feeling something, whatever it may be. I hope The Oresteia has moved you. I hope it has changed you.\n\nThank you,\n\nLesley Malin\n\nProducing Executive Director\n\nA NOTE FROM THE PLAYWRIGHT\n\nTaken from Ellen McLaughlin’s essay on The Oresteia\n\nI began writing my version of The Oresteia in the summer of 2016 in what seems another world, and got a draft of the first two acts together fairly quickly, passing them in by late October. I was puzzling over how I might approach the third act, the one everyone agrees is the hardest because it can become a kind of tedious civics lesson, when the unthinkable happened with the election of that American president. I came to a dead stop and could see no way forward, not only in the play but in my life.\n\nThe Oresteia is about how a people moves on after having seen the worst human beings are capable of. What do we do once we have become morally unrecognizable? People in the past have sometimes recovered the best of human nature, even when they thought it had been lost forever. Let’s think of times in human history when, even after the worst has happened, people have done the right thing.\n\nI thought, if I can find a way to bring that essential grace to the third act of my play, I might be able to write my way to something like hope in these dark times. So that’s what I tried to do. We don’t offer judgement at the end so much as the mystery of mercy, born of the act of listening and recognition.\n\nAthens in her ancient glory may have fallen, as her playwrights and poets always warned she might, but the scent of her lingers all these centuries hence with the handful of plays we are still marveling at. The world has kept some of that beauty and the memory of her best dreams. They survive in us, and they can serve us as we serve them in our own bad times, knowing that something of us, too, will last, even if the worst happens, even so.\n\nEllen McLaughlin\n\nPlaywright and Adaptor\n\nLizzi Albert (ELECTRA) is a CSC Touchstone Company Member who has worked with CSC since 2012 as an actor, director, and teaching artist.
