'Super Dave' goes weekly Stuntman takes the spotlight LOS ANGELES (AP) Bob Einstein might give a thumbs-up sign as \"Super Dave\" Osborne, the hapless stuntman he plays on Showtime's \"Super Dave\" series. But more often than not, his leave him bottoms up. \"Super Dave,\" a comedy and variety show that premiered recently on the pay cable network, is the first spinoff from a cable series, Einstein said. He developed the \"Super Dave\" character in the six years he and Allan Blye did \"Bizarre\" for Showtime .\n\n\"Super Dave\" looks and talks like a stuntman, from his aw-shucks attitude to his red-white-and-blue jumpsuit. But somehow nothing ever seems to go right. \"I'm wishing luck to everyone, then my head is pounded into my Einstein said. \"I think everything will come out fine, but it never does. The stunts always go wrong .\n\nThey're planned, they're rehearsed, but when it comes time to do them for the show we have problems. I have great recuperative powers. \"Everybody's trying to find a new way to do variety. So, instead of singing songs, I get killed. All our guests have a great time on the show .\n\nIt's a different feeling doing a variety show as a character. \"It's hard to do a variety show. It's hard to do all that small talk and make it sound real. When you have a star, he becomes the focus of a variety show, and he has to take himself seriously. But with Super Dave, it's all phony anyway .\n\nThe baloney is really baloney, and it's a way of not taking yourself The first show featured guest star Ray Charles and a cameo by Carol Burnett, plus a real stunt by a group of acrobats who perform precision basketball slam-dunk routines after leaping from trampolines. \"Super Dave\" will become a weekly series in January. Einstein is primarily a writer and producer and got into performing only after Tom Smothers spotted him on a local TV show. \"I did a put-on character who said he was responsible for putting the names of stars along Hollywood Einstein said. \"Someone asked me how to get a name on the sidewalk, and I got huffy and said I couldn't be bought .\n\nHe asked me again and I said, Have you got Tommy saw it and bought the character until I did the The award-winning advertising copywriter became a writer and performer on Glenn Campbell Summer Series.\" Later, he became head writer for Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.\" His writing partner was Steve Martin. It was on the Smothers show that he developed the character of Officer Judy. \"He was the show he said. \"Once I arrested Liberace for playing too fast. I would keep the show on its toes.\" He and Blye, his partner for the past 14 years, wrote and produced \"Van Dyke and Company.\" Einstein also wrote and directed his own movie, \"Another Fine Mess,\" and was head writer for two Andy Williams specials and \"The Sonny and Cher Comedy He was co-host of 45 segments of \"The Steve Allen The tall, lanky Einstein grew up Shining in Pre-Holiday Sale shadows reputation well, we're gonna up on offense, which care to do because problems there,\" he and behold, we lose so to go with a guy set foot in this ofNever .\n\nplaying with two quarterbacks and the up and people So we've gone the very seldom do you in the middle of the any type of suc- not, the quick-quippfor his one-liners tricks, has become an introvert, rarely appearances or interviews. every Notre Dame him has commented envision what the job it, Holtz says: endorse that statement You have no idea of of the demands on pressure that sort of Not pressure that do this, but you just responsibility there.\" seems low-key, it's wants the media athletes.

At Arkansas, we didn't have to build one; we just had to remodel it to a certain extent .\n\nBut every other place we've had to build a football program, and usually from the ground up. And to do that, you also needed to get people in the stands, you needed to get attention.\" At Notre Dame, which doesn't need to sell tickets (123 sellouts in the last 124 home games) and only has to blink to get on TV. Holtz can concentrate on winning. \"We've always had five goals at virtually every place we've been. Here, you have four .\n\nOne, of course, is a winning season; two is to play in a bowl game, three is to play in a bowl game on Jan. 1 and four is to win the national championship.

His father was Harry Einstein, better known as Nick Parkayakarkus, the host of the radio show \"Meet Me at Parky's\" who also starred on shows with Eddie Cantor and Al Jolson .\n\nEinstein's mother was Thelma Leeds, a singer and actress. A half-brother, Charles Einstein, is a sports writer and author. \"I loved humor,\" Einstein said. \"I had that in me. But I had no ambition to go into show business when I was growing up .\n\nI started out a as an advertising copywriter and evolved into it. Once you get into it, however, it's very difficult to get out. It gets into your blood. You don't want to do anything else. You want that excitement.\" Einstein has never lost his love of radio .\n\n\"I used to go to the studio with my father,\" he said. \"It was very exciting. I loved listening to Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy as a kid. You could really use your imagination. \"Television is much tougher .\n\nPeople have heard all the jokes. Radio was fresher.
