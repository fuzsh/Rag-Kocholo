        "text": "joey arcuri\n\nIntermediate/Advanced Upright Bass, Song Arrangement\n\nJoey is a professional double bassist and strings teacher from Ithaca, NY. He has a Bachelor of Music in Double Bass Performance from Ithaca College (2009) and a Master of Science in Music Education from Syracuse University (2023). In the interim between both schools, Arcuri established himself as a contributing force in (and beyond) the Central New York music scene. His musical endeavors span broadly from popular music, singer-songwriter folk, classical, jazz, and musical theater.\n\nAlthough always active in his freelance performance career, Arcuri is most widely known as being the bassist of Driftwood, a folk-rock band from Binghamton, NY. Arcuri joined Driftwood in 2011 and has shared stages with Donna the Buffalo, Old Crow Medicine Show, Rusted Root, Greensky Bluegrass, and Marty Stewart.\n\nIn 2023, Arcuri started his first year as an elementary orchestra teacher at two schools in the Ithaca City School District - Cayuga Heights and Caroline Elementary. Life is busy but rewarding for Joey as he inspires the youth with his teaching and continues to dazzle crowds with his high-spirited musicianship.\n\nELIJAH OCEAN\n\nBass with Josh Hedley and the Hedliners Honky Tonk Dance, Country rhythm(relationship between bass and drums and the basics of different rhythm patterns), Country Songs Old and New, Songwriting, The Nashville Number System, Covers\n\nAmericanafest, and SXSW. He was praised as an artist to watch in Rolling Stone, Saving Country Music, LA WElijah is an artist, storyteller, multi-instrumentalist, producer, folk-singing honky-tonk man with six full-length solo albums, countless singles and EPs, multiple side projects and collaborations, and a hefty history of touring behind other artists such as Joshua Hedley and Zephaniah Ohora. He’s opened for acts like Charley Crockett and Dale Watson and put in well over ten thousand hours on stages from coast to coast. Born in a cabin in the woods of New York State’s Hudson Valley and raised in a farmhouse in Midcoast Maine, Ocean began writing songs in his parent’s barn at a young age. Pursuing that passion, he went on to study music in college and then to play in several regional rock bands before moving to Brookyln in ‘09. It was there he honed his voice and vision, establishing himself as a unique and authentic musical talent with the release of his folk-rock debut Tumble & Fall in 2012. A steady regimen of national touring followed, with Ocean recording two sessions for Daytrotter and playing to packed houses from Mercury Lounge in NYC to the Troubadour in LA.Ocean eventually landed in the City of Angels and remained anchored there for six years, releasing four more albums while staying busy on the road. He began working as a bass player in dance halls, honky tonks, and casinos, playing country standards and learning the nuances of traditional dance rhythms. These influences seeped their way into his style, with the music sounding both contemporary and nostalgic. He played festivals like Stagecoach, Americanafest, and SXSW. He was praised as an artist to watch in Rolling Stone, Saving Country Music, LA Weekly, Uproxx, Wide Open Country, and beyond.In 2021, Ocean moved to Nashville where he quickly found his place and has remained busy writing, performing, and producing records out of his home studio, Back Cabin Sound. Self-reflection has been a consistent theme in his writing, but with age comes lived experiences, and his commentaries on timeless themes of devotion, divorce, and drinking have become more tangible and heartfelt. His gift lies in faithfully constructing melodies and lyrics that are rooted in the traditions of the genre, but are undeniably modern and fresh at the same time. Ocean’s aim is to take the baton from the forbearers of the straightforward American storyteller model and extend its reach to old and new fans alike. Stay tuned, there’s way more to come.\n\nThe Daily Country said he was a “songwriter’s songwriter”\n\nRolling Stone dubbed him a “journeyman.”"
