        "text": "Comedian Bob Einstein, best known for the stuntman character Super Dave Osborne, and as recurring character Marty Funkhouser on ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm,’ died on Jan. 2 following a recent diagnosis with cancer. He was 76.\n\nEinstein got his big break on “The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour” in the 1960s as a writer—for which he won an Emmy Award—and a performer, portraying Officer Judy. In the 1970s, he added to his Emmy collection, winning for producing Dick Van Dyke’s “Van Dyke and Company.” Also in the ‘70s, he created Super Dave Osborne, making many television appearances as the character over the years and starring in the movie “The Extreme Adventures of Super Dave” in 2000. He appeared in 22 episodes of “Curb Your Enthusiasm” over a 13-year period.\n\nBorn Stewart Robert Einstein on Nov. 29, 1942, Einstein was the son of comedian Harry “Parkyakarkus” Einstein and actress Thelma Leeds. He was the older brother of actor, writer and director Albert Brooks, who joined many in the entertainment business in posting tributes on social media.\n\n“R.I.P. My dear brother Bob Einstein,” Brooks wrote. “A great brother, father and husband. A brilliantly funny man. You will be missed forever.”\n\nMembers of the “Curb” family also weighed in, including its creator and star Larry David. “Never have I seen an actor enjoy a role the way Bob did playing Marty Funkhouser on ‘Curb’” David said in a statement. “It was an amazing, unforgettable experience knowing and working with him. There was no one like him, as he told us again and again. We’re all in a state of shock.”\n\n“His long career is hard to match. His role on #curbyourenthusiasm was excruciatingly brilliant! Our cast and crew will be devastated,” tweeted Richard Lewis."
