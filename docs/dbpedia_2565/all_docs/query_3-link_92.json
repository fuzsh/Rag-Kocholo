        "text": "Mine eyes have seen the glory of the class of ’49.\n\nBut after 14 years, mine eyes no longer shine.\n\nMacular degeneration has caused my vision to decline.\n\nAs our three dozen or so survivors go marching on.\n\nThe class of 1949 was a bastardized class, with many members having their key life experiences overseas before they ever came to Hanover and others graduating before their military lives kicked in. In my case, the 3/2 program at Tuck bypassed the chance to meet many of you as undergrads, though I later got to know some well at reunions or write their obituaries later on.\n\nIt has been a real pleasure for me to have served as secretary and to have interacted with many of you but the time has come for me to sign off. Good luck to all.\n\n—John Adler, 75 Silo Circle, Riverside, CT 06878; (203) 622-9069\n\nDeke Jackson is still living in his own home with Nadine in Mount Dora, Florida. A banker, he attended a convention in Washington, D.C., and contacted our then U.S. senator classmate Slade Gorton. When he visited the U.S. Senate gallery with his banker friends, Slade was the head honcho that day, and waved his gavel at the group. It made a big impression on his fellow bankers.\n\nDeke mentioned that he recently read an op-ed article in The New York Times by John B. Daukas Jr. ’84, son of our late classmate and an attorney. Deke was friendly with the Daukas family and met John Jr. on family visits.\n\nRichie Wolff and Beth are in an assisted living residence in Portland, Oregon. Richie has his share of health problems but is still managing to play golf.\n\nGeorge Frederick Day died on December 7, 2022, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he lived. He received his doctorate at the University of Colorado and taught English literature for many years at the University of Northern Iowa. George was a Civil War buff and he sent me his great grandfather’s diary. He is survived by his wife, Clara, and sons David and John, and daughter Georgianna.\n\nBenjamin Jacobson Jr. died on January 4 at his home in Boca Raton, Florida. Ben spent a 40-year career as a stockbroker in his family’s firm on Wall Street. After retiring in 1987, he moved to Florida, where he spent his time boating, writing music, and playing the organ for family and friends. Ben is survived by his wife, Maureen, his son, and four daughters.\n\nWilliam N. Marden died at home in Ocean-side, California, on January 1. Bill received his architecture degree at R.P.I. and practiced in the Albany, New York, area for 40 years. After retiring he and his wife, Joan, moved to Panama City Beach, Florida, and snorkeled all over the world. Bill is survived by Joan and daughters Carolyn and Laura and son James.\n\n—John Adler, 75 Silo Circle, Riverside, CT 06878; (203) 622-9069; (203) 344-1583 (fax)\n\nLast fall I wrote that there were about 40 members of our class who were exposed to this column. A few have since left for greener pastures.\n\nWith your news hard to come by, I tried bribery with a now-expired offer of a free copy of my Thomas Nast biography. Two of you answered, about a 5-percent return rate.\n\nBob Rooke lives in Morristown, New Jersey, and frequently passes Nast’s home there. Bob had a very successful career in finance and is our stalwart treasurer emeritus. At 98, he is still enjoying life with Natalie, his wife of 72 years.\n\nBob Fitch called from his home in El Prado, New Mexico, near Taos. His wife died two years ago, so he is living alone. A chemist, Bob taught at North Dakota State and the University of Connecticut before becoming vice president for research and development at S.C. Johnson. After retiring, he moved to the Taos area for the skiing and didn’t stop until he crashed at 92.\n\nEdmund A. Heller Jr. died on October 18, 2022. His last known address was in Nashville. Ed got his master’s at Tuck and worked for a sporting goods company at the time of our 25th reunion in 1974. He was married, had no children, and, by his own admission, was not in touch with any of his classmates.\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123, Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943 (fax)\n\nJoe Sullivan Jr. ’78 called to tell me (and then sent me) a column about his dad’s football career. We reminisced about Joe’s long back-and-forth run against Cornell—maybe 100 yards—in a game that no one who saw will ever forget.\n\nEdward Luman Clogston died on December 24, 2021, in Wilmington, Massachusetts, where he lived. Ed spent his business career with Aetna Life and Casualty, first in New York City and then in Hartford, Connecticut, in sales management. After retiring to Brownsville, Vermont, Ed spent a second career as a ski instructor. He leaves his wife, Majorie, daughters Eleanor and Ruth, and son Albert.\n\nJames Michael Dowaliby Jr. died on October 5, 2022, in New Haven, Connecticut, where he lived. Jim had an unusually varied career. After Dartmouth he spent three years in the Army, a few in Roswell, New Mexico, running a book shop and art gallery, and then became an oilfield scout. Accepted at Yale New Haven Medical School in his 30s, he graduated in 1967 and then became a surgical otolaryngologist on staff until his retirement in 1988. In a fourth career, he taught darkroom photography at a college in New Haven. Jim is survived by his wife, JoAnne, daughters Cole and Shana, and son James III.\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123, Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943, fax\n\nClass president Ray Truncellito was recently honored with the Distinguished American Award by the National Football Foundation Joe Yukica Chapter. (Yukica was a former Dartmouth football coach.) The award recognized Ray’s stature as a pillar of the Manchester, New Hampshire, community for his personal and philanthropic contributions to local organizations. Congratulations, Ray!\n\nNo news from other living classmates, so I’ll try a bribe: Look at ThomasNast.com, my new website that tells Nast’s story and displays 160 of his cartoons with his characters identified and content and context explained. Any qualified classmate who calls or writes me with news about himself will receive a free copy of the 830-page, $75 America’s Most Influential Journalist: The Life, Times and Legacy of Thomas Nast (which has been praised by leading historians).\n\nThomas Ambrose McManus Jr. died on May 29 near Little Silver, New Jersey, where he lived. Tom received his D.D.S. from the University of Pennsylvania and practiced dentistry in Red Bank, New Jersey, until he retired. He is survived by five daughters and a son.\n\nWilliam M. Bollenback Jr. died on May 9 at his home in Ajijic, Jalisco, Mexico. “Bollie” received his M.B.A. from Tuck in 1950 and has been an active supporter of Tuck ever since. He retired as president of a division of what is now Honeywell at age 55 to enjoy a casual lifestyle in Mexico. He is survived by his wife, Nancy, son William III ’78, and daughters Leslie and Ann.\n\nHerman E. Muller Jr. died on February 10, 2019, in New York City, where he lived. Skip actually graduated from Ithaca College, where he later chaired the board of trustees, and received his M.S. from Columbia. Skip was a certified public accountant with multiple famous clients. As a hobby he regularly played bass with several jazz bands in Greenwich Village (N.Y.C.). He is survived by son John and daughter Evieanne.\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123, Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943, fax\n\nOur dwindling class has gone almost incommunicado. Here’s an update.\n\nAccording to a recent College listing, we have 65 living classmates. Twenty-five of them didn’t include any biographical data in our 50th reunion booklet (1999), so I assume that they are not interested in the class. That leaves about 40 members who presumably are interested.\n\nFrom that group, I found a dozen classmates whose names have not appeared in this column since I began writing it 12 years ago. Five of them had disconnected phone numbers and another five had no answering devices. But I did catch up with Bud Petersen and George Weinstein.\n\nBud and his wife, Elsie, have been married for 71 years and are enjoying life in their Simsbury, Connecticut, retirement home. When Bud graduated he joined his family’s home delivery milk business and transformed it into a chain of 12 family restaurants in the Hartford, Connecticut, area, along with an ice cream manufacturing plant. He remained close to his roommate Doug Thomson until Doug died two years ago.\n\nGeorge is healthy and living by himself in the Boca Raton, Florida, home he and Barbara bought in the early 1990s; she died six years ago. George, with an LL.D. from Yale and an M.B.A. from Columbia, was a certified public accountant partner of Deloitte in New Haven, Connecticut, and then the Miami area. After retiring from Deloitte at 60, George practiced law, specializing in wills and estates. He’s in touch with Skip Unger, his four-year roommate.\n\nSpeaking of Skip, he was the only 49er to “oink” in response to my plea for news two issues ago. (He knows how tough it is from his years as newsletter editor.) He spends his time playing bridge as well as the piano in nursing homes. Although Skip got remarried (to Luba) shortly after our 70th reunion, he’s decided not to have any more children.\n\nDr. Robert Benjamin Berg died on February 5, 2020, in Honolulu, where he lived. Bob received his M.D. from Harvard. He was survived by his wife, Dorothy, five sons, and a daughter.\n\n—John Adler, 75 Silo Circle, Riverside, CT 06878; (203) 622-9069; (203) 344-1583, fax\n\nIn March Joel Berson and I had the pleasure of listening to Coach Buddy Teevens ’79 tell the Dartmouth Club of Sarasota, Florida, about his innovative tackling dummy program, which has minimized injuries during practice. His ideas are being widely adopted by other teams and even the NFL is observing. How lucky Dartmouth is to have Buddy as coach of the Ivy League co-champions!\n\nThe only other class news is that the Rev. Edward Harding MacBurney died on March 17 in Moline, Illinois, where he lived. Ed received his bachelor of sacred theology from Berkeley Divinity School in 1952 and then spent 20 years as a priest at St. Thomas Church in Hanover. “Seeking a stretch,” he became bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Quincy, Illinois (which included Davenport, Iowa, and Moline) until his retirement. Ed is survived by son James and daughter Page.\n\nWith space to fill, I’ll tell you about my book, which I published in June after 27 years of collecting information and about 11 years of writing: America’s Most Influential Journalist: The Life, Times and Legacy of Thomas Nast. As you may recall, Nast created the Republican elephant and the modern Santa Claus and Uncle Sam, popularized the Democratic donkey, brought down New York’s “Boss Tweed” and his ring of thieves, and influenced five presidential elections.\n\nThe 832-page book contains 1,000 Nast cartoons, illustrations, sketches, and paintings—800 of them from Harper’s Weekly and the balance from other, rare publications—as well as 100 cartoons by other artists on related topics. Each has its content and context explained and its characters identified. A manually prepared index (it took me a year) includes topics and people portrayed in the cartoons of more than a 30-year period, making it a unique pictorial reference book. People can buy it at my ThomasNast.com website (featuring about 150 Nast cartoons on the Civil War, Lincoln, Tweed, Christmas, and Shakespeare, among other topics) as well as at Amazon.com.\n\n—John Adler, 75 Silo Circle, Riverside, CT 06878; (203) 622-9069; (203) 344-1583, fax\n\nJoel Berson and I attended our good Sarasota, Florida, friend Tom Towler’s celebration of life along with 30 of his direct descendants and his companion, Nancy Lyon.\n\nDale Jacobson’s wife died last year, so he is living by himself in his condo in Somers, New York. Dale spent his career in the treasury department of Exxon. He is still driving, shopping, and maintaining an optimistic attitude about life’s vicissitudes.\n\nJim Mytton checked in from Bloomfield, Colorado. After receiving his master’s in geology from the University of Wyoming, Jim spent his career with the U.S. Geological Survey. Jim was primed to attend our 70th reunion, but the untimely death of his son prevented that. Jim also lost his wife last year but is in good health living in a retirement home.\n\nYou may have read about the man who received a pig’s heart in a transplant. When the doctor explained what would happen, he seemed oblivious until the doctor asked, “Do you understand?” Finally, he responded: “Am I going to oink?” My educated guess is that four-score-plus classmates are still with us. If you want this column to continue with anything but obituaries, you need to oink by snail mail or phone. (My College-supplied directory is 18 months out of date, as are many of your addresses and phone numbers.) So let me hear from you (sorry, no email)!\n\nOne classmate I tried in vain to reach was Ray Powers, who evidently still operates his own literary agency in New York City. His report in our 50th reunion book was so different from any other classmate that I’ll summarize it here. Ray was a theatrical agent and personal manager for Jane Fonda, Geena Rowlands, Thelma Ritter, and other movie stars in the 1960s. He was also an actor, playwright, model, producer, and director. At one point he lived on a commune; at another, he was a housefather to 14 deprived 11-year old kids in a Bronx home.\n\nWilliam Arthur Ballard died on December 14, 2021, in Daytona Beach, Florida, where he lived. Bill was a writer by profession, working primarily in advertising and public relations. He enjoyed tennis and his church. Bill is survived by his son, Bill ’74, and his daughters, Lynn and Jean.\n\n—John Adler, 75 Silo Circle, Riverside, CT 06878; (203) 622-9069; (203) 344-1584 (fax)\n\nUnfortunately, this column has no good news, as several class stalwarts have passed away.\n\nPaul Francis Woodberry died on October 15, 2021, in Sea Island, Georgia, where he lived. Paul had a successful corporate career, with senior positions at W.R. Grace and Allegheny Corp. among his accomplishments. With four children and 10 grandchildren attending Dartmouth, he undoubtedly holds the class record and maybe the College record for Big Green progeny. Paul was a good friend to many classmates, including me, and contributed frequently to this column. He is survived by children Seth ’81, Sturgis ’88, Sarah ’87, and Leslie.\n\nDouglas Thomson died on October 22, 2021, at his home in Savannah, Georgia. Doug, who was my predecessor as class secretary, spent 27 years with Uniroyal, ending up as president of the consumer division. He then served as president of the Toy Association in New York before retiring. Doug, 97, a fine golfer, shot his age regularly into his 90s. He leaves behind his wife, B.J. (Betty Jane), daughter Brooke, and son Alexander.\n\nMy close friend Thomas Hagen Towler died on December 13, 2021, in his retirement home in Sarasota, Florida. We saw each other regularly for almost 40 years, and I will miss him. Tom retired as CEO of both Top Value and S&H Green Stamps in the early 1980s, after spending his career as a top executive in several retail supplier businesses in a dozen communities around the country. In retirement, Tom served on the boards of New College and Sarasota Memorial Hospital. He is survived by children Ned, Jon, Bill, and Jill.\n\nRichard Wilson Hanselman died on October 1, 2021, in Nashville, Tennessee, where he lived. Dick spent his career as a prominent corporate executive at RCA, Samsonite, Beatrice Foods, and Genesco. Upon retiring as CEO of Genesco (footwear and accessories), he served as a director of 27 public and private companies, including Becton Dickinson, Equitable Life, and HCA. Dick is survived by his wife, Beverly, and daughter Jane.\n\nJoseph Tyrone Derry, a resident of Palm Harbor, Florida, died on August 27, 2021. Joe received his M.B.A. in industrial-labor relations from the University of Pennsylvania and then moved to Miami, where he had his own business. Nothing is known about his career or family.\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123, Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943 (fax)\n\nBill Bellows and his wife are still living in their home of 36 years in Feeding Hills in western Massachusetts. He had an information technology career, working and consulting for a variety of companies, including Aetna Insurance. After he retired Bill bought a motor home and lived way down upon the Suwannee River in Florida, among many other campgrounds, but stopped traveling several years ago. He occasionally talks to Ed Clogston, his college roommate.\n\nRichie Wolff checked in from the embattled city of Portland, Oregon. Covid stopped Beth and him from their perpetual traveling; their last trip was to Bali in 2019. Now they can’t even travel to Portland’s downtown Pearl District for safety reasons. However, Richie still manages to play tennis and golf on a weekly basis, so he keeps moving.\n\nThe 20th anniversary of 9/11 brought back memories of the ’49ers who were on a never-to-be-forgotten Dartmouth trip to Ireland. Bill Ballard and I still reminisce and remember our late classmates Punchy Thomas, Clarke Church, Bob Baum, and Burt Broom.\n\nI asked Ray Truncellito—who in those two-way days played guard on offense and linebacker on defense—what individual play he was involved with that stuck in his memory. In the 1947 Cornell game, he intercepted a pass and was tackled at the 6-yard line after a 60-yard run. Herb Carey ’50 scored on the next play and Dartmouth won by a touchdown.\n\nGeorge Day sounded energetic and thought he would overcome several weeks of pneumonia shortly (October 20) in his Minneapolis assisted living apartment. In a wheelchair with little vision, George is fortunate to have a grandson who reads to him regularly.\n\nJohn Chadwick Griffith died on August 11, 2021, in Quogue (on Long Island), New York, where he lived. John spent his career as a foreign service officer with the U.S. State Department, serving in Switzerland, India, Norway, and Washington, D.C. He retired to Quogue, where he held a municipal position for several years. John is survived by his wife, Jane, daughters Sandra and Ann, and son John Jr.\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123, Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943 (fax)\n\nThis column will start with a little fluff—Marshmallow Fluff. Don Durkee, who retired as CEO of Durkee-Mower Inc. a few years ago, lives in Marblehead, Massachusetts, and still plays golf regularly, although he is down to nine holes. Don’s son is the third generation to run the business, and two grandsons will continue the family tradition. Its primary market is the Northeast. I asked Don how a small food company could survive and prosper in today’s environment; he said a family business can thrive on lower margins than large companies will accept.\n\nBob Goetz is still living with his wife in a private home in Pittsboro, North Carolina, where he retired 26 years ago. Bob spent his career with Lederle Labs, owned by American Cyanamid when he arrived and now by Pfizer. Bob’s specialty was material management, overseeing pharmaceutical product production from beginning to end.\n\nBob Fitch is doing well in El Prado, New Mexico (eight miles from Taos). After Dartmouth Bob received his Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Michigan and joined DuPont as a research chemist. He switched to academia, teaching for five years at North Dakota State and 15 as a tenured professor (with a lab and postdocs), as well as consulting, at the University of Connecticut. S.C. Johnson, a client, enticed him to move to Racine, Wisconsin, where he waxed well, ultimately becoming senior vice president for research and development worldwide. After vacationing in New Mexico for years, Bob moved there full time when he retired so he could apply his polymers to his skis on a steadier basis and enjoy the majesty of New Mexico’s mountains.\n\nAfter making it to 98, Abraham Shalo died on July 18 in Pittsboro, North Carolina, where he retired after a 62-year career practicing estate and probate law in New York City. (Coincidentally, Abe’s retirement facility was across the way from Bob Goetz’s home, although they didn’t know each other.) Abe received his law degree from NYU. He achieved a lifetime goal by becoming chief counsel of the New York City Department of Investigation. He is survived by his wife, Roxana, and daughter Sibyl.\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123, Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943 (fax)\n\nPlaudits to piano-player par excellence Skip Unger, who recently retired after many years as the Forty-Niner newsletter editor. Skip told me his health was good but it was “just time for a change.” Maybe he ran out of limericks. In Skip’s honor, here’s my favorite from all-time limerick champ Ogden Nash.\n\n“There was a young man from Japan\n\nWhose limericks never would scan\n\nWhen asked why this was\n\nHe replied with a buzz\n\nBecause I always try to jam everything into\n\nthe last line that I possibly can.”\n\nSkip’s successor is the San Francisco foghorn—initials Q.K.—who likes to write as well as vocalize. Make his life easier by sending in your Green Cards.\n\nCharlie Russell called in from his townhouse opposite NASA headquarters in Houston, where he continues to live independently. Almost 96, Charlie still drives and has no major ailments. Charlie earned his master’s and Ph.D. from Columbia and spent his career teaching and administrating in smaller colleges and universities in New York, New England, and Texas.\n\nPaul Woodberry sent me an article from the Brunswick (Georgia) News about his great adventure during multiple missions on a B-26 bomber during the Korean War. That aspect of Paul’s life was the springboard for an illustrious business career.\n\nJoel Berson has relocated to Sarasota, Florida, from his 65-year residence in New York City. Battling Alzheimer’s disease, he is in the same assisted-living facility as Tom Towler, who is dealing with Parkinson’s.\n\nGeorge Willard Piper died on April 10 in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he was raised and where he returned after graduating from Dartmouth. George spent his career as a sales executive with Mueller Co., a Chattanooga-based manufacturer and distributor of fire hydrants, valves, and other water-related products. He is survived by four daughters and a son.\n\n—John Adler, 75 Silo Circle, Riverside, CT 06878; (203) 622-9069; (203) 637-3227 (fax)\n\nFor more than 30 years Bruce Crawford, Tom Towler, and I have been a seasonal triumvirate in Sarasota, Florida, getting together frequently. All our wives died, and our new partners continued our closeness. In recent years Joel Berson joined us on occasion. Bruce died last year, and Tom is battling Parkinson’s. When Joel visited in April, he hosted our sad but sweet final get-together of lifelong Dartmouth ’49er fellowship.\n\nDoug Thomson, my DAM predecessor, dropped me a note from his assisted living residence in Savannah, Georgia. Approaching 97, Doug says he’s finally beginning to feel old. Not too many years ago, he shot his age on the golf course.\n\nRay Truncellito reminisced about some of his football experiences. His New Jersey high school team stopped Vince Lombardi’s team’s 25-game winning streak. Johnny Dell Isola, one of Fordham’s “Seven Blocks of Granite” along with Lombardi, became line coach at Dartmouth in 1947. Ray said Dell Isola was the best coach he ever played for. After starring for the Big Green (Indians in those days), Ray and fellow ’49ers Jon Jenkins and Joe Sullivan played for the Eastern All Stars, who beat the New York Giants in a Fresh Air Fund exhibition game at Yankee Stadium. Jon went on to play tackle for the Baltimore Colts for two years and Joe became backfield coach at Georgetown.\n\nJohn Garner Gallup died on March 2. John, who lived in Longmeadow, Massachusetts, spent his career in the paper products business in nearby Springfield. After retiring as CEO of Strathmore Paper Co., he was active in a number of community organizations. John is survived by son Bruce and daughters Susan and Paula.\n\nPhilip Ward Goodspeed died on March 21 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he lived. Phil joined the family real estate management firm in his hometown not long after graduation. After fathering a daughter and five sons—including William ’80—all of whom survive him, Phil became active with Planned Parenthood. He noted and was proud of the irony.\n\n—John Adler, 75 Silo Circle, Riverside, CT 06878; (203) 622-9069; (203) 637-3227 (fax)\n\nAs our classmates struggle to retain their eyesight, hearing, balance, and memories, this column gets more difficult to fill. From what I can gather you’re not communicating with each other, although my offer to provide telephone numbers still stands. Disconnected numbers and “mailbox is full” responses don’t help. If you want current news in this column— other than obituaries—I need to hear from you.\n\nThe only respondent to my offer was Ed Clogston’s daughter, Ruth, who called to get George Day’s number. She told me Ed and Marge celebrated their 71st anniversary in an assisted living facility in Wilmington, Massachusetts. Ed, who is now legally blind, spent his career as a sales manager for Aetna Life Insurance.\n\nGeorge Day, also legally blind and confined to a wheelchair, lives in an assisted living residence in Minneapolis. George, who was an English professor at the University of Northern Iowa, still maintains his literary skills on a large-type computer.\n\nBill Ballard sounded as strong as ever at his home in Daytona Beach, Florida, but has lost almost all his vision. Bill spent most of his career in advertising. Along with the late Ed Graham, he would probably win the honors for class wit. Skip Unger also deserves a shoutout for his clever limericks and corny jokes in the class newsletter. (Like me, Skip needs to fill space.)\n\nRay Truncellito is thriving in his new digs in a Manchester, New Hampshire, assisted living facility. Of the dozen or so still-breathing classmates I have spoken to during the past year, our prez appears to be the healthiest and, consequently, the cheeriest. Besides football and other Dartmouth stories, we briefly discussed the distant star of a 75th reunion in 2024.\n\nCurtis Lee Smith Jr. died in Sarasota, Florida, on November 3, 2020. Lee, originally from Cleveland, was CEO of National Copper and Smelting, founded by his grandfather a century ago. After the company was sold in 1983, Lee headed a consulting firm. At some point he moved to Sarasota, but neither Tom Towler, the late Bruce Crawford, nor I knew he was here or we would have tried to attract him to the local Dartmouth club, in which Bruce played a prominent role. Lee is survived by four sons.\n\n—John Adler, 75 Silo Circle, Riverside, CT 06878; (203) 622-9069; (203) 637-3227 (fax)\n\nI’m going into my 11th year as class secretary, which is more than twice as long as any of my predecessors. As the class ages, this job gets tougher. If you can, I need you guys to call or write to bring your classmates up to date.\n\nEd “Nick” Nickerson lives in a retirement home in Salisbury, Connecticut. At 95, he still walks without a cane. Nick retired as an English professor at the University of Delaware, where undergraduate Joe Biden preceded him. Nick asked a fellow prof what he thought of Biden. Answer: “He was the nicest guy I ever gave a C (grade) to.” Ed MacBurney is doing well in an assisted living home in Bettendorf, Iowa. Ed retired as the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Quincy, Illinois. (Quincy and Bettendorf are both part of the “Quad Cities.”) Bob Weber is happily married and still traveling when he can (Covid-19 permitting). Bob lives in Santa Barbara, California, and fortunately escaped the terrible wildfires in the area.\n\nI caught up with Dick Hook in Denmark, Maine, in the middle of a blizzard. He likes really cold weather, a contrast to the climate in Kenya, Uganda, Indonesia, and other warm places where he consulted on microfinance for the Harvard Institute for International Development. Dick oversaw loans of $15 to $1,000, with a better than 95-percent repayment rate. He’s happy and in good health. Frederick Smith Jr. died on November 10, 2020, in Laconia, New Hampshire, where he lived. Entering Dartmouth at 15, Fred was the youngest member of our class. He earned a law degree from Cornell and a master’s in public administration from Harvard. Fred spent a 31-year career with the U.S. State Department in a variety of assignments around the world. After retiring at 70, Fred moved to New Hampton, New Hampshire, and worked as a consultant, helping negotiate treaties, among other projects. Fred is survived by his wife, Jane; daughters Allison and Tory; son Adam; and four stepchildren.\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123, Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943 (fax)\n\nPeriodically, I get asked how many ’49ers are still around. As of last October, we had 107 on the College roster, 18 of whom had no interest in the class. Considering our bastardized make-up, that’s not surprising; here’s some background.\n\nOur original 1945 wartime freshman class included three groups, totaling 389: 49 in March; 221 in July; and 119 in November. Our average age was 17 years and nine months; 24 freshmen were only 16.\n\nAt Dartmouth’s 180th graduation in 1949, we had about 650 classmates. Only about 150 had gone through their college years uninterrupted by military service or dropping out. (Actually, 64 of us received bachelor’s degrees in 1948.) Members of earlier classes whose attendance was affected by Uncle Sam, plus V-12s and others assigned by the College, constituted a significant portion of our class.\n\nSo if any of you want to contact your friends in the class, let me know by phone, fax, or snail mail. (As a renowned history professor wrote me recently, “I commend you for not using email. It means you do not waste half your day answering unwanted messages.”)\n\nPaul Woodberry holds the class (and maybe College) record for breeding green with two sons, two daughters, and six grandchildren graduating from Dartmouth; four grandsons are current undergraduates. That doesn’t include two brothers and five in-laws and cousins. Paul keeps track from his home in Sea Island, Georgia.\n\nDale Jacobson is one of the few ’49ers (I’m aware of) who is still driving. Dale had his sights set on our last reunion, but his wife’s failing health (and subsequent death this year) prevented that. He maintains his condo in northern Westchester County, New York, close to where he grew up, and sounds chipper.\n\nGeorge Adam Soufleris died on September 4, 2020, in Syracuse, New York, near Jamesville, where he lived. After selling shoes for five years George attended University of Vermont Medical School and became an obstetrician-gynecologist. He spent his career helping women at hospitals and medical centers in the greater Syracuse area. George is survived by his wife, Rita, and sons Mark, Philip, and Peter.\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123, Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943 (fax)\n\nIn what passes for good news, classmates whom I spoke to recently are all keeping their heads above water: Ray Truncellito and Tom Towler are in assisted living, while Deke Jackson, Richie Wolff, new bridegroom Skip Ungar, and Joel Berson are still thriving (almost) independently. Sadly, two of my closest friends in the class—Bruce Crawford and Slade Gorton—unexpectedly passed away not long after I had lengthy chats with each of them. Together with Tommy Swartz and Jay Urstadt, that is four good pals lost since our 70th reunion last year.\n\nBruce Boyd Crawford died on July 27 in Sarasota, Florida, where he lived. Bruce managed the 1948 Dartmouth football team which won all but two games and featured ’49s Ray Truncellito and the late Joe Sullivan, Jon Jenkins, and Carll Tracy. After graduating from Tuck Bruce spent his career with State Mutual Life Insurance Co. (Massachusetts), retiring as VP of marketing and sales. He moved to Sarasota in 1989 and was very active in the local Dartmouth club. Bruce, Tom Towler, and I have been a close triumvirate ever since. He is survived by his partner, Joan Sheil, sons Dana, Keith, and Scott, and daughter Carolyn.\n\nThomas Slade Gorton III died on August 19 in Clyde Hill, Washington, where he lived. Slade received his law degree from Columbia, served five terms in the Washington State Legislature, 12 years as the state’s attorney general, and three terms as a U.S. senator. Later Slade served on the 9/11 Commission and wrote most of its report. Unquestionably Slade, a moderate Republican, was the leading political light in our class. He holds another travel record, bicycling 3,300 miles with his family from Olympia, Washington, to Hanover and then Boston in 1973. Slade is survived by son Thomas and daughters Sarah and Rebecca.\n\nMatthew Clark Fenton III died on April 28 in Lutherville, Maryland, where he lived. After Dartmouth Matt served five years as a Marine Corps pilot, then spent his career with his family-owned Cadillac-Jaguar company, retiring as president. He flew his own planes as a hobby and was deeply involved in Dartmouth alumni activities. Matt leaves his wife, Mary Louise (“Pud”), son Matthew, and daughter Sally.\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123, Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943 (fax)\n\nWell, coronavirus has drastically changed the way our class lives, particularly those in retirement homes. No visitors, two at a time in an elevator, meals delivered to rooms, etc. Class prez Ray Truncellito had half his belongings moved into his future assisted living residence when the new rules stopped him cold; in late June he is still in his home in Manchester, New Hampshire. My own snowbird wings got clipped after 38 years, so I’m stuck in Sarasota, Florida, until next April.\n\nFred F. Tilden died on February 16 at his home in Hartford, Connecticut. Fred spent his career in business, retiring as chairman of Venus-Estabrook Ltd., England. He is survived by his wife, Barbara, sons Fred Jr. and Peter, and daughter Cynthia.\n\nBurgess Preston Standley died on March 12 at his home in Medfield, Massachusetts. Mike advised universities on design and construction of new science facilities, then spent 22 years as director of planning at Mass General Hospital in Boston. He was deeply involved in all kinds of civic activities in Medfield. He leaves his wife, Caroline, son Dabney ’83, and daughters Caroline and Anne.\n\nGlenn Mohrman died on May 1 in Princeton, New Jersey, where he lived. Glenn, who had a law degree from the University of Virginia, spent his career in advertising and market research, specializing in pretesting pharmaceutical company ads. He is survived by his wife, Waltraud (“Trudy”), sons Brooks and Mace, and daughters Darby and Morgan.\n\nRussell Wolfertz Sr. died on November 25, 2018, in Rockland, Maine, where he lived, the College has recently learned. Russ’s career was in real estate. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth, two sons and four daughters.\n\nAlan S. Harvey died on January 15, 2015, in Manchester, New Hampshire, the College has recently learned. Alan had several occupations—professional actor, teacher, writer, and antique store owner. He left no survivors.\n\nJohn W. Whelden died on August 26, 2014, probably in Framingham, Massachusetts, where he lived, the College has recently learned. John was a component engineer with Raytheon. Apparently, he had no survivors.\n\nRichard A. Eckhart died on December 5, 1998, the College has recently learned. Dick, a Navy V-12, spent his career as a geologist with Sun Oil.\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123, Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943, fax\n\nRichie Wolff checked in from his senior living residence in Portland, Oregon, to let me know his brother, John ’46, had died. Richie and Beth returned from Bali in December on probably their last international excursion.\n\nSlade Gorton lives in the adjacent town to Kirkland, Washington, where coronavirus was initially reported. He’s locked down but still telecommutes for his law firm in Washington, D.C.\n\nGeorge Day wrote from his assisted living apartment in Minneapolis, probably using a Braille keyboard. We share a common interest in the Civil War. George really regrets not being able to make our 70th reunion.\n\nOur class lost one of its most prominent members—and I lost a close friend—when Charles J. Urstadt died on March 2 at his home in Bronxville, New York. Jay co-captained the Dartmouth swimming team (with San Francisco’s Deke Jackson) and set several world breaststroke age-group records into his 80s. Jay served as Gov. Nelson Rockefeller’s state commissioner for housing and urban renewal, and he built the acclaimed Battery Park City on 92 acres of filled land along the Hudson River. For the last 30 years Jay was CEO of a NYSE company that operates 82 shopping centers. He is survived by his wife, Elinor, daughter Catherine, and son Charles.\n\nThe College sent me an obituary for Russell G. Hemenway, six years after he died at his home in New York City on January 30, 2014. In contrast to Jay, who was a major Republican Party supporter and well acquainted with Fred Trump and his son (whom he called “Donny” prior to his current job), Russ apparently was the most progressive liberal in our rather conservative class. Quoting from his obituary, Russ was “a true warrior spirit in American politics, combatting the radical right from the days of Joe McCarthy to the extemporary influence of extreme conservatism.” Russ served as national director for National Committee for an Effective Congress (founded in 1948 by Eleanor Roosevelt) for 48 years and “was considered the father of campaign finance disclosure reform in the early 1970s.” Russ was survived by his daughter, Anne, and his son, Brent.\n\n—John Adler, 75 Silo Circle, Riverside, CT 06878; (203) 622-9069; (203) 637-3227, fax\n\nBruce Crawford, Tom Towler, and I get together frequently in Sarasota, Florida, and Joel Berson joined us twice to get away from New York’s weather. Other than that, not much current news, but the obituaries are piling up.\n\nAllen Clarke Church died on March 2, 2019, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where he lived. Clarke spent his entire 42-year career with Procter & Gamble, working in 55 countries; his last title was VP for sales for Canada and Latin America. Clarke and his wife, Jane, were especially helpful to my late wife, Vi, on our Dartmouth trip to Ireland (9/11 time), when Bill Ballard, Punchy Thomas, Bob Baum, and Burt Proom were fellow companions. Besides Jane, Clarke leaves sons Allen ’76, Ken ’80, Tom, and Steve.\n\nRobert Joseph Amirault died on October 8, 2019, in Dunnellon, Florida, where he lived. Bob was a pitcher on the 1948 Ivy League champion baseball team, along with the late Al Quirk, and also lettered in football and hockey. He spent his career with IBM. Bob is survived by his wife, Mary Louise, and son Alan.\n\nLoomis Grosvenor Dana died on October 8, 2019, at his home in South Burlington, Vermont. Loo served with various civic organizations in Vermont: YMCAs, a park and recreation department, and local council on aging. He is survived by sons Gregory and Richard and daughter Christine.\n\nEdward Hayes Grant died on November 28, 2019, at his home in Osterville, Massachusetts. Ed was president of his eponymous company, a manufacturing agent. He enjoyed year-round golf on Cape Cod. Ed is survived by his wife, Carol, son John, and daughters Leigh and Katherine.\n\nCarl Victor Granger died on December 29, 2019, in Amherst, New York, near where he lived. Carl received his M.D. from NYU and taught at Yale, Tufts, and Brown before becoming chairman of the department of rehabilitative medicine at the University of Buffalo. He received several national honor awards for developing a uniform data system for measuring medical rehabilitation, used by Medicare, Medicaid, and internationally. As his obituary noted, Carl was the son (his father was a 1918) and grandson of black physicians. He is survived by daughter Marilyn and son Glenn.\n\n—John Adler, 75 Silo Circle, Riverside, CT 06878; (203) 622-9069; (203) 637-3227 (fax)\n\nBob “Deke” Jackson checked in from Mt. Dora, Florida, regretting that he couldn’t travel to reunion. However, he and his wife, Nadine, are still “staying out of hospitals and nursing homes,” so he figures he’s ahead of the game. Deke thoughtfully sent me the following obituary of our honorary classmate.\n\nThaddeus Seymour Sr. died on October 26, 2019, in Winter Park, Florida, where he lived. Thad, who was of our vintage, came to Dartmouth as an English professor in 1954 and began a 10-year run as dean in 1959. He left Hanover in 1969 to become president of Wabash College in Indiana. In 1979 he became president of Rollins College in Winter Park, rejuvenating it through the next decade until he retired. Thad is survived by his wife, Polly, two sons, and two daughters.\n\nThomas Jefferson Swartz Jr. died unexpectedly at home in Chatham, New Jersey, on October 18, 2019. Just three weeks earlier Tommy was celebrating with me and a dozen other classmates at our 70th reunion. He stopped to visit Jay Urstadt on the way home, and I had expected to see him at a lecture in neighboring Morristown two days after he passed away. What a shock! Tommy spent his career at Thomas Textile Inc., a family manufacturer of infant and toddler textiles, retiring as president. He is survived by sons Tom III ’76 (who was with him at reunion), Gary, and Craig. Skip Ungar represented the class at his memorial service.\n\nWalter Jan de Hoog died on March 16, 2016, probably in Santa Barbara, California, where he lived since 2000. Born in Holland and educated in Italy, Walter entered Dartmouth in 1946 as one of only two foreign-born students in our class. (Christian Bugge, Norway, was the other.) Walter spent most of his career making film documentaries. However, he will be especially remembered for Tulipano, his book detailing his harrowing 1944 escape from the Gestapo in Italy by jumping off a death train bound for the Mauthausen concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Austria. (Read the gripping extract that appeared in the July-August 2013 issue of DAM at dartmouthalumnimagazine.com/articles/train-doom.)\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123, Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943 (fax)\n\nFourteen of us made it back to Hanover for our 70th reunion: Joel Berson, Mike Gish, Slade Gorton, Quent Kopp, Joe LeBlanc, Bob Rooke, Jim Smith, Tom Swartz, Ray Truncellito, Skip Ungar, Richie Wolff, Paul Woodberry, Jim Zafris, and yours truly. We were treated to sunny, 75-degree weather, great hospitality by the College in a totally renovated ($500 a night) Hanover Inn, and a 38-3 romp over Colgate. Ray, Skip, and I were re-elected at the class meeting as president, newsletter editor, and secretary, respectively. Merry widows (self-described) Beth Griffiths, Anne Hartmann, Margo Nutt, and Barbara Rosenfield also enhanced the occasion.\n\nSkip, who remarkably can still remember his full repertoire of songs and play them as well as ever, entertained us again—with more than his music. An archaeology professor lectured on the deep dig of an old privy currently taking place on the left corner of the Green opposite the inn. Any questions? Skip’s “Did you find my watch?” brought down the house of 200.\n\nJoe LeBlanc made his first reunion in 20 years. Joe left Dartmouth after two terms, spent four years in the Navy, and graduated later. His 39-year career as a private school teacher and administrator in Kansas City, Missouri, ended when he retired in 2007.\n\nOut of the blue, Jim Mytton sent me 52 years of DAM Class Notes columns, beginning in 1967 and covering 10 class secretaries before me: Tommy Swartz, Punchy Thomas, Paul Woodberry, Charley Schuetz, Vail Haak, Quent Kopp, Bruce Crawford, Bob Nutt, Doug Thompson, and Dean Merrill. Stay tuned for more from me and Skip Ungar.\n\nRobert Baum died on September 22, 2019, in New York City, where he lived. Bob, who expected to attend our reunion, was president and owner of US Packaging and Design. He enjoyed sailing at his second home in Stonington, Connecticut. Bob is survived by his son, Eric.\n\nRichard H. Kamm died on June 12, 2019, in Rome, Italy, where he lived. Richard, a professional artist, has two sculptures in the Hood Museum. He had no survivors.\n\nAlfred Burke Sullivan died on August 25, 2019, in San Marcos, Texas, where he lived. Al was known as the “Ivy League Cowboy” who nixed Harvard Law School to become a Navy Fly Boy for 20 years. Later, he earned his doctorate at the University of Utah and taught political science at Texas State University. Al is survived by his wife, Macel, son Edward, and daughter Susan.\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123, Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943 (fax)\n\nSo you guys think you’re old? I received a letter and San Francisco Chronicle clipping from George Shimizu, class secretary for 1943 at a sprightly 99. “Former State Sen. Quentin Kopp—the contrarian foghorn of the Sunset—is back in the political game, having taken out papers to run against state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat. ‘That’s right, I have filed to run against ‘Wienis,’ Kopp said. ‘This guy is bad news from top to bottom.’ To which Wiener retorted: …‘As for his juvenile nickname for me, if that makes him feel good, then he should have at it.’ ” Quent left the senate in 1998 to become a judge and retired in 2004. Go, Quent!\n\nBob Rooke is still active in his financial management business at 94. Although he lives in Morristown, New Jersey, he spends his summers near a New Hampshire lake, with a relatively short drive to reunion.\n\nRoger Borregard died on March 9 in Port Saint Lucie, Florida, where he lived. He is survived by his sons, Chris and Robert.\n\nWhile our current classmates are hanging in—Roger’s is the only reported death in several months—the College sent me three obituaries that go back almost a decade and which it just learned about.\n\nGilbert Merrill Campbell III died on November 12, 2010, in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts, where he lived. Gil was a self-employed CPA for more than 30 years. He was survived by his children, Carol and Craig.\n\nGeorge Guilford Eaves died on October 14, 2010, in Signal Mountain, Tennessee (near Chattanooga), where he lived. George operated the Eaves Badge and Emblem Co. for 30 years, then went into the real estate business. He is survived by his wife, Mildred, and sons Baxter and George Jr.\n\nJohn E. Robinson died on October 29, 2011, in Portland, Maine, where he lived. John spent his career as a CPA with Ernst & Young. He was survived by his daughters, Didi and Wendy.\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123, Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943 (fax)\n\nWith our 70th reunion a month away (September 27-29), ’49ers have to tell the College if they intend to be there. Alphabetically, I lead the list and will celebrate my 92nd birthday with Bob Baum, Bill Bellows, Joel Berson, Bob Fitch, Peter Gish, Slade Gorton, Ed Grant, Dale Jacobson, Joe LeBlanc, Bob Rooke, Jim Smith, Tommy Swartz, Doug Thompson, Ray Truncellito, Skip Ungar, Paul Woodberry, Jim Zafris, and, I hope, a few more of you. Jim Mytton and Nick Sheppard are maybe’s.\n\nCheers! For the first time in the 10 years I’ve been writing this column, all our classmates remain on this side of the grass.\n\nAfter Joel Berson, Tommy Swartz, and I attended Jay Urstadt’s 90th celebration last October, I wrote that Jay was our youngest classmate. Then, Skip Ungar, with a January birthday, replaced him. Bill Ballard read that and called to say he thought Fred Smith deserved the youthful honors, which Fred confirmed. He was only 15 when he entered with us 49ers in March 1945 and didn’t turn 16 until the end of June 1945.\n\nFred spent his career with the U.S. State Department in a variety of assignments around the world, including writing a 600-page legal treatise still used for guidance. After retiring at 70 and moving to New Hampton, New Hampshire, he worked until three years ago as a consultant helping negotiate treaties, among other projects. Unfortunately, Fred’s poor health will keep him from reunion.\n\nGeorge Day has moved from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to an assisted living home near his daughter in Minneapolis. He spent most of his academic career as an English professor at the University of Northern Iowa. George has been a regular at class reunions, but isn’t sure if his mobility and vision problems will allow him to make it to Hanover. Keep trying, George!\n\nLou Harris is still going strong in White Bear Lake, Minnesota (near St. Paul). Retired from practicing law with a specialty in ground transportation, Lou keeps busy with book club and church activities.\n\n—John Adler, 75 Silo Circle, Riverside, CT 06878; (203) 622-9069; (203) 637-3227 (fax)\n\nRichie Wolff called from his new digs in a retirement home near Portland, Oregon. He referred me to a picture of his father on the 1908 tennis team in a recent issue of DAM. He and Beth are still traveling and have our 70th reunion on their agenda, September 27-29.\n\nTommy Swartz made his annual trip to Sarasota, Florida, to visit his son. We all had a fun dinner with Tom Towler and Bruce Crawford. Joel Berson joined our group on a separate occasion. Both Tommy and Joel will be at our reunion.\n\nEdward Ralph Graham Jr. died on September 20, 2018, in Evanston, Illinois, where he lived. Ed spent his career as a writer, producer, cartoonist, and humorist with Time, Sports Illustrated, CBS, and ABC, among other media. His biggest hit was Linus the Lionhearted cartoon show. Ed is survived by his wife, Claire, and children Sarah, Ted, and Scott.\n\nGeorge Paul Denecke died on December 10, 2016, in Minneapolis, where he lived. Paul spent 45 years in the carpet business in Minneapolis. He is survived by son Daniel and daughter Heide.\n\nRonald C. Honeyman died on February 16 in Bellevue, Washington, where he lived. Ron went off to the Army, then finished college out West. Ron spent his career in the hardware business in Portland, Washington, where he grew up. He is survived by children Jane, Craig, and Jeff.\n\n—John Adler, 75 Silo Circle, Riverside, CT 06878; (203) 622-9069; (203) 637-3227 (fax)\n\nDid you note the astounding miracle in your class dues notice that arrived in February? “I am writing to you as your class president,” wrote George Hartmann from heaven, where he took up residence about a year ago. Ray Truncellito (George’s successor), please take note!\n\nFlashback: Our original class had 271 members in 1945. Their average age was 17 years and 9 months, with 24 only 16 years old when they matriculated. Today’s “baby” is our dedicated newsletter scribe, Skip Unger, who turned 90 this past January. (Correction: Jay Urstadt, who got the appellation in my last column, is demoted to second-youngest.) No wonder Skip has so much energy playing music in retirement communities.\n\nWith our 70th reunion just five months away, on September 27-29, Paul Woodberry and Quent Kopp have joined the list of probably attendees. Paul checked in from his home in Sea Island, Georgia, and says he’s feeling good. He’s in touch with Ed Clogston, who won’t make it to Hanover because of severe eye problems.\n\nQuent entertained me and my companion Olha at a pleasant lunch in San Francisco. He’s still actively involved in civic ventures such as an ethics committee and the local Korean War memorial, and relieved that the bullet train, which he sponsored almost 30 years ago, has been mostly aborted because of horrific political mismanagement in the interim.\n\nHenry Leo Gutman died on November 12, 2018, in Baltimore, where he lived. Hank lettered in lacrosse at Dartmouth and spent most of his career at Broger-Gutman, his family’s department store. He is survived by his wife, Babette, daughter Carol, and son Ned.\n\nHerman E. Muller Jr. died on February 10 in New York City, where he lived. “Skip” graduated from Ithaca College, where he chaired the board for many years, but always considered himself a loyal ’49er. He was a certified professional accountant by profession, but also was an inveterate musician, playing the upright bass in Greenwich Village for 50 years. Skip served on many boards, including the National Endowment for the Arts. He is survived by his wife, Evelyn.\n\n—John Adler, 75 Silo Circle, Riverside, CT 06878; (203) 622-9069; (203) 637-3227 (fax)\n\nOn October 27 Jay Urstadt, the “baby” of our class, celebrated his 90th birthday with a festive luncheon at his local golf club in Bronxville, New York, where he lives. Tommy Swartz, Joel Berson, and I were happy to share the occasion with Ellie and about 100 of his family and friends. Jay still actively chairs his eponymous NYSE real estate company, which owns 83 shopping centers in the Northeast. Mention was made of his two 70-plus-age group world championship swimming titles. Slade Gorton is perhaps the only other member of our class still drawing a regular paycheck in his “of counsel” role with law firm K&L Gates. He travels from Seattle to D.C. twice a month. Slade, Jay, Tommy, Joel, and I are all planning to enjoy our 70th reunion September 27-29. We hope to see many of you there. It’s only five months away, so put it on your calendars.\n\nWarren George Povey died nine years ago on April 3, 2010, probably in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where he was a clinical professor in the department of global health at the University of British Columbia. Warren was supposed to be my second-term freshman roommate in July 1945, but went into the service and never returned. He graduated from the University of Washington and received his M.D. from the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nWith news and obituaries (fortunately) scarce at the moment, here’s a nugget (for ’49ers!) from the autobiography of Chauncey Depew, a 19th-century American politician whom I researched in connection with my forthcoming biography of political cartoonist Thomas Nast. Depew met Queen Victoria on occasion, and hobnobbed with her son, the future King Edward VII. In the 1890s Victoria entertained Queen Liliuokalani of Hawaii at Windsor Castle. At dinner, the visitor said: “Your majesty, I am a blood relative of yours. “How so?” asked the astonished Victoria. “Why,” said Liliuokalani, “my grandfather ate your Captain Cook.” (Note for non-historians: Captain James Cook was killed in Hawaii in 1779.)\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123, Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943 (fax)\n\nIt looks as though 134 classmates are still with us as of late October 2018; however, 20 are listed as “not interested.” Let’s hope several dozen of us make it to our 70th reunion on September 27-29. Dale Jacobson expects to be there, despite having a triple bypass and subsequent infection two years ago. After a long career with Exxon, Dale lives in a condo in Somers, New York, and sounds as though he’s in good spirits and better health now.\n\nGeorge Day is battling macular degeneration while living at home with his wife, Clara, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. George is planning to make it to Hanover with his usual grit and a big smile. Bill Ballard also has severe eye problems, with glaucoma, so reading and travel are problematic. Bill is doing reasonably well, along with his partner, Edie, in Daytona Beach, Florida. His wit and humor remain as sharp as ever, burnished by his many years in advertising and designing crossword puzzles.\n\nEugene Raymond Kelly died on September 19, 2017, in Boynton Beach, Florida, where he lived. Gene spent most of his career practicing internal medicine and cardiology in Westfield, New Jersey. After Dartmouth he studied at five universities—Penn, George Washington, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, and Duke—which must be a class record for a nonacademic. Gene is survived by a daughter and three sons, including Dr. Christopher Kelly ’88.\n\nFrank Elliot Bateman died on July 17, 2018, near Fitzwilliam, New Hampshire, where he lived. After receiving his M.B.A. from Tuck, Frank ran his family department store in Lexington, Massachusetts. When mall competition prevailed, he operated an interior design firm. He moved to New Hampshire in 1970, and renovated several churches. Frank is survived by his wife, Dorothy, four daughters, and a son.\n\nRobert William Belfit Jr. died on August 29, 2018, near Midland, Michigan, where he lived.

Quent Kopp was looking forward to celebrating his 90th birthday with a large family reunion in Yosemite, but Mother Nature and the fires changed his plans.\n\nRobert Ellinwood Alden died on June 25 in Stamford, Connecticut, where he lived. Bob was always a class leader, serving as president and on the executive committee for many years. Bob spent 45 years as director of sales development at WOR Radio in New York City.

Put it on your calendars and stay heathy enough to be there for what will probably be our last roundup. Class president Ray Truncellito is our fearless leader. Dartmouth plays Colgate.\n\nRaymond Joseph Rasenberger died on April 3 in Washington, D.C., where he lived. Ray was class valedictorian and president of the Undergraduate Council and held major Dartmouth alumni leadership positions. He received his law degree from George Washington University, specialized in aviation law at his own firm, worked on political campaigns for Jack and Bobby Kennedy and Edmund Muskie, and became an accomplished self-published poet. Ray leaves his wife, Nancy, son James ’86, and four daughters.\n\nRobert Jay Evans died on April 20 in Concord, New Hampshire, where he lived.

Both of them are moving a little slower than during their visits last year, but retain their good spirits.\n\nClass president George H. Hartmann died on February 20 at his home in Hanover. George, a Thayer graduate, had an impressive career with General Electric (25 years), International Paper, and Textron, while serving the College and the class for the past 30 years. He was a passionate Transatlantic sailor. George is survived by his wife, Anne, sons Michael ’83 and Steven ’85, and daughters Elizabeth ’91 and Katherine.\n\nRay Truncellito, who preceded George as class president, will resume that role. I will stay on as secretary (and, unhappily, as “obituarian”), and faithful Skip Unger will keep writing limericks and the class newsletter in between his musical stints at retirement homes in northern New Jersey.\n\nPaul R. Bjorkland died on March 13 in Ashland, Virginia, where he lived. Paul received his D.D.S. from Columbia, and practiced dentistry in Centerport, New York. Paul was head agent for the class for 22 years, probably raising more contributions for the College than any other ’49er. He is survived by son Paul Jr. ’75 and daughter Kristin ’77.\n\nEdward H. Leede died on February 24 in Denver, where he lived. Eddie’s name is synonymous with Dartmouth basketball, and survives him on Leede Arena. His career record of 1,331 points lasted more than two decades. After playing two seasons with Bob Cousy on the Boston Celtics, Ed received his M.B.A. from Harvard and moved to Midland, Texas, where he hit it big in the oil business. Ed played a major role in the Campaign for Dartmouth, endowed a professorship, and served on the Dartmouth Athletic Council.

He still plays tennis and golf and takes two or three excursions a year with Beth. Most recently, he returned from an Oceania trip that involved stops in Peru and Easter and Pitcairn Islands. (Unlike the Bounty, Beth kept him in line, and he didn’t mutiny.) Richie has good genes; brother John ’46, 93, who writes the 1946 DAM column, still practices medicine and monitors Richie’s health.\n\nI chatted briefly with Paul Bjorkland. Our all-star class agent emeritus is fighting a tough battle with chronic leukemia. Paul keeps in touch with former roommates Ed Graham and Dick Hook and sends a wah-hoo-wah to the rest of his classmates.\n\nJohn Frederick Goodrich died on September 21, 2017, near Littleton, New Hampshire, where he lived. John spent his career with the Social Security Administration. He is survived by three sons and two daughters.\n\nJohn Bernard Daukas died on November 19, 2017, five days shy of his 90th birthday. A serious football injury kept John from following his brothers into professional football.

He leaves his wife, Patricia, three sons, a daughter and three stepdaughters.\n\nJohn Gately died on January 16, 2016. John, who lived in Huntington Beach, California, was a process-quality engineer. He is survived by his wife, Bernadette, four sons and a daughter.\n\nAs I submit this column, I have learned class president George Hartmann died on February 21. Talk about a shock. I had plans to meet George and Anne in Sarasota, Florida, in early March. More in the next issue.\n\n—John Adler, 75 Silo Circle, Riverside, CT 06878; (203) 622-9069; (203) 637-3227 (fax)\n\nAs our class youngsters (who matriculated at age 16) enter their 10th decade, there are still 125 of us on this side of the grass. I hope that will lead to a good turnout at our 70th Reunion next year.\n\nPaul Woodberry reported that he had a nice chat with Ed Clogston: “After Ed retired from his insurance company, he moved to Vermont, where he eventually became the oldest ski instructor in the state. Ed, Jay Evans and I enjoyed skiing together many times at Sunapee, New Hampshire.” Ed now lives in Wilmington, Massachusetts.\n\nRalph Greenhouse died on February 20, 2017, in Alexandria, Virginia, where he lived. Ralph received his Ph.D. from Columbia in cultural anthropology, and spent 26 years with the U.S. Information Agency’s office of research and intelligence. Upon retiring he became a professional cellist, playing at Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center. Ralph is survived by sons Mark and William.\n\nWillard Dean Merrill died on October 12, 2017, at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. After graduation Dean spent 21 years as a Marine Corps officer, retiring as a lieutenant colonel. During the Cuban missile crisis he served under the joint chiefs of staff. In 1968 Dean moved to Woodstock, Vermont, where he managed the new Woodstock Inn and other properties for Laurance Rockefeller’s Rock Resorts. He established Felicity Farm as a home and a business for raising Angus cattle. In recent years Dean played a leading role in our class activities and was my predecessor as secretary. He is survived by his son Frederic and daughters Janet and Laurel.\n\nAlfred Thomas Quirk also died on October 12, 2017, at his home in Hanover. Al was a three-year star pitcher on the baseball team, which captured the 1948 Eastern Intercollegiate Championship. He was the face of Dartmouth’s admissions office from 1963 to 1995, becoming director in 1979 and dean in 1982, while overseeing the entrance of 28,000 students and Dartmouth’s first women in 1972. Some of our classmates were happy with Al’s selections; others, disappointed legacy fathers, not so much. In retirement, Al became a fine artist. He leaves his daughters, Judith and Louise.\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123 Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943 (fax)\n\nFlashback! Dartmouth Forty-niners originally numbered 389: 49 matriculated in March, 1945; 221 in July and 119 in November. Total civilian enrollment in November was 680, so we comprised 57 percent of the College; 958 Navy ROTC V-12s and V5s dominated the campus; our average age was 17 years and nine months, and 24 of us were only 16. How times change!\n\nBill Ballard checked in from Daytona Beach, Florida, recounting memories from our Dartmouth trip to Ireland with about seven other classmates during which 9/11 occurred. My late wife, Vi, and I and Bill and his late wife, Nomi, journeyed on afterward to a London devoid of Americans. He remembered a lively discussion with the late Burt Proom over his choice of dinner wine, and credits his daily three glasses of vino for keeping him healthy now. Take notice!\n\nPaul Woodberry called to talk about the late John Stearns. Paul remembers “Bull Moose” refereeing a campus tug-of-war between the ’49s and ’50s when he almost swallowed his whistle and needed medical aid to retrieve it. Unlike the seven dwarfs, John stopped whistling when he worked.\n\nCurtis Reed Parke Jr. died on May 11, 2017, in Glenview, Illinois, where he lived. Reed, a lawyer, spent his career as an executive with the Chicago investment firm of Duff Anderson & Clark Inc. A musician, he belonged to the Handel Society and Marching Band at Dartmouth and the music group at his church. Reed is survived by sons David and Mark and daughter Mary.\n\nRobert Donald Hill died on August 22, 2017, in Sleepy Hollow, New York, where he lived. At Dartmouth Bob managed both the tennis and the all-star hockey team featuring classmates Dick Desmond, Joe Riley and Jack Kilmartin. Bob spent his career at his family real estate business in Riverdale, New York. His principal hobby was curling, possibly unique for the class. Bob is survived by daughters Cynthia, Susan and Elizabeth.\n\nStafford Warwick Keegin II died on September 4, 2017, in Holland, Michigan, where he lived. Staff spent his career in sales for PPG Industries. He is survived by his wife, Margaret, and sons David and John.\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123, Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943 (fax)\n\nRussell Wolfertz Sr. called from his home in Owls Head, Maine, to reminisce about his days living in Wigwam Circle and selling sandwiches in Topliff, Fayerweather and other dorms to keep bread on his own table.\n\nAlready married in 1946 after four years in the Coast Guard, Russ’s Dartmouth experience was different from most of ours. After spending a decade with Sears, Russ ran his own successful real estate business in Rockland, Maine. He greatly enjoyed a recent trip to the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C., which brought back memories and occasioned his call.\n\nSlade Gorton is still practicing law as counsel to K&L Gates. He goes back to Washington, D.C., monthly and continues to serve on several nonprofit boards and dabble in Washington State politics.\n\nRay Truncellito celebrated his 65th anniversary with a score of direct descendants. One grandson is a dancer in a Broadway show, evidently inheriting Ray’s quick feet, which were honed playing guard for the Indians (not the Big Green then) and working out with the New York Giants. As a veteran, Ray was honored from the stage and relaxed with the cast afterwards.\n\nDean Cowell Cameron died on June 20 in Evanston, Illinois, where he lived. Dean graduated from Harvard Law School, worked as an advisor to the U.S. tax court in Washington, D.C., and then practiced tax law in Chicago until he retired. He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and daughters Amy and Elizabeth.\n\nJohn “Bull Moose” Phillips Stearns died on August 16 in New London (New Hampshire) Hospital. John was the quintessential Dartmouth man, both as an undergraduate, when he edited The Dartmouth among many other activities, and as an extremely active alumnus. He graduated from Harvard Law School, spent time as a lawyer and investment banker and retired as a vice president of American Express in 1988, when he moved to Hanover. John was named Class President of the Year in 1999, was honored with the Dartmouth Alumni Award in 2004 and coordinated our class reunions for decades.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Winifred, daughter Winky ’82, son Tony ’86 and a class that honors him for all he did for us.\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123, Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943 (fax)\n\nRay Rasenberger still lives at home in Washington, is in reasonably good shape and looking forward to celebrating his big 90th in September at his vacation home on Cape Cod. His two current Dartmouth grandsons will be among the family attendees.\n\nBruce Crawford and I lifted our glasses to Tom Towler at his 90th in January. The three of us and Tommy Swartz were hosted by Joel Berson when he and Tommy visited Sarasota, Florida, in March. George Hartmann planned to join us, but broken ribs from a fall stopped him. He is recovering well.\n\nIf you didn’t read the interesting interview with Carl Granger in the March-April issue of DAM (page 94), try to do so. Carl’s expertise in developing a system to measure the factors and degrees to which a person is able to be independent physically and mentally is aimed at rehabilitation from strokes, injuries or illness; however, it rings bells for all of us at our age. Great work, Carl!\n\nDaniel Dana Jackson died in San Francisco on January 7. Deke was an All-American swimmer at Dartmouth and captained the team, which also starred Jay Urstadt; it was the start of a life-long close friendship. Deke had an extremely successful career in finance and served on several major corporate boards. Quent Kopp represented the class at his funeral. Deke is survived by his wife, Jeanne, and sons Dana, Michael and Christopher.\n\nWayne Goodrich Whittemore died on December 21, 2016, in Northampton, Massachusetts. Wayne spent his career at Home Life Insurance Co. in New York City, while living in suburban Croton-on-Hudson, New York. He is survived by son Reid and daughter Katherine.\n\nFrederick John Ostrowski died on January 19 in Dunedin, Florida. Fred’s career was as a general contractor and in real estate in Northampton, Massachusetts, before moving to Innisbrook, Florida, in 1992. He is survived by three sons and three daughters.\n\n—John Adler, 75 Silo Circle, Riverside, CT 06878; (203) 622-9069; (203) 637-3227 (fax)\n\nBob Baum called to tell me that his close friend John Simpson had passed away (see below). Bob was one of several classmates—Clarke Church, Bill Ballard, yours truly and the late Burt Proom and Punchy Thomas, among others—who re-bonded on a Dartmouth trip to Ireland when 9/11 occurred. Bob heads a small book publishing company and spends his time between homes in New York City and Stonington, Connecticut.\n\nDoug Thomson recently drove 100 miles from his home on Skidaway Island near Savannah, Georgia, to visit fellow Georgia resident Paul Woodberry on Sea Island. Doug, who will be 93 when you read this, still plays golf. Go, Doug!\n\nJohn McClellan Simpson died on March 1 in Phoenix, where he lived. During his Army service in Tokyo during 1947 John was Gen. Douglas MacArthur’s driver and a member of his honor guard. After graduation John returned to his native Pittsburgh and worked in the advertising and steel industries, becoming president of Bloom Engineering Co. Having vacationed in the Phoenix area since 1964, he moved there in 2000. John is survived by his wife, Eleanor, and daughters Christine, Deborah and Susan.\n\nEugene Dahl Miller died on May 24 in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, where he lived. One of the original 49 49’ers, Gene roomed near Joel Berson and me in Wheeler Hall during our freshman year. After graduation and military service, he joined J.C. Penney Co., managing stores in the Northeast. Then he tried bank robbery as a second career, and consequently spent a while in prison. From there, he wrote to this alumni column several decades ago, describing his current situation and planning to write a book about it. (When I talked to Gene a few years ago he had no objection to my relating his unusual detour in this column). Gene went on to edit a local newspaper and become an avid gardener. He is survived by a son and three daughters.\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123, Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943 (fax)\n\nPaul Woodberry sold his home in Dallas and now lives in Sea Island, Georgia, year-round. In our 25th reunion yearbook (1974), Paul wrote: “We were fortunate to have had the privilege of attending the best college in the country.” He sure put his money where his mouth was, with four children and six grandchildren (four still there) wearing the big “D.” With current news of classmates hard to come by, Paul has been a steady contributor.\n\nQuent Kopp also sends along frequent updates directly or via Jay Urstadt. Last July Quent had two lead stories in The San Francisco Examiner: one on his appointment to the city ethics commission and the other about the local Korean War memorial (whose commission he chaired). What he didn’t report was that he had lunch with my granddaughter (she paid), who is city editor of that paper, and recounted his full repertoire of political and biographical tales to her (without any coaxing).\n\nAs of late February my count of the latest list of ’49ers on this side of the grass shows we are 150 strong as we approach or exceed our 90th birthdays. If anyone wants to know how to get in touch with a classmate, let me know by phone or fax. (I don’t use email.) Feel free to contact me and bring me and your classmates up to date before I have to do so after you’re gone.\n\nBertram Rodman died on December 29, 2016, in Dedham, Massachusetts, where he lived. Bert was probably the best tennis player in the class, and captained the Dartmouth team. He spent his career in the insurance business in suburban Boston, primarily operating his own agency. Bert is survived by his wife, Sue, daughters Ellen and Nancy and son James, to whom the class extends its sympathy. I have a memorable image of Bert and Sue when my late wife, Vi, and I encountered them at a viewpoint overlooking glorious foliage on our way to a fall reunion and shared an extraordinary moment with enduring photos.\n\n—John Adler, 75 Silo Circle, Riverside, CT 06878; (203) 622-9069; (203) 637-3227 (fax)\n\nJay Urstadt was on the “Trump for Victory” team, chaired by his good friend Reince Priebus. Jay has known Trump as “Donny” for 35 years—going back to when Jay was New York State housing commissioner—but can’t call him that any more. Jay is keeping his fingers crossed (like the rest of us) that things go well. Quent Kopp had to pay off an election bet to Jay, which Jay donated to the Republican National Committee in honor of the Hon. Judge Kopp.\n\nFive of us ’49ers mini-reuned at the Dartmouth Club of Sarasota, Florida, lunch in November. Joel Berson and George Hartmann joined Tom Towler, Bruce Crawford and yours truly. We hope to include Tommy Swartz if he visits the area in March.\n\nBrian Hartley Phillips died on October 18, 2016, at his home in Kennebunk, Maine. Brian spent 25 years near Toronto running Ford and GM dealerships and then returned to Kennebunk, which he knew since childhood. He was active in small businesses, civic affairs, tennis and golf. He leaves his wife, Doris (“Dodie”), and children Scott ’74, Christopher, Tracy and Wendy.\n\nRobert G. Reed III died on November 9, 2016, in Boerne, Texas, where he lived. “Rocket” spent his career in the oil business, working for Getty, Citgo, Tesoro and Clark (CEO), among others. While at Citgo he opened the first gas station convenience store in the United States. He also was instrumental in revitalizing two secondary schools: Assets in Honolulu and Texas Military Institute in San Antonio. Rocket is survived by two sons and two daughters.\n\nDeke Jackson (Mount Dora, Florida) sent me Rocket’s obituary and memorial program with a note: “One of those college friendships that only demise can part. We had a lot of fun through the years by email, arguing liberalism vs. conservatism.” Deke says he’s slowing down but getting by okay. Thanks, Deke!\n\nWilliam Holmes McCabe Jr. died eight years ago we have just learned, on January 15, 2009. Bill, who lived in Caldwell, Idaho, spent the first 25 or more years of his career in the real estate business in Anaheim, California, where he grew up. No subsequent information on Bill is available.\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123 Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943 (fax)\n\nPaul Bjorkland finished pulling teeth quite a while ago, and now he has stopped extracting contributions for the College in order to take life a little easier in Ashburn, Virginia. (No pain, no gain.) Seriously, the class is extremely grateful to Paul for his 21 years as head agent. Paul is irreplaceable, so keep your gifts to the Alumni Fund flowing as though he was still there with his prod.\n\nSkip Muller splits his time between New York City and Lake George, New York. A veteran of the Barbary Coast Orchestra at Dartmouth, he still plays bass regularly, especially at the Lincoln Center Library. He reminisced about working closely with Joel Berson when Joel was chairman (no pay, no play) of the American Symphony Orchestra and Skip was financial advisor to Leopold Stokowski, its “maestro” (as he called himself).\n\nTommy Swartz isn’t driving anymore (vision problems) but can still stroke his way around a pitch-and-putt golf course. He socializes with Skip Unger, our pun-full Forty-Niner scribe, who lives nearby in northern New Jersey.\n\nEugene Jeffrey Smith died on July 13, 2016, in Newbury, Massachusetts, where he lived. Gene earned his master’s in journalism at Columbia and worked as a business reporter for The Herald-Tribune, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. He is survived by sons Luke ’88 and Eric and daughter Brooke.\n\nEdward Michael Sullivan died on July 14, 2016. Ed graduated from Harvard Law School and practiced for 55 years in the Boston area, where he lived. A bachelor, he enjoyed playing squash, driving Porsche cars and traveling overseas.\n\nVail Kellen Haak Jr. died on September 4, 2016, at his home in Hanover. In addition to his Hanover-based insurance business, Vail participated in many College- and class-related activities, receiving a Dartmouth Alumni Award in 1996. Vail is survived by his wife, Barbara, son Kellen ’79 and daughter Amy ’80.\n\nAllen Joe Wilson died on August 14, 2016. Allen, a Navy V-12, lived in Plainfield, New Hampshire. He is survived by his wife, Jean.\n\nMahlon Hoagland Fox died on August 9, 2016, at his home in Peachtree City, Georgia. A non-graduate, he is survived by his daughter, Gail.\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123, Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943 (fax)\n\nJohn Stearns sounded pretty chipper and is holding his COPD at bay in his Georges Mills, New Hampshire, residence. He hopes to see the Big Green in action this fall. John and Winnie broke bread with Anne and George Hartmann several months ago.\n\nBill Ballard has been living in Daytona Beach, Florida, for four years with a soulmate he met after Nomi passed away. He has severe glaucoma and she has macular degeneration, so they watch “lots of lousy TV” as best they can.\n\nJane and Clarke Church spend their summers in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and winters in Vero Beach, Florida. Clarke finished the second of his two books about his long career at Procter & Gamble: Prime Time Odyssey and From Scranton to Moscow in 42 Years. Primarily written for his family, you can get them through Amazon. Clarke is on a walker, so no more golf.\n\nSan Francisco’s ethics commission was excoriated as a “sleeping watchdog” in a civil grand jury report. Maybe it will wake up with “the legendarily cantankerous” Quent Kopp as its newest member. “Kopp can sniff out a rat better than any terrier,” according to the commission vice chairman. Quent has been called a lot of things in his time but a “sniffer” appears to be new.\n\nLouis Arthur Buie Jr. died on May 11 near Edina, Minnesota, where he lived. Bud took his medical training at Dartmouth, the University of Minnesota and the Mayo Clinic and was chief of staff and of surgery at Fairview Hospital in Minneapolis.

Slade has chosen to skip this year’s Cleveland convention and focus on Washington State races and Washington, D.C., lobbying for his law firm. He has always been a strong Seattle Mariners fan and was instrumental in getting Nintendo to buy them 25 years ago. “Slade Gorton Night” at the stadium honored him recently. However, his first pitch lacked the velocity and accuracy of his previous political pitches.\n\nJoel Berson and I had a fun lunch with Jay at his Urstadt-Biddle office in Greenwich, Connecticut. Jay’s son-in-law handles most of the heavy lifting, so Jay can enjoy (?) Republican politics at the highest levels. He plans to be in Cleveland as a New York super-delegate.\n\nJay and Deke Jackson (San Francisco) first met in Dartmouth’s Spaulding Pool 71 years ago. They were still at it, last spring at Deke’s club in the Bahamas. Jay says, “Old swimmers never drown, they just float away.”\n\nClass president George Hartmann has nothing presidential to report. He and Anne spend eight months in Hanover and four in Bradenton, Florida. His doctors won’t let him have another knee replacement, so no more basketball.\n\nThree non-graduate obituaries to report: Jordan Kurland of Washington, D.C., on January 23; Jack Seiverling of Ephrata, Pennsylvania, on February 9; and Alan Rich of Sun City Center, Florida, on March 14.\n\n—John Adler, 75 Silo Circle, Riverside, CT 06878; (203) 622-9069; (203) 637-3227 (fax)\n\nFrank Munson checked in from his winter home in Vero Beach, Florida. His vision is limited by macular degeneration, so goodbye golf. Frank spent his career with General Reinsurance, retiring as CEO about five years before Warren Buffett bought the company. Frank lives in Rowayton, Connecticut, in the summer.\n\nQuent Kopp continues to write informative articles for a local San Francisco paper. A quarter-century ago, as chairman of the state senate transportation committee, Quent sponsored the creation of the California High-Speed Rail Authority to cut travel time between San Francisco and L.A. to less than three hours. Subsequent legal squabbles over potential and actual bond violations, rights-of-way for dedicated track, prohibition of taxpayer subsidies, etc., have imperiled the politically bastardized project. Quent currently supports a ballot measure redirecting $8 billion in unspent bond funds to higher-priority water storage and usage projects. Kudos to Quent for fighting the good fight!\n\nRobert Jeffrey Reed II died on January 31 in Wheeling, West Virginia, where he lived.

George voted in his local caucus, finding it crowded, orderly, but somewhat amateurish. Each candidate except Trump had a speaker give a two-minute talk. George, who uses a wheelchair and had recent heart surgery, sounded as strong as ever. Ray was bombarded with phone calls and junk mail in unbelievable quantities, but appreciated the opportunity to see the candidates up close. He continues to serve as chairman of the Manchester Easter Seals program, while closing out the remnants of his life insurance business.\n\nRobert Joseph Bellemare died on September 28, 2015, at his home in Topsfield, Massachusetts. Bob, 94, may have been the oldest non-honorary member of our class, graduating from Bennington (Vermont) High School while most of us were in seventh grade.

He lives in Mount Dora, where he moved after a 40-year banking career, spent mostly in Chicago. Deke has frequent email exchanges with our faithful class agent Paul Bjorkland in Ashburn, Virginia, and Rocket Reed in Boerne, Texas, where he operates a horse farm.\n\nBob Schmitz phoned from Cincinnati, having been out of touch since our 55th reunion. He worked as an accountant for several companies, including part-time for a funeral home. (Note: He knew where all the bodies were buried.) Bob played in the Barbary Coast Band at Dartmouth and then in Cincinnati until he “hung up his clarinet” two years ago.\n\nPaul Woodberry called from Sea Island, Georgia, where he plans to live all year round after selling his home in Dallas. He extolled Dartmouth’s extraordinary professor JohnRassias, our honorary classmate, who died on December 2.

Jack, 92, was married in 1943, when almost all of us were in high school. He spent his career as an insurance salesman for New England Life in Rochester, New York. He is survived by four daughters and four sons.\n\n—John Adler, 1623 Pelican Cove Road, BA123, Sarasota, FL 34231; (203) 622-9069; (941) 966-2943 (fax)\n\nPersis and Bob Alden invited me for dinner at the retirement home in Stamford, Connecticut, where they moved last year. Bob is a real trooper as he deals with the aftermath of a stroke a few years ago. He stays in touch with close friend Clarke Church.\n\nGeorge Hartmann had to cancel the mini-reunion when the caterer became ill. We’ll probably hold off on reunions until our 70th, four years from now. Slade Gorton plans to cheer for Dartmouth at the Harvard game, with both teams undefeated. Fifteen years out of the U.S. Senate, he can’t be too happy with what Congress hath come to.\n\nDavid Robert Raynolds died on June 19, 2015, in Lander, Wyoming, where he lived.

Robert is survived by his wife, Nancy, three daughters and a son.\n\nRobert Nelson Parsons died on September 9, 2015.
