        "text": "If there is a list of musicians overdue to release a new album, Leslie Mendelson has been at the top or very close to it for a long time. Until now. Mendelson’s latest release, After the Party, her first since 2020’s If You Can’t Say Anything Nice is a bold showcase of her growth in front of and behind the microphone.\n\nMendelson’s patented lyrical vulnerability permeates the album. She laments, “Don’t write me off because I’m down on my luck. So please think of me before I fall apart” on opener Have a Little Heart. Another shiny example is My Own Worst Enemy. “Why do I have to be my own worst enemy? How am I always the last to see, that all I am’s my own worst enemy?” This go around, Mendelson matches this vulnerability with a newfound confidence and acceptance on her part that it’s okay if the world isn’t the utopia we all want it to be.\n\nFour albums into a decades long career, Mendelson wisely uses the connections she’s made along the way to take this release to new heights. Her longtime writing partner/producer Steve McEwan is along for the ride. For the first time in her career, Mendelson brought in two additional producers. The legendary Peter Asher who she knew through her work with Jackson Browne signed on along with fast rising producer Tyler Chester. The album was recorded at Browne’s Groove Masters studio.\n\nThe impact is profound and immediate as Mendelson travels new roads in the voyeuristic Other Girls or the psychedelic David Bowie nod in Signs of Life. Her confidence and fearlessness to expand her sound creates a “bookmark” as she puts it in her wide ranging career.\n\nMendelson sat down with Slideandbanjo.com for a behind the scenes look at the making of the album. She also breaks down each track on After the Party and shares the unique backstory on how each fit on the release. She begins by discussing how Asher and Chester came to produce the album. “Steve and I work well together. I thought it was a good idea to get a third. I’m like, we will kill each other if we try to make another record alone. I wanted the expertise of someone who has made records I love. I wanted someone to make me think outside the box, or do things different that I would do myself. We can do it fine. It was exciting to get outside expertise.”\n\n“I was elated to work with Tyler Chester. I loved what he did with Madison Cunningham. When the opportunity came to work with Peter Asher, I said I’d be crazy not to. I sent some songs to Tyler and he picked a few he liked the best. The same with Peter. He picked the ones he liked. At the end, they were all songs that fit the opportunity with each producer. When I had a collection of songs that went together, I was like this sounds like an album to me. If Beyonce can have three or four producers for an album, so can I.”\n\nHave A Little Heart- It’s not about me or a relationship I’ve had. It’s one of the first songs written during the pandemic. I was talking with my sister. We were both going through difficult times. I realized I had this anger around me. I was not happy. The point of the song is, if you give love, you get love. If you keep the love to yourself and don’t put it out there, you’re selfish. Love begets love. It’s making yourself vulnerable when you’re going through a hard time. It’s first on the album because it felt like a very “me” song. You want to let everyone in. What a better way to do it then being at my most vulnerable.\n\nOther Girls- It’s a joke that came out of my mouth. Then I thought it could be an interesting song and perspective. It’s about being in a relationship and dealing with jealously. My fun way to turn jealously on its head. There are so many dynamics that people have in their relationship. You have no idea what anyone is dealing with. This is my take on how to deal with jealousy in a relationship. It’s a fun playful song. (S&B- If the listener didn’t know you, it could have a very different meaning) That’s great. It’s the best thing you can do as a songwriter. To have your perspective and everyone else has their own take.\n\nRock n Roll on the Radio – The origin of the song came from being inspired by looking for good rock and roll on the car radio. It’s a universal feeling. The first time I played the song, I was at a songwriter event with Sierra Hull. She played mandolin with me that I loved. When Peter, Steve and I were thinking about it, we referenced the R.E.M. song Losing My Religion where you can have a mandolin and drums at the same time.\n\nAfter the Party- For this song, I wanted the 60’s dreamy feel. Andy Warhol’s After the Party painting is the inspiration. I was trying to portray myself being at a Velvet Underground concert. I wanted to extend the end. It’s basically done live. I didn’t have to do much to it.\n\nThe Good Life- The sentiment to the song is looking back on times past with a friend. Trying not to focus on regrets. I’m always thinking I could have done that better, but there’s no point in that. It’s a waste of time. It’s trying to embrace the future. As far as the sound, we were going for “The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.” The breezy thing he does. It feels like a throwback to Harry Nilsson and Glen Campbell. I love that era of folk country music and this one felt like it fell right into that. This one came late. It was one of the last songs Steve and I wrote for the album.\n\nKeep A Little Light On – I love this song but I can’t take any credit for it. Steve wrote this one before I met him. Steve is a professional songwriter by trade. There are songs that never get made and they end up on the song mountain. Which is a funny term. This one was hanging out. He would play it at times and I always loved this song. It’s so beautiful. I couldn’t believe nobody has done anything with it. It wasn’t finished so I had some ideas for the end. I can’t take any credit other than helping arrange it and put my own spin on it. I loved it and wanted to sing it. There’s been a couple of songs along the way I’ve taken (laughs) or claimed as my own. My first album Rest of London felt like an old Jimmy Webb song. I was like what is this? Why haven’t we done it? It happens sometimes. I love singing a good song. I don’t care if I wrote it or not.\n\nSigns of Life- We’ve entered the psychedelic part of the record. It was one of the first songs I thought of sitting in my apartment during the pandemic just dreaming of getting out. Looking forward towards the future. It was a blique moment. I wondered is this it? It got weird in the beginning. This had a David Bowie vibe to it and we leaned into it. I grew up listening to Pink Floyd and all the psychedelic stuff. I love that genre of music. That feeling of space. Even Elton John’s Rocket Man. I’m a big fan of that. Prog rock. You know. I play keys. Steve plays guitar. There’s some weird synth stuff. We’d put it in, then take it out. It was an adventure.\n\nMy Own Worst Enemy- These three are Tyler ones. I made a mini album inside the big album. I didn’t mean to. It just worked like that. An album within album. Steve brought in the lyric. “Why do I always have to be my own worst enemy?” I was like there it is. I felt I could work with this. I brought in the “I can’t run away from myself.” I launched into that. I knew it needed to go somewhere melodically and I shifted the gear on the car to get there. This my ode to Paul McCartney’s Band on the Run. You have three complete songs in a way. There is an evolution in the song to the part where it breaks down on the piano. Then we have a full on jam at the end. That’s different for me. I’ve never done that on a record. I can’t wait to do it live because it has a great vibe. Tyler was so brilliant adding the organs and all the other different sounds.\n\nI Gotta Go- (Laughs) There’s the line “I might be a schmuck but hey you know I ain’t no schmo.” We came up with that lyric and I was like it’s too Jewish. Tyler thought it was so fun. I said, Oh my god it’s so schticky. I was like no. I thought it was too much. He assured me, I promise it’s not. Sometimes, I’ll say something and wonder why did I say that? It was a joke. He was firm, nope it’s staying in. It’s fine. That’s another pandemic song. I was at the point of please get me out of here. That song came out of the monotony. This isn’t a pandemic record but dreaming of a better place. There was lots of contemplation going on. It definitely inspired lots of topics. Especially dreaming.\n\nI Know a Lot of People – Heath Ledger said “I don’t have a lot of friends. I just know a lot of people.” We were trying to find a way to sing it. It was a good lyric, but dark. I changed it to how Willie Nelson would do it and I made it a country song. It could have gotten really dark. We were messing with some other more introspective things. I thought this lyric is so dark we need to do the opposite and it can almost seem comical. I really love the lyrics. It came out quick. Maybe took one day to write. We both wrote lyrics, so it was easy. That song wrote itself.\n\nAfter the Party (2024)- Leslie Mendelson, Royal Potato Family, Steve McEwan, under exclusive license to Pasadena records\n\nCover photo – Mary Ellen Matthews\n\nIt’s not often the true depth and beauty of an album is based on how well you know the musician or group releasing it. Such is the case for Larry Campbell and Teresa Williams’ latest album All This Time. On its surface, the album is a spectacular showcase of Campbell’s next level guitar playing/composing mixed with Williams equally next level vocals. If you knew nothing about one of music’s royal couples, this album stands solid on its own.\n\nIf you’ve spent five minutes in the company of Campbell and Williams, you’ll quickly realize All This Time is full of biographical tales of their decades long relationship that’s seen them frolic with the Mt. Rushmore of musicians… Bob Dylan, Levon Helm, Phil Lesh, and on and on. Not only does the album spotlight Campbell and Williams’ love story, it does so in chronological order. Amazingly, according to Campbell and Williams it was completely unintentional.\n\nThe album opens with a country flavored rocker Desert Island Dreams and ends with a beautiful cover of Jesse Colin Young’s Pretty and the Fair. In between, is the tale of Campbell and Williams’ long journey of music and love.\n\nTheir relationship moves from friendship to romance in the title track All This Time. “We started out as friends. Trying to pretend we can hold the line. Can we finally end this masquerade after all this time?” The dynamic duo’s tale continues until they’re reflecting on the good old days in, We Done Earned It. “So, let’s turn out the light, step out tonight. Show ‘em how to have a little fun. Cause we done earned it baby.”\n\nIt doesn’t take more than a few minutes with Campbell and Williams to realize they are two of the nicest and most humble musicians you will come across. Their list of credits and musicians they’ve shared the stage with is endless. Campbell is the Mt. Rushmore of music sidemen. He stood by Bob Dylan’s side for a decade before joining Levon Helm for years leading the historic Woodstock Rambles. He’s played with Cyndi Lauper. He played with Jorma Kaukonen. It doesn’t matter the style of music, there’s always an invitation for Campbell to record and/or tour. He even played the violin in the Tracy Chapman / Luke Combs Grammy masterpiece performance of Fast Cars earlier this year.\n\nOnce again, Campbell and Williams were gracious enough to give Slideandbanjo’s Marty Halpern an in depth look at the making of their latest album. Like their album, the duo dive deep into their relationship and the forces that turned a studio album into a biographical love story.\n\nS&B- Hey Larry and Teresa. It’s great to talk with you again. Congratulations on the new album. I’m just going to belly flop right in. Having interviewed and met you with the last album, when I listened to this album for the first time, I’m like, oh my God, these two are just singing to each other. I mean, literally. That’s what I took out of it. This is unlike anything I’ve ever heard.\n\nLarry- Wow. That’s huge to us. Yeah, whether it was consciously or not. This record is a testament to our relationship.\n\nTeresa – Absolutely.\n\nLarry- The songs. I don’t think they were set out to be that way. Not on purpose. I was just writing songs, and the songs are coming out of me. I’m not looking for any kind of thread. I’m not looking for a theme. The songs would come one at a time. After everything was assembled and recorded, I mentioned to Teresa, interviewers are going to want to know if there’s a theme, and she found it.\n\nTeresa- I don’t remember him saying everybody’s going to want a theme… Well, maybe you did, but I didn’t care. It was when we had to find an album title, I started looking at it in that way. The guys kept picking song titles from the record. I started looking at what we’re really trying to find. Trying to figure out the artwork. It’s one of those things where it showed me what you just said about relationships. Every song on the record except for one is about relationships.\n\nOnce we picked All This Time as the title, it just completely fell into place. Our manager said something about clocks for the artwork. I said, I have these pictures of clocks from a place we stayed in Italy a few years ago. I started digging around and these photos were screaming at me, you have to use me. You have to. I kept thinking why would clocks be in the artwork? Once I realized the relationship theme, all the pictures that had been poking at me made sense. It’s like my subconscious is working with Larry. It all fell into place. I loved the artwork. It was both of our subconsciousness reaching out. Larry would send me the songs one at a time. One would come, and then weeks later, another one would come. A lot was based on Larry’s awful bout with Covid.\n\nS&B- We talked about how difficult the isolation and lack of knowledge about Covid really threw you two for a loop for your Live at Levon’s! release. Larry was in bad shape at one point.\n\nLarry- I was up here at our house in Woodstock all alone. All I had was Teresa on the phone every day because she was in Manhattan. That’s what kept me going. I was very sick and in and out of this fever delirium. As I finally got through this thing, the absence of human connection was stark to me. As the pandemic went on, you couldn’t socialize. You couldn’t be with your friends. You couldn’t perform. You couldn’t be in a room with a bunch of people. To the degree this record came out of my subconscious, that’s what was working around in there.\n\nTeresa- There’s plenty to be said for the greatest stuff comes from, not focusing on it. It just happens as opposed to trying to write a technical path to it. It takes some doing to get out of your own way, in your own head. Larry’s being so sick forced him into that place. It forced him to stop being busy. Larry is very busy. His brain needs so much stimulation. Got the TV going 24/7 until he falls asleep, and I turn it off. He’s emailing, texting, taking phone calls, practicing while he’s doing all of that. We haven’t really talked about this part, so this is interesting you’re pulling this into the air, Marty. But, yeah, for it for him to. Wow. I hadn’t really said this aloud, but being that sick allowed his subconscious to come up through all of that noise and crap that goes on every day.\n\nS&B- Going back to our previous conversation, it was well documented how the covid experience cemented some life changes you were in the middle of making. Most importantly, the realization that Larry can still pick and choose the projects he wants to work on, but going forward, focus number one is Larry and Teresa.\n\nLarry- We were headed in that direction before I got sick. Covid just solidified the whole thing for me. Out of everything I’ve done my whole career, Larry and Teresa is easily the most gratifying. You get to do the thing you love with the person you love, and the person you love to do it with. So, what more could you ask? I did an interview and they asked if Bob Dylan ever called and wanted to put that band back together again, would you go? In the spirit of never say never, I said, I don’t know, but I would not do it if it interfered in any way with what I’m doing now with Teresa. That was an easy, easy answer right there.\n\nS&B- That’s an extraordinary commitment and it’s clear that’s your gameplan moving forward. Enjoy the fruits of your labor, cause you done earned it.\n\nTeresa- There are different angles to look at this. I love to work, love working with Larry. That’s all great. I like being on the road. But I also like being with my family. I still have family around. And sadly, Larry does not. I feel it’s important for the art and my life to maintain those relationships. I want to enjoy my family while I have them. While we’re all young enough to enjoy that.\n\nS&B- Given the time and commitment you’ve both put in for decades, no one is going to hold it against you if Larry wants to be more specific with his side projects or you want to find some peace and quiet in the country.\n\nTeresa- Larry says, you need to find some balance. Traveling is fun. Performing is fun. It’s part of who we are. Our whole life. My whole life. If you don’t stop and do the other stuff, you’ve got nothing to give on stage. Or when you want to write your next song. Where is that going to come from if you can’t cut the noise out for long periods of time? Maybe if you’re used to noise, noise, noise, it’s uncomfortable to cut it out for a while.\n\nS&B- This album has been in the works since before Covid. You did the live album as a placeholder to give this the proper time. What was the process of picking the songs that made the final cut? You’ve been playing several of them and others that didn’t make the cut in concert for years.\n\nLarry- A couple of them just got to completion right before we started recording. There are seven originals on the album along with three covers.\n\nTeresa- One of them is George Jones’s That’s All It Took which Larry played for years with Levon. As we did with our first and second record, we wanted to have a song with Levon playing drums on this one.\n\nLarry- We did some rhythm tracks with Levon when we were working on his Electric Dirt record (2009). We also did some new tracks for what was supposed to be our first record. We used one track on the first record. We used another on the second. That’s All It Took seemed like the perfect candidate for this one. It’s a song we’ve been playing for years, and we love it. That was an obvious choice for one of the cover tunes. Then there was Pretty and the Fair. The Jesse Colin Young tune I’ve always been enamored with. Teresa and I sang that together, years ago, just kicking it around. We worked out an arrangement and put it on this one. The final one is I Love You, the Julie Miller tune. Julie handed that song to Teresa a few years ago and said, “I think you should do the song.” She was damn right. If Julie gives you a song, that’s like Christmas morning.\n\nS&B- Jumping back to That’s All It Took. Any time you can put new Levon Helm music on a record in 2024, that’s a wonderful thing. You updated the song a bit in the studio, but most of the recording is untouched including Teresa’s vocals from fifteen years ago.\n\nTeresa- It’s fun to hear my 15-year-old voice. I’m just guessing at the date. To this day I enjoy singing that song. I really love laying into that. And it’s stone cold country.\n\nS&B- That brings up another point. I Love You has some uniquely twangy vocals on your part Teresa. How do you determine which style of vocals the song calls for? It’s completely different from your vocals on a song like Ride with Me.\n\nTeresa- I don’t even think about that. I just get in front of a microphone and it’s like that other stuff we were talking about, it just tells you what it wants to be. It leads you down the road. That is not a conscious choice. I just jump in and see what it wants to be. That’s a fun ride.\n\nS&B- That’s interesting. You can obviously hear the vocal difference between the two, and you’re saying that’s just how it comes out of your mouth? That’s unbelievable.\n\nTeresa- Almost always, I’ll do a scratch vocal while they’re doing the rhythm tracks. I love to hear what’s going on with overdubs and stuff. That helps inform me where Larry is going down that road. He says he needs my vocal to tell him where I’m going with it. We kind of vie for the position of hearing what the other one’s going to do first, to inform our choices.\n\nS&B- That’s another example of you two operating on a level higher than the standard consciousness. Obviously, you’re speaking to each other in some form other than just words.\n\nLarry- That’s right. That’s so true Marty. Very perceptive and astute. It’s really the glue of our marriage what you just described. We will end up not talking verbally about a lot of stuff. Things that probably should be aired. We can get around it by communicating in these songs.\n\nS&B- That’s a beautiful thing. No one’s ever brought that angle up. Music makes up for Larry didn’t take out the trash?\n\nTeresa- (Laughs) Or I spent my last dollar on a top for the next show.\n\nS&B- Let’s just go sing to one another and all is forgiven. You’ve cracked it. You’ve cracked the musician’s key to a happy marriage. That’s beautiful. As I mentioned earlier, anyone who knows you two will instantly see a lot of the themes of this album are biographical. It has such a personal feel to it.\n\nTeresa- I wouldn’t take it completely literally, because some of this stuff I hope is not specifically about me, but all relationships. It covers the good, the bad, and the ugly. The beginning, the middle, and the end. Hopefully not our end yet. We’ve been around long enough to say we’re in the last phases of our lives. This album, I just love how it presented itself to us. We didn’t concoct it. It was there on a platter.\n\nS&B- We discussed the “unintentional” biographical element to this album. It also has a chronological flow to it. All This Time is the tale of friends taking their relationship to the next level. Exactly your path. This is followed up with songs titled, Ride with Me, The Way You Make Me Feel, That’s All it Took, A Little Better, and I Love You. Not very relationship subtle. By the time you get to the jubilant We Done Earned It, looking back at long roads traveled, it feels like a Broadway play about your lives. Or the soundtrack to one.\n\nLarry- It was totally unintentional, and that’s it. That’s the beauty of music. When people see things, the creator doesn’t see.\n\nTeresa – That’s why you should never tell people what it is about. Let them have their own experience.\n\nS&B- Looking at the song All This Time. There’s a great contrast between the mandolin and your vocals Teresa. It’s a happy song that rejuvenates the listener. I think it’s an underrated song on the album.\n\nLarry- That’s great.\n\nTeresa– Yeah. I enjoy singing it too.\n\nS&B- That brings up another area of discussion. You have a lot of songs where Teresa’s the main vocalist. Some with Larry. Some with both. I’m curious, do you have a set percentage of the vocal distribution based on who is singing? For example, when it’s the two of you is it 70/30 Teresa or 60/40? There’s definitely more Teresa than Larry on the songs with combined vocals.\n\nLarry- She’s the singer in the band.\n\nS&B- Obviously, I’m not taking anything away from your voice, Larry. But Teresa’s vocals are in a class of their own.\n\nLarry- She is the voice. She absolutely is the voice. I’m fine with what I contribute as a singer. I’m proud of it. That’s who I am and what I do. Like the song, A Little Better. That’s me singing, but it’s not necessarily a song that’s a showcase for a singer. It’s me telling a personal story of mine. So it works on that level. When you want to get the song across, and the melody is important. The presentation of that melody and the lyrics are important. It feels right Teresa would be vocally dominant in that situation.\n\nS&B- Thanks for the insight. With everything you put into the production of the record, it didn’t seem far-fetched that you had a set Larry/Teresa vocal mix for those songs.\n\nTeresa- I don’t. Do you Larry?\n\nLarry- Not really. Sometimes when I’ll sit there with our engineer Justin (Guip), and before we put that on the final mixes, I just want to make sure that what Teresa is putting out is not hindered by anything.\n\nS&B- Exactly\n\nLarry- That doesn’t necessarily mean bringing down my volume. Especially if we can accomplish that with an even volume. What Teresa is doing has to be prominent.\n\nS&B- Thanks so much for the time guys. As we wrap this up, there are songs you’ve been performing that aren’t on this album. You’re still on the road touring behind the release. What is the plan moving forward? Are you going to make another studio album? Or do you not even want to think that far ahead?\n\nTeresa- I feel like you should start working on your next album, or at least writing it as soon as you finish the last.\n\nLarry- After I get through a project like this. I’m an empty shell. Recently, I’ve been starting to feel the twinges again. From a lot of inspiration. Songs always start with the melody for me, and these melodies are beginning to come again right now. I’ll let them ruminate for a while which will eventually turn into a complete melody for lyrics to be superimposed over. Then, part of that melody will evoke some little phrase that will keep going through my head. That phrase, if I choose to accept it will hopefully work its way through a song that would the subject matter worth writing about. We are doing another record. When it’s going to happen, I can’t tell you. But, we’re doing another record.\n\nLarry Campbell and Teresa Williams All This Time Royal Potato Family Records 2024\n\nPhotos – Gregg Roth\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the musical genre Appalachian Grunge, you’re not late to the party. In fact, the term was created by Virginia (and Appalachian Mountain) based musician Dori Freeman for her latest release Do You Recall. If you’ve listened to any of Freeman’s first four albums, the thought of her releasing anything grunge should instantly cause your mind to short circuit.\n\nFrom the first notes of 2016’s debut Dori Freeman, Freeman’s vocals have been as pure and effortless as they come. There are no runs or riffs. Those are completely unnecessary. She relies on the vocal training picked up as a child in her choir. Add in the acoustic guitar she’s been playing since age 15 and it’s quite a leap to Nirvana, Soundgarden, or Pearl Jam.\n\nThat’s why Freeman chuckles as she coins the phrase “Appalachian Grunge” to describe the expanding amplified sound found on Do You Recall. Just adding an electric guitar and drums is a seismic shift to the sonic palate Freeman has put forth so far. She hinted at expanding her sound on 2021’s Ten Thousand Roses.\n\nThis time around, there’s no doubt. Songs like Good Enough, Why Do I Do This to Myself, and River Runs are the “hardest” songs in Freeman’s short but prolific career. There’s no need for earplugs. Yet. Continually expanding their musical range is a necessity for all musicians. Freeman does it as effortlessly as her vocals in Do You Recall.\n\nAlong with her impeccable vocals, Freeman uses each song to paint a perfect picture of life in Appalachia (or any rural area). She artfully captures escapism in Movie Screen and Laundromat. Relationships are well covered in Wrong Direction, Good Enough, and Rid My Mind. She even tackles poverty and greed with Soup Beans Milk & Bread and They Do It’s True.\n\nSlideandbanjo.com caught up with Freeman to discuss her fifth release in the last seven years. She begins by discussing her process for introducing new music to the world.\n\nFreeman- Usually a year or so after I put out an album, I start to think about another one. I’ll have little pieces of songs. They’ll accumulate enough to where I get the feeling it’s time to make another one. I liked the way Ten Thousand Roses turned out and wanted to keep exploring that. Keep this album in the same vein. It continues on the same path Ten Thousand Roses started on.\n\nS&B- You use the album to continue a more amplified approach to several of your songs. You started this harder edge, by your standards, in Ten Thousand Roses. Is there a specific direction you’re trying to go adding these more electric songs?\n\nFreeman- It’s kind of (laughs) grunge. There’s an extra layer of grit on the last couple that wasn’t present on the first few albums. I’ve been playing longer, and the older I get, the less afraid I am to try different things. It was probably the music I was listening to at the time. It’s a natural evolution of the albums I’ve made. You can’t make the same album five times. You can, but it will be boring.\n\nS&B- There’s really a greater maturity on this album. You come from a point of confidence. Probably from having five albums behind you. You tackle several topics on the album. Do you feel a greater confidence in your voice and are more fearless in what topics you approach?\n\nFreeman- My confidence has grown just with natural aging. I’m raising a young daughter and want to be a good example for her. The older I get, the freer I feel about writing about different things. I don’t have the pressure of a label with set ideas on what songs they want me to produce. There are positives to having the backing of a label. In a lot of ways, I’m glad I did things the way I did. It’s kept me from getting boxed in. It’s confidence, getting older, and not worrying about what people think and how they perceive things. Just being honest in my songwriting.\n\nS&B- There are several themes that appear throughout the album. Escapism, motherhood, rural life, and greed to name a few. You paint a very clear picture of the aspects of small town life. Was that deliberate or another example of the growth you’ve found over your career?\n\nFreeman- I don’t know if it was conscious, but the songs feel like a collection of short stories. The album doesn’t have one theme. Each song is its own story. There are two songs I wrote about my experience growing up and living in Appalachia. That was important for me. There’s a song on Ten Thousand Roses called Appalachian. I wanted to explore that more. I wrote about personal relationships, relationships with my husband and my daughter. The perspective of motherhood isn’t super common in music, and I like to write about that. It’s so universal. Everyone has a mother or are mothers. I wrote about a lot of different themes and made an album about it the best I could. Anyone who grew up in a more rural or country area, those songs are relatable in that way.\n\nS&B- Is there a specific process you use when putting an album together. Is it lyrics and then the music or vice versa? How do the songs go from birth to ending up on the album?\n\nFreeman- It’s different each time. Usually, I have a piece of the melody first. I have a lot of voice notes on my phone. In the car or when I’m making dinner. If something pops in my head, I’ll put it on my phone. They don’t always turn into anything. I’ll go back and sort through those and see if I can find pieces to start from. It’s usually melody first. Occasionally it’s lyrics. With Laundromat, I got an email from my dad. It was the first few lines of the song. He was like this is a song I started years ago and never finished it. If you want to finish it go for it. I liked the imagery a lot and was able to finish it.\n\nS&B- As you put the album together, were there any older songs that didn’t make it on the previous releases you wanted to take another stab at? Or was this all fresh material?\n\nFreeman- A song that wasn’t specific for the album was Rid My Mind. I wrote this song five years ago for another band who recorded it. I hadn’t thought about recording my own version. Nick (Falk), my producer and husband suggested we give it a try. I was super happy with how it turned out. So, we put it on the album.\n\nS&B- Speaking of your husband. The two of you took a new approach to recording this album. You recorded the first three albums in New York and the last in Richmond. This time you changed things up to stay close to home.\n\nFreeman- Every album we have done, we didn’t have much time. I’ve had a strict time frame and budget. We have “x” number of days to record all these songs. This is when the musicians can be here. This time we literally made the album in our back yard. My husband built a timber frame studio during the pandemic. He engineered the record. It was a much more relaxing process than I’ve ever had making a record. We could choose the day and choose the song we wanted to work on. If it wasn’t right, we could come back to it a few days later. It was great to have the time to focus on them that way. There’s something to be said for the pressure and having to do it in a certain time frame that can create good work. This was a completely different approach, so it was nice to have the extra time to put a lot of care into the details.\n\nS&B- Looking back, are you able to see an extra synergy from working with your husband in a more relaxed recording situation?\n\nFreeman- Obviously, we already have a great relationship and know each other really well. When you work with someone, well, honestly that can go the other way too. Sometimes it’s not great to work with your spouse. That’s how we met, so it’s always worked for us with music. It adds a level of comfort when you’re working with someone you know that well. That knows your voice and the way you approach things. It was an added layer of comfort which was nice.\n\nS&B- Your entire life has been around music in some form. Your father and grandfather are musicians. It was a little surprising you didn’t pick up a guitar and get more serious about music until you were fifteen.\n\nFreeman- I came to it on the later side. I was always involved in music. I started choir when I was in elementary school and did it all throughout school. I really, really, loved that. It gave me a strong foundation for singing the style of music I do now. Protecting my voice and knowing the proper techniques. All that training is now a subconscious thing. I always was into music in some capacity but didn’t find interest in an instrument until I was 15. I decided I wanted to learn how to play guitar. So, my dad taught me how to play. I didn’t start writing songs until I was in my early twenties. I definitely came to it on the later side.\n\nS&B- That’s really unique because you’re so talented. It’s like, imagine if you started when you were ten? Was there a specific moment or situation where you knew music was the road you were heading down?\n\nFreeman- I still have crippling stage fright. I get so nervous. No matter the venue or audience size. That’s why I took so long to come to performing. My dad mainly teaches music lessons. Fiddle and mandolin. He’d play some gigs. I’d go to a gig with him when I was younger, and he would ask if I wanted to sing a song. It was so difficult to even get through one song. I practiced a lot and built the ability to stand on stage in front of people. Yeah, I get very nervous before every gig.\n\nS&B- Let’s discuss your voice and vocals. Do you ever scream and yell? You have the calmest pace that seems to never change. Even with the more electric songs you’ve been putting out.\n\nFreeman- That goes back to the years I spent in choir properly learning to sing. When I found my voice outside of choir, I don’t know. That’s where I landed. I’m glad it seems chill, because it doesn’t feel that way sometimes.\n\nS&B- What are your plans for getting this music out to your fans?\n\nFreeman- I want to tour and I’m booking for 2024. It’s tricky because I’m in a relationship to a full time touring musician. We have a young daughter. My priority is definitely her. I try to be home as much as I can. I tour enough for the album to be heard. I’ll go out for four days at a time. The hardest part of my career is trying to balance the time I spend at home and on the road. There’s never a perfect way to do it. I’d like to ideally play a little more than I do and one day I will be able to do that. For now, that’s not ideal.\n\nS&B- You certainly have taken a different approach to recording and touring than most musicians.\n\nFreeman- I try to make music as frequently as I can which is why I’ve put out five albums in the last seven years. I feel like I have to put music out more frequently because I don’t tour as much. If you’re a touring musician, you can get a lot of mileage out of an album. I try to write often. I’m already working on songs for the next album. When I finish an album, I have a weird sense of great accomplishment but also a panic of ‘Oh my god I’ll never write another song again. That’s it. That’s all I have.’ Inevitably songs do start to come again. I’ve been writing. Trying to push this album out and get ready for the next one.\n\nS&B- Any hints on the direction you’re headed for the next album. Should we expect more Appalachian Grunge?\n\nFreeman- I’d like to have a completely acoustic album at some point. Mainly me and a guitar. I’m sure I’ll do another one with an electric vibe. I’m not sure it will be the next one. There are a lot if things I want to try.\n\nS&B- Thanks so much for the time, Dori. Best of luck going forward and congratulations on the new album.\n\nDori Freeman Do Your Recall 2023 Blue Hens Music Calabro Music Media\n\nPhotos Kristina Lynn\n\nWith his second release Reflector, Daniel Donato drives his Cosmic Country locomotive deeper into his shifting musical universe. His direction is clear, he’s headed towards the truth. This voyage will never reach a destination because there is no end point. And Donato wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nDonato’s passion to explore what lies ahead is palpable and refreshing. Charging full steam into the unknown is exactly what you’d expect from a musician who has literally done the same thing on stage for half his life. At 28, Donato has plenty of fuel and experience to reach the furthest depths of his unique cosmic universe.\n\nAge is one of numerous things in the Cosmic Country cosmos Donato finds irrelevant. “You’re new but you’re old. I feel that. After playing all the festivals we have, with a lot of bands the same age, I noticed the human measurement of age has nothing to do with the universal concept of experiential information. A musician can be thirty years old and have fifteen years under their belt. Another could be thirty and just started touring a few years ago. A lot can be noticed within that contrast. With that there is no hierarchy I operate off. For some reason, I got kicked out of the gate at an early age. I notice a startling difference at times.”\n\nDonato’s years playing on the streets of Nashville and as part of Don Kelley’s band have solidified the country end of his musical spectrum. It also provides even more fuel to sustain his journey through the never ending world of psychedelia. “The idea of Cosmic Country is you have this duality.” Donato explains. “Country is three chords and the truth. That side of the spectrum is very simple. With something Cosmic, the definition of what is ‘infinite’ and most unknown is the cosmos. You have this contrast and a responsibility to cover everything from the ground to the sky. That’s what I wanted to cover on Reflector. In no small feat. Rose in the Garden, Till the Daylight, Half Moon Night those are simple country songs. Then there are more complex songs that are more cosmic. Cosmic country is the duality of simple but complex, but truthful all the while.”\n\nDonato knows his role as conductor of the Cosmic Country express comes with significant responsibility. He’s got a century of country music at his disposal to make current and bring to an audience thirsty to be hip to the classics. “I feel like I’m getting to turn my fans on to a whole part of the American songbook. I mean what kid is listening to Marty Robbins when he’s 14?” Donato muses. “When I started listening to the Dead, I knew all the country songs they were covering. I had been to RCA Studio A where Marty Robbins recorded Big Iron and El Paso. Or Sun records where Johnny Cash recorded Big River. You can take old time material and bring it to life if the audience is willing to go there with you.”\n\nDonato adds, “We will break out a lot of songs that people have never heard before. I feel our fans are really into that. My perspective may be slanted because I’m so in it I can’t see it objectively. Whenever we break out a song from Bob Wills that was recorded in 1957, people don’t bat an eye. They just dance to it. I think we’re at a place where there’s a real need to return to a nostalgic time that was more orderly and loving. Art is a great vehicle for nostalgia.”\n\nAnother critical part of the Cosmic Country experience is the crew Donato uses to bring his music to the masses. His band featuring Nathan “Sugar Legg” Aronowitz on keys, Will McGee bass, and Noah Winner drums provide immeasurable support and energy keeping Donato on course in the CC cosmos. Finding the right combination of personality and ability is something Donato says he learned by the side of Don Kelley for almost five hundred shows. “I said from the get-go this isn’t a sophomore album. When I played with Don, he was a great bandleader. He wasn’t the best musician, but a great bandleader. He knew how to find the right personalities that did inspiring things on their instruments. He organized people like a harmonious cosmic puzzle of personalities playing music. I picked up early on how he was able to assess players and pick the right guys to play on stage. You must have the best band possible with this type of music. It’s not like you can learn how to do it from a Dropbox of music files.”\n\nAnother facet of Reflector’s beauty is Donato’s ability to seamlessly space out songs along the wide range of genres that is Cosmic Country. From Honkytonk slammers Sugarleg and Loco #9 through the wide open Psychedelic Dance in the Desert, the album has a free flowing pace and ease. Donato says the songs quickly showed which direction they needed to go. “It’s right off the bat. Almost instantaneous. Weathervane, Double Exposure, Dance in the Desert, Gotta Get Southbound. When I’m writing those, I’m listening to what the song is trying to say. These songs seem to let me know where they can go live. Probably because I’ve played so many days live over the last fourteen years. When I’m picking on something new, using my imagination, I can see and feel where it will go on stage. With Cosmic Country, I have two buckets to put things in. Psychoactive music and then stories. People need both. You need songs that take place in the garden and others in the forest where you slay the dragon, rescue the damsel and find the gold. That’s where the trip happens. The music will always tell me where it wants to go.”\n\nClocking in at just over an hour, Reflector is about the length of a Donato live set. Donato doesn’t waste a second of that precious time. The album flows smoothly as he conducts his cosmic train on short journeys like Lose Your Mind and Rose in a Garden. Songs like Gotta Get Southbound and Dance in the Desert offer a longer more scenic ride. Finding the right avenues to shine the brightest light on his current and future travelers is another area Donato says he places great focus on.\n\n“I think you need to give people a lot now. With streaming, the vehicle of consumption has changed and altered the attention span of music. People don’t have a lot of time to dig into what you’re doing. They say the attention span is shorter. I disagree. I think the consideration span is different. People will listen to a podcast for three hours. But they consider things worthy of their attention for three seconds. So, if we pass the green light for someone considering us worthy of listening to, I wanted to give them a lot to dig into. There’s a massive opportunity to try to hit people in whatever psychological state they’re in. If you’re watching something on You Tube, you’re in a different state than if you’re listening on Spotify. That’s something we considered.”\n\nAs mentioned in part one, Dance in the Desert is one of the best songs released in 2023 by anyone. It’s so open and flowing it’s easy to see how Donato and crew have been taking it on a twenty minute excursion nightly. Reaching for the deepest chasms on stage is another perfect example of the duality Donato strives for. “Dance in the Desert feels very cosmic country in terms of what it can be. It’s technically not a country song, but it’s not safe in any way. I think artists need to go to the edge and see what you can find out there. That’s literally what the gold miners did. They went to the very edge of the land until they found it in the ocean and started digging for gold. That hero’s journey is analogous in the musical sense. You have to go to the edge with your musical tools and start digging.”\n\nConstantly touring, Donato gets to drive the CC Express to that edge nightly. Keeping everyone safe on the tracks is another responsibility Donato cherishes. “The whole experience of a live show is to collectively direct the crowd’s energy to the music. We’re all hoping something good happens. Everyone is aligned and in agreement on some level. That’s a high ideal. You’re not going into a room other than a concert where everyone wants the same good thing to happen. At a sporting event, there’s half that want one outcome and half that want another.”\n\n“If there’s 100 people in a room and four of us on stage, there are 104 shows happening.” Donato muses. “Even on a physics level, people are hearing things differently. The ‘G’ note coming out of my amp sounds completely different than the ‘G’ note someone in the back of the room with earplugs hears. There’s literally that many shows, realities, and lives happening. When I go on stage, I try to do the will of what is most eternally true to me. I fully surrender my life and the outcomes to that organizing force. Whatever happens is totally fine by me.”\n\nDonato’s time on the road and stage have given him wisdom well beyond his 28 years. His focus is forward, but he’s always on the lookout for pitfalls that can derail his journey. “On the road there are many snakes in the garden and apples to be bitten. Metaphorically speaking. I want to do this for the rest of my life. I want everyone to know when I’m on stage, I’m trying my best. I notice the times I lose spiritual force, or the times I’m not giving it my all on stage. If I’m drinking too much or taking too many substances. That’s the classic downfall of anyone. Trey and Jerry got distracted on that level. I’m diligent these days about the road. I quit smoking cigarettes, drinking a bunch. My daily ethos is when I’m not playing with the truth onstage, I’m trying to seek the truth off stage. Anything that doesn’t hit in the center of that, I turn away from so I can keep my eye on the prize.”\n\nEncore-\n\nAs the Cosmic express rolls down the tracks, another of life’s dualities is staring Donato directly in the face. The only certainty his future holds is that it will be uncertain. He concludes, “I like where we are now. I’ve been doing this long enough to know I don’t know where I’ll end up. I realize people who can create something that stands the test of time don’t know where they’ll end up either. How did Andy Warhol go from silk screen printings to mylar floating balloons? How does Garcia go from acoustic guitar in Palo Alto to using a rolling synth on Shakedown St. thirty years later? You don’t know where you’ll end up. That’s part of the faith required. I believe the actions our ours and the consequences are god’s. It’s taking what the world is telling you to do and seeing where it goes.”\n\n“There are things I want to happen for our team and things to happen for our community. For the community, I want more people to get turned on to this music. I want them to find that ‘something’ in their life. Something that brings more life and truth from our music. For the team, we need more zeroes. Everyone on the road is working hard. Basically, doing three jobs. If we can continue to grow the scale of what we do. Get to better venues with better sound, lighting, staffing and ticketing processes, the community and team would be happy. It’s a temporal desire mixed with an eternal desire. Bringing value to people’s lives.”\n\nDaniel Donato Reflector 2023 Retrace Music\n\nPhotos – Jason Stoltzfus\n\nIf you’re not familiar with Don Kelley, Robert’s Western World or the term busking, it’s impossible to know the full story of Daniel Donato. Incredibly, even without that lengthy and pivotal part of his past, the 28 year old Nashvillian has brought more music from the cosmos than musicians twice his age. His latest album Reflector is technically his “sophomore” release, but Donato left anything sophomoric about his career and music in the rear view mirror ages ago.\n\nThese days, Donato’s focus is on one thing only, bringing his Cosmic Country genre of music to the world. He’s put his popular Allman Brothers tribute project Trouble No More on the backburner. That’s not where his inspiration is. It’s creating a constantly flowing energy back and forth from country music to psychedelia with his audience. There are plenty of stops along the way. Rock, Soul, Blues, Funk, and Jazz just to name a few.\n\nIf psychedelia is at one end of the Cosmic Country spectrum, it’s well represented in Reflector with Double Exposure, and both parts of Dance in the Desert. The latter is one of the best songs released in the indy music world this year. It has a beat, energy and natural openness that feels like a modern day Shakedown St.\n\nWith Reflector, Donato significantly shifts the starting point for the country end of Cosmic Country. Songs like Rose in a Garden, Hi Country, and Half Moon Night continue the unique country flavor found in Donato’s 2020 debut A Young Man’s Country. However, it’s full-on honkytonk instrumental rippers Sugarleg and Loco #9, where Donato takes a sledgehammer to the country end of his musical spectrum. His unbridled pace and fury provide a clear insight into his early days busking the streets of Nashville. Playing music in public for tips. That was followed by three years and almost 500 concerts by the side of Music City legend Don Kelley at Robert’s Western World. A Nashville country music institution across the street from the Ryman Auditorium.\n\nIt’s these formative years as a Nashville street performer, session worker, and member of Don Kelley’s band that set the wide parameters for the deep country influences Donato brings to Cosmic Country.\n\nDonato sat down with SlideandBanjo for a wide raging interview covering his new release Reflector and his incredible journey from playing for tips on the streets to playing in front of thousands and thousands of paying fans. All before turning 30 years old. He begins by discussing the evolution of his current musical palate. “When I was playing with Don, I was really focused on being a guitar player and great musician in a band. I wasn’t spending a lot of time composing or thinking of that kind of stuff. When I left Don is when I started writing and singing more. The honkytonk paradigm is small in bandwidth. It’s not like the Grateful Dead or Phish where you may experience ten musical genres in one night. With Don, it was pretty much Bluegrass, Western swing, and ballads.”\n\nBefore looking at the post Don Kelley part of Donato’s musical journey, it’s best to begin with the multi year long trip he took just to sit in with Kelley’s band for the first time. At fourteen years old, Donato’s father would drop him off in Nashville’s touristy Broadway area. There he’d busk the streets almost every weekend. Eight hours a day Saturday and Sunday. Trying to save enough tip money to buy his dream Fender Telecaster guitar.\n\nAmong the mass of country music greats performing in Nashville at the time was guitarist JD Simo. A flat out country killer and local legend as the guitarist in Don Kelley’s band and its decades long residency at Robert’s Western World.\n\nStill a young teen, Donato religiously showed up at Robert’s week after week hoping for an invite to sit in with his musical inspiration. Three years later, after thoroughly digesting Kelley’s massive catalogue of live tunes, Donato’s dream came true. He found the golden ticket and got his sit in the with the Don Kelley Band. With that, a baby faced Donato looking like he barely cracked triple digits in weight made the most of his chance. He went head to head with Simo in a honkytonk showdown clearly letting everyone know he can hang with the big boys. By 2012, a seventeen year old Donato hit a major milestone in his young career. The wunderkind with a growing reputation as a must see live performer was given a three year spot by Kelley’s side. Four nights a week. Four hours a night with a quick bathroom break.\n\nThis is where Donato says he cemented the country side of Cosmic Country. “When I first started playing music live and I was first getting turned on to music, it was through traditional country music. Buck Owens, Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, Hank Williams, Waylon Jennings. When I left Nashville to go on tour, I was getting turned on to all kinds of different approaches to music. That’s where the wide variety of music I cover comes from.”\n\nDonato continues with the importance those deep country classics are to his current musical output, “With Cosmic Country, I want us to exist in the present, past, and future. That’s what truth is. It exists in all points of time. That’s why I think a lot of the older songs and influences will find their way into the Cosmic Country sound. It’s really based on what turns me on. Nine times out of ten when we’re driving to a gig, I’m listening to old time country music. Ernest Tubb, Tommy Collins, the old Bakersfield stuff. Music people would have never known. When I was playing at Robert’s all those years, that’s all that was played. It was a strange place. Roy Acuff and Hank Williams Sr. Stuff people don’t listen to on a great scale anymore. But it’s all I’ve listened to on some level. The spirit of that old music finds its way into what we’re doing now.”\n\nDonato credits a night at the Ryman for opening his eyes to the musical possibilities ahead of him. He continues, “I saw Sturgill Simpson at the Ryman on Halloween 2015. The Ryman is less than thirty feet from Robert’s. Sturgill blew my mind. He wasn’t doing much differently than we did at Robert’s. I saw the commercial potential of this type of music and approach. So, I was off to the races. How do I find my own sound and niche on this highway? That’s when I set my sights on being a storyteller at the center of the stage.”\n\nAround this time, Donato discovered another vision shaping muse. The music of the Grateful Dead. Their devotion to playing live and telling tales of old Americana were a perfect complement to his insatiable urge to expand his musical vocabulary and horizons. “If there’s anything I’ve learned playing music half my life. There’s no need to rush. The music will take you there if you have faith in it and you show up every night and play like your life depends on it. That’s the simple answer for me. The Grateful Dead influence is everywhere if you’re trying to improvise on stage. You can’t get away from them. It’s the pinnacle of the American idea. The epitome of what life can be is symbolized in the Dead. I’m just a branch on that tree. It’s like a spirit that can inhabit any band.”\n\nDonato went directly to the Grateful Dead playbook with the 15 song Reflector. Play them as much on the road and let them evolve naturally before going into the studio for fine tuning. “We had 150 shows under our belt when we went into the studio for the record.” Donato recalls. “My philosophy is that the stage is the most important place for music. That’s when it’s really alive. It’s happening and being created and experienced by everyone in the room. That’s way different than a record. The stage is a celebration, and the record is a presentation. There’s a duality there that’s real. I wanted to make sure before we recorded a single note, we had played these songs a lot. The songs told us what they needed individually before we put them on tape. There was a lot of playing the songs to the crowd to see what was turning them on and us on.”\n\nThe shine of Reflector is its ability to satisfy the appetite of long time Donato fans while inviting those who want to hop on the Cosmic Country train to come aboard. Songs like Lose Your Mind, Gotta Get Southbound, and Weathervane are certain to be setlist staples going forward. According to Donato, all roads lead to the stage. “A lot of these songs on the record are out on You Tube in their live skeleton. If people are already turned on to these songs, they’ll go and listen to the record and be like cool this sounds different. For those who don’t know us yet, the record is an easy entryway into what we do live. Everything bleeds into the live show forever and ever. I feel a responsibility by being the organizing principal in the Cosmic Country trip, to give everyone and anyone what they need to knock on the door and come inside. I feel like we did a great job with the record. There are a lot of four-minute songs that are easy to listen to. Then they can go online and see a nine minute version. How did they do that? Interesting.”\n\nComing up in part two, Donato continues the deep dive into the ethos behind his Cosmic Country way of life. And for Donato, it’s just that. The way he lives his life. He’ll delve into his process and responsibility for creating music along the wide Cosmic Country spectrum. He also shares his long term vision and philosophy on his perpetually morphing genre of music.\n\nDonato closes part one discussing any changes he wanted to make with Reflector for his “sophomore” effort. “I didn’t want to change anything. I like subscribing to the mindset of going through experiences with showing up as much as I can for where I am in that given time. I was different during the sessions of A Young Man’s Country than I was in Reflector. Both records were made with an intention of truth, beauty, and goodness, but in different frequencies. As listeners dive into both, they’ll be able to hear my progression in my journey in this life and feel the evolution organically and honestly.”\n\nDaniel Donato Reflector 2023 Retrace Music\n\nJoan Osborne has been riding a wave of creativity the last few years. She’s quite aware of this and has no intention of hopping off her musical surfboard anytime soon. Osborne’s latest release Nobody Owns You (her third since 2020) makes an incredibly strong case as a career best. A three decade plus long career as one of the finest vocalists around.\n\nOsborne dons many hats throughout the album. Her first collaboration with producer and co-writer Ben Rice. There’s the reflective Osborne looking back on her career in Should’ve Danced More, So Many Airports, and Great American Cities. The motherly Osborne comes out in the title track Nobody Owns You and Women’s Work. Time of the Gun and Dig a Little Ditch offer Osborne’s realistic take on current events. The album peaks with her role as a daughter in the super personal Secret Wine and The Smallest Trees.\n\nOsborne’s vocals are as on point as they’ve been throughout her career. However, it’s the lyrics and music behind the vocals which set this album apart from her others. Both are as simple and direct as can be. There’s no preaching and complaining. Just Osborne reflecting on the same life events her longtime listeners are undoubtedly going through. Sending a daughter to college and into the real world. Watching a parent’s mental and physical decline. The end of a long-term relationship or simply looking back on the long road you’ve traveled with no regrets.\n\nSlideandBanjo caught up with Osborne to discuss her latest release. She begins by noting the difference between this record and the others from her storied career. “This record came out of a time of a lot of personal upheaval. That left me emotionally raw. It’s not great, but it allows you access to your emotions and deep feelings. I used that to write these personal songs. This record is the most personal I’ve ever done. It’s partly in response to turning 60 last year. That’s a moment when you take stock of your life and ask yourself, if I only have “x” years left on the planet, what am I going to do with that time? What needs to be done that I need to stop waiting to do? There’s a directness in the songwriting that comes from that desire to get to the heart of the matter. I’m an admirer of people who write that way. From Hank Williams Jr. to Lucinda Williams or Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. Writers who cut to the meaning and say things in simple language.\n\nOsborne says she and Rice were in a similar mental headspace making the album. That led to a unique connection that flows throughout the album. “It was great working with Ben. He was interested in all the different poems, lyric ideas, and songs I brought him. It may have been connecting with him on a personal level. His father passed and he was experiencing this loss in his life when we were working together. He was enthusiastic about all my ideas. His thorough way of working really allowed the songs to blossom quickly. If we were working on lyrics and the song needed another verse. I felt I could go in a room for half an hour and come back with two or three options. It became obvious what I was trying to say. That’s a good position to be in as a writer. You say it a couple of ways. The one that’s the best becomes clear to everyone.”\n\nAs Osborne explains, her life and musical experiences gave her the confidence to be as direct as possible throughout the album, “I wanted to write songs that are unique to me. This is what my life is like now. I’ve written songs in different ways before. Short stories with characters. But I didn’t want to do that this time. I wanted to be straightforward and say what’s on my mind in a simple way. I’m not sure if anyone is paying attention to what I’m doing. I have my fans and am so grateful for them. As far as larger music business, it’s not like my name is on everyone’s lips. That can be liberating because if no one is watching, you can do what you want. Not be worried about what others think. It was a permission to be straightforward and personal. I ended up feeling really good about writing songs like this at this point in my career. I’m not bored with this. I have things I didn’t have years and decades ago I can dig into. It’s a rich time for me as an artist and I am happy to tap into those things.”\n\nThe highlight of the album is the song Secret Wine. Written for her mother who is starting to show signs of Alzheimer’s, Osborne’s simplistic tale of fear and hope will hit you deep in your soul. “I don’t want to let her go. But if I must, I must. Please take her hand and comfort her and show her who to trust.” According to Osborne, the song was originally a prayer, but was converted into a song thanks to her in-studio collaboration with Rice. “My mother is beginning to show signs of Alzheimer’s. She’s losing bits of herself. That’s difficult to watch. The song Secret Wine is about that. Hoping she can replace the things she’s losing with something positive and wonderful. There are negative things about her slipping away. But she also has a childlike energy which is a beautiful thing to see. It’s like she’s stepping back into this more innocent time. The song is a wish for protection for her.”\n\nShe continues, “I wrote this after talking with my sisters about the things that were happening with my mom. I brought it to Ben in the studio. He and I worked on the music. His father just passed, and he was going through his own time of dealing with loss. We were so appreciative to have the studio to come to and bring all these emotions. We needed that sanctuary to work through all the stuff going on in our lives. Otherwise, we’d just be going nuts.”\n\nSmallest Trees, an homage to the innocence of being a child is another highpoint of the album. Osborne channels some Bob Dylan like imagery with the lines, “Oh the smallest trees hold the most beautiful birds, and the smallest mouths speak the most beautiful words.” She reflects on her memories of that special time in her life. “That’s from thinking what it was like to be a small child. Remembering the moments I felt so much love for my family and my mother especially. It was like that love had replaced every cell of my body and that’s all I was. As we get older, we can lose touch with that feeling. I have a young nephew. When his mom or I walk into a room, he explodes with happiness and launches himself at you. To feel that kind of love is a beautiful and ephemeral thing. It doesn’t last forever your capacity to do that. Maybe we get back to it as we get older. I’m hoping that happens to me. But it’s there in childhood. I don’t think there are many songs about that.”\n\nOsborne tries to impart some motherly words of wisdom in the title track Nobody Owns You. “You’re as free as the wind in the street and it’s time to stand up on your feet. Darling, you’re complete. Nobody owns you.” While her daughter may not be ready to listen to these pearls of wisdom, Osborne is confident others will. “My daughter is eighteen and done with me for now (laughs). That’s very natural and I don’t take it personally. I feel these are still words of wisdom worth saying. So instead of talking to a wall, I put those thoughts into a song. Hopefully, at some point she’ll listen. Until she does, it’s out there for anyone who needs it. It’s a message young women can stand to hear. As far as we’ve come in supporting them and telling them they can be whatever they want to be. There’s another cultural undercurrent that makes them feel everyone has to like them. Nobody can be mad at them. They have to look a certain way. Act a certain way. You can’t step out of line. Can’t make mistakes. I think it leaves them open to being manipulated by people who don’t have their best interest at heart. I wanted to say it in a simple way that you don’t have to give yourself to people who aren’t on your side.”\n\nAlbeit more tongue and cheek, the theme of knowing your true value continues in Women’s Work. “This is for the women with full time careers while raising kids with their partners. They also have that second shift at home.” Osborne muses. “Often, do more than an equal share of the work at home. Their male partners believe and are totally convinced they do half as much. And it’s just not true. (Laughs). The song is leavened with a bit of humor. But it’s a song that if women stepped out and went on strike, this whole place would fall apart.”\n\nCurrent events are front and center in Time of the Gun and Dig a Little Ditch. Instead of preaching and looking for solutions to a never ending problem, Osborne uses both offerings as a way of accepting the times and navigating through them as unscathed as possible. “It seems like this era we’re living in is defined by the number of tragedies and mass shootings. Guns have usurped our communal lives as Americans. Whether you want to deal with it or not, it’s around you all the time. You hear about an awful shooting and then you send your kid off to school and wonder if it’s going to happen to them. We’re all living with this right now. That’s where the title came from. We’re living in a time of the gun. I hate that, but I can’t turn away from it. I should understand it and face up to it. Figure out what it means in my life. What am I going to do about it and what is everyone going to do about it?”\n\nShe continues, “With Dig A Little Ditch I came up with the line, ‘Dig a little ditch and push the devil in.’ I thought there are devils all around us. You don’t have to look far to find them. It’s a very simple message of what you can do. You have to dig a little ditch and put the devil in. That’s the work we’re doing right now. I tried to put it in a simple poetic language.”\n\nRiding high from another album that dazzles from start to finish, Osborne is focused on keeping her current wave of momentum alive. Her perspective on the world has changed. That’s natural. Everyone’s does as they get older. What hasn’t changed is Osborne’s steadfast focus on her lyrics and vocals. According to Osborne, it never will. “I’m always trying to make the lyrics as good as possible. As a singer that’s one of the main things I have to work with. I need to connect with those lyrics. Even if they’re fun, party lyrics. I need to feel them while I’m singing. I put a lot of time and energy into the lyrics. Wanting them to be something I can authentically perform and connect with.”\n\n“I’m so lucky to have work that I still want to do. Hopefully, I can keep doing it for a little while longer. I’m excited by being able to write songs like these at this point in my career. I feel like there’s another chapter to dig into about what can happen next. Ben and I had such a great time working on the record. Hopefully we’ll get together and write some songs soon. I’m still in that high of being in that zone of creating stuff. I don’t want to step out of it yet.”\n\nJoan Osborne Nobody Owns You\n\nWomanly Hips Music 2023\n\nBassist Karina Rykman already has a resume most young musicians would sacrifice an appendage or two for. She’s toured the United States with high profile gigs at Bonnaroo, Sweetwater 420, and Red Rocks. She’s rocked Iceland. She played with her favorite band Phish for some magical moments during a soundcheck at Madison Square Garden. She’s sat in on multiple occasions with the house band for “Late Night with Seth Meyers.” Another long shot bucket list item she never expected to cross off so quickly. Especially given her musical output has been six spread out single releases.\n\nFor “six singles Rykman” as she jokingly calls herself, that’s no longer the case. Her supremely overdue debut album Joyride is a showcase of Rykman’s musical growth since her first single Plants was released in 2019. The album, written and recorded with longtime friend Gabe Monro is bursting with diverse flavors. A buffet of the multiple musical styles Rykman has already tasted.\n\nRykman happily used the services of longtime pal and Phish frontman Trey Anastasio who let her use his Barn Studio to record the album. If that wasn’t enough, Anastasio also plays on five of the nine songs on the album. And if that wasn’t enough, Anastasio suggested Rykman work with his famed engineer/album mixer Bryce Goggin at The Barn. Which she did.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. You get plenty of Trey in Joyride and All That You Want. Beacon is filled with the vibe she’s picked up as the bassist in Marco Benevento’s band. All of that is surrounded by “core” Rykman. There is Plants. A reworked version of Elevator. A new rocker Run of the Mill and trippy Fever Dream.\n\nRykman, who has gone well out of her way multiple times giving SlideandBanjo.com inside access to her pre-debut endeavors, sat down for a thorough interview with Marty Halpern to finally discuss the release of her first album.\n\nS&B- Hey Karina! Wow. This has been a long time coming. Your debut album is here. I’m sure you’ve dreamed about the process of releasing your first album for years. Has it been everything you imagined?\n\nKarina- It’s a super surreal moment in my life. I gotta say. It feels like a long time coming mixed with the new. I don’t know what to think about all of it. It’s so cool to have a completed larger body of work gracing the masses. It’s fantastic. I’m happy as a clam. I’m super delighted with how it turned out. It’s surreal to think how long it’s been while also being so short. I’m happy to have it finally come out.\n\nS&B- Despite not having that “official debut album” you’ve been releasing and performing your original music for years. Your music caught the eye of Trey Anastasio many years ago and he was so giving to help you with the album. To have someone of his stature help out a rookie must be hard to process?\n\nKarina- I’m humbled to be mentored by someone I love and respect so deeply. It started at Peach Fest in 2021. Trey and I hadn’t seen each other since the pandemic. Trey ran up to me. I didn’t know he had been keeping tabs on my music. He named all my songs and how much he loved them. I was like Whoa! I didn’t realize he paid such close attention. He took a profound interest in helping with the creation of my first record. He offered me The Barn to record the album. It’s his studio since the late 90’s where he’s written and recorded many of Phish’s albums. That was a surreal moment for sure. Bryce Goggin, his engineer and producer mixed it. Trey wanted to coproduce it. It was an amazing time. Every second you spend talking to the guy you learn something. It’s special to get insight from someone who has been at it for so long with so much success. With a heart and mind as open as his. He’s an incredible human and I’m so thrilled to get to work and learn from him.\n\nS&B- The thing that threw me when I saw the track list for the album is most of the songs you’ve released aren’t on it. I thought City Kids, No Occasion, and all the others would be there. With the exception of Plants and Elevator it’s all new stuff. Why did you make the decision to leave out most of the songs you’ve already released?\n\nKarina- It was difficult to even keep Plants and Elevator. Elevator even got a facelift. Plants is exactly the same. It’s the Elevator we all know and love with a more bombastic outro and live drums. It was stuff I wish I could have done to Elevator when I wrote it. It’s a fan favorite and staple closer to my set. I think we finally got it to a place I’m really happy with. Plants, I wanted on my first record. It was my first song ever. It represents a formative special place in my heart in that regard. I felt it deserved a slot on my first record. I shied away big time from keeping my prior singles. The last thing I want is for people to listen to the album and be like, I’ve already heard these songs. I wanted a fresh slate with new music. The songs that made the record are the ones I thought sounded best together. Using the old songs is the easy way out. We don’t do the easy way out.\n\nS&B- Even with all the new songs on the album, there are some that didn’t make the cut. “Atom Dance” which I think is one of your best, isn’t on there. How did you pick what made the final cut?\n\nKarina- The goal is to have a huge repertoire. Our band is in its infancy. There’s been a lot of new tunes we’ve been working on. We’ve debuted a few to see what happens. God willing, Karina’s second album won’t come out too long after this one. I’m constantly writing and permutating. Trying to be prolific and figure out what makes sense.\n\nS&B- How much of the album did you have started when you met up with Trey in 2021? Was this fresh stuff you hadn’t done before because you were working on City Kids, No Occasion, etc.? Or was it freshened up and changed after you met him?\n\nKarina- Most was already written. All That You Wanted, Run of the Mill, Skylark/ Slowlark, and Trampoline. Joyride was not. It was written a few months later. Beacon is another that was written. I had been kicking these around for a long time. The ones I was proud of. The cream, I feel, rose to the top. What made sense revealed itself to me. Trey came in and for a lot of those tunes, like Joyride. He came in and reharmonized the chorus for the outro and added his guitar. The same for Trampoline. The song was essentially written, but he had a concept about what to do at the end. He added the end solo to Run of the Mill. He reharmonized the chorus for Fever Dreams and did an outro that was super interesting. It was cool to work with him and see his understanding of choral harmony. That’s way advanced and he was able to add embellishments I would have never thought of. It was a push and pull. Very symbiotic. He was always saying anything I do, or play don’t be afraid to throw it in the garbage can. I really appreciated that. In the end I took all his advice, and it sounds like a Karina record. We didn’t overdo it. I’m thrilled these songs are going to finally see the light of day. I’m ready to let them go and let them have life.”\n\nS&B- Looking at the individual songs on the album, a lot have lyrics. You still have some that are instrumental. Do you think you’re leaning 80/20 on songs with lyrics or do you think you’ll convert to all songs with lyrics? Or is it just how things worked out for this album?\n\nKarina- Let’s call it 80/20. I love instrumental music as well. I’m not afraid to have both. Sometimes I write a song and really feel it needs lyrics. Then it turns into an instrumental that works on its own. That’s what happened with Plants and Skylark/ Slowlark. It’s a happy medium. I live to defy convention. I’m not scared of any of this. Whatever comes out is cool. We have Atom Dance and several others that are instrumental that are great in the live set. I look forward to recording those and seeing where they fit in my recorded music catalogue. I don’t stand on ceremony on any of this stuff. What comes out, comes out.\n\nS&B- I’ve told you many times, I think you’re the most underrated act out there. You have this bubbly, always happy persona, but people don’t realize you’ve been slaying it on the road for a while. What’s it like to go back and create recorded versions of these songs you’ve been crushing on the road night after night?\n\nKarina- It’s great with the first two singles out. I’m seeing people in the crowd sing the lyrics. It is a rewarding and fantastic feeling. To give them the context of the studio versions of these songs is exciting. To me it amplifies everything. I’m so excited to have people know the tunes before they come to the show. I was just six singles Rykman for a long time. Now there’s so much more.\n\nS&B- Let’s talk about your band, Adam November and Chris Corsico. You met Adam at a party, started playing music together and haven’t stopped since. Chris has broken through a new level musically. Can you talk about the synergy between the three of you and how it’s shaping your vision on what you want to put out creatively?\n\nKarina- It’s shocking to remember my two NYU buddies where we used to jam in Adam’s bedroom. Now to playing all these crazy venues to ravenous audiences with my two dearest friends. It cannot be overstated how much I adore those two. What a joy it is to travel the world with both men. They’re so dedicated and diligent and always down for trying things out. Experimentation. Going in any direction. It’s an exciting thing. We’ve had an amazing year. I love them so much on and off the stage. We hang out all the time. We travel together. Eat dinner together. Go on vacation together. We’re super bonded. They’re spectacular players and even more spectacular gentlemen.\n\nS&B- The three of you are going to hit the road in support of the album. There’s one big change this time. You are going to be the headliner each night. Moving another step up the musical ladder. You must be bursting at the seams to get out and share this music with your fans.\n\nKarina- I can’t wait to play these shows. The fact my New York show sold out 3 months in advance is so incredible. I would have never dreamed about all that. It’s going to be a delight to play these songs, old songs, and even newer songs for the people out there. It’s a dream come true. My vision is to have the most fun possible. Play the songs I’m so damn proud of with my best friends. Enjoy every second of it. Soak it up like a sponge. I hope my stoked attitude permeates into the audience. The audience barrier breaks down and we all have an experience greater than the sum of our parts. I literally live to do this and the only thing I want is to be able to keep doing this as long as possible. I’m like a degenerate gambler who can’t leave the blackjack table.\n\nS&B- Another bonus for you making this album was working with your super close pal Gabe Monro. You have a long history and to be able to bring so many years of collaboration into the world must be special.\n\nKarina- He’s one of my best friends and a spectacular collaborator. We wrote just about all these songs together. To work with Gabe, Trey and Bryce was such a great moment. An amazing meeting of the minds. The most creative, humble industrious people that are so excited and immeasurably good at their craft. Gabe is one of the most special people I have the pleasure of knowing. All we do is write songs. It’s such a pleasure to have somebody like that to sit with and work through ideas. There’s no ego. Never feeling like I can’t come to him with an idea and be my most vulnerable self.\n\nS&B- Let’s discuss a couple of more songs on the album. Starting with “Beacon.” To me that has a distinct Marco Benevento sound. If Marco was on vocals it could be one of his songs.\n\nKarina- You think so. Which Marco song?\n\nS&B- It’s not a specific song as much as it is the flavor of the song. The vocals and drumbeat. Obviously, this is the first time you’ve heard that comparison.\n\nKarina- I’m attached to that song. I have a great love for it. It literally feels like you’re floating in water when the chorus hits with the big bass chords. It’s such a vibe. I’ve been in love with that song for so long.\n\nS&B- What was the process for releasing Joyride and Beacon as the first two singles from the album? Was anything else in the running?\n\nKarina- Joyride, with it being the title track, has a lot of Trey on it. We thought it was a good way to announce everything. Announce the album. Everyone who worked on the album. It’s up tempo, dancy, and likeable. We wanted to put our best foot forward with that. It was the first music I’ve released since Arbitrary in 2021. The song All That You Wanted could have been the second single. That’s the focus track when the record comes out. Basically, the third single without having a third single. I thought Beacon was a darker, moody, vibey that had zero Trey involvement. I didn’t want the second single being another song Trey had a big hand in. Only because I want to show different sides of myself. This is a cool juxtaposition into a different part of my brain. That’s why I used it.\n\nS&B- There’s definitely no confusing a Trey-less Beacon with All That You Wanted?\n\nKarina– I’m a huge fan of All That You Wanted. It’s one of the favorite songs I’ve written. The end was all Trey. He was like, Karina this hook is so good, you can’t just sing it twice. Let’s bring it back but in a different way. He has all these concepts. It was the same with the outro for Joyride. That was conceived by Trey. All That You Wanted is a special tune. It has a soaring guitar outro while feeling super bouncing and floating.\n\nS&B- My favorite song on the album is Run of the Mill. It’s a straightforward mainstream rocker to me and a different sound than anything you’ve released. Especially vocally.\n\nKarina- Everyone loves that one. It’s one I’ve been sheepish about performing live because it has some of the most exposed vocals. It’s scary when you’re exposed like that as a bass player trying to sing (not a singer trying to play bass) if you know what I mean. I’m getting more comfortable vocally in a big way. We played it every night on the spring Guster tour. It has a stone cold vibe and an ethereal and driving quality to it. That’s why it made the record. The whole record has this gooey, jubilant, yet surreal quality to it. The Trey solo at the end is one of my favorites.\n\nS&B- Thanks Karina. I wanted to take a second to thank you for all the time you’ve given the website over the years. I know I’m speaking for a lot of people who are super excited about this milestone and wish you nothing but the best.\n\nKarina-Thanks. Always my pleasure.\n\nKarina Rykman Joyride AWAL records 2023\n\nWhen you hear the name Mikaela Davis, the first image that will most likely pop into your mind is a harp. It makes sense. There aren’t a lot of harpists fronting rock bands. For Davis, her ability to play the harp, which she has done since age eight, is the tip of the iceberg of her musical abilities.\n\nDavis’s latest album “And Southern Star,” a nod to her backing band is a shining example of the growth she’s made over the five years since her debut “Delivery.” The album is bursting with flavor. It bounces from country to rock to pop with Davis’s outstanding vocals leading the way. Pristinely produced, the album is also filled with instrumental voyages inspired by Davis’s collaborations in the jam band scene the last five years.\n\nTechnically, this is Davis’s sophomore release. But she’s been grinding it out in the music world for over a decade. Out of print and practically impossible to find, there are Davis self-releases as far back as 2012. Older than that is the musical relationship and friendship she’s had with drummer Alex Cote. That goes back to their school days. In the middle of high school is when Shane McCarthy (bass/vocals), younger brother of Cian McCarthy (guitar/vocals) joined the band. He graduated early to make sure he was available to tour. Steel guitarist Kurt Johnson rounds out Southern Star.\n\nDavis gained an instant, loyal following after performing with Grateful Dead legend Bob Weir just after “Delivery” was released. Since then, her visibility has grown exponentially. She’s performed with Phil Lesh, Grateful Shred, Circles Around the Sun, and numerous others. “And Southern Star” is loaded with instrumental sections Davis says are a direct result of playing alongside some of the world’s best improvisers.\n\nDespite numerous sets of extra eyes and ears on her music thanks to Weir and Lesh, Davis had a difficult time getting this album released. She parted ways with Rounder records who released her debut “Delivery” in 2018. Davis decided to self-fund the album, betting on herself and her loyal backing band.\n\nDavis begins by discussing the momentum created from that magical meeting with Bob Weir. “Right after Delivery came out is when I got the call to sit in with Bob Weir. That whole world evolved pretty quickly. I was focusing on touring to support Delivery in 2018 and ‘19. My band had the songs on this album ready to go when Delivery came out. In 2020, I reached out to my label and asked if we could put out the next album. Then the whole world fell apart for a couple of years. We put everything on hold.”\n\nDavis states, “When Covid ended, Rounder said it would be some time until they could put out a new album. I didn’t want to wait around. People don’t realize I’ve been doing this for over 10 years. I had to wait to put out Delivery and didn’t want to do that again. So, we amicably parted ways. It was nice of them to let me go.”\n\nLabel-less with an album’s worth of material, Davis searched for the best avenue to bring her music to life. She was not going to be denied. “I decided this album is getting made one way or the other. We made it ourselves. I’ve done session work with my friend Kenny Siegel at his Old Soul Studios in the Catskills over the last 10 years. He really wanted us to make the record at his studio. We talked about it, and I told him we don’t have a label behind us. We worked it out where we were able to record a lot of the album there. Cian, my guitar player, tracked my vocals, keys, guitars and all the extras in my apartment. He essentially produced the album with me and the band. The whole process took about a year.”\n\nAfter taking the album to Mike Fridmann and Tarbox Road Studios to polish everything up, Davis and Southern Star were ready to find an outlet to get this music to the public. Enter Kill Rock Stars music label. Davis had recorded a song with Mary Lou Lord for an Elliot Smith tribute album the label released. She also worked with Chris Funk to record another song featured in a Dungeons and Dragons release on the Kill Rock Stars label.\n\nFrom there, Davis muses, things lined up perfectly, “After that, I thought it only seemed natural they might want to put out an album with me. I asked Chris and Mary Lou to put in a good word. After reaching out and having a great conversation with Slim Moon, they agreed put out my record. It’s been such a cool experience working with Kill Rock Stars. They care about the artist and trust your vision. When we were picking out what singles to add, they had their thoughts and I had mine. They trusted me enough to let me pick. I’m so excited about that. I’m so grateful that I aligned myself with a label so willing to work with the artist.”\n\nThe country soaked openers “Cinderella” and “Home in the Country” are perfect examples of Davis and Southern Star working as a team to maximize the creative output of each song on the album. “Cinderella is one Alex wrote. It was different before I took it.” Davis remembers. “I heard him playing it at a campfire at his family’s cottage. I thought it was so gorgeous. I asked him if I could please have the song. He said, ‘Sure, I don’t know about the chorus. Do what you want.’ I wrote a new chorus and rearranged the song to make it what you hear today.”\n\nFor Davis, transitioning from sole song writer to co-writing with others took some time, but has paid off significantly. “I was so against co-writing when I was younger. I thought I should be writing all the songs myself because that’s what a true songwriter would do. Finally, I realized how wrong I was and how I love co-writing. When you get stuck, bringing the song to someone you trust makes all the difference.”\n\nShe continues, “This band, we’re all songwriters and we all contributed songs to this album. There’s tremendous diversity in the makeup of the band. I’m classically trained on the harp. Cian and Alex are multi instrumentalists who studied jazz. Kurt studied Indian classic music in college. Shane is a multi instrumentalist with a deep knowledge of music. When you look at all our diversity, it only makes sense that the music we make will be equally diverse. We all have different inspirations and put that in the album.”\n\nAs Davis explains, “The rest of the album is full of contributions from everyone involved. Cian is a prolific songwriter. He has hundreds of songs. Not many have been released. I heard him play “Saturday Morning” and “Home in the Country” before and loved them so much. I asked if I could record them for the album. Cian and Shane wrote “Far From You” a long time ago. I added the melody and outro at the end. “Don’t Stop Now,” Cian wrote the words, and I wrote the music. Our manager asked us to write this song for a documentary. It wasn’t picked. I don’t care because we got to record it for the album. It has a great feel and certain tone the rest of the album doesn’t touch on”\n\nWhere “And Southern Star” stands out the most is the familiarity and tightness each of these “new” songs have. Davis and crew have been playing them on the road for a while. She notes how that familiarity entering the recording studio made the final output so much sweeter. “The main difference is we’ve been playing these songs for years. We knew how we wanted them to sound before we went in the studio. With Delivery, we had about half the songs arranged and ready to go. The other half we hadn’t played live yet and didn’t know how we want them to sound. I did this on purpose because I was curious to see where John Congleton would help us take the songs. Alex, Shane and I went in blind with Delivery, which was cool, I’m not against that method. I like how the album turned out and it’s now this moment forever captured in time. We play these songs completely different these days, the live versions have grown with us.”\n\nThe improvisation on the road and instrumental sections on the album are a direct result of Davis wandering into the Grateful Dead and jam band world. “I’ve always been a fan of the Grateful Dead’s music. I hadn’t learned it before I started playing with Bob. Learning that music opened a whole new door for me. As a classical harpist, that’s something I didn’t learn in school. Playing with Bob in 2018 was the first time I’ve ever improvised a solo. I was so nervous. Bob, Don Was and Jay Lane were so positive and encouraging. It made me realize the endless opportunities for the harp.”\n\nDavis adds, “That community has been amazing. They took in my band immediately. It’s great to have an outlet for fans to find my original music. People will say I saw you playing with Bob, or the Relix session. From that, I discovered your original music and was blown away. The other great thing about that community is they are fans for life. They are super dedicated and will come out to every show. We’ve been improvising and stretching out songs. Trying to make each show as different as possible so people will get a unique show each night. Because of my band’s background and love of jazz and the Grateful Dead, it was an easy transition to more improvisation. I have Bob and so many others to thank for that.”\n\nDavis wraps up by weighing in on the unplanned trail she and her band took to make this album and her one simple goal for everyone’s efforts. “I wanted this album to have the spirit of a live record. I wanted it to feel like a band. Not a studio record full of different session musicians. I wanted it to be cohesive even though the songs are different. Producing on our own was a decision we made. We wanted to make it sound how we wanted it to sound. It was also out of necessity. I’m so happy with the outcome and so proud of us for doing it ourselves. I’d love to get us out of my mini van, we’ve been touring in that van for 10 years. We don’t have a crew, a sound engineer, or any of those things. My goal is to get our music out to as many people as possible and hopefully those people will connect with it.”\n\nhttps://mikaeladavis.bandcamp.com/music\n\nMikaela Davis “And Southern Star” Kill Rock Stars Records 2023\n\nFeature Photo: Wyndham Garnett\n\nCircles Around the Sun’s (CATS) fourth album “Language” officially completes the changing of the guard on guitar for the band. John Lee Shannon has cemented himself as the replacement for CATS founder Neal Casal giving the band a consistent sound and direction after eight years of chaos and uncertainty that would have sunk any project, musical or otherwise.\n\nShannon sparkles as he continues the cosmic disco groove the band created in their 2020 self-titled release. CATS initially turned to jam band heavyweights Eric Krasno and then Scott Metzger to fill in for Casal after his passing in 2019. Both musicians left their unique stamp on the band’s sound in their brief time and kept CATS moving forward. With two seemingly ideal replacements for Casal, scheduling and an unprecedented global pandemic created two immovable roadblocks that would end both musicians’ journey before they had a chance to get started.\n\nThose are just two roadblocks that have caused CATS to stop and start multiple times since their formation in 2015. Ironically, after all the roadblocks, wrong turns, or dead ends, Shannon was Casal’s choice to replace him from the start. According to keyboardist Adam MacDougall, Casal let it be known he wanted Shannon as his replacement in a note he left for the band before his passing.\n\nIn Part 2 of Slide&Banjo’s in depth interview with MacDougall, he reflects on the early days of CATS with Casal and how they were able to trampoline into the middle of the jam band universe. “It’s amazing considering we didn’t tour much for most of our career. Neal and I were in Chris Robinson Brotherhood and that band stayed on the road a lot. We didn’t have time to tour with CATS. We were super lucky that hundreds of thousands of people were listening to the Fare Thee Well shows. We had a huge leg up and the band couldn’t have existed without that. We could tour nationally without having to make a name for ourselves. We could get a couple of hundred people into a club in the middle of the country without any real legwork. We had been a band for two years before we played ten shows. It wasn’t until right before Neal passed, we started taking it seriously.”\n\nMacDougall continues, “The beginning was literally a bunch of guys who had never played together in a room trying to find a couple of chord changes we can bop around on for the next 15 minutes. We never did that again. The second record was more composed. We had a lot of ideas from touring after the first record. We were coming up with lots of stuff from soundchecks. A lot of the jams from the first record were turning into things. We were like this jam section is totally new. It’s not on the first record. We can make a new song out of this. That’s how the second record happened.”\n\nAs the band buckled down and hit the road, their future was literally traveling in the same van. “That’s how we met John.” MacDougall remembers. “That’s why it took me a while to see how he can do what he’s doing in CATS. John and (current Grateful Shred guitarist) Zeph Ohora came on tour with us. I had only known John playing acoustic. They opened for CATS. After every show he would sit there and play this nylon string guitar for hours. Neal would sit there and drool on that shit he couldn’t do.”\n\nWith two albums and several tours of their trippy take on the Grateful Dead, CATS met up with drummer Joe Russo in the studio. The resulting 2019 EP “Circles Around the Sun Meets Joe Russo” (Royal Potato Family) was a dramatic departure from the extended spacy jams the band had been creating. Instead, the improvised studio session created a tight, super fast paced sound the band had never approached before. It was an eye opener. CATS was way more than a one trick pony only capable of trippy “Interludes for the Dead.”\n\nMacDougall points directly at Russo for getting the most out of everyone during those sessions. “That was all Russo. We were trying to get it going in the studio. Nothing was happening and it was lame. We were listening to stuff in the control room. Russo gets up and goes “C’mon guys, fuck this shit.” He riled us up. “Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.” And that’s when it happened. He got frustrated with us being, is this cool or is that cool. He was like, “Fuck you guys, let’s go play.” He was so aggressive about playing, we all fell right in. He literally yelled at us and all the stuff we used on the record happened after that.”\n\nCasal passed in August 2019 at the same time this EP was released. Unfortunately causing one of CATS best musical efforts to go unnoticed as the music world mourned the loss of one of its most well respected ambassadors.\n\nIf not for a note Casal left for the band expressing his desire for CATS to continue, things would have shut down right here. The band that was never meant to be a band had a good run. They created their own genre of music. Rode its wave for a bit. Now they could go back to their pre-CATS musical ventures. But Neal’s instructions were clear, and MacDougall, Dan Horne, and Mark Levy were set on finding a replacement and fulfilling one of Casal’s last wishes.\n\nThe trio first turned to Eric Krasno to cover the tour dates they had on the books. As the calendar moved into 2020, Scott Metzger took over on guitar. CATS third life set out on a winter tour filled with great music and a great atmosphere each night. With Metzger on board, the founding members were sure they had found Casal’s replacement. They could fulfill his wish and keep CATS rolling.\n\nJust when life looked like easy street for the revamped band, Covid stepped in, and the world along w"
