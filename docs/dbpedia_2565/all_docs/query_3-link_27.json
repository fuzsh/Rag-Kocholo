        "text": "He was born Alfred Hawthorn Hill. It was his grandfather who introduced him to Burlesque Shows and the theatre from where the young Benny Hill was to draw much of his comic inspiration. After his national service with the army during WW2, Benny came to London, adopted the stage name Benny Hill (in homage to his all time favourite comedian Jack Benny) and began appearing in variety shows. He briefly formed a double act with Reg Varney and did radio shows. But it was his talent for impressions and comic timing that were to give him his first big break on TV with the show \"Hi There\" in 1949. The Benny Hill Show (1955) began in 1955. Its pioneering combination of cheeky humour, songs and impressions were to make it a hit for the next 40 years.\n\nBenny also broadened his career with cameo appearances in films such as Charlie staubt Millionen ab (1969), Tschitti Tschitti Bäng Bäng (1968) and Die tollkühnen Männer in ihren fliegenden Kisten (1965). He also had a hit record in 1971 with \"Ernie The Fastest Milkman In The West\". In 1979 The Benny Hill Show (1955) was shown in America for the first time and Benny went on to become one of the biggest stars on US TV. The show itself has been seen in 109 countries and won a BAFTA as well as Golden Rose Of Montreaux Award. Benny Hill's TV career came to an end in 1989, when his show was dropped, but his popularity continued and he completed a US TV special, Benny Hill in New York (1991) shortly before his death in 1992.\n\nLaurie Holden is best known to audiences as Andrea in the hit AMC drama series The Walking Dead. However, Laurie's big acting break came much earlier in her career, starring with Vanessa Redgrave in the critically acclaimed TNT mini-series Young Catherine. Since that auspicious beginning, she has appeared in several groundbreaking television series, including seminal roles on FOX's The X-Files, FX's The Shield, and currently FX's The Americans. Holden's big screen debut found her starring alongside Jim Carrey in Frank Darabont's The Majestic. The 1950's period piece earned Holden critical acclaim and a place on Entertainment Weekly's \"100 Most Creative People in Entertainment\" list and Variety's \"Ten Actors To Watch\" list. Laurie entered the comic book world when she co-starred opposite Michael Chiklis in Fox's Fantastic Four and then ventured into the gamer genre with her starring role as the iconic Cybil Bennett opposite Sean Bean in Christophe Gans' cult horror classic Silent Hill. She also starred with Thomas Jane and Marcia Gay Harden in Stephen King's sci-fi thriller The Mist and in the Farrelly Brothers' Dumb and Dumber To with Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. She will soon be seen in Adam MacDonald's Pyewacket with Nicole Munoz and will be voicing the role of \"Dakota\" in the animated feature Arctic Justice: Thunder Squad. In 2011, Holden received two Best Supporting Actress nominations for her work on The Walking Dead: one from Spike TV's Scream Awards and another from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films' Saturn Awards. She won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for The Walking Dead in 2013. Earlier in her career, she also received a Best Actress nomination from the Genie Awards (Canada's equivalent to the Emmys) for her guest- starring role on the Canadian comedy hit Due South. In 2014, Holden executive produced her first motion picture: Rebecca Johnson's critically acclaimed film Honeytrap, which garnered a nomination at the London Film Festival, received U.S distribution through Ava DuVernay's film collective ARRAY, and can currently be streamed on Netflix. Laurie is also an Executive Producer on The Time of Their Lives (Bright Pictures/Daryl Prince Productions) starring Dame Joan Collins, Pauline Collins, Franco Nero and Joely Richardson. The film will be distributed by Universal in most world markets, starting with its 2017 cinema release in the UK on March 10th. Holden is also a human rights activist, and dedicates much of her time and effort to enriching and protecting the lives of women and children victimized by the sex trade. Through her philanthropic work with Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.) a non-profit organization dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery, she volunteered in the field in Cartagena, Colombia with O.U.R. on a mission that helped liberate 55 young sex slaves and brought down notorious sex trafficker Marcus Bronschidle. The successful sting operation was featured on ABC's Nightline and is the subject of an upcoming documentary entitled The Abolitionists. Holden serves on the Board of Alamasi Collaborative Arts, a Zimbabwean dramatic arts collaborative. She also actively supports HomeFromHome, a South African non-profit NGO that provides shelter and education for orphans infected and afflicted by HIV.\n\nKnown for his breakthrough starring role on Voll daneben, voll im Leben (1999), James Franco was born April 19, 1978 in Palo Alto, California, to Betsy Franco, a writer, artist, and actress, and Douglas Eugene \"Doug\" Franco, who ran a Silicon Valley business. His mother is Jewish and his father was of Portuguese and Swedish descent.\n\nGrowing up with his two younger brothers, Dave Franco, also an actor, and Tom Franco, James graduated from Palo Alto High School in 1996 and went on to attend UCLA, majoring in English. To overcome his shyness, he got into acting while studying there, which, much to his parents' dismay, he left after only one year. After fifteen months of intensive study at Robert Carnegie's Playhouse West, James began actively pursuing his dream of finding work as an actor in Hollywood. In that short time, he landed himself a starring role on Voll daneben, voll im Leben (1999). The show, however, was not a hit to its viewers at the time, and was canceled after its first year. Now, it has become a cult-hit. Prior to joining Voll daneben, voll im Leben (1999), Franco starred in the TV miniseries Tage voller Blut - Die Bestie von Dallas (1999). After that, he had a starring role in Hoffnungslos verliebt (2000).\n\nAlthough he'd been working steadily, it wasn't until the TNT made-for-television movie, James Dean - Ein Leben auf der Überholspur (2001) that James rose to fan-magazine fame and got to show off his talent. Since then, he has been working non-stop. After losing the lead role to Tobey Maguire, James settled for the part of \"Harry Osborne\", Spider-Man's best friend in the summer 2002 major hit Spider-Man (2002). He returned to the Osborne role for the next two films in the trilogy.\n\nNext was Deuces Wild - Wild in den Straßen (2002) and City by the Sea (2002), in which Robert De Niro personally had him cast, after viewing his performance in James Dean - Ein Leben auf der Überholspur (2001). He was seen in David Gordon Green's Ananas Express (2008) opposite Seth Rogen, in George C. Wolfe's Das Lächeln der Sterne (2008), starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane and in Paul Haggis' Im Tal von Elah (2007), starring Tommy Lee Jones. Also starring opposite Sean Penn in Gus Van Sant's Milk (2008) in which his performance earned him an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor. Definitely growing out of his shyness, James Franco is turning into a legend of his own.\n\nJennifer Connelly was born in the Catskill Mountains, New York, to Ilene (Schuman), a dealer of antiques, and Gerard Connelly, a clothing manufacturer. Her father had Irish and Norwegian ancestry, and her mother was from a Jewish immigrant family. Jennifer grew up in Brooklyn Heights, just across the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan, except for the four years her parents spent in Woodstock, New York. Back in Brooklyn Heights, she attended St. Ann's school. A close friend of the family was an advertising executive. When Jennifer was ten, he suggested that her parents take her to a modeling audition. She began appearing in newspaper and magazine ads (among them \"Seventeen\" magazine), and soon moved on to television commercials. A casting director saw her and introduced her to Sergio Leone, who was seeking a young girl to dance in his gangster epic Es war einmal in Amerika (1984). Although having little screen time, the few minutes she was on-screen were enough to reveal her talent. Her next role after that was an episode of the British horror anthology TV series Die unglaublichen Geschichten von Roald Dahl (1979) in 1984.\n\nAfter Leone's movie, horror master Dario Argento signed her to play her first starring role in his thriller Phenomena (1985). The film made a lot of money in Europe but, unfortunately, was heavily cut for American distribution. Around the same time, she appeared in the rock video \"I Drove All Night,\" a Roy Orbison song, co-starring Jason Priestley. She released a single called \"Monologue of Love\" in Japan in the mid-1980s, in which she sings in Japanese a charming little song with semi-classical instruments arrangement. On the B-side is \"Message Of Love,\" which is an interview with music in background. She also appeared in television commercials in Japan.\n\nShe enrolled at Yale, and then transferred two years later to Stanford. She trained in classical theater and improvisation, studying with the late drama coach Roy London, Howard Fine, and Harold Guskin.\n\nThe late 1980s saw her starring in a hit and three lesser seen films. Amongst the latter was her roles in Ballet (1989), as a ballerina and in Some Girls (1988), where she played a self-absorbed college freshman. The hit was Die Reise ins Labyrinth (1986), released in 1986. Jennifer got the job after a nationwide talent search for the lead in this fantasy directed by Jim Henson and produced by George Lucas. Her career entered in a calm phase after those films, until Dennis Hopper, who was impressed after having seen her in \"Some Girls\", cast Jennifer as an ingénue small-town girl in The Hot Spot - Spiel mit dem Feuer (1990), based upon the 1950s crime novel \"Hell Hath No Fury\". It received mixed critical reviews, but it was not a box office success.\n\nRocketeer (1991), an ambitious Touchstone super-production, came to the rescue. The film was an old-fashioned adventure flick about a man capable of flying with rockets on his back. Critics saw in \"Rocketeer\" a top-quality movie, a homage to those old films of the 1930s in which the likes of Errol Flynn starred. After \"Rocketeer,\" Jennifer made Kevins Cousin allein im Supermarkt (1991), Im Herzen der Rache (1992), Nach eigenen Regeln (1996), her first collaboration with Nick Nolte and Die Abbotts - Wenn Haß die Liebe tötet (1997). In 1998, she was invited by director Alex Proyas to make Dark City (1998), a strange, visually stunning science-fiction extravaganza. In this movie, Jennifer played the main character's wife, and she delivered an acclaimed performance. The film itself didn't break any box-office record but received positive reviews. This led Jennifer to a contract with Fox for the television series The $treet - Wer bietet mehr? (2000), a main part in the memorable and dramatic love-story Im Auftrag der Toten (2000) and, more important, a breakthrough part in the polemic and applauded independent Requiem for a Dream (2000), a tale about the haunting lives of drug addicts and the subsequent process of decadence and destruction. In \"Requiem for a Dream,\" Jennifer had her career's most courageous, difficult part, a performance that earned her a Spirit Award Nomination. She followed this role with Pollock (2000), in which she played Pollock's mistress, Ruth Klingman. In 2001, Ron Howard chose her to co-star with Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind: Genie und Wahnsinn (2001), the film that tells the true story of John Nash, a man who suffered from mental illness but eventually beats this and wins the Nobel Prize in 1994. Jennifer played Nash's wife and won a Golden Globe, BAFTA, AFI and Oscar as Best Supporting Actress. Connelly continued her career with films including Hulk (2003), her second collaboration with Nick Nolte, Dark Water - Dunkle Wasser (2005), Blood Diamond (2006), Der Tag, an dem die Erde stillstand (2008), Er steht einfach nicht auf Dich (2009) and Noah (2014), where she did her second collaboration with both Darren Aronofsky and Russell Crowe and made her third collaboration with Nick Nolte in that same film.\n\nJennifer lives in New York. She is 5'7\", and speaks fluent Italian and French. She enjoys physical activities such as swimming, gymnastics, and bike riding. She is also an outdoors person -- camping, hiking and walking, and is interested in quantum physics and philosophy. She likes horses, Pearl Jam, SoundGarden, Jesus Jones, and occasionally wears a small picture of the The Dalai Lama on a necklace. Her favorite colors are cobalt blue, forest green, and \"very pale green/gray -- sort of like the color of the sea\". She likes to draw.\n\nRose McGowan is an American actress and director, known for her contribution to independent film. Since the age of nineteen, she has appeared in acclaimed films by Gregg Araki, Wes Craven, Brian De Palma, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. In 2014, her directorial debut Dawn (2014) was nominated for the Short Film Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. Rose Arianna McGowan was born on September 5, 1973 in Florence, Tuscany, Italy, to American parents Terri and Daniel Patrick McGowan. She is the second eldest of six siblings, and has Irish, French, and English ancestry. As a young child, she was raised within the Italian chapter of the Children of God. During the early 1980s, her family severed ties with the community and migrated to Eugene, Oregon, USA. Following the divorce of her parents, Rose relocated to Gig Harbor, Washington, to live with her grandmother. At age 14, McGowan was accused of drug use by a family friend and committed to rehabilitation. She has consistently maintained the decision was unjustified. Upon release, she spent a year without a home and was emancipated from her parents by the age of 15. McGowan's career as an actor began with Generation der Verdammten (1995). Originally intended for Jordan Ladd, the character of Amy Blue was, coincidentally, awarded to McGowan by an associate of director Gregg Araki. For her performance, she was nominated at the 1995 Independent Spirit Awards for Best Debut Performance. Subsequently cast in Wes Craven's Scream - Schrei! (1996), she experienced further success when the project defied expectations to become one of the highest grossing films of the year. The innovative career of McGowan was overshadowed throughout much of the 1990s by her high-profile relationship with musician Brian Warner (aka Marilyn Manson). Strong performances in Der lange Weg der Leidenschaft (1997), Lewis & Clark & George (1997), Southie (1998) and Der zuckersüße Tod (1999) were largely unseen by the general public. When the relationship ended between Rose and Manson in 2001, she remarked: \"There is great love, but our lifestyle difference is, unfortunately, even greater\". Rose continued to work solidly, appearing in a string of soft-sounding studio and independent films. Performances from this period included: a political activist in Showtime's Killing Yard - Mörderischer Auftrag (2001), a grifter in Strange Hearts (2002) and a factory worker in \"Stealing Bess\" (aka Vacuums (2003)). She was re-introduced to the mainstream as Paige Matthews in Aaron Spelling's Charmed: Zauberhafte Hexen (1998), a popular television series for which she devoted five consecutive years. When \"Charmed\" finished its run in 2006, McGowan emerged in top form. Critics praised her efforts in Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror (2007), and Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof - Todsicher (2007). In several interviews, McGowan has expressed a general apathy and disdain for Hollywood. Despite this, her work ethic remains strong. Following her recent marriage to LA-based artist Davey Detail, the actress has resolved to purse further projects as a director.\n\nMichael Joseph Jackson was born on August 29, 1958 in Gary, Indiana, and entertained audiences nearly his entire life. His father, Joe Jackson (no relation to Joe Jackson, also a musician), had been a guitarist, but was forced to give up his musical ambitions following his marriage to Michael's mother Katherine Jackson (née Katherine Esther Scruse). Together, they prodded their growing family's musical interests at home. By the early 1960s, the older boys Jackie, Tito and Jermaine had begun performing around the city; by 1964, Michael and Marlon had joined in.\n\nA musical prodigy, Michael's singing and dancing talents were amazingly mature, and he soon became the dominant voice and focus of the Jackson 5. An opening act for such soul groups as the O-Jays and James Brown, it was Gladys Knight (not Diana Ross) who officially brought the group to Berry Gordy's attention, and by 1969, the boys were producing back-to-back chart-busting hits as Motown artists (\"I Want You Back,\" \"ABC,\" \"Never Can Say Goodbye,\" \"Got to Be There,\" etc.). As a product of the 1970s, the boys emerged as one of the most accomplished black pop / soul vocal groups in music history, successfully evolving from a group like The Temptations to a disco phenomenon.\n\nSolo success for Michael was inevitable, and by the 1980s, he had become infinitely more popular than his brotherly group. Record sales consistently orbited, culminating in the biggest-selling album of all time, \"Thriller\" in 1982. A TV natural, he ventured rather uneasily into films, such as playing the Scarecrow in The Wiz - Das zauberhafte Land (1978), but had much better luck with elaborate music videos.\n\nIn the 1990s, the downside as an 1980s pop phenomenon began to rear itself. Michael grew terribly child-like and introverted by his peerless celebrity. A rather timorous, androgynous figure to begin with, his physical appearance began to change drastically, and his behavior grew alarmingly bizarre, making him a consistent target for scandal-making, despite his numerous charitable acts. Two brief marriages -- one to Elvis Presley's daughter Lisa Marie Presley -- were forged and two children produced by his second wife during that time, but the purposes behind them appeared image-oriented.\n\nMichael Jackson died on June 25, 2009 in Los Angeles, California. His passion and artistry as a singer, dancer, writer and businessman were unparalleled, and it is these prodigious talents that will ultimately prevail over the extremely negative aspects of his troubled adult life.\n\nMatt Dillon's successful film career has spanned over three decades and has showcased his wide range of dramatic and comedic talents. Dillon displayed his versatility with an arresting performance co-starring as a racist cop in the critically acclaimed Paul Haggis film Crash. This role earned him nominations for an Academy award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Critics Choice Award, BAFTA Award and won him an Independent Spirit Award. In addition, the film earned him a Screen Actors Guild Award and a Critics Choice Award for Best Ensemble. As the New York Times' Film Critic A.O. Scott put it, \"He seems to be getting better with every film.\"\n\nHe starred opposite Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson in Universal Pictures' comedy, You, Me and Dupree and in Factotum for which he received glowing reviews for portraying Charles Bukowski's alter ego when the film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. From his breakthrough performance in The Outsiders to his hilarious turn as an obsessed private investigator in There's Something About Mary, he has proven himself to be one of the most diverse actors of his generation.\n\nIn 1990 Dillon won an IFP Spirit Award for his gritty performance as a drug addict in Gus Van Sant's Drugstore Cowboy.
