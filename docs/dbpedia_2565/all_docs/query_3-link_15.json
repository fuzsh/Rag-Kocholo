        "text": "Dave Loggins\n\nGrammy-nominated singer-songwriter, Dave Loggins, passed away on July 10, 2024. He was 76.\n\nDave Loggins\n\nGrammy-nominated singer-songwriter, Dave Loggins, passed away on July 10. He was 76. A Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee, his most celebrated successes were his 1974 pop hit, “Please Come to Boston,” and the No. 1 country duet, “Nobody Loves Me Like You Do,” alongside Anne Murray. A Tennessee native, Loggins released five studio albums as an artist, garnering modest hits with “You’re Got Me to Hold on To” and “Pieces of April.” The former eventually became a Top 10 country hit for Tanya Tucker, while the latter was a Top 20 pop success for Three Dog Night. Turning his attention to songwriting, Loggins found his stride over the course of five decades, notching 14 No. 1s with Wynonna Judd’s “She Is His Only Need,” The Oak Ridge Boys’ “Every Day,” Alabama’s “Forty Hour Week (For a Living),” Reba McEntire’s “Love Will Find Its Way to You” and Kenny Rogers’ “Morning Desire,” among others. With songs recorded by the likes of Jimmy Buffett, Tammy Wynette, Vince Gill, Loretta Lynn, Hank Williams Jr., Willie Nelson, Ray Charles and Johnny Cash, Loggins was awarded 25 ASCAP Awards, as well as named the ASCAP Country Songwriter of the Year in 1987. Nominated for the ACM Top Vocal Duet in 1984 and the ACM Song of the Year in 1985 for penning Gary Morris’ “I’ll Never Stop Loving You,” he also wrote “Augusta,” which became the longest - running sports theme song in history for the annual Masters Golf Tournament.\n\nJoe Bonsall\n\nJoe Bonsall, the tenor singer in the Oak Ridge Boys and one of Country Music’s most enthusiastic entertainers, passed away from complications of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis on July 9, 2024. He was 76.\n\nJoe Bonsall\n\nJoe Bonsall, the tenor singer in the Oak Ridge Boys and one of Country Music’s most enthusiastic entertainers, passed away from complications of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis on July 9, 2024. He was 76. Bonsall was born on May 18, 1948, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As a teenager, he sang with a gospel group called the Faith Four, and befriended Richard Sterban, another gospel singer from the area. Sterban joined the Oaks in 1972, followed by Bonsall a year later. After making a minimal impact on Columbia Records, the group switched to ABC/Dot, where they finally broke out with 1977’s “Y’All Come Back Saloon.” The Oaks received 1978 ACM Awards in the categories of Album (for Y’All Come Back Saloon) and Top Vocal Group.\n\nBonsall brought an infectious energy to the quartet, which had deep roots in gospel music yet still appealed to country listeners. Between 1977 and 1991, the Oaks charted 34 Top 10 singles, with 17 of those reaching No. 1 at country radio. They performed one of their most eloquent singles, a rendition of Rodney Crowell’s “Leaving Louisiana in the Broad Daylight,” on the ACM Awards in 1980, the same year it reached No. 1.\n\nThe Oaks’ visibility soared with 1981’s “Elvira,” a Dallas Frazier composition that had been cut several times before the Oaks turned it into a smash for MCA Records and a pop crossover hit. Their irresistible performance netted a Grammy Award and an ACM Single of the Year trophy. With that momentum, they racked up chart-topping hits like “Fancy Free,” “Bobbie Sue,” “American Made, “Gonna Take a Lot of River,” and “No Matter How High.” Bonsall also recorded “Out Goin’ Cattin’” with Sawyer Brown, with the peppy single rising to No. 11 in 1986.\n\nIn recognition of their exceptional career, the Oak Ridge Boys received the 2007 Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award. They were inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in 2011 and the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2015. Bonsall’s book about the band, On the Road with the Oak Ridge Boys: Forty Years of Untold Stories and Adventures, was published in 2015.\n\nMary Martin\n\nBeloved music industry veteran Mary Martin passed away on July 4, 2024. She was 85\n\nMary Martin\n\nBeloved music industry veteran Mary Martin passed away on July 4. She was 85. An inductee into the SOURCE Hall of Fame, she was a lauded talent scout, manager and record executive who played a critical role in the careers of Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Emmylou Harris, Bonnie Raitt, Van Morrison, Rodney Crowell, Keith Urban and Vince Gill, among a long list of others. Born in 1939 in Toronto, Canada, Martin’s illustrious career began as an executive assistant to artist manager Albert Grossman, who shepherded the careers of Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, Peter, Paul & Mary and more. Starting her own venture in 1966, Martin eventually made her way to the A&R department at Warner Bros., as well as became the VP of RCA Records where she oversaw the careers of acts like Vince Gill, Clint Black, Paul Overstreet, Aaron Tippin, and Lorrie Morgan. After a brief stint as the Executive Director of Earth Communications Office, she served as an A&R consultant for Asylum Records before being tapped as Vice President of Mercury Records until 2002. With a keen eye for burgeoning talent and a fierce belief in artist’s and their craft, Martin was also a Grammy-winning producer, thanks to her work on the star-studded Hank Williams tribute album, Timeless, featuring Dylan, Johnny Cash, Keith Richards, Tom Petty and others.\n\nJoe Scaife\n\nBeloved studio engineer, record producer and music publisher, Joe Scaife, passed away on June 12, 2024. He was 68 years old.\n\nJoe Scaife\n\nBeloved studio engineer, record producer and music publisher, Joe Scaife, passed away on June 12. He was 68 years old.\n\nScaife earned a degree in Music Engineering and Recording from Nashville's Belmont University, getting his first taste of success with K.T. Oslin's 1987 hit, “80’s Ladies.” This led to a long string of recording sessions with some of the genre’s top-tier vocalists, including Montgomery Gentry, Vince Gill, Reba McEntire, Alabama, Glen Campbell, Lionel Richie, Emmylou Harris, Waylon Jennings, George Jones, Shania Twain and Toby Keith, among others. As a producer, Scaife was one of the creative masterminds behind massive projects like Billy Ray Cyrus' debut record, Some Gave All, which included his breakout hit, \"Achy Breaky Heart,\" as well as Gretchen Wilson's breakthrough Here For The Party, featuring her career-defining \"Redneck Woman.\"\n\nAcross his career, Scaife sold more than 80 million records and garnered over two billion streams. With a sprawling list of awards and accolades to his name, he received six nominations as a producer from the ACM. Among them are three nods for Album of the Year (Here for the Party - Gretchen Wilson, 2004; It Won't Be the Last - Billy Ray Cyrus, 1993; Some Gave All - Billy Ray Cyrus, 1992), two Single Record of the Year nominations (\"Redneck Woman\" - Gretchen Wilson, 2004; \"Achy Breaky Heart\" - Billy Ray Cyrus, 1992) and one for Video of the Year (\"Redneck Woman\" - Gretchen Wilson, 2004).\n\nMark James\n\nNashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and National Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee, Mark James, died on June 8, 2024. He was 83 years old.\n\nMark James\n\nNashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and National Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee, Mark James, died on June 8, 2024 at the age of 83.\n\nPenning more than 200 songs throughout his career with several enduring hits sprinkled in, James’ first taste of success came with B.J. Thomas' “The Eyes of a New York Woman,” followed shortly after by “Hooked on a Feeling” and “It’s Only Love.” After writing and releasing his own version of “Suspicious Minds,” which garnered little success, it was later famously recorded by Elvis Presley. It became the superstar’s last No. 1 hit and led to other late-career cuts from James, including “Raised on Rock” and “Moody Blue.” Elsewhere across his career, James wrote “Always on My Mind,” originally performed by Brenda Lee. A decade later Willie Nelson turned it into a country crossover smash, nabbing the Song of the Year and Country Song of the Year at the 1983 Grammy Awards.\n\nWith songs recorded by the likes of Dwight Yoakam, B.B. King, Eddy Arnold, Charlie McCoy, The Partridge Family, Ronnie Milsap and more, James' music has also been heard across a wide range of films, including Reservoir Dogs, Guardians of the Galaxy, Black Hawk Down, Kramer Vs Kramer, Honeymoon in Vegas, Breathless, Someone to Watch Over Me, Practical Magic and Frequency.\n\nErv Woolsey\n\nErv Woolsey, a former music executive, entrepreneur, and longtime manager for Country Music Hall of Fame member, George Strait, died on March 20, 2024, due to complications from surgery. He was 80.\n\nErv Woolsey\n\nErv Woolsey, a former music executive, entrepreneur, and longtime manager for Country Music Hall of Fame member, George Strait, died on March 20, 2024, due to complications from surgery. He was 80.\n\nBorn Eugene Ervine Woolsey, the Texas native began his career in the music industry in Decca Records' promotion department. Making his way to Nashville in 1973, he took on the role of Head of Promotions for ABC Records’ Country division. From there, he moved to MCA during the 1980s, working closely with an array of acts, including future Country Music Hall of Famers Barbara Mandrell, Loretta Lynn, Tanya Tucker, Conway Twitty, and more, before leaving the records industry in 1984 to manage then up-and-comer George Strait. The pair enjoyed a nearly five decades long partnership that saw Strait become one of the most revered artists in Country Music history. With Woolsey by his side, Strait secured two ACM Entertainer of the Year awards, as well as notched more than 60 No. 1 songs and sold over 105 million albums.\n\nWoolsey's mark on modern Country Music extends beyond just Strait, also managing a number of hitmakers throughout his career, including Dierks Bentley, Ronnie Milsap, Clay Walker, and Lee Ann Womack. More recently, his lengthy management roster also featured Ian Munsick, Kylie Frey, and Leftover Salmon founder Vince Herman, among others.\n\nFran Boyd\n\nFran Boyd, a former Executive Director of the ACM and an essential player in shaping and growing the organization from its early years in California in the late-1960s through the start of the millennium, passed away on March 9, 2024. She was 84 years old.\n\nFran Boyd\n\nFran Boyd, a former Executive Director of the ACM and an essential player in shaping and growing the organization from its early years in California in the late-1960s through the start of the millennium, passed away on March 9, 2024. She was 84 years old.\n\nFran became the Academy’s first paid employee when she was hired as an executive secretary in 1968 and worked her way through the ranks over the years, overseeing daily operations of the organization, serving as Talent Producer of the ACM Awards, and maintaining oversight of virtually every aspect of the annual awards presentation. In 1995, following the passing of her husband Bill, who himself led the Academy, Fran was named Executive Director.\n\nAt the time of her retirement in 2002, she said, “I continue to be proud of all the Academy of Country Music has accomplished in my time. It has given me great joy to see so many young Country artists rise from newcomers to having great careers. The Academy has helped music fans acknowledge Country Music as the enduring genre it deserves to be.”\n\nThe Academy’s signature “hat” trophy was created the same year Fran Boyd joined the Academy, and throughout her tenure, she saw the organization open its first office in Hollywood, CA, refresh its name from the Academy of Country and Western Music to the Academy of Country Music in the early 1970s, and move the awards show to a number of major California venues, including Disneyland, Universal Amphitheatre, and Knott’s Berry Farm.\n\n“Her tireless work and years of dedication to this organization, the Country Music industry and its artists cannot be overstated, and her legacy with the Academy will forever live on,” said Damon Whiteside, CEO of the Academy of Country Music.\n\n“Fran Boyd played an essential part in the Academy’s history, stretching way back to the earliest days in the 1960s and steering the ship through decades of change, innovation, and growth, all while fostering an incredible passion for Country Music,” said Gayle Holcomb, ACM Board Sergeant-At-Arms and longtime Board member. “Fran will always be remembered as a champion for our industry, its artists, and this organization. On behalf of the ACM Officers and Board of Directors, I send our gratitude, prayers, and condolences to the Boyd family.”\n\nToby Keith\n\nToby Keith, a Country Music superstar who wrote many of his biggest hits, passed away on February 5, 2024. He was 62 years old. A 14-time ACM Award recipient, including multiple wins for ACM Top Male Vocalist and ACM Album of the Year, he was named ACM Entertainer of the Year twice, in 2002 and 2003.\n\nToby Keith\n\nToby Keith, a Country Music superstar who wrote many of his biggest hits, passed away on February 5, 2024. He was 62 years old. A 14-time ACM Award recipient, including multiple wins for ACM Top Male Vocalist and ACM Album of the Year, he was named ACM Entertainer of the Year twice, in 2002 and 2003. With worldwide sales of more than 40 million albums, he built an exceptional career on well-sung ballads, barroom singalongs, and patriotic anthems, as well as heartfelt songwriting.\n\nBorn on July 8, 1961, in Clinton, Oklahoma, Toby Keith Covel grew up in the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore. As a boy, he discovered live music by listening to the bands at his grandmother’s supper club in Fort Smith, Arkansas. After high school graduation, he worked in the oil fields while playing regional gigs fronting the Easy Money Band. When the oil industry crumbled in the early ‘80s, Keith signed on with the Oklahoma City Drillers semipro football team for two years before deciding to focus on music. Although the major labels in Nashville ignored his demo, a fan of the band who worked as a flight attendant gave a copy to Harold Shedd, a Mercury Records executive who was on her flight. Shedd heard the potential, traveled to Oklahoma for a show, and signed him to Mercury.\n\nWith the Dallas Cowboys winning the Super Bowl just weeks before the single’s release date, “Should’ve Been a Cowboy” took on a new meaning. By summer of 1993, it spent two weeks at No. 1 and paved the way for a dozen more Top 10 hits on Mercury (and affiliated labels Polygram and A&M). Keith returned to No. 1 with 1994’s “Who’s That Man” and 1997’s “Me Too.” A duet with Sting on “I’m So Happy I Can’t Stop Crying” earned an ACM nomination for Vocal Event and reached No. 2 at Country radio.\n\nBy signing with DreamWorks Nashville, Keith’s outspoken personality could finally shine through. In 2000, “How Do You Like Me Now?!” lodged itself at No. 1 for five weeks. In addition, he was named 2000 ACM Male Vocalist of the Year and picked up Album of the Year (as an artist and producer) for the project of the same name. More hits rolled in, notably a comical Bobby Braddock composition titled “I Wanna Talk About Me.” That single spent five weeks at No. 1, as did its follow-up, “My List.” Yet, amid a backdrop of the 9/11 attacks and the Iraq War, Keith certainly made the biggest impression with “Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)” and its audacious threat to “put a boot up your ass, it’s the American way.” Its notoriety helped Keith claim the 2002 ACM Entertainer of the Year award.\n\nKeith’s winning streak raged on. “Who’s Your Daddy?” became his sixth consecutive chart-topping single in 2003. A Willie Nelson duet titled “Beer for My Horses” spent six weeks at No. 1, earned a 2003 Video of the Year award, and inspired a movie that received the ACM Tex Ritter Award. That same year, Keith collected his second ACM Entertainer, Male Vocalist, and Album of the Year trophies, the latter for Shock ‘N Y’All.\n\nKeith continued to offer a steady stream of radio-ready singles and accrued his 20th No. 1 hit, “Made in America,” in 2011. Although he’d released plenty of irreverent songs before, few listeners were prepared for the overwhelming reception of “Red Solo Cup,” a viral party anthem that soon crossed over into the mainstream and claimed the 2011 ACM Video of the Year award. A year later, “Beers Ago” became his 41st Top 10 Country hit.\n\nMarking his 20th ACM Awards appearance in 2018, Keith was joined by Blake Shelton to sing “Should’ve Been a Cowboy.” In addition, he appeared in the network specials George Strait: ACM Artist of the Decade All Star Concert in 2009 and ACM Presents: An All-Star Salute to the Troops in 2014. The Academy presented Keith with multiple honorary awards throughout his career, including the 2013 ACM Career Achievement Award, the 2016 ACM Poets Award, and the 2020 ACM Merle Haggard Spirit Award. Keith was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2015 and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2021. Other distinctions include the 2021 National Medal of Arts and the 2022 BMI Icon Award.\n\nKeith’s many charitable initiatives included 11 USO Tours and nearly 300 USO events, a hometown fundraising concert following a devastating 2013 tornado, and an annual golf tournament to fund the OK Kids Korral, a cost-free home in Oklahoma City for families of children with critical illnesses.\n\n\"Toby Keith was a powerhouse singer-songwriter, performer, entrepreneur, and Country Music icon who defined the last several decades of Country Music and influenced a generation of talent,” said ACM CEO Damon Whiteside. “Here at the Academy, we’ve been able to celebrate Toby countless times over the years, including twice as our ACM Entertainer of the Year, along with more than a dozen of other trophies, such as the ACM Poet’s Award for songwriting and the ACM Career Achievement Award. In particular, I’m so glad we were able to honor Toby with the ACM Spirit Award in 2021, presented to a singer-songwriter who continues the legacy of Merle Haggard, one of Toby’s heroes. Additionally, his phenomenal commitment to philanthropy and serving the community throughout his career echoes in the work of ACM Lifting Lives. On behalf of our staff, Board, and membership, we send our love to Toby’s family, friends, and fans of his incredible music.
