Julius August Cardinal Döpfner (August 26, 1913&mdash;July 24, 1976) was a German prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Munich and Freising from 1961 until his death, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1958.

Biography

Julius Döpfner was born in Hausen to Matthäus and Maria Döpfner. He was baptised two days later, on August 28. Döpfner had a sister, Maria, and two brothers, Paul and Otto. Entering the Augustinian-run "gymnasium" at Münnerstadt in 1924, he later attended the seminary of Würzburg and the Pontifical German-Hungarian College in Rome. Döpfner was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Luigi Traglia on October 29, 1939, and then finished his studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University, from where he obtained a doctorate in theology in 1941, writing his dissertation on John Henry Cardinal Newman. He worked as a chaplain in Großwallstadt until 1944.

On August 11, 1948, Döpfner was appointed Bishop of Würzburg by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 14 from Archbishop Joseph Kolb, with Bishops Joseph Schröffer and Arthur Landgraf serving as co-consecrators. At age 35, Döpfner was the youngest bishop in the Church at that time [Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church.

He was named Bishop of Berlin on January 15, 1957, and became the youngest member of the College of Cardinals when he was created Cardinal Priest of "S. Maria della Scala" by Pope John XXIII in the consistory of December 15, 1958. Promoted to Archbishop of Munich and Freising on July 3, 1961, Döpfner participated in the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), and sat on its Board of Presidency. Along with Raúl Cardinal Silva Henríquez, he assisted Léon-Etienne Cardinal Duval in delivering one of the closing messages of the Council on December 8, 1965 [Christus Rex.

The German prelate was one of the cardinal electors in the 1963 papal conclave, which selected Pope Paul VI.

From 1965 to 1976, Döpfner was Chairman of the Conference of the German Bishops and thus the spokesman of the Catholic Church in Germany. He was often described as "papabile", but he died at 8:00 a.m. in the archiepiscopal residence of Munich, at age 62.
