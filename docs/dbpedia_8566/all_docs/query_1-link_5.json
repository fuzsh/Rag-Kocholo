        "text": "Important concepts: short-term capital gains (STCG) and long-term capital gains (LTCG). STCG: capital gains or profit earned in a short period of time. LTCG: capital gains or profit earned over a long period of time. In case of debt mutual funds: Profits earned in less than 3 years from the time of investment = STCG. Profits earned in more than 3 years from the time of investment = LTCG. In case of equity mutual funds: Profits earned in less than 1 year from the time of investment = STCG. Profits earned in more than 1 year from the time of investment = LTCG. Example 1: if you invested in an equity mutual fund and withdrew after 2 years, your gains or profits will be called LTCG. Example 2: if you invested in a debt mutual fund and withdrew after 2 years, your gains or profits will be called STCG.\n\nNew Report: Business Relief (BR) Update ðŸš€ IHT receipts are on course for another record year and inheritance tax is again on everyoneâ€™s lips.

Answer five questions to find out! CBRE UK are supporting clients across the public and private sector to provide confidence in the expiry of their PFI contracts. We can offer the full range of services, from commercial analysis, condition surveys, technical due diligence, and valuations. We start with a health check to see how ready you are for expiry, and identify the key risks that you need to manage. Speak to myself or Simon Tanner to chat more about how you can prepare, and exit, your #PFI with confidence.\n\nHelpful advice here from CBRE, global experts in this issue. There's also a broader issue and opportunity, which feels particularly pertinent as local authorities and others grapple with immediate financial challenges. That's how PFI deals - and long term contracts generally - can be renegotiated for mutual benefit. Such deals are often treated as 'fire and forget' exercises, and a legacy issue for the current generation of LG leaders to shoulder. That needn't - shouldn't - be the case. Adjusting terms is possible wherever both sides can be made to see benefit. With PFI agreements now mostly long in the tooth, creative negotiators can often co-create deal design terms that fit the bill. The key is to think strategically and holistically to see the opportunity and shape the processes needed to get there. At Negotient, and alongside our partners at CBRE, we're increasingly talking with LG leaders and others to realise this opportunity, creating much-needed financial headroom while taking an intentional, risk-managed approach to subsequent contract exit. If you're a leader looking to explore this potential, please get in touch to hear how we could help.\n\nHelpful advice here from CBRE, global experts in this issue.
