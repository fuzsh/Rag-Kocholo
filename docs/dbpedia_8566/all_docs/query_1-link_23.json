        "text": "It is indeed terrible when you have to grow up without the care and love of your parents. This campaign is about giving such children hope, support and a chance at rebuilding their lives. Located in the Beed district of Maharashtra is a wonderful institution called the Balgram orphanage that takes care of such children.\n\nThere are currently 137 orphans who live here (as of 1 JULY 2022). They have lost their parents or have been abandoned by their family. These children need our support and love to grow into independent adults. They have very interesting dreams and ambitions and your support to this campaign will help them realise that and give them a secure future.\n\nREAD ABOUT THE STORIES AND DREAMS OF TWO OF THE CHILDREN HERE.\n\nTHE BACKGROUND :\n\nFrom the parched land of Beed, which finds it's name in the hundred most backward districts of India, comes a heartwarming story of an activist. Santosh Garje, at the age of 18, single-handedly set up the Aai Foundation and an orphanage named 'Balgram' with a hope of providing shelter to destitute children. This is located in a small village called Georai, in the Beed district of Maharashtra.\n\nSantosh Garje was the son of a cane-cutter from the drought-prone region of Beed notorious for farmer suicides. He lost his sister to domestic violence leaving her infant daughter as an orphan in Santosh’s care. This not only changed Santosh’s life but also the lives of many children who would now address him ‘Baba’. He quit his dream of becoming a school teacher and at the young age of 18, began an institution called Sahara Anathalay Pariwar later renamed Balgram with a aim to provide a better future to those innocent children who had faced similar destinies as his niece. This is how the Balgram orphanage was born.\n\nThe home takes care of the food, stay, education, medical care and clothing of all the children who live there.\n\nIt costs just INR 2500 to support a child for an entire month.\n\nAll funding has 80G tax benefits.\n\nTHE IMPACT YOU CAN MAKE :\n\nCOST BREAKDOWN :\n\nABOUT ME :\n\nMy name is Saksham Shukla. I am 14 years old and in Grade 9 at the Jamnabai Narsee School, Mumbai.\n\nI have undertaken this campaign because I think being able to impact the life of an orphan (who possibly is my age or younger) by giving them education, a place to stay, food, medicines, and other skills for an entire year would be incredible. This will definitely transform their lives and help them have a better future. Through this campaign, I want to create the same opportunity for all those less fortunate children so that they get good food, a safe place to stay, clothes, medical care and a great education. The fact that just INR 2500 can make a difference in the life of an orphaned child for an entire month made me realise that I must do something about it.\n\nPlease support my campaign as we can together transform the lives of many such children. The more funds we raise the more impact we can make.\n\nLet's transform their lives together.\n\nIN THE MEDIA :\n\nPICTURES OF CHILDREN AT BALGRAM :\n\nA VIDEO BY BALGRAM :\n\nLOCATION :\n\nTAX BENEFITS :\n\nFunding for this campaign is eligible for tax breaks as AAI FOUNDATION is a registered trust and you can avail of benefits under section 80G of the IT act. Foreign funding is NOT accepted.\n\nFEEDBACK THAT YOU GET :\n\nTo ensure that there is complete transparency I shall get a report from Balgram (this takes between 1 to 3 months usually after the funds are raised & transferred to them) telling me who benefitted from the funding. The details will then be posted on the UPDATES section of my campaign and will be in a format like the one below. As soon as I post an update, the platform will send an EMAIL alert to all the funders - i.e. to you. Click on the link on the email and you can read about which child benefitted. That's transparent right.\n\nThe below image is an example of the FEEDBACK FORMAT that we will be shared with all my funders."
