Though coping with the loss of a close one can be deeply personal, here are some steps that can help you to work through your grief over the loss of your loved one.\n\nAllow The Feelings\n\nAn emotional breakdown can happen when you lose a loved one, you may feel that you are getting crazy, but that's not the thing. It is ok to feel all the emotions. It's natural to feel this way. Gently remind yourself about the good memories you have with the loved one you have lost and understand that there is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" when it comes to your feelings.\n\nTake Some Support From Others\n\nWhile asking to be left alone after the loss of a loved one is normal, but you should always surround yourself with people who can make you comfortable, with whom you can share your feelings (good or bad). They can be either your friends, family, or anyone who is close to you. Taking support from others can help you deal with the loneliness that may seem alright but can actually lead to depression and sadness.\n\nIt Is 'OK' To Cry\n\nIt's important to know that every person has their own way of coping with the loss of a loved one. Allowing the process to take place is very important. Remember it is ok to cry. Also, you cannot put a time limit on your grief process. You can feel bad, cry, or even adore the memories for as long as you want. Some of the stages in this whole process can be Denial (you may get numb and refuse to accept the truth), Anger (your rage and anger may sweep in between the process of your grief), Depression ( a very common thing you may notice following your loved one's death and it is okay. just make sure to fight the condition and stay strong), the last stage is Acceptance (you slowly accept the truth and begin living with it)."
