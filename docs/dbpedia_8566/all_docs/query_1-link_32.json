        "text": "Nandan Mohanrao Nilekani was born in Bengaluru and received his bachelor’s degree from IIT Bombay. “My five years at IIT-Bombay were the defining experience of my life,” said Mr Nilekani. Mr Nilekani is well known for being an outstanding strategist, an excellent analytical thinker, and an extraordinary communicator. He co-founded Infosys, the most definitive software company to emerge from India. As an advisor on innovation to the National Payments Corporation of India, he played a critical role in the launch of UPI (Unified Payments Interface).\n\nAfter his outstanding success with Infosys, Mr Nilekani took on another mammoth challenge when he was made the Chairman of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). This gave birth to the Aadhar Card, an Indian biometric ID system that includes the demographic information of billion-plus Indian residents. Over the years, Mr Nilekani has continued to give back to his alma mater to refurbish its infrastructure and establish state-of-the-art hostels on campus.\n\nHis philanthropic endowment ensured the maintenance, upgradation, renovation, and building of additional rooms at Hostel 8, which eventually became a benchmark for all the other hostels on campus.\n\nContinuing his theme of providing a better quality of life to his alma mater’s current students, Mr Nilekani’s generosity led to the setting up Hostels 12, 13, and 14. The three hostels cater to the needs of more than 1000 national and international students with world-class amenities. They include a 24X7 state-of-the-art CCTV facility, gym, a lavish lounge room, separate areas for reading/computer, playing pool, music, and boxing, a common area, laundry facilities, and more. The hostels also have an outdoor volleyball court, a badminton court, and an open playground.\n\nMr Nilekani’s generosity laid the foundation for the Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (SINE), which was set up in 2004 to foster entrepreneurship and nurture tech start-ups. So far, SINE has incubated more than 180 startups and has raised Rs. 4425 Crores.\n\nHis endowment fund to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) has helped and energised its faculty, students, and support staff. The fund allowed the department to buy equipment, meet operational costs, create chair professorships, and help students attend international seminars and symposiums. The Department of CSE at IIT Bombay is among the most prestigious and demanding for students to be admitted. The department attracts top rankers from the JEE to its B.Tech. Programme and applicants with GATE scores greater than 850 to its M. Tech. Programme.\n\nEvery year, the CSE department publishes several research articles in top-tier conferences and journals (as ranked by CORE). The CSE faculty have brought accolades to the Institute by winning many eminent awards such as the Padma Shri, Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar award, Infosys Prize, and many other esteemed fellowships.\n\nAfter his B.Tech. from IIT Bombay, Mr. Girish Gaitonde received his M.S. from Penn State University and his MBA in Finance & Management from the University of Chicago Business School.\n\nHe is the founder of Xoriant Corporation (formerly TekEdge Corporation), a California-based global IT services company with operations in the USA, Europe, and India. He has also participated as a seed investor and board member in more than a dozen technology startups.\n\nMr. Gaitonde holds a joint patent in specialty electronic sensors which are used in the chemical industry. The Silicon Valley chapter of the US Chamber of Commerce awarded him with the Entrepreneur of the Year Award in two different years. He has also been the recipient of several awards honouring him as an outstanding entrepreneur.\n\nIt was important for Mr. Gaitonde to give back to his alma mater which played an integral role in his growth and success as an entrepreneur and he set up the Girish Gaitonde Lecture Hall Complex at IIT Bombay.\n\nThe lecture complex includes a brand-new, 25,000 sq. feet, five-storey building which houses the Electrical Engineering Dept. office, as well as all of the departmental classrooms. Apart from several lecture halls throughout the building, the second floor includes a conference hall while the fourth floor has a learning centre and a library. The top floor includes the Bharti Centre for Communication, the VLSI Lab, and the Embedded Systems Lab. Other labs at the Girish Gaitonde Lecture Hall Complex include the Integrated System Laboratory, the Information Networks Laboratory (Infonet Lab), the Power Systems Laboratory, and the Power Electronics Research Lab.\n\nMs. Rekha Koita is a Co-Founder of the Koita Foundation.\n\nMs. Koita completed her B. Tech. in Metallurgical Engineering from IIT Bombay in 1992 and is the recipient of the Institute Silver Medal. After completing her master’s in Material Science from Carnegie Mellon University, USA, in 1994, Ms. Koita returned to India and worked for Accenture as a management consultant for eight years. She moved on to become a trainer in consulting skills and conducted programmes for various corporates as well as start-ups and NGOs.\n\nMs. Koita is an involved alumnus of IIT Bombay. She was one of the leaders of her batch’s Legacy Project where she implemented a number of different initiatives on campus. Ms. Koita is a member of the Board of the IIT Bombay Research Park, a new initiative to drive collaboration across IIT Bombay and corporate organizations.\n\nFor the past few years, Ms. Koita has transitioned to the social sector. Ms. Koita co-founded the Koita Foundation where she works with NGOs in the areas of education, livelihoods, and health care. She, along with her husband, Mr. Rizwan Koita, most recently established a digital healthcare centre under the aegis of the Koita Foundation at IIT Bombay.\n\nThe Koita Centre for Digital Health (KCDH) at IIT Bombay is the first of its kind in India. KCDH drives academic programmes; research in areas like healthcare data management and analytics, health AI, and more; entrepreneurship, employment, and industry collaborations in Digital Health. KCDH also partners with leading hospital systems, healthcare research, and academic organizations.\n\nKCDH is resolved to address the need for engineering graduates, clinical professionals, and entrepreneurs in Digital Health and create research and employment opportunities in this domain. KCDH will leverage some of the smartest minds from IIT Bombay to handle the country’s unique healthcare problems/disease patterns and healthcare delivery challenges. The Centre envisions creating a cadre of professionals who can apply their technical expertise in areas like AI/ML and resolve real-world problems.\n\nClick here to know more about KCDH…\n\nMr. Rizwan Koita graduated at the top of his B. Tech. class at IIT Bombay in 1992. He, once again, had the highest GPA in his class at MIT where he got his master’s in electrical engineering and computer science in 1995. He worked at McKinsey and Company for a few years before he set up TransWorks, one of the first BPO companies in India. He then established CitiusTech (www.citiustech.com), a healthcare technology company that went on to become one of the fastest-growing healthcare technology companies globally. CitiusTech became India’s 25th Unicorn in 2019 and has revenues of over Rs. 4,000 Crores.\n\nOver the years, Mr. Koita has continued to give back to his alma mater. CitiusTech set up a healthcare innovation fund (HIF) with IIT Bombay’s SINE in 2015. Since then, SINE HIF has invested in multiple healthcare/technology start-ups to date.\n\nHe, along with his wife, Ms. Rekha Koita, has established the Koita Foundation (www.koitafoundation.org), to support philanthropic initiatives in Digital Health and NGO transformation. It has partnered with Tata Memorial Centre and National Cancer Grid to establish the Koita Centre for Digital Oncology (www.kcdo.in). Koita Foundation works closely with the National Health Authority (NHA) and National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) on their Digital Health initiatives.\n\nIn 2021, Koita Foundation helped established the Koita Centre for Digital Health (KCDH) at IIT Bombay – the first of its kind in India. KCDH aims to leverage some of the smartest minds from IIT Bombay to handle the country’s unique healthcare problems/disease patterns and healthcare delivery challenges. KCDH drives academic programmes; research in areas like healthcare data management and analytics, health AI, and more; entrepreneurship, employment, and industry collaborations in Digital Health. KCDH also partnered with leading hospital systems and healthcare research organisations.\n\nClick here to know more about KCDH…\n\nAfter graduating from IIT Bombay in 1998, Mr. Lakhamraju received a fellowship at the University of Berkeley to pursue his master’s and a Ph.D. in computer science.

Dr. Mehta graduated with his B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Bombay in 1971. He then completed his master’s and Ph.D. in Operations Research and Computer Science from Case Western Reserve University. He also holds an Honorary Doctorate in Human Letters from California State University.\n\nDr. Mehta’s career spans 45 years which includes being President, Granite Hill Capital Ventures; Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Providian Financial Corporation; Operating General Partner, West Bridge Capital; President and Chief Operating Officer, Capital Holding Insurance group; and Executive Vice President, Key Corp.\n\nDr. Mehta is also an avid philanthropist. He formed the Shailesh J. Mehta and Kalpa S. Mehta Charitable Foundation which has given millions of dollars in grants to various institutions including his alma mater. While IIT Bombay’s management school was founded in 1995, it was renamed the Shailesh J. Mehta School of Management (SJMSOM) in 2000 in honour of Dr. Mehta and his generosity to the Institute. The school’s vision is to ‘excel in the creation, dissemination, and application of management knowledge.’ And its mission is to ‘nurture intellectual capital by leveraging on research, teaching, consultancy, and collaborations within the IIT Bombay eco-system and beyond.’\n\nSJMSOM has played an instrumental role in transforming technological professionals into the ‘Renaissance business leaders’ of tomorrow. The school draws on the varied intellectual resources at the institute and provides them with an outstanding and innovative program in management education. SJMSOM’s students have gone on to occupy leadership positions in the corporate world, government, and non-profit organisations. Many are respected faculty members at various IIMs, IITs, and other leading business schools, even as others are pursuing their entrepreneurial dreams. SJMSOM’s stellar faculty have won accolades for their teaching, and their research has been published in top-ranked journals and converted into intellectual property rights (IPRs) and books.\n\nIn November 2021, SJMSOM added an Executive Education Complex that is equipped with state-of-the-art infrastructure. These include climate-controlled classrooms, breakout rooms, lounges, a faculty room, a conference room, and multimedia facilities that augment the learning experience of students. This trailblazing complex conducts the joint Executive MBA program offered by SJMSOM, IIT Bombay, and the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nMr. Victor Menezes graduated with honours from IIT Bombay in 1970 and completed his master’s degree in business administration from the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1972. He went on to have a 32-year global career with Citigroup Inc. and retired from the company as its Senior Vice Chairman.\n\nPost his retirement, Mr. Menezes continues to be involved in several organisations including chairing the Advisory Board for Citi India, the Executive Committee of the Eisenhower Fellowships, and the Clearing House Association. He is a senior advisor of New Silk Route, an international private equity firm, and is the Vice Chairman of the Asia Society and Catholic Charities in New York.\n\nEven as Mr. Menezes blazed a trail of success in his professional life, he never forgot the role his alma mater played in this journey. His batch at the Institute was the very first to reside in Hostel 8. He was also one of the Founders and Co-Chair of the IIT Bombay Heritage Foundation (IITBHF) which is amongst the earliest and most successful alumni organizations in India. Paying it forward to his alma mater was paramount to Mr. Menezes and his philanthropic donation resulted in the setting up of a state-of-the-art convention centre at the Institute.\n\n“I received a priceless education from IIT Bombay, and this is a small way to say thank you,” said Mr. Menezes. “I hope the centre will help support the exchange of ideas at IIT Bombay.”\n\nThe Victor Menezes Convention Centre (VMCC) was inaugurated by former union minister for Human Resources and Development, Mr. Kapil Sibal, on January 8, 2011.\n\nVMCC houses 6 lecture halls with a 150-seat capacity each and 10 lecture halls with a 75-seat capacity each. These are used to host conferences, seminars, training sessions, workshops, and academic activities every year. The Centre also includes a VIP lounge, a cafeteria with a pantry, a conference hall to host business conventions, and a well-equipped auditorium with the latest technical installations with a capacity to accommodate up to 390 visitors.\n\nSeveral prestigious events have been held at VMCC since it was set up at IIT Bombay. These include INDICON 2013, Design Degree Show 2015, Humanising Work & Environment 2015, SOULS 2016, 24th ICCE 2016, Next Generation Aerospace Skills 2016, and more. VMCC has gone a long way towards boosting IIT Bombay’s profile globally, increased R&D initiatives, enhanced collaboration with the industry, and has aided in IIT Bombay’s journey toward becoming a global leader in science and technology.\n\nMr. Rekhi worked in emerging areas of technology before he founded Excelan in 1982, a network technology company that introduced many pioneering products to the industry. Excelan went public in 1987 and merged with Novell in 1989. He is the co-founder of TiE (The Indus Entrepreneurs), a global networking platform for Indian entrepreneurs. As president of TiE, Mr. Rekhi advises and promotes young entrepreneurs and, under his leadership, TiE has spread to many cities in the USA.\n\nMr. Rekhi has often acknowledged the role that IIT Bombay played in his successful career. He was a trailblazer when it came to paying it forward to his alma mater. He recollects when he returned to Mumbai in 1993 (his first visit back home after he graduated from IIT Bombay in 1967) and decided to make a quick trip to his beloved IITB Powai campus. But what he saw shocked him. His memory of a brand-new campus from when he was a student now consisted of hostel buildings that were falling apart and had not been painted in close to two decades.\n\nA year later he met with Prof. Sukhatme, then Director of IITB, and learned that the Institute did not have the budget to cater to ‘incidental expenses’ like the refurbishment of campus infrastructure. Mr. Rekhi immediately offered to fund the renovation and sent a cheque for $50,000 to his alma mater. He learned to his surprise that there was no legal precedent for Government Institutes like IIT Bombay to accept private donations. “It got the wheels turning in Delhi and took literally an act of parliament to enable. It was three years before the check was finally cashed.”\n\nMr. Rekhi continued to give back to his alma mater and set up the Kanwal Rekhi School of Information Technology (KRESIT) at IIT Bombay. In 2006, KRESIT merged with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the Institute. Circa 2022, the Department of CSE at IIT Bombay is one of the prestigious and toughest programmes to get into. It attracts top rankers from the JEE to its B.Tech. programme and applicants with GATE scores greater than 850 to its M. Tech. programme.\n\nMr. Rekhi believes firmly that the fortunes of the IITs should be connected to the fortunes of its alumni. To that end, he continues to be a very involved alumnus and an active participant/advisor to IIT Bombay Heritage Fund.\n\nAfter graduating from IIT Bombay in 1983, Dr. Shukla got his MS in Electrical Engineering from Virginia Tech and a Ph.D. from North Carolina State University. Dr. Shukla’s career ranges from research and academia to technology development, corporate leadership, and entrepreneurship. He co-founded kPoint Technologies which offers a SaaS video engagement platform for businesses, while GS Lab, also co-founded by him, offers software product engineering services. Over the years Dr. Shukla has served as a faculty member in the Department of Computer Engineering at the Naval Postgraduate School, California, and as Director and Chief Operating Officer at Persistent Systems.\n\nGiving back to his alma mater is key to Dr. Shukla.\n\nHe is a Distinguished Service Awardee of IIT Bombay and has served as a Chairman of the IITB Alumni Association. He has also organized lectures by technocrats, entrepreneurs, and other luminaries for IITB alumni in Pune.\n\nAfter recently completing his corporate career, Dr. Shukla’s focus shifted to digital trust technology. To that end, his generous philanthropic donation was instrumental in the setting up of the IIT Bombay Trust Lab. Dr. Shukla also participates actively as an investor and advisor to organizations working to improve affordable private schools and government-run schools.\n\nIIT Bombay has always led from the front when it comes to developing solutions for nationally critical issues, especially within science and technology. The setting up of the Trust Lab embodies IIT Bombay’s commitment to fulfilling that role in the area of digital trust and hopes that it will substantially impact the digital trust ecosystem in our country.\n\nIIT Bombay’s Trust Lab will develop state-of-the-art theory and practice in digital trust in academia, industry, and government. It will develop processes for seamlessly translating science to technology, encourage synergies between various pockets of excellence already present in the country through TrustNet, set up and promote resources for digital enterprises, and much more.\n\nSpeaking about the importance of establishing the Trust Lab at his alma mater, Dr. Shukla said, “India is leading the world in going digital at the population scale. As we do that, Digital Security becomes as critical as food, energy, and border security. The IITB Trust Lab is all about building a strong foundation for Digital Security and, more broadly, Digital Trust.”\n\nClick here to know more about IITB Trust Lab…"
