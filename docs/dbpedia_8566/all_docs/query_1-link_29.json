        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nIndian Legal Systems refers to the system of law operative in India. In the ancient days, there was a distinct tradition of law, which had a historically independent school of legal theory and practice. Law as a matter of religious prescriptions and philosophical discourse has an illustrious history in India.[1] The Arthashastra dating from 400 BC and the Manusmriti from 100 AD were influential treatises in India, texts that were considered authoritative legal guidance.[2] Manu's central philosophy was tolerance and pluralism and was cited across Southeast Asia.[2] During the Islamic rule, Sharia law came to India, but that was applicable mainly to the Muslim population. When India became part of the British Empire, there was a break in the tradition, and Hindu and Islamic laws were supplanted by the common law. As a result, the present judicial system of the country derives largely from the British system and has little correlation to the institutions of the pre-British era.[2] Much of the contemporary Indian Laws are largely based on English Common Law, a system of law based on recorded judicial precedents and shows substantial European and American influence and many of the legislations introduced by the British are still operative. Therefore, the roots of most of the legislations in respect of persons with mental disorders (PMI) can be traced to the British periods.\n\nThere is a dynamic relationship between the concept of mental illness, the treatment of the mentally ill and the law.[3] As Rappeport has noted, for the psychiatrists the court is “another house … with its different motives, goals and rules of conduct.”[4] While the psychiatrist is concerned primarily with the diagnosis of mental disorders and the welfare of the patient, the court is often mainly concerned with determination of competency, dangerousness, diminished responsibility and/or the welfare of society.[5] Therefore, in India also, most of the earlier legislations in respect of PMI were concerned with these aspects. However, legislations drafted after eighties tend to give some stress on the rights of PMI also.\n\nPersons with disability (equal opportunities, protection of rights, full participation) Act, 1995 (PDA-95)\n\nPDA-95 was enacted in 1995 to remove discriminations in the sharing of developmental benefits vis-à-vis non-disabled persons and to prevent abuse and exploitations of persons with disability (PWD). It provided for barrier-free environment and spelled out responsibilities for the government to plan strategies for comprehensive development programmes, to special provision for integration of PWD into the social mainstream. Under PDA-95, mental retardation and mental illness are categorized as conditions of disabilities. Thus, the PMI are entitled to benefits available to PWD as provided under the Act. There is a provision of 3% reservation in government jobs, but it is not available to the PMI. This Act is also currently under revision in light of the UNCRPD-2006.\n\nNational trust Act-1999\n\nThis Act was enacted in the year 1999 for the welfare of persons with autism, cerebral palsy, mental retardation and multiple disabilities to enable and empower them to live as independently and as close to the community to which they belong and to facilitate the realization of equal opportunities and protection of rights. The Act provides for many welfare measures. This Act is also under revision to make it UNCRPD-2006 compliant and make it more comprehensive. Management of properties of PMI is supposed to be covered under the amended Act.\n\nIndian contract laws\n\nAccording to Indian Contract Act, 1872, any person of sound mind can make a contract. Section 12 of the Act stipulates that a person is said to be of sound mind for the purpose of making a contract, if, at the time when he makes it, he is capable of understanding it and of forming a rational judgment as to its effect upon his interest. A person, who is usually of unsound mind, but occasionally of sound mind, may make a contract when he is of sound mind. A person, who is usually of sound mind, but occasionally of unsound mind, may not make a contract when he is of unsound mind. It means a PMI who is currently free of the psychotic symptoms can make a contract, whereas a person who is currently intoxicated or delirious cannot make a contract."
