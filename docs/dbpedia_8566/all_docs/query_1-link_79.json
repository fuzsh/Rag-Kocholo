She made The Salman Khan shy and excited by dancing and talkin'to him..they was definitely something in her that attracted her and everyone ..\n\nShe was what was needed in the Biggboss house and they got it ..he wanted to know her there was something in her that was pulling him to know her. He had never been so desperate or curious for anyone ..he would ask her questions and try to analyse her ans she would happily answer.\n\nShe did face a lot of hate and it might be both of their mistakes but she was guilty and that's all that matters. He just couldn't stop from knowing ans liking her ..she was so innocent but smart ..she was not worried about her game but after staying with her all that mattered for her was him.\n\nShe would take it in the other way of I love you ..she so wanted to say gande wala love in the bathroom but she was afraid of rejection ..she didn't care about the world all that mattered was Siddharth. She couldn't help but fall in love with him at the end of the season ..she wanted him and it was high time she couldn't just deny it ..she wanted to tell him when she watched the Memories on the last day which had made her confident ti tell him but her one foolish decision of signing a show spoilt everything ..\n\nHe was in love with her but was avoiding it ..he wasn't scared of commitment but something else ..she was 13 years younger than him which didn't bother both of them but it was important ane favourite topic for the society ..he didn't want to take a decision on the show ..he wanted his maaa blessings ..\n\nAfter months of denial and hurt and happy moments finally they agreed to love eachother..\n\nHere they are standing in front of Each other smiling looking in eachother happy eyes with varmalas in their hands ..they both looked just beautiful ..the beautiful lehenga Shenaaz wore was to die for .. Siddharth couldn't believe his eyes when he saw her coming with her brothers and smiling and gleamed eyes ..\n\nThey have come a really really long way .. finally they would be eachother ..she found him so handsome ..he looked like her one.\n\nShe was always confused with her feelings but at the end Siddharth was all that mattered to her.\n\nTheir families were glad and overhelmed by this moment finally their children and lovelies were getting combined togather in a beautiful knot..\n\nShe moved forward to put the garland and he rose up actually was carried up by his cousin and friends and in no time shehnaaz was up too ..no way our sherni would be left behind. They all laughed when she threw tg garland and it reached perfectly in his neck and he reverted then ..\n\nAll clapped happily and took some pictures ..all the ladies and gentlemen were very happy with this ..they had their loved ones around and it all mattered ..\n\n‚Ä†**********************‚Ä†\n\nThey were seated next to Each other and we're fulfilling all the rituals and everyone clicking pictures and adoring the couple..\n\nThey stood up and finally it was time for the most important segment ..shehnaaz was almost going to cry but she was sparing it for later ..and Siddharth was glad ..he was enjoying it very well..\n\nSantosh sukh and Parminder Gill came forward to do the kanyadaan ..they had tears in their eyes .. finally their daughter whom they respected utterly was stepping into a new step.
