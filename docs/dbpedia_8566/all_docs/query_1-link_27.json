        "text": "The date was November 11, 2001; location, Shivli, Kanpur. Rajnath Singh, now Union Defence Minister, was then chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. A 28-year-old Vikas Dubey, along with seven of his henchmen, all armed with rifles, country-made pistols and iron rods, allegedly accosted Santosh Shukla, a minister in Singh’s cabinet, in broad daylight. After a brief argument, the men attacked Shukla with iron rods. A terrified Shukla ran for his life and to a nearby Shivli police station. Dubey reportedly chased him all the way inside the police station, shot him dead in the presence of 25 policemen and walked away without any resistance. A year later, he surrendered only to be released on bail. During the trial, every witness, including the policemen, turned hostile and Dubey was acquitted by the court.\n\nNearly two decades later, Dubey, now 47, has once again earned national notoriety. On the night of July 2, he and his associates killed eight police personnel and grievously injured six who had reportedly located his hideout in Bikru, a village in Chaubepur in Kanpur Dehat district, and gone to arrest him. The incident, however, is not just another case of a criminal getting the better of the police. It exposes how gangsters are born and nurtured by a system made rotten by political patronage, corrupt law enforcers, land-grabbing mafia and slow judicial processes. A land-grabber and political power-broker, Dubey enjoyed the patronage of politicians across party lines in his three-decade-long criminal history.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThat Dubey had a finger in every pie was evident from a letter written by circle officer Devendra Mishra, one of the eight police personnel killed in the ambush, to the then Kanpur Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Anant Deo Tiwari. The letter, sent on March 14, pointed out how Dubey roamed free despite “more than 150 criminal cases pending against him in Kanpur and neighbouring districts”. The letter also included a detailed account of an alleged nexus between Dubey and Vinay Tiwari, station house officer (SHO) of Chaubepur Police. Yet, no action was taken on the letter.\n\nFOLLOW VIKAS DUBEY ENCOUNTER LIVE UPDATES HERE\n\nFollowing the incident on July 2, the police nabbed one of Dubey’s associates who claimed that not only had Vinay Tiwari tipped off the gangster but also ensured a complete blackout in the village. Local electricity officials said that they had arranged a “shut-down” following a phone call from the police station. Vinay Tiwari and another colleague from his police station were arrested on July 8. Anant Deo Tiwari, who had been promoted as DIG of Special Task Force (STF), has been shunted out of the STF and appointed as DIG, Pradeshik Armed Constabulary (PAC) of Moradabad. Nearly four months after Mishra’s letter, an IG rank officer has finally been asked to inquire into his allegations. On the morning of July 9, Dubey was arrested by the Madhya Pradesh police from Ujjain’s Mahakal Temple. There is, however, no clarity on whether he was arrested or if he surrendered.\n\nA long history of crime\n\nIn 1990, a young Dubey, hailing from the rural Kanpur area of Chaubepur, was detained by police for allegedly beating up some men from another caste for insulting his father. Sensing the potential in this aggressive young man, local politicians intervened and got Dubey released, without even a case registered. Two years later, accused of murder, he was arrested again by the local police but was soon released on bail. This sequence of events would be repeated again and again over the years. Dubey continued to wade through legal tangles with the help of political connections, money and muscle. In an undated video, widely circulated on social media recently, Dubey claimed that former Uttar Pradesh Assembly Speaker Hari Krishna Srivastava was his political guru. Srivastava was Speaker in 1990-91 during the Mulayam Singh Yadav government. Incidentally, Shukla, murdered by Dubey in a police station, was Srivastava’s political rival.\n\nAs his clout increased, Dubey, a Brahmin by birth, built a dedicated army of henchmen and emerged as “role model” for many in his caste. For the rest of the world, he remains a dreaded criminal, but in his village he is seen as a Dabang neta (daredevil leader) who stands by the marginalised and those in need of help. Some refer to him as Panditji. Even after the July 2 ambush, he is being touted as a hero on social media. There is a Facebook page dedicated to Dubey which describes him as a “Brahmin Shiromani” (Brahmin supreme).\n\nIn fact, Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring Bihar have seen a long tradition of “rationalising” criminal activities based on caste support since Shri Prakash Shukla emerged as a dreaded gangster in the 1980s. Since then, several people with criminal records—often known as bahubalis—have dabbled in electoral politics themselves or lent support to politicians or political parties. Several, like Mukhtar Ansari, Raghuraj Pratap Singh aka Raja Bhaiya, Amanmani Tripathi, Ateek Ahmed and Harishankar Tiwari, who became successful in politics often evoked extreme loyalty from supporters despite their regular tussle with the law.\n\nHaving exploited the caste dynamics, Dubey became a mercenary, shifting political loyalties for a price. He controlled over two dozen Brahmin-dominated villages in the Chaubepur area and reportedly could swing nearly one lakh votes, enough to determine victory or defeat, for or against a political leader. Politicians approached him not only for help in securing votes but for facilitating land and business deals, which, according to many officials, became his lifeline, protecting him from the clutches of laws. “He continued to grab land from helpless, hapless owners in the rapidly urbanising Chaubeypur area. Political patronage gave him the cover he needed from any conscientious police officer,” wrote former DGP of Uttar Pradesh Javeed Ahmad in a column.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe July 2 ambush was also the consequence of a land dispute between Dubey and his brother-in-law Rahul Tiwari, a resident of Mohini Nivada village. Mishra and the police team had gone to arrest Dubey following an FIR registered by Rahul Tiwari, who had alleged that he had been threatened by Dubey over two acres of panchayat land. Tiwari had initially approached Chaubepur SHO Vinay Tiwari to lodge a case, but was refused.\n\nSeveral other police officers claim, off the record, that it was, in fact, the land-grabbing prowess that made Dubey a prized possession for politician. “The modus operandi is simple,” explains an IPS officer from Uttar Pradesh, who wished to not be named. “First a ruffian like Dubey would forcibly occupy a piece of land to create a legal dispute. As the legal process would take years to resolve, the helpless owner of the land would agree for a settlement and sell the plot to the illegal occupant at a throw-away price. While police-politician nexus helps such goons, the most urgent requirement is fast-tracking judicial resolution which can make a key difference.”\n\nadvertisement\n\nHow to walk away with bail\n\nTime and again, Dubey has successfully exploited the judicial process to his advantage. Till now, he has been convicted only in one murder case—in 2000, he gunned down Sidheshwar Pandey, the principal of the Tara Chand Inter College in Shivli town, over a land dispute—but the conviction order was stayed by the Allahabad High Court and he was released on bail. “Curiously, a man with a criminal history of over 60 cases, including multiple cases of murder, and under the Gangster Act was found fit to be given bail soon after,” wrote Ahmad.\n\nOn June 25, 2006, Dubey was arrested from SBD District Hospital in Saharanpur by Janakpuri Police Station. There were 50 cases against him by then. The police reported that five kilogram of “doda post”, a drug made of poppy husk, was found on him. However, on ground of his medical condition—he had suffered spinal injuries after he met with an accident four months before his arrest—was released on bail.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn March 2017, the BJP came to power in Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath became the chief minister and soon declared a stern policy of zero tolerance towards organised crime and the mafia. The same year, the Uttar Pradesh special task force (STF) arrested Dubey under Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act from his house in Indralok Colony in Krishnanagar. He spent 18 months in jail before getting bail in 2019. In 2018, while in jail, Dubey’s cousin Anurag was murdered. In her complaint, Anurag’s wife claimed that Dubey was behind the murder.\n\nIn another undated video that surfaced recently, Dubey claimed that two BJP MLAs—Abhijeet Sanga and Bhagwati Sagar—helped him get bail in the 2017 case. Both leaders have vehemently refuted this claim. In 2019, the Uttar Pradesh government filed a charge-sheet—in the case of the 2017 arrest by the STF—but Dubey challenged it in the High Court and secured an order of no coercive action against him.\n\nHowever, in that Dubey managed to repeatedly walk free, the police cannot just pass the buck to the judiciary. For instance, on July 5, 2018, a special judge (Gangster Act) of Kanpur on July 5, 2018, denied Dubey bail in a case. The police played a huge part in aiding Dubey. While some, like Vinay Tiwari, allegedly acted as moles, the police department failed to consistently pursue the dreaded gangster. For instance, following Dubey’s acquittal by trial court in 2006 in the 2001 case of Shukla’s murder, the Uttar Pradesh police did not appeal against the decision in higher courts. That’s a domain where political will can make a significant difference. The Yogi Adityanath government has hardened its stance against crime and criminals, but the murder of eight policemen by Dubey proves loopholes in the system still exist."
