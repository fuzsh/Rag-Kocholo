        "text": "In this paper, I discuss issues revolving around history, historiography, alterity, difference and otherness concealed in the doubled Indian/South Asian label used to describe Indian/South Asian dance genres in the UK. The paper traces the historical genealogy of the South Asian label to US, Indian and British contexts and describes how the South Asian enunciation fed into Indian nation-state historiography and politics in the 1950s. I conclude by describing how Akademi: South Asian Dance, a leading London based arts organisation, explored the ambivalence in the doubled Indian/South Asian label by renaming itself in 1997, and forging new local/global networks of communication and artistic exchange between Indian and British based dancers and choreographers at the turn of the twenty-first century.\n\nLanguage is an inherent part of an individual’s identity. Any attempt to subjugate that identity is vehemently resisted by the people. In India, Hindi is not only seen as a language per se but also linked with North Indian Hindus. In the past, the introduction and imposition of Hindi in non-Hindi-speaking states, mainly Tamil Nadu, had faced strong opposition. Since the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by the Hindu Nationalist Party—Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP)—elected to power in May 2014, the union government has taken measures to what it calls promoting the use of the Hindi language in India. These measures have been strongly resisted in the non-Hindi-speaking states of the country. This article looks at the debates between Hindi and non-Hindi speakers since the years of the anti-colonial movement in India. It examines the character of the movement to promote Hindi and the resistance against the Hindi movements in India. This article also discusses the demands for language-based states in India. In this paper, the author argues that in the non-Hindi-speaking states, Hindi is mainly looked at as a means to subsume and suppress the native’s identity. To protect their linguistic identity, which is inextricably intertwined with other identities, people in non-Hindi-speaking areas have protested in past and also resist such attempts in present.\n\nDr B. R. Ambedkar, one of the makers of the Indian Constitution, is known best as the emancipator of the untouchables. Ambedkar’s effort to make India as a nation through ‘breaking the internal differences’ is much debated and not widely recognized as he has still been confined only to his identity as a ‘liberating leader of the Dalits’. Ambedkar’s ideas—caste annihilation, securing rights to the depressed class, representation of the oppressed in political affairs, egalitarian economic arrangement, women’s rights and thoughts on democracy—all have the potential to be linked with his ideas of a nation, which is inclusive in nature.\n\nImage captioning is the process of generating a textual description of an image that aims to describe the salient parts of the given image. It is an important problem, as it involves computer vision and natural language processing, where computer vision is used for understanding images, and natural language processing is used for language modeling. A lot of works have been done for image captioning for the English language. In this article, we have developed a model for image captioning in the Hindi language. Hindi is the official language of India, and it is the fourth most spoken language in the world, spoken in India and South Asia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to generate image captions in the Hindi language. A dataset is manually created by translating well known MSCOCO dataset from English to Hindi. Finally, different types of attention-based architectures are developed for image captioning in the Hindi language. These attention mechanisms are new for the Hindi language, as those have never been used for the Hindi language. The obtained results of the proposed model are compared with several baselines in terms of BLEU scores, and the results show that our model performs better than others. Manual evaluation of the obtained captions in terms of adequacy and fluency also reveals the effectiveness of our proposed approach.
