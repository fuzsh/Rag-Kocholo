With Santosh Shukla's evicition from the Bigg Boss house, he's one happy man. But his only regret during his stay in the house has been fellow contestant Aashka Goradia.

Santosh Shukla made his wild card entry on the show and went straight to the Padosi/mud house. His friendship with Aashka soon developed into feelings of love. "People say i fall in love very easily. Although i'm a Shiv bhakt, i'm like kanhaiya from inside. I was very attracted to Aashka when I first met her. But one day when i saw her reading the namaz, i just fell head over heels in love with her. She made the whole atmosphere so pure and pious".

But Santosh's dream did not last very long. "I was shocked by the saudden change in Aashka's behaviour. She was not the same person I encountered in the mud house. She deceived me and played games. She always reciprocated so i though things were going good between us. She warned me to stay away from people like Urvashi and Rajev. But once we entered the modern house, she was friendly to both. She has changed over night! Thank god for Nirahua who warned me against her. He told me to keep my eyes open and i also ahd a chance to hear what all Aashka spoke abut me in front of the cameras" says Santosh angrily.

But in his own words, he's an optimist. Adds Santosh, "I loved Aashka with a pure heart but she back bited and i was told that she os not the right girl for me. Then i befriended Karishma. She's so sweet and non controversial. She's not interested in gossip or house piltics. That girl would make me tea five times a day! I finally began to develop strong feelings for ehr and i eventually proposed. She was very touched and told me that this was not the right place to do so. Hopefully once she's out, things may work out and i may marry ehr. I've told ehr i will do anything for her".

For now, Santosh Shukla is happy to be back home and spend time with his family.
