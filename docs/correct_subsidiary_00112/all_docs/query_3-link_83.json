More specifically, the present invention relates to coordination of data privileges while simultaneously preserving data privacy and allowing useful facilitation of privacy sensitive data features.\n\nHealth transaction data sources healthcare claims data, transaction data and medical data is being created, stored and communicated by various healthcare organizations. Healthcare providers frequently initiate large amounts of data as they diagnose, perform various clinical tests, perform medical procedures, and prescribe treatment. Elements of the clinical information also exist with the laboratories, pharmacies, HMOs and other healthcare payers, as well as a range of other service organizations such as clearinghouses and PBMs. Health transaction data is protected by privacy standards such as the HIPAA in the USA. In many different areas of the healthcare system data is being used for both internal applications within the organization that generated the data or for external applications, by properly de- identifying transaction data from patient identifiers.\n\nconstant one-way hash to link or match records for the same person or entity may have substantial drawbacks in terms of risk of downstream re- identification (e.g. access to the one-way hash and a set of personal information may allow generation of an individual's encrypted identifier and therefore re- identification) as well as significantly reduced matching and/or linking capability.\n\nDTC Direct -to-consumer, DTC as a trendâ Specifically the pharmaceutical industry (and sometimes the medical device manufacturers), communicate directly with consumers to drive awareness to various medical conditions and to specific products.\n\nDirect-to -Consumer marketing has grown significantly since the FDA has relaxed its regulation on such activities in 1997.\n\nDTC initiatives range from advertising initiatives to initiatives that are very well targeted through a one-to-one dialog. Some initiatives are specifically aimed at users of a particular medication to encourage them to use the product correctly, or as prescribed, and for chronic conditions, encourage users to use the medication for a long period of time (persistency).\n\nDTC promotional activities are examples of Health Programs as defined herein.\n\nHealth programs Nature of health programs and data collected; type of intervention and possible combinationsâ There are many different types of health programs and likewise different entities who may be interested in sponsoring and delivering these programs. Goals can vary based on sponsors (government, HMOs, employers, pharmaceutical companies, etc.). Health programs can have the goals of raising product awareness, acquiring new customers, encouraging patient compliance with medication regimen, expanding the overall diagnosed market, improve healthcare outcomes, improve quality of life, reduce overall cost to the healthcare system, etc. Other non- pharmaceutical manufacturer sponsored health programs may include public health efforts or disease/care management as well as other health promotion programs promoted by healthcare associations, payers and others.\n\nData Source Entity organizations that generate, capture or store (for exampleâ in the health care industry) medical and claims data that includes identifiable personal health information. That includes physician office, hospitals, labs and other healthcare providers; pharmacies; and HMOs, MCOs, self-insured employers, insurance companies, PBMs and other such entities. It also includes claims clearinghouses and any other \"Covered Entities\" as defined under HIPAA.\n\nthe source- entity also includes other entities operating as a vendor for the source-entity under a privacy agreement (such as HIPAA Business Associate Agreement).\n\nnon-health care data source entities such as credit card companies, credit bureaus, insurance companies, banks, the census bureau, social service agencies, law enforcement agencies, and the likes, all of which share common functionality as collectors and maintainers of myriads of data including therein personal identifiable data.\n\nData Consumer Entity organizations that would like to get analytics services to answer marketing, operational, quality, (for example) health outcome or other business related question regarding a specific (for example) health program, initiative, a subset or all of the marketplace, etc.\n\nData Consumer Entities are interested in strategic and tactical analyses to help them optimize their resource investment to achieve their objectives. Examples can be the government, researchers, product and service (for example) healthcare companies, etc. Specifically in healthcare, detailed population information can have a remarkable role in the identification of public health trends, retrospective health outcomes, clinical research and development, medical errors and other valuable healthcare applications.\n\nData Originator Entity organizations that generate, capture or store personal identifiable data (\"originating information\"), from which can be generated a list of instances that satisfy a condition or conditions in a query. The query is related, of course, to the question that the Data Consumer Entity wants answered.\n\nData Originator Entities can include health care organizations like physician offices, hospitals, labs and other healthcare providers, pharmacies, HMOs, MCOs, self- insured employers, insurance companies, PBMs, claims clearinghouses, and other such entities.\n\nData Originator Entities can also include other entities operating as a vendor for the Data Source Entity under a privacy agreement.\n\nData Originator Entities such as credit card companies, credit bureaus, MSOs, cable TV companies, insurance companies, banks, the census bureau, social service agencies, law enforcement agencies, and the like, all of which share common functionality as collectors and maintainers of data including therein personal identifiable data.\n\nthe Data Originator Entity can be the same as the Data Consumer Entity (i.e., where the Data Consumer Entity has access to suitable originating information), or the two entities can be different (i.e., where the Data Consumer Entity does not have access to suitable originating information).\n\nNon-health care Data Originator Entity is a cable TV company with detailed records of household cable-box channel settings, household billing information and advertising schedules.\n\nthe cable company information reveals what TV show or other entertainment content a particular household was watching at a particular time, and through this information it can be deduced which advertisements that particular household was exposed to.\n\nSuch originating information is suitable for handling queries such as, but not limited to, \"all households who had the opportunity to see commercial advertising X between date A and date B\".\n\nthe objective of such a query is to link advertisement exposure to transactional purchasing information, in order to answer the question of a Data Consumer Entity (which might be a health care company, a consumer products company, etc.), concerning how many households that saw a particular advertisement subsequently purchased the advertised product or service.\n\nCrossix an expression that includes the instant protocol according to any of its embodimentsâ and derivative uses thereof (see FIGS. 4 & 5 for preferred embodiment details)\n\nHealth Program a program (used as specific example for the preferred embodiment of the instant invention) that affects a subset of the overall potential population. Typically patients, consumers or healthcare professionals will opt-in to participate in such a program and if the organization sponsoring it is not covered by HIPAA, the sponsoring organization will adhere to its published privacy policy. Typically Health Programs capture personal identifying information. Health Programs may include for example compliance programs or may include a broadcast advertising component (such as TV commercials) encouraging consumers to call a toll-free number or go to a web-site for further information. Frequently, at the call center or web-site, some consumer information is captured.\n\nTV commercials such as TV commercials\n\nTypical Identifiable Data Captured in a Health Program Some combination of the following fields or similar to those: First Name; Last Name; Date of birth Or Year of birth; Zip Code; Full Address; Phone Number(s); Fax Number(s); E-Mail; Prescribing Doctor Name, Address or Other Identifiers; Medical Condition or Drug Prescribed; Gender; Social Security.\n\nVariability of data discussion personal data frequently changes. (See discussion on this in U.S. Pat. No. 6,397,224 and \"Math, Myth & Magic of Name Search & Matching\" by SearchSoftwareAmerica)\n\na subset of this data jointly can serve as an identifier with high probability of uniqueness. For example, Date of birth and phone number could serve jointly as unique identifiers.\n\nData Source Entity information structure (of typical health care related identifiers) may include all or some of the above plus a unique member ID. (Note: See U.S. Pat. No. 5,544,044; U.S. Pat. No. 5,835,897 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,370,511 for detailed description of healthcare data structure.)\n\nPreferred embodiments of the instant invention allow analysis of \"source-entity\" raw data at is original, most detailed form (high resolution data) including full access to all of the privacy sensitive data currently at its disposal while simultaneously maintaining existing privacy restrictions to the aggregator processor.\n\nhigh-resolution analysis may be performed at multiple different \"source- entities\" each of which preserves its privacy restrictions, yet under certain conditions the data can be aggregated by the aggregator processor to provide a more comprehensive analysis.\n\nsource- entities each of which preserves its privacy restrictions, yet under certain conditions the data can be aggregated by the aggregator processor to provide a more comprehensive analysis.\n\na number of different embodiments are described below, most of which involve the aggregator processor having access to the information at the data consumer entity or entities.\n\nthe aggregator processor does not have full access to the information at either the data consumer entity/entities or the data source entity/entities - because the information at both the data consumer entity/entities (and/or the data originator entity/entities) and the data source entity/entities are privacy-sensitive and may not be shared with the aggregator processor. Yet, in this latter embodiment the aggregator processor does have access to the matched and de- identified results of the query, so that the aggregator processor can analyze those results and deliver the final analysis result to the data consumer entity/entities.\n\nThis latter embodiment which can be thought of as a \"double-blinded\" embodiment because the aggregator processor is blind to both the privacy- sensitive information at the data consumer entity/entities (and/or the data originator entity/entities) and the privacy-sensitive information at the data source entity/entities, has advantages in situations where the information at the data consumer entity/entities (and/or the data originator entity/entities) is sensitive, and not even the aggregator should have exposure to it.\n\nPreferred embodiments of the instant invention allow exploitation of an order of magnitude more value potential from the data currently resident at the \"source-entityâ processors while only adding nominal expenses at the \"aggregatorâ processor. Furthermore, expenses at the \"aggregatorâ processor are essential to define and provide new avenues of access to the ensemble of privacy sensitive data located at the \"source-entityâ processors.\n\nPreferred embodiments of the instant invention essentially are composed of software packages that each respectively sit in different data processing machines where they interact with database packages on that respective machine or a machine connected to it via a network.\n\nthe software packages are interconnected with each other using standard data-communications facilities (e.g. Internet, VPN, etc.). Accordingly, from a technical perspective, embodiments of the instant invention are convolutions of quasi- familiar software modulesâ allowing implementation to be straightforward in today's data complexity environment.\n\nthe aforesaid longstanding needs are significantly addressed by embodiments of the present invention, which specifically relates to The Privacy Preserving Data-Mining Protocol.\n\nthe instant protocol is especially useful in society-computer interactions wherein there exist actual needs or economic benefits from allowing higher resolution query and manipulation of privacy sensitive data while simultaneously not allowing individual privacy to be breached.\n\nEmbodiments of the instant invention relate to a Privacy Preserving Data-Mining Protocol, (see FIG. 3) operating between a secure \"aggregatorâ data processor 300 and at least one secure âsource-entityâ data processors 350, wherein the \"aggregatorâ and the âsource- entityâ processors are interconnected via an electronic data- communications topology 399, and the protocol includes the steps of:\n\nFIGS. 4, 4A (a conceptually more detailed version of FIG. 4), and 5 let's examine each of the sub-steps and explain what it accomplishes and how collectively it results in accomplishing an improvement over the aforesaid long felt need.\n\nEmbodiments of the Privacy Preserving Data-Mining Protocol are operating between a secure \"aggregatorâ data processorâwhich is a central data processing machineâ and at least one secure \"source-entityâ data processorsâ which are other data processing machines that respectively include records having privacy identified data such as name, identity number, or the likes.\n\na secure \"aggregatorâ data processor which is a central data processing machine\n\nsecure âsource-entityâ data processors which are other data processing machines that respectively include records having privacy identified data such as name, identity number, or the likes.\n\nthe \"aggregatorâ and the âsource-entityâ processors are interconnected via an electronic data-communications topologyâsuch as the Internet, or a virtual private circuit or the likes; all of which eliminates any need for the processors to be collectively centralized. Rather, the processors may remain distributed, as is the case in today's world.\n\nan electronic data-communications topology such as the Internet, or a virtual private circuit or the likes; all of which eliminates any need for the processors to be collectively centralized. Rather, the processors may remain distributed, as is the case in today's world.\n\nthe protocol operates using data-communications facilities to interconnect a central aggregator processor with at least one source-entity processors.\n\nthe source entity processors each have respective privacy sensitive data content along with other data content aspects.\n\nthe parameters of the list may include identity disclosing specificsâ which probably do not pass ordinary criteria of even nominal privacy thresholds, and/or broader variablesâ which probably do pass ordinary criteria of normal, rigid, or strict privacy thresholds.\n\nidentity-disclosing specifics may be such things as name, personal identity number or simple data combinations that would allow breach of privacy if applies to disclose identity. What is important in the further application of the instant method is that these identity-disclosing specifics are part of a large enough list in the processing of a query so that the query result will present sufficient statistical distribution to protect the \"reverse engineering\" of the result back to any individual in the initial query list. For example, the instant method can ask about the status of Tom, Dick, Harry, and a further collection of individualsâ and obtain results from that queryâ so long as the statistical character of those results will not allow correlation of a result specific back to an individual.\n\ntransmitting the parameter list may include transmitting a sufficiently large list of identity disclosing specifics.\n\nthe aggregator may accept a query that includes lots of identity specifics (e.g. a list of names or a combination of a few fields that together can allow identification)âthe type of query that one does not expect to be answerable in any privacy preserving fashion.\n\nThis sub-step essentially converts a model base postulate about the data (that relationships that the user wonders) into a formal language query phrases according to shared variable definitions mutually accepted by the aggregator and the source-entities.\n\nthe parameter list would include a definition of the population to be analyzed such as by geography, age or other attributes.\n\nOne of the most novel features of the instant protocol is that the parameter list may even include specific individuals by name or ID or the likes.\n\nthe sub-step of \"(A-ii) via the topologyâ transmitting the parameter list to each of the \"source-entityâ processorsâ sends the formalized queryâ in whatever format is mutual agreed to by the aggregator with each respective source-entity. It may occur that the aggregator phrases the formal query differently to some source-entities than to other source-entitiesâ and this is probably the most pragmatic embodiment.\n\nSometime thereafter is the sub-step of \"(A-iii) via the topologyâ receiving a respective file from each of the \"source-entityâ processorsâ whereby the aggregator receives some answer (or a null answer) from each source-entity; however (as we will understand from the source-entity side of the instant protocol) while the question included parameters which request that the source-entity correlate data according to privacy sensitive data aspects, the answer is condensed into an identity free representation. For example, in the testing of an unusual postulate, the query asks to characterize patients who have a specific health problem and who receive a specific therapy in terms of the seniority of their attending physicians.\n\nthe source entity In order to answer the query, the source entity must compare records with same patient names & IDs to name & ID specific physician records. However, the answer is a table of seniority brackets of physicians compared to a data cluster of multiple patients' data. According to this type of example, a pharmaceutical company user could find out from a plurality of HMOs source-entity records if the company should market its therapy primarily to senior physicians or primarily to junior physicians, or both. Simply stated, the query test one possible postulate about the civilization of physiciansâ and that query has interesting economic implications for pharmaceutical companies.\n\nthe sub-step \"(A-iv) aggregating the plurality of files into a data-warehouseâ goes further to protect privacy by bundling the responses of the individual source- entities into a large source-entity de-identified data collection and at the same time deliver results from multiple distributed and different data-sources.\n\nthe sub-step \"(A-v) using the parameter list, extracting query relevant data from the data- warehouseâ allows for getting all the relevant data of the data warehouse to a single temporary collections including responses from one or more source-entity query- response cycles and other data which may come from the ordinary reporting of source-entities or others.\n\nthe first two sub-steps call for ordinary operations-such as \"(B-i) accumulating data-items wherein some of the data-items have privacy sensitive micro-data, and (B-ii) organizing the data- items using the plurality of predetermined attributes\".\n\nthe sub-steps (B-iii) via the topologyâ receiving a parameter list from the \"aggregatorâ processorâ let the source-entity begin to participate in the user initiated \"projectâ that is being managed by the aggregator.\n\nthe next sub-step â(B-iv) forming a file by \"crunching togetherâ the data- items according to the parameter listâ causes each respective source-entity to perform the necessary internal data base queries and to perform the necessary correlations and formation of temporary data- interrelationships in order to know the local answer to all or part of the initial user query that was sent through the aggregator.\n\nthe parameter list included specific individuals by name or ID or the likes\n\n\"Crunching togetherâ may involve name matching through \"fuzzy logicâ and other name matching algorithms of the population defined by the parameter list with the source-entity database names, in addition to the other steps defined above.\n\nthe sub-step \"(B-v) filtering out portions of the file which characterize details particular to less than a predetermined quantity of micro-data-specific data-itemsâ eliminates portions of the answer which might allow the user to guess the identity some data attributeâ because that data attribute belongs to an individual or to a very small group of members. This step is necessaryâ since it eliminates one degree of trust from the relationship between the source-entity and the aggregator. In all good conscience, the source-entity has preserved his duty to protect the identity of individuals in his data collection.\n\nfiltering is synonymous for implementing a privacy threshold at the \"source-entity\" level.\n\nthe aggregator may now collect and assemble identity protected reports from numerous data collections (source-entities) and assemble them into a single report- thereby potentially greatly increasing the statistical significance of conclusions that can be drawn from the aggregator report to the user.\n\nthe very revealing aspect that all or most of the result may be coming from a single source-entity is protected. For example, it might be very politically sensitive to realize that attitudes of physicians in one HMO radically differ from physicians in all other HMOsâ and this peculiarity may be hidden from the user by using an aggregator.\n\nagglomerating the extract includes filtering out portions of the extract which characterize details particular to less than a predetermined quantity data- items.\n\nfiltering out portions of the extract which characterize details particular to less than a predetermined quantity data-items includes the predetermined quantity being selected from the list, ordinal number, percentage of instances in the data- warehouse, data instances outside of mean plus predetermined number of standard distribution units.\n\nagglomerating the extract includes filtering out portions of the extract so that only identity- free micro-data or identity-free aggregated data remains.\n\naccepting a query includes performing a preprocessing privacy check against a predetermined source- entity data-ensemble model.\n\n\"crunching together\" the data-items includes joining data-items having a mutual or similar micro- data-specific (for example similar names with variations such as nick name, prefix, suffix, etc.).\n\nAt least one sub-step includes fuzzy matching.\n\nfiltering out portions of the file which characterize details particular to less than a predetermined quantity of micro-data-specific data- items includes selecting the predetermined quantity from the list, an ordinal number, a percentage of instances in the data- warehouse, data instances outside of statistical mean-or-median plus-and/or-minus a predetermined number of Standard deviation units.\n\naccepting a query includes transforming the query into a standardized queryâ capable of resulting in a syndicated reporting of the agglomerated extract.\n\na Markup Language be used which directly links aspects of the query with aspects of the reportingâ since it is anticipated that various industries will adopt the instant protocol to produce substantially real-time \"testimoniesâ.\n\nSome collateral embodiments of the instant invention relate to (see FIG. 6) a program storage device 600 readable by machine, tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by the machine to perform method steps for \"aggregator\" data processor functions in a Privacy Preserving Data-Mining Protocol, said method steps including: (i) from a user interfaceâ accepting 610 a query against a plurality of the predetermined attributes and therewith forming 620 a parameter list, (ii) via an electronic data-communications topologyâ transmitting 630 the parameter list to at least one \"source- entityâ processors, (iii) via the topologyâ receiving 640 a respective file from each of the \"source-entityâ processors, (iv) aggregating 650 the plurality of files into a data- warehouse, (v) using the parameter list, extracting 660 query relevant data from the data-warehouse, (vi) agglomerating 670 the extract, and (vii) to a user interfaceâ reporting 680 the agglomerated extract.\n\nFIG. 7 a program storage device 700 readable by machine, tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by the machine to perform method steps for secure \"source- entity\" data processor functions in a Privacy Preserving Data-Mining Protocol, said method steps including: (i) accumulating 710 data-items wherein some of the data- items have privacy sensitive micro-data, (ii) organizing 720 the data-items using the plurality of predetermined attributes, (iii) via an electronic data-communications topologyâ receiving 730 a parameter list from an \"aggregatorâ processor, (iv) forming 740 a file by \"crunching together\" the data- items according to the parameter list, (v) filtering 750 out portions of the file which characterize details particular to less than a predetermined quantity of micro-data-specific data-items, and (vi) via the topologyâ transmitting 760 the file to the \"aggregatorâ processor.\n\na Privacy Preserving Data-Mining Protocol 800 substantially as herein before described and illustrated, firstly characterized by having at least one of mutually independent secure \"source-entityâ data processors 810 respectively forming 820 a file by âcrunching together\" data-items according to a parameter list, and thereafter respectively filtering 830 out portions of the file which characterize details particular to less than a predetermined quantity of micro-data-specific data- items; and secondly characterized by having a secure \"aggregatorâ data processor 850 aggregating 860 the plurality of files into a data- warehouse.\n\nother variation embodiments of the instant protocol are bi-directionalâ meaning that the fundamental relationship between the \"source-entityâ and âaggregatorâ processors is reversed and/or reversible!\n\nthe protocol is characterized by including the data-communications coordinated steps of: the at least one mutually independent secure \"source-entityâ data processors respectively forming a file by âcrunching togetherâ data-items according to a parameter list, and thereafter respectively filtering out portions of the file which characterize details particular to less than a predetermined quantity of micro-data-specific data-items; and the secure \"aggregatorâ data processor aggregating the plurality of files into a data-warehouse.\n\nEmbodiments of the protocol of the instant invention are applicable to many arms- length data rights relationships, including (for example) those that exist between healthcare providers, pharmacies, PBMs or Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) & Pharmaceutical-Companies; electronic commerce & market research; banking & insurance; census bureau & other government agencies; auditors & independent procurement/service organizations; and the likes.\n\na further class of embodiments of the Privacy Preserving Data- Mining Protocol of the present invention is worthy of note; and these are interim data merger enabled embodiments. Simply stated, these embodiments allow for the linkage of data items as related to a common entity. For example, an individual was a regular member of a first health care medical expense insurance plan and then switched to become a member of a second health care medical expense insurance plan.\n\nFIGS. 3 and 8 and Mutatis Mutandis to their respective program storage devices\n\nthe encryption and/or merger could be enable during the sub-steps: receiving a respective file, or aggregating the plurality of files; or on the \"source-entity\" processors' side, the encryption and/or merger could be enabled during the sub-steps: organizing the data- items, forming a file, or filtering out portions of the file.\n\nthe result may be several combinations of personal identifiers for the same personâfor example (Jane Doe, (Boston, Mass.), health-plan ID 1234) and (Jane Doe, (New York, N.Y.) health-plan ID 5678) may both appear in a single data source. Since the name matching preferably has \"fuzzy logic\", the software in the data source will find both.\n\nthe personal IDs When releasing data from the data source to the data aggregator, the personal IDs will be encryptedâ but using the same key in all data sourcesâ a key that will preferably not be known to the Crossix protocol operator, but only a trusted third party such as an escrow agent. Now assume that a second data source also had data for (Jane Doe, (New York, N.Y.) health-plan ID 5678).\n\nevery step requiring a transmitting of data (or of at least one file) and every respective associated step requiring receiving of that data (or of that at least one file) may preferably include respective encryption and decryptionâ however the nature and quality of this security aspect is well understood by the systems administrator; in the context of his specific regulatory environment, etc. Nevertheless, it is generally preferable to include some degree of data transmission security. (Compliant with this rationale, process occurring in processors of running the instant protocol should be secure-and certified as such.)\n\na query relationship such as pharmaceutical companies and HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations), market researchers and credit card companies, government agencies and the census bureau, Law Enforcement Agencies seeking to understand general aspects of a social problem (as recorded in countless private data-banks) without needing a search warrant for any specific individual or class or individuals, and similar heretofore detail-opaque query and answer data opportunities.\n\nAt least one of an at least two electronic data providers is selected from the list: data source entity, data consumer entity, health program, pharmaceutical manufacturer/distributor, public health regulator/monitor; credit card bureau, market research organization, banking consortium, census bureau, government agency, or the likes.\n\na further example relates to the inclusion of at least a predetermined minimum number of individuals (identified by name or ID, address, phone number, date of birth, e-mail or the likes or a combination thereof) into a \"parameter list\" (that is formed or transmitted in the instant protocol)â and these individuals may be persons or legal entities or individual motor vehicles or individual computers or serial numbering industrial products or legal registration numbers or license numbers or the likes.\n\na parameter list including \"individuals\" should carry a stronger level of encryption.\n\nFIG. 9 A further embodiment of the present invention is shown in Figures 9 and 10.\n\nthe aggregator processor does not have access to the information at either the data consumer entity/entities (and/or the data originator entity/entities) or the data source entity/entities.\n\nThis embodiment can be thought of as \"double- blinded\" because the aggregator processor is blind to both the privacy-sensitive information at the data consumer entity/entities (and/or the data originator entity/entities) and the privacy- sensitive information at the data source entity/entities.\n\nthe aggregator processor does have access to the matched and de-identified results of the query, so that the aggregator processor can analyze those results and deliver the final analysis result to the data consumer entity/entities.\n\nthe other embodiments can be thought of as \"single-blinded\" because the aggregator processor is blind to the privacy-sensitive information at the data source entity/entities, although the aggregator does have access to the information at the data consumer entity/entities (and/or the data originator entity/entities) despite its privacy- sensitive nature.\n\nthe double-blinded embodiment is used in situations where the information at the data consumer entity/entities (and/or the data originator entity/entities) is sensitive, and not even the aggregator should have exposure to it.\n\nthe data consumer entity is a cable TV company that has detailed records (possibly second-by-second) of household cable-box channel settings, household billing information and advertising schedules (i.e., which ads were broadcasted on what channel at what time).\n\nthe cable company information reveals what TV show or other entertainment content a particular household was watching at a particular time, and through this information it can be deduced which advertisements that particular household was exposed to.\n\nthe cable company's information is privacy sensitive and can not be released to the aggregator as is, because it contains the family name, their address, or other identifying indicia along with information about the family's viewing habits that the family may not wish to be known. Indeed, the cable TV company may also wish the viewing habits of specific families to remain private, in order to avoid the negative publicity should it become known that the cable TV company did not keep such information private.\n\npharmacies pharmacies\n\nHIPAA Healthcare Company\n\nAnother reason the information at the data consumer entity could be privacy- sensitive is that it may not even be the data consumer entity's own information. Instead, the information may be acquired by the data consumer entity from a third party who requires that the information be kept private.\n\nthis \"originating information\" may not be available to the data consumer entity at all, and may instead be provided by a data originator entity who is a third party unconnected with the data consumer entity.\n\nThis latter situation is shown in Figures 11 and 12, and is exemplified by the following situation: let's say the data consumer entity is a pharmaceutical company that wishes to have a certain business question answered. The pharmaceutical company does not have access to originating information, and the originating information is instead provided by a third party - for example a cable TV company - with suitable information that can generate a list of specific instances which meet the conditions in the query. In this situation, the data consumer entity is not involved in generating the list at the front end of the process. However, the data consumer entity of course still receives the analysis results from the aggregator at the back end of the process, so that the data consumer entity's business question is answered.\n\nthe situation discussed above wherein the data consumer entity does not have access to any or all of the originating information, and at least some of the originating information is instead provided by a third party - a \"data originator entity\" - with suitable information that can generate a list of specific instances which meet the conditions in the query, can also exist for the single-blinded embodiments described herein. Said another way, the situation wherein a separate data originator entity (not the data consumer entity) supplies the originating information can exist in cases where the originating information can be shared with the aggregator, and cases where it cannot.\n\nFIGS. 1 & 2 illustrate schematic flow charts of prior art methods\n\nFIG. 3 & 8 illustrate schematic views of respective embodiments of the instant protocol\n\nFIGS. 4, 4A & 5 illustrate detailed aspects of the preferred embodiment of the instant protocol.\n\nFIGS. 6 & 7 illustrate schematic views of program storage devices respectively having a portion of the instant protocol thereat.\n\nFIGS. 9 and 10 are flow diagrams illustrating the double-blinded embodiment of the invention, wherein the aggregator processor does not have access to the information at either the data consumer entity/entities or the data source entity/entities - yet, the aggregator processor does have access to the matched and de- identified results of the query.\n\nFIGS. 11 and 12 are flow diagrams illustrating additional double-blinded embodiments of the invention, wherein the originating data is supplied by a data originator entity/entities instead of the data consumer entity.\n\nembodiments of the instant profile are computer-implemented for profiling health programsâ to assist program planners such as marketing managers from pharmaceutical manufacturers or other health promotion managers to assess the aggregate behavior of a large group of participants impacted by a specific health program compared to a control group.\n\nthe assessment of the impact of a particular program is done by profiling participants aggregate objective health transaction data (pharmacy, treatment, diagnosis, lab, etc.) to conclude various effects of the health program compared with a possibly defined control group while adhering to current and evolving privacy standards and laws such as HIPAA.\n\nObjective health transaction data resides within healthcare organizations such as health service providers (doctors, hospitals, labs, etc.) and health plans (managed care plans, HMOs, PPOs, insurance companies, pharmacy benefit managers, self-insured employers, state and federal government health benefit programs, etc.). These organizations are governed by a set of privacy standards, rules and regulations such as HIPAA and therefore has severe limitation in their use of healthcare information that includes identifiable personal health information.\n\na pharmaceutical company that manufacture a pharmaceutical product for the treatment of multiple sclerosis has established several health programs to encourage consumers of that product to use the product persistently and correctly.\n\nSuch health programs include a Call Center Program staffed by nurses who can answer ongoing questions and train consumers on how to use the product correctly and a Web- Site Program that includes health management tools and access to relevant disease information.\n\nThese pharmaceutical health programs are promoted to consumers of that product who then opt-in to participate in the program.\n\nthe participants of each program allow, among other things, the pharmaceutical manufacturer to analyze their data in aggregate.\n\nSome of the participants of the manufacturer health programs belong to various healthcare organizations that aggregate health transactions generated by the consumers in their ongoing consumption of healthcare services and products. This health transactions data includes diagnosis data, treatment data, pharmacy data and sometimes clinical data such as lab data and other health data.\n\nApplying the method of the instant protocol include necessary, sufficient, and elective operationsâ according to the \"reality\" of the current non- limiting example; and these operations include: Extracting the lists of participants in the Call Center Program and the Web-Site Program (names, addresses and other possible identifiable information); Providing a definition of control group. For example, all consumers who consume the manufacturer product but are not participants in either the Call Center Program or Web-Site Program; then Providing a definition of analysis required. For example, a mathematical definition for persistent usage of the pharmaceutical product, or total cost of healthcare consumed, or hospitalization cost, etc.\n\nSome analyses can be fairly complex and use other processes and patented methods such as ETG (e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos.\n\nHealth plans tend to be mutually exclusive, meaning if a member belongs to any plan, that member typically belongs to that one plan only or is likely to consume similar service at a similar time from only one health plan. Therefore, this algorithm can be usedâ by repeating the same process with multiple health plans; and then simply summing the results from all health plans.\n\nthe query engine runs a \"fuzzy matching\" algorithm to match participants in the pharmaceutical health program with the health transactions at the healthcare organization; For all the matched users the query engine runs the analysis of their health transaction data to determine the result of the requested analysis (such as persistency of using the pharmaceutical product); The query engine runs the control group analysis for all users that were not matched but meet the control group definition (for example, users of the pharmaceutical product); and Aggregate the results to the following groups: Call Center Program participants only; Web-Site Program participants only; participants in both the Call Center Program and the Web- Site Program; Control group (for example, all consumers of the pharmaceutical product that are neither participants of the Call Center Program nor the Web-Site Program).\n\nFor each group provide the following result: Name of group, % participants matched with the healthcare organization health transaction data, and statistical result of all matched members (such as average persistency rate);\n\nthe query engine determines whether the number of participants in each program and the % participants matched are above a level that ensures consumer individual privacy (based on a statistical definition). If not, the query engine responds with: group name \"cannot be analyzed because of privacy safeguards. Please try to define a bigger group of users\"; and the query engine output for each health plan is aggregated to provide an overall output that may be shared with the pharmaceutical manufacturer.\n\nThis instant protocol method offers valuable aggregate assessment of health programs based on objective health transaction data without disclosing identifiable personal health information.\n\nMost methods used today are based on \"soft measurements\" of value, such as activity-based measurements (people enrolled, number of interactions, etc.) and/or self-reported data (participants fill surveys or other questionnaire regarding their behavior). Objective measurement based on health transaction could become the gold-standard to measure such activities.\n\nthe existing healthcare analytics model does not provide the capability to aggregate the behavior of a group of patients by a predefined list of consumers participating in a health program. This is only one example of the limitations of the existing healthcare analytics model that is addressed by the instant protocol.\n\nthe instant protocol embodiment is a method to enable the statistical measurement of one or more Health Programs and the compounded effect of combination of multiple Health Programs based on analysis of health transaction data while complying with Data Source Entity privacy regulations and Data Consumer Entity privacy policy.\n\nan example of \"classic\" model of health analytics calls for aggregation of de-identified patient-level or physician- level data which allow the central analysis model only (see FIGS. 1 & 2).\n\nthe common method used by existing healthcare analytics companies (such as IMS, Wolters Kluwer Health (formerly NDCHealth) and SDI (formerly Verispan) is based on the following steps: (A) De-identify & Aggregate-patient data is de-identified (some data is removed or grouped together) and data is reported typically at the physician level.\n\nthe dataset includes longitudinal de-identified patient- level data (such as Verispan and Dendrite) (B) Collect from various sourcesâ data is collected from multiple healthcare organizations into a data warehouse (C) Analyzeâ syndicated data reports and custom studies are produced.\n\nB longitudinal de-identified patient- level data\n\nC Analyzeâ syndicated data reports and custom studies are produced.\n\nthe instant Crossix \"methodâ is based on an opposite sequence: (A) Analyzeâthe healthcare organization (such as health plan) runs an analysis software that receive as an input the required analysis and aggregation level as well as possibly a list of identifiable patients or physicians for which analysis is requested. This analysis is performed on the original, most complete data set; (B) De-identify & Aggregate- Once name matching and analysis is complete data is aggregated and, if needed, de- identified; (C) and Collect from various sources-Analysis responses from multiple organization are composed to deliver the analyses requested.\n\nA Analyzeâthe healthcare organization (such as health plan) runs an analysis software that receive as an input the required analysis and aggregation level as well as possibly a list of identifiable patients or physicians for which analysis is requested.

In this latter case, the information on the lists is kept confidential because the aggregator 900 does not have a decryption key which will decrypt it.\n\nthe matching is done using a matching algorithm similar to the one described for the single-blind embodiments, without necessarily providing access by data source entities 920 to a particular data consumer entity's privacy- sensitive information.\n\nthe data source entities can perform the matching on encrypted data received from data consumer entities 910 (in which case the Date Cruncher Module exemplified in FIG. 5 employs a decryption key), or on unencrypted data received from data consumer entities 910 (in which case the Date Cruncher Module exemplified in FIG. 5 does not need to employ a decryption key).\n\nthe matched individuals' data are de- identified using methods and systems similar to those described earlier for the single-blind embodiments, and sent back to aggregator 900.\n\nAggregator 900 merges the results from data source entities 920 into one combined Final Analysis Result, using methods and systems similar to those described earlier for the single-blind embodiments, and sends the Final Analysis Result to the one or more data consumer entities 910.\n\nFigure 10 illustrates another double -blinded embodiment wherein instead of aggregator 900 generating the query, the data consumer entity 920 generates the query, and using its privacy-sensitive information, develops the list of specific instances (e.g., households) that meet the conditions of the query.\n\ndata consumer entity 920 can encrypt the list in multiple ways before sending it directly to data source entities 920, or can send the list to data source entities 920 unencrypted.\n\ndata consumer entity 910 can send its encrypted list through aggregator 900, in which case aggregator 900 forwards the list to data source entities 920.\n\naggregator 900 is not involved in generating the query on the front end of the process, but still aggregates the results from data source entities 920 into one combined Final Analysis Result and provides that result to data consumer entity 910.\n\nFigure 11 illustrates yet another double -blinded embodiment similar to Figure 9, except that a separate data originator entity 930 provides the originating information, and thus aggregator 900 sends the query to data originator entity 930 and not to data consumer entity 910.\n\nData originator entity 930 uses its information to generate a list of specific instances that meet the conditions in the query, optionally encrypts the list using any suitable encryption method including those previously described herein, and sends the list to data source entities 920, either directly or through aggregator 900.\n\ndata originator entities 930 are shown as one box, rather than showing a separate box for each data originator entity.\n\nthe other aspects of this embodiment match those of the Figure 9 embodiment - for example, at the end of the process, data consumer entity 910 still receives the Final Analysis Result from aggregator 900.\n\nFigure 12 illustrates yet another double -blinded embodiment similar to Figure 10, except that a separate data originator entity 930 provides the originating information, instead of data consumer entity 910.\n\nData originator entity 930 also formulates the query, uses its information to generate a list of specific instances that meet the conditions in the query, optionally encrypts the list, and sends the list to data source entities 920, either directly or through aggregator 900.\n\ndata originator entities 930 are shown as one box, rather than showing a separate box for each data originator entity.\n\nthe other aspects of this embodiment match those of the Figure 10 embodiment - for example, at the end of the process, data consumer entity 910 still receives the Final Analysis Result from aggregator 900.\n\nembodiments of the instant invention relate to the protocol as a whole, individually to respective aspects operating on an \"aggregatorâ processor and on a âsource-entityâ processor;
