        "text": "Whether you’re considering insurance through your employer or purchasing coverage on your own, we can help guide you through your different options so you can get the coverage you need.\n\nStanford Health Care is contracted with most major health insurance carriers. Coverage for your care at Stanford Health Care is determined by your insurance company and is based on the provisions of your specific plan.\n\nTo verify Stanford Health Care has in-network status for your plan, please look for your plan in the appropriate insurance category below. You may also want to contact your insurance provider directly to confirm Stanford Health Care's status. You may be asked for our group NPI or Tax ID.\n\nInsurance Types\n\nPlease click on any of the insurance types listed below to find out our status with each of these plans.\n\nCoverage Through Your Job\n\nCovered California and Individual-Family Plans\n\nCalPERS\n\nMedi-Cal\n\nMedicare\n\nTRICARE and TriWest\n\nIf you are a UHA patient, visit University HealthCare Alliance, dba Stanford Medicine Partners for insurance coverage.\n\nIf you or your child is a patient at Stanford Children's Health, visit Stanford Medicine Children's Health for insurance coverage.\n\nIf you are a Stanford Health Care Tri-Valley patient, visit Stanford Health Care Tri-Valley.\n\nBehavioral Health\n\nPlease be aware that visits with behavioral health professionals will be billed to your behavioral health/mental health insurance carrier.\n\nYour behavioral health insurance (also called mental health insurance) may be different than your medical insurance which covers your medical treatment.\n\nUnderstanding behavioral health/mental health insurance benefits:\n\nMost insurance plans offer medical coverage and behavioral health/mental health coverage, however, they may not always access the same network of providers. Your behavioral health insurance may access a “carve out” network or third-party insurer.\n\nYour insurance plan network might have different provider or medical facility restrictions for behavioral health versus your medical care.\n\nAs a result of the potential different network restrictions covered by your behavioral health/mental health plan, your insurance plan might cover your medical treatment at Stanford Health Care, but not cover behavioral health services at Stanford Health Care.\n\nThis could be the case even if your behavioral health issues relate entirely to your medical treatment.\n\nWhen you are referred to Stanford Health Care behavioral health services, our benefits specialists will determine your behavioral health coverage and associated network of providers and will discuss with you any limitations prior to being scheduled for a New Patient Visit.\n\nWhat if I don’t have coverage?\n\nIf your behavioral health benefit plan will not allow you to be seen by a member of the behavioral health team, we encourage you to work with our Stanford Health Care social workers and your medical team to seek assistance in selecting a mental health provider who participates in your behavioral health network. You also have the option to seek services at Stanford Health Care outside of your behavioral health benefits as a self-payment status for which a patient financial counselor could further assist you in understanding those options.\n\nIf you do have behavioral health coverage for services at Stanford Health Care…"
