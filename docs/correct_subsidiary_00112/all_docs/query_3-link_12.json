The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:34 a.m. in room SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. John D. Rockefeller, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA The Chairman. Good morning, everybody. Today's hearing is the first of two hearings--which works out very well, the setup of the two hearings--that we're holding to look at deceptive payment practices that the health insurance industry has gotten away with for the last decade, probably longer. The victims of this deceptive practice were probably most of the people sitting in this hearing room today, along with the more than 100 million Americans who pay for health insurance coverage that allows them to go outside of their provider network for, you know, medical care. Having the ability to get health care service outside of the network is a very important option for American consumers, and it's an option that they pay for--and they know they're going to pay for that--in the form of higher premiums, higher deductibles, and higher coinsurance payments. Now, Dr. Jerome should be sitting here today. We are--Dr. Mary Jerome--she's a resident of Yonkers, New York. She has been fighting ovarian cancer since 2006. She had planned to be here, but she just can't physically make it, today. But, I'm still going to say something about her. According to her testimony, Dr. Jerome received her health care coverage through a point-of-service plan, which encouraged her to get care within a provider network, but also allowed her to see out-of-network providers, if she so desired and it was necessary. So, here's what she says in her testimony, ``I had always been confident that paying for the out-of-network option provided peace of mind with respect to the financial burdens associated with catastrophic medical costs.'' After her cancer diagnosis, Dr. Jerome and her in-network primary-care physician decided that she needed to be treated at a health care provider that was outside of her network; that one being in Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York City. Dr. Jerome knew she was going to have to pay some portion of these costs out of her own pocket, but she also assumed, in good faith, that the treatment was going to be covered by her insurance. What we're going to learn today is that American consumers like Dr. Jerome, people who have been paying higher premiums for the choice to see out-of-network doctors, have not been getting what they have been paying for. We're going to hear testimony suggesting that the health insurance industry has been systematically low-balling American consumers. And this is a very upsetting situation, one which has been revealed in New York. And if we have to have 50 hearings for 50 states, I'll be glad to do that, too. They have been promising, these insurance companies, to pay a certain share of the consumers' medical bills, but they have been rigging health care-charge data to avoid paying their fair share. The result is that billions of dollars in health care costs have been unfairly shifted to Dr. Jerome and millions of other American consumers like her; as I said, probably many in this room. So, here's how it works. The insurance company generally promises to reimburse out-of-network medical services at what they refer to in the industry as the ``usual, customary, and reasonable rate.'' Usually, just the word ``usual and customary.'' Well, the problem is that it's been the insurance industry who has been deciding what is ``usual, customary, and reasonable,'' what that means. They make that decision. Consumers have not had any input. Doctors and other health care providers have not had any input. The chairman of the American Medical Association has not had any input. Only the insurance companies have been getting to decide what's reasonable, which is like letting the fox define ``usual, customary, and reasonable'' in the henhouse. You understand that. Senator McCaskill. I do. We have both, in Missouri. Fox and henhouse. The Chairman. So, the good news is that, thanks to a series of lawsuits and a year-long investigation by the New York Attorney General's Office, the insurance companies that operate in New York, including, most importantly, UnitedHealth Group, and its medical information subsidiary, Ingenix, have been forced to change the way they do business. And Ms. Lacewell has a lot to do with that. Conclusion--our goal for today is to get an update on how the reforms proposed in New York are being implemented, and to understand how the deceptive practices uncovered in New York have been harming customers in the other 49 States. I'm looking forward to this testimony, especially at a time when our country is going through all kinds of murderous economic situations for people to pay any kind of health insurance at all. I would, finally, like to note that missing from our hearing today is one group of stakeholders who played an indispensable role in creating and perpetuating this unfair reimbursement system, but who will also play an essential role in changing it, and that is a little group called the insurance industry. On March 9, I invited the CEOs of UnitedHealth Group and Ingenix to testify at this hearing, because we wanted to hear their side of the story, because we're always fair here. Because UnitedHealthcare told us that their CEO, Mr. Stephen Hemsley, was not available to testify today, we agreed to hold a second hearing, next week. So that's what we're going to do on Tuesday. That's very important, for observers and for press and for members here to know that. It's perfect. We get--we have the good guys, and then we have the other guys. [Laughter.] The Chairman. The good guys are today, the other guys-- you're going to set up next Tuesday. So, at 10 a.m. next Tuesday, we'll be holding a hearing, during which we hope to gain a better understanding of the insurer's perspective. Now, I, at this point, usually call on the Ranking Member, and I don't see one, so what I would like to do is call--is simply to ask you to present your testimony, unless any of our members would care to make a statement. Short statement. Very short statement. STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY Senator Lautenberg. It just keeps getting shorter? The Chairman. Yes. Because I was long. Senator Lautenberg. You're very generous to make that offer. In a place like this, people don't usually make that kind of an offer, so I will take advantage, for a moment, of the Chairman's latitude with allowing just a short statement. Mr. Chairman, as I'm sure you mentioned, in New Jersey and across the country, people are working harder than ever, still struggling to get by. And the worst thing to do is to have to be caught in the middle of a scheme--for them, for the individual--that permits the insurance companies to siphon off more of the profit than they're entitled to. And they do pretty well in that provider--health provider business. And so, we're pleased to have you here. We've had terrible problems, the State of New Jersey. In 2000-2007, premiums in New Jersey rose 71 percent, while workers' earnings increased 15 percent. So, the health care costs in New Jersey, seeing a doctor, getting a prescription, need grew 50 percent from 1999 to 2008. So, we're pleased to have--that you chose to have this hearing, Mr. Chairman, and that we have a chance to learn more about it from people who are directly involved. And we thank you for being here. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Senator Lautenberg follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg, U.S. Senator from New Jersey Mr. Chairman, in New Jersey and across the country, people are working harder than ever before, but still struggling to get by. They are being forced to make devastating choices between paying their mortgage and paying for health care. In these difficult economic times, the cost of health care is putting a tremendous strain on families in my state. Between 2000 and 2007, health care premiums in New Jersey rose seventy-one (71) percent while worker's earnings increased just fifteen (15) percent. In addition, total health care costs in New Jersey--from seeing a doctor to getting the prescriptions people need--grew fifty (50) percent from 1999 to 2008. So when we learn that the insurance industry may be manipulating data to make consumers overpay for their health care, Congress has reason to be concerned and Americans have reason to be angry. One patient in New Jersey was left owing thousands of dollars in health care bills for her breast cancer treatment because her insurance company cooked the books to cover far less of the cost than it should have. This New Jersey patient--like many other patients and families--was forced to pay for care that her insurer should have covered under the terms of her insurance plan. And if that wasn't bad enough, the so-called ``independent organization'' that was supposed to protect all patients by objectively determining how much of the cost should be covered by insurance was owned by an insurance company. That arrangement was a conflict of interest and undermined all Americans' faith in the health care system. I'm pleased that this problem has been resolved, but we must remain vigilant on behalf of consumers. People are willing to do their part. They are willing to pay a fair price for the health care they get. But Americans who work hard to pay their premiums rightfully expect their insurance companies to keep up their end of the bargain. Along with my colleagues, I will fight to keep insurance companies working for Americans--not against them. I look forward to hearing from today's witnesses and seeing how we can stop consumers from getting a raw deal. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Lautenberg. Any other statements? Senator Udall. Let's get to the witnesses. The Chairman. Well, I like that. The first one is Ms. Linda Lacewell. And this is her title. She is Counsel for Economic and Social Justice, and Head of the Healthcare Industry Task Force, and she knows her business very, very well. Obviously, as I indicated, Mary Jerome--Dr. Mary Jerome, could not be here. Dr. Nancy Nielsen, President of the American Medical Association, with the incredible fortune of having been born in Elkins, West Virginia. Dr. Nielsen. That's right. The Chairman. And Mr. Chuck Bell, Programs Director for the Consumers Union. So, we look forward to your statements, starting with you, Ms. Lacewell. STATEMENT OF LINDA A. LACEWELL, COUNSEL FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL JUSTICE AND HEAD OF THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY TASKFORCE, OFFICE OF THE NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL Ms. Lacewell. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the Committee, for inviting me here today with respect to this hearing. It's a pleasure to be here, and it is my privilege to represent the Attorney General of the State of New York, Andrew Cuomo, at this hearing. For the past year, the Attorney General in New York has been conducting an industry-wide investigation with respect to the insurance industry concerning a scheme that is truly, in our view, staggering in scope and impact, affecting, as the Chairman noted, over 100 million Americans around the country-- that is one in three people in this country--a scheme run by the Nation's largest health insurers, as we found, which left working families across the country wrongly stuck with at least hundreds of millions of dollars in unreimbursed medical expenses, a scheme that ran for at least 10 years, and one that is finally coming to an end. The Attorney General is the people's lawyer and seeks to be responsive to their concerns. As a result of that, he travels the State of New York and learns what the issues are of concern to the people. And time and again, the primary concern raised by the people in the State of New York is health care and health care costs and whether or not they're getting the benefit of the bargain of their health insurance. A key concern raised by them with respect to health care is reimbursement for what is known as out-of-network medical costs. About 70 percent of insured Americans have a plan that allows them to choose their own doctor outside of the network of insurers--outside the network that insurers have put together by contract with their doctors. These consumers, it's important to note, do pay more; they pay a higher premium. It costs them more money for this right to go out of network. And that balance of--that bargain is an important one to ensure is met. And they choose to pay more for the right to go out of network because it is fair to say that health care can be a matter of life and death, and choosing a doctor is a critical issue in that regard. Under these out-of-network plans, in exchange for the higher premium, the insurer typically promises to pay a substantial portion, a huge portion, of the anticipated cost, which they refer to as a ``usual and customary rate.'' Frequently, the insurer says, ``I will pay 80 percent of what the usual and customary rate is.'' And that is understood to mean--in the industry, to mean ``the prevailing rate the doctors charge when they have not negotiated a lower rate with the insurer on an in-network basis.'' And this is a critical consumer issue, because in the out- of-network setting, when the insurer does not reimburse the entire bill to the consumer, it is the consumer who is responsible to the doctor to pay the balance of the bill, which would not ordinarily be the case in an in-network setting. So, our investigation sought to determine why the reimbursement rates to consumers were so low, who was determining the rates, and how, and whether, in fact, these rates were fair or not fair. We, therefore, surveyed health insurers operating in the State of New York, which includes some of the largest insurers in the country that operate in New York, UnitedHealth Group, Aetna, CIGNA, WellPoint, which is the largest in the country. And time and again we received the same answer, ``When we determine these rates, we are relying on this independent company, known as Ingenix.'' We then went to Ingenix and said, ``How are you determining these rates?'' And time and again from Ingenix we received the same answer, ``Well, we collect fee information, billing information, from insurers around the country, the largest insurers that there are--United, Aetna, CIGNA, WellPoint, and everybody else. We take all their data, we put it in a database, we mix it up, and we issue these fee information schedules that go to the industry to determine usual and customary rate.'' The natural question then became, Who is Ingenix? And on that question, when you look behind the curtain of this oracle of usual and customary rates, one finds UnitedHealth Group, the second largest insurer--health insurer in the United States, because Ingenix is a wholly owned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, making this essentially a closed-loop system of the health insurance industry collecting the information among itself, pooling the information together, all relying on the same rate information, a system that is impenetrable to the consumer. The Attorney General found, and health insurers have since acknowledged, that there are conflicts of interest here, a picture of conflicts of interest from top to bottom, because each of the health insurers has a reimbursement obligation toward the consumer and therefore has an interest in keeping the reimbursement rate low. So, if the rates are being determined and agreed upon, essentially, by the insurers, and the database is based on their product, there is a significant danger to consumers of underpayment. And our investigation found that, in fact, Ingenix did lead to underpayments. The other problem that we found with this system is that Ingenix has been essentially a black box to consumers, who do not know, first of all, that it is the insurance industry determining what this--what these rates, and second, they don't know how to challenge the rates, and they are almost never given, by the industry, an opportunity to do so. It is important to note, as the Chairman did, that, although this issue may sound technical, it affects almost everyone in the country, and it has a human impact, as demonstrated by the story of Mary Jerome, referred to by the Chairman, who was stuck with tens of thousands of dollars of unanticipated medical costs at a time when she was fighting, not only for her health, but for her life. Having identified this problem, the Attorney General set about to determine an appropriate reform. And when the problem is framed, the answer becomes simple and clear to note, and that is, there must be an independent system that does not have the conflicts of interest that currently exist; there should be a database that is independent; we feel it should be run by a not-for-profit company associated with a university, which has an interest in the database being accurate, because it will also be used for academic research; and the system should be reformed in that way. And also, it is critical that consumers across the country get some transparency into their reimbursement rates so that they know ahead of time what their costs are going to be, what their out-of-pocket expense is going to be, before they shop for a doctor. And in that regard, it is the Attorney General's goal that there be a website ultimately available to consumers where they can go to find out, in their area, what their reimbursement rates are likely to be for various medical services. UnitedHealth Group and Ingenix have agreed to sign on to these reforms, and we have commended them for that, and we continue to do so. When the new database is ready, they will shut down the existing Ingenix database. They are funding the new, independent not-for-profit with $50 million, and the rest of the industry, like dominos, has quickly followed suit, and we have now collected about $95 million to institute these reforms. We are also working closely with the New York Department of Insurance to make these reforms permanent, and we believe there is a need for a new regulation to end, once and for all, the conflicts of interest that derailed the existing system, and to bring new rigor and transparency so that this problem can never happen again. The Attorney General strongly believes that states are a laboratory for reforms and advancements in many areas, including health care, and we hope that the new regulation in New York will serve as a model for the Nation so that the goals of accuracy, transparency, and fairness in out-of-network reimbursement for consumers like Mary Jerome can be met. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Lacewell follows:] Prepared Statement of Linda A. Lacewell, Counsel for Economic and Social Justice and Head of the Healthcare Industry Taskforce, Office of the Attorney General, State of New York I thank Chairman Rockefeller, Ranking Member Hutchison, and the Members of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation for inviting me to speak this morning. It is my pleasure to be here today on behalf of New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. Background Over the last year-and-a-half, the Office of the Attorney General has conducted an investigation into how the health insurance industry reimburses consumers for out-of-network health care services. During the course of the investigation, we uncovered a fraudulent and conflict-of-interest-ridden reimbursement scheme. These deceptive, industry-wide practices affected millions of patients and their families and cost them hundreds of millions of dollars in unexpected and unjust medical costs. As the Attorney General travels around the State of New York and addresses local community forums, the number one concern people raise is health care. It is easy to see why the results of this investigation have struck a chord with the public. Our nation faces a health care crisis. In addition to the obvious problems of the uninsured and the underinsured, our investigation has found that under-reimbursement of the insured is a major problem. Until now, it has been a hidden problem. This is not just a problem in the State of New York. Nationwide, medical costs are the leading cause of individual bankruptcy, even though the individual usually had insurance. Fraudulent under-reimbursement for insured Americans is one part of this negative equation for consumers. Of insured Americans, about 70 percent pay higher premiums for the right to select their own doctor. That's 110 million people or 1 in 3 insured Americans. The reasons vary. Some people want the freedom to make decisions about their families' health care while others cannot find the best physician to treat a particular condition in their insurer's network. Those who carry out-of-network coverage sometimes need it when they least expect it. Patients are admitted to in-network hospitals and through no choice of their own are treated by out-of- network doctors there, resulting in anticipated, high medical costs for the consumers involved. In exchange for higher premiums, the insurer promises to pay a large portion of the bill when a consumer has seen an out-of-network doctor. Typically, health insurers promise to pay a percentage of the bill, often it is 80 percent, of market rate, which the industry calls the ``usual and customary'' or ``reasonable and customary'' rate, also known as ``UCR.'' The ``usual and customary'' rate is supposed to be a fair reflection of the market rate of doctors across the country for all kinds of medical services, and we found that consumers read the term that way. If the insurer does not reimburse the consumer at that level because the insurer did not deem the doctor's charges to be usual, customary or reasonable, the consumer is responsible for paying the balance of the bill. As a result, consumers who choose to go out of network have to pay more for medical care than they anticipated. In this way, out-of-network policies can be a financial trap for consumers, leading to unexpected health care debts. Moreover, when health insurers fail to explain accurately or clearly what they will pay for out-of-network care, consumers are unable to make intelligent and informed decisions about their health care. I will take the next few minutes to elaborate on the inherent conflicts of interest in the consumer reimbursement system, and how we are moving the industry away from this self-serving model and toward reform of the out-of-network reimbursement system. Conflict of Interest For 10 years, the ``usual and customary'' rate for the entire industry has been decided by one company: Ingenix. As we learned, the largest health insurers throughout the country use Ingenix to determine ``usual and customary'' rates. Who is Ingenix? Early on in our investigation we discovered that Ingenix is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Nation's second largest health insurer, UnitedHealth Group. As both a user of and contributor to the Ingenix database, UnitedHealth clearly had an interest in depressing reimbursement rates, causing consumers to pay more. Shortly thereafter, we learned that many other national health insurers also contributed their billing data to this database and then used the database as a benchmark for reimbursement rates. This resulted in the creation of a closed system, leaving no real options for consumers. Reasonable and customary rates are supposed to fairly reflect market rates, but our investigation revealed that Ingenix is nothing more than a conduit for rigged information that is defrauding consumers of their right to fair reimbursements for their out-of-network health care costs. All the while consumers are left to sort through confusing policy language and are then stuck with the balance of their doctors' bills. To make matters worse, health insurers routinely hide this conflict of interest from their members in obscure policy language making it a problem that is nearly impossible to detect. Lack of Transparency During the investigation, our Office subpoenaed a broad range of plan documents describing out-of-network policies. Our review of these materials revealed a shocking lack of transparency and accuracy. Most insurers failed to disclose accurately and clearly what they would pay or how they would determine payment for out-of-network care. In one case, we found that a national insurer had filled an entire page with alternative ways of how it purported to calculate out-of-network rates in language that was unintelligible. As expected, none of the insurers accurately described the role Ingenix played in determining those reimbursement rates. The Ingenix Data base Under-Reimburses Consumers Ultimately, our investigation found that the Ingenix schedules themselves, created in a well of conflicts, are unreliable, inadequate, and wrong--often forcing consumers to bear an even greater burden of the cost of care. UnitedHealth had a financial incentive to understate the ``usual and customary'' rate so as to reduce the amount reimbursed to consumers. For the same reason, other insurers had a financial incentive to manipulate the data they provided to the Ingenix database so that the pooled data would skew reimbursement rates downward. When combined with Ingenix's lack of incentive to audit the data it received and pooled, consumers were continually at risk of being under- reimbursed. As part of our investigation, in an effort to determine the level of accuracy of the Ingenix database, we collected and analyzed millions of health care bills from a variety of sources, including a range of insurers operating within New York State. Our analysis showed that insurers systematically under-reimburse New Yorkers for doctor's office visits and that there were wide disparities when comparing various regions across the State. Underpayments of up to 10 to 20 percent in Manhattan alone translated to millions of dollars in underpayments. When extrapolated across the State and the country, it is fair to say that the Ingenix database have caused Americans to be under-reimbursed by hundreds of millions of dollars over the past 10 years. Ingenix has been a ``black box'' for consumers who do not know their out-of-pocket cost of medical services before receiving them and has driven up costs when consumers cannot get the best value for their dollar before choosing a provider because they cannot comparison shop. Mary Jerome's story stands out in my mind and illustrates the point. Mary Jerome is a college professor in New York who was found to have ovarian cancer in 2006 and was left with tens of thousands of dollars in unreimbursed medical bills. Her doctor recommended she be treated at leading cancer center Memorial Sloan Kettering where she expected to pay no more than her $3,000 deductible for going out of network. Soon she faced bills that left her $70,000 to $80,000 in debt and was forced to navigate a complicated appeals process with her health insurer while trying to recover from a devastating illness. Cases like Mary Jerome's inspired us to think more broadly about the kinds of industry reforms that were needed to protect patients, who could be focused on recovering physically instead of having to spend time and energy trying to recover their health care costs. Solutions After consulting with a number of stakeholders, including consumer advocates, representatives from the physician community, and health care economists, our primary objectives became clear. First, the ``usual and customary'' or market rates for health care charges have to be determined by an independent third party free of conflicts of interest, using a fair, objective, and reliable database. Second, before consumers choose an out-of-network doctor, they should have a range or estimate of what it will cost them. Consumers need more information about how they will be reimbursed and they need it earlier in the decision-making process. To resolve this industry-wide issue, we zeroed in on the source of the problem: Ingenix and UnitedHealth, Ingenix's parent company. Once UnitedHealth acknowledged that there were inherent conflicts of interest in the reimbursement system, it not only agreed to stop making the Ingenix database available to other insurers for purposes of calculating usual and customary rates, but also agreed to contribute fifty million dollars for the creation of a new, independent database that will become a new industry standard. After the agreement with UnitedHealth was announced, our Office quickly secured agreements with the other leading insurers around the country, as well as the largest insurers in New York State, to stop using Ingenix to calculate out-of- network reimbursement rates and contribute resources to the new database. To date, in addition to the agreement with UnitedHealth, we have also entered into agreements with WellPoint, Aetna, CIGNA, MVP Health Care/Preferred Care, Independent Health, HealthNow, CDPHP, Excellus, GHI/HIP (EmblemHealth), and Guardian Life Insurance Company. The funds we collect will go toward the creation of a not-for- profit entity that will operate the new, independent database designed to fairly reflect the market and create a website available to consumers to provide reimbursement information so that consumers can make more informed decisions and better manage their health care costs before they shop. The not-for-profit entity will set up the database, which will: be a credible source for the industry and consumers not be controlled by the industry determine rates fairly reflecting the market, and collect information that goes beyond the limited information collected and provided by Ingenix. These industry reforms will bring accuracy, transparency, and independence to a broken system and keep hundreds of millions of dollars in the pockets of over one hundred million Americans. Need for Additional Regulation Our office has also been working with the New York State Department of Insurance to revise and improve the rules regarding consumer reimbursements. We believe there is a need for a new regulation to end once and for all the conflicts of interest that derailed the previous system and to bring new rigor to the system. First, insurers should not be permitted to use as a source or basis for determining usual and customary rate any entity that has a pecuniary interest in the rates. That includes any insurer, HMO, medical association, or health care provider. Second, insurers should base consumer reimbursements in this area on accurate schedules that fairly reflect the market and are regularly updated. And they should disclose to consumers ahead of time how much they will be reimbursed. National Action The Attorney General believes that the states can serve as laboratories for advances and reforms in areas such as health care. New York should adopt a regulation that serves as a model for the Nation in advancing the goals of accuracy, transparency and fairness in out-of- network reimbursement for consumers. The issue of out-of-network reimbursement is just one example of how our complex health care system burdens consumers without necessarily delivering better outcomes. By the time individuals reach out to our Office for help, they have often spent countless hours trying to decipher coverage language, filling out claims forms, filing appeals with their insurers, negotiating with their providers and trying to make sense of mountains of paperwork--all in an effort to manage their health care costs, and frequently at a time of coping with serious illnesses. Building clarity and accuracy into the reimbursement system can also alleviate these unnecessary burdens on patients and consumers. Conclusion As this Congress tackles the reform of our health care system, the Attorney General asks that it consider ways to make health care transactions more transparent, provide clearer information to consumers about their rights and responsibilities, and hold insurers accountable for providing accurate and complete information to their members. The Attorney General looks forward to providing any assistance the Committee may require to help achieve these goals. The Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Lacewell. Dr. Nielsen? STATEMENT OF NANCY H.

I'm originally from West Virginia, as you heard, and I now live in Buffalo, and I am a practicing internist and also President of the American Medical Association. Thank you very much for inviting me here today to testify about this important issue. We have been involved in this issue for nearly a decade. You have already heard how it worked, that the database was used to determine ``usual, customary, and reasonable fees'' that insurers paid when a patient went out of network. And the patients, as you've also heard, paid extra for the privilege of going out of network. There have been, as you heard from Ms. Lacewell, two precedent-setting settlements by United, one with the AMA and the other with Attorney General Cuomo. And therefore, this abuse is being addressed. My comments will focus on the AMA's lawsuit and its implications for physicians and patients. You might wonder why a doctor would not belong to a network and why people would have to go out of network. Patients understand that all physicians are not part of every network, either because the payer sometimes restricts the network deliberately, or because the physician decides that the fee schedule is not adequate, or that the hoops that they have to jump through are not worth it to get the care that their patients need, or the administrative burdens are too high, or there's simply no benefit to taking a discounted rate when there's no volume that is going to follow. So, there are lots of reasons why physicians sometimes do not join networks. And you've also heard, from Ms. Lacewell, how it works. There is usually a percentage that the insurer agrees to pay for the out-of-network charge. And the patients believe, the consumer believes, that the insurer will pay that percentage of what the doctor charges. What actually happens, as you've heard, is that it's the insurers themselves, through the Ingenix database, that are actually lowering the amount and deciding what is, quote, ``allowed.'' That is a rude awakening for patients like Dr. Mary Jerome. It's also very harmful to patients--to physicians. And the harm is not just financial. This drives a stake in the heart of the doctor-patient relationship, because if you're a patient and you're told that X is the ``usual, customary, and reasonable,'' and your doctor charged Y, what is your assumption? That it is an ``unreasonable'' charge. And that is unfair, and that has damaged the doctor-patient relationship throughout this country, not just in New York. In the year 2000, the AMA and the Medical Societies of the State of Missouri and New York filed suit against United on this issue, exactly. It lay aborning in the courts for many years, despite the best efforts, until the Attorney General took it on. And we are very pleased that the consumers and the doctors worked together with the Attorney General's office. They did the groundbreaking work, got the information that no one else was able to get. How did the database lower those fees? Let me just give you, quickly, four ways. First, they deleted higher charges and any charges with cases that had complications. They included outdated information, discounted rates, and even charges from nonphysicians. They failed to collect relevant information about the site of service, the length of training, the physician qualifications. And when there was no data available in an area, they derived some. Those were the ways that the flaws occurred. The conflicts of interest, you have heard described quite readily, both by the Chairman and by Ms. Lacewell. Ultimately, to be fair, United recognized the importance of restoring its relationship with patients and physicians, and is settling its court battle with the AMA. It agreed to pay $350 million, the largest settlement against any insurer in this country, to compensate under-reimbursed patients and physicians, and to transfer this UCR database from Ingenix to the new not-for-profit entity These settlements will help make sure that patients understand what they're being promised when they purchase an out-of-network service, what their obligation will be, and what the obligation of their insurer will be. We urge Congress to ensure that everyone, including Federal workers, who may have also been shortchanged through these out- of-network benefits, to receive reasonable compensation. We also urge you to pursue payment transparency, because the transparency of the health industry, for payments and for other things, is in everyone's best interest--patients, doctors, and the country as a whole. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Dr. Nielsen follows:] Prepared Statement of Nancy H. Nielsen, M.D., Ph.D., President, American Medical Association The American Medical Association (AMA) appreciates the opportunity to present testimony to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation regarding usual and customary reimbursement for out-of- network providers. We commend Chairman Rockefeller, Ranking Member Hutchison, and Members of the Committee for your leadership in recognizing the far-reaching implications of the recent settlements involving the Ingenix usual, customary, and reasonable (UCR) databases owned by United Health Group (United). These databases were used for over a decade as the basis for determining the UCR fees that United and many other third-party payers paid for medical services provided out of network, that is, by physicians who had not contracted with the patient's health insurer to accept a discounted rate. These databases employed flawed data to determine out-of-network payment rates, resulting in increased health insurer profits at the expense of patients and physicians. As a result of two precedent-setting settlements entered into by United, one with the AMA and the other with Attorney General Cuomo, this practice is finally being eradicated. The elimination of these UCR databases represents a major step toward improving the health insurance system in the United States. Most of the medical care provided pursuant to health insurance today is provided by physicians and other clinicians who have agreed to provide care to the patients covered by that health insurance product for a discount. Physicians generally try to contract with health insurers because they may receive significant benefits in return--(1) a promise of prompt payment, (2) increased patient volume by virtue of inclusion in provider directories and benefit plans that give patients a substantial financial incentive to go to in-network providers, and (3) maintenance of patient loyalty by meeting their patients' requests that they be ``in-network.'' These benefits can justify a significant discount from a physician's retail charges. However, at least 70 percent of people in the United States who have health insurance, have a product that covers out-of-network care for an additional premium.\\1\\ Patients understand that not all physicians are contracted, either because the payer has restricted the network, or because the physician did not agree to the contract terms-- the fee schedule offered was too low, the administrative or other burdens imposed were too high, or the health insurer was promising little or nothing with respect to benefits. Out-of-network coverage varies, but typical health insurance policies call for the insurer to pay a percentage of the UCR charge of the out-of-network provider, for example 50 percent. While health insurers have in recent years used various iterations of this language, the traditional definition of UCR charge is as follows: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ 2008 Kaiser/HRET Employer Health Benefits Survey. Usual: A charge is considered ``usual'' if it is a --------------------------------------------------------------------------- physician's usual charge for a procedure. Customary: A charge is considered ``customary'' if it is within a range of fees that most physicians in the area charge for a given procedure (often measured at a specific percentile of all charges submitted for a given procedure in that community). Reasonable: A charge is considered ``reasonable'' if it is usual and customary, or if it is justified because of special circumstances. Most patients expect their physicians to bill at a rate which is typical for their specialty and community for the services provided. Thus, assuming they have health insurance which includes an out-of- network benefit of 50 percent of UCR, patients expect that if they receive a bill of $100 for a service provided by a non-contracted physician, the health insurer will pay $50 of the bill, and they will be responsible for the remainder--in this case $50. But if the insurer systematically ``allows'' less than the UCR charge, the patient is left with a larger bill. For example, if the payer ``allows'' only $80 for the $100 service, the health insurer pays $40 (50 percent of $80) and the patient is now left with a $60 obligation ($100-$40=$60). Obviously, the size of the underpayment will vary based on the size of the claim and the way in which the insurer calculated the UCR payment, which may magnify the underpayment dramatically. For example, an insurer that bases its payment on the 50th percentile of the Ingenix database, will pay substantially less than an insurer that bases its payment on the 80th or 90th percentile. As demonstrated in several of Attorney General Cuomo's settlements, insurers that use older versions of the Ingenix database will pay less than those who are using the current database. These problems may be further compounded depending on how the benefit package is structured, particularly the deductible and coinsurance responsibilities. To the extent these are structured in a way that the patient is only ``credited'' with expenditures based on the understated ``allowable'' amount, rather than on the amount the patient has truly been responsible to pay out-of-pocket, the patient is harmed twice. Financial harm to the patient is not the only damage caused by this scheme. First, the patient-physician relationship may be unfairly undermined, and physicians may be unfairly defamed if patients wrongly believe they have been over-charged. As Attorney General Cuomo found in his report, ``The Consumer Reimbursement System is Code Blue,'' states: The responsible consumer reads the plan documents and sees a thicket of words. One term seems intelligible: the ``usual and customary rate'' of a similar physician for a similar service in a similar area. That sounds reasonable. The consumer makes the leap out of network and submits the bill to the insurer, only to be told the consumer will not be fully reimbursed because the doctor's charge exceeded the usual and customary rate. The fog of ignorance continues, thanks to the insurer. The physician-patient relationship is undermined, as the physician has been branded a charlatan whose bills are inflated. Health Care Report, ``The Consumer Reimbursement System is Code Blue,'' State of New York, Office of the Attorney General, January 13, 2009, which can be found at, http://www.oag.state.ny.us/bureaus/health_care/HIT2/ reimbursement _rates.html. Through the Litigation Center of the AMA and the State Medical Societies, the abusive practice is being eliminated. In 2000, the AMA was joined by the Medical Society of the State of New York, the Missouri State Medical Association and several other parties in initiating a class-action lawsuit against United Health Group for using skewed data to determine out-of-network payment rates. The AMA's lawsuit alleged that the Ingenix data was artificially reduced in the following ways: Inadequate data--The Ingenix database lacks information which is relevant to a physician's retail charges, such as the physician's training and qualifications, the type of facility where the service was provided, and the patient's condition. Corrupted data--Ingenix manipulates the database in numerous ways to reduce the charges, including but not necessarily limited to all of the following: By deleting valid high charges and by deleting proportionately more high charges than low charges. By deleting charges that have modifiers to indicate procedures or services with complications. By failing to collect information affecting the value of the service, such as whether the service was performed by someone other than a physician. By pooling data from dissimilar providers (such as nurses, physician assistants, and physicians) for use in the database. By maintaining outdated information. By commingling negotiated or discounted rates with retail charges. By accepting data from contributors who had already deleted higher charges from the data they submitted. By using defective data in the database and a deficient methodology to derive charges which are artificially low. For example, if Ingenix does not have a UCR rate for a particular geographic area, it will attempt to infer or derive the rate from other geographic areas. These derived charges, however, are faulty. Conflict of interest--Last, but certainly not least, the entire enterprise was permeated with conflicts of interest. All of the insurers that contributed data to the Ingenix UCR databases had a financial motive to manipulate it in ways that reduced the UCR charges. A detailed description of one court's findings concerning the Ingenix databases and their shortcomings is available in Judge Hochberg's thoughtful decision approving a recent class action settlement on behalf of HealthNet patients of approximately $250 million in McCoy v. HealthNet. See generally, 569 F. Supp. 2d 448 (D.N.J. 2008). After nearly a decade of litigation, the AMA is very pleased that United Health Group recognized the importance of restoring its relationship with patients and physicians and is settling the AMA's lawsuit by agreeing to pay $350 million toward reimbursing the patients and physicians it short-changed, and by confirming in Federal court its separate agreement with New York Attorney General Cuomo to end the use of this database and trust its repair and operation to a not-for-profit institution. Indeed, evidence gathered during the course of this litigation was brought to the attention of New York Attorney General Cuomo. The AMA urged Attorney General Cuomo to investigate the abuses, and we are gratified that his office devoted such substantial resources to that effort. Attorney General Cuomo's report documenting that investigation, ``Health Care Report--The Consumer Reimbursement System is Code Blue,'' does an excellent job of describing how the lack of transparency which characterizes the current health insurance payment system for out of network services works to disadvantage patients and their physicians, while benefiting the health insurance companies. The further specificity contained in Attorney General Cuomo's Agreements of Discontinuance with individual health insurers, which document knowing practices by certain insurers to exacerbate the problems with the Ingenix databases by using out-dated versions of those databases is especially troubling, as is the finding in his report that one national payer has been paying the same rates for in-network and out-of-network care, despite charging higher premiums for the out-of-network benefit. The AMA commends Attorney General Cuomo for successfully negotiating the transition of the UCR database from Ingenix to an independent, not-for-profit, and for his further success in gaining the commitment of virtually all of the health insurers that do business in New York to support that transition financially and with data going forward for the next 5 years. Eliminating the long-standing underpayment of patients based on the faulty Ingenix database, these settlements will ensure that patients receive the benefit of the higher premiums they have paid to have out- of-network coverage. There will finally be an accurate, legitimate data warehouse compiling all physician billed charges for out-of-network services. The information from the newly created database will be available not only to payers but also to the public, including patients who are shopping for health insurance and those who are seeking medical services. This welcome transparency should go a long way toward resolving the issues with out-of-network coverage uncovered by the AMA lawsuit and confirmed by Attorney General Cuomo's investigative report and settlements. We urge the Congress to ensure that everyone who was injured by this scheme, including Federal workers who may have been shortchanged on out-of-network benefits, are provided with reasonable compensation. We also urge the Congress to pursue health insurance payment transparency. The entire health insurance payment system is marked by complexity and confusion. This is graphically illustrated by the AMA's National Health Insurer Report Card, which provides objective measures of the claims processing activities of the major health insurers. See attached. The AMA believes enormous savings would accrue to patients, physicians, health insurers, and other third-party payers if there were complete transparency. Enhancement of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) standard transactions by the adoption of additional standards governing payment policies and additional enforcement of the existing standards, would also lead to dramatic efficiencies throughout the system. The AMA appreciates the opportunity to provide our views to the Committee on these critical matters affecting the nations patients and physicians and we look forward to working with the Committee and Congress to ensure accurate and transparent health insurance payments. 2008 National Health Insurer Report Card The purpose of the AMA's National Health Insurer Report Card (NHIRC) is to provide physicians and the general public a reliable and defensible source of critical metrics concerning the timeliness, transparency and accuracy of claims processing by the health insurance companies that are responsible for paying these claims. Billions of dollars in administrative waste would be eliminated each year if third- party payers sent a timely, accurate and specific response to each physician claim. The NHIRC is for informational purposes only. Physicians and payers are encouraged to review the NHIRC results and begin healing the health care claims process by supporting the AMA's ``Heal the Claims Process'' campaign and committing to the goal of reducing the cost of claims administration to 1 percent of collections.

STATEMENT OF CHUCK BELL, PROGRAMS DIRECTOR, CONSUMERS UNION Mr. Bell. Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, thanks very much for the opportunity to testify on consumer reimbursement for health care services. Consumers Union is the nonprofit, independent publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, with a circulation of 8 million readers, both print and online. And we regularly poll our readership and the public about key consumer issues, and the high cost of health care consistently ranks among their top concerns. I work for Consumers Union's advocacy and public policy division in the New York office, where I've represented Consumers Union's positions on health care issues for the last 19 years in the Northeastern States on issues relating to health insurance, prescription drugs, patient safety, and restructuring of nonprofit health plans in hospitals. I think, as all of us are painfully aware, health insurance costs for employers are going up at a very steep rate. But, in addition to that, they're going up a lot for consumers, too, and consumers are having to dig a lot deeper to pay for health care. The average employee contribution for company-provided health insurance has increased more than 120 percent since 2000, and for consumers and employer-provided plans, average out-of-pocket costs for deductibles, co-payments for drugs, and coinsurance for physician and hospital visits have also risen 115 percent since 2000. So, this is the context. And in the midst of this escalating crisis of out-of-pocket costs, consumers have been struggling with a gravely flawed out-of- network reimbursement system, which has been described here today. And the scale of the issue is huge. Over 110 million Americans, roughly one in three consumers, are covered by health insurance plans which provide an out-of-network option, and that's--includes about 70 percent of people who have employer-sponsored coverage. So, as a national organization that represents consumers, we emphatically agree with Attorney General Cuomo's conclusion that the structure of the out-of-network reimbursement system is broken. We believe that it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up so that consumers will be assured of being reimbursed fairly, and that there will be appropriate public oversight and accountability for collection of data regarding physician and provider charges. This investigation, as you've heard, has exposed a swamp of financial shenanigans, and has now reached a critical juncture. We believe that we need coordinated action by State and Federal policymakers and regulators to help consolidate the investigation's gains and ensure that the new database for calculating out-of-network charges will be broadly used across the entire marketplace. Some of the implications of the investigation that we think are important are the following: First, we think that regulators need to hold insurance companies accountable to their contractual promises on an ongoing basis. Consumers clearly have the right to expect that their health insurance policies will pay the bills that they are legally obligated to pay. Everyone can easily agree that insurance companies should not engage in deceptive and unfair practices against consumers, but there's nothing automatic about that process. It takes sustained effort and political will to achieve the vigorous comprehensive enforcement of State and Federal insurance and consumer-protection laws and regulation. And in this case, the technical nature of the subject matter and the obscure veiled nature of the Ingenix database resulted in a persistent ripoff that took far too many years to rein in. Attorney General Cuomo, to his great credit, plunged in and--as soon as he learned about the problem, and drove hard to get a consumer-friendly solution, but it--I think this case raises some troubling questions about why financial ripoffs like this one persist in the marketplace for so many years without effective intervention at the State or Federal level. Why didn't the alarms go off earlier about these unfair practices? So, we believe that oversight of the insurance industry can be tightened up at the State level by more intervention by attorneys general and insurance commissioners, and by establishing independent offices of insurance consumer advocates. Second, we think consumers do need a trusted system that they can rely on to ensure that the UCR rates will be calculated for out-of-network reimbursements, and that they'll be accurate and up to date. We believe the independent databases proposed by Attorney General Cuomo will have great benefits and give consumers a fix on what their reimbursements will be. We believe, also, that the insurance regulation that's being proposed in the State of New York to apply to all insurers in our State, and basically encourage them to use an independent source for this data, will be a very popular regulation, and it will be quickly adopted. But, it still begs the question--consumers need protection across the entire country on these issues, and we really hope that the regulation will be adopted as a model by the NAIC, or perhaps the Federal Government could set some minimum standards in this area. We also would note that Attorney General Cuomo's done a fabulous job in lining up some of the largest insurers in the country to support the settlements, but there are still many other insurance companies around the country, particularly State and regional companies, that use data from the Ingenix databases, who have--do not have operations in New York State, and have not been reached by this investigation. So, they have not necessarily halted their use of the Ingenix database or notified consumers of its shortcomings. And so, we would therefore urge the Senate Commerce Committee to investigate the nature and extent of the use of the Ingenix databases by other health insurance companies throughout the U.S. and to seek possible remedies or solutions for halting this practice. The New York investigation suggests that tens of millions of consumers have been directly hurt by industry practices that led to the underpayment of their health insurance bills. And at this point, nobody can say for sure exactly how much consumers were underpaid as a result of the broken out-of-network reimbursement system, but we believe that the financial damage sustained by consumers is clearly very substantial. We know it runs at least into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Finally, for the health care system to function effectively, we need strong ongoing financial accountability and oversight. We believe that this important reform of the out-of-network system prefigures much larger changes that we need to make as a country to ensure transparency and accountability in the health care system. Consumers need more and better information about the costs of medical procedures and treatments, and their therapeutic benefits, to ensure that we're getting good value for the precious dollars that we spend. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, thank you very much for your efforts to assure appropriate Federal oversight of consumer reimbursement issues. We look very much--to working with you to shape solutions on this area, and to help transform the health care system in the United States. Thanks very much for considering our views. [The prepared statement of Mr. Bell follows:] Prepared Statement of Charles Bell, Programs Director, Consumers Union Introduction Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee: Thank you very much for the invitation to testify on the issue consumer reimbursement for health care services.

Consumers Face A Growing Financial Burden for Health Care--Especially for Out-of-Pocket Costs The financial burdens on consumers related to health care have been steadily increasing over the last 15 to 20 years. As the Committee is no doubt painfully aware, the cost of health insurance has increased dramatically in recent years. Consumers are both paying more in premiums, AND shouldering a higher burden for out-of-pocket expenses, including deductibles, co-payments and other expenses not covered by their health insurance. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the cumulative growth in health insurance premiums between 1999 and 2008 was 119 percent, compared with cumulative inflation of 29 percent and cumulative wage growth of 34 percent. The rapid growth in overall premium levels means that both employers and workers are paying much higher amounts than they did a few years ago. Policymakers and the media often focus on the economic challenges posed by high cost of rising health insurance premiums for employers-- and that is absolutely appropriate. But a lot of money comes directly out of the consumer's pocket as well. The average employee contribution to company-provided health insurance has increased more than 120 percent since 2000. Consumers are also paying significantly more for out-of-pocket health expenses. For consumers in employer-sponsored plans, average out-of-pocket costs for deductibles, co-payments for medications, and co-insurance for physician and hospital visits have risen 115 percent since 2000. Consumers who buy their own coverage also have high out-of- pocket expenses. As result of these trends, health expenses are taking up a rising share of family income. 30 percent of insured consumers spent 10 percent or more of their incomes annually on out-of-pocket costs and premiums in 2007, compared to 19 percent in 2001, according to a recent report from the Commonwealth Fund. The steady, accelerating shift of costs to individuals and families results both in financial stress and increasing financial barriers to needed care. In 2007, more than 40 percent of working age adults in the U.S. had difficulty paying medical bills or accumulated medical debt last year, compared with about 33 percent in 2005, according a study by the Commonwealth Fund. The Fund also reports that ``an increasing number of adults who are insured have such high out-of-pocket costs relative to their income that they are effectively `underinsured.' '' Consumers Confront Serious Problems in Obtaining Fair Out-Of-Network Reimbursement In the midst of this escalating crisis of out-of-pocket costs, consumers have also been forced to contend with a gravely-flawed out- of-network reimbursement system. According to a recent investigation by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, and recent settlements with some the Nation's largest insurance carriers, it now appears that consumers may have been underpaid for their out-of-network reimbursements by hundreds of millions of dollars. The databases used to calculate out-of-network reimbursements are riddled with serious data quality problems and massive financial conflicts of interest. Over the last several years, Consumers Union has become increasingly concerned about consumer problems in obtaining fair, appropriate and timely reimbursement for out-of-network health services. These problems came to our attention as a result of consumer complaints, concerns expressed by physicians and employers, reports in the news media, and litigation. In particular, in New York state, we were aware that the American Medical Association, the Medical Society of the State of New York, other state medical societies, New York State United Teachers, Civil Service Employees Association (CSEA), other public employee unions and other consumer plaintiffs had sued UnitedHealth Group in 2000, alleging that they were being systematically shortchanged regarding out-of- network payments. From a consumer point of view, the implications of the lawsuit were potentially very significant, because over 1 million public employees in New York state are covered by the Empire Plan, which is insured by UnitedHealth Group, one of the Nation's largest for-profit insurance companies. We were therefore very pleased when Attorney General Andrew Cuomo initiated a national investigation of problems relating to out-of- network charges in February, 2008. The methods used by insurance companies to calculate ``usual, customary and reasonable'' rates (also known as UCR rates) have long been obscure and mysterious to consumers. It was not easy for consumers to verify the basis of the alleged UCR rates, or to contest perceived underpayments. Companies are supposed to disclose the details of how they calculate these charges upon request. But in practice many consumers found it difficult to find out how the charges are calculated, and what they are based on. Over 110 million Americans--roughly one in three consumers--are covered by health insurance plans which provide an out-of-network option, such as Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) and Point of Service (POS) plans This includes approximately 70 percent of consumers who have employer-sponsored health coverage. Consumers and employers often pay higher premiums to participate in an out-of-network insurance plan, because it gives patients greater in flexibility in seeking care from doctors, specialists and providers who are not in a closed health plan network. In most out-of-network plans, the insurer agrees to pay a fixed percentage of the ``usual, customary and reasonable'' rate for the service (typically 80 percent of the rate), which is supposed to be a fair reflection of the market rate for that service in a geographic area. Because the health plan does not have a contract with the out-of-network doctor or provider, the consumer is financially responsible for paying the balance of the bill--whatever the insurance company doesn't pay. By law, the provider may pursue the consumer for the entire amount of the payment, regardless of how little or how much the insurer reimburses the consumer. Even if UCR charges were calculated accurately, consumers could still experience ``sticker shock'' when they get the medical bills for out-of-network care. Why? They may not understand that the insurance company didn't agree to pay 80 percent of the doctor's bill--they only agreed to pay 80 percent of ``usual and customary'' rate, which is an average of charges in a geographic area. For example, suppose a patient went to visit the doctor for a physical, and charged $200. 80 percent of $200 is $160. But if an impartial and accurate calculation of ``usual and customary rate'' shows that what other comparable doctors charge for physicals is an average of $160, the insurance company would only pay $128, or 80 percent of $160. The consumer would be responsible for paying the balance of $72. The key problem with the out-of-network reimbursement system is that the UCR rates were not calculated in a fair and impartial way. For the last 10 years or so, the primary databases that are used by insurers to determine ``usual, customary and reasonable'' rates have been owned by Ingenix, a wholly-owned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group. Ingenix operates a very large repository of commercial medical billing data, and prepares billing schedules that are used to calculate the market price of provider health services. In 1998, Ingenix purchased the Prevailing Healthcare Charges System (PHCS), a database that was first developed by the Health Insurance Association of America, an insurance industry trade association. beginning in 1974. Also in 1997, Ingenix purchased Medical Data Research and a customized Fee Analyzer from Medicode, a Utah-based health care company. Thanks to Attorney General Cuomo's investigation, however, we now know that there were serious problems with the Ingenix database that appear to have consistently led to patients paying more, and insurers paying less. In January, 2009, Attorney General Cuomo announced key findings from his office's investigation regarding the out-of-network reimbursement system: According to an independent analysis of over 1 million billing records in New York state carried out by the Attorney General, the Ingenix databases understate the market rate for physician visits by rates ranging from 10 to 28 percent across New York state. Consumers got much less than the promised UCR rate, so that instead of getting reimbursed for 80 percent of the UCR charge, they effectively got 70 percent, 60 percent or less. Given the very large number of consumers in out-of- network plans--110 million--this translates into hundreds of millions of dollars in losses over the last 10 years for consumers around the country. Ingenix has a serious financial conflict of interest in owning and operating the Ingenix databases in connection with determining reimbursement rates. Ingenix is not an independent database--it is wholly-owned by UnitedHealth Group, Inc. It receives billing data from many insurers and in turn furnishes data back to them, including to its own parent company, UnitedHealth. UnitedHealth had a financial incentive to understate the UCR rates it provided to its own affiliates, and other health insurers also had an incentive to manipulate the data they submit to Ingenix so as to depress reimbursement rates. In general, there is no easy way for consumers to find out what the UCR rates are before visiting a medical provider. The Attorney General characterized Ingenix as a ``black box'' for consumers, who could not easily find out what level of reimbursement they would receive when selecting a provider. When they received a bill for out-of-network services, consumers weren't sure if the insurance company was underpaying them, or whether the physician was overcharging them. As an example of the lack of transparency, when UnitedHealth members complained their medical costs were unfairly high, the United hid its connection to Ingenix by claiming the UCR rate was the product of ``independent research.'' The Ingenix database had a range of serious data problems, including faulty data collection, outdated information, improper pooling of dissimilar charges, and failure to conduct regular audits of the billing data submitted by insurers. As a result of Attorney General Cuomo's investigation, on January 13, UnitedHealth agreed to close the 2 databases operated by Ingenix, and pay $50 million to a qualified nonprofit organization that will establish a new, independent database to help determine fair out-of- network reimbursement rates for consumers throughout the U.S. As a central result of his investigation, Attorney General Cuomo wisely concluded that: ``. . . the structure of the out-of-network reimbursement system is broken. The system that is meant to reimburse consumers fairly as a reflection of the market is instead wholly owned and operated by the [insurance] industry. The determination of out-of-network rates is an industry-wide problem and accordingly needs an industry-wide solution. Consumers require an independent database to reflect true market-rate information, rather than a database owned and operated by an insurance company. A viable alternative that provides rates fairly reflecting the market based on reliable data should be set up to solve this problem . . . Consumers should be able to find out the rate of reimbursement before they decide to go out of network, and they should be able to find out the purchase price before they shop for insurance policies or for out-of-network care.'' While UnitedHealth did not acknowledge any wrongdoing in the settlement, its agreement with the New York Attorney General ended the role of Ingenix in calculating UCR charges, and created a new national framework for a fair solution. In fact, in a press release announcing the settlement, Thomas L. Strickland, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer of UnitedHealth Group, expressed strong support for a nonprofit database to maintain a national repository of medical billing information: ``We are committed to increasing the amount of useful information available in the health care marketplace so that people can make informed decisions, and this agreement is consistent with that approach and philosophy. We are pleased that a not-for-profit entity will play this important role for the marketplace.'' Shortly after settling with the Attorney General's office, UnitedHealth also settled the lawsuit brought by the AMA and Medical Society of the State of New York, other physician groups, unions and consumer plaintiffs for $350 million, the largest insurance cash settlement in U.S. history. As sought by MMSNY and the other physician groups, United also agreed to reform the way that out-of-network charges were calculated. Since January, nine other insurers with operations in New York state, including huge national insurers such as Wellpoint, Aetna and Cigna, have also agreed to stop using data furnished by Ingenix, and to contribute funds in support of the new nonprofit database. The leaders of other insurance companies have also expressed support for a new nonprofit database to increase transparency and reduce conflicts of interest, and pledged to use the database when it becomes available. Two insurance companies agreed to also reprocess claims from consumers who believe they were underpaid for their out-of-network charges. All told, the Attorney General has now collected over $94 million to support the new independent database, which will be based at a university in NewYork state. Implications of the New York State Investigation From a consumer point of view, Attorney General Cuomo's intervention has been extremely helpful for consumers in New York state and across the U.S. This investigation squarely exposed the problems resulting in underpayment of consumers and physicians, and created a sweeping new framework for a national solution. The plan set out in the agreements reached by Attorney General Cuomo will help bring comprehensive, sweeping reform to the out-of-network reimbursement system. The investigation has exposed a swamp of financial shenanigans, and now reached a critical juncture. Consumers Union is calling for coordinated action by state and Federal policymakers and regulators to help to consolidate the investigation's gains, and ensure that the new database for calculating out-of-network charges will be broadly used across the entire marketplace. First, regulators need to hold insurance companies accountable to their contractual promises, on an ongoing basis. Consumers clearly have the right to expect that their health insurance policies will pay the bills that they are legally obligated to pay. We rely on the promises our insurance companies make in their contracts, and we expect the provisions of those contracts to be enforced by regulators and the courts. If your policy says it will pay you 80 percent of the ``usual and customary'' charge for a medical service, it should pay that amount. To enforce this principle in New York state, Attorney General Cuomo used his authority under New York's General Business Law 349 and 350, which prohibits deceptive acts and practices against consumers, to bring the insurance industry into compliance in New York state, as well as sections of the insurance law and the common law. Other states have similar laws, and they should be appropriately used when needed to prevent egregious consumer ripoffs. Everyone can easily agree that insurance companies should not engage in deceptive or unfair practices against consumers. But the reality is that it takes sustained effort and political will to achieve the vigorous, comprehensive enforcement of state and Federal insurance and consumer protection laws and regulations. In this case, the technical nature of the subject matter, and the obscure, veiled nature of the Ingenix database, resulted in a persisting ripoff that unfortunately took far too many years to rein in. To his great credit, Attorney General Cuomo stepped in quickly upon learning about the problem, and drove hard to achieve a consumer- friendly solution. At the same time, this case raises some troubling questions about why financial ripoffs persist in the marketplace for many years without effective intervention at the state or Federal level. Why didn't the alarms go off earlier about unfair practices that created very large financial losses for consumers? In the future, we hope that Attorneys General and Insurance Commissioners--as well as Members of Congress--will step up and act quickly to prevent financial abuses of health insurance consumers, and coordinate their work where lines of jurisdiction are unclear. In New York, the state Attorney General's health bureau served as a early warning system to monitor consumer problems, and intervene when things were going wrong. Attorneys General around the country maintain similar units, and some even have the power to intervene before government when insurance rates are established. A few other states have established an ``Office of Public Insurance Counsel'' or independent consumer advocate to fulfill a similar function. But in many states, consumers with insurance problems have little recourse, and consumer problems in getting fair reimbursement are not routinely investigated or publicized. Consumers Union and other consumer groups support expansion of Attorney General health care oversight, and the establishment of independent consumer advocates in every state. Second, consumers need a trusted system they can rely on to ensure that the UCR rates calculated for out-of-network reimbursements are accurate and up-to-date. By establishing a new nonprofit organization to maintain the database on ``usual and customary charges,'' the New York Attorney General's agreements help assure those charges will be calculated and maintained in a fair, up-to-date and transparent way, free from financial conflicts of interest. Consumers will be able to obtain up-to-date information on usual and customary charges through a national, free website, and have a good fix on what their potential reimbursements will be when they visit physicians and other health care providers. In New York, the Attorney General is developing a state insurance regulation which will require health insurers who utilize UCR databases to ensure that they are fair, accurate, free from conflicts of interest and transparent to consumers. We expect that such a regulation will be very popular and will quickly be adopted in New York state. However, because this is a national problem, there is still a huge need for a national or 50-state solution, to ensure that the out-of- network reimbursement system is fixed for ALL U.S. consumers. A regulation based on the New York model could potentially be adopted as a model by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or otherwise codified into law at the state and Federal level. It could also be enacted as part of overall Federal health reform legislation. Third, by arranging for some of the largest health insurers in the country to support the new database, Attorney General Cuomo has paved the way for a comprehensive national resolution of these issues. We would note, however, that there are many other health insurance companies who used data from the Ingenix databases, including state- based and regional health plans in the South, Midwest and Western states, who do not have operations in New York state. These companies were not reached by the investigation or the agreements, so they have not necessarily halted their use of the Ingenix database, or notified consumers of its shortcomings. We therefore would encourage the Senate Commerce Committee to investigate the nature and extent of the use of the Ingenix databases by other health insurance companies throughout the U.S., and possible remedies or solutions for halting this practice and securing restitution for consumers. Fourth, as mentioned above, the New York investigation suggests that tens of millions of consumers have been directly hurt by industry practices that led to underpayment of their health insurance bills. At this point, no one can say for sure how much consumers were underpaid as a result of the broken out-of-network reimbursement system. But the financial damage sustained by consumers is clearly substantial. There are few things that are more frustrating in life than getting shortchanged on your medical expenses by your health insurance company. We expect consumers across the country will be very concerned about the issues in this case, and where they have been shortchanged, would want to be fairly compensated by their insurer. Fifth, consumers know that for the health care system to function effectively, we need strong, ongoing financial accountability and oversight. We believe that the proposed reform of the out-of-network reimbursement prefigures much larger changes we need to ensure transparency and accountability in the health care system. Consumers need more and better information about the cost of medical procedures and treatments, and their therapeutic benefits, to ensure we're getting good value for the precious dollars we spend. As mentioned above, health care costs are skyrocketing. Consumers want very much to get better value for our dollars, to ensure that when we visit a physician or provider, that we will get safe, appropriate, quality health care, that is based on the best medical evidence that is available. In the case of the proposed new nonprofit database for out-of- network charges, Consumers Union is pleased to see that it will be specifically developed to be an independent database that is protected from financial conflicts of interest. The architecture of the health care system must specifically incorporate safeguards that protect against inappropriate bias or financial influence from insurance companies or others operating in the commercial marketplace. We also believe that this new non-commercial database can help to create much greater transparency regarding physician and provider fees, and be an important resource for medical researchers and others who are working to improve the quality, safety and affordability of care for consumers. Conclusion Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, the problem of ensuring effective state and Federal oversight of consumer reimbursement for health care services calls out for your prompt attention. We look forward to working with you to shape solutions that will assure that the United States rises to the challenge of transforming our health care system so that we are no longer at risk of facing financial hardship or financial barriers to care just when we need care the most. Thank you very much for considering our views. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Mr. Bell. I should have said at the beginning that all statements are automatically included in the record, so--you just sort of gave yours, but if you have something written, it goes in, Dr. Nielsen. So, that---- Dr. Nielsen. Yes. The Chairman. That's our practice. Dr. Nielsen. Yes. The Chairman. Ms. Lacewell, I'd like to start with you. In January, your office issued a report that discussed some of the findings from your investigation. In your report, on page 20, there is a table, which I believe people have, now, before them, do they not? And I would like to ask you about it.
