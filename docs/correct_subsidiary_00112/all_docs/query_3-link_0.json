        "text": "It depends on the state you live in.\n\nIf your stateÂ hasÂ expanded Medicaid: Check if your income qualifies.\n\nIf your state hasÂ notÂ expanded Medicaid: You may qualify based on your stateâs existing rules. Rules vary from state to state and may take into account income, household size, family status (like pregnancy or caring for young children), disability, age, and other factors. Because each state and each family situation is different, thereâs no way to find out if you qualify without filling out an application.\n\nGenerally yes, as long as youÂ qualify to use the Marketplace. Most people whose incomes are just above the level to qualify for Medicaid can pay very low premiums and out-of-pocket costs for private health insurance through the Marketplace.Â CheckÂ if youâll qualify for savings.\n\nA Marketplace health plan would cost more than Medicaid and usually wouldnât offer more coverage or benefits. If you qualify for Medicaid, you arenât eligible for savings on a Marketplace plan. Youâd have to pay full price for a plan.\n\nWhat if I have Medicaid now, but I have only limited benefits?\n\nSome limited types of Medicaid coverage pay only for:\n\nFamily planning\n\nTreatment of an emergency medical condition\n\nTuberculosis services\n\nNotice:\n\nIf you have limited Medicaid coverage, you can fill out an application through the Marketplace and find out if you qualify for full-benefitÂ coverage through either Medicaid or a Marketplace insurance plan with savings based on your income.\n\nAll states must offer former foster children uninterrupted Medicaid coverage until they turn 26, as long as at leastÂ oneÂ of the following is true:\n\nThey were in the foster care system and received Medicaid benefits on their 18th birthday\n\nThey aged out of the foster care system with Medicaid coverage after they were 18 or older\n\nFor former foster children who turned 18 on or after January 1, 2023, states must offer the same Medicaid coverage to individuals regardless of the state in which they aged out of foster care. Some states also cover former foster children who turned 18 before January 1, 2023, from other states. Check with your state Medicaid agency to learn more."
