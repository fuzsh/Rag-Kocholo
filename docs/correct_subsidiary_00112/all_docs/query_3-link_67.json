Don’t forget to check off France travel insurance from your to-do list!\n\nYes, getting travel insurance right before your trip to France can be morbid, because who wants to think of all the things that can go wrong? But you can never be too prepared – and if you’re applying for a Schengen visa, your France travel insurance is a must!\n\nIf you’re planning to join the 15 million expected visitors to France for the Olympic Games, a travel health insurance plan is no longer a suggestion but a must. Among the crowd of people and the summer heat, some accidents are bound to happen.\n\nWith travel insurance, you know you’re covered if anything happens during your visit, such as medical emergencies or trip-related issues. Do yourself a favor and get travel insurance so you can enjoy your visit with peace of mind.\n\nDo I Need Travel Insurance for France?\n\nAnyone who needs to apply for a Schengen visa to visit France must have travel insurance. Without it, your visa application will be rejected. You can get a free quote for a French Schengen visa insurance here.\n\nOn the other hand, if you do not need a Schengen visa to enter France, then travel insurance is not mandatory.\n\nHowever, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t get it. In fact, it is always highly advisable to get a travel insurance plan for trips abroad – regardless of visa requirements and no matter how much of a damper it puts on your excitement. Companies such as MondialCare, and EuropAssistance offer affordable health insurance plans for visitors to France.\n\nFrance Travel Insurance Requirements\n\nSeeing that France is part of the Schengen Area, any travel insurance you get for your trip to France should be Schengen compliant. As such, it must meet the following requirements:\n\nCover at least €30,000 for emergency medical costs and repatriation\n\nBe valid in the entire Schengen Area\n\nHow to Get Travel Insurance for France?\n\nYou can get travel insurance for France entirely online. Here are your options:\n\nTravel insurance brokers. They offer a multitude of plans from different travel insurance providers which you can compare side-by-side before purchasing, so you are not limited to only one insurance company. Get a free quote now.\n\nDirectly from a company. There are insurance companies everywhere. Many of them operate online but there are probably several in your country as well. You can simply visit their website or visit a local travel insurance office and get an insurance policy. In these cases, you are slightly more limited to one or two plans which the company offers.\n\nFrom your travel agency or airline. If you are going to France on an organized tour, then your travel agency may offer a plan along with the tour. Many airlines also offer travel insurance plans. Before settling in one, make sure you have the adequate coverage you need. You should also remember that travel insurance plans that tour agencies or airlines offer have hidden fees and are usually a tad over-priced.\n\nWhat Does France Travel Insurance Not Cover?\n\nThese are usually excluded from most travel insurance plans for France:\n\nMedical treatment because of a pre-existing condition.\n\nMedical treatment as a result of intoxication (alcohol, drugs).\n\nNon-emergency medical treatment.\n\nMedical treatment as a result of “high risk” or adventurous sports, such as parachuting, bungee jumping, motor racing, etc.\n\nHow to Choose the Best Travel Insurance Policy for France?\n\nTo choose the best insurance policy for your trip to France, ask yourself these questions:\n\nDoes it comply with Schengen visa insurance rules? This is especially important if you are applying for a visa.\n\nAm I satisfied with this coverage? Check whether it covers the minimum €30,000 and what medical treatment is covered under the policy.\n\nIs the company trustworthy? Check whether you are buying from a reputable company.\n\nHow Much Does France Travel Insurance Cost?\n\nTravel insurance for France is usually a very small fraction of the overall cost of the trip. Depending on which plan you choose (and your age), a travel insurance policy for a one-week trip to France can be from $10 to $50. Here are some of the factors that affect the cost of the policy:\n\nDuration of the trip. The longer your trip to France is, the more the policy will cost.\n\nThe older you are, the more you likely have to pay for travel insurance. Some companies even stop covering after a certain age, such as 80.\n\nAmount of coverage. A plan with maximum coverage of $50,000 will be less expensive than a policy with $100,000 coverage.\n\nThe deductible. This is the amount of money you pay yourself before the insurance company takes over. The higher the deductible, the lower the cost of the policy and vice-versa.\n\nCan I Use France Travel Insurance In Other Schengen Countries?\n\nYes, if you get a Schengen travel insurance plan for your trip to France, you can travel to other countries in the Schengen Zone and you will be covered there as well for any medical emergencies.\n\nCan I Use France Travel Insurance In Non-Schengen Countries?\n\nIf you get a Schengen travel insurance plan, you are usually only covered in the countries which make up the Schengen Zone. Some insurance policies may also cover EU countries not included in Schengen, such as Romania, Croatia, Cyprus, and Ireland.\n\nFor How Long Does Travel Insurance for France Cover Me?\n\nTravel insurance covers the entire duration of your trip to France, from the moment you depart until the moment you return home. When buying an insurance policy, you have to state the dates between which you will travel.\n\nCan I Get Annual Travel Insurance for France?\n\nYes, many companies offer annual, multi-trip travel insurance policies for the Schengen Zone. This type of travel insurance is beneficial if you frequently travel to France or elsewhere in the Schengen Area.\n\nIf you intend to actually live in France, then you need international health insurance, not travel insurance.\n\nInternational Health Insurance for France\n\nIf you are moving to France for work, studying, or joining your spouse, then you will need an international health insurance policy, also referred to as expat insurance. International insurance works in much the same way as a health insurance policy you may have in your country, but it is intended to protect you internationally.\n\nThe main difference between international and travel health insurance is that:\n\nAn international health insurance policy in France will cover you for non-emergency medical treatment as well, including regular checkups, pre-existing conditions and maternity.\n\nA travel insurance policy will only cover medical treatment which is a result of emergencies or accidents.\n\nIs Healthcare in France Expensive for Tourists?\n\nFor any small injuries or maladies you may experience while in France, such as a cold or food poisoning, you can just head to a local pharmacy or visit a doctor. In these minor instances, the doctor visit will not be expensive – the fee for a consultation is about $25 if you visit an “approved” doctor (one which has signed up and agrees to the established rates by the Social Security). Non-approved or non-contracted doctors have their own rates, which may be higher, but no higher than €70.\n\nSo, if the fees are not high, why should you bother with travel insurance for your trip to France when you do not even know that you will get sick?\n\nWell, because if you need major medical attention while in France, such as a serious surgery, the hospitalization fees can easily become too high to pay yourself. This is why it is advisable to have an adequate travel insurance plan.\n\nFrance Healthcare System\n\nThe French healthcare system is one of the best in the world. It is a universal healthcare system, funded by monthly contributions which are paid by workers via deductions in salary, by employers, and the self-employed.\n\nIn turn, when they need medical attention, 70% of the medical bill is reimbursed. In cases of long-term or severe illness such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes, or for persons with low income, the costs are covered 100%.\n\nIn addition to public health insurance, many French residents subscribe to private health insurance providers as well, which offer them coverage in private facilities.\n\nCan I Use My EHIC Instead of Travel Insurance in France?\n\nIf you are a citizen of an EU State, then you can use your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) to get medical treatment in French public hospitals. You will be held to the same regard as French nationals. This does not mean it entitles you to free healthcare – if a French citizen has to pay for a service, then so do you. On this note, an EHIC is not a complete substitute for travel insurance. With an EHIC, you will not be covered for evacuation or repatriation, nor for treatment in a private hospital.\n\nYou can only use an EHIC if you have a medical emergency or become suddenly ill in France, even from a pre-existing medical condition. You cannot use the Card if you went to France specifically to get medical treatment."
