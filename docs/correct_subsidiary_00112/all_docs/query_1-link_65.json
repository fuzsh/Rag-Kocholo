        "text": "Members are first enrolled in fee-for-service for a short time until they are enrolled in one of the health plans.\n\nMost Medicaid and FAMIS members get care through a health plan. Each health plan has a network (group) of primary care providers (PCPs), specialists, hospitals, and other health care providers.\n\nThese are the health plans Medicaid and FAMIS members can choose:\n\nAetna Better Health of Virginia\n\nAnthem HealthKeepers Plus\n\nMolina Healthcare\n\nSentara Community Plan\n\nUnitedHealthcare Community Plan\n\nSome people do not have to join a health plan. Read the list of [PDF] exclusions.\n\nChoosing a health plan\n\nMedicaid members\n\nMembers enrolled in Medicaid will get a letter asking them to choose a health plan. This “assignment letter” will list the health plan they will be enrolled in. Members have 90 days from the date on the letter to choose a different health plan.\n\nAll family members do not need to have the same health plan. To change your health plan, search for doctors, check your enrollment and more, go to the Medicaid Managed Care website.\n\nTo change your health plan online, select “Enroll” and then “Get Started.” If you want to change health plans by phone, call the Managed Care Helpline, Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. at 1-800-643-2273 (TDD 1-800-817-6608). Interpreter services are available. The Helpline can:\n\nAnswer questions about health plans\n\nFind out if your doctor is in the health plan you want\n\nHelp you choose the health plan that is right for you\n\nRead about Medicaid health plan choices and added benefits:\n\nHealth Plan Comparison Chart\n\n[PDF] English | Spanish\n\nFAMIS or FAMIS MOMS members\n\nFAMIS or FAMIS MOMS members can choose their health plan when they apply. If they did not choose a plan when they applied, they can join a plan by calling Cover Virginia at 833-5CALLVA. If they do not choose a plan, one will be chosen for them.\n\nRead about FAMIS health plan choices and added benefits:\n\nFAMIS MCO Choices and Covered Services\n\n[PDF] English | Spanish\n\nYour Medicaid and FAMIS ID cards\n\nOnce you or your child are enrolled in Medicaid or FAMIS, you will get a Commonwealth of Virginia health insurance card from the Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS). Each enrolled person in your household will get a card.\n\nIf you need a replacement Medicaid ID card, call Cover Virginia at 833-5CALLVA to order a new one. You can also contact your local Department of Social Services (DSS).\n\nMembers who are in a health plan will also get an ID card from the plan.\n\nYou must:\n\nMake sure the provider accepts Medicaid or FAMIS insurance and accepts your health plan, if you are in one\n\nShow your cards to the provider each time you get medical, dental, or other covered services\n\nIf you need a replacement health plan card, call the Managed Care Organization (MCO) Helpline at 1-800-643-2273. Or contact your health plan to ask for a new card.\n\n[PDF] Sample MCO ID Cards English\n\n[PDF] Sample MCO ID Cards Spanish\n\nFee-for-service\n\nWhen you are first enrolled in Medicaid or FAMIS, FAMIS MOMS, or Medicaid for children, you will get health care through fee-for-service. This means you can see any provider in the Medicaid or FAMIS fee-for-service network for covered services. Before you make an appointment or fill a prescription, ask the doctor, clinic, hospital, dentist, pharmacy, or mental health provider if they accept Medicaid or FAMIS fee-for-service. There are no co-pays for FAMIS members in fee-for-service.\n\nFor help finding a provider who accepts fee-for-service Medicaid or FAMIS, use the Department of Medical Assistance provider search.\n\nAfter a short time, most Medicaid and FAMIS members will join a health plan. Some will stay in fee-for-service. All Plan First members will stay in fee-for-service. Some services are through fee-for-service even for members who are in health plans.\n\nTo learn about dental coverage and other covered services provided to health plan members through fee-for-service, read your Medicaid or FAMIS program handbook.\n\nMedicaid Member Handbook"
