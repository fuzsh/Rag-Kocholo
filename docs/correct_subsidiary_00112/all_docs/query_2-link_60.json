Robert Andrews [Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding. Present: Representatives Andrews, Wu, Hare, Tierney, Kucinich, Fudge, Kildee, Loebsack, Clarke, Courtney, Kline, Guthrie, Hunter, and Roe. Also present: Representative Cassidy. Staff present: Aaron Albright, Press Secretary; Tylease Alli, Hearing Clerk; Jody Calemine, Labor Policy Deputy Director; Carlos Fenwick, Policy Advisor, Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions; David Hartzler, Systems Administrator; Jessica Kahanek, Press Assistant; Therese Leung, Labor Policy Advisor; Sharon Lewis, Senior Disability Policy Advisor; Joe Novotny, Chief Clerk; Megan O'Reilly, Labor Counsel; Meredith Regine, Junior Legislative Associate, Labor; James Schroll, Junior Legislative Associate, Labor; Robert Borden, General Counsel; Cameron Coursen, Assistant Communications Director; Ed Gilroy, Director of Workforce Policy; Rob Gregg, Senior Legislative Assistant; Alexa Marrero, Communications Director; Jim Paretti, Workforce Policy Counsel; Ken Serafin, Professional Staff Member; and Linda Stevens, Chief Clerk/Assistant to the General Counsel. Chairman Andrews [presiding]. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance this morning, and welcome to the Subcommittee. On March 5th, the President gathered people of all walks of life and all points of view at the White House and launched what I think is the most significant effort in many years to try to address the very severe problem of the health care system in our country. Let me start, from the outset, with a personal bias of mine. We have a health care financing and legal problem as opposed to a health care problem. We have a terrific health care system where doctors and nurses and therapists and researches and institutions do a great job. And we are blessed to live in a country with the talents of those men and women. Because of the legal and economic structure that supports that system, we have a problem where far too few--far too few people get access to that system, where a lot of providers feel they are being driven out of the system because their very good judgments are being second guessed by people who do not share their expertise, and where many of us feel that money is wasted in the system not to provide and promote good health and to deal with illness, but for other purposes. So I start from the premise that we want to preserve the very high quality and very great talents of so many people who have given so much of that system. But we want to extend its benefits to everyone. And we want to allocate its resources in a way that smart and fair and rational. It was a remarkable experience on March 5th at the White House. We had people from very different points of view who agreed that the goals this time should be held in common. And one of the goals that was, I think, universally shared was that we spend too much in the health care system relative to our national income. That we spend far more per capita than really anyone else in the developed world on health care, and do not get the results we should get from it. So first and foremost in the health care debate that this Subcommittee, this Congress and this country is going to have over the next couple of weeks and months is the question of how to allocate costs in a more relational and sensible way in that system. Closely related to that question obviously is how to cover everyone. The two questions are clearly integrated and one depends on the other in every respect. We are going to explore a number of different points of view this morning that deal with that question of cost and coverage in the health care system. We have assembled what I think is an outstanding panel of people with a broad array of experiences, rich diversity of opinions. And we want to encourage a dynamic interchange between the members of the Committee and them members of the panel. So the way that we are going to proceed this morning is, after the opening statements are done, we are going to hear from the witnesses. And I would just finish my opening statement by saying this. The core problem, as I see it, is that for Americans, American families, out-of-pocket health care costs have gone up at three times the rate that they are pay check has. So insured people have taken a pay cut because of the explosion in out-of- pocket health care costs. The number of uninsured people has metastasized as a result of this cost explosion. So I think the two issues go hand-in-glove. That until we have a more rational allocation of costs in our system and get costs under control, we will not get everyone covered. And until we get everyone covered, we will not have a rational cost allocation and get the costs under control. I think they are very much integrated questions and suggest integrated answers. At this time, I am going to ask my friend from Minnesota, the senior Republican on the Subcommittee, Mr. Kline, for his comments. Mr. Kline. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the witness. It does indeed look like we have another terrific panel here today. I agree with the chairman's opening comments that we have got a problem here on how to pay for health care, who is going to pay for it, who is going to be covered, how are we going to do it and how are we going to make it work efficiently and effectively. But we have wonderful health care, wonderful medical care in this country. I am from Minnesota. The Mayo Clinic in Rochester is a destination point in the world. World leaders fly in to the United States to get their medical treatment there. We need to be careful as we go forward that we do not destroy that wonderful health care, that wonderful medical care, the wonderful incentives that we have here and the opportunity that we have in this country to get medical care. Being from Minnesota, our neighbor, Canada--I happen to know that many Canadians chose to or are forced to come to Minnesota for their medical care. They simply cannot get an MRI. Or they cannot get the care that they need. So as we go forward, I would caution all of us to be careful to not destroy the good that we have here. One of my concerns here is that some 160 million Americans get their health insurance under ERISA from their employers. We may be changing the paradigm. That is part of the debate that we are having here. But we need to be very careful, it seems to me, not to do harm and not to pull a thread on the sweater that is ERISA and start unraveling it and end up with millions of Americans not getting the coverage that they need. So I am going to submit my statement for the record, without objection, if that is all right, Mr. Chairman? I am very eager to get to the testimony of our witnesses. And I yield back. [The statement of Mr. Kline follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. John Kline, Senior Republican Member, Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions Good morning, and welcome to our distinguished panel of witnesses. We look forward to hearing your perspectives and gaining the benefit of your expertise on issues of great national importance. This morning's hearing is the second hearing on health care reform this year, and will try to address a very broad range of issues confronting our nation's health care system. While I am hopeful that meaningful changes can be made to improve health care cost, access and delivery, I am concerned that some of the proposals being considered and talked about may have the exact opposite effect. We have learned from prior hearings that the employer-based health care system, though imperfect, has achieved a number of successes. Over 160 million Americans obtain insurance coverage from their employers, satisfaction levels are relatively high, and the number of people covered under this system has remained more or less constant through good and bad economic times. The main reason for this success is the federal ERISA law, which lets American businesses provide uniform, high quality benefits to all their employees across state lines, free from costly state benefit mandates. Employers, employees, and their families are, justifiably, very concerned about rising health care costs. I continue to believe that as we try to address weaknesses in the current system, we must be careful not to undermine ERISA by pulling one string at a time. As we discuss ways to reduce the cost of health insurance for employers, we must be mindful of the fact that ERISA is the basis of our voluntary employer-based system, and we must build on what works within that structure. Policies to permit greater pooling of resources to purchase insurance and the development of innovative, cost-efficient benefit designs would expand access by encouraging more employers to provide coverage and reduce costs. Some of the ideas to reform insurance systems being discussed could have the effect of driving people out of the voluntary, private employer-based health care system, make them more reliant on government programs and subsidies, and could ultimately lead to the nationalization of health care in America. I believe this could increase costs, stifle medical innovation, and reduce health care quality. Mr. Chairman, we must be mindful that proposals which undermine ERISA should not be adopted. These include employer mandates, which would require employers to provide coverage or pay a tax. Similarly, adding benefit mandates increases the costs of coverage, and makes it more difficult to provide health insurance. Also, creating a ``government plan'', modeled on Medicare or some other government structure, to ``compete'' with private coverage could result in unfair competition and eliminate a private health insurance market. Finally, Mr. Chairman, the cost of health reform and expanding access to health insurance coverage must be carefully considered before we vote to enact health care reform legislation. Merely passing legislation that expands access to benefits, without meaningful steps to control underlying health care costs, would not be wise, and will only lead to more unsustainable spending. That said, I remain hopeful we can continue to work together to reach consensus on legislation to provide more affordable and efficient ways of delivering health care benefits. With that, I'd like to welcome our seven distinguished witnesses today, and we should hear from them directly. I yield back my time. ______ Chairman Andrews. Thank you very much, Mr. Kline. Without objection, the opening statements of any member of the Subcommittee or Full Committee who wishes to submit a statement in the record will be accepted. Well, good morning, to the panel. We appreciate very much your written statements. They were terrific. And without objection, they will be entered into the record of the hearing so the members will have the benefit of them. The way we operate is we ask you to synopsize your written testimony in a 5-minute oral summary. That is difficult to do, but keep in mind the members have your written testimony. I am sure they have all read every word of the written testimony. Now, they certainly have it in front of them. And it is available to them. The 5-minute summary gives us ample time for exchange between the members of the Committee and the members of the panel, which is our objective. We find that we learn more that way, so we appreciate that. There is a system of lights that are in front of you. When the green light it on, it means your time to speak. When the yellow light goes on, it means you have 1 minute remaining in your 5 minutes. And when the red light goes on, it means we would ask you to quickly summarize your comments, that we can move on to the next person and keep things moving along. I want to introduce the witnesses, read a brief biography of each, and then we will turn to your statements. Mr. Ron Pollack has been working on this issue long before it became first-page news. He is the founding executive director of Families USA, a national organization for health care consumers whose mission is to achieve high-quality, affordable health coverage for everyone in the United States. In that capacity, Mr. Pollack helped prepare the Patient's Bill of Rights that has been enacted by many state legislatures. He received his J.D. from New York University where he was an Arthur Garfield Hayes Civil Liberties fellow. Mr. Pollack, thank you for your years of work on this issue. We are glad to have you with us today. Mr. Michael Langan is a principle at the Towers Perrin law practice and has over 30 years experience in health and insurance law, employee welfare benefits and related public policy issues. Before joining Towers Perrin, Mr. Langan was assistant counsel in the Corporate Law Department of the Prudential Insurance Company of America headquartered in Newark, New Jersey--very wisely on their part--and worked in his HMO subsidiary PRUCARE. He received his B.A. from King's College and a J.D. from the Seaton Hall University School of Law in South Orange, New Jersey. Nice to have you with us, Mr. Langan. Mr. William Vaughan is a senior health policy analyst for the Consumer's Union. Starting in 1965, he worked for various members of the House of Representative's Ways and Means Committee and retired in 2001 as a Health Subcommittee staff director for the minority. He graduated with a B.A. from the American University. And, Mr. Vaughan, we all understand that the real yeomen and yeowomen around here are the staff members. And I remember your work at Ways and Means and appreciate it. And we are happy you are with us here this morning. Ms. Janet Trautwein---- Did I pronounce your name correctly? Chairman Andrews. Is a returning witness to the committee, I believe. I think she has been here before. Is the executive vice president and CEO of the National Association of Health Underwriters in Arlington, Virginia. She also worked 4 years as legislative director and lobbyist for the Texas State Association of Health Underwriters. Ms. Trautwein received her B.A. in English literature from Elmhurst College. And one of your members--last Friday I was sitting in a coffee shop across from a theater. I have a young child who performs in theater. And your member came in and saw me there and talked for a half an hour about all your talking points. So I heard already what you had to say. [Laughter.] He was very persuasive. Mr. William Oemichen---- Did I pronounce your name correctly? Is the president and CEO of the Wisconsin Confederation of Cooperatives and the Minnesota Association of Cooperatives. He previously served as Wisconsin's top Consumer Protection and Trade Practices official from August of 1996 to September of 2001. And prior to that, as an accountant, malpractice, antitrust and cooperative attorney at a major Midwestern law firm. Mr. Vaughan also worked for two Minnesota members of Congress in Washington, D.C. And has a B.A. in economics from Carlton College and a J.D. from the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Welcome, we are happy to have you with us. Dr. David U. Himmelstein--did I pronounce your name correctly, Doctor? Is an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and practices primary care internal medicine. He currently serves as chief of the Social and Community Medicine Division at Cambridge Hospital. Dr. Himmelstein graduated from Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, completed a medical residency at Highland Hospital in Oakland, California, and a fellowship in general internal medicine at Harvard. It is an honor to have you with us this morning, Doctor, thank you. Glad you are here. And Ms. Karen Davenport is director of health policy at the Center for American Progress where she leads the Center's efforts, along with Mr. Podesta, to reinvigorate the national debate on health coverage for all Americans. She earned a B.A. in political science from Whitman College and an MPA from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. We are very honored, fortunate to have you all with us. And, Mr. Pollack, you are up. STATEMENT OF RON POLLACK, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, FAMILIES USA Mr. Pollack. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks for inviting me to this panel. Your staff asked that we focus on some improvements that can be made on employer-based health coverage. And predominately, that is what my testimony will focus on. I will be happy during the question and answer period to take up the challenge that you raised in the beginning about what are the different ingredients that can get us to universal coverage. We believe that employer-based coverage can work together with public program coverage to recreate a uniquely American hybrid private and public approach to achieving the goal of quality, affordable coverage for all. This hybrid approach would strengthen employer-based health coverage by improving regulation of the market, subsidize private coverage for many workers with moderate incomes and expand public safety net programs, like Medicaid, to fill in gaps for low-income people whose needs are often not met by the employer-based system. Employer-based coverage does provide critically important protections to consumers. It is guaranteed. That is people will not be denied coverage based on their health. Under current law, insurers are limited in their ability to exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions. And employees within a group cannot be charged higher premiums based on their age, health status or gender. Further, large employers are generally able to negotiate for good, comprehensive coverage for their employees. However, there is room to improve our employer-based system from a consumer perspective. First, under current law, insurers can exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions for up to 1 year for employees who previously had less than 12 months of continuous coverage. These exclusions cause employees to postpone or forego treatment for serious illness such as cancer. This law should be amended so that people have protections against pre-existing conditions when they first become employed and buy coverage. Therefore, we at Families USA support the Pre-Existing Condition Patient Protection Act of 2009, introduced by Congressman Courtney, which would amend the risks to entirely prohibit pre-existing conditions exclusions in employer-based plans. Second, under current law in 40 states, insurers can charge small employers high premiums if the employees, as a group, are in poorer health and/or because they have a higher proportion of women employees. This means that small businesses with higher numbers of people with health care needs or with higher numbers of women face unfair higher health insurance costs. Therefore, Families USA recommends that Congress improve employer-based coverage for all workers by banning health status and gender rating nationally. Insurers should charge all businesses buying the same plan the same price. Third, more must be done to address affordability. This requires that both low and moderate-income individuals receive premium subsidies that put their share of the cost of coverage within the family's financial reach. These subsidies should be larger for those with lower incomes or the least able to afford coverage. Further, these premium subsidies should be accompanied by appropriate out-of-pocket cost protections, deductibles, co-payments, limits on total coverage and uncovered benefits. One key way to protect consumers from unaffordable high out-of-pocket costs is to make sure they can buy a comprehensive benefits package that covers the full range of health care services that people need. I should note that a comprehensive benefits package must have reasonable annual and lifetime caps on the total dollar amount of health care services that will be covered. In 2007, 22 percent of workers had caps from $1 million to $2 million. And some workers had caps as outrageously low as $250,000, a cap that would preclude coverage from typical cancer treatments. Therefore, Families USA recommends passage of legislation, such as the Health Insurance Coverage Protection Act, H.R. 1085, co-sponsored by Congressman Kildee, that will increase the life time cap to $10 million in employer-based coverage for employers with 20 or more employees. I notice my time is up, so I will stop there. And happy to respond to questions. [The statement of Mr. Pollack follows:] Prepared Statement of Ron Pollack, Executive Director, Families USA Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee: Thank you for inviting Families USA to testify today at this very important hearing about health care reform. We are excited that Congress is moving forward with health care reform this year, and happy to help you think through the implications for employer-based health insurance. We have two core goals for health care reform: that everyone who currently has satisfactory health care coverage can keep that coverage, and that those who do not currently have health care coverage can get it. We believe that the most effective and efficient way to achieve both of those goals is to build upon the existing health care system. The employer-based health insurance sector is of great importance, covering well over half of all non-elderly insured Americans. In health reform, we must do the following: strengthen employer-based health coverage by improving regulation of the market, subsidize coverage for those workers with low and moderate incomes to enable them to obtain and keep health coverage, and expand the Medicaid program to fill in the gaps for low- income people whose needs are not met by the employer-based system. Strengthen Employer-Based Coverage Employer-based coverage provides important protections: It is guaranteed--that is, people will not be denied coverage based on their health; insurers are limited in their ability to exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions; and employees within a group cannot be charged higher premiums based on their age, health status, or gender. Further, large employers are generally able to negotiate for good, comprehensive coverage for their employees. These protections are not provided in the individual insurance market in many states, much to the detriment of consumers, and they are essential protections to build upon in health care reform. However, there are also weaknesses in the protections described above. Even limited pre-existing condition exclusions create inequities and contribute to the phenomenon of ``underinsurance.'' And although employees performing similar jobs in a company cannot be charged different health insurance premiums, the business as a whole may pay higher premiums based on its employees' health or other characteristics. The variability of insurance offered by employers means that some employees get good coverage at work while others get coverage that leaves them exposed to high out-of-pocket costs or provides limited benefits, or they get no coverage at all. And finally, in the current health care system, even if people have very minimal incomes, many are not eligible for public coverage or any help paying their premiums. I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about each of these problems and then talk more specifically about protections people with low incomes will need in a reformed market. Improvements Needed in Employer-Based Coverage Prohibit pre-existing condition exclusions Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), people have some protections against pre-existing condition exclusions when they receive coverage through their employers: They cannot be subject to a pre-existing condition exclusion if they have had 12 months of continuous coverage; Only conditions which have been treated or diagnosed by a medical professional in the last 6 months count as pre-existing conditions; and Insurers cannot decline to offer group coverage due to the health of an employee. (In Medicaid and CHIP, people are not subjected to pre-existing condition exclusions at all.) However, HIPAA does allow insurers to exclude coverage for a pre- existing condition for up to one year for employees who previously had less than 12 months of continuous coverage. (The exclusionary period is reduced by the amount of time that they had previous continuous coverage.) These exclusions cause employees to postpone or forgo treatment for serious illnesses such as cancer.\\1\\ Pre-existing condition limitations are intended to serve a policy goal of encouraging people to keep insurance, but this does not make much sense in the group market. Mostly, the people who go without coverage are those who do not have help paying premiums from their employer and who cannot afford to maintain coverage on their own. People who try to purchase coverage on their own in the individual market often face extremely high premiums, especially if they are older or in less than perfect health, and many are denied coverage altogether. And many adults, no matter how poor, do not qualify for Medicaid. In passing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA),\\2\\ Congress recognized the unfairness of counting a time that someone cannot afford coverage as a ``break'' that subjects people to pre- existing condition exclusions. Congress directed that any gaps in coverage between the time a person was laid off and when the new COBRA subsidy became available cannot be counted as a break in coverage and therefore the person cannot be subjected to new pre-existing condition exclusions. At the very least, this principle of not counting unavoidable gaps in coverage should be extended to a reformed market. Families USA recommends that ERISA be amended to entirely prohibit pre- existing condition exclusions in employer-based plans. The Pre-existing Condition Patient Protection Act of 2009 would do this. Prohibit premium variation based on health status and gender In 40 states and the District of Columbia, small group insurers can charge employers higher premiums if the employees as a group seem to be in poorer health than average. In most of those states, insurers can also raise premiums in future years based on a business's medical claims.\\3\\ This means that though employers are not supposed to discriminate in their hiring practices, they will pay more if they hire people who already have health conditions or who develop health problems. Similarly, gender rating in many states puts businesses with higher concentrations of female employees at a disadvantage. Some states have addressed these problems through laws requiring community rating or adjusted community rating: Insurers must charge all small employers equally, no matter the health status (and in some states, the gender) of their employees. This effectively spreads the risk of the highest cost enrollees equally among all employers buying a particular health insurance policy. Families USA recommends that Congress further improve employer-based coverage by banning health status and gender rating nationally. Spread costs and responsibility for health care equitably across employers States confront several problems when they try to reform the employer-based health care system to better spread risk and ensure coverage. First, if they try to redistribute the cost of high claims across the population through risk pools or reinsurance systems, they can only readily assess insurers that they regulate to pay those claims--they cannot easily assess large, self-insured employers. High- cost claims should be spread to larger employers as well, and across policies offering different benefit designs. Second, if states try to subsidize coverage for people who do not have access to employer- sponsored care, they can easily create disincentives for employers who do provide coverage, yet state attempts to hold employers responsible for health care payments quickly confront ERISA challenges. An employer-based system can only work if all employers either provide health benefits for their workers themselves or pay into a public system that provides care. Without this provision, employers and employees face great inequities: Through their premiums, those paying for coverage are also paying for the uncompensated care of workers in another business that did not provide coverage. Of course, employers could be exempted from a pay or play responsibility based on their size, revenues, and expenses if they did not have the funds to contribute. Massachusetts and Vermont currently require very small employer assessments to help pay for their health care systems. San Francisco requires a more significant contribution to the city's program for the uninsured by employers who do not elect to provide coverage themselves. San Francisco's system has withstood legal challenges thus far, but Congress could help to clarify a framework within which other states and localities can act. Families USA recommends that Congress develop large national pools, including both large and small employers, to share the risk of high- cost claims. Further, Families USA recommends that Congress either establish an equitable system for employer contributions to health care nationally, or clarify that ERISA allows states to assess employers for public health care and to give tax credits to those that already cover their own workers. Some small employers will need federal subsidies in order to provide coverage for their workers. Require adequate benefits Some employers and some subsidized coverage programs have sought to control costs by purchasing minimal coverage. This is penny wise and pound foolish. Unable to afford the care that is not covered, consumers delay seeking care until they are much sicker. When they do finally seek care, they pay what they can--and go into debt doing so. The share they cannot pay--the uncompensated care--is shifted to other payers; we all pay a portion of these costs in our health insurance premiums.\\4\\ Limit cost-sharing and the sale of high deductible plans When employers offer high-deductible health plans, the policies require families to spend an average of nearly $4,000 out of pocket before coverage begins. Half of working families with HSA-qualified high deductible plans are offered no other insurance options by their employers, and nearly half of employers offering these plans leave families on their own to pay the high deductibles out of pocket.\\5\\ An analysis of Census data showed that only one in 10 families with incomes up to about $52,800 annually (about 300 percent of poverty for a family of three in 2008) could afford to pay the average deductible with their savings,\\6\\ so if they have serious illnesses, these families will be left with medical debt. Employers should offer their employees a reasonably priced, low-deductible coverage option. When high-deductible plans are offered, there is a danger that healthier employees will gravitate to them and less-healthy employees will choose low-deductible plans; this ``adverse selection'' will drive up the premiums of low-deductible plans, which will encourage more people to opt for high-deductible plans, and so on. If health reform includes an exchange with a variety of cost-sharing options, the option with the lowest cost-sharing should not be priced higher due to the risks of those who select it. Instead, Families USA recommends development of a price structure for all product lines within an exchange that treats everyone in the exchange as being part of the same risk pool. The coverage option with the lowest cost-sharing should be priced as low as possible, and low-income people should receive meaningful subsidies to pay its premiums. Retain important benefit mandates and raise benefit caps Over the years, states have mandated that the plans they regulate provide certain benefits. Generally, these mandates were to fill holes that insurers typically left in coverage. For example, states have mandated that plans cover well-child care, colorectal screening, and diabetes supplies when some plans previously failed to cover these important services. Mandates do not now regulate the amount of hospital, doctor, and drug coverage the plans must provide. Some people have advocated for exemptions from benefit mandates as a way to save money. However, this leaves people without needed health care and creates hidden costs that still exist in the health care system. States that have analyzed the cost of various benefit mandates have found that most mandates enacted in their states raised premiums by less than 1 percent.\\7\\ Further, when looking at the total cost of state mandates, one state found that the net cost impact of all 26 of its mandates was only 3-4 percent.\\8\\ These findings suggest that the elimination of mandates from insurance plans would reap little in the way of premium reductions. Federal law currently sets few benefit mandates: It requires employer-based health plans to cover newborn care, certain care for women with cancer, and to provide mental health parity. If federal and state relationships change with respect to health insurance regulation, Congress or an independent body should look carefully at benefits mandates enacted by states to set a floor on coverage. Further, annual and lifetime caps create barriers to care. In 2007, 22 percent of workers had caps from $1 million to $2 million,\\9\\ and some workers had caps as outrageously low as $250,000 \\10\\ --a cap that would preclude coverage for typical cancer treatment. Few people ever hit their lifetime caps but for those who do, the consequences are disastrous.\\11\\ Caps mean, for example, that cancer patients stop getting treatment. Premature infants on ventilators and toddlers receiving heart transplants are among those who may exhaust a $1 million cap, and the infusions that allow hemophiliacs to live normal lives can easily eat through a $2 million cap. While these treatments are too expensive for any one person to afford, since so few people need them, the cost is miniscule when spread across a population. Families USA recommends passage of legislation such as the Health Insurance Coverage Protection Act (S. 442/H.R. 1085) to increase the lifetime caps to $10 million in employer-based coverage for employers with 20 or more employees. Provide for oversight of the health insurance market Some states have done a better job than others of overseeing health insurance company behavior by requiring prior approval of health insurance rates and by setting standards about how much health insurers must spend on medical expenses (as opposed to administration and profit). In addition, they have looked at factors such as excessive compensation and whether a nonprofit insurer was investing in services that benefit the larger community when determining whether the insurer met its obligations in the marketplace. Standards such as minimum medical loss ratios and strong oversight are essential to controlling costs. New York, New Jersey, and Maine are examples of states that provided premium refunds to employers and individuals when plans failed to spend at least 75 percent of premium dollars on medical care. Colorado, Maryland, and Pennsylvania are examples of states where nonprofit insurers are now using surpluses that they had built over the years to make substantial contributions to community health needs. Families USA recommends setting federal and state responsibilities and standards for oversight of the health insurance marketplace. Provide Adequate Subsidies for Moderate-Income Individuals A regulated private health insurance market is an absolutely essential part of health care reform, but these reforms are not enough to help those with moderate incomes afford coverage. Moderate income individuals whose employers do not offer health coverage, or whose employer-based coverage is too expensive, need more than just a better- regulated insurance market; they also need subsidies that put private coverage within financial reach. These subsidies should be larger for those with the lowest incomes, who are the least able to afford coverage. Further, these subsidies should be accompanied by appropriate limits on out-of-pocket costs for low-income individuals. Research points out the serious barriers that unaffordable out-of-pocket costs erect between moderate income individuals and needed health care.\\12\\ If subsidies are insufficient for these individuals, they will continue to be left out of the nation's health care system. Subsidies must be built on a regulated market as described above: Premiums should not vary based on health or gender; coverage must be available regardless of pre-existing conditions; benefits must be adequate and cost-sharing limited; and the federal government, together with states, should oversee the system to be sure that public dollars actually go to health care and that companies do not make unreasonable profits. Expand and Improve Medicaid for Low-Income Individuals Moderate-income individuals will benefit greatly from subsidized coverage available in a reformed private insurance market. But for the lowest-income Americans, the most appropriate coverage vehicle is undoubtedly the Medicaid program. Health reform must also address expanding and improving Medicaid to ensure that all Americans can have affordable, quality health coverage. Medicaid is specifically designed to meet the unique needs of low-income people with complex health care needs, while the private insurance market is not. With respect to coverage for low-income Americans, Families USA recommends: (1) that a national Medicaid eligibility floor be established, and (2) that the enrollment process in Medicaid be streamlined to facilitate easier enrollment for all eligible individuals. Why Medicaid? Medicaid is already the backbone of the health care system for the most vulnerable Americans. It covers approximately 60 million low- income people: 29.4 million children, 15.2 million adults, 6.1 million seniors, and 8.3 million people with disabilities. What's more, it is specially designed to meet the unique needs of these populations, who tend to be sicker and have more intensive health care needs than the general population.\\13\\ As in any coverage expansion, special attention will need to be paid to ensuring that the Medicaid delivery system is retooled to handle an increase in the number of Medicaid enrollees without compromising access to care. However, Medicaid is the most efficient and effective way to cover more low-income Americans who cannot obtain coverage in the private market. Every state already has a Medicaid program with an existing provider network and administrative infrastructure. It makes sense to build on this foundation, particularly since it has a proven track record of effectively serving low-income individuals. A little-known fact is that Medicaid is actually more efficient at covering low-income people than private coverage. After controlling for health status (since Medicaid enrollees tend to have greater health care needs), it costs more than 20 percent less to cover low-income people in Medicaid than it does to cover them in private health insurance.\\14\\ In this cost-conscious climate, it only makes sense to expand coverage in the most cost-effective ways possible. The most cost-effective way to expand coverage for low-income uninsured people is Medicaid. Cost-sharing protections Medicaid includes very important protections against out-of-pocket costs to ensure that these costs do not prevent people from getting the health care services they need. Unlike private health insurance, Medicaid typically does not require premiums or enrollment fees, and there are limits to how high other forms of cost-sharing can be. Certain services (preventive care services for children, emergency services, pregnancy-related services, and family planning services) and certain populations (children of certain ages and incomes, foster children, hospice patients, institutionalized patients, and women in the Medicaid breast or cervical cancer programs) are exempt from any kind of cost-sharing, and copayments on individual services are limited to so-called ``nominal'' amounts of a few dollars or less. These protections are absolutely imperative to the success of the Medicaid program for low-income people. Low-income adults with private insurance pay more than six times as much on out-of-pocket costs as do low-income adults with Medicaid.\\15\\ Research abounds demonstrating the serious burden these out-of-pocket health care costs can pose for low- income people.\\16\\ When people cannot afford these costs, they often delay or forgo care, which can result in more costly complications later on.\\17\\ Because Medicaid incorporates such strong cost-sharing protections, people enrolled in Medicaid are more likely to get the care they need, when they need it. Comprehensive benefits Medicaid's comprehensive benefit package ensures that the program provides appropriate coverage to people with diverse health care needs. For example, Medicaid has specific protections that are designed to ensure that children get both preventive care and treatments for any health complications they may have (referred to as Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, or EPSDT, services). Medicaid also covers services that low-income people need that are not usually covered in private health insurance. For example, Medicaid covers transportation to doctors' appointments, services that help people with disabilities live independently, and services provided at rural and community health centers. It is unlikely that a private health insurance plan would ever cover these services. Medicaid is also a key source of coverage for people who are very sick or who have disabilities. While most private health plans have annual or lifetime maximums that people with intensive health care needs can quickly exceed, Medicaid has no such limits. It provides coverage to all those who need it, even people with serious health care problems, whom the private market is simply not interested in serving. Similarly, while private coverage often excludes coverage for pre- existing health conditions, people enrolled in Medicaid are guaranteed to receive the health care services they need, regardless of any past or current health care problems. The Medicaid benefits package is specifically designed to meet the health care needs of low-income individuals, and as a result, people enrolled in Medicaid are less likely than both the uninsured and those with private coverage to lack a usual source of health care or to have an unmet health care need.\\18\\ Medicaid appeal rights and protections Because low-income people cannot afford health care services that are not covered by their insurance, Medicaid's appeal rights are particularly important. These rights ensure that low-income people who are sick can appeal coverage denials without jeopardizing ongoing treatment. They can also appeal enrollment or eligibility decisions, and have the right to a fair hearing. Also, unlike the private health insurance market, there are no pre-existing condition exclusions in Medicaid, nor are there waiting periods before an otherwise eligible person can enroll. Medicaid is guaranteed to be available to all who are eligible; people cannot be turned away because they are sick or have experienced health problems in the past, and they can begin receiving services as soon as they are determined to be eligible. In addition to the cost-sharing protections and the comprehensive benefits package, these design features make Medicaid particularly well-suited to providing coverage to low-income people. Create a National Medicaid Eligibility Floor To be eligible for Medicaid under federal law, a person must not only have a low income; he or she must also belong to one of the following Medicaid eligibility categories: children, pregnant women, parents with dependent children, people with disabilities, and seniors. If a person does not fall into one of these categories, he or she can literally be penniless and still be ineligible for Medicaid. Also, because the Medicaid program is a state-federal partnership, states set their own eligibility levels. There are federal minimums, but eligibility levels vary widely from state to state. Only 16 states and the District of Columbia cover working parents at least up to the poverty level ($18,310 for a family of three), and the national median eligibility level for parents is a mere 67 percent of poverty ($12,268 for a family of three).\\19\\ The picture is even grimmer for low-income adults who do not have dependent children: in 43 states, these individuals are ineligible for Medicaid no matter how low their income. An estimated 45.1 percent of non-elderly Americans with income below the poverty level were uninsured in 2007.\\20\\ Health reform offers an opportunity to address these gaping holes in the health care safety net, and to ensure that, in addition to improving coverage for those with moderate incomes, the very lowest- income Americans are covered as well. Families USA recommends that Congress establish a national Medicaid income eligibility floor, below which any individual is guaranteed to be eligible for Medicaid, regardless of age, parental, or health status. More than one in three uninsured Americans has an income below the poverty level.\\21\\ Establishing a federal floor for Medicaid would significantly reduce the rate and number of uninsured Americans. Streamline Medicaid Enrollment In order to ensure that the new Medicaid expansion attracts the highest possible enrollment among those who are eligible, Families USA recommends that Congress establish a new, simplified enrollment process for both current and newly eligible people. Experience with the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) has shown the importance of establishing simple, streamlined enrollment policies and procedures to help eligible people get and keep coverage.\\22\\ Examples of these simplifications include allowing 12 months of continuous eligibility to individuals once they are enrolled in Medicaid, minimizing the amount of documentation people need to provide when they apply and renew their coverage, eliminating asset tests, allowing application by mail and online, and simplifying the application itself so that it is short and easy to understand. It will also be crucial that there be coordination in the application process for Medicaid and the subsidy for purchasing private health insurance coverage. Experience tells us that low-income people have fluctuating incomes, and those with incomes ``at the margins'' may not know in advance for which program they are eligible. It is imperative that the process for screening applications include provisions that facilitate enrollment, such as a ``screen and enroll'' requirement similar to that in CHIP, be included in any Medicaid expansion and any new program to subsidize private health coverage for low- to moderate-income individuals. Such a requirement would ensure that individuals who apply for the subsidy, but are actually eligible for Medicaid are enrolled in Medicaid and vice versa. The enrollment process should make sure that the right people get into the right program, and should not make people jump through unnecessary hoops to get there. Conclusion Strengthening the employer-based health coverage sector and expanding Medicaid are key components of health care reform. By addressing the problems described above, Congress will make great strides towards the goal of ensuring access to high quality, comprehensive, affordable health coverage for all Americans, while reducing the long-term costs of health care coverage. endnotes \\1\\ Karyn Schwartz, et al., Spending to Survive: Cancer Patients Confront Holes in the Health Insurance System (Washington: Kaiser Family Foundation and American Cancer Society, 2009). \\2\\ Cheryl Fish-Parcham and Claire McAndrew, Squeezed!

Thank you, Mr. Pollack. And as I say, you are written statement has been entered into the record in its entirety, which we appreciate. Mr. Langan, welcome to the Committee. STATEMENT OF MICHAEL LANGAN, PRINCIPAL, TOWERS PERRIN Mr. Langan. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Kline and members of the subcommittee, good morning. Thank you for the opportunity to join you today at this important hearing. My name is Michael Langan. I am a principle at Towers Perrin, an employer benefit consulting firm, where I lead a group of benefit attorneys who analyze legislative and regulatory developments that affect our clients' employee benefits and compensation programs. I am here today on behalf of the American Benefits Council, which is a trade association representing principally Fortune 500 companies who either sponsor or provide services to retirement and health plans that cover more than 100 million Americans. The American Benefit Council's recommendations on health reform are contained in its January 2009 Condition Critical Report. I would like to ask permission to submit the entire list of those recommendations for the hearing record. Chairman Andrews. Without objection, they will be entered into the record. Mr. Langan. Thank you. Description number one in our report calls for building on what works. We believe that the best health reform options are those that preserve and strengthen the voluntary role that employers currently play as the source of health coverage for more than 160 million Americans. Health reform that continues to engage employers as sponsors of employee health coverage will enable employers to apply their considerable health benefit expertise and innovation in a reformed system. According to a 2008 Kaiser Family Foundation survey, 99 percent of employers with 200 or more employees offered health benefits to their workers. Moreover, that percentage has never been lower than 98 percent at any time in the last 10 years. By comparison, the same survey shows that 62 percent of firms with fewer than 200 employees offered health coverage. We believe the strategies that focus on making health coverage more affordable for employers of all sizes is the best way to ensure both the continuation of the high-levels of participation by large employers and to increase the levels of participation by smaller employers. Indeed, one reason that we believe that a pay or play approach would be an inappropriate coverage solution is that it could easily lead to a net reduction in employer-sponsored coverage. Our concern is that this approach could drive some companies simply to pay rather than play. This would lower the level of employer engagement as an innovator and a demanding purchaser of health care services. We believe that an essential component for maintaining a strong employer-based system starts with protecting the comprehensive federal regulatory framework established by ERISA. Employers that operate across state borders consider ERISA's framework essential to their ability to offer and administer employee benefits consistently and efficiently. This regulatory approach also translates into better benefits and lower costs for employees. Our vision of health reform also calls for improvements both in private health insurance products, especially in the individual market, and in existing public programs. Both have important roles to play in a reformed and robust health care system. However, we also think that both of these sources of health coverage have worked best by serving distinctly different roles in populations. The Council's health reform recommendations also include numerous recommendations directed at improving the quality and affordability of health care services. For 20 years now, my firm has conducted an annual survey of large employers regarding their health care strategies and their plan costs. In the most recent Towers Perrin survey of health care costs, employers reported that the average per- employee costs for health coverage in 2009 is $9,660, almost $10,000 per employee. And this represents an average increase of 6 percent over last year. Employers also told us that the average cost of family health coverage will exceed $14,000 this year. While these numbers alone are sobering, the impact of relentless health care increases is most starkly evident when compared with average wage increases over the last eight to 10 years. This gap between wage increases and the annual increase in health costs results in what we call the affordability gap. Over time, this widening gap erodes total compensation and employee purchasing power. On page 5 of my statement, there is a chart that illustrates this gap. Clearly, we believe that urgent action is needed to make the health care system less costly and more efficient while achieving more consistent delivery of high-quality care. Our recommendations call for accelerating the development and implementation of consensus-based quality and performance measures, introducing these measures into our payment system starting with Medicare. We feel that we need to reward health care providers on the basis of proven performance rather than simply the volume of services they deliver. We also call for other measures to help bring health care costs under control, including building on the initial investments and health information technology, as well as independent research on therapies and procedures that consumers and providers can freely access. Mr. Chairman, I will conclude with the observation that the most important prescription for health reform may well be the willingness of all major stakeholder groups to work collaboratively to achieve our shared goal of a stronger, more sustainable health care system. The members of the American Benefits Council and those of us at Towers Perrin are committed to working towards those goals to achieve heath care reform that it both urgently needs and can only succeed if it is developed through an open, consensus-based approach. Thank you again for the opportunity to share our views, and I look forward to addressing any questions you may have.

STATEMENT OF WILLIAM VAUGHAN, SENIOR HEALTH POLICY ANALYST, CONSUMERS UNION Mr. Vaughan. Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, thank you for the invitation to testify on how to save money in health insurance. That is a little bit like being invited to shoot fish in a barrel. And we appreciate the opportunity. Consumers Union is the nonprofit, independent publisher of Consumer Reports. And we do not just test toasters. We try to help people with health issues. We are really using comparative effectiveness research to save folks millions and millions of dollars on the safest most effective brand and prescription drugs. We support reform of the health system. Our readership tells us it is a top priority. My testimony documents why. And we have stories from many of your congressional districts, particularly moving ones from Mr. Courtney's and Mr. Loebsack's districts, in the back of my statement. So how to save money. One thing to do would be to set up a federal office to work with the states, not take over, but work with the states in collecting and sharing information about consumer complaints and emerging fraud issues. State enforcement of insurance laws, antifraud issues, is very uneven, and we need to do better. And the basis of that recommendation comes out of a court case in the Newark area, sir, and a settlement by New York A.G. Cuomo this spring in the United case that is so seemingly obvious. And how did this go on for so long? You feel it is almost Homer Simpson like. The issue involved--and I will show you some math on this. This issue involved, is most of us, 70 percent of us, have a point of service, or PPO, kind of health policy where, if we need a specialist, we can go out---- Chairman Andrews. Maybe the young lady can stand so all the members can see the chart. Mr. Vaughan. Okay, sorry. If we go out of network for specialty care or if you want to go up Hopkins for a specialty operation, you can go. But you have to pay, of course. And let's say the doctor charged you $200. And the usual customary and reasonable fees in the area were $200. So in and 80-20 policy, you would owe $40. Well, another procedure, the doc charges $200. Usual customary and reasonable is $150; you, the insured, pay $120, you owe $80. You still owe the doctor the $200 he charged. UCR, where does that come from? Believe it or not, it is from subsidiaries owned by the insurance companies. And Cuomo and the court cases basically found that over a period of a decade, those numbers were getting low-balled. Thank you very much. Those numbers were getting low balled. And consumers were paying hundreds of millions of dollars over a decade more than should have. Senator Rockefeller says they were paying a billion bucks or more. That was such an obvious conflict of interest. Why did it take so long? If we had a federal office where--the first complaints were coming in around 2000 from AMA. We need somebody to help say, hey, guys, something is happening out there. Let's get together and protect consumers. As a consumer rep, I hate to say it, but most of us are pretty terrible shoppers for health insurance. Sorry, Neil. But, ``Honey, let's go shopping for health insurance this Saturday morning,'' would put and fear and dread in most of our hearts. [Laughter.] And we leave a lot of money on the table. We do not get a great deal. And the documentation for this is in--Part D and in C plans. We are not getting the best deal. In this reform bill, if you want to use consumers to drive towards value and to drive towards savings, we need some help big time. We need an office that will maybe grant the states for one-on-one counseling. We need a site that would compare quality and effectiveness and price of insurance plans. Very important, we need some standardization of definitions. Our current issue has a couple, thought they had hospitalization insurance. Fine print, it started on the second day, after the lab tests, after the surgery room charges. They ended with a huge bill. Darn it, hospitalization means hospitalization, drug coverage means drug coverage, means chemotherapy, means the antiemetic that lets you take the chemotherapy. We need some definitions like that so that people know what they are buying. But most, most, most important is there needs to be a market place or a forum where people can make meaningful choices among a manageable number of plans. In C, in Part D, in Part C--We are looking at 40, 60, 80 plans. Consumers just shut down. Most of these are meaningless, picky little differences. Give us some major choices in a format where we can shop. And before you sign up for that policy, you see the price and the quality ratings of the comparable plans in that category. Thank you very much, and I hope that this can become a great historic Congress which will finally solve a century-old effort to get dependable, affordable, quality health care to all Americans. [The statement of Mr. Vaughan follows:] Executive Summary: Statement of Consumers Union, April 23, 2009 A national health reform law is a huge opportunity to reduce the cost of health insurance for employers, employees and their families. Savings can be achieved by Establishing a permanent insurance anti-fraud watchdog unit to work with States to prevent and detect the kind of abuses seen in the HealthNet and UnitedHealth-Ingenix case, where consumers have lost hundreds of millions of dollars over the past decade because of insurers underpaying for out-of-network costs; Empowering consumers in the marketplace: Create an honest database where consumers can see beforehand what their out-of-network costs are likely to be, thus enabling some increased shopping; A new Office of Consumer Health Insurance Education and Information that will: Provide general and comparative information about insurance quality, prices, and policies using consumer-friendly formats Require standardization of insurance definitions and forms so consumers can easily compare policies on an ``apples-to-apples' basis Require insurers to clearly state (in standardized formats) what's covered and what's not in every policy offering, and to estimate out-of-pocket costs under typical treatment scenarios Maintain an insurance information and complaint hotline, and compile federal and state data on insurance complaints and report this data publicly on a Web site Manage a greatly expanded State Health Insurance Assistance Program that would provide technical and financial support to community-based non-profit organizations providing one-on-one insurance counseling to consumers An insurance ``exchange'' or ``connector,'' offering a choice of plans, that will: Include an optimal number of plan choices--not too few and not too many--and limit excessive variations in benefit design so that plans compete more on price and quality Ensure that before selecting a plan, the consumer sees the price and quality ratings of comparatble plans Require plans to provide year-long benefit, price, and provider network stability Protect against marketing abuses and punish insurers that mislead consumers Make consumers fully aware of their rights to register complaints about health plan service, coverage denials, and balance- billing and co-pay problems, and to appeal coverage denials Investigate the growing concentration (mergers) in the insurance and provider sectors and determine why, despite their purchasing power, insurers are unable to adequately slow health inflation. ______ Prepared Statement of William Vaughan, Health Policy Analyst, Consumers Union Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee: Thank you for inviting Consumers Union to testify on Ways to Reduce the Cost of Health Insurance for Employers, Employees and their Families. Consumers Union is the independent, non-profit publisher of Consumer Reports.\\1\\ We not only evaluate consumer products like cars and toasters, we rate various health care providers and insurance products, and we apply comparative effectiveness research to save consumers millions and millions of dollars in purchasing the safest, most effective brand and generic drugs.\\2\\ Our May 2009 issue features an article on ``hazardous health plans,'' and points out that many policies are ``junk insurance'' with coverage gaps that leave you in big trouble. We believe (1) a structured marketplace where consumers can shop intelligently for insurance and (2) increased oversight, to prevent the type of abuses revealed in the UnitedHealth-Ingenix case, can create enormous, multi-billion dollar savings in insurance for taxpayers, employers, employees and their families The Crisis in Health Insurance: The Uninsured and the Underinsured Our readers and our polling tell us that the high cost of health care and the insecurity in the current system are the #1 long-term consumer problem facing American families. As the Committee is painfully aware, the cost of health insurance has increased dramatically in recent years. Consumers are both paying more in premiums, and shouldering a higher burden for out-of-pocket expenses, including deductibles, co-payments and other expenses not covered by their health insurance. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the cumulative growth in health insurance premiums between 1999 and 2008 was 119%, compared with cumulative inflation of 29% and cumulative wage growth of 34%. The rapid growth in overall premium levels means that both employers and workers are paying much higher amounts than they did a few years ago. The average employee contribution to company-provided health insurance has increased more than 120 percent since 2000. Too many under age 65 Americans are just another premium increase, a pink slip, an accident or an illness away from losing insurance or facing bankrupting medical costs. The uninsured and the insured alike are facing serious financial problems because of the extraordinary high cost of American health care, which is forcing millions of Americans into the condition of being `underinsured.' While the definition of the ``underinsured'' varies, quantitative definitions used by the government tend to focus on the percent of adults between 19 and 64 whose out-of-pocket health care expenses (excluding premiums) are 10 percent or more of family income.\\3\\ The ranks of the underinsured have grown. The Commonwealth Fund estimates that 42 percent of U.S. adults were uninsured or underinsured in 2007.\\4\\ You can be sure that with the recent loss of millions of jobs, these numbers will rise dramatically in 2008 and 2009. Research by the Consumer Reports National Research Center used a series of questions to determine the percent who were underinsured based on answers to questions such as whether they considered their deductible too high, and whether they felt adequately covered for costs of surgery, doctors visits, and catastrophic medical conditions. We found that 41 percent of the adult population sampled lacked adequate health coverage. Nine percent of the underinsured (by our survey) took extraordinary measures to pay medical bills, including dipping into IRAs, 401(k)s or pension funds, selling cars, trucks or boats, or taking on home equity or second mortgage loans. Underinsurance is a problem for two key reasons: Inadequate coverage results in the financial burden of uncovered health care. In our survey, for example, 30% of the underinsured had out-of-pocket costs of $3,000 or more for the previous 12 months.\\5\\ Underinsurance can lead to medical debt and even bankruptcy. The second problem posed by underinsurance is delayed or denied health care and poorer health outcomes, caused by the financial barrier to care. The key breakdowns of the health coverage marketplace that have fueled the growth in the underinsured included the increase in high deductible coverage, annual caps in coverage, lifetime benefit limits, limited benefits, pre-existing condition exclusions, higher co-pays, out-of-network charges, barebones policies, and a flawed individual health insurance market. Real Examples of People with Insurance Market Problems Last summer, Consumers Union traveled around the country and collected over 5,000 `stories' documenting why our nation needs fundamental health care reform. Appendix 1 is a tiny sample of those stories from some of your constituents, focusing on the particular problems of high cost, inadequate benefits, pre-existing condition exclusions, and administrative hassles in the individual insurance market. Solutions We hope that this year Congress will enact reform legislation to ensure that a comprehensive package of benefits is always available and affordable for every American. That legislation will mean a number of big changes, including insurance reform: no pre-existing conditions and no waiting periods. Assuming you enact that kind of reform, it will probably include some form of annual open enrollment period in some type of `marketplace' or `connector' where private and--we hope--a public plan could compete for consumers. It is in that marketplace of enrollment that we ask you to provide critical consumer reforms which will lower costs and save money for America's employers, employees, their families, and taxpayers. Why Consumers Need Help Shopping for Insurance The honest, sad truth is that most of us are terrible shoppers when it comes to insurance. The proof is all around you. -In FEHBP, hundreds of thousands of educated Federal workers spend much more than they should on plans that have no actuarial value over lower-cost plans.\\6\\ -In the somewhat structured Medigap market where there is a choice of plans A-L, some people spend up to 16 times the cost of an identical policy.\\7\\ -In Medicare Part D, only 9 percent of seniors at most are making the best economic choice (based on their past use of drugs being likely to continue into a new plan year), and most are spending $360-$520 or more than the lowest cost plan available.\\8\\ -In Part C, Medicare has reported that 27% of plans have less than 10 enrollees, thus providing nothing but clutter and confusion to the shopping place.\\9\\ The Institute of Medicine reports that 30 percent of us are health illiterate. That is about 90 million people who have a terrible time understanding 6th grade or 8th grade level descriptions of health terms. Only 12 percent of us, using a table, can calculate an employee's share of health insurance costs for a year.\\10\\ Yet consumers are expected to understand ``actuarial value,'' ``co- insurance'' versus ``co-payment,'' etc., ad nauseum. If Congress wants an efficient marketplace that can help hold down costs, you need to provide a structure to that marketplace. We recommend the following in any legislation you enact: Empower Consumers in a New Health Insurance Marketplace A new Office of Consumer Health Insurance Education and Information that will: -Provide general and comparative information about insurance issues and policies using consumer-friendly formats. We need a Medicare Compare-type website (with some improvements) applied to all health insurance sectors where policies can be compared on price and quality. Extending this comparison site to all insurance would help stop the waste in the Medigap market where seniors are talked into buying a standard policy that may be up to 1600 percent of the cost of the low-cost plan in their state. -Require standardization of insurance definitions and forms so consumers can easily compare policies on an ``apples-to-apples' basis. This is key. Hospitalization should mean hospitalization. Drug coverage should mean drug coverage, etc. In our May magazine article, we describe a policy in which the fine-print excluded the first day of hospitalization--usually or often the most expensive day when lab and surgical suite costs are incurred. NAIC could be charged with developing these definitions, backed up by the Secretary if they fail to act. -Require insurers to clearly state (in standardized formats) what's covered and what's not in every policy offering, and to estimate out- of-pocket costs under typical treatment scenarios. See Appendix II for how much policies can vary--to the surprise and shock of consumers. The Washington Consumers' Checkbook's ``Guide to Health Plans for Federal Employees (FEHBP)'' does a nice job showing what consumers can expect, but even in FEHB policies they find it impossible to provide clear data on all plans.\\11\\ -Maintain an insurance information and complaint hotline, and compile federal and state data on insurance complaints and report this data publicly on a Web site. The States would continue to regulate and supervise insurers operating in their state, but with the continual merger and growing concentration of insurers, consumers need a simple place where complaints can be lodged and data collected, analyzed, and reported nationally concerning the quality of service offered by insurers. This type of central complaint office may have allowed quicker detection of the UnitedHealth-Ingenix abuse of underpaying `out-of-network' claims. -Institute and operate quality rating programs of insurance products and services. This would be similar to the Medicare Part D website, with its `5 star' system. -Manage a greatly expanded State Health Insurance Assistance Program that would provide technical and financial support (through federal grants) to community-based non-profit organizations providing one-on-one insurance counseling to consumers. These programs need to be greatly expanded if you want the marketplace/connector to work. The SHIPs should be further professionalized, with increased training and testing of the quality of their responses to the public. Instead of roughly a $1 per Medicare beneficiary for the SHIPs, the new program should be funded at roughly the level that employers provide for insurance counseling. We understand that can range from $5 to $10 or more per employee. An insurance ``exchange'' or ``connector,'' offering a choice of plans, that will: -Like Medigap, include an optimal number of plan choices--not too few and not too many. - Limit excessive variations in benefit design so that plans compete more on price and quality. Consumers want choice of doctor and hospital. We do not believe that they are excited by an unlimited choice of middlemen insurers.\\12\\ Fewer offerings of meaningful choices would be appreciated. There are empirical studies showing that there is such a thing as too much choice, and dozens and dozens of choices can paralyze decision- making.\\13\\ The insurance market can be so bewildering and overwhelming that people avoid it. We think that is a major reason so many people having picked a Part D plan, do not review their plan and fail to make rational, advantageous economic changes during the open enrollment period. It is shocking that CMS allowed roughly 1400 Part C plans with less than 10 members to continue to clutter the marketplace. What a waste of time and money for all concerned. Reform legislation should set some guidance on preventing the proliferation of many plans with tiny differences that just serve to confuse a consumer's ability to shop on price and quality. We hope you will enact a core benefit package which all Americans will always have. If people want to buy additional coverage, there would be identical packages of extra coverage (as in the Medigap program) that many different companies could offer for sale. Consumers would have to be shown the pricing and quality ratings of those different packages before purchase. (Chairman Stark's AmeriCare bill includes much of this concept.\\14\\) We believe standard benefit packages (and definitions) are the key to facilitating meaningful competition.\\15\\ -Require information on price and quality to be presented in user- friendly formats Medicare law requires a pharmacist to tell consumers if there is a lower-priced generic available in their plan. A similar concept in the insurance market might be scored by CBO as driving savings. That is, before you enroll in a plan, you must be told if there is an insurer with equal or better quality ratings offering the same standard structured package. -Require plans to provide year-long benefit, price, and provider network stability In Medicare Part D, we saw plans advertise certain drug costs during the autumn open enrollment period, and then by February or March increase prices on various drugs so much that the consumer's effort to pick the most economical plan for their drugs was totally defeated. This type of price change--where the consumer has to sign up for the year and the insurer can change prices anytime--is a type of bait and switch that should be outlawed. -Protect against marketing abuses and punish insurers that mislead consumers We urge stronger penalties against sales abuses. We assume that any reform bill will include the best possible risk adjustment so as to reduce insurers constant efforts to avoid the least healthy individuals (e.g., rewarding sales forces for signing up healthy individuals). This would have the added benefit of encouraging development of best practices for efficient treatment of these complex cases--which is a key part of controlling costs over time. -Make consumers fully aware of their rights to register complaints about health plan service, coverage denials, balance-billing and co-pay problems, and to appeal coverage denials We urge you to require the standardization and simplification of grievance and appeals processes, so that it is easier for consumers to get what they are paying for. Many are worrying that comparative effectiveness research (CER) may lead to limits of what is covered. We believe CER will help us all get the best and safest care. It makes sense to give preference to those items which objective, hard science says are the best. But if a drug, device, or service does not work for an individual, then that individual must be able to try another drug, device, or service. The key to this is ensuring that the nation's insurers have honest, usable appeals processes in place. This legislative effort is where we should be putting our energy to address the otherwise legitimate concern of many people about CER. Do More to Fight Fraud in Insurance American consumers need a better system to prevent, detect, and correct insurance fraud and abuse. We are surprised that there has not been more outrage over the recent court findings and discoveries of the New York Attorney General that for at least a decade American consumers have been ripped off by a combination of health insurers and subsidiary data collection firm practices. In the midst of this escalating crisis of out-of-pocket costs, consumers have also been forced to contend with a gravely-flawed out- of-network reimbursement system. According to a recent investigation by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, and recent settlements with some the nation's largest insurance carriers, it now appears that consumers may have been underpaid for their out-of-network reimbursements by hundreds of millions of dollars. Senate Commerce Committee Chairman has said ``billions of dollars.'' \\16\\ The databases used to calculate out-of-network reimbursements are riddled with serious data quality problems and massive financial conflicts of interest. Over the last several years, Consumers Union has become increasingly concerned about consumer problems in obtaining fair, appropriate and timely reimbursement for out-of-network health services. These problems came to our attention as a result of consumer complaints, concerns expressed by physicians and employers, reports in the news media, and litigation. In particular, in New York state, we were aware that the American Medical Association, the Medical Society of the State of New York, other state medical societies, New York State United Teachers, Civil Service Employees Association (CSEA), other public employee unions and other consumer plaintiffs had sued UnitedHealth Group in 2000, alleging that they were being systematically shortchanged regarding out-of-network payments. We were therefore very pleased when Attorney General Andrew Cuomo initiated a national investigation of problems relating to out-of- network charges in February, 2008. The methods used by insurance companies to calculate ``usual, customary and reasonable'' rates (also known as UCR rates) have long been obscure and mysterious to consumers. It was not easy for consumers to verify the basis of the alleged UCR rates, or to contest perceived underpayments. Companies are supposed to disclose the details of how they calculate these charges upon request. But in practice many consumers found it difficult to find out how the charges are calculated, and what they are based on. Over 110 million Americans--roughly one in three consumers--are covered by health insurance plans which provide an out-of-network option, such as Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) and Point of Service (POS) plans This includes approximately 70% of consumers who have employer-sponsored health coverage. Consumers and employers often pay higher premiums to participate in an out-of-network insurance plan, because it gives patients greater flexibility in seeking care from doctors, specialists and providers who are not in a closed health plan network. In most out-of-network plans, the insurer agrees to pay a fixed percentage of the ``usual, customary and reasonable'' rate for the service (typically 80% of the rate), which is supposed to be a fair reflection of the market rate for that service in a geographic area. Because the health plan does not have a contract with the out-of-network doctor or provider, the consumer is financially responsible for paying the balance of the bill--whatever the insurance company doesn't pay. By law, the provider may pursue the consumer for the entire amount of the payment, regardless of how little or how much the insurer reimburses the consumer. Even if UCR charges were calculated accurately, consumers could still experience ``sticker shock'' when they get the medical bills for out-of-network care. Why? They may not understand that the insurance company didn't agree to pay 80% of the doctor's bill--they only agreed to pay 80% of the ``usual and customary'' rate, which is a kind of average of charges in a geographic area. For example, suppose a patient went to visit the doctor for a physical, and was charged $200. Eighty percent of $200 is $160. But if an impartial and accurate calculation of ``usual and customary rate'' shows that what other comparable doctors charge for physicals is an average of $160, the insurance company would only pay $128, or 80% of $160. The consumer would be responsible for paying the balance of $72. The key problem with the out-of-network reimbursement system is that the UCR rates were not calculated in a fair and impartial way. For the last ten years or so, the primary databases that are used by insurers to determine ``usual, customary and reasonable'' rates have been owned by Ingenix, a wholly-owned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group. Ingenix operates a very large repository of commercial medical billing data, and prepares billing schedules that are used to calculate the market price of provider health services. In 1998, Ingenix purchased the Prevailing Healthcare Charges System (PHCS), a database that was first developed by the Health Insurance Association of America, an insurance industry trade association started in 1974. Also in 1997, Ingenix purchased Medical Data Research and a customized Fee Analyzer from Medicode, a Utah-based health care company. Thanks to the Attorney General's investigation, however, we now know that there were serious problems with the Ingenix database that appear to have consistently led to patients paying more, and insurers paying less. In January, 2009, Attorney General Cuomo announced key findings from his office's investigation regarding the out-of-network reimbursement system: According to an independent analysis of over 1 million billing records in New York state, the Ingenix databases understate the market rate for physician visits by rates ranging from 10 to 28 percent across New York state. Consumers got much less than the promised UCR rate, so that instead of getting reimbursed for 80% of the UCR charge, they effectively got 70%, 60% or less. Given the very large number of consumers in out-of-network plans--110 million nationally--this translates into hundreds of millions of dollars in losses (perhaps more) over the last ten years for consumers around the country. UnitedHealth has a serious financial conflict of interest in owning and operating the Ingenix databases in connection with determining reimbursement rates. Ingenix is not an independent database--it is wholly-owned by UnitedHealth Group, Inc. It receives billing data from many insurers and in turn furnishes data back to them, including to its own parent company, UnitedHealth. UnitedHealth had a financial incentive to understate the UCR rates it provided to its own affiliates, and other health insurers also had an incentive to manipulate the data they submit to Ingenix so as to depress reimbursement rates. In general, there is no easy way for consumers to find out what the UCR rates are before visiting a medical provider. The Attorney General characterized Ingenix as a ``black box'' for consumers, who could not easily find out what level of reimbursement they would receive when selecting a provider. When they received a bill for out- of-network services, consumers weren't sure if the insurance company was underpaying them, or whether the physician was overcharging them. As an example of the lack of transparency, when UnitedHealth members complained their medical costs were unfairly high, the United hid its connection to Ingenix by claiming the UCR rate was the product of ``independent research.'' The Ingenix database had a range of serious data problems, including faulty data collection, outdated information, improper pooling of dissimilar charges, and failure to conduct regular audits of the billing data submitted by insurers. As a result of the Attorney General's investigation, on January 13, UnitedHealth agreed to close the two databases operated by Ingenix, and pay $50 million to a qualified nonprofit organization that will establish a new, independent database to help determine fair out-of- network reimbursement rates for consumers throughout the U.S. As a central result of his investigation, Attorney General Cuomo concluded that: ``* * * the structure of the out-of-network reimbursement system is broken. The system that is meant to reimburse consumers fairly as a reflection of the market is instead wholly owned and operated by the [insurance] industry. The determination of out-of-network rates is an industry-wide problem and accordingly needs an industry-wide solution. Consumers require an independent database to reflect true market- rate information, rather than a database owned and operated by an insurance company. A viable alternative that provides rates fairly reflecting the market based on reliable data should be set up to solve this problem * * * Consumers should be able to find out the rate of reimbursement before they decide to go out of network, and they should be able to find out the purchase price before they shop for insurance policies or for out-of-network care.'' While UnitedHealth did not acknowledge any wrongdoing in the settlement, its agreement with the New York Attorney General ended the role of Ingenix in calculating UCR charges, and created a new national framework for a fair solution. In fact, in a press release announcing the settlement, Thomas L. Strickland, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer of UnitedHealth Group, expressed strong support for a nonprofit database to maintain a national repository of medical billing information: ``We are committed to increasing the amount of useful information available in the health care marketplace so that people can make informed decisions, and this agreement is consistent with that approach and philosophy. We are pleased that a not-for-profit entity will play this important role for the marketplace.'' Shortly after settling with the Attorney General's office, UnitedHealth also settled the lawsuit brought by the AMA and Medical Society of the State of New York, other physician groups, unions and consumer plaintiffs for $350 million, the largest insurance cash settlement in US history. As sought by MSSNY and the other physician groups, United also agreed to reform the way that out-of-network charges were calculated. Since January, nine other insurers with operations in New York State, including huge national insurers such as Wellpoint, Aetna and Cigna, have also agreed to stop using data furnished by Ingenix, and to contribute funds in support of the new nonprofit database. The leaders of other insurance companies have also expressed support for a new nonprofit database to increase transparency and reduce conflicts of interest, and pledged to use the database when it becomes available. Two insurance companies agreed to also reprocess claims from consumers who believe they were underpaid for their out-of-network charges. All told, the Attorney General has now collected over $94 million to support the new independent database, which will be based at a university in New York. Implications of the New York State Investigation From a consumer point of view, Attorney General Cuomo's intervention has been extremely helpful for consumers in New York and across the U.S. This investigation squarely exposed the problems resulting in underpayment of consumers and physicians, and created a sweeping new framework for a national solution. The plan set out in the agreements reached by Attorney General Cuomo will help bring comprehensive, sweeping reform to the out-of-network reimbursement system. The investigation has exposed a swamp of financial shenanigans, and now reached a critical juncture. Consumers Union is calling for coordinated action by state and federal policymakers and regulators to help to consolidate the investigation's gains, and ensure that the new database for calculating out-of-network charges will be broadly used across the entire marketplace. First, regulators need to hold insurance companies accountable to their contractual promises, on an ongoing basis. Consumers clearly have the right to expect that their health insurance policies will pay the bills that they are legally obligated to pay. We rely on the promises our insurance companies make in their contracts, and we expect the provisions of those contracts to be enforced by regulators and the courts. If your policy says it will pay you 80% of the ``usual and customary'' charge for a medical service, it should pay that amount. To enforce this principle in New York state, Attorney General Cuomo used his authority under New York's General Business Law Sec. 349 and Sec. 350, which prohibits deceptive acts and practices against consumers, to bring the insurance industry into compliance in New York state, as well as sections of the insurance law and the common law. Other states have similar laws, and they should be appropriately used when needed to prevent egregious consumer rip-offs. Everyone can easily agree that insurance companies should not engage in deceptive or unfair practices against consumers. But the reality is that it takes sustained effort and political will to achieve the vigorous, comprehensive enforcement of state and federal insurance and consumer protection laws and regulations. In this case, the technical nature of the subject matter, and the obscure, veiled nature of the Ingenix database, resulted in a persisting rip-off that unfortunately took far too many years to rein in. This case raises very troubling questions about why financial rip- offs persist in the marketplace for many years without effective intervention at the state or federal level. Why didn't the alarms go off earlier about unfair practices that created very large financial losses for consumers? Since this rip-off was occurring all across the Nation, why didn't a Federal agency or official step in to stop it and help consumers? As part of health care reform, we hope you will create a national office charged with working with and assisting State regulators, to monitor and investigate health insur"
