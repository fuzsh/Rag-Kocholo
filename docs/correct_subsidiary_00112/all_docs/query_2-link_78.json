BUSINESS\n\nUnitedHealth Group is a national leader offering health care coverage and\n\nrelated services to help people achieve improved health and well-being through\n\nall stages of life. The Company operates in all 50 states, the District of\n\nColumbia, Puerto Rico and internationally. UnitedHealth Group's products and\n\nservices reflect a number of core capabilities, including medical information\n\nmanagement, health benefit administration, care coordination, risk assessment\n\nand pricing, health benefit design and provider contracting. With these\n\ncapabilities, United is able to provide comprehensive health care management\n\nservices through organized health systems and insurance products, including\n\nhealth maintenance organizations (\"HMOs\"), point-of-service plans (\"POS\"),\n\npreferred provider organizations (\"PPO\") and managed indemnity programs. The\n\nCompany also offers specialized health care management services and products\n\nsuch as behavioral health services, workers compensation and disability\n\nservices, utilization review services, specialized provider networks, employee\n\nassistance programs, and knowledge and information services.\n\nUnitedHealth Group is a Minnesota corporation, incorporated in January 1977.\n\nUnless the context otherwise requires, the terms \"United,\" \"UnitedHealth Group\"\n\nor the \"Company\" refer to United HealthCare Corporation and its subsidiaries,\n\nwhich operate under the name of, and is sometimes referred to in this Form 10-K\n\nas, UnitedHealth Group. United's executive offices are located at 300 Opus\n\nCenter, 9900 Bren Road East, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343; telephone (612)\n\n936-1300.\n\nBUSINESS OPERATIONS\n\nThe Company operates in the health and well-being marketplace. In late 1997,\n\nthe Company announced an internal realignment that established strategic\n\nbusiness units for each of the Company's six key business lines. These\n\nbusinesses include UnitedHealthcare, Unimerica, Uniprise, Ovations, Specialized\n\nCare Services and Ingenix. While the Company's general management and various\n\noperational aspects, including information systems and certain administrative\n\nfunctions, remain interrelated, the realignment allows each business to focus\n\nfully on its specific set of customers and markets. The Unimerica business line\n\nprovides insurance services to the other businesses of UnitedHealth Group, and\n\nits results are reported in the segment that originates the business. The\n\nresults of UnitedHealthcare and Ovations are combined in one segment.\n\nUNITEDHEALTHCARE\n\nUnitedHealthcare operates organized health systems. As of December 31, 1998,\n\nUnitedHealthcare held a majority ownership interest in health plans operating in\n\napproximately 40 markets nationwide and in Puerto Rico. UnitedHealthcare also is\n\nengaged in a joint venture that operates a health plan in the Republic of South\n\nAfrica and provides consulting services in Germany, Hong Kong and the\n\nPhilippines through this business unit.\n\nFor organized health systems it owns, UnitedHealthcare assumes the risk for\n\nhealth care and administrative costs in return for premium revenue.\n\nUnitedHealthcare's owned health systems usually are licensed as health\n\nmaintenance organizations (\"HMOs\") or insurers. These plans provide\n\ncomprehensive health care coverage for a fixed fee or premium that usually does\n\nnot vary with the extent of medical services received by the member. Most of\n\nUnitedHealthcare's owned health plans contract with independent providers of\n\nhealth care services for medical and hospital services. UnitedHealthcare's\n\nhealth plans that employ health care providers strive for cost-effective\n\ndelivery of health care services by emphasizing appropriate use of these\n\nservices, promoting preventive health services, and encouraging the use of\n\nclinically proven treatments and best medical practices. UnitedHealthcare also\n\nprovides administrative and other management services to a limited number of\n\nhealth plans in which UnitedHealthcare has no ownership interest.\n\nUnitedHealthcare receives an administrative fee for providing its services to\n\nthese plans and generally assumes no responsibility for health care costs.\n\nPOINT-OF-SERVICE PRODUCTS. UnitedHealthcare's point-of-service products are\n\none of its most popular coverage options. Unlike some traditional HMO products,\n\nwhich only cover non-emergency services\n\n2\n\nreceived from contracted providers, point-of-service products also provide\n\ncoverage, usually at a lower level, for services received from non-contracted\n\nproviders. Sometimes, this out-of-network coverage is offered directly by the\n\nhealth plan, but more often it is provided by an insurance policy \"wrapped\n\naround\" the health plan benefit contract. The insurance policy usually is\n\nprovided through one of Unimerica's insurance subsidiaries.\n\nSELF-FUNDED PRODUCTS. UnitedHealthcare has developed self-funded products\n\nfor employers who want the cost containment aspects of an organized health\n\nsystem while self-insuring the health care cost risk. UnitedHealthcare uses the\n\nprovider networks it has developed for its health plan or insurance products for\n\nits self-funded products, many of which include a point-of-service feature. The\n\nprovider contracts for these products are with individual physicians, groups of\n\nphysicians and health care facilities and are generally on a standard\n\nfee-for-service basis. With self-funded products, employers and other sponsoring\n\ngroups have access to a provider network and the administrative and care\n\ncoordination services associated with an organized health system product, but\n\nthe sponsoring company or group generally bears the financial costs associated\n\nwith the health care.\n\nMEDICARE+CHOICE PLANS. Several of UnitedHealthcare's owned health plans\n\ncontract with the federal Health Care Financing Administration (\"HCFA\") to\n\nprovide coverage for Medicare-eligible individuals. Under these contracts, plans\n\nreceive a fixed monthly payment from HCFA for each enrolled individual and must\n\nprovide at least the benefits that would be covered under traditional Medicare.\n\nThe plans provide a significantly higher level of coverage and may, but often do\n\nnot, charge an additional monthly premium to the members for the greater\n\nbenefits. The health plans generally use a subset of their commercial product\n\nprovider network as the provider network for the Medicare products. Any\n\nMedicare-eligible person in a plan's service area may enroll in the Medicare\n\nproduct without underwriting or health screening. Features such as United Health\n\nPassport allow members to travel to other UnitedHealthcare Medicare sites and\n\nreceive their same benefits.\n\nSome of UnitedHealthcare's health plans also offer these Medicare products\n\nto or through employer groups as a way of providing retiree health care\n\ncoverage.\n\nMEDICAID PRODUCTS. Several of UnitedHealthcare's health plans offer\n\ncoverage to Medicaid-eligible individuals. These plans typically contract with a\n\nstate agency to provide such coverage and receive a fixed monthly payment for\n\neach enrolled individual. The level of benefits generally is set by contract,\n\nand few additional benefits are offered. Enrollment usually must be offered to\n\nall eligible individuals without underwriting or health screening. Generally,\n\nthe provider network for commercial products is used, but some providers may\n\nrefuse to participate in the Medicaid product and the network may have a\n\ndifferent number or set of providers for other reasons.\n\nOVATIONS\n\nOvations includes the Company's operations that target the market segment\n\ncomprised of people age 50 and older. These operations include Medigap and\n\nMedicare supplement products, the EverCare-Registered Trademark- program and the\n\nCompany's relationship with AARP.\n\nAARP. In early 1997, the Company finalized a 10-year agreement with the\n\nAmerican Association of Retired Persons (\"AARP\") to underwrite Medicare and\n\nhospital supplement insurance products effective January 1, 1998. During 1997,\n\nthe Company coordinated the transfer of the operations from AARP's existing\n\nvendor and prepared to implement this contract. As of January 1, 1998, the\n\nCompany's insurance subsidiaries assumed the underwriting risk, and Ovations\n\nassumed the claim administration associated with the business.\n\nEVERCARE-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-. The EverCare-Registered Trademark- program\n\ncoordinates the provision of a broad spectrum of health care services primarily\n\nto permanent nursing home residents through employed and contracted physicians\n\nand nurse practitioners. EverCare is participating in a demonstration project\n\nwith HCFA to offer health care services to the elderly nursing home residents in\n\nseveral separate locations throughout the country.\n\n3\n\nUNIMERICA\n\nUnimerica is UnitedHealth Group's insurance arm, which serves as the legal\n\ninsurer for insurance products offered through UnitedHealth Group businesses.\n\nUnimerica's insurance subsidiaries are licensed in all 50 states, the District\n\nof Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands.\n\nUnitedHealth Group reports the revenues from insurance products in the\n\nsegments that originate the business, not in Unimerica. Through these insurance\n\nsubsidiaries, Unimerica offers Options PPO, a national preferred provider\n\norganization product. Options PPO combines access to UnitedHealthcare's\n\ncommercial health plan networks and certain specialty services with managed\n\nindemnity coverage. Individuals covered under the Options PPO product have lower\n\nout-of-pocket costs when they obtain covered services from contracted providers,\n\nbut also have the option to go outside of the network for covered services.\n\nFor customers with less than 50 employees, Unimerica typically sells its\n\nproducts on an insured basis for a fixed premium, with no experience adjustments\n\nmade to the premium. This type of business often has been subject to sudden and\n\nunpredictable changes in health care costs and generally has high administrative\n\nand marketing expenses. In addition, these products are subject to extensive\n\nstate regulations. For larger customers, Unimerica sells these products on both\n\nan insured and self-funded basis. The insured products often are sold on an\n\nexperience-rated basis, and the self-funded products usually are sold on an\n\nadministrative fee basis. In some cases, the agreement with the customer\n\nincludes penalties or rewards related to administrative service standards and/or\n\nhealth care costs.\n\nUnimerica's insurance subsidiaries also offer several health insurance\n\nproducts in conjunction with health plan products. These products help employers\n\nreplace multiple health care policies and vendors with a single health care\n\nplan. These subsidiaries also offer reinsurance and other insured products on a\n\nselective basis to most of UnitedHealthcare's health plans and to employers and\n\nother sponsoring groups offering self-funded health care benefit plans. Under an\n\nagreement with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (\"MetLife\"), UnitedHealth\n\nGroup businesses offers MetLife's life, dental, accidental death and\n\ndismemberment and short-term disability products to customers, and MetLife\n\noffers UnitedHealth Group's health care coverage products to MetLife customers.\n\nThis agreement with MetLife also contains certain exclusivity and\n\nnon-competition provisions.\n\nUNIPRISE\n\nUniprise focuses on UnitedHealth Group's business with large employers. Its\n\ncore competencies include sales and account management, benefits administration\n\nand customer services, including government-related operations, and care\n\nmanagement.\n\nUniprise provides sales and account management services to more than 200\n\ncustomers, approximately 50 percent of which are Fortune 500 companies.\n\nUnitedHealth Group's network-based medical and insurance products and\n\nspecialized care services are available to these customers, with various types\n\nof funding arrangements. Uniprise specializes in serving the needs of large\n\nmulti-site employers, and offers long-term strategic health care coverage\n\nplanning to its customers.\n\nThe operations unit of Uniprise provides benefits administration services\n\nand customer services to UnitedHealth Group customers in its other business\n\nlines. Benefits administration services include enrollment, eligibility, claims\n\nprocessing, and billing. Customer services include telephonic information,\n\nprovider directories and identification card production, and oversight of the\n\ngovernment operations and care management centers divisions.\n\nThe government operations division provides Medicare Part A services for\n\nhospitals and nursing homes in Connecticut, New York and Michigan and Medicare\n\nPart B services for beneficiaries and providers in Connecticut, Minnesota,\n\nMississippi and Virginia. This division also provides specialized claims\n\nprocessing services for durable medical equipment in 10 northeastern states.\n\nThis unit serves as the national Medicare Part B carrier for the Railroad\n\nRetirement Board. In addition, at the request of the Office of Personnel\n\nManagement and HCFA, the government operations division contracts with all\n\n4\n\ninsurance carriers involved in the administration of the Federal Employee Health\n\nBenefit Plan (\"FEHBP\").\n\nThe care management centers division offers customers medical management\n\nprograms designed to improve patients' clinical outcomes, reduce medical\n\nexpenses, and increase consumer satisfaction. These services include utilization\n\nreview, review of hospital-based services, and the administration of high-impact\n\nmedical programs based upon customer-specific demographic and claims data.\n\nSPECIALIZED CARE SERVICES\n\nSpecialized Care Services is a portfolio of businesses that focus on\n\nspecific aspects of health and well-being. These businesses sell its products\n\nand services to and through other UnitedHealth Group businesses as well as to\n\nindependent entities such as HMOs, PPOs, insurers, Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans,\n\nthird-party administrators, employers, labor unions and/or government agencies.\n\nThese businesses generally receive fees for the services they provide, which are\n\nprimarily administrative in nature. Specialized Care Services assumes no\n\nresponsibility for health care costs except for certain behavioral health\n\nproducts. These businesses assume some responsibility for health care costs\n\nrelated to providing mental health/substance abuse services.\n\nBEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. Specialized Care Services provides behavioral\n\nhealth services through United Behavioral Health (\"UBH\"), which offers\n\nbehavioral health care management services, employer assistance programs, and\n\npsychiatric disability management services through specialized provider networks\n\nand behavioral health care managers. UBH customers include most of\n\nUnitedHealthcare's health plans, private and public sector employers and\n\ngovernment agencies. These services are provided by a national network of\n\ncontracted providers. United assumes the responsibility for health care costs\n\nrelated to some of these services. UBH serves approximately 14 million\n\nindividuals.\n\nHEALTH INFORMATION, EDUCATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES. Specialized Care\n\nServices provides health information, education and related services through\n\nOptum-Registered Trademark-. Optum offers a full spectrum of counseling, access\n\nand consumer information services for helping individuals manage their health\n\nand well-being. Its services are available via 24-hour telephone information\n\nlines, publications, audiotapes, face-to-face meetings and the Internet. Optum\n\nservices are available to approximately 15 million individuals.\n\nTRANSPLANT SERVICES. Specialized Care Services offers transplant services\n\nthrough United Resource Networks. United Resource Networks offers clients access\n\nto a network of health care facilities for transplant-related services and\n\ntransplant care management services. United Resource Networks negotiates fixed,\n\ncompetitive rates for high-cost, low-frequency health care services such as\n\norgan and tissue transplants. United Resource Networks serves 450 clients,\n\nrepresenting approximately 37 million individuals.\n\nINGENIX\n\nIngenix builds upon UnitedHealth Group's heritage of using its large\n\ndatabase and expertise to provide knowledge and information services to\n\nproviders, drug and device manufacturers, the government, payers, employers and\n\nother interested organizations. It was formed by combining UnitedHealth Group's\n\ninformation-related businesses and capabilities and expanded through several\n\nacquisitions, as well as internal growth.\n\nIngenix provides four broad types of products and services:\n\nCONSULTING. Ingenix provides consulting services to providers, payers,\n\nemployers and other health system participants focusing on actuarial and\n\nfinancial matters, product development, provider contracting, and medical policy\n\nand management.\n\nPHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES. Ingenix performs clinical trials services and\n\noutcomes and pharmacoeconomic research for pharmaceutical and medical device\n\nmanufacturers globally. Services\n\n5\n\ninclude helping find and train investigators and recruit patients, developing\n\nresearch protocols, providing regulatory assistance, data collection and\n\nmanagement, biostatistics, and general project management.\n\nPUBLISHING. Ingenix's publications unit sells print and electronic media\n\nproducts that provide information regarding coding, reimbursement, billing,\n\ncompliance and other general health care issues.\n\nSOFTWARE, DATA AND SERVICES. Ingenix's software, data and services include\n\ndatabases for benchmarking, software to analyze and report cost and utilization\n\nof services, data management services, HEDIS reporting, fraud and abuse\n\nservices, claims editing software, and reimbursement systems audits.\n\nEXPANSION AND DIVESTITURE OF OPERATIONS\n\nUnited continually evaluates expansion opportunities and often considers\n\nwhether to divest or stop offering certain of its businesses or products.\n\nExpansion opportunities may include acquiring specialized care services programs\n\nor insurance and health plan operations. United also devotes significant\n\nattention to developing new products and techniques for managing health care\n\ncosts, measuring the outcomes and efficiency of health care delivered, and\n\ncoordinating and managing health care delivery systems. As part of its expansion\n\nefforts, in 1998 the Company earmarked $35 million from the Company's corporate\n\nusable cash reserves to invest in and help develop small but promising ventures.\n\nDuring 1998, the Company completed several acquisitions and also sold or\n\nterminated certain lines of business and ceased offering some products, all as\n\npart of its ongoing emphasis on its strategic focus. If the Company were to make\n\nnumerous acquisitions, it may affect its ability to integrate and manage its\n\noverall business effectively. Integration activities relating to acquisitions\n\nmay increase costs, affect membership, affect revenue and earnings growth and\n\nadversely affect United's financial results.\n\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\n\nUnited's primary business, offering health care coverage and health care\n\nmanagement services, is heavily regulated at both the federal and state level.\n\nUnited believes it complies in all material respects with the various federal\n\nand state regulations that apply to its current operations. To maintain\n\ncompliance, United or a subsidiary may make occasional changes in its services,\n\nproducts, organizational or capital structure, or marketing methods.\n\nGovernment regulation of health care coverage products and services is a\n\nchanging area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Regulatory\n\nagencies generally have broad discretion to issue regulations and interpret and\n\nenforce laws and rules. Changes in applicable laws and regulations are\n\ncontinually being considered, and the interpretation of existing laws and rules\n\nalso may change periodically. These regulatory revisions could affect United's\n\noperations and financial results. Certain proposed changes in Medicare and\n\nMedicaid programs may improve opportunities to enroll people under products\n\ndeveloped for the senior populations. Other proposed changes may limit available\n\nreimbursement and increase competition in those programs, with adverse effects\n\non United's financial results. Also, it may be more difficult for United to\n\ncontrol medical costs if federal and state bodies continue to consider and enact\n\nsignificant and sometimes onerous managed care laws and regulations. Examples of\n\nsuch laws are medical malpractice liability laws for health plans; mandates\n\nrequiring health plans to offer point-of-service plans and other benefits such\n\nas direct access and formulary restrictions; limits on contractual terms with\n\nproviders, including termination provisions; implementation of a mandatory third\n\nparty review process for certain coverage denials and other laws and limits on\n\nutilization management.\n\nHIPPAA. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996\n\n(\"HIPAA\") may represent the most significant federal reform of employee benefits\n\nlaw since the enactment of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\")\n\nin 1974. HIPAA's federal standards apply to both the group and individual health\n\ninsurance markets, including self-insured employee benefit plans. Some of\n\nHIPAA's significant provisions include guarantees of the availability of health\n\ninsurance for certain employees and individuals; limits on the use of\n\npreexisting condition exclusions; prohibitions against discriminating on the\n\nbasis of health status; and requirements which make it easier to continue\n\ncoverage in cases where an\n\n6\n\nemployee is terminated or changes employers. While United currently believes\n\nthat it is in material compliance with the requirements of HIPAA, the law is far\n\nreaching and complex, and the federal agencies involved in the enforcement of\n\nHIPAA's provisions have been slow to provide guidance regarding HIPAA's\n\nrequirements in the form of final rules and regulations. Consequently, United's\n\nefforts to measure, monitor, and adjust its business practices to comply with\n\nHIPAA are ongoing. Further, significant enforcement responsibilities for HIPAA's\n\nprovisions have been given to the states. It is likely that United will\n\nencounter different interpretations of HIPAA's provisions in the different\n\nstates as well as varying enforcement philosophies which may inhibit United's\n\nability to standardize its products and services across state lines. Ultimately,\n\nunder HIPAA and other state laws, cost control through provider contracting and\n\ncoordinating care may become more important, and United believes its experience\n\nin these areas will allow it to compete effectively.\n\nFRAUD AND ABUSE. Health care fraud and abuse have become a top priority for\n\nthe nation's law enforcement entities. The funding of such law enforcement\n\nefforts has increased dramatically in the past few years and is expected to\n\ncontinue. The focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in\n\nfederal government health care programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and FEHBP.\n\nUnited participates extensively in these programs. The regulations and\n\ncontractual requirements applicable to participants in these programs are\n\nextremely complex and ever changing. In light of this environment, United has\n\nre-emphasized its regulatory compliance efforts for these programs; however, the\n\nprograms are subject to highly technical rules. When combined with law\n\nenforcement intolerance for any level of noncompliance, these rules mean that\n\ncompliance efforts in this arena continue to be challenging.\n\nAUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS. United also is subject to governmental audits,\n\ninvestigations and enforcement actions. These include possible government\n\nactions relating to ERISA, which regulates insured and self-insured health\n\ncoverage plans offered by employers and United's services to such plans and\n\nemployers; FEHBP; federal and state fraud and abuse laws; state insurance or\n\nlicensing laws; laws relating to utilization management and the delivery of\n\nhealth care; and laws relating to Medicare, including ACR development, special\n\npayment status, payments for emergency room visits, and various other areas. Any\n\nsuch government actions could result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal\n\nfines or penalties, or other sanctions, including exclusion from participation\n\nin government programs. United is currently involved in various government\n\ninvestigations, audits and reviews, some of which are under FEHBP, ERISA, and\n\nthe authority of state departments of insurance. United does not believe the\n\nresults of current audits, individually or in the aggregate, will have a\n\nmaterial adverse effect on its financial position or results.\n\nHMOS. All of the states in which United's health plans offer HMO products\n\nregulate the activities of those health plans. Most states require periodic\n\nfinancial reports from entities licensed to operate as HMOs in their states and\n\nimpose minimum capital or reserve requirements. Some of United's health plan and\n\ninsurance subsidiaries must maintain specified capital levels to support their\n\noperations. In addition, state regulatory agencies require some United health\n\nplans and insurance subsidiaries to maintain restricted cash reserves\n\nrepresented by interest-bearing instruments, which are held by trustees or state\n\nregulatory agencies to ensure that each subsidiary maintains adequate financial\n\nreserves. Some state regulations allow agencies to review all contracts entered\n\ninto by HMOs, including management contracts and agreements between affiliates,\n\nfor reasonableness of fees charged and other provisions.\n\nUnited's health plans that have Medicare risk contracts are regulated by\n\nHCFA. HCFA has the right to audit health plans operating under Medicare risk\n\ncontracts to determine each health plan's compliance with HCFA's contracts and\n\nregulations and the quality of care being given to the health plan's members. To\n\nenter into Medicare risk contracts, a health plan must be either federally\n\nqualified or considered a Competitive Medical Plan under HCFA's requirements.\n\nHealth plans that offer a Medicare risk product also must comply with\n\nrequirements established by peer review organizations (\"PROs\"), which are\n\norganizations under contract with HCFA to monitor the quality of health care\n\nMedicare beneficiaries receive. PRO requirements relate to quality assurance and\n\nutilization review procedures. United's health plans that have Medicare cost\n\ncontracts are subject to similar regulatory requirements. In addition, these\n\n7\n\nhealth plans must file certain cost reimbursement reports with HCFA, which are\n\nsubject to audit and revision.\n\nUnited's health plans that have Medicaid contracts are subject to federal\n\nand state regulation regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees,\n\npayment for those services, and other aspects of the Medicaid program. Both\n\nMedicare and Medicaid have, or have proposed, regulations relating to fraud and\n\nabuse, physician incentive plans, and provider referrals that could affect\n\nUnited's operations.\n\nMany of United's health plans have contracts with FEHBP. These contracts are\n\nsubject to extensive regulation, including complex rules regarding premiums\n\ncharged. FEHBP is authorized to audit the rates charged retroactively and seek\n\npremium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that\n\nparticipate in the program, depending on the outcome of such audits.\n\nINSURANCE REGULATION. United's insurance subsidiaries and most of the\n\nCompany's health plans are regulated by the department of insurance or\n\nequivalent agency in each state or other jurisdiction in which the entity is\n\nlicensed. Regulatory authorities have extensive supervisory power regarding:\n\nlicensing; the amount of reserves that must be maintained; the approval of\n\ninsurance policy forms; the nature of, and limits on, insurance company\n\ninvestments; periodic examination of insurance company operations; the form and\n\ncontent of annual statements and other required reports on the financial\n\ncondition of insurance companies; and the capital requirements for insurance\n\ncompanies. United's insurance company subsidiaries must file periodic statutory\n\nfinancial statements in each jurisdiction in which they are licensed.\n\nAdditionally, these companies are periodically examined by the insurance\n\ndepartments or equivalent agencies of the jurisdictions in which they are\n\nlicensed to do business.\n\nINSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS. Many of United's health plans and\n\neach of United's insurance subsidiaries are regulated under state insurance\n\nholding company regulations. Insurance holding company laws and regulations\n\ngenerally require registration with the state department of insurance and the\n\nfiling of certain reports that describe capital structure, ownership, financial\n\ncondition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations.\n\nVarious notice, reporting and pre-approval requirements generally apply to\n\ntransactions between companies within an insurance holding company system,\n\ndepending on the size and nature of the transactions. Some state insurance\n\nholding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or, in\n\ncertain circumstances, prior notice of acquisitions, and certain material\n\nintercompany transfers of assets, as well as certain transactions between the\n\nregulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates.\n\nTPAS. Certain subsidiaries of United also are licensed as third-party\n\nadministrators (\"TPAs\") where required. TPA regulations differ greatly from\n\nstate to state, but generally contain certain required administrative\n\nprocedures, periodic reporting obligations and minimum financial requirements.\n\nPPOS. Some United subsidiaries or products may be subject to PPO regulation\n\nin a particular state. PPO regulations generally contain network, contracting,\n\nfinancial and reporting requirements, which vary from state to state.\n\nUTILIZATION REVIEW REGULATIONS. Many states have enacted laws and/or\n\nadopted regulations governing utilization review activities, and these laws may\n\napply to some United operations. Generally, these laws and regulations set\n\nspecific standards for delivery of services, confidentiality, staffing and\n\npolicies and procedures of private review entities, including the credentials\n\nrequired of personnel.\n\nMCOS. Many states have enacted laws that allow self-insured employers\n\nand/or insurance carriers to use a state-certified managed care organization\n\n(\"MCO\") to apply medical management and other managed care techniques to the\n\nmedical benefit portion of workers' compensation. United's subsidiaries\n\ngenerally have sought MCO certification in states where it is available and\n\nwhere they market managed care workers compensation products. MCO laws differ\n\nsignificantly from state to state, but generally address network and utilization\n\nreview activities.\n\nERISA. ERISA regulates how goods and services are provided to or through\n\ncertain types of employee health benefit plans. ERISA is a complex set of laws\n\nand regulations that is subject to periodic\n\n8\n\ninterpretation by the United States Department of Labor. ERISA places controls\n\non how United's business units may do business with employers covered by ERISA,\n\nparticularly employers that maintain self-funded plans. The Department of Labor\n\nhas an ongoing ERISA enforcement program, which may result in additional\n\nconstraints on how ERISA-governed benefit plans conduct their activities. There\n\nrecently have been legislative attempts to limit ERISA's preemptive effect on\n\nstate laws. Such limitations could increase United's liability exposure under\n\nstate law-based suits relating to employee health benefits offered by United's\n\nhealth plans and specialty businesses and permit greater state regulation of\n\nother aspects of those businesses' operations.\n\nYEAR 2000 ACTIVITIES\n\nOur business depends significantly on effective information systems, and we\n\nhave many different information systems for our various businesses. Our\n\ninformation systems require ongoing enhancements to keep pace with the\n\ncontinuing changes in information technology, evolving industry standards, and\n\ncustomer preferences. We have been modifying our computer systems to accommodate\n\nthe Year 2000. The Year 2000 problem exists throughout the global marketplace,\n\nas many computer systems and applications were developed to recognize the year\n\nas a two-digit number, with the digits \"00\" being recognized as the year 1900.\n\nStarting in 1995, our formal Year 2000 Project Office began implementing a\n\nremediation plan to ensure that critical information systems applications,\n\nend-user developed application tools, and critical business interfaces remain\n\nintact, and can function properly through the century change. We are on schedule\n\nto complete, test, and certify our Year 2000 remediation efforts by September\n\n30, 1999. A more detailed description and current status of our Year 2000\n\nactivities follows.\n\nTECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nMAINFRAME TECHNOLOGY. In conjunction with our two vendors that provide\n\nsupport for our data center operations, we have completed, tested and certified\n\n99% of our remediation efforts for the hardware, operating system and supporting\n\nsoftware remediation efforts on our two primary mainframe computer systems. In\n\naddition, we are in the process of reviewing some of our smaller mainframe\n\nsystems and making modifications as necessary. We expect to be 100% complete\n\nwith all mainframe hardware and software technology Year 2000 modifications by\n\nMarch 31, 1999. We also have installed separate test environments (both\n\nmainframe and distributed) to test our business applications in a simulated Year\n\n2000 environment.\n\nDESKTOP HARDWARE & SOFTWARE. We have inventoried all of our desktop\n\nhardware and software--over 40,000 computing devices of multiple makes and\n\nmodels. All non-compliant desktop hardware and software have been identified and\n\nare being modified or replaced with compliant systems by September 30, 1999.\n\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS. We have inventoried all of our telecommunication\n\nsystems--more than 28,000 telecommunication devices, including traffic routers\n\nand phone switches. We are using two outside vendors to assist us in modifying\n\nor replacing non-compliant telecommunication systems. As of December 31, 1998,\n\nwe were approximately 75% Year 2000 compliant with our data and voice networks.\n\nWe expect all our telecommunication networks and devices will be Year 2000\n\ncompliant by September 30, 1999.\n\nBUSINESS APPLICATIONS\n\nSOFTWARE APPLICATIONS. We use 500 different software applications that\n\ninclude over 80 million lines of computer code. We have surveyed our software\n\napplications and have identified systems that will not be used after December\n\n31, 1999, and systems that will be modified for Year 2000 compliance. We have\n\ndetermined that 36% of our software applications will not be used after December\n\n31, 1999 due to conversions, consolidations and software replacements. Of the\n\nremaining applications, over 90% have been made Year 2000 compliant, tested and\n\ncertified or are scheduled to be certified for compliance. The\n\n9\n\nbalance of the applications are yet to be tested. We expect all critical Year\n\n2000 software modifications to be completed by March 31, 1999, with further\n\ntesting and certification during the remainder of 1999.\n\nEND-USER DEVELOPED APPLICATIONS. End-user developed applications are\n\nanalysis tools that have been internally developed by individual employees or\n\noperating segments primarily running on personal computers or client servers.\n\nThe Year 2000 Project Office has continuously communicated with all employees\n\nexplaining the risks of non-compliant applications and provided tools and\n\ntechniques to make them compliant. We have identified and are tracking and\n\nassessing Year 2000 compliance issues with respect to all potentially critical\n\nend-user applications.\n\nOTHER YEAR 2000 MATTERS\n\nNON-INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. We have approximately 300 owned or\n\nleased facilities throughout the world. We have contacted all of our facility\n\nmanagers regarding Year 2000 compliance issues. In addition, we have contracted\n\nwith a real estate management company to assist in our Year 2000 compliance\n\nefforts. All facilities are scheduled to be Year 2000 compliant by September 1,\n\n1999.\n\nDEPENDENCE ON THIRD PARTIES. We have a contractual relationship with\n\napproximately 300,000 different medical providers and more than 92,000 vendors.\n\nApproximately 2,000 vendors have been identified as critical business partners\n\nand suppliers. We are currently in communication with these critical business\n\npartners to analyze their Year 2000 compliance efforts. We expect to complete\n\nour analysis of critical vendor readiness and identify alternative vendors,\n\nwhere necessary, by July 31, 1999. We will not be individually contacting all of\n\nthe 300,000 medical providers we conduct business with regarding Year 2000\n\ncompliance issues. However, we will be testing and verifying the electronic\n\ncollection of data with these providers through our EDI (electronic data\n\ninterface) clearinghouse vendors.\n\nCOSTS OF YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE. The projected costs of our Year 2000\n\ncompliance efforts and the date on which we plan to complete the necessary Year\n\n2000 remediation efforts are based on management's best estimates, which were\n\nderived utilizing various assumptions of future events. However, there can be no\n\nguarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ\n\nsignificantly from our current plans. Specific factors that might cause\n\nsignificant differences include, but are not limited to, the availability and\n\ncost of personnel trained in this area, the ability to locate and correct the\n\nrelevant computer codes, and the ability of our significant vendors, providers,\n\ncustomers and others with whom we conduct business to identify and resolve their\n\nown Year 2000 issues.\n\nCosts associated with modifying internal use software for Year 2000\n\ncompliance are charged to expense as incurred. Purchases of hardware or software\n\nthat replace existing hardware or software that is not Year 2000 compliant are\n\ncapitalized and amortized over their useful lives. As of December 31, 1998, our\n\nhistorical and projected costs to complete our Year 2000 remediation plan are as\n\nfollows (in millions):\n\nCOST INCURRED TO DATE PROJECTED COSTS\n\n---------------------------- ----------------------------\n\nYEAR RESOURCES AMORTIZATION RESOURCES AMORTIZATION TOTAL\n\n- ---------------------------------- ----------- --------------- ----------- --------------- ---------\n\n1996.............................. $ 1 $ -- $ -- $ -- $ 1\n\n1997.............................. 12 -- -- -- 12\n\n1998.............................. 18 -- 18\n\n1999.............................. -- -- 18 7 25\n\n2000.............................. -- -- 3 9 12\n\n2001.............................. -- -- -- 9 9\n\n2002.............................. -- -- -- 2 2\n\n----- ----- ----- ----- ---------\n\n$ 31 $ -- $ 21 $ 27 $ 79\n\n----- ----- ----- ----- ---------\n\n----- ----- ----- ----- ---------\n\nBUSINESS RISKS OF NON-COMPLIANT SYSTEMS. Although we are committed to\n\ncompleting and testing our remediation plan well in advance of the Year 2000,\n\nthere are risks if we do not meet our objectives by December 31, 1999.\n\nOperationally, the most severe risk is business interruption. Specific examples\n\nof\n\n10\n\nsituations that could cause business interruption include, but are not limited\n\nto: 1) computer hardware or application software processing errors or failures,\n\n2) facilities or infrastructure failures, or 3) critical outside providers,\n\nsuppliers, or customers who may not be Year 2000 compliant. Depending on the\n\nextent and duration of business interruption resulting from non-compliant Year\n\n2000 systems, such interruption may have a material adverse effect on our\n\nresults of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\n\nCONTINGENCY PLANS. Each area of our Year 2000 compliance effort is\n\ncurrently developing contingency plans to mitigate the risk of failure, and to\n\nprovide for a speedy recovery from possible failures associated with the century\n\nchange. The contingency plans detail strategies to implement in 1999 to prepare\n\nfor the century rollover, and actions to execute if problems arise. The target\n\ndate for completion of the initial contingency plans is April 1, 1999.\n\nContingency plans will be final by July 31, 1999.\n\nMARKETING\n\nThe Company's marketing strategy is defined and coordinated by each\n\nfunctional business unit's dedicated marketing staff. Within these business\n\nunits, primary marketing responsibility generally resides with a marketing\n\ndirector and a direct sales force. In addition, several of the business units\n\nrely upon independent insurance agents and brokers to sell some of the Company's\n\nhealth plan, insurance, self-funded and specialized care products. Marketing\n\nefforts also include public relations efforts and advertising programs that may\n\nuse television, radio, newspapers, magazines, billboards, direct mail and\n\ntelemarketing.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe managed health care industry evolved primarily because of health care\n\nbuyers' concerns about rising health care costs. The industry has brought\n\ngreater cost effectiveness and accountability into the health care system\n\nthrough managed care products, including health plans, PPOs, and specialized\n\nservices such as mental health or pharmacy benefit programs. The industry also\n\nhas helped increase the accessibility and quality of health care services.\n\nUnited operates in a highly competitive environment. Significant\n\nconsolidation has occurred within the managed care industry, creating stronger\n\nand more diverse competitors. At the same time, new competitors have entered the\n\nmarketplace, which also may increase competitive pressures. In certain areas,\n\ncurrent competition may limit United's ability to price its products at levels\n\nUnited believes appropriate. These competitive factors could adversely affect\n\nUnited's financial results.\n\nAs managed health care penetration of the health care market and the effects\n\nof health care reforms continue to increase nationwide, the Company expects it\n\nmay become increasingly difficult to obtain new contracts for its health plans\n\nwith large employer and government groups. The Company also expects competition\n\nfor smaller employer groups to intensify. In addition, employers increasingly\n\nmay choose to self-insure the health care risk, while seeking benefit\n\nadministration and utilization review services from third parties to help them\n\ncontrol and report health care costs.\n\nThe Company's business lines compete for group and individual membership\n\nwith other health insurance plans, Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans, health plans,\n\nHMOs, PPOs, third party administrators, health care management companies, and\n\nemployers or groups that elect to self-insure. The Company also faces\n\ncompetition from hospitals, health care facilities, and other health care\n\nproviders who have formed their own networks to contract directly with employer\n\ngroups and other prospective customers for the delivery of health care services.\n\nThe number and strength of the Company's competitors varies for each particular\n\nbusiness unit and geographic area. The Company believes that the principal\n\ncompetitive factors affecting the Company and its products include price, the\n\nlevel and quality of products and service, provider network capabilities, market\n\nshare, the offering of innovative products, product distribution systems,\n\nefficient administration operations, financial strength and marketplace\n\nreputation.\n\nThe Company currently believes that its competitive strengths include the\n\nbreadth of its product line, its geographic scope and diversity, the strength of\n\nits underwriting and pricing practices and staff, its significant market\n\nposition in certain geographic areas, the strength of its distribution network,\n\nits financial\n\n11\n\nstrength, its generally large provider networks that provide more member choice,\n\nits point-of-service products and experience, and its generally favorable\n\nmarketplace reputation. In some markets, however, the Company may be at a\n\ndisadvantage because of competitors with larger market shares, broader networks,\n\nnarrower networks (which may allow greater cost control and lower prices) or a\n\nmore-established marketplace name and reputation. The Company believes its\n\nrecent operational realignment will allow the individual business units to more\n\neffectively compete in their respective markets.\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nAs of December 31, 1998, the Company employed approximately 29,226\n\nindividuals. As of December 31, 1998, approximately 239 of the Company's\n\nemployees were represented by a union. The Company believes its employee\n\nrelations are good.\n\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\n\nThe statements contained in this Form 10-K, and the Management's Discussion\n\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and other sections\n\nof the Company's annual report to shareholders incorporated by reference in this\n\ndocument, include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private\n\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \"PSLRA\"). When used in this Form\n\n10-K and in future filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange\n\nCommission, in the Company's press releases, presentations to securities\n\nanalysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of an\n\nexecutive officer of the Company, the words or phrases \"believes,\"\n\n\"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"will likely result,\" \"estimates,\" \"projects\" or\n\nsimilar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.\n\nAny of these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may\n\ncause the Company's actual results to differ materially from the results\n\ndiscussed in the forward-looking statements.\n\nThe following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding\n\nour business that investors and others should consider. This discussion is\n\nintended to take advantage of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the PSLRA. In\n\nmaking these cautionary statements, we are not undertaking to address or update\n\neach factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or\n\nresults, and are not undertaking to address how any of these factors may have\n\ncaused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous\n\nfilings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may\n\nhave affected the Company's past, as well as current, forward-looking statements\n\nabout future results. The Company's actual results in the future may differ\n\nmaterially from those expressed in prior communications.\n\nHEALTH CARE COSTS. We use a large portion of our revenue to pay the costs\n\nof health care services or supplies delivered to our members. Total health care\n\ncosts we incur are affected by the number of individual services rendered and\n\nthe cost of each service. Much of our premium revenue is priced before services\n\nare delivered and the related costs are incurred, usually on a prospective\n\nannual basis. Although we try to base the premiums we charge in part on our\n\nestimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period, competition,\n\nand regulations and other circumstances may limit our ability to fully base\n\npremiums on estimated costs. In addition, many factors may and often do cause\n\nactual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums.\n\nThese factors may include increased use of services, increased cost of\n\nindividual services, catastrophes, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly\n\ntreatments, general inflation, new mandated benefits or other regulatory\n\nchanges, and insured population characteristics. In addition, the earnings we\n\nreport for any particular quarter include estimates of covered services incurred\n\nby our enrollees during that period for claims that have not been received or\n\nprocessed. Because these are estimates, our earnings may be adjusted later to\n\nreflect the actual costs. Relatively insignificant changes in the medical care\n\nratio, because of the narrow margins of our health plan business, can create\n\nsignificant changes in our earnings.\n\nOur medical care ratio has generally increased over the past several fiscal\n\nperiods. We are addressing the medical care ratio by altering benefit designs,\n\nrecontracting with providers, and aggressively increasing\n\n12\n\nboth our contemporaneous and retrospective claim management activities. Our\n\ninability to implement these changes successfully could lead to further\n\nincreases in our medical care ratio.\n\nIn addition, our operating results may be affected by the seasonal changes\n\nin the level of health care use during the calendar year. Although there are no\n\nassurances, per member medical costs generally have been higher in the first\n\nhalf than in the second half of each year.\n\nINDUSTRY FACTORS. The managed care industry receives significant negative\n\npublicity. This publicity has been accompanied by increased legislative\n\nactivity, regulation and review of industry practices. These factors may\n\nadversely affect our ability to market our products or services, may require us\n\nto change our products and services, and may increase the regulatory burdens\n\nunder which we operate, further increasing the costs of doing business and\n\nadversely affecting profitability.\n\nCOMPETITION. In many of our geographic or product markets, we compete with\n\na number of other entities, some of which may have certain characteristics or\n\ncapabilities that give them a competitive advantage. We believe the barriers to\n\nentry in these markets are not substantial, so the addition of new competitors\n\ncan occur relatively easily, and consumers enjoy significant flexibility in\n\nmoving to new managed care providers. Certain Company customers may decide to\n\nperform functions or services we provide for themselves, which would decrease\n\nour revenues. Certain Company providers may decide to market products and\n\nservices to our customers in competition with us. In addition, significant\n\nmerger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industry in which we operate\n\nas well as in industries that act as suppliers to us, such as the hospital,\n\nphysician, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. To the extent that\n\nthere is strong competition or that competition intensifies in any market, our\n\nability to retain or increase customers or providers, or maintain or increase\n\nour revenue growth, pricing flexibility, control over medical cost trends and\n\nour marketing expenses may be adversely affected.\n\nAARP CONTRACT. Under our long-term contract with the American Association\n\nof Retired Persons (\"AARP\"), we provide Medicare supplemental, hospital\n\nindemnity health insurance and other products to AARP members. As a result of\n\nthe agreement, the number of members we serve, products we offer, and services\n\nwe provide has grown significantly. Our portion of the AARP's insurance program\n\nrepresents approximately $3.5 billion in annual net premium revenue from\n\napproximately 4 million AARP members. The success of the AARP arrangement will\n\ndepend, in part, on our ability to service these new members, develop additional\n\nproducts and services, price the products and services competitively, and\n\nrespond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes. Additionally,\n\nevents that adversely affect the AARP could have an adverse effect on the\n\nsuccess of our arrangement with the AARP.\n\nMEDICARE OPERATIONS. In the second quarter of 1998, we experienced a\n\nsignificant rise in the medical care ratio for our Medicare operations. The\n\nincrease in medical costs was primarily due to the business growth in new\n\nmarkets with higher and more volatile medical cost trends, coupled with lower\n\nreimbursement rates. In response, we announced in October 1998 our decision to\n\nwithdraw Medicare product offerings from 86 of the 206 counties we currently\n\nserve. The decision, effective January 1, 1999, will affect approximately\n\n60,000, or 13%, of current Medicare members. As a consequence of this\n\nwithdrawal, we are precluded from re-entering these counties with Medicare\n\nproduct offerings until 5 years after the effective date.\n\nWe will continue to offer Medicare products in strong and economically\n\nviable markets. However, our ability to improve the financial results of all of\n\nour Medicare operations will depend on a number of factors, including future\n\npremium increases, growth in markets where we have achieved sufficient size to\n\noperate efficiently, benefit design, provider contracting, and other factors.\n\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully prevent future\n\nlosses on our Medicare operations.\n\nREALIGNMENT OF OPERATIONS. We recognized a charge to earnings in the second\n\nquarter of 1998 for our realignment. In January 1998, we initiated a significant\n\nrealignment of our operations into six business lines. As part of the\n\nrealignment, we began shifting resources and activities to more directly support\n\nthe operations of our businesses. Although we do not expect our realignment\n\nefforts to negatively affect our product offerings, provider relations, billing\n\nand collection disciplines, claims processing and payment\n\n13\n\nactivities, or other business functions, there can be no assurance that such\n\nnegative effects may not occur. Our second quarter charge to earnings for costs\n\nassociated with the realignment was $725 million. Although we believe such\n\ncharges are adequate, there can be no assurance that the costs associated with\n\nour realignment efforts will not exceed the charges we have taken for such\n\ncosts.\n\nGOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND REGULATION. Our business is heavily regulated on a\n\nfederal, state and local level. The laws and rules governing our business and\n\ninterpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. Broad\n\nlatitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations. Existing or\n\nfuture laws and rules could force us to change how we do business, restrict\n\nrevenue and enrollment growth, increase its health care and administrative costs\n\nand capital requirements, and increase our liability for medical malpractice or\n\nother actions. We must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many\n\nof our products. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these\n\napprovals could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our members, or\n\ncould increase our costs. A significant portion of our revenues relate to\n\nfederal, state and local government health care coverage programs. These types\n\nof programs, such as the federal Medicare program and the federal and state\n\nMedicaid programs, generally are subject to frequent change, including changes\n\nthat may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible, reduce the amount of\n\nreimbursement or payment levels, or may reduce or increase our administrative or\n\nhealth care costs under such programs. Such changes have adversely affected our\n\nresults and willingness to participate in such programs in the past and may also\n\ndo so in the future.\n\nThe Company also is subject to various governmental reviews, audits and\n\ninvestigations. Such oversight could result in the loss of licensure or the\n\nright to participate in certain programs, or the imposition of fines, penalties\n\nand other sanctions. In addition, disclosure of any adverse investigation or\n\naudit results or sanctions could damage our reputation in various markets and\n\nmake it more difficult for us to sell our products and services. The National\n\nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners (the \"NAIC\") is expected to adopt rules\n\nwhich, if implemented by the states, will require certain capitalization levels\n\nfor health care coverage provided by insurance companies, HMOs and other risk\n\nbearing health care entities. The requirements would take the form of risk-based\n\ncapital rules. Currently, similar risk-based capital rules apply generally to\n\ninsurance companies. Depending on the nature and extent of the new minimum\n\ncapitalization requirements ultimately implemented, there could be an increase\n\nin the capital required for certain of our subsidiaries and there may be some\n\npotential for disparate treatment of competing products. Federal solvency\n\nregulation of companies providing Medicare-related benefit programs may also be\n\napplied.\n\nPROVIDER RELATIONS. One of the significant techniques we use to manage\n\nhealth care costs and utilization and monitor the quality of care being\n\ndelivered is contracting with physicians, hospitals and other providers. Because\n\nour health plans are geographically diverse and most of those health plans\n\ncontract with a large number of providers, we currently believe our exposure to\n\nprovider relations issues is limited. In any particular market, however,\n\nproviders could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other\n\nactions that could result in higher health care costs, less desirable products\n\nfor customer and members, or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation\n\nrequirements. In some markets, certain providers, particularly hospitals,\n\nphysician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have\n\nsignificant market positions or near monopolies. If these providers refuse to\n\ncontract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts, or\n\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage those activities could adversely affect\n\nour ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas.\n\nLITIGATION AND INSURANCE. We may be a party to a variety of legal actions\n\nthat affect any business, such as employment and employment\n\ndiscrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract\n\nactions, tort claims, shareholder suits, including securities fraud, and\n\nintellectual property related litigation. In addition, because of the nature of\n\nour business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our\n\nbusiness operations. These could include: claims relating to the denial of\n\nhealth care benefits; medical malpractice actions; provider disputes over\n\ncompensation and termination of provider contracts; disputes related to\n\nself-funded business, including actions alleging claim administration errors and\n\nthe failure to disclose network rate discounts and other fee and rebate\n\narrangements; disputes over copayment\n\n14\n\ncalculations; and claims relating to customer audits and contract performance.\n\nRecent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for\n\nany of these types of claims. In some cases, substantial non-economic or\n\npunitive damages may be sought. We currently have insurance coverage for some of\n\nthese potential liabilities. Other potential liabilities may not be covered by\n\ninsurance, insurers may dispute coverage, or the amount of insurance may not be\n\nenough to cover the damages awarded. In addition, certain types of damages, such\n\nas punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance and insurance coverage for\n\nall or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively\n\nexpensive in the future.\n\nINFORMATION SYSTEMS. Our business depends significantly on effective\n\ninformation systems, and we have many different information systems for its\n\nvarious businesses. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of\n\nresources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems in\n\norder to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology,\n\nevolving industry standards, and changing customer preferences. In addition, we\n\nmay from time to time obtain significant portions of our systems-related or\n\nother services or facilities from independent third parties, which may make our\n\noperations vulnerable to such third parties' failure to perform adequately. As a\n\nresult of our acquisition activities, we have acquired additional systems and\n\nhave been taking steps to reduce the number of systems and have upgraded and\n\nexpanded our information systems capabilities. Failure to maintain effective and\n\nefficient information systems could cause loss of existing customers, difficulty\n\nin attracting new customers, customer and provider disputes, regulatory\n\nproblems, increases in administrative expenses or other adverse consequences.\n\nTHE YEAR 2000. We are in the process of modifying our computer systems to\n\naccommodate the Year 2000. We currently expect to complete this modification\n\nenough in advance of the Year 2000 to avoid adverse impacts on our operations.\n\nWe are expensing the costs incurred to make these modifications. Our operations\n\ncould be adversely affected if we were unable to complete our Year 2000\n\nmodifications in a timely manner or if other companies with which we do business\n\nfail to complete their Year 2000 modifications in a timely manner.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE AND MANAGEMENT. Efficient and cost-effective administration\n\nof our operations is essential to our profitability and competitive positioning.\n\nWhile we attempt to effectively manage such expenses, staff-related and other\n\nadministrative expenses may rise from time to time due to business or product\n\nstart-ups or expansions, growth or changes in business, acquisitions, regulatory\n\nrequirements or other reasons. These expense increases are not clearly\n\npredictable and may adversely affect results. We believe we currently have an\n\nexperienced, capable management and technical staff. The market for management\n\nand technical personnel, including information systems professionals, in the\n\nhealth care industry is very competitive. Loss of certain managers or a number\n\nof such managers or technical staff could adversely affect our ability to\n\nadminister and manage our business.\n\nMARKETING. We market our products and services through both employed sales\n\npeople and independent sales agents. Although we have many sales employees and\n\nagents, the departure of certain key sales employees or agents or a large subset\n\nof such individuals could impair our ability to retain existing customers and\n\nmembers. In addition, certain of our customers or potential customers consider\n\nrating, accreditation or certification of the Company by various private or\n\ngovernmental bodies or rating agencies necessary or important. Certain of our\n\nhealth plans or other business units may not have obtained or maintained, or may\n\nnot desire or be able to obtain or maintain, such rating accreditation or\n\ncertification, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain or retain\n\nbusiness with these customers.\n\nACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS. The Company has made several large\n\nacquisitions in recent years and has an active ongoing acquisition and\n\ndisposition program under which it may engage in transactions involving the\n\nacquisition or disposition of assets, products or businesses, some or all of\n\nwhich may be material. These acquisitions may entail certain risks and\n\nuncertainties and may affect ongoing business operations because of unknown\n\nliabilities, unforeseen administrative needs or increased efforts to integrate\n\nthe acquired operations. Failure to identify liabilities, anticipate additional\n\nadministrative needs or\n\n15\n\neffectively integrate acquired operations could result in reduced revenues,\n\nincreased administrative and other costs, or customer confusion or\n\ndissatisfaction.\n\nDATA AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. Many of the products that are part of our\n\nknowledge and information services business depend significantly on the\n\nintegrity of the data on which they are based. If the information contained in\n\nour databases were found or perceived to be inaccurate, or if such information\n\nwere generally perceived to be unreliable, commercial acceptance of our\n\ndatabase-related products would be adversely and materially affected.\n\nFurthermore, the use by our knowledge and information-related business of\n\npatient data is regulated at federal, state, and local levels. These laws and\n\nrules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation.\n\nThese restrictions could adversely affect revenues from these products and, more\n\ngenerally, affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe success of our knowledge and information services business also depends\n\nsignificantly on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our products. We\n\nrely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with\n\nemployees, and our trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our\n\nproprietary rights. We cannot assure that these legal protections and\n\nprecautions will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In\n\naddition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists\n\nin the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly\n\nsubject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and\n\ncompetitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation could have an\n\nadverse affect on the ability of our knowledge and information-related business\n\nto market and sell its products and on our business, financial condition and\n\nresults of operations.\n\nSTOCK MARKET. The market prices of the securities of the Company and\n\ncertain of the publicly-held companies in the industry in which we operate have\n\nshown volatility and sensitivity in response to many factors, including general\n\nmarket trends, public communications regarding managed care, legislative or\n\nregulatory actions health care cost trends, pricing trends, competition,\n\nearnings or membership reports of particular industry participants, and\n\nacquisition activity. We cannot assure the level or stability of our share price\n\nat any time, or the impact of the foregoing or any other factors may have on our\n\nshare price.\n\n16\n\nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT\n\nFIRST ELECTED AS\n\nNAME AGE POSITION AT 12/31/98 EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\n- -------------------------------- --- -------------------------------------------------------- -----------------\n\nPresident, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and\n\nWilliam W.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nBecause of the nature of its business, United is subject to suits relating\n\nto the failure to provide or pay for health care or other benefits, poor\n\noutcomes for care delivered or arranged under United's programs, nonacceptance\n\nor termination of providers, failure to return withheld amounts from provider\n\ncompensation, failure of a self-funded plan serviced by United to pay benefits,\n\nimproper copayment calculations and other forms of legal actions. Some of these\n\nsuits may include claims for substantial non-economic or punitive damages.\n\nUnited does not believe that any such actions, or any other types of actions,\n\ncurrently threatened or pending will, individually or in the aggregate, have a\n\nmaterial adverse effect on United's financial position or results of operations.\n\nHowever, the likelihood or outcome of current or future suits cannot be\n\naccurately predicted, and they could adversely affect United's financial\n\nresults.\n\nSix suits assert claims under the United States securities laws against\n\nUnited and certain of its current and former officers and directors. The\n\nplaintiffs are stockholders of United who purport to sue on behalf of a class of\n\npurchasers of common shares of United during the period February 12, 1998\n\nthrough August 5, 1998 (the \"Class Period\"). Each complaint was filed in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Minnesota. Each of the six\n\nactions claims violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange\n\nAct and SEC Rule 10b-5. In substance, the complaints allege that United made\n\nmaterially false or misleading statements about the profitability and\n\nperformance of the Company's Medicare business during the Class Period. Two of\n\nthe complaints also allege that the Company made materially false statements\n\nabout its medical costs and the expenses related to the Company's realignment.\n\nThe complaints also allege that the statements were made with the intention of\n\ndeceiving members of the investing public and with the intention that the price\n\nof United shares would rise, making it possible for insiders at the Company to\n\nprofit by selling shares at a time when they knew the Company's true financial\n\ncondition, but the investing public did not. The complaints allege that once the\n\nCompany's true financial condition was revealed on August 6, 1998, the price of\n\nUnited common shares fell from a closing price of $52 7/8 on August 5, 1998, to\n\na closing price of $37 7/8 on August 6, 1998. The complaints seek compensatory\n\ndamages in unspecified amounts.\n\nOn January 19, 1999, we received a consolidated amended complaint (IN RE\n\nUNITED HEALTHCARE CORPORATION SECURITIES LITIGATION, No. 98-1888 in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Minnesota) for the six suits which\n\nessentially restates the allegations made in the earlier complaints.\n\nOn March 22, 1999, two actions were filed in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Minnesota by two pension funds against United, certain\n\ncurrent and former officers and directors, and other individuals yet to be\n\nidentified. The pension funds wish to \"opt-out\" of the aforementioned purported\n\nclass action suits. These individual actions essentially restate the allegations\n\nmade in the purported class actions and claim violations of Sections 10(b),\n\n18(a) and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act. In addition, both actions assert a\n\nclaim of negligent misrepresentation and securities claims under state law. In\n\nthe aggregate, the plaintiff pension funds seek compensatory damages totaling\n\napproximately $12.1 million.\n\nThe defendants intend to defend these actions vigorously.\n\nITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\n\nOF OPERATION\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n1998 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS\n\n1998 was an important year of both challenges and successes for UnitedHealth\n\nGroup.\n\n- - Excluding the effects of the unusual or nonrecurring events and transactions\n\ndescribed below, we achieved record profits. Underlying earnings from\n\noperations, net earnings applicable to common shareholders, and diluted net\n\nearnings per common share were $858 million, $509 million and $2.62 per share,\n\nrespectively, representing increases over 1997 of 16%, 18%, and 16%,\n\nrespectively.\n\n- - We achieved record revenues of $17.4 billion, a 47% increase over 1997. This\n\ngrowth was driven primarily by same-store enrollment growth in our\n\nUnitedHealthcare business and from successful implementation of our $3.5\n\nbillion Medicare supplement insurance program with the AARP.\n\n- - Record cash flows of more than $1.0 billion were generated from operating\n\nactivities, a 57% increase over 1997.\n\n- - We completed several financing initiatives to achieve a more efficient\n\ncapital structure, including the redemption of our $500 million convertible\n\npreferred stock and the repurchase of 11.3 million shares of our common stock.\n\n- - We embarked on a major realignment of our operations into independent but\n\nstrategically linked businesses, each focused on performance, growth and\n\nshareholder value. As a result of our evaluation of each business's strategic\n\nfit and contributions, analysis of our profitability in certain markets, and\n\nthe adequacy of our medical costs payable estimates, we took actions that\n\nresulted in special operating charges of $900 million.\n\n1998 OPERATING RESULTS OVERVIEW\n\nThe following table summarizes our results for each of the last three years\n\nended December 31 (in millions, except per share amounts).\n\n1998(1) 1997 1996(2)\n\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEarnings (Loss) From Operations $ (42) $ 742 $ 581\n\nNet Earnings (Loss) Applicable to\n\nCommon Shareholders $ (214) $ 431 $ 327\n\nDiluted Net Earnings (Loss) per\n\nCommon Share $(1.12) $2.26 $1.76\n\nMedical Costs to Premium Revenues 87.2%(3) 84.3% 84.6%\n\nSG&A Expenses to Total Revenues 17.1% 20.0% 21.5%\n\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(1) Excluding the effects of $725 million of operational realignment and other\n\ncharges, $175 million of charges related to contract losses associated with\n\ncertain Medicare markets and other increases to commercial and Medicare medical\n\ncosts payable estimates, and the $20 million convertible preferred stock\n\nredemption premium, earnings from operations, net earnings applicable to common\n\nshareholders, and diluted net earnings per common share would have been $858\n\nmillion, $509 million, and $2.62 per share, respectively.\n\n(2) Excluding the effects of a $45 million provision for future losses on two\n\nlarge multi-year contracts and $15 million of merger costs associated with the\n\nacquisition of HealthWise of America, Inc., earnings from operations, net\n\nearnings applicable to common shareholders, and diluted net earnings per common\n\nshare would have been $641 million, $392 million, and $1.96 per share,\n\nrespectively.\n\n(3)Includes $175 million of contract losses associated with certain Medicare\n\nmarkets and other increases to commercial and Medicare medical costs payable\n\nestimates. The company's ratio of medical costs to premium revenues for the\n\nyear ended December 31, 1998, would have been 86.0% without these charges.\n\nIn 1998, we reported a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $214\n\nmillion, or $1.12 diluted net loss per common share. However, these results\n\ninclude certain large or unusual events and transactions as described below:\n\n- - In conjunction with our realignment and other initiatives, we recorded $725\n\nmillion of charges to operations during the second quarter of 1998. The charges\n\nincluded $451 million of asset impairments and $274 million of estimated future\n\ncosts associated with our initiatives, such as employee terminations; disposing\n\nof or discontinuing business units, product lines and contracts; and\n\nconsolidating certain processing operations and associated real estate\n\nobligations. Although our realignment initiatives and the associated\n\nnonrecurring charges caused us to report a net loss for 1998, these actions\n\nposition us to make long-term fundamental process and performance improvements.\n\n- - Our second quarter 1998 medical costs include $120 million related to\n\ncontract losses and other increases to medical costs payable estimates in\n\nUnitedHealthcare's Medicare markets and $55 million related to increases to\n\nmedical costs payable estimates associated with increased commercial medical\n\ncosts in certain health plans.\n\n- - In conjunction with the redemption of our $500 million convertible preferred\n\nstock, we paid a $20 million redemption premium. This premium is added to\n\n1998's net loss to arrive at net loss applicable to common shareholders.\n\nExcluding the effects of the events and transactions described above,\n\n1998 underlying earnings from operations and diluted net earnings per common\n\nshare were $858 million and $2.62 per share, respectively, representing\n\nincreases of 16% over earnings from operations of $742 million and diluted net\n\nearnings per common share of $2.26 in 1997. These increases were primarily\n\ndriven by improved margins in the commercial product offerings of our\n\nUnitedHealthcare business and successful integration and management of our\n\nservices provided to the AARP, which began on January 1, 1998.\n\nThe discussion that follows provides a more detailed analysis of our\n\n1998, 1997 and 1996 operating results.\n\nII-3\n\n1998 RESULTS COMPARED TO 1997 RESULTS\n\nREVENUES AND ENROLLMENT\n\n1998 was a record year for UnitedHealth Group, with consolidated revenues of\n\n$17.4 billion, an increase of $5.6 billion, or 47%, over 1997. Our revenue\n\ngrowth was primarily derived from successful implementation of our $3.5\n\nbillion Medicare supplement insurance program with the AARP and same-store\n\nenrollment growth in our UnitedHealthcare business. On a year-over-year\n\nsame-store basis, UnitedHealthcare's total revenues increased by $1.7\n\nbillion, or 16%, over 1997.\n\nThe following table summarizes enrollment in all of our product\n\nofferings as of December 31:\n\nENROLLMENT SUMMARY(1)\n\n1998 1997 1996\n\n----------------------------- ----------------------------- -------\n\nAmount Increase (Decrease) Amount Increase (Decrease) Amount\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnrollment, excluding Ovations\n\n(as of December 31, in thousands)\n\nUnitedHealthcare\n\nRisk-Based:\n\nHealth Plans 5,231 17% 4,475 13% 3,945\n\nOther Network-Based and Indemnity 530 (14%) 613 (29%) 858\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTotal Commercial 5,761 13% 5,088 6% 4,803\n\nMedicare 483 40% 345 54% 224\n\nMedicaid 638 21% 526 0% 525\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTotal Risk-Based 6,882 15% 5,959 7% 5,552\n\nFee-Based:\n\nCommercial 1,725 7% 1,609 (29%) 2,279\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTotal UnitedHealthcare 8,607 14% 7,568 (3%) 7,831\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUniprise\n\nRisk-Based 261 (1%) 263 (9%) 288\n\nFee-Based 5,139 (2%) 5,226 (8%) 5,653\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTotal Uniprise 5,400 (2%) 5,489 (8%) 5,941\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTotal Enrollment, excluding\n\nOvations 14,007 7% 13,057 (5%) 13,772\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(1) Enrollment information includes growth resulting from our 1998\n\nacquisition of HealthPartners of Arizona, Inc. (509,000 members).\n\nAdditionally, the fee-based lives served by United HealthCare Administrators,\n\nInc. are included in 1996 (666,000 members). We sold United HealthCare\n\nAdministrators, Inc. on June 30, 1997.\n\nOur revenues are comprised of: 1) premium revenues associated with our\n\nrisk-based products (those where we assume financial responsibility for\n\nhealth care costs); 2) management services and fees associated with\n\nadministrative services only customers, managed health plans, and our\n\nSpecialized Care Services and Ingenix businesses; and 3) investment and other\n\nincome.\n\nThe discussion that follows provides an analysis of our 1998 revenue\n\ntrends for each of our three revenue components.\n\nPREMIUM REVENUES\n\nThe following table summarizes premium revenues by business unit for the\n\nyears ended December 31 (in millions):\n\nPercent\n\nIncrease\n\n1998 1997 (Decrease)\n\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnitedHealthcare $11,397 $ 9,507 20%\n\nOvations 3,584 87 NM\n\nUniprise 447 418 7%\n\nSpecialized Care Services 337 291 16%\n\nElimination of Inter-Unit\n\nTransactions (249) (168) NM\n\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n$15,516 $10,135 53%\n\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNM - Not Meaningful\n\nConsolidated premium revenues in 1998 totaled $15.5 billion, an increase\n\nof $5.4 billion, or 53%, compared to 1997. On January 1, 1998, our Ovations\n\nbusiness began delivering Medicare supplement insurance and other medical\n\ninsurance coverage to approximately 4 million AARP members. Premium revenues\n\nfrom our portion of the AARP insurance offerings during 1998 were $3.5\n\nbillion.\n\nExcluding the AARP business, 1998 consolidated premium revenues totaled\n\n$12.0 billion, an increase of 19% over 1997. This increase is primarily the\n\nresult of growth in our UnitedHealthcare business. On a year-over-year\n\nsame-store basis, UnitedHealthcare's premium revenues increased $1.7 billion,\n\nor 18%, during 1998. The increase reflects same-store commercial health plan\n\nenrollment growth of 10% and average year-over-year premium yield increases\n\non renewing commercial health plan groups of approximately 5% to 6%.\n\nGrowth in UnitedHealthcare's Medicare programs also contributed to the\n\nincrease in premium revenues, with same-store growth of 33% in Medicare\n\nenrollment. Significant growth in Medicare enrollment affects year-over-year\n\ncomparability. The Medicare product generally has per member premium rates\n\nthree times to four times higher than average commercial premium rates\n\nbecause Medicare members typically use proportionately more medical care\n\nservices. On a year-over-year same-\n\nII-4\n\nstore basis, UnitedHealthcare's commercial health plan and Medicare products\n\naccounted for $1.8 billion of premium revenue growth during 1998.\n\nThe increase in UnitedHealthcare's commercial health plan and Medicare\n\nproduct premium revenues was partially offset by a $240 million decrease from\n\nother network-based and indemnity products. We expect enrollment in\n\nUnitedHealthcare's other network-based and indemnity products will continue\n\nto decline through 1999. To the extent possible, we will convert these\n\nenrollees to UnitedHealthcare's commercial health plan products.\n\nMANAGEMENT SERVICES AND FEE REVENUES\n\nManagement services and fee revenues during 1998 totaled $1.6 billion,\n\nrepresenting an increase of approximately $160 million over 1997. The\n\nincrease is primarily the result of acquisitions by Ingenix during 1997 and\n\n1998. Additionally, our Specialized Care Services business -- most notably\n\nUnited Behavioral Health and Optum,-Registered Trademark- our telephone- and\n\nInternet-based health information and services business -- continues to\n\nincrease the number of individuals it serves.\n\nINVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME\n\nInvestment and other income increased to $249 million in 1998 from $231 million\n\nin 1997. The increase of $18 million is primarily attributable to an increase in\n\naverage cash and investments from $3.6 billion in 1997 to $4.1 billion in 1998.\n\nNet capital gains were $26 million in both 1998 and 1997.\n\nMEDICAL COSTS\n\nThe combination of our pricing strategy and medical management efforts is\n\nreflected in the medical care ratio (medical costs as a percentage of premium\n\nrevenues). The following table summarizes our medical care ratio by product line\n\nfor the years ended December 31:\n\n1998 1997\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnitedHealthcare:\n\nCommercial(1) 85.3% 85.7%\n\nMedicare 92.0% 83.3%\n\nMedicaid 85.2% 82.8%\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTotal UnitedHealthcare 86.7% 85.1%\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConsolidated UnitedHealth Group 87.2% 84.3%\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConsolidated (excluding AARP) 85.8% 84.3%\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(1) Includes commercial health plan, other network-based and indemnity products.\n\nOur consolidated medical care ratio increased to 87.2% in 1998 from\n\n84.3% in 1997. The year-over-year increase includes the effects of the AARP\n\nbusiness on our medical care ratio. We experience a medical care ratio of\n\napproximately 92% related to our portion of the AARP insurance offerings,\n\nwhich we began delivering on January 1, 1998. Excluding the AARP business, on\n\na year-over-year basis, the medical care ratio increased to 85.8%.\n\nThe increase in the 1998 medical care ratio is primarily attributable to\n\naverage Medicare premium rate increases of 2.5% that were more than offset by\n\nincreased medical utilization, reflected mostly in hospital costs. In 13 of\n\nour 24 Medicare markets, representing half of our annual Medicare premiums of\n\n$2.4 billion, we incurred contract losses of $111 million. Six of these 13\n\nmarkets are generally newer markets where we have been unable to achieve the\n\nscale of operations necessary to achieve profitability. In numerous counties\n\nin the other seven markets, we experienced high medical costs which exceeded\n\nthe fixed Medicare premiums that increased only 2.5% on average.\n\nWe are addressing our Medicare medical care ratio by altering benefit\n\ndesigns, recontracting with providers, and aggressively increasing both\n\ncontemporaneous and retrospective claim management activities. We also are\n\ncontinuing to evaluate the markets we serve and products we offer. In\n\naddition, we will curtail activities or exit markets where we believe near\n\nterm prospects are unacceptable.\n\nTo that end, in October 1998, we announced our decision to withdraw\n\nMedicare product offerings from 86 of the 206 counties we then served. The\n\ndecision, effective January 1, 1999, affected approximately 60,000, or 13%,\n\nof our Medicare members. We will continue to offer Medicare products in\n\nstrong and economically viable markets. Annual revenues for 1998 from\n\nMedicare counties we exited were approximately $225 million.\n\nDespite increasing commercial medical cost trends "
