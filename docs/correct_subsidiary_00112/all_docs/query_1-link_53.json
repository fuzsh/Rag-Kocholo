        "text": "The relatively recent concept of medical travel may not be new to Mexico, before 1986 many Mexican affluent patients were traveling across international borders to obtain high quality private health care at several destinations like Rochester, New York and the Texas Medical Center, in Houston, TX and most insurance companies in Mexico included in their health plans international coverage for an additional cost.\n\nA then growing private health organization in the U.S. opened the Humana Hospital in Mexico City aimed to provide healthcare to those recurring patients from Mexico in their own country and benefit from this potential market.\n\nAfter a brief period of operations, on December 10, 1986 Mexican entrepreneur Olegario Vazquez RaÃ±a acquired the Humana Hospital and the first Hospital Angeles was born. Located south of Mexico City, Hospital Angeles Pedregal grouped most recognized physicians and advanced technology.\n\nWithin the next decade, with Dr. Roberto SimÃ³n as CEO, Grupo Angeles Health Services continued to grow and established 8 more hospitals in Mexico City and other 6 cities in the country including QuerÃ©taro and Guadalajara. In 2006 Angeles Group, celebrated their 20 Th anniversary with 20 hospitals in 12 cities.\n\nToday with recent openings in Tampico and Xalapa, Hospital Angeles has reached an unparalleled number for the region: 23 hospitals in 14 cities most of them currently in the process of certification with the Joint Commission International.\n\nWith significant investment in infrastructure and high end health technology, Hospitales Angeles has become the first privately owned chain of hospitals in Latin America to offer world class health services nationwide.\n\nAngeles Hospitals in Numbers:\n\n23 Hospitals across Mexico\n\nâ\n\n1,700 beds\n\nâ\n\n11,000 board certified specialists\n\nâ\n\n120,000 hospitalized patients a year\n\nâ\n\nMore than 6,000,000 million outpatient visits a year\n\nâ\n\nIn order to provide better administrative support Grupo Angeles Servicios de Salud (Angeles Group Health Services) is the management entity for Hospitales Angeles and has also paid attention to other areas of healthcare:\n\nAngeles Care: provides nursing services and home care equipment\n\nâ\n\nBiomÃ©dicos: clinical labs and imaging\n\nâ\n\nCentros de DiagnÃ³stico Angeles (Angeles Diagnostic Centers): contact clinics and Hemodyalisis centers.\n\nâ\n\nAngeles en LÃ­nea, (Angeles Online): strategic communication and patient education.\n\nâ\n\nAngeles Pharmacy: 16 locations in Mexico.\n\nMedical Tourism ~ Health Without Borders\n\nHospitales Angeles soon became a medical travel destination.
