To enroll, AVPs are required to complete an MVA approved online application that requires specific information. During this process a validation of their professional licensing status is verified against the MDH. Once approved, AVPs can access the Online Vision Certification Service. Authorized Vision Providers may be recog​nized by the \"MVA Authorized Online Vision Certification Provider Decal\" displayed on their business window or door.\n\nClick here to find the listing of Authorized Online Vision Certification Providers\n\n​\n\nThe service allows Authorized Online Vision Certification Providers to submit a vision patient's exam results electronically to the MVA. It is managed using a secure web based application, which looks very similar to the MVA's paper vision certification completed today.\n\nThe vision patient is required to show their MD driver's license or ID card to the vision provider. The provider will enter the LIC# or ID# and Birth Date from the card to ensure that results are applied to the individual's motor vehicle record. Vision results are valid for 24 months from the vision examination date.\n\nOnce the results are submitted to the MVA, eligible customers can then renew their license through MVA's website or self service kiosk. For renewal option information Renewing Your Maryland Driver's License. For additional information you may also want to view the Frequently Asked Questions.​"
