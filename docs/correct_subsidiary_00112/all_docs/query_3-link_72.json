        "text": "It seems you are interested to know everything about Medical Coding. Your ask is justified since Medical Coding as a career prospect is experiencing a growing demand. Therefore, this article covering the Medical Coding course qualification, eligibility, and fees is just the right place to start.\n\nBut what is Medical Coding?\n\nInterestingly, Medical Coding is in no way related to the coding done by IT programmers. Instead, Medical Coders transform the medical information of patients into universally standard alphanumeric codes. The information is gathered from physician notes, lap reports etc. every time the patient visits a healthcare facility.\n\nThis standardized information is then used by doctors for further treatment and diagnosis. Health insurance companies also use this information for verifying insurance claims by patients. Even governments refer to this coded information for drafting appropriate health policies.\n\nIn summary, Medical Coding is instrumental in offering a satisfactory experience to patients. This explains the burgeoning demand for Medical Coders. In India, Medical Coding is particularly witnessing growing popularity as the country ranks 10th in the Medical Tourism Index (MTI) in 2020–21 out of 46 destinations in the world.\n\nSo, let us now do a deep dive into the Medical Coding course to know all about its qualification, eligibility, and course fees.\n\nTo start with, just to be sure that the Medical Coding course is indeed the right choice for you, it is important to know what Medical Coders do.\n\nJob Description of Medical Coders\n\nAlthough Medical Coders are primarily responsible for applying standard codes to patients’ medical information, they do much more. Here’s a summary of their roles and responsibilities:\n\nEnsure compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements wrt to coding procedures and practices\n\nConduct reviews and audits to ensure that all documentation is accurate\n\nLiaise with insurance companies to resolve claim disputes\n\nCollaborate with the billing department to ensure all billing disputes are timely settled\n\nProvide statistical data to other departments to aid research and analysis\n\nSupport doctors and other healthcare professionals by providing necessary information regarding diagnosis, medical tests, and lab results\n\nMedical Coders execute these responsibilities from:\n\nPrivate or public hospitals\n\nNursing homes\n\nHealthcare centers\n\nRehabilitation centers\n\nInsurance companies\n\nIf the above sounds interesting, let us now proceed to know about the Medical Coding course qualification.\n\nMedical Coding Course Qualification\n\nIf you are interested to enrol on a Medical Coding course, you must possess a Graduate/Post Graduate degree in any discipline, scoring a minimum of 50% from any recognized University/Board.

Let’s examine the skills that form part of the Medical Coding course qualification.\n\nAs a Medical Coder, you will be working on various tools and applications to record and retrieve patient information with precision. Therefore, you must be computer literate. Specifically, proficiency with word processing and any spreadsheet software comes in handy along with a good typing speed. Your ease in working with computers also proves helpful when you have to acclimatize to a wide range of software applications because different healthcare facilities use different tools. In a nutshell, you must be able to adapt to changing technology.\n\nApart from the Medical Coding course qualification, there are some soft skills you must possess to become a successful Medical Coder. These are listed below:\n\nCommunication skills to liaise effectively with doctors, billing department, and insurance companies\n\nActive listening skills to help patients when they raise concerns related to billing or insurance\n\nProblem-solving skills to amicably resolve billing and insurance disputes raised by patients\n\nAttention to detail while assigning codes to patient’s information and reviewing the same to ensure accuracy\n\nWork independently as well as collaboratively with other departments, doctors, and insurance companies, as and when needed\n\nIn synopsis, once you possess the education qualification and skillset listed above, you fulfil the eligibility criteria for enrolling in a Medical Coding course.\n\nNow that you have the necessary information about the prerequisites for joining a Medical Coding course, let us come to the most important point — how much does it cost?\n\nMedical Coding Course Fees\n\nJust as for any other course, the Medical Coding course fees vary with the nature of the course and the training provider. For example, if you just opt for the training, the fees will be less than when you want a certificate at the end of the training course.\n\nIt is noted across the industry that the Medical Coding course fees in India for candidates who have AAPC (American Association of Professional Coders) membership averages between INR 30000/- to 40000/-. On the contrary, for non-AAPC membership candidates, the Medical Coding course fees range between INR 35000/- to 45000/-.\n\nSo, you now possess the basic information about the Medical Coding course qualification, eligibility criteria, and course fees.
