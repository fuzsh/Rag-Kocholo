        "text": "The Associate in Applied Science degree in Diagnostic Medical Sonography (AAS) program is designed to prepare individuals to enter the diagnostic medical sonography profession upon graduation. This degree is a seven-semester full-time day program that provides both theoretical and clinical instruction in sonography at JJC's Main Campus, and at hospitals and other health care organizations in the surrounding area. Up to 20 students are accepted into the program every fall. Most classes are offered face-to-face with the exception of two online courses (DMS 113 and DMS 120).\n\nDiagnostic medical sonographers are highly skilled professionals who provide patient services using diagnostic techniques under the supervision of a licensed doctor of medicine. Diagnostic medical sonographers use specialized equipment to create images of structures inside the human body and perform a variety of diagnostic sonographic examinations of the abdomen, pelvis, small parts, pregnancy, superficial structures, vascular studies and other procedures. Diagnostic medical sonographers assist physicians in collecting patient diagnosis data necessary to reach diagnostic decisions. This profession requires the sonographer to use critical judgment and the ability to provide appropriate health care services.\n\nThe Diagnostic Medical Imaging Sonography Program at Joliet Junior College is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs upon recommendation of the Joint Review Committee on Education in Diagnostic Medical Sonography (JRC-DMS).\n\nFor information about the eligibility to sit for the ARDMS examinations please visit: ARDMS and ARDMS Prerequisites.\n\nNOTE: Diagnostic Medical Sonography students of the AAS program must achieve a minimum grade of \"C\" in each of the Diagnostic Medical Sonography courses and all of the general education courses before they are eligible for graduation.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe online Diagnostic Medical Sonography application for the AAS degree program is available each February for the opportunity to begin the program the following fall semester. If a student is not admitted to the program or chooses to defer acceptance, the student will need to re-apply the following year.
