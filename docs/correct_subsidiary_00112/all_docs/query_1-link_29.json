        "text": "Verify Education, Experience or Training\n\nVerify Academic Education from a NAACLS, CAAHEP, or ABHES Accredited Program\n\nThe education received from a NAACLS, CAAHEP, or ABHES accredited program is acceptable for five years from the date of completion of that program.\n\nVerification of program completion versus academic requirements\n\nThe program director will electronically verify a student’s successful completion of all program requirements before the applicant is provided information about how to schedule an examination.\n\nIn addition, it is the applicant’s responsibility to ensure that an official transcript is submitted to the ASCP BOC to verify that all education requirements have been met. See sections titled “Official Transcript Requirements” and “Submitting Official Transcripts” for complete information.\n\nPlease note that applicants for HT, Route 1, do not need to submit any transcripts to the ASCP BOC.\n\nApplicants from NAACLS accredited programs outside of the United States should contact their program director for the appropriate documentation for verification of your degree.\n\nApplication process for program graduates\n\nAll education requirements must be completed before sitting for the examination. You may schedule and sit for the examination one time before an official transcript has been received and processed by the ASCP BOC.\n\nIf you do not appear for your scheduled exam date, or fail the examination, your official transcript, verifying completion of high school graduation, college coursework, and/or degree conferral, must be received and processed by the ASCP BOC in order for you to schedule another examination date.\n\nIf you pass the examination, an official transcript must be submitted to the ASCP BOC in order for you to become certified.\n\nImportant: You will not have access to your examination score, and are not certified, until an official transcript is received and processed. If your official transcript is not fully processed within one year of your examination date, your score will be invalidated. To become certified, you will need to reapply, submit a new application and fee, and pass the certification examination.\n\nSpecific Coursework Requirements\n\nThe courses completed as part of your accredited program will be counted towards any chemistry and biology coursework requirements.\n\n100 level or above courses will count towards the required college course work.\n\nA passing grade, which results in credit being earned, is necessary for coursework to count towards the meeting of academic requirements.\n\nThe use of “Pass” on an official transcript can be used in lieu of a passing grade, provided the quarter or semester hour credits assigned to the course are also indicated.\n\nIf eligibility requirements specify that coursework and/or a degree must be completed at an Accredited College/University, click below for complete information.\n\nAccredited Colleges and Universities\n\nHelpful Tips\n\nOnly send transcripts that are necessary to verify the academic requirements have been met. If needed, multiple transcripts may be submitted to verify that all academic requirements have been met.\n\nAll academic requirements are a minimum requirement, so a higher degree can be used to verify eligibility. For example, if high school graduation is required, an Associate’s degree would meet that requirement. If a baccalaureate degree is required, a Master’s degree or Doctorate would meet that minimum requirement.\n\nVerify Academic Education for PBT, MLA, and QDP applicants\n\nAn applicant must be able to verify that they meet all eligibility requirements, including proof of high school graduation or equivalent.\n\nOfficial transcript(s) must be sent directly from your academic institution (high school, State Department of Education, etc.) to the ASCP BOC.\n\nOR an acceptable foreign transcript evaluation (required for education outside of the U.S. or Canada) must be sent to the ASCP BOC.\n\nPlease note:\n\n- Acceptance into a program or institution does not verify high school graduation or equivalency.\n\n- College coursework, without a degree conferred, does not verify high school graduation or equivalency.\n\nIn summary, an official transcript requires:\n\nDate degree was conferred (if required)\n\nSeal of academic institution\n\nSignature of Registrar\n\nHelpful Tips\n\nOnly send transcripts that are necessary to verify the academic requirements have been met. If needed, multiple transcripts may be submitted to verify that all academic requirements have been met.\n\nAll academic requirements are a minimum requirement, so a higher degree can be used to verify eligibility. For example, if high school graduation is required, an Associate’s degree would meet that requirement. If a baccalaureate degree is required, a Master’s degree or Doctorate would meet that minimum requirement.\n\nSee sections titled “Official Transcript Requirements” and “Submitting Official Transcripts” for complete information.\n\nNAACLS accredited PBT and MLA program graduates\n\nStudents who have completed a NAACLS accredited PBT or MLA program are able to sit for the exam one time before an official transcript has been received in the ASCP BOC office. However, it is important to note that you will not have access to your exam score, and are not certified, until your official transcript has been received and processed by the BOC office.\n\nVerify Academic Education from an Accredited College/University within the United States and Canada\n\nIf high school graduation, college credits, and/or a degree are required to establish eligibility to sit for an exam, you must submit an official transcript to the ASCP BOC to verify completion of these requirements. See sections titled “Official Transcript Requirements” and “Submitting Official Transcripts” for complete information.\n\nSpecific Coursework Requirements\n\nIf the eligibility requirements state courses are required in biology and chemistry, the courses listed on the official transcript must be in the biology and chemistry departments. This allows those courses with unfamiliar names to be identified as acceptable. Courses which the applicant feels should be considered as biological science or chemistry may be acceptable if the applicant submits proof.\n\n100 level or above courses will count towards the required college course work.\n\nA passing grade, which results in credit being earned, is necessary for coursework to count towards the meeting of academic requirements.\n\nThe use of “Pass” on an official transcript can be used in lieu of a passing grade, provided the quarter or semester hour credits assigned to the course are also indicated.\n\nIf eligibility requirements specify that coursework and/or a degree must be completed at an accredited college/university, click below for complete information.\n\nPlease note that Continuing Education courses are not acceptable for fulfilling academic requirements.\n\nAccredited Colleges and Universities\n\nEducation or Training in Canada\n\nA three-year baccalaureate degree from a Canadian University is not acceptable for technologist/scientist level examinations or higher. A baccalaureate degree equivalent to a U.S. four-year baccalaureate degree is required.\n\nApplicants who have completed their education in Quebec must submit original transcripts verifying completion of a CEGEP / DEC program as well as college credits and/or degree requirements. Otherwise, a foreign transcript evaluation must be submitted.\n\nCanadians applying for a Medical Laboratory Scientist (MLS) or Cytotechnologist (CT) certification examination must have completed a CMA accredited Medical Laboratory Technology training program.\n\nThe ASCP BOC reserves the right to request a foreign transcript evaluation from any applicant with education outside of the U.S.\n\nHelpful Tips\n\nOnly send transcripts that are necessary to verify the academic requirements have been met. If needed, multiple transcripts may be submitted to verify that all academic requirements have been met.\n\nAll academic requirements are a minimum requirement, so a higher degree can be used to verify eligibility. For example, if high school graduation is required, an Associate’s degree would meet that requirement. If a baccalaureate degree is required, a Master’s degree or Doctorate would meet that minimum requirement.\n\nVerify Academic Education from an Accredited College/University outside of the United States and Canada\n\nIf high school graduation, college credits, and/or a degree, obtained outside of the United States or Canada, are required to establish eligibility to sit for an exam, you must have these academics evaluated by an acceptable evaluation agency for foreign transcripts.\n\nThe foreign transcript evaluation must:\n\nbe completed by an acceptable transcript evaluation agency (see link below).\n\nbe sent directly from the acceptable foreign transcript evaluation agency to the ASCP BOC.\n\nshow a U.S. educational equivalency statement.\n\ncontain a course by course breakdown.\n\nbe an original or certified copy* of the transcript evaluation.\n\n*A certified copy is a photocopy of the original transcript evaluation, stamped and signed by the evaluation agency.\n\nImportant notes:\n\n- A foreign degree must be equivalent to a U.S. degree.\n\n- All foreign transcript evaluations are subject to audit.\n\n- The ASCP BOC reserves the right to request a foreign transcript evaluation from any applicant with education outside of the U.S.\n\nFor more information on how to complete your transcript evaluation, please contact one of the acceptable evaluation agencies for foreign transcripts.\n\nAcceptable Evaluation Agencies for Foreign Transcripts\n\nSubmitting Foreign Transcript Evaluations to the ASCP BOC\n\nTranscript evaluations for all ASCP categories should be sent to Transcripts.boc@ascp.org.\n\nTranscript evaluations for all ASCPi categories should be sent to ascpinternational@ascp.org.\n\nOnly if you are unable to submit your foreign transcript evaluation electronically, have it mailed to the address below. Do not send items through the mail if you have already submitted them electronically as this will slow the processing of all applications. Allow for an additional 2 weeks for processing of all foreign transcript evaluations submitted by mail.\n\nASCP BOC\n\nAttn: Jackie Sanders\n\n33 W. Monroe St, Suite 1600\n\nChicago, IL 60603\n\nAll documents are processed by the ASCP BOC office in the order received.\n\nOfficial Transcript Requirements\n\nIf high school graduation, college credits, and/or a degree are required to meet the eligibility requirements, you must request that an official transcript be sent to the ASCP BOC.\n\nOfficial transcript(s) must be sent directly from your academic institution or a third-party vendor, such as Parchment or National Student Clearinghouse, and require:\n\nDate degree was conferred (if required)\n\nSeal of academic institution\n\nSignature of Registrar\n\nForeign Transcript Evaluation\n\nApplicants who have completed education outside of the United States or Canada must have their academics evaluated by an acceptable evaluation agency for foreign transcripts.
