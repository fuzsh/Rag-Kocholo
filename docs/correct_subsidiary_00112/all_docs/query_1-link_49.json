Participation by patients and primary caregivers in this MMICP is voluntary.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Environmental Health Division assists qualified patients and their primary caregivers with processing applications within the County of Los Angeles.\n\nQualified patients are exempted from state sales tax if they present a valid Medical Marijuana Identification Card issued by CDPH at the time of retail medical cannabis products purchase."
