        "text": "Travel Medical Insurance protects you in the event of an illness or injury when traveling outside of your country of residence.

Check out IMG’s Why You Need Travel Medical Insurance Now More Than Ever to learn more about some of these challenges.\n\nTraveling unprotected can leave you vulnerable to paying high out-of-pocket medical expenses, and navigating a foreign health care system without the assistance you need.\n\nHowever, with a travel medical insurance plan, you can worry less and experience more knowing you have medical coverage and a trusted health advisor who can support you in your time of need.\n\nGet even more information by checking out our article, “Do I Need Travel Medical Insurance?”\n\nHow Much Does Travel Medical Insurance Cost?\n\nLess than $3 per day for an average plan.\n\nLike other travelers, you may be wondering if the coverage is worth the cost. It may surprise you to learn that IMG’s travel medical plans can cost less than $3 per day (based on an average plan) and can provide coverage worth well beyond your initial cost. Pick a plan and get protected.\n\nFactors that Determine Cost\n\nThe cost of a plan varies based on many factors including:\n\nAge of Traveler\n\nAge is one of the primary factors that determines insurance rates. Each IMG plan has a complete breakdown of insurance rates based on ages that can be found in the plan brochure.\n\nDestination\n\nMedical expenses vary around the world. To provide the best balance of coverage and cost, plan coverage rates may be different for a traveler visiting the United States than they are for a traveler in a destination where healthcare is less expensive.\n\nDuration of Trip\n\nA breakdown of daily rates and monthly rates can be found in IMG plan brochures. If you need long-term coverage (1 year or more), view our international health insurance plans.\n\nDeductible, Maximum Limit, & Additional Optional Coverage\n\nCustomize your plan by choosing the deductible amount, maximum limit, and any optional rider that is best for you.\n\nWhen Is Travel Health Insurance required?\n\nSome countries may require you to purchase travel health insurance to gain entry.\n\nTraveling to Schengen Countries\n\nSchengen countries require visa applicants to prove they have travel medical insurance to cover expenses for repatriation, urgent medical attention, emergency hospital treatment and more. Read our blog about Countries that Require Travel Medical Insurance for Entry to learn more.\n\nOther Situations\n\nYou may also be required to purchase travel health insurance depending on the purpose of your trip. The U.S., for example, requires those traveling on a J1 or J2 visa to maintain a certain level of medical coverage for the duration of their stay. However, if you're visiting the U.S. on a B2 visa, a travel medical insurance plan is only recommended. Find out How to Choose the Best Visitor Insurance Plan for You.\n\nTravelers embarking on other trips — such as organized tours, working holiday schemes, mission trips, and cruises — may also be required to purchase coverage.\n\nThese are just a few reasons when you would be required to purchase Travel Medical Insurance. See the full list for 6 Times You Need to Purchase Travel Medical Insurance.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat country do I select as my primary destination if I'm visiting several countries?\n\nIf you're planning a trip with multiple destinations, such as a vacation to Europe, you'll want to select the country that you plan on spending the most time in. Your travel medical insurance will cover you for the entirety of your trip and in countries outside of your own.\n\nCan I purchase visitors insurance for my relatives?\n\nYes, the insured does not have to be the one that fills out the application. You can purchase a travel medical plan for your parents, friends, or relatives as long as you have the necessary information.\n\nI am a non-U.S. citizen and an international student. Will PPACA's individual mandate affect my IMG plan?\n\nAs non-resident aliens, international students on F, J, M and Q visas (and certain family members of students) are not subject to the individual mandate for their first 5 years in the U.S. All other J categories (teacher, trainee, work and travel, au pair, high school, etc.) are not subject to the individual mandate for 2 years (out of the past six).\n\nSince international students are not subject to the mandate, they are not required to purchase a plan that meets PPACA requirements and can purchase an appropriate IMG plan.\n\nInternational Students – Exempt as Non-Resident Aliens\n\nUnder the IRS international student exemption, anyone “temporarily in the United States on an “F”, “J”, “M”, or “Q” visa for the primary purpose of studying at an accredited academic institution or vocational school (and certain family members of students), and who substantially complies with the requirements of that visa,” is exempt from being treated as a resident alien, and is therefore exempt from the individual mandate as a non-resident alien.\n\nThat exemption applies for 5 years. After 5 years, a student is no longer exempt, and the substantial presence test must be applied. See examples here.\n\nEven after 5 years in the U.S., an international student may continue to be a non-resident alien for tax purposes under the “Closer Connection” exception if they can prove that they still have a closer connection to their home country than to the U.S.\n\nThe Individual Mandate and Alien / Non-Alien Status\n\nThe IRS provides a questions and answers page on the individual mandate. Question 11 asks whether all individuals living in the U.S. are subject to the mandate. The answer is that U.S. citizens and permanent legal residents are subject to the mandate, as are “foreign nationals who are in the U.S. long enough during a calendar year to qualify as resident aliens for tax purposes.” Thus, non-resident aliens are not subject to the individual mandate, even if they have to file a tax return.\n\nAm I a Resident or Non-Resident Alien?\n\nThe IRS states that you are a non-resident alien unless you meet either the green card test or the substantial presence test.\n\nUnder IRS Publication 519, Tax Guide for Aliens (the green card test), green card holders are resident aliens for tax purposes. The substantial presence test uses a formula to count the number of days present in the U.S. over the past 3 years. Generally, you a resident alien after six months of presence in the U.S. – unless you are exempt.\n\nI am a U.S. citizen that will be temporarily traveling outside of the U.S. Do I need PPACA coverage for this?\n\nIMG’s international travel medical products are not a substitute for minimum essential coverage that you may need to have under PPACA. However, since most PPACA plans do not provide the types of international benefits and assistance that travelers need, you should strongly consider purchasing an international travel medical plan such as IMG’s Patriot Lite Travel Medical Insurance for coverage while you travel outside of the U.S.\n\nIf you are a U.S. citizen, national or an “alien lawfully present” in the U.S., you will need to maintain minimum essential coverage unless you are exempt. Exemptions include:\n\nIndividuals not residing in the U.S.\n\nNon-U.S. citizens who are “non-resident aliens” (for U.S. income tax purposes). See Am I a Resident or Non-Resident Alien?\n\nIndividuals with a coverage gap of less than 3 months.\n\nIndividuals who cannot afford coverage (i.e. required contribution exceeds 8% of\n\nhousehold income).\n\nIndividuals with a religious conscience exemption (applies only to certain faiths).\n\nMembers of a health care sharing ministry.\n\nIncarcerated individuals.\n\nIndividuals with income below the tax filing threshold; and\n\nMembers of Indian tribes\n\nIn general, PPACA does not govern short-term limited duration insurance, like IMG’s short-term travel medical insurance programs.\n\nHowever, please understand that under PPACA, as of January 1, 2014, extensions of short-term coverage will be limited to less than 12 months to meet the definition of a short-term limited duration plan.\n\nI am a non-U.S. citizen that will be traveling to the U.S. temporarily. Do I need PPACA coverage?\n\nIMG’s international travel medical products are not a substitute for minimum essential coverage that you may need to have under PPACA. If you are a U.S. citizen, national or legal resident alien in the U.S., you will need to maintain minimum essential coverage unless you are exempt. Exemptions include:\n\nIndividuals not residing in the U.S.\n\nNon-U.S. citizens who are “non-resident aliens” (for U.S. income tax purposes). See Am I a Resident or Non-Resident Alien?\n\nIndividuals with a coverage gap of less than 3 months\n\nIndividuals who cannot afford coverage (i.e. required contribution exceeds 8% of household income)\n\nIndividuals with a religious conscience exemption (applies only to certain faiths)\n\nMembers of a health care sharing ministry\n\nIncarcerated individuals\n\nIndividuals with income below the tax filing threshold; and\n\nMembers of Indian tribes\n\nYou will not need PPACA coverage for short-term travel to the U.S., unless you are considered an “alien lawfully present” in the U.S. See I am a Non-U.S. citizen covered under a Global Medical Insurance Plan.\n\nIn general, PPACA does not govern short-term limited duration insurance, like IMG’s short-term travel medical insurance programs.\n\nHowever please understand that under PPACA, as of January 1, 2014, extensions of short-term coverage will be limited to less than 12 months to meet the definition of a short-term limited duration plan.\n\nWhat is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act? (PPACA)\n\nThe \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\" commonly known as PPACA, was first introduced as a measure to deal with rising healthcare costs and numbers of uninsured.\n\nThe heart of PPACA consists of three provisions: guaranteed issue (insurers must offer coverage regardless of the applicant's health status or pre-existing conditions), community rating (insurers must offer policies within a given territory at the same price regardless of health status, age, gender, or other factors), and an individual mandate. The individual mandate assures that everyone has a minimum amount of coverage: those above a certain annual income are required to purchase coverage or incur a tax penalty; those who cannot afford it will have their coverage paid for by the government.\n\nAs PPACA continues to be implemented and challenged throughout the country, understanding the issues and implications for the international insurance industry and your business becomes all the more important.\n\nAm I getting the best deal on these plans?\n\nInsurance prices are regulated by the government - you won't find a better price on IMG insurance plans anywhere else.\n\nWhat should I do if the worst happens and I need to go to a hospital while on a mission Trip?\n\nIMG plans provide you access to more than 17,000 providers through our International Provider Access (IPA) while you're outside of the United States. Our multilingual customer service centers, claims administrators, and 24-hour emergency care coordinators are ready if the unforeseen does happen during your mission trip.\n\nMy family is planning a visit. When should visitors to the U.S. purchase international insurance?\n\nVisitors should plan to get insurance after they plan their trip and receive their visa, but before they arrive in the U.S. The effective dates for coverage should match their visa.\n\nI already have health insurance. Why would I need Visitor Insurance in the U.S.?\n\nIf you were to suffer an injury or get sick while visiting the United States, you might be surprised by the cost of medical care. You may also be surprised by the limited assistance your domestic insurance provider can provide while you're visiting. Visitor insurance coverage in the U.S. helps to ensure that you don't incur any unforeseen expenses, receive excellent care, and get home quickly and safely if anything were to happen during your visit.\n\nWhat mission focused benefits are included in these plans?\n\nIn addition to the medical and health coverage, healthcare provider access, and other benefits you expect from IMG plans, we offer missionary-specific insurance benefits like coverage for furlough and political evacuations. See your plan befits information for more!\n\nWhen should I complete my waiver?\n\nOnce your plan is purchased and you have your plan documents, you will have the information you'll need to complete your school's waiver.\n\nHow do I provide proof of insurance for my school?\n\nTo show proof of insurance, simply download or print a copy of the ID card and/or confirmation letter and provide it to your school's program administrator.\n\nHow long does it take to process my application and receive my ID card and other documents?\n\nIf you are applying for coverage under the Patriot series of plans, IMG will process your application and send your ID card and other documents within one business day. If you are applying for coverage under the Global or Group series, IMG will process your application within three to four business days following the receipt of all required information, and your materials will be forwarded the same day coverage is approved. Every attempt will be made to process your application timely. The specific time frame depends largely on the type of coverage for which you are applying."
