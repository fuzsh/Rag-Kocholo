        "text": "Not all medical professions involve direct patient care. Plenty of healthcare jobs still allow you to make an impact in the field while working behind the scenes.\n\nMedical billing and coding is one of these professions. It involves analyzing healthcare data and translating it into a standardized code to bill insurance companies and patients. This profession is detail-oriented and technical, but is medical billing and coding hard?\n\nMedical billing and coding might be complex, but it’s certainly not impossible to master. Let’s take a look at what medical billers and coders do.\n\nWhat Do Medical Billers and Coders Do?\n\nWhat is medical billing and coding, and what do these professionals do on the job? Let’s dive in.\n\nRole and Responsibilities\n\nMedical billers and coders are the backbone of the healthcare reimbursement cycle. Sometimes, one professional takes on both billing and coding duties. Other times, these duties are handled by separate people.\n\nMedical billers and coders are responsible for ensuring healthcare providers receive payment for their services. When a patient sees a doctor at a clinic, hospital or physician’s office, medical staff records data about the visit. That data, also known as clinical documentation, includes information like diagnoses, procedures and prescriptions.\n\nIn addition to these tasks, medical coders play an important role in helping healthcare organizations manage information on a larger scale. “Coding treatments and diagnoses with specific code sets enable us to track data, implement protocol adjustments and gain insights into disease processes,” says medical coding educator Alicia Scott. “This data allows us to analyze statistics at local, state, national and global levels.”\n\nDay-to-Day Tasks\n\nMedical coders translate clinical documentation into standardized codes. They use specialized coding software and coding classification systems, like Current Procedural Terminology (CPT®); International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10-CM); International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS); and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) Level II.\n\nMedical billers receive these codes and use them to create a bill, or claim. They then send these claims to the patient’s health insurance company or a federal agency, like Medicare, for reimbursement. If insurance doesn’t cover all of the costs, billers monitor outstanding medical bills to ensure payment from the responsible parties.\n\nSucceeding as a medical biller and coder requires a strong knowledge of coding systems and the ability to learn quickly. You’ll need sharp memorization and communication chops.\n\nWhile medical billers and coders do not provide direct patient care, answering patient questions regarding claims is a part of the role. Medical billers also spend a lot of time in direct communication with insurance representatives, while coders liaise with providers.\n\nWork Environment\n\nMedical billers and coders commonly work in hospitals, physician’s offices, management positions, accounting services and nursing facilities. Other industries need medical coding and billing professionals, too, including insurance carriers, scientific research centers and technical consulting services.\n\nAccording to the 2023 Salary Survey from leading medical records and health information technology organization AAPC, 55% of medical records specialists work remotely.\n\nSalary and Job Growth\n\nThe median medical billing and coding salary is $47,180 per year as of 2022, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Employment in the medical records specialist field, which includes medical billers and coders, is projected to grow by 8% between 2022 and 2032—more than double the average projected growth rate for all other occupations. Over that same period, about 16,500 medical records specialist jobs are expected to open each year.\n\nTop Skills for Medical Billing and Coding\n\nWhat skills are required for a successful medical billing and coding career? Alongside a thorough knowledge of medical and coding terms, excellent medical billers and coders should possess the following soft skills.\n\nStrong Communication\n\nMedical billers and coders interact with other professionals daily, so they must be comfortable with written and verbal correspondence and practice clear, effective communication.\n\nOf course, communication gaps do occur. It is just as important for medical billers and coders to have conflict resolution and problem-solving skills.\n\nAttention to Detail\n\nMedical codes are highly specific, so attention to detail is key. Entering a wrong character into the coding or billing software could throw a wrench in your work. You’ll also need to scan bills for inaccuracies and discrepancies, which requires a keen eye for detail.\n\nAbility To Learn New Software\n\nMedical coders use specialized software to generate medical codes from clinical documentation. Billers use software programs to automate billing tasks, such as verifying patients’ insurance plans, processing claims and submitting payments.\n\nWhile you’re not expected to master every type of software, you should know how to familiarize yourself with new software as it’s introduced.\n\nCustomer Service\n\nMedical billers and coders must regularly meet patient inquiries and requests. This is where great customer service skills come in. You might be asked to explain industry jargon or help a patient understand their medical bill, for example. No matter what patients ask, medical billers and coders should always respond with patience, respect and professionalism.\n\nMedical Billing and Coding Courses\n\nProfessional certification is essential to success in medical billing and coding, but a higher education degree is not necessary to enter the field. However, a degree in medical billing and coding, healthcare management or another related field could increase job prospects.\n\nHere are a few courses you can expect to take while completing a billing and coding degree or certification prep program.\n\nPathopharmacology\n\nPathopharmacology is the study of human diseases and how they’re treated. In this course, you’ll learn how clinicians wield drug therapy strategies against various diseases. You’ll also study disease etiology (the causation of diseases), diagnostic measures, dosages, drug administration and how to spot symptoms.\n\nIntroduction to Health Services and Information Systems\n\nThis course provides an overview of the history and organization of the U.S. healthcare system. You’ll learn about the system’s current challenges and explore the relationships among healthcare network components, including patients, providers and other healthcare professionals.\n\nBasic Medical Terminology\n\nIn this course, you’ll learn the fundamentals of medical terminology. Students review the terminology used to describe medical procedures, medications and the human body and its conditions.\n\nHealth Insurance and Reimbursement\n\nIn this class, you’ll explore common reimbursement and payment methodologies used in U.S. healthcare systems.\n\nIs Medical Billing and Coding Hard?\n\nMedical coding and billing is technical, requires great attention to detail and demands sharp communication and problem-solving skills. This may prove challenging for some, while others might find it fits right into their natural working style.\n\nEducation and Training\n\nYou don’t need a degree to become a medical biller and coder, but it’s recommended to bolster your resume and job opportunities. Completing an associate degree takes two years, while a bachelor’s degree typically takes four. Billers and coders can also pursue shorter academic certificates from colleges, which typically take six to 18 months to complete, or courses from independent educational companies, which usually run four to nine months.\n\nMedical records specialists may take various medical billing and coding certification online courses to enhance their training. Certifications demonstrate your expertise in medical billing and coding, and employers typically expect new hires to hold certification or earn a credential shortly after starting work. Requirements for medical billing and coding certification vary, so check with your prospective provider for details.\n\nCommon medical billing and coding certifications include:\n\nCertified Professional Coder (CPC®)\n\nCertified Coding Specialist (CCS)®\n\nCertified Coding Associate (CCA)®\n\nCertified Professional Biller (CPB)®\n\nCertified Medical Reimbursement Specialist (CMRS)\n\nTo pass the CPC exam, you’ll need to understand anatomy, the business of medicine, and how to code a variety of patient services. The CPC is recommended for medical coding careers in physician’s offices.\n\nHow long it takes to obtain this expertise varies, but it could take several months—or years—of job experience. It’s recommended to have a minimum of one year of coding experience to become CCS certified, or at least six months of coding experience to become CCA certified. To maintain certification, you’ll typically need to complete continuing education and pay membership fees to the sponsoring organization.\n\nBeyond medical billing and coding certification training and exams, this profession involves constantly learning on the job. This profession is a good fit for those who enjoy memorization and career-long learning.\n\nUltimately, becoming a medical biller and coder requires a certain level of rigor and tenacity. But if you’re up for the challenge, it can be a great career fit.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Medical Billing and Coding"
