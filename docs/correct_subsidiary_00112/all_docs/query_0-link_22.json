        "text": "At Regeneron, we've been committed to making a difference in patients' lives for over 30 years.\n\nWe've done this by following the science.\n\nOne of the things that's made Regeneron really unique is its willingness to invest in cutting edge technologies.\n\nWe're one of the few companies in the world that go all the way from foundational discovery, to research, from research to development, to manufacturing and commercialization.\n\nWe do that all at our campuses in New York, New Jersey, Ireland, and the UK.\n\nIt's really cool because we go from the really big thought, the really big idea, all the way to seeing the impact on a person.\n\nOne of the things that distinguishes Regeneron is that we are a founder-led organization.\n\nBoth Len and George are scientists, and they've really set the tone of focusing on science from the very beginning.\n\nAnd it spreads the through the organization in terms of our mission, our vision, our activities, our behaviors.\n\nWe're one of the unique places where we've put such a big emphasis on human genetics and deep biology.\n\nOur genetics research is focused on looking at differences in our genes and connecting that to diseases.\n\nWe have a capability of combining human gene sequence data with electronic medical records.\n\nWe have a rich genomic database, and we apply that across our organization, looking for new for new insights and to advance our research programs.\n\nWe've invested in a set of core technologies we call the VelociSuite Technologies.\n\nThese include things like VelociGene, VelocImmune, and together this suite of technologies gives us an engine for drug discovery.\n\nWe can use that engine again, and again, and again to produce new drugs.\n\nOur VelociGene technologies give us an unprecedented ability to precisely manipulate the mouse genome and work very rapidly.\n\nLikewise, the VelocImmune technology gives us an unprecedented speed in producing new drugs candidates.\n\nSo at a high level in drug development, there are really three key questions that we need to answer.\n\nOne is does it work? Is it safe? And the third is can we produce it?\n\nBefore we can even start to explore whether it works, part of the role in pre-clinical development is to establish whether it's safe and also develop a manufacturing process by which we can produce it.\n\nSo, I see ourselves as a link between the discovery world and the manufacturing facility where they will produce the drugs that we can test in clinical trials and ultimately also do commercial production.\n\nOnce we've completed pre-clinical research to confirm safety, we work internally with our medical experts to develop our trial designs.\n\nWe take those designs and work with healthcare providers across the globe to help us implement clinical trials.\n\nAfter decades of research at a lab bench and years of clinical trial work, we take tremendous pride in being able to determine whether we've made a difference in patient lives.\n\nAfter completion of our clinical trials and data analysis, we then take that data to regulatory authorities across the globe, so that they can give us our stamp of approval.\n\nWith this approval, we work with our manufacturing group to switch into high gear.\n\nAll of our drugs, whether they're for a clinical trial or a commercial market, are made across our manufacturing footprint, in both Rensselaer, New York and Raheen, Ireland.\n\nOur quality standard is very simple. We want to make something that at the end of the day, we would put in ourselves, our children, our siblings, our parents, our grandparents and we have a just tremendous responsibility to get things that are safe and efficacious to those people.\n\nThe commercial organization at Regeneron is responsible and accountable for the really important step of making sure that our medicines get to patients who need them.\n\nWe want to lead the industry in competitive commercialization and that activity is powered by our science.\n\nIt's really a dream to work at Regeneron where number one is patients and using science to help them.\n\nI love the commitment to science.\n\nI love that we have foundationally a deeply ethical company.\n\nAt Regeneron, we study genetics.\n\nWe build cutting edge technologies.\n\nWe develop biologic medicines.\n\nWe conduct thorough research.\n\nWe follow the science.\n\nWe bring innovative medicines to patients.\n\nBecause the potential.\n\nTo use science.\n\nTo improve human health is endless.\n\nAnd we're driven.\n\nBy what we've yet to discover."
