        "text": "Introduction\n\n1Since 1959, Cuba has made health a national priority by establishing a public, universal and free system, subordinating economic considerations to the imperative of public health, with an annual investment representing the largest share of the national budget. Based on prevention and the concept of the “family doctor”, it has enabled the population of the island to enjoy a level of health protection unique in the Third World, comparable to that of the most developed countries. The World Health Organization (WHO), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the World Bank, among others, as well as the medical journals The Lancet, Science and The New England Journal of Medicine have praised this system and present it as the model to follow for developing countries, as well as a path to be explored for the richest nations.\n\n2Despite limited resources and a complex geopolitical context – the country having been under US sanctions since 1960 – how has Cuba managed to become a global benchmark in the field of public health? What are the characteristics of the island’s health system that enable it to provide the entire population with high quality care? How did a nation representing 0.001% of the world’s population become the leader of international medical solidarity?\n\n3Three axes structure this study. The first part will be devoted to the genesis of the Cuban health system based on the doctrine “prevent before you heal” and the formation of an abundant human capital. Secondly, the effectiveness of this model will be considered in the light of statistical results and opinions issued by international institutions on the health policy of the Caribbean island. Finally, the reasons which led Cuba to export its medical services, to make health solidarity a pillar of its foreign policy and to make this sector the first source of income for the country will be analyzed.\n\n1. The Cuban health system: formation and human capital\n\n5Faced with this, Cuba therefore decided to make the development of a public, universal and free health system a national priority. Founded in 1961, the National Health System (SNS), an entity dependent on the Ministry of Public Health, is structured around seven principles:\n\nHealth is a people’s right.\n\nThe health of the population is the responsibility of the state.\n\nHealth services are equally accessible to the population.\n\nHealth practices have a solid scientific basis.\n\nHealth actions have a preventive orientation.\n\nSocial participation is inherent in the use and development of health services.\n\n2 Benito A. Pérez Maza, “La equidad en los servicios de salud”, Revista Cubana de Salud PúblicaJuly-S (...)\n\nInternational solidarity will be a practice of the health services.\n\n6The entire Cuban health system is based on the model called “the family doctor and nurse”, developed in 1984. This model, where the basic unit is the family nucleus, with a clinical, epidemiological and social approach of health problems, has seven characteristics that ratify the principles set out by the SNS:\n\nstate and social character of medicine\n\naccessibility and free services\n\nprophylactic (preventive) orientation\n\ncommunity and intersectoral participation\n\ninternational collaboration\n\nnormative centralization and executive decentralization\n\n3 Pedro Mujica Pérez, “El sistema de salud cubano”, Revista de Ciencias Médicas de Pinar del Río, Sep (...)\n\nadequate application of advances in science and technology.\n\n9This model adapts to its environment and to the biological, psychological and social characteristics of the community and its health situation. Thus, if a territorial area has a population particularly prone to allergies, the polyclinic will open a dedicated service in order to respond to this type of problem. Likewise, if a significant percentage of a community has hypertension, the institution will take the necessary steps to adjust to that reality. Another example, if a sector has a large number of smokers, an awareness campaign on the harmfulness of tobacco will be carried out at regular intervals.\n\n1.1. Formation and human capital\n\n1.2. The biotechnology industry\n\n14Cuba has also invested in the biotechnology sector by creating a leading industry with the following characteristics:\n\nThe state is the main investor.\n\nThe scientific and technical preparation of professionals trained in Cuban universities aims for excellence.\n\nSignificant investment in education and training of human resources.\n\nClose relationship between the health system and the health needs of the population: the products developed are primarily focused on the health needs of the country.\n\nProduct development to substitute for imports and be self-sufficient for national demand and national health programs.\n\nThe national market is the highest priority.\n\n“Closed cycle” and complete policy within the biotechnology centers: research, development, production, marketing, after-sales service.\n\nSynergy between research and development institutions and production, free from any individual competition. Each institution contributes with its strengths to the common need to create new products. The products are thus obtained thanks to the collaboration of all the institutions.\n\nGain in international competitiveness in terms of quality, production volume, costs and novelty.\n\n13 Organización Panamericana de la Salud & Organización Mundial de la Salud, “Biotecnología para la sa (...)\n\nCollaboration with developing countries for the research, development, production and commercialization of biotechnological products.\n\n17A report published jointly by the European Commission, the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization hails Havana’s results:\n\n16 Comisión Europea, Organización Panamericana de la Salud, Organización Mundial de la Salud, “Experie (...)\n\nOver the years, Cuba has successfully developed its capacity to produce health technologies to maintain its health system, recognized worldwide for having achieved universal coverage. This reality is illustrated by the health indicators obtained, comparable to those of highly developed countries. The level of this success prompts other countries attempting to establish a sustainable and competitive national pharmaceutical sector to emulate the model. Cuba has therefore become a world leader in South-South technology transfer, helping low-income countries to develop their own national biotechnology capacities, providing technical capacity and facilitating access to life-saving medicines at low cost for fight diseases such as meningitis B and hepatitis B.\n\n2. Results and international recognition\n\n29The specialist journal adds:\n\nThis highly structured, prevention-oriented system has produced positive results. Vaccination rates in Cuba are among the highest in the world. The life expectancy of 78 years from birth is virtually identical to that in the United States. The infant mortality rate in Cuba has fallen from more than 80 per 1000 live births in the 1950s to less than 5 per 1000 — lower than the U.S. rate. […]\n\n37 Ibid.\n\nWithout doubt, the improved health outcomes are largely the result of improvements in nutrition and education, which address the social determinants of health. Cuba's literacy rate is 99%, and health education is part of the mandatory school curriculum. […]\n\n38 Fitzhugh Mullan, “Affirmative Action, Cuba Style”, New England Journal of Medecine, 23 December 200 (...)\n\nThe Cuban health care system […] is exceptional for a poor country and represents an important political accomplishment of the Castro government. Since 1959, Cuba has invested heavily in health care and now has twice as many physicians per capita as the United States and health indicators on a par with those in the most developed nations — despite the U.S. embargo that severely reduces the availability of medications and medical technology.\n\n32The World Bank also praised the island’s health system:\n\nCuba has become internationally recognized for its achievements in the areas of education and health, with social service delivery outcomes that surpass most countries in the developing world and in some areas match first-world standards. Since the Cuban revolution in 1959, […], the country has created a social service system that guarantees universal access to education and health care provided by the state. This model has enabled Cuba to achieve near universal literacy, the eradication of certain diseases, widespread access to potable water and basic sanitation, and among the lowest infant mortality rates and longest life expectancies in the region.\n\n42 Dan Erikson, Annie Lord & Peter Wolf, Cuba’s Social Services : A Review of Education, Health, and S (...)\n\nA review of Cuba’s social indicators reveals a pattern of almost continuous improvement from the 1960s through the end of the 1980s. Several major indices, such as life expectancy and infant mortality, continued to improve during the country’s economic crisis of the 1990s, […]. Today, Cuba’s social performance is among the best in the developing world, as documented by numerous international sources including the World Health Organization, the United Nations Development Programme and other U.N. agencies, and the World Bank. […] Cuba far outranks both Latin America and the Caribbean and other lower-middle income countries in major indices of education, health, and sanitation.\n\n36This expertise in the field of health has enabled the island to cope with the global Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n2.1. The fight against the Covid-19 pandemic\n\n46In addition, it allows the island to establish international cooperation with many countries around the world.\n\n3. International cooperation\n\n50According to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), Cuban humanitarian aid represents a percentage of GDP higher than the average of the 18 most developed nations. UNDP notes in a report that\n\n65 Programme des Nations unies pour le Développement, Investigación sobre ciencia, tecnología y desarr (...)\n\nThe cooperation offered by Cuba takes place in a context of South-South cooperation. It does not pursue a lucrative objective, but on the contrary is offered as the expression of a principle of solidarity and, as far as possible, on the basis of shared costs. Nevertheless, for years Cuba has provided aid in the form of grants to the poorest countries, and has been very flexible in the form or structure of collaboration […]. In almost all cases, Cuban aid has been free, although from 1977 onwards, with certain high-income countries, mainly oil-producing, cooperation in the form of compensation developed. The high development achieved in Cuba in the fields of health, education and sport has meant that cooperation has concerned these sectors, although there has been participation in other branches such as construction, fishing. and agriculture.\n\nthe free dispatch of health workers for a period of two years after which a new team replaces the existing staff;\n\nthe presence of medical brigades who provide their services in rural areas and medical deserts, so that their work does not interfere with that of national doctors;\n\n67 Ibid.\n\nthe training of medical personnel at the Latin American School of Medicine in Havana, or in universities created there under the direction of Cuban professors.\n\n3.1. The Latin American School of Medicine in Havana\n\n53The World Health Organization paid tribute to the work of ELAM:\n\n[In terms of recruitment], preference is given to financially disadvantaged applicants who would otherwise not be able to afford medical school. As a result, 75% [of] students come from communities in need of doctors and ethnic minorities, as well as indigenous peoples, are well represented […]. New doctors work in most countries of the Americas, including the United States, various African countries, and many English-speaking countries in the Caribbean region.\n\n70 Organisation mondiale de la santé, “Cuba répond à la demande de Médecins”, May 2010, Volume 88. htt (...)\n\nAt the same time, schools like ELAM challenge medical education around the world to have more social concerns. […] This notion of social responsibility must be considered everywhere in the world, even in traditional medical circles […]. The world urgently needs these kinds of dedicated builders of new paradigms in medical education.\n\n72 Dr. Margaret Chan, “Remarks at the Latin American School of Medicine”, World Health Organization, 2 (...)\n\nI know of no other medical school that offers students so much, at no charge. I know of no other medical school with an admissions policy that gives first priority to candidates who come from poor communities and know, first-hand, what it means to live without access to essential medical care. For once, if you are poor, female, or from an indigenous population you have a distinct advantage. This is an institutional ethic that makes this medical school unique.\n\n56In addition to training foreign students, Cuba also assisted victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.\n\n3.2. The children of Chernobyl\n\n58The British daily The Guardian notes in this regard:\n\nDespite the isolation and the economic slump, Cuba still takes care of them. The difference between this programme and others – such as the exchange of Cuban medical expertise for Venezuelan oil – is that there is no economic gain. The programme even survived Cuba’s economic crisis of the early 90s, the so-called \"special period\" after the fall of the Soviet bloc. […]\n\n76 Andrés Schipani, “Revolutionary Care : Castro’s Doctors Give Hope to the Children of Chernobyl”, Th (...)\n\nDr Julio Medina, general co-ordinator of the programme, recently told […]: “It is simple: we do not give what we have in excess; we share all that we have”.\n\n61As part of its international medical cooperation, Cuba established Operation Miracle in 2004.\n\n3.3 Operation Miracle\n\n3.4. Henry Reeve Medical Brigades\n\n70According to José Di Fabio, WHO representative,\n\n97 Diario do Centro de Mundo, “Entrevista: ‘é incrível o que Cuba pode fazer’, diz OMS sobre ajuda con (...)\n\nCuba is a special case because of its rapid response capacity, its political will and the experience of doctors. What Cuba is capable of achieving is incredible. There is both the political will [of the authorities] and the human will of the population. When there was an earthquake in Pakistan, 2,000 doctors were dispatched within 48 hours. They were the first to arrive in Pakistan and the last to leave the country. They stayed for almost six months. It was the same in Haiti.\n\n71In Africa, Cuba has also played a notable role in the fight against epidemics.\n\n3.5. The fight against meningitis, malaria and Ebola in Africa\n\n80Cuban solidarity was also expressed during the Covid-19 pandemic that hit the entire planet.\n\n3.6. The Covid-19 pandemic\n\n82Stefania Bonaldi, mayor of the municipality of Crema, where the Cuban-operated hospital was located, paid tribute to the medical staff on the island:\n\nI will be really brief because better than my words, our immense gratitude is already visible on the faces of the authorities present here, whom I thank from the bottom of my heart. I have a particular emotion for the fellow mayors and the administrators of Crema, who represent so many faces, those of all the inhabitants of Crema, without exception, who embrace you with affection and sincerity, fogged with nostalgia because we are certain that you will be missed, as if you were brothers.\n\nWe know this well, because we Italians have been a people of migrants and we know what feelings accompany those who leave.\n\nWe will miss you but you will not disappear, because our consciences will preserve your gift and strengthen us in our conviction that in Crema no one should ever be considered a stranger again. And henceforth we will have a decisive argument to oppose to anyone who wishes to limit or interfere with our sacred duty of hospitality.\n\nYour reassuring presence will be missed as it was an effective remedy in a time of unprecedented uncertainty and imminent danger.\n\nWhat you have represented silently during these weeks, starting with the certainty that our planet can fight and overcome inequalities, injustices and emergencies, if all peoples fraternize, will be missed.\n\nWhen you came here, you said that your homeland was the world. Therefore, from now on, you will always be our compatriots, in this vast world often abused by the absence of the supreme value of solidarity.\n\nWe were shipwrecked and you rescued us, without asking us our name or our origin. After months of struggle, anguish, doubts, we now see the light, but only because we have come together.\n\nWomen and men of our Lombard health system, Institutions, leaders and administrators at all levels, we have stood together with you, dear doctors and nurses of the “Henry Reeve” Brigade and with your generous people, drawing from your competence and from your passion the oxygen necessary to keep alive the confidence essential in the fight.\n\nWithout you, everything would have been more difficult.\n\nIn our city and in our territory, during these months, gestures of solidarity and generosity have multiplied. We have seen the reappearance of feelings of closeness that were habitually drowsy, worn out by everyday life.\n\nYou have also fueled these feelings of humanity and brotherhood by your presence here, discreet but effective, respectful but determined, gentle but reliable.\n\nYou have arrived at the most dramatic moment and you fought in our company to transform “the complaint into dance”, a collective dance, proving once again that great battles are not won by lone heroes, but by communities, and what has happened on our earth is the proof, the demonstration.\n\nWe have been a community and that is why we have triumphed. We have been, thanks to you once again, a remedy for individualism, the favorite ally of adversity. We have of course been a multicultural and very human community. A deployment that did not admit defeat and we did not indeed lose.\n\nWe fought like a passionate people with a project, refusing the risk of being a chaotic and hesitant crowd, driven only by fear.\n\nWe have become intelligent adversaries of a killer pathogen […].\n\nWith you, everything was easier.\n\n118 Stefania Bonaldi, “Covid: medici Cuba terminano missione a Crema con tanti ringraziamenti”, Giornal (...)\n\nThank you, on behalf of all the citizens of Crema, our territory, Lombardy and all of Italy!\n\nI wish to express my immense gratitude and that of my country to the 43 Cubans who have completed the quarantine period today, after their incalculable contribution to the success of the operation carried out by Cuba to help the passengers and part of the crew of the Braemer cruise ship to return to the UK on March 18th.\n\nI highly appreciate the courage and humanism of those who decided to be on the front line knowing that it was a complex and delicate operation and that they should be separated for two weeks from their families and people who are dear to them. […]\n\nDuring Operation Braemer, I witnessed the many qualities of the Cuban people, their humanitarian principles, their friendliness, their commitment to work; facets of Cuban character that I have discovered and come to love since arriving on this island. […]\n\n134 Jon Stone, “UK Thanks Cuba for ‘Great Gesture of Solidarity’ in Rescuing Passengers From Coronaviru (...)\n\nYour great gesture of solidarity will last in the memory of the passengers and crew of the Braemer, their families and friends, who are together today thanks to your effort.\n\nConclusion\n\n91As early as 1959, Cuba made the choice to create a public, universal and free health care system, making the health of the population a national priority and dedicating the largest part of the national budget to this sector. By focusing its health philosophy on prevention and on the “family doctor” model and relegating commercial considerations to the background, the island has obtained remarkable results, unprecedented for a Third World country with limited resources and under economic sanctions for more than half a century.\n\n92The excellence achieved in the field of health has thus enabled the island to form an abundant human capital whose expertise is now in demand around the world, to the point of making international medical cooperation the first source of income for Cuba. This contribution to emergencies that occur across the planet and its capacity to respond to epidemics and natural disasters has led Havana to develop a health diplomacy unparalleled in the world and to strengthen the prestige of its health system.\n\n93By making health a state monopoly not subject to budgetary constraints, Cuba has been able to put in place a strategy of prevention and fight against emerging diseases such as Covid-19, which has proved to be highly effective, thus allowing the competent authorities to provide quality protection to citizens and to have one of the lowest rates of infection and lethality in the world. By placing the patient at the center of the health project, Havana has shown that it is possible to provide top quality services to the population, despite the structural constraints linked to its low income."
