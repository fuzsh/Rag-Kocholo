        "text": "ARMA was incorporated on September 22, 1950 by the originators who were Registered Nurses and assistants in local medical offices, hence the title \"Registered\" applies to our members. We are registered with the Federal Government, Washington, DC, and have been designated a non-profit organization.\n\nRead More\n\nBeing a national registry, we are represented in every state, including corpsmen and medics in military service hospitals and clinics, and currently have a membership in the many thousands. We are not an employment agency, training center or a school operating for profit, but rather an organization whose purpose is to advance the status and professionalism of the Medical Assistant.\n\nRead More\n\nOur members are represented in many areas within the medical allied health professions. We are now seeing the results of our efforts in that many medical facilities now require registration (certification) prior to hiring new employees. This is manifesting itself into upgrading the \"Medical Assistant\" as a true professional as well as upgrading her/his salary scale. The many schools and colleges with whom we are affiliated incorporate their students' registration with their graduation exercises.\n\nRead More"
