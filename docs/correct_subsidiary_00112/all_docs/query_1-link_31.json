        "text": "The Division of Disability Determinations is responsible for making the determination of medical eligibility for Florida citizens who apply for disability benefits under the federal Social Security Administration disability programs (Social Security Disability-Title II and Supplemental Security Income-Title XVI), and under the state Medically Needy program. It is also responsible for the periodic Continuing Disability Review (CDR) of all SSA disability beneficiaries to determine if they continue to meet medical eligibility criteria.\n\nApplications for Social Security disability benefits are filed at the claimant's local Social Security Administration (SSA) field office or online at www.ssa.gov. Applications for benefits under the Medically Needy program are made at a local office of the Department of Children and Families. For both programs the application is forwarded to the Division of Disability Determinations for a determination of medical eligibility. The claim is then returned to either the Social Security Administration or the Department of Children and Families for a final determination of technical (non-medical) eligibility and effectuation of any benefits due the claimant."
