        "text": "Informed Consent for Treatment, Telemedicine Services, and Financial Agreement / Assignment of Benefits / Release of Information\n\n1. Consent for Diagnosis and Treatment.\n\nBy your acceptance below, you hereby request, consent, and authorize medical care given to you or your minor child via telehealth by Mammoth Health, PLLC and its affiliated healthcare providers as set forth below, which may include orders for diagnostic procedures, medications, or treatment the physician(s) or other practitioners involved in your/your child's care consider medically necessary. You understand you have the right to consent or refuse to consent to any proposed procedure or therapeutic course, at any time. You acknowledge that no guarantees have been made to you regarding the outcome of any medical, surgical, diagnostic or therapeutic treatment. You understand that some physicians and other practitioners provide their services as independent contractors to the Practice, are not employees or agents of the Practice, and that the Practice is not liable for their acts or omissions. You agree to receive telehealth services as described in further detail below, which means the delivery of health care services, including assessment, treatment, diagnosis, and education, using interactive or asynchronous audio, video, and data communications. You understand that the Practice and its physicians or other practitioners are in a different location than you and that you must accurately report your location during registration. For those states that require it, you can find an explanation of the levels of regulation applicable to clinicians under the STATE REGULATIONS section of this document.\n\n2. Telemedicine\n\nWhat is Telemedicine\n\nTelemedicine is the use of electronic communications by a health care provider to deliver health care services to you when you are physically located at a different site than the provider. Telemedicine is not a separate medical specialty. Telemedicine providers who provide Services (as defined below) to you will do so as employees or contractors of one of the following professional entities, depending on the state in which you are located at the time of your visit: Mammoth Health, PLLC, a Florida professional limited liability company, Mordkin Medical, PC, a California professional corporation, Mammoth Medical, PC, a New Jersey professional service corporation, and Ajax Medical, PLLC, a New York professional limited liability company.1 The aforementioned entities will be referred to collectively as the âPracticeâ for purposes of this Consent. The Practiceâs telehealth platform may include clinicians with whom you exchange information during a telemedicine visit for diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, coordination of care, and/or educational health care needs (the âServicesâ). For example, information exchanged during your telehealth encounter may include:\n\nYour medical history\n\nLaboratory test results\n\nDiagnostic information\n\nInformation about treatment options\n\nWhen using the Services, you will be treated by and will enter into a clinician-patient relationship with a clinician that is employed by or partnered with the Practice and who is licensed in the state in which Services are offered (âClinicianâ). For the purposes of this consent, Clinicians are defined as credentialed healthcare providers, and they may include physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, registered nurses, and other types of healthcare providers. Your providerâs credentials will be made available to you as part of engaging in the Services. If you have any questions about these credentials, pleasedirect them to your telehealth provider.\n\nYour telehealth encounter may take place using one or more telehealth modalities, each of which is designed to provide your Clinician with information needed in order to provide you with appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Depending on your particular condition and other factors, the Services may not be delivered via all of these modalities. Specifically, the Services may be delivered using one or more of the following modalities:\n\nA questionnaire to verify your eligibility to receive a laboratory test;\n\nAn asynchronous store-and-forward encounter that exchanges medical information, including laboratory test results, diagnoses, and treatment options;\n\nA live, interactive, audio-only conversation to discuss laboratory test results, diagnoses, and treatment options; and\n\nA live, interactive, audio-visual encounter to discuss laboratory test results, diagnoses, and treatment options.\n\nElectronic systems used to deliver the Services will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the confidentiality of patient identification and laboratory results and will include measures to safeguard the data and to ensure its integrity against intentional or unintentional corruption. You agree to hold the Practice and the Clinician harmless against any information or data that is compromised due to such technical failures or other causes.\n\nExpected Benefits and Possible Risks of Telemedicine Services\n\nBy your acceptance below, you acknowledge that you understand that some potential benefits of telehealth, results of which are not guaranteed or assured, include: remote access to medical care; medical evaluation and management; and reduced exposure to patients, medical staff, and other individuals at the Practice. You also understand that the potential risks of telehealth include limited or no availability for diagnostic laboratory testing and imaging to assist your provider in diagnosis and treatment; your provider's inability to conduct a hands-on physical examination; and delays in evaluation and treatment due to technical difficulties or interruptions resulting from electronic transmission issues or loss of information due to technical failures. You agree that you will not hold the Practice responsible for lost information due to technological failures. You understand that your provider's recommendation and/or advice and your diagnoses and/or treatment may be based on factors not within his/her control, including incomplete or inaccurate data provided by you. You understand that your provider relies on information provided by me before and during the telehealth encounter and that you must provide accurate and complete information about your medical history, condition(s), and current or previous medical care that is complete and accurate to the best of your ability. IN CASE OF A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, YOU WILL DIAL 911 OR GO DIRECTLY TO THE NEAREST HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM. IF APPLICABLE, CALL THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE (1-800-272-8255); OR CONTACT THE CRISIS TEXT LINE (TEXT âGOâ TO 741-741).\n\n3. Automated Appointment Reminders.\n\nBy supplying your home phone number/mobile phone number/email address, you acknowledge that the Practice or a third-party automated outreach and messaging system may notify you of a pending appointment, missed appointment, lab results, or deliver any other health care message by call, email, or text message. To service your account or collect any amounts you may owe, you consent for Practice or a third party acting on its behalf to call or text you at any phone number associated with your account, including through pre-recorded/automated voice and text messages. You understand that your cell phone carrier may charge you for these text messages and that you will be offered an easy way to opt out of these automated calls or text messages.\n\n4. Use and Release of Medical Information and other Personal Information.\n\nYou acknowledge that the Practice and its licensed physicians and other health care professionals involved in your care, including Coastline Pharmacy, LLC and the Accredited Laboratories, may use and release your medical information obtained during this visit and the fulfillment of any services, such as the fulfillment of prescriptions or processing of lab tests, for purposes of treatment, payment, and health care operations and otherwise as stated in the Privacy Policy.\n\nAs an alternative to a telemedicine consultation, you can make an in-person appointment with your primary care physician or specialty provider.\n\nIn addition to medical information, other personal information (including âSensitiveâ personal information, as defined by certain U.S. state laws) may also be collected, used, and disclosed to deliver your care and the services. This could include, as applicable to the services, government issued identification or other photographic identification collected for identity verification purposes (such as your social security number, driverâs license, state identification card, or passport photo page), and your racial or ethnic origin or information concerning your sex life or sexual orientation, if applicable to the services. For further information on how we protect the privacy and security of your personal information and your rights, please review our Privacy Policy.\n\nBy selecting âAGREE,â you acknowledge that in addition to the information above, you understand and agree to the following:\n\nYou must be physically located in your state of residence (as identified in your new patient registration) during your scheduled telemedicine consultation. If you are no longer located in the state used at the time of registration, you are obligated to notify the Clinician immediately and no later than at the beginning of your telemedicine consultation.\n\nYou have had the alternatives to a telemedicine consultation explained to you, and it is your voluntary choice to participate in this telemedicine consultation.\n\nYou understand there is no guarantee you will be treated by a Clinician. The Clinicians reserve the right to deny care for potential misuse of Services or for any other reason if, in the professional judgment of the Clinician, the provision of Services is not medically or ethically appropriate.\n\nYou understand there is no guarantee that you will be given a prescription by the Clinician.\n\nYou understand that you cannot use the Services to get prescriptions for non-therapeutic drugs and certain other drugs which may be harmful because of their potential for abuse or that otherwise cannot be appropriately prescribed using the Services.\n\nYou understand that you can choose to refuse or end the telemedicine service at any time without affecting your right to future care and treatment.\n\nYou understand that federal and state law requires Clinicians to protect the privacy and the security of health information. You understand that the Practice will take steps to make sure that your health information is not seen by anyone who should not see it. You understand that telehealth may involve electronic communication of your personal medical information to other clinicians who may be located in other areas, including out of state.\n\nYou understand that your personal information, including health and other sensitive information, will be collected, used and disclosed to provide the services, and will be used and protected in accordance with the Privacy Policy, which also sets out information about your privacy rights and how to exercise them.\n\nYou understand that you may be required to verify your identity, and this could include a requirement to produce a form of photographic identification (such as a government issued ID), or provide a copy of this.\n\nYou understand that you may request that your Clinician forward a copy of your medical records to your primary care provider, and in such cases, you expressly consent to the sharing of such medical records with your primary care provider.\n\nYou understand that you may request that your Clinician assist you with identifying options for non-emergency follow-up care needs, to the extent that you want or need in-person health care services.\n\nYou understand that you may register any complaints regarding the Services or your Clinician through Customer Support via the âContact Usâ section of our website at LetsGetChecked.com or with the applicable state professional licensing board.\n\nYou understand that you or your Clinician can discontinue the telemedicine visit at any time if the videoconferencing connections or other telehealth modalities are inadequate to exchange medical information, transmit diagnoses, or review treatment options.\n\nYou understand that you will not physically be in the same room as your Clinician.\n\nYou understand there are potential risks to using telemedicine technology, which, while unlikely, may include loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, and/or other technical difficulties with Services.\n\nYou understand that your healthcare information may be shared with other individuals for scheduling, treatment, and/or billing purposes. Under no circumstances will your identifiable patient information from the telehealth encounter, including images, be shared with researchers or other entities without your written consent.\n\nYou have the right to object to the videotaping or other recording of a telemedicine visit. You also agree not to record a telemedicine visit without your Clinicianâs permission.\n\nYou understand that you have the right to request a copy of the medical record that is created as a result of using the Services which will be provided to you at reasonable cost of preparation, shipping and delivery.\n\nIn an emergency situation, you understand that you should immediately contact emergency services.\n\nYou understand that you will be responsible for any copayments, coinsurances, deductibles, and/or non-covered services that apply to your telemedicine visit (if applicable).\n\nYou understand that it is your duty to inform your Clinician of any relevant interactions regarding your care that you may have with other healthcare providers.\n\nYou understand that you have the right to withhold or withdraw your consent to the use of telemedicine in the course of your care at any time, without affecting your right to future care or treatment. You understand that you may suspend or terminate use of telemedicine at any time for any reason or for no reason.\n\nYou understand this Informed Consent and consent, on your own behalf to receive Services.\n\nTreatment and Confidentiality of Minors\n\nIn accordance with state laws, consent for treatment of a minor can only be authorized by a current legalguardian for the minor. If the parents of a minor are separated, treatment is provided to the minor onlywith the written consent of both parents.If the parents of the minor are divorced,consent for treatment of the minor may be given by the parent authorized to make medical decisions for the minor. If a court of law has ordered that medical decisions for the minor are to be made jointly by the minorâs parents, then consent of both parents is required for treatment of the minor. In the case of minors, as defined by state law, parents may request information about their childâs diagnosis or treatment. While release of this information will be provided, it is best that the process be a collaborative one involving the minor, parent, and Clinician in order to maintain the rapport established between the minor and clinician since rapport is vital to treatment success. Therefore, unless there is a safety concern, the minor would be consulted about the disclosure and encouraged to share the information with the parent first in order to establish better communications within the family structure.\n\nFinancial Agreement\n\nYou understand that you are unconditionally financially responsible to the Practice as the patient, parent, guardian, conservator, or insured for all charges not covered by your insurance plan. You acknowledge that you are responsible for verifying the extent to which your insurance plan covers the telemedicine services offered by the Practice. You promise to pay the Practice for all services rendered by a Clinician, whether or not such services are covered under the terms of your insurance coverage, including but not limited to, co-payments, co-insurance, deductibles, and non-covered services. If you do not have insurance coverage, you understand that the charges for medical services are your personal responsibility and agree to make payment for any such amounts. If you believe any of the charges you have been incurred are incorrect, you must immediately contact us inwriting regarding the amount in question to be eligible to receive a refund. You irrevocably waive your right to challenge the accuracy of any charge, or otherwise receive a refund, if you fail to notify us in writing within fifteen(15) calendar days after the charge, that you believe the charge is inaccurate(setting forth an explanation of why). If the Practice does not receive payment within thirty (30) days from the date such balance is due, the bill may be turned over to an attorney or collection agency. If so, you agree to pay all reasonable collections costs including attorneyâs fees and/or collection fees in addition to the amounts owed for services.\n\nAssignment of Benefits\n\nFurther, if you are entitled to receive healthcare benefits under any insurance policy from any person or organization, you hereby assign to the Practice all of your rights, title and interest in those benefits for payment of your bills. You understand that you are responsible for knowing the terms and conditions of any applicable insurance coverage, and certify that the information given regarding your insurance is accurate and current to the best of your knowledge. You agree not to attempt to cash or negotiate insurance checks sent directly to you or to the insured and further agree to promptly endorse and deliver to the Practice any insurance checks, upon receipt. You hereby authorize the Practice to act on your behalf in regard to filing any appeals for insurance. To the extent applicable, you certify that any information you provide in applying for Medicare or Medicaid is correct. You hereby request payment of authorized benefits to be made on your behalf to the Practice by the Medicare or Medicaid program.\n\nRelease of Information\n\nAdditionally, you authorize the Practice to process claims for payment by your insurance carrier on your behalf for covered services provided to you during this telemedicine consultation.
