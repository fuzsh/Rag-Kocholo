You can speak to an agent Monday-Friday 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. (except holidays).\n\nYou may pay by phone for care received at the following locations:\n\nHarborview Medical Center\n\nUW Medical Center\n\nUW Physicians\n\nUW Medicine Primary Care\n\nHusky Health Center\n\nMake a payment to another UW Medicine department/organization\n\nAccess the payment portals and other information for another UW Medicine department/organization:\n\nAirlift Northwest\n\nFred Hutchinson Cancer Center\n\nUW Laboratory Medicine\n\nValley Medical Center\n\nVerify your health insurance coverage\n\nInsurance coverage varies among individual insurers and policies. Please call your insurance company before your visit to understand what they will pay, which providers and hospitals are in-network, and what you will need to pay out-of-pocket. It is your responsibility to provide UW Medicine staff with your insurance coverage information and to notify them if your coverage changes. Bring your insurance and photo ID cards with you to your appointment.\n\nHealth insurance carriers with plans accepted by UW Medicine\n\nBelow is a list of health insurance companies and government programs in which UW Medicine participates.\n\nPatient Resources\n\nBilling information brochure\n\nLearn more about discounts, billing, and payment options.\n\nEnglish\n\nEspañola (Spanish)\n\nEstimate your costs\n\nUW Medicine promotes transparency by offering options to receive an estimate.\n\nFor a self-generated estimate based on 300 plus \"shoppable\" services grouped with charges typically associated with a procedure. Review the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) to learn more.\n\nFor all other estimates, call the location where you are seeking care:\n\nHarborview and UW Medical Center contact the Financial Access Clearance Team at 206.598.4388.\n\nUW Medicine Primary Care contact your clinic or the appointment line at 206.520.5000.\n\nIf you are permanently residing outside of the United States and seeking nonemergent services, please visit our UW Medicine International Program as the first step to help you navigate the process.\n\nA guide to understanding your estimate:\n\nThe estimate is not a guarantee of what you will be charged.\n\nYour charges will depend on the actual services you receive.\n\nIf your procedure is covered by insurance, the insurance company will decide the amount you are responsible for paying.\n\nTo understand your financial responsibility, it's important that you contact your insurance company once your provider has told you the procedures likely to be performed.\n\nIf you are unable to pay the patient responsibility portion of your bill, Financial Counselors are available to assist with applying for Financial Assistance, Medicaid and Washington Health Exchange.

You will still receive notifications via your preferred communication methods when you have a new statement. You can continue to pay your bill securely through MyChart, by phone, or by mailing a check.\n\nIf you would like to sign up for MyChart and paperless billing, follow the instructions for creating a MyChart account here.\n\nLearn more about paperless statements\n\nMyChart medical advice message billing\n\nMyChart Patient Portal is an easy and convenient way to stay in touch with your care team. Over the past few years, MyChart has also become another way to seek medical advice, rather than coming in for an appointment. This has resulted in a significant increase in the number of messages our providers receive.\n\nAs of June 27, 2023, you will see a notification that you may be billed for medical advice messages. To account for the medical advice and expertise provided through MyChart, UW Medicine will bill for some of these medical advice responses that provide care or consultation that otherwise would have been done through a clinic or telemedicine appointment. These medical advice messages enable you to receive care via MyChart without making an appointment for every care need. This change applies to patients at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center as well.\n\nTo learn more about medical advice messages in MyChart, including when they are free and when they may result in a charge, please visit our MyChart Medical Advice Messages FAQ page.\n\nHospital-based clinics\n\nTo help understand your bills, here are the answers to some of the questions patients often ask.\n\nWhat is a hospital-based clinic?\n\nA hospital-based clinic is a department of the hospital. This type of clinic also is called a hospital-based outpatient clinic or provider-based clinic. Because it must follow the same strict government rules for safety and quality as hospitals, it is more complex and costly to operate. When you see a health care provider or receive services in a hospital-based clinic, you are receiving care that meets hospital standards.\n\nWill I be paying more for services?\n\nDepending on your health insurance coverage, you may pay more for some outpatient services and procedures at hospital-based clinics. A hospital-based clinic is licensed as part of the hospital and the patient may receive a separate charge for the facility, which may result in a higher out-of-pocket expense.\n\nPatients are responsible for co-payments, coinsurance or deductible amounts for both professional and facility charges after insurance has paid.\n\nWe recommend you calling your health insurance provider to determine what your out-of-pocket expenses will be, if any, before receiving service.\n\nWhat do I need to know as a Medicare patient?\n\nMedicare (out-of-pocket) costs are based on Medicare’s prescribed rates for each of the two charges: hospital/facility and physician/professional. Medicare patients have a higher coinsurance amount for services at a hospital-based facility.\n\nWhat do I need to know as a Commercial or Medicare Advantage patient?\n\nInsurance plans vary. Please call your health insurance provider.\n\nAsk your health insurance company:\n\nDoes my insurance benefit plan cover hospital/facility charges in a hospital-based outpatient clinic?\n\nHow much of the charge is covered?\n\nHow much will be applied to the deductible?\n\nHow much will I owe out-of-pocket (coinsurance) after meeting the deductible?\n\nHow can I receive a price estimate?\n\nPrice estimates for self-pay patients are auto generated typically within three (3) days of your visit. For all other estimates, you can request it prior to your visit or procedure:\n\nHarborview and UW Medical Center contact Financial Access Clearance Team at 206.5984388.\n\nUW Medicine Primary Care contact your clinic or the appointment line at 206.520.5000.\n\nWhat types of charges will appear on my bill?\n\nFor transparency, provider (professional) and facility (hospital) charges will be itemized on your bill by your care location. The provider/professional are charges from the care received from your provider. The facility/hospital charges include items such as equipment, supplies, non-clinical staff time, and building costs.\n\nWhere can I call with my financial questions or concerns?\n\nIf you have questions about a bill you have received, please call Patient Account and Support Services at 206.520.0400 or 1.855.520.0400. If you have questions about insurance coverage, please contact your health insurance provider.\n\nDiscount options\n\nPATIENT DISCOUNT PROGRAM\n\nUninsured? Need medical services not covered by your current insurance plan? You may qualify for a 30% discount on your bill!\n\nLearn more about discount details\n\nHaga clic aquí para ver español\n\nUW Medicine is offering self-pay discounts to patients and guarantors who are uninsured or are receiving services not covered by their current insurance plan. Discounts are offered and applied in our billing system for service dates starting July 1, 2020.\n\nThis program is available for services at Harborview Medical Center, UW Medical Center – Montlake, UW Medical Center – Northwest, UW Physicians and UW Medicine Primary Care. UW Medicine recognizes the financial impact healthcare costs can have when you are uninsured or insured with a non-covered service. The discount program highlights our commitment to patients and families when seeking care within UW Medicine.\n\nDISCOUNT STEPS\n\nFollow these steps to make sure you get the best possible savings with our prepay and uninsured discounts. This will allow you to receive both discounts. Be sure to begin the process before you come in for your appointment or procedure.\n\nSchedule your appointment or procedure\n\nContact your provider for the information you will need to request an estimate.\n\nAt least seven days (preferred) before your service, call the Financial Access Clearance Team (FACT) at 206.598.4388 to get an estimate by email or mail. For UW Medicine Primary Care estimates, please ask at the clinic’s front desk or call the appointment line at 206.520.5000. Estimates for patient care may be higher or lower than the actual cost, depending on the patient’s specific needs.\n\nIf the actual patient balance is less than the original estimate, the patient or guarantor will receive a refund for any overage that was paid after the discount was applied.\n\nIf the actual patient balance is more than the original estimate, the patient or guarantor will be billed for the difference. The prepay discount will be applied to the additional charges.\n\nYou have two convenient payment options to pay prior to your service. Your discount will be applied when making your full payment based on the estimate.\n\nPay in person at the location where you are getting treatment.

We've addressed some of the most commonly asked questions here.\n\nAbout the Balancing Billing Protection Act and No Surprise Act\n\nEffective 1/1/2020 Washington state implemented the Balance Billing Protection Act (BBPA) to offer protection from surprise medical bills. Effective 1/1/2022, the Federal No Surprises Act (\"FNSA\"), applies a broader scope of plans and services than Washington's BBPA. Combined they offer transparency and disclosure for individuals seeking medical services.\n\nClick here to learn more about your right to receive a Good Faith Estimate. Under the law, health care providers must give patients who don’t have insurance or who are not using insurance an estimate of the bill for the health care items and services they are about to receive. A Good Faith Estimate provides transparency for the total expected cost when scheduling or upon request.\n\nBalance Billing (also referred to as surprise billing) occurs when an out-of-network provider bills the patient for the difference between the provider's charge and the insurance company's allowed amount\n\nFor disclosure, healthcare facilities and providers are required to provide a list of the commercial health insurer networks in which they participate.
