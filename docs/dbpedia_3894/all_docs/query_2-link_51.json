        "text": "Walz said in 2005 he was ready to serve his nation in \"DC or Iraq\"\n\nGov. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’ vice presidential running mate, refused to drop out of his congressional race in 2005 despite an Army National Guard announcement of a possible deployment, according to a statement from his campaign at the time.\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump’s running mate, accused Walz of ducking service in Iraq when he left the guard and ran for Congress in 2005.\n\nWalz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring in 2005. He launched a campaign for Congress in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District that year and was elected in November 2006.\n\nWalz filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate for Congress on February 10, 2005. The next month, after the guard announced a possible deployment to Iraq within two years, Walz’s campaign issued a statement saying he intended to stay in the race.\n\nWalz retired from the Army National Guard in May 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Service members often submit their paperwork for retirement months before their retirement date. It’s unclear when Walz submitted his papers for retirement.\n\nIn a 2009 interview for the Library of Congress, Tim Walz said he left the Army National Guard to focus full time on running for Congress, citing concerns about trying to serve at the same time and the Hatch Act, which limits political activities for federal employees.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond when asked about when Walz submitted his retirement paperwork.\n\nThis post was updated with excerpts from a 2009 interview with Tim Walz.\n\nWhitmer praises \"good Midwesterner\" Walz in first Democratic ticket rally in Michigan\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer welcomed fellow midwestern Gov. Tim Walz to Detroit on Wednesday, praising Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate selection during the Democratic ticket’s first joint rally in Michigan.\n\nIn addition to Walz being a fellow governor in the Great Lakes region and a “good Midwesterner,” Whitmer said “Tim and I get along because we both lead according to a three part strategy — get sh*t done.”\n\nThe Michigan Democrat said Walz has been an “incredibly successful governor,” in large part because he “works across the aisle to build consensus,” and noted the Minnesota Democrat’s achievements in passing infrastructure legislation, cutting taxes, providing free school lunches and protecting public safety.\n\n“A lot of that sounds familiar. It’s because Tim and I have been trying to outdo one another on all these fronts for the last couple of years,” she joked.\n\nWhitmer repeatedly ruled herself out of Harris’ recent running mate search, saying she intends to serve out her term through 2026.\n\nShe and Walz, along with fellow Midwestern Govs. Tony Evers of Wisconsin and JB Pritzker of Illinois, issued endorsements for Harris nearly in unison the day after President Joe Biden exited the race, in a signal of Democratic support for Harris in the “blue wall” of the upper Midwest.\n\n“We need a strong woman in the White House, and it’s about damn time. And a good man by her side in vice president Tim Walz,” Whitmer said.\n\nRFK Jr. gains ballot access in New Jersey after defeating local challenge\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. qualified for the ballot in New Jersey on Wednesday, the New Jersey Secretary of State ruled, after defeating a challenge to his ballot petition from a local elections attorney.\n\nNew Jersey Secretary of State Tahesha Way ruled on Wednesday to accept Kennedy’s ballot access petition, rejecting a challenge from attorney Scott Salmon arguing Kennedy violated the state’s “Sore Loser Law,” which prevents candidates who ran for office in a primary from seeking that same office in a general election as an independent candidate.\n\nIn the ruling, Way said she believed the Sore Loser Law was inapplicable to Kennedy’s petition because Kennedy — who initially launched his presidential campaign as a Democrat seeking to challenge President Joe Biden in the primary — did not file a ballot petition for the state’s primary or conduct a write-in campaign in the state.\n\nWay wrote that in siding against Salmon, she would accept Kennedy’s nominating petition to appear on November’s ballot in New Jersey.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Salmon said his challenge of Kennedy’s petition helped clarify the limits of the Sore Loser Law in the state, which will benefit his work in future election cases.\n\nIncluding New Jersey, Kennedy qualified for the ballot in 15 states and is eligible to receive 172 electoral college votes.\n\nBiden's team lays out 4-pillar strategy for his final 6 months in office\n\nPresident Joe Biden has tasked his team with coming up with an agenda for his final six months in office, defining key priorities for the administration as he looks to secure a one-term legacy – including a robust schedule on the world stage.\n\nOn a call with political appointees across agencies Wednesday afternoon, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients laid out four main pillars for Biden’s team to execute in a lame duck period, according to audio of the call obtained by CNN.\n\nThe four pillars include:\n\nThe continued implementation of key legislation\n\nLowering costs and growing the economy through additional moves on student debt relief and efforts to bring down prescription drug prices\n\nDefending personal freedoms and civil rights by calling out hate and extremism\n\nEnsuring the US strength, security, and leadership in the world\n\nOn the fourth point, national security adviser Jake Sullivan suggested Biden would keep a busy schedule: “You can expect to see very busy months of activity, of summits and trips to ensure that we do everything we can to leave it on the field,” Sullivan said, adding that there would be “high-level summits both here and abroad.”\n\nBut before that, Sullivan said Biden’s most urgent priority “is to avoid escalation into a larger war in the Middle East and to deliver the ceasefire and hostage deal that he’s worked so hard to deliver.”\n\nZients told the team that Biden encouraged his top lieutenants to form a plan “to finish as strong as we started” on the Sunday that he announced he would not seek a second term.\n\nHarris quiets chants of \"lock him up\" by saying \"the courts are going to handle that part\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris quieted chants from audience members at her rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, on Wednesday calling on former President Donald Trump to be jailed by saying “the courts are going to handle that part” and insisting Democrats focus on defeating Trump in November’s election.\n\nHarris outlined her record as a prosecutor and district attorney in California, and contrasted it with Trump’s legal troubles, including being found guilty on felony charges of falsifying business records and losing a civil suit to E. Jean Carroll, who accused her of sexual assault.\n\n“I know Donald Trump’s type,” she said, prompting loud cheers from the audience. “In fact, I’ve been dealing with people like that my whole career.”\n\nAs the cheers died down, some audience members could be heard chanting “lock him up.” In response, Harris interrupted the chants to clarify that she’s focused on defeating Trump in the upcoming election and insisted Trump’s legal troubles be handled independently.\n\nSome context: The Wisconsin rally is not the first time Democratic voters have chanted “lock him up” at campaign rallies. Hundreds of voters joined in the chant during the Harris rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The chant is an inversion of the pledge Trump made during his 2016 presidential campaign to put then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in jail, which was embraced by supporters at his rallies.\n\nHarris and Walz lean into Midwestern ties while introducing new ticket to raucous Wisconsin crowd\n\nVice President Kamala Harris introduced her new running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to Wisconsin voters at a rally in Eau Claire on Wednesday, playing up his Midwestern roots and stressing the importance of Wisconsin in Democrats’ path to victory.\n\nAddressing a crowd of thousands at an outdoor venue on the outskirts of the small Wisconsin town, Harris and Walz both strongly attacked former President Donald Trump while presenting a contrast between their values and those of the Republican ticket.\n\nWalz spoke ahead of Harris and highlighted his roots in nearby Minnesota, his record of working with Republicans as a member of Congress and his military service, noting “I proudly wore the uniform of this nation.”\n\n“Are there Minnesotans in the house today?” Walz asked, prompting a sizable cheer.\n\nWalz jokingly boasted to the Eau Claire crowd that he knew how to pronounce the name of the town, a quip some locals in the audience responded to with applause.\n\nHarris similarly laid out Walz’s ties to the Midwest, while often referring to him as “coach,” a nod to his past as a high school football coach. In response, the crowd chanted “coach.” Minutes later, the crowd chanted “VP Walz” after Harris referred to Walz as “the next vice president.”\n\nShe also made clear the importance of Wisconsin in the Democrats’ path to victory in November.\n\nThe highly enthusiastic crowd maintained energy throughout the afternoon, buoyed by a performance from native Eau Claire band Bon Iver. The crowd regularly broke out in spontaneous cheers egging on her remarks.\n\nBiden says he doesn’t have confidence in a peaceful transition of power if Trump loses\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Wednesday he doesn’t have confidence there will be a peaceful transition of power if former President Donald Trump loses in November. He pointed to comments from the Republican nominee suggesting the only way he’d lose is if the election is stolen from him.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump warned that if he lost the 2024 election it would be a “bloodbath” for the US auto industry and the country — comments Biden and his campaign quickly leapt on, claiming the former president was inciting political violence.\n\nBiden also warned that Trump was preparing to challenge the election results again in November as he did in 2020, including by putting in place sympathetic local election officials.\n\nThe full Biden interview is expected to air on CBS Sunday morning.\n\nSenate candidate and Iraq War combat vet defends Walz against \"stolen valor\" attacks\n\nDemocratic Senate candidate Ruben Gallego, an Iraq War combat veteran, on Wednesday defended Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz against JD Vance’s accusations that Walz had engaged in “stolen valor” and ducked service in Iraq.\n\n“Stolen valor is very, very serious charge. The vice presidential nominee, someone who I served with, someone who is a veteran, and was the highest ranking … Army-enlisted man to ever serve in Congress, has never claimed anything of that nature,” Gallego told reporters.\n\nGallego, a Marine Corps veteran who was deployed to Iraq in 2005, said, “You know, war is tough. I had some men that decided not to go to war. They had the option. They decided not to take it, and you know, for a lot of them, I don’t blame them.”\n\n“Gov. Walz served his country honorably. And without a doubt, you know he would be an asset as vice president, especially with veterans,” he said.\n\nWalz had left the Army National Guard after 24 years and ran for Congress in 2005, retiring two months before his unit received alert orders to deploy to Iraq.\n\nGallego, who had pushed for Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly to be Kamala Harris’ vice presidential pick, acknowledged that he was “disappointed” Kelly wasn’t selected, but said Walz would be able to represent the working class of the military community and is “still a great pick.”\n\nWhy Michigan and Wisconsin are so important to both parties\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and her new running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are campaigning in Wisconsin and Michigan on Wednesday — key states on the path to the presidency.\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee JD Vance also held events in both states today, underscoring the importance of reaching voters there. Harris is expected to be back in Michigan tomorrow.\n\nDonald Trump won both of those states eight years ago but they have vexed Republicans ever since.\n\nAlong with Pennsylvania, Trump’s stunning 2016 victories in Michigan and Wisconsin produced a seismic crack in the so-called blue wall of states Democrats had relied on in every election going back to 1992. Trump’s particular success with blue-collar voters gave Republicans optimism for a political realignment that could turn the Rust Belt red for the foreseeable future.\n\nInstead, Republicans have struggled to replicate Trump’s initial success in subsequent elections, including in 2020 when Biden narrowly won all three states en route to victory. Democrats in that time also took over the governors’ offices in Michigan and Wisconsin and flipped a Senate seat in Pennsylvania in 2022 which proved crucial to maintaining control of the chamber.\n\nIn both states, efforts to subvert the 2020 election — including by enlisting fake electors — have also roiled Republican politics, at times aided by Trump.\n\nStill, gone are the days when Democrats could comfortably count on these states to deliver in national elections. Biden won Michigan in 2020 by more than 150,000 votes. The margin was much tighter in Wisconsin, where he came out ahead by about 21,000 votes — a victory of about 0.7 percentage points.\n\nVance says Walz left him a voicemail but the two men have not spoken since VP announcement\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said Wednesday that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called him back on Tuesday evening and left him a voicemail, but the two men have not spoken yet.\n\n“It was just a, ‘Hey, thanks for calling, appreciate it, look forward to the debate,’ etcetera,” Vance said when asked what Walz said in his voicemail.\n\nVance was asked whether holding campaign events in the same cities as Vice President Kamala Harris this week was an effective strategy. Vance held an event on Tuesday in Philadelphia ahead of Harris’ event in the city and, on Wednesday, Harris and Vance both had events scheduled in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nVance said one factor his team considered was that local media was going to cover Harris’ trip and that they were looking to have a “counter-narrative.”\n\nVance slams Harris' policies at campaign event in Wisconsin\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee JD Vance slammed Vice President Kamala Harris in remarks in Wisconsin on Wednesday.\n\nVance mentioned that he exited his plane and walked straight over to Air Force Two, which had landed at the same airport just a few minutes before, earlier in the day. Both Vance and Harris are holding rallies in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, today.\n\nVance also said he wants to make more things in America, including energy and food.\n\nHis remarks are taking place at Wollard International, which manufactures both military and commercial belt loaders and tow tractors, as well as other airline equipment. His wife, Usha Vance, was also in attendance.\n\nVance reopens line of attack into Walz’s military record as two veterans now vie to be vice president\n\nDonald Trump’s running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance stepped up his attacks on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s portrayal of his military career, accusing him without of evidence of ducking service to Iraq when he left the Army National Guard and ran for Congress in 2005.\n\nWhile Walz retired two months before his unit received alert orders to deploy to Iraq, the attacks on Walz’s military record are part of the race from both parties to define the relatively unknown governor after he was tapped Tuesday as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate. Walz’s 24-year military service is one of several facets of his background that appeal to voters that the Harris campaign is trying to reach with his selection — and that Republicans are trying to blunt by painting him as an out-of-touch liberal.\n\nWalz and Vance, the two VP candidates who are likely to square off in a debate this fall, are both military veterans, unlike their running mates. Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring in 2005. He launched a campaign for Congress in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District that year and was elected in November 2006.\n\nAt a campaign stop in Michigan Wednesday, Vance accused Walz of abandoning his unit before they deployed to Iraq in 2006.\n\n“When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do and I did it honorably and I’m very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him,” Vance said.\n\nWalz retired from the Army National Guard in May 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Typically, service members need to submit papers several months before they can retire.\n\nA National Guard article on his unit’s deployment states that they received alert orders to deploy to Iraq in July 2005, two months after Walz retired. The unit first mobilized in the fall of 2005 to Camp Shelby Mississippi to prepare for deployment, according to the unit’s history, and then deployed in March 2006 for 22 months, which the Guard said was the longest continuous deployment of any military unit during US operations in Iraq.\n\nWalz filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate for Congress on February 10, 2005.\n\nKeep reading about Vance’s attacks against Walz’s military record.\n\nVance walked over to Air Force Two after both planes landed at same Wisconsin airport\n\nAfter touching down in Wisconsin for a campaign event, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance exited his plane and walked straight over to Air Force Two, which had landed at the same airport just a few minutes before.\n\nVance returned after several minutes and talked to reporters gathered near his aircraft.\n\n“I just wanted to check out my future plane,” Vance said.\n\nThe senator said he did not speak to Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBoth Harris and Vance are holding campaign events this afternoon in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nAfrican American church leaders enthusiastic about Harris-Walz ticket\n\nStanding in the shadow of Dr. Martin Luther King’s grave, African American church leaders said their congregations are excited about Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic presidential ticket.\n\nNearly a dozen faith leaders were at the news conference that took place at Dr. Martin Luther King National Park in Atlanta’s historic Sweet Auburn neighborhood.\n\n“We are standing here today because democracy delivered us, democracy has been our deliverer, and in Donald Trump’s America democracy is not a threat to us — democracy is a threat for him,” Rev. Shanan Jones, who also preached at Ebenezer and is now the President of Concerned Black Clergy of Metropolitan Atlanta said.\n\nBishop Reginald Jackson, the leader of over 500 African Methodist Episcopal (AME) churches in Georgia and who worked on previous efforts to elect President Joe Biden, said the president made a “very, very difficult decision” to not seek reelection, but it was a decision that “put what was best for the nation ahead of himself.”\n\nSince Vice President Harris has taken over the top of the ticket, the pastors said their congregations have found new energy.\n\nHarris-Walz campaign raised $36 million in first 24 hours since running mate announcement\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign raised $36 million in the 24 hours since Vice President Kamala Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, a campaign official said.\n\nHarris made her selection public on Tuesday before the pair appeared for the first time together at an event in Philadelphia.\n\nAt that rally, Walz portrayed himself as both a folksy Midwestern everyman and an attack dog for Harris.\n\nAnalysis: Tuesday's rally was an indication Democrats have moved in a very different direction\n\nTuesday evening’s raucous event introducing Kamala Harris’ new running mate was about as far a cry as her team could have orchestrated from the smaller, quieter events President Joe Biden was holding until he withdrew from the race last month.\n\nThe contrast was notable. Harris’ and Tim Walz’s speeches were laced with humor and delivered with high energy to a crowd many times the size of Biden’s largest events.\n\nWhen Biden was last rallying supporters in Philadelphia, he spoke to a much smaller audience for seven minutes at a church service. At the time, the unscripted speech was seen as a win — if only because Biden made no major errors.\n\nTuesday’s event was a dramatically different affair.\n\nNeither Harris nor Walz dwelled on the record or accomplishments of the Biden administration, focused instead on their opponents and their vision for the country’s future. Absent were any mention of Donald Trump’s threat to Democracy, or his vow to act as a dictator on Day 1 — central themes of Biden’s former campaign.\n\nThe shift in messaging is hardly a surprise for a candidate who entered the race with an implicit mandate to do things differently from Biden, who was struggling to gain traction.\n\nBut the difference in style and substance presented to the American public for the first time Tuesday was an indication that Democrats have moved in a very different direction.\n\nHow a low-key Midwestern governor shot to the top to be Harris’ VP pick\n\nTim Walz was in the midst of his interview with Vice President Kamala Harris’ vetting team when he told them there was something important they needed to know.\n\nHe doesn’t use a teleprompter, the Minnesota governor said. He doesn’t even have one, in fact. So if he was the pick, Walz said, Harris’ team would have to get him a teleprompter and teach him how to use it.\n\nIt was a lighter moment, but it was also part of an interview process with Harris’ team that Walz aced, multiple sources familiar with the meeting told CNN. The Minnesota governor was upfront about his vulnerabilities, noting he wasn’t from a swing state or a household name. He also said he was a bad debater.\n\nBut Walz made it clear he would be a team player.\n\nAsked how he saw his role as VP, Walz said he would perform the job however Harris wanted him to. Asked if he wanted to be the last person in the room before Harris made a decision, Walz said only if she wanted him to be there.\n\nAnd asked if he had ambitions to run for president himself one day, Walz said he did not, a point that sources said was not lost on a team looking to minimize the potential for any internal drama in a future Harris administration.\n\nThe vetting interview was a key step for Walz to ultimately lock up the selection that Harris made after sitting down with the three finalists, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, for one-on-one interviews at her residence on Sunday.\n\nKeep reading here about Harris’ decision to select Walz.\n\nTrump signals openness to debating Harris on a network other than Fox News\n\nFormer President Donald Trump says he expects to debate Vice President Kamala Harris “in the near future” while leaving open the possibility for the debate to take place on a network other than Fox News, a shift from his previous pledge to only debate Harris there.\n\nTrump said in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday he would prefer for a debate between him and Harris to be hosted by Fox News, but suggested his campaign is having conversations with other networks about the hosting a debate as well, while adding the decision is “up to me.”\n\n“I can tell you every network loves me very much right now. They love me very much. I’ve never been so loved by CBS and by ABC fake news… and by NBC. No, they’re all in love with me now, so that, you know, I say yes,” he continued.\n\nTrump added he believes debates “are very important,” and again stressed his preference would be to participate in a debate hosted by Fox News, but said Harris’ unwillingness to agree to a Fox News debate may prevent the network from hosting.\n\n“I’m all for Fox. I’d like to see it on Fox. I think Fox would do a really good job. But two people have to agree,” he said.\n\nThe comments come after Trump, who has accepted a Fox News invitation to appear in a debate on September 4, said in a social media post on Saturday he would only debate Harris on Fox News or “I won’t see her at all.” On Friday, Trump backed out of a planned September 10 debate hosted by ABC News.\n\nWalz steps down as Democratic Governors Association chair\n\nNow that he is Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has stepped down from the Democratic Governors Association, where he had been serving as chair.\n\nAccording to DGA bylaws, because Walz is now a federal candidate, he cannot also serve as the sitting chairman of the umbrella organization for Democratic governors and gubernatorial candidates. Walz had been serving in the role since December.\n\nIn a note sent to DGA staff Monday and confirmed to CNN, DGA Executive Director Meghan Meehan-Draper wrote: “Having the DGA Chair become the VP candidate is a BIG DEAL and a thing to celebrate! His team (Gov. Walz) called me this morning to say ‘We want you to know how important the DGA is to the governor and to our whole team.’”\n\nKansas Gov. Laura Kelly will succeed Walz as chair.\n\nCatch up on key moments from Harris and Walz's first rally as the Democratic ticket\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz introduced himself as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate at a joint rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday, positioning himself as both a folksy populist and a fierce defender of the Democratic ticket.\n\nCatch up on key moments from the rally:\n\nSmall-town background:\n\nThe Tuesday appearance marked the first opportunity for both Walz, a relatively unknown politician on the national scale, and Harris to share his story with voters across the country, from his upbringing in rural Nebraska to his record as governor of the North Star State.\n\nThe pair used their remarks to portray the Minnesota governor as a Midwestern everyman, a high school teacher turned swing-district lawmaker who advanced key Democratic policies since being elected to his state’s top office in 2018.\n\nThe governor described following in the footsteps of his late father — a former educator who served in the Army — first as a member of the Army National Guard and later as a teacher.\n\nMutual praise:\n\nWalz and Harris both commended each other’s records during Tuesday’s rally. Harris said she “found such a leader” in Walz and outlined why she chose him as her running mate. She pointed out his experience coaching high school football, saying that it will influence his ability to serve the country as vice president and that Walz is “more than a governor.”\n\nWalz thanked Harris for “the trust you put in me” as well as for “bringing back the joy.” He said he is “thrilled to be on this journey” with Harris, as well as her husband, first gentleman Doug Emhoff.\n\nPromises made:\n\nHarris pledged that she and Walz will save the Affordable Care Act, and that they’d pass a bill restoring nationwide abortion rights.\n\nOn the economy, perhaps the stickiest issue she will face, Harris promised to fight for the middle class and to bring down prices.\n\nAttacks on Trump and Vance:\n\nWalz said Donald Trump is “too busy serving himself” to serve others and argued that the former president would take the country backward, echoing Harris’ popular stump speech line: “We’re not going back.” Walz also slammed Trump’s record on Covid-19, the economy, abortion and crime.\n\nWalz referenced Ohio Sen. JD Vance’s Ivy League education and declared that he “can’t wait” to debate Trump’s running mate. He repeated his now-familiar line, calling Vance and other Republicans “weird as hell.”\n\nHarris took her own jab at Vance, comparing the records of the two parties’ running mates. “It’s like a matchup between the varsity team and the JV squad,” she said.\n\nRead more about today’s campaign rally here."
