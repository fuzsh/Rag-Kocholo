        "text": "Britney Spears gets \"Toxic.\" (YouTube)\n\nTroy L. Smith, Cleveland.com\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- In some cases, it's been 17 years and you still can't get it out of your head: Those one-liners, that mesmerizing hook, the image of the video that came with it.\n\nThese are the pop songs that have defined the 21st Century; the tunes that were all over the radio, MTV and YouTube. They've stood the test of time and are here again, in all their glory, to remind you of better times.\n\nLaFace\n\n40. Pink - \"So What\" (2008)\n\nPink made her name as a hitmaker through her defiant and rebellious attitude. That was never more apparent than on her No.1 hit \"So What.\" The Max Martin-produced, empowerment anthem embodies everything Pink is by helping her through a breakup and setting up the second stage of her career.\n\nFueled by Ramen\n\n39. Twenty One Pilots - \"Stressed Out\" (2015)\n\nThe members of Twenty One Pilots might seem like unlikely stars, but the Columbus duo is now one of the biggest rock acts in the world. Much of that comes from their hyper catch No.1 album “Blurryface” and its single “Stressed Out,” which earned Twenty One Pilots a Grammy Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.\n\nParlophone\n\n38. Kylie Minogue - \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" (2001)\n\nDuring the early 2000s, Kylie Minogue was releasing the kind of timeless dance pop jams that now populate mainstream radio. If her inescapable hit \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" has a distinctive 1990s vibe, that's because it was co-written by Cathy Dennis, the singer behind \"Touch Me\" and \"Why.\"\n\n\\\n\n37. M.I.A. - \"Paper Planes\" (2008)\n\nM.I.A.'s \"Paper Planes\" was a standout from the rapper/singer's complex sophomore album \"Kala.\" Fans and other artists latched on to the infectious track that would eventually earn a Grammy nomination for Record of the Year. T.I. and Jay Z later flipped the hook for another hit \"Swagga Like Us.\"\n\nD\n\n36. Christina Aguilera - \"Beautiful\" (2002)\n\nPrior to the release of \"Beautiful,\" Christina Aguilera was lumped in with the rest of the early 2000s TRL-friendly songstresses. But \"Beautiful\" was her diva moment. The song, written by Linda Perry, established Aguilera as one of the strongest voices in music.\n\n\\\n\n35. The Weeknd - \"Can't Feel My Face\" (2015)\n\nCall it the 2015 version of “Your Love Is My Drug.” With “Can’t Feel My Face,” Abel Tesfaye, aka The Weeknd, elevated himself to superstar status. He’s remained there ever since.\n\nOctone\n\n34. Maroon 5 - \"This Love\" (2002)\n\nIt became the blueprint for any pop-rock band looking to make a splash. \"This Love\" is as flawless as a pop song gets. Adam Levine and company channel their inner Stevie Wonder for a song that established the band as one of the biggest artist of the last 15 years.\n\nEleven\n\n33. Gotye feat. Kimbra - \"Somebody That I Used to Know\" (2011)\n\nFor a moment in time, Gotye (along with Kimbra) delivered a simple, indie-pop masterpiece that was unlike any breakup anthem that came before it. The song rightfully earned a Grammy for Record of the Year.\n\n0\n\n32. Blink-182 - \"All The Small Things\" (2000)\n\n\"All the Small Things,\" and its boy-band parody video, elevated Blink-182 to stadium status. The track was quite simply the best pop-song Blink had ever written and remains the band's biggest hit.\n\nYMCMB\n\n31. Drake - \"Hold On, We're Going Home\" (2013)\n\nDrake’s best songs are often his most simplistic. With help from singing duo Majid Jordan, “Hold On, We’re Going Home” cascades along like it’s scoring a dream you never want to end.\n\nCash Money\n\n30. Nicki Minaj - \"Super Bass\" (2011)\n\nWhen the two sides of Nicki Minaj's personality - the clever rapper and underrated pop singer - merge effectively, the results can be amazing. \"Super Bass\" is Nicki Minaj's best song because it lays the perfect groundwork for her attractive personality and frenetic flow, highlighted by a killer hook.\n\nDef Jam\n\n29. Justin Bieber - \"What Do You Mean?\" (2015)\n\nJustin Bieber’s album “Purpose” was so well received, it’s easy to forget just how much of a comeback effort it was. The single “What Do You Mean?” captivated listeners and proved The Biebs wasn’t just a tabloid disaster.\n\nColumbia\n\n28. Pharrell Williams - \"Happy\" (2013)\n\nIn all honestly, \"Happy\" began as a youthful anthem aimed at young moviegoers, as it was attached to \"Despicable Me 2.\" But it quickly took on a life of its own with Pharrell's neo-soul anthem inspiring various YouTube parodies thanks to its clap-happy beat and universal theme of joy.\n\nBig Machine\n\n27. Taylor Swift - \"Blank Space\" (2014)\n\nNot everything on Taylor Swift’s “1989” worked as she officially made the crossover from country to pop. But when you have infectious songs like “Blank Space,” who cares. Produced by Max Martin and Shellback, “Blank Space” amounts to a perfect pop song and one the finest things T-Swift has ever released.\n\nIsland\n\n26. The Killers - \"Mr. Brightside\" (2003)\n\nThe Killers' sound has evolved into a mix of indie and pop rock over the years. But the band made a name for itself by injecting new wave influences into pop songs like \"Mr. Brightside,\" a track that's only become more iconic.\n\nCapitol Records\n\n25. Katy Perry - \"Teenage Dream\" (2010)\n\nSongs like \"California Gurls\" and \"I Kissed a Girl\" established Katy Perry as hitmaker. But \"Teenage Dream,\" produced by Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco and Max Martin, was on a different level. The song encapsulates every stellar aspect of mainstream radio, from its power-pop hook to its timeless retro vibe.\n\nInterscope\n\n24. Gwen Stefani - \"Hollaback Girl\" (2005)\n\nNo Doubt released memorable singles over the past decade and a half. But front woman Gwen Stefani made her biggest impact going solo with the phrase \"This s*** is BANANAS.\" \"Hollaback Girl\" was essentially an updated version of Toni Basil's \"Mickey,\" only with much more attitude thanks to the Neptunes.\n\nCapitol Records\n\n23. Sam Smith - \"Stay With Me\" (2014)\n\nBritish singer Sam Smith made a name for himself overseas with stunning vocals on dance anthems. But the amazing ballad \"Stay With Me\" was the song that made him a superstar in the United States and helped him conquer the Grammys with a duel win for Song and Record of the Year.\n\nJive\n\n22. NSYNC - \"Bye Bye Bye\" (2000)\n\nThe video, with its memorable choreography, certainly helped. But, at it's core, \"Bye Bye Bye\" is the kind of perfectly constructed pop-hit every pop star was searching for. Released at the start of 2000, NSYNC's anthem signified a peak in the TRL era.\n\nColumbia\n\n21. Daft Punk feat. Pharrell Williams - \"Get Lucky\" (2013)\n\nDaft Punk surprised some fans with the disco focus of \"Random Access Memories.\" But what should have come as no surprise was just how great everything sounded, led by \"Get Lucky,\" an enjoyable anthem with added touches from Pharrell Williams and Chic's Nile Rodgers.\n\nHollywood Records\n\n20. Miley Cyrus - \"Party in the U.S.A.\" (2009)\n\nBefore her \"Wrecking Ball\" days, Miley Cyrus received a gift from Jessie J. The British singer-songwriter handed \"Party in the U.S.A.\" over to Cyrus, who took it and ran with it. The song became a global hit and showcased Cyrus' underrated range as a singer.\n\nUniversal\n\n19. Nelly - \"Hot In Herre\" (2002)\n\nBefore Drake or Flo rida, there was Nelly, a hip-hop artist who knew how to craft a hit with ease. In retrospect, \"Hot in Herre\" might seem gimmicky, but its pop-rap vibe provided the kind of club anthem that was inescapable.\n\nAtlantic\n\n18. Ed Sheeran - \"Thinking Out Loud\" (2014)\n\nWith “Thinking Out Loud,” Ed Sheeran created a wedding song for the ages. Decades from now, people will be falling in love to it, maybe not even knowing who sang it or where it came from. It’s truly timeless.\n\nDef Jam\n\n17. Rihanna feat. Jay Z - \"Umbrella\" (2007)\n\nCrafted by the hit-making duo of Terius \"The-Dream\" Nash and Tricky Stewart, \"Umbrella\" was the vehicle that drove Rihanna to international superstardom. It helps when your boss Jay Z's delivers a memorable guest appearance only topped by the sounds of \"Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh.\"\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n16. Gnarls Barkley - \"Crazy\" (2006)\n\nThe dynamic duo of Danger Mouse and CeeLo Green wasn't supposed to be a pop sensation. But \"Crazy\" just couldn't help itself. The neo-soul anthem, highlighted by Danger Mouse's electronic drums, took indie and mainstream circles by storm and landed atop Rolling Stone's list of the best songs of the 2000s.\n\nIsland\n\n15. Amy Winehouse - \"Rehab\" (2006)\n\nAmy Winehouse's \"Black to Black\" was a retro-soul masterpiece, highlighted by its massive single \"Rehab,\" which earned the singer Record and Song of the Year honors. Even years after its release, producer Mark Ronson remained in awe of Winehouse. As did millions of fans.\n\nJive\n\n14. R. Kelly - \"Ignition (Remix)\" (2003)\n\nIt may be the greatest remix of all-time (Do you even remember the original?). \"Ignition (Remix)\" was R. Kelly's biggest hit since \"I Believe I Can Fly,\" and has become his trademark song. It's genius lies in the bounce happy chorus with brilliant lines about sipping on Coke and rum, and screaming \"So what, I'm drunk.\"\n\nIsland\n\n13. Mariah Carey - \"We Belong Together\" (2005)\n\nHad Mariah Carey ended her career prior to 2000, she still would have had one of the greatest resumes ever. Yet, 2005's \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" and its monster single proved she wasn't finished. Billboard would list \"We Belong Together\" as the \"Song of the Decade\" and one of the 10 most popular singles in chart history.\n\nArista\n\n12. Usher feat. Lil Jon and Ludacris - \"Yeah!\" (2004)\n\nOf all the singles on Usher's monster album, \"Confessions,\" \"Yeah!\" was the most inescapable, thanks to a club-friendly beat from Lil Jon and a perfect guest appearance from Ludacris. The song ranked as Billboard's second biggest single of the decade and went platinum four times over.\n\nRepublic Records\n\n11. Lorde - \"Royals\" (2013)\n\nLorde and \"Royals\" came out of nowhere in 2013. The song, which amounts to a mesmerizing display of art pop, blends a sense of vulnerability with swagger. \"Royals\" earned Lorde a Grammy for \"Song of the Year\" and has made her next album one of the more anticipated releases of the next year or two.\n\nAftermath\n\n10. 50 Cent - \"In Da Club\" (2003)\n\nThe stars aligned for 50 Cent in early 2003, as \"In Da Club\" cemented his unlikely rise to fame. The key to the track's huge success was the infectious Dr. Dre beat, driven home by clever lines from \"Fiddy.\" The song was so popular most people know both the explicit and radio-edited versions by heart.\n\nFueled By Ramen\n\n9. fun. feat. Janelle Monae - \"We Are Young\" (2011)\n\nFun. lead-singer Nate Ruess wrote \"We Are Young\" after the worst drinking night of his life. It must have been some hangover. Ruess' vocal style, similar to that of a Broadway star, made \"We Are Young\" and unlikely hit that could fill stadiums.\n\nJive\n\n8. Britney Spears - \"Toxic\" (2004)\n\nSay what you will about Britney Spears ability as a singer and songwriter, but her swagger was unmatched. \"Toxic\" remains her most infectious song, from the stunning production of Sweden's Bloodshy & Avant to perfect melodies crafted by Cathy Dennis. Britney never sounded this good again.\n\nJive\n\n7. Justin Timberlake - \"Cry Me a River\" (2002)\n\n\"Cry Me a River\" wasn't just a high point for Justin Timberlake. It was also Timbaland's most impressive beat, taking the producer from dominance on the hip-hop charts to the forefront of pop. The song, written in response to Britney Spears cheating, is epic in every sense. You don't want it to end.\n\nInterscope\n\n6. Lady Gaga - \"Bad Romance\" (2009)\n\n\"Bad Romance\" is not only an epic dance-pop anthem. It's also the quintessential Lady Gaga song. \"Bad Romance\" is a monumental track that encompasses everything Gaga is known for, from her over the top melodies and persona to a mesmerizing hook you never want to end.\n\nShady/Aftermath\n\n5. Eminem - \"Lose Yourself\" (2002)\n\nJust a handful of hip-hop songs fully embody what it means to be an emcee. Eminem's \"Lose Yourself\" is one of them. The track from \"8 Mile\" was Em's first No.1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and earned him both a Grammy and Academy Award.\n\n\\\n\n4. Adele - \"Rolling in the Deep\" (2010)\n\nWhen Adele released \"Rolling in the Deep,\" the lead single from \"21,\" all bets were off. The track's retro-soul vibe blew your hair back. It swept the Grammys and remains one of the best vocal performances you will hear on a pop record.\n\nColumbia\n\n3. Beyonce feat. Jay Z - \"Crazy in Love\" (2003)\n\nThe pop diva and the bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks proved to be a Lady and the Tramp story for the ages. \"Crazy In Love's\" mix of funk, hip-hop and R&B gelled perfectly. Beyonce's stunning voice and Jay Z's swag conquered the French horn driven sample of the Chi-Lites \"Are You My Woman.\"\n\nLaFace\n\n2. Outkast - \"Hey Ya!\" (2003)\n\nWhen news came Big Boi and Andre 3000 would be helming separate discs for \"Speakerboxxx\"/The Love Below,\" fans were anticipating what Andre 3000 had to offer outside of the confines of the group. The result was \"Hey Ya!,\" the duo's biggest hit and a funkdafied pop-anthem your grandparents could get down with.\n\nJive\n\n1. Kelly Clarkson - \"Since U Been Gone\" (2004)\n\nYou could take any good singer from any decade of music and put them on \"Since U Been Gone\" and the song would be a hit in that era. That's no disrespect to Kelly Clarkson, who certainly delivers a flawless vocal performance. It's more a nod to Max Martin and Dr. Luke, the two biggest pop hitmakers of the last 15 years. The song's versatility and soaring power-pop helped it cross over genres, borrowing from alt-rock and R&B to deliver the perfect pop song for the modern era."
