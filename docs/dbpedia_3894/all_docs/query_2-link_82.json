        "text": "Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Before we dive in, our readers would love to learn a bit about your “origin story”. Can you tell us the story of how you grew up?\n\nI’m happy to be here. Thank you!\n\nI grew up in a small Saskatchewan town called Kipling, where I was one in a population of 1100. I went to school and graduated there. It was a pretty simple time — there were no cell phones, so I’d have to call my friends at home to meet up with them at the playground on a Saturday. We’d leave for the day and come home for supper. My parents wouldn’t see me for a few hours until it was home time.\n\nThat being said, I also loved to sing and play on my own a lot. I enjoyed being a homebody and still do today. I was also very reflective and loved to look up at the stars at night with wonderment. In looking back now, I realize that I was a dreamer. I loved spending time on my uncle and auntie’s farm in the summer with my cousin. I loved to hear the AM radio in their house playing country music in the background. The radio made it really feel like home since mom and dad always had country radio on in the house as well.\n\nWhat inspired you to pursue a career in music, and how did your journey begin?\n\nWhile I don’t think I realized in the moment exactly what I was doing or why, there were a number of things along the way that pushed me in the direction of music.\n\nGrowing up, I would walk to school and sing songs or make them up. I really loved to sing — whether it was in church, school plays, or my parents’ basement. I was obsessed with new music, so I would go to the local Radio Shack, purchase a new album on cassette tape, listen and learn all the words, and then have a “concert” by myself in my parents’ basement, imagining I was a big star. It was fun!\n\nIn my teen years, someone caught wind that I could sing, and I was asked to join a band. We played the local pool parties before I joined a second band at 16. I couldn’t play an instrument at the time (other than trombone), but my bandmate Shayne taught me how to play guitar. In this band, we also started writing our own songs. We were an eclectic group of musicians and singers, and I was somewhat of an outcast. We sang everything from country to rock and I think there were some metal songs, which I did not participate in. After a couple of years, the band found a more suitable singer for the type of music they wanted to do, and I was kicked out. It was my first instance of rejection on my musical journey. I was devastated as I felt that this was my identity and the only thing that ever made me feel valued by others.\n\nAbout a year later after high school, I thought to myself that I didn’t need to be part of a band, and that I could be a solo act. It had never dawned on me before, so I started researching producers and joined SaskMusic, where there were some helpful tips for getting started.\n\nFrom there, I began performing on my own and I was asked to open for Brad Johner — a prominent country artist — in the neighbouring town of Windthorst, Saskatchewan. The show went so well that Brad invited me to open for any of his upcoming shows that I was available for. It was an incredible feeling of acceptance and an amazing opportunity. In getting to know Brad, I met his longtime producer, Bart McKay, who was also part of his band. I started recording with Bart and releasing songs while simultaneously putting together a band. I went through a few musicians until I found a core group of players that stuck around and played with me for about 15 years afterwards. I am forever grateful to them for their dedication and friendship.\n\nAs for inspiration, it almost feels like it just happened. With the singing, joining bands, and just the feeling of performing, I think music made me feel accepted by others in school where I didn’t particularly feel popular. I was accepted into the music community and found my people.\n\nCan you tell us the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?\n\nThere have been a lot of exciting things along the way, but the most interesting is that I was recruited for a reality show in 2016. After I played the Songwriters’ Series at Canadian Country Music Week — a milestone performance for me — some industry professionals reached out to my manager to see if I would be interested in being part of the show. Essentially, many of these competitions have some talent recruited so they can have a show with performers they feel could do well. I signed a waiver that I would not disclose what show it was. I was working a regular job doing electrical work on the road at the time. The show’s producers would reach out to my manager, Leslie, and ask that I submit specifics type of songs: original, cover, ballad, fast song, etc. I assumed that they were testing my versatility. There I was, in my hotel room each night, belting out another song to my iPhone to impress these people I had never met. It came down to me and another act for the show. They selected the other act. One of those “almost” moments.\n\nIt has been said that sometimes our mistakes can be our greatest teachers. Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?\n\nWhen I first started trying to get on the radio and make a career of music, I thought I had all of the answers and was making something special at the time. I was working with Bart McKay — a multiple CCMA Award-winning Producer of the Year — and performing more while building a new band with some songs that people close to me thought were good. I wasn’t co-writing with others because I believed I was a good enough songwriter — I was clearly young and arrogant.\n\nTo this day, I still have a box full of CDs in my basement. I was wrong, I didn’t have great songs and the CDs were not flying off the shelves. It wasn’t until I started to co-write that I realized the importance of branching out and getting a fresh pair of ears and eyes on a song. I love to co-write to this day. It’s always exciting, surprising and best of all, I get to connect with great people and create something together.\n\nNone of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?\n\nThere are so many. As they say, “it takes a village”.\n\nMy parents, my wife Erin for her support and encouragement, producers like Bart McKay, Johnny Gasparic and Chris Burke-Gaffney, Troy Kokol setting me up with my first group of co-writes in Nashville, Brad Johner giving me that confidence I needed early on, Jasper Anson working in my corner, and my band.\n\nI’ll pick one — Leslie Mitchell.\n\nLeslie and I started working together in 2015. Things were heating up for my career at the time and she was starting to manage artists. I had never felt so sure of myself as an artist with Leslie pushing me and believing in me. It’s hard for me to describe how valuable it was to have a cheerleader in my corner like that. Through her, I secured some amazing shows, did my first official radio tour, enjoyed songwriting trips to Nashville, secured a publishing deal and pitched my songs to major artist labels. Two labels put holds on my songs. Even though it was a business arrangement, Leslie and I are still close. We no longer work together but because we’ve remained friends after services were rendered and payments had been made, that tells me that she truly believed in me and that it wasn’t purely transactional like many music “friendships” can be. In saying this, I understand that for some people, music is a business. It’s important to treat it like that, but how you treat people matters just as much.\n\nWhat are some of the most interesting or exciting projects you are working on now?\n\nWithout a doubt, my upcoming album is an absolute passion of mine. It’s as exciting as it is scary to me. It’s vulnerable and the truest project I have been a part of to date.\n\nI felt like my producer, Chris Burke-Gaffney, and I really focused on the writing and melody so that the songs were cool yet accessible to the audience. It’s a shift in direction for me and that is the scary part. I took a brief hiatus from music that started with the pandemic and then some major life changes which pulled my focus elsewhere, but music has always been a part of my life and always will be. The album project has brought me much joy in the writing process but as I try to navigate from a commercial country sound into more of a singer-songwriter focus, it has been a challenge since the majority of my listeners are more familiar with my previous work. I am up for the challenge and when I am not, my publicist Jasper Anson has been there to talk me down from the ledge.\n\nWe are very interested in diversity in the entertainment industry. Can you share three reasons with our readers about why you think it’s important to have diversity represented in music, film, and television? How can that potentially affect our culture?\n\nIt’s important on several levels for the needs, wants, values, and struggles of others to be seen and heard in entertainment.\n\nFirst, there’s a learning opportunity. The diverse experiences of others will be different in some ways than our own and in some cases, they might be similar. This allows us to learn from each other’s differences and similarities.\n\nSecondly, it promotes a wider awareness and acceptance of diversity. As a dad, I want my daughter to grow up in an environment that is diverse and accepting of others. One way to achieve this is by discovering diversity through arts and entertainment.\n\nLastly, I feel as though bringing more diversity to the entertainment industry will lead to greater artistic innovation and original ideas.\n\nAll of these are positive — and necessary.\n\nAs a successful music star, you’ve likely faced challenges along the way. How do you stay motivated? How do you overcome obstacles in your career?\n\nIt’s easy to get caught up in comparing yourself to others. I was very consumed by that habit. Anytime I saw someone get a better opportunity or do something great, I would get jealous and feel bad about myself. It was toxic.\n\nI look back now and see that I had my own insecurities that I was dealing with. The truth is that the people I was comparing myself to were working just as hard as me and deserved every bit of success and recognition. I used to come at it from a selfish approach that kept me from progressing even further in my own career. It’s a waste of energy. Now I’m genuinely happy for other artists.\n\nAnother obstacle for me to overcome was radio. I’ve had some good reviews of my singles from music directors, and I’ve had some bad reviews. It’s hard not to take it personally since they’re criticizing your personal creations. It’s a tough thing to hear sometimes, but not everyone is going to connect with my music. I remember some harsh comments throughout the years and at some point, I decided not to let opinions detract from my love of something I created.\n\nWhen I run into these situations, it’s more productive to remember why I got into music in the first place and everything that I love about it. That keeps me motivated to continue.\n\nWhat are your “5 things I wish someone told me when I first started” and why?\n\n1. Develop thick skin.\n\nNot everyone is going to like your music. It is tough and the market is saturated with people who are in different situations than you.\n\nAfter I released my first single, my ability to take criticism was tested. I had sent out the song “The Open Road” as my first single back in 2005 or so. It was off a 3-song EP. My brother designed my website, and my sister was taking my promo photos at the time. I got some local radio play and feedback, but it was tough to hear that my song wasn’t being added. I probably landed airplay on 10 local stations as a new artist at the time and the other 240 passed on my song. It was heartbreaking to me back then.\n\nI was focusing on the wrong thing — the ones that didn’t add my song rather than the ones who were giving me support. I was grateful to those stations, but I had a tough time dealing with the disappointment from the other ones. I learned to get used to the feedback and understand where it was coming from. These are people with jobs — trying to get by — who have opinions about music. It’s the way the music world works.\n\nSince then, I’ve had a Music Director tell me to my face that my song “Little Bit of Sunshine” was “not changing anyone’s life, but I’m not turning off my radio” while another told me at Canadian Country Music Week to “release something good and we’ll start playing your songs” and yet another said that my song “Take it Out on Me” was misogynistic. These have clearly stayed with me, but they don’t control my career. Now with everything being more online, criticism is even more commonplace. As artists, we just need to get used to it.\n\n2. Do it for yourself.\n\nDo it because you love music. If you’re doing it for all the wrong reasons, you’ll likely attract the wrong things.\n\nI found that once I stopped focusing on fame and impressing people, things began to turn around for me. All of the things I wanted so badly didn’t come to me (money, awards, connections) until I focused on the reason I got into music in the first place; because I love to sing, create, and entertain. Things will come naturally over time.\n\n3. Treat it like a business.\n\nWhile your music might feel like a fun hobby, it must function as a business if you want success.\n\nI believe that success in the music industry is made up of four things: being in the right place at the right time, who you associate yourself with, talent, and drive. I’m convinced that what you put in, you get back. In essence, you make your own luck and that’s what will help you hit that next level. Take it seriously.\n\nOnce I learned this for myself, my typical days shifted towards a greater focus on business-minded activities like researching radio stations and venues, setting up calls and meetings, and creating opportunities for my music to be heard and my live show calendar to fill up.\n\n4. Put yourself out there.\n\nWhile it’s competitive, the music industry can also be a very welcoming community. Join local organizations and get involved if you can. You’ll learn a lot and you’ll meet some great people.\n\nUntil I was involved in the Saskatchewan Country Music Association and the Canadian Country Music Association, I did not have much success on my own. I thought people would just find me. This was not the case. Connect with others.\n\nI am an introvert, and this has been my biggest weakness throughout my career. People want to collaborate and make friends. You can learn a lot by connecting with people who love music just as much as you do. Nothing beats that sense of community.\n\n5. Enjoy the journey.\n\nPlay the long game but also be present.\n\nIt sounds simple but I used to get caught up in “the big picture” and thinking too far ahead. I remember even saying “I’m always looking towards the next thing” in interviews. I didn’t take the time to appreciate what I was doing in the moment. I was appreciative of people along the way, venues that booked me and players that wanted to spend time with me on stage. Until recently, though, I never really stopped to think what a gift it was when others would come to shows, book the band or be part of my live shows. It’s pretty cool. I only wished that I stopped and smelled the roses just a bit more along the way.\n\nCan you share some insights into your creative process? How do you approach songwriting? How do you approach musical collaborations?\n\nOften, I will come up with a catchy line to write around. At that point, I’ll sit down with the guitar, strum a few chords together and mumble some melody lines that sound pretty to my ears. I’ll jot down the idea on my phone or record a quick voice note. In fact, for my new album, I had notes upon notes and voice recordings over the last few years that I had forgotten about or never explored further. That was helpful when putting the album together. That’s where it starts.\n\nFor collaborations, I find that it is helpful to come prepared with a couple of ideas and potentially part of a song written. If I’m helping another artist, I usually ask for recordings of a couple of songs they would like to work on. I’ll then choose the one that feels right for my style or that I can easily resonate with. Having been in writing rooms where we start from scratch, I’ve found we often muscle around for too long trying to connect and, in many cases, it can be tough to make progress in one session. These days, I enjoy the back-and-forth collaboration before getting into the room together.\n\nYour music has resonated with so many fans worldwide. What do you believe sets your music apart?\n\nI believe that I’ve always been able to balance lyrical integrity with melodic appeal.\n\nAs one example, my song “South of the City” tells a story but also has a catchy melody. It’s accessible without limiting the lyrics or reducing them to a trendy form of pop-country writing.\n\nWith my newest project, I have refined this process even further by really connecting my lyrics with something that is pretty to the ears of listeners. This is my approach to writing now.\n\nHow do you connect with your audience?\n\nDuring live shows, I’ve always approached it with the mentality that I am creating moments for them, not for me.\n\nI like to sing with soul and passion but make sure that there are ebbs and flows in the setlist. This can build my connection with the audience and send them home having had a blast or having been touched by the songs.\n\nAs an artist, I think it’s also important to remember the business side of things and realize that your live show is your product (as well as your recordings), so you’re selling that live show with what you bring to the performance and how people respond.\n\nWith your busy schedule and demanding performances, how do you prioritize self-care and maintain a balance between your personal life and career in the music industry?\n\nBeing a first-time father and having a busy life makes this difficult. I do prioritize my personal time because we need to take care of ourselves before we take care of anyone else.\n\nIn my case, I get up early in the morning before anyone in the house. I work out, journal, and meditate. I fit those things around my schedule along with daily walks and eating healthy. All of that helps give me the energy I need to chase around my two-year-old. I also try to prioritize sleep. Ultimately, putting my phone down for some engaging quality time with my daughter and wife is a form of self-care for me.\n\nYou are a person of enormous influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)\n\nWith the development of social media, I feel like the world has become more divided even though we are more globally connected than ever before. At the same time, many of us who feel so divided are also extremely privileged.\n\nSocial media can have tremendous power when it’s used for positive action, so I would want to heal some of that division by focusing the attention elsewhere on global initiatives that will make a difference — like helping the poor, starving, and homeless. The more we care about each other, the better off we’ll all be.\n\nIs there a person in the world, or in the US whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this, especially if we tag them. :-)\n\nWithout a doubt, it would be Vince Gill.\n\nSince I was a child, I have been a fan of his and people have often compared my singing voice to his. A greater compliment does not exist.\n\nI have seen him live twice — first in Nashville at 3rd and Lindsley, and then in Saskatoon with The Eagles. About a week after my daughter was born, I got the green light to go to the concert. I got the closest tickets I could afford and Googled which side of the stage he usually plays on with The Eagles. Both shows were incredible.\n\nIf you hear Vince in interviews, he is a genuine and kind human, a mentor in the industry with such a storied music career. I could go toe to toe with any Vince Gill fan on this planet about him. Watch George Jones’ funeral where Vince sings his classic “Go Rest High on That Mountain” with Patty Loveless. It’s the pinnacle performance of that song and I love the fact he breaks down. To me, professionalism is also being human.\n\nVince Gill is also not one of those artists that gets caught up in fame and fortune. In fact, he usually golfs in his downtime rather than drinking and partying. Very respectable and he’s all about the music. He is the GOAT.\n\nHow can our readers continue to follow your work online?\n\nPlease find me on all digital streaming platforms or on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.\n\nThis was very meaningful, thank you so much! We wish you continued success!"
