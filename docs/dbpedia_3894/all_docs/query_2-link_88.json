        "text": "Many of us grew up with Smokey Bear, who turns 80 this week , educating us on forest fire prevention. We still remember the story of the rescued bear, who survived a wildfire and became an icon. As adults, we have more pragmatic warnings and strategies in place, and everyone must be aware and proactive in prevention.\n\nWhile the ground may be moist from recent rain, the brush and dead trees beneath the mountain greenery are dry and can become kindle wood for the slightest spark. A fire can ignite from lightning strikes, which we can do little about, but the manmade causes of wildfires are preventable.\n\nWe experience increased fire danger from the unnatural buildup of shrubs and debris, which can fuel larger and more intense blazes. In addition, our county has suffered tree-beetle infestations, which have created tall, dry fire-starters, regardless of damp soil conditions.\n\nSome will say that wildfires are nature’s way of clearing dead brush, and that’s true, but that doesn’t make it less deadly and it doesn’t include unintended and preventable manmade fire hazards. We must, therefore, balance the benefits of letting some fires burn and protecting others from spreading to communities where the risk of loss is greater, particularly that of life.\n\nA three-stage warning system has been developed to save lives.\n\nStage 1\n\nProhibiting campfires, wood-burning stoves, charcoal grills, and other open flames, including smoking, except in enclosed buildings and vehicles, and any type of explosive material, including fireworks or other pyrotechnic device. Exceptions include permanent fire pits with grates, in developed recreational areas, and lanterns using gas or jellied petroleum or pressurized liquid fuel.\n\nThere are also restrictions on using equipment that generates a spark. Welding and other open torch tools may be exempt with permits that include restricted use, like having a chemical pressurized fire extinguisher nearby, at least one 35-inch shovel, and a 10-foot clearing, away from combustible material, including grasses and dry brush.\n\nStage 2\n\nAll of the restrictions of Stage 1 plus … no fires, even in developed campgrounds and picnic areas, any internal combustion engine (e.g., chainsaw, generator, ATV) without a spark arresting device, and any fuses or blasting caps, rockets, exploding targets, tracer rounds (remember the Lake Christine Fire ), and other spark-generating or incendiary objects, and agricultural burns (except by permit). Also prohibited is the use of off-road motor vehicles, except in areas devoid of vegetation within 10 feet of the roadway, and in developed campgrounds and trailheads. Exhaust sparks can trigger a blaze.\n\nStage 3\n\nClosure, except to authorized personnel, to eliminate the potential for human-caused fire hazards.\n\nRed flag warnings\n\nThese are issued when temperatures are high, humidity is low, and winds are strong. It’s the perfect trifecta for sparking a wildfire.\n\nDuring a red flag warning, there may be an actual wildfire in progress or ideal conditions for wildfire development, where even the slightest spark can cause massive devastation. That spark may come from many sources, including a lightning bolt, your barbeque grill, or even a passing car, to name a few.\n\nWildfire safety is not limited to forests … our homes need protection, too.\n\nHome safety\n\nFireproofing your home may slow down the progress of a fire, allowing time for firefighters to arrive. With many of us living in rural areas, a fire can arrive at our home very quickly. While there are new materials in homebuilding that inhibit fires, most of us live in existing structures that may not include these precautions.\n\nIt’s also wise to pack a go-bag in case of evacuation. It should contain essentials, including copies of important papers, prescriptions including over-the-counter medications, clothing, non-perishable food, water, eyeglasses, emergency blankets, electronic chargers, AM/FM crank radio, cash, pet necessities, and personal hygiene.\n\nOutdoors\n\nCreate a fireproof barrier around your home, of up to 100 feet. The use of gravel and concrete on driveways and patios helps create a break. Flame-resistant plants can also slow down approaching flames; ones low in resin with high moisture content are best. Notice areas that are uphill toward your home. Regularly clear out undergrowth and check for flammable items in storage sheds and garages.\n\nIf you have a gated entrance and there is a Stage 2 warning in effect, leave the gate unlocked to allow easier access for emergency vehicles.\n\nRoofs and siding are best if made of tile, metal, concrete, stone, brick, or stucco. If you have a wood roof, be sure to paint the shingles with a fire-resistant treatment. Install double-paned windows with metal, rather than wood frames. Clean out debris from gutters, which can ignite from nearby sparks. Trim tree limbs around power lines. When constructing an outdoor deck, instead of wood, consider concrete, brick, or stone, for fire resistance.\n\nIndoors\n\nKeep candles away from curtains; even a slight breeze can catch a spark. Don’t drape anything over light bulbs — their heat can ignite.\n\nIn the mountains, it still gets chilly at night; never run space heaters unattended. Dryer lint is a leading cause of home fires; clean it out regularly. Do not overload plugs — check the voltage of extension cords and never run them under rugs. Check the integrity of electrical cords; it’s cheaper to replace them than to tape a crack that can overheat and start a fire. Install fire alarms and check batteries regularly. Keep a fire extinguisher nearby, you may need several to adequately cover your home. A rescue ladder upstairs can be a lifesaver.\n\nEagle County has a fire mitigation team that will do a free wildfire assessment on your home.
