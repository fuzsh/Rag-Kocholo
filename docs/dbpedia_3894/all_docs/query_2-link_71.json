        "text": "Nas and Jay-Z\n\nTupac Shakur vs. The Notorious B.I.G.\n\nThe feud between Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. is the standard-bearer for every hip-hop conflict since. Not only did it involve possibly the two greatest rappers of all time, but it served as a microcosm for a larger East Coast vs. West Coast/New York vs. Los Angeles rivalry.\n\nBiggie, who was raised in Brooklyn, and Pac, who was headquartered in L.A., met for the first time in 1993. They became friends; later that year, they performed together at Madison Square Garden in New York.\n\nBy 1994, the partnership had deteriorated. Pac was ambushed and shot in Times Square on his way to record with Big. He accused Biggie and Puff Daddy, Big’s manager, of involvement. Later in the year, Biggie released “Who Shot Ya?” which was widely interpreted as a Tupac diss.\n\nIn 1995 the feud became the focal point of a long-simmering coastal beef dating back to at least 1991. Suge Knight, the CEO of L.A.-based Death Row Records, took shots at Puff Daddy’s label, Bad Boy Records, at that year’s Source Awards in New York. He later signed Pac and bailed him out of prison. Pac jumped on several tracks attacking Bad Boy artists, including Big. Toward the end of the year, West Coast group Tha Dogg Pound came under fire while filming the music video for “New York, New York” in NYC.\n\nThe beef reached its violent zenith in September 1996, when Tupac was tragically killed in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas. Six months later, Big was murdered in a shooting in L.A. Both artists were in their artistic primes.\n\nNas vs. Jay-Z\n\nFor a time, the intracity rivalry between Jay-Z and Nas appeared destined to end like the beef between Pac and Big: in tragedy. Thankfully, this feud was resolved without bloodshed.\n\nThe seeds of dispute were planted in 1996, when Nas failed to appear at a recording session for Jay's legendary debut album, Reasonable Doubt. Nas's sophomore record, released weeks after Jay's debut, included at least one line \"inspired\" by his rival.\n\nThe beef took another step in 1997 when Jay-Z anointed himself New York City's best MC following the death of The Notorious B.I.G. In 1999, Jay-Z associate Memphis Bleek took aim at Nas, and in 2001, Jay ripped into the Queensbridge product on \"Takeover,\" a track from his sixth album The Blueprint.\n\nNas's response? Possibly the greatest diss track in hip-hop history, \"Ether.\" The vicious attack took aim at Jay-Z's full Roc-A-Fella roster and was seen as a knock out blow on the streets. Not one to go down quietly, Jay responded with \"Supa Ugly,\" a deeply personal response that earned the rapper a public reprimand from his own mother.\n\nThen, things got quiet. There were a couple diss tracks here and there, a couple subliminal jabs, but it seemed like both rappers had fired their best shots. The hip-hop community looked elsewhere for entertainment (see below) until 2005 when, on the East Rutherford, New Jersey, leg of Jay-Z's \"I Declare War\" tour, Nas joined his rival on stage to squash the beef. The duo performed \"Dead Presidents\" and \"The World Is Yours,\" and everything was right in the hip-hop universe.\n\n50 Cent vs. Ja Rule\n\nThe masterpiece of 50 Cent's illustrious feuding career is his twenty-year beef with Ja Rule. The origins of the feud are disputed: Did 50's associate snatch Ja's chain in 1999? Or did Murder Inc. turn 50 away from a video shoot in Queens?\n\nWe may never know, and at this point it doesn't matter; the pair's legacies are hopelessly intertwined. 50's first major hit, \"Wanksta,\" was inspired by Ja Rule, and Ja's 2013 rebuttal, \"Loose Change,\" earned him rare street approval. For a brief moment in the early- to mid-2000s, this beef was the hottest thing in hip-hop.\n\nToday, it has become tiresome. 50 continues to needle Ja over a variety of topics, including the disastrous Fyre Festival, and in 2018 Ja ranted extensively about 50 on Twitter. The winner, it seems, will be whoever lives longest.\n\nDrake vs. Meek Mill\n\nDoes Drake write his own raps?? That's the question that sparked one of the greatest ever international rap beefs, a feud that roiled the hip-hop industry from its inception in 2015 to its official squashing four years later.\n\nIt started with a Tweet from Meek Mill: \"Stop comparing drake to me too... He don't write his own raps!\" The accusation set off a flurry of finger-pointing and threats. Before long, Drake's supposed ghostwriter, Atlanta rapper Quentin Miller, was unmasked and weighed in. Drake's longtime producer and collaborator, Noah \"40\" Shebib, framed the Toronto native as more than a rapper, and therefore not beholden to the codes and customs that shaped the community.\n\nAnd then came the diss tracks. Drake released \"Charged Up\" in July 2015 and, before Meek had opportunity to respond, \"Back to Back.\" By the time Meek unleashed \"Wanna Know,\" the damage was done. Drake became known as a formidable opponent in a feud, despite his reputation for softness.\n\nWith the release of Meek Mill's \"Going Bad\" featuring Drake in 2019, this beef was officially squashed.\n\nN.W.A. vs. Ice Cube\n\nThe release of N.W.A.’s debut album, Straight Outta Compton, was a watershed moment in hip-hop history. The record cemented Los Angeles as a hip-hop powerhouse on par with New York and pioneered a fledgling subgenre that would eventually become known as “gangsta rap.” It’s standout track, “Fuck tha Police,” is as relevant and impactful today as it was more than 30 years ago.\n\nUnfortunately, Straight Outta Compton’s success didn’t keep N.W.A.’s members from feuding. Less than two years after its release, Ice Cube left the group over royalty disputes. He filed a lawsuit against the band’s manager, struck out on his own, and immediately found solo success with AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted, his 1990 solo debut.\n\nCube avoided taking shots at his former bandmates on Most Wanted, but N.W.A. was less kind. Their follow-up to Compton, 100 Miles and Runnin’, and their 1991 album, Efil4zaggin, both contained multiple disses. Cube responded the same year with “No Vaseline,” a five-minute tirade featured on his second full-length release, Death Certificate.\n\nBy 1993, the rest of N.W.A. had disbanded and the feud was over. Ice Cube appeared in the video for Dr. Dre’s “Let Me Ride,” and the next year they recorded “Natural Born Killaz” for the soundtrack of Snoop Dogg’s film Murder Was the Case. In 2000, Dre and fellow N.W.A. alum MC Ren appeared on Cube’s album War & Peace Vol. 2 and a song for the Next Friday soundtrack.\n\n50 Cent vs. The Game\n\nAbove all else, 50 Cent is a businessman. Even in the mid-2000s, when his street cred was at its apex, fans wondered about the credibility of the rapper’s beef with West Coast rival The Game. Was it a media ploy to boost record sales?\n\nOfficially, the feud started not long after The Game was placed in G-Unit by Aftermath Entertainment boss Dr. Dre. G-Unit was involved in a slew of running beefs, most notably with Ja Rule and his Murder Inc. label, and 50 Cent wasn’t happy with Game’s lack of participation. He also believed he wasn’t getting enough credit for his work on Game’s debut album, The Documentary.\n\nThe situation quickly escalated. Shots were fired outside the Hot 97 studio in New York, injuring a member of The Game’s crew. After a brief truce, both sides unleashed a flurry of diss records, with Game’s 14-minute “300 Barz and Running” being the piece de resistance.\n\nThe feud eventually ran out of steam, and 50 and The Game squashed it for good at the Ace of Diamonds Strip Club in Los Angeles in 2016.\n\nCardi B vs. Nicki Minaj\n\nHow times have changed. In the 90s and early-2000s, rapper confrontations took place at recording studios and on street corners. By 2018, they were playing out at the Harper's Bazaar's New York Fashion Week Party. That's where Cardi B threw her shoe at, and allegedly attempted to assault, Nicki Minaj.\n\nThe heel-hucking incident was the boiling-over point for a feud that had been simmering for years beneath a lid of media denials. The New York rappers had appeared on songs together and tweeted love back and forth, but couldn't escape rumors of a beef. Cardi took subtle shots at Nicki over her verse on Migos' \"Motorsport,\" then denied any bad blood in interviews. Nicki said she was hurt by the comment, but insisted the dispute was a media creation.\n\nThe NYFW melee proved that where there's smoke, there's fire. The pair have been openly hostile ever since. They exchanged insults on radio shows and Instagram videos. Shoemaker Steve Madden got involved. The 2018 New York gubernatorial race became a battleground. There appears to be no end in sight to this bitter rivalry.\n\nLil Wayne vs. Birdman\n\nThe several-years-long feud between Lil Wayne and his father-figure/manager Birdman was almost a New Orleans tragedy. For years, Bird nurtured Wayne to stardom, helping him become one of the most successful and influential rappers of his generation. But by 2015, their relationship was in pieces. Wayne accused Bird of refusing to release his 12th studio album, Tha Carter V, and dissed his mentor on Sorry 4 the Wait 2, the mixtape he released to make up for the missing album. He also filed a lawsuit alleging money mismanagement and threatened to leave Bird’s Cash Money Records with rising stars Drake and Nicki Minaj.\n\nIn July 2015, the feud reached its darkest hour. Prosecutors allege that Bird and new protégé, Young Thug, conspired to murder Lil Wayne, an unthinkable suggestion given their once inseparable bond.\n\nSomehow, Bird and Wayne managed to squash their beef in the past several years. As of February 2020, the New Orleans duo have put the past behind them and are continuing their working relationship.\n\nThe Roxanne Wars\n\nIn 1984, New York City rap trio U.T.F.O. released \"Roxanne, Roxanne,\" a track about a woman who ignored their advances. The song was a hit.\n\nThe same year, U.T.F.O. cancelled an appearance on a show promoted by NYC legends Mr. Magic, Marley Marl, and Tyrone Williams. The duo recruited 14-year-old Lolita Shante Gooden - a.k.a. Roxanne Shante (pictured) - to record a diss track. The Marley Marl-produced \"Roxanne's Revenge\" was also a hit.\n\nU.T.F.O. responded by enlisting The Real Roxanne for their answer track, and the Roxanne Wars were born. Other artists got involved and as many as 100 songs were recorded before the city-wide feud eventually simmered down.\n\nThe Bridge Wars\n\nIn 1985, producer Marley Marl and rapper MC Shan released \"The Bridge,\" an ode to their home borough of Queens and the Queensbridge Houses in particular. Unfortunately, some members of the wider hip-hop community misinterpreted the lyrics as a claim that Queens was the birthplace of hip-hop.\n\nThe next year, KRS-One of Boogie Down Productions released \"South Bronx,\" an answer record that insisted hip-hop was born in the Bronx. Thus began the Bridge Wars.\n\nBefore long, the beef got personal. Members of Marley Marl's Juice Crew responded to \"South Bronx\" with \"Kill That Noise,\" and KRS-One trashed the entire crew on \"The Bridge is Over.\" Other members of the Bronx, Queens, and even Brooklyn hip-hop communities eventually jumped in.\n\nThe overarching feud was officially squashed in 2007, when KRS-One and Marley Marl collaborated on the album Hip-Hop Lives. But bad blood runs deep, and MC Shan and KRS-One never put their personal beef behind them. In 2016, Shan recorded a three-minute diss track, and KRS responded with the brutal, deeply personal song \"[S.H.A.N.] Still Huggin A Nut.\" Old habits die hard.\n\nEminem vs. The Source\n\nFifty-year-old petulant child Eminem has been involved in numerous feuds during his career, but none were as vicious or more personal than his beef with The Source magazine and its co-founder, Benzino.\n\nThe once-friendly relationship (Eminem was the first white rapper to appear on the cover) turned sour after The Marshall Mathers LP received a middling review. Eminem voiced his displeasure; Benzino released a diss track; Eminem responded.\n\nThe beef heated up in 2003 when Benzino released \"Pull Your Skirt Up,\" in which he took credit for Em's meteoric success. Eminem replied with \"Nail in the Coffin,\" a devastating diss eviscerating Benzino on a range of sensitive subjects.\n\nThe shit truly hit the fan when Benzino published an unreleased track on which Eminem made derogatory remarks about black women. Em was forced to apologize publicly, but Benzino somehow got the worst of the exchange. He and The Source parted ways soon after.\n\nLauryn Hill vs. Wyclef Jean\n\nSome of the most painful feuds emerge from once-close relationships, including the bitter dispute that led to the breakup of The Fugees, one of the greatest artistic collaborations of the past several decades. The group's second album, The Score, was a massive hit, a timeless masterpiece that straddled the borders between rap, hip-hop, R&B, and rock.\n\nA third album never arrived. Lauryn Hill temporarily left the group before The Score's 1996 release, most likely due to her turbulent romantic relationship with bandmate Wyclef Jean, who was married. The next year, Hill started seeing Bob Marley's son, Rohan. She became pregnant and, according to Jean's memoir, lied to him about the child's paternity.\n\nFrom Purpose: An Immigrant's Story: \"In that moment something died between us. I was married and Lauryn and I were having an affair, but she led me to believe that the baby was mine, and I couldn't forgive that.\"\n\nThe group didn't officially disband until 2007, but it was never able to recapture the artistic mastery it found on The Score.\n\nLil' Kim vs. Foxy Brown\n\nFoxy Brown and Lil’ Kim coexisted for as long as possible: they were friends in high school; they appeared together on magazine covers; they even collaborated on songs in the early stages of their careers, despite affiliations with rival crews.\n\nBut by the release of their debut albums in 1996, the relationship was strained. In 1997, a planned joint album was cancelled. In 1999, the media accused Foxy of ripping Kim’s style. Diss tracks emerged, with Kim jumping on Mobb Deep’s “Quiet Storm (Remix)” and Foxy responding on Capone-N-Noreaga’s “Bang, Bang.” A shootout took place outside Hot 97 in New York, allegedly in response to Brown’s lyrics.\n\nThe dispute between these one-time friends has never been resolved. Today, Lil’ Kim refuses to acknowledge Foxy Brown’s existence.\n\nIce Cube vs. Common\n\nRap feuds were all the rage in the mid-90s - even Common got involved! His 1994 track “I Used to Love H.E.R.” bemoaned hip-hop’s devolution from conscious, politically minded music to straightforward gangsta rap. Ice Cube, one of the godfathers of the gangsta rap movement, took offence and dissed Common on “Westside Slaughterhouse,” which appeared on Mack 10’s eponymous debut album. Common replied with “The Bitch in Yoo” in 1996, on which he trashed Ice Cube’s post-AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted output.\n\nBy the next year, the beef was permanently squashed. Cube and Common came together at Chicago’s Nation of Islam Headquarters and put their differences aside. Ice Cube has called the beef a “dark time” in his career, more a misunderstanding than a hateful dispute. Ultimately, it should serve as a tribute to cooler heads, a landmark of grown-man maturity.\n\nTrippie Redd vs. Tekashi 6ix9ine\n\nLiving-troll-doll-turned-star-witness Tekashi 6ix9ine has feuded with numerous members of the respectable rap establishment, including YG, Meek Mill, Rich the Kid, Chief Keef (not smart), and Future. He’s also feuded with Trippie Redd.\n\nIn 2017, the pair released a song together: “Poles1469.” Soon afterwards, Redd became aware of allegations that 6ix9ine had sexually assaulted an underage girl. He immediately denounced the rainbow-haired rapper, and the two traded jabs over social media. Later in the year, Redd was attacked in New York City. He blamed 6ix9ine, who eagerly embraced the allegation.\n\n6ix9ine was attacked in Los Angeles the following year, and accused Redd of also being a pedophile due to his relationship with vulgar child Bhad Bhabie. When 6ix9ine was incarcerated in November 2018, Redd celebrated over social media.\n\nPredictably, given 6ix9ine’s unique ability to leverage beefs into social media clout, this feud is far from squashed.\n\nDrake vs. Pusha T\n\nIt took years for the beef between Drake and Pusha T to reach its climax. The rappers exchanged subtle shots during the latter’s beef with Lil Wayne, put it wasn’t until Pusha released “H.G.T.V.” that the animosity took shape. Drake responded with “Two Birds, One Stone” in 2017, and Pusha jumped on the Drake-uses-a-ghostwriter train with “Infrared” the next year.\n\nPerhaps unwisely, Drake released “Duppy Freestyle” days later. It was a solid response, one that briefly bolstered the Canadian’s feuding credibility, but it did nothing to soften the blow from Pusha’s unforgettable comeback.\n\n“The Story of Adidon” is one of the most withering and ruthless diss tracks of the last decade: it exposed Drake’s secret lovechild; the cover art features Drake in blackface; and it even contained brutal shots at Drake’s long-time collaborator, 40, who suffers from multiple sclerosis.\n\nMost recently, Pusha appeared to target Drake on a leaked Pop Smoke track. Young Thug, who was also featured, wasn't happy with Pusha for reigniting the beef on a song by the recently-deceased New York rapper. He took to Instagram to express his displeasure, and Pusha fired right back. This beef continues to roil the rap world.\n\nKool Moe Dee vs. Busy Bee\n\nThe 'beef' between Kool Moe Dee and Busy Bee was less a war than a single, spectacular battle. The year was 1981 and Busy Bee was performing in front of a packed house at Harlem World in New York. During the set, he took aim at a variety of rival rappers, calling them out by name and proclaiming his superiority.\n\nOne of those rappers, Kool Moe Dee, happened to be in the crowd and wasn't ready to let the insult slide. After Busy's raucous set, Kool Moe took the stage and ripped into the previous performer in an unforgettable freestyle. The one-night-only feud is among the first rap battles in history.\n\nMase vs. Cam'ron\n\nMase and Cam’ron have a long history. They played high school basketball together at Manhattan Center and rapped under the monikers Murda Mase and Killa Cam alongside Big L in the group Children of the Corn.\n\nBy the time Mase was ready to make his first hip-hop comeback in 2004, there was no love between the two. Cam’ron and Dipset crony Jim Jones phoned into a Hot 97 interview with Mase to lob insults and challenges his way. Mase and Cam then exchanged a long series of diss tracks over more than a decade, culminating in Mase’s extremely personal “The Oracle.”\n\nIt’s hard to gauge the state of the relationship today. Mase has declared himself the winner of the feud; Cam might disagree. The two have bickered on social media in recent years, but further escalation seems unlikely.\n\nGucci Mane vs. Young Jeezy\n\nIs there a more dangerous rapper alive than Gucci Mane? Sure, the ultra-fit persona he’s adopted since his release from prison revolves around positive vibes and sobriety, but let’s not forget that this is the same man who fought off four attackers in his home – naked – and left one of them dead. Prosecutors agreed that he acted in self-defence and the murder charges were dropped.\n\nThe man Gucci killed was Pookie Loc, an affiliate of Young Jeezy, also a rising Atlanta rapper. In 2005, Jeezy and Gucci were involved in a high-stakes dispute over royalties from their song “Icy.” The killing should have put an end to the beef, but the artists traded lyrical barbs until 2009, when DJ Drama brokered an uneasy truce. Three years later, tempers flared again over Jeezy’s feud with Rick Ross. Let’s hope this beef never returns to mid-2000s levels.\n\nMC Lyte vs. Antoinette\n\nMC Lyte is a trailblazer. In 1988, she became the first solo female rapper to release a full-length album, Lyte as a Rock. But her elevated perch in the hip-hop hierarchy didn’t stop her from clashing with rivals. On Lyte as a Rock, she took aim at Antoinette, whose debut single “I Got An Attitude” sounded a little too similar to “Top Billin,’” a track by Lyte’s labelmates Audio Two.\n\nAntoinette wasn’t intimidated by the rap icon. She responded with “Lights Out, Party Over.” MC Lyte came back with “Shut The Eff Up! (Hoe),” and Antoinette had the final word with “Unfinished Business.”\n\nAlthough short-lived, the clash between Antoinette and MC Lyte carried on the proud tradition of female-powered rap beefs established by the Roxanne Wars.\n\nBig Boi vs. Killer Mike\n\nGo ahead and file this short-lived beef under the “cooler heads prevailed” label. This is another example of mature individuals – eventually – handling their differences in a calm, measured manner.\n\nThe feud erupted in 2006 when Killer Mike became disillusioned with Big Boi’s Purple Ribbon label, to which he was signed. He left under disputed circumstances: Big Boi said he let him walk; Mike says he dipped despite Big Boi’s objections. Not long after, a member of Big Boi’s entourage confronted Mike. Punches were thrown, a gun may have been pulled, but no blood was shed.\n\nBoth sides have since moved on. By 2008, the relationship was repaired, and two of the most insightful and talented rappers in the game are back on friendly terms.\n\nThree 6 Mafia vs. Bone Thugs-N-Harmony\n\nIn the early 1990s, two of the most innovative rap groups of all time, Cleveland’s Bone Thugs-N-Harmony and Memphis’s Three 6 Mafia, clashed in a brief, bitter feud.\n\nAt the center of the beef was a timeless complaint: Three 6 thought Bone Thugs had stolen their utterly unique style. In reality, the two groups had been developing distinct, if somewhat similar, sounds for several years. But in those days, it was unusual to hear developmental work from artists outside your bubble. How could Three 6 have known that Bone Thugs had been experimenting with their sound since the late 80s?\n\nThe two groups soon squashed the beef and collaborated on a Project Pat album in the late 90s. In recent years, DJ Paul has called the clash a misunderstanding, and Juicy J chalked it up to the stupidity of youth.\n\nGucci Mane vs. Waka Flocka Flame\n\nIn 2013, Gucci Mane shocked the world (or at least the part of the world that follows Atlanta trap music) when he announced that Waka Flocka Flame, his close friend and collaborator, was dropped from the 1017 Brick Squad label.\n\nMystery still surrounds the inciting incident. What could have caused the fracture between two close allies? Days after the announcement, Gucci doubled down in an interview with Sway on MTV Jams. Later that year, he filed a lawsuit against Waka, Waka’s mom, and a slew of former collaborators.\n\nBy 2014, it appeared Waka and Gucci had resolved their issues; three years later, Waka released “Was My Dawg,” a diss track aimed at his former mentor. Then, in 2018, long after Gucci had reshaped his public image (and body), the Atlanta kingpin announced on Streetz 94.5 that the duo was cool again. Could we see another Ferrari Boyz record in the future??\n\nMobb Deep vs. Tupac Shakur\n\nWhen you think about rap beefs, you think about Pac vs. Biggie. But Notorious wasn’t Pac’s only rival. The late hip-hop legend was embroiled in a number of secondary feuds, perhaps most notably with New York heavyweights Mobb Deep.\n\nThe Mobb Deep-Tupac beef was one of many battle lines in the far-reaching war between hip-hop’s East Coast and West Coast communities. It reportedly started when members of Pac’s Outlawz group were snubbed at a Mobb Deep concert. Tupac unleashed fury on the duo: he attacked them on “Hit ‘Em Up,” “When We Ride on Our Enemies,” “Bomb First (My Second Reply),” and “Against All Odds.” Mobb Deep replied with “Drop a Gem on ‘Em” from their 1996 album Hell on Earth.\n\nHavoc and Prodigy may have been unwilling participants in this particular feud. In a discussion with Jack Thriller, Havoc said they never met Tupac and were, in fact, fans.\n\nLL Cool J vs. Canibus\n\nToday, LL Cool J is a cordial figure, a smiling mound of human who seems profoundly happy with his success. Good for him! It’s fun to remember, though, that LL was a pretty ferocious MC in his day, a side he gleefully showed in his long-lived feud with Canibus.\n\nRemember Canibus? Me neither. But he was a central figure in a beef that spanned almost two decades. It started in 1997 when LL thought Canibus dissed him on his own track, “4, 3, 2, 1.” LL responded on the same song.\n\nIn 1998, Canibus released a blunter insult with “Second Round K.O.,” his only Top 40 single, and Cool J returned fire on both “The Ripper Strikes Back” and “Back Where I Belong.” The pair squashed their beef at the Christmas in Brooklyn event in 2014.\n\nThe Migos vs. Joe Budden\n\nJoe Budden has built a reputation on incendiary comments and questionable cultural takes. The man who first achieved mainstream fame with his 2003 banger “Pump It Up” now spends his days eviscerating the new generation of hip-hop stars. In 2017, his main adversary was Migos.\n\nThat June, Budden interviewed Quavo, Takeoff and Offset on the BET Awards red carpet. The clip went viral. Budden’s co-host DJ Akademiks repeatedly asked Takeoff why he was left off the group’s breakout hit “Bad and Boujee.” Takeoff pushed back, and Budden unceremoniously walked off set. Things immediately got heated.\n\nLater in the year, Quavo took shots at Budden on “Ice Tray” off the Quality Control: Control the Streets Volume 1 compilation album. Budden responded on Everyday Struggle and on Twitter.\n\nIt was the younger heads that eventually took the higher ground in this feud. Quavo told Apple’s Beats One host Ebro Darden that the group harbored “no hard feeling with Joe,” and in December of last year the beef was officially squashed when Budden posted a picture of himself and Quavo on Instagram, #Love.\n\nDrake vs. Chris Brown\n\nDrake and Chris Brown seemed like a natural fit in the early stages of their careers. Both veered more towards R&B than rap and had aspirations of acceptance within the rap community. In 2010, the pair performed together, recorded together, hit the club together, and sat courtside together at ball games.\n\nBy late 2011, cracks in the relationship had emerged around Brown’s ex, Rihanna. Rumors circulated that Brown and Drake were no longer on good terms. The almost simultaneous releases of Drake and Rihanna’s “Take Care” and Brown and Rihanna’s “Birthday Cake” complicated matters further.\n\nIt all came to a head in June 2012 at the WIP club in New York. The musicians’ entourages tossed bottles at each other and exchanged words. Brown suffered a minor injury.\n\nThe crooners have had an on-again-off-again relationship since then. They were in the studio together and shot a skit for the ESPYs in 2014, but Brown took Meek Mill’s side in his beef with Drake in 2016. By 2018 the bromance was back in bloom, and in 2019 Drake appeared on Brown’s song “No Guidance.”\n\nThe odd person out in this feud? Rihanna. It’s unclear how Drake justifies his relationship with Brown considering the latter’s history of domestic abuse against a woman he professes to care about.\n\nStormzy vs. Wiley\n\nThere’s no rule that says rap beefs are for North Americans only. Possibly the most bitter ongoing hip-hop feud is playing out across the Atlantic, in England, where grime veteran Wiley rang in the New Year with two diss tracks: “Eediyat Skengman 1” and “Eediyat Skengman 2.”\n\nStormzy, the new king of London’s uber-popular grime scene, responded with “Disappointed,” on which he called his elder a crackhead, and later with “Still Disappointed.”\n\nThis beef was actually born from a separate UK conflict. In late 2019, several rappers – Dot Rotten, Aitch, Jay1, P Money, Skepta – exchanged insults and accusations of flow-stealing. Wiley was also involved, and brought Stormzy into the mix by mentioning him alongside singer Ed Sheeran in an offhand remark.\n\nWe’re still in the early stages of this beef; there are plenty more indecipherable British attacks on the horizon.\n\nLL Cool J vs. Kool Moe Dee\n\nWhenever we talk about an aging or established celebrity, it’s easy to forget that they, too, were once up-and-comers. Take LL Cool J, for example. Today, he’s one of rap’s kindly grandpas; in the late ‘80s, he was the new kid on the block, a brash phenom with a penchant for getting under older heads’ skin.\n\nKool Moe Dee was one of those older heads. He and MC Shan thought LL had jacked their style, and Moe didn’t like LL’s refusal to pay homage to his predecessors. So, in timeless rapper style, he took a shot at the youngster on “How Ya Like Me Now.” The rivalry that ensued lasted decades, with the high point being LL’s seminal hit, “Mama Said Knock You Out.”\n\nDr. Dre vs. Luke and others\n\nIn 1993, Dr. Dre’s cultural influence was nearing its apex. He was an originator of the G-Funk sound sweeping the airwaves from coast to coast, and a prominent figure in the simmering East Coast vs West Coast feud. That year, he released “Fuck with Dre Day (And Everybody’s Celebratin’),” featuring Snoop Dogg, which was a direct response to New York rapper Tim Dog’s “Fuck Compton.”\n\n“Dre Day” was not only a commercial success – it reached number eight on the Hot 100 – but it contained blunt shots at a variety of targets, including former collaborators Eazy-E and Ice Cube, the aforementioned Tim Dog, and Luke (pictured) from the 2 Live Crew.\n\nLuke took the insult to heart. He responded with “Cowards in Compton,” a track recorded alongside JT Money and Clayvoisie. The video parodied Dre’s stint with the World Class Wreckin’ Cru and featured Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg lookalikes. Luke’s album, In The Nude, also included a skit titled “Dre’s Momma Needs a Haircut.”\n\nDre got the last laugh, though: “Dre Day” appeared on Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, the ultimate honor.\n\nMC Eiht vs. DJ Quik\n\nEven while the East Coast vs. West Coast beef reached its boiling point in the mid-90s, a parallel feud was playing out in Compton. MC Eiht of Compton’s Most Wanted and renowned producer/rapper DJ Quik traded vicious shots from 1992 until the turn of the century.\n\nIt started when Quik subtly dissed CMW and N.W.A. on his debut mixtape, The Red Tape, and was inflamed by the pair’s gang affiliations: Quik was a member of the Bloods; Eiht was a Crip. The rappers exchanged a series of diss tracks until mid-1996, after which they were silenced by the fallout from Pac and Big’s deaths. The feud was officially squashed in 2002, and the pair have collaborated several times since.\n\nYG vs. DJ Mustard\n\nProducer DJ Mustard and rapper YG, two of the most recognizable names in the new wave of Los Angeles artists, briefly feuded in the mid-2010s. The beef was a major setback for both men: Mustard was instrumental in creating YG’s sound, and YG’s success helped propel Mustard to his current, hit-making stature.\n\nOn an interview with The Breakfast Club, YG insisted the beef was a natural byproduct of the pair’s growing notoriety. Success changes people, and for a solid two years the duo was at odds. There were fights over money, and no Mustard beats appeared on YG’s sophomore album, Still Brazy.\n\nAfter exchanging barbs on social media, the pair eventually met in real life and, according to a YG interview on Hot 97, punched each other in the face. Now, they're back to making hits. Let that be a lesson to us all.\n\nASAP Rocky vs. SpaceGhostPurrp\n\nIn the early 2010s, when ASAP Rocky and the ASAP Mob were shifting from Harlem obscurity to international superstardom, a South Florida rap collective called Raider Klan was charting a parallel course. Headed by rapper SpaceGhostPurrp, the group had an affinity for slowed down beats, distorted lyrics, progressive fashion, and lean, much like their neighbors to the north.\n\nSince then, Rocky has become a critical darling while Purrp has remained in relative obscurity. Rocky has acknowledged that Purrp helped him hone his production skills; Purrp maintains his influence was a key to Rocky’s success.\n\nThis feud is far from squashed. In March 2020, Purrp unleased an unprovoked Twitter tirade against Rocky, predictably calling into question the star’s sexuality. It remains to be seen how this one will end.\n\nFrench Montana vs. Young Thug\n\nIn April 2020, French Montana said in an interview with Complex that he might outshine Kendrick Lamar if the they ever shared a festival stage. A dubious claim. Later, on Twitter, he clarified that he wasn't taking shots at the L.A. wordsmith; he simply believed that he had more hits. He doesn't.\n\nKendrick didn't respond, so Young Thug jumped in on his behalf. He took to Instagram to blast French in a series of videos. French fired back with a picture of Thug in a dress - an odd rebuttal given Thug donned a flowing blue gown on the cover of his 2016 mixtape, Jeffery.\n\nThug and French exchanged shots for several days. Gunna chimed in on behalf of his frequent collaborator and fellow Atlantan. French suggested Thug should focus on his beef with 21 Savage, a beef that, according to Thug, doesn't exist.\n\nThrough it all, Kendrick remained silent.\n\nJadakiss vs. Beanie Sigel\n\nAt the same time that Jay-Z and Nas were feuding in 2001, Jay-Z’s Philly-bred protégé, Beanie Sigel, was engaged in an almost-as-vicious beef with Jadakiss and his Yonkers-based crew, The Lox.\n\nJay-Z might be the root cause of this beef. He replaced Jadakiss on two high-profile remixes – Mya’s “The Best of Me” and then R. Kelly’s “Fiesta,” which was released in 2001. Later that year, Beanie fired the first official shots in the war on his track “Beanie (Mack B***h).” Jadakiss replied almost immediately on “Un-hunh” off Kiss the Game Goodbye. Beanie responded on a Roc-A-Fella mixtape, and Jada came right back on Street Wars: The Problem Child.\n\nThe feud intensified late in 2001 when Jada dissed Beanie in a freestyle at an event in Beanie’s hometown. Beanie heard about the diss, headed for the venue, jumped on stage, and responded with his own acapella. Later, Beanie delivered his own freestyle disses on Rap City, and then on Hot 97.\n\nEventually, the feud simmered down. Beanie left Roc-A-Fella and later fired shots at his ex-boss while a member of 50 Cent’s G-Unit. His beef with Jada was officially squashed in the mid-2000s, when the pair appeared together on DJ Khaled’s debut album.\n\n50 Cent vs. Young Buck\n\nIf there’s one lesson to be learned from this list, it’s that you shouldn’t get too close to 50 Cent. Whether you’re a rival or a labelmate, 50 is always ready for beef.\n\nYoung Buck is walking, breathing endorsement of this lesson. He was an early member of G-Unit who featured prominently on the group’s mixtapes and videos. But by 2008, he was in 50’s bad books. He didn’t appear on the mixtape Return of the Body Snatchers, and in April, 50 unceremoniously dropped him from the group on Hot 97. Just months later, 50 leaked a recorded conversation in which Buck pleaded for forgiveness, and Buck responded with the diss track “Taped Conversation.”\n\nAfter several years of calm, 50 reignited the feud in 2019 by claiming Buck had a relationship with a trans woman. Since then, the G-Unit boss has released a string of transphobic and homophobic comments, interspersed with petty disses about Buck’s financial situation. The latest shot in the feud came from Buck, who said in 2020 that 50 didn’t want his G-Unit artists to match his solo success.\n\nEminem vs. Machine Gun Kelly\n\nThis was the beef that rocked trailer parks across the nation, a sizzling feud that divided people who bleached their hair 20 years ago and people who bleach their hair today.\n\nOfficially, it started when Eminem, the only retirement-aged whiny teen in America, dissed Cleveland rap waif Machine Gun Kelly on the song “Not Alike” off Kamikaze. Unofficially, it started six years earlier, in 2012, when Kelly tweeted that Eminem’s daughter was hot.\n\nKelly’s response, “Rap Devil,” suggested, perhaps truthfully, that Eminem is old and uncool. Em’s almost-instantaneous rebuttal, “Killshot,” claimed that Kelly was untalented and incapable of matching his success. Probably also true.\n\nNobody was really sure who won this beef until last year, when Young Thug declared on Instagram that Kelly had “murdered” Em. Case closed.\n\nRoyce da 5'9\" vs. D12\n\nRoyce da 5’9” and Eminem have worked together for decades, since their respective beginnings in the Detroit rap scene. That didn’t stop Royce from feuding with Em’s D12 collective in the early 2000s. The diminutive rapper released three diss tracks against the squad: “Shit On You,” which focused on D12 member Bizarre; “Malcolm X”; and “Death Day.”\n\nD12 responded with “Smack Down,” and member Proof (R.I.P.) added the solo track “Many Men.” He also collaborated with the Purple Gang on a third diss track, “Beef is Ova.”\n\nThe feud culminated in a confrontation outside a Detroit nightspot. Proof and Royce’s entourages clashed and the two rappers were arrested. They were placed in adjacent cells where they managed to squash the dispute. After a brief flareup in 2007, the beef was officially called off in 2008 when Royce appeared on two D12 mixtapes.\n\nT.I. vs. Lil' Flip\n\nIn the early-2000s, Atlanta rapper T.I. audaciously proclaimed himself the King of the South. Other southern rappers disagreed, most notably Houston’s Lil’ Flip, who said as much in 2004 while T.I. was incarcerated.\n\nT.I. didn’t like that Flip badmouthed him while he was behind bars, so he and his entourage marched into Flip’s Cloverland neighborhood in 2005. A brawl ensued, shots were fired, and T.I. announced on Houston radio that he had filmed the whole melee. The video was set to be released with his next mixtape.\n\nThat release never arrived. Houston artist James Prince brought Flip and T.I. together, and the beef was squashed not long after the brawl.\n\nBeastie Boys vs. Russell Simmons\n\nOne of the most eye-opening revelations from The Beastie Boys' recent Apple TV+ documentary was that that their relationship with Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons was surprisingly acrimonious. In the late 80s, following the wild success of the band's first rap album, Licensed To Ill, Def Jam withheld royalty payments to get the group back in the studio. The result was a disaster for the label: the Boys left for Capital Records and spent almost three decades churning out hits.\n\nSimmons has opened up about his relationship with the group since the documentary's release. \"For years i wish i had been more sensitive smarter and compassionate in my dealings with them and SONY,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"... i just wasn't mature, sensitive or human enough to do better.\"\n\nThe two remaining Beastie Boys have said they harbor no ill-will toward their former label boss."
