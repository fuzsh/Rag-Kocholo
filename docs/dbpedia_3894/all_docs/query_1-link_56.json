        "text": "The Borromeo String Quartet visited the Cape Cod Chamber Music Festival once again last Friday, playing in the First Congregational Church, Wellfleet to a large and appreciative audience. Two of the Borromeo founders, first violin Nicholas Kitchen (himself a former artistic director of the festival), and cellist Yeesun Kim, can soon celebrate 35 years in the ensemble. They were joined by Kristopher Tong, the second violinist since 2006, and violist Melissa Reardon, who started two years ago.\n\nWithout taking an intermission, they played two major works. First came Beethoven’s 16th and last string quartet, the Op 135 in F Major from 1826. The Schuppanzigh Quartet debuted it in 1828, a year after Beethoven’s death. Schubert’s glorious Quartet No. 14 in D Minor, ‘Death and the Maiden” followed. An amateur ensemble essayed it in 1826, just two years before Schubert died.\n\nIn circumstances therefore replete with overlapping events and impending mortality, alternate interpretations of musical, material and cosmic significance abound for both works. For starters, Beethoven both annotated and scored his swan song quartet with the enigmatic motif: “Muss es sein? Es muss sein! (Must it be? It must be!).” Written by an inveterate punster, did these words refer to hefty bills and unpaid fees for work delivered, or were they the metaphorical, otherworldly musings of a man close to death? Similarly, do the intervals in the repeated phrases in the first movement of Op 135 purposely echo those in the first movement of his Op 131? These, and other subtle features, prompted Lewis Lockwood to wonder whether these two quartets, composed by Beethoven in the same year, “…embody the highest tragedy and subtlest comedy he (Beethoven) ever achieved.”\n\nAs for Schubert, what was his state of mind when, severely and chronically ill, he drew on an enigmatic song he composed seven years earlier? We will likely never know, but whatever the truth may be, before each work the audience was enlightened by Kitchen’s both learned and humorous conjecture, as he demonstrated once again his multifold talents as a pedagogue at the NEC.\n\nThe Borromeo interpreted both works with exceeding grace, while exhibiting characteristics that did not fit precisely into either of the two buckets in which I’ve tended to place foursomes over the years. Perhaps the majority have fallen into a) “First violin is boss, supported rhythmically and aggressively by the cello…” I’d characterize the Amadeus, Chilingirian, Kroll, Aeolian and Paganini Quartets as good examples of this genre. Contrast this with b) “The inner voices shape the proceedings, with the first fiddle floating above, and the cello providing timely support.” To my ears, the Budapest Quartet stood as the paradigmatic example of that genre, at least when Alexander Schneider served as second violinist.\n\nGiven this admittedly simple-minded distinction, designed in part to breed controversy, the Borromeo is a hybrid: The first violin dominates, while the remaining trio are generally subservient…but very much of a piece with one another. I mean this not as a criticism, but rather as an observation. Music of such supreme stature thrives under a broad variety of approaches.\n\nSome moments stood out. In both the Beethoven and Schubert, there are short cadenza-like moments for the first violin. Each time they occurred, I was delighted by the charm and elegance Kitchen demonstrated. Another example: the second variation of the andante movement of the Schubert highlights the cello, and often cellists take it as an opportunity to declaim boldly. In contrast, Kim intoned with quiet, warmth and elegance, drawing the listener in. For me, it may have been the high point of the evening. But let me not leave out the other two: Reardon has a lyrical bent that captured my ear, and Tong is always razor-sharp rhythmically, although at potentially prominent moments his violin may be holding him back. It’s not in the same class as Kitchen’s.\n\nOver the course of the concert, I missed some of Beethoven’s dynamic contrasts and Schubert’s ongoing lyrical flow. I sat in the back of the auditorium, thereby likely enhancing a sense of sonic adhesion of the individuals, but the pianissimo moments could have been quieter, and those fortissimo even bolder. Bernard Greenhouse, the late great cellist who so often charmed the Wellfleet church, used to urge musicians to create such ravishing pianissimos that the audience had to strain to hear. He also stressed giving those listening a chance to take a breath between phrases or when the character changed within a movement. For me, that was missing. And the last movement of the Schubert was fast and felt like a bit of a scramble. Does everyone really have to play as fast as possible? That seems to be the pattern these days. But these are niggly points from a splendid early evening on a beautiful summer day on the Cape.\n\nFinally, one aspect of the Borromeo foursome that may be unique among leading quartets: Their four instruments were created over a period nearing 500 years! A) Kim uses a cello crafted in Brescia, Italy, most likely toward the middle of the 16th century. At that time, Brescia and Cremona were setting up rivalry as the towns in which the most talented luthiers settled, and while Cremona, fueled by the Amati, Stradivari and Guarneri families went on to ascendancy, to this day the dark, chocolatey sounds of outstanding Brescian violas and cellos are hard to beat. B) Kitchen is privileged to have use of a remarkable violin crafted by Guarneri del Gesu, the most prominent of the five great Guarneri makers. “Del Gesu” strikes me as the Van Gogh of violin makers. Both began as studious, highly talented students without particularly idiosyncratic attributes….and ended up as madmen rapidly creating unique, stand-alone masterpieces, one after another. In 1744, Guarneri died in his 40s (Stradivari lived for 93 years; Nicolo Amati lived into his late 80s). In his last decade, his violins took on a wild, expressionistic beauty…coupled to a sound with extraordinary sonority and color. Kitchen’s tones on his ex-Szymon Goldberg instrument recalls that master’s unsurpassed grace and elegance. Dating from 1730, it’s earlier than the most famed examples that came later. There’s nothing wild about it. It’s just plain beautiful and is headed eventually for the Library of Congress where it will rest next to Fritz Kreisler’s del Gesu, fashioned the same year out of perhaps the same pieces of wood. C) Tong plays a rare Italian instrument created some decades after the del Gesu, and D) We heard Reardon on a modern viola, built by Joseph Curtin, both a highly talented maker and a true scholar of the acoustics of the violin. He was a co-conspirator in the double-blind trial of old violins versus new that demonstrated that both expert players and sophisticated audiences couldn’t tell them apart. Reviled by violin dealers and applauded by young players who have no chance of paying prices rare violins fetch, the study is fun to read, and it’s followed invariably by rancorous debate. As for last Friday night: Each of the instruments sounded great and, Vive la difference!\n\nTom Delbanco is the John F. Keane & Family Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital. An avid violinist since age nine, he has particular interest in the evolution of stringed instruments from the 16th century on.\n\nSuggested links:\n\n“Player Preferences Among New and Old Violins” by Claudia Fritz and Joseph Curtin\n\n“Beethoven: The Music and the Life” by Lewis Lockwood.
