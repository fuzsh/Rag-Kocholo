        "text": "Explore\n\nClick on the region of the brain to the right to learn more about how it effects your perception of music.\n\nFrontal Lobe\n\nWhat\n\nUsed in thinking, decision-making and planning\n\nHow\n\n“The frontal lobe is the most important to being a human. We have a big frontal lobe compared to other animals. By listening to music, we can enhance its functions,” Sugaya says.\n\nTemporal Lobe\n\nWhat\n\nProcesses what we hear\n\nHow\n\n“We use the language center to appreciate music, which spans both sides of the brain, though language and words are interpreted in the left hemisphere while music and sounds are inerpreted in the right hemisphere,” Yonetani says.\n\nBroca’s Area\n\nWhat\n\nEnables us to produce speech\n\nHow\n\n“We use this part of the brain to express music,” Yonetani says. “Playing an instrument may improve your ability to communicate better.”\n\nWernicke’s Area\n\nWhat\n\nComprehends written and spoken language\n\nHow\n\n“We use this part of the brain to analyze and enjoy music,” Yonetani says.\n\nOccipital Lobe\n\nWhat\n\nProcesses what we see\n\nHow\n\n“Professional musicians use the occipital cortex, which is the visual cortex, when they listen to music, while laypersons, like me, use the temporal lobe — the auditory and language center. This suggests that [musicians] might visualize a music score when they are listening to music,” Sugaya says.\n\nCerebellum\n\nWhat\n\nCoordinates movement and stores physical memory\n\nHow\n\n“An Alzheimer’s patient, even if he doesn’t recognize his wife, could still play the piano if he learned it when he was young because playing has become a muscle memory. Those memories in the cerebellum never fade out,” Sugaya says.\n\nNucleus Accumbens\n\nWhat\n\nSeeks pleasure and reward and plays a big role in addiction, as it releases the neurotransmitter dopamine\n\nHow\n\n“Music can be a drug — a very addictive drug because it’s also acting on the same part of the brain as illegal drugs,” Sugaya says. “Music increases dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, similar to cocaine.”\n\nAmygdala\n\nWhat\n\nProcesses and triggers emotions\n\nHow\n\n“Music can control your fear, make you ready to fight and increase pleasure,” Yonetani says. “When you feel shivers go down your spine, the amygdala is activated.”\n\nHippocampus\n\nWhat\n\nProduces and retrieves memories, regulates emotional responses and helps us navigate. Considered the central processing unit of the brain, it’s one of the first regions of the brain to be affected by Alzheimer’s disease, leading to confusion and memory loss.\n\nHow\n\n“Music may increase neurogenesis in the hippocampus, allowing production of new neurons and improving memory,” Yonetani says.\n\nHypothalamus\n\nWhat\n\nMaintains the body’s status quo, links the endocrine and nervous systems, and produces and releases essential hormones and chemicals that regulate thirst, appetite, sleep, mood, heart rate, body temperature, metabolism, growth and sex drive — to name just a few\n\nHow\n\nIf you play Mozart, for example, “heart rate and blood pressure reduce,” Sugaya says.\n\nCorpus Callosum\n\nWhat\n\nEnables the left and right hemispheres to communicate, allowing for coordinated body movement as well as complex thoughts that require logic (left side) and intuition (right side)\n\nHow\n\n“As a musician, you want to have the right-hand side and the left-hand side of the brain in coordination, so they talk to each other,” Sugaya says. This allows pianists, for example, to translate notes on a sheet to the keys their fingers hit to produce music.\n\nPutamen\n\nWhat\n\nProcesses rhythm and regulates body movement and coordination\n\nHow\n\n“Music can increase dopamine in this area, and music increases our response to rhythm,” Yonetani says. “By doing this, music temporarily stops the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Rhythmic music, for example, has been used to help Parkinson’s patients function, such as getting up and down and even walking because Parkinson’s patients need assistance in moving, and music can help them kind of like a cane. Unfortunately, after the music stops, the pathology comes back.”"
