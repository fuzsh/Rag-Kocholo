        "text": "In the 2010s, technology made creating, distributing, and listening to music easier than at any previous point in history. Producers and artists collaborated through the cloud, mixing styles like potions, from emo trap to EDM ballads to indie R&B to bedroom pop. A million modes of distribution meant you could hear those songs milliseconds after they were born. Artists started releasing music at an unprecedentedly rapid pace. The infinite scroll of social media made listeners insatiable. The result of all this was both a blessing and a curse: There was more great music out there than ever before, but it was nearly impossible to keep up. Here at Pitchfork, we sure tried. Here are our top 200 songs of the decade.\n\nFor more about how we put together this list, read this letter from our editor-in-chief Puja Patel. And check out all of Pitchfork’s 2010s wrap-up coverage here.\n\nListen to selections from this list on our Spotify playlist and Apple Music playlist.\n\n200.\n\nAvicii: “Levels” (2011)\n\nAs sampled in Avicii’s “Levels,” Etta James’ relatively modest claim that “Oh, sometimes I get a good feeling” felt impossibly aspirational for a generation of entry-level millennials dumped into an indifferent economy. In 2011, good feelings were rare and expensive, but it was possible to get one for free via a sparkling EDM hook. “Levels,” with its monumental synths and jetstream whooshes, took that potential and conquered the world with it.\n\nIn hindsight, its sheer scale still feels staggering, but there’s a sinister undertone to it. Tim Bergling, who took his own life in 2018, at age 28, got his stage name from Avici, the hell-like realm in Buddhism where dead sinners are reborn. There is something punishing about “Levels,” which, like the office drone pushing a boulder up a mountain in its music video, seems to climb and climb without actually going anywhere, an illusion of transcendence that’s actually just plain old limbo. Electronic pop music of the early 2010s, from “Harlem Shake” to “Turn Down for What,” was punctuated by images of people in their boring jobs and dumpy apartments exploding into uncontrollable, spasmodic dancing—half joyful release, half exorcism. “Levels” is the sound of a generation hell-bent on having a good feeling, reality be damned. –Emily Yoshida\n\nListen: Avicii, “Levels”\n\n199.\n\nStormzy: “Big for Your Boots” (2017)\n\nBefore he was a world-famous MC, Stormzy got his start uploading DIY freestyle videos in which he spit nonstop bars over hard-edged grime beats in streets and parks near his South London home. So it makes sense that the knockout track from his eclectic debut album, Gang Signs & Prayer, simply showcases his high-octane rapping and palpable charisma over a jagged instrumental, proving that he deserves to take a seat next to grime greats like Dizzee Rascal and Wiley. On “Big for Your Boots,” Stormzy fires off a barrage of disses directed at his enemies and rap rivals. “You’re getting way too big for your boots/You’re never too big for my boot,” he raps in the chorus, emphasizing the last syllable with maniacal glee. Considering the fact that he’s 6-foot-5 and wears a size 12 shoe, any detractors would be wise to heed his warning. –Michelle Kim\n\nListen: Stormzy, “Big for Your Boots”\n\n198.\n\ndvsn: “The Line” (2016)\n\nIt's not explicitly about God, but the debut single from singer Daniel Daley and producer Nineteen85—better known as dvsn—is some kind of gospel, particularly if you consider falling in love to be a religious experience. Arriving the year before mainstream hip-hop reclaimed gospel via Chance the Rapper's Coloring Book and Kanye West’s “Ultralight Beam,” “The Line” has Daley showing off a preacher’s sense of mesmerizing repetition as he fills the song’s skeletal framework with melisma capable of stretching moments into eternities. By the time the choir hits about halfway into this epic slow jam, dvsn’s romantic redemption is secured. –Rich Juzwiak\n\nListen: dsvn, “The Line”\n\n197.\n\nIcona Pop: “I Love It” [ft. Charli XCX] (2012)\n\nManic and apathetic at once, “I Love It” is a perfect display of post-breakup hedonism, written over a drop that keeps on dropping. Penned by then-upstart Charli XCX, it was delivered to Swedish twosome Icona Pop by the producer Patrik Berger, whose credits include Robyn’s similarly anthemic “Dancing on My Own”—though the duo differentiate their electropop catharsis by adding an edge of vengeance. Turn the bass up enough, Icona Pop suggest, and it can drown out the throbbing of your broken heart. –Olivia Horn\n\nListen: Icona Pop, “I Love It” [ft. Charli XCX]\n\n196.\n\nJohn Maus: “Believer” (2011)\n\nLike many of his lo-fi pop contemporaries in the early ’10s, reclusive Midwesterner John Maus pushed underground music forward by looking backward—rejecting digital studio techniques in favor of old drum machines and wonky synths, excavating the dramatic excesses of ’80s stadium pop and sentimental radio jingles as though they held clues to some hard-to-pinpoint generational subconscious. But his actual relationship to such sources could be hard to read: Was Maus poking fun at music’s power to manufacture an emotional response, like when we find ourselves crying in the middle of a commercial, or celebrating its potential to offer us a fleeting moment of ecstasy, a glimpse of a world that is better than our own? Arriving at the end of 2011’s We Must Be the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves with the cathartic finality of perfectly curated exit music, this song—with its glittering harpsichord arpeggios, briskly pulsing bass, and grandiose allusions to borderless love—is the closest Maus has ever come to being a true believer. –Emilie Friedlander\n\nListen: John Maus, “Believer”\n\n195.\n\nCloud Nothings: “I’m Not Part of Me” (2014)\n\nOut of the glut of lo-fi pop-punkers who emerged at the turn of the decade, Cloud Nothings frontman Dylan Baldi was the only one who got nastier with age. At the dead center of the band’s catalog lies “I’m Not Part of Me,” a song where Baldi lets all of his seemingly unworkable contradictions fight themselves into an exhausted standstill while tossing out an album’s worth of hooks in less than five minutes. It’s an insular type of empowering breakup song: “I’m not, I’m not you/You’re a part of me,” Baldi howls, a compact mantra for giving up the character defects and trauma that people hold onto because they confuse it with their identity. Don’t look back in anger, says “I’m Not Part of Me”—let it guide you forward. –Ian Cohen\n\nListen: Cloud Nothings, “I’m Not Part of Me”\n\n194.\n\nLil B: “Wonton Soup” (2010)\n\nTwo true things: Lil B is a beatific vessel for galaxy-brain-level peace, love, and understanding. He also once tweeted “buttcheeks party grandma.” But spirituality need not bend to reason, and over this decade the Based God remained committed to his vision of untrammeled optimism and unbridled creative confidence, evolving from Bay Area blog savant into legitimate folk hero for the new school. “Wonton Soup” is the peak from this early period, when he first exploded into semi-mainstream consciousness. All his stylistic trademarks are on display: endless “woop” ad libs, hazy production, a monotone delivery that makes his absurd lyrics—he brags about being able to achieve orgasm “like 36 ways,” then compares himself to J.K. Rowling—sound like blissed-out Zen koans. It’s the best possible argument for BasedGodism, even better than a sermon. –Jeremy Gordon\n\nListen: Lil B, “Wonton Soup”\n\n193.\n\nNilüfer Yanya: “Baby Luv” (2017)\n\nLondon upstart Nilüfer Yanya does a lot with a little on “Baby Luv.” The song spotlights her insistent guitar strums, her urgent vocals, and little else. Yanya makes the best of repetition, wielding certain words and phrases like blunt instruments. When she asks, “Do you like pain?” she follows the question with a single word—“again”—saying it over and over again until the word turns numb. It’s a great example of her restraint as a songwriter: Instead of spelling things out in bright red block letters, she selects a couple of choice words and blows them up for maximum impact. When she sings “call me sometime” in the song’s bridge, the familiar phrase assumes a new and menacing shape. –Madison Bloom\n\nListen: Nilüfer Yanya, “Baby Luv”\n\n192.\n\nTame Impala: “Feels Like We Only Go Backwards” (2012)\n\nTame Impala’s music is often pegged as brain-melting sonic exploration, but mastermind Kevin Parker also has a pop star’s understanding of emotion. Stripped down to melody and lyrics, “Feels Like We Only Go Backwards,” from 2012’s Lonerism, is a crushing meditation on dashed hopes and rejection. But with its galloping bass and kaleidoscopic, ever-shifting textures, it seems wistfully nostalgic, if not downright celebratory. You can hear why Kendrick Lamar, fresh off the contradictory impulses of his hit “Swimming Pools (Drank),” was drawn to rap over the song. And you can hear how Parker, in the span of a decade, went from headphones auteur to Coachella headliner. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen: Tame Impala, “Feels Like We Only Go Backwards”\n\n191.\n\nRico Nasty: “Smack a Bitch” (2018)\n\nGo to a Rico Nasty show and you’ll see a swirling mob of teenage girls thrashing and jumping along to her every word. In the spirit of Bikini Kill’s “girls to the front” rallying cry, the rapper always calls for a female-only mosh pit when she’s about to play her most unruly material, purposefully making space for other young women to share their rage, too.\n\nThis sense of uncontainable fury is what makes her breakout single, “Smack a Bitch,” so transfixing. Over a lurching, guitar-fueled instrumental produced by Kenny Beats, Rico yells, “Thank God, I ain’t have to smack a bitch today,” as if delivering blows is part of her normal routine. Pushing her delivery into near-psychotic territory, she declares, “Your ass is done,” before cackling maniacally. Rico takes absolutely no shit, and it’s refreshing to see. –Michelle Kim\n\nListen: Rico Nasty, “Smack a Bitch”\n\n190.\n\nTy Dolla $ign: “Paranoid” [ft. B.o.B] (2013)\n\nTy Dolla $ign’s biggest, best single was one of many hits in the early half of the decade to flaunt producer DJ Mustard’s minimalist touch, realigning R&B with house music. Still, “Paranoid” stands out, its spacious snap-and-pop production setting the stage for our narrator to hit the club only to encounter two girls he’s seeing, both of whom are wearing matching heels and “the same damn fragrance.” Ty wonders if it’s some sort of set-up or if it’s all just in his head. This internal debate is punctuated by his own quivering backing vocals, a Greek chorus commenting on a twisted spin through modern romance. –Jordan Sargent\n\nListen: Ty Dolla $ign, “Paranoid” [ft. B.o.B]\n\n189.\n\nJ Balvin / Willy William: “Mi Gente (Remix)” [ft. Beyoncé] (2017)\n\nMuch of what makes Colombian singer J Balvin’s “Mi Gente” sizzle—that audacious drumbeat, that insistent five-note vocal melody—is lifted from Mauritian-French singer Willy William’s 2017 track “Voodoo Song,” which itself reinterprets a sample from the Indian composer Akassh. No wonder “Mi Gente” was such a global, cross-culture sensation.\n\nBalvin worked with William to reinvent the source material, adding Spanish lyrics, chants, and ferocious Latin percussion. His lines like “el mundo nos quiere” (“the world wants us”) transform the song into a universal call to the dancefloor, an embrace of solidarity and unification at a time of enormous worldwide polarization. Aided on the remix by Beyoncé, who audaciously tackles Spanish and ups the diva ante, “Mi Gente” became the first all-Spanish song to reach the top of Spotify’s Global Top 50 chart. It remains a testament to pop music’s ability to push back against growing neo-nationalist fervor—there was no border, no wall, that could keep people from coming together and loving this song. –Jason King\n\nListen: J Balvin / Willy William, “Mi Gente (Remix)” [ft. Beyoncé]\n\n188.\n\nFuture: “Incredible” (2017)\n\nOn “Incredible,” Future’s giddy ode to rebound romance, he and his new woman do hot yoga together and send each other “XO” texts. But he isn’t just intoxicated with this fresh love—his zeal for money and jewelry (and Vicodin) loom just as large in his lyrics. Meanwhile, the song’s hook is so simple and so instant—basically, an Auto-Tune hiccup of the title phrase—that it’s a wonder it hadn’t been done before. Producer Dre Moon frames the rapper’s warble in moonlit synths and limber bass for an effect as frothy as an island cocktail. There’s an extra glimmer of hope in hearing such unabashed exuberance from Future in light of his long history of zonked-out moroseness. “I’ma do whatever it’s gon’ take to keep my baby spoiled,” he vows happily, sounding like he truly means it. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen: Future, “Incredible”\n\n187.\n\nThom Yorke: “Dawn Chorus” (2019)\n\nThe death of Thom Yorke’s longtime partner, Rachel Owen, in late 2016 casts a shadow over “Dawn Chorus,” the emotional center of his solo album Anima. Though the pair had split about 18 months before her passing, it’s impossible to not feel like he’s reflecting, however obliquely, on his own loss. “I think I missed something, but I’m not sure what,” he says in a murmur that makes it seem like he’s dragging his voice across the floor reluctantly. “In the middle of the vortex the wind picked up/Shook up the soot from the chimney pot into spiral patterns of you my love.”\n\nThe term “dawn chorus” describes the sound birds make at sunrise during mating season. Nature lovers can’t get enough of it, but here, Yorke calls it a “bloody racket.” That seems off for him, to criticize the organic world. In a state of mourning, though, something that should be sweet can often turn sour. With this song, at least, Yorke makes it sound beautiful. –Matthew Schnipper\n\nListen: Thom Yorke, “Dawn Chorus”\n\n186.\n\nSkepta: “Shutdown” (2015)\n\nSkepta’s 2015 hit “Shutdown” serves as the decade’s ultimate London anthem: catchy enough to elevate slang to lexicon, hard enough to burst from the world’s weediest soundsystem, and worldly enough to shut down both the Arc de Triomphe and Central Park, as the rapper teases in the song. In a satirical mid-song skit, an unfeasibly posh woman laments the “intimidating” presence of men in hoodies on her TV, alluding to Kanye West’s grime takeover of the 2015 BRIT Awards, which featured Skepta alongside many of the genre’s stars. With this flourish, Skepta’s single rejects battle-rap showboating and zeroes in on the real bête-noire: the snoots who clutch pearls when black MCs breach the nation’s living rooms. The promise of a new, emancipatory grime wave has since resonated loud and clear, on the UK’s biggest stages and beyond. –Jazz Monroe\n\nListen: Skepta, “Shutdown”\n\n185.\n\nSharon Van Etten: “Seventeen” (2019)\n\nSharon Van Etten’s best songs are often marked by their restraint: There’s a feeling that her husky and wide-ranging voice, along with her roiling guitars, could run off the rails, but they’re held in place by her steadfast sense of control. “Seventeen,” from this year’s Remind Me Tomorrow, stretches this idea to the limit—and then careens right past it. The song is immaculately arranged, a lockstep keyboard-rock anthem that’s artfully mussed with synth wobbles and Van Etten’s quavering vocals. But then, as her ambivalent reflections on a youthful doppelgänger wind down, she unleashes a full-throated scream: “Afraid that you’ll be just like me,” she bellows, losing her cool but gaining something even fiercer. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen: Sharon Van Etten, “Seventeen”\n\n184.\n\nFrank Ocean: “Chanel” (2017)\n\nAfter releasing Blonde in 2016, Frank Ocean spent the next year trickling out a series of singles that built upon that album’s fluid confidence. “Chanel” is the first and best of them, capturing an artist in total command of his faculties as a singer, writer, and rapper. There isn’t much to it in terms of melody or structure. The piano chords are simple and translucent; the beat ambles casually. It’s all about Frank and the places his words can take you: a heated swimming pool in the hills, a Tokyo back alley, the first-class lounge at the Delta terminal. Listen closely, and “Chanel” also reveals itself to be a meditation on masculinity, one that alternately embraces it, subverts it, and points out its absurdity. Beneath it all, there’s a romantic ripple, too, as a relationship that seemed casual and disposable is revealed, almost shyly, to mean something more. This is Frank’s gift, the ability to build worlds of meaning and emotion into a song that has the casual grace of a freestyle. –Jamieson Cox\n\nListen: Frank Ocean, “Chanel”\n\n183.\n\nYoung M.A: “OOOUUU” (2016)\n\nYoung M.A’s breakthrough single oozes the kind of confidence you can’t fake. Against a loose, snare-heavy beat, she raps breezily about sex with other women—a rarity in hip-hop that she plays off nonchalantly amid lines about getting drunk and cracking jokes with friends. An out stud in an industry that’s still deciding how to digest queer musicians, M.A used “OOOUUU” to carve out a judgment-free zone where she can be herself and feel herself, where she isn’t an outsider but the queen of her own domain. The coyote howl of the title is both a tease and a triumph, the sound of finally feeling at home in your own skin and inviting others to play along with you. –Sasha Geffen\n\nListen: Young M.A, “OOOUUU”\n\n182.\n\nBeyoncé: “XO” (2013)\n\n“XO” is about more than the saccharine simplicity of dreamy hugs and kisses. It begins with a clip of the crew of the Challenger realizing the malfunction on their spaceship, giving the love story that follows an undercurrent of mortality. On the surface, the slow-building track is an airy breather after the erotic, liberatory journey of the rest of Beyoncé’s self-titled 2013 album; the synth drops, and so does the snare drum, creating a soundscape that draws from rock, reggae, and EDM. Meanwhile, Beyoncé’s voice is raw, almost growling, a sound we have never heard from her before. (Turns out she had a sinus infection during the recording.)\n\nIn the video, Beyoncé is at a carnival, flashing us one gorgeous smile after another. But carnivals themselves are a form of trickery: youthful joy on the surface, covering a shadowy underbelly. Like the spell of love and the threat it could end, “XO” deftly balances joy and sorrow; it’s a cautionary tale of beautiful things that sometimes head to untimely endings. –Samhita Mukhopadhyay\n\nListen: Beyoncé, “XO”\n\n181.\n\nMigos: “Bad and Boujee” [ft. Lil Uzi Vert] (2016)\n\nThe runaway success of “Bad and Boujee” created its own pop culture ecosystem. The Migos became mainstream stars. “Rain drops, drop tops” became a catchphrase. Takeoff’s absence from the track became a memeable conspiracy theory. The song itself is a perfect distillation of everything that makes the Migos irresistible: a Gucci Mane-derived gift for quotables, a sizzling Metro Boomin beat, ad-libs for days, and an ear for perfectly placed guest stars—in this case, a before-he-was-huge Lil Uzi Vert, rapping about falling asleep in a jacuzzi. Soon enough, the Migos were matching chart feats once set by the Beatles, cementing their status as generational titans. –Jonah Bromwich\n\nListen: Migos, “Bad and Boujee” [ft. Lil Uzi Vert]\n\n180.\n\nSons of Kemet: “My Queen Is Harriet Tubman” (2018)\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Secretary continues to balk at the rollout of a new $20 bill featuring abolitionist Harriet Tubman. Meanwhile, do-it-yourself Tubman rubber stamps are perpetually out of stock, suggesting that many Americans might concur with Sons of Kemet and the British-born, Barbados-raised saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings’ bold declaration that “My Queen Is Harriet Tubman.” The unrelenting highlight of the band’s Impulse! debut, Your Queen Is a Reptile, “Harriet Tubman” unites African-American jazz and Afro-Caribbean soca. But UK sounds also bubble up on the track, from the punk sneer inherent in that title to the dubstep wobble in tuba player Theon Cross’ huffed frequencies. And then there’s Hutchings’ own breathless solo, his staccato shrieks matching the rapidfire flow of grime. Drawing on many musical heritages, “Harriet Tubman” also moves forward, its sound igniting the spirit of all future freedom fighters. –Andy Beta\n\nListen: Sons of Kemet, “My Queen Is Harriet Tubman”\n\n179.\n\nRich Kidz: “My Life” [ft. Waka Flocka Flame] (2012)\n\n“My Life” feels like it came from a different century. The uncut bombast of Atlanta rap group Rich Kidz’ towering tune was laced by producer London on da Track, but its pure sonic overload was lovingly ripped from the gigantic sound popularized by Lex Luger, before a variety of issues drove him off the map for the rest of the decade. Waka Flocka Flame’s contributions to the song resemble a pack of sound effects played all at once, evoking the smoking-barrel chaos of his own 2010 masterpiece, Flockaveli, though the rapper’s career is currently mired in reality-TV purgatory. Even Rich Kidz’ Skooly and RK Kaelub are no longer making music together anymore. But no matter what’s happened since, “My Life” is still a Kool-Aid-colored diamond that hasn’t lost any of its blinding sparkle. –Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nListen: Rich Kidz, “My Life” [ft. Waka Flocka Flame]\n\n178.\n\nThe 1975: “The Sound” (2016)\n\n“The Sound” has all the hallmarks of a great 1975 song: a sticky chorus, bouncing neon synths, Matty Healy name-dropping Greek philosophers and promptly calling himself a cliché. It’s fun and clever and anthemic while taking the piss out of big anthems at the same time. Above all the roaring maximalism, Healy is tuned to the sound of his many, many desires: for attention, sex, intellectual validation, intimacy, and, quite possibly, immortality. With this, he embodies a very millennial mindset: as eager to promote himself as he is to air all of his insecurities. –Matthew Strauss\n\nListen: The 1975, “The Sound”\n\n177.\n\nA Tribe Called Quest: “The Space Program” (2016)\n\nA Tribe Called Quest have never been conscious or woke in the way that so many of the best-intentioned rappers are. Instead, they adopt the playful, nihilistic tone of high cultural gatekeepers, turning it back onto those same gatekeepers over kick snare and hi-hat. So it was deeply satisfying to hear the group strike as strongly as ever after 18 years of downtime on “The Space Program,” where they chuckle at the idea that NASA is anything more than a segregated train car, meant to take the rich to space and leave everyone else right where we’re at. Over soft-touch keyboards and guitars that pick up where 1996’s Beats Rhymes and Life left off, the song opens up We got it from Here... Thank You 4 Your service, Tribe’s final album of tongue-in-cheek musings on the current state of the world and the weekend. “Let's make something happen,” is the mantra, one anybody with a pulse can feel. We got it from Here... is fossilized by the passing of Phife Dawg shortly after its release, and this track captures a group, a sound, and a spirit that fought to the last second to exist in a world that remained alien to it. –Matthew Trammell\n\nListen: A Tribe Called Quest, “The Space Program”\n\n176.\n\nSampha: “(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano” (2017)\n\nWhen it came time for Sampha to write and record his debut album, the UK singer was in mourning. His mother, whom he’d lived with and cared for in London, had died of cancer. The resulting LP, Process, is a deeply personal look at the painful and, at times, transformative power of grief, and nowhere is that more apparent than on “(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano.” The ballad finds Sampha anthropomorphizing the piano in his mother’s home, which was purchased by his father, who passed away when Sampha was young. The instrument is likened to a childhood friend who helped him channel his despair into song. As Sampha narrates his coming of age, the hiss of room tone and the cooing of birds can be heard deep in the mix. The effect is one of intimacy, of being welcomed into a private moment of respite. –Gabriela Tully Claymore\n\nListen: Sampha, “(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano”\n\n175.\n\nNicki Minaj: “Come on a Cone” (2012)\n\nNicki Minaj may have become a star off of sugar-rush pop-rap anthems, but her status as one of the fiercest MCs of the decade was established by tracks like “Come on a Cone”: punchy, barb-laced polemics displaying crushing levels of pettiness and animus. Easily one of the most dynamic rap performances of the past 10 years, “Come on a Cone” is unswerving, deservedly smug, and incredibly funny. Nicki wields her flashy fashion show front-row status as a weapon that reinforces her power: “When I’m sittin’ with Anna/I’m really sittin’ with Anna/Ain’t a metaphor, punchline—I’m really sittin’ with Anna,” she barks. “Just admit that I’m winnin’,” she declares, and if you don’t, well... there’s a certain appendage Nicki would like to stick in your face. –Sheldon Pearce\n\nListen: Nicki Minaj, “Come on a Cone”\n\n174.\n\nFlorence and the Machine: “Shake It Out” (2011)\n\nTake a look at the YouTube comments for Florence and the Machine’s “Shake It Out”: Eight years after its release, the song is still helping people get through breakups, depression, illness, and even a prison sentence. Such are the healing powers of Florence Welch’s gale-force vocals delivering a message of hope and perseverance over florid gospel-pop that sounds like the sun breaking through after a storm. Florence’s multi-platinum 2009 debut album Lungs introduced the London singer to the world stage, but it was “Shake It Out” and its accompanying album, 2011’s Ceremonials, that cemented her place as an arena and festival headliner—a position she maintains to this day. Few moments in pop this decade have delivered this level of ecstatic catharsis; only big rooms and big crowds can do it justice. –Amy Phillips\n\nListen: Florence and the Machine, “Shake It Out”\n\n173.\n\nDJ Khaled: “I’m on One” [ft. Drake, Rick Ross, and Lil Wayne] (2011)\n\nYou’d be forgiven for wondering why the guy who does the ad-libs has top billing on this star-studded 2011 posse cut. But here, DJ Khaled shows his gift for executive production, assembling a showcase for three of hip-hop’s biggest artists. Everyone sounds laid-back and in their zone: Rick Ross leans into the fabulist drug kingpin fantasy he established on Teflon Don, and Lil Wayne is at his most casually confident (“You niggas on the bench like the bus coming”). But Drake steals the show, drowning in his double cup while taking shots at the throne, perfectly paired to a beat from fellow Canadians T-Minus, Nikhil S., and Noah “40” Shebib that’s laced with synthesizers that sing like sirens. Considering the hook is also lifted from Drake’s “Trust Issues,” this song is as much his as Khaled’s, a summer anthem that helped reinforce the hit-making status of all involved. –Matthew Ismael Ruiz\n\nListen: DJ Khaled, “I’m on One” [ft. Drake, Rick Ross, and Lil Wayne]\n\n172.\n\nSleep: “Marijuanaut’s Theme” (2018)\n\nDoom metal trio Sleep became legends by doing a few simple things very well. They played slow. They played loud. They made smoking pot sound like an epic journey on par with Lord of the Rings. So when the band returned with their first new album in 15 years in 2018, the fact that their gnarly riffs sounded just as inspired as they did in the ’90s was worth celebrating.\n\nMetal played at torpid speed often seems to invoke the apocalypse, and a colossal solo from guitarist Matt Pike in “Marijuanaut’s Theme” certainly suggests some kind of destruction. But Sleep’s new music was remarkable for sounding equally combustive and comfortable in its freefall through space. Close your eyes, they seem to say, There is a band playing in your head, and they are getting high. –Sam Sodomsky\n\nListen: Sleep, “Marijuanaut’s Theme”\n\n171.\n\nAdele: “Rolling in the Deep” (2011)\n\nIn the first line of “Rolling in the Deep,” Adele warns us of a coming fire, then she burns everything to the ground. The lead single from the mega-selling breakup album 21 transformed her into a global star, and she has hardly made anything like it since. The lyrics quickly abandon hell-hath-no-fury cliché: By the pre-chorus, the boiling anger has cooled into sadness, revealing protruding scars. The music follows suit—Adele once described the song as “dark bluesy gospel disco,” which feels like the made-up sub-genre she was born to sing. Her vocal control, the way she allows melisma to curl around the edges of her voice, is like a superpower that needed this song to reveal it. –Rich Juzwiak\n\nListen: Adele, “Rolling in the Deep”\n\n170.\n\nLil Peep: “Kiss” (2016)\n\nLil Peep’s “Kiss” sounds like two or three songs staggering home together. The sampled guitars might be from a Modern Baseball song, or maybe another Lil Peep song entirely, and the first voices on the track are a half-buried sample of the California pop-punk band Better Luck Next Time; the echoes run together the same way that incoming headlights smear into one beam when you squint. Produced by Smokeasac, Peep’s closest and most intimate creative partner, the song begins pickled in that signature Peep weariness, but then a second song seems to yawn and wake up inside the first one. This is a cautiously exultant one, a rare Peep anthem of bashful hope instead of despair: “One more chance, baby give me a kiss/Ya got one more chance for a night like this,” he sings. It has the lifespan of a soap bubble, this fleeting burst of euphoria. You feel the urge to protect it. –Jayson Greene\n\nListen: Lil Peep, “Kiss”\n\n169.\n\nSt. Vincent: “New York” (2017)\n\nSurrounded by hypersexual synth workouts and fuzzed-to-all-hell basslines, this bare piano ballad is the heartrending centerpiece of MASSEDUCTION, Annie Clark’s fifth album as St. Vincent. The song’s intimate verses, cribbed from Clark’s own text messages to old friends, honor people and places who may have drifted away but will never be completely out-of-mind. “You’re the only motherfucker in the city who can stand me,” she sings. The chorus, meanwhile, zooms out into the cosmos, as she pays homage to fallen musical heroes like David Bowie and Prince. It’s a song about living, loving, and losing in the big city—and not regretting any of it. –Noah Yoo\n\nListen: St. Vincent, “New York”\n\n168.\n\nKing Krule: “Dum Surfer” (2017)\n\nOn “Dum Surfer,” King Krule’s Archy Marshall showed that, aside from his beatmaking prowess and lounge-lizard loucheness, he could also pen a terse rocker. Singing with the affect of a boxer with a plugged nose, he veers between emotional extremes, calling out a band as “fucking trash” while sounding miserably convinced of his own fallibility. A snaking baritone sax and smoky dub effects blur the song’s edges until even the name-calling title subtly shifts to a gentle adage: “Don’t suffer.” Had it come a few generations before, it might have made Krule into alternative rock royalty alongside the Pixies or Sonic Youth. Instead, it made fans of everyone from weirdo-jazz ensemble Standing on the Corner to Beyoncé. –Andy Beta\n\nListen: King Krule, “Dum Surfer”\n\n167.\n\nTinashe: “2 On” [ft. Schoolboy Q] (2014)\n\nProduced by L.A. hitmaker DJ Mustard, “2 On” is widescreen and intricately sculpted: Its curling, high-toned bassline seems to whir and chime, and its descending roll of pizzicato synth-drums are so ear-catching that they compete with the gorgeous vocal melody. “2 On” is Tinashe’s term for being too high—intoxication chased to the edge of oblivion. Her lyrics ripple with references to liquor and smoke, and the song’s forthright celebration of “getting faded till we trip” may well have contributed to it only reaching No. 24 on the Hot 100. (“Live fast, die young, that’s my choice” does sound nihilistic, admittedly.) But Tinashe’s sensuous, slurred lingering over the chorus “I luuuuu to get 2 on” is joyous and life-affirming, a million miles from the deadened hedonism of so much trap. Dissolution has never sounded so delicious. –Simon Reynolds\n\nListen: Tinashe, “2 On” [ft. Schoolboy Q]\n\n166.\n\nBad Bunny: “Caro” (2018)\n\nBad Bunny was already one of the biggest acts in música urbana when his knockout debut LP X 100PRE dropped in 2018, and the album’s fourth single, “Caro,” offered the clearest picture of his brilliance. It’s the perfect vessel for his suave sadboi aesthetic: laid-back yet full of bounce, draped in woozy synths and atmospheric coos that ground his nimble flow. It’s romantic yet political in its expression of the universal human desire to live one’s truth freely: “¿En qué te hago daño a ti?/Y solamente soy feliz,” he croons (“How have I hurt you?/I’m just happy”).\n\n“Caro” became a defining moment for Bad Bunny: In the wake of a homophobic backlash to his whimsical sartorial choices and predilection for freshly manicured nails, its video doubled down with a rejection of traditional gender roles and toxic masculinity. The stunning clip includes a female Bad Bunny stand-in and a drag queen working the runway, and, during the song’s incandescent bridge featuring none other than Ricky Martin, Bad Bunny himself is seen receiving kisses from both a man and a woman. With “Caro,” the Puerto Rican star flipped a few scripts that badly needed it. –Matthew Ismael Ruiz\n\nListen: Bad Bunny, “Caro”\n\n165.\n\nJessica Pratt: “Back, Baby” (2014)\n\nLike waiting out a snowstorm indoors, Jessica Pratt’s sophomore album On Your Own Love Again has an isolating power. Amid its hazier material, “Back, Baby” is its clearest transmission, with a melody as familiar as an oldies radio standard. And yet Pratt’s delivery—strange, sad, slightly off-kilter—gives the sense of someone more interested in drowning out the world than inviting it in. Alongside strums of a nylon string guitar, she cycles through the song’s bobbing refrains and wordless choruses, her voice sewn through with an intensity that belies its understated presentation. “Sometimes I pray for the rain,” she sings as the sun peeks through the blinds. But even at her most upbeat, there’s a tinge of sadness, knowing all storms must pass. –Sam Sodomsky\n\nListen: Jessica Pratt, “Back, Baby”\n\n164.\n\nAndrés: “New for U” (2012)\n\nSaying there’s not much to Andrés’ “New for U” might not be wrong, but it misses the point. Simple tools are almost always the most effective, as the Detroit DJ proves here. Using a lovely little string melody as its main flourish, “New for U” straddles the line between symphonic disco and house music. With its occasionally washed out vibe, it has the feel of being prewritten to play the way a great DJ would deploy it, teasing out its peaks. Once the DJ for the Motor City rap group Slum Village, Andrés released a considerable amount of music this decade, but nothing competed with this track’s restrained power. –Matthew Schnipper\n\nListen: Andrés, “New for U”\n\n163.\n\nDavido: “Fall” (2017)\n\nPrior to 2017, Nigerian Afropop singer Davido had already established himself as one of Africa’s premier artists, but “Fall” turned him into a star the world over. Who can blame everyone for falling in love with the song’s soft melody and Davido’s tricky charisma? Every line is uttered with both mesmerizing cockiness and vulnerability. “I don’t wanna be a player no more,” he pleads, raising his pitch. In the back half of the 2010s, Afropop exploded in popularity, with countless artists attempting to hop on the trend. “Fall” was instrumental in continuing to widen the influence of Nigeria’s music on Western culture, becoming an international anthem along the way. –Alphonse Pierre\n\nListen: Davido, “Fall”\n\n162.\n\nChance the Rapper: “No Problem” [ft. 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne] (2016)\n\nThe most maximalist single from Chance the Rapper’s Coloring Book, “No Problem” drapes layered gospel samples from every corner, like streamers bedecking a birthday party. The song bursts with childlike joy, from Chance’s raspy laughs in the hook to the dizzying turns by its superstar guests. 2 Chainz comes in with swift, blunt punches, while Weezy takes his time, delivering the best flex of the entire track: “Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm.” But all those bells and whistles can’t conceal the sharp knives these MCs have tucked behind their backs. “If one more label try to stop me,” Chance barks, “It’s gon’ be some dread head niggas in ya lobby.” It’s a threat uttered through a smile, making this jubilant ode to independence sound that much more determined. –Madison Bloom\n\nListen: Chance the Rapper, “No Problem” [ft. 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne]\n\n161.\n\nVybz Kartel: “Clarks” [ft. Popcaan and Gaza Slim] (2010)\n\nMonths after squashing a bitter rivalry with fellow dancehall icon Mavado that involved a dizzying stretch of singles, a peace concert, and a summit shepherded by Jamaican Prime Minister Bruce Golding, Vybz Kartel dialed things back to deliver a fashion anthem that paid homage to that most classic of song topics: simply keeping the ’fit straight and the kicks clean. Kartel is both light-hearted and funny over the “Mad Collab” riddim, giving his pops fashion daps (“Mi pattern mi daddy from mi was a youngster”), explaining proper Wallabees hygiene (“Toothbrush get out the dust fast”), and styling a whole look (“Real badman no model inna shorts”). He also allowed his protégé, a young upstart named Popcaan, to bless the track with a verse that includes the line “the queen fi England haffi love off Yardie,” honoring a Jamaican predilection for the British footwear brand Uptown Yardie that reflects Jamaican migration to England. But more than anything, “Clarks” offers Kartel a chance to rep his own shoe rack. As he told The Guardian in 2010, “I personally have more than 50 pair of Clarks. I have more than there are states in America.” –Julianne Escobedo Shepherd\n\nListen: Vybz Kartel, “Clarks” [ft. Popcaan and Gaza Slim]\n\n160.\n\nOdd Future: “Oldie” (2012)\n\n“Oldie” is a Russian nesting doll where the prize at the center is the first Earl Sweatshirt appearance following his fabled exile in Samoa. Though the last song on The OF Tape Vol. 2 features the whole crew—even Frank—taking turns rapping, the whole point is that one verse. It’s a knotty, 40-bar exercise that confirmed what those who’d waded through Tumblr to find his early work already knew: bar for bar, Earl is a generational talent, impervious to hype. A few years later, on his album I Don’t Like Shit, I Don’t Go Outside, Earl plainly stated what had been true all along: “If I’m on the track, these niggas skip to me.” –Paul A. Thompson\n\nListen: Odd Future, “Oldie”\n\n159.\n\nKaty B: “Katy on a Mission” (2010)\n\n“Katy on a Mission” began as “Man on a Mission,” a dubstep cut by producer Benga. But then Katy B’s remake went Top 5 in the UK, decisively punting out the titular “Man,” and making the young London singer not just the face of underground dance music, but a mirror for dance-pop at large too. Katy is neither a belter nor a cooing soubrette but an everygirl, imbuing her vocals with relatable frankness and yearning. On “Katy on a Mission,” she’s both a poised singer—her vocal tenses and slacks alongside Benga’s track effortlessly—and an audience surrogate. She moves back and forth between cool confidence and total surrender at the speed of a strobe light flicker, taking listeners along like a hand pulling them onto the dancefloor. –Katherine St. Asaph\n\nListen: Katy B, “Katy on a Mission”\n\n158.\n\nWaka Flocka Flame: “Hard in da Paint” (2010)\n\nWaka Flocka Flame worked hard to conjure an image of out-and-out raucousness, but his debut record, 2010’s Flockaveli, is sneakily varied: He slides slickly into pockets, at turns vicious or playful; he revels in whatever material goods are right in front of him while still lamenting the way life might have gone better. His booming, Lex Luger-produced warning shot, “Hard in da Paint,” contains all of these well-trodden modes while feeling totally singular. At first he brags about having not only a main bitch, but a girlfriend and a mistress; by the end he’s admitting, “When my little brother died, I said ‘fuck school.’” This is not a “dichotomy of man” thing, where the point is to feel the tension between warring impulses. The point is that this is all happening, all at once. –Paul A. Thompson\n\nListen: Waka Flocka Flame, “Hard in da Paint”\n\n157.\n\nBeyoncé: “1+1” (2011)\n\nWhen Beyoncé performs “1+1” live, she often kneels. It’s a fitting posture for a ballad about the divine nature of love. On the recording, her voice is sparingly framed with a handful of elements—a Prince-esque guitar line, gospel organ, and the shimmer of chimes—so when Bey conjures up a primal growl before launching back into a tender falsetto, there’s little to distract from the sheer force of her vocals.\n\nThe song’s structure is simple: Beyoncé admits that she doesn’t know about something—be it math, guns, or war—and then quickly pivots back to her devotion to her partner, finding reassurance in his strength and permanence. The resulting message is one that’s beautiful in its near-spiritual wisdom: trust in love, and it will anchor and guide you through all of life’s uncertainties. –Michelle Kim\n\nListen: Beyoncé, “1+1”\n\n156.\n\nGirl Unit: “Wut” (2010)\n\nWhat makes “Wut” such a propulsive blast of energy is both its dexterous manipulation of tension and release, and its seemingly hyperdimensional use of texture. Drawing on the dynamics of 808-fueled rap instrumentals, and replete with a mischievous vocal sample, wobbly synths, and well-timed use of an airhorn, “Wut” is one of the cheekiest peak-time tracks to emerge from the transatlantic club scene this decade. It’s one of those impossible-not-to-move-to tunes, a crystallization of the club’s love affair with hip-hop. –Ruth Saxelby\n\nListen: Girl Unit, “Wut”\n\n155.\n\nKanye West: “Blood on the Leaves” (2013)\n\n“Blood on the Leaves” is a microcosm of what made Kanye both great and awful this decade; it was because of everything he did so beautifully that we endured everything else he did poorly. The beat: a 2 Fast 2 Furious-style collision of Nina Simone’s “Strange Fruit” and TNGHT’s “R U Ready” that’s about as tasteful as a 10-car pileup. The vocal: a mangled Auto-Tune yelp about paternity paranoia, cheating, and child support that includes a comparison between serial infidelity and apartheid. The song is about as ugly a piece of music as was made this decade, and yet it was leeringly ugly, purposefully so. The music Kanye was cooking up to feed his overheated imagination was so lurid and tactile that, for this blazing moment and others, it held everything together. –Jayson Greene\n\nListen: Kanye West, “Blood on the Leaves”\n\n154.\n\nJapanese Breakfast: “Everybody Wants to Love You” (2016)\n\nIn “Everybody Wants to Love You,” Japanese Breakfast’s Michelle Zauner offers a vision of romance that is gloriously unrestrained. She lets her imagination run wild as she outlines the course of a hypothetical relationship, jumping from the quiet intimacy of a shared toothbrush to impromptu marriage. “Can I get your number?/Can I get you into bed?” she coyly asks over a celestial synthesizer. “When we wake up in the morning/Will you give me lots of head?”\n\nFeaturing a jangly guitar solo and propulsive backing vocals, the song is deliriously catchy—but with repeated listens, its upbeat surface begins to crack. Is Zauner singing about a new relationship, or is she desperately trying to breathe life into one that has grown stale? Is the repeated title phrase a genuine celebration of attraction, or a mockery of romantic idolization? Like love itself, “Everybody Wants to Love You” is more complex than it first appears. –Quinn Moreland\n\nListen: Japanese Breakfast, “Everybody Wants to Love You”\n\n153.\n\nDanny Brown: “30” (2011)\n\nMore rap careers end at age 30 than begin at age 30. In 2011, Danny Brown was acutely aware of this fact, as he said goodbye to his 20s and made his final push towards rap stardom after spending years trapped in the industry spin cycle. The frantic “30” is imbued with the desperation of a man with his eye on the hourglass, realizing his last best hope is slipping away. What begins as absurdist punchline rap quickly devolves into a catalog of personal chaos. Producer Skywlkr’s horns sound like an accordion, wheezing and deflating cartoonishly, as Brown is terrorized by an alternate future where his lifelong calling goes unrealized. He has visions of OD’ing without knowing his daughter, of dying unloved and unfulfilled. “The last 10 years I been so fucking stressed/Tears in my eyes let me get this off my chest/The thought of no success got a nigga chasing death,” he cries out. Even listening to the song now, in the wake of eight years of triumphs for the Detroit MC, it still devastates. –Sheldon Pearce\n\nListen: Danny Brown, “30”\n\n152.\n\nMiley Cyrus: “Wrecking Ball” (2013)\n\nAugust 25, 2013: During her performance at the VMAs, Miley Cyrus mimes anilingus on another woman, pleasures herself with a foam finger, and twerks all over Robin Thicke. She instantly destroys any remnants of her purity-ring-wearing Hannah Montana image, transforming from America’s Sweetheart into America’s Nightmare in a matter of minutes. That same day, she releases “Wrecking Ball,” the song that ensures she’ll still have a career when the dust settles.\n\nA perfect vehicle for Miley’s burnt-cigarette voice, “Wrecking Ball” spectacularly captures the agony of losing a love after coming on too strong. It’s one of the great torch songs of the 21st century, destined to be wailed by the drunk and heartsick at karaoke bars until the end of time. The video, in which a tearful Miley fellates a sledgehammer and gyrates naked on top of a wrecking ball, will likely be used in highlight reels to evoke “the 2010s” for decades to come, too. Unfortunately, the legacy of both the song and video are tainted by associations with two of the #MeToo era’s biggest villains, producer Dr. Luke and photographer/director Terry Richardson (not to mention Miley’s own myriad controversies). But when that chorus hits like a you-know-what, it’s impossible not to sing along at the top of your lungs. –Amy Phillips\n\nListen: Miley Cyrus, “Wrecking Ball”\n\n151.\n\nGang Gang Dance: “Glass Jar” (2011)\n\nGrown from the same New York art-noise ooze that produced Animal Collective and Yeah Yeahs Yeahs, Gang Gang Dance blurred lines, participating in the Whitney Biennial en route to a global stage. Opening 2011’s Eye Contact, the band’s nearly 11-and-a-half minute “Glass Jar” is prelude, overture, and banger all at once. The song is one of their many continuing tributes to late bandmate Nathan Maddox, who was struck by lightning on a Chinatown rooftop in 2002, and a door to the next phase of their career. First comes a slow shift from spoken-word drift to full-on groove; then, synths that rain down with a classical sense of drama. The drums don’t coalesce into a steady rhythm until slightly more than halfway through. Samples, references, and arty details abound on “Glass Jar,” but the destination is a Brooklyn-style drop, recognized on dancefloors the world over. –Jesse Jarnow\n\nListen: Gang Gang Dance, “Glass Jar”\n\n150.\n\nNicki Minaj: “Beez in the Trap” [ft. 2 Chainz] (2012)\n\nIn 2012, Nicki Minaj was at the center of a burning debate about rap, pop, and credibility. Onstage at New York rap station Hot 97’s Summer Jam concert that June, blowhard DJ Peter Rosenberg blasted her frothy hit “Starships” as the antithesis of “real hip-hop,” adding that it was for “chicks.” It was a small-minded, chauvinist argument—Nicki’s very strength was always about how her wily versatility took rap to unprecedented places—but the concurrent success of “Beez in the Trap” was also a perfect retort. You want “real hip-hop”? Here was Nicki flipping bars over an alien beat as thrilling as the rapper herself, filled with synths and drums that buzz and bang and bubble. That “Starships” and “Beez in the Trap” were from the same album, and hits at the same time, showed precisely who Minaj was: a woman in possession of a strange and singular talent who could appeal to seemingly everyone, from tweens to twinks to rap obsessives. –Alex Frank\n\nListen: Nicki Minaj, “Beez in the Trap” [ft. 2 Chainz]\n\n149.\n\nBjörk: “Stonemilker” (2015)\n\nBjörk spent the decade increasingly entangled in complex experiments involving VR and bitcoin, with each new album presented as part of a wider technological narrative. It felt quietly ironic, then, that her best song of the era would plug into an emotional well older than time: heartbreak. “Stonemilker,” the first track to be taken from Björk’s eighth studio album, Vulnicura, was inspired by her separation from artist Matthew Barney, her raw feelings splattered all across the lyrics. “Show me emotional respect,” she demands on the hook, while volcanic beats pound and strings dive around her. In the future, the song’s VR video will seem as charmingly antiquated as a silent film reel, but its message of fierceness in the face of heartache will remain state-of-the-art. –Ben Cardew\n\nListen: Björk, “Stonemilker”\n\n148.\n\nGoldLink: “Crew” [ft. Brent Faiyaz and Shy Glizzy] (2017)\n\nLong after the summer breezes by, its anthems live on. Hear a song like “Crew,” and everything about the summer of 2017—relationships, moments, the weather on that one Friday you cut out early—comes rushing back in vivid detail. At its core, “Crew” was destined to be a song that put on for GoldLink’s native DMV, but it became so much more. Link’s rapid delivery, Shy Glizzy’s conversational bars, and Brent Faiyaz’s silky throwback melody each feed into each other seamlessly. Together, the trio turned out a track as catchy as it is charming, one that should go down as a memorable addition into the backyard barbecue canon. –Alphonse Pierre\n\nListen: GoldLink, “Crew” [ft. Brent Faiyaz and Shy Glizzy]\n\n147.\n\nElla Mai: “Boo’d Up” (2018)\n\nElla Mai’s breakout single “Boo’d Up” is a luxurious track unconcerned with the passing of time, with a glistening instrumental by DJ Mustard and a vocal that moves through the melody like falling into someone’s arms. It’s also an exceedingly unlikely Top 10 hit. So many factors worked against “Boo’d Up”: the fact that Ella Mai was largely an unknown; that women in R&B, once the genre’s heart, had become the genre’s outsiders throughout the 2010s; that the song’s languid pace, unassuming sound, and besotten emotional clarity weren’t particularly marketable. And then people heard it, and all those factors floated away, irrelevant. –Katherine St. Asaph\n\nListen: Ella Mai, “Boo’d Up”\n\n146.\n\nGunna: “Sold Out Dates” [ft. Lil Baby] (2018)\n\nSo many collaborations lean on clichéd narratives about two artists rising to some grand occasion of shared interest. Atlanta rappers Gunna and Lil Baby, it seems, just want to make a run of impossibly fun songs and enjoy each other’s company. Out of their many team-ups, “Sold Out Dates” is the most infectious—the one where their voices blend to seamless heights, until it’s unclear where one ends and the other takes over. The constantly unfurling chorus leaps across the song’s electric guitar riff, finding one soft landing spot after another. If there is a sports analogy to be made, it is less Stockton and Malone, and more Stockton and Stockton: Gunna and Baby find each other in perfect position, then pass out of it, to an even more perfect position. Their dynamic has the same feel as Watch the Throne-era Kanye and Jay, not trying to make a mark by outdoing each other, just ruminating on the ever-evolving idea of hedonism, and emerging with no answers. –Hanif Abdurraqib\n\nListen: Gunna, “Sold Out Dates” [ft. Lil Baby]\n\n145.\n\nCharli XCX: “Gone” [ft. Christine and the Queens] (2019)\n\nAfter nearly a decade of branding herself as a rave-happy club kid who parties until five in the morning, Charli XCX’s facade cracked. On “Gone,” she feels adrift at an event and spirals into despair. “I feel so unstable/Fucking hate these people,” Charli sings over an ’80s funk-pop beat. These lines about unbelonging also double as a metaphor for the constrictions she faces as a major-label artist who is expected to churn out chart hits but prefers to tweak and deconstruct them instead. Joining the rampage is fellow pop rule-breaker Héloïse Letissier of Christine and the Queens, who descends into paranoia, posing some truly mystifying questions about whether she’s “the smoke” or “the sun.” The madness escalates into a breakdown of glitching vocal chops, metallic clanking, and dramatic power-synth fills. It’s the soundtrack to a mental breakdown, the kind that ensues right before you come back even stronger. –Michelle Kim\n\nListen: Charli XCX, “Gone” [ft. Christine and the Queens]\n\n144.\n\nSpoon: “Inside Out” (2014)\n\nA Spoon song is typically defined by what you can’t hear as much as what you can: They are stripped and reduced to their elements, allowing the band to build music with visible architecture and plenty of open space. All this matters because “Inside Out” is quite possibly the most lush Spoon song ever written. Built on a rigid rhythm that acts as a backbone for a harp solo—not exactly their signature sound—and frontman Britt Daniel’s raspy lyrics about how life can be pretty simple if you know what you want and avoid getting dragged down by everything else, it’s not quite Spoon gone new age, but it also doesn’t sound a whole lot like any other Spoon song. The greatness of “Inside Out” lies not just in its unexpected softness, but in Daniel’s ability to be wise and brash at the same time. Earned wisdom is a part of getting older; rarely does it sound this accomplished. –Sam Hockley-Smith\n\nListen: Spoon, “Inside Out”\n\n143.\n\nRick Ross: “B.M.F. (Blowin’ Money Fast)” [ft. Styles P] (2010)\n\nYou know those old monster movies, the ones where an almighty beast lumbers through a terrified city, toppling buildings and swatting planes out of the sky as bullets bounce off his torso? At some point, Rick Ross must have leaned forward in his leather chair and thought to himself, What would it sound like if that monster were rapping right now? Ross channeled that energy on “B.M.F.,” his quaking collaboration with producer Lex Luger. For four minutes, the rapper takes the form of an all-powerful, coke-fueled leviathan laughing with maniacal disdain as he demolishes any obstacle standing between him and his bottom line. You can’t stop him. You can’t negotiate with him. All you can do is build a statue in his honor and marvel at the merciless efficiency of his wrath. –Evan Rytlewski\n\nListen: Rick Ross, “B.M.F. (Blowin’ Money Fast)” [ft. Styles P]\n\n142.\n\nRihanna: “Needed Me” (2016)\n\n“Needed Me” offered a clear crystallization of Rihanna as a well-traveled, yeehaw-pioneering outlaw: People needed her, and she needed no one. It should feel normal, but it was thrilling to witness a woman governed only by her own rules, acting like a man. On the other hand, “Needed Me” is tender and sadly wise, a song about someone who is capable of being strong in a relationship and has learned they can’t expect to rely on anyone. And why bother? Put to music with radio heavy-hitters DJ Mustard, Frank Dukes, and Starrah, the song is sexy and savage, a way for Rihanna to flex her unique ability to inhabit the tastes and feelings of both Gen Z and Gen X. It resonated massively but quietly, becoming her longest-charting hit without ever hitting the Top 5. –Naomi Zeichner\n\nListen: Rihanna, “Needed Me”\n\n141.\n\nGil Scott-Heron: “New York Is Killing Me” (2010)\n\nGil Scott-Heron had a love-hate relationship with the city he called home for most of his life. In the mid ’70s, not long after President Ford told the city to drop dead, Scott-Heron wrote a love letter simply called “New York City” extolling the place as beautiful and benignly energetic. Thirty-five years later, when JAY-Z and Alicia Keys were still riding high on their local anthem “Empire State of Mind,” Scott-Heron presented a different, much darker depiction of the city.\n\n“New York Is Killing Me” portrays a place sapped of all promise and opportunity, defined by an alienation and isolation that Scott-Heron suggests is fatal. The production, courtesy of XL Recordings owner Richard Russell, is constricting, as if it’s been breathing exhaust fumes all day. The music is busy yet austere, prodding and cajoling Scott-Heron with jump-rope rhythms, disruptive clatter, and a bassline that pulsates like the jarring rumble of a subway car. “Eight million people, and I didn’t have a single friend,” he sang, his voice heavy with worry and regret. The past tense hurt when the song was released in 2010, and it only stung more when he died a year later. –Stephen Deusner\n\nListen: Gil Scott-Heron, “New York Is Killing Me”\n\n140.\n\nRae Sremmurd: “No Type” (2014)\n\nIn 2014, Rae Sremmurd stepped into the spotlight with the infectious “No Flex Zone,” backed by Mike WiLL Made-It at the height of his superproducer powers. The two baby-faced brothers had a club anthem on their hands, though many were skeptical about their ability as rappers and wrote them off. But within months they topped their first hit with “No Type,” which elevated Swae Lee and Slim Jxmmi from predicted one-hit wonders into bona fide stars. At the song’s irresistible core is Swae’s gliding chorus, but “No Type” is more than just a catchy hook: It established the duo’s yin-yang balance of sparkling melody and raucous energy. –Alphonse Pierre\n\nListen: Rae Sremmurd, “No Type”\n\n139.\n\nIceage: “The Lord’s Favorite” (2014)\n\nIceage mellowed the hardcore chaos and angst of their first two records in favor of tightly-strung cowpunk with “The Lord’s Favorite.” The song finds frontman Elias Bender Rønnenfelt playing the part of a lovesick megalomaniac intoxicated by the allure of expensive wine, cheap makeup, and five-inch heels. In the darkness of a seedy club, these gaudy vices spur Rønnenfelt’s sloshed barfly to proselytize about his divine privilege. “After all I think it’s evident that I am God’s favorite one/And now is the time I should have whatever I desire,” he moans, letting that last word ooze from his lips. As the Danish band kicked up a rockabilly storm, they showed that they have more to offer than clenched-fist angst. –Quinn Moreland\n\nListen: Iceage, “The Lord’s Favorite”\n\n138.\n\nDrake: “Hotline Bling” (2015)\n\nA pastiche artist of the social media age, Drake seamlessly exchanges music and cultural references like a Tumblr teen mashing up Spongebob GIFs—and this is the song that solidified his status as hip-hop’s supreme memelord. Drake first conceived of it as a remix to DRAM’s “Cha Cha,” with producer Nineteen85 flipping Timmy Thomas’ 1972 soul classic “Why Can't We Live Together” onto an impossibly catchy syncopated drum sequence. DRAM and Drake bickered over credit as “Hotline Bling” blew up, largely thanks to a music video that cribbed visual artist James Turrell’s 2013 installation “Breathing Light” and its Instagram-ready rooms bathed in neon pastel tones. Within months, the high priestess of neo-soul, Erykah Badu, made an entire mixtape riffing on the “hotline” concept, expanding it into a treatise on the role of phones in modern society (featuring bars from a Drake soundalike named Aubrey, no less). A veritable human centipede of modern art, the most lasting legacy of “Hotline Bling” may just be the inextricable ties to the work it inspired and was inspired by. –Matthew Ismael Ruiz\n\nListen: Drake, “Hotline Bling”\n\n137.\n\nYaeji: “Drink I’m Sippin On” (2017)\n\nOne of Brooklyn’s most exciting young electronic artists began with deliberate secrecy: Yaeji initially sang in Korean because she didn’t want others to understand her, then came to love those arch, elegant syllables with new ears. Her breakthrough single is clear in that affection; she roves over narcotic synths and trap drums with icy vocal tones, her gently libertine words delivered in an unhurried rap cadence. A bit of English peeps into the bridge—more as an aside than an accommodation—after she’s just murmured the line “That’s not it” in Korean several times, a lovely and winking moment of benign miscommunication. That elastic bass drop, though, can’t be mistaken. –Stacey Anderson\n\nListen: Yaeji, “Drink I’m Sippin On”\n\n136.\n\nCupcakKe: “Duck Duck Goose” (2018)\n\nSending nudes of such high quality that the recipient uses up all their data. Comparing a dick to the Statue of Liberty. The lines, “Coochie guaranteed to put you to sleep so damn soon/Ridin’ on that dick, I’m readin’ Goodnight Moon.” These are some of CupcakKe’s tamer moments on “Duck Duck Goose.” The Chicago rapper’s salacious humor is on full display here, in an endless barrage of X-rated jokes. The track also shows that she can spit better than anyone in the room, and is able to lace her verses with the wit, puns, and vivid imagery of an elite songwriter. CupcakKe delivers it all over an instrumental ready for an overstuffed, sweaty club—the perfect place to experience her brilliance. –Alphonse Pierre\n\nListen: CupcakKe, “Duck Duck Goose”\n\n135.\n\nRobyn: “Honey” (2018)\n\n“Honey” is one of Robyn’s filthier tunes—a 3 a.m. booty call set to a pulsing house beat. The song flows slowly, picking up rattling hi-hats and strobing synthesizer as it oozes along the dancefloor. Meanwhile, the Swedish star allows plenty of space for her visuals to bloom—the “strands of saliva” laced with glitter, the emeralds glinting on pavement. Each syllable is drawn out like taffy, and her voice hovers just above a whisper, as if she wants you to lean in a little closer. But her message is so clear there’s no need to shout it: A decade after she danced alone, Robyn made a triumphant return to the discotheque. But this time, she won’t be leaving solo. –Madison Bloom\n\nListen: Robyn, “Honey”\n\n134.\n\nKamasi Washington: “Truth” (2017)\n\nKamasi Washington is an artist who needs room to meditate, sculpt, engineer. His songs, each their own island of brewing affect, are where his ideas find pulse, where they’re outfitted with all the sensory trademarks that accent his catalog. “Truth” is the finest, and perhaps most-psalm-like, of the saxophonist’s musical regions—the wet bass, the godly orchestral wails, the intoxication and pure-cut adrenaline reminiscent of master architect Phraroah Sanders. It’s Washington’s very own Odyssey—only funkier, Afro’d, and regaled in a Senegalese dashiki. You know, king shit.\n\nOriginally composed for an exhibit at the 2017 Whitney Biennial and later packaged as the closer on Washington’s Harmony of Difference EP, “Truth” is about journeys: spiritual, musical, human. It’s a track so complexly layered in its artistic command that it places him alongside historians who’ve mined the folkways of Black Los Angeles in their work, from poet Wanda Coleman and director John Singleton to visual artist Betye Saar and producer DJ Quik. Listen closely and you’ll hear the tension and swoop of life, the emotional velocity of love, the drama of drawn breath. –Jason Parham\n\nListen: Kamasi Washington, “Truth”\n\n133.\n\nFuture: “Mask Off” (2017)\n\nFuture’s music constantly dramatizes the tragedy of excess and indulgence by celebrating those very things. The strategy should be nearly impossible to pull off, and yet the Atlanta star is one of the most gifted stylists in contemporary rap. “Mask Off,” his highest-charting single, should be an over-the-top breaking point—he repeats the words “molly” and “Percocet” in the chorus more than he does the title. But still he rises to the occasion by plumbing the depths of drug abuse. Future offers his chilling description of lean in two words—“my guillotine”—while a flute sample of “Prison Song,” from the 1978 musical Selma, a tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement, snakes around his vocals. “Cold chills, prison cells,” the screwed vocals from “Prison Song” intone at the outro. “Mask Off” is one of Future's most cartoonish songs, but perhaps that’s the best way to encapsulate a reality that’s careening dangerously into the unreal. –Ross Scarano\n\nListen: Future, “Mask Off”\n\n132.\n\nKurt Vile: “Baby’s Arms” (2011)\n\n“Baby’s Arms” is the sound of Kurt Vile’s slacker-Zen persona snapping suddenly into focus. The opening track of 2011’s Smoke Ring for My Halo felt like a reintroduction for the Philadelphia songwriter, who had previously hidden behind a curtain of reverb. Working with his band the Violators, producer John Agnello, and an expanded cast, Vile replaced the bleary atmosphere of his earliest releases with crystalline finger-picking, and the mumbled aphorisms with odes to his loved one. “Baby’s Arms” is cool and sweet, intimate and resonant. It sounds full while barely rising above a whisper. –Jesse Jarnow\n\nListen: Kurt Vile, “Baby’s Arms”\n\n131.\n\nChromatics: “Kill for Love” (2012)\n\nJohnny Jewel takes a lot of flack for perfectionism, but listen to a song like “Kill for Love” and the infamously exacting Chromatics ringleader looks a lot more rational. The title track from the group’s 2012 album is their mission in miniature: the sound of ennui in search of bliss. Ruth Radelet’s deceptively blasé vocal performance articulates the craving for novelty lurking within habit: “I drank the water and I felt all right/I took a pill almost every night/In my mind, I was waiting for change.” The fractured synth stabs are sharp enough to split geodes; the guitars dizzy and sentimental, melty and echoing; the cymbal rattles nonstop. Under the anxiety and damage are the same elemental urges, where every momentary escape holds the promise of nothing, now and forever. –Anna Gaca\n\nListen: Chromatics, “Kill for Love”\n\n130.\n\nA$AP Rocky: “Peso” (2011)\n\nDid any rap song this decade open with five words more immediately iconic than “I be that pretty motherfucker”? From the moment “Peso” broke, it was clear that it was going to vault A$AP Rocky to a stardom built atop sounds from Memphis and Houston, but presented as the New Yorker’s alchemic birthright. In the video, he mugged with diamond teeth and coiled-up charisma—shirtless, venomous. The money started rolling in, followed soon after by the jokes: Can you believe he’s named after Rakim but he raps like this? And true, nothing about Rocky’s music is as intricate, groundbreaking, or downright mean as the great stars of New York’s past. But you can’t tell him he isn’t pretty. –Paul A. Thompson\n\nListen: A$AP Rocky, “Peso”\n\n129.\n\nLorde: “Royals” (2013)\n\nAt the start of the decade, pop music taught teenagers what their desires were, not the other way around. According to the radio, teen dreams were filled with earth-shattering parties and unconscionable excess tracked to wall-of-sound synth production best suited for football stadiums. And then New Zealand’s 16-year-old Lorde strolled into the charts like a supremely over-it exchange student, singing her chilly, nearly a capella manifesto about just how tired she was of songs about tigers and jet planes and Cadillacs.\n\nWhile “Royals”’ pillory of rap-video tropes attracted accusations of racism, the song propelled Lorde to stardom and transformed pop in the process. In the years since, the genre has grown bleaker, replacing maximalist odes to excess with bummed-out songs stressing isolation and anxiety. And a new generation of artists who speak to the same sense of teen ennui—Halsey and Clairo and Billie Eilish—have proliferated, working to override the industry’s male gaze instead of playing into it. As it introduced a new kind of pop star, “Royals” challenged the world’s biggest artists to be not just enviable, but relatable. –Hazel Cills\n\nListen: Lorde, “Royals”\n\n128.\n\nYoung Thug: “Danny Glover” (2013)\n\nIn 2013, Young Thug descended from an unknown planet equipped with a language that everyone was dying to learn and a melody that reshaped what we thought we knew about rappers who sing. For many outside of Atlanta, “Danny Glover” was their introduction to this otherworldly persona. Thug raps fast and coos punchlines that stick: “I don’t like using profanity, but the Young Thugger will gut you.” He has quirks on top of quirks, but they’re all coddled inside go-to producer Southside’s signature trunk-rattling hi-hats and 808s. When “Danny Glover” arrived, Thug sounded like no one else; now it’s hard to imagine what rap would sound like without him. –Alphonse Pierre\n\nListen: Young Thug, “Danny Glover”\n\n127.\n\nJames Blake: “CMYK” (2010)\n\nJames Blake charted the next step in bass music’s evolution with “CMYK.” Sampling both Kelis and Aaliyah, the song looked backward to late-’90s R&B, whose ribbon-like vocals and plush harmonies would become hallmarks of the young British producer’s music. More important was what he did with those vocals: chopping, re-pitching, and layering them with his own processed voice, creating a strange, hybrid call-and-response that floated, web-like, over synths as spongy as marshland. It was the sound of a new world coming into focus, and it would guide his music for years to come. –Philip Sherburne\n\nListen: James Blake, “CMYK”\n\n126.\n\nCiara: “Ride” [ft. Ludacris] (2010)\n\nIn her video for “Ride,” Ciara shows off her remarkable dance skills and sheer athleticism. She also straddles a mechanical bull while wearing a drenched undershirt. BET reportedly banned the sultry clip from its airwaves—a decision Ciara called “very unfortunate” and refused to back down from, never making a toned-down version for them. She didn’t need their cosign. On “Ride,” the Atlanta singer flaunts her artistic command, meeting the track’s distorted beat with an almost-clipped vocal performance that underscores her confidence. Not even an audaciously horny Ludacris feature can derail Ciara’s show: She makes no concessions. –Matthew Strauss\n\nListen: Ciara, “Ride” [ft. Ludacris]\n\n125.\n\nLykke Li: “I Follow Rivers” (2011)\n\nLykke Li once compared the overwhelming desire that ignited “I Follow Rivers” to a “nature force,” one in which you’re at the mercy of another person so completely that “you almost have no voice.” She expresses that cataclysmic metaphor in a storm of stomping girl-group drums, dissonant organ, and stuttering vocals. The song signaled an about-face from the more delicate, hushed tracks she first broke out with, affording her a deeper layer of darkness that she’d then yet to unearth. She may have been simply trying to satisfy some serious thirst on “I Follow Rivers,” but her pained, lusty delivery gives her yearning a cosmic pull. –Eric Torres\n\nListen: Lykke Li, “I Follow Rivers”\n\n124.\n\nNicki Minaj: “Super Bass” (2010)\n\nOne of the reasons “Super Bass” is such a banger is its emotional depth: Just take a close listen to the mournful chords that run beneath the verses, providing contrast and context for the track’s hot-blooded desire, as well as its siren call to party. Having shared a male-gaze-flipping list of what she finds attractive in a man, Nicki Minaj’s quickfire bars race the beat to the chorus, which “boom badoom boom” bursts like a rainbow after a downpour. A trance-y bridge with digital strings seals the deal on this masterclass in contemporary pop. –Ruth Saxelby\n\nListen: Nicki Minaj, “Super Bass”\n\n123.\n\nClairo: “Bags” (2019)\n\nClairo’s Claire Cottrill had uploaded plenty of relatable and catchy bedroom pop songs before “Bags”—including her viral hit “Pretty Girl,” which lamented the unfair sacrifices women often make in their romantic relationships—though they ultimately felt slight, like she was holding something back. The lead single of her debut album, Immunity, reintroduced her with new vigor and undeniable shine. Co-produced with Rostam, “Bags” leaves her lo-fi origins firmly in the past. The song is a flurry of action as drums shimmy, synths whirr like insect wings, and keys clamor drunkenly, yet Cottrill’s voice is composed and calm as she recalls her love walking out on her. It vividly captures the tremendous effort that goes into maintaining a cool façade after the door slams shut. –Vrinda Jagota\n\nListen: Clairo, “Bags”\n\n122.\n\nPlayboi Carti: “Magnolia” (2017)\n\nThere are album artists and singles artists, and then there’s Playboi Carti, a rapper whose work is most ravenously devoured via compressed-to-hell snippets ripped from Instagram. Hailing from the most anarchic corners of the social internet (but also Atlanta), Carti is someone whose promise will always outpace his official output, and that is by design. “Magnolia” is the rare moment when all his significant skills are put to use in the same direction: It’s a sinister song with an instantly quotable hook that otherwise functions mostly as an extended ad-lib. The hit also served as producer Pi’erre Bourne’s national introduction, launching him from relative obscurity to rap production’s A-list. “Magnolia” is the single best distillation of Carti and Pi’erre’s chemistry, which, amid rap’s rapidly moving generational drift, has already spawned its own legion of pounding, skeletal imitations. –Paul A. Thompson\n\nListen: Playboi Carti, “Magnolia”\n\n121.\n\nDJ Rashad: “Feelin” [ft. DJ Spinn and Taso] (2013)\n\nFootwork’s relationship to time has a lot to do with a kind of musical sleight-of-hand. Some of the genre’s sonic elements run at triple-time while others dawdle, yet a sense of urgency remains consistent. And no one has ever wielded that energy as fluidly as DJ Rashad. “Feelin,” from 2013’s Double Cup, the only album he released before his death the following year, pivots off a languid sax riff from Roy Ayers’ “Brand New Feeling” and distills soul singer Merry Clayton’s formidable vocal into animated squiggles that ride atop Rashad’s frenzied beat. (It’s worth noting that members of Rashad’s Teklife crew, DJs Spinn and Taso, joined the producer in fleshing out “Feelin” from an earlier version he released in 2012.) Ayers’ original is about the transformative power of the first flush of love. Rashad’s take is more a rumination on the everyday search to feel something—anything—amid the frantic pace of life. –Ruth Saxelby\n\nListen: DJ Rashad, “Feelin” [ft. Spinn and Taso]\n\n120.\n\nJustin Bieber: “Sorry” (2015)\n\n“Sorry” is a strange creature. By grafting a fashionably clipped pop melody over a retro, Shabba Ranks-inspired Caribbean fusion beat, producers Skrillex and BloodPop created one of the best tropical house hits of the decade. The ethereal hook, crafted from Justin Bieber’s pitched and manipulated vocal, squares off against a synth horn line and a surging drop. But what truly elevates “Sorry” are its witty lyrics: “I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice/By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times,” Bieber coos, managing to sound pensive, subdued, and even a little sexy at the same time. That this fallen teen idol, the decade’s emblem of white male petulance and bad-boy behavior, was crooning for redemption and second chances in an age of #BlackLivesMatter protests—especially in the context of his enduring appropriation of urban culture—shouldn’t be lost on anyone. –Jason King\n\nListen: Justin Bieber, “Sorry”\n\n119.\n\nFleet Foxes: “Helplessness Blues” (2011)\n\nHere is an anthem for anyone who has felt adrift, abandoned, unsure of their purpose in the world. The title track to Fleet Foxes’ impressionistic second album revealed a more intriguing side of frontman Robin Pecknold; something dark and complex had lurked beneath the songwriter’s soaring harmonies from the beginning, and “Helplessness Blues” represented all of his neuroses writ large. In the verses, he contemplates what it means to be useful, to others and to yourself, before the song’s passionate strumming rips open to reveal miles of wide-open drum fills and dreams of a simpler life in (where else?) the country. “Someday I’ll be like the man on the screen,” Pecknold claims in the song’s closing seconds. It’s a line that’s just ambiguous enough to drive home how frequently his generation has caught a glimpse at a different life and, for a brief moment, pondered the worth of the tools we’ve been given. –Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nListen: Fleet Foxes, “Helplessness Blues”\n\n118.\n\nTravis Scott: “Sicko Mode” [ft. Drake] (2018)\n\nBy any conventional wisdom, a five-minute, three-part suite of a song should have never become a phenomenon in a climate where dwindling attention spans are leading to shorter and shorter hits. But “Sicko Mode” is fueled by the power of Travis Scott and Drake, two of the era’s defining rappers, operating at an energized high. The song’s first part is a short Drake verse that cuts off abruptly—a tease that only makes you want more. Once the funky second beat hits, you forget about Drake as Travis takes center stage with some of the best rapping of his career. The gradual build meets a grand finale, where Travis and the Toronto icon fuse for one of the decade’s signature back-and-forths. –Alphonse Pierre\n\nListen: Travis Scott, “Sicko Mode” [ft. Drake]\n\n117.\n\nUsher: “Climax” (2012)\n\nUsher once ruled R&B so decisively that the music industry spent over a decade churning out clones of him. But by 2010, he was reduced to guesting on anonymous Max Martin and will.i.am tracks, just another pop singer. Then came “Climax,” which single-handedly rescued his critical reputation from lyrics like, “Honey got some boobies like wow, oh wow.” Co-produced by an uncharacteristically restrained Diplo, the 2012 hit was quickly compared to alt-R&B newcomers like James Blake and the Weeknd. But instead of conveying intense feelings with a chilly shrug, Usher is clearly pained as he eulogizes a failing relationship in a lonely falsetto. The verses try to build, don’t, try again, don’t again. At one point, Usher abruptly turns the whole thing into what seems like a final roaring emotional plea, a would-be climax, but it isn’t enough, and the track recedes again. As a match of song to message, it’s brilliant. As a microcosm of Usher’s career, it’s sadly prophetic: He would spend the rest of the decade trying to recapture “Climax”’s highs. –Katherine St. Asaph\n\nListen: Usher, “Climax”\n\n116.\n\nBurial: “Kindred” (2012)\n\nAgonizingly, Burial never gave us a proper follow-up to his classic 2007 album Untrue this decade, instead resorting to intermittent singles and EPs. But this strategy still resulted in tracks that lived up to the mysterious producer’s lofty legacy, none more so than “Kindred.” While still rooted in his lifelong obsession with the feral jungle choons of his youth, the song sunk even deeper into the turbidity of our modern world, embracing decay and loss much like William Basinski’s The Disintegration Loops did a decade prior. “Kindred” feels haunted, its errant noises both disrupting the flow and somehow cohering everything into a jaw-dropping, 12-minute opus. It’s a corrupted symphony of a dozen open YouTube tabs, the sound of the flames burning all around us. –Andy Beta\n\nListen: Burial, “Kindred”\n\n115.\n\nThe Weeknd: “The Morning” (2011)\n\nHere is the pop American Psycho, a work that sums up all that’s decadent and a little disgusting about our era. It’s also the greatest song the Weeknd, that dark knight of R&B, ever made. Ostensibly a druggy party track, it’s called “The Morning” as if to dare us to look at the bacchanal in the glare of day, when the abandoned Solo cups are spilled onto the carpet. It was Abel Tesfaye’s first big statement to the world, so resonant it would make him famous: There are strippers and codeine and money atop a hungover tempo that feels like a symbol of generational malaise. “The Morning” might even qualify as horror, as Tesfaye refers to himself and his friends as “zombies of the night”—a pretty terrifying way to characterize a bar crawl. The song made the Weeknd an unlikely yet unflinching chronicler of fucked-up times, the man we’ll put on the stereo when we want to remember exactly how good and terrible it all felt. –Alex Frank\n\nListen: The Weeknd, “The Morning”\n\n114.\n\nDaft Punk: “Get Lucky” [ft. Pharrell] (2013)\n\n“Get Lucky” debuted as a four-bar loop in a commercial, which Daft Punk’s obsessive fans promptly re-looped and re-looped until it lasted 10 hours. When the full song finally arrived, the instrumentation was pretty much just those four bars over and over, and it was still engrossing. That’s the thing about this song: It’s so simple someone made a chintzy MIDI version of it, but so sinuous that it’s also inspired debates by music-theory journals about what key it’s in. It’s clearly a ’70s pastiche, but it also sounds immediate, even before the robo beeps and boops come in.\n\nDaft Punk take the right parts of this song either incredibly seriously or not seriously at all. The disco groove is an immaculate, unironic homage to Nile Rodgers’ Chic, produced alongside the man himself, who plays guitar on the song. The irony is saved for the lyrics, where Pharrell does not even remotely try to keep a straight face while singing his lines about “the legend of the phoenix.” After four lines, he gives up the philosophizing and focuses on the task at hand: getting lucky. But unlike the other huge disco-funk hit of 2013, “Blurred Lines,” this song doesn’t come off too sleazy—there just isn’t enough there. Within those four bars, it’s hard to hear anything but precisely executed joy. –Katherine St. Asaph\n\nListen: Daft Punk, “Get Lucky” [ft. Pharrell]\n\n113.\n\nJenny Hval: “Conceptual Romance” (2016)\n\nIn theory, the Norwegian artist Jenny Hval set out to create an experimental pop album about period blood and vampires with 2016’s Blood Bitch. Really, the record was a deeply accomplished inquiry into the possibility of a feminine sound that gravitated towards the grotesque. At its emotional core is “Conceptual Romance,” a song that floats like a cloud, its hazy procession tempered by the rigor of Hval’s lyrics. A self-described love letter to Chris Kraus’ 1997 novel I Love Dick, which helped shape a generation of feminist artists and intellectuals, “Conceptual Romance” is about the mind-altering power of infatuation. “My heartbreak is too sentimental for you,” Hval croons, slyly chipping back at emotionless masculinity. Between each dreamlike note, “Conceptual Romance” acknowledges thinking and feeling as equally consequential pillars of our lives. –Jenn Pelly\n\nListen: Jenny Hval, “Conceptual Romance”\n\n112.\n\nParamore: “Ain’t It Fun” (2013)\n\nAfter three albums of careening mall-punk thrills, Paramore reinvented themselves with “Ain’t It Fun.” Still their highest-charting single, the song brought groove and soul to their sugar-rushing sound—not to mention a gospel choir and real-world resilience. “It’s easy to ignore trouble/When you’re living in a bubble,” Hayley Williams sings, but this is the sound of the bubble of youth freshly burst, of beginning to smash your rose-tinted glasses, of not looking back. Williams has never sounded more monumental or self-possessed. “Ain’t It Fun” proved Paramore to be a legitimate pop force, authors of a new, genre-blurring paradigm of what Top 40 guitar-rock could sound like in the 2010s. They may have made their name on rollercoaster hooks fit for Warped Tour—influencing the likes of Snail Mail, Princess Nokia, and Lil Uzi Vert in the process—but here they grew into themselves, anticipating the influence of blown-up Hot Topic emo in the unlikeliest of places. –Jenn Pelly\n\nListen: Paramore, “Ain’t It Fun”\n\n111.\n\nA$AP Ferg: “Shabba” [ft. A$AP Rocky] (2013)\n\n“We were always weirdos,” Ferg once said of his A$AP cohort, and the proof is this song, which remains a New York party staple six years later. There’s nothing formulaic about pairing a menacing sample from a twisted ’60s horror flick about a family scalping business with lavish praise for Jamaican dancehall king Shabba Ranks—which makes it perfectly appropriate for Ferg and his crew. Along the way, there are bizarre, ear-twisting moments like Ferg’s full-bodied “Master Bruce!” yell and the unsettling, falling-down-a-mineshaft ad-lib that comes immediately after. The real Shabba Ranks makes a cameo in the video, and the gold jewelry enumerated in the chorus is true to his powerful life, but the strange details—the guts of the song—are Ferg’s alone. –Ross Scarano\n\nListen: A$AP Ferg, “Shabba” [ft. A$AP Rocky]\n\n110.\n\nChairlift: “I Belong in Your Arms” (2012)\n\nBrooklyn synth-pop aesthetes Chairlift were a sneakily influential act right up until their split in 2016. Along with fellow blog-era Columbia signees Passion Pit and MGMT, their off-kilter approach to pop songwriting resonated throughout the music industry; dig through the roster of any major label at the start of this decade and you’d find a few acts who were trying to replicate Caroline Polachek and Patrick Wimberly’s approach, albeit without the duo’s left-of-center weirdness. “I Belong in Your Arms” is the crown jewel of their strongest album, 2012’s Something. Polachek delivers lyrics as if she’s gasping for air, spitting stream-of-consciousness non-sequiturs (“Banana split/Honestly/You’re my remote controller”) amid drum machines and synths so perpetually ascendant that they touch the sun. What comes through is the giddy sensation of falling so deeply in love that nothing quite makes sense except a warm embrace. Giving so much of yourself to someone else is always a risky proposition, but for three and a half minutes, Chairlift make the act of devotion sound worth it. –Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nListen: Chairlift, “I Belong in Your Arms”\n\n109.\n\nDrake: “Nice for What” (2018)\n\nAubrey Graham took a confident leap of faith in himself by rapping on a sample of Lauryn Hill’s bad-boyfriend soul classic “Ex-Factor” in “Nice for What,” a track that stepped out brazenly on a bounce beat with extra vocals from NOLA icon Big Freedia. But Drake’s message landed like a grown man’s mea culpa for the dog gospel he’s spread for much of the decade—a twerking devotional to all the Insta queens who’ve been wronged by rudely emotional, blame-denying men like Drake. As often as he’s been dismissed as making “music for girls,” the rapper really did so in good faith with “Nice for What,” a celebration of self-sustaining women who keep it moving—“had a man last year, life goes on”—and prefer glowing up alongside their crew to mollifying sweet-talking dudes. The song’s video had director Karena Evans female-gazing upon a cast of accomplished women—Misty Copeland, Tracee Ellis Ross, Olivia Wilde, Tiffany Haddish—making Drake’s magnanimity seem that much more legit. Fatherhood matured him, maybe; perhaps he’s even graduated from the Supreme rug and basketball hoop in his bedroom. –Julianne Escobedo Shepherd\n\nListen: Drake, “Nice for What”\n\n108.\n\nGirlpool: “Before the World Was Big” (2015)\n\nThe title track from Philadelphia duo Girlpool’s debut album, Before the World Was Big, distilled the anxieties Harmony Tividad and Cleo Tucker faced as their little band took off, painting an honest portrait of what it means to come of age in the 21st century. The song starts with the amateurish tinkling of a xylophone, the type you might find on the floor of a child’s bedroom. Its delicate notes are pierced by a prickly guitar before Tividad and Tucker launch in, singing in tandem. Together, they reminisce about how easy life felt when they were childhood friends, when reality confined itself to the surrounding neighborhood and the complexities of life had not yet made themselves known. Together, they stand on the precipice of adulthood and eulogize a time when the future was just another question waiting to be answered. –Gabriela Tully Claymore\n\nListen: Girlpool, “Before the World Was Big”\n\n107.\n\nFetty Wap: “Trap Queen” (2014)\n\nOn its face, Fetty Wap’s “Trap Queen” is as straightforward as its opening line: “I’m like, ‘Hey, what’s up, hello?’” Made up of only a handful of rhyme schemes, it’s a pop-rap song designed to burrow into your head and never escape, complete with glittering trap production and a drug-pushing, Bonnie-and-Clyde-type love story. What prevents it from being overly repetitive, though, is the New Jersey rapper’s irregular voice; his electronically enhanced vibrato is so deep and tremulous, it welcomed comparisons to yodeling. But like Roger Troutman of Zapp and other funk pioneers of the past, Fetty used effects not to sanitize or correct his voice, but to inject even more emotion into it. So every time he sings, “Baby, yeahhhh,” each slightly mechanical crack and quiver rings with extra devotion. –Michelle Kim\n\nListen: Fetty Wap, “Trap Queen”\n\n106.\n\nChristine and the Queens: “Tilted” (2015)\n\nWhen chart-dominating acts like Ed Sheeran have fashioned superstardom from a corny outsider narrative, where does that leave the real weirdos—the ones who don’t even fit the basic binary of high glamour and humdrum convention? Christine and the Queens’ “Tilted” elegantly articulates that liminal territory, and, more elegantly still, avoids commodifying it with a hashtagable definition. (That satisfying slipperiness may be a quirk of the French singer’s impressionistic approach to writing in English.) “Tilted” makes room for all manner of imbalance as it advocates for neutrality rather than ticker-tape positivity: When she sings “actually” in the line “I am actually good,” the word shrugs off the idea that self-loathing should be a natural state. And when the synths in the verses lurch like warm blood rushes of adrenaline, or arousal, Chris conveys a real-time sense of being overcome by acceptance for the first time. –Laura Snapes\n\nListen: Christine and the Queens, “Tilted”\n\n105.\n\nKendrick Lamar: “DNA.” (2017)\n\nIt’s a rapper’s true test to not only string together rhyming lyrics but to frame them, couching in themes and smoothing big ideas into mantras. It’s why word-soup rap enjoys a cult following but falls on deaf ears to everyday audiences; “keep it simple” is a motto many lyricists can’t hold to. In this way, Kendrick Lamar is an anomaly: As dense as his lyrics can be, he zooms out onto big ideas that are resonant and impactful to the masses. He does this on “DNA.,” a blistering personal statement from 2017’s DAMN. that digs back generations and stamps a moment of collective tensing among Black Americans. In the face of a growing, grinning wave of genocidal hate-speech delivered with the presidential seal of approval, Lamar shouts forth the steely confidence of a people ready to bark and bite back, standing on roots that run centuries deep. The song’s riotous second half lets the final battle wage in all its chaos, as Lamar lets off a breathless stanza that even brought the Pulitzer committee to a hush. –Matthew Trammell\n\nListen: Kendrick Lamar, “DNA.”\n\n104.\n\nAmen Dunes: “Miki Dora” (2018)\n\nIn the primordial ’60s of yore, Californian surfer Miki Dora was a counterculture icon, a lawless criminal, and the distillation of American masculinity—the stuff of Tom Wolfe books and Dennis Hopper flicks. In 2018, he lived on as one of the subjects of Amen Dunes’ fifth album, Freedom. Here, Dora’s life is a mirror to indie rock songwriter Damon McMahon’s own. “Miki Dora” is about the surfer, but it’s also about the end of McMahon’s youth, and what it means for him to grapple with maleness. Those big West Coast waves that Dora surfed half a century ago are rendered endless in the mesmerizing rhythm of the song. Eventually the guitar gets a bit roomier, and McMahon’s perma-stoned vocals rise ever so slightly, but there are no riptides in “Miki Dora,” only surf, sun, and pearl-white flotsam. –Sophie Kemp\n\nListen: Amen Dunes, “Miki Dora”\n\n103.\n\nErykah Badu: “Hello” [ft. André 3000] (2015)\n\nErykah Badu’s 2015 mixtape But You Caint Use My Phone reimagined other artists’ telephone-based songs to delve into the nature of long-distance communication; landlines connected people, she mused, while smartphones more often create distance. The tape’s origin may have been a “Hotline Bling” thought experiment, but its logical endpoint is “Hello,” a dreamy Isley Brothers interpolation (by way of Todd Rundgren) that musically reunites Badu with André 3000, the father of her eldest child. She coos sweet salutations into the receiver, he untangles verses about the terrors of opening up—be it the digital fear of unlocking your phone for a snoopy lover or the analog fear of sitting by, waiting, and having to bear your soul when the phone is finally answered. It feels like two people figuring things out. Roughly half of American households don’t have landlines anymore. But here, the joys and anxieties of twirling a cord around your finger while sinking into a lengthy call aren’t yet antiquated. –Sheldon Pearce\n\nListen: Erykah Badu, “Hello” [ft. André 3000]\n\n102.\n\nKaty Perry: “Teenage Dream” (2010)\n\nIn the context of Katy Perry’s cartoonish early hits, the “Teenage Dream” music video is downright stark. No pyrotechnic breasts, psychedelic candy landscapes, or glow-in-the-dark alien abductions: just Katy, her ripped beau, and some similarly photogenic pals on a sepia-toned drive along the beach. The track is similarly svelte and irresistible: a sunny, major-key melody that shares a lineage with Don Henley’s “Boys of Summer,” New Radicals’ “You Get What You Give,” and other pop hits that arrived pre-loaded with nostalgia and widescreen emotions.\n\nAt the time Perry recorded it, she was attempting to become more than a pop novelty. As if realizing her ambitions mid-sentence, she once explained in an interview, “I want people to… think of me as that pin-up poster in their room—or hopefully I can invade their dreams and be their teenage dream.” And just like that, her music turned bold and sweeping, owing more to the ’80s pop stars with whom she’d soon share chart milestones. Meanwhile, she was midway through her 20s, about to get married, and entering a decade where her propensity for unsubtle gestures of positivity would fall in and out of fashion. But as she gazed toward the camera from the passenger seat in this song’s video, she seemed to have it all figured out. –Sam Sodomsky\n\nListen: Katy Perry, “Teenage Dream”\n\n101.\n\nTNGHT: “Higher Ground” (2012)\n\nListening to “Higher Ground” is like getting hit by a freight truck while chugging a liter of cold brew. The track had TNGHT producers Hudson Mohawke and Lunice bridging the gap between Lex Luger’s dirty South production and modern dance music, preluding (and arguably helping birth) the EDM-trap craze. Its guttural brass line, ferocious breakdown, and vocal sample lifted from Julie McKnight’s 2002 club anthem “Home” combine to erect an imposing electronic music monument. The popularity of the track led its makers to recoil from the spotlight and quietly switch off the TNGHT signal, which is fair enough. In its sheer sonic magnitude, “Higher Ground” is essentially insurmountable. –Noah Yoo\n\nListen: TNGHT, “Higher Ground”\n\n100.\n\nJamie xx: “I Know There’s Gonna Be (Good Times)” [ft. Young Thug and Popcaan] (2015)\n\nWho knew the shy producer from whispery indie rock trio the xx could also throw a great party? Dancehall star Popcaan, trap royal Young Thug, and the sampled voices of ’70s a cappella group the Persuasions meet in “I Know There’s Gonna Be (Good Times),” a snare-rolling standout from Jamie xx’s 2015 solo debut, In Colour. Popcaan’s deft sing-song amplifies the Caribbean roots of Jamie xx’s steel drums, while Thug giddily squeals through the song’s empty space: When he declares, “I’ma ride in that pussy like a stroller,” his glee is contagious. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen: Jamie xx, “I Know There’s Gonna Be (Good Times)” [ft. Young Thug and Popcaan]\n\n99.\n\nMac DeMarco: “Ode to Viceroy” (2012)\n\nA heartfelt tribute to a notoriously terrible brand of cigarettes became a career-making moment for Mac DeMarco. With his inaugural solo mini-album Rock and Roll Night Club, the Canadian singer established himself as a weirdo skeez with a shit-eating grin—a guy whose songs showed tons of promise if you pierced through the thick coats of deep-voiced, slow-motion gimmickry. On “Ode to Viceroy,” he sings tenderly about his unforgiving tobacco addiction and frequent trips to the bodega to buy another pack. “Don’t let me see you cryin’,” he croons. Again, he’s singing to a pack of cigarettes, but any inherent absurdity barely registers. The unlikely love song ends with the sound of him lighting up, inhaling, and collapsing into a fit of echoing coughs. –Evan Minsker\n\nListen: Mac DeMarco, “Ode to Viceroy”\n\n98.\n\nD’Angelo & the Vanguard: “Really Love” (2014)\n\nD’Angelo is such a naturalist that you can almost overlook his eccentricity. “Really Love” evokes the rapture of deep love, the blissful sensation of falling into orbit around the object of your affection. D’Angelo’s honeyed coo, “I’m in really love with you,” is disarming in its sincerity and in its faint aberration—“really” is used oddly, as an adjective rather than an adverb. It sounds off at first, but as the strings quiver and the unquantized drums tick along, every instance of the word becomes a knowing wink, a flash of intimacy.\n\nThe song includes a spoken word intro in Spanish, along with violin, viola, contrabass, sitar, multiple guitars, horns, synths—even a Curtis Mayfield sample. (It shouldn’t be surprising that D’Angelo plays many of these parts.) When “Really Love” was released as the single to Black Messiah in 2014, its richness felt like a statement: D’Angelo had been largely out of sight for 14 years, but he’d never been idle. –Stephen Kearse\n\nListen: D’Angelo & the Vanguard, “Really Love”\n\n97.\n\nSnail Mail: “Pristine” (2018)\n\nUplifted by chugging guitars and crashing drums, Snail Mail’s Lindsey Jordan mourns a relationship that’s crashing to the ground on “Pristine.” The young indie rock musician leans into the grandiosity of her pain, layering anguished thought over anguished thought. Any one line from the song—“I know myself and I’ll never love anyone else,” “Don’t you like me for me?” “I’ll still see you in everything, tomorrow and all the time”—distills the exquisite, all-consuming pain of teenage heartache. With these words, Jordan builds a scarecrow outline of her relationship just to torch it all to the ground. “Pristine” burns and burns, fueled by an urge to create one last beautiful spectacle out of failed romance. –Vrinda Jagota\n\nListen: Snail Mail, “Pristine”\n\n96.\n\nThundercat: “Them Changes” (2015)\n\nFor a virtuoso whose music explores the outer reaches of funk, yacht rock, and astral jazz, Thundercat has always shown a sensitive undercurrent. In his first two solo albums, he slowed down a George Duke love anthem, sang adoringly about his cat, and composed a heart-wrenching tribute to a late friend. “Them Changes,” from his 2015 EP The Beyond/Where the Giants Roam, pairs this vulnerability with one of his best grooves. It’s a burbling stomp about being emotionally and literally destroyed, about how his heart has been ripped from his chest and his floor is covered in blood. (It’s worth noting that this man has a well-documented love of samurai films.) Thundercat seems dazed and panicked here, unable to process what’s happened as he begs for help. Then, in an interlude, his trusty bass falls away and he sings some ethereal oooohs, pinpointing a sweet spot between boldness and fragility. –Evan Minsker\n\nListen: Thundercat, “Them Changes”\n\n95.\n\nRihanna: “Bitch Better Have My Money” (2015)\n\nThis was the music video that launched a thousand pearl-clutching critiques, along with about as many think pieces about its radical significance. In it, Rihanna nonchalantly threatens her accountant with a phrase often wielded by men. In the process, she kidnaps and tortures his wife, before taking a chainsaw to his neck. There are umteen ways to read into the politics of this video: What kind of violence are we sensitized to, and what makes us squirm? What does it look like for a woman to be powerful and angry while also being feminine? How are white women complicit in and benefitting from the bad behavior of white men? But ultimately, determining whether this video is Good and Feminist or Bad and Cancelled is futile; what freedom looks like for any woman cannot be simplified into one set of rules. This is for certain though: “Bitch Better Have My Money” is a song and video about "
