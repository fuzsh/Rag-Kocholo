It was released on September 7, 1999, as the second single from the album. It was written by band member Brian Littrell with Max Martin and Kristian Lundin, who also produced the song along with Rami Yacoub. The song is a \"thank you\" for their fans' encouragement and devotion. Music critics praised its memorable melody, singalong lyrics, and the band's vocal performance. It was also on Blender's list of the 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born.[3]\n\nCommercially, the song became a top-10 hit in over 14 countries. The song became the band's eighth consecutive top-five single in the United Kingdom, peaking at number five in October 1999. The music video, directed by Joseph Kahn, the 18th-most-expensive music video as of 2024, with estimated production costs of over $2,100,000 (equivalent to $3,840,911 in 2023). It also broke the record for longest-running number one on MTV's Total Request Live.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Larger than Life\" was written and composed sometime in 1998 by group member Brian Littrell. When the group traveled to Sweden in early November 1998 to record at Cheiron Studios, alterations and additions were later made to the lyrics by the producers Max Martin and Kristian Lundin. \"Larger than Life\" was initially registered and copyrighted in December 1998 as an unfinished demo, not being released on Millennium preview snippets.[4]\n\nBefore February 1999, to traditionally follow up the template of releasing upbeat numbers as lead singles (i.e., \"We've Got It Goin' On,\" \"Everybody\"), \"Larger than Life\" was intended as the first single from the upcoming album. However, the decision changed upon hearing the completed version of \"I Want It That Way\" in a meeting with Max Martin and Andreas Carlsson in February 1999.[4] Thus, plans were canceled, and \"Larger than Life\" was later released as the second single.[5]\n\nComposition and lyrics\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Larger than Life\" was written by band member Brian Littrell, with additional lyrics by Max Martin and Kristian Lundin. Lundin also produced the song,[6] while Martin and Rami Yacoub produced its \"Video Mix\" version.[7] The song opens with a boisterous talkbox and AJ McLean’s maniacal \"yeah,\" setting an exhilarated tone. Brian Littrell and Nick Carter start singing, \"I may run and hide/When you're screamin’ my name alright/But let me tell ya now there are prices to fame alright.\"[8] In the chorus, they sing about how having legions of fans have changed their lives, \"All you people, can't ya see, can't ya see/How your love's affecting our reality/Every time we're down/You can make it right/And that makes you larger than life.\"[8]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, during his review for Millennium, picked the song as a highlight from the album,[9] while in its review for The Hits: Chapter One, he wrote that \"it may be more tied to its era, but \"Larger than Life\" is infectious pop nonetheless.\"[10] Jim Farber of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the song casts \"fans as the superhuman force in the exchange between listener and star.\"[11]\n\nEmily Exton of VH1 listed the song at number 16 on The 20 Best Backstreet Boys Songs list, writing: \"Such an introspective look at 'the prices of fame' surely deserves a second chapter dedicated to the social media era. Now that we’re older, can Nick please reveal the 'other' way he wishes he could thank us?.\"[12] Danielle Sweeney of The Celebrity Cafe listed the song at number 5 on the Top 10 Backstreet Boys Songs list, writing that, \"This song was BSB’s dedication to all their loyal (and admittedly crazy) fans. Also, it contained the lyric, 'Looking at the crowd and I see your body sway, c'mon / Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c’mon' which gave fans everywhere the tiniest glimmer of hope.\"[13]\n\nCommercial performance\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Larger than Life\" was successful in most countries charted. In Australia, the song debuted at number 3, becoming their highest debut on the ARIA Charts, until \"Incomplete\", which debuted at number one in 2005.[14] In its second week, the song fell to number 7 until it reached number 3, its peak position, again, in its third week.[14] It was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association, for selling over 70,000 copies.[15] In Finland, \"Larger than Life\" was Backstreet Boys' highest-charting single, debuting and peaking at number 2. The song became the band's eighth consecutive top-five single in the United Kingdom, peaking at number 5 on October 30, 1999.[16]\n\nIn New Zealand, the song peaked at number 11,[17] while in Austria, the song peaked at number 15.[18] In France, the song reached number 58.[19] In the United States, the song peaked at number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[20] However, the song peaked at number 6 on the Top 40 Mainstream chart.[20] It also reached number 5 in Canada.[20]\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nThe music video for \"Larger than Life\" was a big-budget production directed by Joseph Kahn,[21] who also directed \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" video in June 1997. The video was shot on a soundstage at Universal Studios on August 12–14, 1999, in Orlando, Florida. The video takes place in a futuristic space setting and includes elaborate special effects and animation, as well as a breakdown with a dance number. It was inspired by the movies Blade Runner and the Star Wars saga.\n\nSynopsis\n\n[edit]\n\nThe video opens with a long pass of a spaceship over the top of the camera as several of the band's past singles cycle through as if on a radio dial. At the same time, a clock turns to the year 3000. A robot, whose face is portrayed by Antonio Fargas, who played the driver in the \"Everybody\" video, awakens the band members from their sleep in pods on the ship. Each of the band members is subsequently featured in their separate vignettes (Nick is with the robots, Kevin is the space fighter, Howie is with the dancers, Brian is fighting with a virus, and AJ is retrieving boxes of information) while being shown together on a large stage doing a dance routine with backing dancers. A breakdown was added to the remix version of the song before the final choruses for the extended dance sequence that continues to the end of the song. The vignettes are intercut with the dance sequence following the breakdown.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn Hamilton of Idolator listed the video at number 3 on their 10 Best Music Videos from the ‘TRL’ Era, writing that, \"Showing that they hadn’t lost the funk after all those slow-to-mid-tempo jams, the BSBs busted out this uplifting tribute to their fans, which served as the second single off 1999′s Millennium. Predictably, they scored another TRL chart-topper and sparked an international panty-melting situation.\"[22]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications\n\n[edit]\n\nRelease history\n\n[edit]\n\nRegion Date Format(s) Label(s) Ref.
