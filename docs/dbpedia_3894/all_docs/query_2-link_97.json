        "text": "Kyoji Yamamoto is a renowned Japanese musician, singer-songwriter, and record producer. He is best known as the leader of the hard rock and heavy metal bands Bow Wow, Vow Wow, and Wild Flag, but he has also had a long, successful career as a solo artist and worked as a guest musician in various projects, including Phenomena and Carmine Appice’s Guitar Zeus. Yamamoto is known for his impressive guitar skills and was one of the first to use the tapping technique. He has been influential in the Japanese rock scene since the mid-1970s. In early July, Yamamoto appeared with Bow Wow at this year’s edition of the Time to Rock Festival in Sweden, and there, I had the honor to meet this Japanese legend. Check out our interesting chat below.\n\nRETURN TO EUROPE\n\nWell, Kyoji, first of all, I want to extend a warm welcome to you in Sweden. If I’m right, this is the first time you have ever been here with any band, right?\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: Yeah! We are now playing in Scandinavia for the first time. I lived in London for three and a half years in the late 1980s, but I never had the chance to come to Scandinavia. So, it was fantastic that Michael Ivarsson invited Bow Wow and Murasaki to this amazing festival. I was truly honored. Michael contacted me through an email link on my homepage, and it was quite sudden when he asked, ‘Do you want to play in Sweden?’ I was like, ‘What?’ It was such a pleasant surprise. Not only me but also many of my Bow Wow fans were really surprised to see us playing in Sweden. If this had happened in the 1980s, it wouldn’t have been so surprising since we played at the Reading Festival and the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. So, it’s not strange, but it’s surprising now. [Laughter] We are very excited, especially seeing the audience’s reaction during the show. At my age, it’s quite thrilling. Do you know my age?\n\nI don’t, to be honest. “Laughs”\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: I’m 68, nearly 70. At my age, it’s rare for Swedish people to want us to play in Sweden, so it usually never happens. So, it was a nice surprise. So anyway, on stage, we did our best despite the technical problems, which were due to a cabinet issue. We gave it our all, and a lot of people loved our performance. I was really glad to hear from many fans how much they enjoyed seeing us live and how happy they were.\n\nFor most people, this was their first time seeing Bow Wow live. However, did you meet anyone at the festival who had seen the band perform in Europe during the ’80s?\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: Yeah, at the signing session, I met some people who had seen us at the Reading Festival in 1982 or at the Marquee in 1983. A lot of people came to see us play at the Marquee in London back then. It was amazing that some people brought old Bow Wow and Vow Wow vinyl records with them. In total, I signed more than 100 vinyl records today. That was another nice surprise because it’s very expensive to import the albums from Japan to here and to the record shops.\n\nTHE STATE OF BOW WOW\n\nBow Wow essentially split in 1983 when you changed the band’s name to Vow Wow and brought in all new members. In 1995, Bow Wow made a brief return, but the actual reunion began in 1998. Since then, the band has been more or less active, playing shows from time to time. So, what is the current status of the band?\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: The 1995 reunion wasn’t a real reunion; it was a new version of Bow Wow with new members. In 1998, the original Bow Wow members, except for the bassist, got together for a concert. The drummer, Toshihiro Niimi, sadly died last year. Our original bass player has totally retired as a musician. But some time ago, the original bass player joined Bow Wow, but only for an encore. Yeah, it happened last year, last summer. And, of course, the audience went crazy because the three of us got together, and the bass player was one of the best performers in the band like Gene Simmons is in KISS. So, anyway, we had to get new support members for bass and drums. We actually call the band Bow Wow G2 now, and it’s because now we have two guitarists, the two original members of the band. Me and Mitsuhiro (Saito) are the last two men in the line now. “Laughs”\n\nBut you now have a stable line-up in Bow Wow G2 with the support members in the band?\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: It’s a stable band. So now I’m acting Bow Wow. And last week, we started Vow Wow again. We decided to do it again for the first time in fourteen years. We did some shows in 2010 but haven’t done anything since that. So, now I have Bow Wow, Vow Wow and Wild Flag—three rock bands. So, I have three bands now, and then there’s my solo stuff. Also, I’m doing some sessions for many people when I have the time.\n\nYou just mentioned Gene Simmons. Could you briefly comment on how it was to support KISS in Japan in the 1970s?\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: We opened for KISS in ’77 and ’78, and they were fantastic. Honestly, before playing with them, I didn’t think they were that good. But their performance on the first night blew me away! They were always perfect live, and they were always kind to us and let us use their P.A. system at full volume. They enjoyed everything to the fullest but never lost their power on stage. It was amazing.\n\nActually, Gene Simmons is coming to tour in Europe soon with his solo band.\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: Oh yeah? What kind of music do they play?\n\nHe plays his own KISS songs, some solo songs and covers. I don’t know for sure because the tour hasn’t started yet.\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: I see. When I saw Paul Stanley with his band four or six years ago in Japan, I was very surprised to find that most of the songs he played were R&B-type songs.\n\nNEW MUSIC IN THE HORIZON?\n\nThe latest Bow Wow album, “Era,” was released in 2005. So, it has been close to 20 years since you released new music with this band. So, what’s the reason for that?\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: The reason is that most of the fans have grown up with us. So, they got older and older, of course. And they love the old songs. [laughter] So maybe, so you know, just imagine that if we play all new songs, then what the crowd reaction would be [laughter] Exactly. And apart from that, I’m doing my solo career, so every year I release new songs, new albums, Kyoji Yamamoto solo albums. So, I think I must be creative. So, for my solo career, I’m doing my creativity in that way. But for Bow Wow or Vow Wow, the people love old songs, and we have enough good songs to play. And it’s often like that we don’t have enough time to play all the songs we would want to. We always have to choose, “Oh, I want to do it, but I can’t do it for that limit of time.” So, I don’t think we need to make any new albums with Bow Wov or Vow Wow.\n\nYou don’t want to make new albums with your bands, but new Kyoji Yamamoto solo albums come out almost every year.\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: I’ve been releasing a new album every year for five years in a row. Working on solo albums is very different from making an album with a band, and I already told you the reason why I’m not doing that. Also, doing a band album and a solo album are totally different things for me. When you’re making a band album, I must consider the other players’ characters and abilities when I’m writing songs for the band. For my solo album, I just focus on what I want to express and use all of my imagination without any genre or limitations. On the solo albums, I play all the instruments. I also write, arrange, mix, and even do the mastering myself.\n\nAre you also doing the drum parts by yourself?\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: Yeah, but I don’t use my hands to play drums. I use a computer to program the drums. I play keyboards, then I play drums, right? So, I do it all by myself.\n\nWhat software are you using in the studio?\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: Pro Tools. I can do it at home anytime, even after a concert, at night, until morning. So, I have a lot of freedom to do that anytime, and there’s no time limit. You know, when I have finished everything, then I can release it. But when I was making a record with a band, there was always a time limit and a cost for everything. So maybe that’s why that kind of relaxing freedom gives me a lot of inspiration to do that. There’s no pressure when I work this way.\n\nTHE BEST ALBUMS\n\nI counted that you’ve released around 60 albums over the course of your career so far.\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: Really? That’s a lot. I haven’t kept a count myself, so I can’t say if it’s 60, 70, or even more. I’m not sure.\n\nWhat if you had to pick a few albums from your entire catalog? Which ones are your favorites?\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: They’re all so different that it’s difficult to choose. The songs or albums I’ve made are like my children, so I can’t say, “Oh, you are the best kid.” Each year brings a new album, so I can’t pick just one. However, there are some albums I particularly like. For solo albums, I always think the newest one is the best—the latest one is always my favorite. I keep doing it that way. “Laughs.” As for Bow Wow, I would say the second album, “Signal Fire,” and “Asian Volcano” are my favorites. I really like “Asian Volcano.” For Vow Wow, I would choose “Cyclone,” the second album, and “Mountain Top,” which is also very good—the last album.\n\nThat was the album with Mark Gould on bass if I remember correctly.\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: Yes, Mark Gould played bass on that album, and it was produced by Bob Ezrin. I’ve always admired Bob’s production work and have wanted to collaborate with him for a long time. In 1990, Vow Wow moved to L.A., where I was introduced to Bob. I went to his house and played him some Vow Wow music, and he liked the band. We got along well, and he agreed to produce us. We created a great album, “Mountain Top,” but our timing was unfortunate because the music scene had changed significantly. The hard rock scene was declining, and we were unable to secure a U.S. record deal. This left us feeling disheartened, leading to frustrations and, ultimately, the breakdown of our relationships. It was a tough time for hard rock and metal bands. Vow Wow disbanded later that same year, and the following year, I formed a new band, Wild Flag\n\nPHENOMENA AND NEIL MURRAY\n\nSpeaking about sessions, one session I want to ask you about is Phenomena II.\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: Oh yeah. Phenomena II. That’s a good album. I love that record.\n\nCan you tell me about that session and how did you come to play on the album?\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: How did I get involved with Phenomena? That was in 1987 after Vow Wow had relocated to London, where it was our home for more than 3 years. Somebody called my management office in London, so actually, I didn’t know why or how they decided to choose us. They chose me and the drummer Toshihiro Niimi, two people from Vow Wow, to play on the record. Before going into the studio, I didn’t know anything about the songs at all. But anyway, it was a great experience and it worked very well. Initially, I was going to play only two songs. I remember that all the band members were in the studio at the same time, so I had to play in front of their eyes. After finishing two songs, the producer Tom Galley and his brother Mel Galley asked me, ‘Why don’t you also play the solo on this song?’ It was a song that I had never heard before, and I was like, ‘Okay, let me hear it once first.’ They said, ‘Okay,’ so I decided to try. Then it went like, ‘Why don’t you try another song?’ In the end, I played five or six songs on the album or something, and they loved it. And that’s how I met Neil Murray.\n\nHow did you end up inviting Neil Murray to join Vow Wow?\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: When the Japanese bass player Kenji (Sano) left Vow Wow for personal reasons, we auditioned another Japanese player and flew him to London for an audition, but it didn’t work out. One of the members asked me, ‘Why don’t you call Neil Murray to join the band?” I knew that Neil was a great bass player. At that time, after he left from Whitesnake following the ‘1987’ album, we knew he was available. So, my bandmates asked me, ‘Why don’t you call Neil?’ I thought it wouldn’t happen and that he would never join Vow Wow. But I called him and suggested we have a jam session at John Henry’s studio. To my surprise, he agreed because he knew me and Toshi from the Phenomena sessions. We played well on that album, so he wanted to give it a try. We jammed, and it worked very well. It was an exciting experience. I still remember the first song we played together was ‘Crossroads’ by The Cream. I had never heard such grooving bass playing; he was amazing. He also loved the way Vow Wow members sang and played. After the jam session, I asked him, ‘We have to record our new album in Ibiza, Spain, but we don’t have a bass player. Are you interested in playing bass for Vow Wow’s new album?’ He said, ‘Yeah,’ and then played bass for the ‘V’ album.\n\nThe album with a black cover with a large yellow “V” in the middle?\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: Yeah, black, yellow V, circles. And after the recording… Anyway, after all the recordings were finished, I asked Neil, ‘We have to do a Japan tour after releasing this record. Are you interested in playing bass for the Japan tour?’ And he said, ‘Yeah,’ because he had nothing to do at the time. Also, he loved our playing on the songs. If he didn’t like us or the music, of course, he wouldn’t have said yes. But anyway, he said yes. So, that happened.\n\nThe first time I heard about Vow Wow was when I saw the video for “Don’t Leave Me Now” on TV. It was frequently played on MTV, and as a big fan of Whitesnake and Neil Murray, I was pleasantly surprised to see him performing in that video.\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: Yeah, yeah. And you know, for the “Don’t Leave Me Now” single, do you know who played bass and who sang all the backing vocals on it?\n\nCan’t remember it right now. Help me out?\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: It was John Wetton from Asia, King Crimson, and Uriah Heep. John Wetton also produced “Don’t Leave Me Now.” I met John Wetton in the “Phenomena” sessions. “Phenomena” connected a lot of good players. So, he played bass and handled all the backing vocals on that song. There was a very thick harmony, and it sounded a lot like Asia [laughter], but we loved it. Yeah, we loved it. And John was very happy about the song.\n\nNeil Murray played on three Vow Wow albums: “V,” “Vibe,” and “Helter Skelter” before he decided to leave the band and join Black Sabbath in 1990. How did that come about, and how did you find out that Neil was leaving?\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: When I was in Tokyo, Neil was in England, and he called me and said, “Sorry, Kyoji, I have to leave the band.” It happened because Cozy Powell had insisted that he join Black Sabbath. Cozy and Neil were very close friends, so Neil said to me, “I can’t say no to Cozy. And as long as Cozy asks me, I want to go.” So that’s how he left Vow Wow.\n\nHave you ever listened to the albums “Tyr” and “Forbidden” that Neil recorded with Black Sabbath?\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: Oh, I haven’t. I didn’t hear those albums. Should I listen to them?\n\nPerhaps you should. They’re interesting albums and quite different from the old Sabbath. By the way, are you still in touch with Neil?\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: Ah, through Facebook. Sometimes, we exchange birthday wishes or similar messages, but we don’t communicate much otherwise.\n\nPerhaps you could send him a message letting him know that you’re finally going to listen to “Tyr” and “Forbidden” and ask for his thoughts on that. [Laughs]\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: Yeah, I’ll do that after I’ve listened to “Tyr” and “Forbidden,” right? I need to listen to them first! [Laughs]\n\nTHE EARLY DAYS OF BOW WOW AND JAPAN MUSIC SCENE\n\nIt’s been said that Bow Wow was the first heavy metal band to come out of Japan. However, when I interviewed Loudness guitarist Akira Takasaki a few years ago, he said that they were the first. So, in your opinion, who was the first metal band to come out of Japan?\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: As a heavy metal band? I think that Loudness was the first heavy metal band in Japan because Bow Wow never said we were heavy metal. We are a hard rock band. So, as for heavy metal, I think Loudness was the first. In Japan, we are regarded as the first hard rock band. That’s how they think there.\n\nBow Wow was formed a few years before Loudness, but by the early ’80s, you were definitely competing for the same market and listeners. How much of a rivalry was there between you, and how well did you get along with each other?\n\nKyoji Yamamoto: A lot of fans think that we are rivals, but we get along well. And Akira is a brilliant guitarist, and I love his sound. He’s a very good guitar player technically, but he’s very different from me. We are totally different players. As I said, Loudness is more of a heavy metal band, but Bow Wow and Vow Wow never thought of ourselves as a heavy metal band. We are more musical, and we also have some progressive rock elements in our music. So, I don’t think we are heavy metal. That’s a big difference. We walk different paths.\n\nIf I’m right, out of all Japanese metal/rock bands, only Loudness and Bow Wow had international careers outside of Japan in the early 80’s?"
