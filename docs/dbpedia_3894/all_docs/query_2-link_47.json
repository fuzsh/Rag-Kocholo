        "text": "But back in the bleak mid-â70s when The Slits embarked on the legendary White Riot Tour alongside The Clash, The Jam, Buzzcocks, and Subway Sect, Viv recalls the rest of the country werenât quite prepared for the four girls:\n\nâWe were like the massive rebels of the tour. The way we looked was much more unusual or far out than the guys, because by now people were used to rock and roll looking guys, but girls in fetish wear, with their t-shirts slashed, hair standing a mile on end and in Doctor Martin boots? They couldnât stand it and they would say we will only have them in the hotel if they walk from the door to the lift and we donât want to see them again till the next day. Everyday the tour manager would threaten to throw us off the tour, Norman the bus driver had to be bribed daily to let us on the bus. It was bloody stressful.â\n\nTessa: âI canât really think of anyone like us before. I think because we were women it was even more threatening because of the way we looked. Especially when we were going out of London it seemed to cause even more shock. I think we got thrown out of one hotel because I had The Slits graffiti-ed on the side of my case. I suppose you have to look at what it followed, the whole â60s apathy thing and the fact that it was a movement, it wasnât just one group. Something had to break at that period. It was probably the worst style ever in the â70s as far as I can remember, it was vomit-making, the style was so horrible, the haircuts, the clothes, the house design, the avocado green bathroom suites.â\n\nBut it wasnât just The Slits being female that made them different, it was the style of their music too. When all the other punk bands were shouting â1234â, The Slits were playing to a different beat. They were amongst the first bands on that scene to draw their inspiration from reggae music and at the time of the White Riot tour they were being managed by Roxy DJ Don Letts. For Tessa, reggae was hugely inspiring to the way she played. âThere were more reggae artists playing live, like Big Youth and Burning Spear, and the film The Harder They Come, which was really influential, and there were a lot of sound systems and shebeen blues clubs. It was just a real time for reggae in the â70s. Before punks had ever made any records there was reggae. Thank God, because it was hugely inspiring. Don Letts was djing at the Roxy club playing pure reggae so we got to know all these songs and even to this day I love Jamaican music, just love it.â\n\nI ask her how the Jamaican community took to four punk girls turning up to their clubs. âMaybe it was more acceptable to be a white woman than to be a white man and be there. In the Ballyhigh Club in Streatham, Ari would just start dancing and be surrounded by a crowd of people. But somewhere like the Four Aces in Dalston, which doesnât exist anymore, it, would be much more of a tense atmosphere, like who do these people think they are, coming into our club. Ari used to go on her own from a really young age, she had quite a nerve, she was 15, but you canât help but like her.â\n\nThe Slits were also the first musicians to point out that women played their instruments in a different way to men, quite a revelation but for Tessa it was the only way she knew. âI like the fact that women do play differently,â she says. âFor me I was always playing with other women so I didnât know any different.â\n\nViv, though, was making it up as she went along. âWe, in a way, tried to fit in with boys and how they played,â she says. âI hadnât been taught an instrument so I was literally making it up as I went along and with things Keith Levene [later of PiL] was showing me, though he wasnât showing me straight forward things. He was teaching me more the mentality than the actual chords. He gave me the confidence to do what I wanted and I would make things up and he would say, âWhat time is that in? It works but it shouldnât.ââ At the time Viv was going out with Mick Jones. âMick didnât teach me anything. Only the guys you donât sleep with teach you something.â\n\nUnlike the other punk bands, The Slits didnât sign to a label straight away in 1977. Viv didnât think the band were ready. âMainly we didnât sign because we knew we didnât sound like we did in our heads. That and the record companies wanted to market us and package us up as sexy punk girls. There really werenât any other all girl bands at the time. We had to wait till someone took us for who we where â\n\nFinally, the band signed to Island in 1978. What was particularly unusual is that Island Records agreed to give them full creative control on everything, from the artwork to the choice of single, something that is still rare in the business today. The bandâs first single, âTypical Girlsâ, was backed with a cover version of Marvin Gayeâs âI Heard It Through The Grapevineâ. It was a song that Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records, thought would give the girls more success, but they were adamant they would go with their own song âTypical Girlsâ as the A-side. Although the band were able to make their own career decisions, they werenât always the most financially-viable. I ask Viv if the term âbloody-mindedâ would be a suitable term to describe The Slitsâ attitude to the music business at the time.\n\nâI think every decision we made, made it difficult for us. We kept thinking âWhy arenât we commercial? Why arenât we on TV?â On the other hand, we were so uncompromising on how we spoke to people, how we did interviews, how we looked, everything was utterly uncompromised. So we led ourselves down this difficult cult route. Which actually, 20 years later, worked out pretty well as it kept The Slits pure and now because we were so uncompromising the band has such a strong identity. But it did mean we made no money and we had no commercial success.â\n\nTheir success seems on a par to a band like The Velvet Undergroundâs in the â60s. Neither bands sold huge amounts of records on release but their influence has been huge and ongoing. But when I ask Tessa about when she first became aware of their now legendary status, she seems blissfully unaware of quite how influential the band have been.\n\nâI wasnât aware at all till I hooked up with Ari a few years ago. She kept going on about how we had influenced the whole Riot Grrrl movement. I didnât get it until we started playing in America and we had an audience out there, a young audience. I was quite shocked.â\n\nBut long before Riot Grrrl, a young Madonna had been in the audience and you can see the influence The Slits had on her style on her first appearances on Channel 4âs innovative music programme The Tube. But again, Tessa has a very grounded view to this. âI think she must have been quite influenced by the way Viv dressed as she came to see us before her career took off but I donât like to go on about things like that. I just think, so what? Everyone is going to get influenced by what they see. I just donât like to blow my own trumpet. I just want to keep moving forward and try and not get egotistical about anything.â\n\nThe Slits released their debut album, âCutâ, produced by legendary reggae producer Dennis Bovell, on the 7th September 1979. By this point drummer Palmolive had left the band and had been replaced by Budgie, who later went on to join Siouxsie And The Banshees. On the albumâs cover, Ari, Tessa and Viv stare defiantly into the camera lens. Like Amazonian warriors they are caked in mud and naked apart from a loincloth. Pennie Smith shot this now legendary image of The Slits in the summer of 1979, almost 30 years ago to the day. In an era where female role models like Katie Price are most often surgically modified into the cartoon image of a woman, and the teacup-wielding Lady GaGa is considered to be outrageous, that image of The Slits seems more relevant than ever. I ask Tessa if they were aware quite how important that shot of them would become.\n\nâI think we knew it was going to cause a storm. But it was an incredibly liberating feeling splashing around in the mud. I canât even remember where the idea came from but it was the perfect setting for it. It just had this ambiguity about it, us against a country house with roses growing up the walls. It got very mixed reactions. I think we just liked to push the boundaries. I spoke to Vivien Goldman and she was working for Sounds or Melody Maker at the time and she took it to her editor. They were saying, they are so fat and ugly we arenât putting that in our paper. They just didnât want to see women like that.â\n\nAt the time the photos caused outrage with one man going so far as to try and sue the record company for crashing his car after seeing the three naked Slits looking down at him from a huge billboard.\n\nAfter the release of âCutâ the bandâs sound became increasingly experimental. In the early 1980s, The Slits formed an alliance with Bristol post-punk band The Pop Group, sharing a drummer (Bruce Smith) and releasing a joint single, âIn The Beginning There was Rhythmâ/ âWhere Thereâs A Willâ (Y Records). The Slits released their second album, âReturn Of The Giant Slitsâ in 1981 and in the December of that year, the band decided to split. Ari was 14 when she joined the band, Tessa and Viv only a couple of years older. Tessa believes they did the right thing. âIt felt like we needed a break,â she says. âWe needed to go off and experience our own adventures. We had grown up together and we had worked so hard, everything was about The Slits. We needed to have our own individual experiences in life. I donât think it was a bad thing and the whole music scene became so squeaky clean in the â80s and I think that was what put me off. Something really switched in the â80s.â\n\nStill, the split didnât come easy. It left a huge hole in each of their lives. Tessa spiralled into heroin addiction and Viv likened the aftermath to being akin to posttraumatic stress disorder. âIt meant so much to me,â she explains. âBut by the time we split up I was burnt out. I couldnât bear to listen to music for about two years, it was terrible. I went down the filmmaking path. I thought that was a better option at the time. In the â80s music got very careerist, it was no longer about expressing yourself.â\n\nAri had twins shortly after the split and left England to live in the jungles of Belize and then Jamaica.\n\nAri Up and Tessa Pollitt reformed The Slits with new members in 2005, and in 2006 released the EP âRevenge Of The Killer Slitsâ. The EP featured former Sex Pistol Paul Cook and Marco Pirroni (ex-Adam & the Ants, and Siouxsie & The Banshees) as both musicians and co-producers. In fact, Cookâs daughter Hollie is a member of the current line-up, singing and playing keyboards. Other members of the reformed band are German drummer Anna Schulte, and Adele Wilson on guitar. I asked Tessa what led her and Ari to getting The Slits back together.\n\nâI hooked up with Ari about five years ago, we hadnât seen each other in years. She had been all over the place in the jungle, in Jamaica and America. I went to see some of her solo gigs and I just got itchy to get on stage again and play some of our old songs. It was like there had been no time gap and we got on like we had just seen each other yesterday. We have led very parallel lives and have been through similar experiences. She had lost her sonâs father, he was shot in Jamaica, and I had lost my daughterâs father, Sean Oliver, when she was five, we have both been widowed.â\n\nViv Albertine joined the group for two gigs in 2008 but decided she didnât want to reform. âThat sealed it for me. I didnât want to go back,â she says. âI felt awkward singing songs like âShoplifitingâ. I am a woman now and still have stuff I want to talk about but I canât be playing songs from 25 years ago.â Viv will be releasing a single of her own later this year and an album though US label Manimal Records. When I ask her what she thinks of The Slits now, Viv tells me, âYou watch Ari on stage even now and she still comes over as something absolutely amazing and different. She has no fear and no body consciousness. She still does something for sexuality and women that I donât think any other woman does.â\n\n2009 is a big year for The Slits. Not only is it the 30th Anniversary of their cult album âCutâ, but this year also sees the release of the first Slits album in 28 years. âTrapped Animalâ will be released in October. The band recorded the record in Los Angeles earlier this year. A superb biography on the band written by journalist Zoe Street Howe (Typical Girls? The Story of The Slits) was also released in April.\n\nAri takes her role as a Slit very seriously and is still hugely conscious about not being pushed into a position she doesnât feel comfortable with. âI am constantly worried about The Slits and haunted about The Slits, that The Slits do not have to sell their integrity or their principles or about being pushed into something we donât want to do. I mean that is a struggle we all have to deal with all our lives anyway.â\n\nI remind her how Joe Strummer had praised them for managing to keep hold of their integrity.\n\nâThe Slits have become something beyond The Slits, bigger than life, bigger than our personalities,â she says. âThey have become very mythical. The responsibility to stay true to ourselves is huge. People need something like The Slits, even if it isnât us. Every time we play, there is always a girl who says, âI am going to start a groupâ. There is always someone who tells us that we have been an inspiration or life changing.â"
