        "text": "DOWNTOWN — Chappell Roan didn’t just dominate Lollapalooza this weekend — she made music festival history.\n\nRoan, who’s seen a meteoric rise to fame after dropping her latest single “Good Luck, Babe!” in April and breaking into the mainstream pop music charts, was the name on everybody’s lips this weekend.\n\nShe also drew one of the largest crowds in Lollapalooza history, a festival spokesperson said.\n\n“Chappell Roan’s performance was the biggest daytime set we’ve ever seen,” said Brittany L’Heureux, a representative with Lolla. “It was a magical moment added to Lolla’s DNA.”\n\nWhile the exact number of attendees at Roan’s set is not known, sources with the festival and Roan’s team told CNN it may have been the biggest set in Lollapalooza history.\n\nAttendance for the fest was 110,000 for each of the four days, L’Heureux said.\n\nLollapalooza started off as a touring festival in 1991 and found its home in Chicago in 2005. The four-day music fest has been held annually in Grant Park since.\n\nTo make room for Roan’s crowd, Lollapalooza organizers switched her to a bigger stage, the coveted T-Mobile stage that also saw headliners Megan Thee Stallion, SZA, The Killers and Blink-182.\n\nThe original Lollapalooza 2024 schedule, released May 23, had Kesha on that stage 5 p.m. Thursday, the first day of the fest. Roan was set to follow at 6 p.m. on the nearby smaller IHG Hotels & Resorts stage.\n\nKesha and Roan’s spots were changed perhaps as early as July 19, when Lollapalooza shared an updated schedule on their social media.\n\nA similar switch happened at Tennesee’s Bonnaroo Music Festival in June: There, Roan made headlines for her massive crowd and head-to-toe green body paint while dressed as the Statue of Liberty, according to CNN.\n\nDubbed the “Midwest Princess” — and living up to that title — Roan, born Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, is known for her 1980s synth- and 2000s pop-inspired music. Her 2023 debut album, “The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess,” has become extreme popularity since Roan opened for Olivia Rodrigo’s GUTS tour in the spring.\n\nThe world’s ascendant star also has a reputation for her signature long red hair and on-stage drag queen persona, switching themes and outfits for each show.\n\nAt Lolla, the queer popstar had a fitness-inspired theme, donning a blue and pink wrestling outfit adorned with stars and black fringes and a lucha libre mask to match.\n\nAlongside swarms of fans dressed in pink, sparkly costumes, Roan recruited some of the strongest people in Chicago to lift weights on stage with her — including Inez Carrasquillo, the strongest woman in North America.\n\n“It was terrifying. How many people were actually in the audience? It was absolutely insane. I never expected in my life to be in front of so many people before, and it was just exciting,” Carrasquillo told Block Club last week.\n\nThe magnitude of Roan’s set raised questions of whether the festival oversold this year, but numbers were comparable to previous years, organizers said. Most two- and four-day tickets sold out days before the festival.\n\nLast year, the mega-fest increased its daily capacity to 115,000 people, with a maximum four-day attendance of 460,000."
