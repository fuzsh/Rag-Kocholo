        "text": "School days are more than just hearing teachers lecture, taking tests, and turning in assignments. It can also be a time in which people develop lifelong friendships and find out more about themselves.\n\nFrom the parties to anticipating summer breaks to showing school pride—artists have always made songs detailing their education days. However you may feel about school, chances are those same emotions and experiences have been channeled in lyrics. So whether you're starting a new school year, or simply find yourself reminiscing about simpler times, here are 20 songs that highlight school life.\n\n1 of 20\n\n“School’s Out”—Alice Cooper\n\nCole Bennetts/Getty Images\n\nAs a student, there’s no greater feeling than knowing summer break is approaching. Rock band Alice Cooper know this feeling all too well in their 1972 hit song “School’s Out.” The band mentions things like not dealing with any books or teachers, because school is finally over. It was only fitting that a school bell rings at the song's end.\n\n2 of 20\n\n“School Days”—Chuck Berry\n\nFrancois Durand/Getty Images\n\nChuck Berry’s 1957 song “School Days” details all the ins and outs of a typical day as a student. He highlights learning American history, eating in a cafeteria, and dealing with other students until the final bell rings. “School Days” has been covered by other artists, including Eddie Cochran and The Beach Boys.\n\n3 of 20\n\n“I Love College”—Asher Roth\n\nChelsea Lauren/WireImage\n\nAsher Roth’s debut single “I Love College” is an anthem for college students that love to party, especially those alums who wouldn't mind reliving their glory days. “I Love College” tells the story of having a good time outside the classroom like binge drinking, dancing at a party, and spending time with close friends.\n\n4 of 20\n\n“Schoolin' Life”—Beyoncé\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)\n\nOn Beyoncé’s track “Schoolin’ Life,” she looks at education in a different light. Granted, people can learn things in a classroom, but she’s also focusing on how to learn from life experiences. In this world, it’s crucial to have both book and street smarts.\n\n5 of 20\n\n“No Such Thing”—John Mayer\n\nTimothy Hiatt/Getty Images\n\nIn 2002, John Mayer released his debut single, “No Such Thing.” It tells the story about how educators and anyone with some type of authority will give typical guidelines on how to succeed in life, or as Mayer puts it to “stay inside the lines.” Mayer stresses how there’s no set guide on being successful as long as people get to do what they love.\n\n6 of 20\n\n“School Daze”—J. Cole\n\nParas Griffin/Getty Images\n\nIn 2007, J. Cole released his debut mixtape The Come Up, which featured standout track “School Daze.” On the track, J. Cole says “But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again,” it’s that feeling of reminiscing on when life was much simpler and carefree. He details school life that entails attending football games, dating, hearing gossip, and being scolded by principals.\n\n7 of 20\n\n“What I Go To School For”—Busted\n\nDave J Hogan/Dave J Hogan/Getty Images\n\nIn 2002, UK band Busted released their debut single “What I Go To School For,” a track that tells the story about a student having a crush on their teacher. They sing about how school can be tedious, except when they are in their teacher’s class. The Jonas Brothers released a cover of the track on their album It’s About Time.\n\n8 of 20\n\n“Report Card”—Souljaboy\n\nPrince Williams/Wireimage\n\nSoulja Boy’s “Report Card” is a parody track of Rich Boy’s hit song “Throw Some D’s.” On the song, Soulja tells the story about not paying attention in class and sometimes falling asleep during a lecture. He’s then shocked to see his report card filled with failing grades, and hopes he can convince the teacher to give him a passing grade instead.\n\n9 of 20\n\n“Rock n Roll High School”—Ramones\n\nPeter Noble/Redferns\n\nIn 1979, rock band Ramones released their single “Rock ‘n’ Roll High School,” which was also on the soundtrack to the comedy film of the same name. The song is all about having no desire to go to school, and instead having fun outside of the classroom.\n\n10 of 20\n\n“School Spirit”—Kanye West\n\nJohn Shearer/Getty Images for MTV.com\n\nIn 2004, Kanye West released his debut album The College Dropout, which had several school references, including the standout track “School Spirit.” On the song, Kanye mentions how he doesn’t really like school but still has ambitions to be successful. He references everything from Black fraternities and sororities, to a valedictorian who isn’t as successful as people would have assumed.\n\n11 of 20\n\n“Be True To Your School”—The Beach Boys\n\nGems/Redferns/Getty Images\n\nThe Beach Boys’ “Be True To Your School” encourages listeners to constantly show school spirit. Whether that means rocking school colors, wearing letterman jackets, attending a football game, or securing a decal sticker on their car—there are many different ways that students can show a little school pride.\n\n12 of 20\n\n“Play It Cool, Stay In School”—Brenda Holloway\n\nJosh Brasted/Getty Images\n\nOn Brenda Holloway’s “Play It Cool, Stay In School,” she encourages students to not drop out of school. She believes graduating with a good education can help students set them up for future success. On the first verse she says, “Play it smart and play it cool / You’ll never play the part of a fool / ‘Cause when you learn more / You’re bound to earn more / When you stay in school.”\n\n13 of 20\n\n“High School Never Ends”—Bowling For Soup\n\nJohnny Louis/Getty Images\n\nOn Bowling For Soup’s 2006 single “High School Never Ends,” the band stresses how the culture and nuances of high school are still relevant throughout adulthood. People are still worried about looks, navigating friendships, and dealing with immature and superficial personalities—even years after graduation.\n\n14 of 20\n\n“Hey Young World”—Fashawn feat. Aloe Blacc\n\nWaytao Shing/Getty Images for SXSW\n\nFashawn and Aloe Blacc joined forces on the single “Hey Young World,” encouraging young people to follow their dreams. Fashawn highlights how hard life can be as students attend school while trying to figure out the best version of themselves. He reminds listeners, “Hey young world / The world is yours.”\n\n15 of 20\n\n“Fifteen”—Taylor Swift\n\nDimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n\nIn 2008, Taylor Swift released her second album Fearless. It garnered five singles including the hit song “Fifteen.” Swift wrote the track to highlight her freshman year in high school with her best friend. The song is all about teenage girls who experienced their first heartbreak in high school, and learning from their younger selves.\n\n16 of 20\n\n“School Days”—Al Green\n\nScott Dudelson/Getty Images\n\nOn Al Green’s “School Days,” the crooner finds himself reminiscing about the relationship with a partner he had during his school years. He remembers the fun times they had and wants that feeling back with his past lover.\n\n17 of 20\n\n“Going Away To College”—Blink-182\n\nBrian Gove/WireImage\n\nTo be young and in love can be a beautiful and challenging thing to deal with. Blink-182’s track “Going Away To College” explores the themes of how high school relationships can suffer at times when partners go their separate ways after graduation.\n\n18 of 20\n\n“I Can”—Nas\n\nNoel Vasquez/Getty Images for Hennessy\n\nChildren are often told they can be anything they want to be when they grow up. Rap legend Nas applies this sentiment on his hit single “I Can.” In the track, he encourages children to go after their dreams, and as long as they work hard, they can achieve anything. The Ludwig Van Beethoven sample of “Für Elise” is perfect on the track as kids sing the hook, “I know I can / Be what I wanna be / If I work hard at it / I’ll be where I wanna be.”\n\n19 of 20\n\n“Graduation (Friends Forever)”—Vitamin C\n\nRon Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images\n\nVitamin C released a famous school track with “Graduation (Friends Forever).” She reflects on how even though friends may take different routes after graduation, their friendship will still stand the test of time.\n\n20 of 20\n\n“College Kids”—Relient K\n\nTim Mosenfelder/Getty Images\n\nOn Relient K’s track “College Kids,” the band focuses on the struggles and confusion that comes with college life. Although parents sometimes push higher education on their kids, it’s not always the best route for every child.\n\nMya Singleton is a freelance music journalist and social strategist based in the Bay Area, with experience covering R&B and hip-hop.
