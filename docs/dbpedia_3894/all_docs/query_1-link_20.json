        "text": "Anaerobic endurance\n\nWhen music is used as an accompaniment to short-duration tasks, it is most often introduced prior to the task in order to elicit optimal levels of activation. However, on occasion, music has been introduced concurrently with brief tasks. Notably, the majority of such studies focus on high-intensity exercise. Both Crust (2004a) and Crust and Clough (2006) tested the effects of motivational music on a muscular endurance task that entailed holding a weight extended directly in front of the body at shoulder height. In both studies, the participants endured longer in the presence of music as opposed to the control condition. The former study is notable because it contrasted the effects of pre- and in-task music. The greatest endurance was recorded when both pre- and in-task music were used successively.\n\nThe latter study (Crust & Clough, 2006) was distinct in that it employed a drumbeat condition that was extracted from the motivational music condition. Participants demonstrated higher endurance when exposed to the motivational music as opposed to the drumbeat condition. It may be that the various constituents of music possess a collective impact that is diminished when it is altered (Sloboda, 2008); in particular, the lyrical content of music can enhance affect as well as provide positive affirmations or task-related verbal cues (e.g., Crust, 2008; Priest & Karageorghis, 2008). Hence, although the percussive and rhythmical elements of music are paramount in the exercise sphere, they appear to lose potency when isolated. Crust and Clough's study is one of the most noteworthy in the literature for the reason that they applied the logical step, in the light of mainstream musicological work, of inferring a mediating role of personality traits in music responsiveness in an exercise context.\n\nExtraverts have been found to prefer stimulative music (e.g., McCown, Keiser, Mulhearn, & Williamson, 1997) which relates to Eysenck's (1967) assertion that extraverts have a tendency to seek greater stimulation from the external environment. Crust and Clough's findings indicated that there were associations between trait liveliness and rhythm response, and between trait sensitivity and musicality response. The premise of personality traits influencing music reactivity was strongly franked by the qualitative work of Priest and Karageorghis (2008) who reported that self-motivation may influence musical choice.\n\nUsing a similar task to that of Crust (2004a) and Crust and Clough (2006), Razon, Basevitch, Land, Thompson, and Tenenbaum (2009) tested the effects of self-selected music on the maintenance of grip pressure. Although the music elicited a 21% improvement in endurance when compared to a no-music control (304 s vs. 252 s), the experimenters expressed doubts over the consistency of the effect. It was also found that music exerted an inconsistent effect on RPE during the course of the squeeze. Unexpectedly, music appeared to lower RPE during the initial stages while having the opposite effect in the latter stages. Limitations associated with the experiment included the possibility that assessing RPE and attentional focus every 30 s in itself represented a distraction which may have distorted participants’ responses. The participant pool consisted of the highly trained (> 75 min exercise per day) and for this reason the results may not be entirely representative of the mainstay of the exercise population. Those habituated to exercising at acute intensities may have been less susceptible to dissociative strategies as associative strategies are almost unavoidable at higher intensities of exercise (Hutchinson & Tenenbaum, 2007).\n\nDoiron, Lehnhard, Butterfield, and Whitesides (1999) tested the effects of loud, upbeat music (70–80 dB; 120 bpm) on the number of repetitions completed in a circuit of resistance exercises. Each station of the circuit consisted of 30 s of repetitions at 65% of one repetition maximum for that exercise (therefore a supramaximal effort). The presence of music had no influence on the number of repetitions performed. Nonetheless, the intense nature of the exercise is likely to have rendered the music less consequential (cf. Rejeski, 1985; Tenenbaum, 2001).\n\nPujol and Langenfeld (1999) reported that fast music (120 bpm) had no effect on performance or fatigue in a maximum-intensity cycling test lasting 30 s. In explaining the findings, the authors documented the acknowledged predominance of physiological as opposed to psychological cues at higher exercise intensities. However, a number of authors have detected a positive difference using similar tasks (Hutchinson et al., 2011; Koç & Curtseit, 2009; Rendi et al., 2008). Rendi et al. chose a maximal-intensity short-duration 500 m rowing ergometer trial accompanied by either slow- or fast-tempo excerpts from Beethoven's 7th Symphony. The quickest times were recorded in the fast-tempo condition. Interestingly, the slow-tempo music also resulted in faster completion times when compared to the control condition. A possible limitation of this study is that none of the participants reported previous use of music during training. Accordingly, the application of music may have elicited a novelty effect that would have subsequently diminished with repeated exposure. Koç et al.'s results were remarkably similar in that both and slow and fast pop music selections elicited superior performance (by virtue of various power indices) during a maximum-intensity cycle ergometer test.\n\nFinally, Hutchinson et al. (2011) administered a motivational music condition (using the BMRI-2) during a Wingate anaerobic cycle ergometer test. They found that the music increased peak and mean power while also positively influencing affect and self-reports of task motivation. Nonetheless, RPE was unaffected, possibly due to the supramaximal nature of the task. Interpretation and comparison of the results is somewhat hindered by the fact that the music was introduced as the participants began to increase their pedal speed (i.e., approximately 20 s prior to the initiation of the test). It is of note that the authors timed the introduction of the music so that a specific segment of the musical piece used (characterised by a ‘building momentum’) would accompany the participants' increase in pedal cadence prior to the test proper. This description mirrors exactly the phenomenon of segmentation described by Priest and Karageorghis (2008) on the basis of interviews with exercise participants. Segmentation refers to the anticipation of a particularly motivational segment of a musical piece often characterised by a crescendo of drumming. The interviewees reported anticipating a heightened expenditure of effort during the segment, and this in itself would give cause for elevated arousal.\n\nHigher-intensity endurance tasks\n\nTenenbaum et al. (2004) and Macone, Baldari, Zelli, and Guidetti (2006) assessed the effects of music on a treadmill test to volitional exhaustion. In the former study, music conditions consisted of rock, dance and inspirational music (music deemed to evoke inspirational associations, such as the Rocky theme). None of these conditions impacted upon endurance or perceptions of exertion. The experiment was repeated using an outdoor 2.2 km run and similar results ensued. The authors concluded that the high intensity of the running tasks overshadowed the effects of the accompanying music. This explanation is consistent with Rejeski's (1985) and Tenenbaum's (2001) theoretical predictions that physiological feedback dominates the capacity of the nervous system at very high exercise intensities. The instrumental piece of music that Macone et al. selected – Wim Merten's airy and virtuosic Struggle for Pleasure – may well have been one with higher motivational qualities for the female participants as they endured for longer in the music conditions whereas their male counterparts did not. Women also experienced greater fatigue in the music conditions, possibly associated with their greater exercise endurance, although no other Profile of Mood States factors were affected by the music intervention.\n\nThe participants in Crust's (2004b) study completed the Balke Walking Test on a treadmill. The task is graded, which means that work rate is increased incrementally until volitional exhaustion is reached. The conditions of familiar music, unfamiliar music and white noise (control) did not influence endurance. Crust's music selection procedure might be questioned on the basis that he only manipulated one of the motivational qualities of music: cultural impact, which is of less importance than rhythm response, for example. Furthermore, his design focused only on one aspect of cultural impact, namely familiarity (cf. Karageorghis et al., 1999). Hence, from a theoretical standpoint, the music manipulation he employed was likely to prove inconsequential in terms of physical performance outcomes.\n\nMusic conditions have consistently improved time to volitional exhaustion in ergometer trials (Atkinson, Wilson, & Eubank, 2004; Bharani, Sahu, & Mathew, 2004; Nakamura, Pereira, Papini, Nakamura, & Kokubun, 2010). In the former study, trance music (a melodic variant of dance) was used during a 10-km cycle time trial. The ergogenic effect was particularly evident during the first 3 km of the trial when perceptions of exertion were relatively low in comparison to the latter stages. This particular finding reinforces the general conclusion that music is more effective as an ergogenic aid at lower exercise intensities. Nakamura et al.'s trial was also conducted on a cycle ergometer at an intensity level known as critical power, which in this study was calculated on the basis of initial trials as an intensity that was expected to cause fatigue in each participant before the 10 min mark. Participants endured for longer when listening to preferred music as opposed to non-preferred music and the no-music control condition. Non-preferred music also led to greater endurance than the control. Further, RPE was higher when listening to non-preferred music as opposed to preferred music or no music. Despite these positive findings, it was notable that the researchers used musical terminology incorrectly (tempo and rhythm were mistaken for each other), employed too few participants (N = 15), and included a condition that lacked external validity (non-preferred music).\n\nIn the Bharani et al. study (2004), participants ran on a treadmill to volitional exhaustion while listening to either self-selected music or no music. Participants reported lower RPE under the music condition when running at submaximal intensities; no comparison appears to have been made close to the point of exhaustion. It should be noted that the self-selection of music represents a threat to the validity of Bharani et al.'s experiment as it may have alerted participants’ attention to the nature of the study and thus influenced their behaviour to some extent via the medium of expectancy.\n\nLim, Atkinson, Karageorghis, and Eubank (2009) conducted a follow-up study in which music was played either in the first or second half of a 10-km cycle ergometer trial and experimental conditions were compared against a no-music control. It was hypothesised that music would exert greater influence on power output when introduced during the second half of the trial. However, results indicated the converse: the highest power output occurred in the early stages of the trial when music was played during the first 5 km. This result suggested that foreknowledge of the removal of music may have affected participants’ pacing strategy. Indeed, the mere anticipation of music may serve a priming or stimulating function even in the absence of the actual music. Interview-based work by Priest and Karageorghis (2008) reported that exercise participants and non-elite athletes experience a stark sense of expectancy regarding forthcoming music and their preferred segments of these pieces.\n\nAs with Lim et al.'s (2009) design, Szabo, Small, and Leigh (1999) inverted music conditions at the halfway point. Specifically, music tempo was switched by using segments from fast and slow movements of Beethoven's 7th Symphony. Moving from a slow to a fast tempo led to a higher work rate than conditions which consisted of purely fast or slow music. This may have been a contrast effect (Kassin, Fein, & Markus, 2008, pp. 138–139) whereby fast music appeared more stimulating by virtue of its contrast with the preceding slower selections. Changes of music tempo may enhance motivation and work output, especially when work levels plateau or during the latter stages of an exercise session (cf. Lucaccini & Kreit, 1972).\n\nSchie, Stewart, Becker, and Rogers’ (2008) study was unusual in that the music condition, which consisted of a variety of pop tracks, did not influence the measures of perceived exertion, heart rate or plasma lactate. The null result may have been influenced by the unusual choice of music which comprised five of the 10 most popular pieces of all time by sales: this included a song about a massacre (Sunday Bloody Sunday by U2) and one about the sorry state of human existence (Imagine by John Lennon). A participant pool that was extremely heterogeneous in terms of age (18–40 years) and the failure to include a performance measure also limit the potential contribution of this study to the literature.\n\nTrained participants\n\nYoung, Sands, and Jung (2009) examined the effects of music on the running performance of trained female soccer players of university age. Participants ran to volitional exhaustion on a treadmill under conditions of self-selected music or no music. The conditions exerted no effect on RPE or endurance. This study contributes to the evidence base that music may have a negligible impact during high-intensity activity. However, the study can be criticised on three grounds: the music was not selected using available technology (such as the BMRI or its derivatives), existing theory was overlooked, and the sample size of 15 rendered the study underpowered.\n\nTwo studies have tested the effects of music on trained and untrained participants during treadmill running (Brownley, McMurray, & Hackney, 1995; Mohammadzadeh, Tartibiyan, & Ahmadi, 2008) and both supported the notion that music is more beneficial for the untrained. The Brownley et al. study was more comprehensive in its scope as a range of exercise intensities (low–moderate–high) and music types (stimulative and sedative) were used. In the low- and high-intensity conditions, untrained participants experienced more positive feeling states in response to stimulative music than did their trained counterparts. The authors concluded that listening to stimulative music may benefit untrained runners yet prove counterproductive for trained runners. Also, the untrained participants demonstrated more positive feeling states upon cessation of exercise than the trained. Hence, the study indicates that less-trained exercisers may depend to a greater extent on the positive feeling states engendered by music. It is possible that the focus of trained exercisers rests on the tasks and specifics of their training, similar to the focus of competitive athletes.\n\nAlong similar lines, Mohammadzadeh et al. (2008) tested the effects of music on endurance and RPE during the Bruce Protocol (a graded treadmill test to the point of volitional exhaustion). Notably, the type of music used in the experimental condition was not specified by the authors, which constitutes a major study limitation (cf. Karageorghis & Terry, 1997). Nevertheless, both trained and untrained participants endured for longer in the music condition relative to the no-music control condition. It is of interest that only the untrained participants experienced lower perceptions of exertion in response to the music, a finding that highlights a possible distinction between the attentional strategies employed by the trained and the untrained. This study employed personal music devices (MP3 players) and the authors made a comment that relates to many studies in this field of research: the introduction of the music may have alerted the participants to the experimental hypothesis and thus altered their behaviour; that is, if the participants became aware that the purpose of the experiment was to assess the effects of music on endurance, they may have endured for longer in the presence of music to produce the ‘expected result’.\n\nSedative music\n\nWhereas the majority of studies apply motivational music or some equivalent, two experiments have employed sedative music during treadmill running. Hepler and Kapke (1996) asked college students to run for 10 min at a moderate intensity whereas Ghaderi, Rahimi, and Azarbayjani (2009) assessed endurance in a high-intensity (85% max HR) run. In the former study, music had no effect on breathing volumes (relative to the control condition) but did lower participants’ heart rates. The authors concluded that music lowered cardiac stress thereby instilling a more relaxed psychological state. Ghaderi et al.'s sample comprised trained men and a motivational music condition was added. Motivational music promoted greater endurance relative to the relaxing music and a no-music control condition. Interestingly, the relaxing music appeared to lower RPE during the trial and cortisol (a biochemical marker of stress) 5 min after the test. The authors concluded that, while motivating music may enhance performance, relaxing music reduces arousal.\n\nMusic also plays a prominent role in low-intensity activities such as yoga and Pilates. North and Hargreaves (1996) reported that music preferences during aerobics and yoga classes differed markedly. During yoga, participants preferred a moderate level of complexity in music whereas in the more vigorous aerobics class they preferred music in a simple form and preference deteriorated with additional complexity. The complexity variable is determined by the amount of information in the music, for example a slow piece with a simple rhythm and a lack of orchestration would be classed as low in complexity.\n\nSelf-paced exercise\n\nStudies in which the participants are given some degree of autonomy in directing their activity are valuable owing to their external validity and thus degree of generalisability. A number of studies tested the effects of stimulative music on self-paced aerobic exercise performance and found that music enhanced work output (e.g., Cohen, Paradis, & LeMura, 2007; Elliott, 2007; Matesic & Cromartie, 2002). In two such studies, although work output was enhanced, music did not influence perceived exertion (Edworthy & Waring, 2006; Elliott, Carr, & Orme, 2005). Matesic and Cromartie measured performance during a 20-min self-paced run on an indoor track with participants exposed to alternate 5-min segments of techno dance music and silence delivered using a portable music player. Faster lap times were recorded during the musical segments. Elliott et al. (2005) also permitted self-selection of exercise intensity and reported similar results, finding that both motivational and oudeterous (neutral in motivational terms; see Karageorghis et al., 1999) music increased the distance pedalled in a cycle trial when compared to the control. It is of interest that neither music condition raised perceptions of exertion relative to the control. Hence, with the aid of the music, the participants were unaware of their greater exertion. While motivational music has been shown to promote superior benefits to those provided by arbitrary selections, the clear implications of this study are that any music may exert an ergogenic and distractive effect during exercise under conditions that mirror those of recreational exercise (i.e., self-paced work). Elliott (2007) conducted a follow-up study with a similar design that incorporated a variety of music tempi (100, 140, 180 bpm). Measures of work rate and distance pedalled were higher under the fast and very fast music conditions, signalling an ergogenic effect. The affect and RPE results were not conclusive, with the music conditions generally improving affect (only significantly so in the slow music condition) and raising RPE (in the case of fast music only).\n\nCohen et al. (2007) used a self-paced cycle ergometer task which participants were allowed to cessate when ready or after 45 min, whichever was soonest. Listening to self-selected music led to an increase in pedal rate of 3 rpm and increased volitional endurance by 1 min although only the former result reached significance. Edworthy and Waring (2006) tested effects of tempo (slow vs. fast) and intensity (quiet vs. loud) on the self-selected speed of treadmill running during 10-min trials. Fast musical accompaniment led to faster running speeds than either slow music or white noise (control condition). No differences were reported in terms of perceived exertion, which may imply a flaw in the measure as the participants worked harder in the two fast music conditions, a result that mirrors that reported by Elliott et al. (2005). The propensity of music to motivate individuals without them being consciously aware of the greater workload is noteworthy. All four of the music conditions improved feeling states relative to the control. However, the fast music conditions exerted a much larger effect. An interaction effect was reported in relation to the performance measure: whereas music volume exerted no ergogenic effect at the slower tempo, loud fast music led to speed increases when compared to loud slow music.\n\nThe work of Becker et al. (1994) is somewhat atypical as, although a 2 min bout of exercise was used, the cycling task was of a low intensity with participants free to cycle at their own pace. Nevertheless, this study is of interest as the self-selected movement tempo mirrors the behaviour of exercisers outside of the laboratory setting. The distance ridden was measured under conditions of stimulative and sedative music. Participants were bracketed by age range into three groups: children (9–11 years), adults (18–55 years), and older adults (60–80 years). Both music conditions (stimulative and sedative) were associated with significant increases in distance cycled compared to a white noise control condition (in children and adults). Of particular interest is the fact that ergogenic effects were found whether the music was presented prior to or during the task, although music used during the task elicited higher mean distances (1.00 miles) than music used before the task (0.91 miles), a result that mirrors that of Crust (2004a). This finding led the authors to conclude that the performance-enhancing properties of music cannot be explained purely by attentional distraction, but are also related to changes in affective and/or motivational states. The absence of an ergogenic effect in the seniors group indicates that the music selections may have been age-inappropriate (the stimulative selection was a 1980s pop track).\n\nA follow-up study by Becker, Chambliss, Marsh, and Montemayor (1995) focused exclusively on the senior participant group and used an indoor walking task along with age-appropriate mellow and frenetic music. The music conditions failed to influence walking distance, which may have been due in part to the short 90 s measure used, which renders the test somewhat arbitrary and lacking in ecological validity.\n\nWaterhouse, Hudson, and Edwards’ (2010) study adds an interesting twist to the lineage of self-paced work. Participants cycled on an ergometer three times for 25 min, listening to a selection of pop music that was either played at the correct tempo, reduced in tempo by 10%, or raised by 10%. As the tempo increased, participants cycled further, pedalled faster and experienced more enjoyment, yet higher perceptions of exertion. Although the participants were not instructed to synchronise their movements with the tempi of the music, their performance does imply some possibility of a synchronisation effect in that their pedal cadence increased and decreased in line with alterations to the musical tempo. However, the experimenters selected a musical programme that included large variations in tempo, rendering the results somewhat problematic to interpret.\n\nAmong the most novel studies in the literature is that completed by Barwood, Weston, Thelwell, and Page (2009), who instructed their participants to complete a 15-min self-paced treadmill run. The intervention used was a combination of motivational music (BMRI-3 rated) and motivational films consisting of British sporting successes. The music and video intervention led participants to run further than the control condition without a corresponding increase in RPE. The work was limited by a small sample size (N = 6) and the use of a climate chamber to increase heat stress. Nonetheless, such threats to internal validity are assuaged somewhat by the external validity of the music and video combination, which suggests a fruitful avenue for future investigation (cf. Loizou & Karageorghis, 2009)."
