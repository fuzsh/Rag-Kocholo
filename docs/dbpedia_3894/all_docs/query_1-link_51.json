        "text": "Editor’s Note: This piece was originally posted in 2018. It has been (and will continue to be) updated to reflect subsequent releases.\n\nRecently, I finally saw the queen, the goddess, my inspiration herself in concert, and I’ve been looking for ways to celebrate the fact that I am now forever changed. Given that I had prepared for the show by listening to her entire catalog on shuffle, I’ve had a lot of her bons mots echoing around my brain, and this seemed like a fitting exercise.\n\nI was going to offer “The Best Lyric from Every Taylor Swift Song,” but I ran into too many multi-way ties. It was easier to narrow down when I made it subjective.\n\nI would like you to know that I did most of these from memory. Enjoy.\n\nTaylor Swift (2006)\n\nTim McGraw\n\nBut in a box beneath my bed\n\nIs a letter that you never read,\n\nFrom three summers back.\n\nPicture to Burn\n\nI really, really hate that\n\nStupid old pickup truck\n\nYou never let me drive.\n\nLet’s be very clear: this is the final repeat, with the repeated “really” for emphasis.\n\nTeardrops on My Guitar\n\nHe’s the time taken up,\n\nBut there’s never enough.\n\nThe unrequited love song of our age.\n\nA Place in This World\n\nI don’t know what I want,\n\nSo don’t ask me.\n\nA nearly unbeatable opening line.\n\nCold as You\n\nYou never did give a damn thing, honey,\n\nBut I cried, cried for you,\n\nAnd I know you wouldn’t have told nobody\n\nIf I died, died for you.\n\nThis bridge renders the entire genre of emo redundant.\n\nThe Outside\n\nBut nothing seems to work the first few times,\n\nAm I right?\n\nTied Together with a Smile\n\nI guess it’s true that love was all you wanted,\n\n’Cause you’re giving it away like it’s extra change,\n\nHoping it will end up in his pocket,\n\nBut he leaves you out like a penny in the rain.\n\nStay Beautiful\n\nHe smiles, it’s like the radio.\n\nWhat a wild image. “I will speak daggers to her” (Hamlet, Act 3 Scene 2).\n\nShould’ve Said No\n\nYou should’ve known that word\n\n‘Bout what you did with her’d\n\nGet back to me.\n\nLove this internal rhyme.\n\nMary’s Song (Oh My My My)\n\nTake me back to the creek beds we turned up,\n\nTwo A.M. riding in your truck.\n\nOur Song\n\nHe’s got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel,\n\nThe other on my heart.\n\nIt’s the pause before “heart” that makes this.\n\nBONUS TRACKS\n\nI’m Only Me When I’m with You\n\nYou drive me crazy half the time;\n\nThe other half I’m only tryin’\n\nTo let you know that what I feel is true.\n\nInvisible\n\nShe’s never gonna love you like I want to.\n\nHere is where she taught us one of her most important lessons: always get the bonus tracks.\n\nA Perfectly Good Heart\n\nHow do I get it back the way it was before?\n\nFearless (2008)\n\nFearless\n\nIn this passenger seat,\n\nYou put your eyes on me;\n\nIn this moment now,\n\nCapture it, remember it.\n\nFifteen\n\nIn your life, you’ll do things greater than\n\nDating the boy on the football team…\n\nI didn’t know it at fifteen.\n\nLove Story\n\nRomeo, save me;\n\nThey’re trying to tell me how to feel.\n\nShe was giving us tongue-in-cheek denouncements of the haters long, long before “Shake It Off.”\n\nHey Stephen\n\nYou’re perfect for me;\n\nWhy aren’t you here tonight?\n\nWhite Horse\n\nI’m not the one you’ll sweep off her feet,\n\nLead her up the stairwell.\n\nI love Swiftian stair imagery, and this instance not least because I originally misheard it as “leader of the stairwell.”\n\nYou Belong with Me\n\nHave you ever thought, just maybe,\n\nYou belong with me?\n\nBreathe\n\nYou’re the only thing I know\n\nLike the back of my hand.\n\nTell Me Why\n\nI take a step back,\n\nLet you go.\n\nI told you I’m not bulletproof;\n\nNow you know.\n\nI love a good last line. “And I thought it was the end of the world… and it was” (“Four Black Dragons,” Pacific Overtures, 1976).\n\nYou’re Not Sorry\n\nYou don’t have to call anymore.\n\nThe Way I Loved You\n\nYou were wild and crazy,\n\nJust so frust-r-ating,\n\nIntoxicating, complicated,\n\nGot away by some mistake and…\n\nYou really have to hear how she draws out “frustrating.”\n\nForever and Always\n\nYou looked me in the eye and told me\n\nYou loved me.\n\nWere you just kidding?\n\nThe Best Day\n\nI’m thirteen now,\n\nAnd I don’t know how\n\nMy friends could be so mean.\n\nChange\n\nThey might be bigger,\n\nBut we’re faster and never scared.\n\nBONUS TRACKS\n\nJump Then Fall\n\nWell, I like the way your hair falls in your face.\n\nYou got the keys to me; I love each freckle on your face.\n\nSeeing this written out, it looks like a legitimately bad lyric, but in a song that makes a game of drawing big love confessions out of the mundane, it doesn’t get better than this passing “you got the keys to me.”\n\nCome In with the Rain\n\nTalk to the wind,\n\nTalk to the sky,\n\nTalk to the man with the reasons why,\n\nAnd let me know what you find.\n\nThis is, low-key, an incredible dis.\n\nSuperstar\n\nAnd I knew from the first note played\n\nI’d be breaking all my rules to see you.\n\nThe Other Side of the Door\n\nYou carried me from your car up the stairs, and I\n\nBroke down crying — “Was she worth this mess?”\n\nAfter everything and that little black dress,\n\nAfter everything, I must confess I need you.\n\nNote: “Untouchable” is a cover so I did not include it. (I only recently learned this after over a decade of Swiftiedom!)\n\nSpeak Now (2010)\n\nMine\n\nYou made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter.\n\nOn no other entry did I consider so heavily the angry mail I would receive if I chose poorly.\n\nSparks Fly\n\nGet me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down;\n\nGive me something that’ll haunt me when you’re not around.\n\nBack to December\n\nThe last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind;\n\nYou gave me roses, and I left them there to die.\n\nSpeak Now\n\nBut I-I-I-I\n\nKno-o-o-ow\n\nYou wish it was me,\n\nYou wish it was me — don’t you?\n\nGolly, her delivery.\n\nDear John\n\nThe girl in the dress wrote you a song…\n\nYou should’ve known.\n\nOnly “All Too Well” rivaled this song for sheer number of possible favorite lyric options. In the end, though, the choice was obvious.\n\nMean\n\nI can see you years from now in a bar,\n\nTalking over a football game.\n\nThe Story of Us\n\nBut you held your pride\n\nLike you should’ve held me.\n\nNever Grow Up\n\nTake pictures in your mind of your childhood room.\n\nEnchanted\n\nThe lingering question kept me up —\n\nTwo A.M., who do you love?\n\nBetter Than Revenge\n\nNo amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity.\n\nInnocent\n\nWasn’t it easier in your lunchbox days?\n\nThe later change to “firefly-catching days” is an all-time great variation.\n\nHaunted\n\nStood there and watched you walk away\n\nFrom everything we had,\n\nBut I still mean every word I said to you.\n\nLast Kiss\n\nSo I’ll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep,\n\nAnd I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe.\n\nLong Live\n\nAnd the cynics were outraged,\n\nScreaming, “This is absurd!”\n\n’Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped-up jeans\n\nGot to rule the world.\n\nBONUS TRACKS\n\nOurs\n\nYour hands are tough,\n\nBut they are where mine belong.\n\nIf This Was a Movie\n\nBut if this was a movie, you’d be here by now.\n\nSometimes I didn’t need to overthink these.\n\nSuperman\n\nI hope you don’t save some other girl.\n\nThis line is — I think unintentionally so but nonetheless — utterly maniacal.\n\nRed (2012)\n\nState of Grace\n\nLove is a ruthless game,\n\nUnless you play it good and right.\n\nRed\n\nFighting with him was like\n\nTrying to solve a crossword and realizing there’s no right answer.\n\nOf course she does crossword puzzles. Typical lyricist.\n\nTreacherous\n\nTwo headlights shine through the sleepless night,\n\nAnd I will get you a-, get you alone.\n\nYour name has echoed through my mind,\n\nAnd I just think you should, think you should know\n\nThat nothing safe is worth the drive.\n\nI Knew You Were Trouble\n\nAnd the saddest fear\n\nComes creeping in,\n\nThat you never loved me\n\nOr her, or anyone, or anything.\n\nAll Too Well\n\n’Cause there we are again in the middle of the night;\n\nWe’re dancing ’round the kitchen in the refrigerator light.\n\nI know. Sometimes I like to go for the non-obvious choice.\n\nTwenty-Two\n\nYou don’t know about me,\n\nBut I’ll bet you want to.\n\nI Almost Do\n\nI bet you think I either moved on or hate you,\n\n’Cause each time you reach out there’s no reply.\n\nI bet it never ever occurred to you\n\nThat I can’t say hello to you and risk another goodbye.\n\nLike for the pre-echo of “never ever”; love for Taylor explaining something I never understood about my own past relationships.\n\nWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\n\nI remember when we broke up — the first time.\n\nNow that’s how you set the scene in a single line. (If we were to count the dialogue break, my answer would be “This is exhausting.”)\n\nStay Stay Stay\n\nBefore you, I’d only dated self-indulgent takers.\n\nThe Last Time\n\nThis is the last time I’m asking you this:\n\nPut my name at the top of your list.\n\nHoly Ground\n\nI was reminiscing just the other day\n\nWhile having coffee all alone, and lord, it took me away.\n\nThis happens to me all the time. I mean that with total sincerity.\n\nSad Beautiful Tragic\n\nAnd you’ve got your demons,\n\nAnd darling, they all look like me.\n\nThe Lucky One\n\nYou had it figured out since you were in school:\n\nEverybody loves pretty; everybody loves cool.\n\nEverything Has Changed\n\nAnd all I feel\n\nIn my stomach is butterflies,\n\nThe beautiful kind, making up for lost time.\n\nStarlight\n\nDon’t you dream impossible things?\n\nBegin Again\n\nAnd I think it’s strange that you think I’m funny,\n\n’Cause he never did.\n\nBONUS TRACKS\n\nThe Moment I Knew\n\nYou called me later\n\nAnd said, “I’m sorry I didn’t make it,”\n\nAnd I said, “I’m sorry, too.”\n\nThis is like when a parent says “I’m disappointed in you” and it’s so much worse than being yelled at.\n\nCome Back… Be Here\n\nThis is falling in love in the cruelest way.\n\nGirl at Home\n\nAnd it would be a fine proposition,\n\nIf I was a stupid girl.\n\nAnd yeah I might go with it,\n\nIf I hadn’t once been just like her.\n\n1989 (2014)\n\nWelcome to New York\n\nKaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats…\n\nBlank Space\n\nGot a long list of ex-lovers;\n\nThey’ll tell you I’m insane.\n\nY’ns “lonely Starbucks” pretenders can all go shove it. Preferably a Q-Tip, into those clogged-up ears.\n\nStyle\n\nTake me home.\n\nJust take me home.\n\nOut of the Woods\n\nBut the monsters turned out to be just trees;\n\nWhen the sun came up, you were looking at me.\n\nAll You Had to Do Was Stay\n\nPeople like you always want back the love they pushed aside,\n\nBut people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye.\n\nShake It Off\n\nMy ex-man brought his new girlfriend,\n\nShe’s like, “Oh my god,” but I’m just gonna shake.\n\nI’ll defend this rap break to my death. Put it on my tombstone.\n\nI Wish You Would\n\nYou’re thinking that I hate you now,\n\n’Cause you still don’t know what I never said.\n\nBad Blood\n\nSo if you’re coming my way…\n\nJust don’t.\n\nWildest Dreams\n\nI said, “No one has to know what we do.”\n\nHis hands are in my hair;\n\nHis clothes are in my room.\n\nSteamy!\n\nHow You Get the Girl\n\nThat’s how it works;\n\nThat’s how you got the girl.\n\nI love this old-school songwriting “turn” on the hook.\n\nThis Love\n\nWhen you’re young, you just run,\n\nBut you come back to what you need.\n\nI Know Places\n\nSomething happens when everybody finds out.\n\nClean\n\nYou’re still all over me,\n\nLike a wine-stained dress I can’t wear anymore.\n\nBONUS TRACKS\n\nWonderland\n\nYou searched the world for something else\n\nTo make you feel like what we had,\n\nAnd in the end, in Wonderland,\n\nWe both went mad.\n\nYou Are in Love\n\nAnd you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars,\n\nAnd why I’ve spent my whole life trying to put it into words.\n\nI realize bridges might be overrepresented in this list. Maybe that’s because she’s so damn good at writing bridges.\n\nNew Romantics\n\nThe rumors\n\nAre terrible and cruel,\n\nBut honey, most of them are true.\n\nReputation (2017)\n\n…Ready for It?\n\nHe can be my jailer,\n\nBurton to this Taylor;\n\nEvery love I’ve known in comparison is a failure.\n\nEnd Game\n\nI bury hatchets,\n\nBut I keep maps of where I put ’em.\n\nI Did Something Bad\n\nIf a man talks shit,\n\nThen I owe him nothing.\n\nDon’t Blame Me\n\nI once was poison ivy,\n\nBut now I’m your daisy.\n\nDelicate\n\nMy reputation’s never been worse, so\n\nYou must like me for me.\n\nShe says “reputation” like forty times in “End Game,” but make no mistake — this is the title drop.\n\nLook What You Made Me Do\n\nHoney, I rose up from the dead; I do it all the time.\n\nSo It Goes…\n\nCome here, dressed in black now.\n\nScratches, down your back now.\n\nGorgeous\n\nYou should think about the consequence\n\nOf you touching my hand in a darkened room.\n\nGetaway Car\n\nIt was the great escape, the prison break,\n\nThe light of freedom on my face.\n\nBut if you asked my favorite part to sing along to, it’s obviously “GO GO GO!”\n\nKing of My Heart\n\nUp on the roof with a schoolgirl crush,\n\nDrinking beer out of plastic cups,\n\nSay you fancy me, not fancy stuff;\n\nBaby all at once, this is enough.\n\nShe’s so good at zeugma.\n\nDancing with Our Hands Tied\n\nI’m a mess, but I’m the mess that you wanted.\n\nDress\n\nI don’t want you like a best friend.\n\nThe line that launched a thousand ’shippers.\n\nThis Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things\n\nAnd therein lies the issue:\n\nFriends don’t try to trick you,\n\nGet you on the phone and mind-twist you.\n\nCall It What You Want\n\n’Cause he really knows me,\n\nWhich is more than they can say.\n\nNew Year’s Day\n\nYou squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi;\n\nI can tell that it’s gonna be a long road.\n\nLover (2019)\n\nI Forgot That You Existed\n\nWould’ve been right there, front row,\n\nEven if nobody came to your show.\n\nThere is no blade more vicious than “I would have been kind to you.”\n\nCruel Summer\n\nSnuck in through the garden gate\n\nEvery night that summer just to seal my fate,\n\nAnd I screamed “For whatever it’s worth,\n\nI love you; ain’t that the worst thing you ever heard?”\n\nI promise the Lover picks won’t all be bridges!\n\nLover\n\nSwear to be overdramatic — and true!\n\n…just a lot of them.\n\nThe Man\n\nAnd they would toast to me, oh,\n\nLet the players play.\n\nI’d be just like Leo\n\nIn Saint-Tropez.\n\nThe Archer\n\nAnd I cut off\n\nMy nose just to spite my face,\n\nThen I hate my reflection\n\nFor years and years.\n\nI Think He Knows\n\nI got that ah, I mean…\n\nWanna see what’s under that attitude.\n\nMiss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince\n\nThe whole school is rolling fake dice;\n\nYou play stupid games, you win stupid prizes.\n\nPaper Rings\n\nI hate accidents,\n\nExcept when we went from friends to this.\n\nCornelia Street\n\nBarefoot in the kitchen,\n\nSacred new beginnings\n\nThat became my religion…\n\nDeath by a Thousand Cuts\n\nMy time, my wine, my spirit, my trust —\n\nTryna find a part of me you didn’t take up.\n\nGave you so much, but it wasn’t enough.\n\nBut I’ll be all right; it’s just a thousand cuts.\n\nThis was, by far, the hardest one to narrow down. You heard it here first: “Dx1kC” is her best lyric since “All Too Well.”\n\nLondon Boy\n\nStick with me; I’m your queen,\n\nLike a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath.\n\nSoon You’ll Get Better\n\nDesperate people find faith,\n\nSo now I pray to Jesus, too.\n\nFalse God\n\nThe altar is my hips.\n\nS T E A M Y !\n\nYou Need to Calm Down\n\nSunshine on the street at the parade,\n\nBut you would rather be in the Dark Ages.\n\nSomething about the intentionally wonky scansion of “parade” played against the intentionally wonky scansion of “Dark Ages” catches my ear in the most delightful way every time.\n\nAfterglow\n\nI lived like an island,\n\nPunished you with silence,\n\nWent off like sirens,\n\nJust crying.\n\nMe!\n\nI’m the only one of me;\n\nBaby, that’s the fun of me!\n\nIt’s Nice to Have a Friend\n\nSomething gave\n\nYou the nerve\n\nTo touch my hand.\n\nIt’s nice to have a friend.\n\nDaylight\n\nI once believed love would be burning red,\n\nBut it’s golden.\n\nBONUS TRACKS\n\nAll of the Girls You Loved Before\n\nCrying in the bathroom\n\nFor some dude\n\nWhose name I cannot remember now.\n\nIt’s just very funny when Taylor says “dude.”\n\nFolklore (2020)\n\nThe One\n\nWe never painted by the numbers, baby,\n\nBut we were making it count.\n\nYou know the greatest loves of all time\n\nAre over now.\n\nThis quatrain structure with the shortened last line gets me every time.\n\nCardigan\n\nI knew I’d curse you for the longest time,\n\nChasing shadows in the grocery line.\n\nThe Last Great American Dynasty\n\nThe doctor had told him to settle down;\n\nIt must’ve been her fault his heart gave out.\n\nExile\n\nI can see you staring, honey,\n\nLike he’s just your understudy.\n\nMy Tears Ricochet\n\nI didn’t have it in myself to go with grace,\n\n’Cause when I’d fight, you used to tell me I was brave.\n\nMirrorball\n\nI’m a mirrorball;\n\nI can change everything about me to fit in.\n\nThis was the first time I cried on the first album listen. (I know, I got really far!)\n\nSeven\n\nYour braids like a pattern;\n\nLove you to the Moon and to Saturn.\n\nTo land a surprising rhyme by twisting a familiar phrase like this is next-level lyric writing.\n\nAugust\n\nRemember when I pulled up and said, “Get in the car”?\n\nAnd then canceled my plans just in case you’d call?\n\nBack when I was living for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all…\n\n“Meet me behind the mall.”\n\nThis Is Me Trying\n\nThey told me all of my cages were mental,\n\nSo I got wasted like all my potential.\n\nIllicit Affairs\n\nTake the words for what they are:\n\nA dwindling, mercurial high,\n\nA drug that only worked\n\nThe first few hundred times.\n\nInvisible String\n\nChains around my demons,\n\nWool to brave the seasons.\n\nMad Woman\n\nDo you see my face in the neighbor’s lawn?\n\nDoes she smile?\n\nOr does she mouth, “Fuck you forever”?\n\nReader, I gasped.\n\nEpiphany\n\nHolds your hand through plastic now;\n\n“Doc, I think she’s crashing out.”\n\nI truly did not think anyone could make art about the pandemic that wouldn’t come off as hackneyed and cringeworthy. But such is her power.\n\nBetty\n\nBetty, I won’t make assumptions\n\nAbout why you switched your homeroom,\n\nBut I think it’s ’cause of me.\n\nHonorable mention to the triumphant return of the cardigan at the album’s climax.\n\nPeace\n\nAll these people think love’s for show,\n\nBut I would die for you in secret.\n\nHoax\n\nMy only one,\n\nMy kingdom come undone,\n\nMy broken drum,\n\nYou have beaten my heart.\n\nBONUS TRACKS\n\nThe Lakes\n\nI’ve come too far\n\nTo watch some namedropping sleaze\n\nTell me what are my words worth.\n\nEvermore (2020)\n\nWillow\n\nHead on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in.\n\nI love the ambiguity (sneaking into the room? into her head?), and the rhyme with the title-drop phrase.\n\nChampagne Problems\n\nBut you’ll find the real thing instead;\n\nShe’ll patch up your tapestry that I shred.\n\nGold Rush\n\nI see me padding ’cross your wooden floors\n\nWith my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door.\n\n’Tis the Damn Season\n\nI parked my car\n\nRight between the Methodist\n\nAnd the school that used to be ours.\n\nBoy does she capture that “estranged high school friend group meetup” vibe.\n\nTolerate It\n\nGain the weight of you, then lose it;\n\nBelieve me, I could do it.\n\nNo Body, No Crime\n\nGood thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen.\n\nYeah, yeah, we all love the Olive Garden line.\n\nHappiness\n\nWhen I’m above the trees,\n\nI see it for what it is,\n\nBut now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow\n\nWhere you used to lay your head.\n\nPillow and ship imagery on the upswing this album cycle!\n\nDorothea\n\nAnd damn, Dorothea,\n\nWe all wanna be ya,\n\nBut are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers?\n\nConey Island\n\nThe fast times, the bright lights, the merry-go.\n\nThe shortening of “merry-go-round” thrills me, not least because the merry has gone and isn’t coming back ’round.\n\nIvy\n\nAnd the old widow goes to the stone every day,\n\nBut I don’t; I just sit here and wait,\n\nGrieving for the living.\n\nCowboy Like Me\n\nAnd the old men that I’ve swindled\n\nReally did believe I was the one.\n\nLong Story Short\n\nYour nemeses\n\nWill defeat themselves\n\nBefore you get the chance to swing.\n\nHonorable mention to “And my waves meet your shore, ever and evermore.” SHE SAID IT!\n\nMarjorie\n\nLong limbs and frozen swims,\n\nYou’d always go past where our feet could touch.\n\nClosure\n\nIt cut deep to know you,\n\nRight to the bone.\n\nEvermore\n\nWriting letters\n\nAddressed to the fire.\n\nBONUS TRACKS\n\nRight Where You Left Me\n\nAnd you’re\n\nSitting in front of me\n\nAt the restaurant,\n\nWhen I was still the one you want.\n\nIt’s Time to Go\n\nNow he sits on his throne\n\nIn his palace of bones,\n\nPraying to his greed.\n\nNever have I so instantly identified a favorite line on first listen.\n\nRed (Taylor’s Version) (2021)\n\nFROM THE VAULT\n\n​Better Man\n\nAnd I gave to you my best,\n\nAnd we both know you can’t say that.\n\nThis isn’t even the meanest song in this set of vault tracks!\n\nNothing New\n\nThey tell you while you’re young,\n\n“Girls, go out and have your fun,”\n\nThen they hunt and slay the ones\n\nWho actually do it.\n\nBabe\n\nWhat a waste,\n\nTaking down the pictures and the plans we made.\n\nMessage in a Bottle\n\nYou could be the one that I keep,\n\nAnd I-I-I\n\nCould be the reason you can’t sleep\n\nAt ni-i-ight.\n\nI Bet You Think About Me\n\nI don’t have to be your shrink to know that\n\nYou’ll never be happy.\n\nTaylor Swift reminds us of the valuable lesson that you don’t have to be nice to people who wrong you, and perhaps you shouldn’t.\n\nForever Winter\n\nHe spends most of his flights\n\nGetting pulled down by gravity.\n\nRun\n\n​No one to be, no one to tell.​\n\n​The Very First Night\n\n’Cause they don’t know about the night in the hotel;\n\nThey weren’t riding in the car when we both fell.​\n\nAll Too Well (10 Minute Version)\n\nThe idea ​you had of me, who was she?\n\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel\n\nWhose shine reflects on you.\n\nA song in its fullness is a sacred prayer.\n\nMidnights (2022)\n\nLavender Haze\n\nThe only kind of girl they see\n\nIs a one-night or a wife.\n\nMaroon\n\nThe mark they saw on my collarbone,\n\nThe rust that grew between telephones…\n\nAnti-Hero\n\nI’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror.\n\nShe remains the queen of these dual constructions.\n\nSnow on the Beach\n\nThis scene\n\nFeels like what I once saw on a screen;\n\nI searched “aurora borealis green.”\n\nYou’re on Your Own, Kid\n\nI touch my phone as if it’s your face.\n\nA devastating image in a song that builds its power by accumulating them.\n\nMidnight Rain\n\nHe wanted a bride;
