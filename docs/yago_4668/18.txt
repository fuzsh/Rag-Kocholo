Tisha Sterling, daughter of Ann Sothern and Robert Sterling was all over the small screen in the 60s and 70s. It seems she guested on just about every television series that aired. The Donna Reed Show, Batman, Charlie’s Angels, Bonanza, Run For Your Life, McMillan & Wife and Get Smart are just a few of the many. Though not as plentiful, her film credits were building and she got good notices for her “hippie” Linny Raven in Coogan’s Bluff. It seemed a forgone conclusion that she would have a long and fruitful career, just like her mother, but it wasn’t meant to be. She said she’d been living a hard, fast life and left it to follow her mother to Idaho in 1986. She did play a younger version of Sothern’s character in The Whales of August (Ann’s last film) and Tisha’s last film appearance came in Breakfast of Champions (1999).

Now a florist, Sterling lives in a small condominium south of Ketchum , Idaho. Tisha purchased her home in 2002 for $105,000 which was the legally restricted price. Seems most real estate in that area was/is quite high; too high for average working stiffs like Tisha. The local government stepped in and subsidized some housing so working stiffs could have a shot at a home. Of course, it’s hard to think of the daughter of two Hollywood stars as an “Average Joe,” but as she said, “My mother made millions and lost millions, and when she died, there was nothing left.” Tisha’s dad, actor Robert Sterling, was known most notably for his role on the television series Topper playing along side his second wife, Anne Jeffreys.
