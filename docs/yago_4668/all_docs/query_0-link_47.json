        "text": "Biography\n\nPatricia Ann “Tisha” Sterling is a retired American actress. She is the only daughter of actor Robert Sterling and actress Ann Sothern.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, California, Sterling started acting in the 1960s with an appearance on her mother’s television series The Ann Sothern Show. She later appeared in episodes of The Donna Reed Show; The Long, Hot Summer; Bonanza; Batman episodes 43 and 44 as Legs, the daughter of Ma Parker (played by Shelley Winters); The Name of the Game; The Bold Ones: The Lawyers; Hawaii Five-O; Columbo and The New Adventures of Perry Mason. She appeared in the feature films Village of the Giants (1965), Coogan’s Bluff (1968), and Norwood (1970).\n\nIn 1987, Sterling played a younger version of her mother’s character (in flashbacks) in The Whales of August. Following that role, she appeared in two other films. Sterling made her last onscreen appearance to date in Breakfast of Champions (1999), opposite Bruce Willis. She has since retired from acting, and currently works as a florist in Ketchum, Idaho (where her mother lived for many years until her death in 2001) with her daughter, Heidi Bates Hogan. Sterling was married to Lal Baum (1937–1987), the great-grandson of author L. Frank Baum, from 1965 until 1970."
