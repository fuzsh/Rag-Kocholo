After the fight, which Terry wins by a knockout, Maisie and Skeets \"bury the hatchet\" and go dancing. At home, when Maisie congratulates Terry, he confesses that he hates boxing and would like to quit after his next fight, then buy back the grocery store his mother lost. When he says that he cannot quit because of his contract with Skeets, she assures him that Skeets will understand. Two months later, Terry tries to tell Skeets how he feels, but Skeets misunderstands and thinks Terry is trying to thank him. On the night of Terry's next fight, Maisie tells Mrs. Dolan that Terry will soon be quitting \"sales\" and coming home to buy a grocery store. Terry easily wins the fight, and after talking with Maisie, finally is able to tell Skeets that he wants to quit boxing. Skeets feels betrayed and threatens to ruin him if Terry does not honor their contract. Even Maisie cannot change Skeets's mind, and he and Terry remain at odds during training for the next match. During his fight, Terry doesn't seem to have his old spark and takes a terrible beating. Skeets, who at first thinks that Terry is deliberately holding back, won't stop the fight, despite Maisie's pleadings. Terry is knocked out cold in the sixth round and in his dressing room, they discover that he is blind. Maisie then lashes out at Skeets, who feels terrible. Cissy is also chastised by Maisie when she admits that she needs someone to take care of her and cannot bear the thought of having to care for a blindman. Later, Mrs. Dolan, who learns of Terry's sacrifices from Maisie, visits him in the hospital and is told that his blindness might be cured by an operation to relieve pressure on the brain. Mrs. Dolan then tells Terry to use his money for the operation and forget about the grocery store. After the operation, which is a success, Maisie learns from one of the doctors that Skeets chartered a plane to bring a specialist down from Boston and that he is planning to set Terry up in the grocery business. Maisie then rushes to Skeets's hotel and they embrace.\n\nLess"
