        "text": "Second marriage and motherhood\n\nWhile experiencing a great deal of success at MGM during the 1940s, Ann’s personal life was not as smooth. On-going separations from husband Roger Pryor had taken a toll on the marriage, and it was obvious the couple was headed for a divorce. By 1942 their six-year union was officially dissolved, with Ann claiming her husband had been mentally cruel to her. Pryor’s film career rebounded slightly, and he was now working at Warner Brothers, mostly in B films. By the middle of he decade, however, he left show business and became an advertising executive.\n\nAs she began to concentrate on movies again, Ann met and fell in love with her newest costar. He was socialite William J. Hart, who had recently signed with MGM and been given the audience-friendly name Robert Sterling. He did supporting roles in other studio pictures, before being cast as the romantic lead in RINGSIDE MAISIE. Although Ann was a few years older, the two hit it off.\n\nIn early 1943, Ann and Robert Sterling were wed. Ann’s mother, Annette Lake, who had been a professional singer for many years, performed the song ‘Oh Promise Me.’ It was said to have brought wedding guests to tears. Richard Thorpe, who was directing Ann in her latest picture, gave the bride a day off as a wedding present.\n\nA better present came her way a year and a half later. In late 1944, Ann gave birth to her only child, daughter Patricia Sterling. Nicknamed Tisha, she would grow up to look and sound just like her mother. She would follow her parent’s professional footsteps to become an actress.\n\nAnn focused on motherhood in the mid-1940s and slowed her movie output somewhat. She continued to remain under contract to MGM, where she stayed gainfully employed until the early 1950s. At one point she had a lengthy illness, but she went back to work in the studio’s glittery production of WORDS AND MUSIC. Producer Joe Pasternak then cast her in the musical NANCY GOES TO RIO, where she took the role Kay Francis had played in an earlier version at Universal, called IT’S A DATE. The remake benefitted from Ann’s singing and from her splendid chemistry with Jane Powell, who played the young daughter."
