        "text": "ANN SOTHERN, who has died at Ketchum, Idaho, aged 92, was a popular Hollywood comedienne of the war years, chiefly identified with a series of 10 films that took their name from the leading character - a scatterbrained blonde named Maisie.\n\nSothern was a long-term survivor in Hollywood, making her first film, Broadway Nights, in 1927 and her last, The Whales of August, 60 years later. For that film she received her only Oscar nomination, as best supporting actress, though she lost to Olympia Dukakis in the final ballot.\n\nWith rare exceptions, she was better known than the films in which she appeared. This was because most of them were second features. Although in her prime she doubtless had a modest fan club, few people actually went to see an Ann Sothern movie. They queued for the latest Clark Gable or Errol Flynn, but were pleased to catch her in the bottom half of the bill. She was good fun and made many movies - often three a year - so filmgoers grew accustomed to her face.\n\nHer range was limited. She seldom attempted drama and was only partially successful when she did. But as a shrewd, wise-cracking \"older woman\" she had few equals. She was born to play the heroine's \"best friend\". Until her last film, when she was one of a trio of veterans including Bette Davis and Lillian Gish brought together by Lindsay Anderson, she seldom had much help from her directors. For the most part, they were studio craftsmen working out their contracts.\n\nThe exception was Joseph L Mankiewicz, who wrote and directed A Letter to Three Wives (1949), the most sophisticated film of Ann Sothern's career and one of the few top features in which she had a starring role.\n\nShe was not asked to carry the film alone - her co-stars included Jeanne Crain, Linda Darnell and Kirk Douglas. But her part was as important as any, being one of three wives trapped for the day on a school picnic who receive a letter from an old rival announcing that she has run off with one of their husbands. But which one?\n\nFlashbacks sketch in the truth about their apparently blissful marriages. Ann Sothern played a scriptwriter churning out soaps for her philistine local radio station to the despair of her academic husband, Kirk Douglas. These were the wittiest episodes in a waspish film.\n\nAnn Sothern was born Harriette Lake on January 22 1909 at Valley City, North Dakota. Her mother, a Dane, was a concert singer, and largely responsible for steering her into show business. Educated at state schools in Minneapolis and Waterloo, Iowa, Miss Lake showed early promise in music, which she studied at the University of Washington in Seattle. Later, she joined her mother in Hollywood, where she was teaching singing and diction.\n\nMrs Lake was instrumental in obtaining her daughter's first parts in movies. She was unbilled in Broadway Nights (1927), but later played a bit part in Hearts in Exile (1929) and appeared briefly with her sister in a song-and-dance number in The Show of Shows (1929). In 1930, she was also in the chorus line of Smiles, a Broadway musical mounted by Florenz Ziegfeld with Marilyn Miller.\n\nUnder contract to Columbia, she changed her name to Ann Sothern and her hair from red to platinum for Let's Fall in Love (1934). Throughout the early Thirties, she signed a number of contracts, most of which proved unrewarding. Films in which she appeared at this time included Hooray for Love, a pastiche of 42nd Street, and The Girl Friend (both 1935).\n\nThe Girl Friend was not a film version of the Rodgers and Hart show, but a musical in its own right that introduced Ann Sothern to Roger Pryor, who became her first husband in 1936.\n\nHer breakthrough came in 1939, when she was cast in the title role of Maisie, as a New York showgirl who falls in love with a Wyoming rancher and clears him of a murder charge; the part had originally been meant for Jean Harlow, but she died before the film could be made.\n\nIntended only as a programme-filler, it found favour with audiences, who wanted to know more about this wacky girl with the full lips who had a knack for solving mysteries. To everyone's surprise, it proved the pilot for a series of films about Maisie that continued until 1947 with Undercover Maisie, the last in the series.\n\nThrough the war years, she appeared in supporting roles but only intermittently given her divorce, remarriage and the birth of her daughter. She had a guest spot in Words and Music (1948), the bowdlerised MGM musical supposed to depict the lives of composers Rodgers and Hart. For MGM, Ann Sothern also played Jane Powell's mother in Nancy Goes to Rio (1950).\n\nOnly A Letter to Three Wives (1949) offered her a worthwhile role. Her subsequent screen career was disappointing. She left movies for television after a supporting role as Anne Baxter's wise-cracking room-mate in The Blue Gardenia (1953). For television she starred in Private Secretary (1954-57) and The Ann Sothern Show, in association with Lucille Ball.\n\nFrom time to time, she returned to the screen, now many pounds heavier. In The Best Man (1964), she was a political committee woman, and in Lady in a Cage (1964) Olivia de Havilland's blowsy neighbour.\n\nSubsequent movies were mostly low-budget shockers for television. In 1985, she was induced to film a television remake of A Letter to Three Wives in the role originally played by Linda Darnell. She was so ashamed that she wrote to Mankiewicz apologising for taking part in it.\n\nShe stayed out of pictures until Lindsay Anderson persuaded her to make a comeback in The Whales of August (1987). While never a star, she at least ended her career with a memorable film.\n\nAnn Sothern married first, in 1936 (dissolved 1942) Roger Pryor. She married secondly, in 1953, William J Hart (thereafter known as the actor Robert Sterling). This marriage, too, ended in divorce. They had a daughter."
