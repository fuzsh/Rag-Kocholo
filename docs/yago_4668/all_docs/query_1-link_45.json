        "text": "Quote:\n\nOriginally Posted by soupson1\n\nAmazing! I was coming back to post~yes~more redheads, including Ann Sheridan! Now, we'll see if I can recall the others I thought of.\n\nPat Crowley - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJulie Harris - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nShe was a phenomenal actress. It's unfortunate that she didn't do more films.\n\nAlice Krige - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nPiper Laurie ~ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_Laurie\n\nIt's sad that most people think of her only as \"Carrie's mother\".\n\nAnita Morris - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nPoor Anita was too sexy for TV! The Rolling Stones' video \"She Was Hot\" was banned from MTV~hard to believe considering what they showed later. From Wikipedia: Her signature number in \"Nine\" was \"A Call from the Vatican\" ... She was scheduled to perform the (song) at the Tony Awards in 1982, but the television censors found her outfit too revealing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiFnfSTmd_w\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-GMMeOcSRg\n\nPatricia Pearcy - IMDb\n\nPippa Scott ~ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pippa_Scott\n\nI'm watching her right now on the \"Parasite Mansion\" episode of \"Boris Karloff's Thriller\". Scene-stealer Jeanette Nolan gives another of her wonderful old-woman roles, something she excelled in. I need to post her and her actor husband yet; I don't think they've been mentioned.\n\nI know that I am forgetting others, but perhaps they'll come to mind later.\n\nGENERATIONS 1:\n\nHume Cronyn ~ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume_Cronyn ~ father of Tandy Cronyn, his daughter with the lovely Jessica Tandy\n\nJessica Tandy ~ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Tandy\n\nTandy Cronyn - IMDb\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRLa-_4LOVs\n\nAlan Hale, Sr. ~ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Hale,_Sr. ~ father of Alan Hale (Jr.) aka Skipper of \"Gilligan's Island\" // His wife was Silent film actress Gretchen Hartman.\n\nAlan Hale, Jr. ~ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Hale,_Jr.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqP3BMEI3GM\n\nWalter Huston ~ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Huston ~ father of John Huston and grandfather of Angelica Huston. (I don't think they need links, do they? Some might not be aware that John Huston acted, as well as directed.)\n\nI posted this song on another forum and thought it was perfect for this thread.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3mAT-4FdP4\n\nLast edited by MystMoonstruck; 03-11-2014 at 04:20 PM.."
