        "text": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sterling\n\nRobert Sterling (November 13, 1917 â€“ May 30, 2006) was an American film and television actor.\n\nEarly life\n\nHe was born William Sterling Hart in New Castle, Pennsylvania, 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Pittsburgh. He attended the University of Pittsburgh and worked as a clothing salesman before pursuing an acting career.\n\nFilm\n\nAfter signing with Columbia Pictures in 1939, he changed his name to Robert Sterling to avoid confusion with silent western star William S. Hart. His name was legally changed while he was a second lieutenant officer attending flight training in Marfa in West Texas in 1943. In 1941, Sterling went to MGM. He worked steadily as a supporting player for several years. After serving in World War II as an Army Air Force flight instructor, he returned to Hollywood, but by the end of the decade, his film career had faltered. He did, however, play the non-singing role of Steve Baker, opposite Ava Gardner as Julie, in the hit MGM 1951 film version of Show Boat.\n\nIn 1939, he also performed with Shemp Howard, of \"The Three Stooges\" fame, in the movie \"Glove Slingers\", and in 1961, appeared with Moe, Larry & Curly Joe themselves in \"Fox Movietone News\". In 1974 he also appeared in \"The 3 Stooges Follies\".\n\nTelevision\n\nSterling reinvigorated his career, first with a club act with wife actress/singer Anne Jeffreys, and then becoming a fixture on television. He was cast in numerous dramatic roles on early television, when networks often televised live dramatic performances.\n\nSterling is perhaps most well known, however, for starring with Jeffreys, as the spirited George Kerby, to Jefferys' Marion Kerby in the television program Topper, based on the original 1937 film of the same name, it aired on the CBS network from 1953 to 1955. Leo G. Carroll starred in the title role. Wife Marion Kerby was referred to as \"the ghostess with the mostest\", while Sterling's character was known as \"that most sporty spirit\".\n\nOn December 18, 1957, Sterling and Jeffreys played a couple with an unusual courtship arrangement in \"The Julie Gage Story\" on the first season of NBC's Wagon Train.\n\nIn the 1961-1962 television season, Sterling co-starred with George Chandler and Reta Shaw in CBS's Ichabod and Me, a sitcom set in New England. He portrayed 44-year-old Bob Major, a newspaper reporter from New York City, who purchased and ran the paper in a small town called Phippsboro. Chandler played the former editor and municipal traffic commissioner. Shaw appeared as Sterling's aunt and housekeeper.\n\nAfter some additional television and film work in the early 1960s, including Return to Peyton Place and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea in 1961 and A Global Affair in 1964, Sterling essentially retired, making only sporadic appearances with Jeffreys in later shows such as CBS's Murder, She Wrote and ABC's Love, American Style and Hotel. He had also guest starred in the NBC sitcom The Brian Keith Show in 1974. Sterling's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is at 1709 Vine Street.\n\nPersonal life\n\nSterling was married twice. His first marriage, in 1943, was to noted actress-singer Ann Sothern. They had a daughter, Patricia (Tisha Sterling), who became an actress. Sothern and Sterling divorced in 1949. Sterling met actress-singer Anne Jeffreys soon after in his Broadway debut, and they wed in 1951 and remained married until his death. They had three sons: Jeffrey, Dana, and Tyler.\n\nDeath\n\nSterling died Tuesday, May 30, 2006, aged 88, at his home in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California. According to the Associated Press, his son, Jeffrey, indicated that Sterling died of natural causes, but had suffered from debilitating shingles for the last decade of his life."
