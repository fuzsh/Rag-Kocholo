        "text": "LOS ANGELES, May 31 (AP) â€” Robert Sterling, the handsome star of 1940's movies who appeared with his wife Anne Jeffreys in the television series \"Topper,\" died on Tuesday at his home here. He was 88.\n\nHe died of natural causes after a decade-long battle with shingles, said his son Jeffrey Sterling.\n\nAlthough he appeared in dozens of movies, Robert Sterling was best known for the 1953-1956 television series \"Topper,\" based on a novel by Thorne Smith and on the 1937 film starring Cary Grant and Constance Bennett.\n\nMr. Sterling and Ms. Jeffreys played George and Marion Kerby, a fun-loving couple killed in an accident who return as ghosts to haunt the new occupant of their home, a sober banker named Cosmo Topper, played by Leo G. Carroll.\n\nMr. Sterling was born William Hart in November 13, 1917, in New Castle, Pa. He attended college in Pennsylvania and worked as a clothing salesman before breaking into movies.\n\nHe proved a versatile player, especially in romantic roles, and appeared in five films in 1941, including the romantic comedy \"Two-Faced Woman\" with Greta Garbo and \"The Penalty\" with Lionel Barrymore.\n\nAfter \"Topper,\" Mr. Sterling became a businessman and worked in the early stages of computers.\n\nHe was married to the actress Ann Sothern from 1943 to 1949, and they had a daughter, the actress Tisha Sterling, who survives him, along with Ms. Jeffreys, his wife since 1951; their three sons, Jeffrey, Dana and Tyler; and six grandchildren."
