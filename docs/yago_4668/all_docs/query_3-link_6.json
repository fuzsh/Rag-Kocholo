        "text": "Ann gets religion\n\nWhile ex-husband Robert Sterling had married Anne Jeffries, Ann started to seek out the company of her good friend Richard Egan. Egan’s star was rising at Warner’s, and at 20th Century Fox where he would have some of his best roles in the 1950s and 1960s. But more importantly for Ann, Egan’s brother was a priest. And through this relationship, Ann had a spiritual awakening of sorts. She would convert to Catholicism with the help of the Egan brothers, and she would remain a devout Catholic for the rest of her life. She even sent her daughter Tisha to a private Catholic school.\n\nThere was talk that she and Richard Egan would eventually marry. And sure enough, he soon popped the question. But Ann turned down his proposal, because she felt that since she had already been married and divorced twice, it would compromise him. Instead she chose to remain lifelong friends with Egan. They appeared on screen in 1968’s CHUBASCO at Warner Brothers.\n\nFor the rest of the 1950s, Ann focused on television. Private Secretary ended in 1957, not because it was cancelled, but because Ann experienced creative differences with Jack Chertok. She turned to her friend Lucille Ball for help. At this point, Lucy and Desi had just bought RKO, and they were converting many of the old soundstages into television production facilities.\n\nIt was decided that Ann would take a year off, then return to television in a new self-titled sitcom that would be jointly produced by Desilu and Anso, Ann’s company (which stood for the first two letters in her first and last names). During the year off, though, Ann appeared in a movie-length 75-minute episode of The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour for which she was paid $25,000. She would also appear in a segment of a variety special produced by Desilu."
