        "text": "It would be easy to describe Paula Cole as ‘just another 90s singer-songwriter’. Every biography mentions her association with the Lilith Fair festivals, that zeitgeist of 90s new wave feminism that faded as quickly as it came (attempts to re-create the Lilith Fair hype only a few years ago fell embarrassingly limp). And of course, we can’t forget that this is the woman whose voice opened up every episode of the 90s cultural phenomenon (might be a bit strong a word, but it was certainly popular) that was Dawson’s Creek. While her ambitious creativity was rarely met with commercial success (Where Have All the Cowboys Gone and I Don’t Want to Wait remain her sole Top 10 singles in the States), Cole is an artist in the truest sense. Over the course of her 20 years in the music industry Cole has followed her muse before all else. Where her contemporaries have often chosen to play it safe (Sarah McLachlan, Sheryl Crow) rather than tip the applecart, Cole has proven herself a true successor to the likes of Joni Mitchell, Carly Simon, and Kate Bush in her willingness to eschew convention for creative growth. 2014 marks the 20 year anniversary of Cole’s debut album ‘Harbinger’, and with this milestone comes a much deserved look at the body of work that Cole has crafted.\n\nBethlehem\n\nGrowing up in the small town of Rockport, Massachusetts, Paula Cole was the youngest daughter of a elementary school teacher and a scientist. Cole’s family were musical, her father playing in a polka band and family sing alongs encouraged. After surviving the angst of adolescence and high school, Cole followed her musical dreams to the Berklee College of Music studying jazz singing and improvisation. However, studying the works of great composers like Gershwin was paralleled by Cole’s own burgeoning songwriting. Cole found herself at a crossroads: a record contract with a jazz label or pursue her own craft and musical vision. Cole took the plunge, and in 1993 signed with Imago records to begin recording her debut album. While Cole wanted to produce her own album from the get-go, the record label felt it better for her to work alongside someone more ‘experienced’ and the reigns were handed to Kevin Killen. Killen had had a hand in many a great record (and continues to), and was a good fit for the restless and introspective Cole. ‘Harbinger’ was truly a departure from Cole’s jazz studies although remnants of her training would emerge briefly in song structures. Like it’s stark album cover depicting a huddled Cole in a too-big trench coat (this is the better known cover anyway – there were two), ‘Harbinger’ is an album of shadow, introspection, and emotional catharsis. Often touching on her small-town experiences growing up, Cole’s lyrics are a poignant reflection of interpersonal dynamics (Bethlehem, Happy Home) and the darker sides of humanity (Hitler’s Brothers).\n\nAlready, Cole was demonstrating her fearlessness in telling things as they were and foreshadowed her plunge into themes of social justice and inequality on her later records. That said, Cole is at times naïve in her assessments of human kind, and a song like Black Boots, while obviously meaningful to the Cole of that time, does come off as rather self-indulgent. The album itself is a lush and nuanced work and Killen’s production is dynamic throughout. Dreamy synths are backed by a rock band on the single-worthy Saturn Girl, which demonstrated Cole’s capacity for accessible material, while strings are employed to dramatic effect on the likes of Chiaroscuro and Our Revenge. Cole’s vocals are the real showstopper though and transcend anything she sings to new heights. On ‘Harbinger’, Cole is vocally restrained compared to later projects, but this is understandable for a new artist probably feeling some pressure to remain accessible and finding her legs. Yet this does not mar the sheer beauty of her voice, which is at once delicate and dizzying (She Can’t Feel Anything Anymore) and ominous (Our Revenge). While the album had all the makings of being an alternative radio hit, it’s lead single I Am So Ordinary, a heartbreaking paean to being the other woman, failed to spark interest and soon after the album’s release Imago records collapsed and its artists were picked up by Warner Brothers. ‘Harbinger’ was re-released in 1995 to coincide with this move, however promotion was limited and the album ultimately fell through the cracks. Cole, however, was beginning to be recognised as a burgeoning young singer-songwriter and appearances with the likes of Melissa Etheridge on VH1 did help to boost her profile. The best was yet to come though.\n\nWhere do I put this fire…\n\nFollowing the demise of Imago records and her move to Warner Brothers, Cole was commissioned to make another album. This time though, Cole was given free reign and a minimal budget – it seemed Warner Brothers were simply going through the motions and did not expect Cole to justify her place on their roster. Cole took the opportunity gladly and after the catharsis that ‘Harbinger’ represented, found herself carrying a new energy. She poured this newfound confidence into making her second album, ‘This Fire’ and the record signified a shift away from the Kate Bush-lite tones of ‘Harbinger’ and into a new, exciting, and wholly individual musical vision. Cole not only helmed production, vocal, and songwriting duties but was also responsible for most of the album’s instrumentation, playing everything from piano to didjeridu! Listening to the album, it is clear how much Cole revelled in having complete creative control. After all, the precocious young artist had wanted full control over her product even as a novice. Also apparent is Cole’s preference for a starker approach compared to the slightly heavy-handed production on ‘Harbinger’. Where ‘Harbinger’ was painted in dark shadows and blinding light with little middle ground, ‘This Fire’ brought colour to Cole’s musical vocabulary and expanded on her vision while also paying tribute to her past.\n\nFrom the opening seconds of Tiger, Cole’s voice conveys a ferocity and passion otherwise subdued in the introspection of ‘Harbinger’. Fittingly though, this opening track references Cole’s newfound freedom (I’ve left Bethlehem / and I feel free / I’ve left the girl I was supposed to be) and sets her on the road to living in the moment. ‘This Fire’ is a rollercoaster of a record and a snapshot of a woman finding her identity. Where ‘Harbinger’ was keen-eyed in its judgment on others, this emancipated Cole is fierce and rips her opponents\n\nto shreds (Throwing Stones, Road to Dead). There are still accessible moments here, such as the hit single Where Have All the Cowboys Gone, all country twang and jaded nostalgia. Or there’s Me, the album’s third single and most overtly introspective moment, unfortunately not having the same success as its predecessors yet containing Cole’s most blatant hooks and melodies. The darker moments are where the album truly shines though, and Cole’s stark storytelling comes into its own when backed by fittingly stripped-back instrumentation. The intensity of Nietzsche’s Eyes – dealing with the realisation of an admired figure’s true colours – is almost unsettling, as Cole unravels into a throat-shredding vocal outro. Similarly, the eerie and foreboding Mississippi is a fitting tribute to the river, and Cole crafts a dark fairytale around its banks. Juxtaposing these darker moments though are the album’s more sentimental, such as the heart-wrenching tale of a man dying from AIDS in Hush, Hush, Hush (featuring an appearance by the inimitable Peter Gabriel) or the tale of love through the ages in I Don’t Want to Wait. While the album is certainly a mixed bag of styles and tones, it is Cole’s most accomplished release to date and even today is a thrilling, invigorating and touching listen – a seminal album of the 90s even if it’s not recognised as such by a wider audience.\n\nThe album remains Cole’s most commercially successful – despite stalling at #20 on the Billboard Charts, it was a steady seller and eventually certified 2x Platinum. The album and Cole were also nominated for seven Grammy Awards, with Cole winning for ‘Best New Artist’ (ironic, since this was her second album). As a female producer though, the honour lay in being nominated for ‘Best Producer’, the first solo female producer to be so at that point. Not having grown up in the United States, and with their being only minimal video archiving of Cole’s career, it’s hard for me to establish exactly how successful she was at this point. Nevertheless, it is obvious that Cole became synonymous with the wave of female singer-songwriters that emerged in the 90s and became a figurehead due to her involvement with the Lilith Fair festival. Cole experienced a wave of success, yet it suddenly vanished with her next project.\n\nStanding at the edge of the precipice\n\nComing off the success of ‘This Fire’, Cole was once again given free reign to create her next record – this time however, Warner Brothers were much more invested in the project being a commercial success. Cole had different plans though. Ever the restless artist, Cole was not content to traipse out another ‘This Fire’, and given that album’s lightning-in-a-bottle magic, it was unlikely that Cole would be able to (or want to, for that matter) tap into that same reservoir. Not succumbing to pressure, Cole began work on her most ambitious and misunderstood record that would eventually become known as ‘Amen’. Cole’s inherent restlessness and insecurity is all over the project – from redundant name changes (to the Paula Cole Band), to longer song times – yet do not ultimately compromise the album’s quality. A concept record of sorts, the album is Cole at her most socially aware and contains many a commentary of the oppression of women, the social inequalities of racial minorities, the use of religion as an subjugating force, and the quest for spirituality. While Cole had previously nodded towards such themes on her previous records, ‘Amen’ was much more overt in its messages and wore its heart on its sleeve, so to speak. To the casual observer, Cole’s albums seemed to be getting shorter, with each having successively fewer tracks, however ‘Amen’ was an album of longer tracks which allowed Cole the flexibility to experiment and craft more complex sonic stories.\n\nIn contrast to the piano- and acoustic guitar-based alternative rock of ‘This Fire’, the new album showcased Cole’s love of urban sounds, incorporating R&B and Hip Hop elements into its soundscapes. On Rhythm of Life, Cole even raps the verses, a brave move but one that showed her commitment to spreading her creative wings. The album’s opener, I Believe In Love, is a lush R&B-meets-disco stomper showcasing Cole’s nimble vocals and aptitude for narrative lyrics. The song screams ‘hit single’, but unfortunately suffered from a lack of promotion. I Believe In Love is one of the album’s few uptempo moments, with many midtempos and ballads creating a more subdued\n\ntone. Where ‘This Fire’ was, well, fiery ‘Amen’ was Cole channeling Mother Earth in the album’s quietly demanding moments. Pearl and La Tonya (the former a reflection on commitment in relationships and the latter an account of a Latina girl experiencing prostitution and drug abuse) are slow in their buildup, but are testament to Cole’s ability to create epic and nuanced songs with a distinct message. Anyone who felt Cole had lost her ‘edge’ though need only listen to Suwannee Jo, a track composed in the ‘Harbinger’ days, but given a dark, rumbling energy complete with vocal callisthenics to amaze even the diehard fan. Cole may have been embodying the Gaia image, but she could be as biting in her commentary as she had been in emasculating men on ‘This Fire’. The album’s title track, earmarked to be a single but eventually cancelled, is a sarcastic yet searching view of religion and faith, and has Paula praising everyone from Kavorkian to Gandhi to ‘the drivers in their garbage trucks’.\n\nPaula had let her ambitions run wild with ‘Amen’ and crafted a deliciously warm, yet thought provoking album. Of course by 1999, the music industry had again shifted and female singer-songwriters with something to say were again passé. Cole’s record company, wanting a hit single, found nothing to their liking and refused to promote the album. Critics seized on what they saw as naïve social commentary and lambasted Cole for her attempt to sing about experiences she had never had. So much for storytelling in song. If Dylan had released this album it would have been critically acclaimed. Alas, this was not the case for Cole and the album sold poorly.\n\nFinding courage\n\nWarner Brothers refused to promote ‘Amen’, and the album soon vanished from the lower ends of the charts. Cole went on to record a fourth album collaborating with producer Hugh Padgham, but the record label refused to release it and the album was never released (many a Paula Cole fan would kill to hear it. The only track to have leaked is Singing Out My Life). In 2003, Cole and Warner Brothers went their separate ways, and three years later a ‘greatest hits’ (in inverted commas since Cole only had two hits) was released, containing tracks from her first three albums, the jazzy soundtrack contribution Autumn Leaves, and two divine ‘Amen’ outtakes, Postcards From East Oceanside and Tomorrow I Will Be Yours. In her personal life, Cole got married and had a child, but this too soon turned sour and the combination of having to care for a sick child and a long, messy divorce from a controlling ex-husband broke Cole and stripped her of the will to commit to music. It wasn’t until 2007 when Cole, approached by Bobby Columby of Decca records, ventured back into the studio with the goal of making a new album. For the first time in 12 years, Cole did not produce her own album and left the majority of the instrumentation to session musicians. Even the songwriting was a shared process this time around. In talking about the album, Cole described the need to ease herself back into the process and the insecurity she faced after having been through so much in her own life. The word she would keep coming back to was ‘Courage’ – nearly every song on the album has the word ‘Courage’ in its lyrics, and it acts a mantra to tie the album together.\n\n‘Courage’ is somewhat of an anomaly in Cole’s catalogue. After the ferocity of ‘This Fire’ and the experimental ‘Amen’, you can feel Cole’s reticence in the makeup of ‘Courage’. Cole’s jazz roots finally come to the fore (Lovelight, Lonely Town, Hard to be Soft) and make for much lighter and romantic fare than Cole was known for at this point. There are some tracks that feel more familiar, such as 14 with its tense build-up and crescendoing vocals; or the chilled, downtempo groove of It’s My Life which wouldn’t feel out of place on ‘Amen’. Yet overall, this record serves purely to make Cole comfortable as a recording artist again. Cole sounds largely defeated and resigned on much of the record, which does add a certain charm and intrigue, but ultimately waters down the material and makes the album her least memorable. The return of Paula Cole was however met with good favour (even if the sales were still poor) and there was some appreciation shown for her 90s work. ‘Courage’ brought Paula Cole back to life, and her next release would see her re-discover her fire.\n\nIthaca\n\nStill signed to Decca records and feeling more confident in her ability after ‘Courage’ was well received by fans and critics alike, Cole went on to work on her fifth studio album. Coming to terms with her past and making peace with the many parts of her life she had fought against in the past, Cole named the album ‘Ithaca’ after the Greek myth of Odysseus. Returning to her hometown of Rockport, Massachusetts Cole likened her life’s journey to that of Odysseus finally returning to his home of Ithaca. Cole had this to say about the album:\n\nI … got really beat up in the world. So I’ve come to a quiet place of acceptance in my family and my hometown. That’s why I called the album ‘Ithaca’ … That’s the tone of the album, that there is both darkness and light to this story. My journey has healed me, and in that healing process I’ve been able to work again.\n\nThe album was a return in more ways than one and while Paula continued to collaborate (even bringing back Kevin Killen to co-produce) it felt a more organic progression from ‘Amen’ than the jazzy ‘Courage’ had been. It seemed that Cole had rediscovered her fire and her newfound ferocity was on show, seemingly channelled towards her ex (The Hard Way, Music In Me). While less experimental than ‘Amen’ or ‘This Fire’ had been, Cole still slipped into a style that was undoubtedly her own by now, and was more angsty and edgy than the softer curves of ‘Courage’. ‘Ithaca’ showcased a more subtle approach to her typically insightful and acerbic lyrics – Waiting on a Miracle, throws barbs at her ex but also has a hopeful message. The funky P.R.E.N.U.P. is a sassy kiss off as well as a warning to avoid to other newlyweds. That said, the album is not all bitterness – true to its theme, Paula had moved on and this is evident in the sexy slowjam aptly named Sex, the romantic 2 Lifetimes, and the cathartic Elegy. Embarking on her first tour in 15 years, Cole was well and truly back and enjoying her craft again. ‘Ithaca’ was well received by critics, who harked it as her return to form, and they were right to say so.\n\nFlying like a raven\n\nAfter nearly 20 years of jumping through the hoops of various record labels and seeing diminishing returns, Cole decided to strike out on her own. After the critical success of ‘Ithaca’, Cole parted ways with Decca and recorded her next album without the budget or expectations of a major label. Turning to her fans to finance the mixing, mastering, and manufacturing of the album, Cole created a successful Kickstarter campaign to create her sixth album, ‘Raven’. The Kickstarter campaign proved that Cole’s fans were still with her and willing to support her through any shift in direction and format of release. Luckily, the fans didn’t have anything to worry about when it came to the quality of the music on offer. ‘Raven’ is a natural culmination of Cole’s influences while also stretching into new musical territory. Sparser and more intimate than any previous album, ‘Raven’ moves the focus to Cole’s lyrical and compositional skills and is her first sole production effort since ‘Amen’.\n\nCole dabbles in country and folk to a greater extent and the sound on the whole is much rootsier than any of her previous efforts. Yet the stylistic shift once again fits her voice like a glove, and tales of love and loss like Eloise are given a pathos and subtlety other artists might not achieve. The album has an unnerving quietness about it. There are no tracks as bombastic as Throwing Stones, as dramatic as Our Revenge, or as overtly smutty as Feelin’ Love. It is this quietude that a mature Cole brings to her music, and while there are certainly moments of release (the soaring chorus of Imaginary Man; the transcendent crescendo of Manitoba; the climactic exhalation in Secretary) the record as a whole feels a more peaceful reflection on life, love, and self-belief. Strong Beautiful Woman feels like Cole’s manifesto to her younger self – its certainly a message the Cole of ‘Harbinger’ seemed to be searching for in all of her angst and frustration. On ‘Raven’, Cole has well and truly found inner peace and as such her music has also found an inner calm that only serves to refine it. The tag of ‘adult contemporary’ is often thrown at female singer-songwriters over 35, yet boxing ‘Raven’ into the genre would be a disservice to the pure, unadulterated creativity on show here. Cole may not be warring with herself or the world as much, yet her lyrics remain as insightful as ever and her voice still commands the attention it did 20 years ago.\n\n‘Raven’ was critically acclaimed and well received by fans. Cole seems to be relishing the freedom of being an independent recording artist and has already made moves to record her next album. Record company or not though, Cole has always proven herself an independent spirit and unwilling to compromise her vision no matter how misunderstood or underappreciated. Here’s hoping the next 20 years are as fruitful and dynamic.\n\n[Paula Cole’s music is available for purchase on iTunes and Amazon.

Follow Paula Cole on her website and Facebook.]\n\nGosh, where does the time go? 2013 has seemingly flown by and as such my ambitious project of charting my Top 30 albums came to a screeching halt nearly half way through. 2013 has also been a year of great albums, and as such it’s likely that my list would look very different now anyway. Therefore, I’m retiring those posts and instead turning to the obligatory end-of-year stuff we bloggers like to do. I Thought I’d do something a bit different than my usual and give some attention to my favourite songs of 2013. Yes, there’s been a plethora of great albums but occasionally (and usually unexpectedly) some one-off songs have also caught my attention and stuck. This year I found myself drawn to big pop songs, much more so than usual, and while there was a lot of dross on the radio, when the big pop stars delivered they really delivered (Beyoncé). So, here goes…\n\n45. James Blake – Retrograde\n\nBass-heavy, R&B-influenced alternative tunes from white boys was a bit de rigeur in 2013, wasn’t it? (at least on my iPod). Luckily some bloody good songs (like this one) came out of that trend.\n\n44. Chlöe Howl – No Strings\n\nChlöe Howl should be the new poster girl for ‘pop-with-fuck-off-attitude’, but unfortunately she’s been a bit overlooked this year in favour of Lily Allen’s brand of ‘social commentary’ and P!nk’s formulaic ‘tough girl’ crap.\n\n43. Active Child – Subtle (feat. Mikky Ekko)\n\nSee 45, except you can sort of dance to this! Nice to hear Active Child move away from his harp a bit. Also, who is Mikky Ekko and why was he on so many songs this year?\n\n42. Goldfrapp – Drew\n\nNo one does ‘lush pop’ quite like Goldfrapp, who always manage to strike a nice balance of ‘ethereal’ and ‘accessible’ without ever sounding pretentious. Not sure if song and music video should every be separated to be honest, they’re both glorious.\n\n41. Ariana Grande – The Way (feat. Mac Miller)\n\nOh, Ariana you gorgeous (and adorable) creature. Girl is bringing back 90s Mariah Carey-esque R&B/Hip Hop (whistle notes and all) only with a much more likeable persona. This song is the definition of ‘earworm’.\n\n40. Beyoncé – Mine (feat. Drake)\n\nBeyoncé’s absolute slayage of 2013 will go down in the history books for sure, but what made the whole ‘event’ even better was that the music was so fucking good. This is one of the tracks that made me jump on the Beyoncé bandwagon after years of ‘casual’ listening.\n\n39. Jessie Ware – Imagine It Was Us\n\nJessie Ware has the Midas touch for understated dance tracks and continued the trend with this bonus track from her ‘Gold Edition’ of Devotion. With a distinct 90s vibe, this track goes down well as a late night jam.\n\n38. Blood Orange – You’re Not Good Enough\n\nBlood Orange is the new Prince. His songs are really fucking good. He also produces some amazing tracks for other people (see number 1).\n\n37. Cassie – Paradise (feat. Wiz Khalifa)\n\nCassie doesn’t seem to be releasing an album proper anytime soon, but with the quality of some of her recent stuff being so top notch (see also: King of Hearts) who really cares?\n\n36. Iron & Wine – Lovers’ Revolution\n\nIron & Wine’s move to a jazzier sound was more than successful and his 2013 album Ghost on Ghost is an absolute delight to listen to. The key changes alone make this song worth listening to – it just evolves.\n\n35. Justin Timberlake – Mirrors\n\nJustin Timberlake delivered one of the best albums of 2013 with The 20/20 Experience (Part 1, anyway), filled to the brim with longer-than-usual pop gems like this. This is how you do a love song.\n\n34. Daft Punk – Get Lucky (feat. Pharrell)\n\nNo doubt one of 2013’s biggest radio hits, this song is just too infectious to not like and eventually I had to come around to it.\n\n33. Ellie Goulding – You My Everything\n\nEllie was a busy bee the last two years, and she actually managed to better what was already a cohesive and creative album with her deluxe repackaging of Halcyon Days in 2013. This drum-n-bass influenced track was a standout of the new bunch, ’nuff said.\n\n32. Lorde – A World Alone\n\nThis song makes me thankful that Lorde is releasing music (along with the rest of her album). Album closers don’t get much better than this.\n\n31. Foals – Inhaler\n\nBasically, Foals decided to just rock the fuck out and the results were glorious. Best band discovery of 2013 for me.\n\n30. Drake – Started From the Bottom\n\nYes, he was on fucking Degrassi. We get it. Now just listen to the song with it’s glorious beat (and watch Drake dance next to a car) and be done with it.\n\n29. Jewel – Two Hearts Breaking\n\nNo one really gave a shit about Jewel returning in 2013 for her greatest hits (not unexpected given the general apathy towards the 90s singer songwriters these days), but that’s ok because she still delivered the perfect blend of her pop, folk, and country sounds in this gem (no pun intended).\n\n28. Miley Cyrus – Wrecking Ball\n\nI don’t like Miley, nor do I really care about the crap she’s done this year (although her twerking will always be a bit of a punch line for me), yet she managed to deliver some amazing pop songs in 2013. So she’s on this list. (Oh, and the video is here in case, you know, you hadn’t seen it…).\n\n27. OneRepublic – Counting Stars\n\nIt’s just a great song. That pre-chorus! That middle eight! Nothing really else to say. (PS: Mr. Tedder, you look very awkward trying to ‘rock out’, so maybe don’t do that again.)\n\n26. Sia – Elastic Heart (feat. The Weeknd & Diplo)\n\nSia tided us over until her new album with her soundtrack contribution for the Catching Fire film. As usual, anything she touches turns to gold, and what could easily just have been noise instead became a great electro-pop track.\n\n25. Skylar Grey – Wear Me Out\n\nNo, she doesn’t just sing hooks for Eminem and Dr. Dre. I don’t think Skylar’s album was particularly noticed but it had a lot of great tracks on it, and Wear Me Out was a particular highlight for me.\n\n24. The Civil Wars – Same Old Same Old\n\nI’m still devastated that John Paul and Joy aren’t on speaking terms, but at least they managed to release their second album this year, which was another collection of amazing country-folk-americana ditties. This song gets me. Every. Single. Time.\n\n23. M.I.A. – Bring the Noize\n\nM.I.A. proved she was still the fiercest female in contemporary music with her long-awaited Matangi this year. As usual she gives zero fucks about melody, yet manages to create intense and mesmerising tracks.\n\n22. Sophie Ellis-Bextor – Young Blood\n\nSophie made a welcome change from disco diva to introspective singer-songwriter, and she pulled it off beautifully as evidenced by Young Blood.\n\n21. Caveman – In The City\n\nHad no idea Julia Stiles was in the video for this until now. Anyway, amazing dream-pop song from New York indie band. Chance discovery when I tuned into alternative radio station one day. So, thank you Triple J!\n\n20. Naughty Boy – La La La (feat. Sam Smith)\n\nI just want to say that I usually watch this video just to see the adorable Chow puppy. That, and this song is fucking immense and hopefully signals a greater move to more drum-n-bass music returning to the charts.\n\n19. Paula Cole – Manitoba\n\nE.P.I.C. No one does dramatic, tumultuous piano-rock like Paula Cole, and she proved she doesn’t need a record label to deliver the goods this year.\n\n18. HAIM – Falling\n\nOh god I love HAIM. They’re basically Fleetwood Mac for the new millennium (yes, I know Fleetwood Mac are still around) and we really haven’t had a band like that be big for ages.\n\n17. The National – Don’t Swallow The Cap\n\nWill The National ever make a bad album? I hope not, because I’m really rather enjoying being continually slayed by their effortless cool and boundless talent. I have only two emotions/fearful fear and dead devotion is probably my favourite lyric of 2o13, by the way.\n\n16. Sky Ferreira – You’re Not the One\n\nWHY WOULD ANY RECORD COMPANY NOT LET THIS GIRL RELEASE AN ALBUM. LOOK WHAT SHE RELEASED WHEN YOU FINALLY LET HER!!!! GAAAAAHHHHH (#recordcompanypolitics)\n\n15. Phoenix – Entertainment\n\nI do slightly prefer the Blood Orange remix (for obvious reasons if you’re aware of my favourite musical acts) but really the original is such a great example of how to actually do 80s-influenced pop (see also number 16) and therefore deserves it’s place in my top 20.\n\n14. Everything Everything – Cough Cough\n\nYeah. So. Um. Wait a secon – MIND BLOWN BY AMAZING SONG.\n\n13. Lana Del Rey – Young and Beautiful\n\nYes, Lana, I will still love you when you’re no longer young and beautiful. So long as you don’t mention a ‘red dress’ or ‘pale moonlight’ in anymore of your songs.\n\n12. Snakadaktal – Hung on Tight\n\nI mean the song’s fucking amazing and everyone needs to experience the eargasm that it is, but I think they deserve kudos for the band name. Genius.\n\n11. James Vincent McMorrow – Cavalier\n\n*Hears it for the first time* *Dies and goes to heaven* (seriously, I think this is what I would want Heaven to sound like).\n\n10. Lissie – Further Away (Romance Police)\n\nThis song is so good, yet got so little attention, and therefore is automatically in my top 10. Apart from the fact that I can’t not picture Stevie Nicks singing this, it also convinced me that my life would be incomplete without Lissie. So thanks, Lissie. Here’s hoping you absolutely smash with album number 3.\n\n9. Beyoncé – Drunk In Love (feat. Jay-Z)\n\nOnly Beyoncé can get away with making surfboart a legitimate song lyric. Also, this song just makes me want to dance like a fucking lunatic.\n\n8. The Civil Wars – The One That Got Away\n\nYou guys really aren’t making the ‘did they? didn’t they?’ rumours any easier to dispel. Just saying… PLEASE GET BACK TOGETHER AND MAKE ANOTHER ALBUM!\n\n7. Justin Timberlake – Tunnel Vision\n\nI know you li- I know you like it-it. Also, the video has lots and lots and lots of naked ladies (it’s tasteful though. Really!).\n\n6. Vance Joy – Emmylou\n\nAll I know is that whenever I listen to this song, I want to either grab an acoustic guitar and actually try to learn to play it (I can play approximately zero guitar) or just sing it at the top of my lungs. That to me means a song is really good. So, good job Vance Joy. The song also has an epic key change, which is everything to me.\n\n5. Drake – Hold On, We’re Going Home (feat. Majid Jordan)\n\nLook, I don’t need to say anything about the song because basically it’s amazing and Drake deserves lots of Grammys (and Junos since he’s Canadian) for it. Now, tell me who Majid Jordan is and why he’s got a ‘feat.’ credit.\n\n4. HAIM – If I Could Change Your Mind\n\nOk, for some reason this song is not on youtube so sorry for the live video, not sure it does the song justice. Also would just like to give major kudos to HAIM for basically blowing everyone trying to do 80s-style mega pop out of the water and still managing to get in with the indie crowd AND sell a truckload of albums while they’re at it.\n\n3. Lorde – Royals\n\nYes, it was overplayed, but really when a song is this perfect I can deal with that. Lorde makes me feel supremely old (I’m six years older than her), but also restores my faith that contemporary music isn’t completely going to shit. Basically, she saved 2013 from being completely dominated by Miley Cyrus (yes, I know she’s in my list too!).\n\n2. The National – This is the Last Time\n\nPerfection.\n\n1. Mutya Keisha Siobhan – Flatline\n\nThe biggest injustice of 2013’s music scene was that Flatline was not a more successful record. While most of the world probably didn’t much care, it was a pretty big deal that these three girls (formerly of Sugababes) were together again and making bloody incredible music. Bloody incredible music that unfortunately fell victim to poor handling and radio play. With Flatline, MKS brought poise, subtlety, and quality control to what could often be a ridiculous (not in a good way) pop scene (e.g., Robin Thicke, Lady Gaga). While MKS really need to stop with the long periods of silence when they feel like it, 2014 will hopefully be a smoother and more successful year for them. In the meantime, bask in the glorious harmonies and effortless pop perfection that is Flatline and worship at the altar of Mutya Keisha Siobhan.\n\nGreat Pop Albums, Part 2\n\nAnd so continues my listing of great pop albums. Some, may be well known, others obscure. Some may be just toeing the line of what it means to be a pop album, others may be proudly swimming in all their pop-filled glory. Either way, I find it strangely satisfying to make these lists so onwards I go!\n\nSophie B. Hawkins – Tongues and Tails (1992)\n\nIf ever I were to make a list of ‘debut albums that define an artist’ (wouldn’t that just be wonderful!), this would certainly be on it. Tongues and Tails with all of its idiosyncracies and unique subject matters is an album that could only be made by Sophie B. Hawkins. Featuring her big hit ‘Damn, I Wish Was Your Lover’ the album delves into lyrical territory at times taboo and at other just plain bizarre. A more brazen and forthright pop album is difficult to think of. Sophie begs to please her lover on a mountain side, contemplates the Freudian connotations of being carried by one’s mother, and tells a tale of Hansel and Gretel with an incestuous twist. Lyrical peculiarities aside though, Hawkins has truly crafted a lusciously sensual album, that immerses you in its New York scenery, erotic subtexts and art-pop sonic textures. Seeming to derive its sound from the likes of Prince and Roxy Music, Tongues & Tails is lush without being stagnant and wild without being bombastic. The perfect balance of sonic moods and textures is captured on this one of a kind record.\n\nTalk Talk – The Colour of Spring (1986)\n\nBefore venturing down an artier, more progressive sonic path, Talk Talk were another 80s synthpop band, albeit one that delivered albums with somewhat more substance (their sophomore effort It’s My Life being most worthy of mention). On their third record, though, the tide began to shift and rather than deliver another straightforward synth-led record, they delivered The Colour of Spring, a multifaceted, sonically complex yet still accessible masterpiece. Serving as the middleground between their early 80s pop and their later progressive experimentation, Colour offers a clear picture of the band in transition but never feels clumsy or pretentious. The tracks are at times dense, at others sparse but never lose their inherent melody. Song lengths are expanded to allow for greater experimentation but they never feel overlong or unnecessary. Mark Hollis’ voice is an undeniable component of what makes Talk Talk special, and its put to good use here, at times tremolous and morose and at others soaring and inspiring. A great album from a group who were on the verge of finding their ‘true’ musical direction.\n\nFlorence + the Machine – Lungs (2009)\n\nSeemingly gifted with the ability to wail away demons, Florence Welch’s first full length recording venture is filled with imagery of ghosts, spectres, stars, and general pagan funtimes. Ok, so that’s not all that Lungs has to offer. In fact, it’s just part of the album’s many charms of which Welch’s voice is definitely one. Ranging from soulful and morose to pure and ethereal, Welch wails, bellows, coos, and pleas throughout an album that recalls the likes of Kate Bush in its idiosyncratic imagery and vocals, Siousxie Soux in its brash emotionality and Joanna Newsom in its utilisation of many a stringed instument, but predominantly the harp. So far it sounds like a bit of a mess doesn’t it? But it wouldn’t have been such a success if that were so. In fact, Florence + the Machine create a rich and interesting tapestry of sound and imagery that is at once energising and imaginative, introspective and combative. The cover may scream ‘pre-Raphaelite Kate Bush wannabe’ but Lungs more than stands on its own, bringing the best of Welch’s creativity out and offering many a distinctive moment.\n\nNicola Roberts – Cinderella’s Eyes (2011)\n\nThe most recent album of the selection presented here, Cinderella’s Eyes is a record that I never really expected to listen to. Afterall, I have no interest in the artist’s ventures with girl group Girls Aloud, and didn’t really think that the artist solo would have much to offer. Then I saw the video for ‘Beat of My Drum’ and it wasn’t so much the video that impressed me, just that the goddamn song got stuck in my head! Relenting and listening to the album I was pleased to discover an eclectic mix of sounds, a peculiar set of lungs powering idiosyncratic lyrics, and overall an impressive pop album. Roberts defies her image as ‘the quiet one’ of Girls Aloud, using the album to harness a brash, loud and energetic musical persona. That said, the album is not all upbeat electronica. In fact, anything but, with Roberts offering a range of interesting, diverse tracks, some introspective others celebratory, and averting any of that ‘in da club’ nonsense that so many of today’s pop singers churn out. This isn’t really the type of pop album that you dance to, and while it’s not exactly what you’d call ‘alternative-pop’ there’s is something odd about it that gives it a real individual charm.\n\nColdplay – A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002)\n\nUndeniably the album that turned Coldplay into absolute global superstars and probably the biggest group around now, Rush of Blood remains the band’s best effort. The album perfectly captures the early timidity of the group while also hinting at the ‘bigger’ sound they would pursue with Viva La Vida. Pop hooks abound amidst moments of idiosyncracy and sonic brashness, the band’s knack for melody never forsaken even in the album’s darker moments. The album feels more visceral than its predecessor with sparser arrangements and pared down instrumentation. However tracks like ‘Clocks’, ‘God Put a Smile Upon Your Face’, and ‘In My Place’ are moments of pure pop perfection, showcasing the band’s strong ability to craft pop hooks without sacrificing the integrity of their work. Never does the album feel contrived or unimaginative, and while the ideas on the album may not be completely original they are so well executed that they can be easily excused. Easily the band’s magnum opus (so far, anyway) Rush shines through simply because it feels like an authentic record, made from a ‘real’ place rather than trying to be anything grand.\n\nPaula Cole – This Fire (1996)\n\nAt the height of the Lilith Fair era many a talented female singer-songwriter could be heard on the airwaves, plucking their acoustic guitars and singing of whatever was on their minds. Not all did so with as much conviction and pure force as Paula Cole though and This Fire proved that the singer-songwriter was worthy of the accolades she received. Breaking the mould of her navel-gazing, and rather bland contemporaries, such as Sarah McLachlan, Shawn Colvin and Jewel, on This Fire Cole is insightful without being pretentious, fierce without being overbearing, and emotive without being precious. The myriad of sounds and instruments (most of them played by Cole herself) create a beguiling tapestry of sound, at times brash and rough, at others lush and languid. While having a strong lyrical focus, This Fire never forsakes musicality, instead creating accessible, yet idiosyncratic, musical landscapes to draw the listener in without sacrificing any of the record’s integrity. A song as catchy as ‘Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?’ is just as essential to the record as the hard-hitting and emotional ‘Hush, Hush, Hush’. In short, this is a record of contrasts; beautifully crafted contrasts.\n\nSophie Ellis-Bextor – Shoot From the Hip (2003)\n\nI’ve waxed lyrical about this album already on this blog, so there probably won’t be too much else to say other than to say why it should have made this list. If Ellis-Bextor is ever recognised for being as great a pop artist as she is, Shoot From the Hip should certainly be part of the celebration. Too often overlooked by the artist herself, Shoot is an odd little album, not quite breaking any pop ground but certainly attempting to stretch the boundaries. Rather than create a simple follow up to her multi platinum debut Read My Lips (‘It’s murder on the dancefloor…’), Ellis-Bextor surprisingly decided to do the opposite and create an album that was more akin to her indie pop work with theaudience than the nu-disco stuff she was by then famed for. Blending eclectic pop textures with introspective lyrics, Shoot is creatively restless but also features Ellis-Bextor’s most forward thinking compositions, such as the dreamy ‘Hello, Hello’ and the frenetic, paranoid ‘The Walls Keep Saying Your Name’. While Ellis-Bextor has continued to create outstanding pop records, none have managed to capture the spark that this album has, which is a shame since it offers a glimpse to something special.\n\nJustin Timberlake – FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006)\n\nI haven’t spent much time with this album, only listening to it at the beginning of this year and therefore my description of it will probably not be so eloquent. This is unfortunate since its a much better album that I ever thought it would be! The combination of Timberlake and Timbaland is indeed a good one, creating an eclectic and inspired record that refuses to be derivative and instead infuses its grooves with…well, grooviness. As the title would suggest, the record is often concerned with heavy petting but this doesn’t mean that the record is shallow or repetitive. There is a surprising depth to the record in all of its numerous layers of sound, and the transitions between tracks create a seamless feel so that the record truly becomes a united whole. A concept album of sorts, there are two distinct moods present, with the first half of the album featuring more upbeat electronica moments, while the second half of the album has a distinctly more RnB feel to it. A genuinely excellent pop album, FutureSex/LoveSounds raised the bar for contemporary pop/RnB records and rightly so – this is a record that would be difficult to beat.\n\nTori Amos – Scarlet’s Walk (2002)\n\nAn album as sprawling and ambitious as Scarlet’s Walk very rarely works. Name another album that successfully takes the listener on a journey right across America, giving the listener not only a pretty concise historical breakdown of the nation’s events but also allowing the artist to find closure regarding the injustice suffered by her Native American ancestors. Yeah, didn’t think so. Anyway, Tori Amos more than manages this on Scarlet’s Walk creating a lush tapestry of sound to complement her insightful and incisive lyrics as she assumes the character of Scarlet and sonically traverses across the USA. At eighteen tracks it may not be the most concise of Amos’ releases but it is engaging throughout and features lush arrangements that serve to wrap around her (arguably) best lyrics. Metaphor and strong imagery take the listener on Scarlet’s journey and offer glimpses not only into the psyche of the character but also an image of a nation struggling and mourned by the protagonist. While at times feeling too evenly paced, this is an expansive record dealing with expansive subject matter, and as such its large selection of midtempo numbers suit the mood of the record well, painting autumnal hues that draw the listener into the rich historical tapestry.\n\nNerina Pallot – Year of the Wolf (2011)\n\nWhile Nerina Pallot’s third record, The Graduate, had a distinctly more pop feel to it than her other releases, it is Year of the Wolf that manages to perfectly blend both the pop elements and more introspective singer-songwriter aspects of Pallot’s repertoire. At times harking back to the singer-songwriter movement of the 70s in its understated lyrics and lush soundscapes, at others displaying a vivacity and energy befitting any respectable pop record, Year of the Wolf is a refreshing addition to the pop world. Removed of all pretension yet still displaying a creativity worthy of much more accolade than it has received, there is never a dull moment on this record whether you listen to the cheeky ‘Turn Me On Again’, the punchy ‘I Think’ or the reflective ‘History Boys’. You can tell that Pallot and producer Bernard Butler have put everything into the making of this record in order to create a one of a kind album that Pallot absolutely owns.\n\nGotye – Making Mirrors (2011)\n\nGotye’s music has always been an interesting blend of the pop and alternative worlds, his propensity for sampling and looping usually blurring the lines between the two. However, on Making Mirrors Gotye creates an album that is a perfect realisation and melding of pop and alternative, having its moments of idiosyncrasy but also displaying the most accessibility of any Gotye release. Whether its the infectious earworm of breakup song ‘Somebody That I Used to Know’, the quirky, vocoded vocals of ‘State of the Art’, or the beautifully nostalgic ‘Bronte’ each track on the album is an engaging and impressionistic part of the sonic gallery that is Making Mirrors. In fact, its easy to think of the album as collection of individual portraits, each telling their own story but also relating to the picture of the album as a whole. Avoiding any art-pop cliches or heavy handedness, Mirrors is a deftly composed and musically intelligent record and marks an excellent addition to Gotye’s catalogue.\n\nSia – Colour the Small One (2004)\n\nColour the Small One is such an unassuming, quiet, introspective record that it is no wonder that world failed to notice it when it was first released. Of course, since then Sia has gone on to create a much larger musical profile for herself and score much bigger successes. However, in getting to understand Sia it’s essential to listen to Colour as it stands as her most personal and introspective record to date. Enveloping the listener in layers of warm, organic instrumentation and downtempo rhythms, Colour creates a contemplative and mysterious atmosphere. The sparse arrangements and frank lyrics create a stark reality, yet there is always an undercurrent of hope and optimism to the tracks that may not be readily apparent on initial listens. More than just a ‘mood’ record, or a ‘chill out’ album (although its perfect for that!), Colour is worthy of repeated listens as it continues to unveil its charms the more one listens to it."
