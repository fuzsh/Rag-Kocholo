        "text": "We first met her back in 1997 when her debut single “Where Have All The Cowboys Gone?”, began a crazy course in the charts reaching the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, for which she received seven Grammy nominations, the following year, winnigng the one in the “Best New Artist” category. The song “I Don’t Want to Wait” was used as the musical theme in the TV series “Dawson’s Creek”, while the song “Feelin’ Love” was used in the tracklist of the soundtrack for the movie “City of Angels”. There were many more hits that followed, such as “Me”, “I Believe in Love”, “Be Somebody”, “14”, “Comin ‘Down”, “Music in Me”, “Eloise” etc. We are talking about one of the most important singers, songwriters and producers of the past few years who has never minced her words through her statements or even through her lyrics.\n\nPaula Cole is back with her latest album “Ballads,” a jazz album with covers and original songs that was released in 2017. She is now preparing for her big discographical comeback, which is expected on September 13, and has the title “Revolution,” through which she is expected to make her own “musical revolution” while a second part of “Ballads” is already finished and awaiting to be released after the release of this album!\n\nBut what does Paula Cole have to say about her creative “outburst”? What are her motivations and how does she deal with the socio-political events through her music? What are the difficulties she has encountered to get here and how does she manage to stand “free” within such a tough industry?\n\nIt is our great honor to have her at SounDarts.gr with this interview, through which Paula Cole talks about all the above with disarming sincerity!\n\nHello Ms. Paula Cole and welcome to SounDarts.gr! How was your love for music born and which was the moment in your life you thought that this is what you want to do?\n\nMy father was a musician, so I was singing melodies before speech. My Dad loved singing with me, and I loved singing with him. It was such a natural language, my first, really. I received a lot of encouragement from teachers through high school. Hadn’t it been for their support I may not have had the confidence to go to Berklee College of Music, where I met a lot of important people in my life.\n\nIn 1997 you were nominated for seven Grammy Awards from which you won the Best New Artist Award. What are your feelings to receive this honor?\n\nBeing a Grammy-winner is a title I’m lucky to have, like Professor, or Doctor. It is an introduction of sorts. But that’s about it. Of course I’m so fortunate for all of the accolades and attention but they are not, and they should not, be so important. I’m trying to focus on the work at hand, being a decent writer, musician, mother, person.\n\nYour latest album “Ballads” was released in 2017 for which you tackled some of jazz’s classic tunes. Could you please tell us how did this jazz-cover-album occur?\n\nI began as a jazz singer. I wanted to be a female-Chet baker, a vocal improviser, moving inside the chord changes. Then I began the therapeutic process of writing my own songs instead of singing standards from different eras of history. My own lyrics helped give me an outlet to my emotions, and that healed me some. I’ve been offered record deals from jazz labels over my career but I never took those deals, they weren’t right. If I were to make a jazz album then I had a very clear idea of what I was going to make. I wanted the rhythm section to be more guitar-based, more rootsy and folksy, utilizing my dear friend Kevin Barry on guitar and Jay Bellerose on drums. I’ve always believed in my musicians. I was so lucky to find them in college. I’ve always known how brilliant they are – it took some decades for everyone else to discover them, but they have. Now Kevin Barry tours with Rosanne Cash and Jay Bellerose is on most of T Bone Burnett’s recording sessions. I wanted to make my folksy-rootsy jazz album with Kevin and Jay. I wanted to choose songs that weren’t patronizing to women. I wanted to sing songs written by women, if possible. I wanted to celebrate the masters whom I love: Coltrane, Miles, Ella, Sarah, Nina Simone, Chet, Billie, Bobbie Gentry, Bob Dylan. I wanted to blend genres as did other artists (Miles, Nina, for example.) This was a very important and personal album for me. I dedicated to my father, Jim Cole, who was a bass player in a polka band and had to leave music for science in order to make a living for the family. I learned much of this music from him. I’ve always considered myself a jazz singer. I recorded 31 songs for the Ballads project, and so I have the “Ballads 2” album already recorded and ready for release in a couple of years, after my new album “Revolution” comes out this September 13th 2019.\n\nYou gave your 2010 album the title “Ithaca” which is the name of a famous Greek island and since we are from Greece I have to ask you… Why did choose this title for your album?\n\nIthaca is the home of Odysseus in Homer’s masterwork, “The Odyssey”. It has become such a touchstone for humanity that, in a sense, Ithaca is everyone’s home. Ithaca is my metaphor. It represents a time in my life that bore the songs on this album. I went into the world, I went to war and slayed beasts, I was exhausted, I was a fighter. But I needed to come back to my hometown of Rockport, MA after becoming divorced and being a single mother. It took about twenty years.\n\nHave you ever visited Greece?\n\nI have not. I must and I will visit Greece!\n\nAre you preparing your discographical comeback? If yes what should we expect from your next album?\n\nMy next album is being released September 13th 2019 and it’s called “Revolution”. In the spirit of Marvin Gaye and Bob Marley I made a social-political album with some personal songs at the heart of it. It is my “Amen” part 2.\n\nIt’s about breaking silence. Standing and speaking up for what one believes in. It’s time for a change in ourselves, in America, in the world. We must love one another better. As the late great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. says, “Love is somehow the key that unlocks the door to ultimate reality.”\n\nIs there any of your songs that holds a special place in your heart and why?\n\nGenerally I love my ballads most. I think they are the high-water-mark for what I do.\n\nHave you ever felt a great cataclysm of emotions while singing in public and if so how do you recall this moment? What did you do?\n\nIf I cry or feel an overwhelm of emotions, it’s impossible for me to sing. It hasn’t happened in quite some time. The last time was probably in Baden Baden, Germany in 1998. I began to cry, ran offstage and took several days off from the tour. I was sad to miss the tour dates but I needed to take care of myself. The Black Forest was a very special healing place for me.\n\nDid you face any major difficulties in your career until now? And did you have to take any hard decisions that could affect you?\n\nOf course there have been difficulties in the music business as a woman. When I started at Berklee College of Music the ratio of men to women was 13:1. When I joined Peter Gabriel’s tour there were over 60 men. I was one of 4 women. Of course that makes circumstances strained and lonely. I was the first woman to be Grammy-nominated as a solo producer in the Best Producer category. It was hard to change hearts and minds in supporting me as a young woman, wanting to produce. I think I would have had a much bigger career as a producer had I been born male. But I’m not ungrateful. It just made me a little bit tougher. Now that I’m 51 years old I would like to lose some of that toughness! I am striving to let go and be softer.\n\nIf you could tell your younger self a piece of advice, what would that be and why?\n\nI would tell myself, not to worry so much, that it will be okay. To be kind to myself and to love myself.\n\nWhat is your motto in life?\n\n“We are what we think. All that we are arises with our thoughts.” -Buddha."
