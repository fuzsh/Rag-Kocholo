        "text": "Cole, 30, is an interesting paradox. In person she excudes a Zen-like calm, yet she has a deep well of anger, which is usually unlocked by music. “I’m a bit of a live wire, and music stirs up my energy inside,” she says. “If something is wrong with my emotions, my feelings instantly turn to rage.” This comes from a life-time of struggling to please people, which, she says, “partly disgusts me. I tried so hard to please everyone that I would lose myself – which I think happens to a lot of women. I was the golden girl as a kid.” Although the former prom queen has left her strait-laced Yankee past behind, she still feels that pressure to be Miss Perfect. “I may not be class president, but I am Paula Cole, and that’s kind of similar,” she says.\n\nOften she will release this typhoon of rage onstage, but occasionally she finds herself being “snappy and curt” to people she doesn’t mean to be snappy and curt with offstage. The pressure now is unending, and she doesn’t like the way it makes her feel.\n\nEven as a young child, Paula Cole was percolating with feelings.\n\nShe spent her earliest years in Ithaca, New York, in a trailer park with her sister, Irene; artist mom, Stephanie; and father, Jim, who at that time was studying for his doctorate in entomology (bugs, to oversimplify) at Cornell. “His life became so miserable, staring at a petri dish under a microscope fourteen hours a day, that he had an epiphany slash nervous breakdown,” Cole says, “which was probably one of the best things that happened to him, because we left that life.” He took a job as a biology professor at Salem State College (eventually leaving to become a quality-control manager), and the family moved to Rockport. “They bought this 200-year-old colonial house that was in the crappiest condition, and they were constantly renovating it,” Cole recalls. “I just remember growing up amidst insulation and sheetrock, and it was so fucking cold in my house.” (The lyrics to “Bethlehem,” on her debut album, Harbinger, include the lines “It’s my birthday next week, and what I want, please/Is to turn on the heat so the fish won’t freeze/The fish in the tank froze and died last week/Oh, I want to be a dog or I want to be a leaf.”)\n\nThe family ate a lot of mac ‘n’ cheese and franks ‘n’ beans, so a repulsed Cole ate “cereal for my entire youth – breakfast, lunch, dinner.” The household, she says, was “rich with music. My dad played a lot of folk songs – Buck Owens, Johnny Cash – people that told stories. And I was a little canary.” Early song-writing efforts included “My Name Is Paula” and the Ominous-sounding “God May Take the Earth.”\n\nEditor’s picks\n\n“My sister was literally able to sing before she could talk,” says Irene, now a nurse in San Francisco. “She really had this God-given talent. I remember her singing in school plays and just being so, so good – so beyond what the little town of Rockport could offer.”\n\nIn her small high school, Cole was an honor student and was actively involved in chorus, musicals (“I sang all those sexist songs like ‘I Enjoy Being a Girl'”) and cheerleading (“I liked the musicality and rhythm of it; also, I thought it would help my popularity”), and she was class president for three years. Oh, and junior-prom queen. “I put together the prom, so I think they made me queen as a sympathy vote,” she says. “I went with a friend.” She says that nobody asked her out. “Actually, if they had, I think I would have been terrified,” she recalls. “I don’t think I was comfortable with my sexuality at that point. I was still very tender and afraid. I was a fragile young bud in a hostile world.”\n\nYou may have noticed that some of the things Cole says are the kinds of tremulous, corny things that twelve-year-old girls say before they learn to be self-conscious. “I just go with the flow,” she’ll say. “Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.” This takes getting used to, but, rest assured, it is not a pose.\n\n“Paula really is that person who comes through in interviews and who she portrays onstage,” says Irene. “She’s very real.”\n\nRelated\n\nAnyhoo. When Cole made her way to the Berklee College of Music, in Boston, the aforementioned young bud burst all over the damn place.\n\nI DIDN’T BECOME SEXUALLY FREE UNTIL I LEFT my parents and left Rockport,” Cole says. “I made some mistakes, that’s for sure. I just went with the way my body felt. I definitely was not prepared to be a woman in this world. Like so many of us.” We walk briskly as a breeze picks up, lightly scented with duck shit, which, Cole points out, “makes life.”\n\nAt Berklee, Cole took classes in jazz vocals, and she supported herself by singing in hotel lounges and weddings, “in some bad dress, singing Whitney Houston or something.” She also sang backup for Dale Bozzio of Missing Persons during Bozzio’s previously-unremarked-upon solo stint.\n\n“Back then, she was staring at the floor, closing her eyes or even turning her back on the audience,” says her longtime drummer, Jay Bellerose. “So many teachers would tell her she had to make eye contact.”"
