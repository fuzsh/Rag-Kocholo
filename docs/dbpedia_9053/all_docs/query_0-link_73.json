        "text": "The incomparable and legendary Paula Cole released her 11th studio album titled ‘Lo’ last month.\n\nThe album sees Cole as the sole writer and producer of the 11 tracked album. Cole is no stranger to producing her own work, in fact she was the first ever woman to be nominated for the Best Producer Grammy in her own right. This milestone was not only an incredible achievement for Cole but paved the way for many female artists to follow in her footsteps. Even to this day I talk to women who struggle with people believing they produce their own work which of course is absurd.\n\nPaula Cole has worked with the same musicians that she has worked with for years on this album. On ‘Lo’ , which was recorded live features Jay Bellerose (drums), Chris Bruce (guitars), Ross Gallagher (upright and electric bass, backing vocals) and Rich Hinman (pedal steel, guitars). The album was recorded and mixed by nine-time-Grammy-award-winning-engineer, Mike Piersante. Paula cites on her website that Piersante’s unique sound is the canvas for “Lo.”\n\nLo is an album that is described as autobiographical and very personal as it takes us on a journey of Cole’s life.\n\nHer website says of the album;\n\nThe autobiographies that are the songs of “Lo”, are the newest Polaroid snapshots of Cole’s life. The focus is her most recent period of years, saying goodbye to her friend and early collaborator, Mark Hutchins, on “The Replacements & Dinosaur Jr.”, reflecting on her childhood’s psychological influence in “Follow The Moon”, her primary relationship, in which she wrestles inner demons in “Green Eyes Crying”, lays down her “Invisible Armor” to find hope, rebirth, acceptance in “Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,” and physical intimacy in “take it take it take it”.\n\nCole faces her identity in the spine-chilling, redemptive “Wildflower”. “Lo” is a window to Paula Cole’s psyche. Continuing her social-justice writing through music, Cole’s “Lo” reveals songs “Calling All Saviors” (a catchy pop gem), and “Letter From A Quarry Miner” (written from a North American quarryman, to his European family during The Great Depression in 1932.) Cole weaves in the words of W. B. Yeats in “Golden Apples of the Sun ” while honoring Ray Bradbury in “Fahrenheit 451”. The song is a poem, touching on the concept of the anthropocene and the frightening prospect of erasing history. With her eleventh studio album, “Lo”, Cole eloquently weaves the personal with the universal, the shy with the provocative. She concludes with the uplifting “Flying Home”, an homage to Max Erhmann’s “Desiderata”.\n\nThe atmospheric Follow The Moon opens the album and sets the tone well of what a great album it’s going to be! If you love gentle yet spirited and fiery vocals, then this album is definitely worth a listen.\n\nThe Replacements & Dinosaur Jr is a fast favourite with stand out lyrics reflecting back on her time with her late producer and friend. Talking of bands and wishing he could hear her music and that the world knew who he was is really touching.\n\nYou showed me The Replacements and Dinosaur Junior\n\nThe Beatles, yes, you preferred John\n\nXTC and Daniel Lanois and Bonita Applebum\n\nI wish I could play you my songs right now\n\nI wish the world knew who you were\n\nA brilliant producer who never even had a single day in the sun\n\nI understand your last moment was a laugh\n\nLeaning too far back in your chair\n\nThe joke is life, if we care to look\n\nYou dared to look, yes, you dared\n\nThe Jazziness blended with Soul on take it take it take it has a strong sense of live performance in it! Think smokey jazz clubs when you listen to this song and it transports you right there! It also hold elements of trip hop!\n\nInvisible Armour perfectly speaks of vulnerability, hope and finding oneself in both its lyrics and melody and of course in Cole’s descriptive vocals!\n\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday is also a favourite with its stunning piano melody. It’s simple but elegant and a beautiful listen!\n\nGreen Eyes Crying takes us down a darker route melodically but in such a bewildering and alluring way!\n\nCalling All Saviours breathes notes of old school Cole such as I Don’t Want To Wait. It is vocally so joyous to hear. The level of vocal changes is sensational and really emotive! The chorus is addictive to the ear!\n\nLetter From a Quarry Miner brings more of a country/Americana vibe with a somewhat dark and hypnotic melody.\n\nThe build up in Wildflower is so powerful and entrancing. The closer of Flying Home is a perfect way to end Lo. The intro of the pedal steel guitar is really effective.\n\nA blend of genres such as folk, pop, Americana, rock and soul – The album is a beautiful gift from beginning to end with an incredible flow of well scripted and highly breathtaking melodies. Cole’s vocals are poetic and powerfully expressive. The words are believable in her passionate tone and each song soars of emotion delivering a picturesque and well lived life. The journey she take us on is raw at times but uplifting at others."
