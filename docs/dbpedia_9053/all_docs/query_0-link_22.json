        "text": "An extraordinary songwriter with a gorgeous voice.\n\n—Rolling Stone\n\nPaula is an original voice both in what she is saying and how she is saying it.\n\n—Peter Gabriel\n\nA fantastic artist.\n\n—Herbie Hancock\n\nIn 1996, Paula Cole released her self-produced second album, This Fire. It was an double-platinum smash, and lead single “Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?” catapulted into the top 10 of Billboard’s Hot 100. Her songwriting was especially loved by traditionalists, feminists, and the LGBTQIA community. Cole was nominated for seven Grammys and became the first solo woman to be nominated for Producer of the Year. Her second single, the anthemic “I Don’t Want to Wait,” dominated charts for a year and was the well-loved theme song for the television show Dawson’s Creek.\n\nCole’s songwriting pushes boundaries and touches hearts and minds. Her live performances are movements of passion. She was a seminal figure in the formation of the first Lilith Fair and has performed the world over."
