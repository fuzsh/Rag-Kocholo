        "text": "Part of the 2022 Open Sky Arts Festival\n\n2 Powerhouse Vocalists… 1 Incredible Concert\n\nIn 1996, Paula Cole released her self-produced, second album This Fire. It was incendiary, a double-platinum smash. The first single, Where Have All The Cowboys Gone? catapulted to the Top 10. Her songwriting was loved by traditionalists, feminists, the LGBTQIA community, the whole world. Cole was nominated for 7 Grammy awards and was the first woman to be nominated as Producer of the Year with no collaborators. Her second single, the anthemic I Don’t Want to Wait dominated charts for a year and then lived again as the well-loved theme-song for Dawson’s Creek. Cole pushes boundaries and touches hearts and minds with her songwriting. Her live performances are movements of passion. She was a seminal figure in the formation of the first Lilith Fair, and has performed the world over, for the Troops in the Persian Gulf, to coffee houses in small towns across America, to stadiums with Peter Gabriel, to elegant theaters. Now, twenty-five years later, Paula Cole will perform songs from her ground-breaking album, This Fire in select cities. This is a rare opportunity to witness her historical work.\n\nSophie B. Hawkins burst onto the international music scene with her 1992 platinum-selling debut album, Tongues and Tails, which included the indelible hit song Damn, I Wish I Was Your Lover, and earned her a Best New Artist Grammy nomination. The last three decades have brought multiple awards, sold out concerts, appearances on film and television, performances with some of the best known names in the business, a documentary feature, a critically-lauded tour-de-force performance as Janis Joplin in the nationally-touring play Room 105, songs appearing in hit films and TV shows, and five more albums, including Whaler, which featured the record-breaking longest-running single in Billboard Adult Contemporary chart history, the Number One hit, As I Lay Me Down. Much more than just a singer, Sophie writes all of her own songs, is a multi-instrumentalist, and has been fully involved in every aspect of the production of her records herself, from background vocals and playing her own instruments, to engineering and production of her albums. She has proved an enduring artist with a fierce commitment to artistic integrity while both constantly evolving, and remaining steadfastly true to her own authentic history and experience which connects her to her fans at the very deepest levels.\n\nTogether, they come together for one incredible evening."
