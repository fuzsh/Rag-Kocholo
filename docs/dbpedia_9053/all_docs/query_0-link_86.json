        "text": "Anyone here fans of Paula Cole?\n\nDespite a couple big hits, she never found much of an audience like her Lilith Fair peers at the time. She didn't have the cool edginess of Fiona or the soccer mom crossover appeal of Sarah McLachlan. She didn't have the flow of radio hits like Sheryl or the kooky backstory of Jewel. Instead, she seemed to become known as the Dawson's Creek singer, and ended up suffering from the \"Best New Artist\" grammy curse.\n\nBut WHAT A VOICE. And what an incredible songwriter. \"I Believe In Love\" is one of my favorite songs of all time.\n\nI went through a phase of listening to nothing but 'A Few Small Repairs', 'Tigerlily' and 'This Fire' a few years back. 90's female singer-songwriters were so good. I was shocked to discover that 'Harbinger' was just as good, if not better than 'This Fire'. Love all the songs, lyrics, and that voice.\n\nShe did a small tour in the U.S. performing 'This Fire' in full last year and though I am not a big fan of live-recordings I listened to the whole show and it is very good and Paula sounds just as strong as she did 20 years ago. This is a great interview explaining as to why she didn't go on to bigger and better things.\n\nhttp://mainetoday.com/maine_music/paula-cole-celebrates-20th-anniversary-fire-show-arundel/\n\nhttp://www.amny.com/entertainment/p...fire-on-iconic-album-s-anniversary-1.12398004\n\nI went through a phase of listening to nothing but 'A Few Small Repairs', 'Tigerlily' and 'This Fire' a few years back. 90's female singer-songwriters were so good.

She toured with Paula quite a bit (did they both go to Berklee?). I have followed Holly's career ever since but can't help but think that Alanis and Sheryl (love them both) took centre stage and many equally talented females just weren't given airtime etc as a result.\n\ni revisited I Believe In Love randomly this morning and I've never felt better, mentally + physically. It's the ultimate pick-me-up song. What an underrated/misunderstood gem from the late 90's.\n\nI wonder if it's re-recorded now by a big pop girl it'll smash. It still sounds fresh AS fuck. Not me ignoring her when she didn't deliver after This Fire and immediately cancelling Amen/Courage - which were such awesome albums. I haven't dived into her crowd-funded/produced stuff yet but I'm curious. Also I was listening to 'This Bright Red Feeling' on Spotify and didn't notice the difference between the 20th Anniversary Edition versions of WHTCG and I Don't Want To Wait to the originals?\n\nHer voice is amazing.\n\ni revisited I Believe In Love randomly this morning and I've never felt better, mentally + physically.

I was disappointed with Amen and Courage, but have you heard Raven? There's a few tracks (Secretary being one) on there which are very This Fire, in their quiet/shouty glory.\n\nShe's touring both Amen and Harbinger at the moment/very soon. I was disappointed with Amen and Courage, but have you heard Raven? There's a few tracks (Secretary being one) on there which are very This Fire, in their quiet/shouty glory.\n\nYup I just checked out her entire discography on Spotify today and the Secretary was really quite a surprising cut from Raven. I still prefer her bigger studio albums than the fan-funded ones though, they sounded more mastered? That's so awesome that she's still touring now, I bet if I never go to the US, I won't be able to see her ever.\n\nThis Fire has been on repeat since I learned the album is about to (FINALLY) be released on vinyl. Couldn't be more excited.\n\nIt really is such a stunning debut. I've of course been listening to Sin√©ad O'Connor a lot over the last week and I hear so much of her DNA in Paula's work. Not just the voice with its gigantic range and dynamics, but the bluntness of the lyrics and fearlessness is clear. This Fire, like The Lion and The Cobra, are no skips records that loudly introduced the artists. Paula has always been outspoken on many topics, but it was her feminist stances - which fueled armpitgate - that allowed society to brush her aside after her inescapable singles.\n\nSo excited to own This Fire on vinyl. However it's concerning that Paula hasn't mentioned it, which makes me think she didn't have an ounce of say in it and may not see any money from it. Such a fucked industry."
