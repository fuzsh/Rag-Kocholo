        "text": "Paula Cole\n\nScroll down for info on reserving a pre-show meal with Margins Cafe.\n\nFor tickets to this event click BOOK NOW button above\n\nGrammy-winning singer-songwriter and producer Paula Cole will release Lo, her first collection of entirely new, original songs in nearly a decade, on March 1, 2024. Today, Paula shares the first single from the album, \"The Replacements & Dinosaur Jr.” - a heartfelt tribute to her friend and artistic mentor, Mark Hutchins, who left us too soon, aged 51. The song pays homage to Hutchins’ musical influences, spanning from The Replacements and Dinosaur Jr. to The Beatles, XTC, Daniel Lanois, and A Tribe Called Quest. This song, like the forthcoming album, beautifully blends vulnerability with joy, staying true to Paula's signature authentic and soul-stirring style.\n\nBook For A Pre-Show Dinner\n\nMake your free dinner reservation to eat at our Margins Café before the show!\n\nYou must have a general admission ticket for the show to gain entry for dinner.\n\nDoors will open for early dinner ticket holders at 18:30.\n\nThe Margins Café serves delicious, freshly prepared food at gigs and events.
