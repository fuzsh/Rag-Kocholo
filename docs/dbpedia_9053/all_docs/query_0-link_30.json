        "text": "Paula Cole (Photo: Ebru Yildiz)\n\nLo, the first new album of original material from Grammy-winning singer/songwriter Paula Cole in nearly a decade, proves the old adage, sometimes things are worth waiting for.\n\nDecades since Paula first came to national prominence with her 1997 hit, “Where Have All The Cowboys Gone?”, her new album finds the artist bravely revealing deeper layers in her music, ripping off the band-aid of hurt and disillusionment, vulnerability and insecurities are laid bare against a rich atmospheric backdrop of compelling songcraft.\n\nRock Cellar: It’s been almost ten years since you’ve released an album of original material. What was going on with your creative process in that period? Or was it a case of coming up with the right material that would fit within how you were trying to express yourself?\n\nPaula Cole: I did release some original songs, an album called Revolution, but that was very themed with the election that was going on and honestly, I think I needed time away from myself.\n\nI think I wasn’t ready to be so vulnerable in my songwriting. Now that I look back and I’m looking at the music I’ve just written and I’m releasing, it’s really vulnerable. To be so honest and to talk about things in your personal life, your psyche, your parents, your relationship, the stupid mistakes you make, the trauma you’ve had. It took me a really long time to understand that and to speak it, to even know what I was feeling. So I was duty-bound, I think.\n\nI wanted to be a jazz singer, and kind of digested it and felt disillusioned by it and abandoned it. So in this period I was raising my kids and being really introverted, quite like a hermetic esthetic thing, raising my kids and being on the tip of the north shore of Massachusetts. I was making my jazz album, and I was doing that for my dad as well as me.\n\nThen I recorded this album of originals, and the music was just flowing. I think working with Jason Isbell and John Paul White helped me kind of spark and honor my writing again, because suddenly we were going to be meeting in Nashville to record together and we needed a song. So I just wrote a song because we needed something to record together.\n\nRock Cellar: And what song was that?\n\nPaula Cole: That was a song called “Mother, Son and Holy Ghost,” and they added their two cents and I gave them their share of writing credit, for sure. Essentially, it was something I brought to the table, and then they made it better. I was also a fan of their writing. Jason’s writing is so beautiful, and I was just really spending time with it. I was impressed with just how vulnerable he allows himself to be.\n\nClick here to pre-order Lo on CD from our Rock Cellar Store\n\nClick here to pre-order Lo on LP from our Rock Cellar Store\n\nIn my life, it coincided with the realization that writing something that’s a little bit scary and very personal is probably the best writing you can do. And that, coupled with the fact that my kids are growing up and moving and flying out of the nest, has given me the freedom to visit myself again and go back to therapy and take care of myself after taking care of others.\n\nRock Cellar: As an artist and songwriter, how do you think your goals for success have changed since you started making your mark back in the ’90s?\n\nPaula Cole: It’s like I have these two bookend careers, and there’s space in the middle where I took time away from the business just to kind of go back to my humanity. The first career, it happened very fast, and it felt ill-fitting for this introvert, and it wasn’t quite right. So I went away and had my family, got a divorce. I mean, a lot of things happened in that time.\n\nBut the problem is, I worship at the altar of music. I love music. It is my raison d’etre. It’s my gift. I can’t be without it, or it’s like an evil puppet head within that starts to devour me. [laughs]\n\nSo I needed to get back. And, yes, I guess I was afraid to go back into the business because I definitely had been abused and used, and so I kept it really small. I think I’ve been keeping myself small, honestly. I’ve been making my own independent records and my core fan base has been with me on that journey. God bless them. And now, this time I’m deciding that I’m ready to be vulnerable again, and it’s coinciding with some freedom in my personal life.\n\nI realized that I really want to be out in the world again. I really need it. I really want it and I miss it. So it feels different after many years. And my overarching goals, I think they’ve always been the same. I want to make great art. I want to die knowing that I gave myself to this music, to this gift, and did the best that I could do with it, make the best art I could make and leave a beautiful catalog.\n\nI don’t need to pursue other money-making things. I’ve never wanted that. I never wanted to create a perfume line or any of that bullshit. I’m in it for the music, always. I felt like the first pop career, it started to go off the tracks a little bit. It was happening too fast, so I pulled back.\n\nI needed my integrity, I needed my personal life. And yeah, it’s always to me about the song. The song is the seed of everything.\n\nRock Cellar: Let’s talk about the song “The Replacements & Dinosaur Jr..” It was written about your late friend Mark Hutchins.\n\nPaula Cole: Yeah, bless his soul. He’s left two kids and his wife behind. But Mark and I graduated Berklee College of Music together. I waited a year until he graduated. I waitressed while he finished up; he was an engineer and production major. He was older than me, but he started school later than me, and I waited for him and then we drove across the country together to San Francisco, and we lived in a loft apartment above a gas station.\n\nIt was an extremely prolific time for me. I wrote “Where Have All The Cowboys Gone?” and “Hush, Hush, Hush,” a lot of songs on my first two albums. That’s when I was called to sing with Peter Gabriel, so that time in my life was musically rich. We both loved Peter Gabriel and connected there, but I don’t know if I would have gone so deeply into listening to producers like Daniel Lanois. That was radical, Daniel’s beautiful solo albums.\n\nHe turned me on to more quirkier, more raw, angular, rocking music and early hip-hop, too, kind of alternative, bohemian hip-hop, and it was fantastic, just fantastic. This was pre-digital, so you’d have to comb record stores. You’d have to comb and find things. Finding music was a huge part of the quest. I grew up in Rockport, Massachusetts, which was the tip of an island on Cape Ann, Massachusetts. You didn’t even get the radio signal in. I was the most far removed from being exposed to anything hip. I was basically influenced by my parents who only had a few albums, but they made music. So I grew up making music.\n\nRock Cellar: What were the albums you heard the most around the house that your parents played?\n\nPaula Cole: Probably the best stuff was Paul Simon, Simon and Garfunkel and John Denver, and then there was a Ray Charles album. But the hipness kind of ended. I was mostly singing folk songs and three-part harmony with my family and then I found jazz and I thought, “Oh my God, I want to be like a female Chet Baker. I want to improvise.” I loved it.\n\nI loved standards so I started learning standards when I was still in high school. I would drive myself into Boston when I got my license so I could study with a jazz trumpet player and drummer and vocal teacher, and I would learn how to improvise over chord changes and stuff. That’s what I thought I wanted to do. But it kind of strange where I was musically. I had a great songbook of American music in me.\n\nI knew that making music was joyful and fun, but I didn’t even really hear the Beatles until Mark introduced them to me and it was largely The White Album. He just exposed me to so much music. You’d have to search for it at a place like the Coop in Harvard Square. I would take the train into Cambridge and you’d go to the Coop because they had an international vinyl section that you could listen to. That’s how I started finding things like Kate Bush, otherwise I was very isolated musically.\n\nMark just exploded my mind in the ’90s and was a wonderful influence. He got me to start doing a little engineering and thinking about production and now that I look back on it, he was visionary. We wanted to make a musical duo, which would have been called Moist & Creamy. [laughs] Oh my God, [laughs], just because everybody hates those words. We thought it was so fucking funny.\n\nAnd I was like, “Well, let’s make a name out of it,” and we want it to be like this weird bohemian duo. But my record label got wind of that and they shut that down. [laughs] They did not want that. I wanted Mark to produce my first album and that didn’t happen either, so unfortunately our professional path started diverging because I was signed to Imago and they had Henry Rollins and Aimee Mann on the label.\n\nIt was definitely left of center, and I was definitely like that. My music was kind of dark horse and different. It was a singer/songwriter’s confessional autobiography. But it was hard to describe. It was very diverse musically. Unfortunately, I wanted so badly to take Mark on the journey with me, but that’s when the pressures of the business started to come into our life and so I went off, did the Peter Gabriel tour, and Kevin Killen produced my first album, and he’s brilliant. I learned so much from Kevin and then it diverged again, and I self-produced the second album.\n\nSo Mark and I split up and he moved to Austin and got married, and he came back East. He was working on the Colbert show, and we just started picking up the thread again before he passed away. It’s like I say in the song, “the more you live, the more you lose.” The longer you live, the more you lose people that are part of your life and part of your story and part of your music and he was just too young. He still has so much to do. I miss him, and I’m so thankful. I don’t know if I really got to thank him as much as I needed to.\n\nIt started coming out of the music, which I find happens when I have subconscious information that needs outlet-ing. It comes out in my songs.\n\nRock Cellar: What do you think are the life lessons that you’ve gained through the years that you’re imparting upon your record with the lyrics, either consciously or subconsciously?\n\nPaula Cole: I definitely have fresh perspective now because I recorded this album in Los Angeles in 2022, and I was coming off of recording with Jason Isbell and John Paul White and then all this river of feeling and thought and subconscious information was flowing, and I was just trusting it and going with it. Then I recorded it all, and put it on the shelf, and then I started producing a new young artist. Her name is Eva James, and we’re still working on the album.\n\nFrom there I was caught up in a musical that I was writing, and both of those other projects stopped. It was like some kind of kismet. I pulled out of the musical, and Eva James needed to take a break. and so I thought, “Wow, I’ve been diverting all of my energy away from my own work and that’s great, that’s fine.” I realized, I think I was a little scared to release it, but the whole universe was saying, it’s time.\n\nThese other projects are paused, move forward with this piece of work that you have sitting on the shelf. So Mike Piersante and I finished the mixes, and my perspective on it is that, yes, it’s vulnerable. There are a few songs that are more universal, I suppose, but largely, I’m just being soft.\n\nI’m 55 now, and I’ve raised my kid. I’ve been cool and uncool and cool again and misunderstood, and I don’t see any point in being so self-protective anymore and so afraid. Like I say in the music, it feels like this heavy armor that I don’t want anymore. It doesn’t serve me, and I’m just getting older, and I just want to be free, and that starts with me being free.\n\nRock Cellar: You brought up the word “armor,” let’s talk about your latest single, “Invisible Armor.”\n\nPaula Cole: I realized I am my own obstacle right now. I had trauma, and I was carrying around invisible forcefields and protective invisible armor and suspicion and mistrust, always being on the edge of a room, always leaving a party and not even going out.\n\nI was leading an hermetic existence and not being me, and I see that. I needed to serve my family. Being a mother, it’s long, and it’s thankless. It takes time, and it takes a lot of love and selflessness and I put myself on hold for a while, but I had things to do. I had children to raise, and then I come back to myself if they’re adults, and I’m realizing that I have another snake skin I need to shed. I continue to evolve.\n\nWe don’t stop. I want to stay curious. I want to learn and grow. I needed to evolve. It’s funny how some things seemingly coincidentally happen, like I did my first psychedelic journey on a heroic dose of psilocybin, and that definitely helped. I chose rather consciously to see what plant medicine would show me and to not be afraid about that and to use it because I read that it was extremely helpful with vets, people with PTSD.\n\nI felt like I was carting around an old version of myself. I was carting around the armor, and I had PTSD about things that had happened in my life, and it was holding me back. So reading about how profoundly helpful that can be psychologically to people’s healing process.\n\nMichael Pollan did a documentary called How To Change Your Mind, which I recommend. I recommend seeing that if you’re curious and you do it responsibly and you do it lovingly. I don’t do this lightly, I don’t do this recreationally. I do it ceremoniously, and I did it specifically for PTSD and for healing, and it was growth promoting, so I would do it very responsibly.\n\nI don’t want to encourage anyone to do anything they don’t want to do or anything like that. I’m looking back reflectively about my process, and how did I dare to get so personal again, and I think I was avoiding that very thing. I think I was avoiding being so vulnerable, and I just needed to be brave again.\n\nPaula Cole’s 2024 tour dates:"
