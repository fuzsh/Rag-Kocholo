As always, whether your musical tastes are rock ’n’ roll, jazz, heavy metal, R&B, singer-songwriter or indie, there will always be something to check out.\n\nHere are seven of the best on the docket for the week of July 12:\n\nThird Eye Blind — Friday at Freedom Mortgage Pavilion\n\nIt’s become a trend with Third Eye Blind to hit the road when the sun is at its peak, all part of their seemingly endless “Summer Gods Tour.” It makes complete sense when you think about it, as so many of the Bay Area band’s songs conjure images of the season, whether it’s hits like “Semi-Charmed Life,” “Never Let You Go” and “Blinded,” or deeper cuts like “The Red Summer Sun” and the more recent “Box of Bones.” Adding pop punkers Yellowcard to the bill as support is just one more reason why it makes sense to head over to Camden on a mid-July evening.\n\nPaula Cole — Friday at New Hope Winery\n\nA truth-teller, provocateur, feminist and brilliant autobiographical writer who has pushed for personal honesty and change, Paula Cole has in recent years honored her love for jazz and folk standards, and songs for social justice with the LPs “Ballads,” “American Quilt” and “Revolution.” The Best New Artist Grammy-winner released a new record, “Lo,” back in March, composing all the songs as a way to navigate her opening to trust again after life’s indelible blows. Weaving the personal with the universal, she wrestles with questions of identity and intimacy, history and our collective failure to learn from it, ultimately showing the album to be a window into her own psyche, which she now plans to do in front of an audience, along with hits from the past like “I Don’t Want to Wait” and “Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?”\n\nJohn Lodge — Friday at The Keswick Theater and Monday at Ocean City Music Pier\n\nBassist, singer and songwriter for Rock & Roll Hall of Famers the Moody Blues, John Lodge penned hits by the band like “Ride My See-Saw,” “I’m Just a Singer (in a Rock and Roll Band)” and “Isn’t Life Strange?” Now that the group has ceased touring, Lodge has become passionate about keeping the legacy alive with his 10,000 Light Years Band providing a unique opportunity to continue to experience the magic that has sold some 70 million albums worldwide. As a none-too-subtle nod at his past, his new album, “Days of Future Passed — My Sojourn,” will be the primary focus of the show, which is to say it will be squarely on the Moody Blues.\n\nJustin Hayward + Christopher Cross — Saturday at The Keswick Theater and Sunday at Wind Creek Event Center\n\nThe night after Lodge performs, in what can only be considered a coincidence of epic proportions, Justin Hayward will play the Keswick. As the voice of the Moody Blues, the singer and guitarist is promising new music, classic hits and “good vibes” ahead of the show. He’ll be joined by co-headliner Christopher Cross, the yacht rock legend responsible for hits like “Sailing” and “Ride Like the Wind.” The next night, the two will make their way to Bethlehem for a show at Wind Creek Event Center. And while it’s a shame the Moody Blues aren’t touring anymore, it’s hard to be a fan and not smile at the multiple opportunities this weekend and beyond to hear the songs that put them on the map.\n\nThe Pretenders — Sunday at The Fillmore\n\nThe Pretenders have been busy lately, with their current run of live dates following last year’s release of the band’s most recent studio album, “Relentless,” which marked the second consecutive full-length songwriting collaboration by founder and frontwoman Chrissie Hynde and guitarist James Walbourne following 2020’s acclaimed “Hate for Sale.” And just this past May saw the 40th anniversary re-issue of the band’s landmark LP “Learning To Crawl,” made under the shadow of the passings of guitarist James Honeyman-Scott and bassist Pete Farndon. Expect a show filled with hits and a setlist to lean heavily on those two releases.\n\nFont — Monday at PhilaMOCA\n\nAustin quintet Font creates driving music of sampled stabs, dance beats and euphoric choruses built on frontman Thom Waddill’s lyrics and electric-shock dance. The singer’s writing begins with rhythm, emotion and sound rather than subject. He loops the music, hits record, dances around and sings nonsense until a vocal part sticks. Then, he fills in the syllables as quickly as he can with culled lines from nonsense poems, scribbled phrases and whatever occurs to him in the moment of movement and singing. More structured in a live setting, the Font show will still be a wild one to witness.\n\nBrainstory — Wednesday, July 17, at The Abbey\n\nBrainstory is the psychedelic soul trio from Southern California whose new full-length album, “Sounds Good,” was released this past spring. Comprised of Kevin and Tony Martin, brothers by blood, and Eric Hagstrom, a brother through their music and long-term friendship. Their initial connection was rooted in the heady mixture of jazz performance-focused music school and the grind of playing local shows, but their bond has been strengthened through countless hours on the road touring and spending so much time in the studio. The new album lives up to its title, and is just the first in what will likely be a number of big steps forward, which includes the Harrisburg show.\n\nSoundcheck\n\n• Third Eye Blind: “Box of Bones”\n\n• Paula Cole: “Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?”\n\n• John Lodge: “Tuesday Afternoon (Forever Afternoon)”\n\n• The Moody Blues: “Nights in White Satin”\n\n• Christopher Cross: “Sailing”\n\n• The Pretenders: “Middle of the Road”\n\n• Font: “Sentence I”\n\n• Brainstory: “Xfaded”"
