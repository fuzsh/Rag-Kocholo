        "text": "Singer, songwriter, record producer – Paula Cole is an artist who has charted her own course.\n\nA jazz singer turned pop star, Cole, who’ll perform Sunday at Cotuit Center for the Arts, first gained recognition in 1993, when Peter Gabriel – after hearing her not-yet-released debut album “Harbinger” – invited her to replace Sinead O’Connor on his “Secret World Live” tour.\n\nFour years later, Cole reached star status with “This Fire.” The self-produced album, which included the hit singles “Where Have all the Cowboys Gone” and “I Don’t Want to Wait,” went double platinum and earned Cole a Grammy Award for best new artist plus six additional Grammy nominations.\n\nFrom there, her career continued in high gear, but after a few years, Cole had had her fill of the pop-star life and its demands. She walked away from the music business to raise her daughter.\n\n“I needed to let go,” Cole says in a phone interview. “I didn’t enter music to be a star. I entered it because I must. It’s my living language, it’s my expression on the truth, it’s my truth-seeking and I need great flexibility. I need to shed skins periodically through my career.”\n\nCole says her return to music in 2007 was prompted, in part, by a greater stability in her life.\n\n“Things settled down and I was more grounded in my personal life. I had a seven-year hiatus in the music business, so I missed it. I missed the creative expression. I missed my fans. I missed making music live. I just needed (music). It was an awfully long time to go without singing.”\n\nCole notes, though, that her time away was all for the best. “I’m a better human being for that and I make better music now. My voice is in better shape than ever,” she says.\n\nSince her return, Cole has recorded seven albums. Her most recent recording, 2017’s “Ballads,” is a collection of pop, contemporary folk and Americana classics done in a jazz manner.\n\nCole says the jazz album – which includes songs by artists as diverse as Billie Holiday, Bobby Gentry, John Coltrane and Bob Dylan – is one she’s always wanted to make.\n\n“It’s been on my bucket list for decades. I started as a jazz singer,” says Cole, who turned down earlier offers to record a jazz album because they weren’t in keeping with her concepts.\n\n“Ballads,” is not just a fulfillment of Cole’s desire to produce and record a jazz album, it’s also a tribute to her father, Jim Cole.\n\n“(Groundbreaking psychiatrist) Carl Jung says the primary influence on our lives is the unfinished hopes and dreams of our parents, and this is never more apparent than in my ‘Ballads’ project,” Cole says.\n\n“I needed to create this to honor my dad. He was a professional musician very briefly, in his 20s. He played bass in a polka band. He was on albums and I would find them as a girl when I would wander over to the record player. He left music in order to support the family,” Cole says.\n\n“I grew up hearing my father sing so many American classics in the living room, just out of pure joy. So, I received a wonderful musical education from him, he would mix genres. So, to me, a Bobby Gentry song next to a Duke Ellington song next to a Bob Dylan song next to an old folk Americana song are all American classics.”\n\nCole says her career itself is her way of honoring not only her father, but her mother, Stephanie Cole, a visual artist, as well as her great-grandmother, Charlotte, whom Cole describes as being “a brilliant pianist.”\n\n“My family is definitely a part of all my music. I’m an autobiographical writer, primarily,” she says.\n\nCole, whose next recording will be an album of original material, approaches her music with the knowledge of someone who has seen the pluses and minuses of stardom. Looking back on the past 25 years has given Cole a philosophical perspective on the highs and lows of a musical career.\n\n“People forget, most people forget, so, never take yourself too seriously with success or failure,” Cole says. “There is a middle path.”\n\nWhat: “An Evening with Paula Cole\"\n\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Sunday\n\nWhere: Cotuit Center for the Arts, 4404 Route 28\n\nTickets: $55, $50 for balcony seating, $5 discount for members, $2 discount for seniors and veterans.\n\nReservations and information: artsonthecape.org/explore/an-evening-with-paula-cole, 508-428-0669\n\nIf you go"
