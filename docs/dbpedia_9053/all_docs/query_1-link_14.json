She was offered a record deal by a jazz label, but decided to turn it down.[1]\n\nRecording career[edit][]\n\nCole got her first big professional break when she was invited to perform on Peter Gabriel's 1993-1994 Secret World Live tour. Shortly after this, she was signed on with her first record company Imago Records. Through this record company, she released her first album Harbinger in 1994. Within that year of Harbinger's release, Imago Records went out of business. In 1995, she was signed on to Warner Bros. Records. The record company reissued Harbinger in the Autumn of 1995.\n\nHarbinger[edit][]\n\nMain article: Harbinger (Paula Cole album)\n\nCole released her debut album, Harbinger, in 1994 with Imago Records. She appeared with Melissa Etheridge to sing a duet on VH1 though she was not well known at the time.\n\nHarbinger featured songs dwelling on Cole's personal thoughts on discrimination and unhappiness.[citation needed] The songs were musically lush but driven and bleak. The accompanying artwork featured photographs of Cole with a boyishly short haircut, wearing loose fitting black sweatclothes, combat boots and nose ring. The Imago label folded and promotion of Harbinger was limited, affecting its sales.[citation needed] A single, \"I Am So Ordinary\", was released with a black and white video that reflected the album's artwork.\n\nPeter Gabriel's Secret World Tour[edit][]\n\nPrior to the release of Harbinger, Cole joined the two last legs of Peter Gabriel's 1993-94 Secret World tour.[3] She replaced Sinead O'Connor who left the tour partway through.[4] A video of the tour was released as Secret World Live, with Cole covering all the primary female vocals and featured in duets with Gabriel, especially the song \"Don't Give Up\" on which she sang the part that Kate Bush recorded with Gabriel in 1986. The film received the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video.[5] Cole was also the main female vocalist on Secret World Live, the audio album documenting the tour.\n\nThe tour gave Cole international exposure as well as experience performing on a large stage.[6]\n\nThis Fire[edit][]\n\nMain article: This Fire (album)\n\nIn late 1996, Cole released her second album on Warner Bros. Records, This Fire, which was entirely self-produced. The album's debut single, \"Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?\", became an instant smash radio (reaching #8 on Billboard magazine's pop chart) and MTV hit. The follow-up single \"I Don't Want to Wait\" was a #11 pop hit single, its popularity in part due to its usage as the theme song for the hit teen drama series Dawson's Creek.[7] The single \"Me\" (#35) was also released. The title \"Hush, Hush, Hush\", a duet with Peter Gabriel, talks about AIDS and about a young man dying in his father's comforting arms. \"Feelin' Love\" was a single that was included on the soundtrack to City of Angels.\n\nCole toured with Sarah McLachlan's Lilith Fair. Cole was nominated for several Grammy Awards in 1997. Among them was \"Producer of the Year\" (Cole was the third woman to ever be nominated in this category after Janet Jackson in 1990 and Mariah Carey in 1992); she did not win, but she did go on to win \"Best New Artist\" that same year.[8]\n\nAmen[edit][]\n\nMain article: Amen (Paula Cole album)\n\nCole took a hiatus to have and begin raising her daughter Sky. In 1999 Cole released Amen with the newly formed \"Paula Cole Band\". The album's debut single \"I Believe In Love\" was initially not a success but was remixed by producer Jonathan Peters into a successful dance song. The album which had guest appearances by DJ Premier and long-time Cole fan Tionne Watkins featured some R&B and hip-hop influences but failed to match the success of This Fire. A fourth album was recorded with Hugh Padgham but the label refused to release it; in 2005 Cole uploaded one of the tracks, \"Singing Out My Life\", to her own website to get her sound out there. She also recorded a song called \"It's My Life\" during these sessions, which can be heard in Mercury automobile commercials. Cole also made a home recording of a politically charged \"country-esque\" song called \"My Hero Mr. President\". [2] [3]\n\nCourage[edit][]\n\nMain article: Courage (Paula Cole album)\n\nCole returned in June 2007 with her fourth studio album Courage, which was released on Decca Records and produced by Bobby Colomby at the Capitol Studios in Hollywood.\n\nIthaca[edit][]\n\nMain article: Ithaca (Paula Cole album)\n\nCole's fifth studio album, Ithaca, was released September 21, 2010. She wrote and co-produced all of the songs on the album. Cole says it \"represents that inner fortitude and the journey I've been on.\"[9]\n\nRaven[edit][]\n\nRaven is Cole's sixth studio album. It was funded by a Kickstarter campaign which ran from September 22, 2012 to October 29, 2012 and raised $75,258.[10] The album was released on April 23, 2013 on her 675 label. Cole wrote the 11 songs on the album including two from early in her career, \"Imaginary Man\" and \"Manitoba\". Her mother had saved these songs on cassette tapes.[11] Most of the album was recorded in one week at a barn in Massachusetts. The musicians included co-producer/drummer Ben Wittman, guitarist Kevin Barry and bassist Tony Levin. She has worked with Wittman and Barry since she was 19.[11]\n\nInstruments[edit][]\n\nIn addition to singing, Cole performs on numerous instruments, including her main instrument, piano, as well as a Roland Juno synthesizer, Juno bass, tube Wurlitzer, harmonium, beat boxing vocals, toyxylophone, didjeridoo, clarinet, Fender Rhodes electric piano, Rhodes bass, Moog synthesizer, and low tuned-electric guitar in different songs.\n\nCurrent status[edit][]\n\nCole performed a two-hour set at Berklee Performance Center in Boston, Massachusetts on February 16, 2007 during which she debuted several songs from her then yet to be released fourth studio album,Courage. The set began with a solo piano version of \"Where Have All the Cowboys Gone\" which was replayed toward the end of the concert by the full band. Her performance was reviewed favorably in The Boston Globe on February 19, 2007.[12] In March 2007, her official myspace previewed three new songs from Courage, which include \"Comin' Down\", \"El Greco\", and the album's first single entitled \"14\".\n\nOn July 10, 2007 Cole sang \"God Bless America\" during the seventh-inning stretch of the 2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.[13][14] In August 2007, Cole toured with Mandy Moore, playing mid-size venues in the western United States.\n\nOn June 17, 2008 she sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at Game 6 of the NBA Finals in Boston.[15] In August 2008 and 2009, Cole continued to tour and promote her CD Courage.\n\nSince 2013, Cole has been on the voice faculty at Berklee College of Music while continuing an active performing career.\n\nDiscography[edit][]\n\nStudio albums[edit][]\n\nTitle Details Peak chart\n\npositions\n\nCertifications[16] US\n\n[17]\n\nNZ\n\n[18]\n\nUK\n\n[19]\n\nHarbinger\n\nRelease date: July 19, 1994\n\nLabel: Imago\n\nFormats: CD, cassette\n\n— — —\n\nUS Sales: 150,000[20]\n\nThis Fire\n\nRelease date: October 15, 1996\n\nLabel: Imago / Warner Bros.\n\nFormats: CD, cassette\n\n20 26 60\n\nUS: 2x Platinum\n\nAmen\n\nRelease date: September 28, 1999\n\nLabel: Imago / Warner Bros.\n\nFormats: CD, cassette\n\n97 — —\n\nUS Sales: 116,000[20]\n\nCourage\n\nRelease date: June 12, 2007\n\nLabel: Decca\n\nFormats: CD, music download\n\n163 — — Ithaca\n\nRelease date: September 21, 2010\n\nLabel: Decca\n\nFormats: CD, music download\n\n— — — Raven\n\nRelease date: April 23, 2013\n\nLabel: 675 Records / United For Opportunity\n\nFormats: CD, Digital Download\n\n— — — \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n\nCompilation albums[edit][]\n\nTitle Details Greatest Hits: Postcards from East Oceanside\n\nRelease date: June 6, 2006\n\nLabel: Warner Bros. / Rhino\n\nFormats: CD, music download\n\nSingles[edit][]\n\nYear Single Peak chart positions Album US\n\n[21]\n\nUS AC\n\n[22]\n\nUS Adult\n\n[23][24]\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_Songs US\n\nAlt] [25]\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Dance_Club_Songs US\n\nDance] [26]\n\nUS Pop\n\n[27]\n\nAUS\n\n[28]\n\nCAN\n\n[29]\n\nUK\n\n[30]\n\n1997 \"Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?\" 8 27 4 32 10 5 32 7 15 This Fire \"I Don't Want to Wait\" 11 3 1 — — 5 27 5 43 1998 \"Me\" — — 17 — — 25 — 20 — 1999 \"I Believe in Love\" — — 22 — 18 39 — 37 — Amen 2000 \"Be Somebody\" — — — — — — — — — \"Amen\" — — — — — — — — — 2007 \"14\" — — — — — — — — — Courage \"Coming Down\" — — — — — — — — — 2010 \"Music in Me\" — — — — — — — — — Ithaca 2013 \"Eloise\" — — — — — — — — — Raven \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n\nAwards and nominations[edit][]"
