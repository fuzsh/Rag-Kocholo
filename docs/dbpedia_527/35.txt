Network Rail has announced plans to close Newhaven Marine rail station, 14 years after it was first deemed "unsafe".

Passenger services were suspended in 2006 at the station following safety concerns over the "dangerous condition of the station canopy". However the station has remained open to freight trains since.

Both the canopy and the station building were demolished in 2017 and Network Rail had considered turning the station into a larger rail freight facility.

However, after carrying out a costing assessment, Network Rail concluded that the benefit cost ratio of improving the station was not value for money.

Instead, Network Rail believes that closing the station will save Â£1.9M which will be used to regenerate the wider East Sussex port area.

The money will instead be used to push ahead with the Newhaven Port Access Road (NPAR), which will provide greater connectivity between the East Sussex town and Kent. The development is set to provide 456 new jobs to the town.

The station is one of three in the port town, which used to be the base for a popular sea route to Dieppe, France. It also had a link to London Victoria. However, since the launch of the Eurostar tunnel in 1994, the harbour has mainly been used for freight.
