        "text": "BEGINNER’S GUIDE TO RAILROAD SIGNALS: HOW TO READ US TRAIN SIGNALS\n\nRailroad signals play a crucial role in the safety of train transit. Just like normal highway traffic lights, railroad signals direct the engineman on how to proceed. But these signals are much more complex than normal traffic lights.\n\nThis guide breaks down US Railroad signals into three sections: category, type, and how to read. We’ve also included a short glossary of terms to help you understand how to read the signals.\n\nRailroad Signal Categories & Their Function\n\nRailroad signals are categorized into two levels: Permissive and Absolute. Both serve a specific function of either protection or control.\n\nPermissive Signals\n\nPermissive signals use the automatic block signal system to alert train operators there is an obstruction on the tracks ahead. They are considered “permissive” because their function is to protect, not control.\n\nThis means that when the automatic block signal is triggered, the train must come to a complete stop. After the stop, they can continue forward at a slower speed, commonly referred to as the “restricted speed.”\n\nThe logic is that once the train operator is alerted of the obstruction, they can continue along the track if there is clear visibility ahead. In this scenario, they would have ample time to stop the train before a collision because they’re traveling at a restricted speed.\n\nAbsolute Signals\n\nAn absolute signal occurs at any point of the track where there’s an interruption. What is considered an interruption? An interruption could be:\n\nA switch or crossing from one track or route to another\n\nA drawbridge or any other point where the track separates\n\nAny situation where one train could come in too close contact with another\n\nAbsolute signals are sometimes also known as “interlocking plant signals,” or more commonly today, “control points.” They received the name because these signals are typically operated in a control center by members of the Centralized Traffic Control (CTC).\n\nThey are considered “absolute” because their function is to control. When a train reaches the absolute signal, it must come to a complete stop and stay stopped until the signal indicates it’s safe to proceed. Hence, they’ve been coined with the nickname “stop and stay” blocks.\n\nUnderstanding Railroad Signals: The Terminology\n\nTo understand the types of railroad signals that exist and how to read them, there are a few terms that will be helpful to know:\n\nSignal head: the part of the railroad signal where the visual direction is displayed.\n\nAspect: the visual appearance of a signal at a given time, what the train operators see.\n\nWhen the lights are displayed green, the aspect is “green.”\n\nAspect name: a formal version of the aspect, and an informal version of the indication; it’s the “short form” version of what the aspect means.\n\nIf the aspect is “green,” the aspect name is “clear.”\n\nIndication: the formal mandate the aspect is displaying.\n\nIf the aspect is “green” and the aspect name is “clear,” the indication is “proceed not exceeding normal speed.”\n\nRule: the formal provision as defined by the Northeast Operating Rules Advisory Committee (NORAC)\n\nIt includes the aspect, aspect name, and indication.\n\nWant to learn some more railroad terms? Check out our blog, “Railroad Terms Glossary.”\n\nAspects, Aspect Names, & Indications\n\nThe aspects, aspect names, and indications all work together to instruct the engineman how to proceed. The indication can’t be determined without the aspect name, and the aspect name can’t be determined without the aspect.\n\nIn the chart below, we’ve listed out the 4 possible aspects and how they impact the aspect names and indications:\n\nAspects Aspect Names Indication Green Clear Proceed at a normal speed. Red Stop Stop and stay stopped until instructed to proceed. Yellow Approach or caution The current stretch is clear but be prepared to stop at the next signal. Lunar or lunar white Restricted speed Proceed at a restricted speed.\n\n5 Types Of Railroad Signals\n\nNow that we’ve determined the overarching categories of railroad signals and defined some of the important terminologies, it’s time to jump into the types of railroad signals. For this guide, we’re only going to include the signals that are used by train operators in the US.\n\n1. Semaphore Signals\n\nThe semaphore was the first railroad signal to use electricity. The original semaphores used a two-position arm/blade to alert train operators if they must stop and stay (horizontal position), or could stop and proceed with caution (vertical position).\n\nThey went through several iterations over time to improve their signaling capabilities but eventually fell out of popular use when new railroad signals were developed. By now, most semaphores have been replaced by modern railroad signals.\n\nIf you see one still in use today along the US railroad, it’s likely a three-position upper-quadrant semaphore. They use the same arm/blade system but with 3 positions and a 3-color light system to direct traffic.\n\nReading A Semaphore Signal\n\nTo read semaphores, you must take note of the position of the blade and the color of the light to determine if the route is safe. Here is a simple breakdown of how the position and colors direct train operators:\n\nWhen the blade is vertical, the light is green and the train can proceed.\n\nWhen the blade is at an angle, the light is yellow and the train can approach, but at a restricted speed.\n\nWhen the blade is horizontal, the light is red and the train must stop and stay.\n\n2. Color Light Signals\n\nColor lights are probably the most common signals along the railroad. As many companies started to standardize the railroad signals across the US, color lights became a straightforward method.\n\nThese railroad signals have 3 colored lenses arranged vertically like normal highway traffic lights. Unlike traffic lights, color lights are positioned with green at the top, yellow in the middle, and red at the bottom.\n\nAnother popular form of color lights is tri-light signals. Tri-lights use the 3-color system to flash red, yellow, or green, but they’re positioned in a triangle on a circular background instead of a traffic head.\n\nReading Color Light Signals\n\nOn both signal heads, the color of the lights informs operators how to proceed. In all cases,\n\nGreen indicates clear, the train can proceed.\n\nYellow indicates approach, but at a restricted speed. Be prepared to stop at the next signal.\n\nRed indicates stop, the block is currently occupied.\n\n3. Color Light Signals\n\nSearchlights are unique signals because they only use a single lamp, but they can still flash aspects of green, yellow, and red using rotating lenses. They were developed as an alternative to traditional color light signals and became popular in the 1920s because of their simple, clean appearance.\n\nEventually, searchlights fell out of popularity because they required frequent — and expensive — maintenance. According to the Code of Federal Regulations, searchlights need to be inspected once every 6 months, and repairing any issues with the lenses is costly, so like semaphores, searchlights are starting to be replaced by other railroad signals.\n\nHow To Read Searchlight Signals\n\nThough there’s only a single bulb, the rotating lenses allow searchlight signals to use the 3-aspect color signaling. Therefore, the aspect names and indications read the same as color lights.\n\nSearchlight signal indications:"
