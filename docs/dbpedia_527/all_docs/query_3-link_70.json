        "text": "Create a project\n\nIn ArcGIS Pro, maps and data are organized in a project. Before you begin your map, you'll create a project. You can complete the tutorial using an ArcGIS Online account or an ArcGIS Enterprise account, as long as ArcGIS Pro is licensed in your portal.\n\nStart ArcGIS Pro. If prompted, sign in using your licensed ArcGIS organizational account.\n\nIf you don't have access to ArcGIS Pro or an ArcGIS organizational account, see options for software access.\n\nUnder New Project, click Map.\n\nThe New Project window appears. By default, projects are saved in a new folder. To save them in an existing folder, uncheck Create a new folder for this project and browse to the folder.\n\nFor Name, delete the existing text and type Singapore Tourism. Leave Location unchanged and confirm that Create a folder for this project is checked.\n\nYour default location may differ from the example image. Typically, projects are saved in the ArcGIS folder that was created when you installed ArcGIS Pro.\n\nClick OK.\n\nThe project is created with a map showing the world. In ArcGIS Pro, maps are composed of layers of geographic data. For now, the only layer is the basemap, which provides reference information such as national boundaries and water bodies.\n\nDepending on your ArcGIS organization's settings, your map may have a different default extent and basemap, so it may look different than the example image.\n\nOn either side of the map are panes. By default, the Contents and Catalog panes are open, although other panes may be open if you've used ArcGIS Pro before. The Contents pane lists the layers on the map and the Catalog pane lists all files associated with the project.\n\nAbove the map is the ribbon. The ribbon contains several tabs, each with multiple buttons. These buttons may affect map navigation, change the map's appearance, or open windows or panes with more functionality.\n\nTip:\n\nYou can rearrange panes by dragging their title and docking them in new locations. You can also resize panes by dragging their edges. To return to the default pane arrangement, click the View tab. In the Windows group, click Reset Panes and choose Reset Panes for Mapping. Throughout this tutorial, feel free to arrange the panes and views.\n\nStyle the map\n\nWhile navigating the map, you may have noticed that some of the data layers are difficult to see. The rail lines, for instance, are white and often blend into the other information on the map.\n\nThe information about streets, water bodies, and buildings comes from the basemap. A basemap provides reference information that contextualizes your data. ArcGIS Pro includes several basemap layers, with the default being World Topographic Map. (Depending on your ArcGIS organization's settings, you may have a different default basemap.)\n\nYou'll change the basemap to one that emphasizes your data. A darker basemap will make the white rail lines appear more clearly.\n\nOn the Map tab, in the Layer group, click Basemap and choose Dark Gray Canvas.\n\nThe basemap changes.\n\nWith this basemap, the rail lines stand out more. Unlike the Topographic basemap, this basemap contains two layers. One of these layers, Dark Gray Reference, contains text that labels some areas. This text isn't necessary for your map's purpose and may obscure some features, so you'll turn it off.\n\nIn the Contents pane, uncheck the Dark Gray Reference check box.\n\nThe layer no longer appears on your map. (To make the reference information reappear, click the check box again.)\n\nThe tourist attractions are displayed on the map as small points that don't stand out well. Because the attractions are meant to be a focal point of the map, you'll change the way they appear.\n\nIn the Contents pane, click the Tourist Attractions layer symbol.\n\nThe Symbology pane appears. Symbology defines a layer's appearance. You can choose from a gallery of default symbols or customize a symbol.\n\nIn the Symbology - Tourist Attractions pane, on the Gallery tab, search for Tear Pin. In the list of results, click the largest Tear Pin 1 (40%) symbol.\n\nThe symbols for tourist attractions change to the chosen symbol. The tear pin symbol helps convey that the tourist attractions are places of interest. The 40% indicates that the symbol is 40 percent transparent, which is useful in case the symbols obscure parts of the map.\n\nYou can make the symbols stand out more by adding an outline and increasing the symbol size.\n\nClick Properties.\n\nClick the Layers tab.\n\nFor Outline color, choose Arctic White.\n\nTip:\n\nTo see a color's name in the color picker, point to it.\n\nChange Outline width to 0.7 pt. Change Size to 22 pt.\n\nAt the bottom of the pane, click Apply.\n\nThe new symbology is applied to the layer.\n\nNow the tourist attractions stand out more clearly, without obscuring other map features.\n\nIf your ArcGIS account uses an ArcGIS Enterprise portal and you downloaded the layer data, the rail lines and rail stations may have different symbols than those shown in the example images. To change the rail lines symbol to match the example images, click its symbol to open the Symbology pane. On the Properties tab, on the Layers tab, change Color to Arctic White. To change the rail stations symbol, open its Symbology pane. On the Properties tab, on the Symbol tab, change Color to Gray 80%, Outline color to Black, and Outline width to 1.2 pt.\n\nClose the Symbology pane and save the project.\n\nDetermine proximity\n\nThe tourism agency wants its brochure to indicate the closest rail station to each tourist attraction. Measuring the distance between each tourist attraction and rail station one by one would take a lot of time, so you'll automate the process by running a geoprocessing tool to gather all the information into a single layer.\n\nA geoprocessing tool performs an operation on a dataset. In ArcGIS Pro, there are hundreds of geoprocessing tools, encompassing a wide variety of operations. You'll use the Spatial Join tool, which combines information from two feature classes based on their spatial relationship. You'll use this tool to determine the closest rail station to each tourist attraction.\n\nOn the ribbon, click the Analysis tab. In the Geoprocessing group, click Tools.\n\nThe Geoprocessing pane appears.\n\nIn the Geoprocessing pane, in the search bar, type Spatial Join. In the list of results, click the Spatial Join tool.\n\nThe Spatial Join tool appears. Most geoprocessing tools have parameters you can set to change the tool's result. For this tool, you'll first choose the feature layers to join.\n\nFor Target Features, choose Tourist Attractions. For Join Features, choose Rail Stations.\n\nTip:\n\nTo learn more about any parameter, point to the parameter. Then, point to the information button that appears.\n\nNext, you'll set the Output Feature Class parameter. Many geoprocessing tools create an output layer, leaving the original layers unchanged.\n\nBy default, output layers are saved in a folder specialized for geographic data, called a geodatabase, that was created when you created the project. You'll leave the output location unchanged, but you'll change the output name.\n\nFor Output Feature Class, click the text box. Replace the text with Tourist_Attractions_Join.\n\nYou'll leave the Join one to one operation unchanged. This operation ensures that each tourist attraction is joined to only one rail station, which is ideal because you only want to know the single closest station.\n\nNext, you'll set the Match Option parameter. This parameter determines the spatial relationship between the features to be joined.\n\nFor Match Option, choose Closest.\n\nBelow the visible parameters, expand Fields.\n\nThe Field Map parameter determines which attributes from each input feature class are kept in the output feature class. You'll learn more about attributes later. For now, you'll only remove the Shape__Area and Shape__Length fields, because you're not interested in the size and shape of the features on the map. The rest of the fields provide useful context for the user.\n\nIn the Fields column, point to Shape__Area and click the Remove button.\n\nRemove the Shape__Length field.\n\nYou've set all the parameters you need. Based on the parameters you've chosen, the tool will run an operation that combines information from each tourist attraction with information from its closest rail station.\n\nClick Run.\n\nThe tool runs. When it finishes, a new layer, Tourist_Attractions_Join, is added to the map and the Contents pane. The new layer looks similar to the original Tourist Attractions layer; however, the geoprocessing tool changed the layer's attributes.\n\nAttributes are information associated with each feature in a feature layer. They may include the feature's name, address, area, or many other types of information. You can view a layer's attributes by opening its attribute table.\n\nIn the Contents pane, right-click Tourist_Attractions_Join and choose Attribute Table.\n\nThe attribute table opens.\n\nEach row of the table represents a single feature on the map and each column is a field of information. In this table, the first row corresponds to a feature named Chinatown Heritage Centre on 48 Pagoda Street.\n\nThe Object ID field contains a unique ID number for each feature.\n\nThe TARGET_FID field refers to the target features (Tourist Attractions) we selected for the spatial join.\n\nThe Join_Count field indicates the number of join features that match each target feature.\n\nTip:\n\nYou can resize the table by dragging the handle at the top of the table.\n\nIf necessary, scroll until you see the last few fields.\n\nThe table has two fields titled Name. While the first Name field is the name of the tourist attraction, the second Name field is the name of the closest rail station. The second Name field was added to the table after you ran the Spatial Join tool.\n\nThe Type field was also added by the Spatial Join tool. It indicates whether the closest station is part of the Massive Rapid Transit (MRT), Light Rail Transit (LRT), or Circle Line (CCL) system. You can determine the fields the tool added by opening the attribute table for the original Tourist Attractions layer and comparing.\n\nClose the table.\n\nYou no longer need the original Tourist Attractions layer, so you'll remove it.\n\nIn the Contents pane, right-click the Tourist Attractions layer and choose Remove.\n\nThe layer is removed. You'll also rename the new layer so that its name matches the one you removed.\n\nClick the Tourist_Attractions_Join layer name to select it. Click it again to make the layer name editable.\n\nChange the name to Tourist Attractions and press Enter.\n\nTip:\n\nAnother way to change the layer name is to double-click it to open its Layer Properties window. On the General tab, change the name. Click OK.\n\nSave the project.\n\nExport a table\n\nIf tourists accessed your map in ArcGIS Pro or as an interactive web map in ArcGIS Online, they could open the attribute table like you did to find the closest station to each attraction. However, this map will be printed in brochures, so users won't have that ability.\n\nTo accompany the map, the tourism agency plans to print key information from the attribute table in the brochure. You'll export the attribute table to a plain text file so the agency can copy the necessary data into the brochure design.\n\nIn the Contents pane, right-click Tourist Attractions, point to Data, and choose Export Table.\n\nThe Export Table window appears. This tool converts a layer's attribute table to a new file format. The Tourist Attractions layer is already selected for the Input Table parameter.\n\nThe default output location is the geodatabase that was created with the project, Singapore Tourism.gdb. However, a text file cannot be stored in a geodatabase. You'll change the output location to one appropriate for the data you're exporting.\n\nFor Output Table, click the Browse button.\n\nThe Output Table window appears.\n\nIn the Output Table window, click Folders and double-click the Singapore Tourism folder.\n\nFor Name, type Tourist_Attractions.txt. (Be sure to include the .txt extension.)\n\nIf you change the output location to a geodatabase, the tool will not run correctly; choose a location other than the default location.\n\nClick Save.\n\nTip:\n\nYou can also export the table to a comma-separated values file using the .csv extension or a dBase database file using the .dBF extension.\n\nAs with the Spatial Join tool, the Export Table tool includes the option to remove fields from the output table. You'll remove the Join_Count and TARGET_FID fields, which don't provide necessary information for your purposes.\n\nExpand Fields.\n\nFor Field Map, point to Join_Count and click the Remove button. Remove the TARGET_FID field.\n\nClick OK.\n\nThe tool runs and the table is exported. (You can confirm it was exported successfully by checking the output location you chose). Additionally, the exported table is added to the Contents pane under the Standalone Tables heading . You don't need the table in the project, so you'll remove it.\n\nIn the Contents pane, right-click Tourist_Attractions.txt and choose Remove.\n\nClose the Geoprocessing pane and save the project.\n\nLabel features\n\nWith the exported table, the tourism agency can add the attribute information to the brochure as textual information. However, tourists using the brochure won't be able to tell which points on the map correspond to which tourist location.\n\nTo make the map more useful, you'll label the tourist attractions. Labels are textual information that appear on a map to help users understand the data.\n\nIn the Contents pane, click the Tourist Attractions layer to select it.\n\nThe Labeling tab becomes available. This tab is a contextual tab, meaning it only appears when it's relevant to the data you're working with.\n\nOn the ribbon, click the Labeling tab. In the Layer group, click the Label button.\n\nLabels are enabled for the layer. By default, each tourist attraction is labeled with its name. Because there are so many attractions, however, the labels clutter the map and aren't easy to read.\n\nTo make the map easy to read, you'll label attractions using their unique ID number instead.\n\nIn the Label Class group, for Field, choose Object ID. (You may need to scroll to see the correct option.)\n\nThe labels on the map change from long names to smaller numbers. While the numbers don't immediately identify each attraction, the brochure can include the IDs with the table data to help users identify them.\n\nThe labels have small, dark text that doesn't show up well on the dark basemap. Additionally, the position of the labels doesn't always make it clear which number corresponds to which attraction. You'll change the appearance and position of the labels to make them clearer.\n\nIn the Text Symbol group, change the text symbol font size to 8 and the color to Arctic White.\n\nIn the Label Placement group, click Centered Point.\n\nThe labels are updated on the map.\n\nThese labels are improved, but there are still a few small problems. First, for some tourist attractions, no labels appear at certain zoom extents. By default, labels are not displayed if they are too close together, to prevent overlapping. Additionally, the labels will look better if they were located more centrally in the pin symbol. You'll make changes to solve both of these problems.\n\nIn the Label Placement group, click the Label Placement Properties button.\n\nThe Label Class - Tourist Attractions pane appears. This pane has advanced labeling options.\n\nClick the Conflict resolution tab.\n\nExpand the Unplaced labels section and check Never remove (place overlapping).\n\nNow, no labels are removed from the map due to overlapping. Next, you'll adjust the label position so that it is located more centrally within each pin symbol.\n\nClick the Symbol tab.\n\nOn the General tab, collapse Appearance and expand Position section. Change Offset Y to 2 pt.\n\nClick Apply.\n\nThe labels move up slightly, positioning them in the center of the pin symbols.\n\nWhile some of the labels slightly overlap other pin symbols, they're all generally clear to read. In conjunction with table data published in the brochure, tourists will be able to identify every attraction on the map.\n\nClose the Label Class - Tourist Attractions pane and save the project.\n\nIt may also be useful to users if the rail stations were labeled. For the purposes of this tutorial, you won't label them, but you can try creating your own labels. What kind of appearance do your labels need to be legible on the map?\n\nBefore you continue, you'll rename your map to something more descriptive. By default, its name is Map.\n\nIn the Contents pane, double-click Map.\n\nThe Map Properties pane appears.\n\nOn the General tab, for Name, type Central Business District.\n\nClick OK.\n\nThe map is renamed.\n\nCreate a layout\n\nYour map is finished. All that remains is to export it to a form that can be printed in the brochure. To prepare your map for printing, you'll create a page layout. A layout is a collection of map elements organized on a virtual page. It defines how your map will look when it's printed.\n\nYou can design a layout from scratch, but ArcGIS Pro also includes several layout templates. You'll use a template and modify a few layout elements.\n\nOn the ribbon, click the Insert tab and click the Import Layout button.\n\nA list of available templates appears. A simple layout is best, as you want the emphasis to be on the map.\n\nChoose the Title Bar Letter Landscape layout.\n\nIf you do not see a list of available templates, you can download and import the layout template used in this tutorial.\n\nThe layout opens as a new view. (You can switch between the map view and the layout view using the tabs above the view.)\n\nThis layout includes a title, a legend, and a scale bar. All of the layout's elements are listed in the Contents pane. Additionally, the ribbon now displays tabs relevant to interacting with the layout.\n\nBy default, the template you chose contains a map of Columbus, Ohio. You'll update the layout's map frame to use your map of Singapore.\n\nIn the Contents pane, double-click Map Frame.\n\nThe Map Frame pane appears.\n\nUnder Options, for Map Frame, choose Central Business District.\n\nThe map in the layout changes. However, the map is zoomed to a worldwide extent, and Singapore is not visible. The map extent and the layout extent are independent.\n\nYou'll use the bookmark you created earlier to navigate to your desired map extent.\n\nOn the ribbon, click the Layout tab. In the Map group, click Bookmarks and choose the Central Business District bookmark.\n\nThe map extent updates to your area of interest.\n\nTip:\n\nTo pan or zoom the map to a different extent in the layout, in the Map group, click Activate. Once activated, you can navigate the map normally. When you've changed the extent, click the Layout tab and click Close Activation.\n\nNext, you'll title the layout.\n\nIn the Contents pane, double-click Map Title.\n\nThe Map Title pane appears.\n\nUnder Options, for Text, delete the existing text and type Downtown Singapore. Click anywhere outside the text box.\n\nThe change is applied to the layout.\n\nYou'll also adjust the legend, which explains what all of the symbols on the map mean. The default legend has a white background, which means the white rail lines symbol doesn't show up well. You'll remove the background and adjust the legend's position.\n\nIn the Contents pane, double-click Legend.\n\nThe Legend pane appears. First, you'll change the legend text to white, so that it'll appear on the dark basemap when you remove the legend background.\n\nClick Text Symbol. Expand Appearance and change Color to Arctic White.\n\nClick Apply.\n\nNext, you'll modify the legend background so you can see the text.\n\nAt the top of the pane, click the Legend drop-down arrow and choose Background.\n\nFor Color, choose No color.\n\nClick Apply.\n\nThe legend's background is removed.\n\nIn the layout view, drag the legend so that it appears in the lower corner of the map. When you're finished, click anywhere in the layout view outside of the map to deselect the legend.\n\nThe scale bar is in the bottom corner, but difficult to see. Next, you'll remove the scale bar, which you don't need.\n\nIn the Contents pane, right-click Scale Bar and choose Delete.\n\nYour layout is complete.\n\nThe tourism agency will print this map image on the inside of the brochure. The back of the brochure will contain a list of the tourist attractions based on the table you exported. Ultimately, the brochure will help tourists find the closest rail station to each tourist attraction.\n\nOn the ribbon, click the Share tab. In the Output group, click the Export Layout button.\n\nThe Export Layout pane appears.\n\nIn the Export Layout pane, for File Type, choose your preferred image image file format. For Name, browse to your preferred output location and change the file name to Downtown Singapore.\n\nIn this tutorial, you created a map that showed popular tourist attractions in downtown Singapore. You created a project, navigated to the area of interest, and added data. You changed the way the map looked and analyzed the distance between tourist attractions and rail stations. Then, you created a layout and exported the map to an image file.\n\nThis tutorial was an introduction to ArcGIS Pro and covered only the basics of topics such as mapmaking and analysis.
