        "text": "The following pictures show one of the Newhaven Harbour locomotives (32670), the views are around 1960. The top picture shows Christ Church in the background, now the site of the police station, the white wooden lighthouse in the foreground started life at the harbour entrance back in the 1860’s and was relocated in the 1970’s to the entrance of Tideway School. This fragile structure stood proud at the top of Southdown Road for a couple of decades but became unsafe due to wood rot and was removed.\n\nThis section of track would have snaked it’s way behind the Riverside hall (seamens mission hut) and the Ark. This small but powerful Terrier is about to cross the old Victorian swing Bridge and make it’s way down towards the Station area as shown in the final picture. The Railway Hotel sign is just in view in the left of this photograph, this building and the row of terraced houses (Denton Terrace) behind the Inn were demolished in 1976 to make way for the Flyover."
