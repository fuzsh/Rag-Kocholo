        "text": "Railway station in East Sussex, England\n\nBishopstone Beach Halt was a railway station in East Sussex, England that was opened on 1 June 1864 and closed on 1 January 1942. The station was built on the Seaford Branch Line for residents of the Bishopstone and Tide Mills villages and located on the west side of Mill Drove. The company that operated the trains on opening was the London Brighton & South Coast Railway, later merged into the Southern Railway.\n\nReasons for construction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe station was built primarily for the 60-100 workers at the mills. After the mills closed 1883 it became used mainly by holiday passengers.[2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first name of the station was Bishopstone. It was closed in 1938 when a new Bishopstone station was built 0.6 miles (1 km) to the east, then reopened in 1939 as Bishopstone Beach Halt.\n\nPreceding station Historical railways Following station Newhaven Harbour\n\nLine open, station open Southern Railway\n\nSeaford Branch Line Bishopstone\n\nLine open, station open\n\nPresent day\n\n[edit]\n\nThe down platform remains intact with no track running through it (as the line beyond Newhaven Harbour was singled in 1975). The edge stones on the up platform have been removed, but the concrete support of the station sign is still in place. The station can no longer be visited by the public.[3]"
