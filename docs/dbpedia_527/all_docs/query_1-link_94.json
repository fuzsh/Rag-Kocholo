        "text": "@Al_G @rvdborgt\n\nThank you so much for your help so far. I have solved some of my problems but unfortunately I now seem to have a whole new lot.\n\n1. I believe the problem I was having with getting to Newhaven was that I entered ‘Newhaven Port’ instead of ‘Newhaven Town’. Because I am English I was able to work that out, but how do I cope if I am somewhere in the middle of Europe where there are 2 stations for one town and I don’t know which is which?\n\n2. I decided I wanted to travel to Newhaven on Sunday night to stay with a friend so I wouldn’t have to get up too early, but then when I tried to enter the journey from Victoria to Newhaven it asked me if this was my outbound journey, and I said yes, but then it wouldn’t let me add it to my pass. I think this may be because I activated my pass for the 3rd and Sunday is the 2nd, but this doesn’t matter as it’s very cheap to pay for this journey separately. The good news is I have booked my ferry! :)\n\n3. Because of the time I have to check-in to my hotel in Paris I might decide to break my journey in Rouen on Monday night, but I haven’t been able to confirm this yet, as I’m waiting to hear from the landlady. So now I have saved to ‘my trip’ both Dieppe to Paris and Dieppe to Rouen. If I add the wrong one to my pass, will I be able to delete it and then add the other one?\n\n4. To try and add a journey to my trip without doing anything irrevocable, I looked for the button to add one of the journeys to my pass from my trip, and I couldn’t find the button!!\n\nI hope you can help me some more, otherwise I will sink into total despair again.\n\nMany thanks, Gail"
