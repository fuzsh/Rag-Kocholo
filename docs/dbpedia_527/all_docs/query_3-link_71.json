        "text": "Michigan Central Station is opening its doors in just a few months after more than 30 years of vacancy.\n\nThe building announced its reopening this week, with a giant projection of “06-06-2024” appearing across its face Tuesday evening.\n\nConstructed in 1913, trains ran in and out of Michigan Central Station for nearly 75 years before its doors officially closed in 1988.\n\nThe 15-story building became a famous symbol of architectural ruin porn, symbolizing Detroit’s topple from an industry giant to a city on a pathway to bankruptcy.\n\nMore: Detroit train station was a place where memories were made\n\nThrowback: Once crown jewel, Detroit train station now symbol of ruin\n\nOwnership, past and present:\n\nThe Moroun family, who own the Ambassador Bridge along with thousands of properties across Detroit, purchased Michigan Central out of tax-foreclose in 1995.\n\nRenovation ideas for the building ranged from a casino to a world trade center, but instead, the building fell further into disrepair, with graffiti artists moving in and shattering the 1,000-window facade.\n\nFord Motor Co. paid $90 million for the building in 2018 and committed $740 million to rehabilitating the station and surrounding area.\n\nBuilding renovations\n\nDespite most of the building’s specific renovations being kept secret, the doors to the station have opened a few times during the construction process allowing for a sneak peek into Ford’s renovation process.\n\nMore than 20,000 people were able to witness Ford’s original renderings inside the station’s concourse during a sold-out tour in 2018.\n\nThe automotive company, which received more than $200 million in city tax breaks to finish the project, investigated the building’s original structure to preserve what was possible and ensure renovations were historically accurate.\n\nInitial plans for residential housing units on the top floors of the station have been scrapped in favor of a hotel − although Ford will first have to rezone the property, which currently is not permitted for a hotel.\n\nMore: Ford taps former factory worker to do painting at Detroit train station\n\nDuring a 2022 media tour, the Free Press learned of plans for a first-floor event space and 10 floors of office space along with the top three floors dedicated to a future 100 hotel rooms.\n\n\"What's going to be really cool is that this beautiful space will be completely restored and be open to the public,\" Executive Chairman Bill Ford told Freep in 2018. \"We'll have restaurants and coffee shops and bars and retail all going on down here. … We don't want to just be this corporate entity coming downtown. We want to be part of the fabric of Corktown.\"\n\nA carriage house behind the train station will serve as the home for the station’s legendary stolen clock, returned anonymously in 2018. And the tracks have been preserved in case the passenger rail makes a comeback, a possibility Amtrak began floating last November.\n\nSurrounding property improvements\n\nThe city completed a $6 million renovation of Roosevelt Park, the 13-acre greenspace along Michigan Avenue in the front of the station, in spring 2023. The new design prioritizes peditarian walkability and permanently closed the roads leading up to the station.\n\nMore: Ford receiving calls to return stolen Detroit train station property\n\nAlong with Michigan Central, Ford also purchased three buildings, the Book Depository, the Factory, and a former brass factory, and constructed a parking garage, the Bagely Mobility Hub, to create its technology district.\n\nAdjacent to Michigan Central, Ford completed renovations of the three-story Book Depository building in April 2023, remodeling the former 1930s U.S. Post Office and Detroit Public Schools warehouse into Newlab − a modern workspace focused on technology innovation.\n\nDesigned by famous architect Albert Kahn, the structure’s original first-floor atrium has been enlarged central atrium to extend through all three aboveground floors.\n\nMore: Boys & Girls Clubs of Southeastern Michigan moving headquarters to Detroit\n\nThe Factory at 1907 Michigan Ave., was built in 1907 and was once home to Chicago Hosiery and Detroit-Alaska Knitting Mills factories. After renovations in 2018, Ford moved more than 200 employees into the building dedicated to driverless technology initiatives.\n\nMore: Detroit touts first wireless-charging public road for electric vehicles in US"
