        "text": "The ECoS 50220 is already the second generation of our successful ECoS command station. With the latest ECoS command station, ESU continues to offer state-of-the-art digital technology combined with contemporary functional range and easy handling all this for a fair price-performance ratio.\n\nThe ECoS has - like most of the recent central stations - a large coloured display with high resolution. In combination with its ground-breaking and easily operated user interface and excellent contrast values of the coloured screen, ECoS reaches unprecedented ergonomics: unlike all the other central stations, the ECoS can be also operated without a stylus - all symbols and writings are hugely marked and clearly structured.\n\nECoS has 9 function keys per integrated cab. The light-, and function keys 1 to 8 show the current state of the function via LEDs.\n\nDiscover the fascinating possibilities of the ECoS command station on the following pages. But take heed: ECoS performance is so good, that even we had to re-read a few passages to believe it!\n\nECoS Features\n\nWith an ECoS command station you acquire an open system. As is expected of ESU, from the beginning we wanted to be open to, and compatible with, present systems and norms. Just like our decoders, the ECoS is a real multi-protocol command station.\n\nAs a multi-protocol command station, ECoS supports DCC, Märklin® Motorola®, Selectrix® and the M4 data protocol. M4 drives and controls locomotives equipped with mfx® decoders without any restrictions. M4 is completely compatible. You can even continue to use almost all of your present loco decoders. ECoS is therefore the only digital command station worldwide that unifies 4 data protocols.\n\nWith an ECoS you can run locos: via two integrated cabs with large, easy-grasp motor driven throttle knobs and nine precise click-function keys you control your locos. In combination with the touch screen, you can control up to 31 functions per engine.\n\nECoS controls turnouts and magnetic accessories: a large, graphical control panel provides you access for up to 1420 turnouts (DCC or Motorola® protocol).\n\nWith ECoS you can plan and control routes: simply put turnouts and magnetic accessories graphically in groups and switch them together. Routes will be activated either by feedback contacts or by key. You can even use s88 occupancy detectors or ECoSDetector feedback modules.\n\nWith ECoS you can operate shuttle trains very easily: put a rail contact at both ends of the track and ECoS will do the rest.\n\nThe ECoS built-in booster has so much power that, in most cases, you don‘t need additional ones.\n\nECoS supports EcoSlink, a high-speed bus system, based on CAN, that transmits data instantaneously to the command station.\n\nWith ECoS, never before has it been so simple to program your decoders: the large, colored TFT screen offers good contrast and displays a lot of information in unabbreviated text. A programming track establishes contact with your decoders.\n\nOf course, the ECoS has a pre-installed DCC RailCom® function: with its „global detector“ it recognizes RailCom®-compatible decoders (e.g. our LokPilot V4.0 decoder) directly on the main track. You also have the possibility to feedback the turnout position via the SwitchPilot to the ECoS command station.\n\nECoS is compatible. Besides Selectrix®, Märklin®-Motorola®, and M4, ECoS speaks all variants of the DCC-Norm. With the integrated analog controllers (joysticks) you can even control the whistle of LokSound decoders, never before more precisely.\n\nECoS is expandable. Each ECoS command station sports a network port for connection with a computer. Thus you can update software or use a computer for operation.\n\nWho needs ECoS?\n\nECoS is basically the command station for all. Beginners, who are looking for a simple-to-operate cab, will be at home right away: the large, graphic touch screen display shows all information in plain text; in case of doubt use the integrated help function. Never was it easier to switch to digital control. And ECoS runs DC or AC driven trains (compatible decoder provided).\n\nEven model railroaders, who alredy own a digital command station, should step up to ECoS: next to the extreme simple inputs, and the possibilities for route-and shuttle train programming, you will learn to appreciate the manifold programming features for decoders. You can connect your present equipment to the input of EcoSniffer, and continue to use it: you don‘t need to discard anything that you want to keep using!\n\nDue to its enormous output-performance, the ECoS command station is recommended especially for operators of Gauge 1 or G layouts: at last you can run multiple trains without an external booster. Total interplay with our LokSound XL V4.0 decoders is matter of fact."
