        "text": "Words used in the rail transport industry\n\nRail transport terms are a form of technical terminology applied to railways. Although many terms are uniform across different nations and companies, they are by no means universal, with differences often originating from parallel development of rail transport systems in different parts of the world, and in the national origins of the engineers and managers who built the inaugural rail infrastructure. An example is the term railroad, used (but not exclusively) in North America, and railway, generally used in English-speaking countries outside North America and by the International Union of Railways. In English-speaking countries outside the United Kingdom, a mixture of US and UK terms may exist.[1]\n\nThe abbreviation \"UIC\" refers to terminology adopted by the International Union of Railways in its official publications and thesaurus.[2]\n\n0–9\n\n[edit]\n\nFor 4-4-0, 2-6-4T, 0-4-4-0, etc., see Whyte notation.\n\nA\n\n[edit]\n\nAcorn.\n\nA general term used to finish the ends of rods of various forms.[3]\n\nAdhesion railway\n\nThe most common type of railway, where power is applied by driving some or all of the wheels of the locomotive.[4]\n\nAdhesive weight\n\nThe weight on the driving wheels of a locomotive, which determines the frictional grip between wheels and rail, and hence the drawbar pull a locomotive can exert[5]\n\nAdjusting spring\n\nA heavy spiral spring or nest of springs used for controlling the side motion of a two-wheel radial trailing truck.[3]\n\nAdjusting spring case\n\nAlso Centering spring cylinder.\n\nA cylindrical cast-iron holder in which an adjusting string is placed.[3]\n\nAdjusting spring seat\n\nA casting, or a part of the bolster of a two-wheel trailing truck, forming a bearing for the end of the adjusting spring.[3]\n\nAdmission\n\nThe opening of steam port to admit steam to one end of a cylinder. If the valve has no lead, admission takes place at the moment the piston of its stroke and just as it is to begin the return stroke.[3]\n\nAir brake\n\nAlso Railway air brake.\n\nAny brake operated by air pressure, but usually restricted to systems of continuous brakes operated by compressed air, in distinction from Vacuum Brakes, which are operated by creating a vacuum. The air is compressed by some form of steam pump on the locomotive, or a motor-compressor on electric locomotives, and is conveyed by pipes and flexible hose between the engine, tender and cars to cylinders and pistons under the tender and each car, by which the pressure is transmitted to the brake levers, and thence to the brake shoes. This system is what is now termed the straight-air brake. This brake is now obsolete in steam road practice, having been replaced by the Automatic Air Brake.[3]\n\nAir brake hose\n\nFlexible tubes made of alternate layers of rubber and canvas by which the brake pipes under engines, tenders, and cars are connected together, and compressed air, which operates the brakes, conducted through the train. The hose is made with a coupling at each end of the engine and tender so that it can readily be connected or disconnected. Also called air hose and brake hose.[3]\n\nAir cylinder (air pump)\n\nA cylinder forming part of the air brake pump and having its piston fastened to the same rod to which the piston of the steam cylinder is fastened. It is furnished with air inlet and discharge valves at each end, communicating respectively with the air inlet and the discharge pipe.[3]\n\nAir cylinder bracket\n\nA projecting piece of metal bolted to the frame of a locomotive or tender, to which the brake cylinder is attached. See Truck Brake, Tender Brake.[3]\n\nAir cylinder gasket\n\nSee Gasket.[3]\n\nAir cylinder oil cup (air pump)\n\nA small brass receptacle with a stopcock or faucet, screwed to the air cylinder of an air pump, to hold a supply of lubricant for the air cylinder. See Automatic Air Cylinder Oil Cup.[3]\n\nAir drum\n\nAlso Main Reservoir and Reservoir.\n\nA cylindrical reservoir, made of sheet steel, into which air is pumped and stored for use in the air brake system and train air signal line. Sometimes placed under the cab deck or between the frames in front of the guide yoke; but now two are commonly used, placed under the running board near the cab, one on each side of the engine.[3]\n\nAir drum hanger\n\nAn iron strap riveted to the lower side of the running board, or to the boiler, to support the air drum.[3]\n\nAir drum head\n\nThe end of the air drum, to which the cylindrical body is riveted or welded.[3]\n\nAir drum saddle\n\nA strip of iron fastened to the locomotive frame for supporting the air drum or drums when the drums are placed between the cylinder saddles and the guide yoke.[3]\n\nAir gage (air brake)\n\nA gage to register the pressure of air in the reservoirs, brake pipe, or brake cylinders, similar to an ordinary steam pressure gage. They are made either with a single pointer or with two pointers, to indicate on one dial both the reservoir pressure and the brake pipe pressure. The latter type is called a duplex gage.[3]\n\nAir gage fitting\n\nA pipe connection by means of whichan air gage is connected to an engineer's brake valve in a locomotive cab.[3]\n\nAir gage stand\n\nA bracket or support to hold an air gage.[3]\n\nAlerter or watchdog\n\nSimilar to the dead man's switch other than it does not require the operator's constant interaction. Instead, an alarm is sounded at a preset interval in which the operator must respond by pressing a button to reset the alarm and timer if no other controls are operated. If the operator does not respond within a preset time, the prime mover is automatically throttled back to idle and the brakes are automatically applied.[6]\n\nAdhesion railway#All-weather adhesion\n\nThe adhesion available during traction mode with 99% reliability in all weather conditions[7]\n\nAlternator\n\nAn electrical generator that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy in the form of alternating current[8]\n\nAmerican Locomotive Company (Alco)\n\nThe second largest builder of steam locomotives in the United States[9][10]\n\nAmerican type\n\nA steam locomotive with a 4-4-0 wheel arrangement.[11]\n\nAngle cock\n\nA valve affixed to each end of a piece of rolling stock that, when opened, admits compressed air to the brake pipe (or vents it to the atmosphere if air hose is detached)[12]\n\nAnnett's key\n\nA large key which locks levers or other items of signalling apparatus, thereby serving as a portable form of interlocking[citation needed]\n\nArticulated locomotive\n\nA steam locomotive with one or more engine units that can move relative to the main frame[9][13]\n\nArticulated vehicles (articulation)\n\nThe sharing of one truck by adjacent ends of two rail vehicles.\n\nAshpan\n\nA feature of a locomotive with the same form and purpose as the domestic variety (i.e. to collect the ashes that fall through the bars of the grate). The only significant difference is the size, measured in feet rather than inches.\n\nAsynchronous motor\n\nAn alternating current electric motor whose speed varies with load and has no fixed relation to the frequency of the supply.\n\nAtlantic type\n\nA steam locomotive with a 4-4-2 wheel arrangement.[14][15][16]\n\nAutomatic block signaling (ABS)\n\nA system that consists of a series of signals that divide a railway line into a series of blocks and then functions to control the movement of trains between them through automatic signals.\n\nAutomatic train control (ATC)\n\nA system that applies an emergency brake if the driver does not react to certain signals or speed restrictions[17]\n\nAutomatic train operation (ATO)\n\nA technology for automation of trains.\n\nAutomatic train protection (ATP)\n\nA system that enforces obedience to signals and speed restrictions by speed supervision, including automatic stop at signals[18]\n\nGWR Autotrain\n\nA branch-line train consisting of a steam locomotive and passenger carriages that can be driven from either end by means of rodding to the regulator and an additional vacuum brake valve. The fireman remains with the locomotive and, when the driver is at the other end, the fireman controls the cut off and vacuum ejectors in addition to his usual duties. See also: Push-pull train.\n\nAxlebox\n\nThe housing that holds the axle bearings on a rail vehicle[19] The housing that attaches to the end of the axle to the bogie and contains the bearing on which the axle rotates[20] See also journal box below.\n\nB\n\n[edit]\n\nBackhead\n\nThe cab-side rear panel of a steam locomotive boiler through which the firebox is accessed.[21]\n\nBad order\n\nA tag or note applied to a defective piece of equipment.

Wheels are cast or forged (wrought) and are heat treated to have a specific hardness. New wheels are trued to a specific profile before being pressed onto an axle. All wheel profiles must be periodically monitored to insure proper wheel to rail interface. Improperly trued wheels increase rolling resistance, reduce energy efficiency and may create unsafe operation. A railroad wheel typically consists of two main parts: the wheel itself, and the tire around the outside. A railway tire is itself steel, and is typically heated and pressed onto the wheel, where it remains firmly as it shrinks and cools.\n\nWheel climb\n\nAlso Adhesion railway.\n\nThe process of a wheel climbing up and often off the inside or gauge side of the rail.

Modern planned maintenance procedures have mostly obviated the need for the wheel-tapper.\n\nWheel tread\n\nAlso Adhesion railway.\n\nThe slightly conical section (often with a 1 in 20 slope) of a railroad wheel that is the primary contact point with the rail.[citation needed]\n\nWestinghouse Air Brake.\n\nA system of continuous brakes invented and patented (the first patent in 1869) by Mr. George Westinghouse, which is operated by compressed air. The air is compressed, by a steam air pump on the locomotive or an electric motor compressor on the car. and is stored up in a tank called the main reservoir on the engine or tender. By the original form of brake the compressed air was conveyed from the tank by pipes connected together between the cars by flexible brake hose to brake cylinders under each car. by means of which the pressure of the air was communicated to the brake levers, and thence to the brake shoes. A later and improved form is the Westinghouse automatic air brake, commonly called simply Westinghouse brake, which is now in universal use. At the present time the Westinghouse brake, unless otherwise specified, is always understood to mean the automatic air brake. The change made from the original form of the Westinghouse air brake in order to make it automatic was to carry a full pressure of air at all times in the brake pipes and cause the brakes to be applied by a reduction of this pressure instead of by the admission of pressure, so that the breaking apart of the train or a reduction of pressure by escape of air at any point on the brake pipe would apply the brakes to the whole train at once. A further advantage was that the action of the brakes was made quicker by saving the appreciable interval of time required for the compressed air to flow from a single reservoir at one end of the train in sufficient quantities to fill all the brake cylinders. An auxiliary reservoir is placed under each car, containing air at the same pressure as in the brake pipes. An ingenious valve called the triple valve connects the brake pipe, auxiliary reservoir and brake cylinder together in such manner that any reduction of pressure in the brake pipe opens a passage for the air from the auxiliary reservoir to the brake cylinder, applying the brakes, and closes the connection between brake pipe and reservoir. To release the brakes, the pressure in the brake pipes is restored, when the triple valve closes the connection between the auxiliary reservoir and brake cylinder and opens one between the brake cylinder and the outer air and between the auxiliary reservoir and the brake pipe. In order that the train brakes may be applied from any car, each car is fitted with a valve called the conductor's valve, connected to the brake pipe so that the compressed air therein can be permitted to escape by opening the valve.\n\nWestinghouse E-T Locomotive Brake Equipment (Air Brake)\n\nA new arrangement of air brake apparatus as applied to a locomotive. It differs from previous locomotive brake schedules principally in that the details are centralized and simplified so as to reduce the total number required, occupy less space, and give the engineman a mere certain and flexible control of the locomotive brakes. It has all the good features of any of the older equipment, besides a number of new ones, viz., uniform brake cylinder pressure on engine and tender, and a pressure-maintaining feature by which the brake-cylinder pressure is automatically held to that resulting from the brake application as long as such application lasts. See Distributing Valve.\n\nWestinghouse Friction Draft Gear\n\nA form of draft gear in which the forces are absorbed and dissipated by friction. The friction device is encased in a malleable iron cylinder open at the front end. The front follower bears against a preliminary spring, the other end of which bears against the center wedge of the shape of the frustum of an octagonal pyramid. Surrounding the wedge are four pairs of segmental carriers having one rib each which lies in a groove in the cylinder. The other grooves in the cylinder are filled by friction strips resting on the carriers. These strips are of wrought iron and have lugs formed on them which engage in corresponding cavities in the carriers so that the friction strips must move with the carriers. The function of the preliminary spring is to absorb the light shocks without bringing into action the friction parts. The main release spring, placed back of the carriers, forces the carriers to their normal position when the pressure is removed and also adds to the capacity of the device. When the follower plates are moved toward each other, the preliminary spring is compressed until its capacity of 20,000 pounds is exceeded, when the follower bears against the release pin and forces it forward, relieving the wedge from the pressure of the auxiliary release spring, thereby allowing the compression of the preliminary and auxiliary preliminary springs to force the wedge forward and press the segmental carriers and friction strips firmly into the cylinder grooves. The follower then strikes and forces the segmental carriers in, producing friction between the friction strips and the grooves. The complete movement gives a resistance of 100,000 pounds. In releasing, the preliminary spring is gradually restored, and the auxiliary release spring then forces the wedge out, while the release spring returns the friction strips and carriers, giving a complete release. Owing to the varying width of the slots and lugs on the friction strips and carriers the strips are released four at a time through successive small distances. The operations of buffing and pulling are exactly the same, except that the load comes on the front or rear follower first, as the case may be. See Draft Gear.\n\nWestinghouse SWA-SWB Locomotive Brake Equipment\n\nSee Combined Automatic and Straight-Air Locomotive Brake.\n\nWestinghouse Traction Brake\n\nThe adaptation of the Westinghouse air brake equipments to electrically propelled cars or trains. The changed conditions of motive power and method of operating such cars or trains have necessitated various changes in the details of the equipments, while the general principles of the Westinghouse straight-air and automatic brakes, which are the foundation of all known air brake equipments, remains the same. A motor-driven air compressor furnishes the compressed air; an electric pump governor controls the operation of the same; the brake and triple valves are of different design to accord with the conditions for which they are required. Otherwise the description of the Westinghouse Air Brake, which see, covers the traction brake also.\n\nWestinghouse Train Air Signal Apparatus.\n\nAlso see Train Air Signal Apparatus.\n\nA device for utilizing the supply of compressed air required for operating the Westinghouse brakes to transmit signals to the engine or motorman's cab instead of using the ordinary bell cord.\n\nWestinghouse Unit Switch System of Control\n\nAlso see Control System.\n\nA system of control for railway and other motors by means of low potential train line circuits taken from a storage battery under the car which operate electro-magnets controlling pneumatic valves and cylinders operating the main controller circuits under each car by air taken from the brake pipe. The main controller under each car consists of a group of electro-pneumatic switches which give the desired combinations to the motor circuits. A reverse switch and auxiliary resistance are essential parts of the apparatus'under each car. The apparatus is applicable for cither direct current or alternating current motors. Also called Westinghouse electro-pneumatic system of control.\n\nWheel\n\n1. A circular frame or solid piece of wood or metal which revolves on an axis.\n\nA circular frame or disk, revolving on an axle, serving to support a moving vehicle. Engine truck wheels are sometimes made of chilled cast iron, but more commonly have a cast iron or cast steel center with a steel tire fastened on, as are also tender truck wheels. See Wheel Center.'
