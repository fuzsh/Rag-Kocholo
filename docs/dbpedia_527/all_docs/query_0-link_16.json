        "text": "This is another of my beloved ‘Terrier’ tanks. Locos like this were originally built to haul London commuter trains. The first loco was delivered in 1872. This was one of the first and entered service in 1872. Like other members of the class it was named after a location in London and was called Fenchurch.\n\nThe Terriers proved to be remarkably successful and soon they were not powerful enough for the loads they had to haul. They got spread around the little ‘empire’ that their company ran – the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway and also sold to other companies for further use. We have met them on the Isle of Wight and the Kent and East Sussex Light Railway.\n\nThis one was acquired by the Newhaven Harbour Company in 1898. One of its main jobs was to haul fuel for the cross channel ferries to Dieppe. By some piece of weird management the fuel depot was on the west bank of the Ouse and fuel had to be taken to the ships on the east bank. The swing bridge carried the rails but could only carry light weight locos. A Terrier proved ideal. Now this photo is not mine. Despite many days spent in Newhaven I never saw a train on the bridge. I have sourced this one from http://freespace.virgin.net/jean.jean/TOC2Mus/Bridge2.html . We see a train, hauled by a different Terrier, crossing the bridge as recently as 1960.\n\nBut back to good old Fenchurch. In 1926 the Newhaven Harbour Company was absorbed into the Southern Railway. The loco reverted to its old railway number and survived into nationalisation in 1948. I used to see the old Lady when I was a train spotter in the late 1950s and early 60s. By this time the loco was 90 years old – along with its twin they were the oldest engines still at work. The end came, as far as main line work was concerned when the old loco was withdrawn from service in 1964. The Bluebell Railway purchased her and there she still is.\n\nThat’s where my photo (the top one) was taken, possibly in 1980 although it may have been earlier.\n\nTags: A1x, LBSCR, Newhaven, Stroudley, Terrier"
