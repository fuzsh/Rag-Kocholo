I just want active rail so I choose the \"rail\" tagged features (rule-based rendering). But since every track is a line and escpecially within cities, there a sometime 5 or more tracks close to each other so the symbology looks pretty ugly like in the screenshot. What could I do besides, deleting the features I do not want to be shown (which would mean a lot of work)?\n\nI would stick to the OSM design as close as possible. It works pretty well accross most zoom levels.\n\nI use #787878 for the base colour. Width 1mm. For the dashed line on top I use white as colour. Width 0.6mm. Cap style Square. Custom Dash 1.5mm (Space 3).\n\nanswered Apr 8, 2016 at 11:10\n\nDennis BauszusDennis Bauszus\n\n2,29933 gold badges2121 silver badges3131 bronze badges"
