        "text": "A signal is an indicator that through a displayed indication, conveys the status of the track ahead to Drivers passing it. This could be a signal, with 3 or 4 lights mounted on a pole (or gantry) or shunt signals near the ground producing a white and red pattern.\n\nMechanics[]\n\nSignals work by using sensors mounted on the track to check if a train is present. The sensor in question will then report its status to a signalling centre and will change the signal aspects behind it to tell Drivers that they need to slow down and stop as their route cannot be set due to a conflicting move or train in front.\n\nAutomatic Warning System[]\n\nMain article: Automatic Warning System\n\nThe Automatic Warning System (AWS) may apply if a yellow, double yellow or red signal is ahead. If the AWS is alerted, drivers must press the Q button or click the yellow exclamation mark in the HUD to dismiss the AWS.\n\nTypes of signals[]\n\nThree- and four-aspect signals[]\n\nThe majority of the network uses four-aspect signals, as well as three-aspect signals in a few cases. These signals can display three or four different states.\n\nA green aspect (Proceed) tells the driver that their route is clear and that they can proceed at line speed. The next aspect is usually green but can sometimes be (double) yellow. If this signal is shown, it will trigger an electrical ping from the AWS. This ping does not have to be acknowledged and is there to alert the driver.\n\nA double yellow aspect (Preliminary Caution) tells the driver that their route is not clear after two signals ahead and they must slow down in preparation to stop at the red signal. It is recommended, but not required, to slow down to 75, when approaching these signals. The next aspect will always be yellow unless it changes as more of the train's route is clear. If this signal is next it will trigger an AWS sound in the form of a loud continuous beep and must be acknowledged by the driver by pressing Q or by clicking the warning symbol.\n\nA yellow aspect (Caution) tells the driver that the next signal can be red (Danger) and that they must slow down in preparation to stop at the next signal. The next aspect will be red (Danger) unless it changes as more the train's route is clear or the Signaller sets the signal to caution. The speed limit on SCR past this aspect is 45 mph until the signal aspect clears to a less restrictive aspect. However, it is found in some places to designate a speed limit decrease to 45 mph. If this signal is next it will trigger an AWS horn in the form of a loud continuous beep and must be acknowledged by the driver by pressing Q or by clicking the warning symbol.\n\nA red aspect (Danger) tells the driver that they must stop at this signal and they must come to a complete stop by the signal. They must not proceed past this signal and if they do, automatic emergency braking is applied and will bring the train to a halt. The term for passing this signal is Signal Passed at Danger (SPAD). The train has no clearance beyond this point. If this signal is next it will trigger an AWS horn in the form of a loud continuous beep and must be acknowledged by the driver by pressing Q or by clicking the warning symbol.\n\nSemaphore signals[]\n\nThrough a sneak peek, the introduction of semaphore signals was revealed on 18 April 2024, as part of SCR Version 2.0. Semaphore signalling involves signals that display their different indications to train drivers by changing the angle of inclination of a pivoted 'arm'. The hands will be animated.\n\nShunt signals[]\n\nIn all depots and sidings, shunt signals are used. Unlike other types of signals, they are mounted to the ground. Shunt signals have three lights in a triangular shape.\n\nA double white aspect (Proceed) tells the driver that the route is clear to the next signal and that they can proceed at the speed limit, while being able to stop at the next signal if necessary. The next aspect can be any indication - another shunt signal at danger or proceed or a line signal at any aspect. If this signal is next it will trigger an electrical ping from the AWS. This ping does not have to be acknowledged and is there to alert the driver.\n\nA double red aspect (Danger) tells the driver that they must stop at this signal and they must come to a complete stop by the signal. They may not proceed past this signal and if they do, automatic emergency braking is applied and will bring the train to a halt. The term for passing this signal is Signal Passed at Danger (SPAD). The train has no clearance beyond this point. If this signal is next it will trigger an AWS horn in the form of a loud continuous beep and must be acknowledged by the driver by pressing Q or by clicking the warning symbol.\n\nIndicators[]\n\nThere are two types of signal indicators: Feather and Alphanumeric. Both types are purely cosmetic and Drivers are not required to make any additional input.\n\nFeather indicators[]\n\nA feather signal is a type of signal that has one or two rows of white lights (called feathers) mounted above the aspect lights. When appropriate, they illuminate to indicate the direction of divergence.\n\nThe addition of feather signals was long requested by the community and they were sneak-peeked during Innovations Director BanTech's livestream on 6 January 2022 - despite never being formally sneak-peeked on the SCR Official Discord server.\n\nFeather signals are triggered upon passing the signal prior as only then can the route be detected. As a result, Signallers have no control over setting feathers before a train approaches a signal.\n\nThese indicators were added as part of the 1.9.0 update and are found at most junctions.\n\nAlphanumeric route indicators[]\n\nAlphanumeric route indicators (also known as theatre-style) are similar to feather indicators, but instead of rows of white lights indicating direction of divergence, a screen mounted on top of the aspect lights displays a letter or number, indicating the assigned route or platform.\n\nLikewise with feathered signals, they were teased during BanTech's livestream on 6 January 2022.\n\nThese indicators were added as part of the 1.9.1 update and are commonly found upon approach of a major station.\n\nLocations[]\n\nAlphabetical Location Symbols\n\n(bolded) Platform(s)/Signal(s) Routes Stepford East station Mainline Platform 1 and 2 Any route that passes through St Helens Bridge Whitefield Any route that runs on the Whitefield branch St Helens Bridge station Benton Platform 3 and 4 Any Stepford Connect route that goes via Benton from St Helens Bridge Morganstown Any Stepford Connect route that runs on the Morganstown branch Morganstown Docks station Greenslade Platform 1 Any route that terminates at Greenslade Morganstown Morganstown Shuttle and any Stepford Express route that runs via the Morganstown Flyover Stepford Airport Central station Fast Platforms 3-6\n\n(towards Stepford Airport Parkway)\n\nAny AirLink route Slow/Stopper Any Stepford Connect route Between Leighton Stepford Road and Leighton City Line A/B S355, S357 Any Stepford Connect and Stepford Express routes that go from Leighton Stepford Road to Leighton City Between Northshore and Llyn-by-the-Sea Line A/C S554 Any Stepford Express route that terminates at Llyn-by-the-Sea Airport West station Airport Platform 1 R017 Esterfield Any route that continues along the Esterfield Line"
