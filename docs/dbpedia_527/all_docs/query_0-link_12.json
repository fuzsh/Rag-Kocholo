        "text": "Hi all - seems a daft question but the info on various ferry websites gives conflicting info about which of the stations in Newhaven (Town or Harbour) is actually closest to the ferry terminal in Newhaven. So I assumed people on here will actually know for real!\n\nThe basic info would help, but an added complication is a need to meet someone at the port who is taking a car, and then getting on the ferry in said car, as opposed to being a foot passenger direct from the train.\n\nAll insights gratefully received. Thanks in advance.\n\nNewhaven Town is right next to the port. Newhaven Town station is about a thirty second walk from the terminal building. You just alight from the train at Newhaven Town and the ferry port is right there next door.\n\nOn the other hand Newhaven Harbour is about ten minutes walk away as if you alight at Newhaven Harbour you will have to walk all the way back to Newhaven Town and cross over the level crossing to get there.\n\nThe naming of these stations is ridiculous. It causes so much confusion with ferry passengers thinking that they need Newhaven Harbour when it is actually Newhaven Town that they need. They really just need to rename Newhaven Harbour to something more sensible like Newhaven South or even better just shut the station as it serves zero purpose these days.\n\nThe ferry terminal building for foot passengers and the vehicle entrance are both right next to each other just outside Newhaven Town station. So the person you are meeting can easily wait in the car park outside the ferry terminal building or the lay by outside the station and then go through the vehicle entrance to the ferry after they pick you up. There is plenty of space for vehicles to park up and wait.\n\nNewhaven Town is right next to the port. Newhaven Town station is about a thirty second walk from the terminal building.
