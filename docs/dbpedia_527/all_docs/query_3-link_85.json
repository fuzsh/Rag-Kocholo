        "text": "Is it possible to travel in other parts of Europe with Trenitalia? How can I purchase an international ticket?\n\nAt Trenitalia ticket offices and authorized travel agencies, you can purchase one-way or return tickets, for both individual passengers and groups, for day or night-time journeys, for trains departing from an Italian station to a foreign destination, from a foreign station to Italy or from a foreign station to a destination in another foreign station.\n\nHow long before the journey can I purchase my ticket?\n\nA Base ticket can be purchased any time up to a few minutes before you board the train. However, for other ticket types and offers, there are different purchase deadlines. To find out more.\n\nIs the ticket transferable?\n\nCurrently, tickets purchased for travel on medium-long distance trains are non-transferable and the name of the ticket holder must be clearly indicated at the time of purchase, and this is subject to verification, upon request, once on board the train by showing train personnel a valid form of personal identification.\n\nRegional electronic tickets are also non-transferable. On board the train, you must always show a valid form of personal identification along with your ticket or season ticket.\n\nPlease remember that if you are a CartaFRECCIA customer, you may only enter your CartaFRECCIA card code if you are the person travelling. To find out more, please see the CartaFRECCIA Regulations.\n\nDo I always have to print out my ticket or season ticket?\n\nIt depends on the type of ticket or season ticket:\n\nTicketless tickets do not need to be printed. In this case, all you need to board your train is to be in possession of the PNR code for your ticket. To find out more, please visit the page dedicated to ticketless tickets.\n\nyou can show your regional electronic ticket and regional season ticket, which you have purchased online, on an electronic device (PC, tablet or smartphone) provided you are able to properly show the attachment (in PDF format) that you will have received at the time of purchase, including the Quick Response code, which collects all your ticket/season ticket data. Alternatively, you can choose to print out your tickets. We would like to remind you that the digital or paper form of your Regional ticket and season ticket must always be accompanied by a valid form of personal identification to be shown upon the request of on-board personnel.\n\nFor tickets that cannot be issued in ticketless form (e.g. tickets for certain international trains) and season tickets, you will need to collect and print these tickets at the Self Services machines located in the station before boarding your train.\n\nWhat can I do if the purchase was not successful but I received a text message from my bank indicating my card has been charged?\n\nIn the event that you see an unsuccessful transaction message, even if you have received an SMS alert from your bank indicating a charge, the payment has still not been completed and Trenitalia will send a request for an immediate reversal of the charge, without any transaction taking place on your card.\n\nFor prepaid cards, the time it takes to reset your credit amount will depend on the card issuer (bank or payment circuits in the case of Amex and Diners cards), and we suggest you contact your card issuer directly for more information in this regard.\n\nIn case of payment by bank transfer (MyBank service), the time it takes for the charged amount to be returned to your account will follow the times set by the banking circuits involved.\n\nWhat can I do if my attempts at payment fail?\n\nPlease consult the dedicated section of our Online Purchasing Guide to find out why an online transaction may not be successful and what to do about it. If you wish to request assistance or clarification for a payment, you can contact our operators on our new Online service, which is in operation every day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. To activate the chat, simply click on the icon at the bottom of the Help and contacts page.\n\nOr you can send an email toareaclienti@trenitalia.it, specifying your username (for purchases made while logged in to your profile) or the email used at the time of purchase (for purchases made without registration) and the date you tried to make the purchase.\n\nI used a bonus/discount coupon but the transaction was not successful. Have I lost my bonus/discount coupon?\n\nThe bonus/discount coupon used during an unsuccessful payment will be reactivated, and you will be able to use it again, within 60 minutes.\n\nWhat can I do if I my Internet network connection is lost during payment?\n\nCheck if you have received the purchase summary email or if the journey has been added to your purchased journeys in your Customer Area to find out if the transaction was successful despite the interruption to your Internet service. Check if you have received the purchase summary email or if the journey has been added to your purchased journeys in your Customer Area to find out if the transaction was successful despite the interruption to your Internet service. If you want to request a clarification or check the outcome of a transaction, you can contact our operators on our new Online service, which is in operation every day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. To activate the chat, simply click on the icon at the bottom of the Help and contacts page.\n\nOr you can send an email to areaclienti@trenitalia.it , specifying your username (for purchases made while logged in to your profile) or the email used at the time of purchase (for purchases made without registration) the date you tried to make the purchase, and the name and surname of the cardholder of the card used.\n\nCan I use more than one credit card with my account?\n\nYou can ask for authorisation to increase the number of credit cards linked to your account by sending an email to areaclienti@trenitalia.it , in which you should indicate the following:\n\n• your user ID\n\n• a photocopy of a valid form of personal identification and the tax code of the account holder\n\n• a telephone number\n\n• a brief description of why you are requesting an increase in the number of credit cards\n\nI forgot my VISA/MASTERCARD 3D secure code password. How can I recover it?\n\nAfter entering your credit card number, in the section where you are asked to enter your password verified by Visa/MasterCard, if you don’t remember your password, you can request it be sent to you by clicking on the link “have you forgotten your password?” and following the instructions given. A temporary password will be sent to the email address you provided, and you will be able to change it the first time you log in. For further clarification, we suggest that you contact the customer service department of your VISA/MASTERCARD provider.\n\nCan I request a refund for my journey if I decide not to travel?\n\nWhether or not you will be granted a refund depends on the type of ticket you have purchased, some offers do not include this option. To find out if your ticket is refundable and the refund process will involve a deduction to the original amount paid.\n\nHow can I request a refund for a ticket purchased online?\n\nOnce you have verified that your ticket is refundable, you can request a refund online by following the “Change ticket” process.\n\nHow do I change an economy ticket?\n\nIn order to change the date/time (the only details that can be changed) on an economy ticket, you must select the “Change your ticket” option and then click on “Change Ticket”.\n\nWhat is the difference between booking changes and other changes (e.g. ticket changes)?\n\nWith a “Booking change” you can only change (anticipate or postpone) the date and time of the original journey, but the departure and arrival stations, the service and the offer used to purchase the original ticket must stay the same.\n\nWith a “Ticket change”, on the other hand, if the terms and conditions of the offer used to purchase the original ticket permit it, you can change the service and/or the offer of the original journey, or change the entire journey, including the departure and arrival stations, the date of departure, and the number of passengers, while also being permitted to choose other services and offers that are different from the original purchase.\n\nA “Booking change” will never involve a refund to the ticket price nor will you have to pay a supplement fee to cover any price difference, while a “Ticket Change”, depending on the case at hand, may involve either paying the difference in price compared to the original purchase price, or the possibility of a refund (with the refunded amount being credited to the same payment method used for purchase).\n\nI’ve missed my train. How can I use my ticket?\n\nAfter the departure time of your booked train, you cannot request a refund. For some types of tickets, it is possible to ask for a ticket change and/or to board a train other than the one you originally booked.\n\nCan I change the departure date and time on my ticket?\n\nYes, if the type of ticket purchased allows it.\n\nCan I change the name indicated on my ticket?\n\nYes, by making a Change to passenger name.\n\nFor all other information, please see the General.\n\nWhat is a Trenitalia Gift Card?\n\nA Gift Card entitles the holder to a certain amount of credit (from €25 to €150 euro) that can be used to purchase Trenitalia train tickets (single tickets, season tickets, Carnets, etc.) on national, regional and international services (limited to domestic routes within Italy), from Trenitalia’s main sales channels (excluding the Trenitalia app). It is not possible to purchase tickets on board trains using a Gift Card).\n\nWhere can I purchase a Gift Card?\n\nGift Cards can be purchased on this website, from ticket offices at the station and from authorised travel agencies.\n\nCan I use a Gift Card to make multiple purchases?\n\nThe Gift Card credit can be used multiple times until the credit balance is depleted. It is valid for 10 years from the time of issue/purchase and it can be used in association with other methods of payment (e.g. cash, credit card, etc.) on Trenitalia’s main sales channels.\n\nCan I convert the credit on my Gift Card into cash?\n\nGift Cards cannot be resold or converted into cash.\n\nI’ve lost my Gift Card code. Can I retrieve it?\n\nIn case of theft or loss, customers will not be reissued with a replacement, nor will they be able to request the retrieval of their original Gift Card code.\n\nWhat happens if I change the ticket purchased with a Gift Card or if I request a refund?\n\nTickets purchased using a Gift Card follow the after sales rules established for the type of ticket originally selected. Therefore, you retain the right to take advantage of the amount paid using the Gift Card even in the event of after sales assistance (changes, refunds and the right to board another train). In the event of a refund, the amount owed (net of any deductions) will be automatically credited by the system to the original Gift Card/Electronic Credit used.\n\nCan I bring my bicycle on board?\n\nYou may bring your bicycle with you free of charge on national train services provided it is disassembled and contained in a bag or a fully closed folding bike.

Luggage may be permitted to exceed this volume limit as long as it does not disturb or cause injury to other passengers, does not obstruct railway staff from carrying out their work, and does not damage the coach. On some trains, specific spaces have been made available for passengers to store larger luggage items.\n\nHow do I access the Wi-Fi service?\n\nYou can access Wi-Fi service on board Frecciarossa trains in just a few quick steps.\n\nIs there a restaurant car?\n\nAll Frecce trains feature a Bar/Restaurant service with hot meals and quick snacks. On Frecciarossa trains, passengers can enjoy lunch or dinner at the Gourmet Restaurant.\n\nHow are tickets checked?\n\nAll passengers must be in possession of a valid ticket for travel on the route, train, class and service level they have boarded and follow the rules and regulations established for the ticket and train service in question. In the event of non-compliance with these requirements, the passenger will be required to pay the full-price fare for the service in question as well as additional fines depending on the seriousness of the infringement.\n\nIf I have a lot of luggage or a very bulky piece of luggage, can I ship it?\n\nIf you are travelling on Frecce, Intercity or IntercityNotte train services, you can ship your luggage to your destination in Italy with our “Easy Luggage” (Bagaglio Facile) service in collaboration with TNT. This service costs €20 euro for the first bag, while the second bag costs only €15 euro.
