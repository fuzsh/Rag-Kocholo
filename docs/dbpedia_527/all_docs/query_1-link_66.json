        "text": "No other area of the United States has as extensive a commuter rail network as the New York metropolitan region. From a series of hubs and terminals (including Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan; Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn; a number of hubs in Queens, including a refurbished Jamaica Station; and the Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey), a far-flung and ever expanding system of commuter and commuter-type trains operate as far east as Montauk (Suffolk County), as far north as Wassaic (Dutchess County), as far west as Port Jervis (Orange County), and as far south as Trenton, capital of New Jersey. Other nearby commuter rail systems not based out of the New York City metropolitan area operate in Connecticut (Shore Line East and CT Rail, out of New Haven) and in southern New Jersey (New Jersey Transit's Atlantic City Line, based out of Philadelphia).\n\nThere are currently three separate commuter railroads operating in the New York metropolitan area, as follows:\n\nLong Island Rail Road (LIRR)\n\nIn a battle with its corporate cousin (Metro-North), the LIRR is the largest commuter railroad in the United States. In 2018, the road carried almost 90 million passengers. While the LIRR is no longer in the freight rail business, a separate railroad - the New York and Atlantic Railway - now offers freight service along much LIRR track. An independent railroad from 1834 to 1900, then part of the mighty Pennsylvania Railroad from 1900 until 1965, the LIRR has been owned by New York State since 1966 and is currently an integral part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). The LIRR currently operates out of a number of western terminals - most notably Penn Station in Manhattan and Atlantic Terminal (Flatbush Avenue) in Brooklyn - along 12 separate routes throughout the length and breadth of Long Island. Besides its restored station area within the Penn Station complex and a new Atlantic Terminal, other recent improvements include beefing up its reverse commute service and totally modernizing its diesel fleet, with new locomotives and passenger cars replacing 1950s vintage equipment. Among future improvements, perhaps the most anticipated is the East Side Access Project, which will allow LIRR trains to serve Grand Central Terminal and Manhattan's East Side. For more information on the LIRR, visit their Web site. (www.mta.info/lirr)\n\nMetro-North Railroad\n\nAn unqualified success story in its short 38-year history, ridership on the MTA's Metro-North Railroad was almost 88 million in 2018, and it is now the second busiest commuter railroad in the United States. Unlike the LIRR, which has been a separate railroad since 1834, Metro-North was founded in 1982 to take over Conrail's commuter service in New York and Connecticut and is an amalgam of several former railroads, including the New York Central, New Haven, and Erie. Emanating out of its hub at Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, Metro-North currently operates over three lines: Hudson, Harlem, and New Haven, with the New Haven having three separate branches (New Canaan, Danbury, Waterbury). West of the Hudson River, Metro-North operates two lines (Port Jervis, Pascack Valley) out of the historic Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken. Since 1982, the MTA and NYSDOT have invested heavily in Metro-North, including new trains (with the latest being state-of-the-art M-7 and M-8 passenger cars), new stations, new parking facilities, expansion of its service area, and a dramatic beefing up of existing service. One particular accomplishment of Metro-North has been with its Port Jervis Line. In 1982, this line had only three trains a day in both directions, with no weekend service. As of the Fall 2019 schedule, the Port Jervis Line now has a total of 158 trains a week, 130 on weekdays and 28 on weekends. In May 2009, a new Metro-North station on its Hudson Line opened a short walk from the new Yankee Stadium (Yankees-E. 153rd Street). For more information on Metro-North, visit their Web site.
