        "text": "The Bluebell Railway is proud to announce that our new build LBSCR Marsh Atlantic No. 32424 ‘Beachy Head’ will be launched into traffic at The Bluebell Railway.\n\nThe project to recreate 32424 ‘Beachy Head’ began over two decades ago, driven by a dedicated team of volunteers and enthusiasts at our railway. This ambitious endeavour aimed not only to build an accurate replica but also to revive a part of railway history which many had thought had been lost forever. Now, this much missed omission from those locomotives to have survived to the modern day has now been righted.\n\nThe project, conducted by the dedicated Atlantic House team, involved painstaking research, sourcing original plans, and even utilising components which the team was lucky enough to find and incorporate into this stunning new build locomotive . With a mix of modern technology and traditional methods, this ambitious project grew and gathered momentum as the years went on. The construction spanned years of meticulous work, which in 2024, reached its ultimate goal and created this amazing new build locomotive that we see today.\n\nReady for traffic, this is a milestone moment in railway preservation that The Bluebell Railway is proud to celebrate with you all."
