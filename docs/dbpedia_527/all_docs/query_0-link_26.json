        "meta_description": "2 reviews and 10 photos of NEWHAVEN TOWN \"Newhaven Town is the larger of this small Channel port's stations, and is a short walk from the town centre across the swing bridge over the harbour.\n\n\n Opened from Lewes in 1847 by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, the aim was to turn Newhaven into 'the Liverpool of the south'. Although it became a bustling port, with regular ferry services to Dieppe, it never quite grew as early promotional material suggested.\n\n\n The town eventually had three stations, Town, Harbour and Marine, the largest of which, by far, was Marine, used for passengers transferring to the ferry service to Dieppe. This is now closed and in a very sorry state, and Harbour station - used by foot passengers for the ferry - is just a halt.\n\n\n The station has a small stone building on the London-bound side with a short canopy, although it only has rather mean pedestrian access, owing to work under way on the port area behind. The Seaford platform has a basic bus-type shelter. There is a footbridge, but many choose to cross using the busy level crossing at the Lewes end. (This also provides level access to both platforms).\n\n\n The basic off-peak weekday service is every half hour on the Brighton to Seaford, with a few through London trains in the peaks. Aside from level access, the station has a mornings-only ticket office - and that's about it for facilities.\"",
