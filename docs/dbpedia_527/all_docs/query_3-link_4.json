        "text": "Sam Hallas' Website\n\nRailway Telephones: What do the signs mean?\n\nThe signs for most railway telephones are just geometric patterns which are meaningless to those not in the know! Since I prepared the artwork for the printers on the series of telephone labels before I retired I thought it would be interesting to share this knowledge with you. In 1989 I produced a directive in an attempt to standardise signage across the various Regions of British Rail. Following privatisation this function devolved to the Rail Safety and Standards Board.\n\nThe current rules for signage are contained in Railway Group Standard GIRT 7033. The version online when I prepared this page seemed to undo some of the work I started way back then by ignoring the international symbols contained in ISO 7001.\n\nThe requirement for lineside telephones is decreasing with the deployment of in-cab radio, the railway mobile phone network (GSM/R) and the roll-out of European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). Heritage railways, such as preserved lines, are not obliged to follow these rules, but what they do must accord with their own seafety case.\n\nTypeface\n\nReference is made in the Standard to the typeface 'Rail Alphabet' designed by Jock Kinnear and Margaret Calvert for the British Railways Board in the 1960s. Kinnear and Calvert previously designed the 'Transport' typeface which is used for all road signs in the UK. 'Rail Alphabet' is almost identical. In my time we never succeeded in getting hold of a computer version of this typeface. The standard says it shall be made available. It never was in the time before I retired.\n\nWhen my section at the British Railways Board issued a contract for printing the labels in about 1990, we could only specify Helvetica Bold as the typeface since no commercial printer had 'Rail Alphabet'. However, a revised version of Rail Alphabet was designed in 2009 by Henrik Kubel in association with Margaret Calvert. This is avaiable commercially. See http://www.newrailalphabet.co.uk/\n\nEven better, a fairly good likeness can be downloaded for free from my repository: brfonts.zip. Two weights are provided, light and dark. Little g, and the digits 4 and 0 are not quite right, but they do include a heap of useful symbols suitable for station signage.\n\nSymbols\n\n2000, amendments, various up to 2024, SMH\n\nNext: Some Railway Telephone Advertisements"
