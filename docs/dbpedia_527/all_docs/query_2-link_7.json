We hope that proposals can help develop a joint public and private sector consensus relative to the nature and urgency of necessary improvements. Rail and New Haven Harbor suggests how to improve the Tomlinson Bridge and approaches, re-establish efficient rail service to the east Shore and improve freight handling capabilities. Assistance provided by Seelye, Stevenson, Value and Knecht (Stratford, Connecticut) has been of immeasurable help. SSVK personnel are intimately familiar with the TomlInson Bridge, have extensive rail operations experience and are ac- tively engaged in a number of rail facility design projects. We appreciate the opportunity offered by the CEIP program and, in parti- cular, the assistance provided by Bill Cox of your office. Very truly yours, Donald G.

Improvements to the Tomlinson Bridge and its approaches can preserve east shore service. The Northeast Rail Services Act fixes Conrail's east shore commitment through early 1986. Neither Conrail nor a successor can be expected to offer attractive service without major physical improvements which permit modern equipment carrying reasonable loads to reach the east shore. make east shore rail freight service competitiv , Longer trains and heavier loads can supplant current one car at a time 200,000 pound.car (car plus load) limits. Weight limits alone restrict individual cars to loads between one- half and two-thirds of possible capacity. take advantage of the harbor's natural advantages. Improved rail links favor service to more remote markets. Location, natural features and investment combine to make New Haven Harbor a good facility for specialized commodities. Well-established liquid cargo (petroleum and chemicals) handling capabilities can be used more intensively. Good opportunities exist to handle bulk commo- dities including scrap, lumber and possibly coal in volume. complement other necessary expenditures. Two million dollars have been spent since 1973 to rehabilitate the Tomlinson Bridge lift mechanism, repair the lift span and install a fender system. Another $10 million investment will be necessary before 1990 to maintain U.S. 1 highway traffic on the bridge. An- other $7 million spent in concert with a comprehensive $10 million bridge re- habilitation project can provide necessary rail capacity. A near-term rail improvement program which focuses on existing facilities can create new capa- city faster, at less cost and with less disruption than otherwise possible. Commodities, freight car requirements, track alignment, clearance, grades and engine capabilities shape improvement needs. A contemporary environment must accomodate multi-car trains composed of 263,000 pounds (loaded) cars up to 65 feet in length and present curves with a radius of at least 460 feet (12 degrees, 30 minutes). 2. THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT A 145-year legacy shapes rail service options. Facilities reflect decisions of the Hartford and New Haven Railroad Company which originally brought service to New Haven and Belle Dock in 1839 and ex- tended service over the Tomlinson Bridge in 1870.(1) Later investment by the New York, New Haven', and Hartford Railroad (successor to the Hartford and New Haven in 1872), waterfront interests and the City of New Haven created the contemporary environment. Facilities have remained largely intact since 1926 when the City of New Haven completed construction of the fourth Tomlinson Bridge at the present location and grade-separated Water Street and the Belle Dock spur.(2) An East Shore-Rail Focus Long-term city development policies and emerging project, comnitments make east shore rail service important (Figure 1). West shore areas with relatively good rail service are largely committed to non-maritime activities which have relatively little use for rail. East shore sites with favorable long-term maritime potential depend on rail movement to and from the west shore. Sixty percent of (1) Manufacturer's Railroad facilities which included the Belle Dock spur were deeded to the New Haven Railroad in 1901. original (1839) Hartford and New Haven Railroad Company operations established Belle Dock as a terminal linking New York City-to-New Haven boat service and New Haven-to-Hartford and Albany rail service. The Railroad acq 'uired a maj.ority interest in the Tomlinson Toll Bridge Company at the same time. Passenger facilities were relocated from .Belle Dock to a joint New York and New Haven Railroad station in 1849. Belle Dock ship-to- rail freight handling capabilities were expanded in 1968 when a 1,500 foot long, 80 foot wide extension was constructed-- just four years before the New Haven-Hartford and New York-New Haven railroads merged. Rail and harbor develop .ment are traced in: New Haven Historical Society \"Books 134 thru 157\" (miscellaneous microfiche materials); in Frederick Ford, Report on a Railroad Station Approach and Harbor Front Improvements, prepared for the Mayor and Alder- men (New Haven: City of New Ha 'venj 1912); and in Sidney Withington, New Haven and its Six Railroads, undated Railway and Locomotive Historical Society monograph. (2) Two wooden bridges served from 1798 to 1887 before a cast iron truss bridge (swing span) originally used in rail service over the Housatonic River replaced the second (1842) Tomlinson Bridge span. Tolls were removed in 1886 when the city became owner of the bridge. Design of the current bridge, constructed at a cost of $1,000,000 to the City of New Haven, was essen- tially completed in 1917. -2- P-M W W W W @V\" RAIL FACILITIES gqT o__- Main line to New York Pg. - Canal line Main line to north & east Manufacturers rr 7@ Belle dock spur 60 Main line to Boston 19,CommericX I .1 L:1 T IU \"0 p ineric n S@a ce TER-, T , 71, _L4 HAVEN! effliall N -Arnerical A BOR H A J@@gh aldy % /k I HAVE@ Z, S pace pen Space Y G LO@G ,,,ISL\"A.ND SOUND.

East shore sites with favorable long-term maritime potential depend on rail movement to and from the west shore. New Haven's waterfront petroleum storage capacity is. concentrated in east shore areas; it depends on rail service which is fundamentally more expensive to provide and has been -subject to substan- tial interruption (Figure 2) .(3) Unreliable service and high cost movement preclude major rail shipments like those of Wyatt Fuel on the west shore. Dry cargo handling capabilities and storage capacity are similarly focused on the east shore at the 45 year old New Haven Terminal .(4) New Haven Terminal's near-term expansion -on to an adjacent 43 acre former U.S. Steel site enhances the long-term rail freight market.(5) Right- of -Way The 1982 rail service reorganization process encouraged by the New England Rail Services Adt of 1981 left Conrail in continued control,of all main line and most spur facilities in the New Haven area.(6) Conrail ownership and exclusive operating rights to the two Belle Dock tracks linking New Haven Harbor to the Amtrak main line (one mile) and the Cedar Hill Yards 3.3 miles away remain intact (Figure 2). Conrail Belle Dock service' obligations were extended through early 1986 and a (1) New Haven City Plan Department, Petroleum Storage for New Haven Harbor: Waterfront Versus Inland (New Haven: City Plan, 1980), pp. 59-61. (4) TAD Jones' (coal) 1940 purchase of the former New Haven Silk Mills building (constructed in 1921) began the consolidation of the New Haven Terminal. (5) New Haven @cquired the 43 acre property at a cost of $2,250,000 in mid-1983. A $2.0 million demolition and site improvement program began in late 1983. State \"Municipal Development Project\" aid ($1.1 million), City resources ($750,000) -and a $2.4 million New Haven Terminal purchase price will help fund the $4.3 million program. New Haven Terminal will acquire the site in mid-to-late 1984. (6) Belle Dock spur facilities were addressed as \"New Haven Station\"--all rail properties within the corporate limits of the-City of New Haven. See: Special Court Regarding the Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, Order Approving and Directing the Consummation of Expedited Supplemental Transactions, April 13, 1982. Canal Line ownership was transferred to the Boston & Maine Railroad per a joint Conrail/B&M proposal. Conrail agreed to forego branch line surcharges in Connecticut during the four year term of tlie agreement. 1-10 MI V N..

(7) Railroads and shippers encounter right-of-way constraints which limit east shore loads and raise unit costs. Constraints include- poor east shore curvature. Curvature and, to a lesser extent, light weight rail, restrict both car size and train length. Maximum car lengths on the east shore are restricted to 50 feet in contrast to 65 foot care that can be brought from the Cedar Hill Yards to Belle Dock and on to Wyatt Fuel tracks. Fifty foot car lengths suffice for many common commodities but prove inefficient for light den- sity goods (see Part 3). Sharp curves at Belle Dock--Forbes Avenue (22 degrees or 260 feet), Forbes Avenue- -Water front Street (40 degrees or 143 feet) and Forbes Avenue--U.S. Steel (38 degrees or 151 feet) limit train lengths (Table 1). For all practical purposes, the advent of 50-foot freight cars made New Haven Terminal and the U.S. Steel site inaccessible to multi-car trains. a 200,000 pound per car weight limit on the Tomlinson Bridge. Current 200,000 pound (car plus load) weight limits on the Tomlinson Bridge were imposed by the Connecticut Department of Transportation--- the owner of the bridge. original (1917) bridge plans and specifications sought to accomodate then current 200,000 pound cars although design assumptions may have overstated structural capabili- ties. Contemporary freight cars with 200,000 pound loads carry only 60 to 75 percent of the effective payload otherwise accomodated within the bounds pre- scribed by the Association of American Railroads' 263,000 pound interline weight maximum. relatively severe grades. Grade, curvature and engine capabilities have his- torically limited the load or \"string\" of cars that can be carried across the bridge. Engines approaching Forbes Avenue must overcome grade, load, curvature and inertia--they start without the benefit of perceptible momentum.

East Street spur clearances are not unduly restrictive rela- tive to commodities and freight cats. A 16-foot Belle Dock clearance restriction at Chapel Street (west track) controls the *vertical dimension when both east and west tracks are operative (Figure 3). ' Low speeds which control 'Nlobble\" can bring cars to within two to. three inches of overhead obstructions. Common box, gondola and tank cars share a 15-foot 6-inch height. Only \"high cube\" equipment (circa 10,000 cubic foot box cars) effective for light weight products is pro- hibited. Seventeen-foot, 6-inch \"high cube\" cars are occasionally received at Cedar Hill-Yards. . miscellaneous track and road bed Rr blems.- Sporadic maintenance and years of 2 minimal right-of-way investment account for: (1) frequent flooding at Chapel Street which requires pumping. Winter icing conditions prove difficult (time consuming) to combat; (2) uneven roadbed-. -particularly adjacent to Wyatt Fuel receiving tracks-which results in derailments. Wyatt renews ties and ballast at 10-year intervals while no comparable Conrail maintenance on adjacent tracks is offered;(9) and (3) trolley type switches and,tr .acks on both the Manufactur-. erts Railroad spur and on the Belle Dock extension. Maintenance requires scav- aging and/or handcrafted repair. Rails embedded in Forbes Avenue without proper ballast or ties generally maintain alignment. If disturbed, both- ties and heavier rail will be necessary. A combination of larger, more cost effective rail- equipment and aging rail facilities have gradual- ly eroded the east shore rail market. (8) Series 800 and 900 diesels supplanted electric engines after World War II. Retired steam engines (125,000 pound K class \"Moguls\") @used elsewhere in the New Haven system for pre- WW Il switching could not be used at Belle Dock due to long wheelbases.

(Not to scale) Service to the Harbor Conrail continues to offer weekday \"as needed\" service to both Belle Dock and the east shore despite a high cost service environment. Approximately 4,000 loaded cars (in plus out) moved through Belle Dock as recently as 1978 with 600 cars bound for the east side of the harbor.(10) Wyatt Fuel (approximately 2,300 annual cars) is clearly the dominant shipper--often generating 100 tank cars a week during the peak winter season when Millstone's nuclear fuel generating plant is off-line and oil is shipped to Northeast Utilities' West Springfield and Holyoke gene- rating* stations. Other major shippers include the New Haven Register which ships newsprint to a Davis Street warehouse; the Southern Connecticut Gas Company which receives liquid propane during the heating season; Dupont's River Street facility and Excello at New Haven Terminal.( Somewhat less freight now moves over the Tomlinson Bridge in the absence of U.S. Steel (formerly 260 cars a year) and Pittsburgh Plate Glass (100 cars annually) east shore facilities.(12) Current operations: move all cars from Cedar Hill as one \"cut\" --switching at Belle Dock as necessary. Cars moving over the Tomlinson Bridge are switched as a \"block.\" Only Wyatt ships a sufficient number of cars to arrive as block from Cedar Hill. Wyatt cars are blocked in units of six since Wyatt's sidings accomodate a maximum of six cars each. Car storage at Belle Dock did not represent a problem during the high volume era. Movement into and out of Belle Dock was managed to balance demand. use relatively light (200,000 pound) SWI class switching engines (8400 and 8500 series) because of ConnDOT-imposed weight limits. Heavier 260,000 pound switch- ing engines which develop \"adhesion\" equal to about 25 percent of their weight at low speed can provide about 60 percent more \"tractive effort\"--effective pulling (10) New Haven City Plan Department.

Service is provided over the bridge between 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM without any particular attention to competing vehicular traffic needs. Vehicular traffic is stopped by a flag to permit trains to enter Forbes Avenue. Two-way traffic is resumed while a train crosses the Quinnipiac River and traffic is stopped again when the train returns to its own right-of-way. \"block\" (arrange) cars relative to Federal Railroad Administration high haz- ard shipping restrictions. Cars transporting corrosive or combustible pro- ducts to the east shore often require a spacer behind the engine. Spacers limited curvature and poor track increase the pos*sibility of-d6railment.(11) Weight and operating restrictions establish a high cost switching environment. One-at-a-time movement slows operations and raises costs. Seventy minutes are required for each one-way car round trip to the east shore. Daily service between Belle Dock and New Haven Terminal is limited to six cars (each way, twelve movements).(14) High switching costs limit the contribution of (13) Federal Railroad Administration high hazard shipping requirements established in Title 49, CFR, Parts 171, 1720 173, 174 and 179. Cars carrying products categorized as explosives (explosives A), poison gases, combusitbles and radioactive materials cannot be placed next to an engine. '\"High hazard\" cars are normally placed \" ... not nearer than the sixth car from the engine...\" Tomlinson Bridge one-at-a-time constraints dictate the use of \"spacers\" for selected commodities including flammable liquids (not petroleum), gases, corrosive materials (including caustics) and certain non-flammable gases. (14) Seven working hours during 8: 00 AM and 4: 00 PM without overtime. Conrail necessarily leaves cars on a \"run around\" track at New Haven Terminal because curves on sidings are too limited for Conrail engines. A New Haven Terminal owned and operated \"donkey engine\" moves each car to a siding. New Haven Terminal sidings can accomodate about 55 cars at a time.

(15) Conrail views the east shore service in terms of marginal or avoidable costs vs. average revenue--not in terms of marginal revenue earned from the service which might not other- wise be gained. See Conrail, \"Belle Dock Economic Study\" (November, 1978). -9- 3. DESIGN PARANETERS Shippers and railroads share burdens imposed by an outmoded physical plant. Unreliable east shore service and' limited payload capabilities prevent terminal operators from quoting competitive rates for products most economically shipped to and from the port by rail. Short range marketing plans cannot dismiss the possibility of a surcharge. A high cost operating environment makes rail ser- vice equally unattractive to railro@ds. Cars and.CoMModities(16) Competition and efficiency require local shippers to use the largest possible cars subject to weight limits,.product density and car size constraints. Progressively larger freight cars intro- duced over the .1900 to 1960 period have established a 263,000 pound North American inter-line weight limit (weight on rail)--a capacity of up to 100-tons (Figure 4). A voluntary decision to restrict normal interchange movements to cars of 100-ton capacity or less is likely to persist. Further weight increases are generally considered to have a strong negative impact on rail and wheel wear. Extremely large cars have tended to become the industry s tandard- -particularly for bulk commoditie's (Table 2 and Appendix A). Current 50 foot (length) cars capable of reaching the Cedar Hill Yards can typically carry twice the effective weight and 1.5. to two times the bulk of World War II era equipment (Table 3). Eighty-five percent of all tank cars are now at least 14 feet high, 20 per- cent are at least 70 feet long, and a third carry at least 22,000 gallons. Similarly, 90 percent of covered hoppers are at least 14 feet high, 10 percent are more than 70 feet long, and 20 percent can carry more than 5,000 cubic feet of material. A variety of freight car configurations allow shippers to maximize weight and volume--to move a loaded car as close to 263,000 pounds as possible. Local Needs: Typical,east coast equipment capable of reaching the Cedar Hill Yards can complement the port's (16) National overview per A. 9. Little, Inc., Issues and Dimemsions of Freight Car Size: 'A Compendium, prepared for the U.S. Federal Railroad Administration (Washington: FRA, 1980). _10- specialized handling capabilities.(17) High volume commodities now moving through the port (oil, lumber, scrap and cement) can make efficient use ot 40- to 60-foot long cars with 140,000 to 200,000 pound load carrying capacities (Tables 4 amd 5). Products of potential significance in- cluding soft coal and caustic soda can similarly make good use of conventionally-sized equipment. Out-sized cars (beyond 65-feet long) designed to carry specialized manufactured goods need not be accomodated by the local rail system. Design Requirements Freight car configurations and loads establish alignment and structural requirements for local facilities--particularly for the Tomlinson Bridge. Weight and Loading: Evenly distributed loads (uniform loading) and standard 100-ton truck dimensions (5 feet, 10 inches between wheel centers) establish axle loadings for shear and moment (bending action) on a superstructure-they define the extent of support necessary to make a facility like the Tomlinson Bridge useful. Dense products (cement, scrap and coal) and short (40 to 50 foot) cars present maximum loads on key-bridge elements (Figure 5). Multi-car trains composed of 263,000 pound cars and a 252,000 pound locomotive will load (produce greatest reactions on) successive sections rel- ative to axle arrangement and Tomlinson Bridge design elements (Appendix C).(18) Cars rather than engines tend to control due to weight and axle arrangements. Reactions produce a maximum moment on span I approximately 26 feet from the west abutment (2,570 foot kips). \"load\" the cantilever in span 2 with two axles at the end of the cantilever and two axles on an adjacent \"hung\" girder (3,590 foot kips). (17) Historic petroleum handling commitments, limited land area, a decline in heavy manufacturing and proximity to New York and Boston define the port's role.

Curvature: operating and maintenance needs establish Conrail's normal minimum 12 degree 30 minute (459 foot) curves as practical limits despite the ability of both coupled 60-foot cars and 60-foot/40-foot car combinations to negotiate more restrictive curves.(19) Reasonable curves will for all practical purposes eliminate car-length and train-length restrictions in the New Haven - environnient-- they create flexible operating conditions. Fif- teen 60-foot cats could readily be accomodated. keep track maintenance within reasonable bounds. More severe curves and heavy cars would wear rail away prematurely. permit reasonable multi-car switching speeds on the spur track. Performance Grades and curves which have historically limited harborside switching operations will continue to control despite improvements. Rail capabilities are fixed by relationships between load, trac- tive effort (or engine pulling power) and right-of-way. About 25 percent of an engine's weight is available as tractive effort. Tractive effort consumed overcoming grades and curves is unavail- able for productive purposes--for payloads. (19) Coupled 60-foot cars could conceivably negotiate a 260 (222 foot) radius and coupled 60-foot--40-foot 'cars might accept a 254 foot radius. Coupled cars of unequal length require milder curves. See Table 1. -16- Joint effects 'of grades and curves control as eastbound trains transition from Belle Dock to Forbes Avenue and westbound trains leave Water Street (Table 6 and Appendix B). Eastbound trains confronted with both a 1.4 percent grade as they move out onto Forbes Avenue and a 2.3 percent grade in adjacent tangent sections could not be longer than eight to mielve cars de- pending upon load (Figure 7 and Table.7).(20) Westbound engines confronted with more favorable conditions could trail between twelve and sixteen cars. (20) Assuming \"improved\" 12030' curves, an adhesion factor of 20 to 25 percent li mits low speed tractive-effort available from a 1500 hp, 252,000 pound SW 1500 locomotive likely to be used by Conrail. A 25 percent adhesion factor produces 61,500 pounds (maximum) of tractive- effort at low speeds; e.g. in the seven to 10 mph range. Tractive-effort loss associated with acceleration in the zero to ten mile per hour range over a two to three hundred foot section is negligible; ranging between 1,600 and 3,200 pounds. -17- Table 6: Necessary Engine Weight-- WEST SHORE APPROACH West Shore Approach.

THE TONLINSON BRIDGE World War I 'era City of New Haven design efforts for the current Tomlinson Bridge sought to bal- anc6 vehicular, rail freight and navigation requirements. Design efforts produced a combination of fill, 215-foot symmetrical Tomlinson Bridge approaches and twin 88-foot long double-leaf bascule spans to bridge the 1,000 foot wide Quinnipiac River (Figure 8). Key Design Elements Major design elements include (Table 8) � individual approach spans consisting of variable-depth steel girders. � a deck system of structural concrete slab supporting a concrete ballast in which railroad ties and tracks are embedded. � a deck surface of asphalt overlay replacing the original roadway surface of creosoted paving blocks. � four interior girders on approaches oriented so that each girder supports the wheel loads from one train of a two-track rail system. � a double-leaf bascule at mid-channel consisting of four (4) variable-depth girders supporting trussed and/or solid floor beams with an open steel grating system. The two (2) interior bascule girders support 80 percent of the rail loading from a two-track rail system. limited clearance over the Quinnipiac River. The low level bridge provides a 12-foot mid-channel clearance above mean high water when closed. a tight knit pile pattern. 'Major rail \"loading\" problems are posed by the superstructure. A dense pile pattern suggests that the substructure should easily accomodate increased demands generated by heavier, multi-car trains.

Peak hour Quinnipiac Bridge congestion and limited east-west travel options once again focus attention on U.S. 1.(Forbes Avenue) as an alternative harbor crossing.(22). Collisions, Reeair,s and Regulati Recent (1973-1979) barge collisions with the Tomlinson Bridge have resulted in (Table 9) a new fender system (Table 10). Gear mechanisms are now fully protected against all but head-on (bow first) hits. improvements which permit bascule leafs to reach an almost perpendicular position when raised. original counterweight. construction failed to meet U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit guidelines. Neither counterweight design nor density allowed the bascules to be raised to a position of more than 70 degrees relative to the water. Limited vertical clearance effec- tively reduced channel width. Large vessels could not make use of the full 120-foot channel. Similarly, fender systems could not fully protect lift spans. Three- ear old Coast Guard regulations intended to protect the Bridge recognize navigation prob- lems.(M) Regulations limit movement of large vessels relative to tide and wind, specify towing (21) Wilbur Smith and Associat es, A Comprehensive Traffic Improvement Plan for the City of 'New Have (New Haven: WSA, 1954).

The abutment. face has cracked and the northeast wing-wall has rotated several inches (out of plumb) (Figure 10A). A shear crack in the abutment face extending to the water line suggests that both rotation and the crack are due to underwater settlement of piers.. A similar shear in the abutment face is evident where the southeast wing-wall has rotated and \"pulled\" the approach retaining wall with it--at the point where the southeast retaining wall joins the east end of the east abutment (Figures 10B and C). some failure in the vest abutment. A shear crack at the north end of the vest abutment (10D) and, as above' rotation in the wing-wall (10E) suggest loss of support'. Footings and/or'piles have failed. failure of Pier 2 on the west approach. Cracks are evident on both the east (23) (Cont.) exceeds 20 knots or 23 miles per hour; and (3) towing stern..first on a howser (rela- tively difficult to control). in addition: (1) vessels with a beam (width at maximum point) of more that 50 feet must be pushed under the bridge; (2) a lookout is required under cer- tain conditions; and (3) bj@irges departing the Mill River must leave in daylight, be pushed bow first and have a *second tug standing by to assist at the bow. See 33 CFR Part 128 in Federal Register volume 46, No. 20, November 16, 1981. (24) Stone and underwater (unexposed) piers should have virtually indefinite lives. _25- ilia 'n A Figure 10: Substructure Problems. Major signs of distress include rotation of the northeast wingwall at the east abutment (A); displacement of the southeast wingwall (east abutment) (B and C); shear in west abutment (D); ro tation of northwest wingwall (E); and shear cracks through bo th faces of pier 2 on the east approach (F and G). IWTi and west face of the pier--they suggest foundation and/or pile failure due to loads (Figures 1OF and G). Underwater inspection t4ill probably reveal a crack in the concrete below the stouework. Significantly, cracks appear between girders which support rails. Distress is limited. Positive indications i nclude the absence of settlement in approach piers other than Pier 2, no visual distress in the bascule piers and generally good condition of major steel girders encased in gunite.(25) Major substructure units including the approaches appear salvageable. Latent Problems: Rehabilitation efforts through the 1970's accomplished only those repairs necessary to restore and/ or maintain service. Damage by barges, mechanical problems with the lift mechanism and pockets of deterioration were addressed. Incremental responses failed to address major long-term rehabilitation needs basic to highway and rail performance. A comprehensive rehabilitation program which minimizes periodic service disruptions must address known substructure failures (above) and the condition of key elements including the live load anchorage and supports (Figure 6). Live load anchorages encased in concrete within bascule piers are not subject to visual inspection. The condition of steel embedded in concrete below the pit floor is of major impor- tance. Anchorages accept and resist the load applied to the bascules in a closed position--they-set on bearing elements (assembly) of the live load sup- port. Flaws in the live load anchorage can have a major impact on the econo- mics of rehabilitation. Aiain trunnions (Figure 6). A collar, pin and support system permit bascules .to rotate. Wear must be addressed. the counterweight system. Concerns include counterweight trunnion bearings, existing bronze bushings, counterweight truss hangers, and the steel truss support system embedded in the counterweight. deteriorated steel in the-counterweight pit and deteriorated support coluums. (25) Recently exposed steel appears in good condition--suggesting that gunite has been effective. -26- Design Limits: Original (1917) design decisions will impact rehabilitation costs if the facility is to accomodate contemporary rail equipment. Decisions reflected in original plans and specifications assumed high performance steel. Design plans are premised upon steel with a flexural tensile strength of 24,000 pounds per square inch (the ability to re-assume shape without damage). Design plans premised upon American Railway Engineering Association (AREA) codes of the 1920's generally assumed a 16,000 pound per square inch allowable stress standard. Only exacting quality control could have gained a 24,000 pound per square inch capability at the time. A more conservative assumption would have produced a more conservative design offering greater long-term flexibility. Less costly measures to accomodate heavier cars might have been possible. Contemporary designs intended to accomodate loads of 24,000 pounds per square inch would select steel with an ultimate stress of at least 60,000 pounds per square inch. understate live load impact attributable to rail cars. Thirty-three foot (33') World War I era rail freight cars established \"design\" vehicles. Associated impact estimates (dynamic force), reflected in specifications were significantly below those then in common use.(26) Heavier Cars: Limited design margins reinforce the Connecticut De artment of Transportation's decision to adhere to a 2001,000 pound maximum weight for rail cars.(27@ Comtemporary 263,000 pound cars in multi- (26) City of New Haven, Department of Public Works, Specifications, Forms of Contracts and Bonds for Tomlinson Bridge Over the Quinnipiac.

(27) A quick check of existing sections by Seelye, Stevenson, Value and Knecht. increased loads associated with heavier equipment broadly suggest whether stresses in steel remain within original 24,000 psi design values. -27- car units would (Figure 11)(28) . overs tress track girders by about 15 percent in key areas of the fixed approach span (Appendix C). . overstress track girders in the catilever section between Pier 1 and the beginning of the hung span leading to Pier 2 by about 15 percent.

Stress in the negative moment area (cantilever) of the track girders appears to be less than the allowable original design stress of 24,000 pounds per square inch. overstress track girders in fixed approach span three by about 15 per- cent in the maximum positive moment area. 0 verstress the 23 foot, *10 inch long hung track girders in the center span between approach piers by about 30 percent. overstress interior bascule girders supporting the double tracks by about 15 percent.

A limited stress check of main members: (1) adopted design parameters which included the original (assumed) tensile design stress of 24,000 psi although, as noted in the text, a tenuous assumption;.(2) drew impact factors from the current AREA code for diesel engines; and (3) used gross sections (not net sections) to check support capabilities of the main track girders. The design check proceeded-exclusive of fatigue considerations. Calculations appear in 'Appendix C. -28- 5. ALTERNATIVES Major new construction in the densely developed harbor area is exp .ensive and disruptive. Opportu- nities to use existing facilities, minimize investment and effect joint highway--rail use recommend rehabilitation of the Tomlinson Bridge. An improved bridge and approaches can accomodate major freight car traffic, offer railroads an attractive operating environment and allow area shippers to compete effectively. Good service can be offered to customers along Forbes Avenue, to New Haven Terminal's current Waterfront Street facility and to the Terminal's new site north of Forbes Avenue. New River Crossings Single track rail crossings within 1,000 feet of the Tomlinson Bridge confront similar operating, right-of-way and construction constraints (Figure 12).(29) Limited advantages inherent in an exclusive rail right-of-way are largely offset by huge capital costs and the necessity of at least one at-grade crossing of Forbes Avenue regardless of alignment. Major investment necessary to meet higbway needs can be meshed with rail requirements. Exclusive Alignment--Benefits are Limited Here: Spee Benefits of high speed movement on an exclusive rail right-of-way are largely offset in the harbor area where a 10 mile per hour switching speed generally prevails and distances are short. A multi-car train crossing the Tomlinson Bridge at 10 miles per hour takes only two to three minutes to cover the 1,600 feet between Belle Dock and Water Street (Table 11) .(30) (29) Options advanced over the past ten years are collated and addressed in: Connecticut De- partment of Transportation, The Tomlinson Bridge Rail Link (Wethersfield: ConnDOT, 1980). (30) For example, from the time an eastbound engine enters Forbes Avenue to the time the last car moves from Forbes Avenue on to Water Street. One car operations moving slowly against vehicular traffic take almost four minutes to cover the same distance. Single car 11consists\" shuttling back and forth would inhibit vehicular movement. Multi-car trains which period- ically make exclusive use of the bridge in off-peak hours are compatible with the traffic flow needs. Traffic control plans which restrict vehicular access would have to be devised. -29- @L Wo C \"@@h q'4 LOW, 111@% A A J@ A?- r...

Train related rail wear is a function of traffic volumes, speed, axle leadings, curvature, grade, ballast and surface corrosion (low density lines). Rail demand and steel-on-steel friction control rail life to a far greater extent than auto and truck movement. Modern installations techniques can provide a good environment for track embedded in Forbes Avenue (Figure 13). Alignment New river crossings will be disruptive. Even a new span immediately north of the existing facility (Alternative E) will come perilously close to the historic Yale Boat House and clearly interfere with parking arrangements (Figure 14). More significant departures from the'existing alignment will: largely preempt redevelopment of Conrail's four acre west shore switching yard north of the Wyatt Fuel Company's main facility; re- ,quire a long, relatively costly clear span to maintain an unobstruc- ted channel; limit flexibility at Gulf oil's east shore property; and require a reverse movement to serve the Quinnipiac River Indus- trial Park (Alternative C). offer only a single track service north of'the Quinnipiac River if an approach provided by the old Manufacturerts Railroad were em- ployed. Narrow right-of-way limit's operating flexibility. Light rail and poor track condition would require immediate replacement of 3,600 feet of rail between Chapel Street and Alton Street; an at- grade crossing of Chapel Street would be necessary in contrast to the\"grade separation on the Belle Dock spur; right-of-way would nec- essarily infringe upon recreational facilities at Quinnipiac Park; and the alignment would make shore front access difficult to main- tain at both Texaco and Mobil properties. Limited switching capa- bilities-at the main line now rule out a multi-car movement via the east shore of the Mill Rover. Switching arrangements require trains moving-soutfi on the main line from the Cedar Hill Yards to reverse on to the East Street spur, move north to the short Rockware spur (formerly the Federal Paperboard Company) and then reverse again EAST STREET SPUR Track, ties and ballast along the East street spur are ade- quate for slow speed switching operations.

AN INLAND APPROACH An abandoned three mile rail right-of-way leaves the Amtrak mainline just behind New Haven Terminal's East Haven Tank Farm (14), parallels Warwick Street (15) and crosses Lenox Street (16) before turning north (17) and away from the harbor. Long distance petroleum lines now occupy the right-of-way (18). The right-of-way F- T rises 50 feet above the Quinnipiac River at Lenox Street (19 looking down from the former rail facility). New rail structure extending over Ferry Street to the former U.S. Steel site (20 from the Ferry Street Bridge) would run counter to A city policies which have helped create Brewery Square (21 and 22) and new parkland along the river (23 and 24). 18 J, A 17 19 Figure 14 (Cont.): Facilities and the Environment.

A former three mile spur linking the Amtrak main line and old Fair Haven industrial areas provides an interesting, but ultimately disappointing, alternative to a Quinnipiac River crossing. An abandoned inland right-of-way now accomodating long distance petroleum lines (Jet Lines) leaves the main line immediately behind the New Haven Terminal's East Haven tank farm and extends west to and under Quinnipiac Avenue before turning north or away from key harbor areas. Inland service would: eliminate economies stemming from joint use of west shore facilities. One-way movement from the Cedar Hill Yards to Water Street (the east shore) would require about 20 minutes and serve only east shore desti- nations (Figure 16). Opportunities to share west shore maintenance and capital costs would similarly be lost. Only an extremely high Cedar Hill to east shore interchange would make major inland invest- ment worthwhile. Meeting needs of moderate-to-low east shore traffic would become relatively expensive. . need new switching facilities in East Haven wetland areas (Polywog Pond) to avoid a reverse movement on the main line. . require major unattractive structure in the Grand Street--Quinnipiac area.

Structure clearing-Ferry Street at 21 feet (offering a minimal 2.5 percent grade for rail) would extend almost 1,600 feet along the river front.(32) Major structure through low lying river front areas precludes serious attention to an inland route. Long-term efforts in Quinnipiac River shoreline areas between Ferry Street and Grand Avenue are reflected in construction at Brewery Square (Figure 14), a new riverfront park immediately north of Brewery Square and extensive private rebabilitati 'on of adjacent properties. A rail structure would prove disruptive, visually intrusive and inconsistent with long-term development policies Cost Ordef of magnitude cost estimates reinforce the desirability of meeting contemporary rail needs via an improved Tomlinson Bridge. Capital Costs- High \"over the water\" construction costs work against mew river crossings (Table 12). Options involving long spans (900--1,000 feet) of the Quinnipiac River tend toward the high end of the cost spectrum exclusive of associated right-of-way requirements. Major shorefront right-of-way acquisition (Alternative C) pushes the cost of a new southerly crossing toward the $30 million level. Immediate and extensive rail replacement needs along the Manufacturer's Spur bring costs associated with Alternative D into the $25 million dollar range. In contrast, reinforcing key Tomlinson Bridge structural elements and acquiring limited east shore right-of-way for improved curvature can be accomplished for circa seven million dollars in concert with a sorely needed $10 to $12 million dollar Tomlinson Bridge rehabilitation project. A comprehensive rehabilita- tion project addressing both rail and highway operating needs should be initiated at an early date. (32) A 21 foot clearance necessary for an acceptable rail grade versus a@circa 14 foo t highway (truck) clearance requirement.

Maintaining a two to 2.5 percent grade for an \"inland route\" would require almost 1,600 feet of structure in riverfront areas. One or Two Tracks on the Tomlinson Bridge: Bridge design now permits separation of 'each bascule section into independent leafs during main- tenance and repair periods. Single' track rail service can be maintained while one or opposing leafs are repaired. Current designs now load weight.equally on the four identical interior ap- proach girders--each girder absorbs 50 percent o 'f the weight of each track (Figure-9). Dual ser- vice on approaches will require strengthening of,all four girders versus the center pair associated with single track operations. Bdscule sections present a more difficult trade--@off. Two interior bascule girders receive 80 percent of. the load generated by respective tracks. Introducing a new single track with heavy rail cars will decrease stress on each\"of the interior bascule girders-- presenting substantial economies during re 'habilitation. Conversely, major new section.properties on all bascule elements will be necessary to accomodate a dual track system. Comprehensive bridge rehabilitation, good maintenance and new stringent navigation rules can minimize, but not eliminate, the risk of substantial-service loss. only two tracks offerinsurance against a major service interruption. Early, in-depth design can establish marginal costs inheren t in a two,track option. Long-Term Costs: New capabilities can make rail more attractive to both shippers and railroads (Table 13). Current \"one at a time\" movement over the Tomlinson Bridge.incurs high direct costs (labor and mechanical). Long-term \"bottom line\" costs inherent in alternate tail service schemes are shaped by a mix of capital, maintenance and operating requirements (Appendix D). Multi-car operating economies are significant as east shore loads move from present 600 car levels to circa 2,000 annual car move- ments. Relative gains fall off beyond the 2,000 car level--largely because more than one daily run from-the Cedar.Hill Yards-to the harbor becomes necessary. Switching engines operating between the yards and the harbor can draw about twenty trailing cars. Current west shore demand'at 3,400 cars per year and east shore 2,000 car traffic levels exceed average daily twenty cars single consist capabilities--another run becomes necessary. -j4- CRUDE COST ESTIMATES Cost in Thousands Element Tomlinson Bridge A B C E HEAVY RAIL NEEDS S /0 TOMLINSON INLAND ROUTE 1000'S /0 TOMLINSON MANUFACTURERSRR N10 TOMLINSON Capital Cos t bridge over river with causeway $ -- $5,000 $ 675 $12,938 S -- $ -- $1,300 S20,750 $ 900 @15,753 $ 750 $13,875 bridge on land -- 2,600 3,900 -- - -- -- -- on fill with retaining walls 300 285 -- -- 450 428 650 618 300 28@ relocate fu el pipeline -- 5,300 530 - -- =jor re aIigo.ent and new switching -- -- 8,800 1,980 -- -- -- -- -- -- only new or impro ved rail 3,300 743 3,150 709 - -- 3,150 --- 709 6,775 3,024 2,900 153 subtotal construction $5,743 q13 :932 $6,410 @21,88 $19 395 $14 design and construction supervision 1,434 3 483 1,602 5 : 84 87 2 4:843 3:'70', right-0 f-way ---54 154 367 Total Capitol Cost $7,231 S17,569 $9,540 528,526 S24,581 $19,317 Table 12: Associated Costs.

B-4 Appendix C Seelle, Stevenson, Value and Knecht Materials Appendix C contains: . SSVK's February, 1934 memo summarizing Tomlinson Bridge structural problems; and . SSVK's working notes which broadly suggest the inability of the existing Tomlinson Bridge to support 263,000 pound rail cars. \"Unchecked\" SSVK materials are offered correlate with the planning orLentation of this effort. Worksheets pertain to: sheet 1: the general orientation of rail vehicles. sheets 2 and 3: span 2. sheets 6 thru 8: the cantilever between pier 1 and the adjacent hung span. sheets 9 and 10: span I between the abutment and pier 1. sheets 10 and 11: span 3. sheets BC1 thru BG9: the bascules. Tomlinson Bridge Over Quinnipiac River Description of Site The Tomlinson Bridge Structure on Forbes Avenue spanning the Quinnipiac River in New Haven is on a tangent roadway alignment within the structure limits. It is a state road (Route 1) which accommodates rail traffic as well as ve- hicular traffic. The bridge structures consists of three fixed spans at each approach to a dou- ble leaf bascule span placed at mid-channel. The approach spans consist of variable depth steel girders designed to accommodate a twenty four (24) foot hung span at the center span of each approach. The present deck system con- sists of a structural concrete deck slab supporting a concrete ballast in which the railroad ties and tracks are embedded. The deck surface has asphalt overlay replacing the original roadway surface of creosoted paving blocks. The four (4) interior girders are so oriented that each girder supports the wheel loads from one train on a two track rail system. The double leaf bascule at mid-channel consist of four (4) variable depth girders supporting trussed and/or solid floor beams with an open steel grat- ing floor system. The grating is supported by steel stringers and a transverse channel support system. The two (2) interior bascule girders support eighty (80) percent of the rail loading from a two track rail system. A limited design check by Seelye, Stevenson, Value, and Knecht was made of the existing structure to see if the present structure could possibly support heavier car loadings. In researching the original design it appears certain liberties had been taken in setting the design parameters, such as: 1. The flexural tensile stress of 24,000 lbs. per square inch was used for design although the A.R.E.A.. Codes in the 1920's used d 16,000 lbs. per square inch allowable. Today higher unit stress can be used by A.R.E.A. Code based on the ultimate strength and minimum yield point strength of the high strength steel used. In those days the use of these higher design stresses without pro- per quality control in manufacture is questionable. 2. The impact factor diagram for 200,000 lb. cars in the 1922 -Tomlinson Design Specifications provides impact percentages much less than the A.R.E.A. Code of the time; leading to a less conservative design for this railway structure. As stated above, an in-depth design analysis of the existing structure could not be done within the time frame and monies allotted for this check. A basic check of the major structu- ral supports of both the approach structures and bascule span was made utilizing the dead load moments from the existing 1916 Contract drawings and moments from a proposed 252,500# Engine with 263,00011 rail cars. The design paramenters used for checking the existing structure for the above train loading were: I .The original tensile design stress of 24,000 lbs. per square inch was used as the maximum allowable stress (although we question its origiual use). 2. Impact factors from the current A.R.E.A. Code for diesel engines were used for the design check with new loadi'ngs. 3. Gross sections were used, not net sections, to check support capabilities of the main track girders. (This is only a quick check to see if the increased loadings are close to the maximum allowable design stress limits). 4. Fatigue considerations were not addressed in this limited stress check of main members. Design Check Conclusions Using Heavier Rail Loadings A. In fixed approach span #1, the track girders are over-stressed.approxi- mately 15% in the maximum positive moment area. B. At Pier #1, the stress in the negative moment area (cantilever) of the track girders are over-stressed approximately 15%. C. The hung (23'-10\") track girders in the center span are over-stressed approximately 30%. D. At Pier #2, the stress in the negative moment area (cantilever) of the track girders appear to be less than the allowable original design stress of 24,000 lbs. per square inch. E. In the fixed approach span #3, the track girders are over-stressed approximately 15% in the maximum positive moment area. F. The interior bascule girders supporti'n'g the doubl.e tracks will be over stressed approximately 15% in the maximum cantilever moment area. Conclusions (Limited Investigation): If the present structure has 'not deteriorated in the main support areas of the approach spans, where the structure elements are hidden by a gunite encasement, the existing framing system is still incapable of supporting an increased rail loading. rf 'major deteriorat on is present, it may not be able to-support the .'original\" design loadings.
