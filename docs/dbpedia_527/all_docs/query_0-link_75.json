        "text": "The plan, released last Friday, includes an upgraded New Rochelle station, a new station in Port Chester and more Metro-North and Amtrak service\n\nMore trips, a new Westchester station and new track segments are the local goodies included in the Federal Railroad Administration's ambitious plan to overhaul rail service between Washington, D.C., and Boston.\n\nThe NEC Future plan for the Northeast Corridor, rolled out Dec. 16, backs off some of the bigger plans the agency originally had — like a rail corridor running along Interstate 684 with a station in White Plains that would connect New York City to Hartford — but still has some positives for the Lower Hudson Valley.\n\nNow it's just a question of what happens next — and how to pay for it all.\n\n“That’s what makes this particular region particularly lucky, we have this rail infrastructure that connects nine states and several cities,” said Veronica Vanterpool, the executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign and MTA Board member.\n\nVISION: Feds back plan to speed up Northeast rail service\n\nFARES: Rockland, Westchester speakers mostly silent on MTA fare hike proposal\n\nBRING THEM BACK: Petition calls for MTA to bring back beer carts on Metro-North platforms\n\nFIXES: Metro-North completes Park Avenue viaduct fixes after May fire\n\nThe plan for the entirety of the 400-plus mile Boston-Washington route would upgrade tracks, bridges and tunnels and calls for four tracks throughout most of the system to help ease bottlenecks, expand capacity, enable some trains to reach 220 mph on some stretches, and help cut down on travel times. Passengers from New York to Boston would shave 45 minutes off their travel time, making it in 2 hours and 45 minutes, and New Yorkers headed to Philadelphia could make it in under an hour.\n\nCross-Westchester station\n\nLocally, the FRA said new track segments could have Metro-North trips on the New Haven Line jump from 21 per hour to 32. There could be double, from 21 to 42, the number of NJ Transit trains crossing under the Hudson River each hour. Trips on Amtrak trains would increase to 10 each hour.\n\nIn addition to the new tracks, New Rochelle station would be upgraded and a new Cross-Westchester station would open in Port Chester, due to its proximity to Interstate 287 and the state Department of Transportation's planned bus rapid transit system across the new Tappan Zee Bridge. The Cross-Westchester station would be in addition to Port Chester's existing station. The plan does not give an exact location.\n\nOn top of the bus rapid transit system, the Northeast Corridor future plan pulls in other transportation projects already in the works, including four new Metro-North stations in the Bronx on the New Haven Line slated to open when the line has access to Penn Station, and the Gateway Project's planned trans-Hudson tunnels.\n\nThe Federal Railroad Administration said the project would double ridership by 2040, with regional rail service ridership increasing 20 percent, while helping to boost regional economies.\n\n“These improvements would effectively change how people travel in the Northeast,\" the report says.\n\nWill Trump back the plan?\n\nBut the FRA has not identified any funding and estimates the cost to be between $123 billion and $128 billion. The hope is for \"substantial\" federal, state and local funding, along with other entities, both public and private.\n\nSean Jeans-Gail, the vice president of the National Association of Railroad Passengers, said that the federal government would have to step up, because it's hard for cities and states to come up with the billions to refurbish or build new tunnels or build new track to help straighten out the route, allowing faster trains.\n\n\"I think there are some really good news in terms of the new interest in infrastructure at the federal level with President-Elect (Donald) Trump,\" Jeans-Gail said. \"He understands the power of transportation investment.\n\n“I think he personally benefited from a lot of transportation investment in New York City that he built a lot of real estate around,\" Jeans-Gail added. \"Senate minority leader Sen. (Charles) Schumer is a big infrastructure guy and he’s willing to work across the aisle.”\n\nJeans-Gail said the plan's future would have more clarity once Trump has spent some time in office.\n\n\"“There’s just a lot of uncertainty over the next six to 12 months about what’s happening in infrastructure,\" he said. \"I think we’ll have a lot more clarity … at the end of the first year.\""
