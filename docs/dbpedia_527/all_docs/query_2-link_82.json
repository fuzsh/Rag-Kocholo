We operate over tracks of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR). The LIRR, founded in 1832, is the oldest railroad in North America still operating under its original charter.\n\nIn Brooklyn and Queens, we provide service in freight-only territory to over 40 customers, all but a few of whom were brought online since our start-up in 1997. In Nassau and Suffolk, we serve more than 40 customers and again, most of them were not active rail shippers or receivers prior to our arrival. Since our inception, we have grown our freight volume by 250%. Our service on Long Island operates on tracks shared with the LIRR, America’s busiest commuter railroad system. The New York & Atlantic forms the critical link that connects industries to the entire North American freight railroad network and currently enjoys direct connections to Canadian Pacific, CSX, Norfolk Southern, NYNJ Rail, and Providence & Worcester Railroad. Our customers consist of a diverse group who serve the region’s population needs and, on their behalf, we transport food and beverage, raw materials for manufacturing, construction materials, paper and packaging, machinery and railroad passenger cars, recyclables, and waste."
