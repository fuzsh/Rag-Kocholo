        "meta_description": "Once upon a time the Southern Railway (the original one) used to run regular boat trains from London to meet the cross-channel Newhaven-Dieppe ferries. They built a special station for the these trains on a very short branch from Newhaven Harbour and called it Newhaven Marine. Nowadays this ferry service, though it still runs, is less busy than it used to be. The special trains gradually withered away until there was just a token service left. So did they close the station? No, in Britain closing stations, let alone whole lines, is a long and difficult process. It's often easier to run, say, one train a week over a line and pretend therefore that it has a 'service' rather than have the fag of actually closing it. Such is the case at Newhaven Marine. You can see the platform canopy of Newhaven Marine station in the middle distance. The token train, once a day, in one direction only in the early evening Mon-Fri only (unadvertised!) has just departed and is about to enter Newhaven Harbour station (which has quite frequent trains to Brighton). So it really is a very short branch line indeed! I went down one day specifically to ride on this train, since it is one of the very few lines in Britain (short though it is) I have never been down. So why was I photographing the train rather than riding it? It was because the platform canopy at Marine was in a dangerous state and had been fenced off - rendering the station unusable (or so the driver shouted to me through the fence)!\n\tSo....they were running the token 'service' requiring the use of a train, a two person crew and some electric power....but, err, nobody could use the train!!! Never mind - they had discharged their obligation. This was 2006. As far as I know this train still runs. I haven't had the enthusiasm to go back to see if they've repaired the canopy.\n\tTo add insult to injury the wretched train failed to stop at Harbour station!\n\tIf Lewis Caroll had written this in Alice in Wonderland people would have thought he was being too fanciful.....Only in Britain.......\n\t*LATEST NEWS* (Nov 10) The train no longer runs. However you are entitled to demand a taxi to take you from Newhaven Marine to your destination and bill Network Rail! Note: Please check if there is a limit to the amount they will reimburse you before you ask the cab to take you to Scotland.  Ironically all the glass has now fallen out of the canopy and thus the station is now safe. \n\t*** EVEN LATER NEWS *** (Jan 12). The train DOES run - but you still can't get on it. The fanciful rubbish about taxis still applies.....",
