The only thing showing is a graphic for a stop board at the end of the marine platform.\n\nThe workstation needs updating as the siding wasn’t going to be commissioned for the original go-live. The stop board needs spinning around as you said. Then the run round etc will be controlled by the shutter beyond the boundary gate. That’s my understanding, been a while since I’ve been involved!\n\n19 Jul 2019\n\n#304\n\nDo we know yet which boxes will be deconstructed yet and which will stay, or are they all staying put for time being?\n\nFrom what I read on the BML project, the signalboxes at Newhaven Harbour, Newhaven Town and Lewes will be decommissioned from Thurs 28th November with control passing to the ROC\n\n19 Jul 2019\n\n#305\n\nswt_passenger\n\nVeteran Member\n\nJoined\n\n7 Apr 2010\n\nMessages\n\n31,850\n\nFrom what I read on the BML project, the signalboxes at Newhaven Harbour, Newhaven Town and Lewes will be decommissioned from Thurs 28th November with control passing to the ROC\n\nI think the question was more to do with whether they’d be immediately demolished (deconstructed?) after that date. I reckon most are nowadays.\n\n19 Jul 2019\n\n#306\n\nI think Newhaven Town was to be demolished, Harbour to tranfser to the port authorities, but not sure about Lewes\n\n21 Jul 2019\n\n#307\n\nI visited Tide Mills crossing this weekend. I was amazed at the number of people either crossing without looking to see if the line was clear along with people still crossing despite noticing a train was en route from Bishopstone. By my reckoning, it takes about 45sec for a train starting out from Bishopstone to reach the crossing. A lot of these people were carrying bulky water surf boards and wet gear etc...\n\nI noticed that there was amplification equipment installed adjacent to the crossing for when the train horn sounded so certainly no excuse not to hear it!\n\n25 Jul 2019\n\n#308\n\nSmiker\n\nMember\n\nJoined\n\n12 Jul 2018\n\nMessages\n\n5\n\nNew footbridge to replace 'high risk' rail crossing\n\nAnother article on the plan to replace the Tide Mills crossing\n\nhttps://www.theargus.co.uk/news/17793857.new-footbridge-replace-39-high-risk-39-rail-crossing/\n\n25 Jul 2019\n\n#309\n\nMuch the same as the Sussex paper\n\nThe existing footpath crossing which takes people across the railway line near Tide Mills, south of Newhaven, is the busiest pedestrian crossing in the country\n\nReally!? Do they mean the county...?\n\nAnd as for seeking funding, aren't Network Rail going to pay considering they want the pedestrian crossing closed?\n\n24 Aug 2019\n\n#310\n\nEquipment has arrived at Newhaven Harbour presumably to remove the level crossing over the weekend\n\nOT but 377s are working the Seaford branch today as Brighton are playing at home\n\n25 Aug 2019\n\n#311\n\ntrainmania100\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n8 Nov 2015\n\nMessages\n\n2,576\n\nLocation\n\nNewhaven\n\nCrossing now gone at Newhaven harbour\n\nAttachments\n\nIMG_20190825_150630.jpg\n\n29 Aug 2019\n\n#312\n\ntrainmania100\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n8 Nov 2015\n\nMessages\n\n2,576\n\nLocation\n\nNewhaven\n\nNH 5 sign has been removed from the signal at Newhaven harbour this morning, guessing the signal is also going shortly , replaced by the one a few feet behind it\n\n29 Aug 2019\n\n#313\n\nNH 5 sign has been removed from the signal at Newhaven harbour this morning, guessing the signal is also going shortly , replaced by the one a few feet behind it\n\nThe same happened to the platform signal at Bishopstone last year - only for it to be replaced with a new sign...\n\nI did notice a connection at the far end of the Marine siding to the adjacent new siding but not one at the Lewes end for a loco to run around or exit.

Is there a reason for this?\n\nAccording to the diagram of the planned work, the sidings extend further round into the port (or will do in the near future), I assume the work has lot to be done\n\nhttps://intermodality.com/2019/04/1...etes-first-phase-of-brett-aggregate-railhead/\n\nSee the tracks split into a number of lines on the diagram for the wagons to be split etc. I've requested a larger version of the diagram as I can't make out any of the writing on it\n\n29 Aug 2019\n\n#315\n\nInteresting stuff but... how will the engine run round to take the train away again - unless it is top n' tail which seems like a waste to me?\n\nThis then begs another question...what will happen to the aggregates facility at Newhaven Town once everything is up and running at the Harbour?\n\n29 Aug 2019\n\n#316\n\n30907\n\nVeteran Member\n\nJoined\n\n30 Sep 2012\n\nMessages\n\n18,966\n\nLocation\n\nAiredale\n\nInteresting stuff but... how will the engine run round to take the train away again - unless it is top n' tail which seems like a waste to me\n\nReading the plan as best I can, there are 2 separate crossovers with 141m between fouling points. This leads to 2 loading sidings each for 5x14m wagons.\n\nSo the facioity can take 10 wagon trains at a time.\n\nThe line at the Lewes end is a sort of long headshunt.\n\n31 Aug 2019\n\n#317\n\nswt_passenger\n\nVeteran Member\n\nJoined\n\n7 Apr 2010\n\nMessages\n\n31,850\n\nThis then begs another question...what will happen to the aggregates facility at Newhaven Town once everything is up and running at the Harbour?\n\nJust noticed a paragraph describing the role of the Day’s Aggregates terminal in April Modern Railways. It suggests to me that the facilities don’t actually duplicate each other, AIUI the new terminal in the docks is for loading sea dredged ballast into trains for outgoing transport, the terminal north of Newhaven is mainly for incoming Mendip stone products.\n\n10 Sep 2019\n\n#318\n\ntrainmania100\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n8 Nov 2015\n\nMessages\n\n2,576\n\nLocation\n\nNewhaven\n\nInteresting paths in for Wednesday Thursday Friday this week\n\nFreightliner operated\n\nWednesday https://live.rail-record.co.uk/rail/liverail/full/NEWHVMD/11/9/19\n\nThursday https://live.rail-record.co.uk/rail/liverail/full/NEWHVMD/12/9/19\n\nFriday https://live.rail-record.co.uk/rail/liverail/full/NEWHVMD/13/9/19\n\n0U66 south, 0U67 north.

The ferry was moored on the quayside the other side of the station building so you didn’t have far to go to get on board.\n\nI used to try to make my connection off the Manchester to Newhaven Marine loco hauled service rather than the boat train from London Victoria.\n\nLast time I went to Marine station was during the Sleaford 150 celebrations. There was a steam hauled excursion train that called enroute top and tailed by a Class 33 diesel. No problem being allowed onto the platform."
