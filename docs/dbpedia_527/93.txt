A sad reminder of a once proud station. Marine, the third of Newhaven's stations, once catered to a busy cross channel ferry service. It opened in 1886, originally as Newhaven Harbour (Boat Station), subsequently being renamed Newhaven Marine by British Rail in 1984. It is situated on a stub which leaves the main line to Seaford at the nearby Newhaven Harbour Junction. Although legally still open, it effectively closed in 2006 following damage to the platform canopy roof, which is now deemed 'unsafe'. For a period passengers for Marine were transferred by road from the nearby Harbour station, but since 2010 there have been no advertised services to the station. It is used as a turn back siding from time to time, and was utilised as such on the operating days of the 'Seaford 150' specials in order to provide a path from Newhaven Harbour Junction to Seaford and back for the special train which ran on both 7th & 8th June. The full demise of Newhaven Marine is clearly evident on 8th June 2014 with the platform fenced off and the platform canopy devoid of any covering as Southern Class 313 No. 313212 lays over awaiting a return to Brighton whilst RTC's 'Seaford 150' occupies the EMU's normal path to Seaford.
