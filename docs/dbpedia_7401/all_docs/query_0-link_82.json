        "text": "Sonyâs Xperia P and U were unveiled amidst a lot of fanfare at the Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona. Now, weâve got the price tags of these handsets, too. According to Xperiablog , the Xperia P will be priced at â¬449, which means it will be approximately close to Rs. 29,631. Obviously, taxations and other factors come into play, so though the pricing may not be accurate, it may hover around the 30K margin. However, we might see the price drop by a bit, if the Indian version of the phone comes without NFC. At the moment, though, the Xperia P definitely seems like one expensive handset.Â\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is a look at the highlighted features of the Sony Xperia P:\n\nAndroid 2.3 Gingerbread\n\n1GHz dual-core processor\n\n4-inch Reality Display powered by Mobile BRAVIA Engine\n\nWhiteMagic display technology\n\n8MP camera with fast capture, HD recording, 2D and 3D panoramic images capture capability\n\nHDMI, DLNA\n\nNFC\n\nWill be available in silver, black and red\n\nXperia P and U - worth a buy?\n\nThe second smartphone, the Xperia U seems to be slightly cheaper than the P. Itâs got a pricing of â¬259, which means it will retail close to the Rs.17,096 mark. Thatâs definitely a good price tag, considering itâs a dual-core processor that weâre talking about. But, it has less storage and a smaller screen than the Xperia P, although, weâre not sure weâll really complain about that. It also means that the current pricing of the Neo V and a lot of other handsets will drop, if a dual-core phone comes in at about a similar price bracket.Â\n\nThe major features of the Sony Xperia U are:\n\nAndroid 2.3 Gingerbread\n\n3.5-inch Reality Display powered by Mobile BRAVIA Engine\n\n1GHz dual-core processor\n\n5MP camera with fast capture, HD recording, 2D and 3D panoramic images capture capability\n\nxLoud and 3D surround sound audio technology\n\nWill be available in white or black, with pink and yellow exchangeable caps for the base of the smartphone in the box\n\nThatâs the pricing, as of now, but we have to also acknowledge the fact that a lot of quad-core phones have been announced as well, so a dual-core phone at a 30K price tag is definitely not something to look forward to. What do you guys think - would you buy these phones at this price?Â"
