        "text": "You are right, in a sense. These sensors do need moving components. However, they are a chip on your board.\n\nTiltsensors (actually, accelerometers), and gyroscopes (and pressuresensors, ...) are part of a family called MEMS: Micro-electromechanical systems.\n\nUsing similar techniques as already common in integrated circuit fabrication, we can make amazing little devices. We use the same processes of etching away things, depositing new layers, growing structures, etc.\n\nThese are incredibly tiny devices. this is an example of a gyroscope:\n\nlink to the original website.\n\nMost of these work by sensing changes in capacitance. A gyro would sense the changes due to rotation (the big thing in the picture would twist around the center axis. This will bring the tiny teeth that are interleaved closer together, and increase capacitance. Accelerometers work under a similar principle. These teeth can be spotted in the rightbottom corner of the second image.\n\nWhat about zero-gravity?\n\nIt would not change much in terms of the functioning of the devices. You see, accelerometers work by sensing acceleration. The key however is that gravity is the same to them - it just feels like you are being accelerated up at 1G, all the time. They use this \"constant\" to get an idea where \"down\" is. This also means that while the chips will function just fine in micro gravity, your phone would not - it will be confused as there seems to be no \"down\".\n\nQuick addition to address a (very good) point that user GreenAsJade brings up: When you look at the common definitions of gyroscopes on sources like wikipedia they are often described as something along the lines of a spinning disk. The pictures above don't seem to have any spinning parts. What's up with that?\n\nThe way they solve this is by replacing the rotation with vibration. The disk shaped object in the pictures here are only connected with very thin and flexible structures to the center axis. This disk is then made to vibrate around it's axis at high frequency. When you move the entire structure along an angle, this will cause the disk to try and continuously resist this - similar to a classic gyroscope. This effect is called the Coriolis effect. By sensing the amount of tilt of the disk compared to the surrounding solid material, it can measure how fast it is spinning.\n\nThe sensory device is a weight on a spring. It is indeed \"small-scale motion of some tiny components of the sensor\", and it's also \"another chip on a circuit board\".\n\nThe key word here is MEMS. It's possible to build small silicon structures and then etch away underneath them, leaving a free-floating piece. If the piece is long and thin, it will deform under gravity (or any acceleration) by an amount proportional to its Young's modulus. The change in position affects the capacitance between the moving part and stationary parts around it, which can be measured electronically.\n\nGenerally they have only one three-axis accelerometer. Better precision can be achieved by adding gyros or another accelerometer separated by a distance; Nintendo did this with Wiimote add-ons.\n\nMany phones also contain a magnetometer, which tells you vaguely where magnetic north is relative to the phone, although the calibration tends to be bad on these.\n\nAddressing specific parts of the question:\n\nWhat makes smartphones tilt-sensitive?\n\nMEMS accelerometers. Few mm square chip package, $0.50 or less in quantity.\n\nWill they retain this ability in zero-gravity conditions?\n\nNot exactly. They no longer have a convenient reference vector. However, they can still detect acceleration, so if you have one of those \"lightsaber\" apps and wave it around it will still work on the ISS. But neither you nor the phone have a clear idea of \"up\".\n\n(The Raspberry Pi kit sent up there has an accelerometer and a bunch of programs written by schoolchildren, so there's almost certainly a video demonstrating this somewhere)\n\nThe raw output of a 3-axis accelerometer is a vector of 3 values measured in m/s^2. The magnitude of this vector will usually be about 1g, but the direction varies. For a stationary phone it will point downwards. If you move it then the acceleration vector will change direction. If you drop the phone, i.e. it goes into freefall the same as a phone on an orbiting craft would be, then the magnitude goes to near-zero. This makes the direction of the vector swing wildly and turn to noise.\n\nThe use of accelerometers as drop detectors for hard disk safety was popularised about a decade ago by Macbooks. People found other uses for them.\n\nhow does it work?\n\nAnswered in more detail by other answers.\n\nTheoretically, yes, a phone or tablet could work just as well in say the International Space Station (ISS) as it does here on the ground.\n\nLet's break this down a bit.\n\nThere are two types of motion a device needs to detect.\n\nLinear Motion\n\nSelf-contained accelerometers use the deviation of a spring-coupled mass from a normal rest point as a measure of acceleration force in that axis. Obviously you need three of these to detect motion in any axis.\n\nKnowing, and tracking those forces you can \"dead-reckon\" the speed and direction of travel of the device from its original \"power-on\" location. Factor in an accurate clock, and you can also figure the current position.\n\nThat sounds simple, but the math is actually quite complex and errors in the system cause a drift over time.\n\nRotation\n\nRotation is obviously spin about any axis.\n\nSpin Sensors\n\nRotation can be measured using a gyroscope or a spin sensor. These devices again have a loosely coupled mass that is free to rotate, or is driven, in a particular axis. When the body of your device rotates, the difference between rotations tells you how much the device is rotating.\n\nSpin sensors and gyroscopes don't care about gravity, other that perhaps some frictional differences.\n\nGravity Referenced Accelerometer Rotation\n\nSince accelerometers measure the force acting on a loosely suspended mass, when that sensor is vertical relative to the earth, there will of course be a deflection in the spring due to the weight of the mass due to gravity. This offset is mathematically removed by the software in order to extract the acceleration part.\n\nHowever, since the three axis accelerometers will produce different offsets depending on their orientation, it is possible to mathematically detect spin from the difference in the offsets.\n\nHowever, though this method works, it is subject to variances in G. It would not work in space. It would also be significantly less functional in a maneuvering aircraft. Even a car going round a tight bend at speed could be problematic.\n\nAccelerometer Spin Detection\n\nIt is possible, with two sets of sufficiently sensitive accelerometers, to detect spin from the difference in acceleration between accelerometers.\n\nSince each accelerometer has to move relative to the other, there will be a difference in acceleration in that axis between each. Those values can again be used mathematically to predict the spin.\n\nSimply put, if you can tell from the accelerometers centered at one end of the phone that the centre point has moved to \\$X_1,Y_1, Z_1\\$, and the other end is now at \\$X_2,Y_2, Z_2\\$, calculating the three angles is trivial.\n\nThis method is NOT affected by gravity.\n\nWill YOUR Phone or Tablet Work On The ISS\n\nAs you can see from the above it really depends on which methods your device uses.\n\nTechnically it could be built, and programmed, to do so. You may need to shut it down and power it up again to recalibrate it, but with the right systems in place it should work fine. At least for playing that \"aircraft simulation game\".\n\nDrift may be a larger issue on the ISS though. Since phones in normal G have the ability to known which way \"down\" is at that particular moment, they can re-adjust over time. A space-based unit would need an occasional manual reset to indicate the \"normal\" direction.\n\nThis is a rare case on the Electronics site where, none of the answers clearly and crisply answered the question!\n\nDo cellphones retain the ability to detect tilt in zero-gravity conditions?\n\nThe answer is:\n\nThey retain (at a hardware level) the ability to detecting tilting, but they can no longer detect tilt.\n\nFurther,\n\nAt the level of app software, in fact, almost all (very likely \"all\") app-software-writers would not allow for the corner case of zero-gravity, so very likely the gyro-accel functions would act whackily overall, in most/all actual apps.\n\nRegarding how gyros/accels work in phones, you can easily google the APIs for these on the two platforms (example).\n\nNote however that all OSs as of writing, in practice wrap the lower-level gyro/accel functions in some sort of convenient higher-level motion manager:\n\nAccels/gyros, are in fact wrapped together at the OS level\n\nSo in fact...\n\nin practice, for any fairly newly-written app (remembering that, let's say, about 25% of apps in the store are decayed / not updated regularly), it would come down to how the team at Apple which wrote (in their case) \"Coremotion\" handled (if at all!) the zero gravity environment case. (There's a similar situation for Android).\n\nAnd further, for games as such...\n\nToday almost any game you pick up and play on a phone was created in Unity3D, rather than as a native app. (And as a rule, if you look at the set of \"apps which use the accel/gyros\", 90% (more?) of them are just games.) So in fact (on all platforms) the software-writers are actually using's Unity's level of software wrappers.\n\nHence, the actual behavior in the extreme corner case of earth orbit, would depend on what those folks did when writing that.\n\nOne confusing point...\n\nthat hasn't been clarified. When you're writing software for phones, it's totally commonplace to have to deal with \"zero gravity\" ... for short periods of time: that is, when the phone is in free-fall. So if you're making one of the (100s of) apps for skateboarders, skiers or the like which measures hang-time and so on, you deal with this as a matter of course.\n\nGyros were introduced to phones about 2010; accels were in them from the start.\n\nA French/Italian company called STMicroelectronics pretty much makes most of the gyros for both apple and samsung.\n\nRegarding accelerometers, most phones now have a couple of them since it works better that way. I have heard that there is more variety of suppliers of accelerometers (Bosch, etc).\n\nYou can literally buy MEMS gyros or accels, if for example you are making an electronic toy that includes such a feature.\n\nHow MEMS accelerometers actually work at a substrate level\n\nHow MEMS gyros work\n\nJust to repeat, the fundamental quick answer to the question posed is\n\nIn \"zero g\", they retain (at a hardware level) the ability to detecting tilting, but they can no longer detect tilt.\n\nIn terms of the software,\n\nit would, almost certainly, \"totally fail!\" in the whacky \"you're in orbit\" case. Since no gane or app engineer (I know) would be so OCD as to cover that case, but don't forget...\n\nit's totally commonplace to have \"zero gravity\" .. during short periods of freefall (this applies as a commonplace matter if you're making one of those \"action sports apps\")."
