        "text": "The Indian mobile phone market continues to thrive, with numerous domestic and international brands locked in intense competition for market dominance. Today, India is one of the fastest-growing smartphone markets in the world, with more than 50 crore Indians using a smartphone. With the number expected to double over the next few years, Indian mobile brands are poised to lead from the front. Furthermore, consumers are now opting to purchase domestic products over those manufactured outside the country. Indian smartphone brands such as Micromax, Lava, Intex, and Karbonn will now back themselves to capture a significant portion of the market share.\n\nList of Indian mobile companies\n\nThe ‘Make in India’ initiative has seen consumers opting for Indian-made products, over the ones that are shipped to the country. This gives Indian smartphone OEMs the perfect opportunity to make a triumphant comeback. Below are 10 of the best mobile brands in India that offer feature-rich phones at affordable prices:\n\nMicromax\n\nMicromax initially made a massive splash in the Indian smartphone market by providing smartphones and phablets (phone + tablet) at pocket-friendly prices. Most of the top-selling Micromax smartphones today are in the budget segment, with smartphone models like Micromax Bharat 5 Infinity, Micromax Infinity N11, and Micromax Infinity N12 capturing the imagination of Indian consumers. Micromax mobiles in India cost less than Rs. 10,000, making them the largest and arguably one of the best Indian mobile brands.\n\nLava\n\nYet another brand that has carved a place for itself in the Indian smartphone industry is Lava International, which was established in the country over a decade ago. Furthermore, Lava was named the ‘Most Trustworthy Brand’ in the CMR Retail Sentiment Index in 2018, highlighting the brand’s standing in the eyes of Indian consumers. Models like Lava Z25, Lava V5, and Lava Z81 come with excellent features and impressive specifications, making it the go-to brand for Indian mobile users looking for smartphones costing less than Rs. 10,000.\n\nKarbonn\n\nAnother prominent Indian smartphone manufacturer, Karbonn mobiles, was launched in 2009 and mostly caters to the budget segment. The brand currently has a presence in various countries, including Nepal and Sri Lanka, and its USP when it started was the brand’s ability to provide dual SIM phones at pocket-friendly rates. Karbonn also offers smartphones with 6-inch displays, such as the Karbonn Aura Note Play, and some of its other popular offerings include Titanium S9 Plus, Karbonn Vue 1, and the K9 Smart Plus.\n\nIntex\n\nIntex has become a household name when it comes to the consumer electronics segment. Intex Technologies was established in 1996 and is currently the second-largest mobile company in India. Intex also offers a wide range of products, including smartphones, tablets, LED TVs and feature phones, and some of its popular budget smartphone models include Intex Aqua Ace, Intex Aqua 4G, and Intex Cloud C1.\n\nXolo\n\nLaunched by Lava International in 2012, Xolo manufactures affordable laptops, smartphones, and tablets. Furthermore, Xolo also created the Hive UI for its smartphones and became the first mobile company in India to unveil a smartphone with an Intel processor, when it launched the Xolo X900. A few other popular smartphone models offered by Xolo include Xolo Black and Xolo Q.\n\nLYF\n\nReliance LYF mobiles, which is a subsidiary company of Jio, the largest Indian telecom company, manufactures 4G-enabled VoLTE smartphones in the country, along with other Android phones and Wi-Fi dongles. Furthermore, LYF is also the second-largest LTE smartphone supplier in the country. It is currently one of the top five Indian mobile brands, as well. Some of its top-selling models include LYF F1 Plus, LYF F1, and LYF Earth 2.\n\nSpice\n\nSpice Digital Ltd. launched several smartphones under the Spice Stellar brand name, with the mobile phone manufacturer specifically targeting the budget segment. The brand also focused on providing smartphones with unique designs. Some of the best smartphone models offered by the brand include Spice F301, Spice Xlife 512, and Spice Mi-504.\n\nCelkon\n\nCelkon brand quickly positioned itself as one of the best Indian smartphone brands for consumers and unveiled smartphones that came with Microsoft OS and Android OS.

Furthermore, the brand sold smartphones under two names: CAMPUS for the budget segment, while the high-end smartphones are sold under the MILLENNIA brand name. Some of its top-rated models include Celkon Smart 4G and Celkon Star 4G Plus.
