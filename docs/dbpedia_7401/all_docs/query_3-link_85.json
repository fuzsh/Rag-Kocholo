        "text": "A growing demand for electronic devices is putting pressure on supply chains and the planet. Our insatiable appetite for the latest technology comes at a price.\n\nProf Richard Herrington, Head of Earth Sciences at the Museum, invites us all to take a critical look at the gadgets we love and the vital materials they are made of.\n\n'I think most people do not have any idea of the range and scale of metals and minerals that are used to make electronics,' says Richard. 'We've found use for them in computers, cars and all kinds of machinery - it's technology that we didn't have 15 or 20 years ago that we now take for granted.\n\n'It is really important that we all understand where the raw materials come from, that metals and minerals are in the Earth where nature puts them. They don't come from a factory, and the supply is dispersed around the world where sometimes business and environmental practices aren't the best.'\n\nRichard hopes that by learning where these valuable resources come from and how they are being extracted, people will place more value on what they already have, understand the environmental (and human) cost of cheap electronics, reduce their own waste and make choices that in turn force manufacturers to lift their standards.Â\n\nMetals and minerals for green technologies\n\nWe don't just need these materials for our phones. We also need them to make technology that will help the Earth become a cleaner, greener place.\n\nRichard says, 'We all acknowledge that we need to stop burning carbon for our energy. Alternatives like wind turbines, solar panels, hydro-electric dams and electric cars call for new technologies that also demand metals and other materials.'\n\nGreen technologies such as electric vehicles and wind turbines require metals for wiring, batteries and components including copper, lithium, cobalt, manganese, nickel and graphite. Solar panels will also call for metals such as tellurium and silicon for the solar cells that turn sunlight into electricity.\n\n'We are expanding the amounts that we need of these materials, and there is still a question around whether we can get enough in time to implement the changes we've promised for the planet.'\n\nWhich minerals are in your mobile?\n\n1. Copper\n\nIt's time to look at our supply of raw materials\n\nOur globalised marketplace keeps prices relatively low, but at a cost: a vulnerable supply chain and, in some cases, reliance on countries with histories of exploitative workplace practices and child labour.\n\n'What we really don't want to happen is that the metals and materials we use come from only one place or only one company in the world,' Richard explains. 'Narrow supply opens up the possibility of commercial and geographical monopolies being created.\n\n'In the past we have had problems with monopolies inflating prices and there is the risk as well, given where they might be coming from, that these mining organisations aren't following best practice.'\n\nAccording to Richard, the UK's supply of lithium is currently stable but the cobalt supply is more uncertain.\n\n'At the moment, 30% of our lithium comes from South America including Chile, Argentina and Bolivia, and another third comes from Australia, with the rest made up by a few other suppliers.\n\n'Lithium is distributed among various countries, so the supply of that is quite diverse and secure. However, around 70% of cobalt comes from a single source: The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a country that has had its share of political problems and evidence of some child labour, which as consumers we should be concerned about.'Â\n\nShould we bring more primary production home?\n\nRichard believes there is huge potential in looking closer to home for our mineral supply.\n\nHe says, 'When you can source minerals locally, you know the supply chain is short and can be better controlled. The risk of unethical practices drop and you can cut down on the environmental and other costs of transportation.\n\n'Unfortunately, we have a tendency to be \"NIMBYs\" when it comes to mining, saying things are okay if it's \"not in my back yard\" - but isn't exporting the problem worse?\n\n'I think we can take the example from agriculture. People are happy eating food that is produced locally and I think we should be equally conscious about how we source raw materials from Earth.'Â Â\n\nTowards a circular economy\n\nRichard believes we should be building a circular economy that minimises or eliminates waste by returning precious resources into the production cycle.\n\n'Rather than creating things like mobile phones, using them for a while and putting them in a drawer when we buy a new one, we have an obligation not to lose track of where those precious materials are, and to ensure we are making products in forms that can be readily recycled,' Richard says.\n\n'We should not be wasting resources. We should make sure that once we pull them out of the ground we look after them and use and reuse them.'"
