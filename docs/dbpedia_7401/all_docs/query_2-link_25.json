        "text": "Sony has officially unveiled the Xperia P, previously codenamed the Nyphon. Taking a similar design cue from the Xperia S, the Xperia P is designed to be one step lower than the S with a few downgrades like a smaller 8-megapixel camera, versus the 12 megapixel that can be found on the Xperia S. Owning an iPhone 4S, I can tell you that a drop to 8-megapixel is no big deal and probably a welcome for those who might not have a lot of storage space on their phone. Speaking of storage, the Xperia P comes with a 16GB internal memory.\n\nUnlike the white or black finish that can be found on the Xperia S, the Xperia P pays homage to the first iPhone, with a sleek aluminum back (silver, black, and red) while Sony has introduced a new technology called “White Magic” display. This new tech which powers the Xperia P’s 4-inch multitouch display is designed to give better viewing during outdoor use and viewing.\n\nFans of NFC technology will be happy to know that the Xperia P also supports the eventual doom to carrying cash and credit cards. And if your like most people who own a TV with an HDMI input, the Xperia P also boasts an HDMI out, letting you easily show off your HD videos and photos. Still, if your a dock fan like me and prefer to have set locations for your devices, Sony will also be introducing a dock in Q2 (that’s also when the Xperia P launches) which will have the usuals like charging your device and video out. What’s unique to the dock is the capability of plugging in a USB keyboard and mouse which can then be used to navigate the Android Gingerbread interface (Ice Cream Sandwich is planned for shortly after the devices launch) and be used for writing emails and more.\n\nSony has yet to announce a price but I believe that it will fall right in the $199 territory (with a two year contract of course). After the jump, the Sony Xperia P specs and our comment section await you.\n\nSpecs:"
