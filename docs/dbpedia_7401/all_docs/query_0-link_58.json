        "text": "BARCELONA—By day three of Mobile World Congress, it's clear mobile phone manufacturers are going in two directions. There's cheap but powerful, and there's highly designed. Sony's two new Xperia smartphones go up against HTC's One series making design statements, and they do it in lights.\n\nI've been getting bored of seeing the same gray rectangular silhouette over and over again, so I was thrilled to see the slightly odd, very Sony-like design statements on the Xperia P and U. Both phones have a band of clear plastic between the screen and the microphone \"chin.\" On the higher-end P, that's where the three Android action buttons go; the band is lit by three LEDs, one just above each button.\n\nOn the smaller Xperia U, the clear band is even quirkier: it can change color based on your phone's UI theme or even what's showing on the screen. As I scrolled through the photo gallery, the phone picked up the predominant color in each image and changed the clear band's color to fit—blue, then yellow, then red. With its slightly curved back and very black front, that really gave the phone a futuristic feel. You can swap out the bottom bezel of the phone for one of various colors, too.\n\nBack to the Xperia P, that phone has one other feature that positively jumps out at you: its \"White Magic\" screen. White Magic uses four subpixels for each pixel rather than the usual three; the fourth one is white. That makes the screen's whites extremely bright, and saves power all around because you only have to light one subpixel rather than three for white areas. Sony told me the screen hits 900 candelas of brightness, which means it should be great for viewing outdoors.\n\nWith the P and U next to each other, I could really see White Magic in action. The U has a very tight, high-res little screen. It's 854-by-480, a standard resolution, but at 3.5 inches, it's a very high pixel density. But wow, did the P's picture pop, with much higher contrast. The photo in our slideshow doesn't quite do it justice because the P was blowing out my camera a bit. The P's pixel density also wows: it has a 960-by-540 screen at four inches diameter, making for a very tight 275 ppi display.\n\nBoth phones use ST-Ericsson's 1GHz dual-core U8500 chipset, which felt fast enough while I was trying the devices out. Neither of the demo phones had a network connection.\n\nSony's devices have a characteristic feel; they're a little narrower and a little softer than other Android flagships out there. It's a Northern European thing; Nokia devices feel similar. The Xperia P and U have that European vibe.\n\nThe P has an 8-megapixel camera and the U has a 5-megapixel shooter. Both phones run Android 2.3 with Android 4.0 upgrades coming within a few months, and Sony has thrown on plenty of custom software. Most of it is useful: there's an attractive best-friends widget, a weather widget which uses bold text rather than too many graphics, and Facebook integration in the photo gallery. Sony showed me a panorama app on the P which supposedly takes \"3D\" photos, but I didn't see anything 3D about it at all. It just takes panoramas.\n\nThere's also the depressingly usual Sony media services, Music Unlimited and Video Unlimited. I couldn't find a PlayStation store on either phone. For real old-school Sony fans, Timescape is an option. Timescape is Sony's old Rolodex-carousel Android UI from the first Xperia phones, showing social network updates as a rotating series of 3D index cards.\n\nBoth models will be available during the second quarter of this year. The phones have been initially announced in AT&T-compatible, 3G versions, though Sony could easily cook up a T-Mobile version if it wants."
