        "text": "Sony has finally announced Android 4.1 Jelly Bean updates for Xperia P , Xperia go and Xperia E Dual . The rollout will begin this week in phases and will gradually proceed depending upon market and customer variant over the month of May. The new update will also bring several different Sony features. The company has tried to blend the Sony Xperia software and Googleâs Jelly Bean to offer a new and convenient user experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJelly Bean update for Xperia phones\n\nFirstly, the update offers slick and more intuitive versions of Sonyâs media apps like Walkman, Album and Movies. It will now come with an easy to use library that lets users share their pictures, videos and tunes effortlessly. Users can enjoy their favourite content for longer time with the Battery Stamina mode. It is a completely customisable mode that knows when the screen is off and shuts down the apps that users donât require, to avoid draining of the battery. It also has the capability to instantly start the app again when the screen is on.\n\nSony has made it simpler, quicker and organised to search for apps too. It has worked towards a simpler application tray sorting. One has to simply press and hold on any app in order to move or add it to the homescreen or create a folder within the tray by the icon of the app on top of another. Sony also adds a new search function within the application tray to make it easier to locate apps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the update, Sony also wants to bring a revamped homescreen experience. To help users personalise their homescreens, Sony has added seven more panes. Finally, owners of Xperia P, Xperia go and Xperia E dual can lay their hands on Google Now, which helps to accomplish daily tasks with more efficiency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn case of Xperia go, the upgrade is accessible only via PC Companion or Bridge for Mac due to the size of some software packages. These users will get an in-phone notification if their devices are running on Ice Cream Sandwich. Sony also reveals that the Xperia S, Xperia SL, Xperia ion and Xperia acro S are next in the queue to receive Sonyâs Android 4.1 software, which should begin by the end of May."
