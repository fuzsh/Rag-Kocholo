The UART is not functional and im not sure if its loading the kernel even but it should but may be crashing very very early. Also to avoid data fault the kernel needs to be uncompressed as having it compressed data aborts the device.\n\nIssues\n\nThe device seems to be having issue with unpacking ramdisk when CONFIG_VT is enabled for some reason. When being connected via UART i can see the kernel trying to do something with the ramdisk but it fails. Disabling CONFIG_VT it goes to crazy mode as /dev/tty isnt there and spams the log with that."
