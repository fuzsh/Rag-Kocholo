        "text": "Cell-Phone Reimbursement Policy\n\nA cell-phone reimbursement policy is a second possible avenue to explore, and potentially a more sensible one. With 96% of Americans owning a cell phone as of 2019, it is reasonable to assume that your employees have their own phones. A reimbursement policy helps compensate employees for using their personal phones for work purposes, rather than adding the full expense of purchasing a new device and plan for every employee.\n\nHowever, discrepancies could arise between individual employees’ phone plans. While one employee may be paying for an unlimited phone plan, another could be budgeting for a carrier’s lowest priced option. A third employee could be on a family plan. Employers would have to figure out what plans they can reimburse, how much they can reimburse for each plan, and so forth.\n\nPros of Work Phones\n\nBelow are the pros associated with work phones:\n\nWorking remotely - Company-owned cell phones enable employees to work remotely. This is useful for companies with work-from-home privileges, for employees who need to be on-call, or for life’s unexpected events — such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCompatibility - Providing your employees with a work phone puts everyone on the same software and hardware, enabling compatibility among devices.\n\nRound the clock access - Employees that need to be on-call could benefit from having a company cell phone. A phone preloaded with the right software and contacts gives employees 24/7 access to everything they may need.\n\nHiring tactic - Offering your employees cell phones could be an incentive for people to apply to your company, especially those facing socio-economic barriers to purchasing their own phone.\n\nMonitoring - Company work phones allow employers to monitor their employees’ cell phone usage through security and protection products. While this may help catch or reduce employee time theft, it may also present the biggest con — lack of privacy.\n\nCost savings - The more lines you have on a plan, the more money you can save. This is one major pro associated with having a cell phone company plan. Reimbursing employees for business use of their personal cell phones may cost a lot more than the former option.\n\nCons of Work Phones\n\nBelow are the cons associated with work phones:\n\nCarrying multiple phones - Since the vast majority of Americans today already have a cell phone, receiving a second phone for work could become a nuisance. People don’t usually want to carry around two phones all of the time — and those same people may be hesitant to cancel their personal phone plan.\n\nPrivacy - Perhaps the biggest con is that employees may not be so keen about storing all of their personal information on a work phone. Concerns over privacy may lead to employees carrying around two phones instead.\n\nMore work for IT - Any problems that arise with work phones must be dealt with by your IT department. In other words, the company is expected to maintain them, not the employees.\n\nUpgrade costs - Cell phone technology changes rapidly. What’s deemed a fast and reliable phone today may not be so four years from now. Employers providing cell phones to their employees should expect to upgrade them every 2 years or so.\n\nEmployees taking advantage - Company cell phones provided for work-related activities only may be taken advantage of by employees. These risks would need to be curtailed by effective company cell phone policy.\n\nExpenses - For companies still in their start-up phase offering a cell phone to every employee may be too expensive. Especially when factoring in costs that’ll occur later down the road, new companies with tight profit margins may be better off waiting.\n\nImportance of Creating a Company Cell Phone Policy\n\nIf you decide to give out company-owned cell phones, you’ll want to establish a company cell phone policy and protocol. Creating clear expectations for employees can help diminish any risks associated with the use of work phones. Lastly, make sure to craft a policy that works with your company’s needs."
