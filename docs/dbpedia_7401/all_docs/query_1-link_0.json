Thanks to that, the screen's outdoor visibility should be outstanding, to say the least. Looking further down its specs sheet, we see a dual-core chipset providing the Sony Xperia P with processing power. Responsible for capturing those special moments is an 8-megapixel camera residing on the smartphone's back. What is really cool about the camera is that it should be capable of booting really fast straight from the lock screen.\n\nThis device is also known as Sony LT22i\n\nCons\n\nThick body (0.41 inches)\n\nI want it 47 users\n\nI have it 43 users\n\nI had it 28 users\n\nPopular Comparisons\n\nThe Sony Xperia P is most commonly compared with these phones:\n\nSpecs Compare\n\nDisplay\n\nSize: 4.0 inches Resolution: 960 x 540 pixels, 275 PPI Technology: TFT Screen-to-body: 60.87 % Colors: 16 777 216 Features: Scratch-resistant glass, Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor\n\nHardware\n\nSystem chip: ST Erricson NovaThor U8500 Processor: Dual-core, 1000 MHz, ARM Cortex-A9 GPU: ARM Mali-400 RAM: 1GB LPDDR2 Internal storage: 16GB OS: Android (4.1.2, 4.0.1, 2.3.7) Screenshots Device type: Smartphone\n\nBattery\n\nCapacity: 1305 mAh Type: User replaceable\n\nCamera\n\nRear: Single camera Camera samples Main camera: 8 MP (Autofocus, CMOS image sensor, BSI sensor) Flash: LED Video recording: 1920x1080 (Full HD) Features: Video light, Video calling Front: 0.3 MP VGA\n\nDesign\n\nSize comparison\n\nDimensions: 4.80 x 2.34 x 0.41 inches (122 x 59.5 x 10.5 mm) Weight: 4.23 oz (120.0 g) Keys: Right: Volume control, Camera shutter, Lock/Unlock key Colors: Black, Gray, Silver, Red\n\nCellular\n\n3G: Bands 5(850), 8(900), 2(1900), 1(2100) Data Speed: HSDPA 14.4 Mbit/s, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit/s, UMTS\n\nMultimedia\n\nHeadphones: 3.5mm jack Speakers: Earpiece, Loudspeaker Features: Album art cover, Background playback, Music recognition Screen mirroring: DLNA Radio: FM, Stereo, RDS\n\nConnectivity & Features\n\nBluetooth: 2.1, EDR Wi-Fi: 802.11 b, g, n; Hotspot USB: microUSB, USB 2.0 Features: Mass storage device, Charging HDMI: Yes Location: A-GPS Sensors: Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Compass Other: NFC, Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync\n\nPhone features\n\nNotifications: Music ringtones (MP3), Polyphonic ringtones, Vibration, Flight mode, Silent mode, Speakerphone Other features: Voice dialing, Voice commands, Voice recording\n\nRegulatory Approval\n\nFCC approval: Date approved: Apr 05, 2012 FCC ID value: PY7A3880135 Measured SAR: Head: 1.18 W/kg Body: 0.84 W/kg Simultaneous Transmission: 1.34 W/kg Wireless Router: 1.34 W/kg\n\nBuyers information\n\nIn The Box: embedded battery, clear audio certified stereo headset, fast charger, micro USB cable for charging, synchronisation and file transfer, and user documentation\n\nAvailability\n\nFeb 26, 2012 Officially announced: Yes\n\nDespite our efforts to provide full and correct Sony Xperia P specifications, there is always a possibility of admitting a mistake.

I had been using a Nokia C6, E75, Nokia 5800, 5310 etc earlier. This phone was cheaper than the other options I had. I didn't even know Sony makes phone in its name.\n\nHaving served me for two and a half years. Received my Sony Xperia Z2 a couple of hours earlier. Was doing a factory reset on Xperia P and thought this phone deserves a good farewell. Will still keep it. :) My first phone was Sony CMD Z7 back in 2003. Then shifted to Nokia and believed I would never shift again. As for most of the people, shift from Nokia wasn't easy. Samsung, LG, Moto etc seemed either too flashy with strange lights, grills, design or not so subtle UI. Iphone always seemed too pricey for what its worth. So Nokia it was all the way. Accordingly, I was totally getting a E7 which got delayed because of stock shortage.\n\nHowever, saw it and drooled over it. Verge's gallery photos of Xperia P sold me out. I held it and it was such an amazing phone to hold, totally neck to neck with any Nokia or Apple iPhone 4s. This phone made the shift so easier and the purchase of 325$ was totally worth every cent. It will be tough to move to any other brand for a while I believe.\n\nThank you Sony,\n\nA satisfied customer.\n\n10\n\nBuild quality\n\n8\n\nCamera quality\n\n8\n\nPerformance\n\n10\n\nDisplay\n\n9\n\nBattery life and charging\n\nWhat I like\n\nGreat build quality\n\nThe most appealing design on a phone of its time\n\nReliability and durability\n\nGood sharp screen\n\nPhone kept getting better through updates from Sony till 4.1\n\nServed two and a half years easily.\n\nRich multimedia features for a mid-range phone\n\nCamera (for a mid-range device of its time)\n\nWhat I don't like\n\nBattery should have been at least 1.5x more\n\nLoudspeaker isn't very clear.\n\nShould have had front cam resolution\n\nPhone application stutters when you have low free space.\n\nNo MicroSD slot\n\nDid you find this review helpful?\n\nHelpful\n\nUnhelpful\n\nSpam\n\nNot English content\n\nBad language\n\nOther\n\nReport\n\nReport\n\nBe the first one to vote.\n\nEdit Review\n\nRead Full Review\n\nFenomenon\n\nArena Apprentice\n\n8\n\nsmart and elegant but poor battery\n\nPhone owned for more than a year\n\nI use Xperia P for 1.5 years. Aluminium uni-body is just great and screen (with whitemagic) is awesome.\n\nInternet speed is avarage. I got 1900ms on sunspider test. Poor when compared to new phones but sufficent for surfing, social media and e-mail.\n\nCamera is overall good but panorama mod isnt working nice and vga front-camera isnt enough for selfie.\n\nIt doesnt support SD card (has 13gb storage tho) and have very poor battery. I charge it 2 times a day.\n\nStock user interface and keybord are laggy. I tried CM11, PA and slimkat. they are fast but have some bugs, also no stamina mode and radio.\n\nThus my advice is just stick with original JB (4.1.2) and use some 3rd party apps.\n\nI use Zero launcher, fleksy keybord, contacts+ etc. NO LAG on main screen, keybord, messaging and calls.\n\nAlso root your phone and install GO backup and greenify. I freeze all unnecessary sony&google apps, my phone has 400mb free RAM atm. I also recommend Power Toggles, myMail and SD maid.\n\n10\n\nBuild quality\n\n8\n\nCamera quality\n\n5\n\nPerformance\n\n10\n\nDisplay\n\n2\n\nBattery life and charging\n\nWhat I like\n\nWhitemagic technology\n\nUni-body aluminium cover\n\nwalkman - xLoud\n\nBravia Engine\n\n8 mp camera\n\nScratch ressistance display\n\nFM Radio\n\nWhat I don't like\n\npoor battery\n\nno sd card slot\n\nvga front camera\n\nDid you find this review helpful?\n\nHelpful\n\nUnhelpful\n\nSpam\n\nNot English content\n\nBad language\n\nOther\n\nReport\n\nReport\n\nBe the first one to vote.\n\nEdit Review\n\nRead Full Review\n\n9\n\nthe greatest mid-ranger you would get at a reasonable price\n\nPhone owned for less than a year\n\nI bought this phone with ics out of the box it was the perfect dual core 1ghz ,1gb ram android phone to get with a great camera and awesome speaker and it's perfotming well with the most recent jellybean update ,in my opinion.if you want a compac package full of android goodies go for it\n\n9\n\nBuild quality\n\n9\n\nCamera quality\n\n8\n\nPerformance\n\n10\n\nDisplay\n\n9\n\nBattery life and charging\n\nWhat I like\n\nfast-ish processor\n\namazing caamera\n\nsuperb screen\n\nawesome design\n\naluminium crafted unibody\n\nWhat I don't like\n\nbattery life\n\nDid you find this review helpful?\n\nHelpful\n\nUnhelpful\n\nSpam\n\nNot English content\n\nBad language\n\nOther\n\nReport\n\nReport\n\n1 out of 1 person found this helpful.\n\nEdit Review\n\nRead Full Review\n\nFCC OKs Cingular\\'s purchase of AT&T Wireless"
