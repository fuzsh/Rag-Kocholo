        "text": "Back at CES, then Sony Ericsson announced the Xperia S. Today at MWC 2012, the newly acquired Sony Mobile Communications announced two more Xperia NXT series devices - the Xperia P and Xperia U.\n\nThe Xperia P features a 4\" reality display with Sony's Mobile BRAVIA and WhiteMagic enhancement engines, the latter of which is new for Xperia. I originally suspected WhiteMagic would be RGBW PenTile, this actually turns out to be an RGBW stripe, as in (RGBW,RGBW for two pixels, not RG, BW like in PenTile RGBW), The Verge has a good photo here until we can get a macro. In addition the P includes a 1 GHz dual core ST-E U8500 SoC. ST-E's U8500 NovaThor consists of two ARM Cortex A9 with the NEON MPE and Mali-400 graphics. It's interesting to see Sony going with the U8500 here considering the Xperia S includes a 1.5 GHz MSM8260 SoC. In addition the phone includes 16 GB of internal storage, 8 MP camera, HDMI, and NFC. The only bad news is that the Xperia P will launch running Android 2.3 and receive Android 4.0 in the second quarter of 2012.\n\nThe Xperia U is a compact model which continues the same style and design language. It has a 3.5\" display with Sony's Mobile BRAVIA, the same 1 GHz dual core ST-E U8500 SoC, and 5 MP camera. Just like the Xperia P, the U will launch running 2.3 and get an update to 4.0 in the second quarter of 2012."
