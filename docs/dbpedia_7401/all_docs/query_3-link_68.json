        "text": "Forgotten what model of smartphone you have? Didn’t know in the first place? With so many different models and brands of smartphones available on the market, that’s understandable. However, identifying what smartphone you’re working with can be necessary for a variety of reasons: troubleshooting issues, purchasing compatible accessories, receiving software updates, or looking to trade in—to name just a few.\n\nLuckily there are ways to figure it out without leaving the comfort of your couch. We put together this ‘Smartphone Identification 101’ to help you determine your specific make and model. We’ll go into some of the simplest and most common methods of identifying your smartphone and finding your IMEI number.\n\nCheck your phone settings\n\nApple\n\niPhones are pretty distinct—if you’ve got the Apple logo on the back of your smartphone. It’s an iPhone, but this doesn’t tell you the exact device. They’ve made it super easy for you to look this up in your Settings app right on your phone.\n\nGo to Settings > General > About. This will bring up a page with information about your device, including the model name and number. This page also tells you useful information like your operating system software version, your serial number, and your IMEI (we’ll go into this more later).\n\nAndroid\n\nIf you have a smartphone that runs on Android, you’re using the most common phone operating system in the world. Many phone manufacturers run their devices on Android so some device instructions may vary by model and/or version. That said, usually, you can find out your phone's make and model in the Settings app.\n\nGo to Settings > About phone. (This may be located under System or About device, depending on the version of Android.) Once you’ve located the section, tap on it to open a new page with detailed information about your phone. Here you’ll be able to see the manufacturer, model name and number, and what Android version you’re running on. If you’re still unsure or this page isn’t giving you the answer you’re looking for, try searching for the model name it provides for more information.\n\nCheck your wireless carrier account\n\nIf you’re unable to identify your device through its physical characteristics or its operating system, another way to check is through your carrier’s account. Your carrier should have details about the smartphone you’re using including its make, model, and serial number. You can access this information by logging into your account on your wireless carrier’s online portal. If you’re logging in online, look for a section that might contain account details, plan, billing info, and devices. This is where your smartphone information should be listed, alongside things like your SIM number or IMEI. If you’re having trouble finding that info or logging in, you can always contact customer support for expert help.\n\nLook up your IMEI\n\nEvery smartphone is assigned a unique number called an IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity), and you can use your IMEI to identify what make and model your phone is. First, you’ll need to find your IMEI and there are a couple of ways to do that:\n\nDial *#06# on your device and press the call button. It will display your IMEI so you can take note of it.\n\nFind it in your phone’s settings (see instructions above).\n\nOnce you have your IMEI you can use it to look up your device information on a site designed for that purpose like IMEI.info.\n\nTime to upgrade?"
