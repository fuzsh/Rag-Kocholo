Then, Apple’s smartphone market share was 54.04%, while Samsung’s came in at 9.12%—a difference of 44.82 percentage points.\n\nThe narrowing of Apple’s lead over the past decade wasn’t from the brand losing market share, but from Samsung growing its. In fact, Apple’s market share has held relatively steady in this period, ranging between 50.85% and 59.97%.\n\nSamsung, on the other hand, has managed to more than double its share.
