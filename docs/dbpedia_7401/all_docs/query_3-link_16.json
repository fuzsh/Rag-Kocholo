        "text": "As the number of smartphone users worldwide increases year after year, it’s no surprise that mobile commerce sales are also reaching all-time highs. That said, knowing certain mobile usage statistics can come in handy when crafting a digital marketing strategy.\n\nSmartphone market share: Table\n\nSmartphone market share: Key points\n\nWith a smartphone market share of 27.95% (as of April 2024), Apple is the most popular mobile phone brand worldwide.\n\nMore than half of global smartphone users own smartphones manufactured by either Apple or Samsung.\n\nThe top five smartphone brands have a combined market share of 77.64%.\n\nTop smartphone manufacturers by market share\n\nThe latest statistics on the smartphone market share worldwide show that as of April 2024, US phone maker Apple leads the pack, with a market share of 27.95%. This means that more than one-quarter of smartphone users worldwide use an Apple phone.\n\nSecond on the list of the most popular smartphone manufacturers is Samsung. The South Korean brand has 23.95% of the smartphone market share, just four percentage points less than Apple.\n\nApple and Samsung dominate the smartphone industry and own a combined 51.9% of the total smartphone market share. In fact, these two smartphone manufacturers have been leading the market since 2013. That year, both their market shares surpassed Nokia’s, a Finnish phone brand that was immensely popular in the 2000s.\n\nThe data also shows that Apple has increased its lead over Samsung over the past year. In January 2023, its market share was 27.6%, just 0.51 percentage points above Samsung’s 27.09%. By May, it had increased that gap to 6.17 percentage points, as its market share grew to 31.44%, compared to Samsung’s 25.27%.\n\nXiaomi is the third-largest smartphone brand, with 11.44% of the total market share. This is impressive for the Chinese company, considering it was founded only in 2010. The bulk of Xiaomi’s growth came in the past five years. Prior to 2017, the phone maker only had around 2% of the market share. That year, however, it more than doubled its share, ending the year with 4.75%.\n\nAfter Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo follow, with 5.77% and 5% of the market share, respectively. The sixth-largest smartphone manufacturer is Realme, which holds 3.53% of the smartphone market share.\n\nTogether, these six brands own 77.74% of the global smartphone market share. In other words, more than three out of every four smartphones being used worldwide are manufactured by them.\n\nOut of all the top phone brands in the world, only Apple is based in the United States. In fact, the remaining five hail from Asia—specifically, China and South Korea.\n\nWant to learn more?"
