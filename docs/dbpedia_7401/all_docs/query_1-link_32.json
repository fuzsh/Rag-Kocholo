        "text": "The Sony Xperia P, the lower end sibling to the Xperia S is being introduced in a new color, metallic pink. This brings the color selection for the 8-megapixel camera equipped Android phone with 16GB of internal memory to four, along side the current silver, black, and red. There’s no word yet on a release date or pricing for the model but we’re somehow doubtful of the pink phones capability of charming custom agents and being made available in the US.\n\nAfter the jump, a few refresher details on the Xperia P.\n\nWe wouldn’t blame you if you’d forgotten all about the Xperia P which is designed to satisfy the lower end Android smartphone market. Despite a lower megapixel count, and slower processor, Sony has introduced a new technology called “White Magic” display. This new tech which powers the Xperia P’s 4-inch multitouch display is designed to give better viewing during outdoor use and viewing. Other great features of the phone include NFC technology and HDMI out. Check out our original coverage of the Sony Xperia P.\n\nDiscuss:\n\nDo you think we’ll see the Xperia P come to the US anytime soon?\n\n[Via ePrice]"
