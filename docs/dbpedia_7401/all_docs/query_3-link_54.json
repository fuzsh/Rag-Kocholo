        "text": "Modern society has always seemed to have a bit of an obsession with technology. But no single device has had as much of an impact on the world than the mobile phone.\n\nToday, the average person touches their phone an unreal 2,617 times per day. More people in the world have access to a mobile phone than a toilet. In an average year, we spend just under 800 hours on our mobile phones (that’s over a whole month!). And with these figures rising all the time, it’s no surprise that the last ten years have been labelled as the ‘decade of the smartphone’.\n\nBack in the early days of mobile phones, their sole use was for calling other people whilst on the move. Soon after, the ability to ‘text’ other mobile phones was introduced. Nowadays you can use mobile phones to do literally everything. From paying for your next meal to tracking your sleeping habits, the smartphone of today has almost no limits.\n\nThat’s not the only thing that has changed since the first mobile phone went on sale. Think the iPhone XS is pricey at $1,500? Well, the first mobile phones went on sale for a whopping $4,000 each! The increased demand for mobile phones has caused technology to advance rapidly, with prices continuously falling (until the last few years, where prices have shot up).\n\nRegardless, the evolution of mobile phones has been a truly thrilling journey. In this blog post, we’ll be taking a walk through the full history of mobile phones, ever since the first call was made from one way back in 1973.\n\n*Disclaimer – Be prepared for an overwhelming wave of nostalgia!"
