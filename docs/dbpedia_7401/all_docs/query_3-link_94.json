        "text": "Smartphones have become nearly ubiquitous in developed nations across the world. In fact, nearly three-quarters of the top 10 developed countries’ populations own a smartphone.\n\nGlobally, almost 90% of cellular phones are smartphones. And the majority of the world’s population currently owns one.\n\nThere are currently over 7.2 billion smartphones worldwide — a number that’s projected to increase in the coming years.\n\nIn fact, the worldwide smartphone market grew a considerable 7.8% in Q1 2024 alone.\n\nFor further information on the state of the smartphone market from a user perspective, read on.\n\nHere’s a summary of what you’ll find below:\n\nSmartphone Ownership Statistics (Top Picks)\n\nHow Many Smartphones Are There?\n\nSmartphone Ownership Demographics\n\nUS Smartphone User Breakdown\n\nSmartphone Ownership Over Time\n\nSmartphone Market Share\n\nSmartphone Ownership Statistics (Top Picks)\n\nThere are approximately 6.84 billion smartphones in the world.\n\nWorldwide smartphone users have increased year-over-year by at least 5% over the last five years.\n\nThere are upwards of 10.47 billion IoT connections worldwide\n\nChina has the most smartphone users in the world\n\nGermany has the most smartphone usage per capita\n\nCollege graduates are most likely to own a smartphone\n\nAndroid is the leading mobile operating system worldwide\n\nHow Many Smartphones Are There?\n\nWorldwide, there are approximately 7.21 billion smartphones. To put that into perspective, that figure accounts for around 90% of the 8 billion global population.\n\nHowever, it should be made clear that this does not mean that 90% of people across the globe own a smartphone. In fact, just one country (Germany) has a smartphone penetration rate above 80%.\n\nThis is because many people own more than one smartphone. And certain businesses own thousands of phones. To highlight this fact, it is estimated that approximately 10 billion mobile-connected devices are currently in use.\n\nSources: Statista, Newzoo, OuterBoxDesign\n\nSmartphone Ownership Demographics\n\nThe top 10 countries by smartphone users each have upwards of 70 million active smartphone users.\n\nChina has the most smartphone users worldwide – almost 1.5x more than any other country.\n\nOf the countries listed, the US has the largest proportion of its population actively using smartphones (81.6%).\n\nHere is a full breakdown of New Zoo’s active smartphone users by country:\n\nRank Country Smartphone Users Total Population Smartphone Penetration 1 China 974.69 million 1.43 billion 68.4% 2 India 659 million 1.42 billion 46.5% 3 United States 276.14 million 338.29 million 81.6% 4 Indonesia 187.7 million 275.5 million 68.1% 5 Brazil 143.43 million 215.31 million 66.6% 6 Russia 106.44 million 144.71 million 73.6% 7 Japan 97.44 million 123.95 million 78.6% 8 Nigeria 83.34 million 218.54 million 38.1% 9 Mexico 78.37 million 127.5 million 61.5% 10 Pakistan 72.99 million 235.82 million 31%\n\nDespite these staggering figures, many people do not (and cannot) have access to a smartphone. This is because approximately 1.1 billion people (roughly 1 in 8 people) do not have access to electricity.\n\nUS Smartphone User Breakdown\n\nTaking a closer look at US statistics, 19 in 20 people have some form of a cell phone.\n\nAccording to PewResearch data, the average smartphone user in the US:\n\nIs male\n\nIn total, 80% of males own a smartphone compared to 75% of females in the US. There is a 3% difference in favor of females when it comes to owning a non-smartphone cell phone.\n\nIs 18 to 29 years old\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the youngest adult age group features the highest proportion of smartphone users (94%).\n\nThe next highest proportion of smartphone users are 30 to 49-year-olds (89%), followed by 50 to 64-year-olds (73%), and rounded off by the 65+ age group (46%).\n\nLives in an urban area\n\nAgain, there’s no surprise in the fact that a larger proportion of US citizens living in urban areas use smartphones (83%) compared to suburban residents (78%) and rural citizens (65%).\n\nIs white/Hispanic\n\nData shows that ethnicity made very little difference in terms of smartphone users. Around three-quarters of white (77%), Hispanic (77%), and black (75%) populations own a smartphone.\n\nWhile 98% of black US citizens own some form of cell phone compared to 97% of the Hispanic population and 94% of the white population.\n\nGraduated college\n\nMeanwhile, the level of education showed a positive correlation to smartphone ownership. And a negative correlation to non-smartphone ownership.\n\nHere are the details:\n\nEducation Level Cell Phone Ownership Smartphone Only Ownership Non-Smartphone Only Ownership Less than high-school 90% 57% 33% High-school graduate 92% 69% 24% Some College 96% 80% 16% College graduate 97% 91% 6%\n\nEarned upwards of $75,000\n\nLastly, there was also a positive correlation between smartphone ownership and annual salary.\n\nTwo-thirds of people earning under $30,000 a year (67%) own a smartphone. There was a small increase between the number of US citizens earning $30,000-$49,999 with a smartphone (82%) and US citizens earning $50,000-$74,999 (83%).\n\nAmericans earning over $75,000 a year are most likely to own a smartphone (93%).\n\nSources: Newzoo, Quartz, PewResearch\n\nSmartphone Ownership Over Time\n\nIn the space of half a decade, smartphone users worldwide have increased significantly.\n\nBack in 2016, there were approximately 3.67 billion smartphone users. Since then, this figure has increased year-over-year by at least 300 million.\n\nBetween 2016-2021, the number of smartphone owners has increased by 73.88%.\n\nThe following table shows smartphone usage growth since 2016:\n\nYear Smartphone Users Growth Over Previous Year Percentage Growth Over Previous Year 2016 3.668 billion - - 2017 4.435 billion + 767 million + 20.91% 2018 5.095 billion + 660 million + 14.88% 2019 5.623 billion + 528 million + 10.36% 2020 5.924 billion + 301 million + 5.35% 2021 6.259 billion + 335 million + 5.65% 2022 6.567 billion + 308 million + 4.92% 2023* 6.974 billion + 407 million + 6.2% 2024* 7.211 billion + 247 million + 3.4% 2025* 7.434 billion + 223 million + 3.09% 2026* 7.584 billion + 150 million + 2% 2027* 7.772 billion + 188 million + 2.48% 2028* 7.949 billion + 177 million + 2.28% 2029* 8.064 billion + 115 million + 1.45%\n\n*estimated\n\nSmartphone ownership is expected to continue to grow over the next 3-4 years.\n\nAs of 2024, the number of smartphones worldwide is estimated to exceed 7 billion. And the proportion of smartphones to cell phones will only become larger.\n\nBy 2025, it is predicted that 72% of internet users will exclusively use mobile devices to access the internet.\n\nHere is a look at the forecasted data for smartphones worldwide between 2021 and 2027:\n\nYear Number of Smartphones Number of Mobile Devices Proportion of Smartphones 2021 6.37 billion 14.91 billion 42.7% 2022 6.57 billion* 15.96 billion* 41.17% 2023 6.84 billion* 16.8 billion* 40.71% 2024 7.07 billion* 17.72 billion* 39.9% 2025 7.30 billion* 18.22 billion* 40.07%% 2026 7.51 billion* - - 2027 7.69 billion* - -\n\n*estimated\n\nSource: Ericsson, The Radicati Group\n\nSmartphone Market Share\n\nThe smartphone market split has diversified over the last decade.\n\nIn 2012, Samsung claimed almost one-third of the smartphone market – the largest single share that year. Besides Apple, (who claimed an 18.7% market share) no other brand claimed more than 4% of the market.\n\nBy 2020, five different brands claimed a market share of at least 8%.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the smartphone market split for select brands since 2012:\n\nYear Samsung Apple Huawei Xiaomi OPPO vivo Lenovo 2012 30.3% 18.7% 4% - - - 3.3% 2013 31.3% 15.3% 4.9% - - - 4.5% 2014 24.4% 14.8% 5.7% 4.4% - - 4.6% 2015 22.3% 16.1% 7.4% 4.9% 3% 2.6% 5.2% 2016 21.1% 14.6% 9.5% 3.6% 6.8% 5.3% - 2017 21.7% 14.7% 10.5% 6.3% 7.6% - - 2018 20.8% 14.9% 14.7% 8.7% 8.1% - - 2019 21.6% 13.9% 17.6% 9.2% 8.3% - - 2020 20.6% 15.9% 14.6% 11.4% - 8.6% - Q2 2021 18.9% 14.2% - 16.9% 10.5% 10.1% - Q2 2022 21.8% 15.6% - 13.8% 8.6% 8.7% -\n\nThe two major mobile operating systems (OS) used in smartphones are Android and iOS.\n\nAs of May 2024:\n\nAndroid has a 71.31% OS market share\n\niOS has a 27.73% OS market share\n\nSamsung has a 0.38% OS market share\n\nKaiOS has a 0.15% OS market share\n\nWindows has a 0.02% OS market share\n\nNokia Unknown has a 0.01% OS market share\n\nLinux has a 0.01% OS market share\n\nHowever, in the US market, iOS leads the way with a 55.48% market share. While Android claims a 44.27% market share.\n\nSources: IDC, StatCounter\n\nConclusion\n\nThat concludes our roundup of smartphone ownership statistics.\n\nSmartphone adoption continues to grow and is increasingly becoming more widespread across the globe.\n\nThere is still some way to go in developing countries, but in the most developed nations, smartphones are becoming near-omnipresent."
