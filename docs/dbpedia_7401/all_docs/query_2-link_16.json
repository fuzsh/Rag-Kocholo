I have anoth... moreI've noticed the water/moisture in the transparent bit of my phone, too, but don't pay much attention to it, as it doesn't affect the functionality of the phone at all.\n\nIt's a great phone, though. Occasionally, a lag issue comes up - but that's very rare. Once or twice, it froze and I had to wait for it to restart and get itself together.. but that last happened a ridiculously long time ago.\n\nAlso, I've dropped the phone quite a few times - several times with the screen down, and it's still perfect. Only a couple of small scratches on the back, and the corners are a little damaged, but that's because I don't use a case.\n\nOverall, it's a fantastic phone. I've had it for over a year and loved it. Now, I'm picking out good phones for my little sister to choose from - looking at lots of new, pretty models - and I still haven't found one that would replace my Xperia P for me. Would pick it with its great personalizable Android OS over an iPhone any day!\n\nReply\n\n?\n\nAnonymous\n\nPrp\n\n22 Nov 2013\n\ngreat smartphone with HDMI and a very nice CAMERA! for 250 usd (3300MXN) at Mexico City …i have almost 18 months with the phone and every little problem i solve it fast on the web…the phone has resisted several falls, water and still working!!\n\nReply\n\nS\n\nSonyphile\n\naj6\n\n22 Nov 2013\n\nPrince blue, 21 Nov 2013Xperia p vs xperia s guys?Xperia S\n\nReply\n\nP\n\nPrince blue\n\nfuZ\n\n21 Nov 2013\n\nXperia p vs xperia s guys?\n\nReply\n\nr\n\nread before buy\n\nphV\n\n21 Nov 2013\n\nOverall a good phone with good camera, but it gets a bit laggy even after update.
