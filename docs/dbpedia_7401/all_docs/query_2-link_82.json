        "text": "Okay here is how to root without unlocking bootloader for XP Jellybean. This is confirmed working and do it in your own risk.\n\nNote: Charge your phone to 100% before doing this and back up contact,message and any other installed app.\n\nDownload and install Flashtool (If you dont know how to flash using flashtool follow this tutorial\n\nDownload Sony Xperia P_6.1.1.B.1.75_Generic World from here\n\nPut the ftf file inside the firmware folder of flashtool\n\nTurn Usb Debugging on in your phone\n\nShut down your Xperia P\n\nPress the lightning icon inside flashtool\n\nSelect FLASHMODE (NOT FASTBOOT)\n\nChoose the Sony Xperia P_6.1.1.B.1.75_Generic World ftf file for XP\n\nWhen flashtool ask you to connect your device, insert USB cable first in your phone then hold Volume Down Button and insert the other end of USB in your PC\n\nWait till it finish\n\nDisconnect your phone and power on. You are back in ICS\n\nFlash 0.559 kernel via flashtool\n\nRemove the phone from PC, reboot the phone\n\nConnect the phone to PC\n\nOpen flashtool hit the root button\n\nWhen you see \"waiting for restore to finish\" open your phone and run Backup&Restore app and restore RootMe.tar file.\n\nWait until Flashtool do the rest of work\n\nWhen u r done flash .75 kernel via flashtool reboot the phone\n\nDownload CWM\n\nExtract the folder\n\nConnect your phone to the pc with USB debugging\n\nClick on install.bat\n\nDownload JB KERNEL and PRE ROOTED JB\n\nPut it on your SD card\n\nWell Now shut down you Xperia P\n\nTurn it on\n\nEnter CWM Recovery by pressing volume down (dont hold the volume button put press repeatedly move up and down using volume button select using power button)\n\nMount System\n\nMount Data\n\nMount Cache\n\nFlash the JB Kernel Zip\n\nAgain Mount System\n\nMount Data\n\nMount Cache\n\nFlash the JB_prerooted_6.2.A.0.400.zip\n\nDo Not Reboot !!\n\nWipe Data/Factory Reset\n\nReboot !!\n\nIt take some minutes, But just wait with patience\n\nFor the 1st time you may get FC from Thememanager and Timescape\n\nEnjoy Rooted JB !!!\n\nSource: XDA\n\nRooting will involve several steps. You may or may not want to unlock your bootloader first (I did unlock it first before trying the following steps).\n\nIn order to use these instructions, you'll need a Windows computer and your device must be running Ice Cream Sandwich or Jelly Bean. You'll also want to ensure your device is charged before trying to root it.\n\nThese instructions are paraphrased from Xperia HTC Rooting.\n\nDownload the Bin4ry rooting software, and extract it to your desktop\n\nEnable USB debugging on your Xperia P. You can do this by going into Settings > Application > Developer options > USB debugging and checking the box to enable it.\n\nConnect your Xperia P to your computer via a USB cable. If your device is not recognized, you may need to install the Sony Xperia P USB driver first, then reconnect it again.\n\nDouble click on RunMe.bat file in the Bin4ry folder that you extracted\n\nA black command window popup should appear with green text. Type 1 to select New_standard_root and press Enter.\n\nFollow the on screen instructions to root your device.\n\nNote: If the New_Stand_Root method does not work, try repeating steps 4 and 5 with the second root method (New Xperia Root by Goroh_kun)."
