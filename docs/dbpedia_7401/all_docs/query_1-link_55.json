        "text": "Product Page\n\nThe Xperia P smartphone has a full aluminium unibody.\n\nExperience beauty. Distinctive design.\n\nThe Xperia P Android phone stands out with its distinctive, minimalistic design.\n\nLike all phones in the Sony Xperia NXT series, it has a simple, strong design language. And Xperia P takes it one step further – the precision crafted, full aluminium unibody gives this Android phone a unique, durable and modern look.\n\nA clear display, even in bright sunlight.\n\nLounging in the sun, enjoying a YouTube clip or your favourite movie?\n\nThe 4(10.16 cm) Reality Display powered by the Mobile BRAVIA® Engine also includes Sony’s unique WhiteMagic™ technology, making the colours in your favourite clips and stills look as sharp and clear as if you were inside.\n\nWhiteMagic adds a 4th white sub-pixel – traditional LCD screens have three; red, green and blue – to the Reality Display. The result? The outstanding combination of an ultra-bright screen and great power efficiency. Power efficient because WhiteMagic automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen to surrounding light – when the light is not so strong, Sony Xperia P uses less battery power.\n\nWhiteMagic™ technology – this is how it works\n\nA second from sleep to snap in just over a second with the Xperia P Android smartphone.\n\nExperience now. Capture it all in brilliant HD.\n\nSome things are just too good to miss.\n\nMake sure you always get the right shot with your phone’s fast capture 8 megapixel camera. Just over a second from sleep to snap, and just one second between shots.\n\nAnd thanks to the Exmor R™ for mobile image sensor you capture stunning pictures, even in low light. Want to enjoy your photos on a bigger screen? A single swipe of the display, and you’re ready to share your pics on your TV, tablet or laptop.\n\nXperia P Android smartphone - powered by Android and a 1Ghz processor"
