        "text": "Sony Mobile Communications has launched the new Xperia P and Xperia U smartphones, joining its new NXT range of next-generation handsets.\n\nBoth new phones come with Android 2.3 Gingerbread with a planned upgrade to Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich in the second quarter of 2012. They also both have 1GHz processors.\n\nThe Xperia U comes with a 3.5-inch Realty Display powered by Mobile Bravia Engine and a 5MP camera capable of taking 2D and 2D images.\n\nHowever, the premium Xperia P has a 4-inch reality screen featuring Sony's new WhiteMagic technology for an ultra bright yet power-efficient viewing experience. It has also an 8MP 2D and 3D camera, and 16GB of flash storage.\n\nSony said that the Xperia NXT series is the \"cornerstore\" of its connected experience, as the firm attempts to enable customers to more easily enjoy and share content across its various platforms, including phones, tablets, TVs and laptops.\n\nThe new smartphone range, including last month's announced Sony Xperia S 'super-phone', connect consumers to various entertainment services via the Sony Entertainment Network, including videos, music and games.\n\nAvailable exclusively for the Xperia P, the new SmartDock feature offers simple connectivity to multiple screens, turning the smartphone into an entertainment hub for the living room.\n\nUsers can navigate their smartphone's content using a television remote control, and then watch videos or other content on the TV screen. Featuring USB support, the Smartdock can also link up a wireless keyboard and mouse to write emails or browse the internet.\n\nNear Field Communications (NFC) are supported in the Xperia P, enabling users to access a range of 'contactless' NFC applications, along with Xperia SmartTags.\n\nThe Xperia P and Xperia U will be available to consumers globally in the second quarter of this year. Pricing for the handsets has not yet been announced.\n\nSony has also announced that the Xperia S is now available around the world, including the first sales at the Sony Style store in Barcelona during Mobile World Congress.\n\nKey features for Xperia U:\n\nScreen: 3.5-inch Reality Display powered by Mobile Bravia Engine.\n\nProcessor: 1GHz dual-core processor for super fast performance.\n\nCamera: 5MP camera with unique fast capture, HD recording and Sony technology to capture 2D and 3D panoramic images.\n\nAudio: Crisp and loud listening with xLoud and 3D surround sound audio technology.\n\nColours: Available in a choice of white or black, with pink and yellow exchangeable caps for the base of the smartphone.\n\nOperating System: Android platform 2.3 (Gingerbread), upgrade to Android platform 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) in Q2 2012."
