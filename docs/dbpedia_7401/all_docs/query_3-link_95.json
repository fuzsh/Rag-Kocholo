        "text": "The Pixel 8A (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes very close to being the perfect phone for everybody. It looks gorgeous (especially in the flashy Aloe color). It has a powerful processor—Tensor G3—to run demanding games and zip through dozens of apps with ease, with access to nearly all the same smart software features that make Pixels such a joy to use. The 64-MP camera and a 13-MP ultrawide capture better photos than most other phones at this price (and some pricier ones too). The 6.1-inch OLED screen is a nice size that's not too large and not too small, and it gets decently bright. Don't forget the smooth 120-Hz screen too! Then there's wireless charging and the IP67 water resistance rating. Google also has two modes of biometric authentication here: fingerprint or face unlock, and both can be used to access sensitive apps. Did I mention it costs less than $500? It will even last a while, thanks to a whopping seven years of software updates.\n\nIt does have some drawbacks. The battery life is just OK; on average it can last a day, but you'll need a power bank if you're a power user. Also, I had some issues with Real Tone, which is Google's imaging algorithm designed to more accurately capture darker skin tones. The results weren't as good as prior models. But if you can make do with those flaws, this is the best smartphone for the money.\n\nSpecs:Display: 6.1 inch, 120 Hz, OLEDProcessor and RAM: Tensor G3 with 8 GB RAMStorage: 128 and 256 GB optionsBattery: 4,492 mAhCameras: 64-MP main camera, 13-MP ultrawide, 13-MP selfie cameraUpdates (from date of manufacture): 7 years of software updatesExtras: Wireless charging, IP67, fingerprint and secure face unlock, NFCCarrier compatibility: Works on all three major US networks\n\nSamsung's smartphones are the crème de la crème of the Android world, with top specs, refined hardware, and excellent software support. Seriously, the Galaxy S24, S24+, and S24 Ultra (8/10, WIRED Recommends) will all receive seven years of software updates, so you can hold on to your phone for longer. They're powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset for smooth and powerful performance, the AMOLED screens are sharp and extremely bright (with 120-Hz screen refresh rates), and the batteries in all three should last you more than a day with average use. I break down the differences between all three models in this story, but suffice it to say that if you prioritize battery life, you should stick with the S24+ or S24 Ultra; the S24 is the smallest and best for anyone who prefers a tiny phone. The Ultra has the S Pen embedded inside, so it's a must-have for stylus stans.\n\nThe triple-camera systems on the S24 and S24+ are reliable and versatile, and the selfie camera remains one of the sharpest on the market. The S24 Ultra has an extra fourth camera—a 5X optical zoom that replaced the old 10X optical zoom. I miss it, but 5X is still a nice option to have. These phones also capture some of the smoothest and most detailed videos in the world of Android, so if you film a lot on your phone, the S24 series is right for you. There is also now a bevy of smart AI features, some of which are genuinely useful, though they're still not quite as smart as Pixel phones. Once you have your Samsung in hand, read my recommendations on what settings to change to get the most out of it. And I have case and accessory recommendations here too.\n\nSpecs:Display: 6.2 inch, 6.7 inch, 6.8 inch, 120-Hz LTPO, AMOLEDProcessor and RAM: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 with 8 GB | 12 GB RAM on S24+ and S24 UltraStorage: 128, 256, 512 GB, and 1 TB optionsBattery: 4,000, 4,900, and 5,000 mAhCameras: S24 and S24+ have a 50-MP main camera, 12-MP ultrawide, 10-MP telephoto, and 12-MP selfie cameras | S24 Ultra has a 200-MP main, 12-MP ultrawide, 10-MP telephoto (3X), 50-MP telephoto (5X), and 12-MP selfie cameraUpdates (from date of manufacture): 7 years of software updatesExtras: Wireless charging, IP67, fingerprint unlock, NFC, S Pen stylus integrated on S24 UltraCarrier compatibility: Works on all three major US networks\n\nNothing is all about style, and this is reflected not just in its phone hardware design but also in its slick Nothing OS interface. If you feel like every phone looks and acts the same, you should check out the Nothing Phone (2a) (9/10, WIRED Recommends)—it will feel like a breath of fresh air. Yes, there's also the more widely available Nothing Phone (2), which goes for $699, but the Phone (2a) does nearly as much as its flagship sibling at around half the cost. Most notable are the Glyph LED lights on the back, which illuminate when you get notifications, but you can also set them to work with other apps—you can set a timer and the LED bar will decrease as the timer runs out.\n\nI barely had any issues with performance on this smartphone—the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro chipset handled games and apps like a champ. The 6.7-inch AMOLED screen has a 120-Hz screen refresh rate and it's excellent. There's NFC and an in-display fingerprint sensor, plus Nothing is promising three Android OS upgrades and four years of security updates. That's pretty good for a sub-$400 phone. Seriously, I used this phone as my daily driver when I was covering the Mobile World Congress 2024 trade show, and it performed flawlessly. However, cameras and connectivity are its weaknesses. The photos you snap on this phone will be decent, but nothing to write home about. And there's sadly no Verizon support. You also have to enroll in Nothing's developer program to buy the phone in the US; once you're accepted, you can buy it.\n\nSpecs:Display: 6.7 inch, 120 Hz, AMOLEDProcessor and RAM: MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro with 8 GB or 12 GB RAMStorage: 128 and 256 GB optionsBattery: 5,000 mAhCameras: 50-MP main camera, 50-MP ultrawide, 32-MP selfie cameraUpdates (from date of manufacture): 3 OS upgrades, 4 years of security updatesExtras: IP54, fingerprint unlock, NFC, Glyph lightsCarrier compatibility: Works on T-Mobile and AT&T; doesn't work on Verizon\n\nWe test a ton of Android phones. We like the ones below, but you'll be better off with one of the options above. If you haven't yet done so, check out our Best Cheap Phones and Best Folding Phones guides for more.\n\nGoogle Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro for $670 and $740: Google's annual Pixel hardware event is around the corner (August 13), so this is not a good time to buy a Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends). They'll likely start seeing steep discounts in the coming weeks following the launch of the Pixel 9 series. The Pixel 8 series is still my favorite Android phone, delivering seven years of software updates, powerful performance, and an excellent camera system—the ultrawide on the Pixel 8 Pro is one of the best in the business. There's now secure Face Unlock, which means you can use your mug as biometric authentication to get into banking apps, but it's not effective in low light so the fingerprint sensor is still present as a secondary option. The reason to buy Pixel phones is the smart software features, like Magic Editor, Audio Magic Eraser, and Best Take, you get a powerful suite of features that are genuinely helpful every day. Be sure to check out our Best Pixel Phones, guide, where we've got case and accessory recommendations.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold6 for $1,900: The Fold6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) remains an excellent big-screen folding smartphone. If you're worried about durability and repairability when purchasing a fold, Samsung is your best bet as it has just been producing these devices for the longest time. The cameras snap great photos, the displays get shockingly bright, and Samsung promises lengthy software support. The Fold6's exterior screen is slightly wider and much nicer to use than previous iterations, but otherwise, there are not a ton of new changes outside of AI advancements. You can still snag last year's Galaxy Z Fold5 to save some dough.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip6 for $1,100: The Flip6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has some perks over Motorola's new Razr+, like a nicer hinge mechanism, better build quality, stronger cameras, and longer software support. But I still preferred the overall experience on Motorola's flip, mostly due to the larger external screen. Still, the Flip6's 3.4-inch cover screen is handy for glancing through widgets, and you can open it up to get a big-screen Android phone experience. The Galaxy Z Flip5 is a worthy option to consider if you don't mind buying last year's tech at a lower price.\n\nMotorola Moto G Play 2024 for $130: On a tight budget? This Motorola phone doesn't have NFC for contactless payments, nor does it support 5G. It'll also only get one Android OS upgrade. That said, performance was pretty good in my time testing it, and the 6.5-inch LCD screen was readable in sunny conditions.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S23 FE for $600: I used this phone for several weeks and found it was more than enough to meet my needs. The cameras are surprisingly decent—you even get a usable 3X optical zoom, though its results are not as excellent as the ones from the Galaxy S23. The performance gave me zero issues, and the battery often lasted me a little more than a day with average use. The 6.4-inch screen is a pretty nice size that's not too big and not too small, and you still get perks like wireless charging and a 120-Hz screen refresh rate. It has dipped as low as $400 during Cyber Monday, so I highly recommend you wait for a sale.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S23 Series ($700+): It seems like last year's Galaxy S23 range (9/10, WIRED Recommends) may be disappearing faster than usual, as stock is low across a variety of retailers. If you can find them, the 6.1-inch Galaxy S23, the 6.6-inch S23+, and the massive 6.8-inch S23 Ultra are full of high-end features, from the powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset that keeps even the most demanding games running beautifully to the fluid and bright 120-Hz AMOLED displays. Battery life has improved across the board, with the S23 comfortably lasting more than a day and the S23 Ultra hitting nearly two full days with average use. The triple camera systems are the highlight, delivering remarkable results whether it's day or night. The S23 Ultra has the special 10X optical zoom camera, which is no longer available on the latest S24 Ultra, and I miss it. It was nice being able to capture sharp photos of objects far away. It's the only phone in the trio with the embedded S Pen stylus if you like to doodle. Try to avoid the MSRP since they're a year old; sometimes, these prices match the latest models, which is a bad deal.\n\nOnePlus Open for $1,400: The OnePlus Open (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the first folding smartphone from OnePlus, and it's surprisingly good. OnePlus has some clever software trickery to make multitasking on this booklike foldable simple and effective. The camera system delivers good results, the screens get plenty bright, and the battery life is excellent. I just wish the water resistance was better and that it had wireless charging.\n\nXiaomi Poco X6 for £319 and X6 Pro for £369: Not in the US? You should take a look at the Poxo X6 or Poco X6 Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends). These are speedy phones considering the low prices, with great displays, and decent battery life, plus the X6 even has a headphone jack! It's a shame there's a lot of bloatware, limited water resistance, and the cameras are lackluster.\n\nWe recommend unlocked phones in this guide. When a phone is sold as unlocked, that means it can be used on multiple wireless carriers and networks. When you buy a phone directly from your wireless carrier, usually on a payment plan, it often comes locked to that network. Carriers are legally required to unlock a phone upon request so you can switch networks, but it's a big hassle. Try to pay full price for your phone, or make sure it specifically says it's unlocked. If you feel it's too expensive to buy outright, that's a good sign you should find a cheaper model. Buy it from the manufacturer directly, or investigate your carrier's policies for unlocking phones if they're bought on a payment plan that requires you to use its network.\n\nVerizon tips: Buying an unlocked phone is smart, but even if you do the smart thing, networks like Verizon will put up hoops for you to jump through. If you insert your SIM card but still have trouble receiving text messages or something else, contact customer service and have them enable \"CDMA-Less roaming.\" This Motorola guide may help. The steps should be similar for other phones.\n\nSub-6 or millimeter wave 5G? Most new smartphones these days support 5G, the latest generation of network connectivity. If the phone you're looking at doesn't support 5G—don't fret! 4G LTE isn't going anywhere yet. Don't feel pressured to upgrade to a 5G phone or plan. That said, you do need a 5G-enabled smartphone if you want to make use of 5G speeds. The technology comes in two primary flavors: sub-6 and millimeter wave (mmWave). The latter is often exclusive to flagship devices, but even then, not every pricey Android phone supports it. We have a guide that explains it all, but in short, mmWave lets you access super-fast 5G speeds, though its range is severely limited and the areas you'll find it in are rare (think stadiums and airports, plus some spots in major cities). Sub-6 is much more commonplace, the type of 5G you'll run into most often. It has a broader range and delivers faster speeds over 4G LTE (but nowhere near as fast as mmWave). Coverage still isn't as widespread as LTE. It's ideal if the phone you're buying supports both (especially if you're paying $700 or more), but having sub-6 alone is also totally fine.\n\nThe best way to switch phones is to follow the setup prompts when you first boot up your new device—make sure you transfer data from an old phone via a cable. Some manufacturers, like Samsung, will suggest you download a proprietary data transfer app on your old device, like Smart Switch, and you should. It means less work for you—whether it's fewer apps you need to sign into or fewer icons you need to rearrange. Check out our tips on setting up your new Android phone for more.\n\nWe have case recommendations for a few popular devices, like Samsung's Galaxy S24, Galaxy S23, and S22 range or Google Pixel phones. It's smart to slap a case on these glass sandwiches and even a screen protector to keep the display free of scuffs and scratches. Here are a few other noteworthy accessories, including charging adapters, which many phones don't include anymore. Read our Best USB-C Cables guide for other recommendations.\n\nAnker Nano 3 30-Watt Charger for $20: This tiny charger will be all most people need to charge most smartphones. It's compact, reliable, and cheap, plus the prongs fold up.\n\nSatechi 108-Watt USB-C Charger for $75: A single-port charger can be annoying. This one from Satechi is slim enough to tote everywhere (with folding prongs), but it can fast-charge practically any Android phone at the highest speeds possible and still have enough power to juice up a laptop or tablet. If you want a USB-A and USB-C port, I like this 65-watt model from Nimble.\n\nPeak Design Samsung and Pixel Everyday Case for $50: If you have a Samsung or Pixel phone and you frequently mount your phone to a bike or scooter, you owe it to yourself to snag this case and Peak Design's bike mount. The case snaps perfectly into the mount, is dead simple to release, and has yet to fall off after years of riding. Peak Design also sells several other accessories you can attach to the back of these cases, bringing Android into Apple's MagSafe ecosystem.\n\nNimble Champ Portable Charger 10,000 mAh for $60: This portable battery is small enough to leave in a bag but has enough power to fully recharge your phone once or twice. There's a USB-C and USB-A port, it delivers 18 watts of power, so it can recharge your tablet or phone, and it's housed in 73 percent post-consumer plastic with plastic-free packaging.\n\nNomad ChargeKey for $25: When your phone dies, it's almost always when you forget to bring a charger or battery pack. The ChargeKey is a nifty solution—it's like clipping a tiny USB-C charging cable to your keychain. Just plug one end into your phone and the other into any kind of power source (a friend's phone or a charging adapter if you manage to find one), and you can top up your phone.\n\nChoose a Wireless Charger: Our guide to the best wireless chargers includes dozens of models in varying colors, shapes, and materials, and even some designed for specific phones. Not every Android phone supports wireless charging, but it's a luxury you'll want to take advantage of. Take a gander at our guide for our favorites."
