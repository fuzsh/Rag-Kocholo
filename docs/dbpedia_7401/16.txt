The Xperia P smartphone has a full aluminium unibody.

Experience beauty. Distinctive design.

The Xperia P Android phone stands out with its distinctive, minimalistic design.

Like all phones in the Sony Xperia NXT series, it has a simple, strong design language. And Xperia P takes it one step further – the precision crafted, full aluminium unibody gives this Android phone a unique, durable and modern look.

A clear display, even in bright sunlight.

Lounging in the sun, enjoying a YouTube clip or your favourite movie?

The 4(10.16 cm) Reality Display powered by the Mobile BRAVIA® Engine also includes Sony’s unique WhiteMagic™ technology, making the colours in your favourite clips and stills look as sharp and clear as if you were inside.

WhiteMagic adds a 4th white sub-pixel – traditional LCD screens have three; red, green and blue – to the Reality Display. The result? The outstanding combination of an ultra-bright screen and great power efficiency. Power efficient because WhiteMagic automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen to surrounding light – when the light is not so strong, Sony Xperia P uses less battery power.

WhiteMagic™ technology – this is how it works

A second from sleep to snap in just over a second with the Xperia P Android smartphone.
