Saint Alphonsa

Feast Day – July 28

Saint Alphonsa , who at the age of 7 had dedicated herself to serving Jesus Christ calling Him “My Divine Spouse” was born on August 19, 1910 at Kudamalur in the Arpookara region, in the diocese of Changanacherry, Kerala. On August 28, the child was baptised and she received the name Annakutty Muttathupadathu. She was the last of five children. Her mother died three months later. Annakutty spent her early infancy in the home of her grandparents in Elumparambil.

In order to get out of marriage, she reached the point of voluntarily causing herself a grave burn by placing her foot in a heap of burning embers. It was Fr. James Muricken, her confessor, who directed her towards Franciscan spirituality and put her in contact with the Congregation of the Franciscan Clarists. Annakutty entered their college in Bharananganam in the diocese of Palai, to attend Class VII, as an intern student, on May 24, 1927.

The following year, Annakutty began her postulancy, taking the name of Alphonsa of the Immaculate Conception in honour of St. Alphonsus Liguori.

The period 1930-1935 was characterised by grave illness and moral suffering. The canonical novitiate was introduced into the Congregation of the Franciscan Clarists in 1934. Her spiritual heroism remained hidden from all except those who moved closely with her. Saint Alphonsa, the passion flower of Bharananganam, proclaims to the world that temporal sufferings accepted with faith and love have a value for eternity.

After a series of serious health problems, and with the attitude of a victim for the love of the Lord, happy until the final moment and with a smile always on her lips, Alphonsa joyfully brought her earthly journey to a close in the Convent of the Franciscan Clarists at Bharananganam on July 28, 1946, leaving behind the memory of a Sister full of love and a Saint.

Alphonsa was buried at St. Mary’s Catholic Church, Bharananganam, Kottayam District, Kerala, in the Diocese of Palai.

On Sunday, October 12, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI announced her canonization at a ceremony at Saint Peter’s Square, Rome.

SAINT EUPHRASIA ELUVATHINGAL

Feast Day – August 29

Saint Euphrasia Eluvathingal was born Rosa Eluvathingal on October 17, 1877 in a Syro-Malabar Catholic Nasrani family in Kattoor, Irinjalakuda, Thrissur District, Kerala.

Little Rosa’s heart desired only God. A good evidence of this is her offer of her virginity to God at the tender age of 9. After overcoming many obstacles she was able by the grace of God to become a member of the boarding of the Kerala Carmelite Congregation (founded by Saint Kuriakose Elias Chavara in 1866 at Koonammavu).

Saint Euphrasia grew in humility, poverty and holiness as she completely obeyed the Will of God every moment. The whole life of this virgin was full of continuous prayer, penance and reparation.

She endeavoured to lead a life of constant prayer and devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and came to be known to many people as the “Praying Mother”.

At the age of 75 years, Euphrasia the Praying Mother passed away in the Convent at Ollur on August 29, 1952. It was a wonder that the Church bell at Cheralayam Parish began to ring nonstop on her passing away.

At a special mass held at St. Peter’s Square at Vatican City, Rome on November 23, 2014, Pope Francis canonized Euphrasia as a Saint. Saint Euphrasia’s tomb has become a pilgrimage site as miracles have been reported by some of the faithful.
