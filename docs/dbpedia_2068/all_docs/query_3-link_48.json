        "text": "From: Antony Mathew\n\nMrs. Catherine Ullattikulam, whom we used to address as Ammachi was a gem of a person and very dignified in her dealings with all of us. She was a kind and loving person who was a very considerate listener and though soft spoken was very attentive to all of us and had the utmost respect and caring for all those who had the good fortune to interact with her. She was indeed very pious and this is the reason why she passed away so peacefully after having had ample time to receive the final sacraments. May Jesus bestow on her everlasting glory in heaven. Bye Ammachi from myself, Molly, Jeethu, Leeza, Meetu and Thomas."
