It was initially my hope to try to have this done as part of Esperanza's proposal for an appreciation week to end on Wikipedia Day, January 15. However, several people have once again proposed the entirety of Esperanza for deletion, so that might not work. It was the intention of the Appreciation Week proposal to set aside a given time when the various individuals who have made significant, valuable contributions to the encyclopedia would be recognized and honored. I believe that, with some effort, this could still be done. My proposal is to, with luck, try to organize the various WikiProjects and other entities of wikipedia to take part in a larger celebrartion of its contributors to take place in January, probably beginning January 15, 2007. I have created yet another new subpage for myself (a weakness of mine, I'm afraid) at User talk:Badbilltucker/Appreciation Week where I would greatly appreciate any indications from the members of this project as to whether and how they might be willing and/or able to assist in recognizing the contributions of our editors. Thank you for your attention. Badbilltucker\n\ncreated category for Malayali scientists--Kathanar\n\nGood job! I've added it to the categories list on the portal.\n\nOn a related note, it is high time we created a few more stub categories. Category:Kerala stubs is becoming very large. We could pool in the suggestions here (examples include {{Kerala-history-stub}} or {{Kerala-politics-stub}}) and later take them to Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals for approval.--thunderboltz(Deepu)\n\nI've created a category for Sree Narayana Guru, his influence is a movement unto itself, but has no identifying name, so I've used his name. If anyone knows a name, preferably something identifiable and specific to him, they are welcome to change the category. Thanks!--Kathanar\n\nA Achayan article has been created, could use help in checking over. I'm starting to look for citations, any help in that would be welcomed also--Kathanar\n\nSomebody moved Prem Nazir to Abdul Khader. It should be reversed as Prem Nazir is by far the better known name. Tintin\n\nArticle on Dr. Joy Cherian created, former head of the US EEOC, anyone know what he's been up to lately? Just found some past stuff about him. --Kathanar\n\nI have expanded the article to a more credible level. Still needs added info. jojo@nthony 06:45, 10 April 2014 (UTC)\n\nA category made for Keralite americans, can be even of partial descent as long as some part of the family originated from Kerala.--Kathanar\n\nA move has been made to Merge Category:Keralite americans to Category:Indian Americans. I think that as a distinct culture region and ethnicity for centuries, there deserves to be a category citing people(americans) with any connection of origin there. If you wish to put your thoughts go to Here --Kathanar\n\nArticle created for a great athelete of Kerala M D Valsamma\n\nsumal\n\nI think you may have to rewrite it in your words because the Ministry of Sports portal, though an Indian govt site, is not in the public domain. Tintin\n\nwell I have edited it to reword it and make it look better. See if you can make it better --Agεθ020 (ΔT • ФC)\n\nI too modified it a little. Tintin\n\nThe article is undergoing a featured article nomination. So, just give your opinion on it over here [1]. --Agεθ020 (ΔT • ФC)\n\nTechnopark, Kerala has been promoted to a Featured Article. Thanks everyone for all the help and support. --Ajaypp (I am here..)\n\nI remember there was a guy, I think his name was Unni Warrier, who is a CEO of a sucessful Silicon Valley Fortune 500 company. Does anyone know who that is, I wanted to do a article on him start doing other malayali businessmen, a area that doesn't get explored often for malayalis.--Kathanar\n\nWikipedia already has an article on him. See Unni Warrier. Is he the same person you are referring to?--thunderboltz(TALK)\n\nAwesome!,Thanks Deepu, I should of checked, I only just remembered today what his first name was, which I edited into the comment. O.k. , one down, now gotta find some more to go. Thanks again --Kathanar\n\n:-) Good luck!--thunderboltz(TALK)\n\nCategory created for Malayali business people--Kathanar\n\nI recently came across this article, which seemed to be on the path to an AFD/speedy-delete [2], and added enough content to establish notability. Can editors more knowledgeable about the subject and with better access to related sources, assess my additions and add further content ? Thanks. Abecedare\n\nthe picture on the page is of sree narayana guru. since there is no other pictures of V.T, people may get confused???\n\nFlyingdreams (talk)\n\nA new user has added a lot of information to Malayali. He told me that since he is not that familiar with Wikipedia, there is probably a need for wikification and copyediting. I took a look at the article and I would have go through and edited it and fixed it up myself, except that I'm rather busy at work and my activities on Wikipedia are limited to performing minor edits and such. I thought I'd post this here to alert other Malayalee Wikipedians of this fact. I also propose moving the article from Malayali to Malayalee. The latter seems to be the more common spelling. --vi5in[talk]\n\nI have uploaded a better quality photo of Athirapilly falls. (View from below). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Athirapilly_falls_summer.jpg May be this one can be used as the title image for the articles Athirappilly_Falls and Athirapilly, where a low quality picture is used now. Sangfroid\n\nThe Malayali scientist category is being put up for deletion at [3]. Please participate to let your voice be known. --Kathanar\n\nI have created this article who holds the record for writing the longest novel in Malayalam, Avakaasikal. I wonder if anyone could help expand it.--Agεθ020 (ΔT • ФC)\n\nIt had been suggested to make a article on Dr. Kumar Bahuleyan. He is a neurosurgeon from Chemmanakary, Kerala who overcame great odds (came from a poor dalit background). He then turns around and donates 20 million dollars to this village to give back to the people who raised and help him. I think its a worthy piece if someone wants to pursue it. Check out this article [4] which says a little a bit about him, as well as google him.--Kathanar\n\nComments needed about notability needed there Corpx\n\nHi,\n\nI was wondering what ever happened to Malayalam fonts since on the Malayalam pages and the Malayalam Wikipedia itself it is filled with a bunch of question marks. I have raised this issue on our WikiProject Dravidian civilizations here. Is there a way to get the Malayalam font back up and working again on Wikipedia? Wiki Raja\n\nHmm? It looks as good to me as it ever did! Only problem on my computer (or maybe just browser) is that the font looks small. I find the same thing happens with the Bengali font, too. --Kuaichik\n\nChalachitra Academy is a requested article under our tasks. I created the article for the Chalachitra Academy as Kerala State Chalachitra Academy--Anoopkn (talk)\n\nPlease check the article Kolath. Can anyone provide some accuracy of whether to keep this article or not? Earlier, I thought of nominating this to AfD, but still in search of some valuable opinions. Hence I placed expert-need tag. Thank you.--Avinesh Jose T\n\nYes, the article does not belong on an encyclopedia. There are many other such non-encyclopedic genealogical entries from Kerala on Wikipedia. These need to go as well. In this case, much of the historical stuff given there is widely disputed too.--thunderboltz(TALK)\n\nAnother editor created an article on Vadakkanthara. It should probably be cleaned up and expanded. --Eastmain (talk)\n\nI've made an attempt. --Avinesh Jose T\n\nAnother editor created an article on Vellimadukunnu without any references. It would be helpful if someone could add at least one reference to the article. --Eastmain (talk)\n\nA bunch of Non-notable articles with no proper references (all related to different casts in Kerala). The details are mentioned by anonymous user in Kolath’s DRV. Another list is available here also. Can anyone comment whether to keep these or nominate group deletion? I think just to mention about different casts Caste system in Kerala is ok, no seperate articles required since no sources available.\n\n--Avinesh Jose T\n\nAgree with you. All those surname pages have to go. Go ahead and afd them.--thunderboltz(TALK)\n\nHey guys, a user has requested more users with local knowledge (in his words: \"I am requesting more authentic comments from Wikiadmins from this part of the world as they have more knowledge about the history here.\") to contribute to a discussion regarding the deletion of Pakalomattom Ayrookuzhiyil and Pakalomattom, both of which are basically genealogical ancestries and other non-notable bits of unsourcable information (or, more accurately, information for which reliable sources cannot be given). Please comment on the nomination page with your response to keep or delete and please provide discussion that addresses matters raised on the page. Thanks guys, this should help to resolve things. --rm 'w avu\n\nMe as one of the main contributor to these articles Pakalomattom and Pakalomattom Ayrookuzhiyil welcome your kind inputs to this AFD discussion.

Thanks. --Avinesh Jose T\n\nwhat's karelam(malayalam text) —Preceding unsigned comment added by 121.247.152.226 (talk)\n\nExpanded the article with filmography and additonal references. jojo@nthony 12:22, 8 April 2014 (UTC)\n\nI have added {{WP India}} banner and kerala=yes tag and assessed lots of articles recently See logs .

Thanks, Ganeshk (talk)\n\nAs you may have heard, we at the Wikipedia 1.0 Editorial Team recently made some changes to the assessment scale, including the addition of a new level. The new description is available at WP:ASSESS.\n\nThe new C-Class represents articles that are beyond the basic Start-Class, but which need additional references or cleanup to meet the standards for B-Class.\n\nThe criteria for B-Class have been tightened up with the addition of a rubric, and are now more in line with the stricter standards already used at some projects.\n\nA-Class article reviews will now need more than one person, as described here.\n\nEach WikiProject should already have a new C-Class category at Category:C-Class_articles. If your project elects not to use the new level, you can simply delete your WikiProject's C-Class category and clarify any amendments on your project's assessment/discussion pages. The bot is already finding and listing C-Class articles.\n\nPlease leave a message with us if you have any queries regarding the introduction of the revised scheme.

The Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team has made an automated selection of articles for Version 0.7.\n\nWe would like to ask you to review the articles selected from this project. These were chosen from the articles with this project's talk page tag, based on the rated importance and quality. If there are any specific articles that should be removed, please let us know at Wikipedia talk:Version 0.7. You can also nominate additional articles for release, following the procedure at Wikipedia:Release Version Nominations.\n\nA list of selected articles with cleanup tags, sorted by project, is available. The list is automatically updated each hour when it is loaded. Please try to fix any urgent problems in the selected articles. A team of copyeditors has agreed to help with copyediting requests, although you should try to fix simple issues on your own if possible.\n\nWe would also appreciate your help in identifying the version of each article that you think we should use, to help avoid vandalism or POV issues. These versions can be recorded at this project's subpage of User:SelectionBot/0.7. We are planning to release the selection for the holiday season, so we ask you to select the revisions before October 20. At that time, we will use an automatic process to identify which version of each article to release, if no version has been manually selected. Thanks!

This site can be treated as a knowledge sharing area of kerala temples, rather than a travel guide portal.

It is very unfortunate that no admins from wiki project kerala patrolling Ezhava and Nair articles in wikipedia as they are getting vandalised by western editors. They referring old and untrustworthy books and changing the articles content. There are many issues with articles neutrality. Happened to see these articles a few months ago and as per Wiki rules tried to talk in the talk page but a stubborn editor is reluctant to make any changes even though reliable source books have been produced to prove that article's content having serious issues.\n\nPOV Tag has been taken off from the article without even a consensus in the talk page\n\nNair has been categorised as \"Shudra\" caste which is wrong and many contributors brought up this issue, but no use. Ezhava having so much other issues.\n\nWe are malayalees and i think we have got right than anyone else to protect our castes and culture as wikipedia is the primary source of knowledge for many people. I request to all admins in this talk board to have a look the communication in Ezhava and Nair talk pages. These wiki pages are kerala related and we should involve and do something now.\n\nAbove mentioned editor is a veteran and no other admins are ready to take any action. We must action now or it will be too late to do something. An article thiyyar was created and was in the main space but its been deleted by admins who are only ready to listen above mentioned editors words and these admins blocking all the other contributors who have a different opinion in the talk page.\n\nMy account was blocked for 3 days recently for questioning an admins actions. Its controversial for western admins because they dont know anything about indian castes and cultures, I believe it is not at all controversial for indian editors or admins who know the culture and system here. If you look my talk page or ezhava / nair talk page, you can understand the situation.\n\nSources i have supplied and recognised by WP:RSN [[5]] but its been rejected by other admins. This is one of many reliable sources supplied.\n\nMy complaint against admin but they taken action against me. http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&oldid=548546907#Boing.21_said_Zebedee\n\nSince these article contents closely related to Kerala, I wonder why they been controlled / patrolled by western admins. Why admins from (Kerala / India) cant involve in this. Hopeless here and dont know what to do. irajeevwiki talk\n\nPlease see Talk:Kerala#Massive removal of content. Thanks, Anna Frodesiak (talk)\n\nHello Everybody,\n\nI would like to bring to this group's attention about the inaccurate information being added to Appam food page. Efforts to keep the information neutral is being reverted and repeatedly overwritten by folks who seem to take narrow minded approach based on false interpretation of the facts. All information from other regions and countries are being reverted without proper explanation and contents are being saturated and monopolized by attributing everything to a particular community. I know contents of this page are not of much importance. However, as an article supported by both WikiProject Kerala and WikiProject TamilNadu, I strongly feel that it should represent facts and also be neutral as per Wikipedia guidelines.MariaJeyaraj (talk)\n\nAn editor has requested input at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sankar (film director) regading Sankar (film director) from this WikiProject.

As you may already know, most WikiProjects here on Wikipedia struggle to stay active after they've been founded. I believe there is a lot of potential for WikiProjects to facilitate collaboration across subject areas, so I have submitted a grant proposal with the Wikimedia Foundation for the \"WikiProject X\" project. WikiProject X will study what makes WikiProjects succeed in retaining editors and then design a prototype WikiProject system that will recruit contributors to WikiProjects and help them run effectively. Please review the proposal here and leave feedback. If you have any questions, you can ask on the proposal page or leave a message on my talk page. Thank you for your time! (Also, sorry about the posting mistake earlier. If someone already moved my message to the talk page, feel free to remove this posting.)

In our first phase, we are focusing on research. At this time, we are looking for people to share their experiences with WikiProjects: good, bad, or neutral. We are also looking for WikiProjects that may be interested in trying out new tools and layouts that will make participating easier and projects easier to maintain. If you or your WikiProject are interested, check us out! Note that this is an opt-in program; no WikiProject will be required to change anything against its wishes.

They are the influential Hindu community of prominence in north Malabar, being financially sound and greater in numerical strength. Considered to be highly educated and advanced in every walk of life they were regarded as a forward caste during the British period when Malabar was part of Madras province. As a community they are considered to be emotionally strong with deeper social values thus reacting sharply to injustice and social bigotry.\n\nReviews needed for Wikipedia:Featured list candidates/Kerala State Film Award for Best Actor/archive1. --Charles Turing (talk)\n\nWhat is the abbreviation used for dates in the Malayalam calendar?

In place of static copied and pasted excerpts will be self-updating excerpts displayed through selective transclusion, using the template {{Transclude lead excerpt}}.\n\nThe discussion about this can be found here.\n\nMaintainers of specific portals are encouraged to sign up as project members here, noting the portals they maintain, so that those portals are skipped by the maintenance pass. Currently, we are interested in upgrading neglected and abandoned portals. There will be opportunity for maintained portals to opt-in later, or the portal maintainers can handle upgrading (the portals they maintain) personally at any time.\n\nBackground\n\nOn April 8th, 2018, an RfC (\"Request for comment\") proposal was made to eliminate all portals and the portal namespace. On April 17th, the Portals WikiProject was rebooted to handle the revitalization of the portal system. On May 12th, the RfC was closed with the result to keep portals, by a margin of about 2 to 1 in favor of keeping portals.\n\nThere's an article in the current edition of the Signpost interviewing project members about the RfC and the Portals WikiProject.\n\nSince the reboot, the Portals WikiProject has been busy building tools and components to upgrade portals.\n\nSo far, 84 editors have joined.\n\nIf you would like to keep abreast of what is happening with portals, see the newsletter archive.\n\nIf you have any questions about what is happening with portals or the Portals WikiProject, please post them on the WikiProject's talk page.\n\nThank you. — The Transhumanist\n\nPathadippalam needs attention.
