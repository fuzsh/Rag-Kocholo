        "text": "This paper examines the ecclesiology of Saint Augustine from an autobiographical point of view. It takes into consideration the various stages in which his understanding of the Church unfolded. As a child, he clung to Mother Church at a time of a mortal peril through the devotion of his mother, Monica. Having overcome the turmoil of his reckless adolescence and the period of his wandering in the sects, and thanks to the providential turn of his professional experience, he rediscovered the Church at Milan through the ministry of Bishop Ambrose. After his conversion, he gave up the ideals of a quiet, contemplative life he had in view, to make himself the servant of the Church he wholeheartedly loved. But he lived this reality in the tension between silence and service. And that should be the ideal of those who have him as their Spiritual Father and all who are involved in pastoral ministry."
