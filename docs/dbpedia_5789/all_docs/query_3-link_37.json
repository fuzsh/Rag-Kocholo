And there’s no connection to you, because according to the mark? It was their idea.\n\nThey’ll believe it was their idea so much that if you told them what really happened, they’d call you a liar.\n\nAll because you planted an idea into another person’s subconscious. You manipulated them better than a Taco Bell commercial. You made them think it was THEIR idea to order drive-thru at midnight.\n\nThey’ll never know it was YOUR idea.\n\nBad news, though. Well, depending on your point of view, it could be good news.\n\nWhat you’ll never know — or wouldn’t if not for this article — is that it wasn’t your idea, either. The idea came from that amazing segment at the end of the Philip DeFranco Show with footage of the new Taco Bell Defy.\n\nBut from another point of view…does that make a difference?"
