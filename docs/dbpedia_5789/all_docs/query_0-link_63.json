        "text": "How to Write a Compelling Science Fiction Movie\n\nWhile science fiction movies can be exhilarating to watch, they can be just as daunting to write.\n\nHow do you create a captivating and believable story world? What amount of exposition is necessary for introducing sci-fi elements? How do writers not lose track of the character arc and plot?\n\nIf written properly, the science fiction genre has the potential to do more than elicit emotion and entertain. It can inspire real-world ideas.\n\nAs James Cameron puts it in his interview with Christopher Nolan:\n\n“Isn’t that the great virtuous circle of science fiction? That we imagine these things and then fairly competent minds write science fiction and propose ideas and then inspire scientists who then go out and find out what things really are.”\n\n– James Cameron\n\nYes, that is great. But how does a screenwriter achieve that?\n\nBelow are screenwriting tips that might help you in developing the next epic science fiction movie / tv show.\n\nWorld Building in Science Fiction\n\nIt’s tempting to get lost in the glitz and glamour of unique elements and special effects. This is especially true in science fiction movies.\n\nHowever, that doesn’t necessarily mean good storytelling. Setting a world 1,000 years in the future, with epic galactic space ships might look cool. But that doesn’t help the audience in building empathy either.\n\nRather, thrilling science fiction movies often establish empathy by building a world that still feels recognizable and draws the audience into saying, “I get that” or “I can see that being possible.”\n\nTake the THE MARTIAN for example:\n\nHumans are just beginning to land on Mars, but struggling to adjust to its atmosphere and overall environment.\n\nAnd that’s understandable. Audiences don’t need to be employed by Elon Musk to grasp what the early challenges of landing on Mars might look like.\n\nAs such, we can empathize with Mark Watney’s struggle to survive on the planet long enough to escape.\n\nHere are some other sci-fi movie twists on current technologies and psychology:\n\nWe know virtual reality exists. So what if it’s turned into a world-wide video game phenomenon? (READY PLAYER ONE)\n\nAI is in the making, but what if AI was so human-like, we truly felt attracted to one? (EX MACHINA, or HER)\n\nWe all understand the importance of dreams. So what if we could inhabit the dreams of others? (INCEPTION)\n\nTwist modern day phenomenons or technologies to make even the most complex sci-fi world more empathetical.\n\nHer Movie CLIP - Are These Feelings Real (2013) - Joaquin Phoenix Movie HD\n\nEstablishing Story World Rules: Batman Begins vs Man of Steel\n\nCreating the story world of a science fiction movie also sets the foundation for how characters exist. Their actions and relationships are thus based on the story world’s rules.\n\nAre we in a world grounded in reality? Do alien-machines govern the world?\n\nWithout such rules, the story loses credibility. If broken, the story risks no longer being believable.\n\nFor example, in the grounded world of BATMAN BEGINS, Bruce Wayne doesn’t possess unlimited gadgets or perfected training (which was present in previous stylized adaptations).\n\nRather…\n\nYoung Bruce Wayne begins with a dysfunctional understanding of justice.\n\nHe needs discipline, training, and control.\n\nPsychologically, he suffers from trauma as his fear of bats led to his parents’ death.\n\nWhen Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham, he doesn’t just become Batman. He uses Wayne Enterprise as a resourceful billionaire to equip himself discretely (Remember, this is a real-world setting. Bruce’s identity as Batman is thus at constant risk of being discovered).\n\nCheck out how rules shift in the worlds of MAN OF STEEL…\n\nOn Krypton:\n\nThe movie opens with Cal-EL inheriting the powers of Krypton as a baby in a more advanced world.\n\nWithin this world’s rules, the Kryptonian race can exhibit their immense power.\n\nWe see advanced spaceships, laser-powered technologies, and unique creatures.\n\nHowever, that all changes when Cal EL / Clark Kent is growing up on Earth.\n\nOn Earth:\n\nThe world has become grounded and less advanced for Clark Kent.\n\nHe in turn, struggles to channel and embrace his powers while chaotically rediscovering them within the less-advanced world of Earth.\n\nThis ultimately feeds into his internal motivation to find self-acceptance.\n\nBy following the rules for each world, David S. Goyer develops credible characters that are believable within the scope of science fiction.\n\nMan of Steel - Opening (Krypton) [Part 1]\n\nEstablishing Story World Rules: Interstellar vs Star Wars: The Force Awakens\n\nHere are two space movies with vastly different rules, but that achieve the same credible standard.\n\nIn INTERSTELLAR:\n\nThe space crew doesn’t travel backwards in time or warp through space in light-speed.\n\nThough INTERSTELLAR is set in the future, the world is not so advanced enough to break away from the current laws of physics.\n\nAlternatively…\n\nIn STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS, the rules shift greatly.\n\nThe story world is set in a far more advanced galactic empire with superior technology.\n\nHere, light speed is possible along with the magnetic energy of The Force.\n\nStill, characters are not all-powerful. Kylo Ren must still practice as an apprentice to learn powers of the Dark Side. Rey is trained to wield the The Force.\n\nShow the rules to the story world gradually. Allow your character to learn the elements as the story progresses.\n\nAnd if a new element breaks the world’s rule, write the appropriate reaction or action taken by the characters.\n\nInterstellar - Trailer - Official Warner Bros. UK\n\nShow Don’t Tell in Science Fiction\n\nThe first 10 pages before the inciting incident is the most effective opportunity for a screenwriter to introduce the protagonist and their story world.\n\nBut that’s easier said than done for a science fiction movie.\n\nOften times, sci-fi/fantasy screenwriters feel compelled to pile exposition early on in the script in order to get the audience on board with their new world.\n\nHowever, this can often deflate audiences, especially with massive exposition in dialogue early on.\n\nSo how does a sci fi screenwriter avoid this pitfall? Show don’t tell. The key here is to seduce the audience into your story gradually.\n\nFor example, check out the beats of Jake Sully’s gradual immersion into the world of Pandora in James Cameron’s AVATAR:\n\nJake wakes up to floating bubbles (indicating we’re in space).\n\nHe finds himself within a spaceship (audience now knows he’s traveling to a planet).\n\nWhen he lands on Pandora, the tires of a massive vehicle have been shot with Na’vi arrows (the audience can imagine possible dangers lurking).\n\nAnd Colonel Quarritch (Stephen Lang) has 3 gashes scraped across his eye (more unforeseen danger becomes mysterious and imaginable).\n\nSee how each element almost certainly makes the audience beg for more?\n\nThe story has gradually introduced Jake Sully, and the audience, to Pandora, with mysteries yet to be revealed.\n\nShowing every creative element at once can be overwhelming.\n\nInstead, try gradually immersing your protagonist within the sci-fi world one element at a time.\n\nBy building mystery around these elements, readers and viewer will want to see more.\n\nStory Structure in a Science Fiction\n\nWriting a science fiction movie allows ample opportunity to make a story visually appealing, But that means more than just gripping background description.\n\nA good science fiction movie includes elements that directly shape the story structure of the hero’s journey.\n\nFor example,\n\nIn Christopher Nolan’s INTERSTELLAR, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) starts his hero’s journey when he takes off into space on a voyage to find a new habitable planet (outward motivation).\n\nIn INCEPTION, Cobb’s (Leonardo DiCaprio) point of no return occurs half way into the movie. He shares a dream with Fischer (Cillian Murphy) on a plane heading to LA. If he doesn’t plant the idea successfully, he’ll be imprisoned upon landing.\n\nIn EX MACHINA, every time the AI, Ava (Alicia Vikander) triggers a power outage, Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) learns something new. He has a self-revelation that shifts his desire from understanding Ava, to wanting to help her escape.\n\nAllowing your science fiction world to affect the protagonist can be an excellent opportunity for plot twists, self revelations, and driving the plot forward in original style.\n\nEx Machina (3/10) Movie CLIP - You Shouldn't Trust Him (2015) HD\n\nPrioritize Story and Internal Conflict\n\nWith all the elements, sci-fi/fantasy devices, super powers ominously present in Sci Fi movies, it’s all the more important to emphasize story, plot, and character.\n\nCompare the recent DC Universe with their past counterparts:\n\nIn THE DARK KNIGHT, Bruce Wayne wants to lead a normal life with Rachel hoping Harvey Dent can take his mantle. But the Joker’s battle for the soul of Gotham forces him to remain as Batman.\n\nIn THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, Bruce Wayne must grapple with his fear of death to find a life worth living so that he no longer has to be Batman. To do that, he must stop Bane’s revolution and nuclear-set explosion from destroying Gotham.\n\nIn MAN OF STEEL, Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) wants to save Earth from General Zod . But that also means risking his exposure as Superman, against the wishes of his adopted father.\n\nNotice how the DC plots rely less on stylistic or superficial power to drive the plot forward.\n\nRather, the hero’s internal conflict is shaped by familial relationships, fear of death, or a fatal flaw of possessing catastrophic superpowers.\n\nThe Battle for Gotham - The Dark Knight (7/9) Movie CLIP (2008) HD\n\nMore Originality in External Conflict\n\nA good movie or screenplay elicits emotion out of conflict.\n\nBut in science fiction, unique story elements could now be the source of conflict. In turn, the world of science fiction provides a platform for originality unlike any other genre.\n\nLet’s check out how these movies present their protagonist with dangerous external conflicts using unique sci-fi/fantasy elements.\n\nIn LIMITLESS, Eddie’s pill grants him extraordinary mental capabilities. But it also becomes a paralyzing addiction.\n\nHacking into THE MATRIX grants Neo super human abilities. But that also mean being attacked by sentinel machines while being chased by agents and police.\n\nIn ALIEN, a scientific break through of an alien discovery becomes the crew passengers’ worst nemesis.\n\nIn each example conflict is not separate from the story elements. They are fused to create original story sequences.\n\nThe creatures in AVATAR don’t just remain in the background to be visually appealing. They shape the hero’s arc.\n\nJake doesn’t just land on Toruk Makto. Rather, the great banshee acts as his new opportunity for regaining Neytiri’s trust.\n\nIntroduce your hero to phenomenons or technologies that are inviting at first glance. Then twist those sci-fi elements in a problematic way for the hero.\n\nHere’s another example from SPIDERMAN: FAR FROM HOME:\n\nPeter Parker’s EDITH sunglasses empowers him with Stark Industry technologies and weapons.\n\nThe twist is that EDITH is sophisticated beyond Peter’s control. He inadvertently orders a drone attack on his bus, and can spy on his classmates’ texts.\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home (2019) - Peter's Drone Strike Scene (2/10) | Movieclips\n\nScience Fiction Movie Villain: Believability\n\nAll too often, science fiction movies are inundated with villains lacking genuine motives, desires and fatal flaws. The resulting effect is two-fold:\n\nA two-dimensional, unoriginal villain seen in countless movies.\n\nIncreased risk of becoming an instant “pass” for an executive, agent, or manager after losing believability in the screenplay.\n\nBut villains in a great science fiction movie are never in fact, “fictitious.” At least, personality-speaking.\n\nThe villains in movies such as THE DARK KNIGHT or AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR are not just humanized.\n\nRather, their humanity is a source of emotional and compelling conflict that pits the heroes in thematic and moral dilemmas.\n\nIf the villains possess values, internal and external motivations, and flaws, then a good science fiction movie can become something more far reaching and profound.\n\nHere’s a set of stereotypical descriptions of science fiction villains that would need to be more fully developed to begin with.\n\nA vengeful Alien thirsting to destroy human life.\n\nAn evil robotic AI bent on controlling the world.\n\nA crazed terrorist seeking to wreck havoc in a metropolitan city.\n\nThese are characteristics we are all familiar with.\n\nBut now check out their actual descriptions based on the portrayal within their respective movies.\n\nA self-righteous alien committed to sacrificing half of life for the greater good (Thanos from AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR).\n\nA test-AI robot yearning to escape experimentation for freedom (Ava from EX MACHINA).\n\nA sociopath committed to showing the people of Gotham who they really are (The Joker form THE DARK KNIGHT).\n\nSuch villains don’t merely convey being evil. Rather, each possesses an external motivation fuelled by their flaws and internal motivations.\n\nSo let’s dive deeper into these 3-dimensional villains to discover their own values, internal and external motivations, and fatal flaws.\n\nTop 10 Movie Villains of All Time\n\nScience Fiction Movie Villain: Examples\n\nNo one ever thinks they’re “pure evil.” Nor should that be true just because this is science fiction.\n\nEven The Joker doesn’t admit to just “being crazy” in THE DARK KNIGHT. And if anyone still claims they are, it’s usually out of past victimization, mistreatment, or trauma.\n\nThanos in AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR:\n\nThanos might have been the Avengers’ most challenging villain. But this is not just because he was pure evil.\n\nIn fact, Thanos genuinely believes his external motivation to sacrifice half of all life is in the service of the greater good. Without this drive, he can’t achieve his destiny (internal motivation).\n\nAnd he’s conflicted. To complete his quest, he must retrieve the Soul Infinity Stone by making a sacrifice.\n\nAnd so he reluctantly kills his adopted daughter, Gamora, as part of mission to save the universe. And the burden of having to make such a sacrifice is painful, making him empathetical.\n\nAva in EX MACHINA:\n\nAVA is so humanized that it’s arguable whether she’s the villain at all.\n\nCaleb tests her in an experiment and Nathan threatens he’ll decommission her when the experiment ends.\n\nHer fear of death (internal conflict) thus provides AVA with her need to escape (external motivation).\n\nSo to do this, she doesn’t go on a ridiculous evil killing spree.\n\nInstead, she uses her integrated values of intelligence, lie-detecting senses/scanners, emotional understanding to build attraction with Caleb.\n\nAnd he’s consequently manipulated into thinking she loves him. But all for the purpose of her wanting to escape.\n\nEx Machina (5/10) Movie CLIP - Are You Attracted to Me? (2015) HD\n\nScience Fiction Movie Villain: The Joker (The Dark Knight)\n\nThe Joker is a memorable science fiction villain. Not because he’s sociopathic terrorist, but because he too has fatal flaws, internal and external motivations, and conflicts.\n\nThe Joker’s Fatal Flaw\n\nThe Joker’s scar stories, allude to how he is a victim of traumatic experience. We don’t know whether to believe the story about his father or his wife.\n\nAnd this haunting background makes The Joker three-dimensional as his values are derived from his past victimization.\n\nThug: …He’s crazy.\n\nJoker: I’m not…No I’m not.\n\nThe Joker’s Internal and External motivation\n\nFurther, The Joker is unwavering in his values. Deep down, without rules, people would destroy one another. And that’s exactly what The Joker wants to see Gotham succumb to. Chaos.\n\nJoker: …They’re only as good as the world allows them to be. You’ll see — I’ll show you … when the chips are down, these civilized people … they’ll eat each other. (Grins.) See, I’m not a monster … I’m just ahead of the curve.\n\nThe Joker doesn’t see himself as a sociopath either. Instead, he desires the satisfaction of seeing the people for whom they really are under chaos (internal motivation).\n\nJoker: … See, in their last moments, people show you who they really are.\n\nThe Joker is dark. But not evil. He’s not demon. Or loose sociopath who kills just to kill.\n\nRather, it’s the combination of his flaws, values, and motivation that makes him one of the great science fiction villains.\n\nIdentify your villains values by setting them opposite from the hero or heroes.\n\nThis allows the promised battles to be more than just a fight between good and evil.\n\nRather, the climax becomes a battle over who’s values are greater.\n\nThe Dark Knight (6/9) Movie CLIP - Agent of Chaos (2008) HD\n\nTheme in Science Fiction\n\nA theme for a science fiction movies is often lost thanks to advanced technology and superpowers being at the forefront of the idea.\n\nOne might think INCEPTION is merely about planting ideas through dreams. ARRIVAL is about Earth’s first alien contact. THE MARTIAN is about an astronaut trapped on Mars.\n\nOn the surface, that’s all true. But none of those brief descriptions deal with the movies’ theme.\n\nSo what is the theme for in screenwriting terms? At it’s core:\n\nThe theme is the author’s overall purpose for telling the story.\n\nSo in identifying the themes of such out-of-the-world movies listed above, here’s what might be found:\n\nARRIVAL – The idea that communication is the key to coexisting with one and another.\n\nINCEPTION – Dreams shape our reality.\n\nTHE MARTIAN – The human imperative to help and survive.\n\nEach movie’s theme once again deals with the human condition, or how viewers ought to live and act in accordance with others.\n\nBut how do screenwriters achieve conveying the theme of their story to the audience successfully?\n\nYou need to avoid lecturing.\n\nA common mistake is to have a character in voice-over format, or on screen, speak out the theme.\n\nThe resulting effect is a preaching form of dialogue that breaks the fourth wall for audiences.\n\nInstead:\n\nProvide your hero and villain with values. Have those values conveyed through action and dialogue.\n\nEvery-time your characters clash, the battle should really be about their values coming into conflict.\n\nIn the final battle between your characters, decide whose values will win out, between your hero and the antagonist.\n\nFor example…Let’s examine ARRIVAL to see how theme plays out.\n\nARRIVAL – International Trailer (HD)\n\nTheme in Arrival\n\nLouise Banks (Amy Adams) is the protagonist of the story, an expert on communication, and responsible for identifying what the “heptapods,” (aliens) want. CIA-agent Halpern (Michael Stuhlbard) is responsible for military operations.\n\nEvery time their paths converge, a battle takes place.\n\nThis battle is between communicating and understanding (Louise’s value) versus protection with armed forces (Agent Halpern’s value).\n\nLouise must convince Agent Halpern that the aliens may indeed not be here for war purposes. The true reason for arriving on Earth is to communicate a message with the people.\n\nIn the final battle between the two characters, communications between the global super powers break.\n\nFear sets in and Agent Halpern prepares for a military strike.\n\nLouise violates by trespassing into the military camps parameters.\n\nShe secretly steals agent Halpern’s cell phone to relay a message given to her by the aliens.\n\nThe final confrontation between the two is literally a battle of communication versus force. Agent Hapern threatens to shoot Louise for violating protocol. Louise simultaneously struggles to communicate with the leader of China before they attack the aliens.\n\nLouise manages to send the message given to her by the aliens.\n\nChina holds off its attacks which causes a domino effect in ultimately ceasing world-wide military protocol.\n\nAnd thus, through communication, Louise not only has saved the heptapods but for a brief moment, united all the global super powers.\n\nThus-\n\nIn the climax, the theme of communication comes to the forefront of the viewers’ mind.\n\nYes, Arrival is still about aliens touching down on Earth for the first time. But more deeply, it’s a story about how people and global leaders should coexist by means of communication.\n\nArrival Movie CLIP - They Need To See Me (2016) - Amy Adams Movie\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nStorytelling must continue to be at the heart of any science fiction movie. The genre is more than just about the glitz and glamour of futuristic technology, or explosive super powers.\n\nAs in any genre, a science fiction movie is most importantly about a believable story world, character flaws, and a humanizing theme.\n\nA science fiction movie is where creativity and imagination can be utilised to captivating effect. Unlike any other genre, its possibilities are often endless. This can be daunting.\n\nBut stick the principles of relatable worlds and characters and your audience will stick with you. Even in reaching out to space, the future or hitherto unimaginable worlds, humanity is always at the core.\n\nWhat did you think of this article?
