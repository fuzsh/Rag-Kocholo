        "text": "List of Famous Utopian Movies\n\nThese are some of our favorite utopian movies that depict seemingly perfect societies, usually with a major flaw. For more bleak fiction, check out our dystopian movie list.\n\nBack to the Future Part II (1989)\n\nBack to the Future Part II is the second movie of the Back to the Future trilogy. Although strictly not a classic utopian movie, it has unique comedic perspective on how people of the 1980s thought optimistic future could look like.\n\nColossus: The Forbin Project (1970)\n\nColossus: The Forbin Project (1970) is a science fiction thriller film, which was adapted from the novel \"Colossus\" by Dennis Feltham Jones. This classic SF movie describes the events that happened when the powerful supercomputer (which controlled military defense capabilities of both Soviet Union and the USA) became sentient and held the entire world as a hostage in its quest to secure world peace.\n\nDemolition Man (1993)\n\nDemolition Man is a utopian, science fiction, an action film directed by Marco Brambilla, starring Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes.
