        "text": "Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a dream snatcher. He’s an industrial spy, who steals secrets when his victims are at their most defenceless: when they are asleep, and dreaming. But he has an even rarer ability, that of inception. He can plant an idea in someone’s sleeping mind, and watch it grow and take root in reality. “The most resilient parasite is an idea,” he says.\n\nInception is a complex sci-fi thriller that lies somewhere between a James Bond film and The Matrix. Many of the film’s themes are often covered in New Scientist, so we have assembled a spoiler-free guide to the science of the movie, and all you need to know about dreams and the unconscious mind.\n\nIs it possible to directly access someone’s dreaming mind?\n\nIn the movie, the dream-snatchers use a drug called somnacin and a dream machine to upload a scenario into someone’s sleeping mind. One or more of them then go to sleep themselves, hooked up to the machine, and enter the target’s dream.\n\nThis fictional dream machine is called a Portable Automated Somnacin IntraVenous (PASIV) Device.\n\nA device does already exist that can effectively read someone’s mind. A functional MRI scanner takes snapshots of brain activity, and then the software recreates images of what the subject was looking at.\n\nThe researchers say it has the potential one day be able to record someone’s dream – without the mess and danger (or the fun) of actually sharing that dream.\n\nUsing drugs like somnacin to access a sleeping mind is not possible, but there are drugs that can drastically modulate our sleep. These include modafinal, which can promote continuous wakefulness, and new classes of sleeping pills that can deliver “super sleep”.\n\nHow can I control my dreams?\n\nThe easiest way to experience a lucid dream is to train yourself to ask, “Am I dreaming?” while you are asleep. Keen video gamers, probably because they focus on a single task for hours per day, are particularly good at lucid dreaming.\n\nThe dream team of Inception is highly trained at this, which may be why they are able to perform complex tasks – such as reading – which most normal lucid dreamers find difficult. Some of the characters in the movie have also militarised their dreamscapes, to protect themselves against the invasive dream snatchers.\n\nDo dreams have to obey the laws of physics?\n\nThis is a fondly debated topic, and Inception has it both ways. Sometimes impossible things happen – in one dream Paris gets folded like a huge sheet of paper – and optical illusions become “real”. The endless staircases created by M. C. Escher, for example, exist in Inception dreams thanks to a manipulation something like that occurring in 3D virtual environments.\n\nHowever, the dreams follow some “real life” rules. As writer and producer Jeff Warren wrote about his own dream investigations:\n\nWithout sensory input, consciousness appears to behave in predictable ways. Informal laws can be deduced, for example, the “law of self-fulfilling expectations” (what you expect to happen will happen) the “law of narrative momentum” (linger too long in one place and the dream world begins to fray).\n\nIn Inception, the dream world “frays” when external influences from the real world intrude.\n\nWhat is the function of dreams?\n\nFreud thought that dreams expressed our repressed desires. And so they do, sometimes, but much modern research suggests that dreams help in information processing and memory storage.\n\nDreams occur in both rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM sleep. REM dreams are more story-like, with emotion and aggression, and non-REM dreams often involve friendly social interactions. People with depression often experience more REM sleep than non-depressed people.\n\nHow does subjective time pass in a dream?\n\nIn Inception, dream time runs much slower than real time, and there is a scaling effect, such that if you dream within a dream, time passes even more slowly. So 5 minutes of real time equals 1 hour of dream time, a 5-minute dream inside a dream equals one week of second-level dream time, and so on.\n\nThis is perhaps the cleverest part of the movie, but though intuitively pleasing, there is little evidence for it. In fact there is some evidence that in lucid dreams, at least, the perception of time in similar to that when the dreamer is awake.\n\nA more pressing question for researchers is what happens when our brain’s time perception goes faulty. In fact, the illusion of time may be created by the brain itself, which is at least as much of a head-scratcher as the plot of Inception."
