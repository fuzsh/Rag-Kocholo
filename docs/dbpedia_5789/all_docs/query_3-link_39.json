        "text": "The transformation of British writer David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas novel into an outrageously ambitious wannabe blockbuster with a purported budget of at least $100m really is one of the marvels of 21st century film-making. While Hollywood bean counters wring their hands and promise more austerity each time a movie such as John Carter haemorrhages cash, elsewhere in the world (Germany in this case) funds have somehow been raised for a labyrinthine assembly of interconnected, fractured existential vignettes with a cast packed with Oscar-winners and a near three-hour running time.\n\nWhether the film, which comes to us courtesy of Matrix directors Lana and Andy Wachowski and German film-maker Tom Tykwer, can ape the financial and critical success of Christopher Nolan's brainache 2010 moneyspinner Inception remains to be seen. Early signs are extremely positive, however, after a dazzling near six-minute trailer drew gasps across the blogosphere. Flitting through time and space like a lucid-dreaming butterfly, Cloud Atlas settles momentarily on apparently connected characters inhabiting the 19th, 20th and early 21st centuries before spinning gracefully off into the near future and heaven-knows-where from there.\n\nIn the 1930s, a pianist (Ben Whishaw) writes to a friend about a half-finished journal he has been reading by a lawyer voyaging by sea to San Francisco in 1849. In the 1970s, journalist Halle Berry ruminates on man's inability to learn from his mistakes as she reads the musician's letter. Later on, she will appear apparently reincarnated as a tattooed Pacific island native. Meanwhile, Jim Broadbent has been hearing a melody played by Whishaw in a dream of the future that features Korean actor Doona Bae as a cloned dancing girl in a cafe. A shady Hugh Grant, a stern, whiskery Hugo Weaving and a bewildered-looking Tom Hanks also make appearances, the latter in multiple guises.\n\nMitchell himself gave his backing to the project in an interview with the Guardian last year, suggesting that Tykwer and the Wachowskis' decision to utilise a reincarnation motif only hinted at in his novel might be the film-makers' stroke of genius.\n\n\"They aren't attempting merely to film the book, which is why many adaptations come to grief – the novel's already there, so why spend all that effort on an audiobook with visuals?\" he said. \"Rather, the three directors have assembled Cloud Atlas and reassembled it in a form which – fingers crossed – will be a glorious, epic thing. The reincarnation motif in the book is just a hinted-at linking device, but the script gives it centre stage to link the six worlds with characters, causes and effects. A novel can't do multi-role acting: a film can. The directors are playing to the strengths of their medium, just like I try to.\""
