        "text": "(Photo by Lionsgate, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Warner Bros., A24/courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nThe 50 Best Sci-Fi Movies of the 2010s\n\nAfter fantasy franchises like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter convinced audiences to realize that, yes, being a geek is fun, people emerged in the early 2010s thinking: What next? Why, science-fiction, of course! The genre hit the decade hit with full force, starting with a number of inescapable series from yesteryear resurrected for modern times. We’re talking the return of Star Wars, Mad Max, Blade Runner, and even Planet of the Apes.\n\nOf course, it wasn’t all just nostalgia plays, but also thought-provoking original material, like Ex Machina, Arrival, Looper, Inception, and Interstellar. And though sci-fi is often set in the future, its stories actually help inform and decipher how we live today through technology and allegory. Look only to Her, Snowpiercer, or The Lobster for proof. And then you had grounded space-set science-fiction like Gravity and The Martian.
