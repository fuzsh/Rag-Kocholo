        "text": "JAK®;18546359 said:\n\nWhy are these two movies being compared? Is it because everyone here loves Christopher Nolan and absolutely despises Avatar? Is it your latest opportunity to take Avatar down a peg?\n\nWhy not compare movies that are actually similar.\n\nAre they not of the same genre..........case closed in regards to why they are been compared. Also it has something to do with masterpiece vs Masterpiece, most threads are destined to have flaming in them. I guess I was just hoping to have an intelligent discussion concerning these two movies you know because this section is about well jezz movies.\n\n......\n\nInception = sci fi / thriller / heist\n\nAvatar = fantasy / adventure\n\nNot the same genre at all. To even say so is ridiculous. They are absolutely nothing alike.\n\nEhhhhhhhhhhhhh Avatar is placed in the sci-fi genre to even say otherwise is ridiculous. Of course they both have secondary grading to them as well but they are overall Sci-fi.\n\nAre they not of the same genre..........case closed in regards to why they are been compared. Also it has something to do with masterpiece vs Masterpiece, most threads are destined to have flaming in them. I guess I was just hoping to have an intelligent discussion concerning these two movies you know because this section is about well jezz movies.\n\nOkay then.\n\nLet's make a thread comparing Inception and 2001: A Space Odyssey, see who wins then.\n\nEhhhhhhhhhhhhh Avatar is placed in the sci-fi genre to even say otherwise is ridiculous. Of course they both have secondary grading to them as well but they are overall Sci-fi.\n\nFair enough. Doesn't change the fact that it's completely irrelevant. They are two very different films. The whole point of comparing movies is that there is some common ground between the two - such as a shared theme. The fact that both movies are in the sci-fi genre is a loose thread at best. As cliche as this expression is, it's nonetheless true. It's like comparing apples to oranges.\n\nJAK®;18546429 said:\n\nWe all know why this thread was made, and it certainly wasn't for a fair comparison.\n\nDude dont bring your BS assumptions here looking to start trouble. I dont even frequent the Avatar thread so to say I am trying to start trouble is just a load of crap from you. Why does their have to be an ulterior motive behind a thread, I made it based on the buzz inception is receiving and because it reminded me of the buzz Avatar received.\n\nSo you're asking us to compare films based on their hyperbole?\n\nComprehension serves those who use it well wisely, I am asking you which movie you enjoyed more. I am not asking a complicated question, you went into the Cinema you saw one film and then a few months later you went into the cinema you saw another film. Which did you like better? Pretty simple question wouldnt you say?\n\nIt doesn't fail at all. They're in the same genre, which is the basis of your argument for this debate. The time frame doesn't matter.\n\nDude piss of, you clearly have no interest in the thread and are just being annoying now. And yes your post fails because I have stated under what premise I made this thread under and you still continue with your nonsense, I know you dont want to lose face being the respected E-intellectual and movie buff that you are but please go away or you will be reported.\n\nI'm not denying that it's a simple question. What I'm saying is that these are two very different films with two very different, passionate fanbases, and some of them aren't too discreet in their prejudices. This debate has been going on for weeks now and it hasn't yielded good results. All this topic has done is give it a separate thread.\n\nBut hey, I've been wrong before. If people come in here and find a way to discuss both films maturely, then all the more to you. I just don't see this ending well.\n\nIf I'm annoying you so much, go ahead and report me, or put me on Ignore. If the mods determine that I've broken this board's rules, I'd be more than happy to apologize. In any case I'll leave you to it."
