        "text": "Not every film that sounds great on paper ends up living up to expectations. I remember attending a screening of Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain a few years back in a state of almost rabid anticipation. A science-fiction movie stretched over several millennia, \"exploring the search for God and meaning\" (in the film-maker's own words) from the director of Requiem For a Dream? This, I had to see. Of course, the film turned out to be a misguided, painfully grandiose, epic botch of a movie, not to mention one of the most boring pieces of cinema since The Postman.\n\nI've therefore been quietly dampening down my own expectations for Christopher Nolan's Inception, ever since the Dark Knight director announced plans for his science-fiction/heist movie \"set within the architecture of the mind\". With apparently unquestioning support from Warner Bros and a stellar cast (Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Marion Cotillard, to name just a few) as well as regular Nolan collaborators such as composer Hans Zimmer and cinematographer Wally Pfister on board, it seemed almost too good to be true. I'm seeing the movie tomorrow, but according to early reviews, I needn't have worried myself: it's a surefire humdinger.\n\nSo far, almost all the critics to offer their opinions have not just praised the film, they have cast it as potentially one of the best movies of the year: a highly intelligent, genuinely original piece of cinema in the guise of a summer blockbuster. In the run-up to its release, there have been suggestions that Inception might be rather too confusing for the average filmgoer, yet there seems to be a sense that the supremely skilful implementation of Nolan's vision (along with excellent performances from the cast) will make this the kind of film that people go to see three or four times, rather than one which gets written off as an over-complex brainteaser.\n\n\"Inception is an exhilarating cinematic experience that suggests there is still room, even in the blockbuster world, for big ideas and dangerous emotions, and that may be the single most thrilling thing about it,\" writes Drew McWeeny of Hitfix.\n\n\"The film isn't really built as a narrative shell game with mind-blowing twists and turns so much as it is a logical and orderly descent into a trippy but airtight exploration of the way we frequently chase illusory versions of the people in our lives while ignoring the real flesh-and-blood imperfections that we don't want to acknowledge.\"\n\n\"A devilishly complicated, fiendishly enjoyable sci-fi voyage across a dreamscape that is thoroughly compelling,\" writes the Hollywood Reporter's Kirk Honeycutt. \"In a summer of remakes, reboots and sequels comes Inception, easily the most original movie idea in ages.\"\n\n\"No movie this year comes freighted with greater expectations than Inception,\" writes Indiewire's Anne Thompson. \"Happily, the movie delivers and then some – thanks to clever original screenwriting and exhilarating mise en scene – in 2D.\n\n\"When it opens 16 July, this eye-popping film will wow moviegoers all over the world – its complexities will only encourage debate and repeat viewings – and should also score well with critics and year-end awards groups. Oscar nominations in technical categories are a certainty, but Inception is also a strong contender for multiple nominations, including Best Picture.\"\n\n\"Inception is a stunning achievement and the most completely entertaining film I've seen in years,\" writes Cinematical's Todd Gilchrist. \"Nolan crafts an amazingly sophisticated, subversive, thoughtful, and even occasionally confusing (albeit in only good ways) tale about the layers of reality in the mind that calcify and crumble when constructed from the raw materials of memory and emotion. At the same time, he's made an utter crowd-pleaser, an epic piece of entertainment that ultimately feels so simple precisely because of all of its complexity, and one that rouses and inspires and excites in the same way as blockbusters comprised of pure spectacle.\""
