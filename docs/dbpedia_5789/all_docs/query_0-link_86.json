        "text": "Christopher Nolan: “I do view Inception as film noir.”\n\n*Links to images and videos appear in green.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, moviegoers in the United States experienced the classic period of film noir, French for ‘black film.’ Film noirs of the classic period had a very distinctive visual style and mood that directors and cinematographers often experimented with to push the boundaries of the style. The classic film noirs embraced a variety of genres, which leads to a problem with the definition of the term ‘film noir.’ Many film historians believe that film noir is a style of film rather than a genre. As a result, film noir in its classic period has crossed over into the neo-noir age that began in the 1960s and continues today. Neo-noir films borrow elements from the classic film noir and apply them to updated themes, style, content, and mediums that are now in existence, but that may have been absent during the classic film noir period. Neo-noir films also incorporate a variety of genres including science fiction, comedies, and psychological thrillers. Through its dark theme, complex plot, and intricately developed characters, Christopher Nolan’s highly successful 2010 psychological thriller Inception is the quintessential neo-noir film.\n\nInception- The Movie\n\nOften labeled a science fiction and action heist film, Inception includes just that; a great amount of action and the use of a futuristic science. In the film, the main protagonist, Dom Cobb, is an international fugitive and a skilled thief; he is wanted for murder in the United States. Everywhere he goes, Dom must skillfully avoid arrest. Cobb and his partner, Arthur, execute illegal corporate espionage by entering into the subconscious mind of whomever they are targeting in order to extract valuable information by use of a sleep machine that hooks Cobb and Arthur up to their target. They do so by using a multiple level ‘dream within a dream’ strategy. Dreamers such as Dom and Arthur can awaken from these dreams in two different ways; one is from a ‘kick’, which is a sudden shock, and the other is by dying within the dream. Each dreamer carries a totem, which is a small personalized object that behaves a certain way that only the owner knows about in order to help them determine whether they are in another person’s dream. For example, Cobb’s totem is a spinning top, which spins perpetually in the dream state. The movie begins with Cobb and Arthur on an assignment for a client, attempting to extract information from a Mr. Saito. They ultimately fail because their original dream architect, Nash, messes up the first dream level. Saito, however, reveals that he is the one who hired them for the job in order to audition them for another job. Because of their failed mission however, Cobb and Arthur decide they should lie low for a while since their former (and disgruntled) employer, a company called Cobol Engineering, will not be happy with the botched job. Saito has other plans for them however, and Cobb and Arthur are then hired by Saito to perform inception, rather than extraction. The target is Saito’s business rival, the old and sickly owner of a vast energy conglomerate, who is about to hand his company over to his son, Robert Fischer, Jr. Saito wants Cobb and Arthur to implant the idea that Fischer Jr. wants to break up his father’s empire once he gains control, to prevent the Fischer empire from achieving a monopoly. Cobb agrees to the proposal, even though he states that though inception is possible, it is incredibly difficult. He is determined to succeed because Saito promises to clear Cobb’s record and allow him to return home as a free man, and not a fugitive. Cobb and Arthur then set out to assemble their team for the complicated job. This time, Cobb chooses his team with added caution, because if even one thing goes awry, the dreamers involved may not wake. They find a dream architect, Ariadne, who constructs the dream worlds where the job will take place. Cobb also hires a forger and imitator named Eames, and a chemist, Yusuf, who will create powerful sedatives that will allow them to stay asleep long enough to go through the three dream levels necessary for the job. After they strategize, they decide that the best way to implant the idea deep in Fischer Jr.’s mind is by going through three dream levels, or a dream within a dream within a dream, so that the idea will be so deep in his subconscious that he will believe he came up with the idea on his own. After they discover how poor his relationship with his now dead father was, they decide that in the final and third level, he will confront his father and they will trick Jr. to believe that his father truly loved him all along. Their goal is to convince Fischer Jr. that breaking up his empire will make him a better man in his father’s eyes. As they go through the levels however, the team has to deal with projections from Cobb’s tormented and dangerous subconscious, which threatens to ruin the plan and leave the entire team comatose. Ultimately however, the team succeeds and all members wake up. The last scene of the movie is extremely troubling however; as Cobb makes his way to his children he spins his spinning top, his totem, on a table and the camera remains on the spinning top which does not appear to slow down, before cutting to a black screen.\n\nDefining “Film Noir”\n\nThough it’s clear that Inception falls under the genres of science fiction and action heist, it can easily be classified under the category of neo-noir in terms of its style. Many elements in neo-noir films are borrowed from the classic film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s. In terms of visual style, the “film noir is often associated with low-key lighting, unbalanced compositions, vertiginous angles, night-for-night exteriors, extreme deep focus, and wide-angle lenses” (Naremore 167). Many critics and viewers also understand film noir to be “a way of dressing actors, designing sets, and photographing urban life” (Naremore 168). In the 1940s and 1950s, almost all films were in black and white despite the fact that color film technology was fairly advanced by the early 1940s. Black and white was “regarded as a stylized medium- a sign not merely of realism but also of abstraction, bohemia, aestheticism, and avant-garde taste” (Naremore 170). Because of limits in color spectrum with black and white films, the foreground and the backgrounds would blend into each other; filmmakers at the time came up with a solution by lighting the two differently to create contrast (Naremore 175). Also, moviegoers at the time also believed Technicolor to be “inappropriate for the grim realities” that were shown in the film noirs (Naremore 170). During the classic film noir period, “darkness was central to modernist art of every kind” (Naremore 170-1). It is important to note that the “available film stocks and camera technology had a strong influence on style” and that though there were a broad set of rules for how to create mysterious and gothic imagery in film noirs, there were no concrete rules governing noir imagery (Naremore 168).\n\nWith many intellectuals immigrating to the US in the early 20th century, Freudian psychology began to spread and eventually became a major part of the noir landscape, showcased by the terror and horror within the films (Dickos 61). The impact of the war fueled the fire as feelings of desolation and dislocation ravaged the nation and were continually nourished by these new philosophical investigations. Social and cultural upheaval caused by the war “contoured the human psyche in ways that showed an America quite ambivalent in the pursuit of its dream” (Dickos 62).\n\nOne of the most common and recognizable elements of a classic film noir is the noir city. This mythical city often looks as though it’s in the post-depression 1940s and 1950s and for the main characters it often signifies “a quest to locate the self lost in a world of clutter, distraction, and noise” (Dickos 63). The city is also an ideal place where human weakness and vice run rampant. A certain formula is also followed for the protagonists of film noirs. The protagonist is usually a broken man who is not totally good, but not totally evil either; he may be attempting to flee torments imposed on him externally, or he may be trying to escape the paranoia that consumes his mind and often it seems as though he is running away from anything and everything because of guilt. Psychologically, the man struggles with his human identity and performs violent and dangerous actions because in his film noir world he has to in order to survive; the fear he feels that causes him to act this way is shaped by the world in which he exists. With a character like this who engages in reckless behavior, the mystery in a film noir “comes not from the crime committed or action taken but from the corrupt or unknown motives behind it” (Dickos 70). He is, in a sense, the anti-hero. Film noirs also often include scenes in bars, nightclubs, and lounges as seductive venues where the “unknown and unmapped” can occur (Dickos 175). Flashback devices were also very common in film noirs and worked well as a narrative device and provided viewers with omniscience by allowing “privileged access to the perspective of each troubled character,” in addition to voiceover narration that was equally popular (Dickos 179). A femme fatale was also present in the majority of the film noirs and in an interesting twist, she was often fatal to even herself (Borde 62). There were also frequent images of water and distorted mirrors. Films noirs with an oneiric nature, meaning that they use a dream metaphor, often have an “aura of confusion” which “is central to the representation of dream states” (Borde 64). However, film noirs with oneiric natures are not the only ones that cause confusion; film noir in general strives to establish a feeling of confusion and unease in the viewer as he watches all his “normal points of psychological orientation” disappear (Borde 65). The most common themes in film noir include the non-heroic hero, alienation and loneliness, existential choice, man under sentence of death, meaninglessness, purposelessness, the absurd, violence and paranoia, and ritual and order.\n\nDefining “Neo-Noir”\n\nAfter the 1950s, a new style of films had grown out of film noir called neo-noir which borrowed many elements from film noir and combined those elements with more modern technology, themes, and plots. Film noir had an influence on many genres; neo-noir movies often straddled the line between two genres resulting in hybrid titles such as noir melodramas, noir science fiction, noir westerns, techno-noir and so on. Unlike film noir, neo-noir films were in color and utilized “the latest projection technology,” including making movies wide screen (Schwartz xi). The rating system after the 1950s was also much less restrictive, which allowed for much more violence, nudity, and other such harsh themes to make it to the screen. Remakes of “the old ‘hard-boiled’ school of detective fiction” from the film noir days also became popular and common in neo-noir (Schwartz xi). The film noir detective was also updated to the neo-noir cop and the idea of a serial killer was also introduced. Film noirs mainly dealt with “con-artists, petty gangsters, and psychopaths” while neo-noir films upgraded them to “grifters, techno-noir gangsters, and sci-fi psychopaths” (Schwartz xi). Neo-noirs tend to “reflect changes in American social mores” as they showed the darker side of American life and dreams (Schwartz xi). This style has been shaped by directors, producers, writers, and actors who “have insistently sought to encode and reinvent the darkest moods and motives of the American character” and incorporate it into “crime, suspense, and thriller movies” (Shwartz xi). A neo-noir film mainly contains “doomed characters and presents melodramatic, psychological, detective, and western themes” (Schwartz xi). The femme fatale has also remained an important element in neo-noir and acts as “seducer and betrayer of the hapless hero” just as she did in film noir, however, she also often appears as more of a victim than villain (Keesey 10).\n\nThe characters in neo-noir films often dealt with psychological problems and popular character types from film noir disappeared. Psychologically, neo-noir films include the key “element of inescapability;” the protagonist is trapped in “the illusions of his own mind” which he can never escape (Conrad 19). Some characters in neo-noir films also tend to be controlled by their own passion, which ultimately signifies the loss of their self-control (Conrad 87). While film noirs had clear boundaries marking the three main character types of the investigator, the victim, and the villain, “neo-noir really tends to erode these distinctions” (Keesey 12). In neo-noir films, there is a very thin line between the non-hero and the criminal that is often very easily blurred.\n\nThere are many additional elements that are a central part of most neo-noirs such as the flashback device, music, CGI, lighting, and the modern city. Flashback images are also common in neo-noir and are often broken in by use of crosscuts. Music too is important as it helps to further dramatise “the psychological complexity and moral ambiguity of the neo-noir protagonist” (Keesey 17). Technologically, CGI and advanced digital and editing effects “have presented a neo-noir world that seems ever more threatening and unreliable, constantly morphing under the control of shadowy others- or because of the hero’s own unstable mind” (Keesey 17). Neo-noir films also make use of chiaroscuro, or low-key, lighting. The modern city continues to be an important element of neo-noir with its postmodern architecture where all the buildings have similar forms.\n\nInception as Film Noir/Neo-Noir\n\nInception has the characteristics of film noir and neo-noir, and can thus be classified as a noir styled movie. The film opens with a scene that makes use of chiaroscuro lighting in order give it an air of mystery and leave the viewer confused. Though the entire film is not filmed in low-key lighting, there is no bright sunlight in the film except for a scene that is replayed throughout the film as flashbacks and as part of Dom’s dreams; the scene is that of Dom’s two children playing in a backyard with their backs to the viewer and are lit in very bright sunlight. When this scene is first shown in the film, it is not yet clear that those are his children, especially because their faces are not visible. Also, when Saito is proposing the job to Dom and Arthur, there is a shot of the helicopter they are in making its way over a city that looks as though it is in a dreamlike state; it is slightly foggy and blurry and the weather appears gloomy. Another element that leaves the viewer confused is that “the heist explanation becomes nearly continuous,” so the viewer does not really know what is going to happen until it happens or until one of the characters mention what happens next (Bordwell). In a sense, the viewer is drawn in and becomes part of the action.\n\nTerror is also a constant factor of the film; if a person is shot while in the second level dream, he will simply be sent back to the first level. However, with the difficult mission of planting the idea in Fischer Jr.’s mind, the main characters must go through a third level dream in order to get deep enough within Fischer Jr.’s subconscious, and if any of them die in that level, they will remain in limbo forever, which resembles a coma in the real world. Thus, all the characters are constantly plagued by terror, since they are aware that any misstep could send them into limbo. Dom must deal with additional terror, as it is always a possibility that he will be unable to control his subconscious and Mal will enter the dream and botch the mission and put everyone in danger just as she had with the job shown at the beginning of the film. Saito eventually is shot in the third level, and despite efforts to keep him alive, he dies and passes into limbo, as does Fischer Jr. who is ultimately shot by Mal. Dom and Ariadne face extreme terror as they realize they must enter a fourth level- which will be limbo- in order to rescue Fischer and Saito, even though they know the sedative they took in the real world will run out very soon, potentially leaving them all stuck in limbo if they do not get out in time.\n\nThe film also plays on the theme of the character being trapped in his own mind both literally and figuratively. Literally, most of the film takes place within Fischer Jr.’s mind, in his subconscious, as the team goes through the dream levels. Figuratively, Dom is stuck in own mind because he cannot get over his grief over his wife’s death and his memories of Mal are almost always brought into his dreams. The end of the movie alludes to the possibility that Dom is permanently trapped in his dreams.\n\nInception is characterized by the constant blurring of reality as Dom struggles to separate reality from his dreams where Mal constantly terrorizes him. Viewers too experience a blurring of reality as they seek to separate fact from fantasy and decide whether Dom is ultimately successful in overcoming his internal struggle caused by Mal. The city, which in its own way also characterizes a blurring of reality, is crucial to the film as it is Ariadne’s job as architect to build cities and puzzles so that the subconscious of their target does not realize that they are intruders in the dream and that something is not quite right. In an important scene in the film, Dom teaches Ariadne how to transform the city and Ariadne takes things a step further when she defies physics and bends the city to create a horseshoe shape so that cars and people on the top leg of the horseshoe are moving upside down as though gravity does not exist. Just as cities have boundaries, the dream worlds she creates have boundaries as well.\n\nThe flashback device is a key element of Inception as it helps to weave the story and plot together. It is because of the “film’s dependence on nearly continuous exposition” that the audience connects with Dom’s character (Bordwell). Dom constantly experiences flashbacks of the last time he saw his children and later with the last time he saw Mal alive. At one point in the film, before the major mission, Ariadne enters Dom’s dream and discovers an elevator where each floor it stops on is a flashback of Dom’s; she follows Dom within the dream and Mal approaches her and just as Mal is about to become violent, Dom arrives on the floor and Ariadne awkwardly watches him relive his flashback of the last time he saw Mal alive, where she subsequently commits suicide.\n\nThere are psychological undertones to the movie, as Dom’s psyche is quite obviously in a state of disarray, since he cannot seem to get over the past and continues to relive his mistakes and regrets. This is especially visible during the mission where “the psychoanalytic concept of repression is a consistent theme, as the buried experiences and traumas of Cobb continue to resurface in the dream-worlds until they are properly resolved” (Paul). This concept is demonstrated well in the first level where “a locomotive from one of Cobb’s traumatic memories spontaneously appears and goes barrelling (sic) down the streets” of Ariadne’s dream and “destroying cars and killing drivers along the way and derailing the protagonists from their objective” (Paul). Because he cannot move on, Dom considers forgetting about reality and joining Mal, who committed suicide because she believed that the real world was just another dream level and wanted to wake up. It was Dom who first implanted the idea that, within limbo, the dream world was not real in order to get her to return to reality with him but as a result of the inception, the idea manifests to the point that she believes that reality is a dream world as well. This is how Dom knows that inception is indeed possible.\n\nThe idea of implanting ideas and manipulating someone’s mind resonates within the viewer who, despite knowing that such things cannot be done, experiences a moment of terror at the possibility that this could be possible in the future. It also brings up a question of whether or not doing something like this would be moral; towards the end of the mission, Fischer Jr. improves his relationship with his father, however this was what the team planned for in order for him to think of breaking up his father’s business. No one thinks about the emotional impact this will have on Fischer Jr. in the real world. Such moral ambiguity is present all throughout the film.\n\nIn the film, Dom clearly personifies the non-heroic hero; he is a man who just wants to return to his family and clearly did not murder Mal. However, he is also a criminal who engages in illegal corporate espionage and risks the lives of his team members. He is essentially a very selfish character as he takes on the job, despite knowing how dangerous it will be, just to be able to see his children again. The only real heroic action Dom executes in the film is risking his life to go into limbo willingly in order to rescue Saito even when Dom knows he may get stuck there as well. This moral ambiguity is present in more than just Dom. Saito asks Dom to implant the idea in Fischer’s head, and they come up with the plan of making him believe that his father loved him all along; however, the result of him splitting up his father’s empire is not for the greater good, rather it is to help line Saito’s pockets and make his company the biggest. Also, Ariadne, who is a young university student, engages in this illegal activity only because of the thrill and freedom she gets from building the dreams.\n\nThere is also a very clear femme fatale in the film: Mal. Not only is she Dom’s weakness, but she is also a constant threat to every mission that Dom partakes in, and thus she endangers anyone he ever works with. Ariadne realizes this and confronts Dom about it because she is worried about the team and the threat Mal poses to them all. Mal indeed almost causes Dom’s downfall at the end of the film in his final confrontation with her while in limbo, when she offers for him to join her where she is now by letting her stab him. Thus, in this film, she is more the villainous female character from film noir than a victim from neo-noir.\n\nLastly, music and CGI also act as noir elements in the film. Music is an important element of the film not only because of the dramatic pieces composed by Zach Hemsey and Hanz Zimmer, but also because of the repeated use of Edith Piaf’s ‘Non Je Ne Regrette Rien,’ which is used to warn the team members that the kick is coming at the beginning of the film. Hanz Zimmer’s score for the movie is made from pieces of Piaf’s song that he manipulated and made more dramatic. CGI is a crucial element to the entire film, with special effects making the film profoundly more dramatic. In one of the final scenes, Yusuf drives a van, which houses the sleeping team members in the first level off a bridge, which is supposed to be the final kick that brings everyone back to reality. This scene is done in extremely slow motion and there is constant cross cutting to the other dream levels and the characters scrambling to make it back to the first dream level in time. Also, Dom and Mal’s dream world, which is a modern city devoid of anyone except the two, is entirely made up of CGI and the whole mood of the scenes there is very gloomy and depressing.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe constant alternation “between the planned and logical creation of the worlds and the spontaneous, unwieldy and frightening manifestations of the unconscious is done so successfully and seamlessly” throughout the film “that when we arrive in the final scene when Cobb is supposedly back in the ‘real’ world and outside of the dream-worlds, we are still left questioning the actuality of his experiences” (Paul). The end of the movie leaves the viewers in a total state of confusion; before long you start to wonder if the entire movie is not just one big dream. One thing is for sure, however, Inception definitely falls under the category of a noir film."
