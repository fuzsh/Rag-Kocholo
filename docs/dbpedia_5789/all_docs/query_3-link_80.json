        "text": "‘The proliferation of different media and mediations – simulations – which have permeated many aspects of contemporary society, have dissolved the dichotomy between the real and the simulacrum, between the authentic and the inauthentic’ (Landsberg, 1995: 240).\n\nAs receptive as the human subconscious is, it is easy for scenarios, events, even entire worlds and stories to be perceived as a first-hand experience, and thus part of our reality, through our engagement with material as abundant and attainable as photographs, or as technologically advanced as virtual reality gaming, for instance. In the 21st century this has believed to have amounted to a notion of subconscious displacement in regards to time and space.\n\nIn Inception a team of thieves armed with technology that enables them to enter their subjects’ dreams and extract information are tasked with achieving the opposite, to instead plant an idea in someone that would influence the fall of a business empire.\n\nCobb insists that ‘building a dream from your memory is the easiest way to lose your grasp on what’s real and what is a dream’ (Inception, 2010) but he can’t help but disobey his own set of rules, as we see when his apprentice architect, Ariadne, accesses his private dream world and discovers it to be entirely comprised of real locations and moments from Cobb’s romantic memories of his wife. He is urged by Michael Caine’s character to ‘come back to reality’ (Inception, 2010) and as the film progresses it becomes ever clear that Cobb is having difficulty disconnecting from this simulation, having populated it so densely with replicas of what was authentic in the real world.\n\nNolan cleverly structures the film’s narrative in such a complex way that the audience themselves begin to question whether they are being presented with a reality or a simulacrum within the film. The final scene of shows Cobb using his totem, a spinning top, which equates to ‘a solution for keeping track of reality’ (Inception, 2010). However, whether it continues to spin or it falls, indicating if the world Cobb inhabits is a dream (a simulacrum) or reality, is never shown, instead cutting to black ambiguously, leaving the audience unsure of what side of the dichotomy they experienced.\n\nIn both Inception and Blade Runner characters divulge in simulated experiences in which they ‘can no longer distinguish between the real … [and] the hyperreal’ (Landsberg, 1995: 240) as a means of circumventing some form of personal crisis, in line with a ‘loss of faith [in] progress’ (Hill, 2000: 100). As Cobb mourns the death of his wife by engineering dreamscapes where he can be with her, devoid of bereavement, so do the replicants avoid acknowledgement of their personal losses – in fact, the loss of their selves – by holding onto photographs imbued with manufactured memories of their past, embedding ‘prosthetic memory’ (Landsberg, 1995: 240). These photographic ‘mediations’ serve to legitimise, albeit as an allusion conceived by the Tyrell Corp manufacturers, the authenticity of the replicants’ life experiences and thus facilitates their self-recognition as human, rather than simulations of it.\n\nVery similarly to Inception, Blade Runner’s ending is abruptly ambiguous and the audience is left unsure as to whether they have been presented with a reality or a simulacrum, this time in the form of Deckard, as either a human or replicant, rather than the entire world presented in Inception.\n\nBibliography\n\nBlade Runner.
