        "text": "This post is part of Science of Sci-Fi(opens in a new tab), Mashable's ongoing series dissecting the science (or lack of science) in our favorite sci-fi movies, TV shows, and books.\n\nSpace is big, as Douglas Adams famously wrote(opens in a new tab) in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. Like, really big. Alpha Centauri – the nearest star system to our own – is more than 4 light years away. Even within our solar system, massive distances make travel timely and difficult to plan.\n\nWith current technology, it would take us a century to reach Alpha Centauri.(opens in a new tab) We don’t have a spaceship that can go faster than the speed of light; the fastest speed we can reach using nuclear power is 4.5 percent of lightspeed. Let’s just say you’re going to need a lot of podcasts for the trip.\n\nWe haven’t cracked the faster-than-light (FTL) ceiling yet. But science fiction writers have.\n\nThe genre is full of examples of starships that can zip across the cosmos at speeds that are highly convenient. Some writers have drawn on real science and principles to explain their physics-bending technology. Others just kind of made it up as they went along.\n\nHere are some of the most popular kinds of fictional FTL travel, and how they rate in reality.\n\nAlso known as wormholes, Einstein-Rosen bridges are perhaps the most commonly known means of interstellar travel — and the most likely to actually exist. Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity predicted wormholes, although we haven’t seen one yet.\n\nAn Einstein-Rosen bridge, to put it as simply as possible, is a shortcut through space caused by the warping of spacetime. Massive objects like stars or black holes bend time and space like a bowling ball on a trampoline. A massive enough object could bend spacetime to create a connection between two otherwise distinct points.\n\nOr, as one character says to another in Interstellar, picture a piece of paper folded on itself, then pierced with a pencil. If you want to travel across the surface of the paper to get point to point, it’ll take a while. But if you can use the pencil as a bridge, it’s a significantly shorter trip.\n\nThe entrance to a wormhole has often been represented as a tube, which makes sense given the name. But it’s also inaccurate. Interstellar, in one of its most intense scenes, got it right. From our perspective in 3-D space, a wormhole should look like a sphere.\n\nWormholes are an attractive approach to FTL technology because they don’t require you to break the speed of light. Physics tells us nothing can go faster than light. But with wormholes — shortcuts, basically — spacecraft could enter and exit at sub-light speeds.\n\nThat makes them a perfect fit for any fictional plot, allowing a quick way to get from Point A to Point B. In Douglas Adams’ satirical Hitchhiker’s Guide, the Earth was demolished by the Vogons to make way for a hyperspace bypass — a wormhole by any other name — which would supposedly speed up galactic travel.\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe is littered with wormholes. The Bifrost that allows Thor to travel from Asgard to Earth is explicitly described as an Einstein-Rosen bridge by Dr. Jane Foster in Thor. Invading aliens open a wormhole-like portal over New York city in The Avengers. Similar doorways are shown as part of a galactic superhighway system in Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2, while the Revengers escape from Sakaar through “The Devil’s Anus” in Thor: Ragnarok, described by Bruce Banner as “a neutron star colliding with an Einstein-Rosen Bridge” (read: plot device).\n\nWormhole theory also allows for the possibility of traveling between universes. Einstein-Rosen bridges are key to Rick and Morty’s various misadventures; the mad scientist’s portal gun can open doorways to other galaxies and parallel realities.\n\nSome spoilsport scientists claim a wormhole caused by some sort of supermassive black hole would likely be too unstable to go through. A 1962 paper by John Archibald Wheeler and Robert W. Fuller argued such a bridge would collapse too quickly. On the other hand, physicists like Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne have theorized wormholes could be theoretically stabilized with the right amount of energy. But that’s a big “if.”\n\nRealism rating: 4/5. Fairly high, considering how many of Einstein's predictions have been proven right. Wormholes are probably out there ... we just have to find them.\n\nWarp technology is synonymous with the Star Trek series. Even if you’re not a fan of the various Starfleet adventures that have hit our screens over the last 50 years, you’re probably familiar with terms like “warp factor five.”\n\nBut what does it really mean?\n\nLike an Einstein-Rosen bridge, warp technology skirts around the impossibility of accelerating a ship past the speed of light. Instead, a warp drive bends space itself. It compresses space in front of the craft and expands it behind. The Enterprise is basically riding a bubble of regular 3-D space while the universe changes around it.\n\nStar Trek’s different warp speeds aren’t just technobabble(opens in a new tab). According to the writer’s guide for The Original Series, warp factor one is equal to breaking the light barrier; warp two is equal to 8x the speed of light; warp three is 27x light speed. Warp six is common cruising speed for the USS Enterprise NCC-1701. Any speed above seven risks damage to the engines or the ship itself.\n\nWithout warp technology, as we saw in the movie Star Trek: First Contact, humans never would have met spacefaring races like the Vulcans or founded the United Federation of Planets. The invention of the warp drive in the late 21st century is presented as a turning point for human civilization akin to the agricultural revolution or the printing press.\n\nAnd, outlandish as it sounds, warp technology may be possible in reality.\n\nIn 1994, theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre proposed a means of FTL space travel consistent with general relativity. Inspired by Star Trek, Alcubierre described an engine creating an energy field with lower density than the vacuum of space. By contracting space ahead of the ship and expanding it behind, a spacecraft could “ride a wave” forward.\n\nUnfortunately, Alcubierre's proposal raises the same theoretical problems as wormhole travel. Just as wormholes would require massive amounts of energy — and some as-yet unknown material to sustain it — so would warp drives. Star Trek provided that energy with a made-up element called dilithium: in crystal form, it is supposedly able to contain enormous, explosive reactions of matter and antimatter.\n\nIf we want our own warp drive, we’re going to need a similar exotic energy process, unknown to current science.\n\nRealism Rating: 3/5. Fun to think about, but we'd need materials that may not even exist in this universe. Say, can you spare some dilithium crystals?\n\nProblem: This universe doesn’t seem to allow faster-than-light travel. Solution: Well, just don’t travel through our universe. Duh.\n\nHyperspace is best understood as a sub-region of our real space where the same physical laws don’t apply. How does science fiction suggest we get there? It’s hard to say: Hyperspace has no theoretical basis like Einstein-Rosen bridges or warp drives.\n\nIn the Star Wars films, all kinds of ships are equipped with hyperspace drives, from small personal fighters like Poe Dameron’s X-wing, to larger freighters like the Millennium Falcon. Even that massive moon-sized space station, the Death Star, has a hyperdrive. How? We don’t know. George Lucas was determined to make space fantasy rather than science fiction.\n\nIn this case, “hyperspace” may merely be another name for lightspeed travel. In the original Star Wars, Han Solo brags his ship “can make point 5 past light speed.” In Star Wars novels — both the ones that are no longer canon(opens in a new tab) and those that are — we are told that ships are arranged by “class,” which corresponds to their speed. The lower the class, the faster the ship; the Falcon became a speedy Class 0.5 vessel.\n\nEven in Star Wars, ships traveling at hyperspeed must contend with some of the laws of physics. Hyperspace travel requires an astromech droid or a “navicomputer” to plot an unobstructed course and avoid collisions with stars or planets or other ships. As we know from The Last Jedi, lightspeed collisions can be catastrophic.\n\nHyperspace and warp drives describe a means of traveling way over the speed of light, but both still take a quantifiable amount of time. Han Solo, Luke and Obi-Wan had time to hang out and chat about the Force before they arrived at Alderaan.\n\nBut what if you could get there in no time at all, avoiding what Douglas Adams called “all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace?”\n\nThe Jump Drives in Battlestar Galactica made interstellar teleportation possible with virtually no delay. Both human ships and their Cylon counterparts used FTL drives. We were told the human ships are powered by refined tylium — an incredibly rare ore 10 million times more energetic than gasoline. We were also told that when a ship jumps, it warps the space around it and can damage other nearby vessels.\n\nAs with hyperspace, jump drives apparently require complex calculations before and during a jump to avoid the risk of a ship materializing too close to a planet’s atmosphere — or within the planet itself.\n\nInstantaneous teleportation is a convenient trope in sci-fi tales; it’s even used in Star Trek to “beam” individuals between ships and planets below. But does it have roots in any real scientific theory?\n\nShort answer: maybe.\n\nQuantum entanglement is a phenomenon where groups of particles behave similarly, even when separated by great gulfs of space. Einstein dubbed this “spooky action at a distance.” Author Ursula K. LeGuin(opens in a new tab) used this idea to invent a fictional device called the “ansible” that could communicate instantly with other ansibles, no matter where they were in the universe.\n\nIn theory you could “teleport” a ship or a person using the same kind of technology, though it gets even more complicated. You’d have to “transcribe” quantum information from particles at one end and transfer them to particles at the other end. This would get you out of the problem brought up by other kinds of fictional teleportation, namely that you’d either have to kill the original version or create a clone of yourself every time you teleported.\n\nFor now, quantum entanglement(opens in a new tab) is a thing we can observe — on an extremely small scale. We’re a long way from teleporting people or jumping ships.\n\nRealism Rating: 2/5. Instantaneous teleportation, anywhere in the galaxy? Probably not going to be a reality any time soon.\n\nThe last form of FTL travel that we'll dig into seems the least scientific. For 55 years, Doctor Who has chronicled the adventures across time and space of the Doctor and his/her human companions. Their means of transportation? A big blue box known as the TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimension in Space) that can take them anywhere, and anywhen, they want to go.\n\nBuilt (or, rather, grown) by an ancient species known as Time Lords, TARDISes are more magical than the tech of Star Trek. As the Doctor has himself explained, his means of transport can get a little “wibbly wobbly, timey wimey.” There does seem to be some sort of delay on the way — it’s more hyperdrive than jump drive. But essentially the TARDIS disappears here, flies through the Time Vortex, and reappears there. That’s all you really need to know.\n\nOr is it? It turns out even the TARDIS has more of a theoretical basis than the hyperdrive.\n\nIn 2013, physicists Benjamin K. Tippett and David Tsang published a paper proposing a theoretical means of creating an actual retrograde-capable time machine: a way to travel to your own past. The title of the paper: Traversable Achnronal Retrograde Domains in Spacetime (check the acronym, nerd).\n\nTippett and Tsang describe a bubble of spacetime containing a time-traveler entering a Closed Timelike Curve (essentially the same as an Einstein-Rosen bridge). Within that curve, the traveler can go anywhere on his or her own timeline, while within the bubble time seems to pass normally.\n\nThe two physicists even theorized that timelike curves could be split and connected, opening up the possibility of traveling not just along your own timeline — but anywhere in time and space.\n\nAll of which could make the TARDIS the winner of the theoretical faster-than-light travel stakes. With apologies to Han Solo, going point five past light speed may seem impressive, but there’s nothing faster than arriving before you set off in the first place.\n\nRealism Rating: 1/5, and that's being generous. For now the TARDIS is just wibbly wobbly, timey wimey, spacey wacey."
