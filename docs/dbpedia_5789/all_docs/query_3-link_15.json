        "text": "Inception is Christopher Nolan’s peak. It remains his peak seven years on. The film follows Leonardo DiCaprio’s Dominic Cobb, who leads a team of sleuths who break into people’s dreams and steal shit. But in this case, they have to break into somebody’s dream and plant an idea.\n\nIt’s an interesting film. I mean, I don’t really need to talk about it, ’cause we all know about it, but what I want to appreciate in this, if I can have a moment of your time, is that navigating people’s dreams is a recipe for chaos.\n\nWhatever you want to call it when you’re dealing with peoples dreams = chaos filmmaking.\n\nHowever, this is a Mission Impossible film hidden inside a dreamscape. You merge the two together, and you have Inception. And that’s what I really like about it, because it says to the audience, “Hey, we’re going to be dealing with dreams. So, you can imagine it’s going to get pretty fucking wacky, but we’ve got a team on a mission going inside those dreams. Stick with the team, to the mission’s end and ignore the more outlandish dream stuff and you’ll have a satisfying viewing experience.”\n\nThe backbone of the team interaction — the nebuchadnezzar (to borrow Matrix terminology) is that mysterious suitcase.\n\nYou know what I’m talking about? In every dream scenario where the team gets together to infiltrate somebody’s mind, they do so with this piece of machinery, a silver suitcase with an orange button at its core.\n\nAnd no one ever fucking refers to this thing, explains it away, or even nods to it, points to it, notices it, acknowledges it… And I’ll tell you why.\n\nIn every dream scenario, and there are a lot of them in this film (you’ve seen the memes - we’re dealing with dreams within dreams) especially when we’re talking the final two-thirds of the film, this piece of machinery binds the team together.\n\nEverybody hooks up intravenously… And inside the dreams themselves, the machine exists… again.\n\nNow, rather flippantly, Joseph Gordon Levitt refers to it as a byproduct of the military inventing ‘dream technology’.\n\nBUT!\n\nHaving the suitcase available in ‘reality’ prior to the team entering a dream I can understand…..\n\nBUT!\n\nYou’d think that there would be no hardware inside a dream that would link them all together once you’re inside the dream, right?\n\nThe hardware exists in reality.\n\nIn the dream, there is no hardware. The case should not be able to function!\n\nTherefore another suitcase, inside a dream — is an imagination concoction that somebody’s projecting.\n\nThis machine holds their conscious collectively and sends them in as a collective. Bringing people into their head like it’s a network. Like it’s the internet.\n\nThis is why Christopher Nolan is smart. Any other storyteller would DEFINITELY feel the need to explain just how and why this machine exists.\n\nInstead — Nolan has said; “Look, I don’t give a fuck how the science works. Just understand that the science is there, and it does work. Now forget about it. There’s a suitcase there, we push the button, we go in. Concentrate on the mission. Okay?”\n\nIt’s like air travel. Do you know how to fly a plane? No.\n\nHave you been a passenger on a plane before? Sure.\n\nYou don’t need to understand the science to know that the science exists and that the only thing that matters is the destination, the end journey. That’s the principles that Inception takes with it. So the suitcase itself serves the purpose of bringing the team into someone’s head, and our (audience’s) imagination pieces together the ‘ins and outs’ of the pseudoscience.\n\n“Oh, yes. This is a functioning unit, and they all just hook up to it, and it all works magically well and I don’t need it to be explained. I just need to see that it is working, and therefore I believe that the science is functioning, and I will suspend my disbelief accordingly.”\n\n— You, subconsciously.\n\nIt’s genius writing, it’s genius filmmaking, and that’s Christoper Nolan to a T. Inception is his peak, and I know that this guy will match this peak within the next coming years.\n\nSo, what’s the takeaway for independent filmmakers?\n\nShow shit and don’t explain it. See what happens.\n\nThrow it out there.\n\nLook, I believe that if people are coming to you saying, “I really liked your movie, but I didn’t understand what this thing was all about.”\n\nWell, at least they watched it — So, what do you care?\n\nIf you want to discover more about the mystery of this briefcase — check out my analysis video:"
