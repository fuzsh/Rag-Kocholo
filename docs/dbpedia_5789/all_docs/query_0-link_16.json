        "text": "By: Jason L. Rodrigo & Taya Pauline E. Sierra\n\nThe film Inception is a movie directed by the widely-acclaimed director Christopher Nolan in 2010. With its lead star Leonardo DiCaprio, alongside other known Hollywood actors such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, Ellen Page, Marion Cotillard, and Cillian Murphy; the film became both a commercial and critical success. On the commercial side, the film grossed over $800 million worldwide. It also won four Academy Awards in the categories of Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects. While the film has been praised for its particularly excellent cinematography and visual effects, much of the praise has been given to the story itself specifically for Nolan’s masterful exploration of the dreams and the subconscious mind.\n\nWhile there is a consensus on the film belonging to the science fiction genre, it also draws some themes from other genres of films such as heist, thriller, and even film noir. It revolves around Dominic “Dom” Cobb portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio, a professional thief or an “extractor” who uses an experimental dream-sharing technology to commit corporate espionage by breaking into their target’s subconscious to extract information. Together with his friend Arthur played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, they try to extract information from a Japanese businessman Saito (Ken Watanabe) only to be thwarted by the businessman’s ploy to recruit them into planting an idea in someone’s mind – Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) – heir to the owner of an energy conglomerate. The process, called inception, was deemed almost impossible but Cobb, allured with the chance to get back with his children by having him cleared of a murder charge agrees to do the job.\n\nIn a typical heist fashion, Cobb proceeds to assemble a team consisting of an architect – one who designs the dreams, a forger who is tasked with forging identities of other people, and a chemist who is responsible for concocting sedatives for the dream-sharing. Cobb first recruits Ariadne portrayed by Ellen Page, an architecture student in Paris to construct dream landscapes and labyrinths. He then proceeds to go to Mombasa to recruit Eames (Tom Hardy) as an identity forger and Yusuf (Dileep Rao) as a chemist tasked to administer a powerful sedative to allow for a stable “dream within a dream.” Saito also opts to join the team in order to make sure that the job will be accomplished. In a stolen dream-sharing moment with Cobb, Ariadne realizes the dangers that Dom’s subconscious projection of his late wife Mal played by Marion Cotillard.\n\nThe goal of their mission was to get Robert Fischer to dismantle his father’s company and they soon find an opportunity to do so when his father dies in Sydney and Robert embarks on a ten-hour flight to Los Angeles for the funeral. In order to wake up safely, they had to simultaneously set up a “kick” similar to the sensation of falling across three levels of dreams, with each level having a slower passage of time than the previous one.\n\nThe first dream level was a rainy Los Angeles by Yusuf where the team abducts Fischer only to realize that he’s been trained against extractions by projecting armed men to protect him. At the same time, a train from Cobb’s subconscious bursts into the scene jeopardizing their mission. Saito gets shot but the team soon learns that they can’t safely wake up because of the sedative so the team gets ready to dive into another level of the dream by fooling Fischer into thinking that his godfather, impersonated by Eames has an ulterior motive to take over his father’s business.\n\nThe second level was a hotel dreamt by Arthur during which Cobb convinces Fischer that his godfather was behind his abduction and that Cobb was there to protect him. He then tricks Fischer to enter his own subconscious by having him think that it was his godfather’s mind that they were entering. Arthur stays in the dream level to administer the kick.\n\nThe third level is a heavily defended hospital which Eames dreamt and is also where the deathbed of Fischer’s father was located. When Yusuf sets up the kick prematurely, an avalanche happens as the team tries to get Fischer inside his father’s chamber. Mal sabotages the mission by shooting him and as the team was ready to give up, Ariadne proposes to go down another level with Cobb, into the Limbo, an “unconstructed dream space.” There Cobb confronts Mal and Ariadne learns that Mal’s death was a result of an inception that Cobb did on her. He planted an idea that Mal’s world wasn’t real after she had forgotten that they were living in a dream for 50 years. When Mal woke up, she was still convinced that they were still dreaming and committed suicide to wake herself up, framing Cobb so that he would do the same.\n\nAriadne finally kills Mal’s projection and wakes Fischer up by having him fall off the building. He then proceeds to his father’s room where he, due to the work of the team, fools himself into thinking that his father didn’t want him to be like what he was and that he must dismantle his father’s company. Ariadne soon follows when Cobb insisted that he would come find Sato whose injuries left him unconscious in the previous level. Cobb eventually finds Saito as an old man and reminds him of their agreement. The team finally wakes up with the simultaneous kick. Saito makes a phone call to honor their promise and the team, together with Cobb arrive at the Los Angeles Airport with no hiccups.\n\nArriving home, Cobb tests whether he’s in the reality by spinning a top that supposedly doesn’t stop spinning in the dream world but chooses to ignore what happens to join his children in their yard. A rather ambiguous ending, Nolan himself claimed that he always intended to end the film that way to leave the viewers to interpret it for themselves.\n\nIn the following sections of this paper, we would examine the film Inception from an Archetypal, Ideology and Hyperrealism perspective.\n\nARCHETYPAL CRITICISM\n\nThe film Inception is arguably one of Christopher Nolan’s best films. But from an archetypal perspective, most elements in the film have already been incorporated in his previous movies such a Memento (2000), Insomnia (2002), The Prestige (2006), and the first two installments of The Dark Knight trilogy (2005 & 2008).\n\nApplying the literary criticism of Northrop Frye (Norton, 2001), pioneer of the archetypal criticism, Inception can be categorized as tragic in which the audience witnesses the downfall of the protagonist. Under these categories, there are two other sub-categories namely tragedy and satire which is associated with the seasons of autumn, and satire. At first glance, the film can be easily characterized as a tragedy evident by the seriousness of Cobb’s problems and the complications that it produces in his jobs. However, as the film progresses, one might not be able to help but wonder whether the film is leaning towards the satirical realm in which the protagonist loses. In the film, it was neither implied nor denied whether Cobb has really come back to reality, whether he actually succeeded in his mission or is still trapped within the deep recesses of his subconscious.\n\nAside from genre, Frye also characterizes the symbols presented in each of the two main genres. These symbols include human, animal, vegetation, mineral and water (Norton, 2001). In the comedic genre, animals are docile instead of predatory in tragic. No such symbols were emphasized in the film. For vegetation, wild forests and barren lands permeate the landscape of a work. This is evident in the Inception in a number of sequences such as the third dream level – a fortified hospital in the middle of a forest – and the Limbo wherein ruins of Cobb’s and Mal’s shared dream city lay. This is also the case in the mineral sphere. For water, floods and seas are typical in the tragic genre which can be also observed in the film.\n\nSeveral characters in the film fall in the typical archetypes. The most notable of these is femme fatale which is a female character who causes a lot of destruction and catastrophe. This character is perfectly portrayed by Marion Cotillard as Mal who, because of her own husband’s actions killed herself and brought a great deal of grief to Cobb. Mal does not only serve as the beginning of Cobb’s misery, she also continuously appears throughout the movie to thwart Cobb’s plans. She is the very representation of the misery of Cobb. Meanwhile, Ariadne, based on her namesake is a very typical archetype in myths. The original Ariadne helped Odysseus in navigating the maze of the Minotaur. Very much like her, the Ariadne in Inception does not only help Cobb in designing the dream landscapes but also helps him in navigating his issues.\n\nAs said in the earlier part of this section, Inception is a “very Nolan” film in terms of style, narrative, and editing. Most of Nolan’s films particularly feature men but not just ordinary ones. Mostly, he features men of above average intelligence and questionable state of mind such as Leonard Shelby in Memento, an insurance investigator who is unable to form long-term memories, Alfred Borden and Robert Angier, two brilliant magicians in the prestige and the notorious Bruce Wayne in the Dark Knight movies.\n\nIn terms of narrative and editing, Nolan masterfully crafts two innately opposing concepts from these elements. Nolan prefers a subjective type of storytelling wherein he wants the audience to experience the story through a character’s point of view. However, he also wants to convey a story from different angles of different characters. In Inception, he successfully accomplishes these seemingly paradoxical elements by putting Cobb and his mental state at the center of the story, while executing crosscutting, a method of rapid editing aimed to create a freer field of view by shifting the scenes from person to person, from place to place. In the film, the levels of dreams work accordingly to his style while never losing sight of Cobb’s state of mind. By doing this, Nolan is able to create unusual types of storytelling such as in Memento where the audience only see bits and pieces of memories and are not arranged in a chronological order. In the Prestige, the story runs through the secret diaries of both magicians presented as voice overs which present the story in two angles.\n\nIn conclusion, the Inception is a tragic piece and incorporates most of the symbolisms of the genre based on the work of Northrop Frye. Additionally, two female characters stand out as archetypal character types: Mal as a femme fatale, and Ariadne which is based on the Greek mythological character of the same name. Lastly, this review incorporates previous works of Christopher Nolan in an attempt to create a general picture of his directing style.\n\nIDEOLOGY PERSPECTIVE ON THE MOVIE INCEPTION\n\nThe movie is about what is the reality, and if it’s the truth. Dreams represent individual realities of the characters which become complicated once the dreamer cannot distinguish the dream from the reality. Althusser’s premise is that “ideology represents the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence,” and “ideology has a material existence”. In simple words, the world we live in, and how we perceive it, is the ideology that the world itself has given to us. Our practices and attitudes express an ideology that materializes it. And this ideology expresses itself in many forms/commodities (i.e. beliefs, tradition, commodities, art). People think that the way they interpret the world is the reality, and therefore the truth. Because of this, they believe that it is outside “ideology”, when in reality, the truth they cling to, is just a mere product of ideology they live in. The characters’ confusion, especially for Mal and Saito, is the product of being completely submerged in the pool of ideology that is why it is imperative for the dreamers to choose a unique item–the totem, to tell them what is the reality. Unfortunately, the two were trapped in the Limbo which symbolizes the web of ideology that all of us fear to fall into.\n\nAnother aspect of Althusser’s basis of ideology is that it presents a relatable social problem and has an imaginary solution. The movie portrays the world problem that people are bombarded by ideology without realizing it. Althusser believes that ideology is “most lethal when presented with the mass in indirect form”. That is why ideologies that resonate until today has no history, but these must have an origin but it cannot be traced further from the person who bears it in mind. And when it reaches one’s mind it has no beginning nor end, thus becomes eternal. Cobb’s goal is to implant an idea in Fischer’s mind which should be “ the simplest version of the idea –the one that will grow naturally in the subject’s mind… the smallest seed that can grow to define or destroy the world”. This line from the movie describes how ideology travels through peoples’ mind and how it penetrates the very core of our consciousness. Ideology is not forced to us in an explicit way, rather it is understatedly handed out to us, as if we, ourselves has formed it- believing it as our own and our truth. In which Althusser explains that makes people as a subject of a higher force of ideology. He stated that “the subject “is only constitutive of all ideology insofar as all ideology has the function (which defines it) of ‘constituting’ concrete individuals as subjects”. Fischer or the “concrete individual” believes that he is in control (the subject) of his own ideology, but in reality, he is just an object of Cobb’s inception. Ideology makes us believe that we are subjects that made conclusions by ourselves when the truth is, that idea has been planted to us that directs our consciousness and rationality.\n\nThe imaginary solution then is to bring back the characters to the reality. Cobb’s attempt to bring Mal back by implanting an idea to her that the world she lives in is not real became successful, but eventually, the idea totally consumed her that she killed herself in the end. Cobb then tried a different method with Saito. He reasoned with him and made a point that the world he lives in is not real. Cobb was successful to break Saito’s confusion, in which Saito finally become the subject of his own consciousness. This is the solution that the movie wants to depict. The self-awareness, to wake ourselves from the ideology that the society has imposed on us.\n\nBut at the end of the movie, Cobb did not bother to know if the world he is in is the reality. He immediately ran to his kids and hug them, which shows the directors view of the reality. Nolan said in an interview that the last scene tells us to chase our own realities. Maybe the realities that we want because after all, the world we have has thousands of subsets of realities and we have the liberty to choose what version of reality we want. And in Cobb’s case, he wants a reality where he’s happily living with his children.\n\nTo wrap it up, Inception embodies the ideology, its process and its extent of effects to people’s lives. It shows how blinded we are by the world we live in. It helps us lift up the thick blanket of ideology that governs the subjects that we thought we were and be self-aware of the realities that we have and want to believe in.\n\nHYPERREALISM\n\nThe majority of the film is undoubtedly hyper-reality. Dreams are made very close to the reality that the characters in it are bound to be lost in it. Dreams in the movie show scenes that are obscure, almost exaggerating but these are the expression of each one’s reality that is why the boundary between reality and fictions diminishes.\n\nHyperrealism has a premise that reality and fiction blend so well that there is no clear distinction between the two, and more importantly no distinction between where reality ends and when fiction begins. When Cobb went to the university to recruit Ariadne, she showed her how dreams are being manipulated and how he penetrates someone else’s consciousness. On this scene, Cobb asked Ariadne, “Do you remember how we get here?”. She can’t answer it and did not realize that she was already dreaming. Cobb then explains that she is in a manipulated dream. People dreams and do not question his environment. The only thing that is plain to them is that they are in that moment, talking, breathing and living in that moment. He also explained that when a person dreams, he is unaware of it and most likely found themselves in situations that they can’t remember the start and how did they arrive to it in the first place. Additionally, dreams in the movie are unrelated and do some big jumps into places, seasons and time. Nevertheless, the dreamer will not notice it in his state since everything takes place inside his own consciousness, enclosed to hyper-reality. Moreover, dreams are composed of things that exist in reality and in our imagination, both interacts with each other and works as one that gives the illusion of being in the reality.\n\nIn conclusion, the simulation in the movie is the film, and Fischer was made believed to be in his version of reality, when in fact, Cobb was the one who was giving him the “reality”. Dreams according to the film are made up of both reality and are imagination that mingles with each other to form hyper-reality.\n\nSources:"
