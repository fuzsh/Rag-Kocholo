        "text": "Synopsis\n\nDom Cobb is a professional thief operating in the field of corporate espionage who works with his business partner Arthur. Their speciality is dream infiltration which allows the duo to extract information from their targets. For their latest mission, they are hired by Saito, a Japanese businessman who seeks the supposedly impossible task of inception, supplanting an idea in a person’s mind through the layering of multiple dreams. Saito wants the son of his business rival – who is set to take over his father’s company – to dissolve it, and promises Cobb that if successful he will clear his criminal status, allowing him to return home to his children. Cobb and Arthur recruit a team of experts – a forger, a chemist, and an architect – to help them pull off this audacious heist in Christopher Nolan’s ambitious and enigmatic blockbuster."
