        "text": "July 27, 2010, 3:27 pm\n\nFiled under: Film Musings\n\n“INCEPTION” A film by Christopher Nolan\n\nI would like to start with Nolan’s own words about his initial inspiration behind “Inception” and how it developed into the movie it is today.\n\nI’d always wanted to make a film that addressed dreams, and do something set in that world. About ten years ago I focused in on the idea of a technology that might allow people to share their dreams, and the uses and abuses of that, and came up with this idea of doing a heist film set in the world of dreams where somebody could use a technology to penetrate a person’s subconscious.\n\nThe idea was always to tell a large-scale action film with an unusual twist to the world in which it takes place.\n\nChristopher Nolan\n\nThe above points at two key elements which are\n\na) The basic idea behind the film\n\nb) The treatment of the film\n\nThe idea behind the film which is the world of dreams, the mind and its infinite possibilities is exciting. Once that ‘idea’ took root in my mind I was greedy and felt the film did not want or rather did not choose consciously to leave the audience with a contemplative pause of a deeper nature, it was more concerned with the unfolding of the plot. But having said that it definitely offered the audience more than a regular formula Hollywood film.\n\nInstead of the perfect heist,\n\nCobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse; their task is not to steal an\n\nidea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime.\n\nBut no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the\n\ndangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb\n\ncould have seen coming.\n\nThis summer, your mind is the scene of the crime.\n\nThe intrusion of the individual’s mind with the dream as a tool is happening at three levels. At one very personal and emotional level of the key protagonist Cobb with who we identify with and at the other level with the main heist which is the framework story on which the plot of the film is strung on (ofcourse this is if you don’t get into the endless readings of the film which the nature of it has opened up to various eager audiences one of which is the film itself is a dream and nothing is real). So the film explores a personal and human story of intrusion of a loved one and also uses a very different kind of theft, and public intrusion which is entering someone’s mind without their consent at the level of the framework story. The third level of intrusion is the mind of the audience.\n\nThe personal level does dwell on the dangerous track of the real and the unreal and the thin line between sanity and insanity but it does not touch upon the other side of the potential of the subconscious and I would like to discuss that.\n\nWhat kind of dreams are we exposed to, there seems to be the use of a phenomenon called the lucid dream that is taking place in the film. And here I will take the liberty to talk about this for a moment. A lucid dream is a dream in which the dreamer is aware that he is dreaming. The dream usually becomes more vivid and memorable. Through controlling the dream, the dreamer can do anything possible, and most things impossible. Lucid dreamers use these to inspire, introspect and entertain. In early ages of history, lucid dreams were usually dealt with a lot of mysticism, and were usually associated with divine revelations. Actually, Indian shamans would be recognized by them having a lucid dream, as it was associated with the spiritual world. Further on, Tibetan Buddhists were practicing a form of yoga responsible for making a person stay conscious while dreaming. The first person to use the term “lucid dreaming” was the psychiatrist Frederik van Eeden, describing them as when someone would have the insight of being dreaming.\n\nLucid dreams are possible and if I am not wrong Nolan himself has experienced lucid dreams. But when asked if he could imagine that if we’ll ever have the technology to access another person’s dream? He says and I quote “I don’t think we will, no. While I enjoyed playing with the idea for the story, I came away with the realisation that the fact our dreams are private is very important. I came away feeling like our minds aren’t understood fully by science, and that kind of technology just couldn’t happen.”\n\nDespite the fact that lucid dreaming is a profound state of consciousness, and is a metaphor for enlightenment, or spiritual awakening by some like the Tibetian Buddhist monks does the film explore that aspect of reaching a more profound space in the dreamscape or could he really within the confines of the heist plot he had structured for the film. What is the state of limbo that the film talks about. Is the film presenting a particular philosophy or psychology of the mind is an interesting question to ponder over.\n\nThe film opens on the shores of the subconscious and explores levels of the subconscious mind all throughout the film but how is the nature of the deepest layer revealed, what is its quality and nature besides time being slowed as compared to the other layers what else happens, or have I missed something? As a philosophical question what does the deeper level of the subconscious offer man. Why is there an urge among artists and seekers to enter the deeper levels of the subconscious? We were taken to the shores of the sub conscious but maybe not allowed to dive deep into it. But maybe the film tried to stick with reality otherwise the relative reality of what the subconscious mind offers would not be apt to explore for a Hollywood film and it would not be a blockbuster.\n\nTalking about the treatment or style, I feel its closer to a Hollywood film but in that package manages to seep in a lot of food for thought and not a passive experience for sure. It’s an entertaining film and works as an intellectual jigsaw puzzle and touches the emotional chord however not trying too hard to appeal to the soul. Also I felt for a dream logic things were too orderly and except for the few instances like the train rushing onto the road, the laws of physics being played with occasionally, the dreamscape and dream logic was a bit less for my personal liking.\n\nAnd to end this musing with Nolan’s own words again as quoted below – if this is what he wanted he did a very good job of it with some great performance by Leonardo DiCaprio(Dom Cobb) and my personal favourite in the film Marion Cotillard(Mal) who bought along with her a stunning screen presence and emotional depth.\n\n“I think inception combines a lot of different genre, a lot of different types of movie making I am interested in. Primarily I think it’s a massively entertaining grand scale action film. Its something of a heist movie, its something of a science fiction film. It really combines a lot of different elements. Its also a love story I think at the heart of it. I like to think that its got a bit of something for everybody in there. Certainly for me, my ambition was to create a story and a world that embraced different types of human experience. All the types of grand scale Hollywood entertainment that I like to imagine is going to come on screen when I go to see a movie.”\n\n8 Comments so far\n\nLeave a comment"
