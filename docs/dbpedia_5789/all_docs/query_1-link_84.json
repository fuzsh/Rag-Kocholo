        "text": "Just like he did between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan will be shooting another project of his own before he returns to Gotham City. Nolan will direct a sci-fi action film called Inception at Warner Brothers which will be released in the summer of 2010. It is described as a \"a contemporary sci-fi actioner set within the architecture of the mind.\" Warner Brothers is producing with Nolan's wife Emma Thomas, as has been done on almost all of his previous films. The screenplay for Inception was written by Nolan and we're presuming he also collaborated with his brother Jonah Nolan.\n\n\"Chris Nolan is a visionary filmmaker who continually raises the bar with each movie he makes,\" Warner Brothers president Jeff Robinov said. \"We are thrilled to be collaborating again with him and Emma on this exciting new motion picture.\" Don't worry, this does not mean anything regarding the possibility of having a sequel to The Dark Knight out by 2011. Let's not forget that The Prestige was made in the three year time between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, and it would seem like he's following that same pattern this time as well. Christopher Nolan doing science fiction?! This could be the greatest news I've ever heard!"
