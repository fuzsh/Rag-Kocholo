        "text": "From Memento, to The Prestige, to The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan is quickly becoming one of the premiere directors of intellectual, yet crowd-pleasing entertainment. Now, just to jump right in, Inception continues this trend, while demonstrating more creativity than perhaps any of his other films.\n\nIf there’s one complaint that I can imagine people having over this film, it’s that the plot can be particularly difficult to follow. And while I feel that this is true to some extent, that’s because Inception is, in and of itself, a puzzle. All of the pieces are presented to you, and solving it depends not so much on intelligence, but on whether or not you find that sort of element appealing in a movie. It’s a film in which much of the dialogue is spent simply explaining the rules of this complex dream world, and therefore demands that you be wide awake.\n\nEven so, there had still better be an endearing cast of characters to follow, especially with this being a two-and-a-half hour experience, and thankfully, Inception delivers. While none of them, outside of DiCaprio’s character, have much backstory to speak of, they all feature exceptionally likable personalities, so by the time that the stirring climax hit, I was concerned about the fate of each and every one of them. Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s performance as DiCaprio’s right-hand man, Arthur, blew me away in particular. The guy doesn’t have a ton of screen time, but damn, does he leave an impression!\n\nUltimately, however, Inception is the story of DiCaprio’s character, Cobb. Now, I won’t say much, as giving any plot details outside of the synopsis would be a crime, but suffice it to say, it’s some pretty engrossing stuff, and DiCaprio definitely brings his A-game here.\n\nAlso, as expected, Hans Zimmer proves once again that he is the boss when it comes to musical scores, as each scene is enhanced tremendously by his material. He’s the sort of musician who can make even the simplest of actions seem more important than anything else that’s happened in human history. If only you, sir, could score my life.\n\nWith its challenging narrative structure, likable characters (if somewhat lacking in depth), and sheer visual splendor, Inception is easily among my favorite movies of the year, second only to Pixar’s latest classic. It’s been a rough summer movie season, and while we’ve still got quite a few weeks left before it’s officially over, Inception succeeded in reminding me why I dig this medium so much.\n\n9/10\n\nMy thoughts on Limbo:\n\n[spoil]In Limbo, the person believes that they are actually in reality and thus not realize they are dreaming. This is the big problem with Limbo, and clearly why nobody wants to go to it. Otherwise, why wouldn’t people not just kill themselves immediately to escape? I’m sure you gathered this though just from Cobb’s difficulty in convincing Mal that they were still dreaming and not in reality (and thus having to incept her)*.\n\nHowever, I believe that when one voluntarily enters Limbo, as is the case with Cobb and Ariadne towards the end of the film (when they go after Fischer), one is able to retain the knowledge that it is all a dream. Only those who are forced into Limbo, like Saito dying in a dream under heavy sedation, believe that Limbo is reality. Thus, Saito never realized that he was in Limbo. Then, following the establishment of how time passes through dream levels (five minutes in the real world equals an hour in the first dream level), and taking into account that Cobb was already three levels up before he entered Limbo, that means…\n\n5 minutes Reality = 1 hour Level 1\n\n→ 5 minutes x 20 = 1 hour\n\n→ 5 minutes Reality = 1 hour Level 1 = 20 hours Level 2 = 400 hours Level 3 = 8,000 hours Limbo. This means that about a year passes in Limbo in relation to 5 minutes in Reality (24 hours x 365 days = 8,760 hours)\n\nAnd remember, all of this takes place during a ten hour flight, so the initial 5 minutes Reality needs to be a much larger number to start the calculations (approximately equal to whatever time Saito died in Level 1), but to figure that out you’d need to calculate how long the plane had been flying when Saito died.\n\nSo, I did all this just to show that from the time Cobb entered Limbo, years and years and years had passed already passed since Saito entered Limbo on whichever Level he truly died on (which I think is technically the first Level because he must’ve bled out from the gun shot wound). This is why Saito appears as an old man. Again, you probably figured this out for yourself. In all that time, because of the rules of Limbo, Saito never realized he was in Limbo for all those years and thought it was reality.\n\nFortunately for the two of them, when Saito’s men searched Cobb’s body, they found the top. Saito of course recognizes the top as Cobb’s totem, which is why he says something like, “I knew one of these once.” Thusly, he knows the purpose of the top (to help the owner know if he is in reality or a dream) and proceeds to spin it. Since it never falls Saito realizes (for the first time in probably 30-50 years) that he is actually stuck in Limbo*. As well, Cobb, having entered Limbo voluntarily, retains that the world they are in is a dream, allowing him to say something like “I came to remind you about a past agreement”. Now Saito knows the truth, which is why in the beginning of the film (and the end, technically) he says something along the lines of, “Have you come to kill me?” Saito says this because dying is the only way to escape Limbo (as shown by Cobb and Mal placing their heads on a train track and then soon waking up in reality).\n\nThis means that Saito and Cobb (now both realizing that they are stuck in Limbo) have themselves killed. They then awake completely healthy and sane on the plane.\n\nOne problem people have is that because Saito was in Limbo for so long, he should’ve awoken on the plane with his mind like mush; completely ruined and nonfunctional - essentialy a person that only survives via life support. These people would be correct if the 10 hours of sedation had simply run out, thus awaking Saito regardless of being in Limbo. If he only woke up because the sedation ran out, Saito’s mind never would’ve died in Limbo, and considering he had been there for about 40 years, yes his mind would’ve been mush. Thankfully though, Cobb also enters Limbo and allows Saito to realize he is not in reality, thus prompting him to have them both be killed. That is the entire reason Cobb doesn’t join Ariadne in Limbo by jumping off the building to wake up; he needed to stay and prevent Saito’s mind from turning into mush! After all, no matter what happened in the dreams, the sedation would eventually wear off and they would all wake up.[/spoil]\n\nSo, to answer your question, amaslyo, Cobb is [spoil]definitely not in Limbo; he and Saito escaped[/spoil]. The question you should be asking, however, is: [spoil]Did Cobb end the film in reality or a dream?[/spoil]\n\n[spoil]* My big question, though, is how did Cobb (when stuck in Limbo the first time (with Mal)) realize he wasn’t in reality? I get that he found the top locked in Mal’s safe, but how did he know to go looking for it? I feel like this was explained, but I just can’t remember at the moment; I need to see the film again. But also, if Mal was so convinced that Limbo actually was reality (and thus not wanting to leave, thus causing Cobb to incept her) why did she lock the top up in the safe at all? *It seems she locked it up because she didn’t want to know if where she was was actually reality or a dream, that she just got tired of jumping around and wanted this one place to be her life and her reality (even if it wasn’t reality).\n\nThis makes the most sense to me. At first I had my doubts → Why wouldn’t Mal just spin the top the moment she entered this place? In that case it would’ve just kept on spinning and she would not that the world she was in wasn’t reality. That led me to think, ok… then why does she lock the top up? Why doesn’t she try to escape? As I was writing the above paragraph (before the italicized star) I realized the answer to own my question. She didn’t care what was what, she just wanted to stop jumping around and make the best of it! Glad that is settled Oh wait… omg… new thought***\n\n** If Saito bled out in the first Level, how did he continue to appear in subsequent Levels? This happens because Saito is hooked up to the dream machine in each Level while still alive in Level 1. Only when he bleeds out fully to death in Level 1 (quite a few minutes after being hooked up to the machine) does his death catch up to him in the following Levels.\n\n*** Why didn’t Saito have his own totem to help figure out if he was in a dream or not? You would think he would have one considering he goes on an inception run. The only reason I can think of for not having one is because Saito is really just a greedy businessman and not a trained extractor like Cobb, Arthur, and now Ariadne. Because of this, Saito is naive and doesn’t realize the true dangers of extraction/inception.\n\n**** I am completely in the ship that believes Cobb ended the film in reality; 100%. I think everything I wrote in this post proves that he escaped Limbo. The only way for Cobb to possibly not have entered reality at the end would be if the entire film was a dream, and I mean the entire film, from Cobb and Arthur’s audition extraction run, to rescuing Saito in Limbo. This is what many of the “Cobb is still dreaming” shippers believe happened. However, I think that that is way too complex, cruel, and a big waste of time of Christopher Nolan to do.\n\nHowever, I think that Cobb walks away from the top at the end because he doesn’t care if it is reality or not, just like Mal in Limbo. He just wants that location to be his final place to live happily with his children. Of course, you also probably realized that when you viewed the film. My only problem with this is that Cobb never saw the faces of his children when we know for a fact he was in a dream; yet he sees their faces at the end of the film. This gives us two options: 1. He is in reality at the end or 2. Even if he is dreaming, he fully believes that his world is reality. If option 2 is correct, it brings up the question: Why now? Why now does Cobb only fully believe that his world is real? The only answer to this is that the entire film was not only a dream, but it was also an incepetion on Cobb to convince himself that he was in reality (sort of the opposite of what he did to Mal). This theory is also widely believed across the board by many people. However, I once again repeat that this is just way too complex, cruel, and a big waste of time of Christopher Nolan to do.[/spoil]\n\nWow, this is one long post. If you took the time to read it, I hope it helped! It certainly helped me. I guess I was more thinking out loud than trying to answer your question.\n\nThanks for giving me this opportunity! I feel like I understand Inception way more than I did when I began writing this post."
