        "text": "Reaction Paper:\n\nMovie Flick: Inception\n\nCobb: I know how to search your mind and find your secrets. I know the tricks and I could teach them to you so that even when you’re asleep your defence is never down. Look if you want my help, you’re gonna have to be completely open with me. I need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife, better than your therapist, better than anyone. This is a dream and you have a safe full of secrets and I need to know what’s in that safe. In order for this all to work, you need to completely let me in.\n\nWhat is your reaction on the movie of Inception?\n\nCobb: What is the most resilient parasite? Bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm? An idea. Resilient… highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it’s almost impossible to eradicate. An idea that is fully formed – fully understood – that sticks; right in there somewhere.\n\nI have been hearing good reviews on the movie Inception for a long time. I have also planned on watching it many times, yet I haven’t watched a single part of it until it was played in our STS class. Upon watching it, I realized one thing: I was so stupid for not watching this awesome film! It has almost everything that I look for in a film: action, a touch of science, very good story, and a memory that will make your imagination work for a long time. This thing is simply two hours of pure awesomeness!\n\nThe idea of dream control has always fascinated me, and this movie has just shown me the kind of thrill that I want to experience in my dreams. You can be whatever you like, even break the laws of physics that you can’t hope to achieve in the real world. Basically, you are the god of your own realm! The movie also showed some of the possible uses of dream control, which I found quite disturbing. If thorough studies on dreams will be done and those applications will be made possible, a whole array of new crimes can be done such as theft of confidential information and the cultivation of an idea on other people’s mind which was done in the film. It would be much better if the dream world, if ever made much more accessible to the community, would be instead used for self-recreation and development. One thing that I also find interesting is the concept of the limbo. The idea of being imprisoned in an imaginary place with no easy means of escape, where you continue to get old with nothing left to do but to wait for your death is just terrifying. However, if only there will be a way to freely access this world in your mind, I think this will be the best place to visit because you can be wherever you want inside it. It will be the perfect world for yourself.\n\nRegarding the end of the story, whether Cobb’s reunion with his children was reality or a dream, I think that it was reality. The spin of the spindle in the last scene was not consistent although it didn’t stop until the end. Also, I think that Cobb has proven himself deserving to achieve the reality that he always wanted. It was an effective way to let the viewers think of an ending of their own. In this manner, the movie was able to keep the viewer’s imagination working. It will be up to us whether we will give Cobb the reality that he always wanted, or we will forever lock him in this false reality called dream.\n\nIt got me hooked the moment I read the “dream within a dream within a dream” part in the plot. I go crazy for overlapping scenes because I love the feeling of being dumb for a second inside a dark movie house while eating a lot of pizza and drinking extra-large size of Coke. I really like the feel of enlightenment after a second shade of doubt. I have never felt this ravenous for next scenes ever since I saw “Back to the Future 1, 2 and 3”. At first, you’ll get confused because the setting changes abruptly leaving your brows knotted in one line, then the next scene unfolds and you laugh feeling completely satisfied at having been toyed with by the director, Chris Nolan. A moment of not grasping a scenario is the key to keep my eyes on the screen. The dream levels are just perfect! You have to store the levels in mind so you won’t lose track of the story. While watching Inception, you need: number one, concentration and number two, concentration.\n\nAnother thing that got me so into this movie is its version of reality and fiction. I got mixed emotions every time the characters indulged themselves too much in a world created by the mind. I don’t know what to feel regarding the limbo concept, for instance. You get stuck in a dream world you created yourself. That’s a wish I know will never be granted, no matter how much I pray. It’s not only once that I prayed fervently to be an anime character or one of Potter’s friends or one of the vampires (admit it; they’re described as beautiful and rich). Although I know wishing for fantasy won’t do me any good, I still can’t help it. I’m sure a lot of people share my view.\n\nDom Cobb is one of the characters who got my attention. Although, it’s already kind of cliché to show this generation of movie-goers a character who-is-actually-good-but-messed-up-once-and-is-now-paying-for-his-misdeed, this Cobb somehow still stood out. Even though he shares dark past with countless characters from countless movies of countless generations, Leanardo DiCaprio brought out the best in Cobb! Despite the dull descriptions of Cobb, the fictional character, DiCaprio’s actions, facial expressions and words got me interested in dissecting Cobb’s emotions. First off, I don’t really think it’s proper to pry into other people’s business. Being someone who invades other people’s privacy for a living, I can’t imagine how much effort the society had exerted in order to push that someone into this mischief. I can’t really blame Cobb if he accepted another not so decent job from Saito. I tried putting myself in his shoes. I’d also do the same. I’d probably hold on to the hope that one last sin can erase everything. I’m guessing Cobb was imagining life after this last job. A life spent on taking care of his kids.\n\nAnother character who got me thinking through the night is Saito. Saito, the typical businessman. I admit to having sort of an admiration to emotionless businessmen. I love the way they can crush smaller businesses without blinking an eye. But, my strange preference has got limitations. I only admire those who fight fair and square. Business versus business. Our Saito here went to the extent of involving personal feelings which I have found extremely revolting. I view it as a sign of cowardice on his part and a taint on a businessman’s pride. However, I forgive his actions. I see him as the key to unlocking the slightest bit of Cobb that was interesting, after all.\n\nAside from those two, Ariadne also got into me. She’s the only girl in the group and I thought that was awesome. When will I ever get the chance to be on her shoes? Anyway, I think her name is very appropriate. It reminded me of the story of Theseus. It’s weird that her character is supposed to get someone into a maze and not out of the maze. The irony is cool. If Saito is the typical business-minded person, then Ariadne is the typical architect. If you are in love with your profession, you rarely think of harm when faced with a once in a lifetime challenge. That’s what I noticed in a number of movies that I’ve seen. Old scientists ready to risk their necks developing antidotes and skinny computer geeks giving it their best shot to help superheroes, are just examples. Ariadne got hypnotized by the idea of creating her own world. As Cobb had appropriately put, after experiencing the pure creation of constructing a dream, reality will no longer be enough for her. Ellen Page was good in acting, by the way. Her facial expressions were just right, and the way she said her dialogues was effective.\n\nMy favorite scene is when Cobb talked about his wife’s death. I wasn’t able to predict the reason at all. When I knew of the story, I thought it was genius! I cannot blame Cobb for being the way he is. A man imprisoned by guilt. I wonder how he will escape from that ordeal, or to put it more appropriately, how he will face that ordeal. Many people in real life are also like Cobb. I know of a man who accidentally killed his own son. Thinking of how they can handle their own feelings is actually more boggling than Inception itself.\n\nFor me, Cobb’s reconciliation with his kids is real. The others say that the children in the very first scene were wearing exactly the same clothes as the children in the last scene. Bloggers have expressed their views that Cobb just extended his dream to be with his kids. But I checked the list of characters and found out that the kids from the first scene and the last were portrayed by different characters. Times have passed, so perhaps the director changed the characters in order to point out some differences, therefore telling the audience it is, indeed, reality. I love the ending for Cobb. Most characters with dark past usually end up in prison blabbing things like they’re happy with the way things went, etc. etc. But Cobb, most fortunately, didn’t get punished. Job done, new life. That’s one of the few unique things about this dull character.\n\nI congratulate the staff of Inception for doing a good job with the visual effect. Just seeing the posters for Inception told me I was in for a real treat. The characters were also well-chosen. This movie will forever be imprinted on my mind.\n\nWhat’s Good: Nolan is one of the few masters the cinema has left. His films are beautiful puzzles. Flaws are secondary to the ambition, clarity and intense, German-like origination of his vision. However one chooses to look at this movie it is a landmark science fiction film that we will be talking about for years.\n\nWhat’s Not: However garishly constructed, when you dissected or deconstruct some Nolan films you often are left feeling empty handed and betrayed. “Memento” was that kind of film and in a lot of ways so is “Inception.” The screenplay is one of the biggest assets and flaws. DiCaprio is miscast as usual. The action is unnecessary and illogical (can’t believe I said that). And while I have a lot more bad things to say about it than good, I like the movie, I’m just not going to pretend it’s an all around masterpiece.\n\nNote: Given the nature of “Inception” I thought it best to write about it with my gut and heart more than my head. The second after watching I was moved to get whatever I had to say down as quickly as possible but not to over think it’s “meanings” because doing so might lead to levels of madness of DiCaprian proportions. My reaction is obviously going to change for the better or worse after have some time to sleep on it (though I wish I could sleep in it as well) but know that I’m writing all this immediately after seeing the movie. I’m posting this three and a half to four hours after STARTING, not finishing, the movie and that’s give or take the time it took for all those IMAX trailers, driving home and feeding my hungry dogs that were waiting for me in the dark when I got home. Whatever the following response is, it may be more unrefined and impulsive than usual but, really, not much more than my usual crap I’m capable of. Given that at this moment the film is ranked on the IMDB as the third best film ever made there’s (you gotta love IMDB users) a lot of knee jerk(off) reactions are around even though none of us really know how it will hold up. The drive to talk about this film is just that powerful and just that’s welcome given the sad dearth of thought (un)provoking summer movies.\n\nI have a feeling that the more someone likes “Inception,” the more in denial they are about how much they like “Inception.” It’s as great and technical and expertly crafted as a film can be. It is also as hollow and empty –but beautifully so– as one of Esher’s stair cases leading to nowhere. That it looks hypnotically fabulous on its way there counts for something or, in this film’s case, everything. Like one of Esher’s playful works, this film is aware of itself and made to be looked at as such. There is a scene where the mark/dreamer is told by the protagonist that he’s in a dream. His dream in fact and that he is being told this so that he can be taken further and deeper down into various levels of this overarching dream. Noland is doing to us what he has in the previous films of what I would call his head-trip trilogy. In “Memento” his character broke all sorts of fourth walls to guide us into his fractured and, as it turns out, literally fleeting attention span. As he ran from his reality, we were brought closer and closer to it and while it seemed to signify so much at the beginning, it all evaporated after we revisited it and applied the film’s own logic to its plot. The entirety of “The Prestige,” Nolan’s best film to date, was built as a cinematic magic trick that the audience was brought in to participate in because a magic trick cannot exist without someone there to be (willingly) tricked. That film worked perfectly because when you take the pieces apart you get something substantial–a timeless parable about human obsession and the thin line between magic and science in our world. And with “Inception” Christopher Nolan takes our hands once again, using his firmest and most aggressively forceful grip to date, and plunges us in a very mediated journey into the world of dream espionage (which is a lot cooler than calling it dream stealing). It’s a bit “Matrix,” a bit “Open Your Eyes”/”Vanilla Sky” a bit of a Joss Whedon dream episode and a whole heap of “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.” Also substantial is the amount of in-dream shooting and clunky metaphors pertaining to our unconscious mind where people literally lock up their secrets. The film is strangely lacking in surrealism but, given the plot and even tagline “the dream is real,” it’s very refreshing that the director didn’t resort to any nonsensical dream related Dali-esq “randomness.” The dreams of “Inception” have weight and a consistent internal reality that the film, whatever its flaws are, benefits from sticking to all the way to the end. The final, open to interpretation shot existing as a fun little existential joke that only Nolan is capable of ending his film with.\n\nWhat I admire is all the work that went into it. And who wouldn’t? To watch it unfold is to enjoy the power of any well thought out and choreographed cinematic achievements. It’s as if the impossible has happened, Kubrick merged with Fellini! What I do not admire is also very clear cut. While the craft is there and at the top of its form, this movie’s basic plot is just not very interesting and it spends a lot of time masking that with fantastic sights and constantly juggled Rube Goldbergian machinations. It’s a flashy and well made hurricane of a movie, but to what end? What are we left with? When the layers are taken apart we are stuck with a very thin story that has almost no reason for existing on its own terms. It’s about a man who is not very interesting that has lost something that was not very interesting or original to begin with! He does everything he can to get “it” back and I kept waiting to get to the heart of what that is exactly and once I did was not impressed. The thinness of the story brings with it of course very thin character motivations as well and, worst of all, a very thin excuse to have people shooting guns at well dressed cyphers, existing as a built in security measure (an dream defense army whose job is to protect their host’s mind). The action scenes where characters shoot at each other feels off. Pondering “what is real” is of course nothing new and feels even more shallow in a college philosophy class kind of way this time around then it did when “Matrix” came out. The plot I will not waste my time describing because, first, this is not the kind of film you get people to see by explaining it and second, well, as I said: what plot? There’s lots of talk of getting “information” and beyond lazy MacGuffins featuring hard to crack safes with hard to locate combinations and hard to care about documents within these mind-lockers. Such heavy handed icons never break free to signify anything other than themselves and I was never once pleased to find out what “vital information” any given characters was hiding. Perhaps that’s a deliberate way to impress upon us how, in real dreams, feelings are always more profound and lingering than the minute details. But that would assume that the film has much feeling or emotion. As is, the details are unclear and the emotions lack even definition.\n\nI could talk about the beautiful, near non-stop music soundscape that Han Zimmer has created. This is amazing work by a seasoned composer that is able to lull us in with dreamy orchestral synths that guide without ever bringing us to the surface as, say, John William’s did with “A.I.” The editing is also first rate. It has that elliptical, metronome like construction that “The Prestige” used so well to its advantage. All the cuts are in service of the story’s vision rather than providing us with visual indulgences and I think that’s an important distinction to make. Same goes for the special effects. When characters float around and buildings topple into themselves, there’s a reason for it. Not a reason that is particularly engaging but a reason none the less. The way the film is put together, first in Nolan’s mind, second in the always brilliant Wally Pfister’s visual mapping and finally in Lee Smith’s cluttered but somehow coherent cutting room. These combine to form a effect worth treasuring and a big reason to come back again and again to this special world. The cast, in true human fashion, introduce flaws to Nolan’s otherwise perfect technical construct. He’s like Kubrick in the sense that humans always taint the notion of film in its pure form.\n\nThe film is has a pair of great actors, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and an underused Michael Caine. There are also competent but sometimes overrated performers such as Ellen Page, Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy and Marion Cotillard. There are even WTF casting choices that rival Eric Roberts in “Dark Knight;” Tom “where have you been” Berenger and Levitt’s “Brick” co-star Lukas Haas appear. Oh and, yeah, Leonardo DiCaprio. Except for Leo, nobody really does a bad job. The characters, however, are all as distant and faceless and as mechanically driven as all those unconscious/subconscious Mr. Smiths running around people’s dream worlds trying to seek out the foreign body. Nothing about these characters except for that persistent dream stalker played by Cotillard, the beautiful Freddy Kruger of this dream worlds (she acts as a much needed wild card that comes in and disrupts the dream team’s “plan” in very cool ways) stand out in any way that inspires or evokes much feeling or depth. I didn’t not really like these characters but that’s only because I did not know them! Or their highly specialized jobs for that matter. They may be the “best” at what they do but I was always are left having to take the film’s word for it because what each character’s job is, such as a “dream architect” that could learn her job and be the best in the world at it after about a half day of unconscious training, makes no sense but at least the film doesn’t dwell because what good would come out of that? Even after spending two and a half hours with these people I didn’t come close to having any sort of organic connection with them or what they do. When Levitt pecks Page on the lips it was the only moment of genuine human involvement and while I liked it a lot it also seemed like an after thought, and a tease of one at that.\n\nAlso integrated awkwardly is a pivotal snow-set section of the film which is not only narratively bland and unclear but represents the only instance where the technical aspects let the film down (stark but dull visuals and hurried editing make it hard to get a fix on anything that’s going on in the snow–it was like a level out of “Moder Warfare 2”). The actors are given very simple performance tools and very challenging physical demands to play with and while few bring much to their characters beyond exactly what is required of them, at least they don’t take away from them either. Except for DiCaprio. As usual he is out of league and unable to draw me in to his reality. He is unconvincing and uninteresting. Another actor, Christian Bale for example (I know, I know, you don’t have to say it, I’m too much of a Bale fan), could have finessed the part up a bit, adding perhaps small touches of humanity and some wry humor to go along with all that overwrought intensity. DiCaprio, who is always so wound up in his movies (and always so damn obvious about his turmoil), fails to hold the dream at large together because he is always so glacially sober which, again, is ironic given the fluid subject we’re dealing with. The character is just a drab fellow that is never fun or energetic on screen. He’s a total drag. To his credit, Leo was having a good year after a somewhat similar turn in a far more (as performances, and perhaps films, go) successful mind bending “Shutter Island.” Both movies exist to takes us into the corridors of this actor’s crumbling psyche, failing to realize of course that there’s just not that much in there to get lost in.\n\n2. What is your analysis of the movie Inception?\n\nMal: I’ll tell you a riddle. You’re waiting for a train, a train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you, but you don’t know for sure. But it doesn’t matter. How can it not matter to you where that train will take you?\n\nInception: My Labyrinthine Analysis\n\nInception is one of the best films Hollywood has put out in years, and stands out as a diamond in a large stack of garbage. If the liberals in Hollywood were really worried about the environment, they wouldn’t cloud the artistic environment with so much pollution. But Inception is something else. A film that mystified many, it also became the subject of intense online debates and speculation as to its ultimate meaning. I believe I have cracked it, and I think I cracked its code upon first viewing. I subsequently viewed it two more times, and collected even more clues confirming my basic thesis. Let’s analyze.\n\nOne cannot properly understand Inception without familiarity with the basic concepts of Carl Jung, some Freud, and a sprinkling of esoterica. The esoteric elements coalesce nicely, due to Jung’s emphasis on mythology and archetypes. I am not here advocating Carl Jung, to be clear. Jung was very much opposed to the basic worldview I espouse, but we must still interact with and decode these phenomena, inasmuch as they are a part of the world we operate in.\n\nWhat is happening in Inception is just this: the entire sequence is about Cobb himself returning from the abyss of chaos to his true identity, wherein he reaches a kind of personal paradise. Cobb is, in fact, the only character, and the other characters are all “projections of the subconscious,” as he explains to Ariadne in her first test dream sequence. The original clue to this interpretation is in the beginning when Cobb, Saito and his associates are in the room (Saito’s apartment) where the revolution of some kind is taking place outside. Saito recognizes the carpet is not his, and calls Cobb out for keeping him within yet another layer of dream-existence. Cobb tells us later that the projections never attack the dreamer, but the others supposedly perceived as intruders. However, if this was the case, then the revolutionaries should have attacked Cobb and Saito; but they don’t – they attack Nash (played by Lucas Haas), who is supposed to be the dreamer in this layer. And if you note, they never attack Cobb – ever.\n\nThe other crucial element is that the story is not a linear story, just like a dream is often non-linear. The film concerns essentially the “architecture of the mind,” as director Christopher Nolan described it. Jung’s theories involve the idea that the individual is a disparate instantiation of the collective unconscious, and thus fragmented from the collective. The collective conscious manifests itself in images and archetypes in our deepest selves – the lowest of the subconscious. It is here that we hide out most intimate failures, sins and fears. We guard this sensitive part of our selves, and have defense mechanisms by which we hide and guard these deeper, more elemental ethereal truths about who we really are. For Jung, being the gnostic he was, the goal is to overcome all purported fragmentation, work through the so-called self-realization/individuation process, and thus escape dualities. The masculine “side” must reconcile with the feminine. One notices here familiar themes found throughout the history of alchemy, and Jung was known for his penchant in such arcane studies.\n\nThis, then, is the context in which Inception can be understood, and in no other. Cobb represents, in a way, every man, and thus we begin with Cobb stranded “on the shore of his subconscious.” He is fragmented and separate from who he is – alone and has forgotten his true life and identity. Familiar themes as found in gnosticism here emerge, such as the myth of alienation from Sophia as found in tractates such as theHypostasis of the Archons. And this is undoubtedly the font from which Jung drew.\n\nCobb must, through the process of self-reconciliation and integration become who he truly is. Whether there was an actual person with some similar history as presented in certain scenes of the film is up for debate, but I tend to think so. We see, for example, when Cobb is in the dream realm with Mal, the buildings are all uniform and part of a clearly imaginal city. However, there is a brief scene towards the end where Mal is with Cobb in old age, and the background city is an actual city with variant architecture. In fact, the architecture of the buildings is also key to decoding the narrative: all of the architecture throughout the film is the architecture seen in the city of his subconscious that he built with Mal. Each locale in the film has a particular architecture; they are all found in the subconscious city. And this is because man is seen as a microcosm of the macrocosm.\n\nNumerous clues that support this reading are also given throughout. To begin with, the basic plot is fantastical and impossible – entering another person’s dream through a cheesy-looking briefcase apparatus. Granted, the film can be itself asking us to suspend belief, yet at the end, when Cobb confronts Mal, his shade in Jungian lingo (or dark side), she tells him he has been living a fantastical lie – traversing the globe being chased by international corporations – it’s impossible. Cobb works for “Kobol,” which is perhaps a reference to the actual software development company or perhaps toBattelstar Galactica’s “lords of kobol,” who are the gods of Olympus, which would fit perfectly into the Jungian ethos, not to mention Ariadne, who is the anima archetype – one half of the anthropomorphic unconscious. It could also have reference to Cabal, or Kabbala, the Jewish mystical theory of reality that has at times fallen into pantheism. This will be the downside of the ultimate message of the film – that, like the Matrix, reality is a manifestation of our consciousness – solipsism. But solipsism is an impossible, self-refuting philosophy that is nothing more than a rehash of the ancient pagan Hindu concept of Maya.\n\nAriadne is also, as has been noted, the character of Greek mythology associated with labyrinths and helping Minos defeat the minotaur. The entire film, you see, is the labyrinth of Cobb’s unconscious mind, seeking integration and realization. Note as well that the inception, or idea they “plant” is that “it’s all a dream.” An inter-contextual inception that they plan for “Fisher” (Cillian Murphy) is the idea that he will break up his father’s empire. In Jungian and Freudian analysis, this is crucial, for the male child must battle to establish himself as an identity apart from the father, who is seen for a time in early development as a rival. Here, however, we are dealing with the symbolic, and so Fisher is a further manifestation of Cobb’s psyche. Fisher is the child archetype and the fracturing the empire is symbolic for the individual consciousness’ separation and alienation. It is Cobb who has been “fragmented.” His psyche is the “empire,” because the entire city – the entire universe – is his own dream or consciousness. He is the architect. Again, there really is no clear point in the film in which we know we are in the realm of waking life. This is why Ariadne pulls together two mirrors and it agitates Cobb when he looks in both directions and sees a fragmented image of himself, infinitely, in both directions. In fact, it is Cobb throughout the film, who is constantly being given clues (as is the viewer), that he is in a dream state and has constructed elaborate layer upon layer of labyrinthine stories and myths to hide his dark side – represented by Mal.\n\nAnother interesting clue is the totem itself. The totem Cobb has is supposed to be Mal’s. Yet Cobb tells Ariadne that you can’t use someone else’s totem. This is another clue that the totem itself is, for Cobb, just another piece of the myth he has constructed to cloak himself in. This is also why the sub-theme of the secret items hidden in safes is also really just about Cobb. As we probe deeper and deeper as the movie progresses, the real secret is the safe in which Cobb hid Mal’s totem. And when Cobb explains this at last to Ariadne, he says that the ultimate secret is that’s “it’s all a dream.” The Inception, then, is the idea in that had overtaken Cobb himself. Another clue along these lines is when Ariadne sneaks into Cobb’s anniversary room, she steps on a broken wine glass. When Cobb later speaks with Mal in the anniversary hotel room, he steps on the same glass and even says the same phrase Ariadne had earlier to Mal. This is one of many clues that Ariadne is Cobb. Another clue in this scene is that Mal isn’t even on the same building ledge. She is on the ledge of a “mirrored” hotel room across the street. All throughout clues are given, such as is that when they first appear to enter Fisher’s mind, the train from Cobb’s dream appears. Unless they were in Cobb’s dream, which they weren’t, this should not have happened. This was the whole reason Ariadne was brought along – because Cobb could no longer build “cities.”\n\nOther clues include the fact that when Cobb talks to his daughter on the phone from the hotel room after his first encounter with Saito, the daughter on the phone is noticeably older than the daughter in his memory and in the final scene. In fact, this is the biggest clue – when Cobb returns “home,” his children haven’t aged at all, and are, in fact, standing in very same pose as in his dream. Keeping in mind that the totem doesn’t really tell you anything anyway, it is thus unnecessary to base the solution to the film on whether or not the top continues to spin in the final sequence.\n\nInception is an amazingly deep work, and represents a step in the right direction for Hollywood. I can’t praise it enough, but I do have to note that it seems to leave us with a kind of ultimate relativism – as if all reality is really just a phantasm of our own mind. “Reality” is just a dream. One might argue that this isn’t necessarily what the final message is, but it seems to point in that direction, and this is not a healthy direction to point us in. Reality is just that – reality. I can imagine myself as the emperor of the world, or that 2 + 2 = 5, but all the Hindu maya I imbibe won’t change those facts.\n\n3. Can you combine the movie Inception with Philosophy?\n\nSaito: Have you come to kill me? I’ve been waiting for someone…\n\nCobb: Someone from a half remembered dream.\n\nSaito: Cobb? Impossible. We were young men together. I’m an old man.\n\nCobb: Filled with regret…\n\nSaito: Waiting to die alone…\n\nCobb: I’ve come back for you… to remind you of something. Something you once knew…\n\n[the top spins without end]\n\nCobb: That this world is not real.\n\nSaito: To convince me to honor our arrangement.\n\nCobb: To take a leap of faith, yes. Come back… so we can be young men together again. Come back with me…\n\n[Saito reaches for the gun]\n\nCobb: Come back…\n\nInception and Philosophy: Because it’s Never Just a Dream\n\nWhen a newspaper reports that a liberal arts college somewhere is teaching a seminar on the hermeneutics of Lady Gaga, do we feel outrage, relief, or both? As the philosophical treatment of pop culture gains currency, it’s easy to be tempted by contradictory reactions: We long for a serious consideration of the seemingly frivolous, yes, but also for the deflation of academic self-seriousness. Inception and Philosophy is the latest entry in Blackwell’s Philosophy and Pop Culture series (previous titles have included The Daily Show and Philosophy and Mad Men and Philosophy, among many more), which apparently shares this slice of the publishing pie with Open Court Publishing’s Popular Culture and Philosophy series. One likes to imagine the two houses locked in a heated rivalry, each with armies of lecturers lying in wait to pounce on the latest cultural fad and deconstruct it before the other gets there first.\n\nWhile previous Blackwell books like The Simpsons and Philosophy and Star Trek and Philosophy encouraged playfulness, with Inception and Philosophy—a title about an ostensibly serious film made by a serious filmmaker with serious things on his mind—the editors try a different approach. They ask a series of writers to ruminate on the metaphysical questions raised by Christopher Nolan’s Oscar-nominated sci-fi blockbuster. Confronted with a film that actually interrogates being and time, however, these philosophers do little other than fall in line. The book never gets beyond a basic approach to philosophy—there’s much talk of intro-level Plato and Descartes and Augustine, and not so much of the nuances of Althusser or Baudrillard or Fredric Jameson.\n\nThanks to the film’s ambiguous ending, the first section of Inception and Philosophy dutifully focuses on the question, “Was it all just a dream?” and writer after writer dwell on the familiar issues: The problem of multiple interpretations, the question of whether we may be dreaming right now, or the paradox of caring about characters who may not exist in the first place (both in the film and the real world itself). Later chapters tackle the malleability of time, blind vs. rational faith, the question of free will, and, yes, the morality of the film’s caper narrative. One of the book’s more intriguing essays uses the film to discuss different philosophies of alternate worlds, playing Spinoza, Leibniz, and David Lewis against each other in considering the God-like powers of Inception‘s dream architects.\n\nGiven the ambitions of Blackwell’s series, it’s probably too much to wish that Inception and Philosophy‘s writers would go the full Zizek and use the film as a springboard to riff on Id Machines or the reality within illusions, or that they might place Inception alongside Solarisor Vertigo, other plangent, romantic films about the poverty of the male imagination when trying to conjure lost feminine objects. This is especially too bad because the film opens itself to such interpretations, and almost welcomes them: There’s even a scene at the end where Leonardo DiCaprio confesses to the dream-ghost of his dead wife that he can no longer imagine her in all her human detail. Is the problem here that writing about moments like these would bring messy things like gender politics and literary theory into the mix?\n\nThe final result of Inception and Philosophy is that what should be a liberating endeavor—seeking intimations of the metaphysical in a pop cultural object—has instead an antiseptic, scrubbed-down feel. Sanitized of any references to politics, film theory, or even other films, these essays are mostly clumsy efforts at intellectual gymnastics. Which is yet another misfire, as many of them position themselves as rebuttals to criticisms leveled at the film. Instead, by limiting themselves to basic concepts, they become inadvertent critiques of their own. They fail to allow the film, in all its full-bodied complexity, to breathe.\n\n4. Can you provide a film analysis of the movie Inception and the Language of Dreams?\n\nCobb: What do you want?\n\nSaito: Inception. Is it possible?\n\nArthur: Of course not.\n\nSaito: If you can steal an idea, why can’t you plant one there instead?\n\nArthur: Okay, this is me, planting an idea in your mind. I say: don’t think about elephants. What are you thinking about?\n\nSaito: Elephants?\n\nArthur: Right, but it’s not your idea. The dreamer can always remember the genesis of the idea. True inspiration is impossible to fake.\n\nCobb: No, it’s not.\n\nMany of you know I love the movie Inception. I love it so much that I believe it has edged outBlade Runner for the #1 spot on my fave science fiction movie list. I love Blade Runner, but the final act with Roy gets a little tedious for me.\n\nInception’s brilliance is its complexity. It took Christopher Nolan 10 years to write that screenplay, and many will admit that they still glean a little more from it with each viewing. Science fiction is the place for ideas, and this idea is a fascinating one. Plus, most sci-fi sticks to the so-called “hard” sciences, afraid to tackle the more fluid, complex world of psychology. Inception not only tackles psychology, but delves into an even more mysterious realm of psychology: dreams.\n\nFilm synopsis\n\nThe film is about invading others’ dreams to steal their ideas. Powerful people undergo extensive training to prevent such theft, and Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio’s character) and his band of helpers are trained for this. Inception, on the other hand, is actually implanting an idea in someone’s mind, so deep into their unconscious that they think it’s their own idea. Cobb and his colleagues are hired to hack into a billionaire’s son’s mind to convince him to split up his dying father’s monopolistic business empire, thus making room for others to compete in their trade. To do this, they must get him to sleep and create a dream, within a dream, within a dream, to implant the idea.\n\nAs with all big plans, things go awry. For one, Cobb has issues. There’s a reason he’s so skilled at this. [Spoiler Alert]. He once did this to himself and his wife, with disastrous consequences.\n\nDream Analysis\n\nDuring the film, much time is spent in people’s dreams. Although the sets were made to look great and add to the film’s visual appeal, certain things were intended as powerful symbols of the story.\n\nMuch of the information I’ve learned about dream symbols comes from what is, to my knowledge, the best dream website there is. It’s called Dream Moods, and it has a great Dream Dictionary with every dream symbol you can imagine.\n\nThe beach: At the beginning (and end) of the film, Cobb comes to on the beach. A beach can mean a few different things, but here he refers to it as “the shore of his unconscious,” suggesting it is the starting point at which one can only go deeper. It is also the meeting place between the rational (earth) and the emotional (water) of the mind.\n\nAngry mobs and explosions: Early on, they’re in Saito’s dream (which is actually Nash’s dream), attempting to steal Saito’s ideas. Saito is powerful and his mind has been trained to deal with such thefts. In his dream, you see an angry mob and lots of noisy explosions, both of which symbolize repressed anger. In this case, Saito’s mind is angrily defending itself against the invasion. Also, in this dream, the safe is a pretty straightforward symbol of Saito’s hidden secrets.\n\nThe elevator in Cobb’s dream: When Ariadne visits Cobb’s dream, she takes an elevator and sees aspects of his unconscious. The top level is at the beach. She then descends, suggesting she is delving deeper into his subconscious, and she finally goes to level B (for basement), which represents the most primal area of the unconscious. Here, she comes across the scene from the night Mal died, and an enraged, terrifying Mal. Death, terror, rage… all primal things. Interestingly, it’s one of those old elevators where you pull the barred door shut, showing us that Cobb’s dream memories are really more like a prison for him.\n\nThe spinning top: Mal’s (and eventually Cobb’s) reality test was a spinning top — if it stayed spinning, they were still under. This could be an interesting symbol of the the wasted time and “spinning in circles” that occurred during the massive number of years Mal and Cobb were trapped in their dream state, and the thing that made Cobb want out.\n\nCities: A lot of this movie takes place in cities, particularly big, sterile cities (e.g. the first level of the inception sequence with Robert Fisher, Cobb’s fake world where he spent decades with Mal…). They represent the isolation Cobb and Mal experienced during their extended dream state and the isolation Cobb experiences every day due to his losing Mal, not seeing his kids, and spending much of his time living in the past (via his dreams). Contrast the coldness of Cobb/Mal’s dreamworld with their real home, which is homey, warm, and comfortable.\n\nMal: Throughout the movie, Mal is a consistent troublemaker, interfering with Cobb’s dream work. But it isn’t Mal that’s the problem. Mal’s dead. It’s his memory of Mal (and what happened), buried deep in his unconscious mind, that’s the problem. She’s angry and even murderous, symbolizing his own suppressed rage at what happened and his own deeply-seated torn feelings about it that he refuses to deal with.\n\nPsychology\n\nTo perform inception, you need an idea “so simple that it will grow naturally in the subject’s mind,” Eames suggests. He recommends getting away from the original idea of monopolies and other business- or political-oriented ideas and getting more fundamental: the billionaire’s difficult relationship with his father. This gets away from the intellectual and deeper into the emotional, where it can be planted into the subconscious and allowed to grow. Why does this concept work? Humans, for all their big brains and intellectual capabilities, are emotional creatures at their cores. The unconscious is a place of emotion, and dreams are the realm of the unconscious.\n\nScience fiction is filled with father issues: Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, Jean Luc Picard and his father (Star Trek TNG), Lt. Tom Paris and his Admiral dad (Star Trek Voyager). No one has more influence on a man than his father, even if he was never around.\n\nThe inceptioneers exploit this father-son relationship to implant the idea for young Robert to split up his father’s monopoly — not because it’s the “right” thing to do or as an act of rebellion to his dad, but because it will offer him some type of resolution and catharsis for him. They decide, very astutely, that motivation to do good always trumps the motivation to punish.\n\nIn the end, Robert splits up his father’s company — not to rebel, but because he is shown, through the dream, at the deepest dream level, that his father does love him and and wants him to be a better man than him. What’s more cathartic than that?\n\nAnd Cobb finally gets his own resolution and catharsis when he confronts Mal in his dream, releasing her (and thus his own grief) from the “prison” they were both in.\n\n5. Can you discuss about the movie Inception, Dreams, and Freud?\n\nCobb: [from trailer] Dreams feel real while we’re in them. It’s only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.\n\nMovies delve into our dreaming self, that submerged and seething alter ego that emerges when the sun goes down. In the cinema we relive the life of the dreaming self. Movies thus tap into the dreaming aspect of human nature. Moreover, they improve upon our dream life. They give us the dreams we yearn for. It is a rare individual who is not fascinated by his own dreams, with their raw ability to reveal, their magical expressiveness, movies partake in this fascination. The impact of movies stems, then, at least in part, from the primal power of the dream. To be sure, the dream component of the movie experience is augmented by the special qualities of the medium, but the primary emotional hook originates in the evocation of the dream… The best directors – Luis Buñuel, Alfred Hitchcock, David Lean, Stanley Kubrick, Steven Spielberg, and others – seem to me to recognize the essentially dreamlike character of the movie world, and they trade upon it in their films. What is A Clockwork Orange but an audacious dream adventure insidiously combining nightmare and wish fulfilment?\n\nDreams are also of particular importance in psychoanalytic thought. Freud famously described them as being “the royal road to the unconscious”.\n\nThis then creates an interesting three way relationship between film, dreams and psychoanalysis with the latter having been among the most dominant forces in film theory and criticism for the past few decades.\n\nChristopher Nolan’s Inception manifests and coalesces these three things. It is filmmaking on a huge scale with the very best production values of modern Hollywood which takes as its subject matter the interrogation of dreams and whose emotional narrative (as opposed to the functional narrative about corporate espionage) is essentially the working through of the psychoanalytic process.\n\nFor a filmmaker within the Hollywood system, Christopher Nolan is unusually pre-occupied with psychological human states to the degree that they often act as the primary theme of his films.Memento’s narrative structure is built around the short term memory limitations of its protagonist.Insomnia explores the affects of extreme sleep deprivation as its lead character struggles to function in a state in which he is never fully awake or asleep, throwing into question his ability to interpret events accurately or remember them fully. Even Nolan’s Batman films are, at their core, concerned with creating a representation of the psychological state of someone who we can believe would turn himself into a vigilante and dress up as a bat. The Prestige sits somewhat outside of this theme but also shares similarities with Inception in its playing with the dichotomy between perception and reality.\n\nChristopher Nolan does a few things very well in terms of his deployment of certain aspects of film grammar and technique, particularly cross cutting. With Inception Nolan spends the first hour setting up the premise of having the characters simultaneously occupy multiple levels of dream space which then allows him to play out all of these together using this technique. His confidence and competence in this regard is crucial to ensuring that the audience is free to follow what might be a very complicated concept and concentrate instead on the ever more complex plot machinations.\n\nIn Inception, Cobb (Leonardo Di Caprio) describes one of the interesting aspects of dreaming that allows the characters to infiltrate a subject’s dream world, “in a dream we create and perceive simultaneously.” McGinn reminds us that this simultaneously active and passive process is analogous to the experience of film watching (p155), “We passively receive, through our sense organs, the images that populate the screen… But we also interpret what we see: we employ our imagination to construct the characters and story line, and this is an active business. This kind of imaginative seeing is an amalgam of active and passive, construction and reception.” Nolan cleverly acknowledges this parallel as Ariadne (Ellen Page) actively manipulates the world around Cobb on the streets of Paris at one point creating two large mirrors that she makes face each other to reveal the infinite reflection within a reflection (symbolic of the infinite complexity of the unconscious mind perhaps, paralleling the notion of dreams within dreams). The camera draws attention to itself in this scene by its very absence where it should have appeared in the reflection (removed via camera trickery or CGI). Although not explicitly ‘breaking the fourth wall’ by revealing the camera and ruining the suspension of disbelief, the ‘fourth wall’ is implicitly broken and Nolan reveals himself to be creating the world of the dream within the film as Ariadne is.\n\nA lot of what has been written by critics about Inception has focused on its originality. I too think the film is original in some ways but not in the same ways that most critics have proposed.\n\nInception is an amalgamation of various genres and heavily references and pays homage to other films throughout. Cobb’s relationship with his ex-wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), is hugely reminiscent of Clooney’s character’s journey in Steven Soderberg’s Solaris for example. The film’s action and globetrotting scenes have been openly discussed by Nolan as an attempt to recreate the scale and sense of the early Bond films, in particular On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, with its snow set base and ski chase sequence. Echoes of The Matrix abound as characters simultaneously ‘plug in’ to the same dream space and fight in gravity defying environments. Inception at times feels like a pure heist movie in the vein of Ocean’s Eleven, or with an espionage twist à la Mission: Impossible. The shoot-out on the streets of Yusuf’s (Dileep Rao) dream is highly reminiscent of Heat (unsurprising given Nolan’s openness about sighting Michael Mann as an influence on The Dark Knight). The chase scene in Mombasa recalls The Bourne Ultimatum’s Tangier based segment. Tangiers actually stood in for Mombasa as a filming location in Inception. The opening of the film in Saito’s dream world is very similar to Rhas Al Ghul’s mountain side lair in Batman Begins, and the room in which Robert Fischer approaches his dying father in Eame’s dream has an air of the design of 2001: A Space Odyssey (another of Christopher Nolan’s favourite films apparently). These examples are just a few of the many similar references throughout the film.\n\nThe fact that Nolan’s film does not feel like a patchwork of the best sequences of other people’s films is a testament to his skill as a filmmaker and his approach to referencing which acts in the service of his film rather than being plagiaristic or gratuitous.\n\nIn thinking of how the film is original, critics have tended to focus on how Inception problematizes our knowledge of what is real and what is a dream. Whilst this intellectual investigation may in itself be philosophically worthy, Inception does not seem at first sight to add a lot more to this notion that has not already been done before in numerous other big budget films such as Total Recall, Vanilla Sky, The Matrix, et al.\n\nWhat I think is original about Inception is rather its integration of the psychoanalytic process into the very fabric of the narrative. There have been a number of films in which psychoanalysis is used as central to character development, Ordinary People or Good Will Hunting for example, and many more that explore psychoanalytic themes or which lend themselves highly to psychoanalytic interpretation (Vertigo, Psycho, Eyes Wide Shut, to name just a few). Inception does something different , however, which I will address by invoking some of the fundamental concepts of psychoanalysis.\n\n(1)At its core psychoanalysis posits the notion that all of us have a part of our mind which is unconscious whose contents are unknown in any explicit sense to us. The unconscious is made up of feelings and desires, some of which we may never have been aware of and others which we have repressed as either a defence mechanism or for purposes of social compliance. The unconscious mind of the individual is a mass of contradictions and by definition remains uncontrolled and unordered.\n\nInception takes as a given the existence of the uncontrolled unconscious world of the subject which is best exemplified by the scene in which Ariadne and Cobb navigate through his dream world and he cannot prevent aspects of his own mind from attacking her (culminating in Mal stabbing her) despite his conscious desire to prevent this.\n\n(2)Psychoanalytic theory argues that during sleep the barrier weakens and the unconscious bubbles out, albeit often in disguised form. “A dream is recognised as a form of expression of impulses which are under pressure of resistance during the day but which have been able to find reinforcement during the night.” As such, elements of our repressed feelings and wishes reveal themselves, now only partly concealed, in our dreams.\n\nWe see this notion very early on in Inception when Mal, who we find out to be dead in the real world and just a representation in Cobb’s subconscious, enters into the shared dream world in which Cobb, who cannot prevent her appearance, and team are trying to conduct an extraction from Saito’s mind, much to the annoyance and subsequent endangerment of Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).\n\n(3)Another foundation of psychoanalytic thought is the overwhelming significance of the child’s relationship with its parents. These primal relationships are burdened with largely unconscious problems which in turn affect all subsequent relationships with everyone the individual encounters.\n\nIn the film, when brainstorming as to how to execute the Inception of a business strategy into the mind of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the team soon agree that this can only be done by tampering with the unconscious relationship with the father, as this will be at the cornerstone of the subject’s sense of self identification.\n\n(4)The unconscious self has a huge impact on how we interact with the world and with others. Typically it has a more powerful effect on how we react to people and how we feel about our relationships with others than our actual conscious selves. “The unconscious must be assumed to be the general basis of psychical life. The unconscious is the larger sphere, which includes within it the smaller sphere of consciousness.” Neurosis and psychosis are expressions of the dominance of the unconscious in our lives. These conditions can only be significantly improved by identifying their unconscious causes and by the process of uncovering and understanding them. To a large extent this is exactly what psychoanalysts do. They help their patients by employing techniques to facilitate this self realisation process.\n\nThis seems to me to be clearly the emotional core of Inception. Cobb is unable to function effectively in the real world, even from a practical perspective, in that his job is negatively affected and impacted, until he can delve into his own unconscious and reconcile himself with his feelings and memories of his deceased wife. These feelings include disappointment with her and guilt for his complicity in her being damaged mentally and emotionally. His uncovering of all this then allows him to return to the world cured of his neurosis and able to re-engage in a meaningful relationship with his (and her) children again. The fact that the practical barriers to him seeing his family are removed simultaneously is cleverly interwoven by Nolan as the emotional narrative (Cobb’s self reconciliation) and functional narrative (the corporate espionage heist which includes Saito providing the necessary authority for Cobb to re-enter the country on successful execution of the inception) run in tandem, culminate and merge together. This process of two seemingly unrelated concepts being brought together to create shared meaning is, Freud tells us, one of the aspects of dream creation and furthermore, if dream world and the real world are confused with each other, the “real and imaginary events appear in dreams…as of equal validity.”\n\n(5)Psychoanalytic theory has also provided us with important insights into human fantasies (most notoriously and controversially the Oedipal fantasy). This does not necessarily refer to fantasies as we might usually think of them as more or less conscious constructions, but rather addresses fantasies which are more unconscious, which are intertwined with our view of ourselves and the world and, crucially, which we do not recognise as fantasies. The psychological pull of the fantasy is all the greater when we perceive it as simple reality.\n\nInception explicitly discusses the desire to live in the fantasy world and the simultaneous rejection that the fantasy is not reality. Think of the room full of dreamers which Cobb and team come across in Mombasa, who yearn so desperately for the fantasy world that it has become their ‘real’ world. Actual reality is the nightmare they want to escape. Here, the film comes close to exploring Jungian ideas of collective unconscious as Juan Galis-Menendes notes. More central to the film even than this is Mal who yearned so badly for the fantasy that she refused to believe real life was not a dream and killed herself in order to return to this reality which never existed other than in her shared unconscious with Cobb. Cobb too is tempted by the fantasy to return to a life with his wife which can exist only in his dreams. The film charts the emergence of his psychological maturity in which he is able to recognise it for what it is.\n\nInception is at its core the symbolic rendering of the psychoanalytic process through the representation of the dream world, which in a manifest form, functions as the narrative of the text and is the very architecture and location of the world(s) Nolan creates. It turns psychoanalytic ideas into a tangible narrative in order to explore them in a new way. In doing this it loses a good degree of the nuance, complexity and psychologically challenging aspects of psychoanalytic theory, but nevertheless Nolan produces a rather compelling case for the concepts of Freudian theory via such a creative, clever and ambitious work.\n\nIn terms of functional narrative, like Memento, Inception suffers from being a bit too obscure and clever for its own good/sake. It wraps itself in knots and leaves much unexplained, leaving audiences eager to unravel the plot. This is a never ending task and effectively amounts to the equivalent of a game of Sudoku, a bit of a workout for the brain, but one which is ultimately an exercise lacking meaning. However, as I have attempted to argue, Inception has a greater payoff than Memento for those wanting to engage with it as a more serious work.\n\nUnderstanding important aspects of the human condition often involves grappling with ideas which are obscure and ambiguous. This can lead to obscurity masquerading as intellectualism. I would argue that obscurity and ambiguity are not valuable in and of themselves. They are valuable only when they help us to understand the nuances of reality. I initially interpreted the final shot of Inception as a pretty meaningless and somewhat clichéd touch designed and employed to keep the eager Sudoku players ever guessing and unravelling the intentionally obscure. Indeed, this final shot of the film is not the first time we are given visual reasons to question whether we are watching reality or not. The overhead shot of Cobb running away from his pursuers in Mombasa creates the very maze/labyrinth that he had Ariadne draw for him in training for dream architecture creation. In the same chase he must squeeze through a narrowing wall, clearly a visualisation of the stuff nightmares are made of. However, I have come to appreciate the note on which the film finishes, not because I think it is important to wonder whether Cobb was actually still in a dream at the end but rather because it addresses the limitations of human perception in which our fantasies colour our perception of everything. The human condition is such that we are imprisoned in our subjective selves. We are destined never to know reality as it simply is, but only as we perceive it. As our perceptions are soaked with our own theories and fantasies, determining absolute reality will forever be beyond our grasp. Separating dream, or fantasy, from reality is in fact not so easy as it might at first appear. Indeed what is this last shot other than the dream (Cobb’s wish to see his children again) becoming reality? The two worlds of fantasy and reality have coalesced. Indeed, for the individual, they are never really fully separate.\n\nIt is genuinely difficult to make a film (or indeed write a song or paint a picture) in which important intellectual issues are addressed and make it have a positive message. Most works of art that are genuinely thoughtful, demanding and revealing of the human condition are not upbeat. Intellectual import and insight is more often than not synonymous with poignancy and melancholy. What is upbeat is usually superficial. It is for this reason that what I consider to be the very best films are often not my favourites in the usual sense of the word in that I do not have a desire to re-watch and re-experience them regularly. Nolan works a bit of magic with Inception, creating the dream blockbuster – it manages to be fantasy fulfilment for our less discerning selves; it has a creative and thoughtful examination of psychological elements of the human condition for our more critical and mature selves; and it executes an emotionally satisfying and, crucially, positive storyline.\n\nA pleasure then, and not even a guilty one.\n\n6. Is it possible to over think the psychology of the film Inception?\n\nCobb: “I will split up my father’s empire.” Now, this is obviously an idea that Robert himself would choose to reject. Which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious. Subconscious is motivated by emotion, right? Not reason. We need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept.\n\nArthur: How do you translate a business strategy into an emotion?\n\nCobb: That’s what we’re here to figure out, right? Now, Robert’s relationship with his father is stressed, to say the least.\n\nEames: Well, can we run with that? We could suggest to him breaking up his father’s company as a “screw-you” to the old man.\n\nCobb: No, ’cause I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time. We all yearn for reconciliation, for catharsis. We need Robert Fischer to have a positive emotional reaction to all this.\n\nEames: Alright, we’ll try this, umm… “My father accepts that I want to create for myself, not follow in his footsteps.”\n\nCobb: That might work.\n\nArthur: Might? We’re gonna need to do a little better than ‘might’.\n\nEames: Oh, thank you for your contribution, Arthur.\n\nArthur: Forgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames.\n\n[Eames appears confused at the word]\n\nArthur: Specificity?\n\nCobb’s Law: As the length of an article about the movie ‘Inception’ increases, so does the likelihood that the article will conclude with the idea that somebody besides Cobb performed an inception on somebody else. Corollary: Theories about the plot will fill both somebodies with a character; discussions of the film’s quality will fill the former with “Christopher Nolan” and the latter with “you, the audience”.\n\nThese rules were outlined on Overthinking It by commenter Kyu, and I think they’re right on. Almost every article I’ve read about Inception has made some mention of metatextual elements of the film—that the “constructed dreams” of the film are very similar to short movies; that an Architect is similar in job description to a film director; that Fischer, our lovable dupe, may easily be considered a stand-in for the easily-duped audience. My favorite article on this subject is Sam Adams’s on salon.com. Check it out, if you have time. This article implies, like most of the others on the subject, that Chris Nolan is the Architect, and he’s performing an inception on us.\n\nIt’s a fun reading of the film, this one. Fun, yes… but completely wrong. Call me a contrarian if you’d like, but it seems to me that if the film is performing an inception on anyone, it’s doing it to Chris Nolan. That’s right: Nolan himself is the Architect and his own target.\n\nThinking of Inception is making me feel overly methodical, so here’s how this piece is going to be laid out:\n\nStage 1: Prove that Inception is a movie about movie-making.\n\nStage 2: Prove that Inception either was not designed to “incept” the audience, or, if it was, the inception was a failure.\n\nStage 3: Prove that Chris Nolan performed an inception on himself, and that this movie was partially about how difficult but necessary it is for artists to purge their own demons through their art.\n\nStage 4: LIMBO!\n\nSo, let’s start with level one.\n\nBURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR\n\nThesis 1: Inception is a movie about making movies.\n\nMany reviews of and articles about Inception have made this claim, and for good reason. Inception is about people who make dreams—no, scratch that; it’s about people who are really good at manipulating people’s emotions by creating imaginary worlds. In other words, film directors. Like directors, Cobb and his crew basically ignore the senses of touch, smell, and taste, focusing only on recreating visual and aural elements. They work overtime to disguise the fact that the worlds they create are finite sets in a mental studio lot. When they need to switch scenes, they do so with obvious musical cues. To ensure that the emotional manipulation of the audience goes smoothly, they cast the best actors for their most important roles.\n\nEven though the characters in Inception seem to be unaware of film history, Nolan makes obvious the fact that his film is about films: other people’s films. He wears his influences on his sleeve: the plot is lovingly ripped off every heist movie ever made (with undertones of Hitchcock added in for extra spice). Nolan cast Juno to play Ariadne and (purposefully or not) put Marion Cotillard on screen while playing Edith Piaf’s “Non, je ne regrette rien.” Ken Watanabe, most famous in the U.S. for his turn inThe Last Samurai, is introduced in an old-tyme Japanese manor in the dress of a feudal daimyo.\n\nAt the same time, Nolan references his own movies: His protagonist is named Cobb, the name of the protagonist of his first movie, Following. Purposefully or not, Inception’s chase scenes recall chase scenes from The Dark Knight. Level three of Fischer’s dream strongly recalls the snow-covered League of Shadows base in Batman Begins. And so on.\n\nIf you need more convincing, read basically any article on the Internet about Inception.The salon.com piece is a good start. Inception is a movie based on other movies that focuses on the theme of movie-making.\n\nThesis 2: If Inception was designed to plant an idea in the audience’s head, it was a failure.\n\nOnce a film critic has decided that Inception is a movie about making movies, it generally takes him or her another paragraph to decide that the whole film is an attempt by Nolan (the Architect) to plant an idea (perform an inception) on the audience.\n\nOkay. If that’s the case, what’s the idea he’s planting in our heads?\n\nI can’t figure that one out. Is the ultimate moral of Inception that movies and dreams are similar in various ways? But that can’t be right. According to Cobb’s exposition throughout the film, an inception is successful when the dream-trapped target adopts an idea from an external source as his own and then—here’s the important part—changes his or her behavior based on that idea. In other words, a proper inception affects the target’s behavior, not just his or her thoughts. Will knowing that movies and dreams are similar affect your behavior in any way? I somehow doubt it.\n\nMaybe the goal of the film was to convince the audience to let go of their emotional baggage (daddy issues; dead wife issues) and move on. If so, the movie was a failure to me, seeing as I have neither daddy issues or dead wife issues. Anyway, according to Cobb, the best way to accomplish an inception is to make the target feel a deep emotion at the end of the inception—ideally, a deeply positive emotion. If Nolan wanted to plant in our heads the idea that we, like Fischer and Cobb, need to let go of our emotional baggage, then Fischer’s dream-reunion with his dad and Cobb’s reunion with his kids would have had to be much more emotionally-affecting than they actually were. For the movie to properly “incept” us, at the end of the movie, we would have to feel a deeply positive emotion. However, Fischer’s reunion with his dad didn’t tug audiences’ heartstrings, because who the hell would care about what happens to Fischer? He’s not a main character. We only care whether or not Cobb and his crew accomplish their mission. As for Cobb’s happy ending, it only would have worked as an inception had Nolan played up the sentimentality at the very end of the film. Instead, while Cobb is tearfully hugging his kids, the camera moves away from them and focuses on Cobb’s ever-spinning top totem. Nolan is basically saying here, “Who cares about what happened to Cobb! Focus on the logic puzzle that is my movie!” In short, Nolan undercuts the emotion of Cobb’s happy ending with a standard “…Or is it?”\n\nCobb and Nolan are right on the money, I think, when they explain how filmic inceptions work. Personally, when I think of the movies that have changed my behavior, I think of movies like Ikiru, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Twelve Angry Men, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly… films that climax with a deep and mostly positive emotion. Inception cannot be mentioned in the same breath with these classic films, because it’s a different kind of movie. Inception falls into the category I like to call “Rubix Cube Films.” These films are fun, colorful, puzzling, sometimes frustrating, and ultimately meaningless. No one ever cries while playing with a Rubix cube.\n\nCritics seem to agree with my reaction. The positive reviews for Inception focused mostly on its ingenious plot and mind-bending visuals. The few negative reviews focused on the very same elements, saying that the film was too logical and that the visuals were not mind-bending enough. I don’t recall one critic saying that the film moved him with any positive emotion. It’s just not that kind of movie. And if Inception isn’t that kind of movie, it can’t be incepting the audience.\n\nThesis 3: Nolan was not trying to perform an inception on the audience. He was trying to perform an inception on himself.\n\nThis thesis is the hardest to prove, but I’m sure going to try.\n\nLet’s start with this question: If Nolan wasn’t trying to plant an idea in the heads of the audience, then who was he trying to perform an inception on? In my mind, the only possible answer is Chris Nolan. If you make a movie that does not and cannot have an effect on an audience, then either you’re a hack who is only trying to make money, or you’re making a movie for yourself. Because I like Chris Nolan’s movies and find them too clever to be mere hackery, I’m going to have to assume the latter. Nolan made a movie that is more for himself than for audiences. Like Cobb, he is both the Architect and ultimate target of his own inception.\n\nConsider Cobb’s lesson to Ariadne in act one of the film. Cobb shows her an image that looks something like this:\n\nAnyway, the image is of an autocatalytic cycle. Cobb tells Ariadne that this is how dreaming works. The dreamer creates the world and simultaneously lives in it. The dreamer’s subconscious also creates characters to inhabit this dream world. As the dreamer moves forward in the world, he or she continues creating the world using his or her imagination.\n\nWhen I saw this image in Inception and heard Cobb’s explanation, I thought, “That’s what dreaming is like, yes—but it’s more what writing is like.” Full disclosure: In my free time, I try to write fiction. If I were one of OTI’s better, more educated writers, I’d talk to you about the history of psychology, of the studies that prove writing can and does as therapy, of Umberto Eco’s theories of simulacra. Today, I’m not going to do that. I’m going to talk to you about my own experience as a writer.\n\nIf you’re anything like me, here’s what happens when you try to write a fictional story. First, you try to build a fictional universe in a methodical fashion. You write outlines\n\nyou mentally cast people you know to play the characters,\n\nyou come up with a good theme and an effective ending, and sometimes you even get your friends to troubleshoot the plot,\n\nand eventually you’ve been working on your outline for so long that you forget what the real world looks like:\n\nAnd here’s the worst part: Ultimately, all this planning is for naught. Really. It’s almost completely worthless. Because once you start writing—once you enter the dream—all bets are off. Your subconscious starts fucking with you.\n\nOut of nowhere, a random train of thought infects and then wrecks your carefully-plotted first act.\n\nYour characters start acting like they want to act, not the way you want them to act. It turns your whole story upside down.\n\nAnd when you’re finally done writing the damn thing, you find that the clever theme you had outlined has turned into a different theme—a more realistic theme—a difficult theme that hurts you to hear, because it’s far more true… Your old theme was a moral, an Aesop, a simple idea meant to affect the behavior of your readers. Now you find that you’ve accidentally written around a new theme, a theme from your own subconscious, a theme will make you, the writer, act differently…\n\nI’ve heard this story over and over again from other writers. You try to write something to affect your audiences, and then your subconscious and the characters it created end up writing something completely different. I think Nolan works this way, too. Just look at his movies. No matter what creative premises and plots he comes up with, all of his movies ultimately turn out the same. The stories are usually metatextual and told out of chronological order. His heroes tend to be artists or artist stand-ins, and they are all psychologically wounded by something in their pasts. At the start of each film, the hero seems to be fairly logical, but his logic fails when pitted against a psychotic and manipulative villain. Cobb’s Mal—a.k.a. Nolan’s Jungian Shadow, the yang to his yin—always finds her way into his plots, and she almost always dies to move the plot along. (See Belinkie’s recent article for details.) As for the rest of the characters, who cares? However they were originally conceived, they all eventually become two-dimensional robots meant to help the protagonist solve the movie and his problems.\n\nInception, then, is Nolan’s most self-aware piece, because here he finally admits that he keeps writing the same movie over and over again. Here, through the character of Cobb, Nolan admits that he is the Architect who can’t keep his own ghosts out of his art.\n\nIf Nolan has made a movie about himself as a filmmaker, then what lessons does he learn about himself? If Cobb is a representation of Nolan, then we must figure out what Cobb learns throughout the film:\n\nCobb’s First Lesson: The dark parts of my mind will continue to infect my art unless I plunge deep into my subconscious and face them directly.\n\nCobb’s Second Lesson: The female character I keep seeing over and over in my work is not real. She is a false image of myself, of my fears and my regrets. I must let go of them.\n\nCobb’s Third Lesson: The reason I feel disconnected from the real world and my family is that I analyze them too much. If I stop caring whether or not my world, family, and emotions are real, they will seem realer, and I will be happy.\n\nThese are the ideas that Nolan learns though his avatar (Cobb). If his inception of himself was successful, we can expect that his next film will\n\neither be much more emotional and honest (because Nolan has decided that he still needs to face the dark elements of his subconscious) or much more logical and playful (because Nolan has finally managed to purge the dark craziness from his work);\n\nlack a symbolic Mal character, instead featuring a three-dimensional female character who is not killed off to keep the plot moving;\n\nfeature more realistic themes and characters in general, and will possibly focus more on Nolan’s children and his relationship with them.\n\n…OR WILL IT?????\n\n[burrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr]\n\n7. What if Inception were analyzed by dream experts?\n\nYusuf: Brain function in the dream will be about twenty times to normal. When you enter a dream within that dream, the effect is compounded: it’s three dreams, that’s ten hours times twen…\n\nEames: I’m sorry, uh, maths was never my strong subject. How much time is that?\n\nCobb: It’s a week the first level down. Six months the second level down, and… the third level…\n\nAriadne: …is ten years! Who would wanna be stuck in a dream for ten years?\n\nYusuf: Depends on the dream.\n\nWhen Christopher Nolan first announced that he was making a movie that took place “within the architecture of the mind,” I got nervous, really nervous. This wasn’t because it meant that I would soon have to think at the multiplex, but because I had been working on a book of my own for the past three years that dealt with a universe within the mind, and I thought, uh oh, he’s going to steal my thunder.\n\nWell, Inception came out this past weekend and it couldn’t have been farther from what my book is about. But in my boning up on dreams, I studied a great deal of the Swiss psychiatrist, Carl Jung, who is arguably most famous for his work on dream analysis, with the collective unconscious and archetypes being two of his most studied discussions. Now, I’m not claiming to be an expert in Jungian concepts such as the self or the collective unconscious (And I’ll even direct you to two links that might describe it better than I can: here and here) but in a nutshell, Jungian Archetypes are basically the rawest, innermost characteristics of ourselves that exist within everybody at the deepest level of the collective unconscious, which is basically the deepest realm within ourselves.\n\nSPOILER WARNING: What follows should only be viewed by people who have already seen Inception. It contains heavy, critical spoilers which will impact your viewing of the film. If you haven’t seen Inception yet, stop reading and don’t come back until you do.\n\nAnd in watching Inception, I think I definitely saw something of Jungian archetypes in all of the characters who interact with Leonardo DiCaprio’s, Dom Cobb, in the movie. So much so, in fact, that I actually think ::Spoiler alert:: that the entire film might actually just be Dom Cobb’s dream and that all of the main characters in it were just different segments of himself that had to concoct an elaborate mission just so he could reach some level of catharsis within himself. When the mission was completed, he was finally able to confront his demons and he was granted the clarity to finally see his children’s faces in the end because his guilt had finally been resolved amongst his archetypes. I know, I know, it’s a pretty crazy theory and I’m sure you’ll hear even crazier ones in the weeks that follow, but just hear me out for a little bit and maybe you’ll see where I’m coming from with this. But for a moment, I’m going to attempt to examine the characters of Inception using the methods of dream experts. Here’s what I think they’d have to say.\n\nMal/The Shade as The Shadow Archetype\n\nOne of Jung’s most prominent archetypes is the shadow, which is mostly the darker side of oneself projected into an entity. This archetype can be represented as many different figures, from people to animals that might have haunted you in your childhood. The way archetypes work is like this: they aren’t really the shape that you see but more a feeling or emotion that is transformed into an entity that we can relate to, and the shadow archetype represents the worst parts of ourselves and the evil that lurks within us. So, if you’re still following me here, then you’ll know that Mal is certainly the evil that lurks within Dom. I mean, it’s even in her name, (Mal in Latin means evil, after all).\n\nBut let’s look even deeper. As we know, Mal is already dead by the first time we see her in Saito’s dream on the Shinkansen. She killed herself after she thought that limbo was still reality and that the world she lived in was all a lie. As we know, she only thinks this because Dom Cobb performed Inception on her and he feels that he is the cause of her death, so his dark side is manifested in Mal, who might as well just be a literal shadow because she follows him everywhere he goes, much like a shadow would. This leads to disastrous results, like in the form of a freight train through the streets or as an assassin in the snow. Mal in every way is the darker side of Cobb that he can’t contain, and that’s what makes her such a threat, because deep down, he knows that she’s really the worst side of himself, and everything she does affects the rest of his innermost archetypes.\n\nArthur/The Point Man as The Hero Archetype\n\nLet’s face it, even though Dom Cobb is the star of the show, he’s hardly the hero. He’s more like a broken down sad sack dealing with shameful emotional issues caused by his dominant shadow (See above). But Arthur, who is willing to take on an onslaught of bad guys in a constantly shifting hallway so his friends can enter into a deeper dream state, is pure hero material, especially when he runs the risk of being “killed” and sent to limbo in such a heavily sedated state.\n\nArthur is everything Dom wishes he could be but can’t because he has so many ghosts following him around. He gets to kiss the girl, save the day (Notice that he’s one of the first ones to wake up in the submerged car and pull the others to safety), and doesn’t fail in his mission to lead the bad guys away from his friends. While Dom, on the other hand, fails in every way, even allowing his shadow/Mal to “kill” Fischer Jr. from behind, which compromises the entire mission. So, if we’re keeping track of our Archetype discussion, that would mean that Arthur is also Dom, but the part of him that is brave and courageous and willing to put his life on the line for his friends. He doesn’t have any excess baggage. He’s just all business, and all kickass.\n\nSaito/The Tourist as the Father Archetype\n\nThe father archetype is a very strong figure in the human psyche, as it’s one that gets what it wants and has a great deal of control in the person he inhabits. And in every way, that’s what Saito is, acting almost as a dues ex machina by the end of the film with his ability to literally overturn the law so that Dom can return to America. Saito would be the side of Dom’s character that would be authoritative and demanding. In other words, he would be the boss when it got right down to things. We already see that Dom’s not the boss of his own team as his second architect doesn’t even follow his instructions when he tells her not to go deeper into his mind. She does just that and sees what Mal is really capable of doing within him. So in that way, Dom has very little control over his circumstances, while Saito is exactly the opposite—he gets what he wants and knows how to get it.\n\nNote that not only did he convince Dom to plant inception in a business competitor’s mind, but he also got to tag along with the others as a tourist, which is highly dangerous and a definite risk factor in a mission like this. Saito gets whatever he wants. So is it any wonder why he gets shot so early in the mission? Dom can’t deal with a figure like that right now within himself, as he has his own problems to deal with. If anything, he needs a strongly based mother archetype, one who will take care of him and not demand too much out of him. Unfortunately, there isn’t one to be found in this movie, making his catharsis that much harder.\n\nEames/The Forger as The Trickster Archetype\n\nThe Trickster Archetype is deceptive and shady, and Eames is the shadiest of them all. Working as a forger in reality and as a shape shifter in the dream world (even switching genders at one point to lead the target off-guard, which is VERY Trickster-esque), Eames is the side of Dom that can still laugh at itself and crack a smile, but also the great deceiver that can’t tell reality from a dream. The Trickster is very prominent in the film in that Dom lies to not only his team but also himself, believing that he has everything under control when he knows deep down that he’s a complete and utter mess.\n\nIt’s in Eames’ dream in the snow fortress that Dom is truly confronted with his shadow, and it’s at that point that he knows that he can’t lie to himself anymore. The Trickster proves it to him by putting his shadow front and center there for him. And with his shadow “killing” Fischer, she is also killing the child within him (More on that in a second).\n\nRobert Fischer Jr./The Mark as The Child Archetype\n\nRobert Fischer Jr. just wants acceptance from his father, and like the child archetype, he is the side of Dom who desires to be innocent again. Note that when Fischer’s safe opens, he pulls out the pinwheel that he had in the picture with his dad. This side of Dom is very tricky to discuss as Dom actually deceives the child within him by lying to Fischer at the bar and claiming that the images he sees are really trying to kill him when their purpose is to actually save him from dream thieves, Dom being one of them.\n\nThis leads me to believe that Dom is trying to move on from the helpless side of himself by this part in the movie and doesn’t want that innocence to hold back. He wants to be more like the father archetype and have control. But Dom can’t reach catharsis by subduing his archetypes, and by bringing Fischer back from the dead in the end, it allows him to open his safe, which I definitely think is tantamount to Dom’s rebirth, which is a part of what the child archetype represents within the dreamer, a new beginning. So yeah, it’s some pretty heady stuff.\n\nAriadne/The Architect as The Anima Archetype\n\nThe Anima is the feminine side within a male (Whereas, the animus, would be the male side within a female) and she represents who a male truly is rather than who he presents himself as in reality, and in many ways, what that’s what Ariadne represents for Dom. Out of all the other characters in the movie, she’s the closest to being who he really is—note, all of the details he tells her are basically the same details he’s telling us, too, with the audience being a part of who he is, as well, being that we’re living inside his head while we watch the movie—and she’s also an architect, which Dom once was too before his shadow became overbearing.\n\nThink about it, it’s Ariadne who goes with him into limbo when everyone else has to stay behind. She’s the one who tries to pull him away from his darker side and get him to move on so he can be himself again. She’s basically a young Cobb with a vagina. I don’t know how else to explain it.\n\nMiles/The Mentor as The Wise Old Man Archetype\n\nMiles, Dom’s father-in-law, is the wise old man within himself, and believe it or not, this might be the most complex archetype of all to explain. This is almost a paradox of sorts really (Like those twisting stairs in the movie), in that he is both knowledge incarnate, but also the teacher within himself that is able to take in his anima as a student. I don’t know. I really can’t wrap my head around this one. Maybe you can do a better job.\n\nYusef/The Chemist as The Self\n\nThe self represents both the conscious and the unconscious worlds within oneself, and that’s what Yusef is in this mission for Dom. He is both the link to reality and the also harbinger into the dream world. By being the initial dream that his team enters within, believe it or not, I think Yusef might be the closest to who Dom really is as an individual by having all of these archetypes swimming inside himself. Remember, Yusef is the only other one who knows about Limbo on the onset, as Dom must have been dabbling with chemicals himself to get to that sort of state with his wife. So it is in Yusef that we have the whole to the other segmented sections of Dom, and by allowing his other archetypes to sink deep within him, he is allowing them to all come to grips with each other.\n\nWhoo, that was a lot of mental calisthenics right there. What do you think? Can you piece the puzzle together any better?\n\n8. What is the labyrinth of the film Inception?\n\nAriadne: Why are they all looking at me?\n\nCobb: Because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world. The more you change things, the quicker the projections start to converge on you.\n\nAriadne: Converge?\n\nCobb: It’s the foreign nature of the dreamer. They attack like white blood cells fighting an infection.\n\nAriadne: They’re going to attack us?\n\nCobb: No. Just you.\n\nThe labyrinth of Inception\n\nWhen you have a hammer, everything can look like a nail and people have been banging the shit out of Inception. The sci-fi movie of the year has attracted numerous ‘neuroscience of Inception’ reviews despite the fact that the film has little to say about the brain and is clearly more inspired by the psychological theories of Carl Jung than by neurobiology.\n\nIt’s easy to why the movie has attracted neuroscience fans, including a brain-based review in this week’s Nature. It’s a science fiction film, the dream entry device presumably alters the brain, and director Christopher Nolan’s previous film Memento was carefully drawn from a detailed reading of the science of brain injury and memory loss.\n\nInception itself, however, contains so little direct reference to the brain (I counted about three lines) that you have to do some pretty flexible interpretation to draw firm parallels with brain science. Perhaps, most tellingly, for a film supposedly about neuroscience, the dream entry devices don’t even connect to the brain and nothing is made of how they achieve their interface.\n\nBut for those familiar with the theories of Carl Jung, the psychoanalyst and dissenter from Freud’s circle, the film is rich with both implicit and explicit references to his work.\n\nAs with all psychoanalysts, Jung was concerned with the subconscious mind and believed that it contains powerful emotional processes that, when malformed or disturbed, can break through and cause immense distress to our conscious lives. To protect us, the subconscious tries to hide these forces behind symbols, which appear, most vividly, in dreams.\n\nThis is why Freud called dreams “the royal road to the unconscious” and Jung’s work is also based on this core assumption.\n\nSimilarly, in Inception, dreams are a way of accessing the subconscious of the dreamer, to the point where they can be used to steal secrets. This dream invasion work is not easy, of course, primarily because the subconscious mind attempts to defend against invaders (a defense mechanism in psychoanalytic terms) and the dreamspace needs to be explored and interpreted by the invaders to get to the secret itself.\n\nThis is not the only challenge, as other people in the dream are projections of the dreamer’s subconscious where, in line with the definition from psychoanalysis, personal feelings are perceived as residing in other people.\n\nIn the film, the young architect, Ariadne is hired to build dreams in the form of mazes, and the labyrinth forms one of the central symbols in the film (the name, Ariadne, by the way, comes from the Greek legend where she leads Theseus out of the Minotaur’s labyrinth – Jung referred to being lost in life as ‘losing the Ariadne thread’).\n\nIn Jungian psychology the labyrinth is one of the most powerful symbols of the subconscious. In his book ‘Man and His Symbols’, he explains its meaning:\n\n“The maze of strange passages, chambers, and unlocked exits in the cellar recalls the old Egyptian representation of the underworld, which is a well-known symbol of the unconscious with its abilities. It also shows how one is “open” to other influences in one’s unconscious shadow side and how uncanny and alien elements can break in.”\n\nAriadne is hired because Don Cobb can no longer create dreams, owing to the fact that the subconscious representation of his ex-wife, who killed herself due to Cobb’s dream work, appears and attempts to violently stop him. Cobb names her his ‘shade’, directly referencing the Jungian concept of the shadow where we are haunted by the parts of ourselves which we are most ashamed and which we most try to repress.\n\nWhile Cobb’s main objective is to get back to his children, his main challenge is to overcome his shadow that causes conflicts in his subconscious. Normally, if you wrote a sentence like that about a film you would be using a Jungian interpretation, but in the case of Inception this is also the literal state of affairs.\n\nThis is not the only psychological journey that happens in the film, as Cobb’s journey is paralleled by that of Robert Fischer, the target of the dream invaders. Fischer’s father is dying leaving both the state of the family corporation and the father-son relationship unresolved.\n\nThe situation is a representation of the Arthurian grail legend, the Fisher King. In the tale, the king responsible for protecting the Holy Grail is wounded and his kingdom decays in parallel to his damaged body. The knight Perceval learns he could heal the king and his kingdom by asking the right questions.\n\nNot coincidentally, Jung was intensely interested in the Grail legend throughout his life as he thought it was one of the best representation of the ‘collective unconscious‘ where common psychological themes of humanity appear as what he called ‘archetypes‘.\n\nHis wife, Emma Jung, a psychoanalyst in her own right, wrote a book on the psychological meaning of the legend drawn from Carl Jung’s theories and cited the key theme of the tale to be ‘individuation‘, that is the healthy development of ourselves as distinct individuals by resolving our relationships with those around us and the conflicts within us.\n\nIn Inception, Robert Fischer’s journey ends with him resolving his relationship with his wounded father and saving his ‘kingdom’ by learning that he had always wanted him to be his own man and not try and be his father – which, as we learn at the end – is at the core of his subconscious. Again, this is not an interpretation; it is the literal truth of the film.\n\nThere are lots of other subtle pointers in the film which may or may not be deliberate. Is it a co-incidence that the lead character Don Cobb, shares a name with Stanley Cobb, the person most responsible for introducing Jungian analysis to the United States? Or that Ariadne gets the job by drawing a mandala style maze, a symbol that Jung believed was a representation of the unconscious self? Or that Mal’s madness is portrayed as her subconscious breaking through into reality, in line with Jung’s definition?\n\nRegardless of whether these are subtle hints or not, the film is Jungian at its core, and what is most interesting for me is that Nolan is deploying different theories of the mind as themes in his films. WhileMemento was obviously neuropsychological, Inceptionis clearly Jungian.\n\n9. Could Inception become a reality? Can you discuss how scientist induce lucid dreams by adding current to sleeping people’s brains.\n\nCobb: You create the world of the dream, you bring the subject into that dream, and they fill it with their subconscious.\n\nAriadne: How could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that its reality?\n\nCobb: Well dreams, they feel real while we’re in them, right? It’s only when we wake up that we realize how things are actually strange. Let me ask you a question, you, you never really remember the beginning of a dream do you? You always wind up right in the middle of what’s going on.\n\nAriadne: I guess, yeah.\n\nCobb: So how did we end up here?\n\nAriadne: Well we just came from the a…\n\nCobb: Think about it Ariadne, how did you get here? Where are you right now?\n\nAriadne: We’re dreaming?\n\nCobb: You’re actually in the middle of the workshop right now, sleeping. This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.\n\nInception-style lucid dreams can be induced by applying a specific frequency of electric current to sleepers’ brains, a study has found. Lucid dreams involve a state of heightened awareness that allows the sleeper to recognise the dream and control what happens within it. A similar concept was explored in the hit movie Inception, starring Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nDreams involving a state of heightened awareness were explored in the movie Inception starring Leonardo DiCaprio\n\nPeople who have lucid dreams talk of ‘waking up’ within a dream and being able, for instance, to fly at will or manipulate the imaginary world around them.\n\nIn the new study, researchers tested 27 participants with no previous experience of lucid dreaming over several nights.\n\nAfter three minutes of uninterrupted Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep – the sleep phase when most dreaming occurs – a weak alternating electric current was applied to their scalps. The scientists targeted the frontal and temporal brain regions where high-frequency ‘gamma’ brainwaves had previously been associated with lucid dreaming.\n\nStimulation at a frequency of 40 hertz both raised gamma activity and induced lucid dreaming\n\nA few seconds after the brain stimulation the volunteers were awakened and reported having lucid dreams.\n\nStimulation at a frequency of 40 hertz both raised gamma activity and induced lucid dreaming. It also correlated with specific aspects of lucid dreams, such as insight – realizing you are dreaming – control over the dream plot, and dissociation from the dream’s protagonist.\n\nWriting in the journal Nature Neuroscience, the team led by Dr Ursula Voss, from the JW Goethe- University in Frankfurt, Germany, speculated on the use of lucid dreams to help victims of post- traumatic stress disorder who are plagued by nightmares.\n\n‘Promoting gamma oscillations during REM sleep in post-traumatic stress disorder with re-emerging nightmares might trigger lucid dreaming and eventually enable active changes in dream content,’ said the researchers.\n\nHave you ever had a dream where you were lucid — where you knew that you were dreaming and could somewhat respond accordingly, like in the film “Inception”? Scientists appear to have found a way to bring this induced state of lucid dreaming out of Hollywood and into reality.\n\n“I never thought this would work,” Dr. John Allan Hobson, a psychiatrist and sleep researcher at Harvard University who was involved with the study, told LiveScience. “But it looks like it does.”\n\nTo achieve it, scientists at J.W. Goethe-University Frankfurt in Germany actually wired participants up and zapped their brains while they were sleeping.\n\nAccording to the study published this week in the journal Nature Neuroscience, there is a link between fronto-temporal gamma electroencephalographic activity and conscious awareness in dreams.\n\n“We found that current stimulation in the lower gamma band during REM sleep influences ongoing brain activity and induces self-reflective awareness in dreams,” the authors wrote in the study abstract. “Other stimulation frequencies were not effective, suggesting that higher order consciousness is indeed related to synchronous oscillations around 25 and 40 Hz.”\n\nTo reach these conclusions, the study had 27 volunteers who were not regular lucid dreamers. Researchers outfitted participants’ heads with electrodes that simulated the frontal cortex of the brain, simulating the gamma wave activity previously seen in lucid dreams, Live Sci"
