        "text": "We have survived a lot these last ten years. The burn out of the previous financial crisis, and the impending doom of the next short lined up. The growth of the internet as a means of communication, for better or for worse. Various political backlashes, and the revolts that stacked up against them. The death boom, of all of the famous faces of our time reaching that age. The world has experienced joys and tragedies stronger than ever before, because of our electronic connectivity. You can find out anything virtually right away. You are reading this online, for instance. In a positive light, reach has never been easier. We are midway to the point of singularity, since we act vicariously through our devices so often.\n\nAs per usual, cinema has reflected all of this. With the fears of the world’s demise, we have shared our anxieties with post-apocalyptic adventures. To hoist up the communities that have been shunned for years, we have seen a significant boost in queer cinema, and films that shed light on various cultures. With the 2010’s obsession with nostalgia, we have seen our fair share of genre-bending throwbacks, all in the name of reinventing the past. Lastly, we have been proven time and time again why some filmmakers are just the best at their craft, as they continue their hot streaks for another era. For the most part, the 2010’s loved to break rules, either through ignoring conventionality, or even disregarding the foundations of filmmaking themselves.\n\nNarrowing down this decade’s finest features to one hundred was far from easy. I knew we had a strong era long before I worked on this list, but I had no idea how many of my beloved favourites would be culled for, well, my other favourites I liked a little bit more. The 2010’s embraced a lot of this era’s nightmares with open arms, as if film was the necessity for the voids in our souls during a rough patch in the social age. One hundred films are now presented to you, at your disposal, in one, long, continuous scroll. The hard work of others is incredibly simple to enjoy, and I hope you do just that. Here are the top one hundred films of the 2010’s.\n\nBe sure to check out my other Best 100 lists of every decade here.\n\n92. The Wolf of Wall Street\n\nIt is safe to say that much of these eccentric biopics all stemmed from Martin Scorsese's unreliable narrative memoir. Do any of us like Jordan Belfort by the end of The Wolf of Wall Street? No, but we still get sold on the film the entire time. Why is that? Because we have nothing to lose? Because we have enough distance from a con artist, and his rise-and-fall? Because we can judge all of these shenanigans without taking part in them? We feel no remorse for Belfort or any of his soul sucking minions, and it turns a braggadocios celebration of escapades into a three hour comedy romp. Case in point: watching two grown men fight in slow motion after taking too many quaaludes being the funniest moment of the decade.\n\n91. Lady Bird\n\nGreta Gerwig’s directorial debut is inspired by her own upbringing in Sacramento. Lady Bird operates like its title character: unsure of itself, so it struts through the motions to figure it all out. It zips through a year in the life of Christine (Lady Bird), and winds up wondering where it all went by the time her wish was fulfilled (and she left her hometown). Having declared her mother as her enemy, she realizes very quickly what it means to be on her own, and how much her parents actually care. Lady Bird is rebellious, but it allows a podium for many teenaged youths that are still piecing the rest of their lives together. Gerwig did it for them, and it purposefully feels like a compilation of edits to show how much life a little film can contain.\n\n87. The Irishman\n\nAs Martin Scorsese's final farewell to the gangster genre, The Irishman is more than a few words. Within four hours, the life of a hitman is examined in full effect. Everyone else around him dies or leaves him. He simply cannot depart this world, and is left telling his story in an old age home for the rest of his eternity. Reliving all of your sins again and again, with zero forgiveness, is a deserved curse for a prolific murderer. The fact that Frank Sheeran never progressed further than being a lackey to most of his \"friends\" makes The Irishman even more depressing; all of this was to shield his family, and yet he lost them all.\n\n80. The Lobster\n\nOne of the funniest satires in recent memory, Yorgos Lanthimos’ take on a dramedy romance (considerably) is a baffling riot to behold. Everyone in The Lobster already communicates in an animalistic form, regardless of whether or not they are destined to be turned into creatures to be hunted for sport. I wonder if this is how humans would sound if they were gifted the ability to speak perfectly (and with our current lexicon) very early on in our evolutionary chain. Regardless, The Lobster is beyond wacky, with its random animals milling around (seriously, who would pick an animal like a flamingo when your life is at stake?) and its viciously dark jokes. There wasn’t any film more absurd than The Lobster in the 2010’s, and that’s saying a lot: Yorgos Lanthimos had other films this decade!\n\n71. Before Midnight\n\nIt is almost strange that so many of us take Before Midnight for granted. This is the third film in a series that has taken place over decades, based entirely around the conversations between two people. Maybe none of us bat an eye, because we trust the trio of Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, with their ability to initiate so much life through the experiences that people can share with one another. For the third time in a row, we feel as though we have lived through all of the tribulations that Jesse and Celine discuss, as we ponder how their relationship has made it this far. Before Midnight is cleverly bound together by the filling-in of the gaps many of us have had all these years about this same story. Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke have figured it out, and we’re suckers for the fourth entry (should it ever be released in a few years time).\n\n56. The Shape of Water\n\nI knew after Pan's Labyrinth that Guillermo del Toro was the go-to filmmaker for the crafting of fairy tales meant for adults, that still have the ability to make us feel like children again. The Shape of Water is a fable for a number of marginalized voices: the differently abled, persons of colour, and the LGBTQ community. It's also an homage to the B-movie horror films of the golden era. Putting the two together, and you have a romantic caper involving the cold war, bigoted injustice, and the moments that render us ultra human. In case you want to mock this entry for its romance, congratulations; this is one of at least three entries on my list that involves some sort of fish connection. I dare you to find the other two. For now, I won’t stop singing The Shape of Water’s praises.\n\n55. Carol\n\nIn the middle of an era when huge strides were being made for the LGBTQ community, Todd Haynes took a second to remind us of the distance we have made so far. Upon release, Carol was often compared to The Children's Hour: a well known play that would have been widely available to read or watch during the course of Carol's timeline. Hour never even mentioned lesbianism by name, and the debate was treated like a gigantic secret. Carol dives head first into all of the darkest shadows cast by bigotry in the '50s. It's a much more upfront discussion, and one that still hurts four years later; this can be read as an indication of the unnecessary hell many persecuted people are put through out of hateful prejudice.\n\n50. 127 Hours\n\nDanny Boyle began the 2010’s with his best work of this era. Following his awards season run for Slumdog Millionaire, Boyle delivered a film that was just as emotional. 127 Hours is a film that could only be made by a filmmaker like Boyle, that doesn’t feel confined by conventions. Hearing Aron Ralston's story in such a colourful, minimalist way is exactly how it was meant to be told. Once Ralston’s stuck under the bolder, that’s it. We’re stuck with him too (outside of a few flashbacks and dream sequences). We spend an hour and a half trying to figure this all out. Ralston reminiscing on his life — imagining he is going to die — reminds us all about our own, as if we were in a similar position. We get rewarded with the beautifully triumphant ending, that evokes what an escape of this caliber would absolutely feel like.\n\n49. A Fantastic Woman\n\nA Fantastic Woman is incredibly daring, which is a sad statement to make. In 2017, Sebastián Lelio’s film should not feel as though all of its events are current. Seeing Marina’s rights to visit her lover’s funeral being stripped away from her is depressing enough. Then, the film keeps going, and we continue to watch Marina subsequently be berated, and treated as a non-person because of her gender identity. We have made much progress in regards to transgender acceptance, but A Fantastic Woman is proof that we have a very long way to go. However, with the film’s pure approach to the subject matter, and its featuring of a bright new star in Daniela Vega, A Fantastic Woman as a film is a shining beacon for transgender representation in future motion pictures.\n\n48. Manchester by the Sea\n\nGrief is never easy to deal with, so Kenneth Lonergan gave the old tragedy-comedy genre a try to see if he could make sense of it. Manchester by the Sea is a subtle instance of incorporating both laughs and tears. The humour is dark and manic. The depression is even more hysterical. During times of crises, Sea is that friend who prods you to point out something quirky as a means of distraction. This can be a stretcher not functioning properly, stalling an ambulance from making its trek to a hospital. All of the awkward conversations or sight gags lead up to the uncomfortable confrontations that a divided family must have in order to heal. None of it is easy, but Kenneth Lonergan at least made all of Sea’s emotions unified; it’s a noble feat.\n\n43. Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\n\nThis commentary on the lives of washed up actors is brilliantly executed. The editing to make the majority of the film feel like one long take. The minimal amount of sets. The long monologues. Birdman is Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s creative way of proving Riggan right. His efforts to make a stage play will only result in him turning back to his franchise, special effects, blockbuster roots. He will fail. The film slowly turns into Riggan’s deepest fears; a downward spiral in front of our very eyes. It’s a darkly hilarious failure that we cannot pry our eyes away from. Is it reassuring when Riggan begins to hallucinate his Birdman character’s powers saving him? Is it saddening to know his joy is all a figment of his imagination? I guess it all depends on whether or not you believe the final scene or not.\n\n40. Son of Saul\n\nWhen a character like Saul — a Sonderkommando — is forced to treat the deaths of people from within his own culture, it’s likely that he felt stripped of who he is as a person. Son of Saul is the chance for the title character to reclaim his own life out of the hands of the Nazi superiors at Auschwitz. By vowing to bury the corpse of a young boy who died late after narrowly surviving a gas chamber, Saul will have done something for himself, and to honour a generation that is being mercilessly killed before life has even started for them. The claustrophobically shot journey is dangerous, anxious, and devastating, but every second we get to champion Saul’s quest is a moment that fixes our damaged faith in humanity.\n\n39. Inside Out\n\nIt makes sense to consider Pete Docter’s Pixar opus this highly on a list of this nature. Inside Out is beyond Pixar’s best film of this era. It’s easily debatable that it’s one of the studio’s strongest works to date. The detailing of the inner mind in a way that appeals to children and adults is a feat in its own right. Then comes all of the fantastic little things: an answer to all of the questions we have about how our brains tick. With unforgettably moving sequences, Inside Out seemed like it was going to generate some sort of a Pixar renaissance. In the end, not many animated features even came close to the colourful, beautiful, and emotional journey that Inside Out paints for us. We’ll never listen to our inner voices the same way again.\n\n38. Nightcrawler\n\nWho would have thought that Dan Gilroy’s neo-noir media frenzy would have become even more relevant five years later? Before “fake news” was a coined term, and click bait was completely off the rails, Nightcrawler was simply trying to comment on the use of fear and hate through the to drive the public. Lou is a leech that finds the worst qualities of humanity (likely through his own self reflection) to try and tell stories his own way. He proceeds to get worse and worse, to the point of destroying lives just to instil horror for his own personal gain. At the end of the 2010’s, Nightcrawler feels more relevant than ever, in an internet and media age where absolutely nothing is trustworthy or safe anymore.\n\n35. The Last Black Man in San Francisco\n\nJimmie Fails’ semi-autobiographical screenplay for The Last Black Man in San Francisco begged for him to play his own part. The woes of not being able to move back into a home which was rightfully yours by birthright had to come from the man that lived a similar life. Joe Talbot took the tale up a notch by creating the docufiction: a world that feels like a strange, surreal satire, and yet everything is akin to real life. You will wait for the big twist; a revelation that none of this happened. We never get that wish. We only get the words of a man who has lived through a lot, in a society that is highly unforgiving.\n\n30. The Grand Budapest Hotel\n\nWe don’t have enough silly films full of hijinks anymore. All it took was Wes Anderson’s next dioramic concoction: an ode to early cinema, and the great beyond of human stupidity. The Grand Budapest Hotel boasts an eclectic cast of misfits that all strive for power in some way. Even Zero (whose name is an appropriate symbol for his starting point) wants to be the best lobby boy there is. Hotel is all about literal ups and downs. Elevators take you to your floor. Gondolas work as a meeting point to have private discussions. Ladders take you back to society from your jail cell. Sometimes you own everything, and sometimes you don’t. The entire film is based on brash decisions, and it’s far too much fun to gawk at.\n\n29. Boyhood\n\nIn the five years that have passed since Richard Linklater’s time capsule film Boyhood debuted, we could have been involved in a next chapter in Mason’s life. This twelve year experiment documented pop cultural changes surrounding a child bogged down by problems at home. With Linklater’s fascination with French New Wave in mind, we can spot why Boyhood is so obsessed with the little things to drive a film. Every time I reach Mason’s University drug filled trek, I cannot believe that three hours have zipped by like that. That’s life. Twelve years drip through your hands like grains of sand. When Mason’s mother breaks down after realizing life didn’t have anything left in store for her, that’s when you put two and two together. Boyhood is the happy medium of being everything and nothing. It is life, captured.\n\n14. The Social Network\n\nDavid Fincher's strongest film comes in the form of a heavily manipulated biopic. The Social Network is barely about the start of Facebook anyway; it's safe to admit this nine years later. It's more about connection in a new age, and what that means for human relations. Mark Zuckerberg is turned into a chaser of his own truth, rather than a guy that just felt like taking an idea. For a website that is meant to bring people together, the bulk of Network is made up of bridges being burned. Aaron Sorkin's brilliant screenplay cloaks insecurity in the form of sarcastic jabs, all while people try to protect their own branding. The Social Network is far more of a millennial maelstrom than it is an old hat biopic. Truth smuth. This is a far more meaningful result.\n\n12. It’s Such a Beautiful Day\n\nMany of us grew up on the incredibly viral short Rejected, I'm sure. Don Hertzfeldt became a household name for existential crises in the form of grotesque and random humour. His masterpiece was devised as three shorts that eventually got smushed together into a feature called It's Such a Beautiful Day: the final visions of a brain dying of an unknown illness. No other film has felt more like an internal battle for meaning like this one. The more that Bob loses his grip on reality, the more the funny images become nightmarish. I'd dare say that it's impossible to watch without getting teary eyed to some degree. Considering that the majority of this film was made by one person, I think its safe to crown Hertzfeldt a brilliant artist. His first feature length film is closer to the human experience than most other films by directors with more experience.\n\n10. A Separation\n\nThe ending credits of A Separation suffocate you. Your time runs out. Which parent will you pick? Was two hours really enough to make that choice? Well, the featured child (Termeh) is given a similar decision in this heart pounding familial tragedy by Asghar Farhadi. A film influenced by the 2009 voting crisis in Iran, A Separation involves one particular family affected by the outcome of the fraudulent election. The opening credits show passports being scanned: an introduction to the guardians we will have to decide between, and the brief reason why this marriage cannot work. A mother vows to leave Iran, and her husband feels forced to stay to take care of his ailing father. Both sides snowball into an unstoppable avalanche of bad decisions, exhaustion, and hostility. All of this stems from the fight-or-flight response to a dangerous political move.\n\nA Separation never lets up, and it somehow gets heavier, and heavier, and heavier. Then, we are planted right in the middle of that ending scenario. A Separation never tells you which parent to pick. You have to make sense of this ambiguous finale. The worst part is, “neither parent” is not an option, and you know Termeh is stuck with a guardian that meant well but proved to be dangerous for her. A Separation is more than just a divorce tale. It is the removal of one’s heritage, one’s sanity, and one’s unconditional love, all because of a widespread corruption.\n\n9. Anomalisa\n\nWhen Charlie Kaufman set up a kickstarter account to create a film that studios would refuse to fund, that got the gears of most cinephiles turning. What exactly was he going to come out with? We got that eventual answer: the existential stop-motion puppet show Anomalisa. Kaufman leapfrogged over any budgetary restrictions with some brilliant maneuvering. There are only three voice performers: one of them (Tom Noonan) supplies chatter for every single person on Earth not named Michael (the receiver of this horrible monotony) and Lisa (his gifted angel). There are very few settings: Michael is trapped in a hotel. The lines left on the dolls are not digitally edited: their marionette-like ways only seem to pop more.\n\nAs Michael is permanently stuck in a world where everyone looks and sounds the same, we understand Kaufman’s depictions of mental illness. When Anomalisa begins to get meta (puppets animating inorganically, or even falling apart), that’s when you know Michael’s brain has reached a breaking point. It’s the transformation of Lisa that serves the final stab in the heart: evidence that a carnivorous depression will stop at destroying no one. Anomalisa is an uncomfortable recreation of how life feels when joy is sucked out of every being, but it’s an accurate representation more or less.\n\n8. Black Swan\n\nOn first watch, Darren Aronofsky’s brilliant Black Swan is the psychological thriller of the year. So what? We have a paranoid ballerina that is sheltered by her overbearing mother, and is too much of a perfectionist to inhabit any of her techniques deep down. The world sees her as frigid, and she is as naive as it gets. Then come the super amounts of cliches: the black swan combats the white swan, and ballerina Nina Sayers grows hysterical trying to keep her psyche together. Black Swan is thrilling, that’s for sure. But, that’s not why this film is in the top ten of the decade. It’s the stranglehold it delivers when you feel compelled to revisit it, time and time again.\n\nSuddenly, you begin to wonder how much of the film actually happened at all. Was the entire narrative a hallucination in the eyes of a smothered homebody? The parallels between Black Swan and the actual Swan Lake begin to get stronger and stronger. The film surpasses all of its obvious symbols (left in for first timers) with the sprinkling of minor details, that spin Black Swan into a freak out melodrama that only gets loopier on each visit. Black Swan is deceptively nuanced, to the point of obsessive fixation.\n\n7. The Red Turtle\n\nAnimator Michaël Dudok de Wit was personally commissioned by Studio Ghibli to make a feature film after his short Father and Daughter took the world by storm. Years later, Dudok de Wit returned with an extra long short titled The Red Turtle. Well, it’s actually a feature, but all of its elements imply otherwise. There isn’t a word of dialogue. The story is simplistic (a castaway tries to leave an island, but is continuously stopped by the titular reptile). The soundtrack is grounded by ambient nature sounds, and an exquisite operatic score. That’s all you need. The Red Turtle can carry you away into a paradise of spirit and loss.\n\nThe emotional connection with The Red Turtle can become almost overbearing, with the marriage between music and animation reaching a soulful zenith. As it operates like a fable, the way you can implant your own experiences in the film’s tabula rasa narrative will only make The Red Turtle even more difficult to shake off. It’s the type of art piece that can evoke every feeling you have ever known at the same time, like life is rushing through you all at once. Sometimes, our biggest burdens are blessings in disguise, and our life begins anew from there on.\n\n6. Incendies\n\nDenis Villeneuve dominated the 2010’s, and has entered the 2020’s taking on a new franchise film with Dune (after being entrusted with Blade Runner 2049). Things are looking great for the Quebecois filmmaker. I’m not surprised, considering how heavily he established himself with the ferocious heritage tragedy Incendies to begin the era. A metaphor for the distances a mother will go, plus a statement on the rippling effects of cultural hatred, Incendies is the most harrowing film of the last ten years. The lengths Nawal goes through to survive are beyond torturous. This is a cinematic decathlon, of a character enduring as much as possible to exercise their rights to freedom.\n\nFrom the vantage point of two children trying to learn more about their mother, Incendies becomes an even more daunting undertaking. We assume we know the outcome, given the present day reminiscing. We do not expect the darkest turn to occur at all, and yet it rears its ugly head so bluntly. The entire journey from before now feels even worse, but all was fought for the ability to grant a chance for a new generation to experience a better life. Incendies is the most extreme form of cultural and familial sacrifice.\n\n5. Parasite\n\nBong Joon-ho has had an affinity for creating films about the suffering of working class families for the longest time. In 2019, he bested his entire filmography with Parasite: an adrenaline rush of epic proportions. In a world that feels like a despotic future (but is actually the now), the Kim family is presented the opportunity to subsume a house owned by a wealthy family. They can do so by having each Kim family member work as a separate employee within the house. Representing the inequality of the class system in a capitalist society, the Kims feel no choice but to overtake to progress.\n\nWe think we have figured out the entire film, but Parasite spins on its own head halfway through, and becomes an entirely different film. We learn that the entire opening act is nothing more than the introduction of the plot. From there on out, Parasite is deranged desperation: the incessant need to stay within the dream home. As fantasies begin to die, mortality becomes a major factor: players die in order to live fruitfully. To paraphrase an entire decade full of housing crises and financial ruin, Parasite bottles up all of this angst, and shakes it until it turns into erupting lunacy.\n\n4. 12 Years a Slave\n\nHaving become the king of hyper-dramas very quickly, Steve McQueen was pressed to follow up Shame with the next big film. Well, 12 Years a Slave delivered in insurmountable ways. When it comes to this unfortunate time in contemporary history, no film has handled the discussion of American slavery better than this adaptation of Solomon Northup’s memoirs. With the taste of freedom presented at the start, and the obvious title being a warning, we cannot expect how dark 12 Years is going to get. When Northup changes his goal from wanting to “live” to wanting to “survive”, that’s when you know the level of despair that 12 Years is about to reveal.\n\nThrough the various slaves Northup encounters, and the owners he is bought by, we get a number of accounts of how badly these workers were treated. By the time we reach the “soap” scene, we figure we have seen it all before; we were absolutely wrong. With long takes, artistic close ups, and anxious pauses, 12 Years a Slave paints a picture of survival with each and every crucial step in full focus. The resolution is one of slight joy, and tremendous heartbreak; even the most tender moments of Northup’s life have been stripped away from him, outside of the rebirth of his legacy.\n\n3. The Master\n\nWhen it comes to mainstream filmmakers, no film was more enigmatic in the 2010’s than Paul Thomas Anderson’s craving for a character study known as The Master. Placing a perverse and shell-shocked war veteran in front of the most notorious cult of modern times (it’s not Scientology, Anderson swears!) is enough of a plot for us to get by. Anderson raises his hand, drops it, tells Freddie Quell and Lancaster Dodd to “go”, and we watch them duke it out for two and a half hours. What will win: the most damaged and impenetrable of minds, or the successful religion that has worked with lightning fast speed at converting the traumatized?\n\nQuell gets more run down, and Dodd becomes more frustrated. The tug-of-war seems to have some sort of a standstill towards the third act, when the gloves are tossed off, and Dodd tries one last time to accept Quell as family (in a sense, that’s how he treats “The Cause”). Quell has no one for company; not even himself. At what point is any of this beneficial? Is the inauguration of a sick individual to boost the numbers of a church the actual caring of said person? Does any of this matter if it’s all for statistics, especially when Dodd doesn’t even believe his own lies? Anderson lets you figure out your own philosophical courses in The Master, and many people still don’t have an answer seven years later.\n\n2. Moonlight\n\nBy channelling his inner Wong Kar-wai, Barry Jenkins created the American film of the decade. He aimed for a cinematic poem with biting commentary, and we received Moonlight as the final product. Divided into three chapters (named after Chiron’s nicknames and birth name), I personally see these acts as “the birth”, “the death”, and “the reincarnation” of Chiron’s identity. Jenkins tells a story of an African American child that discovers his sexuality early on, and is having to face the brunt end of a harsh neighbourhood, a neglectful mother, and the inability to be heard. We’re all hearing you now, Chiron.\n\nBeing passed around from influence to influence, we see Chiron be bettered (Juan and Teresa as unofficial guardians), and worsened (mother Paula, and student Terrel’s abuse). When Chiron has shed all of his previous characteristics as an adult — and has also been forced to follow in Juan’s footsteps due to societal disrepair — the spark of Moonlight is all gone. We are left with Chiron (now “Black”) being reminded of the past (the good and the bad) that he has fled from. With Juan reflecting on the words he lives by, Moonlight is a specific story that can be applied to many marginalized voices that have been silenced in one way or another. It’s time for all to shine.\n\n1. Roma\n\nTowards the end of the 2010’s, Alfonso Cuarón decided to drop his passion project of the last number of years. Roma is semi-autobiographical, with much of its sets and props coming from Cuarón’s actual childhood. He aimed to recreate the distraught found within Mexico City during the 1970s, while commenting on the state of social-politics today, by providing the perspective of the indigenous, female house keeper Cleo. Roma echoes the idea that history repeats itself, and offers the implication that history flat out doesn’t change at all, sometime. The mother of the household that Cleo cleans, Sofía, makes it a point to mention that women are abandoned and left alone. In an industry that has overused the trope of a damsel in distress, Roma insists that, perhaps, women aren’t in need of saving, but just want to be treated like people.\n\nWith the greatest mise-en-scène in years, Roma turns every single image into a breathing snapshot of an era, an area, and a zeitgeist. With the precise sound editing, Roma turns city bustling and dystopia into the soundtrack of distress. With patient shots and the ability to soak everything in, Cuarón has reinvented the cinema of attractions. We are no longer ogling at events we recognize. We bear witness to the lives we overlook, and those that are taken for granted. Cleo’s life becomes the narrative of many generations. Roma is impactful enough to dominate an entire decade, because it speaks volumes out of the elements most filmmakers would render mundane. It is the resonance of the undermined."
