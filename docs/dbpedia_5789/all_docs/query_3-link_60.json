        "text": "[ No Spoilers for Inception ]\n\nRight down the line, from acting to directing to writing to musical score to effects, this movie is top notch. In some cases brilliant. There’s not a weak link to be found.\n\nThere are very few movies that twist and turn between action and drama with Gatling gun speed yet remain mostly comprehensible. I said mostly, because everyone in the theater is going to walk out asking, “What just happened?”\n\nWhere most movies that try to mix a complex plot with action fail is that characters do things for unknown reasons. Or they do things and we don’t understand what it is that they are doing. With Inception it’s always clear what they are doing and why they are doing it. But what it means is always a debatable.\n\n——Content continues below——\n\nA friend that I saw this movie with summed it up perfectly, saying “This movie will be this generation’s Blade Runner.” This coming from a huge Blade Runner fan. I couldn’t agree more. Based on reviews and all the positive things people are saying in the social media sphere, Inception will have a hugely successful theater run. And you will very likely want to see it again on DVD because it needs multiple viewings to get your head wrapped around it.\n\nThere is no doubt Inception will garner a cultist following. The only downside I see from this are the inevitable copies it will spawn that will, for the most part, suck. Such is the price of a groundbreaking movie. (Don’t worry: you don’t have to see these movies. I do.)\n\nMovie Grade: A+\n\nAnalysis of Inception\n\nIs there anything extra during the end credits of Blade Runner?"
