        "text": "NICHOLAS A. JORDAN\n\nChristopher Nolan’s film starring Leonardo DiCaprio titled “Inception” may at first appear as quintessential anti-avant-garde film. As I will discuss in this piece though the similarities between this Hollywood cinema film and other iconic avant-garde films is staggering. The influence of both early and late experimental films are apparent in this Nolan masterpiece. When we look at certain aspects and the way in which they have evolved over the past century we have to wonder if this is just the next step in avant-garde filmmaking, utilizing newer aesthetic and filmmaking methods. We have seen the film genre transition from Un Chien Andalou to Meshes of the Afternoon to Dr. Strangelove and later films like Mulholland Drive or Dogville. The film possesses a feel of Maya Deren’s Meshes and Luis Bunuel’s Un Chien Andalou being introduced to 21st century special effects and computer generated images (CGI). One thing that is undeniable when we view this film is that the influence of filmmakers such as Deren and Bunuel were present during the creation of this film.\n\nBut as we will discuss, is it really that farfetched to think of this “enormous” movie as avant-garde? When we look at the director Christopher Nolan, (Batman trilogy) his relationship to personal mentor filmmaker Stanley Kubrick is the first signal that we may not be that far off. Kubrick, who directed 2001: Space Odyssey, was seen as helping bring avant-garde to Hollywood films. According to an article in Variety, “both filmmakers (Nolan and Kubrick) recognize that the “experimental” can be retrofitted into the idiom of the “mainstream.” Perhaps now instead of characterizing these “experimental” films as artistic and aiming them definitively toward that path that exploits their uniqueness we recognize their innovativeness and experimental use of “new” special effects, camera work, and CGI. One thing is certain, the similar elements between Nolan’s Inception and early avant-garde films like Meshes and Un Chien Andalou are present.\n\nSo, what are some of the key characteristics or elements of avant-garde film? Experimental films like Deren’s Meshes rely on dream sequences that move artificial boundaries and a chronological order that seems “fumbled” to the viewer, redrawing artificial boundaries and presenting a synthetic element within the film. Widely considered the cornerstone of early avant-garde film and possibly the greatest short film ever by Roger Ebert, Un Chien Andalou uses dream sequence and aspects of hallucinations that we see in any of the avant-garde films at this time. (Sterritt, 1) The avant-garde film “movement” has become known for their odd and artistic storylines. Does this disqualify Inception? Absolutely not. Inception’s odd nature appears more “non-sensible” than later films such as Dr. Strangelove and when viewed collectively are not too far from Meshes. According to P. Adams Stitney, the genre relies on irrationality of the unconscious and uses surreal imagery, abrupt change of place and dream imagery. (Stitney, 9, 10) All of which are elements present in Inception. Below I outline some key characteristics of this genre:\n\nRely on dream sequences (and free functioning thought) that move artificial boundaries.\n\nAssociative connections between images and scenes based on their appearance or functions. (E.g. In Bunuel’s Un Chien Andalou it shows a woman carrying the same box in different scenes spanning many years. This allows the audience to recognize it is the same woman. In Inception each character carries a personalized object across all realms. )\n\nOften emphasizes irrationality of the unconscious and requires subconscious affirmation.\n\nAmerican avant-garde film uses experimental cinematique techniques such as “jump cuts” and “slow motion” to emphasize a dream or fantasy state.\n\nStoryline that follows no free-flowing chronological order.\n\nTypically feature low-budget films.\n\nWhen we look at one of the “experimental” films defining characteristics – the “dream element” – we see this film possesses deep dream sequences so complex they would rival any early avant-garde film. Crafting dreams in early films like Andalou allow the character to shift or alter images and objects instantaneously. To do so the film assumes to get lost inside of the characters subconscious. In the film we observe through flashbacks and in-dream thoughts the fate of Cobb’s wife Mal. She becomes so consumed by this dream state that she loses sense of the line between reality and the subliminal status to the point of taking her life, jumping from the recurring hotel room due to her deep belief that she would wake up – confusing the dream state and reality. Like “Meshes,” we see the character of Saito so deep into action in the dream world that he begins to bleed through his shirt in the real spectrum as he rides in the backseat of the van halfway through the film. The character driving has no clue what is occurring inside of their dream but visibly sees the harm done. By dying inside of his dreams and us getting our next shot of him seeming to die (in actuality he lives) in the chair featured in reality, we can see a similarity to the main female character’s death in Meshes. These dreams become so complex that Mal not only killed herself after becoming lost in her dreams but they can feature many multiple layers – permitting a person to wake up multiple times and still be in an altered state – once again like Meshes.\n\nWhen referring to aspects of time, they commonly associate with this so-called “dream state” in avant-garde. Throughout the film flashbacks and time skips take place in which Cobb is visited by his wife Mal who keeps reappearing in his world. Her memories and appearances occur across various time periods and incite an action or emotion and any scenario featuring Mal is just a projection of his subconscious. Inside his mind is a compound and inside that compound is a vault.\n\nLike early experimental films Inception features associative connections between scenes or actions based on objects. Not only can objects change instantaneously due to “jump cuts” (such as the bar being redesigned in front of our eyes within seconds, being transferred from a hotel to a snowy rural hillside simultaneously, or a doorway to a wooden shack located along the beach that “morphs” into a gated elevator door that moves upward into a subway, Cobb’s home, or even to the hotel room where Mal took her life) but objects can be present throughout all realms to give us a sense of the characters state. In Andalou we notice that as time skips from the present to “8 years later” and then to “16 years earlier” we know that the person featured is the same female character due to the association between the female individual and her possession of the small wooden box that makes an appearance in the present-day apartment as well as along the beach “16 years earlier.” Similarly we see these early “experimental” associative connections featured throughout this film as they each carry one character specific object into the altered state to allow them to know they are in an induced dream state. In Cobb’s case it is a spindle and should his age or appearance change that object is present to remind us of the character’s identity. Inception features similar “time skips,” jumping from many different points in time. For example, we see Saito as an old man, younger at multiple points, and older again. We see the team enter their targets mind and revert back to a time before the subjects father had previously died to implant an idea before he takes over the inherited corporation. The flashbacks and time travel contribute to these “time skips.” Inside of this dream state they are able to redraw artificial boundaries and aspects of time – playing within a person’s subconscious. It is within these characters subconscious that they are able to successfully maneuver through this “hidden” world. “Jump cuts” are further used similar to both Meshes and Andalou. In Un Chien Andalou we see scenes throughout where objects “shift” their state. For example, in the apartment attack scene we observe the piano transform into two pianos, then the two pianos into two pianos dragging “pilgrims” and a deer head. Aside from Inception’s beach elevator scene we see these “jump cuts” used throughout. When Cobb explains the architecture of a dream we see Ariadne turn a mirror into a door and a door into a crowded walkway under a bridge, we see her turn a single set of stairs into an infinite amount and a city flipped on top of itself.\n\nAvant-Garde films are typically low budget “underground” films that are not widely received. American avant-garde godfather Jonas Mekas began showing them to “underground” audiences in New York and San Francisco but were never widely accepted in the United States. (Mousley, 1) Conversely, in the early 20th Century when the genre was in its infancy it was welcomed by French audiences, attracting large celebrity audiences at premieres of films like Luis Bunuel’s Andalou. It has largely been “unwelcomed” in the United States and because of this “outcast” characteristic it has become largely unrecognizable to film audiences. We tend to focus on and refer to CGI heavy films as experimenting with the next great effects while aspects of films like Inception get looked at for the larger picture.\n\nAnd although on any scale this film is considered high budget – a $100 million blockbuster with a worldwide release. But has the perception of “low budget” changed over time? Yes, when we think of low budget we still think seven figures or in comparison to the latest James Cameron “mega blockbuster.” Budgets have evolved to the point where these type of early avant-garde cheap budgets are largely unrecognizable and uncommon in even artists like Lars von Trier’s films.\n\nThe film center’s around Cobb (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and the carefully constructed dream world through which he has become a thief of the most unique kind. Hired to plant an idea in the mind of a powerful CEO and unlock a secret, he must enter this world of Inception – a dream world consisting of extensive layers of subliminal states – and travel through the past and present as well as extensive dreams and layers and layers of extensive dreams to execute such an extensive plan. Along the way we are introduced to dream builders, a film setting featuring objects that can shift or alter their state right in front of our eyes and a torturous ex-wife that plaques his dream world – blending his perception of reality and the dream world. As the story unfolds, the scenes become masked in unpredictability and the world between unconscious and subconscious reality become blurred or borderline nonexistent.\n\nIn Meshes, unlike early films that only provide 1-2 scenes that contribute to the context, for the first time in American avant-garde we begin to see American experimental films centered more on a central storyline. Earlier French films like Andalou by Dali and Bunuel relied and intentionally aimed to make a film where absolutely nothing made sense. Decades later in American films such as Dr. Strangelove (1964) we see a full narrative with a more extensive chronological order that casts a “big-time Hollywood actor” as its lead in Peter Sellers. In later and more recent avant-garde films such as Lars von Trier’s Dogville (2003) or the 2000’s film Mulholland Drive (2001) we see the genre take on such Hollywood A-lister’s as Nicole Kidman, James Caan, and Naomi Watts.\n\nIs this newer style of experimental films a move away from traditional avant-garde films absurd? No. When we look at later films like Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) or Mulholland Drive (2001) we see that they began to take on more of a storyline and while the chronological order may become more predictable they began to possess elements of a narrative. Actually, we can really see these expanded narratives when experimental films made their way to the United States film industry.\n\nHow is the sound similar or different to other avant-garde films? In earlier films we see some non-diegetic sound aspects that involve static or a humming sound – perhaps like a swarm of bees. Nolan has been credited with creating a 21st century similar non-diegetic sound that has become so captivating and used in many of Nolan’s trailers and films today. His “BBRRAAWWWNN” sound has been featured in not only Inception but in the Batman trilogy films as well and has become a well-known and identifiable sound in recent films over the past few years. The film uses diegetic sound as well but sound that is created specifically within this dream world that we are to believe as authentic. Inside of this synthetic world these cannon sounds of exploding boxes, crates, and windows would 100% exist. The film lacks true formal song elements, lacking any vocal chorus or lyrical music from any musical artists but relies on instrumentals largely produced by the typical big budget orchestra and symphony.\n\nCamera shots in early films utilized many intercutting, fading, or dissolving techniques as well as the typical cutting. Now the filmmaking industry has progressed so much that intercutting is largely unnecessary when demonstrating the shifting shape of an object. We can now view the selected object alter its shape without the use of these blending techniques. In Meshes we see the flower “blend” into a knife but it Nolan’s film we can see a glass of water become angled inside of a glass or a hotel bar alter its design within seconds, never cutting away from the image. It is avant-garde’s influence on the current technologically heavy film industry. One angle that I believe was no “accident” was the infinite staircase scene featured in Nolan’s Inception – featuring the same Bird’s Eye View angle used by Deren in Meshes. Early avant-garde films featured an assortment of “newer” angles such as point of view or bird’s eye view, expanding on the typical camera uses. Recent filmmakers have just continued to advance this notion and use camera angles from every position imaginable. Calculating the advance of technology on Hollywood this genre is the only formidable transition for new era filmmakers and sometimes implementing aspects is more effective than entirety.\n\nAnd how are some of these aspects any different than some of the visual aspects shown in Un Chien Andalou? As mentioned earlier Salvador Dali and Luis Brunuel wanted to make a film where no scenes made absolute sense to the viewer, creating images that are random and largely unimportant to the rest of the story. Is there a difference between seeing a man dragging two pianos or ants coming out of a human hand as opposed to a runaway train heading down the city center or a street full of boxes and windows popping like cannons up and down the street as we have seen in Inception? No, we have progressed as a film audience and as filmmakers and this is simply the natural progression. By taking things that typically make no sense and still emphasizing them inside the film, filmmakers are now providing them some meaning or explanation for their absurd imagery.\n\nSupportive of the notion “experimental,” many first generation “Hollywood” film students using their 16mm cameras experimented with the process during the time the genre became visible in the 1960’s. Those same filmmakers like George Lucas are arguably at the peak of the Hollywood directing empire and aimed to advance the film industry and transcend it. Having never been fully introduced to avant-garde before then we are now finally within the past couple decades starting to see their influence on the genre and the direction within which they are moving the film industry.\n\nIs this notion of Inception as experimental absurd? Quite a bit I would say but I believe upon analyzing the films I referenced it appears that Inception’s identity as experimental is the only natural and expected step in the progression of avant-garde films in this country. Are there still purely definitive avant-garde films? Yes, but the films have come to embody more of what they claim to be – experimental. What’s the difference between someone pulling two piano’s with a deer head and two pilgrims behind it or a city laying on top of another city featuring cars traveling upside down? Had we changed the name to Mr. Cobb’s Dream Factory and shot the film in grayscale or black and white would this be seen as more avant-garde? Dr. Strangelove is difficult to not visibly see the big motion picture aspects when watching the film. Had the film been shot in color where it is more “understandable” for the larger audience we may see it still shown on AMC channel regularly today.\n\nThere is greater difficulty today when defining more modern avant-garde films due to the significant increases in technological advances and their impact on film. One thing we know is that film, more importantly Hollywood mainstream cinema, will not de-advance their progress or revert back to older and often more difficult techniques when making films. They become more uncommon, further in the past and the term low-budget has likely evolved to mean a figure with seven or low eight digits. The difficulty is in finding experimental filmmaking techniques that newer audiences can relate to and will watch – movies are made today for the theatre as the ultimate destination end game of each film. Do we slowly integrate them, slide certain aspects in here or there or jump right in with both feet? Inception contains elements we covet deeply in avant-garde film. So, while on the surface Inception may appear as anti-experimental, I think given the natural progression of the film industry and expected growth that this picture embodies what the future of avant-garde film will look like in composition. Perhaps we should begin referring to “experimental” as “innovative.” It is a technologically advancing generation that is penetrating the film industry and the term “experimental” has come to encompass many things that are just that – experimental.\n\nStitney, P.
