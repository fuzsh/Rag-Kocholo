        "text": "Early Life and Education (1802–1820):\n\nVictor Marie Hugo, a towering figure in French literature and a leading figure of the Romantic movement, was born on February 26, 1802, in Besançon, France. His father, Joseph Léopold Sigisbert Hugo, was a general in the Napoleonic army, and his mother, Sophie Trébuchet, was a devoted royalist. This contrasting background had a profound impact on Victor Hugo’s political and literary views later in life.\n\nGrowing up in a family that experienced both sides of the political spectrum during a tumultuous period in French history, Hugo was exposed to diverse perspectives from an early age.\n\nIn 1808, his parents separated, and his mother took Victor and his siblings to Paris. Hugo’s early education was influenced by his mother’s intellectual pursuits, and he developed a love for literature, poetry, and theater.\n\nVictor Hugo’s literary talents were evident from a young age. His first poem was published when he was only 14, marking the beginning of a prolific career in writing. In 1816, he entered the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, where he continued to hone his literary skills and developed a deep appreciation for classical literature.\n\nEarly Works and Romantic Influences (1820–1830):"
