        "text": "\"In precise, rhythmical, elegant sentences, Stephens delivers a succinct but nuanced appraisal of Hugo’s life and works. His biography succeeds in its mission to look beyond the clichés that encrust the icon and paint the 'arch Romantic' in all his turbulent complexity.\"\n\nTimes Literary Supplement\n\n\"The first English biography of the literary behemoth in over twenty years, in these troubled times of ours Victor Hugo is the antidote we never knew we craved. . . . Comprehensive, refreshingly accessible—and concise!—Stephens's pocket-size monograph draws a fascinating portrait both of the private man wrestling with family tragedy and the public figure navigating a society rocked by turmoil. . . . Essential reading in a post-truth era!\"\n\nFrance Today\n\n\"[A] thoroughly informative, highly enjoyable new biography . . . Stephens’s achievement in organizing such voluminous material is considerable indeed. His biography is detailed and wide-ranging without ever appearing rushed, while the chronological structure adopted throughout allows for careful consideration of major works alongside reflection on the lesser known. . . . Compelling.\"\n\nJournal of European Studies\n\n\"Stephens has penned an elegant and succinct biography. . . . He allows the dominant forces that influenced Hugo to ebb and flow throughout the narrative without attempting to marshal them into the construction of a particular image, since a guiding principle of this biography is to free Hugo from the mythmaking that has beset criticism of his life and works from the beginning (and for which Hugo was partly responsible). As much as this is a biography of Hugo, it is also an exploration of the myth and a warning against the facile portrayals of a legendary and heroic figure. Again and again Stephens sends us away from the confected legend of the man back to the works through which he speaks (and of which Stephens provides excellent translations). . . . One of the jewels of the work is the final chapter, examining Hugo’s afterlives and the mythmaking of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.\"\n\nModern Language Review\n\n\"Any account for Hugo’s long and eventful life makes a rattling good yarn. Stephens’s signal achievement is to have compressed it into a short and lively book that gives accurate thumbnails of all the important works. Full of enthusiasm for his subject, Stephens writes nonetheless with admirable balance and does not mask Hugo’s human flaws. This 'Hugo' will surely inspire readers to delve into the wonders of the poetry, drama, and fiction created by the preeminent public figure of nineteenth-century France and whose image and moral example continue to shape many aspects of our contemporary world.\"\n\nDavid Bellos, Princeton University, author of 'The Novel of the Century: The Extraordinary Adventure of 'Les Misérables'\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet the latest updates on new releases, special offers, and media highlights when you subscribe to our email lists!\n\nSign up here for updates about the Press"
