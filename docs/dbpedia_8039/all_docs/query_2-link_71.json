        "text": "xxxxxAs we have seen, Victor Hugo, the French poet, novelist and dramatist, produced one of his best-known novels, The Hunchback of Notre Dame in 1831 (W4). This melodrama, together with works such as his verse play Hanant and his drama The Kingâs Fool, made him the undisputed leader of the French romantic movement. Indeed, the preface to his first play Cromwell, produced in 1838, is regarded as the manifesto of Romanticism, or, as he put it, âthe liberation of literatureâ. Not for him the literary restraints imposed by Classicism, a fact clearly shown in the 1820s by his extravagant prose romances (such as Bug Jagal) and his exotic poems, like his Orientales. (The sculpture is by the famous French artist Auguste Rodin).\n\nxxxxxHis most productive period began in 1830 with his poetic drama Hernani, a play which, as from its opening night, provided a long and bitter controversy between the Romanticists and the Classicists. The next thirteen years saw a stream of successful productions, beginning with The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and including the prose dramas Lucrece Borgia and Marie Tudor, the melodrama Ruy Blas, and several volumes of contemplative verse, such as Songs of Twilight. These works in particular showed his descriptive skill, his deep, sympathetic understanding of human nature, and his masterly command of language.\n\nxxxxxBut the year 1843 was marred by disappointment and sadness, brought about by the failure of his verse drama Les Burgraves, and then the tragic death of one of his daughters in a boating accident. Hugo was devastated, felt unable to write, and turned to politics. A royalist at this juncture, he accepted a post in the government of Louis Philippe in 1848, but by the time Napoleon III had seized power in 1851 he was a confirmed republican. As a result he was forced to flee the country. In 1855, after taking refuge in Belgium and then the island of Jersey in the Channel Islands, he eventually settled down at St. Peter Port on the neighbouring island of Guernsey. Hauteville House (illustrated) was to be his home until he returned to France in 1870 following the Franco-Prussian War and the fall of the French Empire.\n\nxxxxxOnce safe in exile, Hugo wasted no time in denouncing the regime from which he had fled. His pamphlets NapolÃ©on le Petit and Histoire dâun crime, together with his collection of 97 poems entitled Les ChÃ¢timents (The Punishments) launched a scathing, intemperate attack upon the Second Empire in general and Napoleon III in particular. The self-styled Emperor was described as a man with blood on his hands, who lived in splendour and cared nothing for the poverty and degradation endured by the mass of his people.\n\nxxxxxIn contrast, another collection of poems, Les Contemplations of 1856, won acclaim for the simplicity and purity of their tone, the beauty of their expression, and the depth of their thought. Likewise his Legend of the Centuries of 1859, a series of pictorial poems illustrating manâs struggle between good and evil through the ages, was well received. And later, as if to show the width of his poetic powers, came Chansons des rues et des bois (Songs of the streets and woods), a collection of light, witty verse centred around his fleeting, uncomplicated affairs with young maids and country girls. And also belonging to this period was Les Travailleurs de la Mer of 1866 (The Toilers of the Sea), a passionate tale of manâs battle against the waves, set appropriately in a Guernsey fishing community. Later came an essay on William Shakespeare and The Man Who Laughs, a novel set in 17th century England.\n\nxxxxxBut his major work while in exile was undoubtedly Les MisÃ©rables (The Wretched), an historical prose romance which he had been working on for many years and was eventually published in 1862. A story about social injustice in contemporary, strife-ridden France, it takes place for the most part in the Parisian underworld - including, at one point, a dramatic flight through the cityâs sewers. It contains numerous plots, some only broadly developed, and these are centred around the trials and tribulations of Jean Valjean, a man who, having spent nineteen years in prison - initially for stealing a loaf of bread - gains a respectable position in society, but finds that he cannot escape his past. Despite his good intentions, he is hounded by the law in the person of police inspector Javert, and both meet their deaths in the closing pages of the drama. The most endearing character is Cosette, who, maltreated as a young girl, is cared for by Valjean, and finally finds happiness with Marius Pontmercy, a rebel who, like Hugo himself, becomes a republican in the cause of freedom.\n\nxxxxxThis panoramic view of French life, full of dramatic incident and pathos, proved the perfect vehicle for Hugoâs remarkable powers of description and his abiding sympathy for the poor and oppressed. It contained, too, his own thoughts on religion, politics and everyday affairs, together with some lengthy digressions, notably his own account of the Battle of Waterloo. Received with enthusiasm, the book earned him fame both at home and abroad.\n\nxxxxxIn 1870, with France having been defeated at the hands of the Prussians, Hugo returned home a national hero, hailed as the man who had waged a war of words against the Second Empire and helped to bring about its downfall. He became a senator under the Third Republic, but distress within his family took its toll. Having lost his wife AdÃ¨le in 1868, the deaths of two of his sons and the mental sickness of his daughter AdÃ¨le in the early 1870s sapped his creative energy. In these final years, he wrote a number of novels, several volumes of poetry, and a play, but in general they lacked the master touch.\n\nxxxxxHowever, this said, his last novel, Quatrevingt-treize, produced in 1874 and graphically depicting the momentous events of 1793, is regarded by many today as one of his finest works, and by some as his masterpiece. And worthy of note is his charming The Art of Being a Grandfather, published in 1877, and his four act drama Torquemada of 1882, a play condemning religious fanaticism via the Spanish Inquisition. During a life-time of writing Hugo produced seven novels, 21 plays, and 18 volumes of poetry. (Hugo pictured here with his grandchildren).\n\nxxxxxIn 1878 Hugo suffered a rather severe stroke, but this did not stop Paris from celebrating his eightieth year in unforgettable style. In one of the largest parades ever held in the city, thousands upon thousands of people walked down the Champs ÃlysÃ©es to the centre of Paris, passing by his house in the Avenue dâEylau (renamed Victor Hugo that year), where he sat at one of the windows. It was a rare and moving show of affection for a man of the people. He died in 188 5, two years after the death of his long-time mistress Juliette Drouet. His body was laid in state beneath the Arc de Triomphe, and then carried on a hearse down the Champs ÃlysÃ©es (illustrated) for burial in the PanthÃ©on. It is estimated that some two million people lined the route to pay homage to the man who was not only one of Franceâs greatest men of letters - a novelist and a poet of enormous talent - but also a symbol for so many years of his countryâs struggle towards republicanism. He cared for the people and, at his end, the people showed that they cared for him.\n\nxxxxxIncidentally, having arrived in Paris in 1870, Hugo found himself caught up in the siege of Paris. Later, in his poem LâAnnÃ©e terrible, he described the suffering caused by that event during what he called âthe terrible yearâ. There was a severe shortage of food but, as a celebrity, he was provided with meat from the Paris zoo until supplies ran out. â¦â¦\n\nxxxxxâ¦â¦xA number of operas were based on his works, including Donizettiâs opera Lucrezia Borgia and Verdiâs Rigoletto, and many of his poems were set to music by Berlioz, Bizet, Saint-Saens, Massenet and Wagner. He himself enjoyed music. He greatly admired the works of Beethoven, and he liked the music of Gluck and Weber. As noted earlier, he numbered among his literary friends Lamartine, Vigny, Musset, MÃ©rimÃ©e and Gautier. â¦â¦\n\nXxxxxâ¦â¦xHis novel Toilers of the Sea, written while in Guernsey, had an unexpected impact on social behaviour. Its lurid account of strange creatures lurking in deep waters made fashionable an interest in squids. Squid parties and the wearing of squid hats became popular for a time! â¦â¦\n\nxxxxxâ¦â¦xHugo has the distinction of providing the briefest correspondence in history. After Les MisÃ©rables was produced in 1862, he sent a letter to his publisher to enquire as to its reception. The letter simply contained a question mark. The publisher replied by a letter which simply contained an exclamation mark! As indicated, the novelâs success was immense, and became even more so towards the end of the 20th century when it was adapted as a musical. It was first staged in Paris in 1980 and opened in London five years later. It was still running over twenty years later, and a film was made of it in 2012. â¦â¦\n\nxxxxxâ¦â¦xHugo was also a proficient ar tist and during his lifetime produced more than 4,000 small-scale drawings in brown or black pen and ink, many abstract in form. These were praised by no less than Delacroix and Van Gogh. Illustrated here is Town with a tumbledown bridge. â¦â¦"
