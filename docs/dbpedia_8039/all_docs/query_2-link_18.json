        "text": "I was reading Atomic Habits the other day trying to glean some writing habit tips. In the book James Clear told a story about Victor Hugo which astonished me. So I did a deep dive on him and found some very interesting tidbits. I thought I‚Äôd share them with you‚Ä¶\n\nVictor Hugo, the renowned French writer responsible for classics like ‚ÄúLes Mis√©rables‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Hunchback of Notre-Dame,‚Äù was not only a literary genius but also a master of discipline. He had a unique way of ensuring he met his writing goals.\n\nDuring the writing of ‚ÄúThe Hunchback of Notre-Dame,‚Äù Hugo‚Äôs routine was to lock himself in a room, often with a large wooden plank across the door to prevent anyone from entering. He would remove all his clothes and give them to his assistant who would then be instructed to hide the clothing.\n\nWith his clothes out of reach and nothing to wear but a large shawl, Hugo would settle down to write in solitude. This helped him to remain focused, eliminating the temptation to stop writing.\n\nWow. That‚Äôs commitment.\n\nHe would write for hours, often producing astounding amounts of work in a single day and some of the most enduring works of literature in the 19th Century."
