        "text": "Victor Hugo (1802 — 1885) is a French writer. He’s as famous for his poetry as his theater, his essays or his novels.\n\nHe was a key figure in the Romantic movement in France. He’s also known for being an engaged artist who had to go into exile because of his writings.\n\nAs a novelist, he wrote very famous books such as Notre Dame de Paris (1831), Les Misérables (1862).\n\nAs a poet, he wrote Les Châtiments (1853), Les Contemplations (1856) or La Légende des siècles (1859).\n\nAs a theater writer, he wrote Hernani (1830) or Ruy Blas (1838).\n\nHis death, in 1885, generated an intense national mourning : he was really famous in his lifetime and this celebrity never stopped. He’s today considered as a major French writer, one of the most important.\n\nWe can find this poem « Demain, dès l’aube » in Les Contemplations, a collection of 158 poems about memories, love, joy, life, death and grief written between 1830 and 1855. The collection was published in 1856.\n\nIn 1843, Léopoldine Hugo, his daughter fell into the Seine with her husband they married a few months before) while they were boating. They both drowned. This tragedy had a huge impact on Victor Hugo’s personality and it influences a lot his work, notably his poetry : numerous poems are dedicated to Léopoldine’s memory.\n\n« Demain, dès l’aube » is one of them. It’s a magnificent text in which the poet is speaking to an anonymous person and tells him / her he’s gonna have a long long trip tomorrow in order to meet him / her. This person may be a very dear friend, maybe a lover, as Hugo says he can’t remain far from her. The two last verses only reveal her identity : the poet is going to a cemetery to put flowers on a grave. And « demain » will be the anniversary of the death of Léopoldine, (September 4th, 1843)."
