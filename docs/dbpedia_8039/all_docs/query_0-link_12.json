        "text": "Biographical History\n\nVictor-Marie Hugo (1802-1885) was a French novelist, poet, and dramatist best known for his works the Notre-Dame de Paris (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame) (1831) and Les Misérables (1862).\n\nHugo was born February 26, 1802 in Besançon, France to Léopold and Sophie Hugo. His father was a high-ranking officer in Napoleon's army while his mother held strong royalist views. The result was a disjointed marriage. Hugo's father was sent to Spain in 1809, where he was named governor of two Spanish provinces, Ernani and Torquemada. His mother moved Hugo and his two brothers to his father's estate, but returned the family to Paris by 1812.\n\nHugo wrote his first play in 1816. By 1819, Hugo and his two brothers, Abel and Eugène, began production of a royalist review titled Conservateur littéraire. In 1822 Hugo married Adèle Foucher with whom he had five children. Shortly after, Foucher began an affair with Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve while Hugo started a relationship with actress Juliette Drouet.\n\nAround mid-century Hugo became involved in politics. He was elected to the National Assembly in 1848 and to the Legislative Assembly in 1849. After his son, Charles, was imprisoned, Hugo opposed Napoleon III openly. As a result, when Napoleon III came to power in 1851 Hugo was forced to flee to Brussels. His family eventually settled on the island of Guernsey, with Drouet living next door. Hugo returned to France in 1870 where he continued his political involvement. He was elected to the National Assembly in 1870 and to the Senate in 1876.\n\nHugo had a successful literary career, serving as a central figure in French romanticism. Hugo died on May 22, 1885. His body lay in state under the Arc de Triomphe and the government ordered a period of national morning.\n\nSelected Literary Works\n\n1823 Odes Han d'Islande ( Han of Iceland) 1826 Bug-Jargal ( The Slave-King) Odes et Ballades 1827 Cromwell 1830 Hernani, ou l'Honneur castillan ( Hernani; or, The Honour of a Castilian) 1831 Les Feuilles d'automne Notre-Dame de Paris ( The Hunchback of Notre Dame) Marion Delorme 1832 Le Roi s'amuse ( The King's Fool) 1833 Lucrèce Borgia ( Lucretia Borgia, a Dramatic Tale) Marie Tudor 1835 Angelo, Tyran de Padoue ( Angelo) Les Chants du crépuscle ( Songs of Twilight) 1837 Les Voix intérieures 1838 Ruy Blas ( Ruy Blas: A Romantic Drama) 1842 Les Rayons et les ombres 1853 Les Châtiments 1856 Les Contemplations 1859 La Légende des siècles ( The Legend of the Centuries) 1862 Les Misérables 1866 Les Travailleurs de la mer ( The Toilers of the Sea) 1872 L'Année terrible 1878 Le Pape 1881 Les Quatre Vents de l'esprit 1882 Torquemada"
