Les Châtiments

poetry by Hugo

Les Châtiments, collection of poems by Victor Hugo, published in 1853 and expanded in 1870. The book is divided into seven sections containing more than 100 odes, popular songs, narrative poems, and anthems in which Hugo denounces injustice and tyranny and rails against Louis-Napoleon (Napoleon III) and the abuses of the Second Empire. The work was composed in Brussels and Jersey during Hugo’s first year of voluntary exile from France. Les Châtiments is suffused with his horror and indignation but ends with his commitment to progress and peace and his belief in freedom and brotherhood.

Six of the work’s seven sections are ironically titled with such slogans of the Empire as “Society Is Saved,” “The Family Is Restored,” and “Stability Is Assured.” The non-ironic title of the final section is “The Saviors Will Save Themselves.” Among events rendered in vivid poetic detail are those leading up to the emperor’s coup d’état in 1851 and the subsequent deception and death of innocent people.
