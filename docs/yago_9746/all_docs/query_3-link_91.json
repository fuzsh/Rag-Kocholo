It carries not just tea, but memories of adventure and service — the same opportunities Dickson seeks to give others as international Extension program coordinator in International Programs in ​Agriculture (IPIA).\n\nThe native of Ponca City, Oklahoma studied agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University before joining the Peace Corps in 2003. In three-plus years as an agricultural and community development volunteer in Paraguay, Dickson assessed community needs and creatively addressed them. She introduced techniques for farmers to improve yield and sustainability, new cash crops, leadership training and health education. She extended her service to train incoming volunteers and assist outgoing personnel.\n\nShe returned to Oklahoma State to complete a master’s degree in 2009. Jobs were scarce, so when a Korean officemate mentioned the abundance of openings in her home country, Dickson signed on to teach English in Korea, first to elementary and middle schoolers, and then to university students.\n\nBack in the U.S. two-and-a-half years later, she asked a mentor familiar with Extension to recommend the nation’s best Extension site. The answer: “You need to go to Purdue.” Dickson’s Extension career thus began in Brown County — a transition she calls “seamless.” As international Extension program coordinator, Dickson facilitates the cultural competence that comes from adapting to an unfamiliar culture. Toward that end, she asks two key questions: “How can I help Extension educators have international experiences and have them come back as better educators? How do they share those experiences with their local community members?” Her role is to find and fund those opportunities.\n\nShe is building a comprehensive program with three tiers of experiences for three distinct audiences. The first is local interaction with international communities in Indiana for people who lack time or interest in overseas travel. The next is weeklong study abroad or group travel involving faculty, Extension educators and students.\n\nDickson’s top tier — “the most exciting, the most impactful” — takes single or paired travelers on two- or three-week experiences. One such example is IPIA’s farmer-to-farmer program in which U.S. volunteers share specific skills with farmers in Colombia. “It’s all very hands-on and applicable to their lives,” she says.\n\nFor faculty, a top-tier experience might be a research project in another country with a tangible outcome that betters the lives of its people as well as those in other areas — a specific farming recommendation, or a product that is produced and sold, for example.\n\nPurdue is a trendsetter in international development, Dickson says, “because our leadership sees its importance and supports it.” But she would like even more members of the university community to tap IPIA resources. “We have a lot of connections internationally, so if faculty want to start research in a certain region, we can open doors for them. On the other side of that, a lot of faculty may not think about the real-world application that Extension can bring to their project.\n\nHaile is a native Ethiopian who holds Master of Science in Agriculture (Agronomy).

This discipline of Pedology simultaneously challenges one intellectually, physically and brings one to the field in some of the most beautiful and interesting places imaginable.\n\nI am interested in the underlying stability of soil systems. This stability is controlled by the inherent balance between inputs and losses of nutrients and carbon. We now understand that human exploitation of these soil resources, beginning a few thousand years ago, allowed agriculture to become an enormous success. The vastness of the planet and its soil resources allowed agriculture to expand, with growing populations, or to move, when soil resources were depleted. My research program is directed toward studying the origin and evolution of soils and quantifying the biologically mediated processes of soil formation in many environments around the world. However, the practice of farming greatly accelerated rates of erosion relative to soil production, and soil has been and continues to be lost at rates that are orders of magnitude greater than mechanisms that replenish soil. The net results of human impacts on soil resources this century will be global in scale and will have direct impacts on human security for centuries to come.\n\nMy current research is targeted towards evaluating the vulnerability and stability of soils to changing climatic and land use conditions in the context of global and climate change research.\n\nExtension and Outreach:\n\nAs the liaison between the university and cooperators in federal, state, local and private sectors, I work at strengthening our capacity for accessing and disseminating soils information. Much of the information about soils that people utilize comes directly out of Soil Surveys published through the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS). I serve on several regional and national advisory committees for the NCSS.\n\nBrian Kowalkowski started at the College of Menominee Nation in 2007 as Assistant Director of Education Outreach Extension.
