        "text": "Interesting interview with a racer I personally would consider one of the most prolific karters in our generation!\n\nI have always enjoyed racing from behind the controls of the machine being contested. But I love watching good racing and loved doing this long before I was ever lucky enough to compete and still do. This is a racer who really is a racers racer.\n\nWe did not know him and he was on another team, but he took the time to come to our pit and comment on how he liked Romans calm hands on the wheel and his ability to be competitive being big with the weight penalty. Roman was in his first year of shifter as well and Alan suggested Roman develop the ability to drive a shifter with the left hand and be comfortable driving with his left hand only. That is exactly what we did and some have indicated what I did to train Roman to do this borders on child abuse? Maybe?\n\nYou think Roman took it to heart? Ever watch his ability to drive left hand only?\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2Eel5mcUmc\n\nAlan’s influence on one racer. It stuck. He’s left a mark on many others as well.\n\nPoint is? You ever watch this guy drive? Maybe he is too old to run with the teenagers coming up, it can be a young mans sport at the very highest level. (this is the progression of life) But if you know what your looking for, this is one very smooth driver who is very comfortable driving the entire race with one foot over the edge and being in total control at the same time. What a driver. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this master perform his art. I saw him helping Barry’s customers and propel Richies RBI team beyond what I imagine they expected too. Never seemed to look down on any one. Again, we weren’t on that team but I couldn’t help but keep an eye on what he did as such a humble racer with such an extreme skill set. It was fun to watch.\n\nI believe we are very lucky here in Colorado to have so many great racing venues, and it looks like there are more tantalizing circuits coming. The claims of Colorado’s Premier karting facilities and so forth are certainly claims that come from very good tracks. Grand Junction Motor Speedway has to be proud to be on the greatest karter of our times, top 5 karting facilities of all time list. Wow! And I am in good company in my belief that this is a very very good place to race, for all the reasons we all know. Shop, indoor bath rooms, live timing and scoring, an excellent race track that is smooth and easy on equipment… and on and on. Glad to see such a great racer hold one our tracks in as high a regard as many of the racers do.\n\nCheck out this interview. It stimulated responses from some of the greatest our sport has ever had to offer as well.\n\nPretty cool. Glad we had the opportunity to watch him, what a down to earth racer who makes it look so easy. He set the bar higher for all that follow him in this sport.\n\nRead the interview here.\n\nhttp://www.ekartingnews.com/news_info.php?n=11442\n\nRick\n\nRick,\n\nHope your getting stronger every day! I plan on making it back to Colorado for a few races in 09 (as long as all of these series don’t split the entries).\n\nYou are right about Alan. He did help propel our program to another level. as did AJ Noud. You can see that in AJ’s program and success today. Alan was always so much fun to watch in anything he drove. And, the one cool thing about him, he never got nervous in ANYTHING. At Petite lemans at Road Atlanta, he was getting ready to crawl into the LMP2 car for his first stint. While we were helping him get his stuff on Kelly asked “are you nervous?” He simply replied, “Hell No, this is my job.” then crawled in the car and was picking people off like crazy (until the engine blew 3rd stint or so). That is exactly how he is in anything he races. From karts, race cars, or trying to scare me in rental cars, he never seemed rattled. That was the cool thing about watching him.\n\nAnd most importantly, the image you see of him helping everyone and being kind is not an acting job. One of the coolest people with the biggest heart. The memories of being in Italy, racing in colorado, star mazda, everything. That is why I miss racing soooooo much. gotta hang out with a true friend every weekend.\n\nSee you all next year. (notice I did not type Y’all) NEVER!!!!!!!!"
