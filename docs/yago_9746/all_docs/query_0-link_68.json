        "text": "Monthly Archives: June 2021\n\nA 10 year old reviews James Rallison’s THE ODD 1s OUT book and YouTube series\n\nBy Julian Kenney Fresh off his hot review of AMERICAN GARGOYLES, my now older-and-seasoned son has written his second review, for one of his most favorite things on earth, the new James Rallison THE ODD 1S OUT book. I had never heard of Rallison when my son asked me to pick up the first bookContinueContinue reading “A 10 year old reviews James Rallison’s THE ODD 1s OUT book and YouTube series”\n\nMovie Love Seen Through an Immigrant Story: Abel Ferrara’s THE PROJECTIONIST\n\nPeople need to pay more attention to Abel Ferrara movies.\n\nSurprise, Surprise: Christopher Plummer in Atom Egoyan’s REMEMBER\n\nChristopher Plummer, Martin Landau and Bruno Ganz have all passed since REMEMBER was made. It’s worth checking it out for them, as the first 85 minutes are great. The last 5?

Recommended!\n\nAntonio Banderas and Jonathan Rhys Myers square off in BLACK BUTTERFLY\n\n“Banderas expresses the joy of acting even when he is giving a measured performance. His brooding has zeal to it…”\n\nAlan Rudolph’s Fanciful Despair: RAY MEETS HELEN\n\nAlan Rudolph’s most recent worthwhile film is now available on a Blu-ray alongside AFTERGLOW\n\nWhy, Yes, I liked Tomb Raider, Thanks For Asking!\n\nConsidering I usually abhor this stuff, why did I embrace the already forgotten TOMB RAIDER? I’m a contrary fellow, that’s why!"
