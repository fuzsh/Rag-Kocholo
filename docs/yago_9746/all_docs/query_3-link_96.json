        "text": "With the exception of Jean-Jacques Beineix's ''Diva,'' American audiences have never taken to adult fairy tales of the sort that often charm French and Italian audiences. By adult fairy tales I mean fey fables, which may or may not be allegorical, full of elephantine metaphors and supposedly lovably eccentric characters who make\n\nbig statements fresh from the screenwriter's notebook.\n\nI'm not talking about the kind of cheerily optimistic, populist comedies made by Frank Capra, which often have the form of fairy tales, but about the chicly bizarre conversation-and-haute couture pieces made by Mr. Beineix (''Diva'' and ''The Moon in the Gutter''), Marco Ferreri (''The Story of Piera'') and even Luchino Visconti (''Conversation Piece''). In spite of the great popular success here of ''Diva,'' Americans, I'd always thought, were far too commonsensical either to appreciate such nonsense or even to attempt to make their own variations. Now, I suspect, I was wrong.\n\nHaving just come upon Alan Rudolph's ''Choose Me'' late in its run - it originally opened in New York in early November, I'm ready to change my mind, if not about the genre in general then certainly about Mr. Rudolph's work in particular. Seven years and four movies after he made his debut as a writer-director with ''Welcome to L.A.,'' Mr. Rudolph seems to have found his style - or, at least, I think I'm beginning to get his point.\n\n''Choose Me'' is not exactly great, but it's always disarming - a very entertaining, deceptively fragile-seeming original. It's a movie that seems to owe a certain amount to the courageous, artful heedlessness of Robert Altman, with whom Mr. Rudolph wrote the screenplay for ''Buffalo Bill and the Indians'' (1976) and who produced both ''Welcome to L.A.'' and Mr. Rudolph's second feature, ''Remember My Name,'' to William Saroyan, who could read the secrets of the universe on a barroom floor, and even a little bit to Mr. Capra.\n\nMr. Rudolph's films are not - heaven knows - populist, but there is something subversively upbeat in his crazy fables about determinedly oddball characters, people who may either blow their brains out on some slight pretext or recite a bit of poetic prose that wouldn't embarrass Edgar Guest.\n\n''Choose Me,'' which seems to take place in a Los Angeles from which, fairy-tale-like, all other citizens not essential to the fable have vanished, is intentionally, sometimes wildly funny , and this, I suspect, is the key to everything Mr. Rudolph has done beginning with ''Welcome to L.A.,'' though I remember that one as being more solemnly pretty than funny. There are hints of his sense of humor in last year's ''Return Engagement,'' Mr. Rudolph's documentary about life on the lecture circuit with the unlikely show-biz team of G. Gordon Liddy and Timothy Leary, but then there didn't seem much that the director had to do to make the Liddy-Leary spectacle funnier than it was in real life.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
