LATE JOSE' CHEF & LOUIE BILL & MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION GATESFOUNDATION.org TENRI CULTURAL INSTITUTE tenri.org https://lnkd.in/e55sRd8b https://lnkd.in/eB98Jnv9 WonderMind.com: CRYPTO-FINANCE & REYGITONIUM-G MR. MS. TEEFEY & SELENA GOMEZ-RARE-SUPERSTAR. TCI GALLERY SPRING 2024 THEMES. CRYPTOCURRENCY & REYGITONIUM-G TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: I ABSOLUTELY SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH CRYPTOCURRENCY: REYGITONIUM-G I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE INFANT DEMOCRATIC-CAPITALISTIC MINDS OF TODAY BLAME USA GOVERNMENT. THEN IS ANY GOVERNMENT TO BE BLAMED FOR HOMELESS PROBLEMS PLAGUING THE WORLD.? NO. GOD KNOWS HEADACHES USA GOVERNMENT HAVE WITH THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS. THE NEW WORLD PRACTICALLY SHOCK TO WITNESS. PEOPLE ONLY WORKING TOGETHER FOR A COMMON GOAL. \"IN THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.\" DOESN'T THAT ALSO INCLUDE THE HOMELESS. THE HOMELESS ARE OUT THERE. ARE YOU.? HOMELESS.. OPPORTUNITY MISUNDERSTOOD. The modern economic system is a market economy, which is a capitalist economy where people, not the government--NOT THE GOVERNMENT--own most businesses. In a capitalist economy, prices allocate capital and labor between competing uses, and capital assets can be privately owned and controlled. https://lnkd.in/eB98Jnv9 EXAMPLE, IF YOU NEED TO RAISE MONEY FOR ANY REASON OR MORE SO LETS SAY THE \"HOMELESS\" PROBLEM WHICH IS BELIEVED TO BE TIME & MONEY CONSUMING BUT IN ONE DIRECTION TOWARD THE HOMELESS. HOWEVER CRYPTOCURRENCY CAN POSSIBLE ALLOWS AN EXPENDITURE OF CURRENCY TO BENEFIT ALL WHO USES THE CRYPTO & REGARDLESS OF HOW IT'S CONSUMED. THEREFORE IF A CRYPTO HOMELESS CURRENCY REYGITONIUM-G EXISTED IT'S MORE HIGHLY LIKELY THAT THE HOMELESS PROBLEM CAN BE VANQUISHED BECAUSE CURRENCY-FINANCES IT'S ALWAYS AVAILABLE TO BE TAPPED INTO FOR HOMELESS RESOLUTIONS. REYGITONIUM-G: EACH COUNTRY GOVERNMENT INITIAL $1-DOLLAR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF 8-BILLION EARTH CITIZENS. THEREAFTER GLOBALLY ANYBODY CAN INVEST IN THE CRYPTOCURRENCY REYGITONIUM-G. OR CONTINUE HIDING THE HOMELESS WHEN A POLITICAL LEADER VISITS AMERICA. CLOSING COMMENT: THE DAMNEDEST CRAZIEST FUNNIEST EMBARRASSING ABOUT THE HOMELESS CHAOS IS ANY EXCUSE AS TO WHY HOMELESS EXIST. HENCEFORTH CONSIDER USA TRILLIONS IN DEBT & 6,120 HOSPITALS SCATTERED AROUND THE USA & MANY COUNTRIES ASKING FOR FOREIGN AID IN THE TRILLIONS & YOU TALKING EXCUSES. MEANWHILE WE WANT TO SETTLE HUMANITY ON OTHER PLANETS. THANK YOU FOR READING.\n\nLet‚Äôs go! üèõÔ∏èüíöüëè Today‚Äôs historic $20B GGRF announcement marks a significant milestone in our mission to scale climate technologies in a way that puts people first. With this once-in-a-generation, catalytic financing program, America is investing in itself in a big way ‚Äî by accelerating climate solutions that deliver deep community impact and mobilizing much-needed funding to fill the scale gap. We are beyond energized by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s announcement that it will award $20B of the $27B GGRF program to our partners and collaborators at the Coalition for Green Capital, Climate United, Justice Climate Fund and Power Forward Communities. Our team has spent the last year working day-in and day-out with these partners to design and build a strategy that centers innovation and equity, with solutions that reduce emissions, build economic opportunity and support healthy neighborhoods. When we started Elemental over 14 years ago, we couldn‚Äôt have imagined we would be building for this kind of moment, with this kind of impact. But with an expansive growing national pipeline of 300+ projects and a decade-plus track record executing community-centered investments, we are ready to deliver. üõ†Ô∏èüå± Learn more: https://lnkd.in/geGxZFUW"
