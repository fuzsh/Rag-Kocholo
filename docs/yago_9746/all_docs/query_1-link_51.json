        "text": "As Keith Carradine does more and more criminal acts his hair and clothes get frillier, brighter, thicker, and more outrageous. By the time Trouble in Mind reaches the one-hour mark he’s Mick Jagger in the “Just Another Night” video. A metaphor for the eighties? Alan Rudolph doesn’t cop to them. He prefers pulp — pulp to which he pays meticulous attention to art direction, scoring, makeup, and color. Also movie archetypes: tall silent strong men, helpless women, women embittered by tall silent strong men. Every character, even the most hard bitten, which means he or she is a romantic, for what is cynicism but curdled romanticism and living on unrealized expectations? Forgotten for years, restored in a 2010 DVD and Blu Ray release, Trouble in Mind is a minor masterpiece of film noir re-imagining. It is a long, sometimes tedious, often outrageous movie. It has more silliness than an intelligent audience has a right to endure. Trouble in Mind is, in short, an Alan Rudolph film. I love it.\n\nSet in a contemporary Seattle known as Rain City, Trouble in Mind uses Edward Hopper as inspiration for locations, the most important of which is a cafe run by Wanda (Genevieve Bujold, in a Pat Benatar ‘do) where sad men in halts smoke cigarettes and drink coffee and wait for things to happen. Hawk is that thing. Released from prison after an eight-year sentence for murder, Hawk (Kris Kristofferson) returns to Wanda’s hoping for nookie. Eight years is a long time to go without action if you’re not gay. So he forces himself on her, in a deed that from my eyes doesn’t look consensual despite her making it clear that it’s the last time. Into this scenario roll Coop (Carradine) and Georgia (Lori Singer), imprisoned in an awful mobile home in a city lot and carrying a crying baby. Coop, an older version of the grinning callow charmer whom Carradine played in Robert Altman’s McCabe and Mrs Miller (1971), wants money. A scribbler of terrible poetry named, er, Solo, gets him involved in petty theft. More felonious though is Joe Morton’s hair straightened into porcupine spikes on either side of his head. Coop is an indifferent lover and an amateur thief; proud of the holstered knife he’s strapped to his back, he’s unable to unsheath it during fraught moments. Selling hocked goods at a discount to other hoods is bound to piss off Rain City’s most powerful criminal scion, Hilly Blue (Divine). A neglected Georgia and horny Hawk circle around each other. “The wrong man at the right time don’t mean shit, pal!” he growls at Coop after saving Georgia from he, Hawk’s, clutches — a line I need to remember for next Friday night.\n\nIn the mid eighties this Robert Altman protégé found his voice and released one startling and uncategorizable film after another: a romance starring Carradine, Bujold, and Leslie Ann Waren called Choose Me (1984); an arch, meticulous realization of art crime and literary forgery in 1920s called The Moderns (1988). Even Songwriter, his only work for hire until 1991’s Mortal Thoughts, breathes. He’s the sort of writer-director who gives Afterglow‘s Julie Christie lines like “My soul needs an overhaul!” and makes them work. Unfolding as if they were musicals without music but without the hyper performances, Rudolph’s movies use realism as the anchor to which he ties experimental meteorological balloons, some of which are bound to pop in the stratosphere while others never leave terra firma. The failures are grim and singular: Made in Heaven, Love at Large, Trixie, Investigating Sex, even the last twenty minutes of Trouble in Mind, which collapse into a Don Johnson video set. But his staging and use of a camera rival Altman’s, and they’re often more alert. In a warm reappraisal, Dave Kehr notes Rudolph’s use of “associative editing,” for example the way in which he rhymes or reverses movements shot to shot, enhancing the otherworldly vibe.\n\nBut the performers don’t, which is why Trouble in Mind is compelling for two thirds of its running time; they don’t wink at the audience. I mentioned anchors; Genevieve Bujold, herself on some kind of roll in the mid eighties (watch her from Tightrope to Dead Ringers) serves as one here, like John Gielgud often flitting past a tricky scene with her voice, such as when Wanda warns Hawk to “Keep awaaaaaaayyy” from Georgia. Lori Singer doesn’t have anything to do but cry and is indifferently directed, but Carradine is as goofy-sexy as ever. Kristofferson, who doesn’t mind being repulsive, just about kills his archetype for future players. Bouquets to Divine though. Cast in his first and only non-drag role as a dangerous but sad Sydney Greenstreet variant, his jabbing, leering line readings keep Kristofferson awake. “Women are despicable, most of all mothers,” he says, apropos of nothing. It suggests another movie — another world — that Rudolph could have shown. But as Mark Isham’s muted sax accompanies Marianne Faithfull’s ravaged rendition of the title song, this bauble acquires its own peculiar shimmer."
