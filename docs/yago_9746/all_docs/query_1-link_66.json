Itshould mention those few elements in the film that will make an audiencewant to see the film. In other words, it’s what makes you interested in thefilm. Here are some examples, both good and bad. I’ve listed the films’directors and dates <strong>of</strong> release to give you a sense <strong>of</strong> period, but a good logline does not need these facts to work.AFTERGLOW (Alan Rudolph, 1997) – Two unhappy couples cross paths.BAD -- What exactly is it in this film which makes these couples interact,and what make them interesting to watch?ALL THE RIGHT MOVES (Michael Chapman, 1983) – A Pennsylvania steel-townambitious and hot headed high school coach tries to spoil a football hero’sscholarship dream.GOOD – This gives a fairly clear sense <strong>of</strong> what is at stake and what theconcerns <strong>of</strong> the movie are (character).AMARCORD (Federico Fellini, 1974) – A young man, a stand-in for thedirector Fellini, romantically views life in the 1930s Italian village <strong>of</strong> thedirector’s youth.GOOD – This film will be about nostalgia, told lyrically, with less <strong>of</strong> a plotthan an eye for the past.BIG NIGHT (Stanley Tucci, 1996) – Two very different brothers promote theirstruggling 1950s New Jersey Italian restaurant by inviting Louis Prima and hisband to take part in a sumptuous dinner there.GOOD – The plot line seems to hinge on the characters. There is a storythrough line.BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY (Clint Eastwood, 1995) – An Iowa housewife,stuck in her routine, must choose between true romance and the needs <strong>of</strong>her family.BASICALLY GOOD – Gives a sense <strong>of</strong> the Streep character and the storybut ignores the Eastwood character needs and his enigmatic nature.DENNIS THE MENACE (Nick Castle, 1993) – Comic strip moppet plays prankson Mr. Wilson.BAD – Though it is clear how shallow this film is, there is no attempt togive the reader a flavor <strong>of</strong> what makes the hijinks interesting or different.EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (Tim Burton, 1990) – A suburban mother bringshome a freaky young man who has scissors instead <strong>of</strong> hands."
