        "text": "Is there a better use of music in a film than Tom Waits' Somewhere cover at the end of this film? Maybe What'd I Say in Cosmic Ray for pure effect... but there is no more appropriate use of music I can think of, both because Waits' raspy voice sounds like Nick Nolte's, and because Waits' mannered, overtly stylized performance style gives way to such a torrent of emotion in this song.

She projects the wounded perfection of a great beauty who has had the wrong sort of luck. In \"Afterglow,\" only her third role in the 1990s, Alan Rudolph has given her the sort of character she knows inside out: bemused, sad, needful, mysterious. - Ebert\n\nNick Nolte, Jonny Lee Miller, and Lara Flynn Boyle fit their roles, but this role fits Christie perfectly.
