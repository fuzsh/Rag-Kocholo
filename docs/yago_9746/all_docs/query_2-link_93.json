        "text": "A guy walks into a bar. It’s a set-up for a joke or, at best, a sitcom. As the set-up for a feature film by a director who cut his teeth on episodes of “The Brady Bunch” and “Love, American Style,” you wouldn’t expect anything resembling art. But much as the desperate, disparate characters in Choose Me walk into and out of each other’s lives in awkward coincidence, the stars aligned for a strangely romantic, and just plain strange, chemistry that still holds up after almost thirty years. And the guy who walks into a bar? It’s as if he’s walking out a of a film noir into a soundstage vision of a red light district in 1984 Los Angeles.\n\nThe idea for Alan Rudolph’s third feature film came to him while driving around Los Angeles. In 1993, he told Artforum that, looking for a baseball game on his car’s AM radio, he instead found a talk radio show for the lovelorn. The director found inspiration when he wasn’t looking for it. “Other than that, I only knew I had to use the song by Teddy Pendergrass.”\n\nCinematographer Jan Kiesser creates a stylized faux-Los Angeles bathed in neon, and follows Choose Me’s lost characters with graceful camerawork. Rudolph gets excellent performances out of his cast, especially Geneviève Bujold. She makes a credible human out of a character who on paper (and on screen) seems completely bananas. Bujold’s gravelly voice and utter seriousness gives emotional and authoritative weight to the part of Dr. Nancy Love. The radio talk show host feels utterly lost, but Bujold’s presence is strong enough to ground a persona that threatens to fly away at any moment. Keith Carradine plays Mickey, the guy who walks into a bar out of a mental hospital. Everything Mickey says sounds like a line and a lie, and if you’re never really sure you should trust Carradine, he keeps you guessing instead of just dismissing him outright. Lesley Ann Warren is Eve, who owns the bar Mickey walks into. After Mickey comes on to her in his strange, scary-charismatic way, Eve thinks he’s the kind of guy who proposes to every woman he kisses. And he kisses quite a few in this movie. Warren, like Mickey, is also a kind of film noir type, the tough but sensitive broad who can’t find a good man.\n\nIf this sounds like a recipe for romantic comedy, it’s not, exactly. These people are too lost and disconnected, whether they can only take their love problems to a faceless voice on the radio, or whether they give advice to strangers on the radio but can’t fix their own lonely life. The entanglements of these people trying and failing at romance are tied together in one bittersweet scene by Teddy Pendergrass. The former Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes singer gruffly croons, “And if I had/Someone to love me,” and the movie cuts between the varied romantic state of the film’s characters: but whether they’re locked in a passionate kiss, or alone in bed, the music sadly tells you that they’re still looking.\n\nRudolph’s musical choices are perfect. Pendergrass sets the movie’s main tone of melancholy soul, but scenes in Eve’s bar also feature great jazz duets by tenor saxophonist Archie Shepp and pianist Horace Parlan. Shepp was once a leading figure of the jazz avant-garde, and his career turn to a more straightforward blues is a smart fit for a movie that takes conventional elements and mixes them up in a unique stew.\n\nChoose Me struck a tone that Rudolph could not repeat. His next film, 1985’s Trouble in Mind, brought back Bujold and another great soundtrack, but that film showed hints of a forced quirkiness that mars much of his later work. Something about Choose Me just works, even out of order; when I programmed the film for a repertory series in the late 1990s, two of the reels were switched. I was the only one who noticed.\n\nA curious casting note: Choose Me is the only feature film acting credit for artist Ed Ruscha, a friend of Rudolph’s. Ruscha plays Ralph Chomsky, Dr. Love’s station manager. The artist is known for the dry with of his word paintings and photo books like Some Los Angeles Apartments, recently reviewed in this space. He looks every bit the part of the no-nonsense station manager here.\n\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve revisited one of the favorite films of my youth and found that the magic was gone. The 1980s fashions and music of Choose Me threatened to date the film, but I was happy to discover that even though I hadn’t seen the movie in over 15 years, it hasn’t lost its mysterious magic. On a budget of less than a million dollars, Alan Rudolph achieved something rare in film: he created a distinct, self-contained dream world, a vivid alchemy of music, picture, and humanity."
