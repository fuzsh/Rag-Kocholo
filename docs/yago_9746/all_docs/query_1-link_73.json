        "text": "Isham was initially described as an 'electronic' film composer pioneer, but his abilities transcended genres. He made his breakthrough in the early 1990s with Reversal of Fortune, Point Break, and A River Runs Through It. Regardless of genre, medium, or location, Mark Isham's oeuvre demonstrates a boundless ability to amaze the listener with his talent for creating evocative musical worlds.\n\nThe prolific composer has scored over 400 film and television projects including the upcoming critically acclaimed film The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. Mark Isham’s projects last year include the Oscar winning film, Judas and the Black Messiah, a masterful drama by Shaka King. He also recently provided the music for the science fiction series The Nevers for HBO, and for the second season of the crime series Godfather of Harlem. Other recent projects include Bill and Ted Face the Music, Togo for Disney+, and the drama series Little Fires Everywhere.\n\nThe list of top directors and artists with whom Mark Isham has worked over the course of his career is impressive. They include directors Brian De Palma, Robert Altman, Robert Redford, Werner Herzog, Gillian Armstrong, Karel Reisz, Kevin Reynolds, Jodie Foster, Kathryn Bigelow, Barbet Schroeder, Peter Medak, Mike Figgis, Irwin Winkler, William Friedkin, Paul Haggis, Sidney Lumet, and Belgian animation filmmaker Frederik Du Chau. Isham worked regularly with director Alan Rudolph on his films Trouble in Mind (1985), Made in Heaven (1987), The Moderns (1988), Love at Large (1990), Mortal Thoughts (1991), Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (1994), Afterglow (1997), and Trixie (2000). He composed the scores for Gavin O’Connor’s The Accountant (2016), Warrior (2011), and Miracle (2004), and for director Gary Fleder, Kiss the Girls (1997), Impostor (2001), and The Express: The Ernie Davis Story (2008).\n\nIn addition to the size of his oeuvre, his awards are also numerous. For his music for the film Men of Honor (2000) by George Tillman Jr., Isham received a Grammy nomination in the category 'Film, Television or Other Visual Media'. His score for Robert Redford's A River Runs Through It (1992) earned him a Grammy nomination for 'Best Instrumental Composition for a Feature Film or Television’ and was also nominated for an Academy Award for 'Best Original Score'. With Michael Apted's Nell (1994), Isham received a Golden Globe nomination for 'Best Original Score'. Of several Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Little Fires Everywhere, Once Upon a Time, Nothing Sacred and Chicago Hope, Isham cashed in on the one for EZ Streets (for the episode \"A Terrible Beauty\") in the category \"Outstanding Main Title Theme Music\".\n\nHe won an ASCAP Award (American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers) for the films Dolphin Tale (2011), Eight Below (2006) and Blade (1998) and for his work on the TV series Family Law (2000). While he was awarded 'Best Score' by the International Film Music Critics Association for Brian De Palma's The Black Dahlia (2006) and received a nomination in the 'Film Score' category, Racing Stripes (2005) was nominated in the 'Best Original Score for a Comedy Film' category and Lions for Lambs (2007) in the 'Film Music Composition of the Year' category.\n\nWhile developing as a film composer, Mark Isham continued to flourish and gain notoriety for his work in electronica and new age. He won a Grammy for his Virgin Records release, and Grammy nominations for his albums Castalia and Tibet. But his contribution to jazz is, if anything, even more important. He has collaborated and performed with jazz legends such as Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, and Bobby McFerrin. Mark Isham's jazz releases have been praised by the critics. Blue Sun was included in Downbeat's \"Top 100 Jazz Albums of the Decade\" and The London Times named Miles Remembered: The Silent Way Project \"Best Jazz Album\".\n\nOf his own work, Isham says: \"Improvisation has always been one of my passions. So, the jazz genre - any genre that allows music to be created ‘live’ and in the moment - has been something I’ve kept my hand in as much as possible. The act of creating music, whether ‘live’ or to be written down, is something I will never tire of.”"
