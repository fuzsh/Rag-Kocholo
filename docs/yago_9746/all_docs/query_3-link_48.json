        "text": "Board Member\n\nAlan Rudolph serves as Vice President for Research for Colorado State University. As the chief institutional advocate and facilitator for faculty research activities, Dr. Rudolph is responsible for programmatic excellence in research for Colorado State University. He most recently served in the Senior Executive Service as Director of Biological and Chemical Technologies for the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security. He also currently holds an affiliate faculty position at the Duke Medical School Center for Neuroengineering. Dr. Rudolph has had an active career in translating interdisciplinary life sciences into useful applications for biotechnology development. His experience spans basic research to advanced development in academia, government laboratories, and most recently in the nonprofit and private sectors.\n\nAs a National Research Council postdoctoral fellow, his earliest work at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington DC demonstrated the translational value of strategies used by organisms that survive environmental extremes to preserve defense products, such as biosensors and blood products, for field deployment. Dr. Rudolph served as Chief of Biological Sciences and Technology at the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), where he led a new strategic framework for life sciences and bio-inspired engineering research that is still a foundation of DARPAs biological programs today. Dr. Rudolph founded several biotechnology companies, including Cellphire, a cell stabilization company in Phase II clinical trials, and Adlyfe, a neurodegenerative biomarker company. As founder of the International Neuroscience Network Foundation, he oversaw the Walk Again project in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, executing early clinical development of brain controlled prosthetics in paralyzed young adults. The foundation continues to support innovative community-based applications of brain science, including the use of mixed reality in therapeutic applications such as dementia and learning.\n\nOver his career, Dr. Rudolph has raised and managed more than $1.5 billion in research and development investments and published more than 100 peer-reviewed technical papers. He holds 15 patents across a variety of disciplines."
