        "text": "About the work format (archetypes) Hello everyone! I've recently read an article on hbr.org (I'll provide the link at the end) on a subject that remains relevant, namely, how companies approach their work formats, in other words, work archetypes. Over the past few years, we've seen IT giants like Google initially moving towards remote work and now back to the office. The fact that there are essentially three main archetypes (office-forward, remote-first, and hybrid) is not news. What caught my interest was the research on the alignment of the company's strategy towards archetypes with the employees' desires in the same direction. The article's authors identified nine personas that emerge when combining the company's strategy with employees' needs. I'll provide brief examples of three personas. The \"Avatar\" is an employee who is a remote work advocate and works in a company that follows a remote-first strategy. Typically, these are employees who grew up in an office but love and appreciate remote work. Or the \"Community-seeker\" is an employee who loves the office but finds themselves in a remote-first company. These are often the ones who try, often unsuccessfully, to convince the rest of the team to come to the office, and then they head to the nearest cafe or coworking space to soak in the office atmosphere. Let me introduce one more persona: the \"Progressive.\" This is an employee who values the hybrid model but is in a company with an office-forward strategy. They might be concerned that the remote format is being forgotten or phased out. What's important in all these intertwining strategies for work formats and employee desires? Not knowing and understanding which personas work in your company can lead to a disruption of the work atmosphere and the emergence of ongoing turbulence. It's interesting to note that those most inclined to disrupt the work atmosphere are not the employees whose desires are in direct contrast to the company's work model, but the \"half-agreeable\" ones – those who are in the middle (aside from hybrid models and desires). For example, employees who want to work in a hybrid model in a company focused on office work or remote work. This is because there is too much uncertainty in their case. To bring the situation into harmony, the first thing that needs to be done is to identify the types of personas working in the company. Then, think about options that would promote finding a middle ground. This can include a clear articulation of the company's approach to workplace types, involving the dissenting voices in decision-making, or even something more rigid. Ultimately, all of this is aimed at ensuring the success of both the company and its employees. Link to the article: https://lnkd.in/dHGbih9g."
