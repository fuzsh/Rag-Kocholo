        "text": "My name is Alan Rudolph and I am licensed as a Marriage and Family Therapist. I've spent my career looking at how we live and it's clear that relationships are the key. Yet, as important as relationships are, we aren't given much help with them. As children we read fairly tales about knights rescuing princesses, but it turns out that real life isn't really like that. We don't just meet someone, fall in love and live happily ever after. Relationships, good relationships, are hard work. And, of course, when they are good, we are glad we made the effort.\n\nSo, while you were perfecting your trade, I've been looking at life and relationships. When your car isn't working you take it to a mechanic, when your computer is acting up you call tech support. And, when you aren't getting what you want from your life or relationships, you call someone like me.\n\nI've been a therapist for more than 30 years. During those years I have spent a great deal of time with clients talking about their lives and, at the same time, living my own. I discovered, as you may have, that men and women are different, very different, and its as if they speak different languages. I like to think that I speak both those languages and can help men and women communicate with each other.\n\nOf course, we have other relationships, too. We have parents, and children, and bosses and co-workers. Many of us want a relationship but haven't found one yet or haven't figured out how to make our relationships last.\n\nIf your partner is resistant, know this. Relationships can often be improved through the actions of one motivated partner, even though the other is unwilling to come to therapy.\n\nIf you are not currently in a relationship, we can work together to discover how you can build better ones.\n\nI've spent my life looking at these things and learning what makes them work."
