        "text": "Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 7.\n\nNow Playing\n\n''AFTERGLOW,'' starring Julie Christie, Nick Nolte and Lara Flynn Boyle. Directed by Alan Rudolph (R, 113 minutes). Ravishing as ever, Ms. Christie wafts luminously through this sinuous (if increasingly flaky) romance about a long-married couple with a lively extracurricular agenda. With Mr. Nolte equally enjoyable as her spouse, a handyman with a long list of grateful female clients, she creates a striking picture of middle-aged malaise. Set in Montreal and looking absurdly chic, the film involves these two half-estranged lovers with a much younger couple, played with at least as much sincerity as their roles warrant (not a lot) by Jonny Lee Miller of ''Trainspotting'' and the slinky Ms. Boyle. Though it grows ever mistier as it moves along, this is still one of Mr. Rudolph's most attractive amorous reveries (Janet Maslin).\n\n''AMISTAD,'' starring Djimon Hounsou, Anthony Hopkins and Matthew McConaughey. Directed by Steven Spielberg (R, 150 minutes). Irrefutably worthy in its attention to a long-overlooked chapter in American history, this story of a slave mutiny and subsequent trial is still a film whose zestiest character is John Quincy Adams (played by Mr. Hopkins). It has great earnestness, impeccable credentials and Mr. Spielberg's great storytelling power. But what it lacks is an Oskar Schindler, a flawed, three-dimensional character through whom the atrocity of slavery can be understood. The best moments in this long, instructive tale are those that simply bring the slaves' pride, fear and outrage to life. Mr. McConaughey, the weak link in casting that includes Nigel Hawthorne as Martin Van Buren, should cease and desist from playing any more smart lawyers (Maslin).\n\n* ''AS GOOD AS IT GETS,'' starring Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear. Directed by James L. Brooks (PG-13, 133 minutes). Nobody does a better job of backing characters into happiness than Mr. Brooks does, especially when those characters are so high-strung that happiness is almost out of the question. Echoing the quirky appeal of his ''Broadcast News'' in a more conventional sitcom atmosphere, this zinger-filled comedy a trois features high spirits, strong acting and tart writing. Mr. Nicholson, whose other recent performances have been virtually phoned in, is back in fine form playing an obsessive-compulsive misanthrope. His appalling, awfully funny wisecracks account for much of the film's spiky humor, especially after he winds up with the companions he deserves: a gentle gay painter (Mr. Kinnear) and a lovely, long-suffering waitress (Ms. Hunt) who is his own personal Alice Kramden. Complications ensue (Maslin).\n\n* ''THE BOXER,'' starring Daniel Day-Lewis and Emily Watson. Directed by Jim Sheridan (R, 107 minutes). This tender, wrenching Belfast drama takes a far more reflective view of Northern Ireland's ''troubles'' than the director's more fiery ''In the Name of the Father'' did. But it has no less passion or grit. With prison and fighting as strong central metaphors, it casts Mr. Day-Lewis in the title role of a loner who has served a 14-year jail term and now wants the impossible: a peaceful, quiet life. The magical star of ''Breaking the Waves'' plays his estranged ex-sweetheart, now another prisoner's wife and also the daughter of an I.R.A. leader. ''You have to get rid of him or you're going to find him in a pool of blood,'' he tells his daughter when the boxer returns home and rekindles the romance. Galvanized by such tensions, Mr. Sheridan tells a story of bravery, love and renewal with the stirring conviction that such things are possible even in perpetually embattled places (Maslin).\n\n* ''DECONSTRUCTING HARRY,'' starring Woody Allen and Kirstie Alley. Directed by Mr. Allen (R, 96 minutes). Private life caught up with Woody Allen several years ago, and now, with rancorous brilliance, he returns the favor. This savage, liberating comedy is one of his funniest films, and it also has a detached wisdom that transcends autobiographical trivia. Love, lies and the saving grace of creative imagination are at center stage here, as Mr. Allen weaves a dizzying plot around real events and a writer's self-serving, wickedly fictionalized versions. Jump cuts, frank profanity and an unapologetic taste for vice give the film an invigorating honesty, and Mr. Allen is brazen in making the most of it. To those who would take offense at the nastiness of this, the film offers a ruefully mature answer: tough (Maslin).\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
