Through a reading of his 1985 film Trouble in Mind, Caryl Flinn demonstrates that Rudolph is long overdue for critical re-evaluation.\n\nExploring Trouble in Mind’s influence on indie filmmaking, Rudolph’s dream-like style, and the external political influences of the Reagan era, Flinn effectively conveys the originality of Rudolph’s work through this multifaceted film. Utilizing archival materials and interviews with Rudolph himself and his collaborators, Flinn argues for this career-defining film’s relevance to American independent cinema and the decade of the 1980s.

Full disclosure—I am one of the producers of Alan Rudolph’s film Trouble in Mind, but Caryl Flinn has introduced me to more than I knew even while filming it. Full of detail and observations of decision-making during the creative process, it was wonderful to read.”\n\n— Carolyn Pfeiffer, Film Producer\n\n“Caryl Flinn’s Alan Rudolph’s Trouble in Mind: Tampering with Myths offers a wonderfully clear, well-argued, and comprehensive exploration of Alan Rudolph’s 1985 neo-noir. Placing the film in an exacting aesthetic, social and political context, Flinn makes a most compelling case for the film’s importance to independent cinema and for Rudolph as an extraordinary film artist.”\n\n— Justin Wyatt, University of Rhode Island\n\n“In recent years the discipline of cinema studies seems to be moving into the archive but without the excitement that characterized so much of the writing during the early years of cinema studies. This book on Trouble in Mind promises a new mode of study with roots in the archive but with multiple strategies for making it yield interpretive criticism. The result is a rich appreciation of how the film was received.”\n\n— Krin Gabbard, Stony Brook University\n\n“This book fills a void in the work on independent cinema, particularly with regard to the 1980s, as well as director Alan Rudolph, who has largely remained in the shadow of his mentor Robert Altman in film scholarship. It serves as a model for reading films of this period in light of Reagan-era politics and policies.”\n\n— Richard Ness, Western Illinois University"
