        "text": "The marriage of a faded actress (Julie Christie) and contractor husband Nick Nolte isn’t in the best shape, but when their paths cross with younger couple Jonny Lee Miller and Lara Flynn Boyle a typically atypical Rudolph paradox flowers. The producers included Robert Altman and Etchie Stroh, the latter recently reunited with Rudolph on Ray Meets Helen. Christie’s lovely portrayal brought her an Oscar nomination and Independent Spirit Award, among other accolades."
