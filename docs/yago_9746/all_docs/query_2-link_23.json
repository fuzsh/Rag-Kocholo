        "text": "Series | TROUBLE IN MIND, THE MODERNS, CHOOSE ME and REMEMBER MY NAME\n\nBook signing with Carolyn Pfeiffer for her new memoir, Chasing the Panther: Adventures and Misadventures of a Cinematic Life, prior to each screening at 6:30pm at the Aero Theatre, in partnership with the Larry Edmunds Bookshop\n\nAero Theatre\n\nABOUT THE SERIES:\n\nJoin us this September for a special weekend of double features hosted by filmmaker Alan Rudolph and producer Carolyn Pfeiffer at the Aero Theatre.\n\nA protégé of the great Robert Altman, Alan Rudolph began writing and directing films in the early 1970s. Starring a rotating cast of regulars including Keith Carradine and Geneviève Bujold, his work often centers around groups of young people who are intricately connected through coincidence, crime, or romance, from the chance encounter of Nancy and Mickey in CHOOSE ME to the sordid history linking the leads of REMEMBER MY NAME. A trailblazing figure of American independent cinema, Alan Rudolph has directed over 20 feature-length films.\n\nOne of the most prolific female producers of all time, Carolyn Pfeiffer began her career as an on-set assistant to the stars of the 1960s European art cinema. After founding her own public relations company in London, she returned stateside and co-founded Alive Films with Shep Gordon, producing titles including Rudolph’s TROUBLE IN MIND and THE MODERNS. Pfeiffer’s new memoir, Chasing the Panther, details her rise through the ranks of Hollywood and her reflections on an industry she’s helped to lead for decades."
