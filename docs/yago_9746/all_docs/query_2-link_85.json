        "text": "A wonderful recent U.S. film that got mixed notices except for the acting, The Secret Lives of Dentists has been compared to some other movies—Diary of a Mad Housewife (Frank Perry, 1970) and American Beauty (Sam Mendes, 1999) among them—that we don’t necessarily like. The basis for the comparison is that all three films deal with a marriage, in particular from the viewpoint of one of the marital partners, who feels alienated in general. All three, of course, are also comedies. However, Secret Lives is more searching than either of the other two just mentioned; it creates a much more complex portrait of a troubled marriage.\n\nThe script was adapted, by Craig Lucas, from a novella by Jane Smiley called The Age of Grief. I presume that the title turns on a double meaning, with Age referring both to the times and to the midlife crisis that the protagonist, Dave Hurst, finds besetting him. To the eye, Hurst is the picture of contentment—someone who really seems to have secured for himself the American Dream. He and his wife, Dana, share a successful dental practice at work and three energetic young daughters at home in a nice, big house in the suburbs. (They own another, more rustic retreat.) Alas, the dream may be as elusive for those who seem to have gotten hold of it as for those who never really get anywhere near it. Contentment can turn into complacency, which can turn into self-doubt, which can turn into almost hysterical fear and anguish. Beneath the surface, Hurst is not a happy man but one living, in T. S. Eliot’s phrase, a life of quiet desperation.\n\nNot coincidentally, Dana isn’t joyful, either. Her professional life is sufficiently unfulfilling that she needs to find creative vent; thus she is part of an amateur group that performs operas. She leaves much of the parenting and other domestic chores to her spouse, to whom the children appear more warmly to respond and who seems more adept than her on the homefront. She stays away from home a lot; I kept thinking of the woman whom Kim Novak’s character was pretending to be in Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo (1958), a wanderer, perhaps, who loses track of time. But Dave comes up with a different interpretation. He is convinced that his wife is having an affair.\n\nThere is no reason for us, however, to agree with his assessment of events. Clearly he is projecting anxiety onto the marriage, which helps keep Dana away from him, but not necessarily in someone else’s bed. Dave’s suspicions come out of nowhere, triggered by an utterly ambiguous event—something that might indicate adultery but much more likely indicates something else. But Dave has another relevant problem. He won’t find out from Dana whether she has a lover because, he fears, such a confrontation might result in her leaving him, thus collapsing his anxieties into the irrevocable loss of his marriage, his life.\n\nWhat does Dave see that sets his suspicious mind going? A lost embroidered handkerchief? No. Before the performance in which Dana is participating, Dave retrieves from the car the family’s rabbit’s-foot and is bringing it to Dana backstage. He stops dead in his tracks when he glimpses her, a distance from him, through a narrowly open door, with an expression of love, passion and joy on her face that he hasn’t seen for a long time—that he may never have seen. Dana is, close-up, speaking with a man whose back is to Dave; the man kisses her—I think, on the cheek. The entire shot is set up as a subjective one, a point-of-view shot; we aren’t seeing what objectively happened but what Dave sees, and at this moment it’s impossible to separate what part of it is at all objective and what part is imagined—distorted, that is, through Dave’s erupting anxiety. A hug, a kiss, intimate conversation: all this may have happened, but, even so, it doesn’t necessarily mean that Dave is espying a brief encounter between his wife and her lover. Dana’s joy may have more to do with her anticipated performance; Dana’s conversation may simply be with a well-wisher whom Dave doesn’t know. The whole thing could be imagined. (Bodies moving back and forth, interrupting Dave’s line of sight, suggest just such a possibility. The slow motion that the filmmaker applies to the event deepens this possibility.) Dave thinks he knows what he can’t possibly know; unless we’re fools, we know that we don’t know. In any case, Dave doesn’t deliver the good-luck charm but, instead, palms it. In an instant, it becomes a phallic symbol conveying the sexual anxiety into which Dave’s ego has collapsed.\n\nAs Thomas Carlyle put it, “Doubt of any kind is not removed except through action.” It’s unconscionable that Hurst would stew in this anxiety of his rather than deliver the rabbit’s-foot. (He lies to his daughters, saying he did deliver it to their mom.) His rationalization, we instantly know, is this: intruding on the lovers’ tryst would have brought more bad luck to his wife’s performance. Cowards are always rich in rationalizations. (Consider the current U.S. president, George W. Bush.) Before the performance begins, a patient of his, recognizing Hurst, confronts him with his professional incompetence; the filling Hurst had given him earlier that day fell out. This is a complex and (especially because public) humiliating event, underscoring Hurst’s failure to confront (less boorishly, one would hope) his wife. Another subjective shot transforms this patient into Hurst’s alter ego—the role (with a possible exception or two) that will replace the reality of the character throughout the rest of the film. This fantasy projection, based on a man whose wife has just left him, will counsel Hurst to leave his wife, to whom he will refer as a “bitch.” Misogynism can’t possibly help an imperiled marriage. The Hursts’ marriage is in need of repair; more serious counsel is needed than what this horrible fantasy projection can provide. My goodness, we root for the Hursts’ marriage throughout this film, not least of all for the sake of the three noisy, demanding, adorable (but not movie-cute) children. How about this as a starting-point for serious discussion: Dave can’t conceive of himself as “scary,” but Dana confides to him that she has always found him so. Dave sees what he doesn’t want to see in others, but he won’t listen to what he doesn’t want to hear. He is a perfect father to his little girls, but if he won’t listen to his wife, how is he going to relate to his daughters when they, too, become women?\n\nAlan Rudolph, Robert Altman’s one-time protégé, directed this film. I yield to no one in my admiration of Rudolph’s talent; in particular, The Moderns (1988) and Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (1994) are favorite films of mine that I revisit often. Rudolph’s handling of the pivotal scene backstage that I earlier described shows genius.\n\nCampbell Scott, the film’s co-producer, plays Dave Hurst. What a fine actor this son of Colleen Dewhurst and George C. Scott has turned out to be; Scott is nearly as good here as he is in Roger Dodger (Dylan Kidd, 2002). But the light of the film is Hope Davis, whose Dana Hurst is one of the richest, most luminous, most heartrending characterizations in cinema. (Could I have been wrong in finding Davis so irritating in 2002’s About Schmidt?) Davis, Davis, Davis—Bette, Judy, Hope: it’s a good name for a great actress. Davis was named 2003’s best actress by the National Society of Film Critics, which also named Lucas best scenarist.\n\nBonus: the DVD commentary track by Rudolph and Scott is one of the best I’ve heard in terms of making filmmaking choices explicable and accessible. Perhaps I should add that Scott himself is now a filmmaker—how good a one I’ve yet to discover.\n\nB(U)Y THE BOOK\n\nMY BOOK, A Short Chronology of World Cinema, IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FROM THE SANDS FILMS CINEMA CLUB IN LONDON.
