        "text": "by Tom Cunha\n\nDirector Alan Rudolph’s roots in filmmaking go back a couple of decades,\n\nworking as an assistant director under the wing of Robert Altman on films\n\nlike “The Long Goodbye” (1973), “California Split” (1974) and the highly\n\nacclaimed “Nashville” (1975). Venturing on to direct his own films in the\n\nlate seventies, Rudolph made his debut with “Welcome to L.A.“.(1977),\n\nfollowed by “Remember My Name” (1978), both of which were produced by\n\nAltman. He went on to receive critical praise for “Choose Me“(1984) and\n\n“Trouble in Mind” (1985) and has remained consistent in the theme and scope\n\nof his modestly produced, character driven features, usually dealing with\n\nindividuals whose lives intersect and drastically change as a result.\n\nA pioneer of independent American cinema, Rudolph’s latest project is\n\n“Afterglow“, a marital drama in which two dissatisfied couples unknowingly\n\nexchange partners. The film stars Nick Nolte, Lara Flynn Boyle, Johnny Lee\n\nMiller and Julie Christie, who has picked up best actress honors from the\n\nNew York Film Critics Circle, National Society of Film Critics and the San\n\nSebastian International Film Festival.\n\nindieWIRE: You’ve worked primarily in the independent film arena. . .?\n\nAlan Rudolph: That title has been so co-opted and marginalized. I think\n\nthat we should strive to be original and true. You can make a case that the\n\nmost independent American director only works for major studios and that’s\n\nStanley Kubrick. And you can name a dozen movies you saw last year or this\n\nyear that were so-called independents that were totally recut by the\n\nstudios, the “independent” studios that released them. The reason I’m\n\ntrying to debunk this myth is because its become a sales pitch or\n\nsomething. If there is any meaning behind it, it’s seducing a lot of people\n\nto give up their independence so they can call themselves independent. A\n\nlot of these really talented young people are being taught that vision is\n\nwhat you see through a lens. The thing that’s different from when I started\n\nis that film used to be a sharp elbow in society’s ribs. But now it’s like\n\na style.\n\niW: It seems that many of the studio films of the ’70’s placed a stronger\n\nemphasis on “creativity.” Would you agree with this?\n\nRudolph: Absolutely. And John Cassavetes is probably the most prominent\n\nindependent filmmaker because he acted to finance his own films. He made\n\nthem in a way no one else could make them. I would say he, Altman and\n\nScorsese are maybe the only American filmmakers where if you miss the\n\nopening credits, you still know whose film it is.\n\nMy film school was going down to the theater and watching Truffaut, Fellini\n\nand Bergman. I thought wow, I’m learning about life and film. The great\n\nfilms to me are the ones where you walk out and you’re still in them. You\n\ncan’t shake them. And I thought it would go on forever like this. Now I\n\nlook back and it was just a golden age. Now it’s much more a business than\n\nan art. Movies have become merchandising and they’ve also become a\n\ncurrency. Basic Hollywood movies are corporate propaganda and the\n\ncorporation is really attacking our souls and trying to get each of our\n\nidentities. People are going to movies to learn how to behave as human\n\nbeings because they’re so confused now. It would be great if it were Frank\n\nCapra, but instead it’s imitators and imitators of imitators and suddenly\n\npeople are confused.\n\niW: Let’s talk about “Afterglow”. What attracted you to the idea of marital\n\npartner exchange, particularly with such a large age difference?\n\nRudolph: Somehow I got an idea about two couples who didn’t know each other\n\nwhere each meets their opposite. That was the clothes line I could start\n\nhanging things on. You can make a case that this is really about one\n\ncouple. It’s really just a page out of the diary of marriage in general.\n\nThe ups-and-downs, the ins-and-outs, the circles. It’s about love. Where\n\ndoes love exist? Our lives are really more emotional reality than anything\n\nelse, but we’re denied to be able to indulge in that because there’s no\n\ntangibility. I thought I’d make an emotional movie about four people in\n\ndifferent emotional time zones.\n\niW: There are similarities between this film and one of your earlier films,\n\nlike “Choose Me”.\n\nRudolph: This film is intentionally a grown-up cousin of “Choose Me”. It’s\n\non purpose. I didn’t know it at the time, but when I started writing I\n\nsaid, “Wow, I can feel that this is dusting off an old car and getting a\n\nnew paint job.” The thing I wanted to do that is different is I didn’t want\n\nthe film to wink at itself. I wanted to keep the surface realistic. And\n\nthat might have been the influence of working with new actors primarily.\n\niW: This film is a great showcase for Julie Christie.\n\nRudolph: The world would be a better place if there were more Julies in it,\n\nbut thankfully she’s an original. Truly one of the handful of great\n\nactresses ever to work in cinema. She’s got the look, the intelligence, the\n\ndepth and she doesn’t compromise. She doesn’t do anything superficially.\n\nShe’s honest.\n\niW: A prevalent theme in many of your films is the idea of random\n\nencounters leading to unpredictable situations.\n\nRudolph: You can follow anybody around, I don’t care who they are, and\n\ntheir lives are much more like my films than what we perceive to be\n\nrealistic films. The problem with all of this is that we’re taught life the\n\nwrong way. We’re taught that life is what you can control, what you can\n\ndefine, what exists. Life is in the mystery is the way I look at it.\n\niW: How did you like working with the distributor of “Afterglow”, Sony\n\nClassics?\n\nRudolph: I think Sony Classics might be the best distributor I’ve ever\n\ndealt with and they really loved the film. Their releases are modest, but\n\nso is the film. It’s great to work with somebody who gets it and they\n\nappreciate the performers. These guys at Sony Classics, [co-presidents] Tom\n\nBernard, Michael Barker and Marcie Bloom, they basically started what is\n\nthe classics division. They did it originally at United Artists and then at\n\nOrion. They seem to have made a profession out of carving a niche out and\n\ngetting films that are original. And they don’t have a genre they fall back\n\non. It’s not like they also do “Scream” movies or something. Every movie\n\nthey do is an individual film.\n\niW: You’ve always been able to attract relatively big name actors to you\n\nprojects where they’re undoubtedly working for a fraction of what they\n\nnormally make. That says a lot about you as a director. Do you like working\n\nwith actors?\n\nRudolph: Actors are the artists. Their madness is their art. They bring\n\ntheir truth into someone else’s fiction. But actors are the only reason\n\nI’ve been able to survive.\n\niW: Do you mean that by having certain actors attached to your film, you’ve\n\nbeen able to get financing?\n\nRudolph: You can analyze the films I’ve made, not as films, but how they\n\ngot made. They’re all fringe. They were new companies that were just\n\nstarting out or companies right before they went out of business. I’ve\n\ntried to buy into Hollywood a few times. I never sold out, I hope, but\n\nI tried to buy in. In Hollywood, if you’re not a commercial success, you’re\n\na failure. To me, I feel very successful because in the fifteen movies I’ve\n\ndone, on ten or eleven of them no one has told me what to do. I could do\n\nexactly what I wanted. The actors are all the key. One of the skills I’ve\n\nhoned is how to write things that I think actors might like. But it’s the\n\nvery thing that attracts the actor that repels the financial side. That\n\nbeing the layers, the emotions, the dialogue and the fact that there is not\n\na heavy plot. I find that actors get paid a lot of money to react. So\n\nthey’ll work for very little if they like the part.\n\niW: How is it directing the films you’ve written vs. projects that have\n\nbeen handed to you?\n\nRudolph: Well, nobody has ever handed me too many things. I was always the\n\none they called because they couldn’t find anyone and they were in trouble.\n\nThe scripts [for “Songwriter” and “Mortal Thoughts”] were a mess. Not that\n\nthey were bad, it’s just that they had so many hands in them. When I read\n\n“Mortal Thoughts” it didn’t even have the last twenty pages. I said,\n\n“Where’s the end?” They said, “Well, we haven’t gotten around to that.”\n\niW: Didn’t you come on board “Mortal Thoughts” at the very last minute?\n\nRudolph: Yes. The day before shooting. I loved it. I hate preparation. They\n\nwere all in trouble so I knew they wouldn’t bother me for awhile. I knew\n\nI’d get a couple of weeks before anybody got the nerve to even say, “Excuse\n\nme, what if we did this,” because they were so afraid the thing was going\n\nto collapse, on both pictures. I said to both of them, “Just leave me alone\n\nand you’ll get something. We’ll finish on schedule and on budget and there\n\nwill be no problem.” And we did. I had no rights on “Mortal Thoughts”, but\n\nDemi Moore and Bruce Willis stood by me. “Ghost” and “Die Hard 2” came out\n\nwhile we were shooting, so instead of a little six million dollar movie,\n\nwhich we were making, suddenly it was Hollywood’s hottest couple. When they\n\ngave the film to the studio, the head of the studio said, “You did a really\n\nnice job, but we want to reshoot most of this movie and make it romance\n\nbetween Bruce and Demi. She can still kill him in the end, but we want to\n\ntake advantage of who they are.” I said, “You can do what you want but not\n\nwith me” and Demi stood by it. I still think it’s her best performance.\n\niW: Tell me about your next project.\n\nRudolph: I’m going to be shooting Kurt Vonnegut’s story, “Breakfast of\n\nChampions” in February. It only took me about 25 years to get it made.\n\nBruce Willis’s company is going to produce and he’s going to star in it.\n\nIt’s not an opulent production, but it’s something Bruce wants to do."
