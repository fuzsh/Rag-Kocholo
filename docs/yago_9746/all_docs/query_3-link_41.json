        "text": "[on working with Bruce Willis and Demi Moore on Tödliche Gedanken (1991)] I was working with a pair of real life love birds who were trying to kill each other in the film. It was like hanging out with schizophrenics.\n\nYou know, sometimes I feel like I walk around with a target on my back with the films I make.\n\nYou learn real early to make a film and then duck, and basically that's how I go about it.\n\nEver since I was a kid, I just loved those comedians on TV who would just have fun with the language.\n\nSo one of the most unique things on screen in American movies today is everyday behavior.\n\nIt's always been my formula to get the next picture set up before anyone's seen the last one.\n\nHuman identity is the most fragile thing that we have, and it's often only found in moments of truth.\n\nIt's part of the general global hypnotism to accept lies as the new truth.\n\nAnyway, I just haven't been able to find any humanity in any Republican candidate ever in my entire life."
