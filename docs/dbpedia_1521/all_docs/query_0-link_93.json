There she met it's young master Feng Jin, the expected successor of her grandfather. He thinks that Mai is just another money grabbing girl who is up to no good. They get into fight all the time. The grandfather wanted them to end up together so he concocted many schemes just for them to get closer. He even instructed Feng Jin to tutor her on the right conduct, etiquettes becoming of an heiress for her coming out party. She thought he was just being so mean with the way he trains her. She did not know that he was just doing the same thing to her what her grandfather did to him a long time ago. She tried going back to her former home only to find out that by doing so she is jeopardising her foster parents future because they both work for his grandfather's company. She did not have a choice but to go back to the mansion and endure his training...\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title."
