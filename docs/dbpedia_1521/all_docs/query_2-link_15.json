It is adapted from the novel The Concubine's Daughter is Poisonous (庶女有毒; Shùnǚ Yǒudú) by Qin Jian and is a fictionalized account of Emperor Wencheng of Northern Wei's reign and Empress Dowager Feng's regency.[1] The series aired on Dragon TV and Beijing TV from November 11 to December 9, 2016.[2]\n\nThe series received mixed reviews. It was praised for its tight plot and fast storyline and vivid character personas.[3] It was also praised for showcasing the story of growth of a strong and independent female lead, as well as fleshing out the background stories of various supporting characters.[4] Viewership ratings also reached as high as 2%, making it one of the highest rated drama of 2016.[5] However it was criticized for its cliché plot devices, illogical plot details, use of excessive and inappropriate makeup, and dubbing of actors' voices.[6] Investigations and a lawsuit showed that the original novel was heavily plagiarized from other similar stories.[7][8][9] However, the series was nominated for several awards, winning actor and actress awards for both Luo Jin and Tiffany Tang, and Best Chinese Language Drama award at the 5th Annual DramaFever Awards.\n\nIts spin-off sequel, The Song of Glory, aired in July 2020.[10]\n\nSynopsis\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the chaotic Northern and Southern Dynasties, among Northern Liang's royal family lived a princess named Feng Xin'er (Tiffany Tang) who was kind, carefree and loved by all. Chiyun Nan, a marshal from the Chiyun clan of Northern Wei, was driven by greed to overrun Northern Liang and turned it into a bloodbath, killing almost the entire royal family and forcing the princess to survive on her own.\n\nLi Weiyoung, the daughter of the Prime Minister of Northern Wei and his seventh concubine, shielded the princess from harm. However, Weiyoung was killed by the Chiyun family, of which the Prime Minister's first wife, Chiyun Rou, was a member, who were not pleased when she was recalled to the Prime Minister's manor. Xin'er assumed Weiyoung's identity and resided in the manor, where she was disliked and shunned by her older half-sister Li Changle and her mother Chiyun Rou. She thus took it upon herself to fight against the Chiyun clan and became entangled with Northern Wei's prince, Tuoba Jun (Luo Jin). She also attracted the eye of Tuoba Yu (Vanness Wu) who saw her as a chess piece to his ultimate aim of being Emperor. Through her struggles, she gained wisdom and was finally able to find peace for her family while living true to her heart.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nMain\n\n[edit]\n\nTiffany Tang as Li Weiyoung / Feng Xin'er\n\nKind, bright and intelligent, she seeks to investigate the truth after her kingdom is destroyed and her family is assassinated.

An alliance formed by 12 writers, including famed wuxia novelist Woon Swee Oan, joined to sue Qin Jian.[9][38] According to Beijing News, a group of volunteers compared The Poisonous Daughter (Chinese: 庶女有毒) with more than 200 other novels. They found that out of 294 chapters, only nine chapters were original.[7]\n\nOn May 8, 2019, the Chaoyang District People's Court has declared Qin Jian guilty of infringing the works of Shen Wenwen, who wrote the novel 身历六帝宠不衰 that The Poisonous Daughter was copied from. Qin Jian has to compensate Shen Wenwen a total amount of CN¥136,500 ($20,000) for economic loss and intellectual copyright protection within 10 days of the verdict. Moreover, she must immediately cease sales and distribution of the novel upon the day the sentence is handed down.[8]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nInternational broadcast\n\n[edit]\n\n8TV – 21 February 2017 (weekdays, 8:30 p.m.)\n\nMediaCorp Channel 8 – 3 June 2017 (2 episodes back-to-back every Sat, 10:30 p.m.)\n\nTVB Jade – 23 January 2017 (weekdays, 7 p.m.)\n\nChunghwa TV – 19 December 2016 (weekdays, 10 p.m.)\n\nGTV Drama – 8 May 2017 (weekdays, 10 p.m.)\n\nOh!K – Coming Soon (2 episodes back-to-back every Thursday–Saturday, 6 p.m.)\n\nThaiPBS – 13 January 2019 (Sat – Sun 8.15 p.m.)\n\nNTV7 – 4 June 2019 (weekdays, 1 a.m.)\n\nHeart of Asia Channel Philippines - 14 March 2022 (Weekdays, 6 a.m ; replays 6pm) First Chinese Drama Telecast on Digital TV Box\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
