I don't know. It was really weird.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jesse previously admitted to being surprised by the success of 'Modern Family'.\n\nThe actor told Instinct magazine: \"I think we were all prepared to just let it be what it was, and nobody knew that we had something special.\n\n\"We felt that there was a deep connection, and we know that the pilot was very well received, but you never know what’s going to happen next. You never know if the audience is going to stick around. I don’t think it was until the second season after we’ve been nominated for another round of Emmy Awards where it was like, okay, maybe we are here to stay for a while.\""
