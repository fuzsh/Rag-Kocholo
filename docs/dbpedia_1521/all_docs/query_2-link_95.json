        "text": "Japanese stars Oguri Shun (“Godzilla vs. Kong”) and Aoi Yu (“Rurouni Kenshin: Final Chapter Part I – The Final”) are set to reunite on screen after 23 years in “Human Vapor,” a new Netflix series produced in collaboration with Toho. The duo last worked together in 2001’s “Ao to Shiro de Mizuiro.”\n\n“Human Vapor” is a modern reimagining of the 1960 sci-fi thriller of the same name. The original film, directed by Honda Ishirō of “Godzilla” fame, tells the story of a librarian who gains the ability to transform into a gaseous state after being subjected to radiation experiments. Using his newfound powers, he embarks on a series of bank robberies to financially support a struggling dancer he admires. The film is renowned for its exploration of power structures and societal oppression.\n\nYeon Sang-ho, known for “Train to Busan” and “Hellbound,” is set to executive produce and has co-written the script alongside Ryu Yong-jae (“Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area”). Katayama Shinzo, whose credits include “Missing” and “Gannibal,” will direct the series.\n\nThe project marks the first-ever partnership between the streaming giant and the iconic Japanese studio. The series is being made in association with Wow Point.\n\nYeon said: “Among the proposals from Toho, to reimagine the ‘Transforming Human Series’ [a term for genre of the films released by Toho in the 1950s and 1960s, including “The Invisible Avenger” (1954), “The H-Man” (1958) and “The Secret of the Telegian” (1960)] there was ‘The Human Vapor.’ It is a 1960 film, but its sci-fi expressions are still impressively skilful. I believed that if it were reborn with modern visuals, it would be truly fascinating.”\n\nKatayama added: “I was intrigued by its blend of human drama and romantic elements, despite featuring an absurd creature like the Human Vapor. I saw the potential to modernize this classic special effects piece with today’s VFX CG and incorporate human drama to make it a very compelling work.”\n\nThe duo spent about three years working on the script, focusing on updating the story for contemporary audiences while maintaining its core themes. Yeon said: “While it is a sci-fi and thriller, at its core, it is a story about people. We focused on treating human emotions with care and portraying the characters’ humanity through the script.”\n\nKatayama added: “We have received special permission to shoot in locations where filming is usually not allowed. I believe we will deliver visuals that have never been seen before.”\n\n“Human Vapor” joins a growing list of Korean-Japanese collaborations on Netflix, including the upcoming “Romantic Anonymous” (working title) and “Soul Mate.”"
