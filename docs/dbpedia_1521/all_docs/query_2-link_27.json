        "text": "Princess makes your birthday, wedding, honeymoon, anniversary or renewal of vows even more memorable. When you’re onboard a cruise with Princess, you’re surrounded by warm, caring people dedicated to making each day a celebration. And for those times in your life that are special, we’ve created a collection of memorable celebration experiences to help you savor those moments for years and years to come.\n\nIf you or your travel agent advise us of any occasions of particular importance at least 45 days prior to your departure, we’ll set our “special occasion” staff in motion to spotlight your special event in the dining room or with our special packages and fabulous “extra mile” service. You can advise us of your special occasion directly through the MedallionClass® app.\n\nChoose from a selection of our Celebration offerings, with extra touches like flowers, wine and champagne. To order a gift or to plan a special event, review our selections and complete the order form.\n\nAs provided in the Passage Contract, on the day of embarkation, guests are permitted to bring one 750ml bottle of wine or champagne on board per voyage, which will not be subject to a corkage fee if consumed in your stateroom. Additional wine or champagne bottles are welcome, but will incur a US$20/AU$30 (depending on shipboard currency) corkage fee each, irrespective of where they are intended to be consumed. Liquor, spirits, or beers are not permitted. Please remember that luggage will be scanned and alcohol outside of our policy will be removed and discarded.*\n\nAlcoholic beverages that are purchased duty free from The Shops of Princess, or at ports of call, will be collected for safekeeping and delivered to the guest's stateroom on the last day of the cruise. A member of the ship's staff will be at the gangway to assist guests with the storage of their shoreside alcoholic purchases while The Shops of Princess staff will assist guests with shipboard alcoholic purchases.\n\n*Princess is not responsible for any alcoholic beverages removed and discarded by shoreside security staff. Such items are not eligible for monetary refund or replacement. Guests found with prohibited items, including alcohol outside of the policy, may need to collect their luggage at a security checkpoint on board.\n\nKeeping the comfort of our guests a priority, and in consideration of consumer studies which show smokers are a small minority of guests, Princess has implemented the following smoking policy:\n\nDesignated Smoking Areas\n\nClearly marked “Designated Smoking Areas” are available on board and include a sufficient number of ashtrays that are emptied regularly. Generally, these areas include cigar lounges, a section of the nightclub, as well as a portion of the open decks. The Casino and Casino Bar are non-smoking areas on board, with the exception of designated slot machines where guests are permitted to smoke only while playing at those machines. All table games are non-smoking. Show lounges, dining rooms and all food services areas on board all Princess ships are non-smoking. As a safety precaution, guests are reminded to properly dispose of cigarettes, cigars and pipe tobacco, which are never to be thrown overboard as this may be sucked back into the ship and cause fires.\n\nStateroom Smoking Policy\n\nPrincess Cruises prohibits smoking or vaping of all types, including e-cigarettes, in guest staterooms and balconies. This reflects the preferences of a vast majority of our guests who value having their primary living space (both stateroom and balcony) smoke-free. As balconies are a hallmark of Princess Cruises, we believe it is important to keep this peaceful space clear of smoke. Violations to this policy will result in a $250 fine for each occurrence, which will be charged to the guest’s stateroom account. Keeping with the global trend toward more restrictive smoking policies and honoring the wishes of our guests, we feel this enhances our onboard experience.\n\nThe health and well-being of our guests and crew is our highest priority. And there are several measures that meet or exceed standards set by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which are currently in place to prevent and contain illnesses on our ships.\n\nThe simplest way for you to stay healthy is to frequently and thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water, especially before eating and after using the toilet. You'll also find hand sanitizers located throughout the ship for your use after washing your hands.\n\nIf you feel ill during your voyage, please immediately report to the medical center. All of our onboard medical facilities meet or exceed the standards established by the American College of Emergency Physicians. Our onboard medical facilities are staffed by full-time registered doctors and nurses. In addition to twice-daily office hours, they are available 24 hours a day in the event of an emergency.\n\nCharges for medical services will be added to your shipboard account, and you will be provided with an itemized account to submit to your insurance company. Important: Princess ships are registered in Bermuda. Verify with your insurer if your coverage applies outside the United States, or purchase appropriate travel insurance.\n\nIn the event of unexpected travel delays and emergencies, please remember to bring additional prescription medication for at least 2 weeks beyond the length of the cruise. Also bring a list of the names, strengths and dosages of all medications in case refills are required.\n\nThe little extras you find in the best hotels — fresh fruit (by request), available evening bed turn-down, complimentary shampoo, conditioner and body lotion — are provided in every stateroom. Waffle weave cloth bathrobes are available upon request from your stateroom steward for your comfort and convenience.\n\nFor those of you who wish to enjoy a relaxing drink in the privacy of your stateroom, bottles of liquor and stateroom bar packages are available for purchase pre-cruise in Manage Booking at non-duty-free prices through room service. The stateroom directory available on your stateroom television lists a complete menu of offerings.\n\nMini-suites include a welcome glass of sparkling wine, two televisions, a sitting area and a spacious closet, while full suites offer all of these premiums plus complimentary laundry, and use of the Lotus Spa® Thermal Suite (on select ships, excluding Discovery Princess℠, Sky Princess®, Enchanted Princess®, Royal Princess®, Regal Princess®, Majestic Princess®, and Grand Princess®), one-time free mini-bar setup and use of our Disembarkation Lounge.\n\nEach stateroom has other luxuries for your convenience, such as a private safe and refrigerator. In addition, each room is equipped with a 110-volt, 60-cycle alternating current (AC) with standard U.S. plug fittings. Please ask your stateroom steward to check your appliances for suitability before use if you have any questions. All ships are equipped with an electric hair dryer in every stateroom.\n\nStateroom configuration\n\nStaterooms with 3 and 4 berths can be a bunk bed, murphy bed, sofa bed or a rollaway bed. The specific configuration can be confirmed directly through Princess Reservations or your travel agent. Photos, floor plan diagrams, and amenities represent typical arrangements and may vary by ship.\n\nGetting away from it all doesn't mean being out of touch. Every stateroom on Princess ships has its own TV set featuring our state of the art video on demand OceanView® system.*\n\nWe offer live satellite reception of many popular networks. Channel line ups availability may vary between trades based on availability. A wide array of movies and tv programs are also available on demand to watch at your convenience. A large number of live sporting and entertainment events are available across our fleet. For more information on what might be available on your specific voyage, please feel free to contact Princess Guest Services prior to your voyage, or Guest Services once onboard. Princess offers closed-captioning whenever available from our media providers. Please be advised that some international channels do not offer this feature even though it is standard for US channels. Onboard theaters are equipped with assistive listening devices and they can be provided on request. Please check with Guest Services for more information.\n\n*Ship television programming is not guaranteed at all times due to the nature of satellite communications, which are subject to itinerary and possible disruption from weather patterns and various obstructions. Also, Internet access via satellite is significantly slower than high-speed connections on shore.\n\nWe respect our guests' religious beliefs and invite them to practice on their own or with their fellow guests. Guests who wish to lead religious services may volunteer by contacting Guest Services or a member of the Cruise Staff. In some cases, our shipboard staff will lead services. However, Princess does not place clergy on board our vessels.\n\nClergy traveling as Guests onboard our vessels are welcome to conduct services while sailing. They should leave their name, cabin number, and services offered at Guest Services and they will be contacted by a member of the Cruise Director's Staff. Approval of services will be made based on schedule suitability, appropriate onboard supplies, etc. Please bring your Letter of Celebret or Letter of Good Standing with you to provide to the onboard staff.\n\nPlease note that during Passover, there will be a Seder service (including Passover meal) held onboard. For Hanukkah, services are available and will be guest-led with wine, Challah bread, prayers and an electric Menorah (no candles or live flames) provided by Princess. Supplies are present and available for anyone who wants to lead the service at 5:30 PM on Friday evenings.\n\nIf you would like to bring on your own Menorah, you may. However, since candles are prohibited onboard all Princess ships, it must be electric (no live flame).\n\nCRIME PREVENTION AND RESPONSE GUIDE\n\nPrincess has zero tolerance for crime on board its ships. This guide is designed to offer information to all guests on proper response procedures and available law enforcement processes in the event that an incident occurs.\n\nGuests should immediately report missing persons and criminal activity to ship’s personnel so appropriate action may be taken to ensure the safety and security of all persons on board. Timely reporting of an incident is also imperative so that necessary law enforcement notifications can be made as expeditiously as possible. Incidents may be reported at any time by dialing the Purser’s Desk. Missing persons or criminal activity may also be reported to the on board Security Department by dialing the Purser’s Desk. Any situations requiring medical assistance can be reported to the Medical Department at any time by dialing 911 or through the Purser’s Desk.\n\nPrincess reports all missing persons and serious criminal incidents such as homicide, suspicious death, kidnapping, assault with serious bodily injury, sexual assaults as defined by existing laws, firing or tampering with the vessel, or theft of money or property in excess of $10,000 to appropriate law enforcement authorities. In addition to our own reporting policies and other legal requirements, on international voyages that embark or disembark in the United States, U.S. federal law requires Princess to report missing U.S. nationals and the above felonies to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) by telephone as soon as possible, to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security electronically, and to the U.S. Coast Guard in writing. These U.S. requirements apply to all such incidents that occur on board in U.S. territorial waters, or at sea or in another country’s territorial waters if the individuals involved are U.S. nationals. The U.S. FBI may assert criminal jurisdiction in all of these circumstances. Each of the countries visited, as well as the ship’s country of registry (Bermuda), may also assert jurisdiction and impose additional reporting requirements.\n\nFor missing persons or serious criminal incidents that occur within countries visited or their territorial waters, and for incidents within U.S. states, you may independently contact local law enforcement authorities. You may also contact the U.S. FBI or U.S. Coast Guard for incidents that arise at any time during the voyage. Princess encourages all guests to learn as much as you can about the local laws and customs of the places you will visit. Good resources are your library, your travel agents, and the embassies, consulates or tourist bureaus of the countries you will visit. In addition, keep track of what is being reported in the media about recent developments in those countries. Contact information for the FBI, U.S. Coast Guard and the National Sexual Assault Hotline is listed below. Locations of U.S. Embassies or Consulates in the ports visited and contact information for local law enforcement in these ports is listed on your stateroom's TV.\n\nU.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Headquarters, Washington DC\n\n(202) 324-3000\n\nVisit FBI website\n\nU.S. Coast Guard National Command Center\n\n(800) 323-7233\n\nVisit United States Coast Guard website\n\nNational Sexual Assault Hotline\n\nRape, Abuse & Incest National Network\n\n(800) 656-4673\n\nVisit RAINN website\n\nWhat is the minimum age to cruise?\n\nMinimum age requirements:\n\nGuests must be at least 6 months of age at the time of embarkation and at least 12 months of age for trans-atlantic crossings and remote itineraries.\n\nCruisetours: The minimum age for escorted cruisetours is 5 years.\n\nGuests under the age of 21 need to travel in a stateroom with a guest 21 years or older who will assume responsibility for them during the cruise. For family groups booking multiple staterooms, the minimum age for each guest is 16, provided they are traveling with a parent or legal guardian. Unfortunately we are unable to accept group reservations for student or youth groups that do not meet our minimum age requirements.\n\nWhat travel documents do I need to bring for my child?\n\nPassport requirements: Travel document requirements For U.S. and Canadian citizens\n\nWE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT ALL GUESTS TRAVEL WITH A PASSPORT.\n\nDocuments for guests under the age of 18:\n\nSeveral countries require special documentation for children traveling with only one parent or with neither parent, and these requirements can change without notice. Many foreign countries require a single parent or guardian to bring a permission slip for the minor to travel abroad. It’s your responsibility to ensure you have the proper documents for all of the countries you’ll visit. Please verify requirements with the consulates of these countries prior to your cruise.\n\nWhat other supplies should I bring for my children?\n\nHere are some recommendations:\n\nTravel documents\n\nChild's airline tickets or e-tickets\n\nChild's passport, visa and other proof of citizenship\n\nNotarized statements from spouse/ex-spouse if traveling alone with kids under 18\n\nNotarized forms if traveling with grandchildren/kids under 18 who aren't your own\n\nPediatrician's name and phone numbers (daytime and emergency)\n\nChild’s ID card (optional)\n\nMedicines & sundries\n\nChild's prescription drugs or other important medication (in carry-on bag)\n\nChildren’s Benadryl\n\nAntibiotic cream\n\nAnti-itch cream\n\nChildren's anti-diarrhea medication\n\nBand-Aids\n\nChildren's Tylenol, Advil, Aleve and/or aspirin\n\nPedialyte\n\nSun protection – sunscreen, sunburn gel, hat\n\nAntibacterial hand sanitizer\n\nChildren's insect repellant\n\nInfant/child's thermometer\n\nDrops/antibiotics for eye and ear infections\n\nBaby/toddler items\n\nDiapers (Parents are given special waste bags for diapers, which are removed daily from cabins.)\n\nBaby wipes\n\nPacifiers\n\nDiaper rash ointment\n\nZiploc bags (many for diapers and other messes)\n\nSippy cups and plastic bottles (keep one in your carry-on)\n\nBaby formula\n\nPortable crib if needed\n\nStroller: umbrella strollers are most convenient\n\nBibs\n\nDiaper bag\n\nOther handy items\n\nNightlight\n\nSmall flashlight\n\nFavorite stuffed animals, toys and travel games\n\nInflatable swim aids\n\nOnboard Activities\n\nWhat is there for kids and teens to do with and without supervision on board?\n\nOur Camp Discovery Youth Program for kids ages 3-12 will keep little ones entertained all day and evening. To participate independently, children must be age 3+ and potty trained. Our youth centers are operated by experienced staff, dedicated to keeping our youngest guests safe and happy. Our Beach House Teen Lounge is available for teens ages 13-17, with fun activities hosted by our staff.\n\nFamily activities include festivals, entertainment, Discovery at SEA experiences such as Stargazing, dining events and, of course, Movies Under the Stars®. Each cruise may have slightly different programs. Please contact us with any questions or reservations for specific childcare and family activities.\n\nWhat movies are shown? I’m selective about what movies my kids watch.\n\nIn the Camp Discovery Youth Program, we show G and PG-rated movies. At the Beach House, teens view G, PG and PG 13 rated movies. Stateroom TVs feature several categories, including a family/kids section. Movies Under the Stars offers family-friendly options throughout your cruise. Check the JourneyView® planner for viewing times.\n\nWill my family like cruising?\n\nPrincess offers something for everyone. Taking a cruise is an adventure for family members of all ages: The range of onboard activities is sure to please your toddler, teenager and mother-in-law alike. There are activities and dining options for the most adventurous and the simplest eater in your household. You can choose to be as active or relaxed as you feel like that day. And there’s entertainment for everyone, from Movies Under the Stars® to Broadway-caliber musical productions. On a cruise with Princess you have experiences to share as well as the opportunity and space to do your own thing.\n\nWhat about “me time” for adults?\n\nWe want parents to enjoy their vacations too. Drop off your kids in Camp Discovery during the day (it's free!) so you can explore ashore, visit the Lotus Spa® or read a book in The Sanctuary. Want a date night, perhaps taking in a movie or playing in the casino? For a small fee, we offer babysitting in the evening hours.\n\nCan my kids go on shore excursions with me?\n\nAbsolutely. Discovery™ and Animal Planet™ tours are good places to start. Every excursion designates appropriate age ranges, as well as the level of activity to be expected. If you’d rather explore on your own, your child can stay on board at Camp Discovery with our youth staff while in port. Our Beach House Teen Lounge will also be open so your teen can hang out with us should they decide not to go ashore.\n\nHow do I coordinate with others in our travel party if we’ve booked separately?\n\nFriends and family often travel together, so this is a common concern. The first thing to do is to call 1-800-PRINCESS or your travel consultant to link your group’s reservations. Secondly, be sure to use our Princess@Sea app to communicate on board via text messaging for supreme convenience. For MedallionClass® ships, you’ll be able to locate your group anywhere on the ship using your personal device through our OceanCompass™ app.\n\nHow can I plan a birthday (or another celebration) on board?\n\nLet us know about your special occasions in Manage Booking, and we’ll prepare a festive welcome aboard note. You can also order celebration packages there, everything from fun gifts to unique experiences on board. If the celebration is for one of your children, notify the Youth Staff, and they’ll be happy to collaborate with ideas.\n\nIs there a dedicated space for kids?\n\nThe Princess Youth and Teen Programs feature onboard clubs, each with activities designed for their specific age range:\n\nCamp Discovery – Ages 3-12\n\nThe Treehouse – 3 to 7 years old (formerly Pelicans)\n\nThe Lodge – 8 to 12 years old\n\nCamp Discovery – Ages 3-12\n\nThe Beach House – 13 to 17 years old (formerly Remix)\n\nRegistered participants are required to participate in the program designated for their age.\n\nIn partnership with Discovery Communications, Princess has developed engaging youth programming and wonder-filled center designs for cruises ages 3 to 17.\n\nCamp Discovery\n\nThe Treehouse – 3 to 7 years old\n\nThis bright, whimsical, forest-themed center for children features hands-on activities and programs surrounded by captivating creatures.\n\nAt the Treehouse they'll design Klutz art projects like paper airplanes and charm bracelets, learn how to protect furry creatures through Animal Planet and our Endangered Species program, and uncover their inner buccaneer on Pirate Night.\n\nThe Lodge – 8 to 12 years old\n\nInspired by the great outdoor, this cozy center is filled with sports activities and comfortable places for kids to explore, hang out and lounge.\n\nWhile visiting the Lodge, they will engage their minds and muscles while building rockets, experimenting through MythBusters challenges, taking part in Miniature Olympics, and diving into destinations with programs like Shark Hunters, an interactive scavenger hunt to uncover the mystery of sharks living in the Caribbean.\n\n*Children must be at least 3 years old and toilet trained to participate independently. Children ages 3-7 must be signed in and out by a parent or person authorized by the parent(s). Children ages 8-12 may sign themselves in and out with parent approval.\n\nJust for Teens\n\nThe Beach House – 13 to 17 years old\n\nThis contemporary beach-themed lounge is \"the\" place for teens to hang out, socialize and connect.\n\nThere are plenty of options to enjoy – video game tournaments, movie nights, skeeball fun, dance classes, a VIP party complete with red carpet, or (a teen favorite) just hanging out.\n\nCamp Discovery reimagines out youth centers, formerly known as The Fun Zone, while The Beach House refreshes our teen lounges. These new spaces build on our already existing family activities, providing more opportunities for guests to create moments they will always remember. In addition to the new changes, families can sign their crew up for trivia and talent shows, try new regional foods together during dinnertime, play games at carnival in the Piazza, and head to Movies Under the Stars for Family Movie Night. With Camp Discovery, The Beach House, and our enriching programs and entertainment, Princess makes family-friendly sailing easy.\n\n*Teens can come and go from the center as they please, with no sign in/out required. However, parents can restrict this privilege for their child at anytime.\n\nWho operates the youth centers?\n\nOur team of experienced youth staff undergo stringent background checks and must be recently certified in CPR and basic first aid. In case of a true medical emergency, onboard medical staff are just a phone call away.\n\nCan adults visit the youth centers?\n\nWe’re happy for parents and others to join in the fun. In fact, we offer an open house event on embarkation day for loved ones to take a peek at all the fun. For the safety and security of our young guests, we only allow adults in our centers who have children participating in the program. If the center is full, we may ask parents to come back at another time.\n\nHow do I register my child for the youth program?\n\nIt’s simple. Register through Manage Booking, or you can come directly to the youth center to meet the team. We look forward to showing you around and telling you about our program. FYI: Participation in our program cannot be guaranteed, especially on cruises with lots of families, but we’ll make every effort to include everyone we can. Hours of operation are subject to change.\n\nWhere can I find a schedule of activities for kids?\n\nYou can find this information in JourneyView®. Get the Patter and schedule of events in the centers from the Youth Staff.\n\nWhat if there’s an emergency at sea?\n\nRest easy: Your crew is fully trained to respond to emergencies, following strict protocols. If the issue is medical, there’s a fully operational clinic on board, equipped to treat more than just seasickness. Youth staff members are certified in CPR and basic first aid and have experience accommodating everything from allergies to special needs.\n\nDo onboard pools have age or height restrictions?\n\nParents must supervise their children at all times when using the pools, as there are no lifeguards on duty. Because of U.S. public health restrictions, children in diapers, even swim diapers, may not use the pools.\n\nDo you have safety floatation devices for the children who are unable to swim?\n\nNo, but parents are welcome to bring their own inflatable safety floating devices appropriate for their child’s age and weight.\n\nHow can I communicate with my kids on board?\n\nOn Princess MedallionClass® ships, we offer tracking that lets you know where your child is at any time, thanks to the complimentary, wearable device known as the OceanMedallion™. Also through the MedallionClass® app, you can chat/text with your kids, anywhere on board.\n\nAre there age restrictions in general on the ship?\n\nYes, children must be accompanied by an adult when:\n\nThey’re under 18 and want to use the spa, sauna or steam room\n\nThey’re under 16 and want to use the fitness centers\n\nGuests must be at least 18 to:\n\nReceive body treatments in the spa. (Other services are okay, if a parent accompanies them).\n\nPlay in our casinos\n\nVisit the night club after 11 p.m.\n\nTake note, we’re mindful of the drinking age for the places we sail, which is:\n\n21+ in the U.S.\n\n20+ in Japan\n\n18+ in Europe, Australia, China and Singapore\n\nWhat if I've forgotten something?\n\nOf course! We’re happy to accommodate special arrangements before you embark or while on board the ship. If you want to request certain items, i.e. a portable crib, please call 1-800-774-6237 (1-800-PRINCESS) or visit Manage Booking in advance. Many items, such as high chairs and boosters, can be requested once on board by calling the Guest Services Desk. (Quantities are limited.)\n\nCan I purchase baby supplies on board?\n\nWe recommend buying baby supplies before embarking on your voyage. Only some ships have diapers/wipes on board for purchase. Jarred baby food, Stages 1 & 2, can be requested in advance through Manage Booking. Fresh pureed fruits and vegetables can also be requested in the main dining rooms.\n\nWho should I inform if my child has special needs?\n\nSimply go to the MedallionClass® app. Under your OceanProfile® click on the “accessibility & dietary requirements” tab. Dietary restrictions and food allergies can be added in the MedallionClass® app or sent to dietaryrequest@princesscruises.com.\n\nWhen registering for our Camp Discovery Youth and Teen Programs, please add any information you feel would assist our staff in accommodating your child. As part of the registration, there is a section to complete regarding allergies, special needs, medical conditions and more. Our team is happy to provide accommodations to ensure your child has a great experience in our youth centers.\n\nWho should I inform about my child’s allergies or medical condition?\n\nAlso in the MedallionClass® app, under your OceanProfile® click on “accessibility & dietary requirements\". These notations will notify all restaurants on the ship about food allergies, and special accommodations will be made to keep your family safe. For your added peace of mind, our onboard medical facilities are staffed by full-time registered doctors and nurses. In addition to twice-daily office hours, they are available 24 hours a day in case of an emergency.\n\nHow do I reserve a portable crib?\n\nCall 1-800-PRINCESS to reserve ahead of time, or request one from your cabin steward once on board. Cribs are provided on a first-come, first-serve basis. You are always welcome to bring your own travel crib.\n\nEvery Princess ship is equipped with an advanced cellular communications network. This network allows you to send as well as receive voice calls, text messages and data services on your personal mobile device. Mobile device service is available for use when the ship is at sea, in international waters and in other areas where such use is permitted. All charges will be conveniently billed to you by your mobile device provider.\n\nYour wireless provider must have a roaming agreement with Wireless Maritime Services (WMS) in order for you to use your mobile phone with this service. Your mobile device must be able to roam internationally, and international roaming must be enabled on your device. If you have a prepaid device, please confirm with your wireless carrier if you are able to use it at sea; not all prepaid devices are supported.\n\nRates for cellular service at sea are determined by your wireless carrier. For questions about your service while cruising, including cruise packages offered, pricing or billing, please contact your wireless provider's customer service department.\n\nFor additional information and tips on using your cellular while cruising visit cellularatsea.com\n\nIf you encounter unforeseen flight or weather-related delays on sailing day, we suggest you immediately advise an airline representative at the airport that you are a cruise guest destined for sailing that day. Typically, airlines are able to arrange alternative flights at the airline counter for passengers to continue with their travel to the point of embarkation. It is the airline’s responsibility to make alternate flight arrangements resulting from a delay or cancellation.\n\nIn the event costs are incurred, you are responsible for out of pocket expenses. If you have purchased travel protection, costs incurred as a result of trip delay are likely to be covered by Trip Delay protection. Please ensure to keep all receipts for submission and contact your travel plan administrator for assistance and clarification.\n\nIf your delay involves missing the ship in the port of embarkation, you must immediately contact the En Route Desk to confirm that you will be permitted to join the vessel at the next port of call. In certain instance, you will not be permitted to join the vessel at the next port, if the late embarkation will result in a violation of the Passenger Vessel Services Act (PVSA).\n\nUpon learning your new flight arrangements, we ask that you immediately contact Princess with your new flight information for our records. You may call us toll-free at 800-545-0008. This special number is operational only in the United States and Canada.\n\nOutside of the United States and Canada you may reach us at 661-284-4410. Within Australia, use 13 24 88. Princess representatives are available to answer this emergency en route line from\n\n5 a.m. - 8 p.m. Pacific Time, Monday through Friday, and 5 a.m. - 5 p.m. Pacific Time, Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAfter hours support is available in the event of “en route” delays. These calls will be routed to our customer service centers in Australia or the United Kingdom, subject to the time of call. Our representatives will record your new flight information into your booking record.\n\nIf your checked baggage is delayed or misdirected by a common carrier, immediately report this to the carrier. Once you arrive onboard, report this delay to the Passenger Services Desk, providing the claim number and bag description.\n\nAs a courtesy, the onboard staff will assist in following up with the airline; however, any costs incurred in forwarding the luggage to the ship is at the guest’s expense.
