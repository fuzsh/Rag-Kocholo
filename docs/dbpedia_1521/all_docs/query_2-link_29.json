Have an account? .\n\nElizabeth Debicki stars as Princess Diana in the final season of Netflix's \"The Crown.\"\n\nKristen Stewart received a best actress Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Princess Diana.\n\nEmma Corrin won a Golden Globe for their portrayal of Diana in the fourth season of \"The Crown.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1982, Caroline Bliss played the new princess in a TV movie about the royal wedding.\n\nJust 14 months after the royal wedding, ABC released ''Charles & Diana: A Royal Love Story,\" a dramatic retelling of King Charles and Princess Diana's wedding at St. Paul's Cathedral in London.\n\nBliss played the role of Diana \"with reasonable accuracy,\" according to The New York Times in 1982.\n\nThe publication went on to explain that the \"script for the ABC opus did attempt to make brief references to certain pressing realities\" when compared to the other network movie that came immediately after.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same year, CBS released a similar TV movie about the royal wedding, with Catherine Oxenberg playing the role of Princess Diana.\n\nJust a few weeks after ABC's movie, CBS released a similar film titled, ''The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana,\" which also chronicled the royal wedding.\n\n\"The CBS film, unfortunately, makes her something of a Pollyanna, or a Cinderella — a sweet innocent sprite upon whom a fairy godmother bestowed a few crucial wishes,\" The Washington Post wrote in 1982 about the portrayal of Diana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNicola Formby played Princess Diana in \"The Women of Windsor\" in 1992.\n\nCBS aired \"The Women of Windsor\" in 1992 to tell the story of Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, both of whom married into the royal family.\n\nIn this TV movie, Formby took on the role of Diana, which Variety called an overall flat character. Sallyanne Law played Ferguson.\n\n\"'The Women of Windsor' is a good-looking but unabsorbing rehash of the marriages of the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of York,\" Variety's Patricia O'Connell wrote in 1992.\n\n\"Two of the main exposition devices — voice-over from a reporter and newspaper front pages — are a poor substitute for fully developed characters and interaction between them.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSerena Scott Thomas took on the titular role in NBC's 1993 biopic, \"Diana: Her True Story.\"\n\nBased on the bestselling novel by Andrew Morton, NBC's film adaptation was meant to be an inside look at the royal couple's rocky and volatile relationship.\n\nIn 1983, Entertainment Weekly rated the movie a B+, explaining that the director was able to make a \"classy-looking movie about a distinctly un-classy aspect of the British upper class.\"\n\nThe publication also wrote that Scott Thomas played Diana with \"great charm\" but did not resemble the \"angular princess.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1996, Julie Cox was cast as Diana in the CBS movie \"Princess in Love,\" which told the story of her reported affair.\n\nBased on the bestselling book, \"Princess in Love\" was a CBS film that chronicled Diana's extramarital affair with her former riding instructor.\n\nCox played the princess after signing onto the project just a few days before filming began, People reported.\n\n\"Cox is no body double for Di, being brunette (they dyed her hair) and, at 5'4″ — six inches shorter,\" People wrote in 1996.\n\n\"And she's oblivious to Windsor-mania. She never read the book, she says, because 'I thought I would hate it. I thought, If I read it, I'll have a hard time taking the script seriously.'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA year after Princess Diana died in 1997, \"Diana: A Tribute to The People's Princess\" aired with Amy Seccombe in the lead role.\n\n\"Diana: A Tribute to The People's Princess\" showcased the final year of Diana's — played by lookalike Seccombe — life, highlighting her relationship with Dodi Fayed and her relationship with her two children, according to Radio Times.\n\nThe film culminates with the car accident that killed Diana and Fayed in 1997.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTLC made a dramatic documentary in 2007 about Diana's final days. Genevieve O'Reilly played the princess in a series of reenactments.\n\n\"Diana: Last Days of a Princess\" was billed a docu-drama, mixing real-life interviews with those close to her and dramatic reenactments of the days leading up to the car accident.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, O'Reilly's portrayal was a realistic one.\n\n\"'Diana' doesn't deify the princess,\" the publication wrote in 2007. \"It portrays her as needy but manipulative, loving but flawed — in other words, as a human being. Blending documentary techniques and scripted drama, it gives a surprisingly credible picture of the princess's last summer.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2013, Naomi Watts played the royal in \"Diana,\" which concentrated on her relationship with Hasnat Khan.\n\n\"Diana\" premiered in theaters in 2013 to poor reviews, earning an 8% Rotten Tomatoes score.\n\nBut The New York Times said Watts' performance was one of the best parts.\n\n\"Anchored by Ms. Watts's sympathetic performance, it humanizes the woman behind the smile, the helmet hair, and the myth,\" the publication wrote in 2013.\n\nWatts told The Daily Mail that she felt like she connected with Diana's spirit while filming the movie.\n\n\"There were definitely moments when I felt Diana's presence — I dreamed about her a lot, too, and that's a first,\" Watts told the publication in 2013. \"I kept wondering to myself: 'Would she have liked it?' So I found myself constantly asking for her permission to carry on.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBonnie Soper played Princess Diana in two Lifetime movies: \"Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance\" and \"Harry & Meghan: Becoming Royal.\"\n\n\"Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance\" premiered on Lifetime in 2018 and followed Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's new relationship, while \"Harry & Meghan: Becoming Royal\" debuted in 2019 and followed the couple's first year in marriage.\n\nAlthough the actors who played Harry and Meghan changed between movies, Soper played Princess Diana in flashback scenes in both movies.\n\n\"I didn't pay attention to the whole Royal scene — I was a little southern girl,\" Soper told Stuff in 2018.\n\n\"However, I do very much recall seeing her in the magazines and seeing this woman hounded by the press. I remember being very interested in her. Then of course, with the accident, I remember being shocked like the rest of the world and feeling sad, so sad.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeanna de Waal played the princess in the Broadway musical about her life, which was filmed for Netflix.\n\n\"Diana: The Musical\" premiered in 2021 on Netflix just weeks before the same show debuted on Broadway, which closed in December 2021 after lackluster reviews, reported The New York Times.\n\nThe musical follows Diana from the moment she meets Charles up until her untimely death.\n\nJeanna de Waal originated the titular role in San Diego before the show opened on Broadway in March 2020. It closed down due to the coronavirus pandemic, and then the cast came together again to film for the Netflix movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKristen Stewart played Princess Diana in the critically acclaimed movie \"Spencer,\" which premiered in November 2021.\n\n\"Spencer\" follows Diana during one weekend with the royal family at Sandringham just before she decides to end her marriage to Charles.\n\nStewart was praised for her commitment to the role and to perfecting the royal's unique accent.\n\n\"The accent is intimidating as all hell because people know that voice, and it's so, so distinct and particular,\" Stewart told InStyle in October 2020. \"I'm working on it now and already have my dialect coach.\"\n\nStewart received a best actress Oscar nomination for \"Spencer\" and won a Satellite Award for best actress in a drama motion picture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmma Corrin played a young Princess Diana in the fourth season of Netflix's \"The Crown.\"\n\n\"The Crown,\" which recounts the life of Queen Elizabeth across her unprecedented 70-year reign, dove into the Charles and Diana storyline in its fourth season.\n\nCorrin played the role of the budding royal alongside Josh O'Connor, who played a young King Charles.\n\n\"Emma's doing a brilliant job, and it's breathtakingly accurate; [they] looked the spitting image, and it's kind of extraordinary,\" O'Connor told Harper's Bazaar in 2019. \"So that's kind of spooky.\"\n\nCorrin won a Golden Globe in 2021 for the performance and was nominated for an Emmy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nPrincess Diana TV Movie\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement"
