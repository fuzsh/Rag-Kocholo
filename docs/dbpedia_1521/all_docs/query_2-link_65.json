        "text": "The Crown proves that Princess Margaret was a truly fascinating character—a witty, charismatic, rebellious, and glamorous woman with tremendous star power and an ever-present cigarette. Had she been born to another family, she may have found happiness. But Princess Margaret’s birth order and place restricted her to her sister’s long shadow and archaic constitutional constraints. She rebelled against the crown—hence her nickname, “The Royal Rebel”—but declined to forfeit its privileges for her first love, Peter Townsend. Thus, she spent the rest of her years an unpredictable, unfulfilled, and incredibly spoiled prisoner, dependent on the shackles she so deeply resented, and unapologetic in her royal demands.\n\nThough her life was tragic, it was never boring. When Margaret died in 2002, she left behind a litany of stories and anecdotes which—whether true or not—are vastly entertaining. They characterize her as a queen in the best, gives-the-least-fucks sense of the word.\n\nAs popular Margaret lore goes, the princess was seated next to 60s supermodel Twiggy at a dinner party. The royal proceeded to ignore her seatmate until, about two hours later, Margaret turned to the model and asked, “And who are you?”\n\nTwiggy replied, “I’m Lesley Hornby, ma’am, but people call me Twiggy.”\n\nMargaret responded, “How unfortunate,” and turned away again.\n\nSo committed to her dual vices—whiskey and cigarettes—was Margaret that the memoir Ma’am Darling: 99 Glimpses of Princess Margaret alleges that Margaret “tried to combine the smoking and drinking by gluing matchboxes onto tumblers, so she could strike matches while drinking.”\n\nPrincess Margaret was notoriously late for any and all occasions. In 1959, the acclaimed English novelist Nancy Mitford wrote her mother a letter after an eventful dinner hosted in Margaret’s honor in Paris.\n\n“Dinner was at 8:30, and at 8:30 Princess Margaret’s hairdresser arrived, so we waited for hours while he concocted a ghastly coiffure,” Mitford wrote, according to Theo Aronson’s biography Princess Margaret, from U.K. publisher Thistle Publishing. “She looked like a huge ball of fur on two well-developed legs. Shortest dress I ever saw—a Frenchman said it begins so low and ends so soon.”\n\nIn 1986, Rupert Everett went to the theater with Princess Margaret and her lady-in-waiting.\n\n“I never got asked again, I must say. She didn’t realize that there were two princesses there; one of them was me,” Everett recalled on The Graham Norton Show. His first faux pas of the evening, he said, was failing to light her cigarette.\n\n“She was like the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland. She had huge black hair, the Hanoverian bosom, and her breasts rattled like castanets—I don’t know what was going on. She had cigarettes about this long,” Everett said, gesturing about two feet in front of him. “When we were getting in the car, she said, ‘Hey, you’ve got marvelous legs.’ And then she called me Leggy all night. ‘Leggy, do you mind if I grab you at the end of the second act?’”\n\nDuring intermission, Everett excused himself to use the bathroom. But Margaret could not be bothered to wait. “She banged on the [bathroom] door and went, ‘Come on, Leggy!’”\n\n“I spent the whole of the second act without having a pee.”\n\nAfter a party at Kensington Palace for Marlene Dietrich, Princess Margaret “was furious to find that four bottles of very rare vodka, which had been given to her, had disappeared,” wrote Aronson in Princess Margaret. “With that streak of royal parsimony that goes hand in hand with her extravagance, she spent the whole of the following morning ringing round until she had tracked down the culprit. The bottles were returned.”\n\n“One night, at a ball given by the celebrated hostess, Lady Rothermere, the Princess ‘grabbed the microphone from the startled leader of the band, whom she instructed to play songs by Cole Porter,’” wrote Aronson in Princess Margaret. “Obediently, all the guests stopped dancing and stood listening to the Princess’s performance. As they ‘shouted and roared for more’ she became, says Lady Caroline Blackwood, who was watching, ‘a little manic,’ with her swaying, full-skirted ball gown proving quite unsuitable for her ‘slinky’ gyrations.”\n\nIN CONVERSATION\n\nThe Crown’s Vanessa Kirby on Margaret’s Rebellious Marriage\n\nThe actress discusses The Crown’s second season, her dream of a Margaret spin-off, and meeting Margaret’s lady-in-waiting.\n\nTHE CROWN\n\nWhy The Crown Cut Its Princess Margaret Sex Scene\n\nIt would have featured Margaret with her future husband, Antony Armstrong-Jones.\n\nTHE CROWN\n\nThe Crown’s Season 3: What to Expect\n\nAn ugly divorce for Margaret, an introduction to Camilla Parker Bowles, and more.\n\nTHE CROWN\n\nThe Crown: Princess Margaret’s Rebound Romance Previewed\n\nVanessa Kirby and Matthew Goode star as Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon in The Crown’s second season, debuting December 8.\n\nIn Real Life\n\nThe Crown: The Real Story of Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon’s Doomed Romance\n\nThe love story of Princess Margaret, Elizabeth’s younger sister, and Antony Armstrong-Jones, was just as dramatic in real life as what’s depicted on The Crown’s second season.\n\nRoyals\n\nCrown Prince Hussein and Princess Rajwa Introduce a New Royal Baby to the World\n\n“Our family has never been happier,” said Hussein’s mother, Queen Rania of Jordan, after the birth of Princess Iman, her first grandchild.\n\nCelebrity\n\nTaylor Swift Fans Are in Their Voting Era as Elizabeth Warren Joins Swifties for Kamala Kickoff\n\nCarole King surprised viewers with a rendition of “Shake It Off,” politicians shared their favorite tracks, Sen. Ed Markey told us all about “kahhhhh-ma,” and the group raised over $100K in just a few hours.\n\nRoyals\n\nPrincess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice Went on a Royal Girls’ Trip\n\nTo celebrate her sister’s 36th birthday, Eugenie shared a few never-before-seen photos of a trip to Saudi Arabia."
