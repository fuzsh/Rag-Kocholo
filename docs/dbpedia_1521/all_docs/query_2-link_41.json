Customize your dining time for each day, whether making reservations for the main dining room (which is included) or specialty restaurants (which charge a small cover charge). Have dinner at the same time each night or change it based on what works for you. Once on board, you can order food and drinks for delivery wherever you are through OceanNow® ordering. More options at your fingertips means less time waiting and more time to dine your way*.\n\n*Reservation times based on venue capacity and availability. Additional charge applies for OceanNow delivery."
