        "text": "The Princess of Wales last month received a standing ovation from the entire Wimbledon arena at the men's singles final in what marked her second public appearance this year following her shock cancer diagnosis.\n\nThe mother-of-three in June stunned crowds when she first appeared on the balcony at Trooping the Colour in honour of her father-in law King Charles’ birthday.\n\nFormer royal butler Grant Harrold on Tuesday said Kate boosted not only her own morale but the nation’s too, in making her celebrated return to the spotlight.\n\n“There was a huge buzz at Trooping the Colour. I witnessed the excitement when the carriage came out of the Palace,” Mr Harrold said on behalf of Spin Genie.\n\n“You could see it caused a lot of buzz and joy around the British public.\n\n“I think the energy of the public has increased because they were thrilled to see her there.\n\nThe insider, who worked for King Charles and Queen Camilla from 2004 through 2011, said Kate’s third return to working life hinges on the success of her treatment.\n\n“Whether she’ll return to more duties depends on how well she is, but when she is seen in public, it does cause a lot of excitement which is great for her, as it will give her a boost, and it’s great for the morale of the nation,” he said.\n\nThe Princess in January underwent planned abdominal surgery at The London Clinic and, in a video message in March, she sent shockwaves around the world as she revealed the operation detected an undisclosed type of cancer.\n\nAt the time Kate had not been seen at royal duties since Christmas Day last year, nearly six months before Trooping the Colour.\n\nOn whether she returned to royal duties because of her devotion to royal life or for her love of the family, it was both, according to Harrold.\n\n“Kate has got a huge sense of duty, just like the late Queen did. There have been plenty of comparisons between the late Queen and Prince Philip and the Prince and Princess of Wales,” he said.\n\n“She would’ve returned because of duty and the love of the family.\n\n“She also wants the British public and Commonwealth to see she is as good as she can be and is getting on with life, just as millions of other people have to.\n\n“She’s trying to carry on with as much of normal life as possible, which includes her royal duties.”\n\nThe Princess and her husband Prince William along with their three children Prince George, 11, Princess Charlotte, nine, and Prince Louis, six, will reportedly spend the remainder of the summer “below the radar” at their home in Norfolk.\n\nThey are not expected to travel abroad but will visit King Charles and Queen Camilla at Balmoral in Scotland in August.\n\nIt’s not yet confirmed which other Royal Family members will be invited to Balmoral this summer, but the offer from the monarch could even extend to Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex."
