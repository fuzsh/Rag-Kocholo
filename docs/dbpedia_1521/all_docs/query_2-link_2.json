        "text": "almost the same storyline, with a long-lost granddaughter of a rich chairman. also the 3 modern princes like of the company. also one of the main character is the same between these two drama.\n\n1 Recommended by XinHuiDa29\n\nin both dramas the story talks about four guys and girl and in both cases the girl canâ€™t accept the situation right away, but at the end she falls in love with one of the guys!!!\n\n0 Recommended by Lucy21\n\nLong lost granddaughter found by her grandparent and she apparently seem to be some sort of a princess/rich etc etc etc\n\n0 Recommended by izsua\n\nEver since I saw the trailer of Half a Fairy Tale, the music and the feeling reminded me of Romantic Princess. I know the drama did not start yet, but i already can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n0 Recommended by EvesSecret\n\nAdopted by middle classed parents, Xiao Mai has always had a dream to be an heiress. Who knew that one day this dream would come true. Xiao Mai's biological grandfather is the head of a prestigous aristocratic family and after many years of searching, he finally finds his long lost granddaughter. As she starts her life as an heiress, everyday is filled with excitement, however, everything seems a bit different from what she had imagined them to be.\n\n0 Recommended by 4chukyunz1302\n\nIts got the basic storyline of girl finds herself suddenly rich after being poor. Nothing is like what she expects it to be and she finds herself in some pretty interesting situations.\n\n0 Recommended by MoonBunny\n\nThis drama is similar in ways where we have a rich heiress who's beautiful and strong. Then you also have the hot male protagonist that obviously ends up being the prince. It's cliché, funny and sweet too.\n\n0 Recommended by SiennaNgo\n\nThey are both about a girl chasing her dream and she some how ended up living with four handsome guys I personally loved romantic princess it was fun and sweet\n\n2 Recommended by donya1996"
