        "text": "Ranked By\n\n9.7K votes\n\n3.2K voters\n\nVoting Rules\n\nVote on the royalty-themed romance anime you'd recommend to others.\n\nThere's something so fascinating about the lives of royalty. Whether they're enacting sweeping political changes or simply dealing with messy private lives, their existence is outside of the realm of most people's reality. That's why their romantic lives can be so interesting - especially when they're anime characters.\n\nFor this list, we're counting down some of the best royal romance anime out there. Snow White with the Red Hair is a beloved, well-known anime about an herbalist who falls in love with a prince. But there are other great series that aren't quite as well-known, like Endo and Kobayashi Live! The Latest on Tsundere Villainess Lieselotte, an anime that turns the isekai concept on its head. While some of the shows on this list are great anime about princesses or kings, there are some with other anime royalty like dukes or barons.\n\nSo, what are the best royal anime shows? You can decide. Vote on your favorite anime series that involve royalty below!\n\nLatest additions: The Apothecary Diaries\n\nOver 3.2K Ranker voters have come together to rank this list of The 18 Best Romance Anime That Involve Royalty\n\nAfter being pushed off a building and falling to her death, Rinko is reborn into a romance novel. Now as Raeliana, she still remembers her past life, including how this story goes. It's a riveting romance but she's not the protagonist - in fact, the story starts with Raeliana being killed by her fiancé. Aware of this, Raeliana decides she's going to use all her insider knowledge about the characters to change her fate.\n\nTo start, she blackmails Duke Noah Wynknight into marriage.\n\nMaomao is the daughter of a talented apothecary, but is forced to work as a maid for the emperor. She intends to make her escape from the palace and finally make her own way in life until the emperor’s young children become ill. There seems to be a more sinister situation afoot, and Maomao tries to lend her aid in secret, but gets singled out quickly by the emperor's brother Jinshi.\n\nAfter her apothecary skills are recognized she's promoted to a lady-in-waiting. As her own talents develop, she proves herself to be less and less expendable, and continues to catch Jinshi's eye.\n\nShirayuki is a commoner who narrowly escapes being forced into becoming her nation's king's concubine by the prince of a neighboring country, Zen Wistalia of Clarines. She ends up moving to Clarines in order to work as a palace herbalist.\n\nDespite her acquaintance with the prince, Shirayuki doesn't want special treatment - she wants to earn whatever she gets. But the rest of the kingdom doesn't see her that way - they think of her as a gold digger trying to scam the prince. Meanwhile, she's actually falling in love with him - and he's feeling the same way.\n\nEver since she was a little girl, Yona has enjoyed the life of a pampered princess. But her happy life comes crashing down around her when her cousin instigates a coup against the royal family and slays her father. Yona flees with her childhood friend and loyal bodyguard Son Hak in tow. At first, all she wants to do is survive and escape her family's enemies.\n\nBut as she begins to see what life is like outside of the palace, she realizes that she has bigger goals. The kingdom her father ran was not run fairly - in fact, it created massive injustice. She decides to take responsibility and become a true leader - but of course, that's easier said than done.\n\nAfter Aileen Lauren Dautriche's fiance, the Crown Prince Cedric Jeanne Elmir, decides to cancel their engagement so that he can marry someone else, Aileen is devastated. What's more, she realizes that she isn't originally part of this world. Instead, she's been reincarnated as the villainess of an otome game who passes away partway through the game.\n\nHoping to avoid that unpleasant fate, she decides to try and convince the game's final boss, her ex-fiance's brother Claude Jeanne Elmir - also known as the Demon King - to marry her. Claude doesn't trust her at all, so in order to persuade him, she agrees to help him with his larger goal - to create lasting peace between humanity and demonkind.\n\nBeing reincarnated into your favorite video game sounds great - that is, if you're the hero. But the hero of My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom! is reincarnated as Katerina Claes, a villainess who meets a horrible end no matter what route the player takes.\n\nKaterina decides to take her fate into her own hands by avoiding all the triggers that could lead to her downfall. To do this, she decides to be as nice as humanly possible to everyone she meets. This earns her the love and affection of countless new friends, including royalty. The only problem is that a lot of them are actually in love with her, but she's totally oblivious!"
