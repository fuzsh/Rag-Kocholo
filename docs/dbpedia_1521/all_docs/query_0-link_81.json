        "text": "THE Love Islanders enjoyed a boozy night out as they celebrated their freedom - but not everyone joined the party.\n\nJess White was nowhere to be seen, leading fans to suspect a feud has broken out between co-stars.\n\nThe 25-year-old from Stockport was in London the night the gang were out.\n\nFans suspected she was avoiding the reunion as her love rival Harriett Blackmore was there.\n\nThe pair clashed after they were embroiled in a love triangle with Ronnie Vint and they came to blows on several occasions.\n\nUma Jammeh, Jess Spencer, Grace Jackson, Ciaran Davies, Ayo Odukoya, Harriett, Ronnie, Sean Stone, Matilda Draper, Omar Nyame, Wil Anderson and Nicole Samuel were all throwing moves on the dance floor.\n\nOne fan noticed in the video reuploaded by TikTok account itsforfunokkkkk that Jess wasn't there, writing: \"Jess white was in London and even not once she join them I think because of harriett and Ron Maybe I am wrong mm I feel sad for Jess though.\"\n\nJess was repeatedly branded a \"bully\" by fans after she was caught laughing at Harriett when she got upset after having an argument with Ciaran.\n\nJess told the girls that Harriett could \"give it but not take it\" and called her a \"princess\".\n\nHowever, after Jess was dumped from the show after a mass cull she insisted that \"she gets on with everybody\".\n\nShe said: \"I’m a people’s person, that’s my job, so I knew I’d get on with everybody.\n\n\"This journey has taught me to never underestimate how important friendships are.\n\n\"I was so close with both the girls and boys in the villa and I love them all individually.\n\n\"I'm a tough cookie and rarely cry but everytime one of my girls left I was always in tears. The relationships you form are so special, I’m so proud of everyone and think we will all be friends for life.\"\n\nBut she added: \"I was like everyone’s big sister but Samantha, Nicole and Uma were so lovely and people I hope to have in my life for a very long time.\n\n\"Nicole for the win, she’s my little sister and best friend.\n\n\"I only have nice things to say about everyone, even Harriett was lovely although we didn’t see eye to eye on the odd occasion.\""
