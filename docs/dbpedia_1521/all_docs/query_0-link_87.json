        "text": "Kate attends Wimbledon men’s final with Princess Charlotte\n\nThe Princess of Wales has been praised by one of King Charles's former butlers, as her recent return to public life showed just how dedicated and devoted she is to the crown.\n\nPrincess Kate has been largely absent from royal engagements in 2024 as she undergoes preventative chemotherapy for a type of cancer which was diagnosed earlier this year.\n\nBut despite not having returned fully to public duties, the future Queen made a sensational return to public life when she appeared alongside the royals during Trooping the Colour back in June.\n\nKate also melted royal fans' hearts when she attended the Wimbledon finals in July and received a standing ovation from the crowd.\n\nNow former royal butler Grant Harrold said Kate's appearances have been \"great for the morale of the nation\" and will have given her a \"boost\".\n\nREAD MORE: Meghan humiliated after sister Samantha tries to sue her again for defamation\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest Royal news Join us on WhatsApp\n\nOur community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nSpeaking on behalf of Spin Genie, Mr Harrold added that the Princess of Wales has always had a \"huge sense of duty just like the late Queen\" as she prepares to become Queen Consort one day herself.\n\nHe said she will have made the decision to make both appearances due to her love of her duties, as well as her \"love of the family\" as she prepares to become Queen Consort one day herself.\n\nHe said: \"There was a huge buzz at Trooping the Colour. I witnessed the excitement when the carriage came out of the Palace.\n\n\"You could see it caused a lot of buzz and joy around the British public. I think the energy of the public has increased because they were thrilled to see her there.\n\n\"Whether she’ll return to more duties depends on how well she is, but when she is seen in public, it does cause a lot of excitement which is great for her, as it will give her a boost, and it’s great for the morale of the nation.\"\n\nDon't miss...\n\nMeghan's brutal 10-word response to Harry's 'cruel outburst' [REVEAL]\n\nHarry and Meghan blasted as latest 'threat' shows 'lack of concern' for Kate [LIVE]\n\nHarry and Meghan ruffle royal feathers with new tour as rift with Firm deepens [LATEST]\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Kate has got a huge sense of duty, just like the late Queen did.\n\n\"There have been plenty of comparisons between the late Queen and Prince Philip and the Prince and Princess of Wales. She would’ve returned because of duty and the love of the family.\n\n\"She also wants the British public and Commonwealth to see she is as good as she can be and is getting on with life, just as millions of other people have to.\n\n\"She’s trying to carry on with as much of normal life as possible, which includes her royal duties.\""
