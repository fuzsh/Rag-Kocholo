        "text": "\"You're on a path in the woods. And at the end of that path is a cabin. And in the basement of that cabin is a princess. You're here to slay her. If you don't, it will be the end of the world\"\n\n―The first line of the game\n\nThe Princess is the female lead of Slay The Princess. Locked within the basement of a cabin, she acts as both the foil, love interest, and enemy to the player and changes based on how they perceive her. She is a vessel of The Shifting Mound.\n\nDescription[]\n\n\"So... did they tell you why I'm supposed to be so dangerous?\"\n\n―The Princess[src]\n\nThe Princess is stated to be dangerous, enough so that she can seemingly destroy the world. According to The Narrator, she is willing to lie, cheat, and everything else in her power to prevent the player from slaying her. The way she acts towards the player differs based on their actions. If approached as a victim, she will be soft-spoken and polite; however, if approached as a threat, she will be cold and condescending, even outright aggressive.\n\nPhysical Appearance[]\n\nWhen she is first met, the Princess appears to be a young woman with long, fair hair parted to the sides. She has large, anime-like eyes and a chain around her right wrist attached to the wall. Her dress hangs off her shoulders, her puffy sleeves bunched up at her upper arms, that is hanging off her shoulders and reaches down to around her ankles. She wears low-heeled shoes and a jeweled tiara.\n\nThrough the player's perception, the Princess is able to change her form. This doesn't seem to be a conscious decision on her part, as the only time when she changes is in-between chapters.\n\nPowers & Abilities[]\n\nDespite the Princess' slender frame, she holds a lot of innate strength. She can move very quickly and hit the player with enough force to break bones and even shatter their jaw. She also seems to have a high pain tolerance, barely reacting when either the player cuts her arm off or she chews through it herself. She is even able to survive being decapitated and has used this ability to escape her bonds on at least one occasion. However, despite this, she is still somewhat mortal, as she can be killed by being stabbed through the heart or through supernatural means.\n\nNew Perspectives[]\n\nBased on the player's choices during Chapter I, the Princess may change into several different forms, all with unique appearances and personalities. Unlike the Narrator, the Princess will remember the events of the previous chapter and respond to the Player accordingly. Along with that, the appearance of the Cabin, the basement, and even the surrounding woods may similarly change. As the Player continues to make more choices, these transformations can stretch into a third or fourth chapter, but the Princess will always end up being taken away by a multitude of disembodied hands.\n\nThe Adversary[]\n\nMain Article: The Princess/The Adversary\n\n\"This one yearns to grow and struggle.
