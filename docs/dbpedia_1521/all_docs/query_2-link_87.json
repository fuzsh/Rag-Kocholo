        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nFewer and fewer ravens tended to fly towards the Citadel.\n\nThe Order of Maesters was a wise, ancient order, they had seen many kings rise and collapse, survived the Targaryens’ many attempts to erase all trace of all gods but the Fourteen Flames.\n\nIt hadn’t worked, for the Seven were stronger than those who had sunk with Old Valyria - and thus, though in open rebellion against the crown, protected by the light of the Father, the Smith, the Warrior, the Reach still thrived.\n\nOften, the Conclave, the ruling council of the Order of Maesters, referred to Princess Rhaenyra’s return as the last trial, the most important test sent by the gods. They would face it, endure it, and eventually, triumph.\n\nTradition was their ally, and while the rightful heir to the Iron Throne hadn’t pledged himself to the power of the Seven, he remained their most valiant hope. After all, he had been the one sneaking into the capital to smash it from within.\n\nWhat is left of King’s Landing after King Aegon’s attack? the archmaesters had wondered. Ruins. Their defenses were taken down. Their army mostly destroyed.\n\nVictory would have been so close, if only he hadn’t heard of it.\n\nIf only he had stayed away, like he had for a decade.\n\nNow they were defended by more than ramparts and thousands of swords.\n\nDragons.\n\nGods be good, they had fumed, when hearing that the attack on the capital had failed; that King Viserys still seated the Iron Throne, saved by no one else but the traitor he had hunted down for twelve years.\n\nChaos calls for Daemon Targaryen, they had seethed. Of course he came back, the perfect opportunity to win a pardon, only to meddle in our affairs.\n\nHadn’t the Rogue Prince decided that he cared for his house’s survival after all, the King of Kings would already sit on the Iron Throne, and peace would have now been achieved.\n\nNo more soldiers would have needed to fight, to die.\n\nAll of the houses that hadn’t yet bent the knee to Aegon’s cause would have been trialed, they would have either surrendered or been executed. The Seven Kingdoms would be as one once again, this time under the guidance of a servant of the Seven, not a foreign, heathen king that had only condoned such faith, only as a sign of goodwill.\n\nNo, not of good will alone, they had to remember. Aegon the Conqueror, and all of the kings that followed, were frightened by the worshippers of the only one true faith.\n\nTargaryens might have dragons, but the High Septon’s influence reached beyond wildfire. His military order had been dissolved and defeated, but it had never truly died.\n\nIn secret, soldiers still swore themselves to the service of the Seven and their most precious vicar.\n\nAn army of valiant soldiers, devoted to the Seven.\n\nThe Faith Militant.\n\n“What are we waiting for?” the youngest of the archmaesters suddenly asked. “We must strike while King’s Landing is still recovering!”\n\n“King’s Landing is well guarded, better than it had been in years,” he was reminded. “The Rogue Prince is back, along with the princess, and they both have dragons. Aemond Targaryen mounts the largest beast still alive since the death of Vhagar.”\n\nThe capital might have been on fire, it would be unassailable with four beasts scouring the sky.\n\nEven the Seven hadn’t shown themselves to help them strike such demons down.\n\n“The ballistas took two dragons down already, what are a few more?”\n\nThe Conclave did not possess ballistas, only the armies of Dorne did, and while they had been willing to share the plans and the means that would allow any enemy of the crown to build similar ones, their foe was aware of them.\n\nThey will spot them and destroy them. It shall always be their priority - and then, it will be only men against the beasts.\n\nThey had lost so many lives to the cruel spears of such engineering, they wouldn’t risk it anymore.\n\nNot without the absolute knowledge that in an attack, they would prevail.\n\n“The Faith Militant is resurgent, as powerful as they were during the last riot, and their swords are rusting while waiting to be sent to combat!”\n\n“It isn’t that simple.”\n\n“It should be that simple,” the youngest argued. “Soldiers fight, these warriors were anointed by this very order to do the gods’ work. It is a sin to keep them in the dark, the Father shall deem them lazy and craven if they do not march in his name!”\n\n“If the dragons are unleashed, our army will turn to a sea of bone and ash within the hour, and the order that sent them shall be next in line.”\n\n“So it is death that scares you,” he replied, huffing. “If so then we are doomed to a cold war!”\n\nEach side not daring to move on the board, one afraid of ballistas and the other intimated by too many dragons.\n\n“There will be a war, the Faith Militant will be deployed. Patience is a virtue, boy,. The Targaryen sigil is a three-headed dragon, and King Aegon proved that they could be slaughtered and turned against each other.”\n\nHouse against house.\n\nBrother against brother.\n\n“They are hydras more than dragons if another head grows when another is cut. King’s Landing was supposed to be easy to take, and when their defenses were down, the Rogue Prince appeared!”\n\nTrue enough, they reckoned, but they would soon run out of heads, of weapons, of allegiances.\n\n“Then they should be struck in their very heart.”\n\nA disturbed silence filled the room. Murder wasn’t a thing easily commanded, especially to kings, to princes, to children.\n\n“Is it a sin,” the youngest argued.\n\nThe rest of the order chuckled, for the latest of their recruit wasn’t old enough, wise enough to reckon that perhaps a few royal lives, even young, should be sacrificed if it meant sparing a thousand.\n\n“The High Septon will recommend us to the Father. This means to ensure the safety of more than just the sake of one wicked family.”\n\n“It will be blamed on someone, and it will be seen as a coup! Not the will of the gods. King slaying is a curse.”\n\nThe oldest archmaester put his hands on the youngest man’s shoulders.\n\n“The Seven will cleanse you of any curses. Are you not prepared to suffer for them? To die for them? We should have considered your application to this place with more attention.”\n\n“No!”\n\nGive a bit of power to a man and he will prefer to rot than to give it away.\n\n“King Viserys is ill,” an archmaester remarked. “Should we pick the rightful poison, it will seem natural.”\n\n“He cannot be the only one to choke, the Princess Rhaenyra would be crowned in his stead, and her consort would command the rest of their army. We would make it even easier for them.”\n\nThat seemed easy enough to remedy as well.\n\n“The king and the princess, then - a king and his heir. A blood bane.”\n\nOne of them arched their brows.\n\n“The princess has two sons.”\n\nIn the heavy silence that followed, the rest of the archmaesters understood that it hadn’t been an option to spare the lives of their offspring, either.\n\nYet, striking an old man, a woman, and children ought to be easier than the prince protecting them with his body, his sword, his soul.\n\nHe was their greatest strength, the very reason why they were all still alive.\n\n“Daemon Targaryen is a threat, we cannot order the assassination of his family and let him live!”\n\n“Should their whole brood die at once then? The king, the princess, and her consort, the children - any person with silver hair growing on their heads?”\n\nPrince Aemond, Daeron, Princess Helaena - the queen, even, for good measure.\n\n“Aemond One-Eye showed no mercy to the Lannisters when he came for them,” they were reminded. “Their house is decimated, and he spared neither the old nor the young.”\n\nAnother silence replied.\n\n“King Aegon shall want to deal with his mother and brother himself.”\n\n“Should we inform him of what we plan?”\n\n“The king is grieving a great treachery within his own family. Better let His Grace rest. He shall be pleased by our efforts once we offer him the crown.”\n\nOh, the news had flown from Dorne right to the ears of the Conclave. Aegon Targaryen was now a widow by his own doing. Aliandra Martell’s blood was said to still soak the soil where her head was taken.\n\n“Rest? A wife he had vowed to honor and cherish -”\n\n“She was charged with incest, lied with her brother,” another member of the Order reminded him. “The worst of sins - she was lucky to be beheaded and not burnt to the stake to cleanse her from her sins.”\n\nThe child was lucky as well to be simply cast aside, and not thrown out of a window. Many men would have been less kind, if they doubted the legitimacy of the babe.\n\nThe Conclave was an ancient council, sometimes its members seemed to be as old as the first men that had first seated in it.\n\n“King Aegon himself descends from a long line of men marrying their sisters.”\n\nMany men shrugged.\n\n“No one hardly controls to whom they are born. We shall count ourselves blessed, if Aegon is willing to cleanse his line, and put an end to centuries of infamy.”\n\nArchmesters laughed.\n\n“Right before Princess Aliandra and her brother were arrested, he is said to have expressed his desire to take his sister as his second wife. The Princess Rhaenyra.”\n\nBitter voices echoed through the room. Confused looks, heads shaking. Surely\n\n“A folly!”\n\n“To marry the woman we ought to destitute?” the council hissed, disgusted. “Unthinkable!”\n\n“An attempt at peace, for sure,” it was suggested. “One that he will reckon as a mistake, no doubt.”\n\n“And yet, House Martell is now a pile of ashes, so much for peace. Qoren Martell is dead, as well as his children - only Princess Aliandra’s daughter was spared, and only because she is a babe, no doubt. His only heir.”\n\n“A girl cannot be named the King of Kings' heir,” an archmaester frowned. “It goes against our very cause!”\n\n“The girl was declared a bastard. In time, Aegon shall intend to take a wife, and bring forth Valyrian sons.”\n\n“With his sister?”\n\nNo effort was made to try and hide the disgust at this prospect.\n\n“There is no point in having this conversation,” the youngest archmaester declared. “We ought to uproot Viserys and his heir, her family. Even a Targaryen king cannot bring a girl back from the dead, he will not marry a dead bride. Rhaenyra shall fall, and Aegon shall have to marry someone else. See, comrades. It is that simple.”\n\nHence it was decided.\n\nPoison should be the answer.\n\n“Is there anyone we can trust in the keep to deliver them, to make sure it ends in their plates?”\n\nThe archmaester’s smile was malicious, as if aware of a joke he alone understood.\n\n“Have you ever heard of the White Worm?”\n\nThe Rogue Prince did not find sleep despite the warmth of his wife’s arms.\n\nWhile they did not speak, did not talk more of what loomed over their heads - treason from the maesters, treacherous servants potentially working against them, a murder attempt.\n\nThe king maybe dying, somewhere in the castle.\n\nRhaenyra struggled to find sleep as well, even soothed by Daemon’s heartbeat against her ear. Like so many nights, she was focused on his breathing rhythm. The rising of his chest soothed her, it was her favorite lullaby - yet, even while lying down, a storm roared there, caged within her husband’s ribs.\n\nHis heart was racing, drums of war raging.\n\nEven if they doubted it, eventually the darkness died, and the sun rose. Daylight filled the room, but both were awakened long before it did.\n\nWar demanded its warriors’ rest.\n\n“You are awake,” Daemon whispered, his hand stroking her arms. “Have you slept at all?”\n\n“I know you haven’t.”\n\nIt was enough of an answer, though he was certain she had closed her eyes, at some point. He, too, had suffered sleepless nights in their time together, and knew how she sounded when she slept, when she ran, when she loved.\n\nShe turned in his embrace, her skin pale.\n\n“No word came during the night.”\n\n“No word came,” he repeated, fingers running in her silver hair.\n\nThey would have had if the king had died, wouldn’t they?\n\nIt didn’t need to be spoken, and Rhaenyra loudly exhaled. She did not try to hide her relief, even if meant to be short. Daemon, on the other hand, kept strolling his fingers on her flesh, seemingly only satisfied that no hurried knock on the door had troubled his lack of sleep.\n\n“No word came,” he sighed again, closing his eyes.\n\nSo Viserys is still alive.\n\nRhaenyra stayed still as she felt his muscles relax, his forehead heavier on her shoulder. He let himself go only with sunrise close, when he was certain the ghouls were gone.\n\nShe resisted the urge to caress his face, to press a kiss on his forehead. It was too rare to see him defenseless, vulnerable.\n\nFor a man who claimed anger only weighed his bones, my love, you seem quite relieved.\n\nHe must have dozed off, for when he bolted awake again, the sun was higher in the sky, and nightingales were singing outside. The stars, the tides, they wouldn’t stop turning for a king.\n\nNor would the birds ever stop singing as long as spring would come.\n\nFor a second, his heart raced, when his hand found the place next to him in bed empty, the sheets cold - but a baby cooed in her crib, and his eyes caught Rhaenyra standing above Visenya’s cradle.\n\nA small smile on her lips.\n\n“Hello again, husband,” she playfully said, taking the baby in her arms.\n\nDaemon grunted, rubbing his hand on his face. He had been caught up by surprise. Fortunately for him, his wife’s nature wasn’t to taunt, to gloat, hence she only beamed when carrying their daughter to him.\n\nStill, some dark circles surrounded her eyes, but he said nothing.\n\nInstead, he simply kissed the little girl’s forehead as Rhaenyra sat down, putting her at her breast.\n\n“I know there is a lot to be done today, but I don’t want to leave her behind,” she stated, nestling the young princess in her embrace. “Politics are hardly a newborn’s place, yet she is so young, we should be parted for entire days…”\n\nHe watched as Visenya’s curious eyes remained locked on her mother’s face. What a long day it ought to have been, wondering where the princess had gone. They hadn’t ever stayed apart since she was born, and she had only been kept away because of duty.\n\nYou’re beautiful as a mother, dārilaros. The image of a goddess.\n\n“Keep her,” Daemon agreed, deciding a single kiss wasn’t enough for his daughter. “It will make her stronger.”\n\nRelaxing against the pillows, she called for Elinda to gather linens to swaddle her against her. It should be the task of a wetnurse, a governess - but the servants had learned the prince and the princess’ ways to educate their children weren’t conventional, every baby fed at their mother’s own breast.\n\nWhat a waste, many would say.\n\nWhat a privilege, Daemon would argue.\n\n“Laenor should stay with the boys again today,” she decided, and Daemon hummed. “There aren’t many people I would trust with their lives, but he saw Viserys be born. I don’t think he would mind…”\n\n“I agree.”\n\nRhaenyra swallowed, and a tray of food was brought. It was so simple, since the cooks ought to be sharply questioned. Bread, cheese, ham - yet she wouldn’t touch a thing before assured that it was tested, new tasters picked by willing servants.\n\nNo moontea was prepared, either. Perhaps she would ask Gerardys for some, later on.\n\nOnly Visenya was granted to feed from a dangerless source.\n\n“He must also go to Lord Corlys,” she added, carefully. “He has been detained in his room since his last slight at that cursed diner, chances are, he must be losing his mind.”\n\n“A fair retribution for the words he recklessly spoke.”\n\nAfter all, he had laid blame on the king and queen without respect, claiming that they cared little for the fate of the Hand, still a prisoner in Dorne; refused to raise his cup to the health of the heir to the throne, and instead, let its wine spill on the floor.\n\nLike a river of blood, like an omen of betrayal.\n\nFuck you, Lord Corlys had cursed. We will all die because of you.\n\n“We cannot afford such a powerful lord to turn to foe, and he is Laenor’s father, Daemon,” she sighed. “He has lost so much already, we are a great part as to why the Sea Snake cannot trust his son, anymore. Surely we owe him… leniency.”\n\nWhere would we be, if Laenor had denounced us when he found us in Pentos?\n\nWhen he found us in Braavos - if he had refused to come and rescue them, after we were attacked?\n\nThe prince held no hard feelings about a man feeling spoiled, not even when he still mourned losing his wife’s hand, a crown that never landed on his son’s head.\n\n“Rhaenys is away, and Corlys resents my brother for not acting to save her. I cannot blame him,” he said. “Was my wife a prisoner in foreign lands, I wouldn’t tolerate my liege to feast and mindlessly drink while she was kept a prisoner.”\n\nThe whole land of Dorne would have burnt already, even if the price had been to send every living dragon there, to turn a powerful kingdom to ash. Sand, cinders - they weren’t that different.\n\nFrom a city blessed by the sun, it would simply bask in the smoke, its great castles and temples brought to ruins. A second Doom, here was what would befall anyone daring to steal a princess from the Rogue Prince’s arms.\n\nAnd Lord Corlys’ fleet had suffered great loss. He wasn’t a dragon lord, and every beast that used to nest in his family’s bosom was dead.\n\nYes, he could sympathize with his condition, especially when he mostly depended on Viserys’ means to attempt a rescue mission; and the king hadn’t been willing to risk losing more men on his favorite cousin.\n\n“We must get her back, uncle.”\n\n“Just a couple of days ago you had me arrested before I could take hold of Caraxes’ reins, and now you want us to fly to Dorne? You ordered the Kingsguard to never let me leave the city, my love.”\n\n“We are not ready to fly to Dorne, we don’t know enough about their defenses. Yet there are ways to retrieve a hostage without conquering an entire land, aren’t there?”\n\nImmediately, Daemon tensed. He wondered what mad ideas had fused in his wife’s mind - bargaining, surrendering, begging - and his voice hardened without a thing he could do to control it.\n\n“If you fathom negotiating with Aegon, princess, I swear I will keep you in chains, even if the White Cloaks ought to hang me for it.”\n\n“Keep me in chains?” Rhaenyra arched her brows, her tone lighter, as if she had expected him to react in such a manner. Surely she had - he was half of her soul, afte rall. “My, are we back to the beginning of our story?”\n\nDaemon glared, but her gaze stayed soft.\n\n“You know what he fucking asked.”\n\nThe words on his wicked letter were still carved in his mind, and even though he hadn’t heard his nephew’s voice since he was a toddler, he could imagine a sneer on a distorted face, a slightly older version of his brother who bugged him day and night.\n\nYou will give me my half-sister and watch as I take her to wife.\n\nThe rest of his threats were daring and horrible enough, but this, Daemon simply couldn’t ignore.\n\nFor this, only, he would demand his heart to be carved out from his chest.\n\nIt was the most fitting punishment, for it was just what Aegon aimed to do, should he desire and fight for a right to Rhaenyra.\n\nStill, the princess tried to remain calm, to infuse him with peaceful thoughts.\n\n“Mind your tongue in front of our girl, husband.”\n\nHe grew impatient. She was playing his own tricks on him.\n\n“Rhaenyra….”\n\nShe reared her head back, adjusting Visenya at her breast. The baby was quiet, calm, as if she knew serious matters were discussed. Already a princess, Rhaenyra mused, smiling down at her.\n\n“Not with Aegon,” she replied. “He is mad. He is wretched and beyond forgiveness.”\n\n“Then with whom?”\n\nHer lips turned into a thin line, and she was done playing around.\n\n“You do know someone who has means, do you not?” she asked, and when Daemon simply furrowed his brows, not quite certain of what she was implying, she continued. “Or at least you did, when we last needed to hire thieves to enter the Red Keep and achieve a dark scheme of revenge.”\n\nThis time, it struck him.\n\n“The White Worm?”\n\nRhaenyra shrugged her shoulders, paying attention not to startle her little girl.\n\n“Your lover did just what she was asked when we needed her services. Aegon sent assassins, he had also a Faceless Man to spy on us. If he can do it while taking power over Dorne, how could she not be capable of it if supported by the crown?’\n\n“She was not my lover.”\n\nIt was Rhaenyra’s turn to glare, waiting for him to elaborate on what she had just suggested. Maybe it was bold, daring. She didn’t know how many royals before her had resorted to less diplomatic ways to retrieve a long-kept prisoner from their enemy’s castle - yet she was willing to try.\n\n“You would trust the life of a princess into the hands of a former whore?” he clarified. “The life of a Targaryen princess?”\n\n“You trusted her the last time.”\n\n“For revenge, yes. Not to rescue the Hand of the King, a most valued hostage that ought to be well guarded.”\n\n“We are short of other options. At least we should try, what is there to lose? Lord Corlys will be satisfied, and if it works, Rhaenys will be back, perhaps with enough information for us to prevail when we do fly to Dorne…”\n\n“And if it fails, and Aegon decides to take her head like he did his late wife?”\n\nOh, the prospect was awful, and the princess did deserve better than to die in the courtyard of a traitor, made to pay for a sin she hadn’t committed. Of all the people in her half-brother’s house that had failed him - their father, his mother, his older sister herself, the Princess Rhaenys wasn’t among them.\n\n“He could very well decide to take it when he feels the winds turning. Our strategy cannot rely only on what we imagine a madman’s next moves could be. Let us do it, and show him that we won’t yield to a traitor.”\n\nNot that the lack of response to his letter proved anything different.\n\nIf she knew what Aegon looked like, she would almost picture him by his windowsill, scouring the sky for ravens.\n\nWould you kill the bird if he brought you a displeasing answer?\n\nDaemon straightened his back, knowing that should this be an argument, he would lose.\n\nHe didn’t want to fight on the matter.\n\nIn the way he focused on the ceiling, not arguing further, Rhaenyra knew she had won.\n\n“Will you go to her?”\n\nDaemon humourlessly laughed.\n\n“I have better to do than deal with a spider.”\n\nThe princess wouldn’t be the one insisting for her husband to meet with a former paramour, especially if he was so reluctant to deal with her.\n\n“Send someone else, then.”\n\nDaemon nodded as Rhaenyra tried to think of whom was best fitted for this unconventional mission. She would tell Alicent and the Velaryons - but it needed to be a secret. They knew not how many spies were lurking in the corridors, who they could trust, and who was an agent of the pretender.\n\nAegon could never learn of that mission, or else the princess’ life would be endangered indeed, and Rhaenyra’s idea would have only been salt on Lord Corlys’ vivid wounds instead of healing honey, giving him back what he craved the most.\n\nMore than a crown, more than an iron seat.\n\nIt was her uncle who came up with a name, a dark smirk on his lips.\n\n“Aemond, perhaps.”\n\nThe king was still abed when they reached his chamber.\n\nDespite Maester Gerardys’ efforts, Viserys hadn’t totally regained consciousness yet. He was half awake, and half lost to another world, whether the land of dreams or the afterlife.\n\nRhaenyra’s steps were quiet on the floor as she approached the bed, the draperies tied to the posters hiding him from her view; but eventually, she was close enough to see his chest rise and fall, his breathing rhythm more even that it had been the day before.\n\n“Is he better?”\n\nMaester Gerardys nodded, but she could read he was still wary.\n\n“He passed the night, that is a good sign. The poison was strong, but it appears dragon blood is stronger.”\n\nRhaenyra resisted the urge to bite on her nails to soothe her anguish. Visenya was swaddled against her, cooing as she paced.\n\nDaemon did not pass the threshold. His feet were camped to the ground, as if heavy anchors were chained to his ankles. For a second, his eyes sought his brother’s face, but the draperies also hid him from his prying eyes.\n\nHe wasn’t in the mood to try and see more, he only looked away.\n\nOn a chair by the king’s side, Alicent’s eyes were set on the baby.\n\nIt had never crossed her mind to ever ask a maid to bond any of her boys to her body. Once they were freed from her womb, she had only wished them away from her, safely put in their cribs and well-fed at the breast of healthy wetnurses.\n\nAt the time, she had thought it would be best for them. It was tradition, it was what she had been taught, what every lady did.\n\nEven her little girl, she had refused to bring to her breast. Helaena had been a difficult babe, always crying as if she was in pain, and yet, she had never thought that perhaps proximity would have helped her feel loved, and comfortable.\n\nSafe.\n\nThe queen clasped her hands in front of her, touching her belly. She had never grieved the feeling of children moving inside of her, but the princess missed the butterflies, the clasping of tiny wings there.\n\nSo much that she kept her newborn close to her heart, and in response, the little girl only cooed.\n\nWhat a beautiful, chiming sound it was.\n\nWould my own children have sounded the same, or were they twisted from birth?\n\n“The Lord Commander has news,” Alicent declared, glancing at her husband. “We should discuss it elsewhere. Allow the king to rest his mind.”\n\nRhaenyra nodded. She looked for her brother, but he was nowhere to be found.\n\nAemond was part of the City Watch, she assumed he had duties elsewhere, they didn’t include tending to an old man.\n\nEveryone must serve in their own way - and her husband would have also preferred to be anywhere else than in this very room.\n\nDaemon was indeed the first to walk away.\n\nOnly Helaena did not move, embroidering a pillow. The pattern was odd, one that she had never seen before. Ladies would most likely sew their house’s sigils, or flowers - and in this family, dragons.\n\nIt was nothing of the sort.\n\n“What is that?” Rhaenyra curiously asked, and while her sister stayed focused on her work, she replied.\n\n“A spider caught in her own web,” Helaena explained. “Hanged on the strings it weaved.”\n\nA shiver ran down the princess’ spine.\n\n“Interesting pattern.”\n\nHelaena hummed whereas Rhaenyra eyed Alicent, biting her lower lip. Her daughter was of a curious nature, she had warned him quite a few times already.\n\n“We should go,” the queen announced, pausing as Heleana jumped on her feet. “You can stay, dearest. I am certain your presence is a comfort for your father.”\n\n“I wish to attend, mother,” Helaena argued, putting her work down. Since Alicent’s face remained blank, her hesitation marked on her every feature, it was to her sister that she turned. “Will you allow me?”\n\nRhaenyra blinked, surprised about the question.\n\nShe knew so little about her little sister, yet what she did know justified keeping her close. A dreamer, their father believed her to be, and to Rhaenyra’s own surprise, she believed it too.\n\nAlicent believed it was madness, her cryptic words the fruits of a troubled mind; yet Helaena had seen her home in Pentos burning, and books carried on a cart as they had fled to Norvos.\n\nShe had seen them swimming in the waves after they were married, the red of their wedding gowns swallowed by the waves, and the sun that had warmed them both for ten years.\n\nYou were never mad, you were only never listened to.\n\nOnly by a father, a king, when it suited him.\n\nThis was proof. It was all true, and no one but a dreamer or a seer could have known such significant details - and so, when her sister claimed that the Rogue Prince should never leave to Harrenhal, Rhaenyra ought to listen, too.\n\nWhatever she was mumbling under her breath, be it about ancient keeps or strawberries, she had to pay attention.\n\nOh, how many tragedies could have that simple girl prevented if an entire council of men had been clever enough to read through her cryptic lines?\n\n“Of course,” Rhaenyra replied, her eyes as soft on her as they were when she looked at her own girl. “Come, sister.”\n\nAlicent swallowed, fearing that it wasn’t a good idea. All that she had done for years had been to protect her dear girl from politics, shelter her from any marriage proposal, preventing any man from selling her hand, or her womb, in an attempt to win an army.\n\nYet there she was, walking to the small council room, where war and murder would be discussed.\n\nYour mind is crumbling every day, must you hear about how your house shatters as well?\n\nBut Rhaenyra’s authority weighed almost as much as hers.\n\nHer heart clenched as Helaena entered the room, looking around as if it was the very first time she stepped inside of it.\n\nPerhaps it was.\n\n“Are you sure it is wise?” she murmured into Rhaenyra’s ears. “Unlike you, she was never even given the role of a cupbearer.”\n\nThe princess’ chuckle was bitter.\n\n“It is because I was my father’s cupbearer that I know she must attend,” she countered, not taking a seat. “Helaena is a princess. My sister. She shall have her place in my council, if such is her desire.”\n\nCould it be that after so long caring for her little girl alone, another soul appeared to care for her as she did?\n\nMy sweet rose, too frail for spring, shaken by the warmest winds.\n\nOnly loved by a cripple for a father, a beast for a brother, a mother of monsters.\n\n“I only worry about what she could say when her thoughts scatter, they rarely make sense, Rhaenyra,” she insisted. “Domestic pursuits suit her better, it soothes her. You have seen how she reacted in the throne room, when your father…”\n\nShe was cut off by Ser Harrold’s entrance.\n\nDaemon was turned to the window, his mind lost to something Rhaenyra couldn’t grasp.\n\nRhaenyra was the first to talk.\n\n“What news do you bring, Ser Harrold?”\n\n“The Lord Confessor heard the servants that Prince Daemon had arrested yesterday. None of them yet confessed to a conspiracy. He seems eager to take it further with the maesters. Mellos screams more than he talks for now - but he is an old man. His body will break, his tongue will loosen.”\n\nAt the other side of the room, Daemon rolled his eyes.\n\n“Is that all, Ser Harrold? It is hardly what this council would call news.”\n\n“There is more,” he continued, as if he hadn’t been cut. “Every bit of food was tasted on animals yesterday, and only a couple of rats died.”\n\nRhaenyra frowned, for despite years spent in this room, in another life, she wasn’t used to the political wooden tongue, sentences left to fuse with suspense.\n\n“What does this mean?”\n\nSer Harrold swallowed, his hand on the pommel of his sword.\n\n“It means only one dish was poisoned, or it seems. Strawberries.”\n\nA heavy silence filled the room as the information settled in.\n\n“Strawberries?” Alicent repeated, uncertain that she had heard it right.\n\nHow could something so small, so harmless ever kill?\n\n“Yes, Your Grace.”\n\nThe queen opened her mouth, agape. It made sense, she had witnessed her husband eagerly swallow a whole bowl of strawberries less than an hour before he had collapsed.\n\nRhaenyra, too, seemed shocked. She turned to Daemon, his gaze darkening as he found hers, and without a word, they shared the same fury.\n\nThere were strawberries on your tray yesterday, he remembered. The attack was also set on you.\n\nI know, husband.\n\nShe had even brought one to her lips, and grimaced at how sour they had tasted. It had made her renounce to eat more, yet it seemed like it hadn’t deterred her father’s appetite.\n\nStrawberries were so rare, in that part of the land, in that season.\n\nHe had probably thought those weren’t yet ripe, and emptied the plate he had been given.\n\nDaemon closed his hands into fists, his patience hanging on by a thread.\n\n“Strawberries,” he repeated. “At that fucking time of the year.”\n\nAlicent squinted, afraid to look at him and see the prince shifting from man to beast, something in his throat sounding like a storm.\n\nBefore the commander or Rhaenyra could reply, or ask for what he implied by that, Daemon moved, crossing the room.\n\nHis grim eyes set on the younger princess, a dangerous sneer on his lips.\n\nHelaena gasped as he reached her.\n\n“Daemon,” Rhaenyra hastily warned, frowning. “What are you -”\n\nShe hadn’t yet finished her sentence that her uncle’s hands grasped Helaena’s arms.\n\n“You said it,” he spat. “You fucking said it.”\n\nAlicent bolted from her chair, dashing to her daughter, and so did Rhaenyra.\n\n“Let her go,” Alicent commanded, firm. “Let her go!”\n\n“Daemon,” Rhaenyra repeated, her hand on his shoulder.\n\nBut the Rogue Prince didn’t care for a mother’s concern, nor did he feel his wife’s touch. On his clothes, her hand wasn’t hot enough to soothe him, her magic didn’t work.\n\nIn his blood, fire flowed.\n\n“You are scaring me,” Helena whispered, trying to wrestle.\n\nAlicent expected her to yell, to breathe loudly and deeply, like she often did when desperate to control her nerves.\n\n“You cannot put your hands on her, take them off now!”\n\nShe was no queen that Daemon acknowledged, he cared not for her commands.\n\n“Evil is red, poison is red, this is what you said,” Daemon reminded her, shaking her. “Like poppies, like strawberries. You said it! You knew it!”\n\nHe had heard it in the room, despite the drums of his heart, the dread in his bones. Perhaps he had failed to react, and maybe shock had turned him to stone until he could flee, but he had heard the meaningless, careless words coming out of her mouth.\n\nLike so many before him, he had taken them for rubbish, for fruitless sentences spoken by a mad girl.\n\nYet she had known the worst.\n\nHow can it be?\n\nAgainst her mother’s heart, Visenya started to cry.\n\n“Daemon!” Rhaenyra raised her voice, shaking her uncle in return, trying to catch his attention, but still, it remained locked on her sister, grimacing at his hard grasp.\n\nA hand on her daughter’s back, she tried to soothe two hurricanes at once.\n\n“Let go of my daughter now,” Alicent fumed, trying to circle his wrist and break his hold. “Ser Harrold!”\n\nVisenya’s screams and Helaena’s distress sounded the same to her.\n\nIt was a little girl handled by an angry man, a ruthless man.\n\nA little girl who had cried so often, born a mother eager to be deaf to them. By the time she had found the wisdom, the patience to tend to them, Helaena had long stopped screaming and crying anywhere else than in her pillows.\n\n“Let go of her, she has done nothing to you!”\n\nShe has done nothing to anyone!\n\nThe White Cloak ran to them, not unsheathing his sword, afraid to make the situation worse. His oath was clear, it had always been - yet what remained of it, when the members of the same house were turning on one another?\n\n“My prince -”\n\nDaemon pushed him away as he tried to grab his arm, and pushed Helena further, backing her against the wall.\n\n“How could you fucking know?” he asked, his voice low, baring his teeth like a snake waiting to strike. “If you are as harmless, as innocent as you look, how could you bloody know what my brother ate that was poisoned?”\n\n“Daemon!”\n\n“Did you choose to do nothing? Do you resent him as your wicked brother did, and allowed his body to break so you could free from his yoke?!”\n\nHe shook her again, his own body trembling with rage, his nostrils flared.\n\n“Daemon!”\n\nHis jaw was thrust forward, indignation and fear both playing with his mind. In a way, he was like her, seeing snakes where people only saw lords, assuming holes and traps beneath the ground, where people only saw dirt.\n\n“Answer me!”\n\nHelaena straightened her back, closing her little hands, trying to back him away.\n\n“I saw it,” she replied, not afraid to dive into his venomous eyes. “I saw red, something dark coming out of it. Dark enough to swallow us whole.”\n\n“Again with this nonsense, it means nothing,” he seethed, his body prey to many pairs of hands trying to free the princess from him. “This is a lie, a tool to hide treachery. I could have you arrested, put to question for those words you pronounced right when my brother fell.”\n\nRhaenyra wouldn’t let him, and neither would the queen, but they were both out of his vision, far from his mind. Only memories of Viserys losing his balance, and collapsing on the throne filled his thoughts, and the mesmerizing stupor that had petrified him, fordibbing him to move, to run, to scream.\n\nDaemon! Rhaenyra had screamed, needing his help and it had been the first he hadn’t been able to answer her call.\n\n“Daemon, stop this, you’re losing your mind!”\n\nYet she was powerless against the battle roaming in his head. All the arguments, the quarrels that had torn him and his brother apart, they weighed like a thousand of years on his shoulders, on his spirit.\n\nThere, in the back of his head, he still called him a traitor, still called him a plague.\n\nHe had endured it for so long, keeping it inside, gratefully welcoming his forgiveness - and he had managed to turn all of this to ashes, all in a single day.\n\nSimply by risking his wife and daughter’s lives, a deed he found extremely difficult to pardon.\n\nNow Viserys might pass away, and he would still be quarreling with a quiet ghost.\n\nBitter tears pricked his eyes, his face scarlet as a red letter written with blood.\n\nMe? Or has it become a rule to shelter traitors in the Red Keep?\n\nTo have them fed from our milk, our bread, so they can grow tall enough to stab us in the back?\n\n“I could have you killed should you be working with the usurper in the shadow,” he stated, his voice shattering, swallowing bile as well as glass. “Are you even aware?”\n\n“Don’t you fucking dare!” Alicent seethed, tugging on his arms but they were iron.\n\nHelena took a deep breath, becoming docile as a dove.\n\n“It wouldn’t change anything.”\n\nThough he believed in witches, and had fondly about having married one for years, he didn’t believe that one was standing in front of him, nor that she was a seer, for there hadn’t been one in their family for so long.\n\nIf there had ever been some at all, and not a series of coincidences leading them to survive, to conquer.\n\nYet she had him under her spell.\n\n“You have fallen to protect your brother’s city from war, and you couldn’t save him from such a harmless thing,” she stated. “Poppies, strawberries. They were never meant to be weapons.”\n\nHe couldn’t move, he couldn’t look away.\n\nShe shook her head, her fingers circling his wrist. Everything around them to fade to blank, to darkness. He couldn’t hear voices giving him orders, nor his wife trying to reach him, nor his daughter’s sharp cries.\n\nHis heart was narrow, tight as a noose, and he was deaf to all by the young princess’ words.\n\nHer touch was cold as ice, it almost burnt him.\n\n“He will see,” she whispered. “At the very end, he will see what was always inside of you.”\n\nDaemon blinked, and as she let go of his wrist, he too was compelled to release his grasp.\n\nAll sounds became clear again, the queen stepping in, putting herself between her daughter and him, making her body a shield.\n\n“May I remind you Helaena is a princess? Of all our line, the gentlest and most deserving of our protection!”\n\nTo fathom her most precious bird a traitor was unthinkable, when she could barely endure a whole day without trembling, without wandering in and out of a world Alicent couldn’t enter.\n\nA garden to which only Helaena held the keys.\n\nThe Rogue Prince didn’t avert his gaze from her fiery eyes, Alicent’s breath shallow as Helaena turned away without looking back.\n\n“Who will protect me if I do not protect myself,” she mumbled to herself, lowering her head when Rhaenyra looked at her.\n\nAlicent did not hear, only her stepdaughter did, and as always, wondered what it could mean. She didn’t seem startled, or shocked. Quietly, she went to look out the window, where dragons soared.\n\nThe queen still hadn’t moved.\n\n“The princess happened to know what poisoned the king,” he stated. “You are queen, what would you do should anyone else at court hold answers to the vilest act committed against us?”\n\nShe gritted her teeth.\n\n“She doesn’t know what she is saying half of the time, the Fates cursed her when she was born.”\n\nDon’t you see? It is what makes her special.\n\nMy little girl, too fragile for this world. In need of a jar, a kingdom of glass without any shade, for her to never be scared of her own reflection.\n\nDaemon held his chin up.\n\n“You underestimate the minds of the mad, it is your curse, Alicent Hightower.”\n\nTo those words, the queen could only blink, for it felt like a slap.\n\nTruth might feel like this, she reckoned.\n\nStill, she would dwell on it later.\n\n“Who will she be if her mind is broken?”\n\nHeleana smiled, playing with her hair. Many little girls liked to play with dolls, yet none of them knew as well as her what it felt to be porcelain in a mother’s eyes. So easy to break, so easy to bend.\n\nDo you not fathom me broken already, mother?\n\nRhaenyra was weary of those conversations taking place right in front of her sister. While Helaena did not react with more than a shy smile, she didn’t doubt that she could hear what was said right behind her.\n\nShe had been herself in this room, close to her sister’s age, listening to people knowing more than her, better than her. They, too, had discussed her capabilities and future without ever asking for her opinions.\n\nWhat if you were put in front of a mirror, sweet sister? Rhaenyra wondered, rocking her daughter. If instead of shutting yourself down, you were meant to open up?\n\nWould you bloom, should you be listened to?\n\n“Enough,” the princess sighed, tugging on her uncle’s arm, surprised when he complied, and backed away. “We are all on edge, and we mustn’t quarrel. Daemon is right,” she continued, trying to shift the subject, to break the game of glares between her husband and the queen. “From where did those strawberries come from? It is the first time since we returned that we had any, who delivered them?”\n\nVisenya still whined, but was calming down, and the rest of the room seemed to mirror her.\n\n“The cooks pledge they do not know, princess. They were never commissioned. All food coming from the Reach stopped coming years ago, and there is no warmer place where it could have come from but Dorne, and as you can guess…”\n\nNo shipment was sent from there, either.\n\nAt last, Daemon turned away from the queen, venom still soaking his tongue.\n\n“The Reach,” he repeated. “Right when we flushed out traitors maesters beneath our roofs.”\n\nMaesters.\n\nOne dead, one arrested for attempting to flee, sending a raven to Oldtown they had failed to intercept.\n\nThey had been right. Surely Mellos was the culprit, along with Rucinter whose body already rotted.\n\nThem, and perhaps every maester in this castle.\n\n“Would they go this far?” Rhaenyra breathed - but it was a foolish question.\n\nWith a baby in her arms, she suddenly\n\nThey meddled with her moontea, were ready to make her swallow a dupe. It could have been spiked with anything - wrong roots, liquor, wolfsbane.\n\nGods, they had been blind to their deception for so long.\n\n“Where does the Conclave live?” Daemon asked, though he knew the answer. “The Order of Maesters and their Citadel, where is it located?”\n\n“In the Reach,” Alicent replied in a whisper, feeling sick. “Near Oldtown, from where my brother stood in open rebellion for years.”\n\nShe closed her eyes. That city was once her home, her brother was once a friend.\n\n“It needs to be dealt with,” Daemon hastily decided. “If the Order itself commands its servants to act so openly against the royal house, what poison shall they pour in our allies’ cups?”\n\nRhaenyra agreed. Indeed, the Reach had been left alone for long enough.\n\nWith a heavy heart, once more, Alicent shut her heart to everything that had made her a girl, a lady. What she needed to be was a mother, and to that, she wasn’t good.\n\nWhat she needed to be, while her husband was abed, was a queen.\n\n“Free the Lord Confessor from his duty to Mellos, Ser Harrold,” she commanded, bile in her throat. The thought of the rack troubled her, but no more than the terrible sentence she ought to pronounce. “There shall be nothing more to drain out of him. I doubt that the Conclave would give more than a command to a mere servant of their Order.”\n\nThe commander nodded.\n\n“What shall be done with him, Your Grace?”\n\nAlicent opened her mouth, ready to speak the words; but alas, they didn’t escape her lips.\n\nThat effort, she had made once, when demanding the head of her father for his treachery, and the ones of those conspiring with him. Never again.\n\nNever again, had she sworn to herself, aware that this promise, she would most likely break.\n\nI never wanted to be the end of anyone else, she mused. Yet, I am not carrying the souls that perished at my sons’ hands?\n\nShe tried to master her courage, to ask for the sharp blow of a blade, or a quick noose - but it was the princess’ turn to give such a command.\n\n“Raise a stake outside of the dragon pit, good ser. Several. As many as there maesters in this castle,” she decided, the order so cold, so distant. “Let the maester know what befalls those mad enough to startle a dragon’s nest.”\n\nDaemon smirked, glancing at his dragon wife dancing on her feet while sentencing men to die, rocking a baby to sleep.\n\nThough she stayed silent, appalled by the death sentence chosen by her stepdaughter, at least, Alicent was grateful - until she heard the command regarding the rest of the maesters.\n\n“All of them?”\n\nHer hands were bloody enough already.\n\n“We have no time to lose trying to decide who speaks truth and right,” Rhaenyra stated. “If it is a conspiracy, they ought to have known, or at the very least they concealed their doubts.”\n\nAlicent widened her eyes, as if witnessing the execution itself.\n\n“Rhaenyra…”\n\n“It is for good measure.”\n\nThe maesters, the septons, the Hightowers; they were snakes beneath the ground, and they had wasted years thinking that those vipers were harmless if not startled.\n\n“Think of it as a mercy,” Daemon intervened, not burdened by such omens. “Should the Lord Confessor decide they were honest, they would carry on with their lives as cripples, haunted by the horrors they had to endure - or they would die, claiming their innocence. We weren’t clement with witches when interrogated, do you know? Often death and salute were worth more than life itself. Maesters have close bonds to the Faith, surely they will walk to their pyre with their chin up.”\n\nAlicent brought a hand to her throat, trying to master nausea.\n\nHelaena, by the window, stayed silent. She didn’t know if she had heard the horrors just promised, and hoped that it wasn’t the case. Her girl was haunted enough by dreams of her own making.\n\nDaemon glanced at Rhaenyra, the baby yawning, falling asleep.\n\nHe came to pat her small head.\n\n“Every known traitor dies tonight.”\n\nThe princess nodded, forbidding herself to feel sorry for those who had surely betrayed her, worked against her father, her whole family.\n\nFor how long?\n\nFor how long did they crave to put the house of the dragon down?\n\n“Ask for reports from scouts, send more to Oldtown if we lack recent ones,” she told Ser\n\nHarrold. “We need to know of their defenses before we go.”\n\n“And when we do know of them, princess?”\n\nRhaenyra’s voice was of ice.\n\n“Then the people of Oldtown will be reminded that no spark light the way better than fire.”\n\nSer Laenor knocked on his father’s chamber, but no answer came.\n\nIn front of the door, he frowned. It wasn’t like his father had been able to go anywhere, well guarded as he was, condemned to remain in his quarters after that disastrous diner they had shared.\n\nAgain, he knocked, but still, he heard no reply.\n\n“Open the door,” he commanded. “I carry a message from the princess.”\n\nThe White Cloaks obeyed.\n\nAs he passed the threshold, Laenor held his breath. He expected blood, or bedsheets tied together to make it a rope, a path to escape captivity; but instead, he found his father seated by a desk, seemingly perfectly fine.\n\nOnly quiet.\n\n“Father,” he said, relieved. “Why did you not answer me when I called?”\n\n“What need is there to answer?” Lord Corlys replied, not looking at him from the book he was reading. “I am no master here. I do not decide who is to enter and who is to stay away.”\n\nAt that, Laenor gritted his teeth. Disappointment filled his bones, for he had hoped a few days alone would have helped his lord father see clear, to voice an apology and seek redemption.\n\n“You defied the crown the last time you were in the king’s presence, father,” he reminded him with a deep sigh. “The shackles that have bound you to this room, you have clasped around your wrists yourself.”\n\nIt was astonishing enough that a lord such as himself could simply be punished, sent to a room, and prevented from getting out of it; he simply couldn’t imagine being chained down.\n\n“Have you come to gloat, son?”\n\n“Never,” Laenor replied, honest. “I have no reason to. My father crossed a line and his fate depends on the crown’s mercy.”\n\nThe Sea Snake turned his hands into fists.\n\n“Your mother’s life also depends on the crown, and the crown has no care for it. She went to Dorne to please the queen, to ensure the pretender couldn’t lay claim to the Iron Throne - and she paid the price of loyalty with her dragon’s blood, and years spent in a cell. Does that weight on your heart, Laenor, or only your lies?”\n\nLaenor arched his brows, feigning innocence.\n\n“When did I lie?”\n\n“Do not play with me, boy,” Corlys warned him, his tone grave. “You spent years scouring the Free Cities in search of Rhaenyra, claiming that every lead was a dead end - yet the hour when she called for you, you knew exactly where to sail. My brother found her, mere months after she was gone - and you were always a better hunter than he was.”\n\nThe knight swallowed, letting the mask fall from his face.\n\nThere was no point in denying the truth. Deep down, perhaps Lord Corlys had always known Laenor’s best interests only bloomed if Rhaenyra stayed away - from his point of view, at least.\n\nMayhaps he had been the fool, sending him to search the world for her in the company of his companion. It should have alerted him way sooner that he hadn’t brought home at least a hint, evidence that she was still alive, and wandering in Essos.\n\nTruth coming out at last, Laenor sighed.\n\n“What was the most difficult part, father?” he wondered. “Was it to swallow your doubts, or to keep turning a blind eye to what I am?”\n\n“Careful, son.”\n\n“Why? There is no one else left but us. No one to hear how you wished for another son, one that would fight to become king consort, not strive to escape this fate. Perhaps you have one, somewhere. Mayhaps your future lies with them.”\n\nAt the mention of other sons, Corlys turned to stone. He couldn’t known, he couldn’t possibly have guessed that he had, on occasion, taken advantage of some journeys at sea to visit other women, other shores.\n\nSuch was the nature of sailors. They couldn’t stop themselves from discovering new lands.\n\n“Be quiet,” he hissed through gritted teeth. “You are my heir, my only son. I have always kept your best interests at heart. I never wished for any other.”\n\n“Or so you convince yourself.”\n\nThe jab stung, Corlys wouldn’t tolerate it.\n\n“Have I once berated you for whom you choose to bed? Forbidden you to take sails with the Knight of Kisses, despite the rumors free under my roof?”\n\nThe knight swallowed, a shiver running down his spine.\n\n“Never.”\n\n“Never,” his father repeated. “I might have fought to make you king, and you may doubt that I let my ambitions prevail over your happiness - but never that I wished for anyone else to take your place. I will not stand for it.”\n\nLaenor’s heart clenched, and he repressed the need to cry.\n\nYet, his father was guilty of other sins he was tired to keep a secret.\n\n“I wonder if mother knows, too. About my nature, surely she is aware - but about yours, and the ones of the children that once strolled on the docks, so similar to you…”\n\nWhat do you know of love? the Sea Snake wanted to yell, jumping on his feet. Do you think it comes and goes, mirroring the tides?\n\nLaenor knew a lot about love, more than Corlys could fathom in the instant, for the only reason that he hadn’t spent enough time with him when Joffrey was still alive.\n\nThe way Laenor still mourned him was a tribute to the way he was raised, surrounded by loving parents - never mind that he was also taught that love was little compared to a crown.\n\n“Enough,” the Sea Snake seethed. “What your mother ignores cannot hurt her - and I love your mother. I will not allow past affairs to cause her more harm, she has suffered enough.”\n\n“She knows, father,” Laenor whispered. “About me. About you. About those children you sired.”\n\nWhen Laena died, perhaps she had wondered if somewhere in the world, another little girl looked just like her.\n\nShe had missed her daughter so much, perhaps she would have been glad to meet her.\n\n“Have you come to torment me?”\n\n“I came to set you free.”\n\nAt those words, Lord Corlys frowned.\n\n“Free?”\n\nLaenor nodded.\n\n“You crossed your king when you insulted the princess by only doing what her heart desired, but you, my lord, are guilty of the same sin. Only you were born a man, not a woman. Even if you were already shackled into marriage, it mattered not to your station, to your very life, to wander and fuck as many maidens as you liked.”\n\nGirls aren’t granted the same privileges, they should either flee or run.\n\nRhaenyra chose to run. I shall not berate her for that.\n\nHis father’s body trembled with anger.\n\n“And yet she stands, happy and content, well fed and protected despite her choices, while my wife has done nothing but fight for her claim, one that she threw away, and she has deemed fair to do nothing.”\n\nCorlys paced in the room, something he hadn’t stopped doing since the night he was locked in.\n\n“Time to do nothing is done, father,” Laenor stated. “King Viserys has fallen, he was poisoned.”\n\nAt this, Lord Corlys paused, turning on his heels.\n\nShocked.\n\n“Does he live?”\n\n“That remains to be seen, or so Gerardys claimed. It was a conspiracy, it appears. The maesters were plotting to assassinate both the king and his heir, seemingly to crown Aegon the Usurper.”\n\nAll blood drained from Corlys’ cheeks.\n\n“The maesters,” he repeated.\n\nHe needed to sit down.\n\nOh, he remembered Mellos’ visit while he was scouring the study, looking for anything that might help him rescue Rhaenys.\n\nHow he had taunted him, played with his grief, his anger.\n\nHis ambitions.\n\nDear gods, what a fool he had been, he realized now, hiding his face in his hand to think. The words had been stated so clearly, without any nuance, and yet Corlys had done nothing.\n\nHe hadn’t denounced him, he had let him leave with only a warning.\n\nLaenor tilted his head, wondering why the information afflicted him so deeply.\n\n“This morning, the princess decided to hire thieves and send them to Dorne. Princess Rhaenys shall be freed from her cell in secret. Hence, she will not be bargained, fought over like a bone, and she will not have to wait until the crown is ready to conquer Dorne.”\n\nThe Sea Snake took a deep breath.\n\nCan it be true? he mused. After so long, is it fair to play with a grieving man’s hopes?\n\n“Did she tell you herself?”\n\n“She did,” he replied. “I have been taking care of her boys since the king collapsed. She is sincere, my lord,” he kindly added. “Daemon is to contact and pay someone they trust able to retrieve her without notice, without bloodshed.”\n\nAn anchor was suddenly cut from Lord Corlys’ feet.\n\nDuring all his years at sea, he had sometimes fallen into the waves, but had never been close to drown - yet he had been drowning, those last two years without his wife, knowing that she was a prisoner.\n\nHe had been drowning on guilt, on grief.\n\nWhat if she had died there, in a foreign territory, and they had parted in anger?\n\nWhat if she had died, and he had never been allowed to say goodbye, to voice how much he had loved her, his wife, and the mother of his children?\n\nWhat if he were to lose half of his soul to the same land that had taken his daughter?\n\n“Is she is coming home?”\n\nIn that moment, he sounded like a child.\n\n“Yes, father. We will bring mother home. I myself will go with those rogues to make sure that she does.”\n\nOh, gods be good.\n\nOut of a sudden, the Sea Snake started to laugh, taking Laenor aback as it echoed in the room - until it shattered, and his father cried.\n\n“She is coming home,” he cried, and only then did he realize that he had grieved her while she had been still alive.\n\nOnly then did he look at Laenor and fathomed than they weren’t that different, after all. Carrying the memories of their loved one.\n\nLaenor danced on his feet, drained from this conversation.\n\n“I will leave you be, father. You are free to roam, but I advise you not to wander too close from the royal house if you are not yet ready to apologize.”\n\nHe was to leave when his father called him back.\n\n“Wait,” Corlys stated. “There is something you must know. Something Rhaenyra should know.”\n\nLaenor waited, arching his brows.\n\n“Mellos came to me, before that sad diner,” he confessed, and his son’s eyes widened. “He talked of everything I had lost to the crown, and how little I was paid back.”\n\n“You conspired with a traitor?”\n\nThe knight was appalled, breathless.\n\n“No,” Corlys countered, vexed that he might consider it. “Yet I didn’t stop him from talking. He called Aegon The Pretender the rightful heir to the throne, and I did not denounce him.”\n\nI should have.\n\nIf he had known that the king would pay the price for that silence, he would have.\n\n“Mellos was arrested, in any case.”\n\n“But there is more. He tried to negotiate Rhaenys’ life in exchange for my loyalty, and the rest of my ships. When I thought their cause might be doomed, he confessed that they were more armed than we thought.”\n\nLaenor scowled, confused.\n\n“Daemon’s dragon destroyed most of their forces, they can’t have possibly recovered from that many losses so fast.”\n\n“They haven’t,” he replied. “Their strength comes from another army. One that was reckoned to be decimated, decades ago.”\n\nSomehow, at those words, Laenor seemed to grasp what it was about.\n\nStill, for good measure, Lord Corlys voiced it nonetheless.\n\n“Tell the princess that the Faith Militant is resurgent, and they declare for Aegon.”\n\nAs daylight slowly died, the princess remained at her father’s bedside.\n\nHe had regained consciousness, even if briefly.\n\nA good sign, once again.\n\n“You were poisoned, Your Grace,” Maester Gerardys had explained. “It appears there was a… conspiracy against the crown.”\n\nThe mere word had seemed to cause Viserys a headache.\n\n“A conspiracy…”\n\nHe brought a hand to his forehead and asked for water. Despite the skilled gestures of the maid, the king almost choked on it, his throat so sore and damaged.\n\nHe might never be able to taste sweet again.\n\nThe queen tried to tell him what had been done and decided, but he was unfocused, and did not react to anything that was stated. Neither as a king, nor as a subject, did he argue against the fates awaiting the maesters, those who had tended to him for years; nor did he blink when she spoke of the Faith Militant.\n\n“We should let him sleep some more,” the queen stated, and the last trusted maester agreed. “Nothing of it makes sense to him.”\n\nShe rose from her chair. Now that his life wasn’t in immediate danger, she had no patience nor strength to keep vigil; and it wasn’t like Viserys would have watched over her, should she be lying down in pain.\n\nFor the four times that she had torn herself apart to bring his children into this world, he hadn’t bothered to stay a single night by her side.\n\nNever, if he couldn’t invite himself between her legs.\n\n“Let us get all some rest, we may need it for the battles to come.”\n\nOnly Rhaenyra decided otherwise.\n\n“I will stay.”\n\nThe door was shut behind the queen, and they were alone.\n\nThe king, the princess, the prince.\n\nThe characters of a narrative that they had lost control of.\n\nIt was never supposed to be like this, Rhaenyra mused. If only her father had let her, their house wouldn’t be that haunted.\n\nThey would not stand in a cold room despite the wild embers of the heart, but in broad sunlight. Viserys could have been satisfied with the son he did have, just as they used to be in their Bravoosi home.\n\nWe were splendidly happy, weren’t we?\n\n“Shall I take Visenya with me, princess?”\n\n“You call me like that again,” she stated, a tiny smile on her lips. “For ten years, you kept silent. You weren’t allowed to call me like this.”\n\n“Why, you are a princess again, my love. One day, I will call you my queen.”\n\nPerhaps sooner than anticipated.\n\nRhaenyra smiled, mission the kiss of the sun on her face, the brustling of the tree leaves as she lay down in the gardens.\n\nThe scent of lemons.\n\nDaemon tilted his head.\n\n“Are you angry with me?”\n\n“Do I have reasons to be angry with you?”\n\nDaemon paced in the room, avoiding to look at his brother.\n\n“About what happened earlier, with your sister.”\n\n“Oh,” Rhaenyra said. “Have you apologized to her?”\n\nA silence was her reply.\n\n“Perhaps you should.”\n\nThe prince hummed, postponing the moment where he would have to consider it.\n\n“Even you must fathom it strange that out of every word she could have invoked, she screamed of deadly strawberries.”\n\n“That doesn’t seem that strange to me at all, husband. Not if our legends are true.”\n\nDaemon stayed silent as swallowed the implication of her statement. He didn’t to misspeak, to argue.\n\nEspecially not in this room.\n\n“You still believe your sister is a dreamer.”\n\nRhaenyra didn’t deny it, humming soft lullabies to their daughter.\n\n“I know that she is,” she countered. “The things she has seen, what she told my father, Daemon…”\n\nThey already had had this conversation, and it had upset her enough to think of someone spying on them, sharing their story with the king without their knowledge.\n\nIt was rubbish, a tale for children.\n\n“That’s a lie, a coincidence at best.”\n\n“Is that what made you release her when she told you my father would one day see you for what you are?”\n\nHe wouldn’t form it with those words, ever.\n\n“Such is the tool of trickster, princess. They play with our weaknesses and call it magic.”\n\nRhaenyra furrowed her brows, parting her lips to argue - but renounced it.\n\nShe said that you should never go to Harrenhal, she mused. How is that a lie?\n\nHow is that a trick, uncle?\n\nRhaenyra sighed.\n\n“I do not wish to quarrel with you.”\n\nHer husband didn’t appear in a better mood for an argument, and only rubbed his hand on his face as Rhaenyra still scoured her little girl’s features.\n\n“Do you think it has changed?” she wondered. “Our home in Braavos. Have the Darries housed other guests there, since we left it without even leaving a note?”\n\nComing closer to her despite his urge to run out of the room, Daemon put his hands on her shoulders.\n\n“I think we taught them to despise having guests, my love. I’d be surprised to hear they ever allowed anyone else under their roof again.”\n\nRhaenyra chuckled, a spark of laughter drowned in melancholia.\n\n“It doesn’t matter, I suppose. Our part is here, whether we want it or not.”\n\nA pressed a kiss on the crown of her head.\n\n“One day, Rhaenyra, we will love under lemon trees again.”\n\nHer eyes were veiled with tears when he caught her gaze, his second hand strolling in Visenya’s thin hair.\n\n“Do you promise?”\n\nThere was no oath better sealed than a kiss, since he wasn’t willing to unsheath his dagger and swear it in blood.\n\nIn his sleep, Viserys stirred.\n\nDaemon paused, waiting to see if his brother was to open his eyes - but he only remained still.\n\n“I shall go.”\n\nRhaenyra’s heart clenched, her husband’s ghosts loud in her head.\n\n“Won’t you stay with me?”\n\n“I will go with the boys. Laenor deserves a break from his duty as a sworn shield, does he not?”\n\nThere was hardly a thing she could argue about her husband spending time with their children in such troubled times.\n\nMy dearest boys, she mused, keeping vigil over the king. If only we had stayed away.\n\nVisenya alone still slept in her arms, the princess unwilling to let go of her. The little girl did not seem to mind, for she had fallen asleep with her mother’s nipple still in her mouth, like forbidding her to put her back in a cradle.\n\n“Rhaenyra…”\n\nThe princess raised her gaze, and gasped.\n\nViserys father was awake, once again.\n\n“Father,” she rasped, bolting from her seat, worried to be lonely with him if he needed a physician. “I should call for Gerardys -”\n\n“No, no,” he coughed. “I have had enough of hands on me those last hours. Let me simply look at you.”\n\nSwallowing, Rhaenyra sat down.\n\nFor the first time since he had collapsed, he seemed able to keep his both eyes open. Maybe it had been a trick, and he was never sick at all - he only wanted a reason to keep her by his side.\n\nHe reached out to touch the little girl’s back.\n\n“How she has grown, since the day she was born,” he contemplated. “I hadn’t noticed how much.”\n\nThus was the funny way of death, wasn’t it? It had a habit to remind the living of everything that they had lost, everything that they could have had.\n\nThe only grandchild born beneath my roof, and I didn’t see her features change.\n\nDid I even witness yours?\n\n“There are so many things I didn’t see in time,” he realized, coughing again. “So much that I need to understand before it is too late.”\n\n“Do not speak like that, Your Grace.”\n\nShe helped him pour a cup of water and bring it to his lips. Once it was drained, she put it back on her nightstand.\n\n“I heard you,” Viserys stated, adjusting his position against the pillows. “The last time you were here alone.”\n\nYou begged me not to leave you. Not to die.\n\nThe proof that I needed, that you wouldn’t hate me forever.\n\nThat he hadn’t lost his little girl forever.\n\nRhaenyra widened her eyes, for she had thought him too far gone to hear her at all.\n\n“What do you remember?”\n\n“I called for you,” he said with a scowl.\n\nThe princess nodded and reached to take his hand.\n\n“What else?”\n\nYou called for him. You called for Daemon.\n\nSay it. Say it until he comes back.\n\nYet Viserys only seemed confused, trying to remember some words he wasn’t sure he had ever spoken aloud.\n\n“You talked of your home, of the sun,” he only replied, and she had to swallow hard disappointment. “You said that in Braavos, even the rain felt warm.”\n\nThe sun, the rain, they are nothing compared to him, father.\n\nHe is what made my house a home, what made sun kisses tender, what made rainfall pour wine.\n\nStill, the king did not utter her husband’s name.\n\n“It did.”\n\nViserys smiled. It almost troubled her, for she would have never bet on him ever smiling when confronting her choice to flee, to live away. Her exile had been his doom - and yet, as he intertwined their fingers, he smiled.\n\n“Tell me more,” he asked. “I want to know about your life there, about the cities you explored. About your children.”\n\n“Do you really, Your Grace?” she asked, arching her brows. “Or would these tales be another cross you’ll feel cursed to bear?”\n\nThe bitter accusation here, Viserys chose to ignore.\n\n“Tell me,” he repeated. “I need to know there is more than this miserable life, Rhaenyra, and you… you are proof that there is.”\n\n“Where should I stop, father?” she wondered with a strangled sob, for her story was void if not filled with Daemon’s name, her children would not exist, if not tied to his being. “In these twelve years of exile, what is there that you do not wish to hear?”\n\nEvery inch, every bit of her story was tangled with him - and the most difficult thing the king might ever demand would be to narrate it without ever speaking his name.\n\nViserys closed his eyes, stroking the back of her hand with his thumb.\n\nPerhaps the Stranger’s breath on his face had made him stronger.\n\n“Nothing,” he replied. “Tell me all of it, spare me nothing. Wonders and love alike, Rhaenyra.”\n\nAwestruck, Rhaenyra did. It was the first time that someone asked to hear of her tale, not an altered version.\n\nHer father, of all people, listened, mesmerized.\n\nHe listened as she spoke about the Disputed Lands, the colors of the clothes, the fish. Volantis and it's unforgiving nights, the coats Daemon bought her, the smell of the spices coming from the market.\n\nThere are so different from anything we might taste here, father. It took me years to grow used to it.\n\nHe listened as she told him about her first bath, when she learned how to swim, how the prince’s palace was grand, and welcoming, and even how they ought to escape to a smaller home, six moons after their arrival - though she was kind enough not to bring up vivid descriptions of the brothels, the inns and the dens that the bards described in their lustful songs.\n\nLight always seems warmer by the sea.\n\nHe listened as she smiled, talking about her weddings, his thumb tracing the scar left by dragon glass on the palm of her hand.\n\n“I wish I had been there,” he breathed, so lowly she wondered if it was meant for her to hear.\n\nI wish I could rewrite the past.\n\nFinally, he listened as she spoke of Braavos.\n\nThe bath, the lemon trees, the pond.\n\nI swam there, once. When I thought I was bidding this place farewell.\n\nOh, he teared up at the thought. She had loved that garden so much, and she was now hanging on to those memories just like he had been hanging on to her.\n\n“My dear, you have been so fortunate,” he rasped.\n\nSo lucky that it hurt.\n\nBy the end of her story, he wished he, too, had known a place half as peaceful as what she described. A library filled with tales that reminded them of their love affair, while he had never even thought of seeking Aemma in songs, in paintings, in the pages of books.\n\nOnly on his daughter’s face.\n\nRhaenyra talked of Aegon, of the night they first discussed his existence in her womb, but Daemon had guessed first. He had been the first to know, in truth; but for the second time, she had managed to keep it a secret.\n\nViserys smiled, almost proud, that she had been able to conceal it only to surprise him when it had suited her.\n\n“Clever,” he beamed, a headache coming to taunt him.\n\nAegon was an endless topic, and so were the lullabies Daemon happily sang - but, Viserys had discovered by himself.\n\nWho would have thought you were a singer, brother?\n\nShe talked of the rains, on how long they lasted. Her second pregnancy hadn’t deterred her from riding in the wild, even in the rain, and he squinted his eyes, almost glaring.\n\n“What were you thinking?” he scolded her, resisting the urge to lecture her as she was a child, not a mother thrice. “In the pouring rain?”\n\nBut Rhaenyra just laughed.\n\n“Daemon loathed it too,” she said, lost in her memories. “He waited for me by the windowsill, feigning to read. I had to promise it was the last time of the season after that.”\n\nThe king nodded, agreeing without realizing it with his brother.\n\nShe talked of the runes, of the sun carved on Viserys’ crib, on the mermaid stories Daemon lured him to sleep with. That boy was like tied to her hip, he never wanted to let go of her - only sweet lemon cakes would sometimes allow her some reprieve.\n\nHe closed his eyes, eventually, but asked her not to leave.\n\n“Stay,” he begged. “I would be happy to hear more.”\n\nIf the tales were draining him, he denied it. For so long he had refused to hear, refused to see, but as he kept his eyelids shut, suddenly he could dream it, just as Helaena had described.\n\nPerhaps this was what it felt like for Daemon to read, to have events turn to life in one’s mind.\n\nFinally, she talked of Visenya.\n\nHer story was already so great, for a soul so young.\n\nTears rolled down his face, and she wondered if she had gone too far, or talked too much. He had been the one asking for it, yet it wouldn’t be against his nature not to complain about some harm he would have himself caused.\n\nYet, he kept on smiling, and cupped her jaw.\n\n“What a life you have lived, my dearest child.”\n\nRhaenyra’s smile was constricted, and her tongue was dry. It wasn’t easy to confess twelve years of travels, of love - and it had only been the good parts, the beautiful parts.\n\n\"I love him, father.\"\n\nViserys smiled.\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nRhaenyra took a deep breath, close to tears.\n\nWill you ever know how much?\n\nThat doubt, she kept to herself.\n\nThe betrayal, the losses, she kept them to herself. Perhaps one day, he would ask to hear about them too, if he was brave enough to listen being the villain in her narrative.\n\nNot the dashing hero rescuing a princess, or slaying a dragon to free a maiden from a tower.\n\nOnly a greedy king, unwilling to share her, turning into a shield between her body and her happiness.\n\n\"Tell him,\" she begged, sobs trapped in her throat. \"Tell him that you know the truth of us. He needs to hear it, father...\"\n\nViserys wailed, pleading for milk of the poppy.\n\nTime for confessions was over, it seemed.\n\n“I should go,” she declared. “I have tired you enough with my words.”\n\n“No, Rhaenyra,” the king countered as Gerardys entered the room. “You might have given me what I needed.”\n\nThe princess frowned, and while she knew she shouldn’t insist, for the king seemed on the edge of falling asleep again, she couldn’t resist.\n\n“The truth?”\n\nThe king shook his head, taking a long breath before draining his cup.\n\n“The key to redemption.”\n\nThe queen tied a cloak around her shoulders as she readied herself to climb down the stairs to the courtyard, where the carriages were almost ready to depart.\n\nThe air of the night was more bitter than he fathomed, and she regretted not taking a coat. Yet, she knew that where they were headed, she certainly wouldn’t regret the lack of warmth.\n\nWhat must those souls feel, if I tremble at the simple thought of witnessing what awaits them?\n\nHer eyes were locked on Helaena, her feet anchored on the ground.\n\nAlready a silver nightgown, her hair running in her back.\n\nOn her way down the stairs, Rhaenyra turned to her.\n\n“Are you staying here, sister?”\n\nDespite the night falling, or perhaps thanks to it, Rhaenyra could easily read sparks of magic in the princess’ eyes, the lines of a prophecy she still struggled to voice.\n\n“I do not wish to see people burn again.”\n\nAt those words, the older princess glanced at Alicent, as confused as her.\n\n“When did you see someone burning?”\n\nYet Helaena kept looking at her, until the Kingsguard informed them that everything was ready.\n\nAlicent didn’t wish to go, either, and would have the princess been a little younger, she would have used her as an excuse not to go.\n\nNot today, however. They needed to be a family.\n\nThey needed to be one, unbent, unyielding to their enemies.\n\nShe walked to kiss her little’s girl cheek, cradling her hair.\n\n“Ask for the maids to make you tea before you go to bed. It will soothe you.”\n\nHeleana smiled, but didn’t reply. While Alicent was glad to spare her the sight of men being put to death, she knew well where they were headed, and it didn’t seem to trouble her.\n\nPerhaps, in her dreams, she had seen it too.\n\nRhaenyra reached the carriage, and before a guard could open its door, Daemon did in her stead.\n\nNot burdened by the gravity of what they ought to do, he shamelessly observed her from head to toe. His wife was gorgeous draped in crimson red, her hair well braided, silver embroidery sewed to her shoulders making it look like flames.\n\nA necklace of Valyria steel hung around her neck, one that she hadn’t worn in a very long time.\n\nA silver tiara circled her head, adorned with rubies.\n\n“What a last sight you make, my love.”\n\nRhaenyra glared, yet her cheeks turned pink at the praise.\n\nShe went inside the carriage, and Alicent followed her, a sneer and a grimace on her face as she passed in front of him, as if revulsed.\n\nIt made him chuckle, before jumping in the carriage as well.\n\nFive stakes were erected in front of the dragon pit, green wood put at the bottom of each of them.\n\nA state had been built on the side, right by the entrance of the pit. In memory, no one remembered ever witnessing such an execution.\n\nDrawn like moths to a flame, the smallfolk had gathered around the pit, as far from the stakes as they could. People lacked entertainment, the queen reckoned, walking to the stage, eyeing how many people had made the long journey to witness this.\n\nThey liked seeing blood being spilled, poor souls screaming.\n\nThe entire city wasn’t there, yet the smoke reaching the sky, the whole of King’s Landing shall see.\n\nRhaenyra slightly hoisted up her skirts to not stumble on it as she reached the stairs to the stage. The court had set eyes on her when she had returned, but her father’s subjects surely hadn’t seen her since she had been a girl.\n\nIf they had ever seen her at all.\n\nShe was afraid to fall, to make a fool of herself. Minding her steps, she kept her face close, emptying her heart from any emotion but fury.\n\nThree thrones awaited them - and only when they were seated did Ser Harrold give the command to bring the prisoners forward.\n\nDrums echoed in the depth of the pit, and five men were dragged in chains, tears already streaming down their red faces, their grim shifts soaked with piss.\n\nThe sight made Alicent nauseous, she had to look up at the sky, begging the Mother to make her nerves of steel. Stars had abandoned her, too, for none in the sky shone to tell her that her prayer was heard.\n\nHow cruel it is, Rhaenyra mused, to push them out of the darkness only to make them meet with the light of the flames.\n\nMaybe it was cruel - but it also was justice.\n\nHer father might have died without bidding farewell to the stars too, and they would have called it the will of the Seven.\n\nThe guards pulled on their chains as they tried to wrestle, to break free.\n\n“No!”\n\nShackles prevented them from running, yet two of them fell, stepping on them.\n\nSome people laughed.\n\nRhaenyra stayed silent, and swallowed a lump in her throat.\n\n“Princess!” the maesters called, desperate to catch her attention, to beg for mercy. “Please, princess! Your Grace!”\n\n“Princess, this is a mistake, a terrible mistake!”\n\n“No, please, no!”\n\nFor a brief second, she closed her eyes, shutting down her heart.\n\nDaemon took her hand.\n\n“Those people wanted Viserys dead,” Daemon said. “They wanted you dead. Our sons dead.”\n\nYou were right to demand their heads, and not allow the hydra to live.\n\nMore would have been sent.\n\nThe princess pursed her lips.\n\n“I know.”\n\nNo mercy for such vile, wicked intentions.\n\nAt last, she gathered what they were hoping to escape. It was the flames of the torches that the guards held, certain that they would be used to set their stakes on fire.\n\nShe almost sneered.\n\nIt wasn’t the torches that they should fear.\n\nOnce again, Rhaenyra scoured the surroundings of the pit, astonished by how many people were there. After tonight, the Seven Kingdom would never doubt her fire again.\n\n“No!”\n\nThe maesters kept protesting, struggling not to be tied to their stakes, but they were hardly soldiers.\n\nThe White Cloaks handled with easily, tying them securely to the place of execution.\n\n“Princess, please!”\n\nAlicent, too, closed her eyes, her heart nearly exploding from guilt.\n\nShe realized she was picking at her nails, but for once, she indulged herself, and did not compel herself to stop.\n\nAt her side, Laenor and Lord Corlys waited, their hands clasped behind their backs.\n\nThey had accepted the Sea Snake’s apology and his oath of loyalty renewed with good grace, the information regarding the Faith Militant good to take.\n\nAgain, Rhaenyra looked for someone’s face who didn’t appear to be there.\n\n“Is Aemond not coming?”\n\nI thought I had asked our whole house to be present, lest we count the children.\n\nAnd Helaena.\n\nDid you already see them burn in your head, sister?\n\n“I sent a note, he was informed of the execution,” Alicent answered. “He should already be here.”\n\nRhaenyra scowled.\n\n“Hmm.”\n\nWhat of Aegon? Daemon had asked, quietly enough for the boy not to hear. He is your heir.\n\nHe is a child.\n\nMany kings would argue a prince is never a child, my love.\n\nHer son would be, and she wouldn’t crush his mind with such cruelty yet.\n\nHe has seen enough horrors for his young age, I believe.\n\nA feat Daemon had to agree with.\n\nFinally, the prisoners were tightly chained to the stakes, their bindings too strong for them to wrestle. Beside turning their heads to their right, and imploring their princess for mercy one last time, their fates were sealed.\n\nCan I really do it? Rhaenyra wondered, rolling a ring on her finger. Those people tended to you when you were young.\n\nThey had also tended to her mother before she died, to Alyssa, to countless other women that had found their end in the birthing bed with no other witness than quiet midwives and maesters.\n\nWhat if it was wrong?\n\nWhat if they are innocent?\n\nWhat if their scheme had lasted longer than she had thought?\n\n“Will you do it, dārilaros, or shall I?”\n\nRhaenyra hesitated, the protests of the maesters gathered to die were difficult to hear. It had been her idea, her sentence - yet she wasn’t a cold-hearted woman.\n\nHer duty, she would accomplish, but she wouldn’t smile at it.\n\n“Have you ever heard what the Northerners claim? The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.”\n\nThe princess wasn’t nearly a man, yet she would be more than a king, tonight.\n\nFor those men, she would be a goddess, a fate holding their lives in her hands, and deciding their time was up.\n\nThe men kept crying, Mellos worst of all, until the drums summoned silence from the crowd.\n\nOh, at the sight of Lord Corlys by the queen’s side, he knew he was fucked.\n\n“Coward!” he yelled, knowing he had been betrayed, and his secret with him.\n\nHe was too for his words to be carried by the wind.\n\nDaemon rose from his seat, and waved his hand.\n\nThe drums stopped.\n\n“Maesters,” he began, his voice loud and strong, booming in the void. “You are gathered here tonight to answer for your crimes against the crown. It was proven that you have broken your sacred oath to loyally serve both your king and the realm.”\n\nThe smallfolk whispered.\n\nWhat have they done?\n\nThey poisoned the king, you fool, haven’t you heard? other replied. It was a conspiracy.\n\nAll of them?\n\nIt would have been exposed, if that many people were aware of such a plot. One of them would have ceded, broke, and confessed.\n\nWhether they believed it or not, five maesters would atone. Each of those that had studied and worked under Rucinter’s care.\n\n“The punishment for that crime is death.”\n\nNo! the men still pleaded. They couldn’t help but eye the guards holding torches, so certain that those flames would ignite the stakes, make them their pyres.\n\nNo, princess, my prince, it’s a lie!\n\nBut still, neither the queen, the prince or the princess yielded to mercy.\n\nKeep your tears for the flames. You wield more chance to dampen fire than to move hearts of embers.\n\n“White Cloaks,” Daemon continued. “Take the chain of their Order off. Traitors will not die as maesters.”\n\nA last humiliation before standing in front of the Father.\n\nAgain, the smallfolk whispered, Rhaenyra wished she could make sense of what they were saying.\n\nThe Seven, should they exist, would welcome them as men, sinners, criminals.\n\nNot as any kind of devoted servants.\n\nBack in the king’s chamber, Rhaenyra briefly wondered what old Gerardys thought of it, if it hurt to fathom his peers’ clothes licked by flames, their chains torn away and meant to melt.\n\nHe hadn’t dared speak a word about the sentence, and only renewed his oath. One that neither Daemon nor Rhaenyra had doubted.\n\n“For those who should pledge themselves to the Usurper, or those who would strive to tear the House of the Dragon down, let this be a reminder that there shall be no mercy.”\n\nHis part was done, and so he sat down.\n\nLooking at his wife.\n\nIt was her turn to stand up, taking a deep breath.\n\nThe princess kept her chin up as she called for an ancient beast to come and join her.\n\n“Naejot māzīs, Syrax.”\n\nHigh Valyrian, they did not all speak perfectly well, but those two simple words, they all understood.\n\nCome forward.\n\nThe smallfolk knew not High Valyrian, but what she had summoned, they understood as well.\n\nSyrax.\n\nThe maesters’ cries died on their lips as screeches were heard coming from the heart of the pit.\n\nFrom what seemed to be the darkest circle of the seven hells.\n\nNo, the maesters all despaired. No!\n\nAmong all of the ways they had imagined themselves dying, this one, they hadn’t picture.\n\nThis one, they had thought, was for nightmares, only.\n\nAs the large, broad figure emerged from the shade of the pit, and the golden dragon walked out of the shadow and into the night, the smallfolk stayed silent.\n\nAll until Syrax roared.\n\nHer breath startling the guards and the prisoners alike, resonating in the night.\n\n“Naejot.”\n\nAgain, her command was of death.\n\nForward.\n\nRhaenyra’s voice was firm, fearless.\n\nHer dragon turned to her, and through their bond, she knew what her rider expected.\n\nSyrax had played this game once, already, when commanded to ignite the pyre of a queen.\n\nNever yet the stakes of traitors.\n\nAnother roar, and the dragon indeed walked forward.\n\nDaemon was compelled by the sight of Syrax walking, guided by his wife’s voice.\n\nShe would follow you in the dark, in the abyss, he mused. Like a hawk.\n\nThe dragon keepers stayed close but did not interfere. It wasn’t their duty, today, to make sure she didn’t harm anyone.\n\nThe maesters’ cries were quiet, their hearts racing in their chest.\n\nIt ought to be a dream, a trick, a terrible mistake.\n\nThe gods’ wit was dark, for Rhaenyra’s heart also raced. It was a dance, a play, and they all had to fulfill their parts.\n\nFor once, she wasn’t just a girl in a council of men, a child who knew nothing surrounded by physicians always knowing better.\n\nShe was her father’s heir.\n\nDoes it feel like this to be a son? I shall be better than any of them.\n\nA quick glance to the queen told her to close her eyes if she wished, and so Alicent did.\n\nHer voice didn’t falter as she spoke the most important word.\n\n“Dracarys.”\n\nOnly when Syrax opened her jaw did the maesters scream, at least, catching glimpses of merciless fire beaming at the bottom of the beast’s throat before it swallowed them all.\n\nSyrax dashed, sparing her fire for no one, and the rows of people gathered behind the stages almost scattered out of fear, afraid that they might be mistaken for the monster’s next meal.\n\nA river of flames enlightened the starless night, the stakes burning to the ground.\n\nIt was a cruel, yet a quick death. The wait, the anticipation made it worse than the flames, and Rhaenyra fathomed not better fitting end for any rider.\n\nPerhaps they would ride those flames down to the hells.\n\nAs dark smoke filled the sky, the Rogue Prince watched, mesmerized by the dance of fire. By his side, Rhaenyra eyed the flames, her lips slightly parted.\n\nWhat is running in your mind now, my love?\n\nBefore he could ask, at his left someone appeared out of nowhere.\n\nHe was impossible to mistake. Tall, long hair, one eye.\n\nPerhaps he had been there since the beginning.\n\n“Nephew,” Daemon said, surprised. “We all wondered if you would grant us your presence here.”\n\nWere you waiting for me?\n\nAemond smirked.\n\n“My apologies for being late, uncle. I was being needed elsewhere.”\n\nThough he didn’t elaborate, Daemon knew well enough what sort of duties called for the men of the Watch during agitated nights, and how quickly Flea Bottom could turn into a squalor.\n\n“Rough couple of nights, I have heard.”\n\n“Indeed.”\n\nAnd he hadn’t washed off the blood staining the back of his hand.\n\nDaemon looked back in front of him, where the fire licked dead bodies, the stakes crumbling, turned to ashes.\n\nWhat a show of force you just demonstrated, princess.\n\n“It is good that you managed to come. The city needs to see our house stands as one.”\n\nHe expected Rhaenyra to react, to berate him, even, for she had been waiting for him. Yet she stayed focused on the flames, playing with her rings.\n\n“I wouldn’t miss such a scene for anything in the world,” Aemond replied, his eye locked on the stakes. “Dragon flames are… a wonder.”\n\n“Hmmm.”\n\nHis hands clasped behind his back, the Wicked Prince spoke no more.\n\nThe command had surprised him, for he had fathomed his sister kind-hearted, afraid to bloody her precious hands like his mother.\n\nYet, tonight, she had shown herself fearless. Mayhaps it had been the reason why he had observed her from afar - to see if she would commit to her own sentence or not, if Daemon would be the one having to pass it on those men.\n\nWould you have dashed to your lover’s aid, uncle?\n\nOf course you would have. You are that kind of prince.\n\nOne for nightmares, one for the tales.\n\nTheir father’s heir, she might be, but she certainly hadn’t inherited his cowardness.\n\nUnless a decade by their uncle’s side had tempered that side of her, if it had ever existed.\n\n“In fact, I am very pleased to see you here tonight,” Daemon carried on. “As it happens, I have something to ask of you.”\n\nAemond hummed, turning to him, waiting.\n\nA chance to prove himself, at last.\n\nDaemon lowered his eyes, his voice mysterious.\n\n“Have you ever had the pleasure to work with the White Worm?”"
