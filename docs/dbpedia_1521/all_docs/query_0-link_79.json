        "text": "Well, I never!\n\nKate Middleton and Prince William’s college romance was publicly revealed to their group of friends when one of his ex-girlfriends instigated a game of “Never Have I Ever,” according to a new book.\n\nThe future Princess of Wales, 42, met her prince in 2001 while they were students at St. Andrew’s University in Scotland, where they began a relationship as friends. However, after Kate walked in a charity fashion show wearing a black lace gown, which prompted William to famously declare, “Kate’s hot!” the pair moved out of the friend zone.\n\nBy September 2002, the pair were living together along with two classmates. And, as Robert Jobson reports in his new biography of Catherine, “among the student community, it was an open secret that they were a couple.”\n\nBut whatever secrecy shrouded their relationship, at least on campus, was ripped away after what Jobson calls a “revealing moment” at a dinner party attended by friends of William and Kate, including his ex-girlfriend Carly Massy-Birch.\n\nMassy-Birch, “perhaps unwittingly,” according to Jobson, “exposed William’s secret love affair with Catherine” during a boozy game of “Never Have I Ever,” reportedly “much to the prince’s chagrin.”\n\nJobson cited the work of fellow royal author Katie Nicholl, who, in her 2013 book, “Kate: The Future Queen,” provided additional details about the revelatory evening.\n\n“[Massy-Birch] announced, ‘I’ve never dated two people in this room,’ knowing full well that William was the only one who had because Kate was sitting next to him,” a guest at the party told Nicholl.\n\nAccording to that guest, everyone at the dinner was “in shock.” Prince William, they added, “shot a thunderous look” at his ex and reportedly whispered under his breath, “I can’t believe you just said that.”\n\nWhatever ill will he had toward Massy-Birch seemed to have faded by the time he wed Catherine in 2011, as his former flame was one of a handful of the prince’s exes to snag an invite to the happy couple’s nuptials.\n\nWilliam and Kate were often inseparable during their time together at university, making the revelation of their romance not as surprising to their classmates as it would be to someone outside of St. Andrews.\n\n“They could often be spotted walking or cycling to lectures, browsing the aisles of the local Safeway supermarket, or spending quiet evenings at home, listening to William’s R&B tracks or [their friend] Fergus’s jazz on their music systems,” Jobson writes.\n\n“Their routine rarely deviated during the week, except for Wednesday afternoons when they indulged in sports.”"
