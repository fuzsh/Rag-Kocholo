        "text": "It could be exploring a faraway land or taking in a sunset from your balcony. Dancing the night away in a cozy lounge or enjoying an intimate meal and conversation in an elegant restaurant. Your favorite moment with your soulmate could be anything – or everything – when you choose the “Best Cruise Line for Romance.”*\n\n*2016 Cruise Critic Editors’ Picks Awards\n\nTurquoise waters, swaying palms, secluded white-sand beaches: this is bliss. It’s no wonder the Caribbean is our top destination for weddings, honeymooners and couples just craving an escape. With over 30 island ports to choose from, the two of you can sightsee, snorkel, shop… or, yes, just lounge side-by-side. Because sometimes the most romantic thing you can do together is nothing at all.\n\nWhere will you write the next chapters of your love story? Swimming Corfu’s sparkling waters; cozied up in a Venetian gondola; people-watching in a Paris café; biking the Tuscan hills; or strolling the streets of Rome? Let the destination experts take you to these enchanting settings. You two can take it from there. When you share the world with the one you love, you create memories to share forever.\n\nIt’s just the two of you – discovering a hidden waterfall, strolling a black-sand beach under a scarlet sunset, gazing up at a billion gleaming stars. You’re not dreaming. You’re in Maui or Kauai on a relaxing, romantic Princess vacation. Lose yourselves in the natural wonders of Hawaii and you’ll find the true meaning of Paradise: experiencing the perfect place with that special person.\n\nSee how it takes two to tango in a ballroom dance class. Request the song you call yours from the live band. Test how well you know each other in the Marriage Match Game Show. Get on the Kiss Cam at the Love Boat Disco Deck Party. Learn how to say “I love you” in a different language. Opportunities to bond are everywhere.\n\nApologies to Shakespeare, but food is the food of love. Imagine Valentine’s Day without chocolate, or a date without Champagne. Not here. Savor a romantic dinner for two at one of our specialty restaurants or on your private balcony. Sweeten the deal with a chocolate and wine tasting. Play, or rather, eat on!\n\nRide a horse-drawn carriage through Tuscan vineyards. Share a picnic lunch after visiting an active volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii. Surround yourself with beauty in bloom at the Butchart Gardens in Victoria. Rediscover your sense of wonder and why you fell in love in the first place on award-winning excursions.\n\nLeave the hustle and bustle behind in the Lotus Spa®, your haven away from home. Indulge in a couples’ massage. Primp for formal night — or just a night out — with any of our special salon services. Make the most of days free of obligation, where the only item on your to-do list is enjoying spending time together.\n\nReflect on the road you’ve traveled together in quiet moments and larger-than-life adventures. It’s easy at sea, when you have the time and space to focus on one another. Anniversaries are the most popular reason our guests sail, so we make sure they get their due, offering packages that add a festive touch. Better yet, renew your vows in a personalized ceremony on board.\n\nAs The Love Boat®, we're all about romance. Come aboard for a wedding ceremony or vow renewal, performed by your ship’s captain! You can't beat the cost and convenience — we handle every detail for much less than land-based venues — or the views.\n\nPop the question with a Princess® Perfect Proposal package that makes sure it all goes without a hitch (except the one you want). Planning your honeymoon? The sea is the limit with more than 250 itineraries to 330 destinations.\n\nSee the options for your proposal and your honeymoon as well as other romance packages\n\nSing “Auld Lang Syne” as balloons drop on a New Year’s sailing that kicks off the new year in style. Make this the best Valentine’s Day ever on “The Love Boat,” enjoying events and activities you won’t find anywhere else. When every day is like a holiday, special celebrations occur on an even grander scale."
