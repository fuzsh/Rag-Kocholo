Though I’ve known about Barbie since I was a kid, I didn’t take much interest in the franchise until I was an adult when I started watching Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures. It’s a show that I find pretty charming given how fun and likable the cast is and how well written the messages are. Of course, it’s not exactly for everyone given how it does go for a more down to earth style that people don’t usually associate with Barbie. The fact that future movies and TV shows take place in the same continuity as the show might not be for everyone because of this, but I personally don’t mind it as long as said projects capture what makes the show great. Admittedly, it’s more because of how this is the Barbie I’m most familiar with, but I’ve seen some early 2000s and and 2010s movies. Anyway, I feel that the subject of today’s review, the movie Barbie: Princess Adventure, captures what makes the show great, albeit with some issues. Spoilers are ahead.\n\nLet me give you the synopsis of the movie. Barbie: Princess Adventure is the 37th Barbie movie, released to Netflix on September 1, 2020. As mentioned, it’s set in the continuity of Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures, and has all the returning voice actors. Key among them are America Young & Ellie Moore as the speaking and singing voices for Barbie, Cristina Milizia for Teresa, Emma Galvin for Daisy, Stephanie Sheh for Renee, Desirae Whitfield for Nikki, Ritesh Rajan for Ken, and Eamon Brennan for Trey, among others. Written by Ann Austen and directed by Conrad Helten, who are veterans of the show and franchise overall, the movie sees Barbie and her friends going on a class field trip to Floravia. It’s there where she meets the princess of Floravia, that being Princess Amelia (voiced by former Barbie voice actress Erica Lindbeck when speaking, and former Barbie singing voice Jordyn Kane when singing). The two of them then decide to switch places. The two of them then decide to switch places while dealing with their own personal conflicts. Barbie wants to impress a social media influencer named Rose Ross (voiced by Tara Sands, albeit uncredited) so that her vlog can reach more people while Amelia yearns to have some freedom before she becomes queen. However, things take a dangerous turn when someone tries to take over Floravia. When it comes to the reception behind the movie, it’s very interesting. You either have people comparing it to other Barbie movies that involve switching places with a princess (whether for good or bad) or those that talk about it on its own merits. That’s fair enough. There isn’t really much discussion about how the movie captures the spirit of the show though. As such, that’s what I’m doing for this review. The overall message of the movie is about standing up for what you believe in and not be forced to do what others expect of you. It fits perfectly well with the spirit of the show. Let’s talk about what works with the movie and what doesn’t work in capturing the spirit of the show. Spoilers are ahead.\n\nLet’s start out with Barbie herself. She’s definitely in top form here. That’s due to three things, compassion, maturity, and understanding. She displays a great deal of all three towards just about everyone and just wants to inspire people with her message. A good example is at the beginning, when she’s trying to come up with ideas for a vlog with help from her parents George and Margaret (voiced by Greg Chun and Lisa Fuson) alongside Daisy. As two of her younger sisters, Skipper and Stacie (voiced by Kirsten Day and Cassandra Lee Morris), are playing with laser swords, the youngest sister Chelsea (voiced by Cassidy Naber) comes by and asks if she can play as a laser pirate princess. They don’t exactly say the nicest things by saying how dress up is for babies, but it’s kept pretty light, being more light teasing. Barbie then says how pirates can wear crowns the way that girls can use laser swords. This is definitely pretty nice of hear to say, showing how she’s open minded enough to see how everyone has their own way to play, and one way isn’t better than the other. This carries into the first song of the movie, “Try It On”, where she includes her family and Daisy to take part, showing how she’s inclusive to all. Another moment that stands out comes from when she’s meeting Amelia, and the latter asks her to switch places. She’s understandably hesitant given how this is a big decision. However, she’s also able to assert herself in a way that’s pretty mature. She says upfront how she wants to tell her friends about the switch, which Amelia agrees to as long as she doesn’t tell anyone else. This carries good development from Barbie: Dolphin Magic (the pilot movie for Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures). In that movie, she inadvertently told her sisters about the existence of gemstone dolphins despite telling Isla that she wouldn’t tell anyone else, her justification being that you’re open with your sisters. This movie helps show how she retained that lesson by being upfront with her intentions right away. Even when she says how she wants to do this to help out her vlog, she also wants them both to say what they learned from the experience after this. You honestly can’t help but find her likable.\n\nOf course, the movie knows how to show Barbie’s flaws in a way that still keeps her likable. In this case, it’s with how she can sometimes not think straight when she tries pleasing others. I mean, her first scene in the movie is her looking up to sky for a vlog idea as Daisy wonders what she’s doing. This can definitely show how she doesn’t always think straight when she feels strongly about something. It’s most notable in a later scene in the movie, where she wants to record how Amelia feels about her experience since your strongest feelings usually come from letting them out right away. Although she says that she won’t post about it until after the switch, she then shows it to Rose Ross, who uploads it online and edits it against her well. What ultimately helps make her more rash decisions more likable is with how we’re able to understand her thought process. Much of her character is baked with the idea of wanting to set a good example to others and not let anyone down. Even if we know that some of her decisions are wrong, she’s usually able to justify it to herself by thinking about others. Her behavior here is actually reminiscent of some of my favorite Dreamhouse Adventures episodes, those being “Virtually Famous” (also directed by Conrad Helten) and the 4 parter special “Magical Mermaid Mystery”. The former has her also conflicted about how to go about dealing with someone who cares a bit too much about status (in that case, Teresa, one of her best friends) while the latter has her not wanting to let down her new bosses at the water park despite them being big jerks. This movie combines elements from those episodes well to show her as someone who may not always be on the ball with every situation, but she’s at least trying.\n\nNow let’s talk about Princess Amelia herself. Much like with Barbie herself, she’s shown to be very likable here. The beginning of the movie really helps to show why she wants to yearn for freedom in a way where you can understand her position. She’s a bit overwhelmed with the stardom and trying to keep up a pleasant facade for the camera. In this case, it’s because of a movie she’s shooting where everyone is trying too hard to pamper her. She’s at least still sympathetic here given how she doesn’t try too hard to object to this. Another moment that stands out is later on, when she’s trying to reason with her advisor Alfonso (voiced by Dave Fennoy). She tries to say how she’s 18 now and should start making her own decisions so that she can be her true self rather than having him do everything for her. However, she also says he trained her so well. This little detail really helps in making her likable. It’s proven again later on when she asks Barbie to switch places with her. She says how she wants to find herself and prove to Alfonso that he’s wrong, yet she also doesn’t dismiss the idea that he could be right. Not only that, she also makes sure that Barbie could gain something out of this, a bigger audience so she can spread her message. These little touches really help to show why we should root for her. Even if she makes some boneheaded decisions, like going out to various dance clubs without seemingly some place to stay and having a hard time hiding her identity, you can’t help but find her likable because of how she just wants a sense of freedom without hurting anyone.\n\nI guess I should touch on Alfonso, though I don’t have as much to say about him compared to Amelia. However, he’s still pretty good too. He’s a bit overbearing and strict in thinking that Amelia needs to be constantly cared for even if she says she can make her own decisions. There’s enough emphasis placed on him thinking that he feels that Amelia can’t make her own decisions. Much like with Amelia, there’s little touches that help make him likable too despite his strict demeanor. It’s mainly in how he at least lets Amelia (and later Barbie when he finds out about the switch) get across their points without it turning into a shouting match. In fact, we see more of his strict, but well meaning demeanor when he finds out about the switch, but doesn’t punish Barbie for it. He’s not too much of a presence, but I like when he is on screen.\n\nNow let’s talk about the music. It’s done here by The Math Club, who also did the music for Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures. While some episodes did have songs, this is very much a full blown musical. We have 6 songs in total: Try It On, Somewhere New, Not A Picture Perfect Girl, Life In Color, King Of The Kingdom, and This Is My Moment. While some of them are pop based like in the show, like Try It On, there are some that do have a more grand feel to them, such as Life In Color and Not A Picture Perfect Girl. They’re all really fun to listen to because of how all of them (well, except King Of The Kingdom, but I’ll elaborate later) help move forward the story and establish strong character motivations. I think that’s the key to any good song in a movie.\n\nWith all the praise I can give the movie, I do have some criticisms with it, mainly in how some characters are used. First off, let’s talk about Ken. I think he’s perfectly likable and charming here in how he tries to help Barbie out. Where I think he doesn’t do it for me is with how the story tries to use him. In contrast to most Barbie media, Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures chooses to portray Barbie and Ken as just good friends who have a bit of a mutual crush on each other (as shown in episodes Time Will Tell and Barbie’s Dance Dilemma) rather than being in a romantic relationship. You know what? I don’t mind that. I was hoping that the movie would lean more into him being a supportive friend just like in the show. Instead, he’s forced into a romantic subplot where he tries to tell Barbie how he feels. To be fair, it’s not as intrusive as I thought it would be since it doesn’t take up too much time. Even still, the movie wants you to see Ken as “the guy that wants to be Barbie’s boyfriend” and not much else. I probably wouldn’t mind this if he at least got together with Barbie at the end, but he doesn’t. It feels like there was some mandate to put him in this kind of story because of how most people usually expect him and Barbie to be in a relationship. I mean, Barbie: Dolphin Magic show how a Ken who’s a good friend to Barbie her being romantically linked to Barbie can still be fun to watch. Why not take cues from that movie?\n\nNow let’s talk about Trey. When it comes to Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures, he’s generally an antagonist, moreso in the annoying neighbor sort of way where he’s very egotistical. Just look at episodes like “Sister Class Act” and “All Dogs On The Beach”. It’s usually because of his parents, who are as rich and spoiled as him, or influence from Tammy, who’s basically Barbie if her flaws defined her characters. However, there are also episodes that don’t make him an antagonist. These episodes either play him more for comic relief (like in Family Fun And Games) or make him more sympathetic (like Trey Is For Horses and Chicken Masked Mystery On Ice). I was hoping that the movie would lean more towards the latter. Instead, he’s more like the former. He is still pretty funny here, but it gets old after awhile. Not helped is how he seems dumber here. The kind of behavior that would feel fine in a regular episode since they’re only 22 minutes wears out its welcome in a movie. Where I take more issue with him is during the “King Of The Kingdom” song. There’s a part where he imagines himself on top of a table and surrounded by his classmates, but his ego causes them to leave, making him genuinely sad. It seemed like the movie would capitalize on him and have him learn to be a better person, but it just doesn’t have any impact. Cut out the song, and I think his presentation would’ve been better.\n\nNow let’s talk about the villains of the movie, Prince Johan (voiced by Angelo Restiano) and Rose Ross. When it comes to Rose, I really like her. She’s vain, cruel, and manipulative in such an over the top way that you can’t help but find her fun to watch. The way she basically tries to coerce Barbie to do what she wants while still seemingly come across as friendly makes her quite evil in a way that works. Where I’m more mixed is with Prince Johan. He’s initially introduced as an awkward, but charming person who wants to marry Amelia for her love. He actually wants to take Floravia for himself so that he can be the sole ruler. On paper, I think the idea behind him is pretty interesting, and he’s at least fun to watch. Where I think he falls short is with screentime. He’s introduced at the 28 minute mark, and it takes another 20 minutes for him to be seen as an antagonist. There isn’t really much to hint at him being an antagonist outside of his bodyguard Reggie (voiced by Ben Pronsky) occasionally acting suspicious. I feel he should’ve taken cues from Vic Pearlman from the 4 part special “Magical Mermaid Mystery”. Even though we don’t find out about his true motivations until the end of part 3, he’s still a very consistent presence given how he acts like a jerk to Barbie and her friends the moment he’s introduced. Maybe if Prince Johan had more moments of him acting a bit off, I could probably buy it.\n\nNow let’s talk about the ending, for which there’s plenty to go over. There’s of course exciting action with how Barbie and Amelia get help from Teresa and Nikki during a high speed boat chase as Renee, Daisy, and Ken try to hold down the fort. More than that though, seeing Amelia show regret for how she got everyone into trouble helps show how she may make mistakes, but also shows enough empathy for others to at least try and do the right thing. Barbie also gets a moment to shine with how she tells Rose Ross off for editing her video without permission, and rejects her offer to be part of her show. Seeing her be able to do this on her own helps show how she’s grown and can make her own decisions while still knowing when to rely on others. We then get a really good moment from Amelia during her coronation as she talks about how Barbie helped inspired her to be her true self. She then later tells Alfonso how she wants to do her own vlog and show off her true self to the world, which he shows support for. Oh, and Rose Ross ends up going into a trap door when she sees how everyone likes Barbie and Amelia more. Talk about satisfying.\n\nAnd that’s my review of Barbie: Princess Adventure. While it has issues that hold it back, I can’t help, but find it an underrated gem. It carries much of the heart that I love from Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures. Of course, since that show isn’t for everyone, I’d recommend this movie more if you’re a fan of the show.\n\nDiscuss this review on the Toonzone Forums!"
