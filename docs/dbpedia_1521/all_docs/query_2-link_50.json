        "text": "On 31 August, the world marked 26 years since the death of Princess Diana. The former wife of Prince Charles (now King Charles III) and mother of Prince William and Prince Harry, Diana remains a much-missed family member and a symbol of kindness and compassion to millions of well-wishers around the world.\n\nVivacious, intelligent and exceedingly beautiful, Princess Diana was never short of admirers. She was iridescent – always fabulously turned out and with a sparkling sense of humour to accompany. As depicted in The Crown, so much of Diana’s youthful appeal and suitability for her role as Princess of Wales (and entry into the Royal Family) was the absence of scandal and rubbished relationships in her wake. It’s widely thought that the then Prince of Wales was her first official boyfriend – and it's not hugely surprising given Diana was 19 at the time that their engagement was announced."
