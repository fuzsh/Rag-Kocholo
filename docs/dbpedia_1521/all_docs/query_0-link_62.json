        "text": "Nessa Barrett is riding for Love Island USA‘s Rob Rausch in her sultry new music video for her latest single, “Passenger Princess.”\n\nIn the Aerin Moreno-directed clip, the social media star-turned-artist is seen rocking a pink wig, a leather bralette and mini skirt as she sings in the passenger seat of a convertible, with Rausch in the driver’s seat. “I’m your shotgun/ Baby, for the long run/ Don’t you know, I’d die for you?/ I ride for you,” she muses in the chorus, amid make out sessions with the reality TV star.\n\nRausch made waves during season six of Love Island USA, capturing the audience’s attention due to his love triangle with Leah Kateb and Andrea Carmora.\n\nMeanwhile, it’s been two years since Barrett dropped her debut project, Young Forever, which featured fan-favorite hits like “Tired of California” and “Die First.” Since then, she released her 2023 Hell Is a Teenage Girl EP in 2023 and has toured globally.\n\n“Everyone online isn’t fully the person that they are on social media. So when people start to branch out and do new things or follow a dream of theirs, it’s kind of confusing for people and it’s hard for them to accept,” the 21-year-old musician previously told Billboard of people who go from having large social media platforms to taking the jump into music. “Just because you have an audience and a big platform, it doesn’t mean you don’t grow and change like anyone else. That’s part of life.”\n\n“Passenger Princess” marks the lead single of Barrett’s upcoming sophomore album, Aftercare."
