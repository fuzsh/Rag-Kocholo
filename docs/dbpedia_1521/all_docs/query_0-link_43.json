        "text": "With the MedallionClass® experience, we’ve made the service guests love even better. It goes beyond knowing your name. It’s surprising you on your birthday. Knowing you take cinnamon in your latte and bringing you that latte anywhere. It’s addressing any concerns right now, not later, maybe even before you ask. Anyone can say their crew is like family. So we don’t say it; our guests do.\n\nA cruise with Princess isn’t just a chance to connect with your favorite people and the world. It’s one of the best vacation values around. Exploring multiple destinations yet only unpacking once. Multicourse meals to remember. Broadway-style shows, comedy acts and bands. A comfortable stateroom perfect for unwinding. And the best part? You get it all for a fraction of what you'd spend on a land-based vacation.\n\nOur people love travel (and people!) so they’re always happy to share the best places to go in the 330 destinations we visit. And our tour operator partners live in, work in and know these ports better than anyone else. But exploration isn’t something you only enjoy ashore. We bring regional experiences, like cuisine and entertainment, on board so you can dive into local life while you sail.\n\nDine on fresh regional cuisine that gives you a better appreciation of the places you visit. Savor sauces made from scratch, breads baked fresh 24-7 and homemade ice cream created every day. Food is a big part of the travel experience, and we want each meal to be a celebration of your vacation."
