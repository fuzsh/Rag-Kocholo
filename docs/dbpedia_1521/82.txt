Ever since I saw the trailer of Half a Fairy Tale, the music and the feeling reminded me of Romantic Princess. I know the drama did not start yet, but i already can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!

Its got the basic storyline of girl finds herself suddenly rich after being poor. Nothing is like what she expects it to be and she finds herself in some pretty interesting situations.

This drama is similar in ways where we have a rich heiress who's beautiful and strong. Then you also have the hot male protagonist that obviously ends up being the prince. It's cliché, funny and sweet too.
