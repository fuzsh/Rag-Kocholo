        "text": "January 2005\n\nThe idea was to record stories of people aged from one to 100 about an aspect of their family history, and build up a snapshot of family history in South Yorkshire.\n\nYou can listen to some of the one-minute stories by clicking on the links on the right of the page.\n\nEmma Cassinelli is ten. She knows that her great-great-great-great-grandfather was the first person to sell ice cream in Sheffield with two shops in the town centre.\n\nCamran Munir's family comes from Kashmir. He tells us how he discovered about his family tree during a trip to Kashmir where he met an elder in the village who had memorised every family tree of each family in the village.\n\nDavid Kirk is from Barnsley. He discovered that a family story about his great-great-grandfather is a myth. David had been told by his grandparents that his great-great-grand father was a famous rich coal merchant in North Yorkshire and even had some streets in York named after him. But after tracing his family history, David soon established that he was nothing of the sort and he was in fact an ordinary worker in a mill.\n\nWhilst collecting the stories for the 100 Club we also uncovered tales of royalty...\n\nBarry Green from Darnall told us about the time when, during the visit of Edward VII The Prince of Wales to the Cutlers Feast, his father's eldest brother was Beagle to the Lord Mayor and his younger brother was the Toast Master at the Feast! Both were photographed standing behind the Prince. On the same visit Barry's mothers elder brother was a pageboy at the Grand Hotel and took the Prince up to his room.\n\nRosie Brown had no idea about her family history beyond her grandparents. She has always wondered about her background as she doesn't feel white British due to her dark complexion.\n\nIf you want to start tracing your family history a good place to start is the BBC Family History site - links are on the right of the page."
