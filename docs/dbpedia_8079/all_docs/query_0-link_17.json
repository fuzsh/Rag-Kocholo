        "text": "TCFC Legend #1\n\nBasil Steer\n\n16 June 2020\n\nBasil George Steer was born in South Milton, Near Kingsbridge, Devon on Tuesday 30th July 1929. His first club was West Alvington where he played football with his two brothers, Ray and Terry.\n\nBasil went on to play for Tavistock, St Blazey and of course Truro City. He suffered from asthma and therefore never went for any 40/60 balls to preserve himself, giving some belief that he could have given more. Basil could use both feet and his head and always seemed to be in the right place at the right time.\n\nHe was offered a trial with Everton and Arsenal but was discouraged by his wife Lois, with a concern about his asthma and it was suggested that he got a real job! Basil played for both Devon and Cornwall at both cricket and football.\n\nBasil’s goals were instrumental in helping Truro City gain honours, in his first season in 1958-1959 Truro won the Cornwall Senior Cup, a season later they won the South Western League Cup and in 1960-1961 Basil helped Truro win the South Western League title for the first time in their history by being one of only six ever presents in the City side, playing all 28 league games and scoring 44 league goals.\n\nBasil died on 16th February 2000 at Woodhall Spa Golf Club, he was 70 years old.\n\nMassive thanks to Basil’s son Phil Steer for sharing this information about a proper TCFC legend with me.\n\n🏆 South Western League – 1960-61\n\n🏆 Cornwall Senior Cup – 1958-59\n\n🏆 South Western League Cup – 1959-60\n\n❤️🖤\n\nTCFC Legend #2\n\nSteve Massey\n\n12 January 2021\n\nSteven Massey was born in Denton, Lancashire on Friday 28th March 1958.\n\nThe striker played for Stockport County, Bournemouth, Peterborough United, Northampton Town, Hull City, Cambridge United and Wrexham before joining Truro City.\n\nMassey made his debut for City on 31st August 1988 at home against Penzance, Truro won 4-3 and Mass scored all four goals! Steve was top scorer for Truro in his debut season, scoring 28 league goals.\n\nSteve went on to become Truro City’s player/manager and in 1992/1993 Truro did the double, winning both the South Western League and the South Western League Cup under Steve’s management to end a 23 year wait for a league title at Treyew Road!\n\nMassey had two more managerial spells at Truro in 2005/2006 and 2013/2014.\n\nSteve is currently the manager of South West Peninsula Premier Division West side Helston Athletic.\n\nCheers Mass you absolute TCFC legend!\n\n🏆 South Western League – 1992-93\n\n🏆 South Western League Cup – 1992-93\n\nSee also number 2 on ‘Matty meets…’\n\nSee also number 26 on ‘Players of Yesteryear’\n\n❤️🖤\n\nTCFC Legend #3\n\nNeil Imrie\n\n29 April 2021\n\nNeil “Jock” Imrie was born on Sunday 25th April 1937 in Dundee, Scotland where he still lives with his wife Hazel.\n\nNeil was in the Royal Navy and played for several teams in Plymouth whilst he was in the Navy and after he finished his service, before moving to Falmouth Town for a short spell before being approached by Truro City.\n\n“Jock’s” goals helped City win honours during his time with the club.\n\nIn the five seasons (over three spells with the club) “Jock” was at Truro City, he was Truro’s top scorer in the league in his first four seasons and amassed over 170 goals in total!\n\nHis third spell with the club was in 1972-1973 season as player/manager.\n\nEdit – Neil sadly passed away on 9th January 2022 at the age of 84.

Tom can even remember the scouts name… Jack Wade.\n\nTom’s biggest influence in football is his granddad Dennis Smith, who played for Middlesbrough and Tom joked “The football genes skipped a generation, thank God!”\n\nSmudge’s previous clubs were Sheffield Wednesday, Sheffield United, Rotherham United, Northampton Town and Hereford United before joining Truro City in 2005 when Steve Massey poached Tom from Tiverton Town, who Tom had asked to go and train with as his parents live in Devon and Tom hadn’t even heard of Truro City until Steve Massey approached him after he scored in a pre season friendly, where Tiverton played Smudge at left-wing!\n\nTom’s proudest moment was being captain of the 2007 FA Vase winning side at Wembley, a moment he will always cherish.\n\nTom would like to thank Steve Massey for bringing him to Cornwall, “My life would be very different if I was still up country. Something I’ll always be grateful for.”\n\n🏆 FA Vase – 2006-07\n\n🏆 Southern League Division One South & West – 2008-09\n\n🏆 Western League Premier – 2007-08\n\n🏆 Western League Division One – 2006-07\n\n🏆🏆🏆 Cornwall Senior Cup – 2005-06, 2006-07, 2007-08\n\nSee also number 18 on ‘Players of Yesteryear’\n\n❤️🖤\n\nTCFC Legend #6\n\nChris Webb\n\n27 February 2023\n\nChristopher Webb was born on Wednesday 21st August 1963 in Truro, Cornwall.\n\nChris started playing football very young, at the age of 7 years old he was playing for Trelander Rovers which his dad ran as manager, Webby played all the way through until the age of 12 with his brothers Tony and David. There were players in that team like Mark Symons, Grant Champion and Stephen Caruana – the latter two went on to play the funny shaped ball of rugby.\n\nWebby says his dad was the one who encouraged him to start playing football and after Trelander Rovers he played for an old Truro City player, Harold Richards who managed Chris up until the age of 16 for Truro Minors before Webby started playing for the Truro City first team, where he was trying to mark the likes of Newquay player David Street, which didn’t work out too well for Chris, as in his own words “What a great player he was, I don’t think anyone could mark him!”\n\nWebby capped off a memorable season in 1992-1993 when he came off the bench in the South Western League Cup final at Porthleven and scored a goal against Falmouth Town in time added on, as City easily won the tie 4-1 and picked up the first trophy in a remarkable double winning season!\n\nAfter retiring from football Chris went on to become Truro’s manager, director and vice chairman.\n\nWebby regards the 2007 FA Vase final as the best day of his footballing career.\n\n🏆🏆 South Western League – 1992-93, 1995-96\n\n🏆 Cornwall Senior Cup – 1994-95\n\n🏆 South Western League Cup – 1992-93\n\nSee also number 1 on ‘Players of Yesteryear’\n\n❤️🖤\n\nTCFC Legend #7\n\nKevin Wills\n\n27 March 2023\n\nOn Wednesday 15th October 1980 Kevin Michael Wills was born in Torbay, Devon, England.\n\nKevin Wills got into football from an early age while watching his dad play for their local side Stoke Gabriel. Any spare time that Kevin had, he was kicking a ball around whether it was in the garden or the local park!\n\nWhilst Kevin was playing for Tiverton Town, another future City legend, Stewart Yetton joined Truro from Tivvy and City then came in for Willsy and a fee was agreed so he spoke to Kevin Heaney (chairman) and Steve Massey (manager) and joined shortly after.
