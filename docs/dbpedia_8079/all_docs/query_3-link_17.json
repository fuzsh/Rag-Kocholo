        "text": "Kenny Gene Hill was born in Osage City, Kansas, April 15, 1961, to Larry Lee Hill and Ina Louise Gookins Hill. Kenny attended grade school in Winona, Kansas, and graduated high school in Oakley, Kansas.\n\nKen lived a life full of adventure and fun. Ken loved horses, and in 1977 he was the Kansas State High School steer wrestling champion. Ken enjoyed running mud trucks and 4-wheelers, but his passion was hunting coyotes. Ken knew where the coyotes were and how to catch them. He and his wife, Connie, raised coyote dogs (K7C Coyote Dogs).\n\nKen was a welder for 40 years, and there was nothing that he could not weld. He and Connie owned and operated their own welding business. Ken and Connie were married in Quinter, Kansas, June 27, 2007.\n\nKenny passed away December 2, 2023, in Denver following a very brief illness.\n\nKenny is survived by his wife, Connie Hill of Eads. He is also survived by his children from previous marriages, Keven Dunford of Topeka, Kansas, Casey Weyer of Centralla, Kansas, Ashley Coffey of Cruses, New Mexico, Karissa Newby of Garden City, Kansas, and Karinda Hill of Pueblo; Connieâ€™s son, Timothy Ehrlich of Bunker Hill, Kansas; mother, Ina Hill of Seibert; 12 grandchildren; two great grandchildren; two sisters; four brothers; and numerous other family and friends.\n\nKen was preceded in death by his father, Larry Hill, and his brother, Jerry Hill.\n\nKenny's life will be celebrated January 6, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. at the Kiowa County Community Building in Eads.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to the Ken Hill Memorial Fund in care of GN Bank, P.O. Box 847, Eads, CO 81036.\n\nArrangements are under the direction of Brown Funeral Home."
