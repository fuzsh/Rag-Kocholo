        "text": "Charles Mack Luke, 87, of Tooele, Utah, passed away Feb. 9, 2024. Mack was born April 26, 1936, in Orangeville, Utah, to Delphia Brittana Allridge and Elden Glen Luke.\n\nAs a youth, Mack loved living life’s adventures in the charming metropolis of Orangeville and the surrounding areas. Sometimes his work turned into adventures of a lifetime like herding cattle at the top of Skyline and racing horses at the annual end of summer picnic. Mack attended South Emery High School and participated in many activities including the FFA, raising a steer as part of the program.\n\nIt was during his high school adventures that Mack met the love of his life, Eunice Lewis, whom he married in 1954 in the Manti Temple. They worked very hard raising their family. Mack attended Carbon College (USU Eastern) in Price where he received a degree in mathematics. During this time Mack also joined the Utah Army National Guard. Some highlights of his professional life include driving trucks delivering coal, wildcatting with Shell Oil, helping develop rocket propellent at Thiokol, and as an independent insurance agent with Farmers Insurance. As a result, they lived in various places in Utah including Orangeville, Price, Brigham City, and Tooele.\n\nMack was very committed to serving God and his community. For several years Mack served the Tooele community as an emergency medical technician responding to emergencies at all hours of the day for the local ambulance service. As a member of the LDS Church, Mack was called to serve as a ward clerk, bishop’s counselor, Bishop, and Elders Quorum President. Mack and Eunice loved to travel and were able to combine their love of travel with service on LDS missions in Palmyra, New York, with a stopover in Nauvoo, Illinois, and the Cove Fort Historic Site, Utah. Additionally they served local service missions with the Salt Lake City Temple and as MLS Missionaries in Tooele.\n\nAdditionally, Mack served as a scoutmaster, district committee chair, and a coordinator of the Scout Wigwam for the Boy Scouts of America. He was the recipient of the District Award of Merit and the Silver Beaver for his commitment and service in the Boy Scouts of America scouting program.\n\nMack enjoyed the outdoors and passed the love of fishing, hunting and nature in general to his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Each one of us remembers the joy of those camping trips, especially near Joe’s Valley and the family cabin.\n\nMack seemed to know people wherever he went. It was not unusual for him to be traveling anywhere in the country only to run into one of his longtime friends and say one of his many Mack-isms such as “Anything you need? – How about a stack of $100 bills this high” or “How much do I owe you? – About a buck three eighty” or “I’m pretty good, more pretty than good.”\n\nMack was preceded in death by his parents Elden and Delphia Luke, George and Phyllis Lewis, his brothers Kean and Earl Luke, his sister Elda (Luke) and her husband Delile Hinkins, brothers-in-law Norris and Donald Lewis, and his beloved granddaughter Kenna (Luke) Goodman. He is survived by his wife Eunice (Lewis) Luke; his children Kenneth (Crystal) Luke, Shanna (Scott) Leech, Gary (Kathy) Luke, Gayle (Ranse) Parker, and Glen (April) Luke; and in-laws Ilene (Earl) Luke, and Charlane (Kean) Luke, Kimball (Myrna) Lewis, Ted Lewis; 10 grandchildren and 20 great-grandchildren.\n\nA funeral service will be held at 11 a.m., Friday, Feb. 16, 2024, at the LDS 17th Ward House, 132 N. 570 East, Tooele, Utah. A viewing will be held one hour prior at 10 a.m. Interment will be at the Stansbury Park Cemetery.\n\nThe family would like to express a special thanks to Intermountain Hospice for the care provided through this difficult time; specific thanks to Colin, Karlie and Jody. In lieu of flowers please donate to the LDS Missionary Fund, Alzheimer’s Association, American Cancer Society or a charity of your choice.\n\nLive-streaming will be available on the day of funeral service."
