        "text": "Read about our Bum Steer of the Year, Austin, and the four runners-up: Louie Gohmert, Herschel Walker, Gilberto Hinojosa, and Floperation Lone Star. Also, check out our Best Things in Texas list for examples of some of this year’s uplifting moments.\n\nThe Bum Steers Committee was busier this year than a security guard at a school board meeting. We updated our official position on Dak Prescott. (No longer extremely disappointing!) We passed nonbinding resolutions. (Before starting your vehicle, always check to make sure your trailer isn’t on fire.) And of course, we deliberated, argued about, and voted for the Bum Steer of the Year. After every ballot was counted and recounted, it wasn’t a politician who won. It wasn’t even a human being. It was . . . well, see for yourself. But bring a shovel, because there’s a whole heap of misdeeds and miscreants to get through first.\n\nBum Steer of the Year\n\nKeep Austin Steer’d!\n\nHow a funky little college town became the unbearable-traffic, unaffordable-real-estate, insufferable-tech-bro, inanely-precious-restaurant, expensive-BBQ capital of the world! Read more.\n\nRunners-Up\n\nFloperation Lone Star\n\nGreg Abbott’s $4 billion program to deter migration . . . doesn’t seem to be deterring migration. Read more.\n\nGilberto Hinojosa\n\nTexas Monthly recently acquired the (fake!) résumé of one Gilberto Hinojosa, the seemingly indefatigable chair of the long-suffering Texas Democratic party. We print it here in full. Read more.\n\nLouie Gohmert\n\nAn open letter to Louie Gohmert, the Bum Steer Hall of Fame’s newest inductee! Read more.\n\nHerschel Walker\n\n(Fake!) excerpts from the campaign diary of a displaced Texan, summer–fall 2022. Read more.\n\n(Dis)honorable Mentions / The Rest of the Herd\n\nAt least they weren’t conspiracy theorists dressed up as Southeast Texas congressmen\n\nRepublican congressman Troy Nehls, who represents a district southwest of Houston, asserted that a group that visited his Capitol Hill office was made up of undercover “special agents dressed like construction workers” who were engaged in a “deep state” plot to destroy him. The Capitol Police chief said the visitors were, in fact, uniformed officers who closed and locked Nehls’s office after it was left open.\n\n“Live! Live, you magnificent creature! . . . Actually, you know what might be fun?”\n\nA marine-mammal rescue group said a dolphin stranded on a Brazoria County beach died before its members could reach it in part because beachgoers pushed the stressed animal out to sea and then attempted to ride it.\n\n“Why, yes, officer, I was raised in a barn. Why do you ask?”\n\nAnimal welfare investigators rescued some thirty animals from a home in Hitchcock, including two horses, two pythons, and, on the second floor, a calf.\n\nBecause you can’t spell “campaign crisis” without “ISIS”\n\nTwo-term congressman Van Taylor (R-Plano) abruptly dropped his bid for reelection when it was revealed that he’d had an adulterous affair with a woman who was once a committed jihadist and had traveled to Syria in hopes of joining ISIS. “About a year ago, I made a horrible mistake,” Taylor wrote in an email to supporters.\n\nWell, when you put it that way . . .\n\nWhen Travis County customers of an electric cooperative complained about a blackout caused by fires, a co-op spokesperson explained, “We are looking at the commonalities of each one of these fires finding out what is the weather condition and then what is the equipment that is on the pole that is where the pole-top fire is occurring.”\n\nMay he rest in peace for 10 minutes before serving\n\nThe grill company Weber issued an apology for emailing customers a meat loaf recipe that coincided with the announcement that Dallas-born singer Meat Loaf had died: “At the time we shared this recipe with you, we were not aware of the unfortunate passing of American singer and actor Mr. Marvin Lee Aday, also known as Meat Loaf. We want to express our deepest apologies for this oversight and for any offense this email may have caused.”\n\nHe was right the first time about being wrong the last time\n\nIn a speech in Dallas, former president George W. Bush decried “the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq,” then quickly corrected himself: “I mean of Ukraine.”\n\nHypothesis: covering students in flammable gel and lighting them on fire will have a suboptimal effect on a middle school teaching career\n\nA Granbury Middle School science teacher resigned after conducting an experiment in which he covered a twelve-year-old student’s hands in sanitizer and then lit them on fire, resulting in severe burns. Police said the demonstration had been done “multiple times throughout the day with other students without incident.”\n\nAnd the overwrought expressionism of the Hellenistic era really gets him steamed. But mainly his girlfriend.\n\nA 21-year-old Dallas man was arrested for breaking into the Dallas Museum of Art and smashing multiple works, including a Greek amphora dating from the sixth century BC, causing damages estimated in the millions of dollars. The man told authorities he went on the rampage because he was mad at his girlfriend.\n\n“Our motto: With honor and integrity, we will safeguard the American people, our homeland, and our values. And PARRRRTAAYYYY!!!”\n\nHomeland Security agent William Bernard McCarthy Jr., who was carrying a loaded weapon, was arrested for driving with a blood alcohol level at twice the legal limit, after he collided with another law-enforcement vehicle while heading to a raid in McAllen.\n\nDid you hear the one about the Aggie?\n\nKyle Rittenhouse, a teenager who fatally shot two demonstrators during protests in Wisconsin in 2020, announced on a podcast that he would attend Texas A&M University and made a point of putting on an Aggie cap. “I’m going to be going there, and it’s going to be awesome,” he said. “Beautiful campus, amazing people, amazing food.” He later admitted that he had only applied to attend a community college in nearby Brenham.\n\nIf we understood what cryptocurrency is, we’d probably be furious about this\n\nGalveston public school officials discovered that an employee had installed devices on the district’s network that were intended to hijack its computing power and electricity to mine cryptocurrency.\n\n“Take me out of the ball game / Take me out of the league / Ban me from coaching and don’t cut me slack / It seems pretty clear that I’ve gotten the sack / See, I’m in the tank for my kids’ team / If they don’t win I’ll bring shame / ‘Cause it’s shove, smack, I’ll never come back / To the old ball game.”\n\nHarris County sergeant Kenneth Wendt was dismissed as head coach of an age-nine-and-under baseball team after he shoved and aggressively high-fived players of the opposing team following his team’s loss. “I got hit right in the head,” said one child.\n\nBut if you’re comfortable sitting in the dark while Robert Pattinson mumbles and squints for three hours, you’re in the right place\n\nA screening of The Batman at an Austin movie theater was temporarily halted when a filmgoer released a live bat as a prank. An employee told customers, “If you are uncomfortable being in the dark with a bat, please remove yourself now.”\n\nAnd the rockets’ red . . . AAAARRGGHH!!!\n\nFort Worth’s official Fourth of July fireworks show was abruptly canceled soon after it began when the pyrotechnics ignited a grass fire on the banks of the Trinity River.\n\nGross, no matter how you slice it\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommended a $1 million fine for the Fiesta Mart grocery chain after an investigation revealed a pattern of accidental fingertip amputations among its butchers.\n\n“U up? Wanna speak in tongues?”\n\nPastor Matt Chandler of Flower Mound’s Village Church was forced to take a leave of absence when it was revealed that the married clergyman had carried on a texting relationship with a woman who was not his wife—though church elders said the messages were not romantic or sexual.\n\nSeems like harsh punishment for a guy who accidentally ordered one hundred and three sides of chuck wagon cheese fries to go with his cattleman’s prime rib\n\nCPS Energy chief operating officer Fred Bonewell resigned from San Antonio’s city-owned utility company after a local TV news investigation revealed his expense account abuses, which included $729 for an airport limousine and $683 for one meal at Saltgrass Steak House.\n\n“He wasn’t throwing where he was supposed to on game day, either, but we’ll handle that internally”\n\nAfter quarterback Quinn Ewers’s car was towed during his first game as a University of Texas Longhorn, he wrote on Twitter, “How’d I get towed during the game?” When asked about the incident, coach Steve Sarkisian said, “He wasn’t where he was supposed to be parking on game day.”\n\nPolice proceeded to find them, flank them, strip-search them, and chuck them into a cell\n\nTwo women evaded store employees and walked out of an H-E-B in Temple with over $2,000 worth of meat they didn’t pay for.\n\n¿Cómo se dice “pointless”?\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott reached a deal with four Mexican governors to end increased inspections of commercial vehicles entering Texas, after a week of traffic gridlock that caused major trucking delays. Abbott called the deal historic, while three of his Mexican counterparts said they would simply resume the security protocols they had in place before the increased inspections.\n\n“This is your pilot speaking. Folks, we’ve just slammed down in Santa Ana, where the local weather is . . .”\n\nA Southwest Airlines plane hit a runway at Southern California’s John Wayne Airport with such force that a flight attendant fractured a vertebra.\n\nMaybe he thought passengers missed the free nutz\n\nA Texas resident was apprehended by law enforcement following a Southwest Airlines flight during which he used Apple’s AirDrop file-sharing feature to disseminate a photo of his genitals to fellow passengers. “Just having a little fun,” he later explained.\n\n“Well, folks, we’ve encountered more unexpected perv-ulence”\n\nYet another male passenger on a Southwest flight, this time from Houston to Cabo San Lucas, used Apple’s file-sharing service to send a nude photo to unwitting passengers.\n\nBut the scariest thing to happen on a Southwest flight was . . .\n\nThe airline teamed up with Guitar Center to surprise a flight full of Honolulu-bound passengers with free ukuleles and a group lesson.\n\nAnd then they went back to their hoses\n\nAfter the City of Dallas gave employees goody bags of health-related products to promote a wellness initiative, a number of firefighters complained that one item, a mini massager, resembled a sex toy.\n\nThe worst part: she was only giving out little boxes of raisins\n\nA Buda woman was charged with second-degree felony aggravated assault after she allegedly pointed a loaded handgun at a trick-or-treater who was walking in front of her home on Halloween.\n\n“See, your problem is, you wanna go with indirect heat”\n\nHarris County Constable deputies, responding to a report of a pickup truck on fire, charged a man with driving while intoxicated and possessing cocaine, after they found him towing a burning barbecue pit.\n\nHe was slapped with an assault charge and later in-deet-ed but ended up getting off™\n\nA Dallas man was arrested and charged with assault for beating his roommate over the head with a broomstick during an argument over “what a mosquito looks like.”\n\nEditors clarified that it was not a misprint but a service for people fleeing north to escape the city’s high cost of living\n\nIn January the Austin American-Statesman published the weather forecast for Oklahoma City, complete with a large map of Oklahoma and a headline that read “What’s Ahead for Oklahoma City.”\n\n“I’m missing that old jet plane / Don’t know when I’ll get to board again / Babe, I hate the TSA”\n\nIn early spring, chronic understaffing by the TSA at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport was blamed for severe check-in delays that saw passengers queuing outdoors for hours, causing hundreds to miss their flights.\n\nThe fire hydrants in the boys’ bathroom, though, are real\n\nMichelle Evans, the failed Republican candidate for Texas House District 136, alleged in a tweet that Round Rock ISD officials had lowered cafeteria tables to allow middle and high school students who identify as “furries” to “more easily eat without utensils or their hands (i.e., like a dog eats from a bowl).” Evans offered no evidence, and a school district official said this never happened.\n\nNot alright, not alright, not alright\n\nIn its November issue, Esquire published a moving essay by Uvalde native Matthew McConaughey on how the community and the nation can heal after the Robb Elementary School shooting in May, pairing the story with fashion photos of the actor/activist dressed in Ralph Lauren and Saint Laurent, including a cover shot of him wading in water and wearing a white Armani suit.\n\nAlso not alright\n\nThe Esquire story placed the Hill Country town of Uvalde in “West Texas.”\n\nSigned: Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States\n\nTrump Burger, a Donald Trump–themed restaurant, opened in Bellville, serving burgers with “TRUMP” branded onto the bun. According to one Yelp review, “You go there the first time because they’re Trump fanboys, and you are too. You will return because it’s a damned good burger.”\n\nAnd then broke into a rousing chorus of “We are Siamese if you please, we are Siamese if you don’t please.”\n\nFor a performance at Walt Disney World, the Port Neches–Groves High School drill team, the Indianettes, made mock war whoops and chanted “Scalp ’em!” The performance “did not reflect our core values, and we regret it took place,” Disney spokesperson Jacquee Wahler later said.\n\nAdd 7,000 yards of sheet cake and you’ve got yourself a potluck\n\nTwo women in Brownsville were charged with fraud for allegedly buying groceries with illegally purchased food stamp credits and then reselling them in Mexico. According to the U.S. Attorney’s office, one woman bought 49.1 tons of American cheese slices, 22.3 tons of pinto beans, 1.4 tons of instant mashed potatoes, more than five thousand gallons of mayonnaise, and 1.6 tons of Folger’s coffee.\n\nOh, so you mean hypocritical race theory\n\nDuring Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing, Texas senator Ted Cruz accused her of supporting critical race theory because she served on the board of her children’s private school, which espouses a policy of diversity and inclusion. Critics pointed out that Cruz sends his children to Houston’s St. John’s School, which has a nearly identical policy.\n\nAnd then, of course, there’s critical-of-your-race theory\n\nA white middle school teacher in Pflugerville was fired after he was caught on video telling a Black student, “Deep down in my heart, I’m ethnocentric, which means I think my race is the superior one.”\n\nHis search terms? T-E-D C-R-U-Z N-O-T A-S R-E-P-E-L-L-E-N-T A-S U-S-U-A-L\n\nImmediately after grandstanding his way through his questioning of Jackson, Cruz was photographed checking his Twitter account, presumably to see how well his performance played.\n\n“And I think it’s gonna be a long, long time / Till I can plead this down to a fine / I’m not the man who would burn down a home / Oh, no no no”\n\nIn other flaming-trailer news, in Kaufman County, southeast of Dallas, a man pulling a burning utility trailer behind his pickup “left a path of destruction,” causing twelve homes to be evacuated and sparking grass fires that torched seven acres before he was finally arrested. News and social media accounts dubbed the driver Rocket Man.\n\n“And cauliflower. No cauliflower.”\n\nAsked by a podcast host what he’d want for his last dinner, former White House physician and current Texas congressman Ronny Jackson replied, “It won’t be dog penis. I ate a whole plate of dog penis one time.
