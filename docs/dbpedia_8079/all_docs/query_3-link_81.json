        "text": "Onalee Gay Delaney always made time for friends and family. Her kindness and loving warmth were just a few of her very special qualities. Her personality shone like the sun - warm and compassionate for those around her. She made everyone feel special and left her mark on all those with whom she came in contact\n\nThe 1940s were a very important decade in this country. The epic battles of WWII were fresh in the memories of millions as people began to rebuild their lives and move on. It was the era of the big bands and the birth of television, before anyone had heard of rock and roll. It was during these engaging times, on July 18, 1941 that Onalee Gay was born in Lansing, Michigan to Leon and Elsie Marian Lynn. Growing up in Lansing, she attended Pattengale School. At age 14, Onalee met her future husband, Charles \"Chuck\" Ralph Delaney, who was renting an apartment from her parents. It was not love at first sight for Onalee, and during the occasion of their first meeting she took the opportunity to pour a chocolate malt over his head. Chuck was a little older than Onalee and though she didn't have a lot of companions, he saw something very special in her and they quickly became friends. They truly enjoyed each other's company and often went roller-skating or dancing. Their friendship soon blossomed into a wonderful young love. Chuck enlisted in the Army and after returning from basic training, asked his one and only Onalee to be his wife. They married quietly on November 19, 1957, at the home of the local minister with Onalee’s brother, Kenneth, and his wife, Marilyn, as their witnesses. Onalee was deeply in love with Chuck and often remarked that the greatest day of her life was the day they married.\n\nChuck returned to the Army after the wedding and when he was transferred to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, he sent for his Onalee. They lived in a small trailer just off the base and one of their favorite memories was of their first Christmas together. They celebrated with another couple from the Army and because of their meager wages, ingeniously molded a turkey out of hamburger. Along with a dish of baked beans, this was their first Christmas dinner, celebrated around a tree fashioned from leftover evergreen trimmings. As long as they had each other, they believed they had everything. They were further blessed in their marriage with three children, Kimberly, Loretta and Charles, each a source of much delight.\n\nOnalee was truly a woman of many talents and full of character. She was fun loving and was always eager to share her sense of humor by pulling practical jokes. Those Onalee met usually walked away with a smile because of her loving humor and kind heart. She took great pride in her children and was an attentive mother, taking an active role in every phase of their lives. Her children will remember her as a very loving “Mom”, making them clothes for school, helping them get into trouble with their dad by fixing things that only he could repair later, and how she enjoyed being the Mascot \"Mom\" of the Bitely Bad Boys Motorcycle Club.\n\nDevoted to her husband, Onalee was very supportive of Chuck and whatever employment he undertook, she encouraged him and often was by his side to help him succeed. They lived many years in the Lansing and Carson City area while Chuck was working at Oldsmobile. After his early retirement, they worked many ventures together. As a family, they operated a produce route around the Carson City area. Chuck took to clowning around at the Crystal Raceway as a clown. Onalee was the one who made sure his big red nose was on straight. When Chuck felt the need for speed and started racing stock cars at the track, Onalee was his pit crew and crew chief. She could do just about anything to make sure the car was in tip-top shape. She would often give Chuck suggestions to make the car perform better during a race, and when he did not take her advice it often backfired on him. At one time, Chuck was an auctioneer with Onalee as his clerk. When he performed as a magician, she was his assistant, setting up the act. Chuck made goods to sell at flea markets and Onalee was his salesperson. Chuck and Onalee also worked together operating a karaoke entertainment service. While in the Carson City area, they started the \"Troubleshooters Emergency Response Team.\" They worked through the Sheriff's Department and assisted with many needs, working crowd control, search and rescue, surveillance, and transport, helping to free up officers for more critical needs.\n\nEventually, the Delaney family moved to the Fountain area where they purchased a mobile home that had been damaged by a tree in a storm. Once again working side by side, they repaired it, adding rooms for their children and making it their home. Onalee also worked outside the home at Stokely Cannery in Scottville as well as in the “Boatique” of the Lake Michigan Car Ferries \"S. S. Badger.\" Of course, along side her was her loving husband. Chuck and Onalee shared everything in their lives, day in and day out. Many times comments came their way about too much togetherness, but to Chuck and Onalee, being together and sharing every moment of life was what made theirs a happy marriage.\n\nChuck and Onalee filled a room with their presence and left a lasting impression on everyone they met. Friends and family cherished their relationship. During Onalee’s illness, the nurses at Hackely Hospital came to adore both Chuck and Onalee and on the occasion of their 46th anniversary, made a special cake for their precious friends. Onalee had very special memories of the captain of the S.S. Badger calling her up to the bridge of the car ferry to steer the ship for a little way across lake Michigan in honor of her birthday. Onalee had a soft spot for animals and loved to be involved in caring for them. Her favorite eatery was Bortell’s Fishery in Pentwater. She hated fishing herself, but she loved to eat there.\n\nAfter living a life filled with joy and having celebrated each moment given to her, Onalee Gay Delaney passed away on Saturday, November 22, 2003. She was preceded in death by her parents, her brother, Kenneth Lynn, and two infant children who died at birth. She will be lovingly remembered by her husband, Charles, her children: Kimberly Louise (Keith) Voss of Fountain, Loretta Lucille McGinn of Killeen, Texas, and Charles R. (Connie) Delaney II of Walhalla, thirteen grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, her mother-in-law, Marjorie L. Sloan, of St. Charles, her brothers-in-law, Frances (Sandy) Sloan, of Chesaning, Marty (Robin) Sloan of Williamston, and Fred Sloan of Jackson, her sister-in-law, Alice (Joe) Wilcox, of Perryington, and many nieces and nephews.\n\nA Celebration of Life service will be held on Wednesday, November 26 at 11:00 AM at the Stephens Funeral Chapel in Scottville. Burial will follow at Bachelor Cemetery in Fountain. Family and friends will gather for a time of visitation on Tuesday from 2-4 and 7-9 PM at the funeral chapel.
