        "text": "In 1984 the West Point Hall of Fame was started by the Kiwanis Club, the Daily Times Leader, and the Clay County Economic Development Corporation. The purpose of this program is to honor citizens of the community that have brought honor to the city by their achievements, their dedication, and their service, or they have been recognized by the community for their lifetime achievements. Spanky Bruce, editor of the Daily Times Leader, was the initial leader of this effort and set up a committee to nominate the honorees. A banquet was held each year where a large plaque was presented to honor the recipients. These plaques hang in the City Hall auditorium. This successful program was halted suddenly at the untimely death of Mr. Bruce in 1993. There was no Hall of Fame nominations or banquet that year. The next year the program was taken over by the Clay County Economic Development Corporation and the Peoples Bank and Trust Company, and continues to be a very successful program. In recent years the Hall of Fame awards have been presented at the annual banquet of the CCEDC, now the West Point/Clay County Community Growth Alliance.\n\nThe Hall of Fame is the highest honor a person can receive in the City of West Point.\n\n2019\n\nCaroline and Robert Harrell\n\nNaomi Kilgore\n\n2018\n\nThomas Barrett Storey Jr.\n\nAnna V.
