        "text": "Highly sustainable development the first instruction to be received by Glencar from Trebor and is situated in the heart of Crewe’s well established commercial area. Glencar, a leading UK construction company known for its innovative and sustainable approach and who was recently ranked amongst Europe’s fastest growing businesses, has today announced that is has been appointed for the first time by award winning commercial property developer and Industrial and Logistics specialist Trebor Developments to construct Crewe 335, a new highly efficient and sustainable distribution unit comprising 335,000 sq. ft at a site situated in the heart of Crewe’s established commercial area. This development represents a significant investment in the region and is set to be become a cornerstone of Crewe’s expanding industrial and logistics sector. It will feature 15m eaves height, Grade A offices, dock and level access loading doors, yard depths up to 56m, and separate car parking, all within a self-contained and secure site. The unit has been designed to be sustainable from the start with 10% roof lights, solar panelled roof, dedicated EV charging points, cycle spaces, and staff wellbeing areas. The unit will be built to BREEAM “Excellent” standards and is targeting EPC “A”. Speaking about the contract award Pete Goodman, Glencar Managing Director Midlands & North said: “Trebor are without doubt one of the most active, leading developers in the I&L marketspace so we are naturally delighted to have been appointed by them for the first time. Our values and philosophy are very well aligned to that of Trebor in terms of our pursuit of excellence and sustainable building practices in all that we do. This development sits in key strategic location in the well-established industrial area along Weston Road (A532) and together with the high specification and array of sustainable features built in is likely to be a compelling proposition for occupiers seeking to base their operations in this area. We very much look forward to working with the full professional team on this project and delivering an outstanding outcome. Also in comment Mark Wright, Partner at Trebor said: “Having successfully completed demolition works onsite we are now excited about the next phase of work onsite and starting vertical construction in this key location for logistics and distribution. We are very pleased to be working with Glencar for the first time who come with a first class reputation and recent track record. This development offers significant potential, with strong levels of interest at this early stage and we look forward to seeing the construction phase for completion next Spring.” Building, Design & Construction Magazine | The Choice of Industry Professionals\n\nFollowing a campaign led by JCB, there is an amendment in the regulations to allow engineering plant to tow trailers under specific circumstances. Originally, engineering plant including wheeled excavators and loaders were prohibited under the Road Vehicles (Authorisation of Special Types) General Order (STGO) to the towing of trailers on UK roads. However, the case was made by JCB in that advancements in towing safety and technology, coupled with the benefits of reducing carbon, reducing costs, and increasing efficiency meant that a Ministerial decision was made by the Department for Transport that allowed a derogation to The Road Vehicles (Authorisation of Special Types) General Order 2003, so that the towing of a trailer can be permitted for the activities of road construction, maintenance, and repair. To tow trailers under this derogation requires a Vehicle Special Order (VSO) that allows wheeled earthmoving machinery (engineering plant) to tow a trailer on the UK roads to transport certain attachments and materials with the towing machine. They will be allowed to tow trailers on all types of roads, except motorways, and are limited to a maximum speed of 20mph. The towing machine must also be road-registered and comply with all relevant parts of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986. The overall length of the combined machine and trailer must not exceed 8m and the trailer must bear the same number plate as the towing machine. As they led the campaign, JCB have provided more detail on the changes restrictions and applications to this VSO concession at: https://www.jcb.com/en-gb/resources/blogs/2024/07/the-new-trailer-towing-legislation-explained?page=1 Building, Design & Construction Magazine | The Choice of Industry Professionals\n\nHS2 have just revealed stunning new timelapse footage showing engineers carefully sliding a 3,700-tonne viaduct deck almost half a kilometre uphill into position near the town of Wendover in Buckinghamshire. The deck of the Wendover Dean Viaduct – which stretches for 450m – was assembled in three stages, ranging from 90m to 180m, with each one pushed out from the north abutment before the next section was attached behind it. This painstaking, eight-month long process meant that the weight of the deck increased with each push, up from an initial 590 tonnes at the start of work in January – to 3,700 tonnes by the time it reached the south abutment on Saturday. It is one of 50 major viaducts on the HS2 project – which is designed to improve connections between London, Birmingham and the North while freeing up space on the most congested southern end of the existing West Coast Main Line. During the slide, special pads covered in Teflon – a material usually found on the surface of a non-stick frying pan – were used to minimise friction between the deck and the temporary steel bearings on top of each of the concrete piers. To help maintain control, the deck – which weighs the same as 264 double-decker buses – was pushed slightly uphill, with the finish point approximately 1.8m higher than the start point. With the steelwork now in position, engineers can begin the challenging job of lowering the deck 60cm onto the permanent bearings which will support the full weight of the structure. The two-month long operation will see the steelwork above each pier carefully lowered by 20cm at a time, pier-by pier, until the whole 450m long deck settles into its final position. HS2 Ltd’s Head of Delivery, Nicola Henderson-Reid said: “The last eight months have been incredible, and I’d like to thank everyone involved in getting us to where we are today. It’s been fascinating to watch the deck slowly inch into position, and we now look forward to the next stage of the project – lowering the deck into final position and completing the complex concrete work that will support the new railway.” Once the deck is in its final position, work can begin on the concrete that will support the railway using a specially designed travelling formwork. Moving slowly from north to south, this stage is expected to take around a year and will be followed by the installation of the parapets along the edge of the viaduct. The Wendover Dean Viaduct is the first major railway bridge in the UK to be built with a ‘double composite’ structure, which uses significantly less carbon-intensive concrete and steel than a more traditional design. Instead of using solid pre-stressed concrete beams to form the spans between the viaduct piers, the hollow ‘double composite’ structure uses two steel beams sandwiched between two layers of reinforced concrete to create a more efficient super strong span. A similar approach is also being used at Small Dean, Westbury, Lower Thorpe and Turweston, which are all at an earlier stage of construction. All five viaducts are being built by HS2 Ltd’s main works contractor, EKFB – a team made up of Eiffage, Kier, Ferrovial Construction and BAM Nuttall – with the manufacture and installation of the beams being led by specialists at Eiffage Metal. EKFB’s Senior Project Engineer, James Collings, said: “The final launch for Wendover Dean viaduct marks two years of teamwork from EKFB and our supply chain partners Eiffage Metal. I am very proud of our progress and would like to thank the team for their ongoing commitment to the safe delivery of the viaduct. Over the next three months, we will see the viaduct lowered onto its permanent bearings in preparation for its concrete deck.” The last few months has also seen significant progress at HS2’s other major viaducts, including the key structures that will form the Delta Junction in North Warwickshire and the viaducts taking the railway into Birmingham Curzon Street. In total, HS2 is building more than 500 bridging structures – ranging from small road bridges to the record-breaking Colne Valley Viaduct which will become the longest railway bridge in the UK when the deck is finished later this year.

The vast Country Park would take up more than half of this expansive site, delivering widespread social and environmental benefits. Located west of Sapley Lane, the proposed housing development would create 130 mixed-tenure new homes, providing opportunities for those looking to downsize, get onto the housing ladder, relocate, or live closer to friends and relatives. 40% will be allocated for affordable housing to be delivered by VIVID – the parent company of Bargate Homes. The 15-hectare Country Park is set to be a multifunctional public green space, which would support a range of activities, including natural play areas for young children, and seating areas for relaxing and enjoying views of Overton. New planting of native trees and shrubs is proposed, as well as the rewilding of areas to promote and enhance local biodiversity. The site will deliver a biodiversity net gain of over 109.74%. The homes are designed to be zero carbon ready, in line with the Building Regulation requirements from 2025, featuring air source heat pumps, Solar PV panels and electric vehicle charging points for each dwelling. Mark White, Managing Director of Bargate Homes, said: “We are pleased to have submitted an Outline Planning application for this site in Overton, which could become a very special new development. Located close to our now completed Seven Acres development, our proposals are designed to create a new neighbourhood and green space for the community of Overton. It will provide local residents with the opportunity to stay in the area and maintain all important friend and family networks. “The new Country Park would be a fantastic asset for the community of Overton, as it will offer ample space for physical outdoor activities, connections to nature, an uplifting meeting place for residents, as well as educational opportunities for school children.” The development site is sustainably located and has been designed in accordance with the ‘20 Minute Neighbourhood’ concept, with essential amenities all within a 20-minute walk, cycle or public transport ride. A local shop, allotments, doctor’s surgery, playing fields and primary school are all within a 20-minute walk of the site. Overton train station is a 10-minute cycle, and has frequent services running to Basingstoke, Salisbury, Exeter, and to London Waterloo in 55 minutes. The nearest bus stop is a mere four-minute walk providing services to nearby towns and villages. The site sits just south of Overton, and is equidistant between the larger towns of Basingstoke to the east, and Andover to the west. Easy access to the A303 and A34 leads to the wider motorway network.

The landlord, which owns 8,000 homes in Salford, has announced its investment programme for 2024-2025, which will see 1,366 homes undergo improvement work. A £10million eco-transformation at neighbouring tower blocks Grey Friar Court and White Friar Court in Greengate forms a key part of the investment programme, aiming to make the buildings greener and more energy efficient. Salix Homes is also installing sprinkler systems in five more of its tower blocks, meaning 14 of its 20 tower blocks will have sprinklers, with the remaining blocks to follow. Other improvement work includes new kitchens, bathrooms, windows, doors, roofs, rewiring and heating systems to hundreds of homes. Sue Sutton, Chief Executive at Salix Homes, said: “As we continue to build new homes in Salford, we also remain dedicated to investing in our existing housing stock to ensure our customers have the high-quality, safe and sustainable homes they deserve. “This investment programme is one of our most ambitious yet, aimed at significantly enhancing our customers’ quality of life by creating safer, cleaner and greener homes and communities. “Sustainability is a key priority for Salix Homes – projects like the eco-transformation at Grey Friar Court and White Friar Court are pivotal in reducing our carbon footprint, tackling fuel poverty, and supporting Salford’s journey towards a greener future. “Additionally, the installation of sprinkler systems in five more of our tower blocks underpins our ongoing commitment to building safety, and we are very proud to continue making a positive impact on the lives of our customers and the broader Salford community.” Work is already well underway at Grey Friar Court and White Friar Court, with the scaffolding now erected. The work is being carried out by Salix Homes’ principal contractor Casey and includes external wall and roof insulation, new windows and ventilation; while the façade and balconies will be completely rendered and transformed. An eco-friendly ground source heating system will also be installed, which, combined with the external insulation will improve the thermal efficiency of the building and help reduce energy bills. The state-of-the-art heating system works by harnessing the natural heat from the ground, rather than burning fuel to generate heat. Salix Homes secured £4million from the government’s Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund (SHDF) to help fund the tower block project, following a successful bid from the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) on behalf of social housing providers across Greater Manchester. The SHDF scheme provides financial support to social housing providers and local authorities to undertake energy efficiency and decarbonisation measures. The Government has set a target that all social housing should have an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) of a ‘C’ rating by 2030, as part of the net zero programme to reduce the UK’s carbon emissions, while Salix Homes has committed to becoming a carbon neutral organisation by 2038. The five tower blocks to get sprinkler systems over the next year are Floral Court and Cheshill Court in Broughton and Black Friar Court, Newbank Tower and Riverbank Tower in Greengate. The improvement work will be carried out by Salix Homes’ partner contractors, including Casey, Connolly and Emanuel Whittaker.

Arun Lea, Broadbridge Heath and Little Mount Lake, near Tunbridge Wells, were both approved in detail by their respective councils. Phase 1 of Inspired’s Little Mount Lake community in the District of Wealden, West Sussex, was approved in 2021. This latest decision on Phases 2 and 3, that was unanimously approved by Wealden District Council’s Planning Committee last week, will deliver a further 91 specialist homes for over 65s. This will support the significant need for age-appropriate housing options for older people across the District while freeing up existing family homes in the area. Speaking at the committee, Cllr Johanna Howell, Wealden District Councillor for Frant & Wadhurst, said: “I visited an Inspired Village unit up in Leeds, near Leeds Castle, and was very impressed by them.” She added: “I would like to thank Inspired Villages for listening, for being there and being receptive to ideas – they are model for other people as to how they should go forward.” Inspired Villages are currently in the process of appointing a primary contractor to deliver the first phase. In addition to the jobs and apprenticeships created during construction, the new retirement community is expected to create approximately 30 full-time equivalent jobs for local people once Little Mount Lake is complete. The second success was for its Arun Lea community located in Broadbridge Heath, West Sussex. Phase 1 was approved in November last year for the village centre with restaurant, café and shop, as well as a swimming pool and sauna, all open to the wider community, in addition to 47 homes. Plans for Phases 2 and 3 were submitted in February this year for an extra 94 homes and approved by Horsham District Council last week. Ellen Pearce, Head of Planning at Inspired Villages commented, said: “We’re really pleased with the outcomes for our Arun Lea and Little Mount Lake communities as a tremendous amount of effort goes into each planning application. In the case of Little Mount Lake, we were keen to demonstrate to Wealden District Council Planning Committee Members what life at Inspired Villages looks like so it was fantastic to be able to share that with a tour around Ledian Gardens in Leeds, Kent. “We are now working toward the submission of a further seven planning applications for the remainder of the year and remain optimistic that the positive views of the council members and officers at these two communities will be echoed in other Local Authorities.” Inspired Villages CEO, Jamie Bunce continued: “Getting the green light to grow these two net-zero communities is a great way to kick off the second half of 2024. The simple fact is the UK needs more housing of every kind, the new National Planning Policy Framework states 1.5m new homes and these outcomes help towards that goal with a further 185 age-appropriate homes for our rapidly ageing population. It’s a positive step in the right direction and I would like to extend a huge well done to the planning team for all their hard work and dedication in making this happen.” Inspired Villages is an operator and developer of integrated retirement communities across the UK. It currently operates nine villages, which are home to over 1,200 residents.
