Retired Fire Truck Gets Converted Modified Machine to Clean and Spray O’Neill has acquired a com bination street cleaner, chem ical sprayer, and fire truck all in-one vehicle. When the city purchased a j new 15 - thousand - dollar fire j truck this spring one of the old j fire trucks was taken out of ser- j vice. : L. C. Anderson, city superin- j tendent, suggested that this old j truck be converted into a utility J truck. The conversion was done j in Grand Island. 3 Mr. Anderson demonstarted j the many uses of the truck at 3 the fire station this week. The 3 tank holds 750 gallons of water ] which can easily be refilled. It j will be possible to clean the < streets now without raising dust j and filth since the side-sprayer 3 flushes the water along the curb 3 and carries the dirt along the j gutter. A sprayer on tne rear Dumper, which is 12 feet long, will be used to wet down the streets be fore a parade, and can settle the dust ahead of the broom sweep when the streets are being cleaned. In addition, it will be possible for the city to spray the trees and alley ways to prevent and kill pests. This comes as good news since the canker worm which destroys trees has been moving from southern Nebraska to the north. Besides, it is equipped with a fire hose and will serve as a fire-fighter and auxiliary water supply. ' NEED HELP?
