        "text": "Randy J. Schaff, 50, New Salem, lost his long, courageous, hard fought battle with pancreatic cancer on November 22, 2021. Surrounded by his wife Kim, sons KC & Wyatt and sister-in-law Peggy, the buzzer sounded on his final ride here on earth.\n\nA memorial service will be held from 5 pm until 7 pm on Monday, November 29th at Weigel Funeral Home in Mandan. Funeral services will be held at 10 am on Tuesday, November 30th at Spirit of Life Catholic Church in Mandan. Burial will take place immediately following the funeral service at the Veterans Memorial Cemetery south of Mandan. Cremation has taken place.\n\nRandy was born May 19, 1971, to Kenneth & Cathy (Meuchel) Schaff in Mandan. He was raised and educated in Mandan and graduated from Mandan High School in 1989. Randy spent most of his early years spending time with his uncle Oscar & aunt Gerry Jochim helping them take care of their calves.\n\nRandy served our great country with honor for a total of 26 years with the Armed Forces of the United States, including 19 years of service with the North Dakota National Guard from which he retired in 2021.\n\nRandy met his love & life partner Kim Urban in 1997 and they married in 1999. Randy & Kim raised two amazing sons, KC & Wyatt.\n\nRandy spent many years chasin’ those dotted lines following his love and passion of rodeo. If he wasn’t riding bulls or bareback horses, throwing a loop at a steer during team roping, or maybe at a calf during Sr. men’s break away, you could definitely find him supporting his sons. KC as a bull fighter, Wyatt as a bull rider. Possibly even both at the same time. Many young cowboys looked up to him for his support and guidance in and out of the arena. Randy & Kim were also big supporters and donators to the Bismarck Cancer Center Trail Ride.\n\nRandy is survived by his wife Kim, his sons KC and daughter Graycyn, Wyatt and special friend Kaylee, sister-in-law Peggy Brandt (Corey), his parents Ken & Cathy, two brothers Ken Jr. (Julie), Rick and sister Wanda. He is also survived by many nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles and cousins and in-laws. Special friends Barry & Carol Beechie, TC Comeau, and Lance Comeau, his rodeo family and the NDNG 285th Aviation Regiment and too many more to mention. Just know, if you knew him, you were also very special to him.\n\nRandy is preceded in death by his mother-in-law and father-in-law Delores and Duane Urban, both sets of grandparents and several aunts, uncles, and friends.\n\nRandy was the true definition of the Great American Cowboy and Soldier. He instilled his love and devotion to our country and the cowboy lifestyle in everyone he encountered. He will forever be missed but never forgotten. Ride free dear cowboy, your work on earth is done.\n\nSpecial thank you to our friends and family, Sanford Medical Center, Oncology & Cancer Center and his hospice team for all of your support and dedication during this challenging time.\n\nThe family requests that you wear orange or purple in honor of Randy."
