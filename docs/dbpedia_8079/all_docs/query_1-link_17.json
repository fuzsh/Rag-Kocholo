        "text": "Ken Jones - retiring Chief Constable\n\nSir Kenneth Lloyd \"Ken\" Jones QPM is a British former police officer. He was a Deputy Commissioner of Victoria Police in Australia, former President of Association of Chief Police Officers for England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom[2] and Senior Investigator of Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) of Hong Kong. Sir Ken Jones is a former President of Association of Chief Police Officers and presently defence & security advisor at the British Embassy in Washington DC. He was awarded the Queens Police Medal in 2000 and was knighted for services to policing in 2009.\n\nWith South Yorkshire Police, Jones served in a number of cities including Sheffield, Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster gaining experience with community beat duties, specialist detective work and the use of firearms. Whilst there he received three Chief Constable's Commendations. He has commanded both rural and urban divisions. He gained experience abroad working as an anti corruption investigator in Hong Kong and as an election monitor in Zimbabwe. he visited the West Coast of the United States to study the growth of private policing.\n\nSir Ken has also served in Africa (Zimbabwe-Rhodesia), the United States (as a Fulbright Scholar at UCLA in 1996) and Hong Kong (in the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC)). He was appointed Assistant Chief Constable of the Avon and Somerset Constabulary in 1997.\n\nIn November 2001 he was promoted to Chief Constable of Sussex Police, serving until 2006.\n\nIn 2006 Jones became the President of the Association Of Chief Police Officers ACPO He was preceded by Sir Chris Fox QPM (2003 - 2006) and followed by Sir Hugh Orde OBE.\n\nSir Ken received the Queen's Police Medal in 2001 and was created a Knight in the 2009 New Year honours list.\n\nDuring the time Sir Ken Jones served Victoria Police Force he became the subject of death threats which came to public light in December 2010. This signalled the start of the complicated relationship at the top of Victoria Police concerning the integrity of the presentation of crime statistics to the public between Jones and Overland.\n\nConcerns have been raised about Overland's actions as there is an ongoing investigation into allegations of Overland's own conduct with the former Brumby government, in particular the release of incomplete favorable crime statistics prior to the 2010 election.\n\nJones had objected to this politicisation of policing. Jones was reportedly the subject of an investigation by the Office of Police Integrity requested by Overland, over Overland's suspicions that he helped media expose the cherry-picked crime statistics. However these reports were found to be untrue and harmful to Sir Ken Jones' career in a report published by the Ombudsman.\n\nIBAC Press release, para 5 : \"Mr Kellams review concluded that the evidence available to OPI and set out in OPIs final investigation report to the Ombudsman did not support an allegation that Sir Ken Jones QPM had engaged in serious misconduct by leaking or facilitating leaking to the media of confidential police information\". This final report cleared Jones of any wrongdoing during his time at Victoria Police Force.\n\nTHE POLICE INVESTIGATION CODE OF CONDUCT\n\nNot many people get a reply to their correspondence even when reporting serious crimes, but this force will spend £10,000 of public money attempting to prosecute a person for goods to the value of £19.99, where that person is a thorn in the side of their chums at Wealden District Council.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, this force appear hesitant to investigate complaints involving £ hundreds of thousands of pounds in connection with land fraud and manipulation of land values.\n\nWEALDEN DISTRICT COUNCIL MALFEASANCE\n\nIn December of 2016 two members of the public independently reported serious abuses of positions of trust at this Council.\n\nA historic case of ingrained misuse of public office comes from Mr Chester Hudson reporting serious fraud involving Ian Kay and Mr Kay's father in law.\n\nA crime that is in progress as of 12th December 2016 comes from Nelson Kruschandl reporting serious fraud involving documents obtained by deception being lodged on the Local Land Charges Register to cause loss, contrary to Section 4 of the Fraud Act 2006. The officers concerned include David Whibley, George White and in the background, Ian Kay, David Phillips, J Douglas Moss and Thomas Hoy.\n\nThe police intend to keep a lid on these crimes by maintaining that their investigation and conviction of their victim was honest and decent when in fact they knew he was being fitted up and that the girl they were using to gain such controls (a masons granddaughter) was a virgin. The conviction of course was for claimed multiple penetrations (rape) and yet the Jury were not told that she her hymen was intact, rather they were told to concentrate on marks that their so-called expert said were suspicious when it must have been that she knew that these marks were naturally occurring in females of all ages. This particular miscarriage of justice was simply to gain access to more agencies in the hope of further discrediting the activist.\n\nANY MASONS ON YOUR BEAT? - The current Chief Constable is Giles York seen in the picture above. How many masons do Sussex Police have in their ranks is a mystery, but masonic lodges and their members are thought to control the outcomes of most criminal cases in the United Kingdom, simply because we have no written Constitution. Laws and made and changed almost daily by judges who might be doing a favour for one party one day and another favour for another party another day - contrary to the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, Articles 10 and 11 - where the Courts are not independent but some judges work with other masons in the CPS and local police to steer the outcomes to a forgone conclusion. Defence barristers who might be angling for a position on the bench are also influenced by such a system to provide a poor defence in some cases, but concerning a police officer accused of murder, or a planning officer accused of fraud - a free 'Get Out of Jail' card. If a barrister does not tow the party line he or she will never be selected for a position as a judge.\n\nSIMILAR FACT EVIDENCE\n\nThere are too many cases that demonstrate failures in investigations for this to be a coincidence. Certain individuals that fall foul of Wealden District Council almost invariably end up being wrongly imprisoned or otherwise with a criminal record as a way of Sussex Police to aid and abet this corrupt council. This is one of Weaden's favourite ploys for disposing of cases where they have been caught red-handed tampering with or otherwise falsifying evidence in neighbour disputes, where Wealden have taken the side of the more influential citizen - instead of investigating matters impartially. Wealden's Gestapo like tactics are well known and adopted by other councils according to media reports.\n\nJOHN HOATH & CHRISTOPHER (CRIPPS HARRIES) HALL\n\nThe wrongful imprisonment of John Hoath is another of the incredible miscarriages of justice occasioned by the Sussex Police .....\n\nMISFEASANCE & MALFEASANCE\n\nWhen an officer of the courts' omits to include evidence that he knows is relevant to a hearing, that is termed misfeasance in public office. Where an officer then tries to cover up his or her misfeasance (as did Ian Kay in the Stream Farm matter), that becomes malfeasance. The difference is that misfeasance is a civil wrong, whereas malfeasance is a criminal offence. The leading case precedent on malfeasance is: R. v Bowden 1995 Court of Appeal (98 1 WLR). In this case Bowden was a police officer who saw a crime in progress and walked away from it, calling in sick the next day to seek to cover up his wrongdoing.\n\nIf you are the victim of a wrongful prosecution or the police are refusing to investigate a crime you might think of taking your case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), we would though advise that in serious cases of institutionalized corruption, that you should first lodge copy of your complaint with the Attorney General, Lord Chancellor and the Prime Minister of the day, David Cameron, who is responsible for running our administration under a mandate from the current Ruler of the United Kingdom.\n\nKaty Bourne was elected Crime Commissioner, taking office with an oath to serve the public interest. That is an oath that many are now questioning, where she appears to be serving Sussex Police instead of policing the organisation that has come under such flack for their blatant refusal to investigate so many complaints of malfeasance in public office.\n\nIPCC CONTACTS\n\nIndependent Police Complaints Commission\n\nPO Box 473\n\nSale, M33 0BW\n\nSwitchboard: 0300 020 0096\n\nEmail: enquiries@ipcc.gsi.gov.uk\n\nHard of hearing: 18001 0207 166 3000\n\nLINKS & REFERENCE\n\nhttp://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/news/local/queen-s-police-medal-honour-for-chief-constable-1-6504564\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-28091706\n\nhttps://www.ipcc.gov.uk/\n\nVicarage Lane, Hailsham, East Sussex, BN27 2AX T: 01323 443322\n\nPine Grove, Crowborough, East Sussex, TN6 1DH T: 01892 653311\n\nLINKS & REFERENCE\n\nhttp://shadowsussexpolicecrimecommissioner.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/three-new-cases-to-rock-sussex-police.html\n\nhttp://www.royalmail.com/\n\nhttp://www.sussex.police.uk/\n\nhttp://www.wealden.gov.uk/"
