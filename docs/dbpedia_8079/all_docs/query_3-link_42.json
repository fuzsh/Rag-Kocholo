        "text": "Kenneth Franklin (Frank) Curley, 59, lay down for the final time at his home in Ripplemead, Thursday, September 27, 2018 surrounded by family and loved ones.\n\nBorn April 7, 1959 in Welch, WV to Kenneth and the late Helen Curley, he grew up in Elbert, WV where two things happened that would steer his path in life - his love and passion for cars and what would be a life-long battle with diabetes. After attending Bluefield State he moved to Pembroke and worked at Mitchener's selling cars. It was there that fate stepped in and he met Toni Wilburn, the love of his life for the next 30 years. He soon joined the Mormon Church, holding offices of Clerk, Young Men's Counselor, nursery helper and high priest. He was a devoted servant and loved his callings. He and Toni enjoyed traveling but his happiest was when sitting at home, relaxing with Toni at their Ripplemead home. Frank struggled with health issues his entire life and survived numerous scares - but endured.\n\nHe leaves to cherish his memory his devoted and loving wife Toni Wilburn Curley; his father Kenneth and wife Emma Jean Curley of Princeton, WV; his sister Becky and husband Alan Riggins of Thorpe, WV and nieces Jennifer and Janna as well as daughter Ragan and husband Michael Savedra in Texas; and numerous family and friends and faithful canine companion, Molly. In his words, \"It's your world - I'm just passing through it\"\n\nFuneral services will be conducted Sunday afternoon, September 30, 2018 in the New River Ward of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, in Pembroke, at 2:00 pm. The family will receive friends at the church Saturday evening from 5 until 7 pm. Private burial will follow the services in the Kire Community Cemetery in the Big Stony Creek section of Giles County.\n\nThe Kendall Funeral Home in Pembroke is in charge of the arrangements.\n\nOnline condolences may be sent by visiting kendallfuneralhome.com."
