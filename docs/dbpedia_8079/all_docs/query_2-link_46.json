        "text": "Courtney Dawn Steer\n\nJuly 6, 1995  Sept. 20, 2022\n\nMcCOOK, Neb.  Courtney Dawn Steer, known as CD to her family, was called home on Tuesday, Sept. 20, 2022.\n\nCourtney was born July 6, 1995, in McCook, to Jamie Steer. She grew up in Red Willow County and graduated from McCook High School in 2012. After high school, she attended Joseph College of Hair in North Platte, Neb. Several months later, she ventured to North Carolina then on to Atlanta, Aa., where she became self-employed, living her life as she saw fit. Courtney later returned home to Nebraska to live out the rest of her life. Courtney had a love for animals, especially her own fur babies; CJ and Purdy. She loved being outdoors, camping, fishing and hunting. She loved tattoos, and enjoyed drawing and coloring in her free time. Courtney was a wildflower with a gypsy soul and a heart of a fighter. She would never back down from anyone and no one could tell her otherwise.\n\nCourtney was preceded in death by her guardian angel and Grandmother, Frances E. Steer and brother, Timothy Emory.\n\nShe is survived by her parents, Jamie and Kenneth Emory of McCook; siblings, Tyler Steer-Emory, Shayla Emory, Tonya Emory, Cory Emory, Cliff Emory, Keith Howard, Kendrick Howard, Kenneth Emory Jr., Cassie Emory, Tinka Jones, Trey Deuce, Andre Cole, and McKenzie Hernandez; aunts and uncles, Andy (Tara) Jernigan, Tina Jernigan, Christie Luke, John Steer, Bobbie (Jay) Ogden, James aka Benji Steer; honorary aunts, Trisha (Darren) Wulf, Darr Stehno and Tammy (George) Schleeman; cousins, John Paul, Joshua, Andie, Corban, Kaden, Caitlin, Rachel, Latisha, Shaynee, Gregg, Eric, Nicc, Holden, Kobe, Jacob, Kaylee, Blake, Hannah, Samantha, Graciah, Emily, Austin, Blake, Erica, Sianney, Saniyah, Crystal, Kyston, Amelia, Oakley, Paisley, Willow, and Wllem; along with many more extended family and friends.\n\nThe family requests memorial tributes to be directed to Courtneys Funeral Fund to assist with expenses. Any excess will be donated to the McCook Humane Society in memory of Courtney and her love of animals.\n\nA celebration of life will be on Friday, Sept. 30, 2022, at 2 p.m., at Carpenter Breland Funeral Home in McCook, with Mike Roth officiating."
