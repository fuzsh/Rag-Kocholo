        "text": "Preface Last Updated: 7/1/2004 6:20 AM\n\nIndia challenges and fascinates any newcomer as a land of contrasts: 4,000-year-old Indus Valley seals in the National Museum. Indian teens browsing among the latest Western fashions to the beat of rock music at Benetton's. Elephants draped in red and gold plodding up music-filled driveways of five-star hotels amid lights and gyrating wedding guests. Bazaars filled with ultra-soft pashmina shawls and silk saris edged in gold. Cows dozing on the center divider of busy urban avenues. White-water rafting on the chilly Ganga (Ganges River). Bookstores with Anglo-Indian literature and American novels. Delicious makhani dal (red bean dish) and masala dosa (South Indian crispy potato-filled pancake). Graceful Maharaja palaces offering tourist specials. Bird sanctuaries with wintering flamingos and cranes from Siberia. More than a dozen recognized regional languages with English widely spoken from north to south. And one of the wonders of the world-the Taj Mahal in Agra. India requires patience and flexibility. First-time travelers overseasas well as veteranscan expect a certain amount of culture shock. The English language is used in ways that may perplex Americans. Local customs concerning timeliness and sanitation are relaxed. Indians may give the answer they think a questioning foreigner wants to hear, rather than the truth. Gentle persistence on issues of importance to you yields dividends.\n\nIndia, especially New Delhi, is a wonderful family Post. Schooling, support and social activities are good and plentiful. \"Ach-cha\" (fine) or \"T.K.\" (o.k.), accompanied by a head bobble, is the most common reply to a question. So, \"Na-must-ay\" (hello) and \"Welcome to India!\"\n\nThe Host Country\n\nArea, Geography, and Climate Last Updated: 7/5/2005 5:03 AM\n\nIndia\"Bharat\" to most Indiansis the seventh largest country in the world, with an area approximately one-third the size of the U.S. India is bordered by China, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar (Burma), and Sri Lanka. To the west, south, and east, India is surrounded by the seathe Arabian Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the Bay of Bengal, respectively. The Lakshadweep Islands off the southwest coast and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, 750 miles off the southeast coast in the Bay of Bengal, belong to India.\n\nIndia stretches more than 2,000 miles from Jammu and Kashmir in the north to the southern tip of Tamil Nadu. It is 1,800 miles from Gujarat in the west to Arunachal Pradesh in the east.\n\nThe topography is dominated in the far north by the majestic Himalayas, which include the world's highest peaks. From the Himalayan foothills to the Vindhyachal Range in central India spreads the vast, fertile, heavily populated Gangetic Plain. The sacred Ganges (Ganga) and the Yamuna Rivers dissect the Plain. South of the Vindhyachal Range lies the Deccan Plateau. The Western and Eastern Ghats lie along the southern coastlines.\n\nThe climate in India ranges from Arctic-like conditions in the high Himalayas, to blast furnace heat in many parts of the country during the summer, and heavy monsoon downpours during the rainy season. At other times, the weather can be mild and delightfully pleasant. (See the Temperature, Humidity, and Rainfall Chart.)\n\nNew Delhi has an altitude of 700 feet above sea level in north central India. The weather in the capital is most pleasant during the temperate months of October-November and February, periods characterized by cool nights and warm days. Although the winter months of December and January are usually fairly temperate, the it can become surprisingly cold at night. From April through mid-July daytime temperatures often top 110°F. The nights cool off somewhat, but are still hot. From mid-July to September, the occasional monsoon rains combine high humidity with high temperatures.\n\nNew Delhi is experiencing a serious and long-term water shortage, with potential impact on both residential and office facilities. While the Embassy is fortunate to have a tanker service to partially offset the shortages in municipal supplies, the demand may eventually exceed capacity for these deliveries. For example, in March 2003 Facilities Maintenance Service made 223 water deliveries; in March 2004 it was 341 deliveries. Without water deliveries, these residences would have no water for cooking, cleaning, washing, flushing, etc. Remember, everyone has both the ability and the responsibility to help conserve water. This includes children and domestics as well, so please instruct them regarding conservation tips. By conserving water you are helping yourself, helping the community and helping India!\n\nThroughout the year, severe air pollution is a problem in New Delhi. (See the Health and Medicine Section for health concerns.) During the monsoon season, mosquitoes breed in standing water. That spreads malaria, Japanese B Encephalitis, and dengue fever. Mold, dust, and bacterial infections are common. Cockroaches, termites, moths, and flies are common pests.\n\nMumbai (formerly known as Bombay), India's financial capital, is a port on the Arabian Sea in the western state of Maharashtra. On a map, Mumbai appears as a peninsula (actually two islands) off the west coast of India. A great natural harbor provides 75 square miles of sheltered deep water.\n\nMumbai has a tropical climate with three distinct seasons. The heat and high humidity of April, May, and October make life quite uncomfortable. The monsoon season, June to September, brings a welcome relief although the humidity remains high. An average of 77 inches of rain falls during the monsoon. Late November through February is cooler, although the days are still hot and sunny.\n\nCalcutta, the capital of the state of West Bengal, is situated on the Hooghly River about 80 miles north of the Bay of Bengal. Because the city is built on near sea-level marshland, Calcutta and its suburbs suffer from poor drainage and periodic floodingespecially during the monsoon, June to October. From November through February, temperatures are pleasant; however, the city suffers from considerable air pollution during these months. The heat begins in March, and occasional \"nor'westers\" bring welcome cool winds and rain from the Himalayas through May. Then the overcast sky of the monsoon brings relief from the glare of the sun, even though the temperature remains high.\n\nChennai (formerly known as Madras), the capital of Tamil Nadu, lies on the shore of the Bay of Bengal, about 900 miles north of the Equator. Chennai has a medium-sized artificial harbor and a wide sandy beach that extends for several hundred miles along the coast. The surrounding countryside is a largely flat, coastal plain devoted to rice cultivation. It is green and fertile during part of the year but dry and dusty during the rainless spring and early summer months.\n\nThe climate is tropical throughout the year. December and January are relatively cool months. The weather heats up drastically from March through June. Unfortunately, as the temperature rises, so does the humidity. Chennai is unique among the Consulates General cities as its primary rainy season occurs later; i.e., from mid-September through mid-December. Premonsoon rains bring slight relief in July/August, and the temperatures decrease slowly until the cooler season returns in November. During the hottest months, sea breezes occasionally lessen the discomfort.\n\nChennai averages 48 inches of rain annually, although droughts occur when the monsoon fails. Most rain falls from October through December, but frequent showers can occur from May to September. Occasionally, cyclones strike the coast. Mildew damage occurs throughout the year. All U.S. Government houses have air-conditioners in every room to help combat this fungus, as well as to provide comfort.\n\nClimate Chart Average Temperature (F), Humidity, and Annual Rainfall (inches)\n\nAvg.

If current population growth trends continue, India's population will likely surpass China's in the next 20 to 30 years. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General are located in the following cities: Delhi (including New Delhi), 14 million; greater Mumbai (Bombay), 16 million; greater Calcutta, 12 million; and Chennai (Madras), 10 million.\n\nIndia is a predominantly rural country; more than three-fourths of the people live in villages. Nevertheless, India's cities are huge and continue to expand with the annual migration of hundreds of thousands of rural residents. The strain on the cities to provide basic services to these burgeoning populations is outstripping their resources. The result is predictablethe quality and reliability of the water, power, transportation, and communications infrastructures have deteriorated in many urban centers.\n\nIndia is a cultural, linguistic, ethnic, and religious mosaic unequaled in the world. The nation's 28 states and 7 union territories are established roughly along ethnic and linguistic lines. Hindi has been designated as the national language; it is used widely throughout the north and is increasingly understood in other parts of the nation, especially in large urban centers. English also continues as a language link between educated people from different parts of the country. Shopping and getting around in any of the urban areas can be easily done in English. Communication in rural areas can also be pursued in English, but some understanding of Hindi or the local language is a definite advantage.\n\nAlthough largely a Hindu nation (nearly 80% of the population), India has a huge Muslim population (approximately 15%)the world's second largest, after Indonesia. Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jains, and others make up the balance. Religion in India often provides identity and defines a way of life. Marriage, clothing, diet, employment, and location of housing can be dictated by religious considerations. Most women and some men dress in their traditional clothing, though modern fashions tend to blur ethnic lines in cities. (See Clothing under the Embassy and Consulates General for more details.)\n\nMost Indians have dietary restrictions; many are vegetarian, and some avoid eggs and dairy products. Many fast on a particular day of the week. Among those who do eat meat, Hindus do not eat beef and Muslims avoid pork. In cities, Indians generally dine late, often as late as 9 or 10 p.m.\n\nCaste identification remains strong today, even among some non-Hindus. Having evolved over thousands of years, castes or family clans now number in the hundreds and are roughly divided by the Government into the Forward Castes (priestly, warrior, and business), Backward Castes (agrarian and tradesmen), Scheduled Castes (formerly untouchables), and Tribes. Despite longstanding government affirmative action programs, most members of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes remain at the bottom of India's social and economic ladder. Socially, an Indian is expected to marry within his/her own caste.\n\nDating and public displays of affection are rarely seen. Arranged marriages are the norm, though there are exceptions, especially among the urban middle class. The traditional joint family is common, and a bride typically moves into her in-laws' home. Traditionally, an Indian family is not considered complete until there is a male heir to care for his parents in their old age and to light their funeral pyres.\n\nPublic Institutions Last Updated: 7/2/2004 6:45 AM\n\nIndia is a democratic republic made up of 28 states and 7 union territories. Its 1950 constitution is mainly derived from the British parliamentary system. The constitutional head of state is the President, although his duties are mainly ceremonial. He resides in Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi, formerly the residence of the British Viceroy. Executive power is held by the Prime Minister and his Council of Ministers (the Cabinet) who belong to the majority party or a coalition in the lower house of Parliament (\"Lok Sabha\").\n\nLegislative power is vested in the bicameral Parliament, which is made up of the \"Rajya Sabha\" with 245 appointed and indirectly elected members, and the \"Lok Sabha,\" with 543 directly elected and 2 appointed members.\n\nThe judicial system is headed by a Supreme Court appointed by the President.\n\nThe political structure of the state governments is similar. The Governor, who is appointed by the President, is ceremonial head of the government. The Chief Minister and his cabinet members, who come from the majority party or coalition in the State Assembly (Legislature), exercise executive authority.\n\nNational political parties include the Congress (I) Party, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Janata Party (United), Communist Party of India (CPI), and Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM). In addition, there are several important regionally based political parties, including Telugu Desam, All India Anna Dravida Munetra Kazhagam, Dravida Munetra Kazhagam, Akali Dal, and Samajwadi Janata Dal. Many philanthropic organizations exist in India. The Rotary and Lions Clubs, the Red Cross, the YWCA and YMCA, the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides--to name a few. The National Cadet Corps selects young men and women from all over the country to train at a military camp in New Delhi each year.\n\nArts, Science, and Education Last Updated: 7/2/2004 6:45 AM\n\nThe cultural heritage of India is one of the richest and most ancient in the world. India absorbed immigrants and invaders with their varied cultures. Although as a nation state India is little more than 50 years old (1947), it has an ancient civilization spanning more than 4,000 years.\n\nIndian architecture and sculpture have served primarily religious functions, mainly in temple carvings, tombs, mosques, and churches (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam). The pinnacle of Muslim Mughal architecture was reached in the 17th century when Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal at Agra as a tomb for his favorite wife.\n\nBeginning with the sacred Vedas, Sanskrit literature developed over 2,500 years and is now alive in the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana, which were originally handed down orally. Indian philosophy, which analyzes the soul, karma (action or duty) and salvation, is divided into many schools of thought (e.g., schools of Yoga).\n\nIndian music comprises a wide variety of instrumental and vocal traditions, among which are classical, religious, popular, theatrical, and modern. The internationally famous Ravi Shankar still performs on his sitar, accompanied by tabla drummers.\n\nThe classical traditions of Indian dance are at least 2,000 years old and have evolved into dance dramas that dramatize Hindu religious stories through stylized gestures, which are highly symbolic and emotionally suggestive.\n\nEducation is primarily the responsibility of the state governments. Although free in most states for children between the ages of six and fourteen, education is not compulsory. Secondary schools offer instruction in Hindi, English, and the appropriate regional language. Higher education is provided in colleges, universities, and technical institutes. Social education programs promote adult literacy. In the 50+ years since independence, India has built a university education system that is second in size only to that of the U.S. with 200 universities and more than 6,300 colleges.\n\nCommerce and Industry Last Updated: 7/1/2004 7:14 AM\n\nIndia has a population growth rate of more than 1.6% per year and a real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate since the early 1980 is averaging 6%one the highest consistent growth rates in the world. This combination has made modest progress in improving the standard of living for most of India's population. Per capita income is $470one of the lowest in the world, but India has a sizable and growing middle class of 330-340 million.\n\nIndia is the world's fourth largest economy in purchasing power parity terms after the U.S., Japan, China, and Germany according to the IMF. Agriculture's share of GDP has declined steadily since independence from 60% in 1950 to 22.7% in 2003. Farming, however, remains the main economic livelihood of approximately two-thirds of the population. India is self-sufficient in food grains production, but imports edible oil and pulses. The manufacturing sector, including heavy industry, has grown gradually over the same period from approximately 15% of GDP to more than 23.5%. The services sector has grown the fastest since independence and now comprises roughly 50.7% of GDP.\n\nIndia generally runs a modest trade and current account deficit. India's leading exports include textiles and garments, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, agro products, engineering goods, gems and jewelry, and in recent years, manufactured goods. Principal imports include petroleum, capital goods, chemicals, electronic goods, pearls, gold and silver, and edible oils. India accounts for less than 1% of world trade. With $18 billion in two-way trade, the U.S. is India's largest trading partner followed by the U.K., Belgium, and Japan. The U.S. is the largest foreign investor and the largest source of joint ventures in India.\n\nTextiles remain the most important industry, along with steel, heavy industry, and chemicals. The rapidly growing software sector is boosting service exports and modernizing India's economy. India now manufactures a variety of finished products, including consumer durables such as TVs, washers, stereos, electronics equipment, computer software, and automobiles for domestic use and export. Mineral resources (coal, iron ore, bauxite, and manganese) are substantial but have been only partially tapped.\n\nThe Information Technology (IT) sector in India is growing rapidly. Indian IT companies developing software for Indian and international clients are gradually achieving parity, both in size of projects and quality, with the best software developers in the West. Annual Indian IT industry turnover totals $15.9 billion, software exports amounting to $4-12.5 billion, and domestic software $3.4 billion. Revenues from the IT industry will cross $20 billion in 2004-05. In terms of IT usage in India, PC penetration is currently 8 per 1,000. PC sales are growing by more than 35% annually, and this figure is expected to grow to 10 per 1,000 by 2005. Real growth in Internet use will probably not be realized until the Internet can connect to the 40 million Indian cable TV customers.\n\nTransportation\n\nAutomobiles Last Updated: 6/18/2004 4:56 AM\n\nMost people assigned to India find having a car convenient. U.S. Government employees who do not ship a car may make do with taxis, which are usually available and less expensive than in the U.S.\n\n(For information on diplomatic privileges with regard to importation and sale of imported vehicles upon departure, see Notes for Travelers, Customs and Duties. This information may affect the type of vehicle you consider bringing to India. For information on hiring drivers, see Domestic Help under the post cities.)\n\nFor the purpose of discussing privileges extended to diplomats serving in India, the term \"diplomat\" refers to those on the diplomatic list recognized by the Government of India.\n\nLocally Manufactured Vehicles. An increasing number of U.S. Government employees buy locally manufactured automobiles, which can be purchased immediately on payment with delivery within a few days. The diplomatic buyer receives an immediate exemption from the Delhi sales tax (app. 10% of the vehicle price). The buyer does pay the Indian Federal excise tax at the time of purchase (approximately 24% of the vehicle price), but this amount is reimbursed in Rupees within three or four months upon an application through GSO. The local dealer normally includes three free automobile mechanical service checks. The cost for a locally manufactured car ranged in 2004 from approximately $12,250 to $20,850 before taxes are reimbursed. Reimbursement reduces the effective purchase cost of a new locally manufactured car to the range of $8,000-$12,000.\n\nA wide range of locally manufactured U.S. and international auto brands (Ford, Opel/GM, Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Hyundai, Honda, Maruti/Suzuki, etc.) are available. These vehicles are mostly small to mid-sized and lack some of the electronic features common to vehicles in the U.S. Locally manufactured four-wheel-drive vehicles are less common.\n\nImported Motor Vehicles. Most employees import vehicles that have air-conditioning. Air-conditioning is desirable during hot or humid months, and a necessity to avoid breathing the excessive vehicle exhaust fumes in most cities. Traffic moves on the left side of the road. Although a small car is easier to maneuver on Indian roads, a medium or large-size vehicle is considered safer due to the frequency of serious accidents. Visibility is better in a minivan or 4-wheel-drive utility vehiclethe driver can anticipate traffic conditions ahead. Due to the requirements of good-quality gasoline and specific diagnostic equipment, cars with computer-controlled fuel injection systems can be problematic. However, for such vehicles imported by employees, service organizations provide adequate local servicing and import needed spare parts.\n\nAlso, an employee can import needed spare parts duty free after obtaining a duty exemption certificate from the Ministry of External Affairs. Accessories for imported automobiles should be shipped in the HHEnot with the vehicle. Car owners may want to ship spare tires, fan belts, oil filters, air filters, fuses, spark plugs, windshield wiper blades, sun shades for the windshield, steering wheel cover (to prevent a steering wheel from becoming too hot to handle), and replacement light bulbs. Many of these items are imported and are now sold in India; however, quality, cost, and availability may be a problem. It is important to deal with a reputable local supplier.\n\nInform the post and obtain specific instructions if you plan to import a motorcycle. Motorcycles, regarded as motor vehicles by the Government of India, may not be included in HHE shipments. They must be boxed in a wooden crate and shipped under motor vehicle conditions. Importing a motorcycle takes the place of shipping an automobile. If entitled to ship one vehicle to India, you may not ship both an automobile and a motorcycle. Also, consider that motorcycle riding is considered very dangerous in India due to the lack of protection in case of accident.\n\nShipping. In an effort to reduce New Delhi pollution levels, only vehicles that conform to Euro II pollution norms or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Emission Standards may be registered in the National Capital Region of Delhi. If you intend to ship a U.S.-manufactured vehicle, you must bring with you a certificate issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stating that the emission norms of the vehicle conform with EPA standards. Vehicles manufactured outside of the U.S. may only be registered in New Delhi if the vehicle has the required Euro II pollution certificate from the vehicle manufacturer. Employees should not attempt to import non-EPA/Euro II compliant vehicles.\n\nDiplomatic and consular officers are allowed to sell right-hand drive vehicles on the open market without customs duty once the vehicle has been in-country for four years. Right-hand drive vehicles in-country less than four years can only be sold tax-free to other diplomats, or exported from India. If a right-hand drive vehicle which has been in-country less than four years is sold on the open market, the seller is responsible for collecting applicable customs duty from the buyer. Left-hand drive vehicles may only be sold to another diplomat or privileged person.\n\nOnce loaded on a ship, the vehicle may require at least two (2) months to arrive at an Indian port. Processing and movement of the vehicle from the port to post takes additional time. Upon arrival at post, the vehicle should be inspected for loss or damage. (For additional information, see Customs, Duties, and Passage.)\n\nInsurance. Any company may be used for maritime insurance for the shipment of a motor vehicle to India. Regular automobile insurance for the duration of the employee's stay in India can be obtained after arrival at post.\n\nThe Government of India requires all vehicle owners to purchase third-party-liability insurance, which costs about $25 a year. The U.S. Mission, however, recommends additional coverage because driving in India is difficult and accidents are common.\n\nA discount on additional insurance is available to those who present a letter from their most recent insurance agent, specifying the number of years of accident-free driving. A 20% discount is given to those with one (1) accident-free year, 25% for two (2) years, 35% for three (3) years, 45% for four (4) years and 50% for the fifth year.\n\nIf a duty-free motor vehicle is totaled in an accident in India and is disposed of within four (4) years of its importation, the Government of India requires payment of the Customs duty. This duty will be deducted from the sale price of a totaled vehicle, e.g. if the sale price of a totaled vehicle is Rs. 100/- and GOI duty is 65%, then Rs. 35/- would be retained by the employee and Rs. 65/- would be collected by the GOI as Customs duty. Some employees prefer to insure against this possibility also.\n\nRegistration. An automobile should be registered within 30 days from date of receipt. The GSO Shipping Section in the U.S. Mission will help with registration. Diplomats pay no registration fee and no road tax.\n\nGSO Shipping will also help obtain temporary and regular license plates, which last up to 10 years. Registration stickers for tax-exempt vehicles expire each year on March 31 and may be renewed by presenting a valid insurance certificate.\n\nA pollution check is made on the carbon monoxide output by the local transit authority. If the vehicle does not pass, a tune-up and a carburetor cleaning usually suffice. The owner of a vehicle is required to obtain this certificate every three (3) months from a gas station.\n\nDrivers license. All employees and dependents (18 years of age or older) who expect to drive in India must obtain an Indian drivers license. All applicants must submit a medical certificate with the application and appear at the licensing bureau. GSO will assist with the process, which can take two (2) hours.\n\nFuel. Diesel fuel, 93-octane petrol (gasoline) and unleaded fuel are readily available throughout the country. Both petrol and diesel are available at the Embassy and certain Consulates General pumps are free of the excise duty. Diesel costs about one-third as much as petrol.\n\nRental Cars. In India, a rental automobile usually comes with a driver. Air-conditioning costs more. Using rental services through a hotel more than doubles the cost, but this insures an English-speaking driver. One can rent a car without a driver through Budget and Hertz.\n\nNew Delhi. Arriving and departing personnel and their dependents are authorized home-to-office transportation during the first and last thirty (30) days of their tours. Post will collect a charge not to exceed $2.70 per person per one-way trip, which is the standard cost of using public transportation in the Washington DC area. In addition, official vehicles will be provided for check-in and check-out requirements, and for official functions as available.\n\nWith its wide boulevards and flower-filled traffic circles, New Delhi is probably the easiest Indian city in which to drive . The Embassy is located in Chanakyapuri and most employees live within a 20-minute drive. Some are close enough to walk to work.\n\nMotor vehicles for use in New Delhi should be equipped with an air-conditioner and a heater. The summers are hot and the winters can be cold--almost down to freezing.\n\nOnce a vehicle arrives in Mumbai, it usually takes five (5) days to arrive in Delhi. The Customs clearance is generally completed in Delhi and may take an additional three (3) days.\n\nThe American Community Support Association (ACSA) operates a petrol pump (gasoline station) at the Embassy in New Delhi for its members. In mid-2004, diesel cost $0.40 per liter and ordinary unleaded cost $0.70 per liter. (See Supplies and Services for information on auto repair.)\n\nMumbai. The Consulate General encourages employees to bring personally owned vehicles (POVs) to post. There is an initial adjustment period to Mumbai's fast-paced andcongested traffic, which moves on the left side. Hiring a driver is an affordable option, if you prefer not to drive. If you plan to ship a car and have not yet purchased one, a medium-sized, right-hand drive, air-conditioned vehicle with automatic transmission is best for Mumbai traffic. However, some Consulate General personnel drive left-hand-drive cars in Mumbai with no trouble.\n\nMumbai is not the best place to buy a new car. Local Toyota, Maruti/Suzuki, and Honda dealerships offer only locally built versions of selected models. Engines and certain components are imported, but car bodies and other parts are made locally. Not only are locally made Maruti/Suzukis expensive for the quality of the product, but export of these somewhat unique vehicles to a subsequent overseas Post might cause the owners problems later in securing service and spare parts. Dealers will not sell a tax-exempt car off the lot, thus, requiring diplomats to pay the full taxed amount up front and letting him or her sort out the tax exemption later. It is better to order a car from Japan or Dubai. However, be aware that the ordering and delivery process can take longer than six (6) months. An alternative is to buy a car from someone departing post or from another individual who is entitled to duty-free privileges. It is usually easy to sell a car to someone with duty-free privileges. Duty-free cars in good condition generally are in demand.\n\nPublic transportation is available for those who prefer not to ship a car to Mumbai. Taxis are inexpensive (about 50 cents one-way between home and work) and readily available during daytime hours though often not late in the night. However, they are small and uncomfortable. Local buses and trains are extremely crowded and unclean.\n\nCalcutta. Road conditions are poor. During the monsoon season, streets flood and can stay flooded for two to three days. Spare parts are not readily available for foreign-made cars.\n\nVehicles painted olive green in color are not acceptable for registration by local authorities.\n\nIt takes approximately one week to obtain a drivers license. A driving test is not necessary if you have a valid U.S. license. Local transportation includes the subway, buses, taxis, three-wheelers, and rickshaws. Buses are overcrowded, and service is irregular. Metered taxis are available at all major hotels and shopping areas. The rates are low; however, most taxi drivers prefer to negotiate a flat rate. Tipping is optional. The city subway provides service somewhat near to the Consulate General and the residential quarters. The stations are well maintained. The journey is comfortable, safe, and uninterrupted by traffic congestion.\n\nRental vehicles are available, but it is very difficult to get an English-speaking driver.\n\nChennai. Most employees find a personal automobile convenient for shopping, recreation, and family use. Cars should be air-conditioned and have a locking gas cap. Vehicles shipped from the U.S. take about two (2) months to reach the port of Chennai.\n\nDepending on the make, spare parts for imported vehicles can be ordered by FAX from the U.S., Europe, or Japan. Tax-exempt gasoline is available for U.S. Government employees only at the Consulate General pumps at a cost in 2000 of about $2.35 a U.S. gallon. (For more information on importation and sale of motor vehicles, see Customs, Duties, and Passage.)\n\nTransportation\n\nLocal Transportation Last Updated: 6/18/2004 6:23 AM\n\nPublic transportation in Indian cities includes trains, buses, taxis, auto rickshaws (three-wheeled covered scooters) and cycle rickshaws. Horse-drawn tongas are still seen in some cities and towns. Taxis and auto rickshaws are not air-conditioned, yet quite inexpensive. Meters are often not set at the current rate, but drivers will produce a current rate card if asked to substantiate the higher rate. Taxis charge higher rates late at night.\n\nVIP automobiles are given more leeway on the roads than are emergency vehicles. They usually come equipped with flashing lights, sirens, and are often accompanied by hand- and gun-waving security vehicles. (There are also VVIPs and VVVIPs.) Ambulances may have a small flashing light, but not a siren. Police vehicles (jeeps, motorscooters, buses) are marked \"Police\" in English or Hindi. Fire engines have sirens.\n\nTransportation\n\nRegional Transportation Last Updated: 6/18/2004 7:15 AM\n\nPublic transportation between cities is done by bus, train, or plane. India has an extensive rail system. State corporations run the bus companies which network throughout the country. Luxury tour buses can be rented.\n\nRoadways. India's highway system extends to most parts of the country. During the monsoon, roadways can become flooded from sudden downpours. Traffic is diverted, potholes and sinkholes appear while power and telephone service goes out. If you plan to do a lot of traveling in India by a personally owned vehicle, a four-wheel-drive utility vehicle with right-hand drive would be very useful.\n\nCars are driven on the left and most vehicles are right-hand drive. Operating a left-hand-drive vehicle outside city limits can be dangerous. The driver will need someone in the passenger seat to tell when to pass or when another vehicle or if an animal is coming head-on in the left lane.\n\nDriving is a challenge when sharing the road with the vehicles of varied speeds and sizestrucks, buses, auto rickshaws, Indian-made Marutis, bullock carts, bicycles, handcarts, bicycle rickshaws, motorcyclesnot to mention wandering livestock, taxis, pedestrians, and the occasional elephant or camel. Accidents are frequent and can be very serious, especially to unprotected passengers and pedestrians. Emergency medical services for road accident victims are usually poor or nonexistent.\n\nRoad conditions throughout the country differ from state to state. India began a new system of traffic signs in the 1990s. A single sign lists destinations and distances in English, Hindi, and the local language. Bypasses are being installed around major cities. Petrol pumps are readily available throughout the country with 93-octane petrol and diesel fuel.\n\nNo matter how challenging the new ways of the road may seem, Indian drivers are tolerant of unusual behavior on the roadways. The key to driving in India is patience, flexibility, and avoiding high speeds.\n\nAir. India has separate domestic and international terminals at the major airports. To enter the airport, you must have a current airplane ticket or an official airport pass. Check-in procedures take one to two hours for domestic flights and two to three hours for international flights. Most international flights arrive and depart in the middle of the night. Arriving passengers can expect to wait fifteen minutes to two hours for their baggage.\n\nNew Delhi. The KLM/Northwest \"code-share\" via Amsterdam currently provides daily service between the United States and Delhi. Likewise, United Airlines/Lufthansa via Frankfurt and Delta/Air France via Paris also have \"code-share\" service between the United States and Delhi. Both provide daily service out of Delhi.\n\nMumbai. Delta Airlines provides daily service to the U.S. via Paris. Both Lufthansa/United via Frankfurt and Northwest/KLM via Amsterdam have daily service. British Airways also provides daily service via London with onward connections on United and other American carriers.\n\nCalcutta. British Airways provides service to Calcutta only three times a week (on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays). The city is served by a few foreign carriers with limited services. Overnighting in Bangkok or Singapore is unavoidable. Calcutta is connected with major Indian cities by Indian Airlines, Jet Airways and Sahara Airlines.\n\nChennai. There are no direct American carriers to the U.S. from Chennai. There is a Lufthansa/United Airlines code-share flight via Frankfurt which provides daily service. On Wednesdays and Sundays, British Airways flies to London with onward flights to the U.S. via American carriers.\n\nDirect flight connections link various Indian cities with Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan. Indian Airlines, Jet Airways, Sahara Airlines and other private air carriers offer service throughout India. Domestic travel by air is expensive. A round trip from Delhi to Goa, a distance of 500 miles, costs $490.\n\nThere is no international airport departure tax to be paid at any of the airports in India.\n\nRailroads. India has one of the largest railway systems in the world. Although train stations can be a challenge, train travel is very enjoyable and probably the best way to see the country. Computerized ticketing and reservations should be arranged well in advance. Trains are no longer the bargain they once were. Indian rail offers first and second class sleepers, chair cars, compartments and air-conditioning as well as a choice of vegetarian or non-vegetarian meals. Passengers are encouraged to carry their own toilet paper and drinking water.\n\nRail and air travel in India requires a great deal of planning, patience and flexibility. Occasionally a train, plane or bus will be rescheduled.\n\nCommunications\n\nTelephones and Telecommunications Last Updated: 6/17/2004 2:30 AM\n\nThe Mission in New Delhi currently funds nine International Voice Gateway (IVG) lines, which are for the exclusive use of participating agencies. The participating agencies currently include the Department of State, Department of Defense, Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Agency for International Development. All agencies are encouraged to participate in the IVG program.\n\nLocal and international telephone service is available in India. Public telephone facilities are available at the STD Trunk Booking Office. Service is often disrupted, especially during monsoons. A heavy workload can delay repairs and installations. In general, the phone system functions adequately but requires patience, persistence, and low expectations.\n\nResidential telephones are installed and maintained by the local telephone company. The basic monthly rate is $5.70 for 50 calls and employees are responsible for paying their own bills, which are issued monthly. Most residences have telephones that are not removed when residents depart.\n\nTelephone numbers in India currently have7-digit numbers. Most homes have only one extension, usually placed by the front door or in the kitchen. Employees may wish to bring a telephone jack or Y-connection, extra wire, and extra telephones. A telephone-answering machine 220v, 50/60 cycles cordless phone with transformer is also handy. Many servant-handled messages are incomplete. Most Embassy employees in New Delhi now have residential telephones served by electronic digital exchanges; many have direct-dial capabilities for international calls.\n\nUSA-Direct is now available in India for collect and credit card calls. Many Embassy employees have an AT&T credit card for international use. Having the long-distance phone call originate in the U.S. incurs the least expense; therefore most employees use the IVG lines which originate in Beltsville, Maryland. Commercial telegraph, public fax, and international telex services are available in India, but are often unreliable. Long distance callback services are also available.\n\nOfficial and personal messages may be sent through the U.S. Mission and Consulates General by fax.\n\nTelephone No. Fax No.\n\nEmbassy New Delhi 91-11-2419-8000 91-11-2419-0017\n\nConsulate General Mumbai 91-22-2363-3611/18 91-22-2363-0350\n\nConsulate General Calcutta 91-33-2282-3611/15 91-33-2282-2335\n\nConsulate General Chennai 91-44-2811-2000-16 91-44-2811-2020\n\nCommunications\n\nInternet Last Updated: 6/17/2004 2:33 AM\n\nIn India, it is becoming increasingly common to have access at home to the World Wide Web. The numerous Internet Service Providers (ISPs) throughout the country provide varying levels and quality of service at different costs. ISP pricing differences to the customer are complex, involving differing costs for installation, phone line usage, and ISP hourly fees. ISPs advertise 256K connectivity, but the actual throughput is often considerably slower. India currently offers customers four types of Internet connectivity:\n\nTCP/IP Dial-upthe most common, but relatively cheap and slow DSL (ADSL)limited use in New Delhi, expensive, 24/7 connectivity, slow to intermediate speed, some computer/router conflicts ISDN Dial-upless common, relatively expensive, but offers the fastest connectivity Cablequality and cost are reasonable. Wireless is becoming more available and is already at the five-star hotels.\n\nNo matter which ISP or method of connectivity the customer chooses, all ISP international links transit through VSNL (the national telephone company), causing a bottleneck at the international link between India and the rest of the world. At times, download speeds can be frustrating and logon, impossible. A few visionaries have applied for their own international segments in order to bypass the national telephone company completely.\n\nFor computer equipment, a UPS unit with 50/60 cycles along with a transformer is recommended. With OpenNet Plus, employees have internet on their desktop; this is often used after hours and on weekends.\n\nCommunications\n\nMail and Pouch Last Updated: 7/5/2005 6:09 AM\n\nNo APO or FPO facility is available in India. The most reliable mail service is the Department of State pouch. The Embassy mailroom operations are not a part of the United States Postal System or any other commercial courier service (e.g., DHL, FedEx, UPS, etc). The vast number of rules and regulations generated by the USG, Department of State, Government of India and other regulatory bodies turns the process of importing duty free merchandise from the United States into India into a complex operation. We cannot over emphasize the importance of following these regulations, as failure to do so could result in the loss of property and/or privileges.\n\nPOUCH / MAIL REMINDERS RESTRICTIONS! Reminder about pouch/mail size and weight restrictions via the 20189 zip code. They are able to accept packages up to 17x18x32 inches in size and up to 50 lbs in weight through the 20189 personal zip code.\n\nThe following are some of the most frequently asked questions regarding the Diplomatic Pouch.\n\nQUESTION: Are there different addresses for official/office personal mail/packages versus official correspondence?\n\nANSWER: Please ensure official, office correspondence/mail from the USA is either addressed to the office (generic) or to specific American staff members. Official mail should always be addressed:\n\nDepartment of State American Embassy New Delhi American Employee Name Section/Agency Name 9000 New Delhi Place 9000 New Delhi Place Washington DC 20521-9000 Washington DC 20521-9000\n\nPersonal mail/packages should always be addressed thus:\n\nAmerican Employee Name 9000 New Delhi Place Dulles, VA 20189-9000\n\nAmerican Employee Name 6240 Mumbai Place Dulles, VA 20189-6240\n\nAmerican Employee Name 6250 Calcutta Place Dulles, VA 20189-6250\n\nAmerican Employee Name 6260 Chennai Place Dulles, VA 20189-6260\n\nQUESTION: Is there an international mail address? ANSWER: The local addresses of the U.S. Embassy and Consulates General may be given to international and Indian correspondents. In general, it is better to use the Embassy address than your home address.\n\nName American Embassy Shantipath, Chanakyapuri New Delhi 110 021 India\n\nName American Consulate General Lincoln House, 78 Bhulabhai Desai Road Mumbai 400 026 India\n\nName American Consulate General 5/1 Ho Chi Minh Sarani Calcutta 700 071 India\n\nName American Consulate General 220 Annasali Chennai 600 006 India\n\nQUESTION: Are there any restrictions on what can be sent to the USA through the Diplomatic Pouch?\n\nANSWER: Authorized personnel may send personal letter mail as well as audio or videocassettes weighing no more than two pounds per shipment. The cassette shipments must be clearly marked as \"USED AUDIO TAPES\" or USED VIDEO CASSETTES.\" Authorized personnel may also return packages with broken, damaged, or incorrect items to retailers. Any other personal mail, even packages under two pounds (e.g., local purchases - shawls are a favorite, etc.) that do not contain documents will be refused by the Mailroom. These packages must be sent by other means (e.g. ACSAs Homeward Bound Mail Service). (5 FAH-10 H-541.1-1) Ship all personal packages - even small ones - via ACSA.\n\nQUESTION: What if packages/boxes are broken or damaged?\n\nANSWER: The USG does not accept responsibility (5FAM 341) for parcels lost or damaged while being transported in the diplomatic pouch. The DPM does permit you to mail back such packages by returning them to the sender.\n\nQUESTION: Does there have to be a return address on outgoing mail?\n\nANSWER: Yes, please ensure that ALL outgoing mail has a proper return address. State Department regulations require that outgoing mail without a return address be held in the Mailroom. An email will be sent requesting identification of mail not having a return address. If the mail has not been identified within three weeks then the Pouch Control Officer will open the mail and take appropriate action. Also, please ensure your outgoing mail has clear, correct addressing.\n\nQUESTION: Are there any restrictions on what can be sent to American Employees through the Diplomatic Pouch?\n\nANSWER: Personal pouch mail for authorized employees is limited to parcels that do not exceed 17x18x32 and must not weigh more than 50 pounds. In addition the following restrictions apply:\n\n1. Pouches may not contain items that are illegal to import into the receiving country, export from the sending country, or items that are classified as hazardous.\n\n2. The following items are among a long list of items prohibited for pouch dispatch: aerosols; glass containers; liquids, other than medically related; any items for resale; bulk supplies; magnetic materials, such as powerful magnets that can damage computer software and other electrical equipment; and incendiary materials such as road flares, cigarette lighters, self starting charcoal, etc.\n\nPlease check 5 FAH-10 H-531 or the DPM for the full list.\n\nQUESTION: Are there any alternatives to the Diplomatic Pouch?\n\nANSWER: Currently there are four options at US Embassy New Delhi. Please contact the consulates directly for their options.\n\n1. The American Community Support Association (ACSA) provides express courier services via DHL. The current rate (subject to change based on fuel charges) is as follows: Documents cost 809 Rps/KG + 18.2% taxes + service charges (roughly 957 Rps/kg). Non-Documents cost 1107 Rps/KG + 18.2% taxes + service charges (roughly 1309 Rps/kg).\n\n2. For packages, ACSA offers two levels of Homeward Bound Mailing Service - EXPRESS (a pouch is made up immediately for the package - 350 Rps/kg + postage) and lower cost REGULAR (waits until there are 100Kgs of outgoing material - 250 Rps/kg + postage). We recommend strongly that you get Christmas packages mailed out before the third week in November - earlier if using the slower, bulk rate.\n\n3. Indian postal service is inexpensive, but people have had varying results. It is best, however, to send such items as checks, securities, audiotapes, and video cassettes through the State Department pouch.\n\n4. Many Embassy employees volunteer to carry first class letter mail back to the United States and are given letters that, upon their arrival, are dropped immediately into the USPS. This Pony Express program is coordinated by the Management OMS.\n\nQUESTION: Can I ship consumables or supplemental HHE in the pouch? ANSWER: The pouch may not be used to supplement HHE shipments or to ship case lots of consumables. The extra consumables allotment for employees assigned to Mumbai, Calcutta, and Chennai must be shipped in their HHE or air shipment.\n\nCommunications\n\nRadio and TV Last Updated: 7/5/2005 6:13 AM\n\nThere is a considerable variety of official television entertainment available for local broadcasters and by cable. Dozens of channels may be accessedincluding Discovery, National Geographic, All India Radio (AIR) broadcasts in various Indian languages, Western music, and programs such as CNN and FOX in English. A good shortwave radio is necessary to receive Voice of America (VOA) and British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).\n\nDoordarshan, the local government-run TV, telecasts in color on the PAL system. One or two channels can be seen in major cities. Classical Indian music, melodramatic Hindi movies/serials, political debates, and educational instruction are interspersed with cricket matches, edited coverage of Parliament, and old English-language movies.\n\nPerhaps more important to Mission employees is the wide variety of cable programsincluding CNN, BBC, MTV, sports, movies, and entertainment in English, German, Spanish, French, and several Asian languages. Availability and hookup costs vary from neighborhood to neighborhood. All costs related to cable television subscription are personal expenses that must be borne by the individual. Information about cable services and cost, and assistance in providing them, is offered by ACSA in New Delhi.\n\nThe ACSA Video Club, located in New Delhi, services the Consulates General with videos in the NTSC system. Indian video clubs carry videos in the PAL system. Employees who bring only the NTSC TV and VCR will be limited to the ACSA videos or videos sent from home. Bringing a multisystem and dual voltage TV and VCR will allow use of Indian and cable television and both types of video tapes. A voltage-stabilizing unit is recommended to protect expensive electronic items. A surge protector/constant voltage supply unit can be bought locally in New Delhi for approximately $175, but the quality is variable. Another handy item to ship is a cleaning tape to clean the VCR heads.\n\nIn 2005, the cost of purchasing a good color multisystem 25-inch television in India was about $600. Multisystem TVs and other electronic appliances can be purchased locally at prices comparable to the US.\n\nCommunications\n\nNewspapers, Magazines, and Technical Journals Last Updated: 6/29/2004 5:28 AM\n\nIndia has wonderful bookstores with much to read in English. Such nationally circulated English-language dailies as The Times of India, The Indian Express, The Hindustan Times, and The Hindu are delivered to home or office. The International Herald Tribune, the Asian Wall Street Journal, and USA Today, all printed in Singapore, are available one day after publication. Such foreign newspapers and magazines as the Asian editions of Time and Newsweek, as well as The Far Eastern Economic Review are available within a few days of publication. India Today, Business India, Delhi Diary (tourism), First City, Femina, and many other magazines are of high quality and address a variety of subjects.\n\nRecently published fiction and nonfiction books are sold in local bookstores, especially mysteries, science fiction, current bestsellers, and books on India by American, British, and Indian authors. Locally published paperbacks are inexpensive; imported ones tend to cost less than in the U.S. Hardcover books are often much less expensive than abroad. Employees may wish to join a book club by mail. The American Women's Association in New Delhi has an excellent lending library located on the housing compound near the Embassy.\n\nHealth and Medicine\n\nMedical Facilities Last Updated: 2/10/2005 4:57 AM\n\nQualified English-speaking specialists, many trained in the U.S. and/or Europe are available in India for consultation and patient care. Each post maintains a list of qualified health care providers. The Health Unit can arrange referrals, if indicated or requested, with local physicians and dentists. Bills from these private physicians and dentists (including lab bills, X-rays, physical therapy, MRIs, etc.) must be paid in full at the time that the services are rendered. U.S. health insurance is not accepted in India. However, if you submit your paid receipts to your U.S. health insurance company, they are often reimbursed and/or applied to your deductible. The Health Unit can also assist in making dental and medical appointments in the U.S., Europe, Bangkok, and Singapore during home leave, R&R, or other travel.\n\nRoutine prenatal care is available, but all pregnant women are strongly encouraged to return to the U.S. to deliver their children. Basic dental services as well as orthodontics (braces) are available in India and are less expensive than in the U.S. Dental services in Calcutta are somewhat limited. Root canals, crown, bridgework, and orthodontic care in New Delhi are of high quality and inexpensive. High-quality, low-cost optical services are available throughout India.\n\nThe Embassy Health Unit in New Delhi is spacious, modern, and well equipped. The staff includes two regional medical officers (RMOs), a regional psychiatrist (RMO-P), a nurse practitioner (FSHP), a registered nurse (RN), and a regional medical technologist (RMT). The regional officers cover other posts in Asia and are in New Delhi when they are not traveling.\n\nThe Health Unit provides evaluation and treatment for routine illnesses and injuries, periodic physical examinations, Pap smears, immunizations, family planning counseling, blood pressure screening, crisis intervention counseling, and consultation on health-related matters. The Unit has an excellent clinical laboratory.\n\nNewcomers to post receive an Orientation Health Briefing and a Health and Medical Information Booklet. Please take immunization records, medical clearance forms, health insurance information, and medical records/charts when you visit the Health Unit for the first time.\n\nThe Health Unit at the American Embassy in New Delhi has a well-stocked pharmacy with a full-time FSN registered pharmacist responsible for managing and operating the pharmacy under the direct supervision of the RMO. The pharmacist packages and dispenses medications prescribed by the RMO, FSHP, and local consulting physicians. Immunizations, malaria prophylaxis and treatment, fluoride supplements for children, and medications for such \"India-related\" illnesses as malaria, intestinal parasites, dysentery, and tuberculosis are currently provided cost free. All other medications are charged to the individual patient's \"ACSA\" account. Medications are stocked in the pharmacy based on the standard formulary prepared by the RMO and FSHP; the pharmacist procures them from both overseas and local vendors. Many of the prescription/OTC medications manufactured by U.S. and other multinational pharmaceutical companies are available locally in New Delhi at a cost far less than in the U.S. The pharmacist assists patients in procuring these medications locally. He also helps patients in procuring items that are neither in the Health Unit formulary nor available locally from pharmacies in the U.S.\n\nThe pharmacy at Embassy New Delhi also provides pharmaceutical support services to some of the regional posts in Asia and central Asia. Embassy Health Unit personnel provide an adequate supply of acute care medications, immunizations, malaria prophylaxis, and fluoride supplements for employees and their families posted in the Consulates General at Mumbai, Calcutta, and Chennai. These medications and supplies are stocked at the small health clinics in the individual Consulates General. Medications and supplies that are not stocked in these small clinics are sent to the individual patients via the Diplomatic pouch/traveler from the Embassy Health Unit at New Delhi.\n\nMumbai. Mumbai has a small Health Unit (HU) located in the Consulate compound. A local physician holds office hours there on a regular basis and is available by telephone at other times. The New Delhi regional medical officers also pay visits to Mumbai approximately four times a year. Local dental care is good and orthodontia is available. Employees traveling to Mumbai via New Delhi should stop by the Medical Unit in New Delhi for a briefing and updating of shots if possible. Vaccines and/or medications are sent to Mumbai periodically from New Delhi. Any ongoing prescription needs should be addressed with the RMO.\n\nCalcutta. Located on the top floor of the Consulate General, the Health Unit is where the local post medical advisor comes to see patients for two hours weekly. Medications and vaccines are not stocked to any great extent; rather, they are sent from New Delhi as needed. The regional medical officers will visit 2-3 times per year. Dental care and eyeglasses are available in Calcutta, but officers are advised to have specialized dental work done in the U.S. if possible.\n\nCalcutta's humidity and pollution have a drying effect on hair and contribute to a variety of skin rashes.\n\nChennai. The Health Unit (HU) in Chennai is located on the ground floor of the Consulate. It is staffed by a nurse and a local physician who see patients there on a scheduled basis. The New Delhi medical officers visit Chennai regionally approximately four times a year.\n\n(See Customs, Duties, and Passage for information on care of pets.)\n\nHealth and Medicine\n\nCommunity Health Last Updated: 2/10/2005 4:58 AM\n\nIn most of India, public sanitation falls far below Western standards. Open sewers abound. Insect control programs have been underfunded. Tap water is considered unsafe throughout India, and adequacy of water fluoridation varies with locality and other factors. Fresh produce is considered contaminated and should be treated. Regulation of food handling and preparation in restaurants is not subject to the strict health codes that are enforced in the West. Intestinal parasites, bacterial dysentery, malaria, hepatitis, dengue fever, meningitis, Japanese B Encephalitis, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and rabies are health concerns. Automobile accidents can be catastrophic due to inadequacies in the Emergency Medical Response System. AIDS is a growing health problem. Air pollution is a significant problem in India's larger urban cities, especially New Delhi and Calcutta.\n\nHealth and Medicine\n\nPreventive Measures Last Updated: 7/5/2005 4:57 AM\n\nAdjusting to a new living and work situation, a new school system, and a tropical environment creates stresses as well as rewards. Culture shock can cause insomnia, headaches, irritability, and a variety of other symptoms. A program of proper rest, exercise, and nutrition, coupled with advice from the Health Unit staff, can be very helpful in managing these conditions and in making your overseas tour an enjoyable one.\n\nRespiratory illnesses and allergies are common due to dust and heavy pollution and these conditions can aggravate respiratory ailments and allergies. Adults or children prone to these illnesses may want to consult with a physician before considering this assignment.\n\nCaution must be exercised concerning food and water. Commercially bottled beverages such as beer, soft drinks, and mineral water can be considered safe. Otherwise, water must be made safe for drinking by boiling, distilling, or adding chemicals. Water at the U.S. Embassyincluding the housing enclave and in the American Embassy Schoolis safe. Commercially bottled mineral water is available at the commissary, at restaurants, and on the local market.\n\nChicken, beef, and pork should be well cooked. Fish should be cooked rather than eaten raw. All fruits and vegetables that are eaten raw must be thoroughly cleaned and soaked for 15 minutes in disinfectant solution.\n\nMalaria is endemic in India, and chloroquine-resistant malaria can be found in New Delhi and other urban centers. All personnel are advised to use an appropriate drug regimen and personal protection measures to prevent malaria. Employees may begin malaria prophylaxis before arrival in India. Information about malaria risk is available via fax from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control, in Atlanta): call the toll-free number (1-888-232-3299) and follow the instructions given. U.S. Government personnel assigned to India may contact the State Department Immunization Clinic at (202) 663-1705.\n\nTuberculosis is still a common problem in India. Children and adults should have TB skin testing done per the recommendations of the Health Unit staff.\n\nAIDS is a health risk in India. Use of condoms and avoidance of high-risk behaviors are encouraged. Specific information may be obtained by calling (800) 342-AIDS.\n\nImmunizations. Up-to-date immunizations are a must for life in the Foreign Service. Routine childhood immunizations should be up to date, including Diphtheria, Pertussis and Tetanus (DPT); Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR); Polio (either OPV or IPV), and Hemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Hib). In addition, the following immunizations are recommended:\n\nHepatitis A and typhoid vaccinations are recommended for employees and dependents traveling to India. Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for all employees and dependents posted to India. It is not recommended for employees on short-term (less than 60 days) temporary duty, unless they fall into a high-risk group. Preexposure rabies vaccine is strongly recommended for persons posted to India. Japanese B encephalitis (JBE) vaccine is recommended for personnel assigned to India who will be traveling frequently and/or visiting farms as part of their duties. Rabies is a viral illness spread via contact with the saliva, usually from a bite, of an infected animal, mostly dogs, but monkeys, cats, bats, raccoons, and other mammals can also carry the disease. Rats, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, and other such ruminants do not carry the disease. Rabies is common throughout India, including New Delhi, and causes an estimated 30,000 (!) deaths yearly. The symptoms of rabies usually develop within a few weeks of the animal contact. Once symptoms develop, this disease is always fatal. To prevent this fatal disease,\n\nMAKE SURE THAT YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN HAVE COMPLETED THE THREE-DOSE PREVENTATIVE SERIES OF RABIES IMMUNIZATIONS. Avoid contact with stray or wild animals, especially those exhibiting unusual behavior, foaming at the mouth, or attempting unprovoked attacks. Do not let your children have contact with stray animals or monkeys. Make sure your pets rabies immunizations are current. Take appropriate precautions when undertaking activities which might increase your chances of a dog bite such as running, walking through villages at night, or making loud noises or threatening gestures when stray dogs are nearby. Dengue fever, a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes, is present throughout India. No specific treatment and no vaccines are available. Employees should try to avoid mosquito bites.\n\nThose arriving in India from Africa should have a valid Yellow Fever vaccination. The WHO-approved facility at Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi can give this vaccination to those who need it.\n\nLast, but perhaps most important, while driving or riding in an automobile in India, buckle the seatbelt.\n\nEmployment for Spouses and Dependents Last Updated: 11/5/2004 6:49 AM\n\nThe U.S. Department of State is committed to assisting eligible family members obtain meaningful employment while posted abroad. A limited number of positions are available at the embassy and there are also opportunities to work on the local economy.\n\nJobs on the Local Economy\n\nWith the signing of the reciprocal Bilateral Agreement between the United States and the Government of India, any eligible family member who receives a job offer from an Indian company or organization can usually obtain the required work permit. In order to assist those desirous of working on the local economy as an employee or as a self-employed worker, The American Embassy operates a Strategic Networking Assistance Program (SNAP) that is managed by a Local Employment Advisor (LEA). Contact SNAP through the Human Resources Office to obtain the assistance of the LEA and for help in processing work permits from the Government of India.\n\nJobs in the U.S. Mission\n\nThere are several opportunities for individuals to work in the U.S. Mission.\n\nAdult U.S. citizen dependents of direct-hire U.S. Government employees can find part-time, intermittent or temporary appointment, FMA and Personal Services Agreement PSA-Plus positions in the U.S. Mission. Both full-time and on-call PSA-Plus jobs are also available.\n\nAlthough it is hard to predict which positions will become available, the following jobs have been advertised by Human Resources Office to American Family Members: Community Liaison Office coordinators, Residential Security Coordinator, Secretaries, Logistic Clerk, Nurses, Consular Assistants, Consular Associates, Courier Escorts, Security Assistant, Program Assistant, Science Program Coordinator, Reader/Assistant, Administrative Assistants, FMO Make-Ready Coordinators, Refugee Processing Assistant, and GSO Assistants. An applicant may be asked to take typing and/or any other appropriate tests.\n\nAll sensitive jobs need a security clearance. Dependents of direct-hire employees working under the Chief of Mission are generally eligible for secret or top secret clearances. The American Embassy School hires teachers and teacher's aides. In 2004, four American family members were employed at the American Embassy School.\n\nDependents should bring completed copies of the DS-1950, SF-171, or résumés along with copies of the SF-52 (Personnel Actions, if prior government employee) Forms with copies of security clearance cables with them to post. All dependents are encouraged to maintain their own personal files of all employment documents (vacancy notices, application forms, resumes, performance appraisals, and contracts). Applicable U.S. income tax and FICA contributions will be withheld by the employing agency.\n\nIf funds are available, the Embassy runs a summer-hire program for teenage dependents of Mission employees. Jobs vary from clerical support covering vacation schedules, to helping GSO process the summer turnover, and doing special projects at USAID.\n\nAmerican Embassy - New Delhi\n\nPost City Last Updated: 7/13/2005 1:24 AM\n\nNew Delhi is located in north-central India beside the old city of Delhi on the Yamuna River. The capital of modern-day India traces its roots to King George V's triumphant tour of India in 1911. While encamped on the outskirts of Delhi, the King announced that the capital of British India would be shifted from Calcutta to a new city to be built beside the ancient city of Delhi.\n\nOlder residential areas feature broad, tree-lined streets and large bungalows with spacious yards. Houses in newer residential areas are more modern, but yard space is often at a premium and streets are congested with a variety of conveyances. The commercial heart of New Delhi is Connaught Place, where state emporia sell local crafts. Jan Path and the nearby Cottage Emporium, famous as the capital's souvenir center, has everything from cheap curios to exquisite pieces of art. Luxurious five-star hotels have good restaurants and shopping malls. An occasional cow meanders down avenues, reminding visitors that this is India.\n\nThe old city of Delhi is a vivid contrast to the spacious orderliness of New Delhi. Jama Masjid and the majestic Red Fort lie amid narrow, crooked streets teeming with humanity, vehicles and produce. Chandni Chowk in the heart of Delhi is jammed with shoppers, vendors, conveyances, temples, mosques, and small shops selling everything from spices to expensive jewelry. Qutab Minar, a 13th-century minaret more than 240 feet high, stands amid ruins outside the city limits. New Delhi is filled with massive forts, palaces, and grand tombs built over the centuries by Delhi's various rulers.\n\n(For information on automobiles at post, see the Transportation Section in addition to the Customs and Duties under Notes for Travelers. For health information, see Health and Medicine and Passage under Notes for Travelers.)\n\nSecurity Last Updated: 8/30/2005 4:49 AM\n\nSECURITY\n\nTHREAT ISSUES: The security situation is generally safe for all American personnel, except for travel to Jammu and Kashmir. New Delhi is a HIGH crime threat post primarily due to extensive low-level, non-confrontational criminal activity such as pick-pocketing and consumer fraud. Violent crime is on the rise.\n\nANTI-U.S. DEMONSTRATIONS AND TERRORISM: Demonstrations protesting U.S. policy in South Asia and the Middle East occur occasionally but are generally peaceful. Demonstrators are kept approximately one mile from the Embassy compound. Groups intending to demonstrate against the Embassy are required to apply for a permit 48 hours in advance. However, spontaneous demonstrations do occur and visitors are advised to be alert while traveling in the city to avoid becoming involved in such events.\n\nTerrorists can pose a threat in India. While there is no evidence that Americans are specifically targets, visiting Americans in some parts of India are at risk from bombings, mob violence, police/civilian confrontations and mentally unbalanced individuals supporting political causes. Risk to Americans from random bombings depends largely on their being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Be attentive to local events as reported in the English language media.\n\nCRIME: In general, crime is on the rise in New Delhi. There is no specific criminal threat to Americans in India. Criminals have rarely targeted American tourists or diplomatic personnel. Visitors to India should always be aware of their surroundings. Petty street crimes such as theft, pick-pocketing, purse snatching and scams are common. Train stations are notorious for pickpocketing and thefts of baggage. Travelers by train should hold on to their luggage until the train has left the station. Travelers by plane should check the contents of their carry-on luggage carefully. Travelers staying at hotels should leave their valuables with the Front Desk Manager or use the safes when provided in hotel rooms. Minor physical contact can occur, primarily in the form of Eve-teasing, a local term encompassing all forms of harassment of women.\n\nFollowing the terrorist attacks of September 11, and the more recent incidents in India, security has been significantly enhanced in the Diplomatic Enclave, particularly around the U.S. Mission's three compounds in New Delhi.\n\nUSE, STORAGE AND PROCUREMENT OF PORTABLE COMPUTER EQUIPMENT IN OFFICE SPACES\n\nThe below policy covers the use, storage, and procurement of portable computer equipment and applies to all personnel under COM authority.\n\nDEFINITIONS:\n\n1. Portable computer equipment includes laptops, personal digital assistants (PDA), or other devices that are capable of creating, storing, and processing data (e.g., MP3 players).\n\n2. Travelers are defined as any USG employee or family member, including non-State personnel, on temporary duty (TDY) for 30-days or less.\n\n3. The current Information Systems Security Officers (ISSOs) are as follows:\n\n- UNCLASSIFIED Systems ISSO: Sherril Pavin, ISO - UNCLASSIFIED Systems alternate ISSO: Matthew Wolsey, A/RSO-I - CLASSIFIED Systems ISSO: Neeru Lal, IPS - CLASSIFIED Systems alternate ISSO: Robert Hall, IPO\n\nPOLICY:\n\nConnection: Department of State policy prohibits the connection of official, portable computers to OpenNet or ClassNet without the explicit approval of the post ISSO (12 FAM 625) or Department policy (e.g., SWEET PDAs). Personally owned computers may not be connected to OpenNet or ClassNet under any circumstances.\n\nCAA Spaces: Personally owned computers may not be used within USG Controlled Access Areas (CAA)(12 FAM 625). Unclassified government owned portable computers intended for use any place within overseas facilities, and particularly within the CAA, cannot be taken in and out of the CAA, unless specifically authorized by the RSO. Exceptions are unclassified official (SWEET) PDAs that are specifically designated for CAA use. Classified portable computers must remain within the CAA at all times.\n\nTDY - Travelers and Portable Computers within the CAA: Official travelers on temporary duty, including non-State personnel, must coordinate the transport of official unclassified portable computers that will be used within USG controlled access facilities with the RSO and ISSO. A country clearance request cable containing a statement to this effect will meet the requirement.\n\nUnclassified portable computers intended for use within the CAA on a long-term basis (over 30 days), must be shipped via professional or non-pro Diplomatic courier (classified pouch).\n\nAn official traveler can personally transport a USG portable computer intended for use within the CAA to post only under the following conditions:\n\n· The official traveler must have at least a secret level security clearance; · The official traveler will be on temporary duty at the Embassy or Consulate for a period not to exceed 30 days; · The portable computer must have been transported under the continuous personal control of the official traveler; · Under no circumstances may the computer have been left unattended outside of the CAA or in a public area, nor should it be checked in as luggage on public transport; and · All \"wireless\" and audio features on the portable computer must be disabled or de-installed, to include infrared ports and sound card, before entering the CAA, regardless of mode of transport.\n\nSWEET PDAs: Certain personal digital assistants (PDAs - e.g., FS1935 HP iPAQ) have been approved for direct connection to DoS OpenNet-Plus networks overseas, for synchronization of e-mail, calendar, contacts, tasks, and documents. Connectivity is authorized if the equipment is USG owned, meets DS security guidelines and the SWEET (Secure Wireless Extended Enterprise Technology) software is installed. Currently, wireless connectivity is not/not authorized. The PDA may not be connected to any non-DoS systems (e.g., home computer). The expansion slots will be encrypted and are not to be used for audio or video recording or still photography. Please contact the ISO for additional information regarding this program.\n\nGeneral: Ensure all equipment and media are properly labeled with the highest level of information that may be processed on each system. For additional details, see Staff Notice 05-014 Guidelines On Use Of Removable Computer Storage Media. Users are responsible for protecting the equipment assigned to them to prevent loss or unauthorized access as well as preventing possible tampering of the device. Report any loss or suspected tampering of computers to the RSO and ISSO.\n\nThe Post and Its Administration Last Updated: 8/30/2005 4:56 AM\n\nSixteen agencies are represented at the American Embassy in New Delhi, including the Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Defense (the Defense Attaché's Office and the Office of Defense Cooperation), the Department of Agriculture (Foreign Agriculture Service), FBI/Legat, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Department of Homeland Security (CBP and ICE), Foreign Commercial Service (FCS), Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the Library of Congress (LOC). Engineering Services (ESC), Office of Building Operations (OBO) and RIMC also have offices in New Delhi.\n\nThe American Embassy is located in the diplomatic enclave of Chanakyapuri, about 30 minutes from Indira Gandhi domestic and international airports. The U.S. Embassy and Roosevelt House (the Ambassador's Residence) were designed by American architect Edward Durell Stone, designer of the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Ambassador and most senior officers have offices in the Embassy (Chancery and Annex). FCS, the American Information Resource Center (AIRC), FBIS, and LOC are located at the American Center in the downtown business district of New Delhi, a 20 minute drive away. Limited shuttle service is available between the American Center and the Chancery. Contact GSO for operating hours.\n\nEmbassy operating hours are 8:30 am to 5:30 pm, Monday through Friday. The Embassy switchboard (telephone number 91-11-2419-8000) functions around the clock. Marine Guards, who are on duty at the Embassy 24 hours a day, can help employees contact the Duty Officer in case of emergency.\n\nOnce travel plans are made, new employees should notify their agency of arrival times and flights so that housing can be reserved, sponsors assigned, and arrangements made for airport pickup. Newcomers are met upon arrival and provided transportation and a Welcome Kit. If newcomers are not met, they should telephone the Embassy for assistance. The switchboard operator or the Marine Guard will notify the appropriate official.\n\nBecause most new employees arrive in the middle of the night after a long airplane ride from the other side of the world, it may take a few days to a few weeks to get over jetlag. New employees should contact their agencies for in-processing. HR provides a detailed check-in sheet to all State employees.\n\nThe Embassy Cashier, located in the lobby of the West Building, receives and distributes rupees (shuttle fees, long-distance telephone and fax fees), and issues salary checks for local hire employees. A branch of the Bank of America is also available to employees in the lobby of the Annex. Both facilities are open from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM Monday through Friday, but are closed on Embassy holidays and select Indian holidays. In addition, the Bank of America is open Friday from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM and on Saturday from 10 AM to noon. At Bank of America you can exchange dollars for rupees, cash dollar checks for rupees, make wire transfers to dollar accounts and cash travelers cheques. American employees and their familie members are not required to have a Bank of America account to use these services. Bring plenty of checks with you as credit cards are not readily accepted in India.\n\nNewcomers will want to spend time at the Community Liaison Office, x8754, learning about life at post.\n\nHousing\n\nTemporary Quarters Last Updated: 8/30/2005 4:57 AM\n\nEmployees and their families are normally moved directly into their permanent quarters. If this is not possible, employees and their families may be temporarily assigned to U.S. Government-leased or -owned housing. There is no staff house in New Delhi. If no temporary quarters are available, employees will be housed in nearby hotels within the per diem allowances.\n\nHousing\n\nPermanent Housing Last Updated: 8/30/2005 5:00 AM\n\nEmbassy residences are located in various parts of New Delhi, all within about ten miles of the Chancery. The Enclave, located on the Embassy compound, features 54 American-style apartments with two, three or four bedrooms. Nearby are the ACSA commissary, restaurant, bar, snack bar, swimming pool, ballfield, bowling alley, clay tennis courts, as well as the Embassy.\n\nLeased accommodations consist of independent houses or apartments. The ground floor apartment normally has use of the yard or garden; the upper floor apartment has use of the \"barsati\" (an extra room on the roof). If there is a garage, it may be assigned to the first family to occupy quarters.\n\nGSO's Housing Section issues a handbook which explains the ins and outs of living in a Government-leased or -owned home in New Delhi.\n\nHousing\n\nFurnishings Last Updated: 8/30/2005 5:02 AM\n\nNew Delhi is considered a furnished post; therefore, only a limited shipment of HHE is authorized. Each house or apartment is equipped with Government-owned furniture (including a normal complement of living room, dining room, and bedroom furniture), carpeting, vacuum cleaner, water distillers, ironing board, lamps and/or ceiling light fittings, stove, refrigerator, air cleaners, washer, dryer, freezer, air-conditioner/heating units, transformers, water distiller, smoke detectors, and mirrors. All agencies provide an allowance for recovering furniture and the purchasing draperies and/or curtains.\n\nStereo/TV stands or cabinetry, computer furniture and small household appliances are not provided. Most agencies provide microwave ovens (please check with your sponsoring agency). Bring china, glassware, silverware, baking and serving dishes, kitchen utensils, queen- and twin-size bed linens and blankets. Layettes/baby cribs are in short supply at Post and are issued for use only until the new arrivals' UAB is received. Employees anticipating the need for a baby crib should ship one in the UAB.\n\nNew arrivals will receive a Hospitality Kit from the GSO Property Office that includes sets of four dishes, water glasses, table and kitchen utensils, sheets, blankets, pillows, pillowcases, and towels, as well as a toaster, iron, and coffee maker. The ironing board, vacuum cleaner, and water distiller which arrive with the Hospitality Kit are to remain with the household. The Hospitality Kit must be returned when your HHE arrives.\n\nImportant note: Importation of duplicate electronic items are prohibited by the GOI. Any employee who imports more than one of the same-type of electronic item, may be required by the GOI to either re-export it, or pay all necessary Customs Duties. This may delay the clearance process; therefore, post recommends that employees do not import duplicate electronic items. Please note that New Delhi is a fully furnished post, and all major appliances such as washers, dryers, refrigerators, freezers, microwave ovens, air filters/cleaners and water distillers are provided by the post, and therefore should not be included in the shipments. If these items are found on the packing list, they will either be subjected to export or payment of customs duty, the costs of which must be borne by the employee. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that these items should not/not be included in your shipments.\n\nHousing\n\nUtilities and Equipment Last Updated: 8/30/2005 5:04 AM\n\nNew Delhi's electric voltage is 220v, 50 cycles, AC. American 120v, 60-cycle electrical appliances require stepdown transformers, a limited number of which are supplied to residences. Government-owned quarters have 110v outlets but are still 50 cycles. Some appliances also require cycle adjustment.\n\nPlugs on American-made transformers and 220v appliances can be changed to the Indian-type plugs locally at little cost, or, you can purchase adapter plugs from local electric shops to save the wear and tear on personal property. It is occasionally difficult to insert the wide prong of U.S. plugs into Indian-made stepdown transformers.\n\nBefore departing the U.S., you can adapt stereos and tape recorders for 50-cycle operation. Check warranties on other 60-cycle motor-driven equipment to determine advisability of use on 50-cycle current. Any item with a built-in timer will run slower. 120 volt electric clocks, clock radios, VCR clocks, breadmaking machines, telephone answering machines, and certain slide projectors may not function properly.\n\nIn New Delhi, the power situation is variable, especially during summer. Low voltage, power outages every now and then, and large fluctuations with dangerous spikes are very common. It is advisable to protect your electronic and expensive electrical items with voltage stabilizers, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) units, or spike protectors. The UPS provides the necessary protection for hard-disk drive computers. Voltage stabilizers, spike protectors, and plug adapters are available in India, but the quality is variable.\n\nIndian-made international brand 220v irons (usually without steam), small space heaters, air-conditioners, small refrigerators, washers, vacuum cleaners, mixers, and cookers are available.\n\nUseful electrical appliances to bring include a coffee maker, mixer, blender, small space heaters, hair dryers, toasters and steam irons. If your agency does not provide a microwave, most employees recommend that you bring one220v if possible. The ideal appliance is dual voltage and dual cycle (110v-220v, 50-60 cycles).\n\n(For information on the importation of electronic items, see Customs, Duties, and Passage.)\n\nAir-conditioning is necessary half the year, beginning in April. Heating is required in December and January. The Enclave quarters have electric ranges. Off-compound quarters use butane for the gas ranges.\n\nFood Last Updated: 8/30/2005 5:09 AM\n\nIn New Delhi, U.S. Mission employees are fortunate to have many Indian markets and the ACSA Co-op in which to shop. The Co-op, about the size of a very small chain grocery store, is open six days a week. Co-op use is limited to U.S. Government employees, USAID contractors with specific notation on Co-op use in their contracts, U.S.-hire employees of the American Embassy School and diplomatic staff of qualified third countries. Domestics may not shop at the Co-op. The refundable membership deposit is $100 per adult, $37.50 per child, up to a maximum of $300 per family.\n\nFull ACSA membership includes use of the Co-op, restaurant, video club, snack bar, bar, sports fields and equipment, pool, bowling alley and gym. (The snack and drink carts in the Embassy and the Indian cuisine canteen are open to all Embassy employees.)\n\nThe Co-op carries a variety of basics, including frozen foods, baby foods, dog/cat food and litter, toiletries, paper products, and ethnic ingredients. Meats often carried include frozen beef, fish, chicken, bacon, hotdogs, turkey, pork and leg of lamb. The Co-op stocks evaporated, long-life shelf (UHT) and powdered milk; cigarettes; soft drinks and alcoholic beverages; a variety of fresh dairy products from Australia, and frozen meats from Australia and U.S. A small, but expensive, shipment of head lettuce and celery comes from Australia. A limited supply of frozen U.S. bread, and bread and rolls baked at the ACSA restaurant is stocked. (See Supplies and Services for more information on the Co-op.)\n\nEvery neighborhood in New Delhi has at least one market that sells fresh fruit, vegetables, cut flowers, and dry goods (rice, sugar, lentils, and spices), oils, eggs, some canned or bottled items, milk, soft drinks, lotion, and shampoo. There are also chemists (pharmacies), bakeries, and sometimes a meat shop with chicken and/or mutton. The most popular grocery markets among foreigners are Modern Bazaar, Khan Market, and INA Market.\n\nFresh fruits and vegetables are seasonal and the selection may not be as large as in U.S. supermarkets. The winter season is best for price and variety. Potatoes, onions, tomatoes, carrots, limes, lemons, cucumbers, eggplant, at least one variety of squash, bananas, oranges or tangerines, apples (sometimes stored from the previous season), frozen peas, and coconuts are always available. Seasonal vegetables and fruits include peas, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, red and white radishes, kohlrabi, green peas, spinach, lettuce, string beans, parsley, varieties of squash, sweet potatoes, turnips, breadfruit, avocados, melons, many varieties of mangos, limes, pomegranates, tangerines, oranges, grapes, papaya, grapefruit, pineapple and occasionally small peaches, thin celery, and apricots. Dried fruits, cashews, walnuts, almonds, and pine nuts are also usually available in the market.\n\nMutton, goat, pork, and chicken are available in several cuts. Buffalo undercut can be used as beef in recipes. Fresh sea fish and shellfish are available, but should be eaten only in the cooler months. Baby food in the local market is limited to powdered milk in tins and an occasional box of cereal mixed with dried fruit.\n\nEmployees assigned to New Delhi get no extra weight allowance for consumable items. However, if you have space in your HHE shipment, consider sending special itemsdiet foods, baby formula and ingredients for special recipes. If more space is available in your HHE shipment, bring toilet paper, paper towel rolls, tissues and detergent because these items are expensive at the commissary.\n\nVegetable and flower gardens are popular in New Delhi. Take packets of your favorite vegetables, herbs, and flowers. (See Supplies and Services for more information on what to bring.)\n\nClothing Last Updated: 7/1/2004 7:46 AM\n\nIn general, adult Indians dress more conservatively than Americans. Men wear shirts and slacks, suits, bush or safari suits (the short or long-sleeved shirt is worn outside the same-color pants), or a kurta-pajama (long tunic over drawstring pants). At home, a man might wear an undershirt with lungi (3 yards of material tucked in at the waist).\n\nMost Indian women wear either a sari or a \"salwar kameez.\" A sari is a combination of six meters of often elaborately bordered silk, cotton, or polyester wrapped over a drawstring full-length petticoat and a form-fitting choli blouse that leaves the midriff exposed. The accepted national dress for women is the sari, which can be worn in a number of ways. The \"salwar kameez\" is a two-piece suit made of decorative knee-length tunic over drawstring pants, sometimes worn with a scarf (\"dupatta\").\n\nAlthough Indian women are not hesitant to show their mid-sectionsome even have open backsthey usually feel self-conscious in pants and a tucked-in blouse. Most would not wear shorts even in the privacy of their own homes. (See Special Information for more information on Indian sensitivities on dress.)\n\nNew Delhi's climate alternates between extremely hot summers, humid monsoons, and surprisingly chilly winters. Lightweight, loose yet covering cotton clothing is suitable for 8 months of the year. Sweaters, jackets, wool skirts, wool suits, sweatshirts, hats, scarves, and even gloves will be welcome in winter. Excursions to the north or to hill stations require warm clothing including heavy sweaters and coats. American-style underwear and sports socks are not available locally. Light raincoats or windbreakers may come in handy. Umbrellas are needed in the monsoon season. Hats, which are not readily available in India, are especially desirable for the summer season.\n\nWashable fabrics are the most convenient for maintenance, but drycleaning services are also available. Dry cleaning, however, is not up to Western standards, except in major hotels. Cotton, silk and wool are the most comfortable fabrics to wear. Quality woolen and knit fabrics are generally not available. India's distinctive cottons and silks, however, are among the bonuses of life here.\n\nLocal footwear consists mainly of sandals (\"chappals\"), which have straps over the instep and big toe. Ready-made shoes often lack quality, comfort and durabilityand they can be expensive. Cobblers repair shoes at little cost. Shoes wear out more quickly in this climate. Bring several pair of comfortable walking shoes, good work shoes, and sport shoes for recreation and exercise. If representational entertaining is part of the job, bring comfortable dress shoes for in-house, as well as on-the-grass functions to stand in for hours. Nike, Reebok, and Adidas are now all readily available in India but are slightly more expensive than in the U.S.\n\nMilitary. The normal duty dress for USDAO and DSA military members in the Embassy is civilian shirt and slacks or coat and tie (or equivalent for females), depending on the weather and occasion. Marine Guards work in their uniforms. Attaches must hand-carry uniforms for orientation briefings in Hawaii, military receptions, and official calls before their HHE arrive. (Contact the USDAO and ODC for more details.)\n\nClothing\n\nMen Last Updated: 6/29/2004 5:56 AM\n\nLightweight and wool suits or Western-style sport shirts and pants are worn to the office, as well as to after-hours functions. Lightweight suits are practical for most of the year, but warmer suits (wool) are needed in December and January. High-quality local silk ties are beautiful and inexpensive. Men occasionally wear locally tailored bush or safari suits for summer or winter wear. Local tailor-made shirts and suits vary greatly in quality and fit, and can be more expensive than ready-made. Most Americans prefer to bring tennis shorts, knit shirts, golf clothes, and swim trunks. Shorts for at-home wear can be tailored locally, but may cost more than U.S. readymade shorts. Men's sandals, available in many styles, are comfortable during the summer heat.\n\nClothing\n\nWomen Last Updated: 6/29/2004 5:56 AM\n\nCasual dresses, suits and pants are suitable for most daytime occasions. Dressier outfits are worn in the evenings to receptions, cocktails, and dinner parties. For formal occasions, which are infrequent, long dresses or sequined cocktail dresses are worn. Sequined clothes are comparatively inexpensive on the local market. Cotton dresses and cotton underwear are coolest in the hot weather. Women may want to bring panty hose as comparable panty hose are difficult to find on the local market, but it is acceptable to go without hose, particularly during the warm weather. Bring a swimsuit. Bathing caps are not required at any of the pools. Shorts and strapless tops are not worn on the public streets.\n\nClothing\n\nChildren Last Updated: 6/29/2004 6:03 AM\n\nAt the American Embassy School in New Delhi students dress casually. Both boys and girls wear jeans, slacks, shorts, T-shirts, shirts, light jackets, tennis shoes, sweatshirts and sweaters. Teenage girls also wear the salwar kameez and dresses on occasion.\n\nSweaters and warm jackets are worn daily in December and January. Warm clothing will be needed for the middle school and high school sport conventions held in neighboring countries, for school or family outings to the hill stations or up north, and for winter months. Light colors are cooler in hot weather, but dark colored clothes are practical for active childrenthe red soil is difficult to wash out.\n\nTake tennis shoes, required for physical education at the school, to postmore than one pair and in increasing sizes if the child is still growing. Sandals, worn by both girls and boys during summer, are widely available locally. Socks and tennis shoes wear out quickly.\n\nWhen planning a wardrobe, consider the growth of the child during the stay in New Delhi. Take Scout uniforms or have them tailored locally. Take bathing suits in current and larger sizes for growing children.\n\nTake baby clothing, shoes, and diapers. Cloth diapers are used by some families who hire laundrymen to wash clothes. The Co-op carries a variety of disposable diapers, but they are quite expensive.\n\nTeens can buy the latest fashions in jeans, sweaters, shirts and cotton skirts from sidewalk vendors or in upscale shops.\n\nClothing\n\nOffice Attire Last Updated: 7/5/2005 6:14 AM\n\nOffice attire for both men and women is the same as that worn during the summer months in Washington, DC. The Embassy has a tradition of more relaxed attire during the hot months between the holidays of Holi (March) and Diwali (November). The Ambassador expects that staff will be neatly attired at all times and in a manner that reflects the professionalism of our Mission, while taking into account the operational needs of each office. This is particularly important when meeting outside guests in the Ambassador's Office and making outside calls.\n\nSupplies and Services\n\nSupplies Last Updated: 6/29/2004 6:07 AM\n\nThe ACSA Co-op is a convenient outlet for U.S. products, but the cost is usually above U.S. prices. The Co-op stocks a limited supply of toiletries, cosmetics, feminine hygiene products, cigarettes and cigars, over-the-counter medication, some vitamins, detergents, liquid soaps, insect sprays, and cleaning fluid. Some pens, tape, notebooks, and tennis balls can also be found. During American holidays, special candy, decorations, and wrapping paper are usually available. Locally made surge protectors and light bulbs, small batteries, Kodak film, household cleaners, and car care items are sold in the Co-op. (See Transportation for a list of automobile parts to bring.)\n\nLocal Indian markets have shops selling books, jewelry, stationery, music tapes, ready-made Indian and Western clothing, bicycles, appliances, and materials (with resident tailors). Aida cloth, wool and acrylic yarn, embroidery floss, and other good quality inexpensive needle art supplies are readily available at local markets.\n\nRepairs to Government-owned and -leased housing are handled by the Embassy GSO Maintenance, but a small box of household tools may come in handy (hammer, screwdriver, wire clipper, small scissors, thread and needle, packet of small nails, tacks, electrical tape, tape measure, extension cords, wire). You may want to bring favorite cosmetics, toiletries, and feminine products. Take holiday decorations and an artificial tree if desired, hobby supplies, arts and crafts supplies, games and puzzles, and musical instruments. Useful gadgets to bring include openers (puncture-top, bottle cap, rotary can opener and corkscrews), oven thermometer, kitchen timer, good paring knives, and vegetable peelers.\n\nMail-order, duty-free catalogs, and department store catalogs are available at CLO.\n\nSupplies and Services\n\nBasic Services Last Updated: 6/29/2004 6:16 AM\n\nLocal dry-cleaning is available with varying results. Most clothes washing is done in the home. Shoe repair is available and inexpensive. Tailoring services vary in quality and price. Copying existing clothing achieves the best results, but, with varying results, tailors will work from pictures as well.\n\nA beauty shop and a barbershop are located on the enclave compound.
