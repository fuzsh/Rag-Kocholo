        "text": "Kipling spent much of his childhood and early working life in India, but in 1889 decided to return to his homeland, England. His journey was by way of the Far East and the Americas, and included a trip to Vancouver. The infant city of then 14,000 people was recovering from the devastation of the great fire three years earlier and the acquisition that Kipling made was - at that time - an out-of-town double lot on Fraser Street, Vancouver (then known as Scott Street).\n\nKipling chronicled his trip via a series of dispatches to the Civil and Military Gazette, an Indian newspaper for which he was a correspondent. Later published in his travelogue, From Sea to Sea and other Sketches, it is clear that Kipling bought the land ‘blind’, only visiting it a day or so later:\n\n“And I took it as easily as a man buys a piece of tobacco. Me voici, owner of some four hundred well-developed pines, a few thousand tons of granite scattered in blocks at the roots…and a sprinkling of earth. That’s a town lot in Vancouver. You or your agent hold it until property rises, then sell and buy more land further out of town and repeat the process. I do not quite see how this sort of thing helps the growth of the town, but the English boy [who sold it to him] says that is the ‘essence of speculation’ so it must be alright. But I wish there were fewer pines and less granite on my ground.”\n\nIt was whilst on his honeymoon, described in Letters of Travel that Kipling made his second, and from his recounting, even more problematic acquisition:\n\n“On our magic carpet which was to take us round the earth, beginning in Canada deep in snow…we came to Vancouver, where with an eye for the future and for proof of wealth we bought, or thought we had, twenty acres of a wilderness called North Vancouver, now part of the city. But there was a catch in the thing, as we found many years later when, after paying taxes on it for ever so long, we discovered it belonged to someone else. All the consolation we got from the smiling people of Vancouver was ‘You bought that from Steve, did you? Ah-ah, Steve! You hadn’t ought to ha’ bought from Steve. No! Not from Steve.’ And thus did, the good Steve cure us of speculating in real estate.”\n\nAs the underlying copy of the 1897 Voters List indicates, R. Kipling was a registered voter in the North Vancouver municipality. He never did vote, for he was only here in passing. And it remains a mystery as to why he was on the list at all if he did not, indeed, own the land!"
