A family dispute forced Kipling to abandon Naulakha in 1896. “There are only two places in the world where I want to live,” he wrote, “Bombay and Brattleboro. And I can’t live in either.”\n\nKipling won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907. He was one of England’s most popular writers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 2019, Christopher Benfey published If: The Untold Story of Kipling’s American Years, a new look at the author’s influence and import.\n\nIn his autobiography Something of Myself, Kipling wrote of Naulakha, “Ninety feet was the length of it and thirty the width, on a high foundation of solid mortared rocks which gave us an airy and a skunk-proof basement. The rest was wood, shingled, roof and sides, with dull green hand-split shingles, and the windows were lavish and wide.”\n\nThe property’s National Historic Landmark nomination includes the following description:\n\n“Reflecting the eclectic background of its original owner and builder, the celebrated British author Rudyard Kipling, Naulakha is an unusual example of the Shingle Style. The house exhibits elements of Indian bungalow in the broad eaves, Kashmir houseboat with an elaborate carved screen, and Mississippi riverboat in the overall shape. Described, indeed, as a ship by Kipling, Naulakha continues to ‘sail’ across a Dummerston, Vermont hillside and command spectacular easterly views over a sloping meadow to the Connecticut River valley and the mountains of New Hampshire.”"
