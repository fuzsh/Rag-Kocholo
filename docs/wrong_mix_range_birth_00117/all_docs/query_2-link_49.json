        "text": "Harry Carr\n\nTHE centenary year of Kipling’s birth would seem to be justification for adding yet one more to the vast number of papers that have already been written on this subject.\n\nThe need for this further essay was first made apparent to me when—in my capacity as Secretary of the Lodge and Editor of the Transactions—I began to receive inquiries from Brethren as far away as Vancouver and Singapore, asking for materials and information which might help them to complete their own papers on Kipling, and I found, to my surprise, that while our library contains a great deal of relevant material, there has never been a paper on Kipling in our Transactions.\n\nI approached four Brethren in turn, each with vastly better qualifications for this task than any that I could muster—but without success; and eventually the work fell to me. My diffidence was increased when one of the Brethren with whom I discussed the project said: “What, another paper on Kipling and Freemasonry! Let’s hope it will be the paper to end all papers on that subject!” Coming from a middle-aged man who had been a lover of Kipling’s works since childhood, this remark puzzled me, but he would not enlarge on it.\n\nWhen I started to read the papers that had already been written, I began to understand, and, although he may not have so intended, he had indeed provided the best of reasons for yet another piece. On the subject of Kipling’s Masonic writings, each of the earlier papers had covered the ground more or less thoroughly, with suitable quotations, comment and interpretation. But on Kipling’s Masonic career and background. there was a kind of uniform haziness, a screen of uncertainty and inaccuracy as to dates and details, which could hardly have been more effective if he had been born 500 years ago; here, seemed to me, was the real justification.\n\nIn regard to Kipling’s Masonic writings, it is hoped that the brief selections quoted will suffice to point the way towards the pleasures that are in store for the would-be reader of the tales and verses from which they are drawn. So far as the main events of Kipling’s Masonic career are concerned, I will only say that every effort has been made to check the facts and to quote the proper authority for the statements that are made here. I have been fortunate enough to find useful pieces of hitherto unpublished material, and these, with original minutes and records, are quoted wherever possible. Where sundry details still remain unconfirmed, the absence of confirmation will be properly noted.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nI must acknowledge my indebtedness first and mainly to Charles Carrington’s famous work, Rudyard Kipling, His Life and Work (London, Macmillan, 1955), which has furnished the principal biographical data in my paper. [1] Next, to Bro. R. E. Harbord, President of the Kipling Society of England, for the loan of valuable papers and for furnishing the two Kipling portraits reproduced in the paper. In addition, I owe him my special thanks for his kindness in reading the proofs of the paper and the corrections and data he supplied in the course of that task. My thanks likewise to another member of the Kipling Society, Bro. Capt. D. M. Penrose, Secretary of Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, who provided the details of Kipling’s admission that body, with permission to reproduce the autographed Application Form.\n\nFinally, my thanks are due to Bro. Col. R. J. Wilkinson, Librarian of Mark Grand Lodge, and to the numerous Secretaries of Craft Lodges who added to—or confirmed—information already known; to Bro. A. R. Hewitt, Librarian and Curator to the Grand Lodge, for unstinted help; and to the Board of General Purposes for their permission to reproduce a portion of Kipling’s work as Secretary of his Mother Lodge.\n\nRUDYARD KIPLING’S PARENTS AND FAMILY BACKGROUND\n\nJohn Lockwood Kipling was born on 6th July, 1837, the eldest son of a Methodist minister. Despite an unhappy schooling at a boarding school near Leeds, he grew up to be a man of wide reading and he early developed a deep interest in the Arts and Crafts movement, one of the results of the Great Exhibition of 1851. In 1861 he was employed as a sculptor during the building of the Victoria and Albert Museum, but his interest in the arts expressed itself equally well in painting, in prose, and in a craftsman’s skill with tools. At the age of 22 he settled in Burslem to gain experience in pottery-designing, and there he met his future wife, Alice Macdonald, daughter of the local Methodist minister. They were married in London in 1865.\n\nThe Macdonalds were a large and remarkable family, five sisters and two brothers, who, by their own talents and by marriage, had established themselves as an artistic and literary circle in London. The Rosettis, Swinburne and William Morris were among their friends. One sister married Edward Burne Jones; another married Edward Poynter. Both men became members of the Royal Academy and Baronets; Poynter was later a President of the R.A.\n\nAt the time of his marriage, John Lockwood Kipling was very poor, but he had managed to obtain an appointment as principal of a new art school at Bombay, and the couple left for India soon after their wedding. It was a country where they had neither friends nor influence. Hope, health and a zest for his work were John Lockwood Kipling’s principal assets, but he was a good-humoured and very likeable man.\n\nHIS CHILDHOOD\n\nJoseph Rudyard Kipling [2] was born at Bombay on 30th December, 1865, and in that bustling, thriving city he spent the first five years of his childhood, his world bounded by the limits of his parents’ bungalow garden, where he played with modelling-clay and the sculptor’s chips from his father’s studio.\n\nHis most frequent companion was Meeta, a Hindu servant, from whom he acquired such a competent knowledge of the vernacular that he often had to be reminded to speak English when with his parents.\n\nIn March, 1868, the family visited England for a brief spell, and there, three months later, Kipling’s sister “Trix” (Alice) was born. In 1871 they came to England again for a six-month furlough, and before the parents returned to India they made arrangements—customary with Anglo-Indian families—to leave the children in England for their education.\n\nRudyard, aged nearly six, and Trix, aged three, were boarded at the home of a retired sea captain at Southsea. Their new guardians, automatically promoted to the status of “Uncle and Aunty”, were total strangers; indeed, John Kipling had chosen the couple from a newspaper advertisement. There is some speculation as to why the children were not boarded with any of their relatives, and it seems possible that the reason was partly because John Kipling’s independent spirit would not let him seek favours from his wealthier “in-laws”; but it may simply have been because the latter were fully occupied with their own families.\n\nThe five years that Rudyard and Trix spent at Southsea, though they appeared to be living in modest comfort, were a period of wretchedness and misery that left their mark, on the lad especially. “Aunt Rosa” was doubtless a good woman, but harsh, tyrannical and unsympathetic. At the age of six, Rudyard had not yet learned to read or write, and in the years that followed he became a restless, clumsy, unruly and unresponsive lad. When he did learn to read, a whole new world must have opened for him, and he read everything that came within his reach. He talked constantly about the characters in his books and suffered the worst of all punishments when deprived of his reading.\n\nHis eyesight became affected, resulting in a series of bad monthly reports from the day school which he attended, followed by further punishments. But a long time passed before it was realized that the lad’s eyes were so weak. Glasses were ordered and he was forbidden to risk further eyestrain by reading. The next few months were the worst of all for the boy. The story, “Baa, Baa, Black Sheep” (published later in Wee Willie Winkie), is a wholly biographical piece, and it describes this period of their lives as Kipling remembered it, with pitiable effect. If it was in any way exaggerated, that may be readily explained as a child’s-eye view, but it must have been a fearful experience for him to have recalled it as he did.\n\nThere came, at last, a happy day in March, 1877, when his mother arrived from India and the two children were taken off to a farm at Loughton, Essex, where they had a wonderful holiday under their mother’s care—in preparation for Rudyard’s admission to a public school.\n\nSCHOOL AT WESTWARD HO!\n\nThe United Services’ College at Westward Ho! in Bideford Bay, North Devon, was founded in 1874 by a group of Army officers who sought to give their sons a gentleman’s education at fees within their means. It was chosen by John Kipling because its headmaster, Cormell Price, was a friend of his—and he was already Uncle “Crom” to the young Rudyard.\n\nThe school was in its fifth year when Kipling joined it, its discipline stern, if not harsh. Most of his fellows were soldiers’ sons, and both they and their environment were distinctly rough and ready. Kipling’s defective sight rendered him unfit for most of the school sports or for holding his own against heavy-handed or quarrelsome boys—and he soon learned to avoid trouble by his tact and friendliness. But there is good evidence that he found his fellows tough, and the settling-in period was not a happy time, as we see in a letter from the boy’s mother to Cormell Price, dated 24 January, 1878:—\n\n“This morning I had no letter from Ruddy—yesterday I had four. It is the roughness of the lads he seems to feel most; he doesn’t grumble to me—but he is lonely and down. I was his chum, you know, and he hasn’t found another yet. I don’t encourage the rain of letters; I discourage it—at the same time knowing that both his father and I have really an unusual twist for scribbling, and think no more of it than of talking…\n\nThe lad has a great deal that is feminine in his nature, and a little sympathy from any quarter will reconcile him to his changed life more than anything.…” [3]\n\nDespite the lad’s facility with his pen, his mother was clearly ready to believe it was an hereditary trait rather than a native skill!\n\nVery gradually, the separation from his mother and sister were compensated for by the friends he found in this new male society.\n\nAt twelve he was short for his age, chubby, with an aggressive chin, the heavy black eyebrows which so distinguished him in later life, and bright blue eyes behind thick glasses which he wore only when he was not reading.\n\nIn 1878, John Lockwood Kipling was in charge of the India section of the Paris Exhibition, and Rudyard was taken over to Paris for a memorable holiday with an English friend from another school. John Kipling was quick to realize his son’s good qualities, but he was still unable to refrain from judging him by adult standards, although “Ruddy” was not yet thirteen years old. On 15th June, 1878, John Lockwood Kipling wrote to Cormell Price:\n\n“I find Ruddy a delightfully amiable and companionable little chap, but the way in which he only half apprehends the common facts and necessities of daily life is surprising. Vagueness and inaccuracy, I fear, will always bother him & they take curious forms…\n\nIf there is anything in him at all, the steady stress of daily work in which exactness is required should pull his mind together a little. But I should think he will always be inclined to shirk the collar and to interest himself in out of the way things….”\n\nBut the boy’s interests were widening, greatly encouraged by “Uncle Crom”, in whose company, during the holidays, be met and was thoroughly at home with artists and writers. His own reading had become diversified and adult, and he had the useful faculty of digesting the essence of a book in a matter of miutes.\n\nWhen the opportunity came for him to share a study with two other boys, George Beresford and Lionel Dunsterville (M’Turk & Stalky) joined him and unwittingly became the pattern for the adventures enshrined in Stalky & Co.\n\nA particular influence on Kipling at this time was William Crofts, his teacher for Latin and English Literature, who helped to broaden his reading, which now ranged very widely indeed. Defoe, Fielding, Smollett, Dickens and Thackeray had been the basis of his early reading at Southsea. At Westward Ho!, Milton, Tennyson, Longfellow, Emerson, Mark Twain and Bret Harte, Carlyle, Ruskin and Browning, and Landor’s Imaginary Conversations were all studied and discussed to the point where Kipling was able to write verse and tales in the style of any of his favourites. In the last two years of his schooling, “Uncle Crom” gave Kipling the run of his library without pressure or prohibition, leaving him free to range over hundreds of volumes of verse, drama and prose in English and French. Now “the Head” began to take a close personal interest in Kipling’s studies. In 1881 his parents had arranged for the publication of a collection of his verses under the title, Schoolboy Lyrics—all unknown to their author. Kipling, absorbed in his reading and writing, was clearly destined for some kind of literary career. Whether this first publication was a simple piece of family pride, or whether they foresaw a successful literary career for their son, it is certain that before the end of that year they had made their decision, and this is shown in a letter from John Lockwood Kipling to Cormell Price:\n\nLahore, 23rd October, 1881.\n\n“… Now a boy living in India has curiously few chances of going wrong—and especially living with his own people. I must confess from what I have seen of Ruddy it is the moral side I dread a breakout on. I don’t think he is the stuff to resist temptation.\n\nIt has occurred to us that the regular daily work of a newspaper would furnish by no means a bad occupation and I doubt not I could get him engaged on the Civil & Military Gazette here. And on the whole I am inclined to think that the easy-going general interest he is ready to take in all sorts of things, though the plague of his masters, who think he could do so much better if he would only work—is after all one of those affairs of temperament & constitution which nothing can change, and must be made the best of. Journalism seems to be specially invented for such desultory souls….”\n\nA few weeks later John Kipling wrote to another friend that he proposed to\n\n“bring Rudyard out to India next year, and get him some newspaper work. Oxford we can’t afford. Ruddy thirsts for a man’s life and a man’s work.”\n\nNevertheless, his last year at school was a happy time for Rudyard. Beresford and Dunsterville were his inseparable companions and they were the leaders of taste in the school. Their exploits included all sorts of pranks in breach of school regulations, smoking, poaching and excursions out of bounds; but they never blundered into serious mischief, and Kipling found time—in addition to his studies—to write several poems for the College Chronicle and some articles for a local newspaper.\n\nJohn Kipling was still troubled about his son’s character and abilities, as may be seen in the following extracts from his letters:—\n\nLahore, 17th June, 1882.\n\n“…And if Ruddy does not learn conciseness, and the way to begin to consider a question—the mere fluency & facility of yarning he possesses will be of but little use. I am inclined to think he will learn his work in harness better than anywhere else….”\n\nSimla, 1st September, 1882.\n\n“…It is impossible of course not to see the faults of the boy’s qualities—with others more serious … Alice says I am unduly harsh in saying, Ruddy must be a journalist because he won’t fit himself for anything else … But though far from triumphant about him, we cannot but see that he has some of the qualities necessary for his craft….”\n\nRudyard’s last “school” summer holiday was spent at Rottingdean with a host of Macdonald cousins, and partly at Skipton with his Kipling grandmother. He sailed for India on September 20th, 1882, alone, in drizzling rain and seasick.\n\nLAHORE AND SIMLA, 1882–1887\n\nAfter four weeks at sea, with an exciting stop at Port Said which made a deep impression on Kipling’s imaginative mind, he arrived at Lahore in October, 1882, happy to be back in the atmosphere of his childhood.\n\nLahore, a low-lying, ancient walled city full of the sights, sounds and smells of Asia, was connected by a broad boulevard to its newer European quarter, which housed some seventy British residents. Outside the city, at a distance of some four miles, was Mian Mir, a military cantonment housing a Battalion of British Infantry and a Battery or more of Artillery. John Kipling was Principal of the Mayo School of Art and Curator of the Lahore Museum, and for the first few days after his return Rudyard helped in the Museum, where his father had established a notable collection, relating to Indian arts and archaeology, that was much used by the students.\n\nIn November, 1882, Rudyard, nearly 17 years of age, started work as “Assistant Editor” on the Civil & Military Gazette, a local newspaper owned by two Englishmen, who were also the proprietors of the Pioneer at Allahabad—a journal of national status. Both of them were close friends to John and Alice Kipling, who were frequent contributors to the Pioneer, and there can be no doubt that this friendship had helped in procuring Rudyard’s appointment.\n\nThe editor, Stephen Wheeler, was the only other European member of the staff, and, as he was often sick with fever, Kipling frequently carried the responsibility of overseeing the 170 Indian printing hands. Wheeler kept him hard at work on news-agency telegrams, preparing their contents as copy for each edition which went to press at midnight. Kipling mastered the technical work without difficulty and his schooling had already prepared him for the strictly controlled style of his literary work, which must have involved a severe restriction on his own native exuberance.\n\nIn 1883, aged 18, he already had his own quarters in his parents’ bungalow, a personal servant, a bay pony and a trap in which he drove to the office, which consisted of two wooden sheds near to the city. John Lockwood Kipling wrote to a friend in 1883:\n\n“Ruddy is getting on well, having mastered the details of his work in a very short time. His chief, Mr. Wheeler, is very tetchy and irritable, and by dint of his exertions in patience and forbearance, the boy is training for heaven as well as for editorship. I am sure he is better here where there are no music-hall ditties to pick up, no young persons to philander with … All that makes Lahore profoundly dull makes it safe for young persons….” (C.C., p. 50, quoting from the Kipling Papers, the property of Mrs. George Bambridge, Kipling’s daughter.)\n\nDuring the hot weather of 1883 his parents went for several weeks into the Hills, and Kipling was unbearably alone in the house with the Indian servants. Then he stayed for 30 days at Simla with James Walker, one of his employers.\n\nSimla was virtually the centre of government from May to October, housing the Viceroy and his staff, with the best and gayest of Anglo-Indian society, as well as the place-seekers and fortune-hunters. It was, according to John Kipling, “full of pretty girls” and, of course, the wealthier matrons, who stayed there for several months, though their husbands had to be satisfied with only their month or sixty days of leave. Simla was a hill-town whose steep slopes left no room for good roads. All the houses were built on the slopes and in constant danger of slipping down the hillsides during the rainy months of July and August. Yet that was the brightest time for Simla, when the Europeans most needed refuge from the fever-ridden plains.\n\nIn August, Kipling was back at work in deserted Lahore, where a dozen men represented the whole European community, the remainder being away in the Hills with their families.\n\nHe was a none-too-popular honorary member of the Punjab Club (doubtless because he was too young for full membership) and there he dined and spent most of his evenings. After the paper had gone to press he wandered for hours through the alleys of the old city until the cool of dawn brought some relief.\n\nIn January, 1884, his mother brought Trix back to India from England, and the next four years were Kipling’s happiest years in India. Trix, an attractive and intelligent girl, made up the devoted and close-knit “Family Square”, as Alice Kipling called it, which was perhaps the best formative influence on Rudyard’s character.\n\nSoon he was commissioned as special reporter on pubic events, and in March, 1884, he went to Patiala State, in the train of Lord Ripon, the Viceroy, where he greatly enjoyed princely hospitality and turned in some very successful newspaper work. Here, incidentally, he had his first experience of Indian bribery when he rejected a choice of banknotes, a concubine, or an Arab horse, which were offered him if he would use his newspaper’s influence on behalf of one of the Indian princes. Wherever he went, people, scenes, objects, actions and behaviour were noted, observed and stored in his extraordinarily receptive memory, as always, to reappear at some future date in his stories and verses.\n\nHis one unhappy moment during this year was the end of his first love affair. At the age of 16, while in England, he had met Flo Garrard, a lovely, sophisticated girl, who was another paying guest with Trix at “Aunty Rosa’s”. Their meetings must have been infrequent and secret, but, when Rudyard left England in 1882, the attachment was so far advanced that they considered themselves engaged. She was a year or two older than Rudyard, and when, in July, 1884, she wrote breaking off their “understanding”, he must have been deeply hurt, though undoubtedly it was the best thing that could have happened. Eighteen months later he wrote to one of his English aunts asking her to find out if Flo Garrard was happy, and she held her place in his memory for many years. This theme of a young man in India and his girl at home was frequently repeated in his later stories.\n\nThe year 1884 brought cholera to Lahore, where the European community had eleven cases and four deaths out of the population of seventy. The family were at Dalhousie, a more economical hill-station than Simla, and Rudyard joined them for a month, during which he and Trix together wrote a volume of verse parodies, Echoes, published later by the Civil & Military Gazette. The book had a fairly good reception and Rudyard’s articles were also beginning to attract attention, though he used different pen-names for his contributions to the down-country journals.\n\nIn March, 1885, he was at Rawalpindi for the first big event under Lord Dufferin, the new Viceroy, when his political articles and reportage began to win him credit as a well-informed journalist.\n\nLord Dufferin’s first summer at Simla, 1885, was a turning-point in the social life of the Kiplings. He was a traveller, scholar and wit, his wife a great lady who strengthened her husband’s hand, and their daughter was a pupil in John Kipling’s sketching class. Lady Dufferin soon brought the Kiplings into the Viceregal circle of friends, and in no time their son, Lord Clandeboye, had become attached to Trix, now an acknowledged beauty and an accomplished actress and dancer. The young man was packed off to England before matters could become too involved, but the two families remained good friends. Rudyard was at Simla as a journalist on duty, and his employers insisted that he must learn to dance and partake fully in the social life, a hint which he accepted wholeheartedly.\n\nIn 1885 the family produced a “magazine” which was subsequently published in the Gazette under the title Quartette, and it contained the first two stories which Rudyard, in later time, thought worthy of preservation in his collected editions—one, Phantom Rickshaw, a Poe-like study of hallucination; the other, Morrowbie Jukes, a venture into the unknown world of Indian life, far removed from his normal journalistic world. About this time, too, he fell in love again, with a daughter of the military chaplain at Mian Mir, but this time the affair had no depth or duration and he came through it unharmed.\n\nKipling was now nearly 21 years old, an untidy, abrupt fellow, cheerful, exuberant and with abounding energy, quick in repartee and witty. He had a great zeal for his chosen profession, working hard enough for three, and he was singularly happy within the “family-square”, but he still had an uneasy social manner. Some of these traits are manifestly irreconcilable, and it seems that they were born of a natural shyness or diffidence which disappeared on close acquaintance. Everyone who knew him well found him a likeable and even a lovable character\n\nIn April, 1886, aged 20 years and 3 months, Kipling entered the Craft.\n\nKIPLING’S EARLY YEARS IN THE CRAFT\n\nOne of the many papers on Kipling, “Bro. Rudyard Kipling and His Masonic Verse”,[4] speaks of Kipling’s father as Bro. John Lockwood Kipling, and this is the only case I have found which suggests that Rudyard may have had a family connection with the Craft. It is extremely doubtful if there was any such link. Kipling never mentioned it, and, allowing for the deep affection he had for his father, it is certain that he would have noted the fact either in his letters or his writings. There is likewise no mention of any kind of family link to be found. Kipling was proposed for initiation into Lodge Hope and Perseverance, No. 782 (E.C.), by a military friend, Col. Oswald Menzies, at that time President of the Punjab Dist. Bd. of General Purposes; he was seconded by another member of the Lodge, Bro. C. Brown.\n\nIn his little autobiography, Something of Myself, pp. 52–3, written towards the end of his life, he gives his own modest account of his admission:—\n\n“In ‘85 I was made a Freemason by dispensation (Lodge Hope and Perseverance 782 E.C.) being under age, because the Lodge hoped for a good Secretary. They did not get him, but I helped, and got the Father to advise, in decorating the bare walls of the Masonic Hall with hangings after the prescription of Solomon’s Temple.\n\nHere I met Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, members of the Araya and Brahmo Samaj, and a Jew Tyler,[5] who was priest and butcher to his little community in the city. So yet another world opened to me which I needed.”\n\nKipling was wrong in his dates. The following is a transcript of all the minutes relating to his admission in the records of the Lodge Hope and Perseverance, 1886-1887:—[6]\n\n[INITIATION]\n\nMINUTES of the Proceedings of the Regular Meeting of Lodge of Hope and Perseverance, No. 782, E.C., Held at The Masonic Hall (Anarkali), Lahore, India, on Monday, the 5th April 1886.\n\nWorshipful Master: W. Brother G. B. Wolseley.\n\nItem on Agenda\n\n3 The Ballot was taken for Mr. Joseph Rudyard Kipling, aged 20 years 2 1/2 months, Assistant Editor, “Civil & Military Gazette”, and residing at Lahore, a candidate for Initiation.\n\nPROPOSED by W.Bro. Col. Menezes\n\nSECONDED by Bro. C. Brown\n\nwhich proved unanimously favourable.\n\nDISPENSATION from District Grand Master authorising his Initiation as a minor was then read.\n\n4 THE CANDIDATE, Mr. Joseph Rudyard Kipling, was then admitted and initiated in due form into the Mysteries and Secrets of Ancient Freemasonry, The Worshipful Master giving the Degree.\n\n(Signed) O. Menezes, P.M.\n\n[PASSING]\n\nAt the Regular meeting on Monday, 3rd May 1886.\n\nWorshipful Master: W.Bro. Col. O. Menezes.\n\n3 BRO. KIPLING being a Candidate for the Second, or Fellowcraft, Degree, was duly examined in the First, or Entered Apprentice, Degree and being found proficient, was allowed to retire for preparation.\n\n4 THE LODGE was then opened in the Second Degree.\n\n5 THE Candidate was then re-admitted and passed to the Second Degree in due and ancient form.\n\n[RAISING]\n\nAt the Regular Meeting on Monday, 6th December 1886 [the Lodge having been in vacation in the interim].\n\nWorshipful Master: W.Bro. Col. G. B. Wolseley.\n\n3 BROTHER RUDYARD KIPLING being a Candidate for the High and Sublime Degree of a Master Mason, was then examined by the Worshipful Master according to ancient custom, and having proved proficient, was allowed to retire, while\n\n4 THE LODGE was opened in the Third Degree.\n\n5 ON the Candidate being re-admitted, he was raised to the Third Degree in due and ancient form.\n\n“The Minutes recording his raising are actually entered in the Minute Book in Kipling’s own handwriting, he having acted as Secretary to the meeting at which he was raised—perhaps a unique position.” (MB/N.)\n\nEntered in April, 1886; Passed in May; Raised in December, the Lodge having been closed in the interim period, which included the hot months. It is perhaps typical of Kipling that within a few months of his Raising he gave a Lecture in his Mother Lodge on the “Origin of the Craft First Degree”, and four months later he lectured again on “Popular Views on Freemasonry”. (The first Lecture was on 4th April, 1887; the second on 4th July, 1887.) (MB/N.) What a great pity that the texts of both talks have disappeared!\n\nThere is no record of the source of Kipling’s Masonic knowledge and it is extremely doubtful if his Lodge possessed a Masonic library. The military Lodge at Mian Mir was an even less likely source. The only Masonic journal then published in the Punjab was the Masonic Record of Western India,[7] a monthly magazine of some 40 pages octavo, printed at Allahabad, which gave brief items of Masonic news from all parts of the world, with fuller details from the English Quarterly Communications and fairly full reports of Indian Masonic matters, all these being interspersed with brief articles, poems and stories more or less related to the Craft. Some of the earlier volumes of this little journal may have furnished Kipling with his material, but that is pure speculation. Yet, if Kipling at 21 was anything like the successful author of later years, betraying in his tales a full grasp of all the technical information belonging to his subject and eagerly inserting the odd details that show how he delighted in his mastery of them, it is certain that he did not undertake his Masonic Lectures without a good grounding.\n\nHe was recorded as Secretary, duly elected,[8] at the regular meeting on January 10th, 1887. He was invested with his collar of office at the February meeting and was “appointed P.M. Steward” at that meeting, and he attended every monthly meeting up to and including August 1st, 1887.[9] He pursued every branch of the Craft that was within his reach with his customary zeal. He was advanced in the Mark Degree in Fidelity Mark Lodge, No. 98, at Lahore, on 14th April, 1887, and was elevated in Mt. Ararat Ark Mariners’ Lodge, No. 98, on the same day.[10]\n\nOf his love for Freemasonry there can be no doubt, especially when we see how often it crept into his later writings, yet it is strange that he left practically no personal records of his Lodges, or of his friendships in the Craft.\n\nThe Lodge of Hope and Perseverance, No. 782, was constituted in 1858 (as No. 1084), meeting in the “Lodge Rooms”, Lahore. At the time of Kipling’s Initiation it had some 25 or 30 members, largely made up—as one might expect in the India of that time—of soldiers, civil engineers, civil servants, doctors, men attached to various branches of the post and telegraph services and to the police. The total Masonic population of the Punjab State, under the Dist. Grand Lodge. English Constitution, was 650 (approx.) in some 20 Lodges, an average of 30 members per Lodge. These low numbers, combined with the high incidence of illness, home furlough and unavoidable long-distance travel in a large and developing country, must have caused all sorts of difficulties in the continuity of management of the Lodges. This was remedied in No. 782 in 1887, a year after Kipling’s Initiation, when the Lodge amalgamated with Lodge Ravee, No. 1215, which was in difficulties owing to insufficient membership; No. 782, the stronger Lodge, absorbed the weaker. The Grand Lodge Register shows that 21 members joined 782 in that year from No. 1215, and Lodge Ravee returned its Warrant.\n\nThe well-known passage in Something of Myself (quoted above), in which Kipling wrote, “Here I met Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, members of the Araya and Brabmo Samaj …”, may be true in substance, but it tends to create the impression that Hope and Perseverance was a heavily “mixed” Lodge, with a high proportion of members from the native population. This was probably quite unintentional, but one of Kipling’s letters to The Times in 1925 (forty years after his Initiation) seems to support the suggestion, and it contains, incidentally, a notable error of fact:—\n\n“… I was Secretary for some years of Hope and Perseverance Lodge, No. 782, Lahore, which included Brethren of at least four creeds. I was entered by a member of Bramo Samaj, a Hindu, passed by a Mohammedan, and raised by an Englishman. Our Tyler was an Indian Jew.\n\nWe met, of course, on the level, and the only difference anyone would notice was that at our banquets some of the Brethren, who were debarred by caste rules from eating food not ceremonially prepared, sat over empty plates.”[11]\n\nThe Lodge minutes prove that the details of Entry are certainly incorrect, and those of Passing are probably wrong, too. A reference to the Initiation minute, above, will show that it ends with the words “… the Worshipful Master giving the Degree”. The W.M. on the night in question was W.Bro. Col. G. B. Wolseley, C.B., P.Dist.Dep.G.M., certainly not a Hindu, and he presided at Kipling’s Raising, too. The W.M. at the Passing was Col. Oswald Menzies, who had proposed him. There is no record in the Minutes of any other Brother taking the Chair for the 2Â° and 3Â° ceremonies, and it seems very likely that the “… Hindu and … Mohammedan …” were either the results of faulty memory or the creatures of a fertile imagination.\n\nIt is certain that the ability of Europeans and Asiatics to meet “on the Level” in the Lodge Room, without distinction of class or colour, race or creed, had made a very deep impression on Kipling, as witness his poem The Mother Lodge, which was founded on that theme, and this may well explain the momentary lapse in the accuracy of his memoirs. The records show that there were, in fact, at least four non-European Brethren in the Lodge at that time, as follows:—\n\nBikrama Singh[12] Profession not stated Mohammed Hayat Khan Assistant Commissioner[13] Protal C. Chatterjee, M.A. Pleader In the Law Courts (?) Gopal Das U.C.S. (?)\n\nThe Kipling file in the Grand Lodge archives contains the Annual Return made to the Dist. G. Lodge of the Punjab by the Lodge of Hope and Perseverance on December 31st, 1886. The Lodge had evidently been suffering from Secretarial troubles at that time,[14] and this particular Return is especially interesting, because it was compiled and signed by Kipling himself, as Acting-Secretary, only eight months after his Initiation and less than four weeks after his Raising!\n\nKipling’s Return shows a total of twenty-four members in the Lodge, including the four named above, but his Return is certainly incomplete. B. C. Jussawalla, a merchant, joined the Lodge in 1884, and was still on the Roll five years later, but he does not appear in Kipling’s Return. Dr. Brij Lal Ghose, R.B., Assistant Surgeon, joined the Lodge in 1879 and there is no record of his resignation, but he, too, is omitted from Kipling’s Return, though he is regularly shown in high office at meetings of the Dist. Grand Lodge and its Committees during the period of Kipling’s association with the Lodge.\n\nIt is strange that Kipling left practically no record of his personal impressions and recollections within his own Lodge. Stranger still, perhaps, that none of the Masonic allusions in his verse and prose can be deemed strictly autobiographical. In later years, after he had achieved world fame, he avoided all discussion of his private affairs with strangers and shunned that kind of publicity like the plague. This facet of his character arose directly from the success which made him a target for all who could profit from his words. But that was not the case in his youth, when he was still shy, ill-at-ease and finding it very difficult to settle into the adult society of Lahore. For a youngster in that frame of mind, to be received as an equal in the Lodge was indeed an unforgettable experience, and when, towards the end of his life, he wrote about his Initiation: “So yet another world opened to me, which I needed”, he was referring not so much to Freemasonry, the Craft itself, but to the little group of Brethren who had opened their doors to him.\n\nHe made it his business to learn about the Craft, because, as a writer, that kind of approach was second nature to him. That he found it in every way admirable is constantly revealed in his writings; but his zeal for the Craft was not centred in its organization or its ritual, and one may doubt if he would ever have reached the Chair, even if he had had an opportunity to do so. There seems to be no doubt, and his subsequent record confirms the fact, that his real love for the Craft was based on the welcome that he found in it and upon the rich variety of characters whom he met in the Lodge.\n\nOn January 10th, 1887, a few days after his election as Secretary, he is recorded as “J. Rudyard Kipling, Secy. of No. 782”, a visitor at the meeting of the Dist. Grand Lodge at Lahore (M.R.W.I., vol. xxiii, p. 450) ; a month later he served in that capacity at a meeting of the Permanent Committee of his Lodge. It is reasonably certain that he found time to visit the Lodge at Mian Mir (St. John the Evangelist, No. 1483), where two of the members were Surgeon Capt. Terence Mulvaney and Lieut. Learoyd, R.A., whose names are immortalized in Soldiers Three.[15] The remainder of his career in the Craft was sadly interrupted by the calls of his profession—but that is another story.\n\nLITERARY SUCCESS AND RESIGNATION FROM THE LODGE\n\nIn the summer of 1886, Kipling joined his family at Simla, where (by reason of Lord Clandeboye’s attachment to “Trix”) he moved into the Viceregal circle and found numerous friends among the rising young men of the Viceroy’s staff, which led to a natural and noticeable increase in his status as a journalist.\n\nOn his return to Lahore, in the cool months of 1886–7, he began to write the verse and stories that brought him to fame. Wheeler, his chief at the Gazette, had allowed him no scope for the imaginative writing that he wanted to do; but now, broken in health, the editor was retiring, and Kay Robinson, assistant editor of the Pioneer at Allahabad and a good friend to Kipling, was to take over Wheeler’s position. Kipling was delighted and the new arrangement began to show immediate results. Copying a journalistic feature that had proved very successful during his time on the London Globe, Robinson set Kipling to write a series of regular weekly articles for the Gazette. They were to be short topical pieces of high local interest and limited to 2,000 words, an ideal discipline for Kipling and one that he greatly enjoyed. The best of them are preserved today in his Plain Tales from the Hills.\n\nIn the course of his journalistic duties he was ready to take all sorts of risks in the lowest quarters of the town, and he had already developed an uncanny skill in quickly absorbing local colour, a skill which became one of his principal assets as a writer. It was said that he knew more about the shady side of life in Lahore than the police, more about the regiments and the life at Mian Mir than the Officers themselves; but his curiosity ranged over every field.\n\nIn 1887 he sold a collection of his verse, of local and topical interest, under the title Departmental Ditties, to a Calcutta publisher, for 500 Rupees. They were inclined to be shocking and cynical, attracting considerable attention in India, but the only review in the London Press found them merely “quaint and amusing”, perhaps because they were too closely related to the narrow themes of civil service and military life in India. His friends, and Robinson especially, were beginning to urge him to spread his wings and seek a wider public in London, but he was happy in his Lahore-Simla surroundings, treating his employment on the Gazette as a kind of seven-year apprenticeship to his profession.\n\nDuring the summer of 1887, Kipling’s employers were arranging to transfer him to the staff of the Pioneer at Allahabad, and the minutes of the Lodge of Hope and Perseverance, No. 782 (in Kipling’s own handwriting), record the following:—\n\n3. The Secretary having announced his impending departure to Allahabad as a reason why he should be relieved of his office, W.Bro. J. J. Davies rose and said:—\n\n“Worshipful Sir and Brethren,\n\nWe have all heard with deep regret the intimation made by our Bro. Secretary that we are soon to lose his services as Secretary of this Lodge. Those of us who have watched his conduct since his initiation feel sure that he has before him a successful Masonic career, for the thoroughness with which he conducted his duties was prompted by a lively interest in his work and by a keen desire for a deeper insight into the hidden truths of Masonry.\n\n“Bro. Kipling has also contributed towards the welfare of the Lodge by the series of Lectures which he delivered to the Brethren, which was of a nature both interesting and instructive, while his courteous disposition has won for him the general esteem of the Brethren. He has been all that a Secretary should be, and it is with regret that I hear the Lodge is about to lose the services of one whom I feel sure will yet be an ornament to his Lodge and a bright light in the Masonic Circle.\n\n“I feel sure that all the Brethren will join me in wishing Bro. Kipling success in his future life and to express a hope that circumstances will permit him to occasionally visit the meetings of his Mother Lodge.”\n\nBro. Kipling returned thanks for the kind allusions made to his success as Secretary and for the good wishes expressed by the Brethren present. He said he would always remember with pride and affection the meetings he had attended at Lodge Hope and Perseverance whereby he had formed friendships which would leave a lasting impression on his memory. He would take every opportunity that offered of attending the meetings of his Mother Lodge.\n\n(Signed) E. C. Jussawallab[16]\n\nAt this stage Kipling cannot have had any idea that his departure would be anything more than a temporary break in his Masonic career, and until that time he had certainly discharged all his duties, and more, with a praiseworthy zeal.\n\nHe lived a bachelor life at the Allahabad Club, but he soon found good and interesting friends, notably Prof. S. A. Hill, a Government meteorologist, and his wife. In a letter to her sister in Pennsylvania, she described Kipling as short, dark-haired, balding and fortyish (he was only twenty-two), with a heavy moustache and thick glasses, a scintillating and animated storyteller, and equally interesting in more sober conversation.\n\nThe Plain Tales met with immediate success in India, where many of their thinly-disguised characters were readily recognized. A French edition[17] was also well received, but the work remained unnoticed in London. For the Pioneer, Kipling was now travelling a good deal and was writing a series of articles, the Letters of Marque, afterwards issued as the first part of Vol. 1 of From Sea to Sea. He began to write fiction for the Week’s News and for other journals—work which was all too quickly written and accepted by undiscriminating publishers and public. Six volumes of short stories were issued in 1888 (later contained in Soldiers Three and Wee Willie Winkie). They brought him, for the first time, a bank balance of Â£200 in advance royalties, and established his reputation as a writer whose works ranged over civil service, military, native and society life. They were sketches and impressions as much as stories, in which character-studies and local colour were as important as the tales themselves.\n\nBusy though he was, Kipling still found time for his Freemasonry, and there is a record of his attendance at the Installation meeting of Lodge Independence with Philanthropy, No. 391, at Allahabad, on 22nd December, 1887, when Sir John Edge, Chief Justice of the N.W. Provinces, was installed before an enormous assembly. (M.R.W.I., vol. xxiv, p. 345.) In March, 1888, when he believed that he was permanently settled in Allahabad, he wrote to his Lodge at Lahore:—\n\nAt the Regular Meeting on Monday, 2nd April, 1888. Worshipful Master: W.Bro. Koenig.\n\n9. Read the following letter from Bro. RUDYARD KIPLING dated Allahabad, 22nd March 1888:\n\nDear Sir and Worshipful Master,\n\n“It is with great regret I have to inform you that I am now permanently transferred to Allahabad and therefore forced to abandon any active connection with my Mother Lodge. I write to ask you to forward a Clearance Certificate to enable me to join ‘Lodge Independence with Philanthropy’ at this Station, and also to send my Grand Lodge Certificate to the Master of that Lodge when it arrives. I have of course no intention of withdrawing my name from the Lodge Roll and shall be obliged if you would have me put down as an Absent Brother.\n\n“I send herewith Rs. 24 P.M., subscription and shall always look back with keen pleasure to my Masonic life in âLodge Hope and Perseveranceâ, and, if at any time, I can do anything to further its aims and objects, am entirely at your disposal. Convey my warmest and most fraternal regards to the Brethren and\n\nBelieve me\n\nYours faithfully and fraternally,\n\n(Sgd.) RUDYARD KIPLING.â\n\n10. THE SECRETARY was directed to comply with Bro. Kiplingâs request and to reply to his letter thanking him warmly for his kind offer and expressing regret that his altered circumstances has deprived us of his valuable assistance and genial companionship.\n\n(Sgd.) F. Koenig, W.M. (M.B.)\n\nIt seems certain that Kipling fully intended to pursue his Masonic career in his new environment, while remaining on the Roll of No. 782 as an âAbsent Brotherâ (probably a status equal to âcountry-membershipâ), but that was not to be. He was recalled to duty at the Civil & Military Gazette and there followed a brief spell at Lahore, deputizing for Robinson, who was absent on sick-leave. It is recorded that he attended, for the last time, at his Mother Lodge, No. 782, in May, 1888, acting as Inner Guard[18] (MB/N.) The heat of the summer months became intolerable and Kipling went off for a three-week stay at Simla, which was doubly enjoyable because he had already made up his mind to go to England. He returned to Allahabad, where his pleasure in the company of the Hills (he had been living with them during most of 1888) was marred by Mrs. Hillâs sudden and serious illness. On her recovery she decided to convalesce at her home in Pennsylvania, and, on hearing this, Kipling resolved to travel east-about to England, going with them to America, en route. Introductions to friends in the U.S.A. were showered on him.\n\nHe joined the Lodge Independence with Philanthropy, No. 391, at Allahabad, on April 17th, 1888. At that time it was the fourth largest Lodge under the District Grand Lodge of Bengal, with 35 members. The largest Lodge had only 50 members, and the records show that several Bengal Lodges were in abeyance and others were having great difficulty because of their small memberships. (M.R.W.I., vol. xxiv, p. 449.) No. 391 was a âmixedâ Lodge with a substantial proportion of non-European members,[19] and it is fairly certain that Kipling would have been very happy there, but his active participation in the work of the Lodge lasted, in fact, less than a year, because of his projected trip to England. (He never returned to Allahabad, and resigned from the Lodge on 31st December, 1895).\n\nIn February, 1889, he went home to Lahore for a farewell visit, and soon afterwards went down to Calcutta. The March, 1889, minutes of Hope and Perseverance record:â\n\nAt the Regular Meeting of the Lodge held on Monday, 4th March 1889. Worshipful Master: W.Bro. F. Koenig.\n\n8. THE WORSHIPFUL MASTER stated that he had received a card from Bro. RUDYARD KIPLING stating that he was leaving the Province permanently and wished to resign. Directed that it be acknowledged with regret. (M.B.)\n\nKipling resigned from his Mark and Ark Mariner Lodges three months later, on 30th June, 1889.[20]\n\nOn March 9th, 1889, he went aboard the S.S. Madura with Prof. and Mrs. Hill for the beginning of a happy holiday, enlivened by the society of his friends. His time was filled by his unending interest in the mechanism of the ship and in the men who kept it moving, as well as the yarns of the variegated travellers in the bars and smoking-rooms. They passed through Rangoon, Penang, Singapore, Hong Kong, and stayed a whole month in Japan, each halt making an indelible impression on his photographic mind and leaving a store of colour, sights and sounds that enriched so much of his later work. They left Japan for San Francisco, and there, in the course of newspaper interviews, Kipling carelessly let fall various items of too-ready and immature criticism of American affairs, which made him an unpopular target in the American press.\n\nThe Hills left him at San Francisco to finish their journey by train, and Kipling remained in the care of Mrs. Carr, a friend of his mother, who introduced him into wealthy and influential society, and to professional men, journalists and writers, who found him a boon companion. After a few days he went off for a fishing holiday to Portland, Oregon, and then into British Columbia, where a smart piece of salesmanship left him owning a plot of land in Vancouver City which was certainly not worth what he had paid for it.\n\nWriting articles all the while for his paper, he travelled leisurely across America until he arrived eventually at the little town of Beaver Falls, Pa., where Mrs. Hill was living with her parents. Kipling stayed with the family for two months, and there he met Mrs. Hillâs young sister, Caroline Taylor, a plump and cheerful girl. Continuing his travels in the Eastern States, his closer acquaintance with the country and its people brought him to a real liking for what he saw and a somewhat jingoist view of the importance of the âAnglo-Saxon all round the worldâ. The appearance of several favourable reviews of his works must have pleased him greatly, but at this period a pirated version of Plain Tales was published in the U.S.A., the first of a whole series of similar outrages, which, allowing for his poverty at the time and his inability to obtain legal redress, was an understandable source of exasperation.[21] An introduction to Henry Harper, head of the New York publishing house, led to an interview which was quickly ended by Harperâs brutal rudeness. Happily, âHe never had to ask a favour of an American publisher again.â (C.C., p. 132.)\n\nMeanwhile, Carrie Taylor had decided to go to India with her sister, and at the end of September, 1889, all four, the Hills, Carrie and Kipling, took ship for England, arriving in London in early October. There, Kipling left his friends to take a short holiday in Paris. On his return to London he moved into two rooms at the foot of Villiers Street, overlooking the embankment, only a few doors from the London office of the Pioneer. Mrs. Hill and Carrie helped him to settle in before they went off to India.\n\nKipling had few friends in London, and he was lonely, short of money and too proud to ask for help. His letters to Mrs. Hill at this time betray his loneliness and nostalgia for India, which persisted long after he had won his place in London literary circles. His letters to Carrie show that he was falling in love with her, not surprising, perhaps, in view of his lack of young feminine company during those important years. Andrew Lang, who had reviewed some of Kiplingâs earlier work, took him to the Savile Club, the haunt of editors and writers, and this resulted in an introduction to Sampson Low, who arranged to publish an English edition of his six volumes, but on rather unfavourable terms. More useful introductions came to him through Wheeler, his former chief at Lahore, now on the staff of the St. Jamesâs Gazette, and from Mowbray Morris, editor of Macmillanâs Magazine. Wheeler took him to Sidney Low, who later described his first evening with Kipling, at Sweetingâs in Fleet Street, where, with very little persuasion, Kipling began to talk of India and his travels, and soon had half the room as his audience. Two of his poems, both under pseudonyms, were published by Macmillan, and soon he counted the best of literary London among his friends.\n\nTrix, now married, visited him in London in February, 1890, and was shocked to find him in poor health and low spirits. He had met his first love, Flo Garrard, by chance in London, and had realized that she still meant a great deal to him. Perhaps his attachment to Carrie was of too rapid a growth to withstand their separation, or its roots may have been too shallow. Whatever the reasons, his estrangement from her was complete by this time. He resumed his courtship of Flo Garrard, without hope of success, because she was interested in nothing but her own career as an artist. He confided all this to Trix, but his only refuge was in his work, which he pursued ââ¦ with a sort of furyâ.\n\nHis visits to his aunts and cousins were rare and pleasurable interludes, though they introduced him into good society whereâas usualâhe was made much of. Publishersâ doors were being opened to him and he had enough commissioned work in hand to be assured of a modest livelihood. A splendid review of his works in the London Times in March, 1890, described him as a writer who had âtapped a new vein, and â¦ worked it out with real originalityâ. It led to a Kipling boom in London, while the re-issue of his early works in America went on more strongly than ever. Kipling had arrived! He was twenty-five years old, with a collection of prose and verse behind him, including Plain Tales from the Hills and the Departmental Ditties, which had made his reputation from India to America.\n\nHe sent a cryptic telegram to his parents announcing his success and inviting them to come to England. The message was a gem of its kind; it ran: âGenesis xlv, 9, 10, 13.â The first of those verses reads; âHaste ye and go up to my father and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph; God hath made me lord of all Egypt; come down unto me, tarry not.â\n\nNothing could have been more apposite, and his choice of the quotation reveals a very useful knowledge of the Bible.\n\nIn May, 1890, his parents came to London and the âfamily squareâ was happily re-united. It is strange that thisâthe period of his first real taste of successâwas the time when he published The Light That Failed, which contained the story of his involvement with Flo Garrard, and much autobiographical material, yet tinged with occasional bitterness and cruelty, wholly out of keeping with his character.\n\nMARRIAGE AND FAME\n\nAround 1890, Kipling met Wolcott Balestier, a charming and talented young journalistâturned publisherâwho had captured literary London. Balestier, an American, with a sure foresight of the young authorâs potentialities, set himself to make friends with Kipling, and he succeeded, despite Rudyardâs justifiable distrust of publishersâespecially American. Soon there was talk of their collaborating in a novel, which appeared about two years later as The Naulahkaâa book based on America and Indiaâwhich gave them both good opportunity for their individual talents. As agent for an American publishing house, Balestier actually persuaded Kipling to write a happy ending to The Light That Failedâa commercial move which nobody else in Rudyardâs circle could have achieved.\n\nBalestierâs family visited England to share in his success and Kipling visited them often; but it was in Wolcottâs office that he first met Caroline Balestier, Wolcottâs sisterâa quiet, competent and forceful young woman, who made such an impression on Kiplingâs mother that she instantly predicted, without enthusiasm, but correctly, as it transpired, âThat young woman is going to marry our Ruddy.â\n\nKiplingâs health was very bad at this time and he was troubled with constant recurrence of malaria and dysentery, with mental exhaustion resulting from the great pressure of work since his arrival in England. On medical advice he took a short voyage to America with one of his Macdonald uncles, Kipling travelling under the name of J. Macdonald for the sake of privacy. The stratagem failed; his eyebrows and moustache made him too easily recognizable, and when he found that his arrival was already publicized in New Yorkâknowing he was not fit to face the intrusion of reportersâhe returned immediately to England.\n\nIn July, 1891, he stayed with the Balestiers at their home in the Isle of Wight, and it is fairly certain that by this time he and Carrie had come to an understandingâwhich was not made public, however. In August, still in pursuit of health, he set out on a voyage round the world. He made a brief and pleasant stay in Cape Town, where he met Cecil Rhodes, who ultimately became a great friend. On to New Zealand and Tasmania, Australia and back to Colombo, with a train journey of four days and nights through India to Lahore, where he arrived for a Christmas reunion with his parents.\n\nBut soon after his arrival he received a cable from Caroline to say that Wolcott had died of typhoid while on a business trip to Dresden. Kipling did not stay for Christmas and managed to get back to England in 14 days, a notable feat at that time. Meanwhile, Carrie had taken charge; ââ¦ a little person of extraordinary capacity who will float them all successfully homeâ, said Henry James in one of his letters, paying tribute to her â. . force, acuteness . . and courageâ.\n\nKipling arrived in London in January, 1892, and they immediately arranged to marry within eight days, by special licence. An influenza epidemic was raging, and only one cousin, âAmboâ Poynter, attended (as best man), with Henry James, Edmund Gosse and William Heinemann as the only friends present at the ceremony at All Soulsâ, Langham Place. The newly-weds parted at the church door, because Carrie had to nurse her mother. Their wedding party was a small family lunch heâd two days later.\n\nFrom this time on, Kiplingâs story cannot be told or read without the constant reminder of this masterful and devoted woman in the background. She watched his health, shielded him from intruders, kept his accounts, managed their homes and their many moves, and bore him three children. All that was, of course, in the future, but it is noteworthy that the majority of writers on the Kiplings are agreed that it was he who got the best of the bargain.\n\nRudyard was now comfortably off, with Â£2,000 in the bank and with many publishersâ contracts in his pocket, and the couple set off for a honeymoon voyage round the world, Kipling taking the final chapters of The Naulahka[22] to prepare them for the press en route.\n\nAs part of their tour they stopped off at Brattleboroâ, Vermont, headquarters and home of the Balestier family, staying a few days with Carrieâs younger brother, Beatty Balestier, and his wife. Beatty conveyed a 10-acre plot of the family land to them for a nominal sum, and they continued their trip through Chicago to Canada, Kipling paying his way by his travel sketches, which were now far more profitable than on his first American visit. Reporters sought him constantly and were kept at bay by Carrie, now his business manager. And so, on to Japan and Yokohama, where their joyous holiday was rudely interrupted by the failure of Kiplingâs bank, with the loss of his lifeâs savings, nearly Â£2,000.[23] They were stranded in Japan with only their return tickets, some Â£10 sterling and 100 dollars in a New York bank. Lack of cash was no longer a serious worry, because there was a ready and constant demand for everything Kipling wrote, and hospitality was showered on the young couple everywhere. They stayed another three weeks in Japan, but cancelled the remainder of their honeymoon.\n\nBack to Vermont, where, in a house rented at 10 dollars a month, with a Swedish maid at 18 dollars per month, they lived in spartan simplicity for a year.\n\nIn April, 1892, the Barrack-Room Ballads were published; they were three times reprinted in that year and fifty times more in the next thirty years. As usual, a pirated edition had appeared in the U.S.A. before the authorized English edition came out in 1892! But Kipling did very little new writing in their honeymoon year. The Naulahka began to bring in a useful and rapidly-growing income and money was flowing in rapidly from Kiplingâs earlier work. Now much of their time was spent in planning, with a New York architect friend, a new house that was to be built on their 10-acre plot.\n\nThe Kiplings visited the Balestier family often and they were much attached to Beattyâs little daughter, but Beatty himself, a gay, extravagant and intemperate fellow, did not get on well with his sister Carrie, who treated him as an irresponsible boy, doling out his share of Naulahka dividends in petty sums, as a deliberate means of controlling his extravagance.\n\nBefore the new house was ready, their first child, Josephine, was born in December, 1892. That year was also made happy for them by a visit from John Lockwood Kipling, Rudyardâs father, now retired, and the two men went off for a trip into Canada, leaving Carrie to prepare and supervise the removal into their new home, âNaulhakhaâ.\n\nFather and son got on famously together, and Rudyard, as always, was ready and glad to have his fatherâs help, which was quite invaluable in artistic and certain technical matters. This was the period which gave rise to the Jungle Booksâthe best-sellers of all Kiplingâs works. Now, after a period of comparative rest and with the assurance of real prosperity, Kipling had again got into his stride with the âreturn of a feeling of great strengthâ. At this time he wrote some of his most notable verse and balladsâwork which would have brought him fame if he had not achieved it already. He could now command $100 per thousand words, a very high rate in those days, and Scribnerâs paid him $500 for his dramatic poem, MâAndrewâs Hymn.\n\nAfter a brief holiday in Bermuda, Rudyard and Carrie crossed to England in 1894, moving into a house at Tisbury, Wiltshire, where Rudyardâs parents had settled in retirement. In their frequent visits to London, the Kiplings were lionized and fÃªted. Back to the light, quiet and peace of Naulakha, they lived comfortably with their little daughter, enjoying the society of a few close friends. Rudyard noted in Carrieâs diary, in December, 1894, that he had earned $25,000 (Â£5,000), a great sum in those days.\n\nThe interminable intrusions of summer-visitors, sightseers and journalists eventually drove Carrie to sell her husbandâs autographs at $2.50 each for charity, in the hope of avoiding the nuisanceâbut that was misinterpreted as a publicity device, and it attracted abusive comment.\n\nEarly in 1896 the Kiplings took a six-week holiday in Washington, D.C., while Carrie recuperated after a furnace accident. There they were made welcome in the very best of American society, but Kipling, on a visit to the White House, was disgusted by the company he met among President Clevelandâs associates. This disenchantment was largely compensated for by the close friendship he formed with âTeddyâ Roosevelt.\n\nOn their return home, a serious money quarrel arose between Carrie and her brother over his careless stewardship of the house during their absence, and the two families were no longer on speaking termsâa real discomfort because they were such close neighbours. Meanwhile, the Anglo-American dispute over the Venezuela-British Guiana borders led to a great deal of bad feeling on both sides of the Atlantic, and the Kiplings began to plan a return to England; but that had to be deferred, as Carrie was expecting the birth of her second child. Their daughter, Elsie, was born in February, 1896.\n\nKipling was busy meanwhile on Captains Courageous, an all-American story in characters and setting, which grew largely out of his friendship with Dr. Conland, their family physician. The rift with the Balestiers had widened and about this time Beatty was made bankrupt. The newsmen swooped, scenting a story, but Kipling refused to be interviewed. âAmerican reviewing is brutal and immoral â¦ Is it not enough to steal my books without intruding on my private life?â\n\nDuring the winter he played golf in the snow, with red balls, and learned to skiâon the first skis in Vermontâsent to him by Conan Doyle. Later in the year he took up the fashionable sport of cycling, and in May, 1896, an accidental spill on a road near his home led to a face-to-face meeting with Beatty, who, in an ungovernable rage, threatened to shoot Kipling. Very unwisely, Kipling laid information against his brother-in-law for threatening to kill him, and Beatty was arrested next day. The ensuing court proceedings brought the Kiplings the most frantic and unwelcome publicity, which was aggravated by Rudyardâs impulsive and ill-advised behaviour throughout the whole of this trying period. The case was adjourned for trial, but nothing came of it because they left the U.S.A. before it came up for hearing. They had had four happy years in Vermont, but the miseries of the family quarrel finally drove them back to England, where they arrived in September, 1896, staying at a rented house near Torquay.\n\nTORQUAY AND ROTTINGDEAN\n\nIt was a barrack of a house after the beauty and comfort of Naulakha, but there was compensation in the visits they had from their family and friends. John Lockwood Kipling set up a studio in their coach-house, moving over from Tisbury to help his son with a projected illustrated edition of his works. Living not far from Dartmouth, Rudyard was invited to cruise with the Channel Squadron, andâalways an avid collector of the data that might form the background to his storiesâhe began zealously to master naval and engine-room techniques.\n\nKipling had maintained his membership of Lodge Independence with Philanthropy, No. 391, Allahabad, since 1888, but he resigned on 31st December, 1895. It had been his only Lodge during those years, and, so far as all known records go, he became an unattached Brother, remaining in that status for the next four years. The details of his subsequent Masonic affiliations are given below.\n\nIn the winter of 1896 he did not do very much work, although he was now feeling much better (doubtless because of his distance from the troublesome Beatty). He was elected to the Athenaeum at the age of 31, their youngest member, and on the night of his admission he dined there with Cecil Rhodes, Alfred Milner and the Editor of The Times. Two months later, with Carrie expecting the birth of their third child, Rudyard began to look around in Kent and Sussex for a new home, and in June, 1897, they moved into North End House, Rottingdean, at the centre of a large group of relativesâand accessible to their friends. It was Queen Victoriaâs Diamond Jubilee year and the publication in the Times of his Recessional attracted admiration far surpassing Kiplingâs earlier triumphs. Now his name was being voiced as a possible Poet Laureate.\n\nTheir third child, a son, John, was born in August, 1897, and, at Christmas, Kipling wrote in Carrieâs diary that this year was âIn all ways the richest to us two personallyâ. In January the happy pair embarked for a winter holiday in South Africa, which opened a new sphere of interest for Kipling. It was followed soon afterwards by a summer cruise for Rudyard with the Channel Squadron, which proved a great personal triumph for him.\n\nThis year saw the publication of his poem, The White Manâs Burden, another triumph. It was the first appearance in print of that now-famous phrase, one of a whole series of verses with a strong imperialistic tone, typical of some earlier Indian verse, but always urging the sense of responsibility and duty that ought to over-ride all tangible reward.\n\nIn February, 1899, they set off on a visit to New York â Carrie to see her mother, and Rudyard to deal with a copyright dispute which led to a long, expensive and fruitless lawsuit. Unwisely, they had decided to take the three children with them and, after a fearful crossing, arrived at their New York hotel with all the children ill from whooping-cough. Carrie herself fell ill, but she shook it off for the sake of the children. Dr. Conland arrived from Vermont, bringing the news that Beatty was threatening to sue Kipling for $50,000 for malicious arrest. Josephine, the eldest child, developed pneumonia and was sent off to Long Island in the care of Conland; Elsie also showed symptoms, but soon recovered; while John, the baby, became ill with bronchitis. Family and business worries proved too much for Kipling, and he, too, succumbed with an inflammation of the lungs which rapidly deterioratedâso that he became delirious and dangerously ill. The news could not be kept from the press and traffic outside their hotel was blocked by crowds of sympathizers. Letters and messages flowed in from all parts of the world and the hotel lobby was crowded with reporters. Prayers were said for Kipling in the churches and people were seen to kneel before the hotel doors to pray for him. Neverâeven for Royaltyâhad there been such a spontaneous proof of affection and admiration. Carrie, despite all her courage and competence, was desperate, and Frank Doubleday, the New York publisher and their dear friend, neglected his own affairs to act as secretary and manager for Carrie while she looked after the children.\n\nOn March 4th, Kipling was at last declared out of danger, though still very ill, but two days later Josephine died. Many months passed before Kipling was fully restored to healthâbut neither he nor Carrie ever recovered from the shock of Josephineâs death. In May, Kipling was fit to return to England under orders to take a six-monthsâ rest, and Doubleday, with his wife, made the journey with them and did not leave them until they were settled back in their own home. Andrew Carnegie wrote offering them the use of a small house in the Scottish Highlands, and there Rudyard mended slowly and settled down gradually to work again.\n\nOn October 4th, 1899, doubtless as a result of his residence in Scotland, Kipling was elected an Honorary Member of Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, No. 2 (S.C.), andârare honourâhe was made Poet Laureate of the Lodge (1905â8), thereby joining a distinguished band of Brethren of whom Robert Burns was the first, in 1787â1796. There is no evidence, unfortunately, of his visiting the Lodge, but ill-health and family troubles would explain that.\n\nIn October, 1899, Stalky & Co. was published, adding a new facet to his fame because it was so obviously autobiographical, but it met with a mixed reception and, as a picture of school life, many critics found it distasteful. Kipling was now at the height of his fame; social invitations were showered upon himâand mainly refused. It had been a sad and bitter year for them, and they needed quiet and seclusion.\n\nTHE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR: KIPLING THE IMPERIALIST\n\nIn September, 1899, on the eve of the Boer War, Kipling published a poem, The Old Issue, in which he urged that the quarrel with Kruger was a fight for liberty and against tyranny. Some part of this must have had it roots in a native imperialism which was an inherent part of his background; but there is no doubt that it was also inspired by his unbounded admiration for the Empire-builders, the men with the machines and tools, the road-makers, the bridge-builders and the engineers.\n\nWhen war was declared he started the Soldiersâ Familiesâ Fund, and his poem, The Absent-Minded Beggar, set to music by Sir Arthur Sullivan, helped to raise nearly a quarter-of-a-million pounds for the fund. Never a seeker after limelight, he now shunned publicity, and when Harmsworth, of the Daily Mail, wanted to give the poem and its author publicity in aid of the fund, Kipling wrote asking that his name should be kept out.\n\nâThe verses are fetching money in a wonderful wayâthanks to your managementâbut donât make so much of their author.â[24]\n\nIn January, 1900, he left with Carrie for a trip to South Africa, including a tour of the Military Hospitals, and he was there just in time to welcome Rhodes on his release after the raising of the siege of Kimberley. Rhodes spoke of his plan to build a house at Groote Schoor for artists and writers who would stay there as his guests, and offered them the house when ready. Carrie accepted enthusiastically and went off with the architect to select a site.\n\nAt the Battle of Paardeberg, Kipling went up to the Modder River rail-head on an ambulance train, returning with a trainload of wounded men, his first direct experience of the horrors of war. There is an interesting note regarding Kiplingâs visit to Bloemfontein in the Transactions of the Authorsâ Lodge, vol. v, p. 226. It speaks of Conan Doyleâs services during the South African War, when he was Medical Officer to the Langham Field Hospital. He was ââ¦ one of the brethren who formed the never-to-be-forgotten Emergency Lodge held at Bloemfontein in company with Bro. Rudyard Kipling and other notable Masons.â It has proved impossible to trace any further details of this particular Lodge meeting. With the gradual success of the campaign, Lord Roberts resolved to start an Army newspaper and he wired Kipling inviting him to join the staff of the new journal. Kipling accepted a temporary post as sub-editor for the few weeks that remained of his stay in South Africa and wrote a number of pieces for the paper, The Friend, enjoying himself enormously in the company of his congenial colleagues. The dry, warm climate suited him and he flourished.\n\nBack at Rottingdean, his writings at this period had a strong political flavour, but towards the end of 1900 he was preparing to publish Kim, his last work on India, a task which had engaged him intermittently for some years. It is an adventure story in which the plot is of minor importance, but it furnished the opportunity for a study of an enormous variety of people in circumstances which enabled Kipling to depict the life, colour and atmosphere of his beloved India, and something of the mysticism and the complexities of character of its population.\n\nAt the end of 1900 the Kiplings were back in South Africa and moved into âThe Woolsackâ, the dream-cottage that Rhodes had placed at their disposal, their happiest environment for many years.[25] Meanwhile, the war dragged on, bringing many unpleasant shocks, despite the general success of Lord Robertsâ campaign after the opening disasters. Kipling, deeply touched by the losses that had been suffered through the inexperience of the soldiers and the inefficiency of their officers, wrote The Army of a Dream, a vision of England trained and prepared for war, with an awakening at the end reminding the readers that the men who might have made this possible had thrown away their lives in the recent holocausts.\n\nA year later, in December, 1901, his poem, The Islanders, pursued the theme still further, as a plea for less interest in sport and more in national service and defence. His reference in that poem to âflannelled fools and muddied oafsâ aroused great criticism and antipathy, but Kipling was never afraid to say what he thought.\n\nIn March, 1902, Rhodes died, and Kipling wrote the verses which are inscribed on his tomb. Rudyard had lost a great friend, more especially one whose hopes for the outcome of the war coincided with his own, of a land settled by the men who would bring a new prosperity. His war poems, soldier ballads and stories of this period often reflect this feeling.\n\nLater in 1902 the Kiplings settled in at their best and happiest home in England, âBatemanâs,â at Burwash, in Sussex. By this time they had bought their second car, and motoring adventures and misadventures appear frequently in some of Rudyardâs stories of this period.\n\nThe war ended, and the inevitable reaction that followed it enabled Kipling to relax at âBatemanâsâ. After the publication, in 1903, of his book of South African verse, The Five Nations, he began to apply himself to his writing in a new and more controlled style. There was no longer any hurry to publish and he held his work back, cutting and revising until he was fully satisfied. His genius ranged from far-seeing science fiction to childrenâs tales and his work took on an even wider varietyâoccasionally with a kind of obscurityâyet with a breadth of vision and appeal that kept him high on the list of the worldâs story-tellers.\n\nThe Conservative landslide in the General Election of 1906 and the subsequent elections in South Africa were a great blow to the Kiplings, and they made their last stay at the âWoolsackâ in April, 1908.\n\nKIPLING THE POLITICIAN: THE WORLD WAR\n\nIt seems strange that Kipling, whose conscientious mastery of intricate technical matters enabled him to write with facility on all sorts of subjects, could never bring himself to âwrite to orderâ. This may have been one of the reasons why he never became Poet Laureate; it certainly prevented him from taking any kind of public office that might limit his freedom to write and say what he thought. He refused Parliamentary constituencies, and he refused two invitations to travel in the Royal entourage on State visits to India. A Knighthood (K.C.B.) had been offered him, and refused, in 1899. The K.C.M.G. was similarly refused in 1904.\n\nHe did, however, accept academic honours, and in 1907â8 he and Carrie spent much time in travelling to ceremonial occasions at the Universities, including a trip to Canada to accept a doctorate at McGill. That trip was combined with a lecture-tour to Canadian Clubs, in which he continued to expound a facet of his Imperialist ideasâexhorting them to understand and accept their responsibilities.\n\nIn 1908 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature, a great honour which carried, in those days, a grant of some Â£7,700.\n\nIn July, 1909, Kipling joined the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, a purely Christian society, open to Master Masons ââ¦ of high moral character â¦ [and] â¦ of sufficient ability to be capable of understanding the revelations of philosophy, theosophy and science, possessing a mind free from prejudice and anxious for instruction â¦â This brief quotation sufficiently demonstrates the range of studies which fall within the Societyâs nine grades and it shows that Kipling was ready to explore far beyond the normal range of Masonic study.\n\nOne of the conditions of entry is that the Candidate must be âa subscribing member of a Regular Lodge under the Grand Lodge of England or under a jurisdiction in amity therewith â¦â This poses a problem because, so far as all known records go, Kipling was not a subscribing member of a Lodge at that time. By courtesy of the Secretary of S.R.I.A. (himself a member of the Kipling Society), we are able to reproduce Kiplingâs autographed Application Form, and it will be noted that he described himself as a member of Lodge Hope and Perseverance, No. 782, although he had resigned from that Lodge in 1889!\n\nKiplingâs Declaration Form on joining Societas Rosicrucians\n\nReproduced by kind permission of the Supreme Magus. S.R.I.A.\n\nThe Application Form also contains the motto, chosen by Kipling for that occasion, âFortuna non virtuteâ, a modest note which may be freely translated, âBy good Fortune, not by Meritâ.\n\nThe Authorsâ Lodge, No. 3456, was founded in 1910, and apparently Kipling was invited either to be a founder or to attend the Consecration. He was unable to be present, and the report of the Consecration (Freemasonsâ Chronicle, November, 1910) records that letters were received from Kipling and many other prominent authors of that period, sending their greetings and good wishes[26]\n\nA careful check of the Transactions of the Authorsâ Lodge reveals that he made no contributions to their work, but he is listed as an Honorary Member of the Lodge in the Transactions, vol. iv, which cover the period 1918 to 1928. There is no record of the precise date of election.\n\nHis mother died at Tisbury in 1910, followed early in 1911 by his father. Though he was devoted to his parents, he had seen less of them in recent years, being fully occupied with his work and in the tight circle of his own family. One wonders if this may have been due to a possible coldness between Carrie and her mother-in-law.\n\nFrom 1909 to 1914 his active interest in right-wing Conservative politics kept him fully occupied. His dislike of Liberal policies, strikes and the troubles in Ireland provided him with ample ammunition, and he wrote no longer as a spokesman for the âlittle manâ or the âunderdogâ, but as a propagandist for the Tory Party. He was a friend of Baden-Powell, and became a Commissioner and an active supporter of the Boy Scout movement, as well as of the National Service League, the latter an unpopular cause in those days. In May, 1914, a wild and intemperate anti-Liberal speech to 10,000 people at Tunbridge Wells brought him a great deal of adverse publicity, bringing embarrassment to himself and to his own party.\n\nWhen war was declared, young John Kipling, not yet 17, went up to London to offer himself for a Commission, but his weak sight prevented this. Kipling thereupon wrote to Lord Roberts, and with his influence the lad was nominated to their friendâs own regiment, the Irish Guards. The Kiplings, with their daughter Elsie, were busy meanwhile at âBatemanâsâ on work for the Red Cross and for the Belgian Refugees. Rudyard now began a tour of the Military Hospitals and Training Camps in England, writing articles for the Daily Telegraph and stories based on incidents of the war.\n\nThe family made frequent trips to London, where John could come in from his barracks to meet them.\n\nIn August, 1915, Rudyard was invited to visit the French Armies in the field. He met Clemenceau, Briand and General Nivelle, and had a warm reception everywhere, being easily recognized, because his works were as well known in France as in England. On his return there was an invitation from the Admiralty to Kipling to write about the Royal Navyâapparently in the hope of satisfying the Allies of the activities of the âSilent Serviceâ. He made visits to the Dover Patrol and the Harwich Flotilla, and, on returning home, fell ill with gastritis.\n\nOn October 2nd, 1915, a telegram arrived from the War Office reporting that John was wounded and missing after the Battle of Loos. After a few days, Kipling returned to his work, the only anodyne, while awaiting further information. Two years passed before they had the full story. The lad had been shot through the head in action when his Company forced its way into a gap between Hill Seventy and Hulluch. After the agonized years of waiting and incessant inquiries, the parents, numbed and broken, sought refuge more than ever within themselves, with Elsie as the only comfort left to them.\n\nKipling made several visits to quiet sections of the Front, to the Grand Fleet in Scottish waters, and to the Naval establishments at Dover and Harwich. Apart from his war journalism, his best work of this period consisted of Naval songs and ballads. In 1917 he began work on a history of the Irish Guards, his sonâs regiment, and, in the same year, made a visit to Italy to collect material for the story of the Italian campaign, The War in the Mountains. In this year, too, he wrote âIn the Interests of the Brethrenâ, by far the best of his Masonic writings, rich in sympathy and full of understanding of the needs of the men who were actually fighting in the war.[27] Following the confirmation of the death of his own son, one may imagine his anguish when he wrote of the principal character, L. H. Burges, of Burges and Son, ââ¦ but Son had been killed in Egyptâ.\n\nIn September, 1917, he was invited to join the Imperial War Graves Commission, of which he was a diligent member for the last 18 years of his life; indeed, it was he who chose for them the inscription, âTheir Name Liveth for Evermore.â\n\nââ¦ never before had war exacted such a terrible toll of death never before had a permanent organization for the care of their graves been needed in peace-time â¦ among the graves under its care were those of men and women of many nations and of many religions â¦ and by the nature of its task it [had to be] free from religious partiality.â [28]\n\nThe newly-formed Commission made its Headquarters just outside St. Omer, and in January, 1922, a Lodge was consecrated at St. Omer as No. 12 on the Register of the Grande Loge Nationale IndÃ©pendante et RÃ©guliÃ¨re pour la France et les Colonies FranÃ§aises (now the G.L.N.F.). Among the founders of the Lodge was Rudyard Kipling, and it was to his inspiration that the Lodge owes its name, âThe Builders of the Silent Citiesâ, which so beautifully expresses the vocation of its members, âwhose sympathetic labour it is to construct and maintain permanent resting places for â¦ the valiant dead of the British Empire who fell in the Great Warâ.\n\nThe first two Initiates of the Lodge were Major-General Sir Fabian Ware, Vice-Chairman and Chief Horticultural Officer of the Commission, and Captain J. S. Parker (from whose sonâs work these notes have been reproduced). As a tribute to Kipling, the Lodge adopted a modified form of the âSussex Workingâ of the Third Degree; Kipling was then a Sussex man and it was believed to be his favourite âworkingâ,[29] but, in fact, his interest was in the Commission itself, rather than the Lodge, though he retained his membership of No. 12 until his death.[30]\n\nHe was invited to become one of the Rhodes Trustees (for the Rhodes Scholarships at Oxford), an honour which he accepted willingly because both he and Carrie had taken a deep interest with Rhodes in the scheme when he was planning it. On June 28th, 1918, the Motherland Lodge, No. 3861, was consecrated at Freemasonsâ Hall, London, ââ¦ to signalise â¦ the coming together of the English speaking family of nations to fight side by side on behalf of liberty and right, against wrong and oppressionâ. Kipling had been invited to attend, but he is listed among the Brethren who sent letters of apology. According to custom, the Consecrating Officers were made Honorary Members of the Lodge and presented with Foundersâ Jewels. âA similar honour was conferred onâ [various distinguished visitors, as well as] âBro. Rudyard Kipling (who had personally selected for inclusion in the souvenir of the meeting a verse from his âSong of the Native-bornâ).â (Freemasonsâ Chronicle, 20th July, 1918, pp. 28â30.) The Secretary of the Lodge reports that, despite the Honorary Membership, there is no record of Kipling ever visiting the Lodge, or of his taking any practical interest in it thereafter.\n\nWar work and war journalism kept Kipling busy, leaving him little time for his ordinary literary work, and his best work of this period is in verse, especially those pieces which were highly critical of the errors and mismanagements of the war. When it was ended, Carrie wrote in her diary, âa world to be remade â¦ without a sonâ.\n\nFINALE\n\nThe family returned to âBatemanâsâ as to a refugeâRudyard in poor health, and Carrie a diligent guardian and a constant shield against intruders. But theirs was not a hermit existence. There was a constant stream of visits from their closest intimates; Johnâs army colleagues came, and the children of their relatives and friends. Airmen came to visit and to discuss the world air-routes that Kipling had predicted so long before. Stanley Baldwin, his cousin, serving under Bonar Lawâs Government, came to offer him âany honour he will acceptâ, but he steadfastly refused.\n\nIn December, 1921, he was offered the Order of Merit, an honour in the Kingâs personal gift, tendered in a charming letter from Lord Stamfordham. Refused, it was offered again in 1924 and refused again, but the Kingâs admiration for Kipling and his work was not harmed by this stubborn independence.\n\nIn 1920 the family resumed their motor-tours in France, giving Kipling an opportunity to make personal inspection of more than 30 cemeteries under the War Graves Commission, on which he reported and advised. They also paid a visit to Loos to identify the spot where John had died.\n\nIn 1921 they went to Paris, where Kipling accepted a Doctorate of the University of Paris, and was fÃªted as a national hero by the social and political leaders of France. In 1922 they accompanied the King and Queen on their pilgrimage to the War Cemeteries, and Rudyard had the opportunity of a long private conversation with the King. Thereafter, his work on the Irish Guards being finished, the customary exhaustion followed and he was troubled again with gastric illness, which had been an intermittent source of discomfort for many years. He settled down at âBatemansâ, a listless and bedridden invalidâwith no interest, even in politics.\n\nDuring this period the New York World published details of a supposed interview with Clare Sheridan, reporting Kiplingâs views on Anglo-American relations, and that he had charged that America had come into the war too late and withdrawn too soon, with other observations equally unpalatable to the friends of both countries. It is possible that Kipling had indeed aired his views during an informal and private tea-time visit by Clare Sheridan to Burwash. If so, his words were certainly âoff-the-recordâ ; but they became front-page news in the world Press, to Carrieâs great distress, because her husband was too ill to deal with the matter. It was also a great embarrassment to the Government, at a time when relations with the U.S.A. were delicate. Eventually, Kipling sent a notice to the Press saying that he had not given an interview and denying that he had said the words attributed to him.\n\nA severe recurrence of his illness led to a surgical operation, followed by several months of convalescence and a sea trip to Cannes, where he gradually recovered his health and began work again. At this period he wrote The Janeites, another âStalkyâ story, and several war stories, published in 1926 as Debits and Credits. Fashions had changed since his last book had been published some nine years before, and the new book had small success at first, though it steadily moved into favour afterwards. His zeal for compression, generally a virtue in a story-writer, when carried to extremes often made his work obscure and cryptic. Another volume of stories (published in 1932) was clearly the work of a tired and ageing invalid.\n\nIn 1926 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Society of Literatureâan honour shared only with Scott, Meredith and Hardy. A year later, somewhat to Kiplingâs displeasure, the Kipling Society was formed, with General Dunsterville, âStalkyâ himself, as its first President. Much of the familyâs time in the next years was spent in motor-tours and voyages in search of sunshine.\n\nIn 1925 the War Graves Commission opened a new Head Office in London and many of the senior members of No. 12 (France) found themselves transferred to England. This led to the formation of a London Lodge under the same title as its sister Lodge in France. Builders of the Silent Cities Lodge, No. 4948, was consecrated in December, 1927, and Kipling, still deeply interested in the work of the Commission, was one of its founders. But there is no evidence that he attended the Consecration or that he ever attended or took active part in the work of the Lodge. (He resigned in 1935, shortly before his death.)\n\nRudyardâs last serious work was done in the early months of 1932, and now, as though he knew that the sands were running out for him, he began to tidy up, arranging a new volume of Collected Verse, as well as A Pageant of Kipling, a collection of verse and prose selected for the American market.\n\nHe supervised the preparation of the sumptuous Sussex Edition of his works,[31] and then began to write Something of Myself, the bare framework of an autobiography, which tantalizingly omitted many of the most important people and incidents in his career.\n\nIn the summer of 1935 the Kiplings went off together to Marienbad (for Carrieâs sake), and in the autumn Rudyard was busy with Hollywood agents, arranging for the filming of several of his stories.\n\nIn January, 1936, Kipling replied to an invitation from the Secretary of the Authorsâ Lodge:\n\nBatemanâs,\n\nBurwash, Sussex.\n\nJanuary 2, 1936.\n\nDear Brother Spalding,\n\nThank you very much indeed for the Lodge invitation for the 15th, but Iâm sorry to say that each year I pass from the labour of fighting the English climate to the refreshment, more or less, of the South of France, and by the 15th I ought to be there in whatever sunshine this mad world has to offer.\n\nPlease convey my regrets to the Brethren, and Believe me,\n\nFraternally yours,\n\n(Signed) RUDYARD KIPLING.\n\n(Transactions of Authorsâ Lodge, vol. vii, p. 162.)\n\nEarly in January, 1936, they were spending a few days at Brownâs Hotel in London, prior to a projected trip to Cannes. On the night of January 13th, Rudyard suffered a violent haemorrhage; he lingered a few days and died on January 18th, 1936, soon after his 70th birthday.\n\nHe lies buried in Poetâs Corner at Westminster Abbey.\n\nIs it fairâor even possibleâto sum up in a few lines the Masonic character of a man who had led such a full, busy and successful life? The constant interruptions in his career, his necessary mobility as a journalist, his travels, his early marriage and his subsequent wanderings, all contributed towards his inability to make âprogressâ in the Craft. Yet his zeal for Freemasonry was proclaimed in his writings time and time again. It has been suggested that as a creator of word-images his was not the kind of temperament to be troubled with the learning of ready-made ritual, but his writings show, constantly, that he had mastered a great deal of Masonic ritual during the bare three years of his Masonry in India.\n\nWhen he wrote his wonderful Masonic tale, âIn the Interests of the Brethrenâ, he was, indeed, an Honorary Member of Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, but he had been a nonsubscribing Mason for some 20 years, yet nothing could better display his affection for the Craft or his knowledge of its background, and, perhaps most important of all, his love for humanity.\n\nThere was in his character a kind of native vehemence which prompted him occasionally to express himself in hasty wordsâthat he must have regrettedâyet it was that same vehemence which brought the blazing light of sympathy into all his writings, which taught him how to defend the under-dog, which helped him to write with insight and understanding for children, as well as adults, over fields of literature unequalled by anyone before or since his day.\n\nGenerallyâand all his Masonic writings seem to support this viewâhe was a âpracticalâ Mason, keenly aware of the practical usefulness of the Craft in bringing men together in service and good deeds; yet in Kimâand in some of his poemsâhe showed a genuine awareness of the spiritual aspects of the Craft.\n\nPART II\n\nFREEMASONRY AND MASONIC ALLUSIONS IN KIPLINGâS WORK\n\nThe extracts that follow do not pretend to be a complete catalogue or collection of all the Masonic allusions in Kiplingâs prose and verse. Indeed, it is doubtful if such a comprehensive collection would be possible, because many of them hinge on a mere turn of phrase, or association of ideas, where it is difficult to be certain of the writerâs intentions. Nor is there any attempt here to make a study of Kiplingâs qualities as a writer. The extracts are presented, primarily, to show the many and various ways in which he expressed his ideas about the Craft, to indicate the diversity of purpose with which they were written, and to give some idea of the fascinating items of high Masonic interest which await the reader who has not already discovered them for himself.\n\nOccasionally the allusions are wholly Masonic in character, so that the background, the story and the theme (or moral) are all centred on some aspect of the Craft. Often the Masonic references are bold and clear, yet without any particular relevance to the story, which would have been equally complete without them. In such cases the allusions seem to have slipped into the text almost involuntarily, as though Kipling could find no better way of expressing himself, even though he must have known that their full significance might only be apparent to a tiny fraction of his readers. These references reflect an inner compulsion which is, itself, a measure of his love for the Craft.\n\nIn contrast to the direct allusions, relevant or not, the most difficult items of all to trace are the tricks of phrasingâthe odd word or two which have their origins or parallels in Masonic ideas and lines of thoughtâalthough the words themselves do not belong to any specific Ritual or Lodge procedure.\n\nAll the extracts presented here fall into one or other of the categories outlined above. Previous writers have presented the same material more or less at random, usually on the basis of personal preference. They are reproduced below, as far as possible in chronological order, with only enough comment to enable the reader to grasp their implications, but with larger notes on matters that deserve special attention.\n\nThe extracts have been divided, however, into two separate collectionsâso that the items of minor interest, which might have marred the more important ones, are shown separately, under the heading of TRIVIA.\n\nMany of the pieces appeared originally in newspapers, etc., but it would be extremely difficult for the reader to locate them in that form. The dates and book titles that are given in each case represent the main work in which the items were first collected and published.\n\n* * * *\n\nâThe Man Who Would Be Kingâ (Indian Railway Series, 1888) (Wee Willie Winkie, 1895) is generally accounted one of the best of Kiplingâs stories. It is told by a journalist (presumably Kipling himself) who falls into conversation, on a train journey, with an entertaining vagabond, Peachey Carnehan, who is planning a blackmailing visit to a native ruler. Warned off by the journalist, Carnehan asks him to deliver a message to another loafer at a railway-junction at some distance. The conversation runs:\n\nâI ask you as a strangerâgoing to the Westâ, he said, with emphasis.\n\nâWhere have you come from?â said I.\n\nâFrom the East â, said he, âand I am hoping that you will give him the message on the Squareâfor the sake of my Mother, as well as your own.â"
