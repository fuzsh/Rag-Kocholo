        "text": "Name of the author: Rudyard Kipling\n\nWork: \"The Jungle Book\"\n\nRudyard Kipling*\n\nJoseph Rudyard Kipling was an English journalist, short-story writer, poet, and novelist. He was born on \\(30\\) December \\(1865\\) in Bombay, India, to British parents John Lockwood Kipling and Alice Kipling. He lived in India until he was about six and went to Britain with his younger sister to do his schooling. His perception of India as a child had shaped the stories in the book \"The Jungle Book\".\n\nRudyard Kipling lived under foster care for the better part of his school years as his parents were still in India. He recalls his childhood in Britain as terrible as hell as his foster mother had often ill-treated him.\n\nAfter spending about a decade in Britain, Rudyard Kipling returned to India to work as a journalist in \\(1882\\). He wrote and circulated some of his earlier stories and poems during his stay in India. Eventually, in \\(1889\\), he returned to Britain as he realised that writing was his calling.\n\nKipling’s most memorable book is “The Jungle Book”, published in \\(1894\\). His other works include \"Kim\" (\\(1901\\)), short stories such as \"The Man Who Would Be King\" (\\(1888\\)), poems such as \"Mandalay\" (\\(1890\\)), \"Gunga Din\" (\\(1890\\)), \"The Gods of the Copybook Headings\" (\\(1919\\)), \"The White Man's Burden\" (\\(1899\\)), and \"If—\" (\\(1910\\)), and an autobiography published posthumously called “Something of Myself for My Friends Known and Unknown” (\\(1937\\)).\n\nIn \\(1907\\), and at the age of \\(41\\), he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the first English-language writer to receive the prize and the youngest winner to date.\n\nOn \\(18\\) January \\(1936\\), he died at the age of \\(70\\) after succumbing to an illness."
