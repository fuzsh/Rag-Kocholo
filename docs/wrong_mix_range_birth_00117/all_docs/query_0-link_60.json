        "text": "The production pays tribute to the brand’s history with a cast of real-life royalty\n\nRaffles’ new ‘Hotel Royalty Since 1887’ campaign was conceptualised by Accor’s Creative Studio in collaboration with artist and film director Peter Greenaway.\n\nShowcasing the Raffles experience, the campaign follows a cast of real-life royals, including HIRH Catharina von Habsburg, Archduchess of Austria, Princess of Hungary and Bohemia, with her mother HIRH Archduchess Anna Gabriele von Habsburg, born von Wrede; HRH Maharaja Sawai Padmanabh Singh, King of Jaipur; George Spencer-Churchill, Marquess of Blandford; HRH Princess Maria-Olympia of Greece and Denmark; and HH Prince Nikolai of Denmark,\n\nThe royals embark on a series of whimsical adventures\n\nAs their day progresses, scenes build to a colourful crescendo, culminating with an opulent banquet. Throughout the scenes, simple pleasures become elevated, reflecting the essence of the brand and the feeling of Raffles’ guests when in residence.\n\nFOR MORE NEWS YOU CAN USE, SIGN UP FOR CONNECTING TRAVEL’S WEEKLY BULLETIN\n\nEach royal cast member has a personal passion that connects to the roots of the Raffles brand and Greenaway has incorporated these into the campaign in symbolic ways. For example, HIRH Catharina von Habsburg is depicted writing exactly where Rudyard Kipling, one of her favourite authors, wrote The Jungle Book.\n\nShot at Raffles Singapore, the birthplace of the brand, the campaign is inspired by Raffles’ philosophy of true luxury being not only about what you do but also about how you feel\n\nRaffles is on track to double its portfolio by 2024. Recently, Raffles opened a second hotel in Dubai on Palm Jumeirah, and the much-anticipated Raffles in London’s Old War Offices is set to open in 2022, along with additional flagship properties planned for destinations including Bahrain, Boston, Doha, Jeddah, Macau and Moscow."
