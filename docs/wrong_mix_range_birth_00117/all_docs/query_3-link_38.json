        "text": "In the spirit of looking into Kipling's many-sided character, we've assembled a balance sheet of our own—a sampling of writing by and about Kipling from The Atlantic's back issues. Spanning nearly the entire course of Kipling's writing life, these pieces collectively bear out the view that only by his contradictions can we know him.\n\nKipling's early acclaim was built on the short stories and narrative verse he produced at a breakneck pace while working as an editor and correspondent for English-language newspapers in northern India. When The Atlantic printed his story \"The Disturber of Traffic\" in September 1891, the twenty-six-year-old author had moved to London and his international renown had just begun to crest. His collected works, which included such noted titles as Departmental Ditties (1886), Plain Tales From the Hills (1888), and the short novel The Light That Failed (1890), already ran to several volumes, and were selling briskly in both their British and American editions. Hailed as the most popular \"Anglo-Indian\" writer of the day, Kipling was a critical success as well: Henry James sung his praises and The Times of London lauded him in an editorial. The demands of fame and the strain of overwork, however, were taking their toll. Kipling spent much of 1891 voyaging abroad, and the following year he and his new American wife transplanted themselves to Brattleboro, Vermont, where they lived in a cottage purchased from her father. It was there that Kipling would write The Jungle Books, which appeared in two volumes in 1894 and 1895.\n\nAlthough India was still Kipling's great subject during this period, his Atlantic story foreshadowed the direction that much of his later work would take. \"The Disturber of Traffic,\" framed as a story within a story, is set not in the Subcontinent but on the cliffs of the English Channel, told mainly through the voice of a crusty lighthouse keeper who regales a bemused visitor with a cautionary tale from the South Seas about the hazards of his trade. If the story does not rank among Kipling's more masterly fictions, it nonetheless imparts a characteristic color and vigor, and displays Kipling's growing fascination with the mechanical technology that supplied the infrastructure (and, in a more complicated way, the sense of entitlement) for Britain's colonial power. It carries the added interest of anticipating the evolving sophistication of Kipling's approach to character psychology and narrative technique. As Randall Jarrell wrote in his introduction to a 1963 paperback edition of Kipling's stories, \"many, even most, of Kipling's best stories are stories of the English in England\" that show him to be \"one of the great stylists of his language, one of those writers who can make a list more interesting than an ordinary writer's murder.\"\n\nIn the productive decade following Kipling's return to England in 1896—capped by his being named the first English Nobel Laureate in 1907—several of his works of fiction received respectful, if not always reverential, notices from Atlantic reviewers. An item in the magazine's June 1898 Contributors' Club, \"R. Kipling: Comparative Psychologist,\" advised readers that the beguiling Jungle Books were not only as delightful as billed but also remarkably instructive:\n\nIn 1901 a brief review waxed lyrical over the novel Kim, calling it \"a fine antidote to all manner of morbidness\" and the finest of Kipling's creations to date, a book \"that fairly amazes one by the proof it affords of the author's magnificent versatility.\" H. W. Boynton, writing in the May 1903 issue, found occasion to rank Kipling's Just So Stories among the highest class of \"books for the young,\" a work to be placed alongside Grimm's Fairy Tales, the stories of Hans Christian Andersen, and Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland in that it belongs \"not simply to the nursery but to literature.\" The one sour note amid this general chorus of approval was a pan of Captains Courageous in December 1897. Kipling's new novel, grumped the unsigned review,\n\nAtlantic readers were also kept apprised of Kipling's handiwork in verse. In January 1897 Kipling's latest volume of poetry, The Seven Seas, prompted a rave from the usually imperious Harvard savant Charles Eliot Norton, whose esteem for the poems was no doubt colored by his close friendship with the Kipling family. (The story goes that Norton's daughter, Sally, rescued the first draft of Kipling's patriotic ode \"Recessional\" from the dust-bin and persuaded him to send the poem to The Times of London, whereupon it was published on the same page as Queen Victoria's proclamation on her Diamond Jubilee.) But while Norton's lavish tribute may well have had a certain avuncular motive, it's evident that the fervor and clamor of young Kipling's balladry stirred the old Brahmin to his bones. The Seven Seas, Norton declared,\n\nThe Atlantic's assessment of Kipling's next collection of verse, The Five Nations, was far more mixed. Reviewing the book in the December 1903 issue, Bliss Perry acknowledged the \"exceptional power\" of Kipling's art (\"Here is verse written by one of the most widely known authors of the English-speaking world. Many of these poems have been cabled across the seas and discussed as events of international significance.\"), but harbored misgivings over its strident political overtones:\n\nKipling had rejected overtures to become England's official poet laureate in the late 1890s, but on the strength of \"Recessional\" and the many poems in The Five Nations commemorating the English fighting forces in the Boer War, he had come to be spoken of as \"the Laureate of Empire.\" On that point his defenders and detractors could agree; on everything else concerning Kipling's merits there seems to have been only grounds for argument. That acrimony intensified with the onset of the Great War, and though Kipling wrote as prolifically as ever, the tide of intellectual fashion had turned against him. Looking back at this period of Kipling's career in her January 1919 Atlantic article, \"The Remarkable Rightness of Rudyard Kipling,\" Katharine Fullerton Gerould sized up his fall from favor:\n\nGerould, as her title makes clear, would have no truck with the conventional wisdom. Although conceding that Kipling \"does not give us so many good stories as once, in the full flush of his genius,\" Gerould held that his decline in popularity said more about \"English political manners\" than it did about Kipling's ebbing literary gifts. The English intelligentsia, she believed, were all too ready to dismiss Kipling as washed-up, because they had long ago determined to tune him out:\n\nIn April 1936, three months after Kipling's death at the age of seventy, The Atlantic published a selection of letters and diary extracts written by Edmonia Hill that dated to the late 1880s. Hill was the American wife of an English science professor who oversaw the university observatory in Allahabad, India, in the years when Kipling was making his living there as a journalist. The Hills eventually took him in as a lodger, and Edmonia became a sisterly confidante to the flourishing young scribe she was pleased to call \"Ruddy.\" The ten-page montage, which ran under the headline \"The Young Kipling,\" provides vivid glimpses of a prodigy who was coming into his own. \"Young Kipling is certainly all things to all people,\" Hill wrote. \"He talks equally well to High Court Judge or to a scientist, and I hear he can make first-class love to the latest belle in Simla.\"\n\nAs another passage in the same letter reveals, Kipling was already the talk of sitting-rooms and mess-halls throughout the Raj, owing to his ready prowess at churning out lively copy to order:\n\nIn a subsequent letter, Hill testifies (somewhat unwittingly, one suspects) to Kipling's powers of concentration in the heat of composition:\n\nIn contrast to Hill's affectionate account of a young author on the rise, Edmund Wilson's two-part Atlantic article, \"The Kipling That Nobody Read\" (February and March 1941), attempted to puzzle out why Kipling's stock as a serious artist had fallen so sharply by the end of his life. For Wilson, it is this later Kipling, the Kipling that \"has in a sense been dropped out of modern literature,\" that remained the most inscrutable:\n\nSurveying the various phases of Kipling's work, Wilson contended that Kipling's primary failing was that he lacked the temperament to depict \"the moral life of man\" with the sense of conviction one finds in the most enduring works of literary realism:\n\nNonetheless, Wilson concluded, the haunting power of many of Kipling's later stories shows that he was a virtuoso to the end. That fiction may have had none of the enchantment of the buoyant tales of Kipling's youth, but in Wilson's view it perhaps contains his greatest triumphs in concentrated narrative technique:\n\nIn one of the last columns she wrote before her retirement in 2000, The Atlantic's longtime book critic Phoebe-Lou Adams took stock of Harry Ricketts's recent biography of Kipling in a brief review, which follows in its entirety:"
