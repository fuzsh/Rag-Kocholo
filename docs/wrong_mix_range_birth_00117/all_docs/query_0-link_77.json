        "text": "Supposedly, out of a cache of assorted papers and oddments, William Boyd has created a masterful memoir of a man born into ambiguity, who lived several lives under assumed names and died unrecognised in a station waiting room.\n\nCashel Greville Ross was living with his aunt in Ireland, until he was about nine at which time he moved to Oxford with a different name, and his ‘aunt’ became his mother. So began a life that was as much a game of bagatelle as the game itself.\n\nA small ball flicked into an arena with obstacles and safe havens, the ball trickles randomly down the board until it ends up in a safe haven, or runs to the bottom only to be flicked up again. This amply describes the life that is narrated in The Romantic.\n\nOn discovering his actual relationship with Aunt Eliza and her husband Ross, Cashel runs away and joins the army as a drummer. Eventually ending up at the Battle of Waterloo and from there his real adventures begin, taking him variously to India, to Europe, to America and all places and all escapades in between. From Waterloo, his adventures take him to the Third Kandy War, in Europe he meets Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron; in America he has marital adventures and goes into brewing with his life long companion, Ignaz Vlac; in Africa he encounters Richard Burton and John Speke and so on and so on. He meets the love of his life in Ravenna and is tricked into a false position, something he regrets ever after.\n\nA mesmerising, enchanting and peripatetic life. It reminded me forcibly of a much older novel written in the 1930s, Anthony Adverse by Hervey Allen\n\nFollowing on from his previous novel, The Year of the Runaways, shortlisted for the Booker Prize, Sunjeev Sahota has returned to the subject of Indian marriage. Set in pre-Partition India, three unrelated girls are married to three brothers. As with all traditional Indian marriages, the girls do not know their husbands, nor do they see them on the day of the wedding. They are heavily veiled and the faces of their grooms concealed behind . The mother-in-law, Mai, arranges the conjugal visits, but for the rest of the time the girls, when not engaged in household tasks, share two charpoys in the China Room, so called because of the Willow Pattern plates on a shelf, a marriage gift to Mai. The daily grind:\n\nBreaking up blocks of jaggery. Picking cotton. Picking guavas. Collecting dung. Shovelling ashes. Cutting Mai’s corns. Milking. Cooking. Preparing for the cooking. Dyeing salwars. Ironing dhotis. Sweeping the yard. Watering the yard. Draining the yard. Polishing the plates. Going to market. Going to temple. Going to pray for sons and for the long life of their husbands. Scrubbing the stone bath clean of moss. Sewing buttons. Boiling tea. Eating last of all. In their room by dusk.\n\np 17 China Room\n\nThe room where any conjugal activity takes place when arranged is dark. The matter is conducted in silence.\n\nIn another section of the book, a young man arrives from England to stay with his mother’s brother, Uncle Jai and Aunt Kuku. He almost immediately falls ill, but not from dengue fever as the local doctor diagnoses, but from withdrawal symptoms, he is weaning off heroin and drowning in alcohol. An incident, which involves his neglect of his young cousin in pursuit of a drink, results in him having to find alternative accommodation. He moves out to a derelict and abandoned farm, still belonging to the family, where his great-grandmother lived as a married woman.\n\nThe narrative trajectory of China Room moves between these two strands. We follow, in some detail, the lives, tribulations and problems of the three married women: Maher (the youngest), Harbans and Gurleen. Maher is curious to know which of the three brothers is her husband, and a misunderstanding leads inevitably towards the devastating finale. Maher, is the great-grandmother. While we also follow the strange, isolated existence of the (nameless) young man, his visitors and his slow but revealing understanding of his great-grandmother’s tragedy. Told with insight, love and compassion this is a tale of sorrow and joy, family cruelties and betrayals.\n\nBeautifully constructed, the novel wraps the reader in details, both in the sections set in “old” India and the modern section, where not a lot seems to have changed in the rural villages where his uncle and aunt grew up and lived. Aunt Kuku is an embittered woman, whose life choice would not have been a marriage to Jai, but tradition prevailed and she was married to the groom chosen by her parents. The man she loved remained a bachelor, living in the village where they grew up. Jai, who works in a bank, receives her insults and slaps with resignation, the arrival of his nephew turns out very differently from his anticipation.\n\nThis is not a long book, only 243 pages. It has some autobiographical details, and a clue is left for the reader in a photograph at the end of the book of an elderly woman holding an infant on her knee. The narrative is inspired in part by Sunjeev’s family history.\n\nIf it hadn’t been for friends visiting from Australia and looking at my “to be read” pile, I might have missed out on the adventure that is involved in reading this novel. They recommended it and I am so grateful. At 900 pages, it might be daunting to some, but it is worth it, quite one of the best books I have read this year – and there have been many.\n\nShantaram, an Australian novel, is so extraordinary that I have scanned both the front and the back of my copy.\n\nThis is such an enjoyable book that I could hardly bear to finish it, the character of its hero is impossible not to like, yet I feel sure that we should not really, since he is an improbable reprobate with a good heart.\n\nLike Ned Kelly, the Australian outlaw who gripped the nation and ended his life, with others of his gang in a brutal shoot out with the police, Mr Lindsay or Linbaba, as he comes to be called arrives in Bombay (Mumbai) on the run from the Australia, where he is a wanted man with a price on his head, (is there such a thing in modern Australia?)\n\nGregory David Roberts, according to the back cover of this copy, lived the life of the main character, the first person narrator. So even after finishing the book, I am not entirely sure whether is is autobiographical fiction, mostly fiction or mostly autobiographical.\n\nIt is in places profoundly moving, it is heart-wrenchingly sad and gut-churningly bloody, sometimes at one and the same time. But it is also about love. In the end, I think it is mainly a voyage of the discovery of the heart and the nature of love. Linbaba falls in with the Bombay mafia, he becomes closely associated with Prabaker, a self-appointed Bombay guide who lives in one of the many and terrifying slums that surround Bombay on all sides, right up to the shoreline.\n\nIn both these roles, he finds himself at the cutting edge of experience. For the first months of his time in Bombay, he goes to live in the slum and simply on account of his first aid kit, becomes the slum doctor. The slum in question, like many of the slums around the city, is bang up against the World Trade Building, sleek glass and steel with all the accoutrements of wealth and work and modern plumbing – meanwhile around two thousand people live with an open latrine, for the elderly, women and children while the men simply shit into the sea on its doorstep.\n\nEventually, he is approached by the king pin of Bombay mafia, Abdel Khader Khan, and he moves from the slum to work for the master criminal. Which is partly why we should not like him so much. But, of course, we do.\n\nMany near death experiences and adventures later, he is still out there and we are still gunning for him…\n\nI have said before this is an extraordinary novel and as well as all the human characters – and there are many – there is another: the vital, chaotic and vibrant city itself. Bombay – The Gateway to India, the beauty and the beast.\n\nIt is not my usual practice to post on fiction and non-fiction in the same one. But these two books elide so well that I am breaking the mould.\n\nI was reading A Fistful of Shells intermittently while gorging on the Booker Longlist, so I have not yet quite finished it, but have read enough to know that it is fascinating, infinitely readable and full of stuff I had no idea about.\n\nI did not know that West Africa had a thriving trade and diplomatic relationship with Portugal, long before English traders industrialised the slave trade.\n\nI did not know that cowrie shells were the accepted currency for many nations until the enormous amount of gold pouring from West Africa, through Europe and the Middle East, changed the nature of international currency once and for all.\n\nI did not know that pilgrimages from West Africa to Mecca were famous and appear in all sorts of documents going back to the early 1300s,\n\na Catalan atlas [made in 1375] speaks of networks and pathways of connection that have been covered over by the dust of time. The idea of Jewish mapmakers of the Balearic Islands having connections in distant Mali startles…\n\nThe map in question shows a camel and rider on a trading route, facing him is the Emperor of Mali enthroned with sceptre and golden crown, dressed in elegant robes extending a gold nugget to the trader. The whole map is crisscrossed with lines indicating trade routes through Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nWest African history has been subsumed into the catastrophe of the slave trade, and its effect on subsequent generations. This book by Toby Green shines a bright light on the past and blows away the dust of centuries.\n\nThe novel, by Amitav Ghosh is also a peregrination, but one that starts in India in the Sundarbans and Kolkata. Summoned by a member of his extended family, Nilima Bose, the antiquarian bookseller, Dinanath Datta (Deen or Dinu), is told of a little known shrine dedicated to the Gun Merchant, or Bonduki Sadagar. Dinu is known to be interested in the myths surrounding Chand Sadagar and his flight from the goddess Manasa Devi, and this story is remarkably similar. So Dinu goes off in search of the shrine.\n\nGun Island is like many of Amitav Ghosh’s novels more than one story. So partly it is that of pursuing the Bonduki Sadagar myth, but also more relevantly today, the reports of migrants arriving in Italy from Egypt. For a colleague and friend of Dinu’s, Professoressa Giacinta Schiavon, is also interested in this from a different point of view. Venice, her city, has long been a centre for immigration going back centuries and she wants to show Dinu how this relates to the different parts of the Bonduki Sadagar adventure.\n\nThe Blue Boat carrying hundreds of migrants arrives in Italian waters just as the political situation alters and the government decides to prevent anyone landing on Italian soil. There is a stand off (if you can have such a thing on water) which involves the team made up of many of the characters in this story also in a boat together with protestors both for and against the migrants.\n\nI do not want to spoil anything for the reader, but only to say that in following up one story, possibly a myth, Dinanath comes upon an explanation which turns his whole perception upside down. In the process he undergoes several strange adventures or coincidences, mood swings that are both inexplicable and also anxiety provoking.\n\nBut is he also escaping from Manasa Devi, goddess of snakes and spiders and if not, why does he keeps having miraculous escapes from poisonous examples of both these?\n\nGhosh’s descriptions of landscape and weather are glorious, if you have not already sampled this in The Ibis Trilogy, then I strongly recommend this novel. It has everything that you might desire and more. Thrills, spills and drama on almost every page; as well as a serious message about migration and climate change. What more do you need?\n\nIf yesterday was a marathon, today was a double marathon! I had not fully taken on board that the first film was three and a half hours long. Then they added a fifteen minute interval (which says a lot about the decision of the director) so my scheduling became critical.\n\nThe Plan that came from the bottom up is a documentary about labour relations in the 1970s, seen through the lens of the Lucas Aerospace company. Director Steve Sprung clearly believes in “slow cinema”. There was a huge amount of mood setting, relevant once or possibly twice but not more. The film started in Lisbon, in a terrible fog and then there was a billboard which stated in three languages, Portuguese, English and Chinese, that “you can buy this view”. Following that there was an equally magnificent aerial view of London, with the legend “London, open for business”.\n\nI do not want to trash this film as it is important, both for its message about top down industrial management, about the level of government payback to big business (leaving aside the bank bailout of 2008) and how this affected both the workforce and manufacturing in Britain.\n\nThe talking heads were all one-time workers at Lucas. Now retired, (actually they were sacked) but who, when they were shop stewards created a cooperative committee who tried, but failed, to persuade the management that the workers were able and willing to diversify production to more community based products – like wind turbines. Unbelievably, Lucas Aerospace felt that this did not fit with the company image and turned it down, the workers also created a proto-type of an electric bus that could run on rail and road. Also vetoed, although it would save millions in under-developed countries because it would run on concrete, rather than rails, what’s not to like? But no, Lucas preferred making killing machines.\n\nWith substantial editing this would be, as it is described above, “a gripping essay”, reflecting on the darker side of capitalism. What is really astonishing though, is the level of behind the scenes collaboration between the Labour government of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan and the management of these vital industries.\n\nThere were figures, which I did not copy down, but which showed that after a turnover of tens of millions, what with cost of production and Labour government subsidies, Lucas Aerospace paid only £470,000 to HMRC in tax. Does anyone else immediately think of Amazon and Starbucks?\n\nI wish I could say this was a must see. Maybe a four-part-series on television. Because what it has to say about our choked up cities, about climate change and industry, and the death of manufacturing, is important; because there are people out there who have ideas that would help, if only they had been listened to in the 1970s!!!\n\nIt was a rush to get to the next film, which was a shame and this was redoubled by the fact that my neighbour (not the friend I was with but on the other side) seemed oblivious to the fact that a garlicky, chilli wrap followed by smelly, crunchy tacos are not suitable fodder for the cinema. I felt like asking her if she thought she would starve if she waited to eat until after the film.\n\nBisbee ’17 was not exactly the film I thought it was going to be. 2017 makes it one hundred years since a mass deportation of striking copper miners and other supporters was effected in Bisbee.\n\nThe town decides on an re-enactment. This film is the result. And while shining a light on the trauma of a single town, is probably a good thing for the town, I suspect that there would have been better ways to do this for the cinema. It was fractured and over-sentimentalized, which rather drowned the horror of what actually happened.\n\nIn July 1917, over 2000 people, nearly all of them Central Americans and Eastern Europeans, were transported into the desert in cattle trucks and left to die. No amount of re-enactment is going to bring to life the absolute inhumanity of that act; yet Bisbee survives – with the visible scars of copper mining all around them and the Mexican border just a short distance away – what better reminder is there?\n\nFinally tonight a beautiful French film set in Paris and India. Two men get off a French Republic flight and are greeted by François Hollande. In spite of public denials, these two are hostages freed with a slush fund, held under wraps for the French Government.\n\nThis is another film with a female director, Mia Hansen-Love. Beautifully realised and filmed, but a bizarre choice of music – as Gabriel wanders around Indian cities, throbbing with colour, noise and traffic – we are hearing Shubert – why?\n\nAfter a few weeks, young Gabriel goes off to India, a country where he grew up until his parents separated. We travel to India with him and it is utterly gorgeous, as he also travels. Starting from Goa, where his godfather has a hotel, he travels throughout the Indian subcontinent.\n\nMaya is both a love story and a commentary upon what tourism is doing to India, to the farming community and to the still unspoiled places, with unscrupulous developers forcing sales of land and houses by fair means and foul. And possibly a gibe at the French government whose aid programme is dwarfed by the funds paid out to rescue French hostages.\n\nWhat a glorious finale to my festival! In this extraordinary film, we follow in the footsteps of a young Buddhist monk, Padma Angdu a reincarnated Rinpoche. Once the little boy monk is around six or seven his disciples are expected to come to find him and to take him back to their monastery.\n\nIn the case of Padma Angdu though, this is unlikely to be possible, for he is the latest incarnation of a teacher from Kham in Tibet and he has been born in Ladakh, India. For a while he is allowed to stay, but eventually the monastery reject him and he goes to live with the village healer, Urgyan, also a monk, who has been chosen as his guide.\n\nThe socio-political situation in Tibet makes it unlikely, if not impossible, for anyone to come and get Padma, but as a Rinpoche he needs teaching at a higher level and eventually to return to his “home”. So he and his guide, Urgyan have to make the journey themselves.\n\nThis is no small undertaking. Padma is about twelve and Urgyan must be about seventy or eighty and the journey will take about two to three months, much of it on foot . But full of hope, they set off on this perilous journey, stopping at various monasteries along the way to see if one will accept Padma for higher training.\n\nThis documentary was filmed on location, by a small crew of only two or three and took eight years to film and nine years to edit. This was mostly because the two main people on the team, Chang-yong Moon and Jin Jeon are based in South Korea and make documentaries for television so had to keep dropping this film, to work and to find funding.\n\nLeaving aside the amazing and heart-breaking story, the spectacular scenery and visual delights of the settings makes this a film of exceptional interest. At its centre though is the astonishing love and fidelity shown by the older monk for the younger, and the desire of the younger one to return to Tibet.\n\nWe leave Padma Angdu in Sikkim, the nearest place he can get to near Tibet where a monastery accepts him for the training he needs and we see Urgyan turning for home…\n\nWhile I am still struggling with Infinite Jest, I am interspersing the agony with other reading.\n\nThis week it is India. I thought in honour of the year, I should re-read Midnight’s Children by Salman Rushdie. A Man Booker prize winner at the time and then a Man Booker of the decades with this novel, the prize winner of all prize winners. Worthy, deserved and hugely rewarding to read.\n\nI think everyone knows that it is the life story of Saleem Sinai, born on the stroke of midnight at the moment India and Pakistan were divided. This was only Salman Rushdie’s second novel and what a towering success it became.\n\nI think it is true to say that many people reading “Indian fiction” got their insights from Europeans writing about the British Raj. There were, in the early twentieth century, very few India writers being published in Britain. So the sources were Paul Scott‘s The Raj Quartet, EM Forster The Passage to India, JG Farrell Troubles and The Siege of Krishnapur and similar, not forgetting Rudyard Kipling, of course.\n\nThen a trickle began, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala with Heat and Dust, Salman Rushdie, Rohinton Mistry and others, but what was significant about these was that they all lived abroad. But they were a post-partition generation and wrote about India now. The trickle became a flood and then a cataract, and with Arundhati Roy we got a writer who lives and works in India. She too won the Man Booker prize for her novel The God of Small Things.\n\nSo we come to today, with both Indian and Pakistani writers publishing in Britain. Among them, Aravind Adiga, whose first novel The White Tiger also won the Man Booker Prize. The White Tiger was about young entrepreneurs making money in the new booming Indian economy. His latest novel, Selection Day is a similar story of rags to riches, but set in the world of International Cricket as played in India. Two brothers, brought up in the slums, are forcibly trained to be good with bat and ball by their cricket-obsessed father, successfully to start with, they are both marked for great triumph, but when a sponsor arrives things begin to change and a sudden realisation dawns on the younger of the two boys.\n\nFrom rags to riches has a very unique connotation in a land like India, where there is no health care, no welfare state, no safety net. You only have to read Behind the Beautiful Forevers by Katherine Boo to understand that. Aravind Adiga has touched the same nerve in his fiction. Katherine’s book was also turned into a play by David Hare and this is what I wrote having read the book and seen the play.\n\nThe book [Behind the Beautiful Forevers] was written as a result of Katherine Boo’s personal involvement in the slum dwellers who lived beyond the wall on which the “Beautiful Forever” tiles were advertised. The people living in this squatters’ slum were much more than cyphers, they had relationships well beyond what was portrayed in the play. They had back-stories, their current circumstances and the exigencies of living on the edge, at the mercy of police brutality and veniality; at the mercy of the weather and at the bottom of society – rag pickers, garbage sorters living on the detritus of a much wealthier and prosperous elite, living literally cheek-by-jowl with the evidence of wealth – smart hotels and smart cars and living right beside the most flagrant example of wealth: the airport. All this and more one felt at a visceral level when turning the pages of the book. Largely lost in the play. I doubt whether anyone in the audience who had not previously read the book could have come to anything like a real understanding of the degradation oddly coupled with the sense of personal pride that lived side by side in that slum\n\nThere are so many more that I haven’t named, but they are out there and waiting for you to pick them up.\n\nArundhati Roy’s new novel, only her second since winning the Man Booker Prize in 1997, also starts in a graveyard. A short passage, written entirely in italics, describes the flying foxes leaving the Banyan tree at sundown; as the bats leave, the crows return to roost. The passage, though, is a lament for the loss of the sparrows, which have gone missing and the absence of the white-backed vultures which have been completely wiped out through human agency. Farmers fed their cattle Diclofenac, an aspirin to relax them and thereby increased their milk production, but which proved poisonously fatal to the vultures, whose natural appetite fed on the carcases left for them to clear up.\n\nThe Ministry of Utmost Happiness meanders through and around the lives of two women and three men, but with a cast of thousands whose lives touched theirs briefly, or from a great distance affected what they did in this convoluted, tragic history.\n\nSet in India, but also passing through Kashmir and Pakistan, and spanning many years, its trajectory is the arc of history that includes Partition, the Bhopal chemical disaster, the Coco Cola scandal (about which the book says practically nothing but which gets a passing mention) and the various Kashmiri uprisings and suppressions to name but a few of the points of painful memory that mark the twentieth century in the Indian sub-continent.\n\nAnjum leaves her home with nothing much more than a few household items and some carpets and rugs and set herself up in the graveyard where her family is buried. Like a tree she clings to the earth, suffering insults and casual cruelty, as a tree would – silently. Then an ancient imam becomes a regular visitor, and this calms things down and she is left in peace, thus begins the tale of the hijra. Born Aftab, the fourth baby in a line of girls, he was the longed-for son of Jahanara Begum. It was only after the midwife left and she was exploring the new life she had produced that she saw to her sorrow that the boy also had girl-parts.\n\nTerrified and saddened Jahanara Begum takes the baby to the shrine of Hazrat Sarmad Shaheed asking that he teach her to love the baby, and it works.\n\nFor several years she was able to conceal this terrible fact from her husband, but eventually the truth came out and Aftab/Anjum left his birthplace and went to live in Khwabgah with other hijra. Eventually leaving them to live in the graveyard where she accommodates herself and slowly many other characters join her and their personal histories make up the other parts of this magnificently sprawling book.\n\nThe other principal woman in the tale arrives much later, but in many ways the story is as much about her as it is about Anjum. S. Tilottama, or Tilo is a petite and beautiful woman of dark skin, shunned therefore by many of her kind and rejected by her father. Her story really begins at university where she meets the three men who are part of her story, Musa, Naga and Biplab DasGupta. Each of these men love her and she loves one of them and their lives are intertwined with the history of India and Kashmir in the same way as ivy is intertwined with a tree.\n\nOther characters, some appear once and others many times, circle around these two women and become part of the story. But the story is really that of India, because the political and racial upheavals of the twentieth century are the driving forces that throw these characters together, drag them apart, divide them and make them stronger. So that they survive to love, to meet and to share and in the end to understand.\n\nAt one point, Tilo writes to Musa saying that on her tombstone she wants written:\n\n“How to tell a shattered story?\n\nBy slowly becoming everybody.\n\nNo\n\nBy slowly becoming everything.”\n\nThe history of India and Kashmir and Pakistan is soaked in blood, and so is this book, saturated in it, rivers of blood flow in the streets and sink into the fields but lives go on, love goes on, courage goes on and babies are born. In the interstices of history, people can and do find happiness.\n\nMarathon of a day today and the buses were all over the place; sat at one bus stop and no less that six buses, Route 29, came past in less than eight minutes, all but one terminating in Trafalgar Square, which was the next stop!\n\nKicked off in the morning with a political/environmental satire, Boundaries, about a fictional island off the coast of Labrador. Three women, in quite different roles happen to meet during a session in which the island’s mining rights, its relationship with its larger neighbour Canada and its contract with an iron extraction company have ground to a halt. So one woman, played by Emily VanCamp, is there as a mediator struggling with having to be away for long intense periods, leaving her young son with her ex-husband; Macha Grenon plays Danielle Richard, the Prime Minister of Besco, this independent island, she also struggles with work/life balance which she explains in the film as the tension between wanting to do good things for the country and for the future, her children’s future while finding that the job separates her from them and finally there is the idealistic young politician, part of the Canadian team, Félixe Nasser-Villeray played by Nathalie Doummar whose problems arise from the conflict between the reports and works that she has done, and supplied to the team only to have them ignored or misrepresented.\n\nEach of these three strong women, passionate about their work but also about their lives are set against a male dominated, aggressive and bullying culture, needless to say the mediation fails and the island it set free to sort out its own goals and achievements.\n\nThis satirical look at the wheeling and dealing that is part and parcel of politics and big business today, focuses on the women but also shows the men as devious and arrogant – so it looks as though the environment is going to get trashed in the wake of big bucks with sweeteners of all sorts, not to mention a touch of blackmail – but Mrs Richards is made of sterner stuff…\n\nThe second film was precisely the opposite, from the Treasures of the Cinema listings we got a wonderfully re-mastered piece from 1957. Patrick McGoohan as a villain with a cast of young hopefuls that later hit the big screen – Sean Connery and David McCullum among others.\n\nThe premise of Hell Drivers was simple and male-dominated. A company of truckers moving gravel from one site to a building site elsewhere, are motivated by cash rewards for the most runs they can do in a day; vile shenanigans follow as the competition between the gang boss – Red (Patrick McGoohan) and Tom the new boy, played by Stanley Baker – hots up into a seriously dangerous game.\n\nConsidering the age of the film and the techniques and cameras available at the time, the breakneck runs between the depot and the site along narrow English lanes is little short of amazing. Every trick of camera work is in play here, to great effect as the view switches from inside the cab, to the view through the windscreen, the view in the wing mirror and the road ahead. A speed chase and race with heavy lorries; then it switches to the view of the accelerator/brakes and clutch pedals and back to the speedometer. Hugely simplistic, the good guys and the bad guys and nothing much in grey or nuance, but what a film!\n\nFinally tonight a documentary portrait of the Mozart of Chess – Magnus. A young prodigy from Norway who from a very young age shows a natural aptitude for chess. The film follows the boy’s progress from national winner to world chess status over a period of three years, aged 19 to nearly 23 when he became the World Chess Champion in 2013, beating the current holder, Viswanathan Anand, in his home town Chennai.\n\nThis is the second documentary I have seen this Festival in which the whole film would have been considerably different had the outcome not been outstandingly successful (the first being The Eagle Huntress). Placed in the JOURNEY section, it is indeed a journey from triumph to triumph.\n\nThe need to know anything about chess is completely swept away by the quite sensitive and delicate filming of matches, though as it happens Magnus Carlsen plays chess at a quite prohibitive speed.\n\nCompetition chess is rather different from a friendly match down at the pub. There are timing rules, mind games and presumably money, though interestingly the sums that Magnus has won were never mentioned.\n\nThis is a great film, a beautiful and sometimes disturbing story of professional games playing. UK distribution is 25 November, just as Magnus undertakes his third defence of his title.\n\nJust a single film from the Treasures of Cinema DARE section – films that are in-your-face, up-front and arresting: films that take you out of your comfort zone.\n\nBilled as a re-mastered version of a well-known and highly respected film from India, made in 1979 by Shyam Benegal and produced by Shashi Kapoor, this film lived for many years in the garage of the house, after the Bengal Studios closed. Re-mastered from negative and sound tape by Shashi Kapoor’s son, it is probably the best film about the Indian mutiny of 1857 to come out of India, or indeed anywhere.\n\nUsing members of the Indian acting community as well as dragooning members of his own family, Shashi Kapoor (who plays Javed Khan) brings a vivid reality to this terrifying moment in the history of Indian independence from Britain.\n\nMuslim Soldiers in the British Army mutinied against the use of the cartridges which were wrapped in oiled paper, which had to be ripped open with their teeth because the fat used to oil the paper was either from cows or pigs – both of which are haram (forbidden). This was followed by a mass rising, engineered over all of Indian by passing secret messages in chapattis (flat breads into the pockets of which messages could be inserted).\n\nA brave Muslim, Lalal Ramjimal played by Kulbushan Kharbanda, hides three female members of a British family (Jennifer Kendal, Ismat Chughtai and Nafisa Ali) in his house, but an influential Pathan, Javed Khan has become obsessed by Ruth, the daughter (Nafisa Ali) and insists on moving them to his house.\n\nThe book from which this film is made is called The Flight of the Pigeons by Ruskin Bond, but this could easily also be called a cat among the pigeons, placing these three English women in his household causes endless conflict among the women already there. And eventually he submits to the advice of his ‘aunt’ to take them away to her estate.\n\nThe scenes indoors where much of the action is shown through layers of screens (made from rush and lowered to keep the house cool, and to shield the women of the household from any visiting males) adds another texture to the layers of relationships, the sadness and jealousy (understandable) of Javed’s beautiful wife, the sharp tongues of his sister and sister-in-law (also in the house because their husbands are fighting) and finally the more placating tones of his aunt.\n\nJaved is determined to marry Ruth as his second wife, which as a Muslim is permitted, but Ruth’s mother and indeed the girl herself, still traumatised by the events of the early scenes which include a massacre in a church where the father is killed, are completely against the idea. The tension between these two, Ruth and Javed, a fascination and a repulsion which dominates all the action of the film is palpable and brilliantly played. Javed’s frustration at his bewitchment creates a coil of anguish within him which occasionally overwhelms him, and this is brilliantly portrayed.\n\nThe battle scenes, which are many and furious, during which two opposing sets of horsemen charge towards each other, bearing lances, guns and swords, followed by much fierce sword fighting on horseback, must have taken some skill to film quite apart from anything else, there was such a melee of horses hooves that filming soldiers falling off as they were ‘killed’ must have presented quite a challenge in terms of ‘health and safety’.\n\nFor the Caucasian English viewer this was an interesting film because, of course, all the ‘English’ characters were in fact played by Indians, except Jennifer Kendal who was Shashi Kapoor’s wife (and the sister of Felicity)."
