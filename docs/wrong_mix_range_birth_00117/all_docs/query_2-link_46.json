        "text": "Rudyard Kipling\n\nJoseph Rudyard Kipling was born December 30, 1865, English author and poet, born in Bombay, best known for The Jungle Book.Kipling split his boyhood between the markets of Bombay India and an abusive English foster home. His life of travel and tragedy led to two near nervous breakdowns, but made his creative work accessible to both the aristocracy and the common man. He died on January 18, 1936 as one of the most famous and highly paid writers of his time.\n\nIn 1907, Kipling was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature."
