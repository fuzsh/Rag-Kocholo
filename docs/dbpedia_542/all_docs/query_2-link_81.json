        "text": "Joanne Helfrich is an author and channeler whose work contains “some of the most important and meaningful communications from the afterlife.” Inspired by Jane Roberts (late author of the Seth Material), Jo’s work promotes personal transformation by helping readers connect with their own Source, free themselves from fears and negativity, and discover their deepest desires. Her groundbreaking Afterlives (2021) has been lauded as “a landmark book in the field of afterlife studies.” (David Lorimer, Scientific & Medical Network)\n\nJoanne cofounded NewWorldView.com (1999), an educational resource for the practical applications of conscious creation. Her work is inspired by Jane Roberts (late author of the Seth Material) and other spiritual teachers. She’s also grounded in behavioral science, and a certified teacher of Dr. Clare Graves’ and Dr. Don Beck’s Spiral Dynamics Integral. She brings these and other tools to help individuals and organizations awaken to change.\n\nJoanne advocates channeling as an innate human intelligence, and encourages individuals\n\nto find and develop their own special abilities. She began to channel the essence Rose in\n\n2007. Their foundational work, The Way of Spirit: Teachings of Rose (2014), helps readers connect with their own Source and realize their unique intent and purpose—their soul’s design for deepest expression and fulfillment.\n\nHer second book of Rose’s teachings—Let That Shit Go: Learn to Process Loss and Be Happy (2018)—is a practical approach to healing addiction, anxiety, and depression. Joanne and Rose are also featured in the 2019 Meet Rose episode of the documentary series They Call Us Channelers, available on YouTube.\n\nJoanne discovered through sessions with her private clients that her psychic abilities\n\nextend into the afterdeath environment. This resulted in her book, The Afterlife of J.D. Salinger: A Beautiful Message From Beyond (2016).\n\nHer latest book builds upon this foundation. Afterlives: Firsthand Accounts of Twenty Notable People (2021) is a groundbreaking work in which she communicates with Anthony Bourdain, Hunter S. Thompson, Ayn Rand, Martin Luther King, Jr., Harriet Tubman, John Barron (former slaver), Thomas Paine, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Albert Einstein, Carl Jung, Hildegard von Bingen, Paramahansa Yogananda, J.D. Salinger, George Harrison, Douglas Adams, James Baldwin, Kurt Vonnegut, Aldous Huxley, Robin Williams, and Jane Roberts, author of the Seth Material.\n\nStarman: My Life and Afterlife is the result of Jo’s request to speak with beloved rock star David Bowie (1947-2016) about the real facts of life, death, art, music, creativity, sex, drugs, and rock and roll.\n\nJoanne graduated magna cum laude from Temple University with a B.A. in Communications. She lives in Topanga, California, with her husband and collaborator, Paul M. Helfrich. Jo is available for Rose Sessions and events including:"
