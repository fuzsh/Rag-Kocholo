        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- After hitting their stride on offense late in the season, the Tennessee Titans find themselves searching for a new offensive coordinator.\n\nMatt LaFleur was named Green Bay's new head coach on Wednesday, meaning the Titans might be learning a new scheme, something that is becoming an annual occurrence for quarterback Marcus Mariota and the offense.\n\nThe next coordinator the Titans hire will be the fifth in five seasons for Mariota, who was looking forward to being able to play in the same offense for consecutive seasons.\n\nHere are some of the candidates who could be considered to replace LaFleur:\n\nJohn DeFilippo | Former Vikings offensive coordinator\n\nDeFilippo was an instrumental part of quarterback Carson Wentz's development in Philadelphia. The former college quarterback (James Madison) was also instrumental in the rapid adjustment that Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles made during his magical playoff run in 2017. Many of the drills that DeFilippo did with Wentz and Foles during practice came alive on game day resulting in big plays.\n\nHe parlayed the success into a short-lived stint with the Vikings before being relieved of his duties. DeFilippo's past offensive coordinator experience includes stints at San Jose State and with the Cleveland Browns. One of the major concerns for the Titans will be keeping Mariota upright. DeFilippo's rhythmic, quick passing game would help do just that.\n\nGreg Roman | Ravens assistant head coach/tight ends coach\n\nRoman is an intriguing name that should draw interest from the Titans because of his time as the offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers. Under Roman, the 49ers had one of the NFL's top rushing offenses, averaging 155.7 yards per game in 2012 and 137.6 yards per game in 2013. Roman's offense also utilized a lot of run-pass option (RPO) concepts. While in San Francisco, Roman was able to maximize talented, dual-threat quarterback Colin Kaepernick, which could bode well for Mariota, a player with skills similar to Kaepernick's.\n\nThe 49ers used a lot of zone read plays in 12 personnel with tight ends Vernon Davis and Delanie Walker. The matchup problems that Walker and Davis presented gave opposing defenses fits. LaFleur said he was considering using some of those concepts, but with Walker (now in Tennessee) and tight end Jonnu Smith.\n\nRoman's next stop was with the Buffalo Bills, where he worked with Tyrod Taylor, another dual-threat quarterback. The Bills led the NFL in rushing under Roman in 2015, averaging 152 yards per game. Do you see a theme? Defensive-minded head coaches like Mike Vrabel generally want to run the ball. Roman has plenty of success doing so. This past season with the Baltimore Ravens further strengthens Roman's case, as he was an integral part of the team's success under rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson and a heavy rushing attack.\n\nMark Helfrich | Bears offensive coordinator\n\nContinuity from a playcaller is something Mariota has lacked as a pro. Adding Helfrich would bring Mariota back to the days when he dominated as a dynamic quarterback for Oregon. They found the most success together with Mariota winning the Heisman Trophy in 2014 and Helfrich posting a career-best 11-2 record at Oregon in 2013. Mariota and Helfrich would get the opportunity to pick up where they left off in 2014 when Mariota was the No. 2 pick of the draft.\n\nHelfrich took over as the Bears' offensive coordinator in 2018, joining new head coach Matt Nagy in Chicago. One of the things that Helfrich did best was help second-year quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, who threw 22 touchdowns passes after only throwing for seven as a rookie. Helfrich also helped balance the carries between running backs Tarik Cohen and Jordan Howard, a tandem that is somewhat similar to Titans backs Dion Lewis and Henry.\n\nLike LaFleur with the Los Angeles Rams, Helfrich might covet the Titans job, which would give him a chance to call plays for the first time in the NFL.\n\nPat O'Hara | Titans QB coach\n\nThe continuity card applies to O'Hara and the Titans after he spent the past season as Mariota's position coach. O'Hara has pro playing experience with the Buccaneers, Chargers, and Redskins in the NFL, and Orlando Predators, Tampa Bay Storm, and Toronto Phantoms in the Arena League. O'Hara has head coaching experience in the Arena League with Orlando and the New Orleans Voodoo.\n\nO'Hara brings 13 years of coaching experience with him. He also played backup quarterback Tyler Cherubini in the movie \"Any Given Sunday\" which has to account for something.\n\nZac Taylor | Rams QB coach\n\nEveryone else is scooping up coaches that have worked with Rams head coach Sean McVay, so why shouldn't the Titans? Taylor is a solid option from a continuity standpoint after serving as the Rams wide receivers coach when LaFleur was the offensive coordinator there. He served as quarterback Jared Goff's position coach last season. Taylor was instrumental in the development of Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill (2013-15) when he was the quarterbacks coach and then offensive coordinator. He was the offensive coordinator at the University of Cincinnati before joining the Rams. His brother, Press Taylor, is the Eagles quarterbacks coach and was responsible for introducing head coach Doug Pederson to the infamous \"Philly Special\" play that was used in Super Bowl 52.\n\nMike Kafka | Chiefs QB coach\n\nKafka is next in line to take over as offensive coordinator in Kansas City if Eric Bienemy gets a head coaching job. The former journeyman spent most of his career under Andy Reid as the No. 3 quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles. One of his last stops was with the Titans on their practice squad at the tail end of the 2015 season before being released.\n\nKafka joined the Chiefs in 2017 as a quality control coach before taking over as Pat Mahomes' position coach this year. It's no secret that Kansas City has been a breeding ground for successful playcallers. Would Kafka consider flying the coup?"
