        "text": "A heartfelt plea has been sent out to support Eliana, a loving wife, and a devoted mother of five, who has been courageously battling lupus for years. She is currently undergoing dialysis treatments in preparation for the hope of a kidney transplant.\n\nEliana and her husband Vinny, the owners of Chefing it Up! Pizza Cafe in downtown Groveland, are treasured members of the community. Despite the immense pain and suffering caused by lupus, Eliana has faced each day with a positive attitude and unwavering energy.\n\nA kidney transplant is a critical step for Eliana, who has endured severe complications from lupus. She is undergoing dialysis several times a week to strengthen her body for the transplant, which could significantly improve her quality of life. Unfortunately, the associated medical expenses are overwhelming. From pre-transplant evaluations to post-surgery care, the financial burden is staggering. Additionally, even after a successful transplant, Eliana will require lifelong anti-rejection medication to ensure her body accepts the new kidney.\n\nSupport Eliana and her family while enjoying a fun-filled day of entertainment and delicious food from Chefing It Up Pizza"
