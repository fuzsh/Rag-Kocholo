Combat Narratives are not to be removed from the ship or station for which they are provided. Reproduction of this material in any form is not authorized except by specific approval of the Director of Naval Intelligence.\n\nOfficers who have participated in the operations recounted herein are invited to forward to the Director of Naval Intelligence, via their commanding officers, accounts of personal experiences and observations which they esteem to have value for historical and instructional purposes. It is hoped that such contributions will increase the value and render ever more authoritative such new editions of these publications as may be promulgated to the service in the future.\n\nWhen the copies provided have served their purpose, they may be destroyed by burning. However, reports acknowledging receipt or destruction of these publications need not be made.\n\n/s/ Harold C.

This material has been collated and presented in chronological order.\n\nIn perusing these narratives, the reader should bear in mind that while they recount in considerable detail the engagements in which our forces participated, certain underlying aspects of these operations must be kept in a secret category until after the end of the war.\n\nIt should be remembered also that the observations of men in battle are sometimes at variance. As a result, the reports of commanding officers may differ although they participated in the same action and shared a common purpose. In general, Combat Narratives represent a reasoned interpretation of these discrepancies. In those instances where views cannot be reconciled, extracts from the conflicting evidence are reprinted.\n\nThus, an effort has been made to provide accurate and, within the above-mentioned limitations, complete narratives with charts covering raids, combats, joint operations, and battles in which our Fleets have engaged in the current war. It is hoped that these narratives will afford a clear view of what has occurred, and form a basis for a broader understanding which will result in ever more successful operations.\n\n/s/ E.J.

Bottom: The light cruiser De Ruyter, flagship of the Netherlands East Indies Fleet.\n\nThe Java Sea Campaign\n\nThe Java Sea Campaign is the story of the Japanese conquest of the Netherlands East Indies. Strictly speaking, the history of the United States Navy's participation in that campaign should begin with the arrival of our Asiatic Fleet in the Indies and the beginning of our active cooperation with the British and Dutch.\n\nIt is difficult, however, to set a definite date for such a beginning. Several of our ships were sent into the East Indies in the latter part of November 1941, and various units of our fleet followed at intervals all through December. Moreover, the conquest of the Indies by the Japanese was merely the culmination of a single, carefully planned campaign which opened with their attack on the Philippines and Malaya. Their advance into the Dutch possessions was carefully coordinated with and dependent upon their successes in these other theatres. While our defense of the Philippines is the subject of a separate narrative (in preparation), some reference must be made to events there to explain the situation at the opening of the Java Sea Campaign.\n\nORGANIZATION AND DISPOSITION OF OUR FLEET\n\nThe United States Asiatic Fleet was something less than its title suggested. Actually it amounted to only a modest task force. The flagship was the heavy cruiser Houston, commanded by Capt. Albert H. Rooks. There were two light cruisers, the Boise commanded by Capt. Stephen B. Robinson till the latter part of January, when he was relieved by Capt. Edward J. Moran, and the Marblehead, under Capt. Arthur G. Robinson. To support these there were 13 overage, four-stack, flush-deck destroyers of the 1917-18 class, constituting Destroyer Squadron 29. These were:\n\nDestroyer Squadron 29: Capt. Herbert V. Wiley\n\nPaul Jones (FF), Lt. Comdr. John J. Hourihan\n\nDestroyer Division 57: Comdr. Edwin M. Crouch\n\nWhipple (F), Lt. Comdr. Eugene S. Karpe\n\nAlden, Lt. Comdr. Lewis E. Coley\n\nEdwards, J. D.

Paul H. Talbot (after January 29, Lt. Comdr. Edward N. Parker)\n\nPeary, Comdr. Harry H. Keith 1 (after December 10, Lt. Comdr. John M. Bermingham)\n\nPope, Lt. Comdr. Welford C. Blinn\n\n[John D.] Ford, Lt. Comdr. Jacob E. Cooper\n\nPillsbury, Lt. Comdr. Harold C. Pound\n\nA tender, the Black Hawk, under Comdr. George L. Harriss, was attached to this squadron.\n\nThe submarines were to prove effective in the ensuing campaign. Their number had been gradually increased so that there were 29 at Manila by December. They were tended by the Canopus (Comdr. Earl L. Sackett), Holland (Capt. Joseph W. Gregory), and Otus (Comdr. Joel Newsom). This last had no shop facilities. A submarine rescue vessel, Pigeon (Lt. Comdr. Richard E. Hawes, and later Lt. Comdr. Frank A. Davis) was also attached to the group. The submarines were organized as follows:\n\nSubmarine Division 21:\n\nSalmon (F), Lt. Comdr. Eugene B. McKinney\n\nSeal, Lt. Comdr. Kenneth C. Hurd\n\nSkipjack, Lt. Comdr. Charles L. Freeman\n\nSargo (FF), Lt. Comdr. Tyrrell D. Jacobs\n\nSaury, Lt. Comdr. John L. Burnside\n\nSpearfish, Lieut.

Hurst8\n\nOf great importance was Capt. Frank D. Wagner's Patrol Wing TEN, which had 30 PBY's. There were in addition a few smaller observation and some utility planes. Our aircraft were tended by the Langley (Capt. Felix B. Stump, relieved by Comdr. Robert P. McConnell), the Childs (Comdr. John L. Pratt), the Preston (Lt. Comdr. Max C. Stormes), and the Heron (Lt. Comdr. William L. Kabler).\n\nThere were the gunboats Tulsa (Lt. Comdr. Tillet S. Daniel) and the Asheville. Capt. Kenneth M. Hoeffel was relieved of the command of the latter by Lt. Comdr. Jacob W. Britt in December, in order that he might take command of the Inshore Patrol. The river gunboats Luzon (Lt. Comdr. George M. Brooke), and Oahu (Lt. Comdr. Douglas E.

The Wake had been stripped and left at Shanghai, ready for demolition, but it was captured by the Japanese soon after war broke out. The Isabel (Lieut. John W. Payne, Jr.) was a former yacht converted into a 20-knot gunboat.\n\nFinally there were the usual auxiliaries: the oilers Pecos (Comdr. Elmer P. Abernethy) and Trinity (Comdr. William Hibbs); several mine sweepers of the bird class, Bittern (Lieut. Thomas G. Warfield), Finch (Lt. Comdr. Thurlow W. Davison), Lark (Lt. Comdr. Hugh P. Thomason), Quail (Lt. Comdr. John H. Morrill), Tanager (Lt Comdr. Egbert A. Roth), Whippoorwill (Lt. Comdr. Charles A. Ferriter); and a tug, Napa (Lieut. Nathaniel M. Dial).\n\nSix PT boats, comprising MTB Squadron THREE under the command of Lieut. John D. Bulkeley, arrived in the latter part of September. These were to have a spectacular and well publicized history.\n\nCommander in Chief of our Asiatic Fleet was Admiral Thomas C. Hart. Admiral Hart also directly commanded the Coastal Frontier, leaving to Rear Admiral Francis W. Rockwell, Commandant of the Sixteenth Naval District, only the immediate defense zone off Manila and Subic Bay. Admiral Hart further took over personal command of the submarines, Patrol Wing TEN, and the PT boats. These responsibilities required a large staff, which was headed by Rear Admiral William R. Purnell.\n\nOur submarine divisions had been grouped in two squadrons, but with the arrival of additional submarines in November Admiral Hart discontinued the squadron organization. Thereafter the divisions were directly under the Commander of Submarines. On December 10th Capt. John Wilkes was appointed to that position because of his ability and previous experience.\n\nWhen in November it became evident that Rear Admiral William A. Glassford, Commander of the Yangtze Patrol, would be available, Admiral Hart decided to employ his great experience as commander of the task force. Upon his arrival in Manila about December 1st, Admiral Glassford set about forming his staff, and with the outbreak of war left at once for the Houston.\n\nDuring the first days of December our ships were disposed as follows: The Houston, after hurriedly mounting additional machine guns, was ordered to Iloilo to await the commander of the task force. The Boise\n\n--4--\n\narrived at Manila on December 4th, escorting an Army convoy. She refueled at once and sailed for Cebu to await further orders.\n\nThe Marblehead with four destroyers had been dispatched to Tarakan (Borneo) on November 24th with instructions to delay in that area. At the same time the Black Hawk and four destroyers had been sent to Balikpapan with similar instructions. When on December 6th news came of the Japanese expedition headed for Malaya, these destroyers were ordered to Singapore. They had just arrived there and were fueling when news of the sinking of the Prince of Wales and Repulse was received on December 10th. They immediately hurried north to search for survivors. It was expected that Japanese planes would be on the watch for rescue vessels, and when it was learned that British destroyers had picked up all surviving personnel our ships were ordered to clear the area before dawn. These four destroyers were withdrawn from Singapore before the middle of the month.\n\nOf our remaining destroyers, the Peary and the Pillsbury were in early December still at the navy yard undergoing repairs necessitated by a collision in October. Three more were on patrol in the Manila-Subic Bay area.\n\nAs for our aircraft, a squadron of PBY's was based on Sangley Point, and the others of the large planes were at Olongapo and Los Banos. A detachment of patrol planes operated from Davao Gulf (near Malalag), where the Preston was stationed, while some planes were at Balabac attended by the Heron. The seaplane tender Langley was at Manila, as were the oilers Trinity and Pecos, which had recently arrived from the Netherlands East Indies with cargoes of fuel.\n\nThe three submarine tenders, Canopus, Holland, and Otus were in the Mariveles-Manila area. Those submarines not at sea were well dispersed.\n\nAt 0300 on December 8th news of Pearl Harbor was received. At dawn came the first attack on the Philippines, when Japanese planes destroyed two PBY's on the water at Davao Gulf. A little later four enemy destroyers entered the gulf. The Preston at Malalag let them pass and then slipped out behind them. It was not till noon that the Army landing fields in northern Luzon were bombed and many of our planes destroyed.\n\nAdmiral Glassford immediately left by plane for the Houston at Iloilo. The Boise joined from Cebu. The Langley, Trinity, and Pecos with two destroyers slipped from Manila Bay under cover of darkness to join\n\n--5--\n\nthem and the little fleet headed for the Dutch oil ports via Makassar Strait. In crossing the Sulu Sea our ships sighted the tops of two vessels silhouetted against the evening glow, bearing about 255° T. It was thought that they were a Japanese light cruiser and destroyer, although identification was not certain. Apparently they did not sight our vessels, which were on the dark side of the horizon, and our cruisers, having the tenders to protect, did not develop the contact.\n\nIt had been planned in case of war to station the S-type submarines in defense of the northern Philippines. Eight large submarines were to be placed on enemy lines of communication. Eight more were retained as a reserve striking force, while the rest were held as relief for the patrols.\n\nThis plan was put into effect at once, except that the idea of a reserve striking force was quickly abandoned and the additional submarines were assigned stations, chiefly in defense of the Philippines. In addition to those in defensive positions, Pike was stationed at Hainan Strait, Pickerel off Camranh Bay (Indo-China), Sturgeon off the Pescadores (near Formosa), Sargo off Cochin China, Spearfish off French Indo-China, and Swordfish off Sama Bay (south coast of Hainan). These submarines stationed off enemy ports had very little success, probably because most enemy forces had already departed before they arrived.\n\nWITHDRAWAL FROM THE PHILIPPINES\n\nOn the early afternoon of December 10th Japanese bombers destroyed the navy yard at Cavite. More than 50 two-engine bombers came over in two waves and dropped their bombs from above the range of the nine 3-inch antiaircraft guns which were supposed to protect the station. There was no fighter opposition and the bombing was leisurely and accurate. Practically the entire establishment was destroyed. Among the ships the most serious loss was the large submarine Sealion, which was destroyed in dock by two direct hits. Seadragon escaped serious damage, thanks to the excellent work of Pigeon in pulling her away from the fire which enveloped Sealion. The Peary, which was completing repairs, received a hit on the foremast, but escaped with only minor damage and a few casualties.\n\nThis episode made it painfully evident that the enemy had complete control of the air over Manila and that we could no longer base our ships there. Our submarines did continue for a while to operate from Manila, but only with the greatest difficulty. They were in port as little as\n\n--6--\n\npossible and had to submerge during the day. The Canopus remained to service them. She was placed in shallow water and covered with a camouflage net, but was hit several times.\n\nSince it was clear that it was only a matter of time before the submarines would have to abandon Manila, Capt. Doyle, just relieved as Commander of Submarines, was sent south with the Otus and Holland to set up an alternate command in the south. They sailed on the evening of the 10th, accompanied by the gunboat Isabel and two destroyers. They were followed by a second group consisting of the Tulsa, the Asheville and two mine sweepers, Lark and Whippoorwill. All arrived safely in Borneo without having encountered any enemy ships. Admiral Hart later regretted that he did not send other small ships south at this time while they could still be taken out.\n\nThis movement of naval vessels to the south was followed by an exodus of merchant shipping. About 40 deep sea ships had sought refuge in Manila Harbor in addition to several smaller inter-island boats. During the bombing of Cavite on the 10th one medium size vessel had been hit and sunk. The following day Admiral Hart called a conference of owners and agents, at which he expressed the opinion that the small ships were as safe underway as in harbor. He advised that although the fleet could provide no escort, the larger ships had a fairly good chance of escape to the south. Practically all did depart safely during the next few days with cargoes of considerable aggregate value. As Admiral Hart remarked, \"We were lucky.\"\n\nThe destruction of the Army's fighter power made it too dangerous to continue to base the PBY's in the Philippines. This was made obvious on the 12th, when our PBY's were followed in by enemy fighters which attacked after our planes had landed. Seven PBY's were burned on the water. An enemy raid on Subic Bay on the 13th destroyed further patrol planes, leaving fewer than one full squadron. Admiral Hart on the 14th directed the remainder of Patrol Wing TEN to move to the Netherlands East Indies. The three tenders sailed south with such personnel and spare parts as they could carry. There were left in Manila only damaged planes, of which four were eventually repaired. This loss of air reconnaissance was a severe handicap to our submarines in their attempt to intercept enemy landing forces.\n\nThe Japanese landed about December 10th at Aparri on the north and at Vigan on the northwest coast of Luzon and on the 12th at Legaspi in\n\n--7--\n\nthe south. The Army expected the enemy to attempt his main landing at Lingayen Gulf, and some of our submarines were stationed accordingly. But when the enemy came, on the 21st, so skillfully did he bring in his transports that out of at least eighty we sank only one.\n\nMeanwhile the advance of Japanese forces in both north and south was accompanied by a rush of events which meant the end of our naval operations in the Philippines. On the 19th Sangley Point was heavily bombed, most of the aviation gas was destroyed and the radio was put out. On the 23d Admiral Hart learned that General MacArthur contemplated an early withdrawal to Bataan and Corregidor. The following day he learned that such a move was already underway and that Manila was to be declared an open city. This meant that the Canopus had to be moved, that submarine spare parts and Diesel oil had to be taken from Manila, and the remaining oil stores destroyed. Provisions had to be moved to Corregidor and Mariveles. It meant, in fact, that it would very shortly be impossible to operate our submarines from Manila. On the 24th and 25th bombs falling around the office building of the Commander of Submarines damaged equipment and supplies. On the 29th the Japs found the Canopus in her new location, and a stray bomb killed six men on board.\n\nAdmiral Hart had determined to remain on Luzon so long as the submarines were operating from Manila. Now that most of his fleet was already in the south and it was evident that the submarines would very soon have to follow, he decided to go directly to the Netherlands East Indies, rather than move into Corregidor as Admiral Rockwell had done on the 21st. One plane was sent south with staff officers on the evening of the 24th. At the last minute half the seats were given up to high Army officers. Admiral Hart had planned to leave the evening of the 25th, but during the day the Japanese found and destroyed the planes which were to take him. Consequently he left on the submarine Shark on the 26th. The two remaining destroyers, Pillsbury and Peary, were sent south the next day, after the Japanese had made a determined attempt to destroy them in the harbor. One of them, the Peary, had an eventful passage.\n\nManila Bay was bombed daily without opposition. Our submarines while at the base had to lie on the bottom during daylight, so that the crew had no opportunity for rest or recreation. Submarines at sea were therefore ordered to go south to the Malay Barrier when forced to leave\n\n--8--\n\ntheir stations. On December 31st the last of our submarines left Manila Bay, taking the submarine staff and as much material as possible. It was too late to get out Canopus and Pigeon. On January 2d the Japanese entered Manila unopposed.\n\nAdmiral Rockwell remained at Corregidor where a unified command was set up under General MacArthur. There was left at Corregidor and Mariveles the gunboats Mindanao, Luzon and Oahu, the mine sweepers Tanager, Finch and Quail, and a few tugs and ex-yachts for patrol. There were, too, the six PT boats of MTB Squadron THREE. Three Philippine Q-Boats were operated by the Army but serviced and maintained by the Navy.\n\nADVENTURE OF THE PEARY\n\nThe Peary had a narrow escape during the Japanese bombing of Manila Bay on the 26th. A few near hits caused slight damage, but by skillful maneuvering she escaped being hit by any of the 45 bombs which the enemy dropped at her. After this experience Admiral Rockwell gave permission for her to proceed south to join our task force.\n\nSailing the night of the 26th the Peary arrived at Campomanes Bay (Negros) the following morning. Since Japanese planes could be expected in this area, she was tied up along shore and camouflaged with green paint and palm branches. This work was completed just in time, for shortly afterwards 5 enemy bombers passed over, headed north. Apparently they did not see our destroyer, but as a precaution she was moved to Asia Bay and again camouflaged. Again Japanese planes passed over, southbound this time, again without detecting the Peary.\n\nWith evening the Peary sailed for Pilas Strait at 25 knots and did not reduce her speed until she found herself in the Celebes Sea next morning. At 0810 an enemy patrol bomber was sighted and appeared to be making a bombing approach. The Peary maneuvered and the bomber moved into the sun without dropping any bombs. From that position it shadowed our ship for the rest of the day.\n\nThe Peary had previous intelligence of an enemy submarine and cruiser off northern Borneo, and fearing that the plane had reported her position she increased her speed to 25 knots and set her course for Menado on the northeast tip of Celebes. At the same time she radioed a report that she was being followed by an enemy plane, but could get no response.\n\n--9--\n\nEarly in the afternoon two PBY's passed over but did not reply to the Andusrec9 challenge. In fact, it was their misapprehension of the situation which was responsible for the Peary's subsequent difficulties.\n\nAt 1420 three more Japanese patrol bombers appeared and began an attack which lasted about 2 hours. The planes attacked individually, each dropping two 500-pound bombs on each run. The Peary maneuvered violently and successfully, firing all her machine guns whenever the planes came within range. All except the fourth bomber had made two attacks when a torpedo plane was sighted low on the port bow. At about 500 yards it dropped two torpedoes. The Peary's starboard engine was reversed, the ship swung sharply around, and the torpedoes passed ahead of her. A few seconds later a second torpedo plane came in on the port quarter and also dropped two torpedoes. With right full rudder the stern swung around and out of their path as they passed along the Peary's starboard side only about 10 yards from the ship.\n\nThe fourth bomber approached from the stern, attempting to make a bombing attack to coincide with that of the torpedo plane. The Peary, which was almost at a standstill, rang for emergency full speed ahead; the engines responded well and the bombs fell harmlessly 100 yards astern.\n\nIn pulling out from their attacks, the torpedo planes attempted to strafe the Peary, but our own machine gunners effectively discouraged this maneuver and the planes turned away without doing any damage except a few holes in the stacks.\n\nAs evening was now approaching it seemed unlikely that the Japanese would make any further attacks before dark and it was decided not to go into Menado for shelter but to pass on through Banca Strait into Molucca Passage. In passing Menado at 1743 the signal searchlight was used to ask if the strait was mined, but no reply could be obtained. The strait was safely passed and the Peary was off Kema when three Lockheed Hudson planes with British markings approached from the stern. As the first passed ahead the Andusrec challenge was made on the destroyer's signal searchlight and it was thought that the pilot waved in answer, but the remaining two planes came on for a glide bombing attack. The Peary opened fire and swung hard to starboard, so that the first bomb fell wide on the port beam. As the ship heeled over in her turn one of\n\n____________\n\n9 Allied recognition signal.\n\n--10--\n\nthe machine gunners fell overboard and was last seen swimming in his life jacket toward a nearby island.\n\nEach plane made two attacks, dropping a 250-pound shrapnel bomb on each run. The Peary succeeded in avoiding all except the last, which was a close miss. It hit 10 yards off the port propeller guard and shrapnel from it entered the steering engine room, breaking steam pipes and shearing the main steering ropes. Other fragments killed a man at a machine gun on the fire control platform and set fire to a 4-inch cartridge. G. A. Fryman, Fireman Third Class, seized it and threw it overboard before it exploded.\n\nAs the planes pulled out of their glide they strafed the ship but without doing any damage.\n\nIt was soon discovered that the starboard engine's Kingsbury thrust had been damaged and was overheating. The prolonged maneuvering at high speed had reduced fuel to a dangerously low level and there was a shortage of feed water. Consequently it was decided to put in at Maitara Island (near Ternate), where the Peary arrived in the early morning. She was tied up along the reef and again covered with palm branches. Supplies were obtained and the thrust repaired, so that she was able to get underway for Ambon on the evening of the 30th. The repairs proved inadequate, so that she proceeded on the port engine alone and arrived at noon the next day.\n\nAt Ambon it was discovered that the PBY's which had seen the Peary crossing the Celebes Sea had reported a small Japanese cruiser proceeding at high speed toward Menado escorted by a Japanese bomber. The Australians were apologetic for their bombing. At least there was the comfort that our allies had shown better marksmanship than the Japanese.\n\nThe Heron, which was sent north to assist the Peary, was herself bombed in a protracted action in Molucca Strait on the 31st. Shrapnel from near hits penetrated the ship's side and started fires in the paint locker and forward hold. About the middle of the afternoon a 100-pound shrapnel bomb struck the foremast near the top and sprayed the ship with splinters which did considerable damage. The Heron acquitted herself well, however, in spite of her 12-knot speed, and succeeded in shooting down a large enemy seaplane.\n\nESTABLISHMENT IN THE NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES\n\nThus by the end of December our Navy had been compelled to abandon the Philippines. The few small craft which remained there\n\n--11--\n\nassisted in the defense of Bataan. The Conopus continued to do excellent work in spite of bombings in which she was hit; one of the gunboats assisted in blasting out a dangerous enemy force which landed behind our Army's lines; and the PT Boats rendered extremely valuable service in spite of constantly increasing difficulties of fuel and repairs. Our submarines continued some patrols in Philippine waters but there could no longer be any major naval activity in the north.\n\nThe Army's stubborn defense of Bataan, while it occupied a considerable number of the enemy for several months, could not, of course, prevent the Japanese from establishing bases in the Philippines for further conquest. Even before the end of December the Japanese were preparing bases at Davao (on Mindanao) and at Jolo (in the Sulu Archipelago) for their next attacks. On December 27th Patrol Wing TEN sent six PBY's north to attack shipping at Jolo, but Japanese fighters intercepted them and shot down four. Fortunately many of our men were saved. The yellow tide was rolling on, with only an eddy about Bataan, which still stood against it. Already our submarines were being forced to operate farther to the south in their attacks on enemy communications. But they were doing better. On January 7th Seawolf came into Soerabaja after having sunk four Japanese ships off Hainan, thus equaling the record of the most successful Dutch submarines.\n\nMeanwhile our Navy was reorganizing in the south. The Navy and War Departments, correctly judging that the Malay Barrier might not remain secure, chose Port Darwin in Australia for development as a major base and our auxiliaries were sent there. Darwin's existing facilities were poor, its situation in some respects disadvantageous and exposed, and it was too far away for effective operations north of the Soenda chain. Therefore our operational command was set up at Soerabaja. The command post of our task force was already established in space supplied by the Dutch. Admiral Glassford remained in the Houston in command of the task force and Admiral Purnell, Chief of Staff, exercised a de facto fleet command. When Admiral Hart arrived on January 1st he added his establishment. Facilities were good except for radio, and our fleet personnel did well in remedying this deficiency rigging up apparatus from parts obtained from a variety of sources.\n\nThe Dutch Naval Command was in Batavia and Vice Admiral Conrad E. L. Helfrich urged Admiral Hart to join him there. However, with our prospective main base at Port Darwin and with a large pro-\n\n--12--\n\nportion of our ships engaged in convoying army ships through Torres Strait our \"center of gravity\" was in the east, and Soerabaja was better suited to our needs. Meanwhile it was learned that the British Far Eastern Command had left Singapore. While Admiral Layton and most of his staff were at Colombo awaiting reinforcements, a secondary command post was to be established in Batavia.\n\nAll these arrangements were overshadowed, however, by the question of a unified command. On January 10th Gen. Sir Archibald P. Wavell, R. A., arrived to take over the Supreme Command, for which he chose the title of ABDACOM. His staff organization was as follows:\n\nIntendant General (and Deputy ABDACOM): Lt. Gen. George H. Brett, U.S.A.\n\nChief of Staff: Maj. Gen. Sir Henry R. Pownall, R. A.10\n\nIntelligence: Col. Leonard F. Field, R. A.\n\nNavy Operational Command: Admiral Thomas C. Hart, U. S. N.(ABDAFLOAT).\n\nChief of Staff:11 Rear Admiral Arthur P. E. Palliser, R. N.\n\nAir Operational Command: Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard E. C. Peirse, R.A.F.12 (ABDAIR).\n\nArmy Operational Command: Lt. Gen. Hein ter Poorten, N. E. I. A. (ABDARM).\n\nChief of Staff: Maj. Gen. Sir Ian S. Playfair, R. A.13\n\nThe next week or so was spent in organization of the new command. Consequently Admiral Hart was engaged in Batavia most of the time after January 9th and could visit the American operational base at Soerabaja only briefly. General Wavell formally took over his command on January 15th and 3 days later established his headquarters at a mountain resort hotel at Lembang, 10 miles north of Badoeng. The site was chosen because it permitted dispersal and (it was hoped) offered some security from air attack. Its remoteness from the sea was some handicap for the naval command, but Admiral Hart agreed to join it in the interest of unity. Communications were far from adequate and remained so in spite of hard work for their improvement. To keep contact with American operations at Soerabaja Admiral Hart established at\n\n___________\n\n10 Formerly Commander in Chief in Malaya.\n\n11 This position was first offered to Capt. van Staveren, Admiral Helfrich's Chief of Staff, but he could not be spared for it.\n\n12 Air Marshal Peirse was in England, so that General Brett was in charge of air pending his arrival.\n\n13 Formerly Chief of Staff to General Pownall in Malaya.\n\n--13--\n\nLembang an American radio and coding unit, which proved of tremendous value.\n\nThe machinery of a unified command was thus established, but the obstacles to its smooth working were tremendous. Admiral Hart indicated the nature of the difficulties: \"ABDACOM had a very complicated command, involving four Army, four Navy and six Air organizations. Consequently there was a great deal to do in organizing and equipping a GHQ, which naturally required time. In the face of an advancing enemy there was, of course, not time. The command function had to be exercised; but we never reached a condition under which it could be so exercised that there would be certainty that information and clear directives would be transmitted with despatch.\" There was, too, the difference in language, always a handicap, even in such small ways as the inability of our officers to read Dutch charts and sailing instructions, which were superior to ours for Netherlands East Indies waters. Finally, beyond the major common interest, there were differences in national attitudes which made it difficult to frame our ultimate strategy. For instance, when the time came it was the natural and courageous determination of the Dutch to make a desperate, last ditch stand in Java. The British view was that it was more important to preserve our forces intact for a moment when they might be used to greater advantage. How could such views be reconciled?\n\nThe actual solution was that in fact each nation retained control of its own forces. Admiral Palliser was consulted when it was a question of using British ships, and Admiral Helfrich whenever Dutch forces were concerned. The sincere desire - and desperate necessity - for cooperation made this system work, but it was not a unified command in the strict sense.\n\nThe attention of the Supreme Command was focused on Malaya and Burma, where things were going badly. General Wavell was for some time absent from Lembang to visit Singapore and a second time to visit Rangoon. The British naval interest was chiefly in convoying troops to Singapore, in which the Dutch assisted. This work was necessary, but this employment of cruisers and destroyers of course prevented the creation of a striking force which might break up Japanese amphibious expeditions advancing from other directions. The Dutch were interested in convoying their own merchant shipping, but at the same time worked for the formation of a striking force.\n\n--14--\n\nThe news that the Japanese, operating from Davao and Jolo, had taken Tarakan (Borneo) and Menado (Celebes) on January 11th served as a reminder that while one prong of the Japanese advance was threatening Singapore there was another equally dangerous to the east.\n\nJapanese tactics were becoming clear. They depended heavily upon air power. After building up their force at some base, their planes proceeded to overcome Allied air opposition (when there was any) at the next point of attack. Sometimes this was done by seaplanes, sometimes by carrier planes, or, if the distance was not too great, by land-based planes. Then they sent down heavily loaded transports, keeping to shallow water and screening them heavily against submarines, and landed men and even heavy equipment without wharves. Generally the distance was too short to permit our naval forces to attack them en route. As soon as they were in control of the new area, they repaired the air field and set about gathering force for the next advance.\n\nThese tactics were well adapted to the nature of the Dutch East Indies. The absence of interior communications in most of the islands-outside Java and Sumatra there are only about 50 miles of railroad in the whole group, and very few roads-meant that it was necessary to seize only a few coastal points and to control the sea and air in their vicinity. Since the Japanese maintained the initiative it was simple for them to build up a local sea and air superiority for each move.\n\nIn one sense, air power was decisive. It was the Japanese air force which had virtually driven us from Manila 2 weeks before their ground force entered the city and which later made Soerabaja and Port Darwin untenable in the same manner. It was their air force which dogged our ships on passage and on occasion pounded our striking force before it could approach its objective. Our only really successful surface engagements were fought at night or when for some reason Japanese planes could not be present. Their planes gave them excellent intelligence of our movements and often denied us information of theirs. Admiral Hart was keenly aware of this and worked hard for closer cooperation of our air and naval forces, but it was never possible to plan an operation with air support.\n\nTo oppose Japanese air power we had some Army bombers based on Java, and a few fighters, in addition to the British and Dutch planes.\n\nOur greatest weakness was in fighters, of which we never had enough adequately to protect our bases. Our Navy relied heavily on Captain\n\n--15--\n\nWagner's Patrol Wing TEN. This group, flying their highly vulnerable PBY's, did magnificent work, but they led a hunted existence, dodging into clouds to escape Jap fighters while on mission, moving from place to place to escape destruction on the water at home. Only the mobility of our tenders made their continued operation possible.\n\nENGAGEMENT OFF BALIKPAPAN14\n\nJANUARY 23-4\n\nRaid of United States Destroyers in Makassar Strait - January 23-24.\n\nBoth arms of the Japanese pincer were closing a little tighter. In the west the British were beginning to talk of their army's retreating all the way to Singapore. In the east the Japanese completed their occupation of Tarakan, while the ships which had landed their force at Menado were reported gathering at Kema. This latter activity seemed to point to a movement to Kendari (southeast Celebes) and Ambon in the near future. Thus by the middle of January it was evident that the Japanese were preparing for another move down either Makassar Strait or Molucca Strait or both.\n\nOur submarines were stationed accordingly. Two Dutch submarines were ordered to patrol the western side of Makassar Strait between I° and 2° south (i.e., off Balikpapan) and Admiral Hart directed that three American submarines be placed in the strait also.\n\nMeanwhile Admiral Hart planned to attack the enemy force gathering at Kema. It was to be a night torpedo attack by destroyers supported by the Marblehead. Three submarines were stationed to cover the return of our ships. The attack was to take place on the night of the 17th and was to be in conjunction with an attack by Army planes operating from Kendari. Our ships had already made the greater part of the difficult run toward Kema when Pike and Permit, which had been sent in for reconnaissance, reported that no enemy forces of importance were present, and the attack was cancelled. A few days later (on the 21st) Seawolf saw a convoy assembling off Kema but could not attack. Not long afterwards this force came down and took Kendari.\n\nIt was next planned to make an attack in Makassar Strait, already patrolled by our submarines. One of these, the S-36, went aground on January 19th at Taka Bakang. It proved impossible to get her off and she had to be abandoned. On the 20th there was a Dutch army report of a large convoy heading southward toward the important oil port of\n\n____________\n\n14 Also called the Makassar Strait action.\n\n--16--\n\nBalikpapan. That night Porpoise and Pickerel were stationed in Makassar Strait between North Watcher and Mangkalihat, with Sturgeon to back them up, while Spearfish, Saury, and S-40 were placed off Balikpapan.\n\nOn January 22d Porpoise and Pickerel reported the enemy force moving. Sturgeon to the south had just uncoded the message when she made sound contact with a multiple screw ship which she thought was either a cruiser or a carrier. She sent two torpedoes into this vessel, but had no opportunity to observe results. This event she celebrated by the triumphant message, \"Sturgeon no longer virgin.\" Her maidenhood was well lost. There had been considerable air activity in the area on the previous day and there was none the following day, so that our surface vessels were able to make their attack and withdrawal without sighting an enemy plane. This unusual circumstance indicates that the Sturgeon probably damaged or sank a carrier. Apart from this, our submarines had no success in breaking up the enemy expedition.\n\nIt was planned to make a surface attack on this enemy force similar to that planned in the abortive attempt on Kema. Houston was on important convoy duty and was not available, so that it was planned to conduct our raid with four destroyers, the Ford, Pope, Parrott, and Paul Jones, supported by the Boise and Marblehead. This force was commanded by Admiral Glassford, with Comdr. Paul H. Talbot in command of the destroyers.\n\nThe destroyers fueled from the Marblehead in Koepang Bay, Timor, and started north. On the way through Sape Strait (between Soembawa and Komodo Islands) the Boise struck an uncharted pinnacle rock.\n\nA long gash was torn in her bottom near the keel, so that she had to return at slow speed to port on the south coast of Java. There it was found that she would have to go to India for repairs and so she did not participate further in the campaign. Admiral Glassford transferred his flag to the Marblehead, but difficulty with a turbine reduced her speed to 15 knots. Therefore the destroyers were ordered on ahead to make the attack, while the cruiser trailed along to provide air reconnaissance and to cover their withdrawal.\n\nPatrol Wing TEN had maintained contact with the enemy force and reported 9 transports, 4 cruisers and 14 destroyers moving toward Balikpapan in small groups. The PBY's conducted this reconnaissance without meeting any air opposition, due probably to Sturgeon's success a day\n\n--17--\n\nor two earlier. On the afternoon of the 23d Dutch bombers attacked the convoy and claimed hits on 2 cruisers, 4 transports, and a destroyer.\n\nOur four destroyers were just south of the Postillon Islands, about midway between Soembawa and southwest Celebes, when on the morning of the 23d they received orders from CINCAF to move northward for the attack. They proceeded at 22 to 25 knots in order to arrive off Hoek Mandar by nightfall. There were heavy north swells running in the lower part of Makassar Strait and our destroyers took on several, which broke bridge windows and buckled spray shields.\n\nDuring the afternoon Comdr. Talbot issued his orders for the action: \"Primary weapon torpedoes. Primary objective transports. Cruisers as necessary to accomplish mission. Endeavor launch torpedoes at close range before being discovered...Set torpedoes each tube for normal spread. Be prepared to fire single shots if size of target warrants. Will try to avoid action en route...Use own discretion in attacking independently when targets located. When torps are fired close with all guns. Use initiative and determination.\"\n\nCourse was set directly for Mandar Bay in order to deceive the enemy reconnaissance planes which were expected, but the only patrol plane sighted proved to be one of our own. An hour after sunset our little force changed course to the northwest and, passing Cape Mandar abeam to starboard, struck out across Makassar Strait toward Borneo. Speed was increased to 27 knots, just about the maximum that their old engines could maintain. There was concern on board Pope whether she could hold that speed, but she did.\n\nA little after 2200 Java time, as our ships were approaching the Little Paternoster group, what appeared to be a searchlight beam was seen on the horizon ahead and course was changed to avoid a possible enemy contact. A little later, course was set directly for Balikpapan with the expectation of arriving about 0300.\n\nTrack of United States Destroyers off Balikpapan - January 23-24.\n\nAt 2357 as our ships approached Balikpapan a light was seen far ahead. At first it appeared to be a searchlight but a little later was seen to be a fire, now flaring up, now subsiding. It was evidently in the water some distance from shore, but sometime afterward a second fire was seen at Balikpapan itself. Apparently the Dutch bombers had done a good afternoon's work. Perhaps because of the fires a light haze hung over the water and visibility, which had been good, decreased. The seas had moderated considerably during the run up the strait.\n\n--18--\n\nTop: Docks and oil refineries, Balikpapan, Borneo. Bottom: The light cruiser Marblehead.\n\nCourse was set to make certain of arriving at Balikpapan north of the pilot ship and well clear of the mine field. Our ships were now drawing close. The first contact with the enemy came at 0245 when a column of several enemy destroyers appeared ahead, crossing our course from starboard to port. They challenged by blue blinker tube, but our ships only turned a little to starboard to avoid closer contact. The lookout on the Ford thought he saw the Japanese destroyers turn and follow to investigate.\n\nAs our ships thus sailed through the enemy's patrol they were in column, moving at high speed. The John D. Ford, with Comdr. Talbot aboard, was in the lead, followed by Pope, Parrott, and Paul Jones, in that order. They were in constant communication by voice radio, with transmitters set up on the bridge of each destroyer, except for the Paul Jones, on which the transmitter failed.\n\nIt is difficult to form an entirely accurate picture of the events of the following hour, during which our little column steamed back and forth among the enemy vessels, firing first their torpedoes and then their guns at dim outlines of ships, spreading havoc and confusion among the Japanese. Two or three minutes after passing the enemy's destroyer screen several ships were sighted on the port bow, dimly silhouetted against the glow from the fire at Balikpapan. Someone on the Ford counted nine ships 5,000-6,000 yards distant. It seems likely that this was one of the larger groups scattered along the shore and it was probably in this group that we sank several when our destroyers turned back south.\n\nA minute or two after sighting these vessels, the Ford, still leading the column northward, met an enemy destroyer on opposite course which passed close to starboard. The Ford fired a torpedo, but it missed astern. Pope could not bring her tubes to bear in time, and Parrott, warned by voice radio to \"get him,\" fired five torpedoes (fired by percussion at the tubes; it was intended to fire only three) as the ship passed 500 to 1,000 yards to starboard. But the trainers had not been able to swing the tubes rapidly enough and all five passed astern of the target. This broadside left Parrott with only one torpedo in her starboard battery. The Paul Jones bringing up the rear fired one torpedo, but it too apparently missed.\n\nAt 0300 Parrott sighted a group of three ships 4,000 to 6,000 yards to port and fired three torpedoes at the largest. This time her aim was good, for a few minutes later there was a tremendous explosion in the midst of the group and flames shot up 500 feet into the air.\n\n--19--\n\nTop: The destroyer Bulmer. All destroyers of the United states Asiatic Fleet were of this type. Bottom: Amboina Island.\n\nMeanwhile Comdr. Talbot in Ford decided that our ships had pretty well run through the enemy and started a turn to the right to run back through. Ford had already swung around to a course of 090° when she heard the explosion of Parrott's hit, off her starboard beam as she was then heading.\n\nAt 0307, now heading back southward for another run through the enemy, Ford sighted a large ship to starboard and fired three torpedoes, apparently without success. At about the same time, or perhaps a little before, Pope coming along behind Ford fired a torpedo at an enemy destroyer (possibly the same ship) which she passed abeam to starboard, but it missed.\n\nAs our column steamed back south Pope saw several heavy ships about 4,000 yards to starboard blinking lights, seemingly as a result of the explosion caused by Parrott's hit a few minutes before. (This group may have been the one first sighted, outlined by the light on shore.) Pope fired her five remaining starboard torpedoes at the group and in about 4 minutes was rewarded by two large explosions in the area of the target. Meanwhile, very shortly after Pope fired her five torpedoes, Parrott behind her fired her one remaining starboard torpedo at a destroyer 2,000-3,000 yards to starboard-possibly one of the group at which Pope had fired. Two minutes later there was a great explosion on the destroyer, a column of flame leapt toward the sky and when it died down there was only wreckage where the destroyer had been. At about the same time Paul Jones, coming up behind, had fired a torpedo at a ship on her starboard bow. There were two quick explosions on the ship which broke up and sank immediately. As the Parrott at the same moment claimed a hit (by voice radio) it seems likely that she and the Paul Jones fired at the same target. It is impossible to say whether this too was the same explosion that Pope observed or whether each destroyer scored a hit.\n\nPerhaps it was a minute later that Pope (at 0309 according to her log) fired a torpedo at a destroyer to port, but could see no explosion. In another minute Parrott reported that she had hit the destroyer Pope had fired at, and the explosion was seen. It is not clear whether this destroyer was the same as that described in the preceding paragraph, or whether it was a separate success. The times were about the same, but the first was to starboard while this was said to be to port.\n\n--20--\n\nAt 0312 Pope reported a submarine to starboard sending recognition signals, and a moment later Parrott sighted what seemed to be a submarine on the surface.\n\nFrom this point on there is a greater discrepancy in the times noted in the logs of our destroyers and it is even more difficult to know what happened. The column next swung westward. (Ford puts it at 0320, but the others put it somewhat earlier.) Soon after turning, Ford fired a torpedo to port. Pope not long after turning also fired her remaining torpedoes at a destroyer which passed on her port beam (possibly the same ship at which Ford had fired). Parrott, coming along behind Pope, heard Pope report that she had fired torpedoes at the enemy destroyer and that it had fired some at her. Parrott then fired her three remaining port torpedoes at the destroyer, believing that Pope had missed. There was an explosion near the stern of the destroyer and a high column of smoke rose (Pope reported two explosions). It is not clear whether Pope or Parrott deserves credit for this hit. At the same moment both ships saw torpedo wakes and both felt jars as if they had been hit by torpedoes which did not explode. Possibly they had struck logs or floating wreckage.\n\nWhile this was taking place Paul Jones in the rear of our column at 0322 observed a transport on her port beam on a course to cross astern of her. Paul Jones fired one torpedo, and, as the transport turned sharply to the left (perhaps to avoid it), followed with a second which caught her on the starboard bow. \"This ship was later observed sinking with stern high out of the water.\"\n\nBy this time Pope and Parrott had exhausted their torpedoes and were directed to use gunfire if further targets appeared. This began what might be called the second phase of the action. Having run through the enemy group, our ships made a loop to the left and turned north through it again. Back on a northerly course Pope at 0325 opened fire with her guns on two destroyers, then a transport, then another destroyer. As she passed at high speed her gunners could not remain long on any one target, and the flash of the guns blinded the lookouts, but she thought she got three hits on a cargo vessel and probable hits on the destroyers. Five minutes later Parrott fired starshells to illuminate a ship (believed to be a destroyer) 2,500 yards to port. Seven rounds of 4-inch shells were fired\n\n--21--\n\nat the enemy ship before it was lost from sight. Possibly there was one hit. At the same time Paul Jones fired a torpedo at a ship challenging on her port beam and believed she scored a hit.\n\nShortly afterwards Ford passed the smoking hulk of a merchant ship standing on end with lifeboats nearby. As our column swung by this wreck Ford slowed and stopped, believing she was approaching the edge of the mine field. Pope behind her swerved sharply to avoid ramming her, and Parrott coming up at full speed, put her rudder hard right to avoid colliding with the hulk. As she turned she saw gun flashes ahead. Ford and Pope were in a melee with enemy destroyers. Our column split and our ships lost contact with each other. Pope, Parrott, and Paul Jones all made turns to the right and began to withdraw to the south. Ford continued to run up to the northwest close to the shore.\n\nShortly after losing the rest of the column Ford sighted a destroyer 2,500 yards to port. Seeing this destroyer fire torpedoes, she backed her port engine full to avoid them. Then resuming her course she fired a torpedo at a large merchantman to port and followed with gunfire. The blast of the resulting explosion could be felt on board the Ford, and the merchantman was seen to list about 45° to port. At about the same time (0347) Ford herself was hit by a shell, our only casualty of the entire action. It did only slight damage, however. It was of small caliber (about 3-inch) and hit the port side of the after deck house, where the torpedo workshop was located. The small fire which it started was quickly controlled.\n\nChanging course to the right for a moment, Ford passed under the bow of a merchant ship, then swinging left she passed close by another which seemed to be on fire. She opened fire on this with her main battery and obtained several hits, and in addition strafed it with her machine guns as she passed. She then completed her turn to the left, steadied out on a course of 120° and began her retirement.\n\nAs our ships withdrew Pope opened fire at about 0350 on a destroyer. Parrott, seeing shells falling around her, told her that she was probably firing on her sister ship, and action ceased before any damage had been done. Aside from this the withdrawal was uneventful. Parrott and Pope joined around 0350, and Paul Jones came up about 0400. Ford found the others about daybreak.\n\nAt 0700, being well clear of the enemy area, speed was reduced to 23 knots in order to insure that fuel would last to make port. Shortly\n\n--22--\n\nafterwards our destroyers sighted a plane from the Marblehead which signaled that the cruiser was 50 miles to the south. Some time later the Marblehead was sighted. The destroyers formed a screen around her and the little force moved southward.\n\nOur destroyers had performed the almost incredible feat of steaming back and forth through a considerably superior enemy force for over an hour. Surprise had, of course, been the major element in our success. Our plan of using torpedoes first probably prevented the Japanese from realizing what had happened for at least half an hour. Evidently they at first thought that they had got into a mine field or that a submarine was among them. It was a particularly fortunate circumstance that a column of their own destroyers was under way on patrol at the time. That may explain why our own destroyers excited no more suspicion than they did at first or why the Japanese hesitated to fire on them. The Japanese fear of firing on their own vessels was evident, while due to our column formation we were under no such restraint until near the end of the action when our ships became separated.\n\nIt seems fairly certain that we sank at least 5 or 6 ships. Two of these, because of the nature of the explosion and of their burning, were thought to have been fuel ships. One was a destroyer, which was completely demolished, and at least 2 merchantmen were sunk. It is entirely possible that there were other hits unrecorded due to the poor visibility, and there seems no doubt that several ships were further damaged by gunfire. The commander of a Dutch submarine, which was present through the action and next morning, reported that our forces had destroyed 13 enemy ships, but there is some doubt as to the accuracy of his count.\n\nOur men were disappointed in the results of their torpedo fire. The suddenness with which targets presented themselves, the high speed of our ships, the close ranges and shallow water probably explain the small percentage of hits. It is comforting that the Japs did worse, for they undoubtedly fired several torpedoes at our ships.\n\nThe whole action took place within an area of only 4 or 5 miles radius, with its center about 4 or 5 miles northeast of Balikpapan lightship.\n\nOur own submarines and two Dutch which were in the vicinity had been warned to keep clear of our surface attack. One Dutch submarine was, however, actually on the spot and left only when, as the commanding officer put it, \"I saw that my friends were doing very well.\" The following morning this submarine torpedoed a Japanese cruiser from such close\n\n--23--\n\nrange that the explosion damaged the submarine. It had to lie on the bottom till dark, when it proceeded on the surface to its base.\n\nOn the forenoon of January 25th United States Army bombers raided the enemy ships left at Balikpapan and sank two transports anchored there. Twelve Japanese pursuit planes (the first seen since the action) attempted to intercept our planes. Five of the Japanese aircraft were shot down.\n\nDARK INTERLUDE\n\nThe Japanese expedition in Makassar Strait had been heavily hit, and Army B-17's gave it some additional touches on January 28th and again on February 2d, when they sank two transports. Our action had not prevented the Japanese from taking Balikpapan, but they were stalled there for some time.\n\nEast of Celebes, however, the Japanese continued to progress. On the 21st they began a series of bombing attacks on points in northeastern New Guinea and in the Bismarck Archipelago. They followed these by landing at Kavieng in New Ireland and at Rabaul in New Britain, where the RAAF bombed their ships three times within a week. About the same time they landed at Kieta on Bougainville Island in the Solomons.\n\nIn Borneo they advanced overland from Sarawak, which they had controlled since early January, to new points on the western coast. On January 29th they took Pemangkat. Within a few days they controlled Pontianak and soon they were pushing beyond. At the same time planes operating from Samarinda and Balikpapan began to bomb Bandjermasin on the southeast coast. These movements threatened to bring them opposite Java and southeastern Sumatra.\n\nHad we been able to strike at other expeditions as effectively as in Makassar Strait the Japanese advance might have been slowed sufficiently to permit help to arrive from the United States. But we could not strike again immediately. The Marblehead required repairs to her turbine. Our destroyers were beginning to show the effects of having been almost constantly at sea since the beginning of the war. Moreover, many of their torpedo tubes were empty and no more torpedoes were to be had at once. Our larger submarines had been running patrols of 50 days and our smaller ones 30 or 40 days, and often when they were returning to port for a badly needed rest a new emergency required their turning again to sea.\n\n--24--\n\nThe Dutch ships were in better condition, but, acting on information which later proved inaccurate, Admiral Helfrich had sent his fleet northwest into Karimata Channel. Consequently it was not available to strengthen our striking force in the east at this critical time.\n\nThe British were concentrating their attention and naval forces in the west, where the situation was critical. In Burma they were holding the line of the Salween River, but in the south, Moulmein, anchor of their right flank, was seriously threatened. The last reinforcements were being thrown into Singapore \"under a hail of bombs running clear down to Banka Strait\" and at the cost of the Empress of Japan sunk and the Duchess of Bedford and the U.S.S. Wakefield damaged. By the end of January ABDACOM decided to withdraw the British troops in Malaya to Singapore Island, and he again left Lembang to visit the great base. While General Wavell believed that Singapore might hold out indefinitely, it had become useless as a naval base. The Royal Navy was closing its dockyard - a bitter blow. ABDACOM's decision meant too that the RAF was forced to move from Singapore and base operations on Sumatra. But already the northern and eastern ports of Sumatra were too dangerous for merchant shipping and vessels had been sunk at Padang on the west coast and at Emmahaven just below.\n\nIn the face of these difficulties we did the best we could. Admiral Hart felt that the enemy force which had regathered in Makassar Strait and which again offered \"some attractive targets\" should be our next objective. Submarines were placed to protect Bandjermasin and Makassar, while repairs on the Marblehead and our destroyers were rushed to completion for another raid up the straits. But as our ships worked northward on the afternoon of February 1st they were sighted and shadowed by a Japanese plane. That night there was bright moonlight and our commander prudently decided not to attack a superior force (as our air reconnaissance had reported it to be) after the element of surprise had obviously been lost.\n\nIt was known that the Japanese were building up a force at Kendari and Staring Bay on the southeast coast of Celebes. While we were occupied with our unsuccessful attempt in Makassar Strait they moved in the Molucca Sea. On February 1st they bombed Laha airfield on Ceram and subsequently occupied it. On the same day a large convoy, reported to consist of 10 transports, 10 destroyers and 6 cruisers, approached Amboina, chief Dutch stronghold on the eastern flank of the Indies. The\n\n--25--\n\nDutch and Australian air force there had been pretty well whittled down during previous raids, and within 2 or 3 days the island was in the possession of the Japanese. With it we lost a good battalion of Australians and \"one of the best units of the Netherlands East Indies Army.\"\n\nThe difficulty in repairing and servicing our ships had convinced Admiral Hart that Port Darwin was too far removed from the scene of operations. Moreover, it had proven unsuitable as a base in other respects, and on January 29th he ordered our auxiliaries to move westward to Netherlands East Indies harbors. The ships sailed on February 3d and Holland and Otus arrived at Tjilatjap on the 10th. The move was late. On the same day that our auxiliaries left Darwin the Japanese, operating from their new bases, crossed the Java Sea to bomb Soerabaja and several other points in Java, as well as Timor. It was the first of a series of raids which were to make Soerabaja first difficult, then utterly untenable as a base. On this first raid most of the Dutch fighters were shot out of the air. Our own Navy planes escaped only because our tenders, always on the move, enabled them always to be elsewhere than where the Japs expected to find them.\n\nThe Japanese now controlled all the northern approaches to the Indies and would soon be in a position to move directly against the Soenda chain itself. It appeared that the bombing of Java and Timor marked the beginning of the \"softening up\" process. The need for a striking force capable of breaking up the next Japanese expedition was obvious.\n\nTo consider the creation of such a force Admiral Hart as ABDAFLOAT called a conference of Admiral Helfrich, Admiral Glassford, and Commodore Collins. They met at Lembang on February 2d. The Dutch cruisers and destroyers were now available and some British vessels had been released from the Singapore convoy. Of the American ships, Boise sailed for Colombo with a long gash in her bottom, but the Houston and Marblehead and some destroyers were ready for action. The Langley had just been sent to Fremantle on the southwest coast of Australia to load Army P-40 planes so desperately needed now in Java. It was decided to put the Dutch Rear Admiral, Karel W. F.M. Doorman, in charge of the force which was to assemble east of Java as soon as possible. It was realized that the tactical handling of the little fleet would present some difficulties, but there was no opportunity for joint training.\n\nIt looked as if we might at last have a force capable of smashing the\n\n--26--\n\nnext Japanese expedition even if it should be heavily protected. But the promise of this start was short-lived.\n\nACTION OF MADOERA STRAIT15\n\nFEBRUARY 4\n\nAction of Madoera Strait - February 4.\n\nOn February 1st our air reconnaissance had reported a considerable enemy convoy at Balikpapan, presumably preparing for an advance on Makassar or Bandjermasin or both. It was reported to consist of 20 transports, 3 cruisers, and 10 destroyers. Enemy aircraft carriers were thought to be at Kendari or operating south of Celebes. Our plan was to strike this convoy before it could reach its objective. The words of Admiral Doorman's directive were: \"Enemy transports will be attacked and destroyed in a night attack.\"\n\nAdmiral Doorman's striking force consisted of four cruisers, the De Ruyter (Admiral Doorman's flag), Houston, Marblehead, and Tromp; American Destroyer Division 58 led by Commander Binford on Stewart, with the Edwards, Barker, and Bulmer; and a Dutch destroyer division commanded by Lt. Comdr. Krips on the Van Ghent, with the Piet Hein and Banckert.\n\nOur ships were at anchor in Bounder Roads, Madoera Island, when the Japanese planes passed over to bomb Soerabaja on February 3d and of course sighted our force. Nonetheless Admiral Doorman proceeded with his plans. Leaving in separate groups about midnight our vessels were to rendezvous at 0500 on February 4th, 5 miles north of Meyndertsdroogte Light. After assembling they were to start their run up Makassar Strait.\n\nHaving assembled according to plan, our force was zigzagging on an easterly course with a good trailing breeze and a moderate sea. The sky was partly overcast, but the mountains of Kangean Island could be seen rising out of the sea 35 miles to the north, and from time to time the high mountains of Bali and Lombok appeared through the clouds to the south. At 0935 Admiral Doorman warned his ships that 37 Japanese planes had been reported on their way toward Soerabaja on a southwest course. At this time our cruisers were in column 700 or 800 yards apart, with De Ruyter at the head, followed by Houston, Marblehead, and Tromp in order. The American destroyers were disposed as an antisubmarine and sound screen, while the three Netherlands de-\n\n_____________\n\n15 This action is variously described as \"Action North of Lombok Strait\" and \"Battle of Flores Sea.\"\n\n--27--\n\nstroyers formed an antisubmarine guard astern. Our ships were at latitude 7°28' S., longitude 115°37' E., when at 0949 enemy bombing planes were first sighted. There appeared to be about 37 planes in groups of about 9.\n\nAs our ships scattered, the plane groups separated to choose their targets. Their attack, which was to last all forenoon, was directed at the cruisers. Apparently the destroyers were not molested. The Houston successfully evaded all except the last bomb dropped at her. She had just maneuvered to avoid the attack of a group of planes when a single straggler came over. Its bomb, falling at a considerable angle, struck the leg of the mainmast and exploded on the main deck near the after turret. Fragments penetrated the barbette and turret and ignited the powder. The hit killed 48 men, wounded 20 more, and started an extremely serious fire. The after turret was so badly damaged that it was useless for the remainder of the campaign.\n\nThe Marblehead (which has turned in the most complete account of the action) fared no better. When the enemy planes were first sighted she manned all her antiaircraft batteries, while in the engine room all boilers were lighted off in preparation for full speed. At 0954 nine planes at about 17,000 feet approached the Marblehead. Their V-formation was so shallow that they were almost in line as they entered a power glide down to about 14,000 feet for a bombing approach. As they came in it could be seen that they were twin-engine, twin-tail, with a high-wing dihedral somewhat resembling the German JU86K. (The resemblance of the Japanese bombers to Junkers had been remarked at the time of the destruction of Cavite Navy Yard.) Our antiaircraft batteries opened fire and the ship maneuvered to keep them bearing. When the planes reached their bomb-release point the ship turned sharply. The planes did not release but passed and circled to gain altitude for a second approach.\n\nDuring the next few minutes the planes made several runs. The Marblehead ran at full speed, heeling far over as she maneuvered. On one of the runs our pointers got the range and one of the planes began to smoke. At 1018 a flight approached from starboard-apparently the same that had made the first attack. Our gunners hit one. Its bomb load exploded and the plane disintegrated in the air. The others dropped their bombs, but the ship was swinging with right full rudder and a stick of seven fell 50-100 yards away on the port bow. That was close enough, for the shrapnel sprayed the ship so that the men below decks\n\n--28--\n\nTop: Damage to hull of Marble head, port side forward, the result of a near hit in Madoera Strait. Bottom: Fantail of Marblehead after bomb hit in Madoera Strait action.\n\ndescribed the sound as \"like gravel thrown against the ship\" or \"like the ship's scraping over a gravel shoal.\" A minute later another plane, apparently damaged by our fire, was seen spiraling downward on the starboard bow in an effort to crash into the ship. Our 50-caliber machine guns opened fire on it; the tracers could be seen tearing through it and it broke into fragments as it struck the water 1,000 yards off the port bow.\n\nIt was too much to hope to go on dodging bombs indefinitely. This flight was immediately followed by a new one of seven planes of a different type. These single-engine planes were seen approaching at 1026. The ship turned with left full rudder but the evasion did not work. A stick of seven bombs straddled the ship perfectly for two direct hits and a very near hit which was almost as damaging.\n\nOne hit was in the forward section (frame 47) about 10 feet from the starboard side. It sheared the inboard side of the starboard motor launch, which probably started its fuse mechanism, so that after passing through the upper deck it exploded as it entered the main deck. The upward force of the explosion bowed the upper deck about a foot, starting seams and rivets. Laterally the blast spread destruction far and wide through that section of the ship (the wardroom and officers' country), and bent the forward uptakes. The downward force of the blast demolished the sick bay and fragments penetrated the top of the fuel tank below the sick bay. All electric, steam, and water lines (except the fire main) in the area were ruptured; but the sides of the ship were not penetrated. Fires were started throughout the area.\n\nThe second bomb hit on the fantail, abaft the after twin mount and close to port. It passed through the main deck and exploded in the hand-steering room. The explosion lifted the main deck and blew a flap of it upward against the under side of the guns of the twin mount, which was put completely out of action. This, however, permitted some of the force of the explosion to escape aft and probably reduced the damage which might otherwise have resulted. The chief petty officers' quarters and the adjacent crew's quarters were demolished. All steering gear and the hand-steering room were utterly disabled, and the rudder was jammed full left. Fuel tanks were ruptured and fires started. There were several ruptures in the sides of the vessel.\n\nThe near hit exploded below the turn of the bilge, on the port side at frame 24, tearing a hole about 3 by 9 feet in the bottom. The deck was driven up 10 inches over a length of about 8 feet, but did not break.\n\n--29--\n\nTop: The Island of Bali. Bottom: Oil tanks at Palembang, Sumatra.\n\nThe \"dished in area\" formed a great scoop which forced water into the ship at high pressure as she continued steaming. Moreover, the opening of seams and rivets started leaks in other forward sections, so that the peak tank was flooded as were most of the compartments below the first platform deck and forward of frame 34.\n\nThe shock of the explosion gave the ship a sharp list to starboard, and she settled by the head, so that her draft forward ultimately reached 30 feet. Fortunately the main engines were not damaged, and after firerooms 1 and 2 had been secured because of ruptured uptakes she was still able to do 25 knots. Because of the jammed rudder the ship was steaming in a circle to port.\n\nThis was as good a defense against air attack as was available at the moment. Not long after the hits more planes appeared on the starboard bow, but disappeared without attacking. A few minutes later two flights appeared on the port bow. Our gunners opened fire with all they had, but the forward director was wrecked, the fire control circuit was broken, and only voice telephones were working. The planes passed but soon circled back. A little later our men could see geysers springing up close to the De Ruyter. Subsequently the De Ruyter reported that she had been straddled on two occasions by near hits which put her antiaircraft fire control out of action. Again planes approached the Marblehead, but they broke off their attack too soon and their bombs fell 2,000 yards away. Shortly afterwards a reconnaissance plane circled the ship at 3,000 feet.\n\nSeveral times Tromp approached Marblehead to take off survivors if it should become necessary, as it seemed it well might. Fires were raging fore and aft. Damage-control crews and all unengaged men were busy fighting them or caring for the wounded. The executive officer had come to the bridge severely burned and his place had been taken by the gunnery officer. The damage-control officer supervised the fire fighting and efforts to free the rudder. By 1100 the fires were under control, but arcs from broken electric cables constantly started new ones in the oil-filled compartments. It was not till 1300 that the rudder angle was reduced to about 9° left.\n\nThere were 70 or 80 casualties, several fatal and many serious, in addition to many minor injuries which did not take men out of action. The forward battle dressing station and collecting station had been destroyed and the amidship station was untenable, so that the wounded had to be\n\n--30--\n\ncarried aft to a makeshift station in the torpedo workshop. This was no easy task on slanting decks made slippery with oil.\n\nSome time after noon the Japanese planes left. The Marblehead, steering with her engines, began working south toward Lombok Strait. Submersible pumps were in action and in addition bucket brigades were formed to remove water from the CPO quarters and the sick bay area forward. Work was impeded by some 20 tons of water loose on the main deck, chiefly from within the ship.\n\nAt 1255 Admiral Doorman ordered his ships westward and the Marblehead changed course to comply. Edwards and Stewart formed an anti-submarine screen for her. At 1415 Admiral Doorman gave permission for the Marblehead to proceed via Lombok Strait to Tjilatjap for repairs, and she again turned south, escorted by Destroyer Division 58. Her speed was about 20 knots, which was high for a ship in her condition; but it seemed advisable to get as far to the south as possible and to get well into Lombok Strait before dark, especially as a strange plane was sighted in the evening, apparently shadowing our ships. The De Ruyter and the three Netherlands destroyers accompanied the American ships until midnight, when the strait was cleared. All through the night the bucket brigade kept at work and the water was controlled, although at the time 26 watertight compartments were completely, and 8 more were partially flooded. It seemed that the ship was kept afloat as much by the determination of her captain and crew as by her own buoyancy.\n\nThrough the forenoon of the 5th a plane shadowed our ships, so that they held to a southerly course till noon in order to conceal their destination. They approached Tjilatjap in the early morning of the 6th, and soon after noon the Marblehead was berthed alongside the Houston.\n\nThe commercial floating drydock at Tjilatjap was large enough to raise only one end of the Marblehead at a time, and this proved a delicate and difficult task. The bow was raised sufficiently to patch the hole in her bottom, but the ship could not be entirely emptied of water or made completely watertight. The stern could not be lifted clear, so that the rudder could not be repaired, but a wooden deck was built over the fantail, the ship was cleared of debris and was made habitable.\n\nWork was pushed day and night, for it was realized that the Japanese might raid Tjilatjap at any time. When the leaks had been patched so that the submersible pumps could cope with the water the ship put to sea.\n\n--31--\n\nThis was February 13th. She was scarcely seaworthy, but it was thought that she would be safer at sea than in Tjilatjap. The story of her return home does not lie within the scope of this narrative, but it is one of the great stories of the sea. In the 48 days which followed the action the ship steamed more than 9,000 miles, touching Trincomalee (Ceylon), Durban, Port Elizabeth, and Simonstown (South Africa). Almost half this distance was covered without a rudder and the remainder of the voyage was made with the rudder controlled from the steering engine room.\n\nThe Houston, although her after turret was demolished, was otherwise seaworthy and was still the most powerful ship available in the area. It was hoped that she could be sent home for repairs when the Phoenix arrived, but meanwhile she was sent to escort troops from Darwin to Koepang (Timor) to aid in defending the airfield there. This field was of some importance not only because it partially covered the approach to Darwin, but because it could be used as a stop for our fighter-plane ferry. We had been flying P-40's from Darwin to Java via Timor, but the flight was too near the limit of their range. So many were lost that General Brereton finally had to halt the use of this route. It was this that made the Langley's voyage important.\n\nWhile the American cruisers stopped at Tjilatjap, Admiral Doorman with his remaining ships continued westward and eventually arrived at Batavia via Soenda Strait. While our striking force was in the west, an enemy convoy was south of Celebes for a day (February 7th-8th). Our planes scouted it, but our ships were not within striking distance. As soon as Admiral Doorman's retirement was known to ABDAFLOAT he was ordered to send his ships back to eastern Java, while the Admiral himself came to Tjilatjap for a conference with Admiral Hart.\n\nTHE BANKA ISLAND ATTEMPT16\n\nFEBRUARY 13-14\n\nDuring this conference it was learned that a Japanese expedition was coming from the Molucca Sea around the southeast corner of Celebes near Bouton Island. Its destination was not clear, but Admiral Hart believed it might be heading for Bandjermasin, chief city of southeast Borneo, or even eastern Java. He saw that if the enemy attempted either of these moves we must make at least a night attack, and Admiral\n\n____________\n\n16 Also described as the Gaspar Strait action.\n\n--32--\n\nDoorman was ordered to make plans and get his fleet in readiness. The plan was to assemble southwest of Bali, and our ships began to leave port at once. But the enemy expedition moved only around the south of Celebes to take Makassar on the southwest coast, and there was no opportunity to strike.\n\nAs a matter of fact, we were faced with a dilemma. The Japanese were now closing in on Java from both sides and we had scarcely the strength to stop either arm of the envelopment. In Burma the Japs took Martaban on the 11th, thus turning the flank of the Salween line and forcing the British to withdraw to the Bilin River, which offered a much less favorable line of defense. The Japanese were already on Singapore Island, and there were indications that they would not wait for its fall before moving on Sumatra or attacking Java from the northwest. On February 5th a large force was sighted in the Anambas Islands northeast of Singapore, and on the 7th a convoy was reported near Banka Island, east of southern Sumatra.\n\nWhile this danger appeared in the west, the situation on the east was no less threatening. The Japanese now controlled southern Celebes. They were known to have built up an important base at Kendari and to have considerable air power based there. From that region they could attack Bali, Madoera or eastern Java directly.\n\nIn which direction should we turn our striking force? Where was the enemy likely to move first? Bad weather or enemy air opposition interfered with our reconnaissance at this critical juncture and so delayed this important decision. Meanwhile the Japanese were making good use of their positions, bombing Port Moresby, Koepang, and other cities. Soerabaja was bombed repeatedly, and Batavia received its initiation in aerial bombing on the 9th.\n\nAs it turned out, the Japanese advanced about simultaneously in east and west. On the 11th they converged on Bandjermasin and 2 days later claimed to have taken it. On the 14th, the day before Singapore surrendered but when its fate was already sealed, they opened their attack on Palembang in southeast Sumatra. This region was a valuable prize indeed, as it produced more than half the oil of the Indies. The Dutch repulsed the first attack by paratroops, but the following day, while Singapore was falling in the north, the Japanese brought in their infantry, seemingly from the convoy which had been waiting in the Anambas Islands. The Dutch were overwhelmed and could only fire their wells\n\n--33--\n\nand tanks before the area passed to the enemy. At the same time it was learned that another enemy convoy was on the move from Balikpapan.\n\nOn the 13th, as soon as the enemy's intentions became clear, Admiral Doorman's little striking force jumped off to meet the threat to Palembang.\n\nAlthough he did not have the American cruisers, De Ruyter and Tromp had been reinforced by the British heavy cruiser Exeter and the Australian light cruiser Hobart There were six American 17 and several British destroyers, in addition to the Dutch. That gave him a total of four good cruisers with adequate destroyer support, and he was told that \"he should consider the advisability of an attack upon enemy expeditions by day as well as by night in view of the considerably increased power of his force.\"\n\nOn the way northwest the Dutch destroyer Van Ghent ran aground and was lost. Banckert remained behind to take off her crew, but the rest of the force reached the area northeast of Banka Island on the night of February 13th-14th. It was 24 hours too late. The Japanese were already in Banka Strait and were advancing up the river. On the 14th our ships were bombed repeatedly. They escaped any serious damage, although the Hobart was straddled and two of our destroyers, Barker and Bulmer, were somewhat shaken up by near hits. Admiral Doorman did not dare rush the straits, particularly with the enemy in complete control of the air. Bright moonlight precluded any surprise by night, and there seemed no point in remaining to be bombed again by day. Consequently he retired to Batavia on the morning of the 15th without having accomplished anything.\n\nANOTHER MOVE TO THE SOUTH\n\nOn February 14th Admiral Hart surrendered Operational Command of Allied Naval Forces in the Southwest Pacific to Vice Admiral Helfrich, and shortly afterwards returned to the United States. Admiral Helfrich was succeeded as CZM (Dutch Naval Commander) by Rear Admiral van Staveren. The Chief of Staff of the Allied Naval Command, Admiral Palliser, was British, so that the United States was left with little representation on the High Command. Our senior naval officer in the area was Admiral Glassford, who had been since the end of\n\n_____________\n\n17 There is no official report, but it appears that the American destroyers participating in this action were Stewart, Barker, Bulmer, Pillsbury, Parrott, and John D. Edwards.\n\n--34--\n\nJanuary Commander of United States Naval Forces in the Southwest Pacific, a position which he continued to hold under Admiral Helfrich as ABDAFLOAT until the first of March, when the Allied Command was dissolved.\n\nThe situation which now confronted Admiral Helfrich was desperate. The Japanese in Sumatra would soon be in a position to advance on Soenda Strait, perhaps close it and invade Java from the west. The Japanese in Borneo and Celebes were ready to advance on Bali or Soembawa or even eastern Java and close the eastern straits. The danger of finding our ships trapped in the Java Sea was already apparent. The need for keeping them there to meet the next Japanese advance toward Java was equally evident.\n\nUpon taking command of the American fleet, Admiral Glassford remained at Bandoeng, to which he moved his operational staff from Soerabaja. He left at the latter place only an Administrative Office under his Chief of Staff, Admiral Purnell. The Dutch Admiral, van Staveren, also moved from Batavia to Bandoeng, so that the Dutch and American commands were together and near General Wavell at Lembang.\n\nSoerabaja was being bombed daily, so that our ships could use it only when darkness grounded the Japanese planes. (Their fields were not equipped for night operations.) If the Japanese should occupy Bali, as it appeared they might, the port would become utterly untenable. Accordingly the American administrative office was shifted to Tjilatjap on February 19th and our smaller auxiliaries soon followed. This amounted to the practical abandonment of Soerabaja as a base. Only our submarines and our reconnaissance aircraft continued to operate from there, the former submerging during the daily air attacks and the latter being well dispersed and instantly moved. It was with great reluctance that our forces left Soerabaja. Its fuel supplies were ample, its repair facilities good, and its recreational opportunities of considerable value to our men.\n\nIt was clearly realized that even Tjilatjap could be only a temporary stopping place. Its remoteness from Japanese air bases in Borneo and Celebes gave it a comparative security for the moment, but the Japanese advance in Sumatra already imperiled it and their establishment in Bali would make it unusable. Admiral Glassford expressed surprise that the Japs did not bomb the ships concentrated in Tjilatjap before we left it, and attributed it to a kind Providence. But the next base on our line of\n\n--35--\n\nretreat would have to be far away, so that we kept our ships at Tjilatjap until the enemy actually landed on Java. Port Darwin was the closest available base, but it had already been found unsatisfactory. Neither was it secure, as it was soon to be amply demonstrated.\n\nAccordingly it was decided to prepare for our leaving Java by sending our auxiliaries south. Too little was known of the harbors of western Australia and adequate charts were not available, but Exmouth Gulf was chosen as the nearest point out of range of enemy shore-based planes and yet close enough for our forces to strike at the enemy. The Holland, accompanied by two submarines in need of overhaul left Tjilatjap on the 19th. The Black Hawk left the following day with the destroyers Bulmer and Barker, which had been badly shaken up by bombing near Banka Island.\n\nThe tanker Pecos was held till the 25th in an attempt to remove some of the oil from Tjilatjap, but the Dutch could not bring themselves to believe that Java could be lost and consequently were unwilling to remove oil from either Soerabaja or Tjilatjap until it was too late. The fuel situation was becoming acute. The Erling Brovig, under charter to our Navy, had been sent to Ceylon for fuel, and the Trinity had sailed for Persia on the same errand. The George D. Henry had been filled at Darwin and was waiting at Fremantle for orders.\n\nJAPANESE AIR ATTACK ON DARWIN\n\nFEBRUARY 19\n\nShortly after midnight on February 15th, a fast troop convoy had left Darwin. Aboard the Mauna Loa and the Meigs were Australian troops while the Tulagi and the Portmar carried a U. S. infantry regiment. Their purpose was to reinforce the garrison at Koepang, in Timor, and to establish a base there. As escorts, Admiral Glassford had provided the Houston and the Peary. About noon on the 15th, two heavy four-engined Japanese seaplanes were sighted. The Houston fired unsuccessfully, and the planes circled at a high altitude for about an hour before departing for the north. Though one report states that two bombs were dropped at this time, it seems likely that this was a reconnaissance flight only. After the planes had left, the convoy reformed and continued on its way.\n\nOn the 16th the convoy was severely bombed. The attacking planes were described as carrier-based, though they are elsewhere described as\n\n--36--\n\nheavy bombers. Flying at a high altitude in three horizontal rows of nine planes each, they approached from the east. The first wave concentrated on the Houston, and each plane dropped one bomb. The Japanese scored no hits, and likewise the Houston's fire had no visible effects. Out of the second wave, however, she shot down 7 of the 44 enemy planes, and her recently provided antiaircraft equipment proved of great value in protecting the convoy. This second attack used a formation similar to the first, but the planes came from the southwest-an unexpected quarter. By this time the convoy had scattered, and each vessel sought protection by radical maneuvering and high speed. The planes attacked in groups of 9, the first one heading for the Houston and each successive one concentrating on a transport. The Mauna Loa received a glancing blow, and all 4 transports started leaks from near hits. The number of bombs dropped may be gauged by the Portmar's report that 23 bombs had landed within 200 feet, although the Meigs had been able to lay down a smoke screen for her.\n\nThough the enemy's attack had failed, the position of the convoy was obviously precarious. The presence of a Japanese carrier was likely, and Japanese warships were rumored to be lying in wait near Timor. The ships reassembled, however, and continued on their northward course for several hours. A scouting plane from the Houston was launched in an effort to gain information of the enemy's position. Soon afterwards directions were received to return again to Darwin, and by the morning of the 18th the convoy had safely reached the port.\n\nLimited facilities caused the Portmar and the Tulagi to anchor in the harbor, while the Meigs and the Mauna Loa proceeded to the dock so the troops aboard might disembark. The Houston and Peary refueled at once and by the evening of the 18th had headed out to the west. They had been ordered to join Admiral Doorman's striking force, which was preparing to defend Bali from invasion. A prolonged attack on an enemy submarine outside of Darwin delayed the Peary, however, and she was directed to return to port for refueling while the Houston proceeded independently. For this reason the destroyer was at Darwin during the attack on the 19th.\n\nThe airport, warehouses, docks, and virtually every ship in Darwin Harbor was destroyed by severe air attack on the 19th. A total of about 72 high-level bombers and 18 dive bombers were used, and the almost complete lack of defenses resulted in much damage. The city itself was\n\n--37--\n\nstrafed and set aflame, and so severe was the destruction that the evacuation of the entire area was ordered by nightfall.\n\nAt 0955 18 heavy bombers appeared, flying in horizontal rows of 4, with 2 planes bringing up the rear. Their size indicates that they were based on carriers or seaplane tenders. No warning of their approach was given though they came from the south; proper identification was presumably not made because once again the attack came from an unexpected quarter. The docks were the first targets. By this time the Meigs and the Mauna Loa had unloaded the troops and were anchored in the harbor, with their equipment and ammunition still aboard. The British ships, Zealandia and Neptuna were at the dock, however, discharging ammunition and both these vessels were hit. Shattering explosions and brilliant flashes shook the area as the Neptuna blew up and turned on its side. Hits scored on a Norwegian tanker, the Benjamin Franklin, and another vessel caused loud and extensive detonations. Hits on the docks themselves started fires and scattered debris over a wide area. Though all the bombing was done at a high level it was accurate. Meeting practically no defense, the planes could afford to take their time, and while the dive bombers were attacking, the big bombers would circle around without even dropping bombs.\n\nThe airport was next subjected to a severe bombing attack by a second wave of high level bombers. Two-perhaps four-of our planes were able to take off and a P-40 shot down a dive bomber before succumbing to the hopeless odds. A survivor from the Mauna Loa described the destruction at the airport as \"like the battle fields of France; hangars, planes, and everything blown to bits, burnt holes all over the field.\" For over 24 hours fires burned from gas tanks and ammunition dumps.\n\nImmediately following the second wave of high level bombers came the dive bombers, painted a dull green in contrast to the bigger planes which were reported as \"shining like silver, with a red sun and a burst of red and gold stripes.\" The single-engined dive bombers swung in on their individual targets at low angles of not more than 50°. By this time many vessels were heading for the harbor entrance, some dragging anchor in their haste to escape. The British Motorist, a tanker which had backed away from the dock during the first attack, had now managed to back into the harbor, but she got no farther. The Japanese planes first concentrated on the transports and naval vessels, then attacked each mer-\n\n--38--\n\nchantman in turn. For over 2 hours harbor shipping and shore facilities endured almost continuous attacks.\n\nThe destroyer Peary was hit five times by Japanese dive bombers. While trying to put a smoke screen around the Australian hospital ship Manunda, she was hit on the fantail, removing the depth charge racks, propeller guards, and flooding the steering motor room. An incendiary bomb landed near the galley, while the third went through the fire room without exploding. The fourth bomb set off the forward ammunition magazines, while the last an incendiary, exploded in the after engine room. Though the ship was damaged severely, her machine guns continued to blaze until the last enemy plane had departed. She sank stern first at about 1300, with a loss of all but 52 men of her crew. One officer survived. The Manunda, which the Peary had been protecting, was also hit by a bomb which failed to explode, and was strafed several times.\n\nThe transports were a"
