        "text": "10 Questions is an ongoing blog series in which Tableau Zen Master Dan Murray interviews some of the brightest folks in the world of data.\n\nThe Tableau community is diverse drawing people from many industries and lifestyles. Keith is one of the most adventurous people I’ve me in the last few years. He’s a regular at Burning Man and has lived in Europe and South America. Keith’s a free spirit that isn’t encumbered by convention. He also and runs a great blog called Red Headed Step Data.\n\nThe Questions\n\nQ: You are a bit of a world traveler. Can you talk a bit about that?\n\nHelfrich: Thank you, Dan, for having me on the show! Travel and adventure are two of my favorites. I’ve traveled to something like 50 countries. While that may sound like a lot, it’s still less than a third of the planet. So, I’ve been thinking recently that it’s time to pick up the pace a little. My recent trips were a sailing vacation around Cuba in November and a scuba trip to Belize over Christmas and New Years.\n\nAs an approach, I prefer to live in faraway places. I lived for three years in Germany (before, during and after the Berlin Wall came down). My first job out of university was with a Dutch consulting firm, which moved me to live in Amsterdam. And now, I’m two years here in San Francisco after seven years in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Asia will be my home at some point. In the end, I suppose I seek to have lived a great life, a little bit of everywhere.\n\nDiscover More Interviews\n\nWant to read more insightful interviews like this one?
