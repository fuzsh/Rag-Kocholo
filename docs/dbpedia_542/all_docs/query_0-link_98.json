        "text": "CAMP MEEKER ― More than 350 acres of mixed redwood forest that locals have long regarded as part of their own backyard is about to become a public park under a $2.23 million deal funded by the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation & Open Space District.\n\nCrisscrossed by old logging roads and trails that climb above Camp Meeker, the property has been a part of the historic St. Dorothy’s Rest camp and retreat center for 12 years. While technically off limits to the public, many locals hike there regularly anyway.\n\nNow, subject to approval by the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors as early as Aug. 20, it will become a public forest, protected from development, safeguarded for recreational use and open to all.\n\nThe deal also allows St. Dorothy’s Rest to recharge its coffers and support California’s oldest camp, known for hosting seriously ill children with cancer or organ transplants.\n\nIt also enhances opportunities for improved forest health, fuel management and firebreaks to protect the surrounding community of around 425 people from wildfire.\n\n“It’s a wonderful place,” St. Dorothy’s Rest board member Dewey Watson said during a tour of part of the forest. “I’m glad it’s going to be preserved forever.“\n\nOnce the realm of local lumber baron Melvin Cyrus Meeker, the property will be owned by the Camp Meeker Recreation & Park District once the deal is sealed.\n\n“We’ll suddenly become the biggest landowner in this area,” said Gary Helfrich, president of the five-member board, which until now, had been concerned largely with the operation of the local water system.\n\nWhile expected primarily to serve local residents ― whose enthusiasm for the new park has been evident during recent park district board meetings, according to Vice President John McDaniel ― the park also offers a new destination for others in the mood for a challenging hike.\n\n“I think it’s very exciting,” McDaniel said. “It’s a beautiful property, and it’s an opportunity to get the land under a conservation easement and a recreational easement so it’s preserved and it’s open to the public.”\n\nThere’s a trick to getting on the property, however. Most visitors will have to park just off Bohemian Highway near the Camp Meeker fire station and post office, then walk through the community’s narrow, tree-shrouded streets to reach the forest farther uphill, adding about a half-mile to whatever additional hiking they plan to do.\n\nThere also are no restrooms or water, and no signage on the forested land yet, so visitors will have to know the area or pay close attention to their route.\n\nBut plans include trail signs, some trail restoration and fuel reduction, though “that’s kind of it,” Helfrich said.\n\n“This is for passive recreation,” he said. “It’s a beautiful forest, and we just want the people to walk through and enjoy it.”\n\nThe forest still has many huge, old stumps left behind from its history as timberland logged to help feed Meeker’s mills, including large “goose pen” cavities resulting from old wildfires. There’s also impressive second- and third-growth redwoods throughout. The land also features Douglas fir and other conifers, bay trees, tanoaks―though many are diseased and subject to removal―ferns, sorrel and trillium growing on ridge tops and in steep ravines.\n\nIt also includes a 1.8-mile stretch of Dutch Bill Creek, which hosts steelhead and coho salmon and is considered critical to coho restoration efforts, Open Space District spokeswoman Lauren Alpert said.\n\nThere are several seasonal creeks and waterfalls, as well.\n\nA spring-fed reservoir in the western part of the forest that once provided the community’s water holds about 9 acre-feet, or nearly 3 million gallons, in a regular, wet winter, Watson said.\n\nOne can still find the remnants of the Living Tower, an attraction made from four redwood trees that once supported seven square, wooden platforms visible atop a flat, clear-cut ridge. It’s now surrounded by other trees, so it takes guidance to find it.\n\nFor Watson, that same ridge top now represents a potential firebreak. A team of prescribed burners already has looked at it with him and McDaniel, he said.\n\n“There’s a lot of interest out there,” McDaniel said, “both in fire prevention and cleaning up the forest.”\n\nSt. Dorothy’s Rest, a subsidiary of the Episcopal Diocese of California, was established in 1901, inspired by a couple who lost their 8-year-old daughter to meningitis and who wanted to create a space in nature for healing.\n\nIt maintains an old wooden chapel and several dormitory houses and other structures at the top of Camp Meeker, among the redwoods.\n\nIn 2012, it acquired the additional forest property, buying it out of bankruptcy from the Chenowyth family, which had owned it since the middle of the last century. The purchase was made in part through a loan from the diocese, Watson said.\n\nIt included the large forest, as well as several dozen small, irregular pieces of land that had been deeded off during Meeker’s ownership, before such things were regulated, for use as campsites among lots that later included homes.\n\nIt soon became apparent that St. Dot’s, as it’s affectionately known, could not provide the maintenance needed in the forest, as well as the smaller properties, many of which had trees that needed to come down, Watson said. The interest on its loan, land maintenance and other expenses soon depleted the nonprofit’s savings, leaving the agency searching for a public entity to take possession of the property so St. Dorothy’s could focus on camps and retreats.\n\nThe alternative was selling it for development of several homes, Watson said.\n\nThere were dead ends, but Watson and St. Dorothy’s ultimately started working with the Ag & Open Space District on a deal through which the tax-funded county agency will put a conservation easement and recreation covenant over 356 acres of the land, which will be transferred to Camp Meeker Recreation & Parks.\n\nThe remaining properties are essentially being donated to the recreation and parks district.\n\nHelfrich and McDaniel said significant work lies ahead in planning for forest management and fire prevention, assessing trails and applying for grants to assist in the work.\n\n“I would really stress that the district’s vision is to restore, maintain and make the property accessible to the public,” McDaniel said. “You know it was really to prevent development because it’s a unique and very diverse forest.”\n\nYou can reach Staff Writer Mary Callahan (she/her) at 707-521-5249 or mary.callahan@pressdemocrat.com.
