        "text": "CRESTON — On Saturday, Aug. 3, the Rochelle Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) dedicated a commemorative bench at the Creston Opera House honoring the upcoming 250th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nThe event featured remarks by Rochelle Chapter Regent Debby Katzman and DAR State Regent Christina Bannon, the Pledge of Allegiance led by Ben Hayes of Boy Scout Troop 64, the National Anthem by retired U.S. Army Sgt. Peter DeWispelaere, a prayer and benediction by Chaplain Judy Schermerhorn, and presentation of Quilts of Valor to four local veterans.\n\n\"The members of the Rochelle DAR thank you all for joining us for this celebration,\" Katzman said. \"We believe in the courage, sacrifice and passion of our forefathers. We believe in their noble work and unselfish service.\"\n\nThe 250th anniversary will take place on July 4, 2026. The U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission, commonly known as the America 250 Commission, was established by Congress in 2016. This 10-year national effort was formed “to kick off a multi-year effort to pause and reflect on our nation’s past, to honor the contributions of all Americans, to look ahead toward our future, and to engage the public in building the largest, most inclusive commemoration in American history.” The America 250 Commission has reached out to museums and libraries, not-for-profit and patriotic organizations, schools and youth organizations, cities and towns, state and local governments, and community organizations and businesses, ensuring that every American can be part of the historic event.\n\nThe National Society, Daughters of the American Revolution (NSDAR), has partnered with the America 250 Commission to bring this celebration to the local level through the individual chapters of the society. In keeping with the National Society’s mission of Historic Preservation, Education, and Patriotism, each chapter is encouraged to involve their community in activities highlighting the nation’s birthday.\n\nThis bench, made of recycled bottle caps, was obtained through the Rochelle Golden K, whose programs support community youth. The setting in front of the 149-year-old historic Creston Opera House also honors the historic preservation of the building, which was spearheaded by the Creston Booster Club and completed in 2018.\n\n\"The bottle caps were collected by members along with the entire community,\" Katzman said. \"That's keeping a great deal of plastic from being deposited into landfills. You can see why this bench has been a win-win-win. It's an effort for our local children to see support from, environmental efforts, and our focus on the 250th anniversary. When you see this bench, please take a moment to ponder just how blessed we are as Americans to have the freedom we enjoy.\"\n\nKatzman thanked members of the DAR chapter for their work on the event and recognized local officials, veterans and members of the community for attending and playing a part in the bench dedication.\n\nThe Princeton Chapter of Quilts of Valor presented quilts to four local veterans including Robert Garland (U.S. Army, Vietnam War), Daniel Graber (U.S. Army, Vietnam War), Arch Millotte (U.S. Air Force, Korean War), and John Gruben (U.S. Army, Vietnam War).\n\n\"I would like to recognize all of our veterans in attendance today,\" Katzman said. \"You have our deepest and heartfelt appreciation. Thank you for your service to our country.\""
