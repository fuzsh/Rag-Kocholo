        "text": "Former Oregon head coach Mark Helfrich is making his return to college football. Helfrich will be joining the FOX Sports broadcast team as a college football game analyst, per FOX Sports’ announcement on Thursday.\n\nHelfrich returns to FOX Sports after having served in the same role for the network back in 2017, which followed his tenure at Oregon. The former head coach will be paired with play-by-play announcer Joe Davis for Eastern Kentucky at West Virginia on Saturday at 12:00 p.m. ET on FS1.\n\nAs the head coach at Oregon from 2013-2016, Helfrich led the Ducks to a PAC-12 Championship in 2014, as well as finished runner up in the College Football Playoff, losing to an Urban Meyer-led Ohio State Buckeyes team in the National Championship game. He compiled a 37-16 overall record, going 11-2 and then 13-2 in his first two seasons.\n\nHelfrich dropped off in his third year at Oregon, going 9-4 but ending the seasons with a disastrous collapse in the Alamo Bowl against TCU. In his final season, he went 4-8, including major losses to both rivals Washington and Oregon State, which cemented his firing.\n\nOregon reached a deal in May of 2017 to limit the $11.6 million buyout owed to the former head coach. According to documents obtained by DuckTerritory in 2018, Oregon agreed to pay Helfrich $8.1 million lump sum in May of 2017. In return, if Helfrich's aggregate compensation exceeds $1.7 million before 2020, Helfrich will owe 50-percent of post-termination compensation in excess of $1.7 million back to the university.\n\nBefore his time as head coach, Helfrich served as the Ducks offensive coordinator under Chip Kelly from 2009-2012. During Helfrich’s four seasons as Oregon’s offensive coordinator, the offense ranked highly nationally in several offensive categories and became well known for their extremely fast-paced offense built around speed. He was promoted to the head coaching position in 2013 when Kelly left Oregon to become the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nAfter his time at Oregon, Helfrich was hired by the Chicago Bears to serve as offensive coordinator. He spent just one season with the team, and although he was not the play-caller, the Bears finished the 2019 campaign with an 8-8 record and the No. 29-ranked offense. Helfrich was fired by the Bears two days after the season ended.\n\nPrior to Oregon, Helfrich served as the offensive coordinator at Colorado from 2006-2008. Before that, he was the passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Arizona State from 2001-2005, and before then he served as the quarterbacks coach at Boise State from 1998-2000."
