        "text": "The University of Oregon did what it had to do on Tuesday in firing football coach Mark Helfrich. The Ducks trajectory was poor. The program had long ago lost its identity. It's a tough gig, head football coach, and Oregon made a tough decision.\n\nSo now what?\n\nThat's the question to ask in Eugene. Athletic director Rob Mullens confirmed that he's lined up Parker Executive Search Firm. He indicated that all options are on the table. But I don't believe for a second that Oregon doesn't already know who it wants to hire. And I'm wondering whether Phil Knight's whereabouts last Saturday will play a role in that.\n\nWhile Oregon and Oregon State were kicking off in a Civil War that would expose the Ducks defense as gentle unit, Knight was in Columbus, 2,064 aerial miles away, giving a victory speech in the Ohio State locker room.\n\n\"Of the Top 25 NCAA teams, Nike supplies 20 of them and none of those teams are we more proud of than the one in this dressing room,\" said Knight. \"Congratulations. You were fabulous.\"\n\nKnight looked joyful and engaged. He was in the presence of a winning program that made him proud. But it was who was in the room, particularly taking a knee to Knight's left, near the smiling Meyer, that caught my attention. That would be Buckeyes defensive coordinator Greg Schiano. Because regardless of how and why Knight ended up in that locker room, it's Schiano who has emerged as a strong candidate in this search.\n\nSchiano would be a course correction for Oregon. His defense wouldn't be generous. He has experience coaching in the NFL and in major college football. He won 11 games once at Rutgers, and according to a source involved in the hiring process at Oregon, \"According to his peer groups, he's one of the best.\"\n\nOregon will want to talk with a lot of coaches. Western Michigan's PJ Fleck may be among them. So may Boise State's Bryan Harsin. A college source familiar with Fleck told me Tuesday, \"I think if PJ gets in front of Phil, he will get this job.\" But given that Meyer would be Knight's dream pairing with Oregon, the next best thing feels like Ohio State's right-hand man, Schiano.\n\nA Pac-12 coach speaking on the condition of anonymity said of the Schiano to Oregon possibility, \"It would be a whole new thing for him. A new setting, a new conference, new people around him. This conference is brutal. He'd need to buckle up, but Greg is a buckle-it-up kind of guy.\"\n\nSchiano would present a formidable foe for Washington's Chris Petersen and would give Oregon a tough-guy identity that matches what Oregon State has with Gary Andersen. I wonder, too, if Schiano's hiring at Oregon could flip a Huskies commit such as Elijah Molden (West Linn High) back to the Ducks. Molden's college decision, announced as Oregon was getting blown out by Stanford, stung former Ducks' athletic director and booster Pat Kilkenny.\n\nKilkenny, who lives in San Diego, developed a close relationship with Elijah's father, Alex, years ago. When Molden played defensive back for the Chargers he'd occasionally catch a ride to Eugene on Kilkenny's private plane.\n\n\"Alex Molden is a very, very special Duck and person,\" Kilkenny said earlier this month, \"and it is disappointing (to see Elijah headed to Washington)... but sometimes kids change their minds.\"\n\nThe adults changed their minds on Helfrich. Some 21 months after the Ducks coach received a $17.5 million contract extension, he finished 4-8 and was fired. It came as a shock only to those who were mired in old-fashioned thinking. Oregon hasn't been the kind of place where a head coach gets fired for a bad season, or even two seasons (See: Alamo Bowl and Utah's 62-point party). Assistants build homes and stay for decades in Eugene. But at long last, the operation recognized that the staff became so in-bred in its thinking that it got stale.\n\nSure, if Chip Kelly gets fired and wants to come back you hire him. Sure, if Fleck ever gets in front of Knight there's a shot he rows the boat all the way to Eugene. Sure, there may be other candidates (i.e. Josh McDaniels?) identified by the search. But I'm wondering if Oregon's final answer was under Knight's nose last Saturday.\n\nSchiano was on a knee, looking at Knight as he spoke. It was fitting, too, because all afternoon the Nike founder looked at Schiano's Buckeyes defense.\n\nI'm wondering if the Ducks are about to become Ohio State Northwest. Because down deep, all Knight ever wanted was to be proud of his Ducks."
