        "text": "This past Tuesday the Village of Oak Park, TERRA, Design Workshop, and a5 Branding & Digital hosted a public open house for the Oak Park Avenue Streetscape improvements where an update on the latest utility and streetscape designs were shared with the community. Members of the project team were present to address questions and concerns, review the initial construction logistics and schedule, as well as share their excitement for the upcoming work in the historic Hemingway District! Be sure to visit the project website for periodic updates and to learn more about the improvements! https://lnkd.in/g5prnr5H\n\nBeautiful day engaging with the Oak Park community at A Day in Our Village this past Sunday!

The project will provide a multi-use artificial turf field, jogging track, outdoor fitness equipment, and more. We cannot wait to see the final product in the next few months! TERRA has also been collaborating with The University of Chicago and Wight & Company on a series of presentations to educate the students on what went into the planning, design, and construction of the field at the Woodlawn Charter School. During the latest presentation, Senior Project Manager John Helfrich led an interactive discussion on stormwater management, collaborating with project team partners to introduce students to some of the sustainable approaches being implemented into the new athletic field.\n\nTERRA is Hiring! We are seeking an entry level Civil Design Engineer to join our Site Development department based in our Chicago Office. With a wide variety of projects, our Site team is perfect for an entry level engineer to be part of. We welcome ideal candidates to apply via our LinkedIn posting or directly on our website at www.terraengineering.com.\n\n“The new schoolyard at Coles School offers students a dynamic place to play, learn and grow while allowing the neighboring community to benefit from the green infrastructure elements that mitigate flooding and improve water quality,” said MWRD President Kari K. Steele. Edward Coles School sits on top a layer of sandy soils, which allows it to hold 568,534 gallons of stormwater per rain event. https://lnkd.in/gcxMfF6d\n\nLast week, TERRA had the pleasure of attending the ribbon cutting for the new schoolyard at Edward Cole's Language Academy. Our team collaborated with site design group, ltd. to design an artificial turf field, rain gardens, playground, and outdoor classroom that will provide a space for children to learn and play. Our engineers designed a stormwater management system that will retain over 550,000 gallons of runoff - the most of any Space to Grow playground to-date! #SpacetoGrow #ChicagoPublicSchools #MWRD #Openlands #HealthySchools #GreenInfrastructure"
