By July 1960, the MFRC had helped the lunch counter owners and student protesters come to an agreement which resulted in the integration of many of Charlotte's lunch counters. The work of the committee continued and expanded to explore broader community issues, and was renamed the Mayor's Community Relations Committee (MCRC) in 1961. This collection comprises papers related to the establishment and work of both committees, and includes correspondence, committee minutes, memorandums, pamphlets, and research materials on the subject of race relationships.\n\nSeries Description\n\nThis series includes letters to and from various committee members, civic leaders, and ministers from around North Carolina.\n\nCreator\n\nCunningham, John R.
