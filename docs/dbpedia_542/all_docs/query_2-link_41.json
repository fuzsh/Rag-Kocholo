The issue I am having is when I port the code to Xamarin Forms, for running on a Galaxy Watch. The app will run for a few seconds, but then it will crash. I believe it could be from assigning the Label text too often?\n\nI have an MQTT publisher device pumping out a simple position value at a 10ms interval. Where my other apps will just keep chugging along, the app in Xamarin will lock and then eventually crash. If it comment out the Label.Text assignment, the app keeps running without a crash.\n\nHere is my Xamarin code, is there a better way to handle the assignment?"
