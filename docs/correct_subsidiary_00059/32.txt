IBM announced the completion of its merger with Sequent Computer Systems. Sequent, based in Beaverton, Oregon is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of IBM.

As a result of the merger: IBM will market and sell Sequent's NUMA-Q 1000 and 2000 servers as the NUMA-Q brand under the IBM logo. IBM will enable its business partner network to market and sell Sequent's current products. IBM and Sequent development teams will accelerate their work on Project Monterey. Future IBM servers will incorporate NUMA (non-uniform memory access) technology.

Sequent is an acknowledged leader in systems based on NUMA architecture. NUMA is advanced hardware and software that allows large numbers of processors to operate as a single system while maintaining the ease of programming and manageability of a small system. Sequent's systems use up to 64 Intel microprocessors (with plans to use 256) for a wide variety of e-business related applications, including transaction processing, customer relationship management and business intelligence. Sequent also has innovative technology called NUMACenter that helps UNIX and NT interoperate on a single system.
