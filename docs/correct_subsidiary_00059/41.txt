History

Originally named Sequel, [ [http://www.netlib.org/papers/advarch Advanced Architecture Computers] and [http://www.netlib.org/papers/advarch-post Part Two] ,Argonne National Labs, Technical Report No. 57, Jack J. Dongarra and Iain S. Duff] Sequent formed in 1983 when a group of seventeen engineers and executives left Intel after the failed iAPX 432 "mainframe on a chip" project was cancelled; they were joined by one non-Intel employee. They started Sequent to develop a line of SMP computers, then considered one of the up-and-coming fields in computer design.Fact|date=July 2007 Several engineers from AT&T Bell Labs were hired, bringing systems hardware and programming expertise.Fact|date=July 2007

Balance

Sequent's first computer systems were the Balance 8000 and Balance 21000 released in 1984. The Balance 21000 included up to 20 8 MHz National Semiconductor NS32016 processors (in multiples of 2), each with a small cache connected to a common memory to form a shared memory system. The systems ran a modified version of BSD 4.2 Unix the company called DYNIX, for DYNamic unIX. The machines were designed to compete with the DEC VAX 11/780, with all of their inexpensive processors available to run any process. In addition the system included a series of libraries that could be used by programmers to develop applications that could use more than one processor at a time. The Balance systems were originally intended to be sold to OEMs as computing engines, but that market could not be developed. When the commercial market discovered their reliability and cost advantages, the company re-thought its marketing strategy. The Balance line sold well for three years to banks, the government, other commercial enterprises, and universities interested in parallel computing.

The amazing thing about the timing of the appearance of the Balance 8000, a bus-oriented multiprocessor, was that it came out at a time when most people were trying to drum up interest in acquiring personal workstations like SUNs and SGI Irises which were already competing against the VAX. The Balance offered no graphics, but it gave the first glimmer of what more tightly coupled CPUs could do before the advent of clusters or networks of workstations.

ymmetry

Their next series was the Intel 80386-based Symmetry, released in 1987. Various models supported between 2 and 30 processors, using a new copy-back cache and a wider 64-bit memory bus. 1991's Symmetry 2000 models added SCSI drives, and were offered in versions with from one to six Intel 80486 processors. The next year they added the VMEbus based Symmetry 2000/x50 with faster CPUs.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw big changes on the software side for Sequent. DYNIX was replaced by DYNIX/ptx, which was based on a merger of AT&T's version of UNIX and BSD 4.2. And this was during a period when Sequent's high-end systems became particularly successful due to a close working relationship with Oracle, specifically their high-end database servers. In 1993 they added the Symmetry 2000/x90 along with their ptx/Cluster software, which added various high availability features and introduced custom support for Oracle Parallel Server.

In 1994 Sequent introduced the Symmetry 5000 series models SE20, SE60 and SE90, which used 66 MHz Pentium CPUs in systems from 2 to 30 processors. The next year they expanded that with the SE30/70/100 lineup using 100 MHz Pentiums, and then in 1996 with the SE40/80/120 with 166 MHz Pentiums. With the addition of a VGA card and the Winserver NT software, the 5000 series could also run Windows NT.

NUMA

Recognizing the increase in competition for SMP systems after having been early adopters of the architecture, and the increasing integration of SMP technology into microprocessors, Sequent sought its next source of differentiation. They began investing in the development of a system based on a cache-coherent non-uniform memory architecture (ccNUMA) and leveraging Scalable Coherent Interconnect. NUMA distributes memory among the processors, avoiding the bottleneck that occurs with a single monolithic memory. Using NUMA would allow their multiprocessor machines to generally outperform SMP systems, at least when the tasks can be executed close to their memory &mdash; as is the case for servers, where tasks typically do not share large amounts of data.

In 1996 they released the first of a new series of machines based on this new architecture. Known internally as STiNG, an abbreviation for "Sequent: The Next Generation (with Intel inside)", it was productized as NUMA-Q and was the last of the systems released before the company was purchased by IBM for over $800 million. IBM then started Project Monterey with Santa Cruz Operation, intending to produce a NUMA-capable standardized Unix running on IA-32, IA-64 and POWER and PowerPC platforms. This project later fell through as both IBM and SCO turned to the Linux market, but is the basis for "the new SCO"'s SCO v. IBM Linux lawsuit.

IBM purchase and disappearance

With their future product strategy in tatters, it appeared Sequent had little future standing alone, and was soon purchased by IBM in 1999. In 2002, after Sun Microsystems began a public discussion of IBM's silence on their NUMA-based x430 system, IBM had a reduction-in-force, and announced that it had no further plans to market the x430 and would eventually drop support for the over 10,000 systems that Sequent and IBM had deployed.

According to a May 30, 2002 article in the "Wall Street Journal" (WSJ) entitled "Sequent Deal Serves Hard Lesson for IBM"::When IBM bought Sequent, ...it [Sequent] lacked the size and resources to compete with Sun and Hewlett-Packard Co. in the Unix server market....:In 1999, IBM had problems of its own with an aged and high-priced line of servers, particularly for its version of Unix known as AIX. It also faced huge losses in personal computers and declining sales in its cash-cow mainframe line. Robert Stephenson, who headed the server group at IBM, saw acquiring Sequent as the best route to make IBM competitive in the market for large Unix servers where Sun was gobbling up market share.

When Stephenson retired shortly after IBM completed its acquisition of Sequent, responsibility for servers fell on Samuel J. Palmisano. The "WSJ" article noted that Palmisano wanted to "simplify IBM's multipronged server strategy"; it also quoted Scott Gibson, one of three executives (along with Casey Powell and Larry Wade) who led Sequent when it was founded. Gibson told the "WSJ" the acquisition was doomed because "the guy who sponsored the acquisition retired."

An alternative view of IBM's actions, born out of the beliefWho|date=July 2007 that corporations maintain consistent strategies over the short and medium term despite executive changes, is that IBM acquired Sequent not to nurture it but simply to keep it out of Sun's clutches. Through its acquisition of what became the Enterprise 10000 server line from Cray, Sun had done so much financial damage to IBM's server market share, that IBM was very reluctant to see this disaster repeated.Fact|date=July 2007 Even if it generated zero revenue for IBM, the net present value of Sequent from IBM's viewpoint was higher inside IBM than inside Sun.
