        "text": "Post by Leif Harcke\n\nA while back, I acquired two older Unisys U-series machines: a UN\n\n6031 B and a UN 6051 B.\n\nI think the model numbers were U 6000/31 and U 6000/51. These were\n\nIA-32 architecture PCs running UNIX System Laboratories System V\n\nRelease 3. You may try mounting the disk in an old PC, booting into\n\nsome flavor of SVR3, and seeing if the OS can find the SCSI disk, list\n\npartitions, and fsck the partitions, etc.\n\nMy source said it was server using serial lines to connect the\n\nclients; it came from a retail back-office environment.\n\nThe machines were indeed data aggregators for the back-office\n\nenvironment. Later models were 486 machines running SVR4.\n\nhttp://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_n4_v31/ai_11875094\n\n[...].\n\nKmart, while ordering a system to finish its KIN II (Kmart\n\nInformation Network II) information system project, has continued to\n\nexpand its technology parameters from monitoring and reordering\n\nmerchandise into areas that range from in-store laser printing systems\n\nfor signs to tracking of store traffic.\n\nThe latest KIN II move involves installing the Unisys Intel\n\n486-based U 6000/65 multiprocessor UNIX system--computers, open\n\nsystem software, peripherals and integrated services--in about 1,200\n\nKmarts this year. The system will go into another 300 Kmarts opening\n\nduring 1993 and 1994.\n\nThe U 6000/65 system, which completes the KIN II project, is\n\ncustom-configured for Kmart by Unisys. The system runs under UNIX\n\nSystem Laboratories' UNIX System V Release 4, with multiprocessing\n\nextensions developed by the Multiprocessing Consortium whose members\n\ninclude Unisys.\n\nKIN II provides personnel with such advanced information processing\n\ncapabilities as better product availability and inventory balancing,\n\nextended in-store inventory analysis and labor management. The\n\nresult is better customer service and lower costs.\n\nDavid M. Carlson, vice president, corporate information systems,\n\nsaid Kmart is migrating to a UNIX standard because it's more flexible,\n\nproviding multiuser, multitasking capabilities.\n\nThe U 6000/65 system supplements the U 6000 Series computer Kmart\n\nhad previously ordered for 1,000 stores. The discounter has already\n\nfinished installing over 2,300 other U 6000 Series systems as part of\n\nits receiving department's automation project.\n\n[...]\n\nYes, I knew some of that. I just can't say\n\nto protect my source. I don't dare let the\n\nthings out of my site/sight until the drives\n\nare either wiped or destroyed. But, I like\n\n'mature' machines- I find them fun.\n\nThe number scheme- 6051 being\n\n6000/51- is probably what was hindering\n\nmy search. I should be able to turn up some\n\nmore info now, although first- and second-\n\nhand knowledge is always appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nTarkin\n\nAnne & Lynn Wheeler\n\nPost by Tarkin\n\nMainframes sound like a lot of fun\n\nin their own right.\n\nThe U-series remains a bit of mystery\n\nto nearly everyone, I'm afraid- except\n\nthe fine folks at KMart. Which gives me\n\na bit of an idea- I just may go to the\n\nsource, and see if I can get some info\n\nthere, if Usenet doesn't work out.\n\nweren't (at least some of) the u-series the rebranded sequent boxes?\n\ni've seen reference to u-series being unisys 68k unix boxes ... but\n\nweren't the unisys rebranded sequent boxes also labeled as u-series?\n\nof course when IBM bought sequent ... unisys was possibly forced to\n\nadopt some other platform.\n\nsequent did numaq with SCI (scalable coherent interface) ... we did\n\nsome consulting to sequent after leaving IBM (and before sequent was\n\nbought by IBM). SCI had 64-port . convex exemplar was 64 boards with\n\ntwo HP risc processors per board. Sequent (and data general) did SCI\n\nimplementation with 64 boards with four intel processor per board (for\n\n256 processor configuration).\n\nlater on in this time-frame (before the ibm purchase), Steve Chen\n\nwas CTO at sequent. a recent posts mentioning steve chen:\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2006q.html#9 Is no one reading the article?\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2006t.html#32 The Future of CPUs: What's After Multi-Core?\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2006v.html#12 Steve Chen Making China's Supercomputer Grid\n\nmisc. past postings mentioning sequent and/or sci\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/95.html#3a SMP, Sequent Computer Systems, and software\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/96.html#8 Why Do Mainframes Exist ???\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/96.html#25 SGI O2 and Origin system announcements\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/98.html#40 Comparison Cluster vs SMP?\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2000e.html#20 Is Al Gore The Father of the Internet?^\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2001b.html#14 IBM's announcement on RVAs\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2001b.html#39 John Mashey's greatest hits\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2001b.html#85 what makes a cpu fast\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2001f.html#11 Climate, US, Japan & supers query\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2001j.html#12 OT - Internet Explorer V6.0\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2001j.html#17 I hate Compaq\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2001j.html#45 OT - Internet Explorer V6.0\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2001n.html#35 cc SMP\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2001n.html#80 a.f.c history checkup...
