        "text": "The SCO Group has pulled another of IBM's Unix licences, that for the discontinued Dynix/ptx operating system which IBM acquired as part of its purchase of Sequent Computer Systems in 1999.\n\nIn a media release issued in Sydney, SCO said the Sequent (IBM) contract was terminated for what it claimed was improper transfer of Sequent's Unix source code and development methods into Linux.\n\nSCO said it had given two months notice before withdrawing the licence. The company has already sued IBM, seeking more than US$3 billion in damages, and has revoked IBM's licence to distribute its AIX operating system.\n\nIBM last week countersued SCO, claiming that it had incorrectly asserted rights over Linux. Big Blue has also alleged patent violations by SCO.\n\nIn the media release, SCO claimed its System V Unix contract allowed Sequent to prepare derivative works and modifications of System V software \"provided the resulting materials were treated as part of the Original [System V] Software.\"\n\n\"Restrictions on use of the Original System V Software include the requirement of confidentiality, a prohibition against transfer of ownership, and a restriction against use for the benefit of third parties. Sequent-IBM has nevertheless contributed approximately 148 files of direct Sequent Unix code to the Linux 2.4 and 2.5 kernels, containing 168,276 lines of code,\" the company said.\n\n\"This Sequent code is critical NUMA (non-uniform memory access) and RCU (read copy update) multi-processor code previously lacking in Linux. Sequent-IBM has also contributed significant Unix-based development methods to Linux in addition to the direct lines of code specified above. Through these Linux contributions, Sequent-IBM failed to treat Dynix as part of the original System V software, and exceeded the scope of permitted use under its Unix System V contract with SCO,\" it said."
