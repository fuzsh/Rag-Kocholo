We are anticipating a network infrastructure that spans all the business units within the group and that unifies access to all networked resources. We currently are designing and planning the architecture and the interfaces with existing, and proposed, systems and processes. Eventually, this infrastructure will support on the order of twenty thousand users, distributed across most of the US and internationally.\n\nThe group has background and experience from many computing environments and perspectives. Our challenge is to build on those diverse strengths and plan the best possible support for the users.\n\nBRIDGET ALLISON\n\nNetwork Appliance Inc.\n\n2770 San Tomas Expressway\n\nSanta Clara, CA 95051\n\ntel: 408 367 3419\n\nfax: 408 367 3151\n\nbridget@netapp.com\n\nI'm a technical marketing engineer working on integration issues around UNIX and NT file sharing - with specific reference to the CIFS protocol spec. I see NT as Microsoft's implementation of that spec and my company sell file servers that provide both nfs and cifs access to a common file system. I am particularly interested in the authentication and security-related aspects of NT and am working on ways to unify UNIX and NT authentication, looking particularly at Kerberos and ldap.\n\nERIC ANDERSON\n\neanders@cs.berkeley.edu\n\nAt our site, we are currently integrating NT into our primarily UNIX research environment. We have not yet found a solution with adequate security for connecting the NT and the UNIX filesystems. We also have not fully dealt with the problem of accessing other UNIX resources from an NT desktop or vice versa. Finally, we have been having substantial problems with the administration of NT (much of which is supposed to be fixed in NT 5.0), in particular, there is a substantial amount of work that each user needs to perform to get applications to work, and the environment available is substantially less uniform than in UNIX.\n\nThe second piece we are looking at is building large clusters of NT machines as a follow-on to the network of workstations research we have been doing at Berkeley. Here we are looking at how people should access the resources, and what is necessary for us to perform similar research on NT. We are trying to answer the question \"what is the benefit/costs for research on NT as opposed to research on UNIX.\"\n\nKARL A.

We need to access Windows office-automation apps, particularly MS-Exchange. We're using Citrix WinFrame to make MS apps available to the UNIX desktops.\n\nWe are also trying to integrate Windows computers into our DCE-based security architecture.\n\nALAN ATKINSON\n\nalan.atkinson@gs.com\n\n8th Floor\n\n85 Broad St.\n\nNew York, NY 10004\n\n(212) 902-2176\n\nWe (Goldman, Sachs & Co.) are in the midst of a very large scale (potentially 5000 workstations) global NT rollout. As the environment continues to grow, issues arise both with NT support and with integrating NT with our UNIX environment. In particular:\n\nNT:\n\n- How do we do efficient global software and OS updates?\n\n- How do we manage servers/workstations remotely?\n\nUNIX/NT integration:\n\n- How do we merge home directories, passwords, etc. - do we bother?\n\n- How do we handle users who need both NT and UNIX apps on their desktop?\n\n- How do we merge print and mail infrastructure - again, do we bother?\n\nAt present, we've managed to successfully merge backup and monitoring across the NT and UNIX platforms. We're still examining the other issues.\n\nALICIA F.

There are several locations on campus where small computers are maintained in open access labs. The configuration for these open access labs is based on Windows NT servers and Windows 95 clients.\n\nThese labs also provide access to the second tier computing facilities and the Internet. Second tier facilities include multiple-processors UNIX systems, in addition to a variety of other UNIX servers, operated by the Colleges and Academic Computing.\n\nBONNIE BERTELSON\n\nSystem Administrator\n\nMotorola Cellular Infrastructure Group\n\nIL27-3B6\n\n1501 W. Shure Drive\n\nArlington Heights, Illinois 60004\n\nbertlsnb@cig.mot.com\n\nPhone: (847) 435-9788\n\nFax: (847) 632-6658\n\nI am on the CIG Global Windows NT Project Team, focusing on the design of a Windows NT network architecture that unifies the CIG network globally. The project team is dedicated to designing and implementing a Windows NT architecture that works as one global network, integrated into the existing UNIX network.\n\nThe goal of any computer department is to provide end users with a computing environment which will help make their job function easier, more accurate and efficient. The current environment has performed well for the users, but changing needs and work habits, as well as changes in the desktop market, are requiring CIG to rethink some of its computer architecture strategy.\n\nThe engineering computing environment for CIG, has long been primarily composed of a UNIX infrastructure consisting of X-terminals and desktop workstations. This environment serves the engineering community well, because UNIX is the main development platform used to build the Motorola cellular infrastructure business.\n\nHowever, for the majority of the non-engineering community, the office desktop environment has been primarily composed of a Macintosh infrastructure consisting of desktop and laptop computers. But those environments are no longer proving to be suitable for the growing user base wanting or requiring a more standardized, compatible and widely supportable environment.\n\nPart of what we are doing with NT is transitioning the non-engineering community from the Macintosh to the NT platform and providing access to the UNIX servers as necessary. We are also deploying Net Appliances, using CIFS, for engineers who have need to develop on the Windows NT platform for our customers - thus providing \"home\" space for UNIX or NT users on the same machine (disk farm).\n\nOne problem is that CIG has three main platforms which need to share files/information - UNIX, Macintosh and NT - and I have not found a solution that covers file sharing on all three platforms. I hope this workshop will provide some direction for resolving this situation.\n\nJOSEPH BOYER JR.\n\nFuji Capital Markets Corp.\n\n2 World Trade Center\n\n80 Floor\n\nNY, NY 10048\n\nPhone #: (212)898-2884\n\nboyer@fcmc.com\n\nI have been working with NT on trading floors of various banks for the past few years and I am currently beginning an integration of UNIX and NT on Fuji's trading floor. One of my main concerns is how to integrate smoothly NT's and Solaris' name spaces. A product we are looking at to accomplish the matter is Uname It. The product proposes that it is will give one centralized database of user id's, hostnames, IP addresses, etc. Currently the NT client has not been release, but from demos and beta products their claim seems to be true.\n\nAnother issue is NT security and how Microsoft intends and how it has implemented security into its operating system. Question that are of interested are: Is there a way to integrate both Solaris' and NT security schema. If there, what is the best way to approach this or if not, how can we accomplish a close nit security schema with the least amount of administration.\n\nWe are currently using NT v4.0 server and workstation and we also have a few Win95 machines in the domain. The company will be using a multiple domain model, i.e., each major office will have its own PDC and will be the administrator of its own domain. We are doing this to be consistent with our UNIX domain setup.\n\nA few other concerns is the stability of the operating systems and its installed services and how it relates to the operating system's performance. I raise this issue because I have seen performance issues arise with both workstations and servers that have been up for an extended period of time. Is there a recommended amount of time a machine should be up before it is rebooted to refresh the system. Or is this an environment specific issue.\n\nLastly the future of NT. We all have seen NT 5.0 beta and what Microsoft promise with it, but what lies beyond NT 5.0 and how will effect our current hardware, apps, etc.\n\nJAMES J. BOZEK\n\nSequent Computer Systems, Inc.\n\nmoleman@sequent.com\n\n550 Kirkland Way, ste 264\n\nKirkland, WA 98033\n\nPhone: (425) 739-2060\n\nURL: www.sequent.com\n\nSequent Computer Systems, Inc. manufactures and delivers large scale, multiprocessor computer systems that address the needs of large data centers. There are two areas of relevant focus:\n\nNT on cc-NUMA\n\nThe Sequent Symmetry product line has been based upon a Symmetrical Multi-Processor (SMP) architecture (2-32 processors) leveraging commodity components (e.g., Intel Pentium CPUs). These systems were delivered with a Sequent-developed scaleable UNIX, DYNIX/ptx.\n\nLast year, Sequent introduced a new product line called the NUMA-Q 2000. In contrast to a large bus SMP architecture, the NUMA-Q 2000 is a scaleable hardware product based upon a Pentium Pro cache-coherent Non Uniform Memory Architecture (cc-NUMA) using a 4-processor building block. Dynix/ptx was modified and enhanced to efficiently support the NUMA-Q 2000 architecture. NT scalability and performance is being investigated with\n\nrespect to cc-NUMA architectures. Of particular concern are issues of I/O distribution and scheduling, memory management, and processor allocation.\n\nMixed NT and UNIX (DYNIX/ptx)\n\nHeterogeneous environments raise issues of system management, resource sharing, and system control. The range of tools and products in both environments is constantly growing which creates a challenge in delivering customer oriented management and control capabilities. Relevant issues in such an environment include: the integration of UNIX and NT, file sharing, fault tolerance, application services, user administration, serviceability, security, and reliability.\n\nMICHAEL R. BROWN\n\nWindows NT Core Administrator\n\nEngineering Computing, Motorola, Inc, Land Mobil Products Sector\n\n8000 W Sunrise Blvd, M/S 2426 Plantation, FL 33322\n\nPhone: 954-723-2969, Fax 954-723-4753\n\nbrownmic@comm.mot.com\n\nAt our site we design and manufacture two-way radios. We have traditionally had software engineers, mechanical engineers, and electrical engineers on various UNIX platforms, including HP-UX, SunOS, Solaris, and a few others. In addition, we have other users (administrative, managerial, and the like) on Macintosh systems. Because of the Macintoshes, our UNIX people are forced to use Macintosh emulator like MAE or Liken to deal with email and files exchanged with them. In the last year, we've started to move some of our users off of Macintoshes and UNIX systems to Windows NT systems. It first started only for our Software Engineers, but other groups have also looked at or wanted to move toward Windows NT. At present we have some 300+ Windows NT systems, along with some Windows NT servers to prove certain services, like mail. We currently have an Exchange server and will soon have an SMS server. However, as we have invested a large amount into UNIX servers, these still exist as serve as fileservers for our NT users, keeping home and project directories there, as well as serving as build servers and X servers for those UNIX apps that don't (or maybe never) be ported to NT.\n\nI serve as the Windows NT Core Administrator, responsible for our NT servers and the overall NT infrastructure. I am also responsible for the Exchange server and will be one of the people responsible for the SMS server. My position is as a 'second line' support for our systems, backing up our 'Local Windows NT Admins'. Among some of the projects I have been involved with and continue to be involved with in our migration is the development of NT Support Processes, our installed Windows NT Workstation Baseline, and our Windows NT Domain Architecture.\n\nCHARLES H. BUCHHOLTZ\n\nManager of Systems Programming\n\nSchool of Engineering and Applies Science\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\nchip@seas.upenn.edu\n\n200 S. 33rd St.\n\nPhila. PA 19104-6314\n\nph/fax: (215) 898-2491 / (215) 898-1195\n\nThe engineering school has about 3000 computer users (students, faculty, and staff). We run NT in our public PC labs which are used primarily by students (approximately 150 machines). We also run NT in the business offices. Faculty and staff desktops run whatever they want, often Windows 3.1 or Macintosh.\n\nBenefits from running NT:\n\npublic labs: they want PCs, we want access control to lock down machines. NT's administrative overhead is balanced with the reduced software maintenance cost (because we don't have to re-install the OS twice a week per machine).\n\nbusiness offices: they want PCs and stability, we want them to be able to manage them themselves. NT works out well -- they have file permissions and the business offices all have NT, so they can share whatever they feel like whenever they feel like without contacting us.\n\nCustomizations done to NT:\n\npublic labs: WinBatch & Perl provide us a login system for NT 3.51 that uses our existing UNIX credentials. WinInstall keeps us from having to install new applications on all 120+ PCs.\n\nBusiness offices: Central backups nightly using Retrospect. Retrospect lets us push restores right back on to the machine they came from.\n\nPAM BUFFINGTON\n\nCollege of Computing\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n\nAtlanta GA 30332-0280\n\nPh: 404-894-4796\n\nFx: 404-894-9826\n\npamc@cc.gatech.edu\n\nMuch of the College of Computing's freshman and sophomore curriculum is being reworked, both to bring it more in line with industry trends and as part of a conversion of the entire curriculum from quarters to semesters. Windows NT has been chosen as the operating system environment that will be used to support this portion of the curriculum, with Java serving as the initial programming language to which students are exposed. A number of multimedia, graphics, telecommunications, software engineering, educational technology, and parallel processing classes are also experimenting with using the NT environment, either as a replacement or in addition to the existing UNIX environments.\n\nWithin less than a year, our installed base of Intel PC's has gone from about 25 to more than 150, with an additional 200 expected before the end of the calendar year, with most of this 300+ systems resulting from donations of equipment from Intel in support of instruction and research. The most recent gift will replace all 150 Ph.D. student desktops (currently X terminals) with PC's. Since the Intel PC is essentially a new platform for the College and one that is experiencing explosive growth, it presents many problems and opportunities. After much study and discussion, as well as consultation with peers in industry and academe, it has been decided that only Windows NT and Solaris x86 will be supported on this platform, both to which we have been granted source code access.\n\nFaced with having to bring a large number of new systems of a new architecture into the computing infrastructure quickly with only one additional staff member and no net decrease in the number of other computing platforms (350+ Sun and SGI workstations, 150+ Macintoshes), we decided early on that this was going to be impossible unless we could add the NT systems in such a fashion as to build on our existing infrastructure and expertise. Further, the NT systems would have to integrate/interoperate fully with this existing infrastructure, both for the sake of the users as well as our own. This must include (in parenthesis is our current, possibly partial or kludgy, solution):\n\n- sharing/availability across all environments of user home directories that are distributed throughout the College network (distributed Samba servers, with user home directories required to be on UNIX NFS hosts)\n\n- centralized single username, password, and access permissions that are manipulable using our existing homebrew account management system and centralized user account database (beta NIS and PDC extensions to NCD's WinCenter server product, along with some local kludges, allow us to control NT username, password, home directory, rudimentary access restrictions, etc. on the PDC's and SDC's via NIS maps maintained on UNIX hosts)\n\n- utilization of existing backup infrastructure (added to existing Mac backups using Retrospect, with both possibly transitioning to Legato in the future)\n\n- utilization of our current systems administration/automation paradigms - e.g. standard system installs, automated nightly/on-demand updates and patches, etc. (in progress, using scripts and methods similar to existing)\n\n- utilization of distributed, shared application servers with \"floating\" shared licenses (using existing Sassafras License server [for Mac] for NT application license checkout in combination with distributed, shared NT application servers)\n\nEven though many of our vendors (especially on the NT side) cannot seem to understand why we would want this level of integration/interoperation, we're perhaps 95% there using our first-cut solutions to many of these problems, although many are quite kludgy. We have already achieved a level of integration which we believe (based on our contacts with some other sites) is still pretty rare and we have survived the first wave of 150 systems, but there are still gaps and we don't yet have a good idea how well it will scale to the next 300. Further, we hope there may be better freeware or commercial solutions that others either have developed or have planned in the near term which may prove to be better or more standard, especially as relates to the second and fourth of the five points above.\n\nNANCY JOHNSON BURR\n\nComputer Science & Engineering\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\nBox 352350\n\nSeattle, WA 98195-2350\n\nburr@cs.washington.edu\n\n(206)543-2371\n\n(206)543-2969 (fax)\n\nWe've been a dyed-in-the-wool UNIX shop, but have recently had an influx of NT systems and are feeling the integration and migration pains. A lot of our undergrad courses are migrating towards NT, as are a lot of the faculty/staff desktop computing and some of our research projects, yet our basic infrastructure support still relies heavily on UNIX.\n\nI'm mainly interested in the integration/co-existence issues related to UNIX and NT, NT security issues, how other groups manage the mix of large shared computing labs and a large base of private desktop systems, and the issues and options for remote system management of a large installed base of NT systems.\n\nDAVID BUTLER\n\nTexas Instruments, Inc.

Our present installation deals mainly with Engineering Design Automation(EDA) applications as well as mainstream PC applications that are of the 16bit genre and cause the majority of our problems(lockups and crashes).\n\nGERALD CARTER\n\nEngineering Network Services\n\n103-L Building\n\nAuburn University\n\nAuburn, AL, 36849\n\njerry@eng.auburn.edu\n\nphone: (334) 844 - 2280\n\nfax: (334) 844 - 4034\n\nOur current Network configuration consists of 400+ Sun workstations, 650+ PC's running a mixture NFS clients ( DOS, Windows 3.1, Windows 95 ) and approximately 50 Macintosh systems. Within the past year, we have upgraded several student PC labs to a Windows 95 / Samba configuration. Several more upgrades are in the near future.\n\nThe emergence of the Windows 95/NT ( Microsoft) Networking have forced us to address new twists to such issues as user authentication, file system security, process security, stability and remote administration. Our goal is to provide a secure, distributed computing environment for both faculty and students.\n\nWith a current support staff of six full time positions and two half-time ones, it would be impossible to maintain a network of individual, independent machines. We hope that by being able to integrate existing PC clients with a Solaris based infrastructure, we can satisfy the needs ( and wants ) of our users without compromising security or stability.\n\nMARCO CECCHETTO\n\nPlatinum Solutions, Inc.\n\n11100 NE 8th St., Suite 400\n\nBellevue, WA 98004\n\nTel. 425-688-9456, FAX 425-688-9497\n\nmarco_cecchetto@platsol.com\n\nI am currently administrating a small network of about 50 machines. The supported platforms are a mix of Intel-based boxes with 6-7 SPARCstations and 3-4 NeXTStep boxes. The local OS's are NT4.0, Solaris 2.4 & 2.5, NeXTStep 3.x and 4.x, and Windows95. Most of the work done here is OpenStep related. The infrastructure is UNIX-based. WindowsNT was added in acknowledgment of client requirements. Despite the rabid attitudes of the local developers, NT WILL become a major element in this network in the near future and the challenge (now and later) is to integrate the various elements of the network to support all project efforts .\n\nDAVID CHINN\n\nchinn@zso.dec.com\n\nActually, this is more of an information gathering exercise.\n\nI work for a vendor: digital equipment corporation, and I'm interested in hearing about the problems that systems administrators are currently having with administering very large scale sites.\n\nRICHARD CHYCOSKI\n\nSimon Fraser University\n\nAcademic Computing Services\n\nBurnaby, B.C.\n\nCanada\n\nrichard@sfu.ca\n\nVoice: +1-604-291-4715\n\nFax: +1-604-291-4242\n\nI need to find a solution to get @#^%#$^ NT to live peacefully in large, heterogeneous sites that have no central organisation, but very mobile users! (a.k.a.: Universities. :-)\n\nWe're attempting to use Novell NDS for NT services to facilitate the combination of a large group of \"inseparable\" users (17,000 students and 3000 faculty and staff) along with a plethora of independent fiefdoms (50+ departments) where an individual expects to be able to drop in and get their \"central\" environment along with the \"departmental\" environment (and maybe several other \"departmental\" environments), and hopefully leave the computer in a usable running state when they sign off.\n\n(Was that a long enough run-on sentence? :-)\n\nNDS has not yet proven to be the \"silver bullet\" that we had hoped, since it does not solve the \"multiple personality\" aspect of our problem, but it does make it possible to handle large numbers of accounts in a central (read: lower maintenance) fashion. Until we see Microsoft's solution (with distributed replicated databases), we intend to beat NDS into shape to provide this functionality.\n\nPAUL CLARK\n\nComputer Specialist\n\nNaval Postgraduate School\n\nclarkp@cs.nps.navy.mil\n\nother: 833 Dyer Rd., Code CS\n\nMonterey, CA 93943\n\noffice: (408) 656-2395\n\nFAX: (408) 656-2814\n\nI am representing the Computer Security Track of the Computer Science Department of the Naval Postgraduate School. I manage all the lab systems used for both teaching and research. Windows NT is a new addition to the lab, dominated mostly by different variants of UNIX. Because the Navy has declared that they will be using Windows NT, we have started to purchase a number of NT workstations and servers.

The transition has been painful, partially due to lack of WinNT expertise, partially due to the users coming from the win95 the-user-is-root security(not) model and the admins coming from the UNIX security model. We are still struggling with how to set up security permissions so that the system and the user are protected but the user can still get work done. We are also struggling with how to administrate WinNT boxes that are located in geographically separate areas but which must all be administrated by the few over-worked admins at the main office. We need tools to automate installs, upgrades, fixes. We need tools to help us figure out how to set ACLs to maximize security and minimize user frustration. We need tools to fix the stupid registry which keeps becoming corrupted for who knows what reasons. Integration is always difficult but with samba we feel we at least have a handle on file integration. We currently use WinCenter to integrate application for the UNIX machines but we need better integration for the WinNT boxes into the UNIX application world.\n\nARIEL COHEN\n\nGeneral manager, Sela Systems and lecturer at Tel-Aviv University, Computer Science department, School of Mathematical Sciences\n\nContact Address: Sela Systems, 10 Hakishon St. Bnei-Brak, Israel 51203\n\nPhone: +972-3-6190999\n\nFax: +972-3-6190992\n\naco@sela.co.il\n\nWeb: https://www.sela.co.il/\n\nMy involvement with Windows NT includes the following research and projects:\n\n* Merging UNIX and NT User Administration, authentication, authorization, etc.\n\n* Development and deployment of system monitoring tools for Windows NT.\n\n* Configuration of computer classes based on diskless (or dataless) Win95/NT workstations served by both NT and UNIX servers.\n\n* Merging UNIX and NT software development environments, including Configuration Management tools and methods.\n\nThe above mentioned research and projects are conducted mainly within Sela Systems, partly as a result of our customers' needs and partly as an attempt to provide new products and services to our customers.

Briefly, the PCAS services offered our customers, in a multi-user environment, are:\n\n1. compute server,\n\n2. user login authentication/management,\n\n3. user UNIX home directory access (U: drive),\n\n4. user NT profile access,\n\n5. print services, and\n\n6. application access.\n\nI have already worked through the following NT issues:\n\n1. controlling access to the C: drive with multiple applications,\n\n2. accessing Print services in another domain, and\n\n3. accessing applications, from an application server, also\n\nin another domain and all the related problems associated\n\nwith the \"guest\" permissions.\n\nWith the next release of PCAS, I am looking for the knowledge, to assist me in working the following NT issues:\n\n1. system error monitoring with the end result a morning report summarizing system activity/problems over the previous 24 hours sent as a mail message to a UNIX account,\n\n2. a user PCAS profile stored in a file, \".pcas\", that will seamlessly setup what ever is needed by a customer's work environment (analogous to .openwin-init) like connecting drives, etc., and\n\n3. proactive system event management with the end product a mechanism to look for problems and once detected, correct or notify someone via email or pager.\n\nLAURA CURTIS\n\nLaura.Curtis@pnl.gov\n\nBattelle PNNL\n\nPO Box 999\n\nK7-28\n\nRichland, WA 99352\n\n(509)375-2311\n\nI am a fairly new user of NT. I have been a UNIX system administrator/developer for the last 7 years. I am currently on a highly visible project that runs on two UNIX platforms and is going to start porting to Windows NT in the next couple months.\n\nThe project is to develop a portable 3D Ultrasound/telemedicine system for the DOD. The DOD uses NT quite extensively and we feel that the users of our system would feel more comfortable using this operating system.\n\nWe have already received awards and recognition for the versions we have running on the UNIX platforms and hope to make it as successful on the NT platform.\n\nKRIS CUTAIA\n\nManager, Systems & Operations\n\nAnadarko Petroleum Corp.\n\n17001 Northchase Drive\n\nHouston, Texas 77060\n\n(281) 876-8645\n\nkris_cutaia@anadarko.com\n\nAnadarko is an Oil and Gas Exploration company. Our environment consists of approximately 70 UNIX and NT servers and approximately 1500 PC's running NT on the desktops. We have a WAN with three T1 lines from Houston to London, Liberal and Midland. Our Network Operating System is NT running mostly on COMPAQ 5000s.\n\nI along with two other people do the system administration for all of the UNIX database servers and will soon be moving some of the Sybase Databases to SQL Server on NT and doing the NT System Administration for these as well.\n\nTo date, we have used NT for the desktop, for the network operating system, file servers and print servers. We have NOT used NT for database servers yet. We are going to move all of our UNIX/Sybase databases to NT/SQL Server. These applications are mission critical and I have several concerns about whether or not NT is ready to house large databases for departmental mission critical systems. Our user community is used to having 99% availability on HP UNIX and Sybase systems. I am at the point where I believe I need to buy a redundant server in order to ensure this level of service. I am also concerned about having 50 simultaneous users hitting a database at one time and am looking at what tools are available for stress testing an NT/SQL Server system. I am also concerned that most benchmarks with NT as a database server are generated on NT systems with 3 GB of memory. My UNIX systems run very large databases with 256 MB of memory just fine. I am interested to find out if other people have seen a need to put larger amounts of memory on NT than they are used to putting on UNIX. If so, what is it about NT that requires so much more memory for databases? Is this how they have managed to get the benchmark numbers they have? How do you size an NT machine based on the UNIX machine it will replace. I am also interested in backup strategies and how a \"used to be mainframe\" operators can be used in an NT environment.\n\nANN TRUMP DANIEL\n\nMacmillan Computer Publishing\n\nExecutive Editor\n\n512-349-2865\n\nFax: 512-349-2825\n\nadaniel@texas.net\n\n4212 Cat Hollow Drive\n\nAustin, Texas 78731\n\nI am an Executive Editor responsible for developing a series of books for systems administrators faced with managing an NT installation.

I have been doing UNIX Systems Administration and software development for about 15 years and have not yet done much with Windows.\n\nAs for the workshop for researchers, I think I will get exposure to issues such as Windows NT software development and considerations of upwards scalability of NT with respect to various scenarios. This will be valuable involvement I might have in scientific applications implementation, large database systems and distributed operating system research and application implementation and consultation. It will also directly relate to a research project I will be involved in, where various distributed systems approaches will be compared (DCOM, DCE and CORBA). A copy of the abstract for a research grant proposal that Bina Ramamurthy, a faculty member in CS, has submitted to NSF is attached. I will be involved in this project at several levels. This project will also benefit me in that I am actively involved in a campus-wide group (Distributed Computing Working Group) which is a vehicle for evaluation and recommendation as my University considers various distributed computing approaches.\n\nAbstract: Interoperability and Security Features for Open Distributed Computing\n\nThe main goal of this research is to study the features needed to build a highly interoperable and secure architecture for open distributed computing. Open distributed computing refers to collaborative computing among many large, independent distributed computing environments. Such systems are commonly used in a wide range of application areas including mobile computing, simulation, design automation, enterprise-wide integrated computing, just to mention a few prominent ones. Distributed computing infrastructures offer virtually unlimited connectivity and accessibility to information. Connectivity is exploited to provide collaboration among the distributed components of the system. Such collaboration relies heavily on the extent of interoperability among the various components of the distributed system. Moreover, security is extremely critical for establishing trust among the interoperable environments and for warding off the vulnerability brought about by distributed control of resources. The two highly inter-dependent issues, namely, interoperability and security are the focus of this proposal.\n\nA new interoperability protocol will be defined. It will specify how to field a request from a client, validate the request, select the appropriate server using the directory services, and translate and delegate the request to the selected server. The approach that will be used in realizing the interoperability protocol is to extend the facilities and services of currently available middleware packages. A prototype ODC architecture will be designed and developed to test the protocol. Three different environments (i) DCE on Solaris, (ii) CORBA on Solaris and (iii) DCOM on Windows NT have been selected to build the prototype. Specific issues to be addressed in this research include: (i) mechanisms for realizing interoperability, and (ii) mechanisms for handling insecurity that arises due to interoperation, and (iii) reducing the security checking overheads. Extensive performance evaluation under various request patterns, optimal client-server configurations, load balancing and scalability are some issues that will be addressed in the future extensions of the proposed research.\n\nThis research has other broader goals with educational connotations. These goals are: (i) involving undergraduates in scientific research, (ii) incorporation of topics of current interest in undergraduate curriculum using special projects, and (iii) building a model distributed systems laboratory.\n\nDAN DOROUGH\n\nSystems Specialist\n\nIT-DCAS\n\nUniversity of California, Davis\n\nDavis, CA 95616\n\nPhone: (916)752-3420\n\ndadorough@ucdavis.edu\n\nWe are considering Windows NT as a base platform for communication servers, specifically unattended servers in phone closets, communications huts, and other unmonitored locations. We are also interested in using NT as a research base for application protocols over TCP, with the potential to deploy research or production applications comparatively quickly to individuals with Windows NT or Windows 95 desktops.\n\nI am especially interested in using NT for large numbers (200-500) of concurrent application protocol server processes for everything from POP, SMTP, WHOIS, and LDAP to custom protocols for managing network equipment. I am most keenly interested in learning about managing a large population of usernames (10000-50000) in a single NT registry, using custom-built tools we develop.\n\nBECKY DOWELL\n\nWang / I-Net\n\nMS INI-18\n\nKennedy Space Center, FL 32899\n\nphone (407) 867-6766\n\nfax (407) 867-6933\n\nBecky.Dowell-1@kmail.ksc.nasa.gov\n\nMARK PAGE\n\nWang / I-Net\n\nMS INI-18\n\nKennedy Space Center, FL 32899\n\nphone (407) 867-6767\n\nfax (407) 867-6933\n\nMark.Page-1@kmail.ksc.nasa.gov\n\nWe are in the final stages of developing a Wide Area Network Security Gateway (WSG). The WSG filters and/or monitors network traffic, and logs traffic data. The development of WSG has given us experience in many areas of NT, including development from the kernel level to the application level, and administration of MS SQL Server and MS Internet Information Server. WSG was initially built under Windows NT 3.51, and is currently being ported to NT 4.0 The WSG software consists of a kernel mode driver, built over the NDIS layer. The kernel mode driver receives packets from the NDIS layer, filters them based on an access list, and passes traffic data up to a user mode Win32 application. The user mode application is a Winsock UDP client, which sends the traffic data to a Winsock UDP server residing on another machine. The UDP server dumps the traffic data to a text file, which is imported into MS SQL Server. Network managers search the traffic data via a web based interface.\n\nWe were also involved in the migration of approximately 100 NT domains to a centralized NT master domain. We are currently in the process of migrating the Kennedy Space Center mail system to MS Exchange 4.0 and 5.0. This migration involves moving various disparate mail systems to a centralized Exchange service. Approximately 10,000 clients will be migrated over a one year period. Our involvement has ranged from system and network design to client installation and configuration.\n\nKSC currently has several different directory services. We are researching using NT to develop a directory services architecture that will integrate messaging, security, and network objects directory services.\n\nIn the near future, we plan to research real time OS for windows NT for space station and space shuttle check out launch control systems.\n\nSTEVE DOWNS\n\nQualcomm Incorporated\n\nsdowns@qualcomm.com\n\nWe are currently focusing on implementing SMS for our enterprise. We have about 3000 NT workstations and are looking for a way to easily manage those systems causing as little disruption to the end user as possible. Providing an easy way to distribute software to users who do not have Local Admin will be a great benefit.\n\nAnother area we are looking into is setting up highly available servers on NT. These would primarily be database and web servers. We are looking to WolfPack to provide that functionality.\n\nJAMES N.

There are well over 1000 computers at our lab, spread out in multiple buildings and remote sites. We're a Navy research lab, so security of the machines is very important.\n\nI hope to organize and automate much of the routine work regarding host names, domain names, NT hostnames, NT domain names, printing and file services, trusted third-party authentication, remote audit, inventory, license administration, and message notification. I'm also attempting to write most of our in-house network tools in perl (with output in HTML) to make them easily portable to NT machines.\n\nIn particular, an honors student has selected as a project the development of an automated network service monitoring system that displays status via clickable HTML-based maps. Part of our proof of usefulness is test it on NT and make certain it is portable between it and UNIX. Another project is to provide a cohesive umbrella environment to merge services with NT and UNIX machines, perhaps by starting with samba to provide shared file services between the two platforms (the two \"worlds\", really). The next step would be to provide, or execute, a security assessment tool like cops or satan, etc., on each machine to evaluate its level of security, patch level, installed software and hardware, and so on.\n\nAmbitious, I'm sure.\n\nMICKEY ELLINGER\n\nElectrical Engineering/Computer Science\n\nUC Berkeley\n\n330 Soda Hall\n\nBerkeley CA 94720\n\nmickey@eecs.berkeley.edu\n\nWe run the instructional computing labs for the Computer Science and Engineering courses at a university. Traditionally, we have run UNIX workstation clusters on Ethernet for most programming and simulation applications, and PCs on Novell LANs for dedicated controllers and smaller programs.\n\nIn the last year we have moved PCs in to the workstation labs, because they are now powerful enough to run UNIX and NT for our course software. The open market for WINTEL hardware and software makes the PCs very appealing. NT 4.0 has great applications and a consistent user interface, so it is increasingly in demand here. We sys admins worry about the security (ActiveX, how to control use of the C: drive, ...) and maintenance (how to distribute software and keep public-access NT workstations consistent).\n\nOREN ESHEL\n\nSystem Administrator\n\nE*TRADE Group, Inc.\n\n4 Embarcadero Place\n\n2400 Geng Rd\n\nPalo Alto, CA 94303\n\noeshel@etrade.com\n\noeshel@mail.wenet.net\n\ntel: 415-842-2495\n\nfax: 415-842-2525\n\nE*TRADE Group, Inc., provides internet-based financial services for individual investors/consumers. Over the past year, E*TRADE has migrated its internal users, spread over two primary locations in California as well as several secondary domestic and international sites, to Windows NT for basic file and print sharing functions, host connections, and Web and database applications.\n\nOver the next year, E*TRADE is looking to enhance its LAN environment for more efficient administration, increased user services, and greater security/reliability. Issues that E*TRADE will be dealing with include enterprise backup, automated desktop software distribution and maintenance, server clustering and failover, distributed and/or replicated file systems, and tools for creating Web and database applications. In addition, E*TRADE will be working to integrate services that reside on either UNIX or NT servers, such as name services, system backups, and security; to create a unified development environment; and to build an infrastructure for delivering sound and video to the desktop over the corporate intranet.\n\nE*TRADE is also looking at the feasibility of migrating its existing customer applications from UNIX and VMS environments to Windows NT as well as developing new applications to run on the Windows NT platform. The same challenges for the internal environment, outlined above, will also be encountered in the customer environment, particularly the replication and failover of distributed databases and file systems. Running large scale applications on NT will require taking a different approach to hardware and software and scaling the environment to a higher level.\n\nI am looking to understand the current and developing technologies geared toward addressing these issues and comparing what other organizations have done with the approaches that E*TRADE has taken to date.\n\nNATHAN EVANS\n\nData Protection Analyst\n\nData Protection Distributed Systems\n\nFederal Express Corporation\n\n5550 Tech Center Drive\n\nColorado Springs, CO 80919\n\nTel: 719-262-1268\n\nFax: 719-599-5011\n\nPgr: 800-609-4895\n\nnevans@fedex.com\n\nURL: https://www.fedex.com\n\nFederal Express is researching issues regarding large-scale implementation of Windows NT and how it compares to a UNIX operating system.

We are a research institution, with a primary focus on scientific computation, typically on supercomputers. We also do work in advanced visualization, high-performance networking, and collaboration. We have been a UNIX shop for many years now, but we have jumped heavily onto the NT bandwagon. A year ago we had perhaps 5 NT machines, now we have closer to 100; they are very much a part of our production environment, but we can't manage them as well as we can our UNIX machines.\n\nI am involved in a number of projects with NT:\n\n- We are building a parallel computing cluster out of NT boxes in order to compare commodity-based supercomputing to the more traditional style that we currently use. I am presenting some of our systems administration experiences with this set of machines at the workshop.\n\n- The number of NT machines in our division has increased rather dramatically during the last year. I'm interested in issues of integration, remote and centralized administration, and scalability. We've learned a great deal about these areas recently and are looking forward to sharing experiences with other.\n\n- Several research projects in our division are porting code to NT. We are finding that managing NT machines for research is more difficult than UNIX machines (both for us and the researchers) due to the infinite tweakability of the NT machines and the desire of most NT applications to be installed locally on the machine rather than on a network server, among others things. I'm hoping that people in similar situations will have solutions for these kinds of problems.\n\nWILLIAM FIGUEROA\n\nMentor Graphics Corp.\n\n27788 SW Parkway Ave\n\nWilsonville, Or 97070\n\nPhone: 503-685-1644\n\nFax: 503-685-7986\n\nwillie_figueroa@mentorg.com\n\nWe are just beginning to organize our PC's in our environment. Currently we have a very simple layout (one PDC, one BDC, one Distribution server, about 100 client PCs ). The company will soon begin to ramp up the PC count and consequently, we'll change from an almost casual PC administration to something more serious and complex. Still our UNIX boxes far out number our PC's in our development environment but that will not be the case for long.\n\nThe problems we are currently encountering is how to manage a growing population of PC desktops, and what tools or concepts to bring in help administer them. SMS looks promising, samba/pcnfs is troubling, backing up looks clunky. We are basically UNIX administrators trying to understand the foreign world of NT.\n\nT.J.

It is my responsibility to administer and deploy Windows NT and its associate applications to both the general student labs and the administrative staff of the Computer Science department and in some cases the College of Engineering as a whole. We began experimenting with NT 4.0 over a year ago and have had it deployed in the general labs for over 8 months and with the administrative staff for about 5 months.\n\nAt this point, NT serves primarily an educational and administrative role at our site. Research with that operating system is at a minimum and primarily consisting of porting previously existing applications and prototype drivers to it from Linux or another UNIX operating system. Our primary interests in the conference and NT as a whole currently are efforts to ease the system administration of NT as a whole and particularly to centralize it. We also are interested in end-user security, or methods to prevent the apparently inevitable corruption of an NT installation by many unauthorized users with aborted software installations and such. Finally, we are interested in providing as close of links with UNIX (and particularly Linux) as possible. Things such as file system drivers for Linux and shared authentication and protection models are of prime importance to us and tools like Samba and our own password synchronization unit are used extensively at our site.\n\nRAYMOND GALLONI\n\nINFOSEC Engineer\n\nMITRE Corporation\n\n202 Burlington Road\n\nBedford, MA 01730\n\n(617)271-5267\n\nfax: (617) 271-3816\n\nrpgallon@mitre.org\n\nOur sponsors are beginning to migrate their UNIX and NetWare based networks over to Windows NT.

We are also looking at tools with more specific functions such as Event Log Analyzers, Access Control Analyzers, and Registry Analyzers. Overall, this toolkit must allow for a comprehensive analysis of network health, while not being too cumbersome to use.\n\nFuture goals will include developing a recommended security posture for implementation of NT Server and Workstation in a large-scale environment.

I am particularly interested in performance differences that others may have encountered between UNIX and Windows NT.\n\nlewis@netserver.Stanford.EDU\n\nSTEVE HANSON\n\nSystem Administrator\n\nHoneywell Technology Center\n\nMN65-3410\n\n3660 Technology Dr.\n\nMinneapolis, MN 55418\n\n(612)951-7596\n\nfax (612)951-7438\n\nshanson@htc.honeywell.com\n\nThe Honeywell Technology center is an established UNIX site, having approximately 200 UNIX systems, mostly Sun. Recently there has been a serious culture shock within the organization, as large numbers of NT systems are being put in. Unfortunately, very little thought had been given to how these machines are going to be administered, since the users and management had felt that these were after all PC's and wouldn't have the high administration costs they believe are necessary for UNIX machines. So far experience seems to be showing that the cost of ownership for the NT boxes appears to be higher than for the UNIX machines, and that many of the models of administration we have for UNIX systems don't work very well in the NT environment.\n\nOne of the end results has been that many users are using the new NT systems on their desks as badly implemented X terminals to display applications that they are actually running on UNIX systems. Simultaneously, many of our management are congratulating themselves on how they have been saving money by making the transition to cheaper PC systems - apparently they haven't looked at this years computing budget, which has grown considerably to support the mix of systems. The addition of NT boxes to the network in large numbers has raised a number of difficult interoperability issues, for most of which we have found no solutions.\n\nSTEVEN HEARN\n\nManager Systems Management\n\nInfrastructure Development\n\nWestpac Banking Corporation\n\nLevel 4, 72 Christie Street\n\nSt. Leonards Sydney NSW 2065\n\nhearns@ozemail.com.au\n\nThe following paragraphs outline the Large Scale NT Operations Management disciplines that we are addressing today. We are managing in excess of 1000 NT Servers, and the number is likely to grow. UNIX systems are also on the increase and are starting to participate in the NT environment.\n\nIn Progress\n\n* Help Desk processes and tools to support our branches.\n\n* Centralized NT alerting for critical operating system events and business alarms.\n\n* Management reporting of historical alerts to assist with follow-up tasks.\n\n* Software and data distribution capability to all branches.\n\n* Change Management and Lodgment of PC applications into existing host based systems.\n\n* Education on the Help Desk to assist with the acceptance of new Systems Management needs and processes.\n\nThe organization has also successfully deployed a large scale diskless remote boot workstation platform. This is helping to reduce distributed Systems Management overheads. Management of the critical servers is paramount, whilst the remote boot scenario helps to reduce daily workstation administration.\n\nPlanned Activities\n\nThere are several disciplines or requirements within the realm of distributed Systems Management that will be addressed. These include:\n\n* Proactive capacity and performance management.\n\n* Enhanced virus management.\n\n* Local NT automation.\n\n* Application management.\n\n* Enterprise integration.\n\n* Intranet.\n\n* Updated Systems Management strategy and business alignment.\n\nSTEVE HILLMAN\n\nhillman@sfu.ca\n\nSystems Consultant\n\n604-291-3960\n\nAcademic Computing Services\n\nSimon Fraser University\n\nSimon Fraser University is a mid-sized university with roughly 15000 full-time students and 5000 computers around campus. About half of those computers are PCs. Most computing resources are provided by Academic Computing Services, where I work as a Systems Administrator. We provide centrally administered computing accounts, file & print services, e-mail, and in most cases, web services. Virtually all services are a mix of UNIX and NetWare, however we have recently upgraded our public labs to Pentium-based PCs running NT Workstation and integration has become an issue.\n\nOur goal is to integrate NT as smoothly as possible into our existing infrastructure, rather than restructure everything to accommodate NT. A student should be able to sit down at any public workstation, login with their assigned ID, and access their e-mail, UNIX (via Samba?) or NetWare filespace, and appropriate printers. A student should also be able to login in from a professor's NT-equipped machine without messing with the environment or leaving the machine in an unfriendly state afterwards.\n\nSo far, this is proving challenging!\n\nJOHN HOLMWOOD\n\nInfrastructure Architect\n\nNOVA Gas Transmission Ltd.\n\nPO Box 2535 Station M\n\nCalgary, AB Canada\n\nT2P 2N6\n\nPhone 403 261 8349\n\nFax 403 261 8333\n\njohn.holmwood@pipe.nova.ca\n\nOur organization is just starting the deployment phase of a project to replace 3500 Windows 3.1 based workstations with Windows NT 4. Follow on phases of the program include replacing a mainframe based email system with Microsoft Exchange and replacing Novell servers in 17 branch offices with Windows NT server. In the initial replacement the file services will be replaced by NT file services. The print services will be replaced by Dazel. Subsequently we intend to replace the NT file services with DFS. This change should coincide with the deployment of Windows NT 5 in 1999.\n\nAt the same time we are deploying DCE on our 100 UNIX servers including IBM OS/390, AIX, HP-UX and Digital UNIX. We are also deploying Tivoli systems management framework products to manage the entire environment.\n\nThe program is slightly unusual in that we are taking a holistic approach to the entire computing infrastructure from the desktop to the enterprise class servers and attempting to provide a consistent environment for all of our applications while maintaining commercial environments that off the shelf applications can fully utilize.\n\nJEFFREY J.

With a few Novell Servers and UNIX Database Servers mix in. We have few Industrial PC's scattered around the production floor supported by Novell Servers and UNIX database servers. Our production Software applications are UNIX base and Win16 base that run on Industrial PC's under Microsoft Windows System. We have started replacing our Novell Servers with Microsoft Windows NT Server Systems. We decided to migrate our Win16 Applications to Win32 Applications. Along with this we are migrating towards OLE Servers and more use of Visual Basic from Microsoft. This has placed more demand for Windows NT Servers and Loading Windows NT operating systems on our industrial PC's. Most all of our Software Application are heavily LAN based using our own TCP/IP base CIM Sockets for Communication. With this we will be changing to ClearCase for Software Revision Control. Also, we will be centralizing our PLC State and Latter Code Software Servers. We use a lot NFS Mounting for backup production Servers which speed up network communication and allows us to Ninstall to our production servers if one of them gets it's data or application corrupted to restore the computer to proper running order. While we are rolling out new production lines alone with working to accomplish our migration goals and retrofit existing lines to meet our migration goals. This must take place with minimum production disruption and keeping our LAN Structure intact.\n\nSo we need to develop our Windows NT expertise to accomplish these goals stated above. Especially get into Windows NT System operating System inter- action with network, so we can integrate it into our LAN Structure. We also need to have better understanding of application development done on Windows NT and more about that process. With this we need to know Windows NT version development path so our migration plans do not run into a dead end. We will also explore better ways to integrate our Windows NT Servers with our UNIX Database Servers. we are also interested in Windows NT operating System Real Time response and ways of influencing it.\n\nOur general focus is on providing production Software applications and support for the same on mixed set of controllers and servers. This can range from UNIX database and application servers, UNIX production line controllers, Novell servers, some NT Servers communicating across LAN to Industrial Windows PC and X-terminals. We are migrating towards Win32 Application Windows NT PC's. We are also concerned about fitting the New Windows NT PC's into are mixed Network setup. Most of are present Software applications are network based. So, fitting NT Windows Operating System into this is also a concern.\n\nWe will also be centralizing our PLC State and Latter Code Software Servers. We will be migrating towards OLE Server and Visual Basic code development Servers. With this we will be changing to ClearCase for Software Revision Control.

A top priority issue is the accommodation of a wide variety of required functionality (and accompanying user skill levels), ranging from simple administrative tasks to the full flexibility typically expected on research stations. The first batch of desktop systems on which Windows NT will be deployed numbers around 600 stations.\n\nAdditionally, a couple of educational labs - for a total of 200 stations - open to students will be running NT shortly. This environment will be integrated closely enough as to allow teachers preparing classes to use any workstation while retaining access to -- and consistent views of -- the resources available in the labs.\n\nCentral in this effort is the deployment of a uniform installation and operations model. This model must ensure basic connectivity to both \"tightly coupled\" LAN services and a more loosely defined (and typically far more diverse) set of information services maintained by other departments. Also, the model should facilitate the lightest possible load on helpdesk personnel, by automating installations of commonly used applications and providing strict guide-lines for installing not-so-common applications, in conjunction with applying appropriate file protection measures.\n\nSTEVE LAMMERT\n\nSteve_Lammert@transarc.com\n\nMember of Technical Staff\n\nTransarc Corp\n\nGulf Tower\n\nPittsburgh PA 15219\n\nVoice: +1-412-338-4443\n\nFAX: +1-412-338-4404\n\nThe computing environment in the early years of our company was completely UNIX-based. Back then, the unifying principle of workstation administration was our own AFS distributed file system and its Kerberos-based authentication method, which gave us \"single sign-on\", single-point user administration, file system security, and easier workstation administration (e.g. exclusively \"dataless\" workstation).\n\nIn the past three years, the Windows presence here has grown from a few isolated porting groups and rapid-prototyping efforts into a major new platform for development, delivery, and customer support. While we have had some success integrating NT into the existing environment (e.g. building products from a single source tree on both NT and UNIX, using our AFS NT client), other aspects of our internal PC growth has not been as well-planned.\n\nI am new to the NT world, both as a user and an administrator, and have great interest in how existing large sites deal with: NT user administration, especially single sign-on in a heterogeneous environment; workstation administration, especially remote and/or network installation of operating systems and applications; help desk issues, e.g. remote debugging of user problems; and backup. In other words, I expect to be doing more listening than talking.\n\nLARS H LARSSON\n\nSenior Research Eng.\n\nEHS/GS System Laboratory\n\nEricsson Hewlett-Packard Telecommunications AB\n\nPO Box 333, S-431 24 MOLNDAL, Sweden,\n\nPhone: +46-31-7462141\n\nFax: +46-31-7462406\n\nehslhl@aom.ericsson.se\n\nEHPT is a joint venture between Ericsson and Hewlett-Packard developing telecom management systems.

Wherever the password is changed, this change is automatically and quickly propagated to all systems, whether they are UNIX or Microsoft. This MUST apply to all vendor implementations of UNIX, including SGI & Linux. Last time I looked, TransArc's Kerberos implementation did not address either.\n\nFile IDs and file system exports\n\nThe identity of the user who owns or is allowed access to files or other filesystem objects within a system must be one-to-one mappable between systems, if the IDs are not identical.\n\nProvision of a specific single application from an NT server to an arbitrary X capable display without foisting the entire \"desktop\" upon the display as well.\n\nRealTime LoadBalancing (as well as batch/queuing) must be available for these X capable applications to be provided to any X capable display.\n\nPrinting and Mail services are currently provided for to the NT base through my UNIX environment, but I'd like to see how effectively the NT environment can provide for the UNIX environment.\n\nThe main research topics I'm pursuing are:\n\n* Providing single applications without the desktop environment to an X-based display, whatever this may be.\n\n* Strength/weakness of alternatives in eliminating the \"drive centric\" filesystem layout of native Microsoft OS's into a tree-structured AFS/NFS/UNIX representation.\n\n* Integration of voice recognition interfaces into an application.\n\n* Providing LoadBalanced anonymous Compute and Interactive Application Servers to a heterogeneous, embedded control software development community.\n\n* Routing behaviour in a large campus environment with multiple interfaces in a single machine, and multiple machines with single interfaces masquerading under the same name.

There are two areas of relevant focus:\n\nNT on cc-NUMA\n\nThe Sequent Symmetry product line has been based upon a Symmetrical Multi-Processor (SMP) architecture (2-32 processors) leveraging commodity components (e.g., Intel Pentium CPUs). These systems were delivered with a Sequent-developed scaleable UNIX, DYNIX/ptx.\n\nLast year, Sequent introduced a new product line called the NUMA-Q 2000. In contrast to a large bus SMP architecture, the NUMA-Q 2000 is a scaleable hardware product based upon a Pentium Pro cache-coherent Non Uniform Memory Architecture (cc-NUMA) using a 4-processor building block. Dynix/ptx was modified and enhanced to efficiently support the NUMA-Q 2000 architecture. NT scalability and performance is being investigated with respect to cc-NUMA architectures. Of particular concern are issues of I/O distribution and scheduling, memory management, and processor allocation.\n\nMixed NT and UNIX (DYNIX/ptx)\n\nHeterogeneous environments raise issues of system management, resource sharing, and system control. The range of tools and products in both environments is constantly growing which creates a challenge in delivering customer oriented management and control capabilities.

Box 430\n\nBellaire, Tx 77402\n\n713 432 3174\n\nmeierld@texaco.com\n\nTexaco has been migrating from an environment with 14 email systems and 3 network operating systems to an environment with Microsoft Exchange and Windows NT as the network operating system. We have been engaged in this work since the 3.5 time frame, and have developed a modified domain model. In addition we have uncovered some of the problems in making NT work in an world wide fashion with one account everywhere.\n\nIn addition we are deploying NT workstation in several locations on our desktops. We have currently over 400 servers, and have mostly completed the migrations. We are concerned about a uniform infrastructure that includes telecommunications challenged Parts of the world as well as areas that are well endowed with good telecommunications.\n\nPRAVEEN MOGILI\n\nAssociate In Computer Applications\n\nCollege Of Engineering, University of South Florida\n\n4202 E Fowler Ave., ENB 118, Tampa FL 33620.\n\nPhone : 813-974-4106\n\nFax : 813-974-4464\n\ne-mail : mogili@eng.usf.edu\n\nURL : https://io.eng.usf.edu\n\nWe are currently using NT based systems primarily as file servers with a plan to implement other services like printing, web and databases. Our research is primarily focused on integrating the NT systems in to our existing UNIX based software systems. Some of the projects include:\n\n1) Developing a Global Authentication System (logins)\n\n2) Integrating UNIX and Windows NT Printing (accounting, quota)\n\n3) Porting\n\na) UNIX system administration scripts\n\nb) UNIX database applications\n\n4) Distributed Applications (CORBA, DCOM, Java, ActiveX)\n\nARCH MOTT\n\narch@cisco.com\n\nCisco Systems, Inc.\n\n170 West Tasman Drive\n\nSan Jose, CA 95134\n\nVoice:(408)526-4485\n\nFAX:(408)526-4575\n\nAs is the case with many other businesses that used to have engineering departments dominated by UNIX computing, Cisco systems is faced with a burgeoning NT user community, seemingly driven mostly by management, rather than technical, direction. Issues we need to address include sharing resources to avoid duplication, centralizing user administration and allowing centralized administration and monitoring of system and network security.\n\nMIKE MURPHY\n\nPhone: (619)-537-3218 Fax:(619)-695-9501\n\nMike Murphy <mmurphy@hdssd.hitachi.com>\n\nI currently use UNIX and NT workstations to teach installation and configuration of Hitachi RAID devices connected via SCSI interfaces. Classically, I have always used UNIX stations and now delving into the NT world with a heterogeneous network connecting them all together.\n\nThe areas I would like to pursue would be in the area of setting up homogeneous user account domains that would work across all the platforms if that is feasible (NIS type). Also, being able to use some form of the mount command (both locally and remotely) if it exists on NT in order to administer and control these large RAID devices for failover and filesharing.\n\nIf anyone has had success along these lines I would like to chat about it.\n\nRODNEY NELSON\n\nHewlett - Packard\n\nVancouver Div.\n\nrodney_nelson@hp.com\n\nThe information that would be most useful will be managing NT in a large-scale network executing automated stations unattended. We are in the processes of porting a UNIX environment to NT for our LAN test and data collection applications. NT appears to be an attractive platform for data dissimulation to management personnel for real time information. There are some issues with porting UNIX to NT that need to be clarified. Also, security and viruses are concerns associated with this migration.\n\nI understand that most of the NT environment is already in place and I am very interested in NT 5. I have the understanding that there are significant changes to sections of the operating system.\n\nSTEVE NELSON\n\nnelson@bv.com\n\n(913)458-2445\n\nUnix Sys Admin\n\nBlack & Veatch\n\n11401 Lamar\n\nOverland Park, KS 66211\n\nI am not in the process of directly doing anything with NT, and hope not to be put into that untenable position in the foreseeable future. My attendance at this conference is more along the lines of learning what NT can do to our systems and networks and how to prevent any problems that it may cause.\n\nOur company is in the process of 'standardizing' on pc's. During the process we have found that there is no such thing as a 'standard' pc. Therefore, we are trying to figure out the best methods to allow for all the variants and incorporate them into our existing server/network structure. In addition, we are trying to find/develop support tools to minimize desktop administration headaches.\n\nI have promised the local zealots to be open-minded and will try to extract un-biased, useful information.\n\nBRYAN NEWCASTLE\n\nWhirlpool Corporation\n\n303 Upton Drive M/D 0204\n\nAttn: Bryan Newcastle\n\nSt. Joseph, MI 49085\n\nBryan_J_Newcastle@email.whirlpool.com\n\nPhone: (616) 923-6073\n\nFax: (616) 923-6117\n\nAt my site, I am attempting to make my customers' lives easier by providing an integrated CAD/email/electronic tools environment. Right now, the CAD is all done on a UNIX workstation using Pro/Engineer, with all of the other tasks like email and MS-Word/Excel/PowerPoint done on a PC. The current focus is to move all of this functionality onto one box in order to free up desk space, and more importantly, reduce the number of machines that must be purchased.\n\nWe have looked at both using an NT product via X-windows or other forms on the UNIX workstation, and also changing to only use PCs, as they are Initially more cost-effective. Issues for the NT side of things are integration issues and software distribution issues (as the NT stations do not have to stay on at all times).\n\nCAMERON NINHAM\n\nNational Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)\n\nUniversity of Illinois\n\n152 Computing Applications Building\n\n605 E.
