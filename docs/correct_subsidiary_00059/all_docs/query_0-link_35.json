        "text": "Sequent Computer Systems says that the price/performance of its NUMA-Q 1000 and NUMA-Q 2000 Unix server lines has improved by 50% after the introduction of new Intel Pentium III Xeon-based systems, combined with its new competitive prices.\n\n\"We have partnered closely with Fundamental to bring this IBM environment to NUMA-Q.\"\n\n\"FLEX-ES running on Sequent NUMA-Q servers represents the new data center option for running S/390 cycles, with an important role to play in data center migration, consolidation, and Y2K compliance.\"\n\nCompaq Computer Corp says it isn't worried by the IBM Corp- Sequent Computer Systems Inc merger earlier this week as the performance of its own version of NUMA technology, code-named PUMA (Practically Uniform Memory Access) leaves Sequent's NUMA-Q standing.\n\nThose figures compare to a local memory latency of around 180 nanoseconds for Sequent's NUMA-Q systems.\n\nThe NUMA-Q 1000 series, which consists of servers based on either four or eight of Intel's Pentium II Xeon processors, runs on the Unix system but can also be re- deployed to run on Microsoft's Windows NT system.\n\nThe company has been telling Wall Street that its new mid-range NUMA-Q 1000 server has made it more competitive with Sun Microsystems Inc.\n\nTELECOMWORLDWIRE-(C) 1994-8 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD Sequent Computer Systems Inc has launched its second- generation NUMA-Q 2000 data centre servers.\n\nThe NUMA-Q 2000 servers with Pentium II Xeon processors are available immediately with prices starting at US$200,000.\n\nSequent Computer Systems Inc duly unveiled its new 'Scorpion' mid-range eight-way Unix servers as the NUMA-Q 1000 line, hoping the new configurations will cut it a new high-volume revenue stream from sales of systems which cost less than $1m (CI No 3,460).\n\nIts 64-way Intel Xeon-based NUMA-Q 2000 achieved a power throughput performance of 27,441 at $756."
