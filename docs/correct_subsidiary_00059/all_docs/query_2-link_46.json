        "text": "\"The success of the UNIX system stems from its tasteful selection of a few key ideas and their elegant implementation. The model of the UNIX system has led a generation of software designers to new ways of thinking about programming. The genius of the UNIX system is its framework, which enables programmers to stand on the work of others.\"\n\nCitation from the 1983 ACM Turing Award presented to Kenneth Thompson and Dennis Ritchie\n\n\"The Swiss Army Knife of Software.\"\n\n\"Some consider UNIX to be the second most important invention to come out of AT&T Bell Labs after the transistor.\"\n\n\"UNIX is simple and coherent, but it takes a genius (or at any rate a programmer) to understand and appreciate the simplicity.\"\n\nDennis Ritchie\n\nA nice timeline diagram, showing the evolution of the various Unix variants, is available at �ric L�v�nez's UNIX History.\n\n1949\n\nThe Antitrust Department of the Department of Justice of the US Government sues Western Electric and AT&T for restraint of trade. Western Electric was a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T and that Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL or Bell Labs) was jointly owned by Western Electric and AT&T (50% each). The consent decree required that AT&T license use of all its patents at nominal fees, which laid the groundwork for subsequent licensing of UNIX to universities.\n\n1956\n\nAT&T enters into \"consent decree\" with US government and agrees to restrict its business to furnishing \"common carrier communications services\", which keeps it out of the computer business.\n\n1957\n\nBill Norris starts Control Data Corporation (CDC).\n\n1965\n\nAT&T, GE, IBM and Project MAC at MIT join together to develop the time-sharing system MULTICS (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service).\n\n1966\n\nKen Thompson finishes studies at University of California at Berkeley (UCB) and joins technical staff at AT&T Bell Telephone Laboratories to work on MULTICS.\n\n1968\n\nDennis Ritchie completes work on his doctorate at Harvard and joins Bell Labs to work on MULTICS project.\n\n1969\n\nAT&T Bell Labs drops out of MULTICS project. A system which was supposed to support 1000 on line users can barely handle three. Out of the ashes grows the most influential operating system in history.\n\nThompson gets an idea for a new type of file system and hashes out his ideas with Ritchie and Rudd Canaday.\n\nThompson writes first version of UNICS for PDP-7 in one month while wife is on vacation. He allocates one week each to the operating system functions: the kernel, the shell, the editor, and the assembler. He does this on a machine with 4K of 18 bit words. UNICS is pun on MULTICS and stands for Uniplexed Information and Computing Services. Name is changed to UNIX which is not an acronym. This version is in assembly language.\n\nThompson develops the interpretive language B based upon BCPL. Ritchie improved on \"B\" and called it \"C\"\n\n1970\n\nDEC begins shipping PDP-11 and revolutionizes the computer industry by selling 250,000 systems.\n\nBell Labs gets a PDP-11 to do text processing for the legal department. System is developed and implemented in UNIX. The standard DEC OS is never installed.\n\n1971\n\nThe First Edition of UNIX manual is written.\n\n1972\n\nUNIX OS is rewritten in C which opened the door for porting.\n\n1973\n\nFirst UNIX development support group is formed in Bell Labs.\n\nPipes are invented with the Third Edition of UNIX and the UNIX philosophy begins to emerge:\n\nWrite programs that do one thing and do it well.\n\nWrite programs that work together\n\nWrite programs that handle text streams, because that is the universal interface.\n\nThompson delivers first UNIX paper at the ACM Symposium on Operating Systems at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, NY. Within six months, the number of UNIX sites triples from 16 to 48.\n\n1974\n\nThe UNIX Time-Sharing System is published in CACM by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. It is a revision of the 1973 paper.\n\nUniversity of California at Berkeley (UCB) gets Version 4 of UNIX.\n\nKeith Standiford converts UNIX to PDP 11/45.\n\nBerkeley begins making major enhancements to UNIX and sets the stage for becoming a major distribution center for their version of UNIX.\n\nThe Elements of Programming Style by Kernighan and Plauger is published.\n\n1975\n\nThompson begins one year sabbatical at Berkeley.\n\nAT&T officially begins licensing UNIX to universities.\n\n1976\n\nBoggs and Metcalfe invent Ethernet at Xerox in Palo Alto.\n\n1978\n\nBill Joy produces first Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) of UNIX.\n\nRitchie and Steve Johnson complete first port of UNIX to an Interdata 8/32, the first non-DEC computer to run UNIX. Note that this is nearly ten years after running only on DEC equipment.\n\nUNIX is ported to a DEC VAX, but not by Thompson and Ritchie, since they had become disenchanted by DEC and its unwillingness to support UNIX. DEC's refusal to support UNIX must be one of the all time great blunders of the computer industry.\n\nThe C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie is published.\n\nDoug and Larry Michels start Santa Cruz Operations, Inc. (SCO) to sell UNIX on a PC. By 1992, they grow to $175 million in revenues.\n\n1979\n\nSeventh Edition UNIX PROGRAMMERS MANUAL (UNIX Version 7) is published. It is the first edition without Thompson's or Ritchie's names. It is titled \"UNIX (with a TM sign) Time-Sharing System.\" Bell Labs starts to protect its assets.\n\nMicrosoft licenses UNIX from AT&T and announces XENIX, which is soon overshadowed by MS-DOS.\n\n1980\n\nBSD UNIX finds its way back into Bell Labs as a new improved version.\n\nBerkeley lands large DARPA contract and forms Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG).\n\nSCO becomes a distributor for Microsoft XENIX and licenses the name XENIX because they sold their trade name DYNIX to Sequent.\n\n1981\n\nThe IBM PC is released running Microsoft DOS; XENIX is pushed into the background.\n\n1982\n\nAT&T announces official support for UNIX and makes its first commercial release: UNIX System III.\n\nBill Joy, the inspiration behind BSD, leaves CSRG at Berkeley to co-found Sun Microsystems.\n\nSun gets its name from the Stanford University Network (SUN) board. The workstation is based on the Motorola 68000 chip running SunOS based on 4.2BSD. It includes an optional local area network based on Ethernet.

The press refers to them as BISON.\n\nAndrew Tanenbaum writes the first version of Minix, a Unix intended for educational purposes.\n\nApple releases the Macintosh.\n\n1985\n\nAT&T publishes the System V Interface Definition (SVID) in an attempt to standardize the UNIX interfaces, which was strongly influenced by the 1984 /usr/group standard.\n\nThe ISO introduced the POSIX standard.\n\n1986\n\nIBM releases AIX.\n\n1988\n\nAT&T BUYS 20% OF SUN MICROSYSTEMS, and the battle lines are formed.\n\nIBM, DEC, HP, and others form Open Software Foundation (OSF) to compete with the AT&T/Sun alliance. They decide to use the AIX Kernel.\n\nUNIX International (UI) is formed in response to OSF as an international consortium of System V UNIX users to work closely with AT&T to promote open systems and influence future development.\n\nNeXT computer selects Mach Kernel for its NeXTStep OS.\n\nDavid Cutler leaves DEC and joins Microsoft (October 31) to develop Windows NT.\n\nMicrosoft begins evaluating the Mach Kernel.\n\nHP releases HP/UX.\n\n1989\n\nThe C programming language is standardized by ANSI as X3.159.1989 which became an international standard ISO/IEC 9899:1990.\n\nHP becomes the second largest supplier of UNIX based workstations by acquiring Apollo.\n\nSCO is short of cash, and Microsoft, along with other investors, puts $25 million into SCO in exchange for 16% of the stock.\n\n1990\n\nOSF designates the Mach 3.0 Kernel from Carnegie-Mellon University as their choice for their version of UNIX, OSF/1.\n\nMotif is released by OSF.\n\nUNIX International releases SVR4 which is a unification of System V, BSD, and XENIX.\n\nX/Open releases XPG3.\n\n1991\n\nAT&T incorporates UNIX System Laboratories (USL) with Novell, Amdahl, Fujitsu, Sun, Motorola, ICL, Olivetti, NEC, OKI Electric, III of Taiwan, and Toshiba.\n\nSun creates the SunSoft subsidiary and announces Solaris.\n\nA finnish student at the University of Helsinki, Linus Torvalds, learns of Minix, and writes a kernel based on it.

It differs from the previous version for just three files among 18,000.\n\nSunSoft, AT&T GIS, Novell, and Fujitsu pay $1 million to join OSF. This is primarily in recognition of the threat from Microsoft and the need to further standardize.\n\nRedHat is founded.\n\nLinux 1.0 is released.\n\nFirst Beowulf cluster at NASA.\n\n1995\n\n4.4BSD-Lite Release 2 is released and CSRG is disbanded at Berkeley (June 1995).
