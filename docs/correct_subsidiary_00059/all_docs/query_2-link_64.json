        "text": "Anne & Lynn Wheeler\n\nPost by Phil Payne\n\nREAD what the article says - 7,000 zSeries MIPS have been replaced\n\nby just TWO HP Superdomes. This is not in any way a vote against\n\nmainframe concepts. It may be that their 7,000 MIPS was on more\n\nthan two zSeries - but in any case this decision is very much a vote\n\nfor mainframes and their underlying advantages.\n\nfrom not quite so long ago and far away??\n\nFrom: ***@WORLDNET.ATT.NET (Edward Gould)\n\nSubject: HP to compete with S/390\n\nNewsgroups: bit.listserv.ibm-main\n\nDate: 12 Sep 2000 13:52:18 -0700\n\nHewlett-Packard will face the S/390 head on when it unveils today its\n\nnew Superdome computer in a bid to up its standing in the lucrative\n\nUnix server market. HP is expected to position Superdome with a host\n\nof \"e-services\" to appeal to customers wishing to link business\n\noperations housed on different servers, something it says IBM is\n\nunwilling to do with its Unix servers lest it undermine sales of its\n\nS/390 mainframe line.\n\n\"HP hopes to unseat mainframe with Superdome\"\n\nhttp://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-2757613.html?tag=st.ne.1003.\n\n... snip ...\n\npre-itanium\n\npart of the issue had been that HP had acquired Convex. Convex had\n\ndone the scalable Examplar using \"64-port\" sci memory coherent with\n\ntwo hp pa-risc chips/board (128 chips, processor in numa\n\nconfiguration).\n\nmy understanding from the hp engineers was that superdome would be\n\nsomewhat smaller and more efficient (to implement, 32 processors) box\n\nthat they would move into the (convex) examplar customer segment\n\n... as well as moving out into the more commercial world.\n\nalso from 9/12/2000 (same as the referenced item).\n\nHP thinks big with Superdome servers\n\nhttp://news.com.com/2100-1001-245591.html\n\ninitially announced with 32 processors but with promise of 64\n\nprocessors to come soon. also promised being able to upgrade to\n\nitanium ... except itanium hadn't seen any update (late 90s had\n\nvarious of the 370/390 software emulators thinking itanium would offer\n\nsignificant emulation thruput).\n\none of your articles:\n\nhttp://www.isham-research.co.uk/platslns4.html\n\nthere is possible more progress now going on with itanium-2.\n\nthere is some comment about ibm being wary of pushing ibm's\n\ncompetitive unix offerings too hard with commercial customers because\n\nit might take market away from traditional mainframes.\n\nfrom 7/8/2002 ...\n\nHP touts advantages of Itanium 2\n\nhttp://news.com.com/HP+touts+advantages+of+Itanium+2/2100-1001_3-942252.html\n\n...\n\ncurrent superdome page\n\nhttp://www.hp.com/products1/servers/scalableservers/superdome/index.html\n\nvarious benchmarks\n\nhttp://www.hp.com/products1/servers/scalableservers/superdome/index.html\n\n64-way pa-risc superdome specint (june 2002)\n\nhttp://www.spec.org/cpu2000/results/res2002q3/cpu2000-20020715-01481.html\n\ntpc-c\n\nhttp://www.tpc.org/tpcc/results/tpcc_perf_results.asp\n\nabove lists superdome as 4th ... with ibm (non-mainframes) holding top\n\nthree positions.\n\nand a few additional historical oriented posts involving mainframe,\n\n801, risk, and itanium tie-ins (there used to be a joke that\n\nthere were actually only 200 people in the business):\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2006.html#39 What happens if CR's are directly changed?\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2006e.html#1 About TLB in lower-level caches\n\nhttp://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2006p.html#42 old hypervisor email"
