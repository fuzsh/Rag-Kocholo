        "text": "Need more computing power? Scale up with nonuniform memory access --- and get lower costs. But there's a big (blue) skeptic.\n\nBy Doug Bartholomew\n\nONE OF THE HOTTEST trends in business computing today is something called NUMA.\n\nDespite what you might imagine from the name, NUMA is not a 30-foot-tall stone idol worshipped by a tribe of South Sea islanders. Rather, NUMA- an acronym for nonuniform memory access-represents a new method of accessing data that promises to lower the cost of information processing.\n\n\"NUMA is really bringing the commodity business model up into the data center,\" says Peter Slavid, manager of business strategy for high-performance systems at ICL, a UK-based division of Fujitsu Group that is building NUMA technology into its next generation of mainframes. \"We think that's going to be very attractive.\"\n\nBesides lower cost, NUMA offers faster performance. That's important in an era when the average corporate data system-similar to the football team that constantly comes up a couple of feet short on fourth down-always seems to be short of processing power.\n\n\"Every year we ask if we have enough computing power, but we never seem to have enough,\" observes Jonathan Eunice, an analyst at Illuminata, a Nashua, N.H., technology-research firm. Adds Kevin Joyce, a product-marketing director at Sequent Computer Systems Inc., a Beaverton, Oreg., manufacturer of a line of servers called NUMA-Q that was introduced Nov. 4, \"The companies that are going for NUMA machines early on are those that have topped out- they have nowhere else to go.\"\n\nWhy more computing power? Plain and simple, a host of new business needs are placing added burdens on data centers, causing once-thorough-bred systems to behave like sway-backed mares. Activities such as real- time ordering of products and tracking orders through production tend to consume significantly more computing power than simple weekly or monthly batch processing. The problem is compounded by a passel of other information-based chores, many of which didn't exist half a dozen years ago. These include data mining and online transaction processing, e-mail, the Internet, and electronic data interchange.\n\n\"One thing that is consistent across all manufacturing industries is that people are looking to do more, such as warehousing of information and video imaging,\" says Dave Richards, vice president of information technology at Rockford Corp., a $100 million-plus manufacturer of audio systems in Tempe, Ariz. \"Manufacturers need the hardware and software platforms to support this expanded informational base.\"\n\nIn the old days-say, five years ago- upgrading to get greater data-processing punch meant replacing mainframes-trading in an IBM 3090 and moving up to an ES/9000, for example.\n\nBut today, with many companies having replaced some or all of their mainframes in favor of networks of servers connected to desktop machines, upgrading systems isn't so routine. Regardless of system size, though, the same bottomline rules apply-users want systems that are faster, better, and cheaper.\n\nUntil recently, most UNIX-based hardware manufacturers offered symmetric multiprocessors (SMP). These machines connect several microprocessors that share memory and access to data. SMP, the most common way larger systems are built, works with thousands of packaged software applications.\n\nUnfortunately, when more than about 16 processors are coupled, problems develop that impinge on performance-i.e., response times. What's more, the complex interconnections required to fix the problem make systems with more than 16 microprocessors economically unfeasible. \"It's too expensive to build a true SMP system bigger than about eight processors,\" says Phil Gerskovich, vice president and head of Data General Corp.'s (DG) NUMALiiNE computers. \"The SMP model is too expensive to scale up.\"\n\nScalability-the ability of a system to expand as business needs grow-is critical. Most users prefer the ease and economy of sticking with the same hardware and software. The alternative, stepping up to a massively parallel processing (MPP) system, is expensive, requiring specially adapted software applications.\n\nThat's where NUMA comes in. \"NUMA allows you to continue to scale up your SMP systems,\" Gerskovich explains. With NUMA, the microprocessors don't care where the memory is stored. This means that dozens or even hundreds of processors can be strung together.\n\nDG's NUMALiiNE, for instance, to be available in 1997's first quarter, will allow multiple machines to be linked so that hundreds of processors yield the power of a massively parallel system. At the same time, it will continue to run most existing software applications, including standard database management systems, built for the SMP platform. Avoiding the special programming needed for larger systems saves time and reduces costs.\n\nA key feature of NUMA hardware is multiple input/output paths. Systems depending on a heavy volume of information flowing back and forth are less likely to suffer a bottleneck that slows performance. \"For us, it's critical that we have a high-performance server, because we're looking to establish a \"Web Storeâ€™ to offer our products,\" Richards says. \"We don't want customers sitting there looking at a monitor and waiting a long time for a response when they make an order.\"\n\nMost vendors of UNIX-based hardware-such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HP), Silicon Graphics Inc., Digital Equipment Corp., and NCR Corp.-either already offer or will soon bring out their versions of NUMA machines. \"We are shipping NUMA machines now, and we plan to ship a lot more soon,\" says Sequent's Joyce. NCR is offering eight-processor WorIdMark 4300 mid- range servers with NUMA under the new OctaSCALE product name.\n\nHP already has about 200 customers using NUMA-type systems provided by its Convex division, the former Convex Computer Corp. Another 30-plus customers are waiting for HP's new generation of NUMA machines expected to go into production this month. \"These machines are easy to program and scale to lots of processors at an attractive price,\" says Bob Masson, product manager in HP's technical-computing business unit.\n\nFUJITSU'S ICL IS incorporating DG's NUMALiiNE technology into its next generation of hardware, due out in the second quarter. \"The beauty of it is that it uses standard Intel technology and the Unixware operating system,\" says ICL's Slavid.\n\nUnixware, a popular version of the UNIX operating system marketed by the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), a California-based software firm, is employed by about 40% of the UNIX servers in use today. SCO is giving it a remake, called Gemini, that will incorporate features designed to take advantage of NUMA.\n\nDespite its cost and performance advantages, not all computer manufacturers have bought into NUMA. One notable holdout is IBM Corp., which last year sold more than $4 billion worth of its RS/6000 servers. Big Blue will continue to use SMP systems for the low end and depend on its clustering approach-tying together large numbers of multiprocessor-machines into MPP systems- for more compute-intensive applications.\n\n\"We're going to continue to improve our SMP technology,\" says Mark Dean, vice president and IBM Fellow for the RS/6000 business in Austin. \"Near-term, NUMA is not a major part of our product plan.\"\n\nIBM, in fact, is downright skeptical of NUMA. \"Today, most of the NUMA machines are first-generation, and you can't find the support you need, in databases, compilers, or tools, Dean adds. \"There are a lot of problems with NUMA today,\" he says, pointing out that, for example, \"NUMA machines will never provide you with the high availability a cluster will provide.\"\n\nAlthough it's true that NUMA-based SMP systems are not designed specifically for high availability, \"That statement alone doesn't give you the total picture,\" says analyst Eunice. Most NUMA vendors plan to get around the availability problem by providing other components to ensure availability of data when a component in the s stem fails, he says. \"The typical nonuniform SMP system will have all sorts of redundancy built in.\"\n\nThe fact that there are few software- development tools for NUMA systems is exactly the point, Eunice instructs. \"It's the whole point of this approach to computing not to need specific developmental tools, because these systems will be able to work with most popular databases, such as Oracle 7, Informix, or Sybase. The whole point is that you can use the standard software.\"\n\nDespite its detractors, most observers believe NUMA is going to make a big splash in corporate networks. Notes Larry Smarr, director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, \"NUMA is here to stay.\"\n\nIW JANUARY 1997"
