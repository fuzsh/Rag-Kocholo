The third major (Dynix 3.0) version was released May, 1987;[2] by 1992 DYNIX was succeeded by DYNIX/ptx,[3] which was based on UNIX System V.[4]\n\nIBM obtained rights to DYNIX/ptx in 1999, when it acquired Sequent[5] for $810 million.[6]\n\nIBM's subsequent Project Monterey was an attempt, circa 1999, \"to unify AIX with Sequent's Dynix/ptx operating system and UnixWare.\" By 2001, however, \"the explosion in popularity of Linux ... prompted IBM to quietly ditch\" this.[7][8]"
