        "text": "IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Fastback (TSM FastBack) is a storage software solution that provides a continuous data protection and recovery management platform for Windows servers and applications that run on Windows, such as Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft SQL, Lotus Domino, Oracle, DB2, and others.\n\nProduct Details[]\n\nIBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack[]\n\nDesigned to provide a data protection and recovery solution for mission-critical applications, in the data center or remote branch offices, for enterprises and small businesses. TSM FastBack can eliminate traditional backup windows by continuously capturing data changes at the block level, with very minimal impact to the systems it helps protect. Its policy-based approach to data protection allows administrators to improve recovery service levels, specifically Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) based on the needs of the individual application or data type. TSM FastBack also provides a near instant restore capability that enables applications to be up and running within minutes after data recovery is initiated, while data recovery is performed in the background.\n\nIBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack for Microsoft Exchange[]\n\nExtends TSM FastBack protection capabilities by allowing quick and easy restore of individual Exchange objects such as e-mail messages and attachments, contact lists, calendars, tasks, journal entries, entire folders, and so forth. TSM FastBack for Microsoft Exchange uses a standard Windows-style GUI to help search for, select and restore the needed objects.\n\nIBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack for Bare Machine Recovery[]\n\nA solution for Windows that allows users to easily recover entire systems to a comparable server, to a new server with different hardware, or to a virtual machine (VMware or Microsoft Virtual Server). TSM FastBack for Bare Machine Recovery can also be used for server migration operations, and as a platform for business resilience for remote branch offices.\n\nIBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack Center[]\n\nCombines the three TSM FastBack products into a single package.\n\nFeatures[]\n\nIBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack\n\nContinuous data protection software with near-instant recovery for critical Windows applications.\n\nData changes are captured at the block level at the time of being written to disk. This eliminates the need for scheduled backups that take applications off-line for a period of time (the “backup window”).\n\nSchedule automated data transfers based on flexible, policy-based settings, helping administrators balance storage and bandwidth costs with data protection and retention requirements, on a per-application basis.\n\nEnable data asset recovery from any Windows application, including Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2 and SAP.\n\nMake the most effective use of available bandwidth with strategies such as multi-threading, bundling of small files and industry-standard compression.\n\nOperating systems supported: Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008\n\nIBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack for Microsoft Exchange\n\nRecover Exchange data from backup copies of the Exchange database (EDB) managed by TSM FastBack or Tivoli Storage Manager for Mail; and recover non-corrupt objects from a corrupt Exchange Database.\n\nGranular level recovery of any individual data object or group of objects, such as individual e-mail messages, contact lists, tasks, or calendar entries\n\nDrag-and-drop recovery can minimize downtime\n\nRecover objects that were previously considered unrecoverable—such as deleted e-mail messages, or address books lost due to synchronization errors\n\nRestore objects directly to an Exchange Server or to send objects to a user-defined destination via SMTP\n\nWorks with Active Directory and Exchange Server security to help limit unauthorized access to backup and restore systems\n\nOperating systems supported: Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008\n\nIBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack for Bare Machine Recovery\n\nEnables systems recovery following a disaster or catastrophic server failure\n\nProvides the flexibility of recovering to comparable hardware, to dissimilar hardware or to a virtual machine using VMware or Microsoft Virtual Server\n\nHelps protect remote or branch offices with a disaster recovery and business resiliency strategy that requires a minimum of standby hardware\n\nLeverages TSM FastBack to provide near-instant access to applications and data while full recovery takes place in the background\n\nFacilitates the migration of workloads to new hardware platforms, making it fast and easy to move workloads from old hardware or standalone servers to new hardware or blade servers\n\nEnables organizations to perform bare machine recovery in a local office, in a data center or in a central recovery site\n\nOperating systems supported: Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008\n\nIBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack Center\n\nProvide continuous and automatic data protection, enabling recovery from any point in time\n\nGet applications and users back up and running within minutes following a data loss, while full data recovery is performed in the background\n\nProvide complete bare machine recovery following a disaster or server failure, even to dissimilar hardware or to virtual machines\n\nRecover Microsoft Exchange data within minutes—from individual e-mail messages to entire folders or databases\n\nOperating systems supported: Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008\n\nSee also[]\n\nIBM\n\nTivoli Software\n\nIBM Tivoli Storage Manager\n\nIBM System Storage\n\n[]\n\nIBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack homepage\n\nIBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack for Microsoft Exchange homepage\n\nIBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack for Bare Machine Recovery homepage\n\nIBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack Center homepage\n\nIBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack Live Demo\n\nsimple:FastBack"
