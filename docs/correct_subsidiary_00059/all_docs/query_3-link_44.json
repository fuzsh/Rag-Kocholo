        "text": "Originally started by Herman Hollerith as the Tabulating Machine Company in 1896. The company was later part of a merge arranged by Charles R. Flint that merged the International Time Recording Company, Computing Scale Company, and the Tabulating Machine Company on June 16, 1911, as the C-T-R (Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company).\n\nIn 1924, C-T-R adopted the name IBM (International Business Machines). Today, IBM is one of the most well-known and successful computer companies in the world and is sometimes called Big Blue.\n\nTip\n\nAnyone who had worked at IBM is known as an IBMer.\n\nContact information\n\nNote\n\nToday, IBM is the manufacturer and developer of various computers, hardware products, software products, and services.
