        "text": "In some ways, German history is actually very young. There is a history of the area that corresponds roughly to the territory of Germany today, and a history of the area in which German is spoken. Some sense – though not a particularly pronounced one – of what it means to be German did evolve in the Middle Ages, yet the German Reich remained a collection of just a few large and many small principalities that were politically independent, at least theoretically – in 1650 there were around 360 of them. It was not until the nineteenth century that a widespread feeling of national belonging came about; this ultimately led to calls for a German nation state.\n\nHere is an overview of some key historical dates leading up to the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\n962 Otto I, Otto the Great\n\nThe coronation of Otto as emperor marked the start of the “Holy Roman Empire” ruled by German emperors who followed the traditions of the Ancient Roman Empire. Like that of the Carolingians, the Roman Empire had no capital, its rulers travelling constantly through the empire with their families and imperial household. They would normally reside in palaces built especially for this purpose, which served as the temporary seat of government.\n\n1493 Rise of the House of Habsburg\n\nThe regency of Maximilian I marked the start of the rise of the House of Habsburg. For centuries, it was one of the dominant noble dynasties in Central Europe, supplying most of the emperors and kings of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (thus named since the end of the 15th century) and, from 1504–1700, the kings of Spain. The Habsburgers are named after their family home, the small Castle of Habsburg in what today is the Swiss canton of Aargau.\n\n1618–1648 Thirty Years‘ War\n\nBoth a war of religion and a conflict between states, the Thirty Years‘ War ended with the Peace of Westphalia, which recognised the Catholic, Lutheran and Reformist faiths as being equal. The war, which saw alternating alliances between the emperor and the Catholic League, with the Protestant Union on the other side, destroyed large parts of Central Europe, and especially the “Holy Roman Empire”. In some parts of southern Germany up to two thirds of the population lost their lives.\n\n1740–1786 Frederick II, Frederick the Great\n\nDuring the reign of Frederick II of Prussia, an aesthete and military commander, Prussia rose to become a major European power. His rule is considered exemplary of the age of “enlightened absolutism”. At the same time, however, many people left their homeland. Encouraged by the rulers there, many Germans emigrated to the East in the second half of the eighteenth century: to Hungary, Romania and Russia.\n\n1848/49 March Revolution\n\nThe “German Revolution” began in the Grand Duchy of Baden. It quickly spilled over to the remaining states of the German Confederation and led to the first German national assembly, which met at St. Paul’s Church in Frankfurt. The crushing of the revolution, coupled with poverty and a lack of prospects, resulted in around one million Germans emigrating between 1850 and 1855, by far the majority to the USA.\n\n1914–1918 First World War\n\nEmperor William II isolated Germany in foreign policy terms and led it to the catastrophe of the First World War, which cost nearly 15 million lives. The Treaty of Versailles was signed in June 1919.\n\n1918 marked the end of the First World War. Facts and figures about the seminal catastrophe of the twentieth century.\n\n1918–1933 Weimar Republic\n\nOn 9 November, the Social Democrat Philipp Scheidemann declared the Republic and Emperor William II abdicated. Elections to the National Assembly were held on 19 January 1919. There was considerable opposition to the new Republic from the start, both from the right and from the left. Thanks to the support of the army and a large part of the business world, the right-wing enemies of democracy became ever stronger.\n\nFarewell to the German question: Looking back at the Weimar Republic from 1919 to 1933.\n\n1945 End of the Second World War\n\nThe surrender of the German Wehrmacht on 7/9 May 1945 marked the end of the Second World War in Europe, and with it a period of inconceivable suffering. The Allies divided Germany into four occupation zones and Berlin into four sectors.\n\n1948 Berlin blockade\n\nThe introduction of the deutschmark in the western occupation zones prompted the Soviet Union to block the access routes into West Berlin on 24 June 1948. The Allies responded by setting up an airlift to supply the population in West Berlin until September 1949.\n\n1949 Founding of the Federal Republic of Germany\n\nOn 23 May 1949, the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany was introduced. The first elections to the Bundestag – the country’s parliament – were held on 14 August. Konrad Adenauer (CDU) became chancellor. On 7 October 1949, the legal separation of East and West was completed when the constitution of the GDR entered into force. Germany’s separation only ended when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and Germany was reunified in 1990.\n\nAfter 1945, only one part of Germany had a chance to give democracy a second go, namely West Germany. https://www.deutschland.de/en/topic/politics/the-two-german-states\n\nInterested in Germany history after 1949?
