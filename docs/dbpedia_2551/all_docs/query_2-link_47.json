        "text": "27 Feb - 5 Mar 1933Reichstag Fire and Reichstag election: on 27 February the Reichstag building was set on fire. A Dutch communist, van der Lubbe, was caught red-handed in the burning building. Days later in the election 44 per cent of the population voted for the Nazis, who won 288 seats in the Reichstag â still not an overall majority. Hitler had to join with the nationalists to form a majority.Hitler used the fire to persuade Hindenburg to pass an emergency law restricting personal liberty. This enabled him to imprison many communist leaders, which stopped them campaigning during the election. Although the Nazis the did not gain the overall majority that Hitler had hoped for in the Reichstag, it gave them enough seats - after Hitler had arrested all the communist deputies and the other parties had been intimidated by the SA - to pass the Enabling Act.23 Mar 1933The Enabling Act: with the communist deputies banned and the SA intimidating all the remaining non-Nazi deputies, the Reichstag voted by the required two-thirds majority to give Hitler the right to make laws without the Reichstagâs approval for four years.Arguably this was the critical event during this period. It gave Hitler absolute power to make laws, which enabled him to destroy all opposition to his rule. This removed the Reichstag as a source of opposition.14 July 1933Political parties were banned: only the Nazi party was allowed to exist.Banning political parties made Germany a one-party state and destroyed democracy in the country. This removed other parties as a source of opposition.30 June 1934Night of the Long Knives: Many members of the SA, including its leader Ernst RÃ¶hm, were demanding that the Nazi party carry out its socialist agenda and that the SA take over the army. Hitler could not afford to annoy businessmen or the army, so the SS (Hitler's personal bodyguards) murdered around 400 members of the SA, including RÃ¶hm, along with a number of Hitler's other opponents like the previous Chancellor, von Schleicher.This destroyed all opposition to Hitler within the Nazi Party and gave power to the brutal SS. It also showed the rest of the world what a tyrant Hitler was. This removed any internal Nazi Party opposition to Hitler."
