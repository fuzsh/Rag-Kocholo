As a result of this, three million Germans found themselves now living in part of Czechoslovakia. When Adolf Hitler came to power, he wanted to unite all Germans into one nation.\n\nIn September 1938 he turned his attention to the three million Germans living in part of Czechoslovakia called the Sudetenland. Sudeten Germans began protests and provoked violence from the Czech police. Hitler claimed that 300 Sudeten Germans had been killed. This was not actually the case, but Hitler used it as an excuse to place German troops along the Czech border.\n\nDuring this situation, the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, flew to meet Hitler at his private mountain retreat in Berchtesgaden in an attempt to resolve the crisis. Use this lesson to explore documents concerning Chamberlain’s original meeting with Hitler and advice given to him at home in Britain.\n\nTasks\n\nBackground\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles, made in 1919 at the end of the First World War, was intended to make a lasting peace. Many people felt that the Treaty had caused terrible resentment in Germany on which Hitler had been able to play in order to achieve power. The government believed that Hitler and Germany had genuine grievances, but that if these could be met (‘appeased’) Hitler would be satisfied and become less demanding.\n\nHitler was open about his refusal to accept many of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Soon after he became Chancellor of Germany in 1933 he began to re-arm the country, breaking the restrictions placed on the German armed forces. In 1936, he sent German troops into the Rhineland and in March 1938 he joined Germany and Austria. Czechoslovakia was the logical next step for his aggression and German Nazis in the Sudetenland were told to stir up the trouble that led to the crisis examined here. Edvard Benes, the leader of Czechoslovakia, was concerned that if Germany was given the Sudetenland, most of the Czech defences would be handed over to the Germans and they would be left defenceless.\n\nChamberlain’s flight to Berchtesgaden was followed by another to Godesberg a week later and then another to Munich on 29 September. At Munich, Chamberlain got an international agreement that Hitler should have the Sudetenland in exchange for Germany making no further demands for land in Europe. Chamberlain said it was ‘Peace for our time’. Hitler said he had ‘No more territorial demands to make in Europe.’ On 1 October German troops occupied the Sudetenland: Hitler had got what he wanted without firing a shot.\n\nAlthough people in Britain were relieved that war had been averted, many now wondered if appeasement was the best decision. They did not think it would stop Hitler, and simply delayed the war, rather than prevented it. Even while Chamberlain was signing the Munich Agreement, he was agreeing a huge increase in spending to increase Britain’s armament in preparation for war. He must have known from the situation outlined to him by General Ismay, that Czechoslovakia was lost, that war was bound to come.\n\nSix months later, in March 1939, German troops took over the rest of Czechoslovakia. Poland seemed to be the next most likely victim of Nazi aggression and Chamberlain made an agreement with the Poles to defend them in Germany invaded. Hitler did not think Britain would go to war over Poland, having failed to do so over Czechoslovakia. He sent his soldiers into Poland in September 1939. Two days later, Britain declared war on Germany.\n\nChamberlain struggled on as Prime Minister until May 1940 when he resigned and Winston Churchill, a bitter critic of appeasement, took over. Chamberlain died in November 1940; however he continued to be vilified for appeasement in general and for his actions in September 1938 in particular long after his death and the conclusion of the war.\n\nTeachers' notes\n\nThis lesson has a video starter to hook students into the lesson.\n\nStudents examine extracts from a document written by letter written by Sir Nevile Meyrick Henderson, British Ambassador in Germany, 6th September 1938.\n\nThen, they analyse three extracts from the minutes of the conversation between Chamberlain and Hitler at Berchtesgaden. These provide insight in the arguments presented by both leaders on question of Sudetenland. What criticisms can be made of Chamberlain? His assessment of Hitler? His national self-centredness in his failure to consult with his allies and his readiness to sacrifice the Czechs?\n\nThe final source in the lesson is the conclusion of a secret note from General Ismay to the British Cabinet sent on 20th September 1938. Ismay was Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence. Students examine its contents to see what it reveals about the Government’s views concerning the German absorption of Czechoslovakia.\n\nIn the conclusion of the lesson, students are tasked to make their own assessment of Chamberlain’s appeasement policy over Sudetenland. Perhaps, it is important to make the point that the release documents that were previously deemed secret can add different perspectives to this issue.\n\nChamberlain was of the generation which survived but was deeply revolted by the First World War. Is it fair to criticise him for under-estimating Hitler? Students could try to construct the case for Chamberlain. Is this the same as a case for appeasement?\n\nAll sources are provided with transcripts. Students could work on the sources individually or pairs and report back to the group with their findings.\n\nSources\n\nImage: INF 3/46: Caricature of Neville Chamberlain by artist ‘Wooding’ for Ministry of Information, 1939-1946\n\nSource 1 : FO 371/21737 – Letter from Nevile Henderson, the German Ambassador\n\nSource 2a, b & c : FO 371/21738 – Chamberlain’s notes from his meeting with Hitler.\n\nSource 3 : CAB 21/544 – Report by General Ismay on the potential outcomes if Czechosolvakia is given to the Germans.\n\nExternal links\n\nThe Munich Agreement\n\nChurchill’s speech on the Munich Agreement.\n\nWhat’s the context? 30 September 1938: The Munich Agreement\n\nFind more on the context of the Munich agreement.\n\nThe Munich Agreement\n\nFind more documents relating to the Munich agreement in this blog from The National Archives.\n\nQuiz yourself on Adolf Hitler\n\nHow much do you know about Adolf Hitler and the rise of Nazism in Germany?\n\nConnections to curriculum\n\nKey stage 3\n\nChallenges for Britain, Europe and the wider world 1901 to the present day: the inter-war years: the Great Depression and the rise of dictators\n\nKey stage 4\n\nAQA GCSE History: Germany, 1890–1945: Democracy and dictatorship\n\nEdexcel GCSE History: c1900–present: Warfare and British society in modern era\n\nOCR GCSE History: War and British Society c.790 to c.2010; attitudes and responses to war\n\nBack to top"
