        "text": "Entire libraries have been filled with books attempting to explain how a once-homeless failed artist could have launched a war machine that eventually resulted in 60 million dead, and a death machine that killed 6 million in the Holocaust's gas chambers. More are certainly to come. The rise of the Nazis defies any simple narrative, coming as it did out of a myriad of interlacing events, ideologies and historical accidents.\n\nOne thing, however, is clear. Nazi Germany, and the flood of destruction it unleashed on Germany, Europe and the world, was far from inevitable.\n\nThe ill-fated Weimar Republic emerged from post-war chaos that verged on civil war. German soldiers, defeated on the battlefield, returned home only to be sent into skirmishes against communist revolutionaries. Right-wing monarchists and conservative anti-leftists in the military, judiciary and bureaucracy saw to it that little mercy was shown. Over 1,000 people were killed in the fighting, with Hitler's adopted home of Munich seeing a revolving door of bright red governments that only ended when a local paramilitary force combined forces with a federal army unit to brutally put down the red threat. A number of future Nazis took part in the slaughter, and the political climate in Germany remained poisoned for years.\n\nWary of Democracy\n\nThere is no denying that Hitler was a gifted speaker. But without the fatal weaknesses in Germany's political leadership, it is difficult to see how he would have made it to the top. President von Hindenburg had never been terribly convinced that democracy was the way to go. Indeed, the World War I hero and his supporters had long yearned for a strong leader free from parliamentary meddling -- and they were especially wary of the Social Democrats, the one party that had thrown all of its support behind the Weimar democracy from the beginning.\n\nVon Hindenburg's skepticism of parliamentary democracy was shared by many in German society, especially in heavy industry and among the country's powerful farming sector. It came as no surprise when, the SPD government of Chancellor Hermann Müller having collapsed, von Hindenburg appointed nationalist Heinrich Brüning in his place in March 1930. The left side of the political spectrum was in no shape to prevent it -- the communists seemed just as eager to see the end of Weimar as the radical right was. The dangers to German democracy were mounting.\n\nIt was a potentially disastrous time for the Nazis. Support was waning and being left out of government meant that, despite election success, the party had no way to reward its most ardent followers. \"We are all very depressed, especially given the danger that the party might break up and our work will have been in vain,\" noted Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi Party propaganda guru.\n\nHelp came from an unexpected quarter. Franz von Papen, who had already had his turn on the chancellor merry-go-round in June, wanted a second chance and beseeched von Hindenburg to give his backing to a coalition of Hitler's Nazis, independent conservatives, and the arch-nationalists from the DNVP. Other von Hindenburg advisors likewise pleaded for the solution, arguing that, by hemming Hitler in among those who had long been in Germany's political elite, they would be able to control the wannabe dictator. In January 1933, von Hindenburg gave in.\n\nAbsolute Power\n\nHitler had made it -- but he was still far from the dictator he would become. Indeed, his first government only included two ministers from the NSDAP, Hermann Göring as minister without portfolio and Wilhelm Frick as interior minister. But he wanted more; priority number one for his new government was the dissolution of the Reichstag and, yet again, new elections. His goal was clear, and it was one shared by much of the country's political elite: Once the Nazis and their allies had a majority, the Reichstag was to hand over power to the chancellor. In short, Hitler wanted parliament to vote itself out of existence.\n\nOnce again, luck seemed to be on Hitler's side. On February 27, less than a week before the new elections, the Reichstag, Germany's parliament building, was set ablaze. The blame was pinned on Dutch bricklayer Marinus van der Lubbe, and indeed, after decades of research into the incident, no convincing proof has been unearthed to show that he wasn't acting alone. But Hitler, Göring and Goebbels knew a propaganda godsend when they saw one. \"If this fire, as I believe, is the work of the Communists, then we need to crush this murderous plague with an iron fist,\" Hitler told his vice chancellor, von Papen.\n\nAnd crush they did. The day after the fire, the \"decree for the protection of people and the state\" went into effect, allowing Hitler's Nazis to go after their political enemies with gusto. It was the wave of arrests set off by the Reichstag fire that ultimately made the rapid construction of prisons necessary. Many of those prisons would later become concentration camps.\n\nOn election day in 1933 -- the last halfway free elections to take place in unified Germany until 1990 -- the Nazis won 43.9 percent of the vote.\n\nThe result still wasnt enough for the party to control its own destiny. But by then, it was already too late to matter. When the fateful parliamentary session was called to order on March 23, 1933 at just after 2 p.m., fully 107 representatives from the Social Democrats and the Communists were missing. Many of them were behind bars, while others were too afraid to show up or had already disappeared into exile. Just to be on the safe side, the parliamentary president Hermann Göring elected not even to acknowledge the 81 seats controlled by the Communists, significantly reducing the number of parliamentary votes available to the opposition.\n\nAt 6:16 p.m., SPD leader Otto Wels stepped to the microphone. It was to be the final public defense of democracy in Germany before the country started down the path of genocide, war and ruin. Not long after Wels finished, and following an enraged speech by Hitler, 444 representatives voted for parliament to be stripped of power. There were just 94 votes against.\n\nThe Nazis wasted no time. On April 1, they organized a nationwide boycott of Jewish shops, doctors and lawyers. On April 25, the share of Jewish university students was set at 1.5 percent. On May 2, Germany's powerful labor unions were outlawed. On May 10, students in numerous cities across Germany joined together in an orgy of book burning, doing away with volumes disapproved of by the Nazis. On June 23, the SPD was banned.\n\nBut the final important date in Hitler's rise to complete dictatorial power came only in the summer of 1934. On August 2, President Paul von Hindenburg passed away. In the days preceding the old man's death, Hitler signed a decree abolishing the position of president. In its place, another was created: \"Führer and Chancellor.\" Finally, all power in Germany was united in his hands.\n\nSixty-one months later, Germany invaded Poland. Soon thereafter, the Holocaust began. The result? Sixty million dead and a continent destroyed."
