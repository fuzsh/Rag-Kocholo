        "text": "Historically governments have used art as a form of propaganda. Art is usually associated with beauty and inspiration, however totalitarian regimes such as the Nazis, the Soviet Union under Communism, Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and more recently North Korea used art as a propaganda medium. Much of the artwork centering on a “Cult of Personality,” glorifies the leaders of totalitarian regimes and plays an important part in building up a national figure. Perhaps the most intense example is the artwork promulgated by Adolf Hitler’s Nazi Party. While the topic of Nazi art may seem repugnant, it is a classic study of art used as propaganda. Located in Washington DC is a unique collection of such propaganda, specifically from the Nazis of World War II. This article provides a short historical summary on the rise of Nazi Germany and then shows examples of the regime’s artwork currently in the Art Collection at the U.S. Army Center for Military History. “Artwork” covers many mediums, from architecture and design to film, painting, and sculpture; however, paintings are the focus of this article.\n\nGermany’s loss in World War I and the onerous provisions of the Treaty of Versailles provided the breeding ground for widespread discontent. Until October 1918, the Imperial German government controlled all news media. Propaganda extolled the fighting capabilities of the individual soldier and the country’s victories over the western Allies. Suddenly, the government announced an armistice in October 1918, which was in effect a surrender.\n\nBetween 1918 and 1923, Weimar Germany was plagued by severe internal crises. From both the left and the right came assassinations, anti-government propaganda, and popular revolts (putsches in German). The already weakened war-damaged economy could not recover; reparations and hyperinflation prevented reconstruction. The period between 1918 and 1923, is described by Professor Claudia Koonz, “The trauma of surrender, economic hardship, and political revolution defined the real world in which most Germans lived. But emotionally they lived in the aftermath of wartime glory … images of brave soldiers and strong women, hymns to a national spirit, and appeals to sacrifice … persisted even as reality left them behind. As Germans experienced hunger, fear of invasion, revolution, and economic disaster, they clung to dreams created by wartime propaganda.”\n\nNew political parties, both right and left, evolved in the chaos of post-war Germany. The rightist Nazi Party (officially the National Socialist German Workers Party, or in German Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, referred to by the acronym “Nazi”), began with less than a hundred members, but grew rapidly. The Nazi solution to Germany’s problems was unification. They emphasized a trinity – the individual, the people and the nation – united together and led by a visionary leader, Adolf Hitler.\n\nMany of the new political parties in Germany had armed auxiliaries. Hitler created the Nazi Party “Gymnastic and Sports Division” to serve as the party’s military arm. It was a cover name because the Weimar government was cracking down on paramilitary groups. Later this element became the Sturmabteilung (S.A. or Storm Troopers), or “Brown Shirts,” because of their brown uniforms. Oaths administered during ritualistic ceremonies bonded the membership and insured loyalty to the leader. As the economy continued to deteriorate, the Nazi Party built its strength in the popularly elected Weimar assembly (the Reichstag). This gave them legitimacy in the minds of the people.\n\nIn 1932 Hitler ran for the presidency of Germany, coming in second to General Paul von Hindenburg (the WWI military hero). The next year, on 30 January 1933, Adolf Hitler became the Chancellor of a coalition government under the aged von Hindenburg (84 years old, in very poor health, and perhaps in the early stages of senility). On the evening of 27 February 1933 arsonists destroyed the Reichstag. A “half-witted Dutch Communist” pyromaniac and others were arrested, tried, and executed for the crime. The Reichstag fire gave the Nazis an excuse to make a power grab. On 28 February, at Hitler’s bequest, President von Hindenburg signed a decree “for the Protection of the People and the State” that suspended many civil liberties within Germany. By 5 March 1933 the Nazis were the majority party in the Reichstag. During the summer of 1933 it became the only legal political party in Germany.\n\nFrom the creation of the Nazi Party, Adolf Hitler employed sophisticated propaganda. That propaganda apparatus was institutionalized as a government department shortly after Hitler was elected Chancellor on 31 January 1933. On 13 March 1933, he established the Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda (Reichsministerium fÃ¼r VolksaufklÃ¤rung und Propaganda or Propagandaministerium). His propaganda chief, Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels, was named its minister.\n\nThe Propagandaministerium became the largest of all Nazi Ministries. It was charged with controlling public opinion and enforcing Nazi doctrine. In a symbolic move, the new ministry building was placed in a prominent position on the Wilhelmplatz, directly across from the new Reich Chancellery building. This emphasized its important place in the hierarchy of the new “Third Reich.” The Propaganda Ministry infused Nazi ideology and doctrine into every aspect of daily life. Author Peter Adam explained: “National Socialist [Nazi] doctrine lived in almost every painting, film, stamp, and public building, in the toys of the children, in people’s houses, in tales and costumes, in the layout of villages, in the songs and poems taught in schools, even household goods. The cultural infiltration of every sphere of life never ceased.” Art was an important weapon in the arsenal of the Nazi regime.\n\nThe Reich Culture Chamber (Reichskulturkammer) of Goebbels’ Propaganda Ministry controlled German art. Membership was mandatory for all those “who participated in the creation, reproduction, intellectual or technical processing, dissemination, preservation, and sale of cultural goods.” All forms of art had to promote Nazi ideology and racial consciousness. The German people were to be portrayed as peaceful or struggling to defend their country.\n\nWorks of art and literature that did not fit into the Nazi ideology were labeled “degenerate.” Much of the so-called degenerate artwork and books were destroyed. In some cases, they were burned publicly to show political strength. However, a lot ended up in the private art collections and libraries of Nazi Party elite, like Hermann GÃ¶ring, Reichsmarschall (second only to Hitler) and Commander of the German Air Force (Luftwaffe).\n\nThroughout the life of the Third Reich the Nazi regime used art as propaganda. Artists labored under strict regulatory standards, and many worked directly for the Propaganda Ministry. The majority of the Nazi effort was internal. It focused on the German people to reinforce the Hitler myth (image) and promote the Nazi ideology. The Propaganda Ministry mass produced motivational posters and post cards until the German surrender on 8 May 1945.\n\nDuring the 1945 Potsdam Conference the Allies agreed that all reminders of the Nazi regime, including artwork, would be removed from public view to hasten the denazification process in Germany. In the American zone, artwork with Nazi symbols and military motifs were confiscated. This included state-owned and Nazi Party art that portrayed the leaders or symbolized Nazi ideology or doctrine. Between 1945 and 1950, the U.S. Army collected some 8,000 pieces of Nazi art and shipped them to the U.S. Army Center for Military History, for safekeeping in the Army Art Collection. Some of the art in that collection is temporarily displayed in U.S. Army military museums and offices around the country, including the Pentagon and in the major Army Command headquarters buildings. However, the majority is in storage. In late 1950 about 2,000 pieces of art were determined by the Department of the Army to be non-military and returned to the West German government. Over the next forty years more artwork was returned. Approximately 450 pieces of Nazi art remain in the U.S. Army Art Collection. Under German law, private individuals cannot own Nazi symbols, memorabilia, and art. However, state-supported museums and educational institutions in Germany may display Nazi items for educational purposes.\n\nThe Nazi Party developed its own heraldry as a source of identification for its members. Part of the Nazi Party’s allure was its regalia (uniforms and symbology). In the summer of 1920 Adolf Hitler designed the party insignia.\n\nA hooked cross – the hakenkreuz – an ancient symbol became the Nazi swastika. Rejecting the black, red, and gold colors of the Weimar Republic, Hitler chose a white circle with the black swastika in the center on a red background. The red symbolized the movement, the white represented nationalism, and the swastika reflected the “struggle for the victory of the Aryan man.”\n\nFor parades and mass meetings Hitler devised standards based on ancient Roman Legion heraldry, with a black metal swastika on top surrounded with a metal wreath, surmounted by an eagle, from which hung a square swastika flag, emblazoned with “Germany Awake! (Deutschland Erwache!).”\n\nPainting Spotlight\n\nPainting Spotlight: ‘The Munich Putsch’\n\nThe Nazi Party prepared for revolution. On 9 November 1923, Adolf Hitler used a mass meeting at the BuergerbÃ¤ukeller beer hall in Munich to begin what became known as the “Beer Hall Putsch.”\n\nAfter a confrontation with the police, sixteen Nazis and three police were dead or dying, with many others wounded. The subsequent trial of Hitler and nine co-defendants propelled him into the national spotlight. Convicted of treason Hitler would write Mein Kampf (My Struggle) in Landsberg prison, part autobiography, part blueprint for the future of Germany and the “operator’s manual” for the Nazi Party.\n\nReleased after serving only nine months of a five-year sentence, Hitler went on a book tour to promote his new book. It became a bestseller and catapulted Hitler into the national limelight. The failed coup d’Ã©tat became a sacred day for the Nazi Party and was commemorated in memorial ceremonies and paintings.\n\nIn the center of the painting, Hitler boldly defies the soldiers, while dead and dying comrades lay at his feet. A bright light in the background emphasizes the righteousness of the cause. In reality, Hitler, and most of the Nazi leadership fled the scene as soon as shots were fired. The artist is identified only as “Schmitt.”\n\nPainting Spotlight\n\n‘Nazi Vision of Greatness’\n\nThe 1933 painting, “Nazi Vision of Greatness,” by Richard Spitz capitalizes on religious fervor. Waves of Nazi Brown Shirts, gazing intently ahead, move toward a radiant, sun-like swastika atop a Teutonic castle on the horizon.\n\nIn the center of the painting, a Brown Shirt, swooning in rapture, collapses. As he is caught by a comrade he is reverently gesturing toward the golden swastika-sun with his right hand.\n\nIn the center, closest to the sun is the Nazi standard. Nazi flags dot the landscape, fluttering in the wind. In the right foreground are a Hitler Youth, a white bearded distinguished looking grandparent, a farmer, and other workers.\n\nPerhaps the most symbolic element in the painting is in the sky, where, amidst storming clouds, the spirits of faithful dead Nazis stream towards the shimmering swastika-sun, their right arms outstretched in the Hitler salute."
