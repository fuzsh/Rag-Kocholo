        "text": "March Violets\n\nBy Philip Kerr,\n\nFrom my list on portray a sense of place.\n\nBy AJ Davidson Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI believe many writers suspect they are Strangers in a Strange Land. How ironic that I, a confirmed atheist, should use a biblical quote to describe the mindset of authors. Some discover where they belong through their writing. My book recommendations have a strong sense of place, whether it be the Old West, wartime Berlin, or modern-day Scotland. I was born into a 300-year-old N. Ireland Protestant Plantation family, yet many people saw us as interlopers: we weren’t quite Irish, and we weren’t quite British, yet we held dual passports. It was not until I left Ireland that I realized my Irish Heritage exerted a stronger pull than my British.\n\nAJ's book list on portray a sense of place\n\nWhy did AJ love this book?\n\nOne of the best explanations I’ve read of the rise of Fascism in Hitler’s Germany. I agree that ignoring the lessons of history means we’ll be forced to endure repetition. And Kerr paints such a chilling scenario no one in their right mind would wish the maxim to come true. His prose applies color and form like an artist at the top of their game.\n\nAt times I found him reminiscent of Chandler in the way he portrays the Nazis as the worst gangsters in the game. This is the first book of the Bernard Gunther series, and I was so enthralled that I raced through the others in just a few days. His storyline is filled with horror, passion, fear, and pathos—a tour de force of emotions.\n\nBy Philip Kerr,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n6 authors picked March Violets as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nDiscover the first crime novel in the late Philip Kerr's Bernie Gunther series - Berlin Noir - set in Hitler's Germany during the 1930s . . .\n\nWinter, 1936. A man and his wife shot dead in their bed, their home burned. The woman's father, a millionaire industrialist, wants justice - and the priceless diamonds that disappeared along with his daughter's life. He turns to Bernhard Gunther, a private eye and former cop.\n\nAs Bernie follows the trail into the very heart of Nazi Germany, he's forced to confront a horrifying conspiracy. A trail that ends in the hell that…\n\nPreview\n\nCorpus\n\nBy Rory Clements,\n\nFrom my list on Germany between the world wars.\n\nBy Neil Spark Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nThe World At War, the first and arguably best documentary about the Second World War, was on television when I was 14. It fuelled my interest in history, especially about the reasons for the rise of the Nazis. History has many lessons to teach–if we are willing to listen–and one of the great teachers is Germany between the wars. It was a time of extremes: economic crises, social unrest, much of which was caused by the Nazis, and a flourishing bohemian, liberal culture. This febrile environment in which characters struggle with their personal conflict makes for great story-telling potential.\n\nNeil's book list on Germany between the world wars\n\nWhy did Neil love this book?\n\nOne of Rory Clements’ many writing skills is the ability to create tension and explore an angle of an historical event.\n\nIt’s London 1936, and the king is about to abdicate. A woman is murdered in Berlin, and a fascist-leaning couple in Britain are killed. I liked how Clements joins these seemingly separate tragedies into a memorable story. I liked his hero, an academic drawn into the world of spying, Professor Tom Wilde.\n\nI think a great novel's elements are believable characters, forensic attention to detail, and terrific tension, and they are all here.\n\nBy Rory Clements,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Corpus as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA gripping spy thriller for fans of ROBERT HARRIS and WILLIAM BOYD from award-winning Sunday Times bestseller Rory Clements and author of the 2018 CWA HISTORICAL DAGGER WINNER, NUCLEUS\n\n1936. Europe is in turmoil. The Nazis have marched into the Rhineland. In Russia, Stalin has unleashed his Great Terror.

It fuelled my interest in history, especially about the reasons for the rise of the Nazis. History has many lessons to teach–if we are willing to listen–and one of the great teachers is Germany between the wars. It was a time of extremes: economic crises, social unrest, much of which was caused by the Nazis, and a flourishing bohemian, liberal culture. This febrile environment in which characters struggle with their personal conflict makes for great story-telling potential.\n\nNeil's book list on Germany between the world wars\n\nWhy did Neil love this book?\n\nAs I read this riveting account, I felt like I was watching the events leading to the Munich Agreement of 1938. We all know the result of the agreement, but this book is much more than a historical account of what happened.\n\nHarris tells the story through two friends who met at Oxford University in the 1920s. Now, one is an aide to British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, and the other a senior German Foreign Office official. They join forces to try to stop Chamberlain from signing the agreement.\n\nI was impressed with the skillful way Harris revealed the story, which the exemplary writing is matched in detail and tension.\n\nBy Robert Harris,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Munich as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNow a major NETFLIX movie starring Jeremy Irons, George Mackay and Alex Jennings\n\n'So good you want to clap' THE TIMES\n\n'Unputdownable to the point of being dangerous' SUNDAY EXPRESS\n\n'Grips from start to finish . . .

And with a brave and determined woman protagonist who overcomes the odds, this book didn’t disappoint. Jane Thynne’s angle of exploring the lives of the wives of the leading Nazis is new, different, and works well.\n\nClara Vine has left Britain in less than happy circumstances and goes to Berlin, where she gets a job as an actor at the famous Ufa studios. After a chance meeting, she becomes part of the Nazi wives’ social circle. When Magda Goebbels discloses a life-threatening secret and asks Clara for her help, the tension is on.\n\nBy Jane Thynne,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Black Roses as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBerlin, 1933\n\nWarning bells ring across Europe as Hitler comes to power\n\nClara Vine is young and ambitious, and determined to succeed as an actress.

The war had just started and it became even more real with each successive class when we were encouraged to buy war-saving stamps. On the home front, we experienced blackouts and mock air raids. Sugar, meat, butter, alcohol, and even gasoline were rationed. My cousins were overseas and in the thick of it. They always made sure I had an airplane model at Christmas. And as the war wound to a close, they sent me a cap from one from one of the German soldiers. It still intrigues me and still lives in my head.\n\nJim's book list on World war novels for people who love history and fiction\n\nWhy did Jim love this book?\n\nIf you’re curious about what was happening in Germany throughout the war, you’ll love Albert Speer’s memoir, which provides a unique, inside look at Hitler and his closest associates before and after the Allies landed in Normandy. Speer was Hitler’s architect and paints a unique picture of Hitler from the start of the war. It also includes a wonderful series of pictures at every stage.\n\nIf you’re fascinated by The Second World War, this book is a must for your library, as it is in mine. I look at the pictures over and over and delight in seeing the principal players who made those years memorable. It’s a book that will stay in your head for a long time.\n\nBy Albert Speer,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked Inside the Third Reich as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nSynopsis coming soon.......\n\nPreview\n\nThe Last Days of Hitler\n\nBy Hugh Trevor-Roper,\n\nFrom my list on understanding Nazi Germany.\n\nBy David Luhrssen Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nUnlike most children of immigrants who were told nothing about the past, I grew up surrounded by family history—my grandfather’s village in Russia, my father’s memories of 1930s Europe, and my mother’s childhood on a migrant worker farm during the Great Depression. I realized that history isn’t just names and dates but a unique opportunity to study human behavior. I wrote Hammer of the Gods about the Thule Society because Thule was often mentioned in passing by historians of Nazi Germany, as if they were uncomfortable delving into an occult group recognized as influential on the Nazis. I decided I wanted to learn who they were and what they wanted.\n\nDavid's book list on understanding Nazi Germany\n\nWhy did David love this book?\n\nThere have been more recent accounts of Hitler’s retreat to the bunker in the last weeks of his life. But even if some new information has surfaced since Britain’s H.R. Trevor-Roper wrote his report, the vividness is hard to match. Trever-Roper recorded his thoughts on Hitler’s end before the rubble of war had been cleared away. It was almost on-the-scene reporting.\n\nBy Hugh Trevor-Roper,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Last Days of Hitler as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nLate in 1945, Hugh Trevor-Roper was appointed by the British Intelligence to investigate the conflicting evidence surrounding Hitler's final days. The author, who had access to American counterintelligence files and to German prisoners, focuses on the last ten days of Hitler's life, April 20-29, 1945, in the underground bunker in Berlin.\n\nPreview\n\nThe Meaning of Hitler\n\nBy Sebastian Haffner, Ewald Osers (translator),\n\nWhy did Neil love this book?\n\nAs in the case of Joachim Fest, it is impossible to read this book without having some sense of the author’s own autobiography. Haffner was an emigré who had left Germany for Britain in 1939, was briefly interned in the war, and became a correspondent for The Observer. The essayistic reflections offered in this short book are not so much biographical as a set of attempts to place Hitler within the wider context of German history and to understand Hitler as a historical phenomenon. Readable, astute, and thoughtful, they are an engaging introduction to his life-long attempts to make sense of the regime from which he had fled.\n\nBy Sebastian Haffner, Ewald Osers (translator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Meaning of Hitler as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis is a remarkable historical and psychological examination of the enigma of Adolf Hitler-who he was, how he wielded power, and why he was destined to fail.\n\nBeginning with Hitler's early life, Sebastian Haffner probes the historical, political, and emotional forces that molded his character. In examining the inhumanity of a man for whom politics became a substitute for life, he discusses Hitler's bizarre relationships with women, his arrested psychological development, his ideological misconceptions, his growing obsession with racial extermination, and the murderous rages of his distorted mind. Finally, Haffner confronts the most disturbing question of all: Could another Hitler…\n\nPreview\n\nHitlerland\n\nBy Andrew Nagorski,\n\nWhy did Robert love this book?\n\nAs the title suggests, this is a compendium of American visitors’ impressions of Nazism in the 1930s. Their reactions varied from confusion to rage to applause, but Nagorski notes that, sooner or later, most came to the realization that Germany was “a society undergoing a horrific transformation in the name of a demented ideology,” and feared the implications for humanity. Another useful reminder of the essential role of solid, independent journalism, and of the methods by which seemingly decent people and entire societies can be devoured by hatred and tribalism. It seems, sadly, that we need a lot of reminding about such things…\n\nBy Andrew Nagorski,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Hitlerland as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWorld War II historian Andrew Nagorski recounts Adolf Hitler’s rise to and consolidation of power, drawing on countless firsthand reports, letters, and diaries that narrate the creation of the Third Reich.\n\n“Hitlerland is a bit of a guilty pleasure. Reading about the Nazis is not supposed to be fun, but Nagorski manages to make it so. Readers new to this story will find it fascinating” (The Washington Post).\n\nHitler’s rise to power, Germany’s march to the abyss, as seen through the eyes of Americans—diplomats, military officers, journalists, expats, visiting authors, Olympic athletes—who watched horrified and up close. “Engaging if chilling…a…\n\nPreview\n\nHitler (Harvest Book)\n\nBy Joachim C. Fest,\n\nWhy did Paul love this book?\n\nThis remains the outstanding full-length biography of Hitler, not least because it is brilliantly written; it is also extraordinarily prescient.\n\nFest’s portrayal of the Nazi leader, the first to be written by a German, shows how any human society, no matter how cultured or educated, if far enough degraded and humiliated will be willing to listen to a banal, humourless bully whose singular obsessions were to pick at Germany’s war wounds and delegate the slaughter of the blameless minority he deemed responsible.\n\nIn Fest’s hands, Hitler emerges as no freak of nature with god-like powers, no monster beyond our comprehension…but shockingly human, the living fulfillment of the racist fantasies of the ordinary, pot-bellied fascists who brought him to power.\n\nBy Joachim C. Fest,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Hitler (Harvest Book) as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA bestseller in its original German edition and subsequently translated into more than a dozen languages, Joachim Fest's Hitler as become a classic portrait of a man, a nation, and an era. Fest tells and interprets the extraordinary story of a man's and a nation's rise from impotence to absolute power, as Germany and Hitler, from shared premises, entered into their covenant. He shows Hitler exploiting the resentments of the shaken, post-World War I social order and seeing through all that was hollow behind the appearance of power, at home and abroad. Fest reveals the singularly penetrating politician, hypnotizing Germans…\n\nPreview"
