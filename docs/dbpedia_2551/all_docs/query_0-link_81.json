        "text": "Notes\n\nPreface\n\nThe man whose name appears in the title of this book and in the headings of each of its chapters has determined my life to a degree that embarrasses me. I was three and a half when he came to power and almost sixteen when he killed himself. I grew up under him, went to his schools, lived through his war. Only after he disappeared, though, did I feel his full impact upon me. Among my first postwar readings were reports on his camps and on the Nuremberg trials. I realized that I had lived under a criminal. I began to wonder then how his rule had come about, and in the country in which I had been born. It was largely with these questions in mind that I took up the study of history.\n\nI read his book, for the first time, in that winter of 1945 without understanding it, but on rereading it several years later I suddenly discovered that he had set down in the 1920s what he would do in the 1940s. Above all, his two goals, a war of conquest and the elimination of the Jews, were clearly stated. I had been told that he was a lunatic, but I found that he had at least been consistent. I chose that topic when I became a professor and had to deliver an inaugural lecture. A publisher sitting in the audience suggested that I write a small book on it. This came out in 1969. It was criticized by some for not explaining how such a man could have come to power and put his ideas into practice. That had not been my subject, but it was the very question that had intrigued me since 1945.\n\nWhen I was invited to deliver a series of lectures at the Tauber Institute at Brandeis University in September and October 1983 I took the opportunity to assemble the answers I had found over the years. The views presented here are thus the result of several years of work. The first chapter offers an explanation of how such a man came to power. The next two are corollaries of the two central chapters of my earlier book. There I had attempted to show how that man had formulated his goals; here I have tried to explain how he implemented them. The fourth examines why he declared war on the United States. The last chapter was not delivered as a lecture at Brandeis, but rather was added to the second German edition of my earlier book. Since the chapter did not appear in the English translation, I decided to include it here. The chapter introduces some additional considerations while also summarizing my research and conclusions. It has been translated by Maria Tatar, to whom I am indebted for her excellent work.\n\nI am pleased to express my gratitude once more to the Tauber Institute and its former director, Professor Bernard Wasserstein, for their invitation. I also wish to thank my listeners again for their patience with my lectures and for their challenging questions that followed. My greatest thanks go to my friend Rudolph Binion. Not only were these lectures originally proposed by him. If they have attained a measure of readability it is because of his painstaking corrections and revisions of my English. I appreciate his labors all the more as he disagrees with me on many points. The least I can do is stress that the polish is his and the shortcomings mine. I should like to include Roberta Recht in my thanks. Rudy’s and her kindness made my weeks at Brandeis an unforgettable pleasure.\n\nStuttgart, December 1983\n\n1 Hitler Comes to Power\n\nFor all those interested in German history, and perhaps not for them alone, the seminal question of the twentieth century is: How could Hitler come to power? The question has been raised many times and has received almost as many answers. Yet Hitler’s accession to power on January 30, 1933, one of the crucial events of our century, seems to be obscured rather than explained by the very mass of information and by the innumerable interpretations concerned with it. We know much, but we understand little about how Germany came to give itself over to a dictatorship that turned out to be of unprecedented criminality in history. It might be refreshing, therefore, just to apply the known facts to simple questions and answers. Let us avoid sweeping statements and instead ask modest but precise questions without hesitating to repeat the obvious. We shall begin with unquestionable facts and try to explain them as precisely as possible in the light of our present knowledge.\n\nThe first fact is that Hitler came to power as chancellor because President Hindenburg appointed him. That is indisputable. It was in the first instance not groups such as industry, or systems like capitalism, or authoritarian ideas, that brought the leader of the Nazi party to power; it was simply the president. Again, Hitler did not come to power through a coup d’état or a revolution, but rather by appointment within the constitutional framework of the Weimar Republic.\n\nThe first question, therefore, is a double one: Why did Hindenburg appoint Hitler, and how was he able to do so? For human beings do not act only from personal motives. They act also, and above all, according to certain conditions. They cannot do everything they want to do. Of what they want to do, they do only what they can. We shall therefore analyze primarily, not Hindenburg’s motives, but the conditions under which he acted.\n\nWe may anticipate a simple answer: Hindenburg appointed Hitler because Hitler was the leader of the strongest party in Germany. This statement remains to be elaborated but it will be found to be as indisputable as the first one. The next question will then have to be why and how the Nazi party had become the strongest party.\n\nOne objection can be raised against the assumptions implied in the second question just posed. The Nazi party had already become the strongest party six months earlier, during the elections of July 31, 1932. Consequently we must ask why Hitler was not appointed chancellor until half a year later. Again we can anticipate a simple answer: The Nazis did not have a majority in the Reichstag either in the summer of 1932 or at the time of Hitler’s appointment. Hitler was not brought to power by a parliamentary majority; nearly two thirds of the German electorate had not voted for him. This fact complicates our understanding of the events. Had the Nazi party held a majority in the Reichstag, the appointment of Hitler would be easier to explain. We would have to ask only how that majority had come about. Nevertheless, although the Nazis did not have a majority, their limited electoral successes are one condition that led to Hitler’s appointment as chancellor. This leads us to our third question: Why and how did this party come into being? This question must be clearly separated from that regarding the party’s electoral successes. For the successes began only after 1929, whereas the party was founded in 1919.\n\nThus we have arrived at the triple question. It concerns first of all Hindenburg, who appointed Hitler; second, the voters who made Hitler a political factor; and third, the party that attracted the voters. All three questions have to be raised together. Whoever asks only about Hindenburg neglects the electorate, without which he would not have appointed Hitler. Again, whoever asks only about the electorate overlooks the fact that it did not give the Nazi party a majority. And whoever asks only about the party needs reminding that it would not have come to power without the electorate and without Hindenburg. Let us begin, therefore, at the logical beginning, with the question why Hindenburg appointed Hitler.\n\nTHE ROLE OF HINDENBURG\n\nAlthough in appointing Hitler chancellor Hindenburg acted within the framework of the constitution, he was not required to appoint him at any time. Article 53 of the Weimar constitution empowered the president to appoint the chancellor of his choice.¹ This freedom was restricted only by Article 54, which stipulated that the chancellor and the ministers must command the confidence of the Reichstag.\n\nThus, Hitler or any would-be chancellor could not simply concern himself with his own appointment; he needed the backing of a majority in the Reichstag. This meant 293 votes of the then 584 members. The Nazis numbered only 196. They were 97 seats short of a majority, thus Hitler formed a coalition cabinet. His coalition partner, the Conservative party, however, had only 52 members in parliament, leaving the Hitler government short 45 seats for an absolute majority. Thus Hitler’s government, like its three predecessors, was a so-called presidential cabinet.\n\nA presidential cabinet was not provided for in the constitution, but had a legal basis in it through a combination of Articles 48 and 53. According to Article 48 the president could take any steps necessary to restore law and order should they be considerably disturbed or endangered. The president alone decided when that state of emergency had been reached and what measures could be taken. The constitution called for a law to provide detailed regulations for carrying out Article 48, but such a law was never passed. The president’s power under Article 48 was restricted, however, by the stipulation that he inform the Reichstag immediately of any emergency measures taken; the Reichstag could in turn annul those measures by a simple majority vote. Thus the president’s immense emergency powers could be nullified if and when the majority of the members of parliament so wished.\n\nIt was on this legal basis that Germany had been governed since March 30, 1930. Pursuant to Article 53 of the Weimar constitution the president had appointed three successive chancellors: Heinrich Brüning, Franz von Papen, and Kurt von Schleicher. None of them commanded the confidence of the Reichstag. But since the Reichstag’s confidence did not need to be overtly expressed, only overtly denied, the chancellors governed so long as a vote of no confidence was not put. They governed with the backing, or confidence, of the president"
