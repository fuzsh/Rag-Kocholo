        "text": "Origin\n\nSula : 1: Czech and Slovak (Šula): nickname from Czech dialect and Slovak archaic šula ‘perch (fish)’ in Czech also ‘bitch (female dog)’.2: Slovak (Šuľa): habitational name from a place called Šuľa or a nickname from šúľať ‘to roll’ (compare Sulek).3: Slovak (Suľa): unexplained.4: Albanian: from Sulë (definite form Sula) a short form of the Muslim personal name Sulejman (see Suleiman).\n\nAke : 1: English: topographic name for someone living by a prominent oak tree from Middle English ake ‘oak’ or a habitational name from the village of Aike near Lockington East Yorkshire which is named with Old English āc ‘oak’ dative āce ‘(place at) the oak tree’.2: Amerindian (Mexico): from the name of the site of a pre-Columbian Mayan settlement in the Yucatán Peninsula.\n\nAn : 1: Chinese: Mandarin form of the surname 安 meaning ‘peace safe’ or ‘calm’ in Chinese: (i) borne by descendants of immigrants from an ancient state called An Xi (安息) also known as the Parthian Empire (located in present-day northeastern Iran). Traditional accounts record that the legendary emperor Huang Di the ‘Yellow Emperor’ (c. 27th century BC) had a grandson named An who moved to the far west to establish An Xi losing contact with the Middle Kingdom. In 147 AD An Shigao (安世高) prince of the Parthian Empire (An Xi) came to China to preach Buddhism. Later some immigrants from the Parthian Empire (An Xi) adopted their tribal name An as their surname. (ii) adopted as a surname by the An Chi (安遲) family from the Xianbei ethnic group in northern China during the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534 AD). (iii) from one of the ‘Nine Sogdian Surnames’ also known as ‘Nine Surnames of Zhaowu’ because their ancestors came from Zhaowu an ancient city in present-day Gansu province in northwestern China. During the Sui and Tang dynasties (581–987 AD) there were nine Sogdian states in Central Asia one of which was called An (安) in Chinese. Between 649 and 655 AD these states submitted to Emperor Gaozong of Tang (628–83 AD). (iv) possibly from An (安) the name of an ancient fief (located in Shanxi province).2: Chinese: variant Romanization of the surname 晏 see Yan 5.3: Chinese: variant Romanization of the surname 洪 see Hong 1.4: Korean: written 안 in Chinese characters 安 meaning ‘peace’. This is the only Chinese character for the surname An. Some sources indicate that there are 109 An clans but only six can be documented. All had one common founding ancestor named Yi Wŏn (李 瑗) who migrated from Tang China to the Shilla Kingdom in 807 AD. Yi had three sons who helped the Shilla king Kyŏngmun (861–75) to repel Japanese invaders. As a token of royal appreciation these three sons were enfeoffed with land and granted the surname An (安). It is now quite a common Korean surname and can be found throughout the peninsula. Compare Ahn 1.5: Vietnamese: from the Chinese surname 安 (see 1 above).6: Vietnamese (Ân): from the Chinese surname 殷 (see Yin 1).\n\nAudi : 1: Italian: patronymic or plural form of the personal name Audo a variant of Aldo.2: Arabic (mainly Palestine): from ʿAwdī a habitational name for someone from Al-ʿAwd the name of several places mostly on Arabian Peninsula. It is found among both Muslims and Christians.\n\nBurum : 1: West Frisian (Van Burum): habitational name for someone from the village of Burum in Friesland. Compare Boerum.2: Croatian: topographic name from burum ‘peninsula-like form within the almost closed loop of water in meander’.3: Possibly also an altered form of English Burham.\n\nCha : 1: Korean (Ch’a): written 자 in Chinese characters 車 meaning ‘cart’ or ‘wagon’. This is the only Chinese character for the surname Ch’a and the Yŏnan Ch’a clan is the only clan. Their founding ancestor was Ch’a Hyojŏn (車; 孝全) the son of a Koryŏ high minister named Yu Ch’a-tal (10th century AD). He served the incoming Koryŏ rulers with exceptional valour and loyalty so the Koryŏ monarch bestowed upon his first son the surname Ch’a (車) and enfeoffed him with Yŏnan County in Hwanghae South Province. Ch’a is a fairly common surname throughout the Korean peninsula but most of the clan's members live in Kyŏngsang province Hwanghae province or P’yŏngan province.2: Chinese: Mandarin form of the surname 茶 meaning ‘tea’ in Chinese: (i) possibly borne by the descendants of Lu Yu (733–804 AD) a famous figure during the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD) known as the Sage of Tea who wrote the book Classic of Tea. (ii) from the first element of the placename Chalin (茶陵 located in present-day Hunan province) said to be the place where the legendary Yan Emperor was buried. (iii) adopted in place of the surname Meng (蒙) by some members living in Yunnan in order to avoid persecution or feud. (iv) adopted as a Han Chinese surname by some minority ethnic groups in southwestern China.3: Chinese: Cantonese form and alternative Mandarin form of the surname 查 see Zha.4: Chinese: variant Romanization of the surname 謝 see Xie 1.5: Southeast Asian (Hmong): from the name of the Cha or Chang clan of the Hmong people in Laos China and Vietnam; in Chinese characters it is written 張 (see Zhang 1). Compare Chang 14.\n\nChae : Korean: written 제 in Chinese characters 諸 meaning ‘all’. This is the only Chinese character for the surname Chae. There are two Chae clans: the Ch’ilwŏn and the Ŭisŏng the Ch’ilwŏn clan being the larger. Ancestors of this family were originally named Chaegal (諸葛) in Korea. According to the Chaegal clan genealogy the founding ancestor was a twentieth-generation descendant of a Chinese government official Chae Kal-lyang (諸葛 亮) a character who plays an important role in the epic tale of the Three Kingdoms. This descendant migrated to the Shilla kingdom some time in the early 9th century. He and his descendants lived in the southern tip of the Korean peninsula for four centuries. It is said that during the reign of the Koryŏ king Kojong (1213–59) two brothers split the Chaegal surname: the younger brother Yŏng (瑩) took the surname Kal (葛) and the elder brother Hong (泓) took the surname Chae (諸). In Korea most members of the Chae clan live in southern Kyŏngsang and Chŏlla provinces. Compare Chai 5 Chay 2 and Che 5.\n\nChi : 1: Chinese: Mandarin and Cantonese form of the surname 池 meaning ‘moat’ in ancient Chinese: (i) acquired as a surname by people who lived beside a moat. (ii) from Chi (池) said to be the name of an ancient state (of unknown location and period). (iii) from the personal name Chi (池) personal name of a son of an official in the state of Qin during the Spring and Autumn period (770–476 BC).2: Chinese: Mandarin and Cantonese form of the surname 遲 meaning ‘late’ in Chinese: (i) borne by descendants of Chi Ren (遲任) a person who lived during the Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BC). (ii) shortened form of the Chinese compound surname Yu-Chi (尉遲) originally the name of a tribe from the Xianbei ethnic group in northern China. (iii) from the second element of the personal name Zi Chi (子遲) style name of Fan Xu a student of Confucius (551–479 BC).3: Chinese: alternative Mandarin form of the surname 植 see Zhi 1.4: Chinese: alternative Mandarin and Cantonese form of the surnames 支 and 智 see Zhi 2 and 3.5: Chinese: alternative Mandarin form of the surnames 紀 季 冀 姬 籍 嵇 吉 計 薊 暨 and 汲 see Ji 1-11.6: Chinese: alternative Mandarin form of the surnames 齊 祁 戚 漆 亓 蕲 and 啓 see Qi 1-7.7: Chinese: variant Romanization of the surnames 奚 and 郗 see Xi 1 and 5.8: Chinese: variant Romanization of the surname 錢 based on its Teochew Hokkien or Taiwanese pronunciation see Qian.9: Chinese: variant Romanization of the surname 徐 based on its Hokkien or Taiwanese pronunciation see Xu 1.10: Korean: written 지 in Chinese characters 池 meaning ‘moat’ and 智 meaning ‘wisdom’. The two Chinese characters for the Chi surname are borne by different groups. (i) The smaller of the two groups has only one clan associated with it the majority of whose members live in Kangwŏn and Ch’ungch’ŏn North Provinces of South Korea and North Korea's P’yŏngan North Province. (ii) The other group also has one clan but a much larger population. Unlike many clans in Korea the larger Chi family did not remain congregated in and around its clan seat but dispersed fairly evenly around the peninsula. Compare Chee 5 and Jee 1.11: Amerindian (Mexico Guatemala and Belize): Mayan name from chi' ‘mouth’ also ‘shore bank’ or from a homonymous name of a fruit-bearing shrub or small tree (Malpighia glabra).\n\nChong : 1: Korean (Chŏng): written 정 in Chinese characters 鄭 丁 and 程. There are actually eight Chinese characters used to represent the surname Chŏng which is one of the most common Korean surnames but the clans that use five of these characters are extremely small. The characters 丁 and 程 are mainly found in Chŏlla province. (i) The clan which uses the Chinese character 丁 is descended from a Chinese Tang Dynasty minister named Tŏk-sŏng (徳盛) who immigrated to Korea and settled on Aphae Island in Shinan county Chŏlla South Province. (ii) The clan bearing the surname 程 is believed to be descended from Chinese immigrants but further details are not known. The founding ancestor of the Han San Chŏng clan was called Chŏng Hoe (程 淮). (iii) The most common of the three more numerous clans which uses the Chinese character 鄭 is the oldest and is widely distributed throughout the peninsula. It is probably of Chinese origin too. Some sources indicate that there are 215 separate Chŏng clans but only 32 of them can be documented. The earliest and largest Chŏng clan began in 32 AD when Chibaekho one of the six ruling elders of pre-Shilla Korea received the surname of Chŏng from the Shilla King Yuri Isagŭm (24–57 AD). Compare Cheong 5 Choung 1 Chung 11 Jeong 1 Jong 1 Joung Jun 1 and Jung 10.2: Chinese: Mandarin form of the surname 崇: from Chong (崇) the name of an ancient state (located in Songxian in Henan province) during the Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BC).3: Chinese: Mandarin form of the surname 种 adopted in place of another Chinese surname Zhong (仲) by the descendants of Zhong Shanfu (仲山甫) an official during the reign of King Xuan of Zhou (reigned 827–782 BC) in order to escape from the feud.4: Chinese: Cantonese form of the surname 莊 see Zhuang.5: Chinese: variant Cantonese form of the surnames 鐘 and 仲 see Zhong 1 and 2.6: Chinese: variant Cantonese form of the surname 宗 see Zong.7: Chinese: variant Cantonese form of the surname 叢 see Cong 1.8: Chinese: Cantonese form of the surname 臧 see Zang.9: Chinese: Hakka form of the Chinese surnames 張 and 章 see Zhang 1 and 2.

He failed in the competitions for the throne among the princes and later fled to the wild lands. He then adopted the surname Chu (初) a similar-sounding Chinese character to the name of his original state. (ii) said to be traced back to the royal families of the Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BC). (iii) said to be traced back to Xue Hongzuo a general during the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534 AD) who was endowed with the surname Chu (初) by Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei (408–452 AD). (iv) said to be traced back to Qi Wei (祁暐) an official in the Northern Song dynasty (960 AD –1127 AD) who changed his original surname Qi (祁) to Chu (初) because the then emperor Emperor Zhenzong of Song (968–1022 AD) once called him by the wrong name Chu Wei (初暐).5: Chinese: Cantonese form and alternative Mandarin form of the surnames 朱 and 諸. Also alternative Mandarin form of the surnames 祝 竺 and 竹. See Zhu 1-5.6: Chinese: alternative Mandarin form of the surnames 曲 瞿 屈 鞠 麴 璩 and 渠 see Qu 1-6.7: Chinese: alternative Mandarin form of the surnames 鞠 居 巨 琚 and 劇 see Ju 1-5.8: Chinese: variant Romanization of the surname 祖 see Zu 1.9: Chinese: variant Romanization of the surname 周 see Zhou 1.10: Chinese: variant Romanization of the surname 曹 see Cao 1.11: Chinese: variant Romanization of the surnames 趙 and 招 see Zhao 1 and 2.12: Chinese: variant Romanization of the surnames 邱 and 丘 see Qiu 1 and 2.13: Korean: written 주 in Chinese characters 朱 meaning ‘red’ and 周 meaning ‘round’. There are only these two Chinese characters for the Chu surname in use in Korea. The character 朱 has only one clan associated with it (the Shinan Chu clan) and while some records indicate that the other has as many as 25 only four can be documented; all of these descended from a common ancestor Chu Hwang (周 璜) who was naturalized in 907 after fleeing from civil unrest in Tang China. This family claim to be descended from the ruling family of the Chinese Chu Dynasty. The Shinan Chu clan is descended from a man named Chu Cham (朱 潜) a direct descendant of the Chinese philosopher Chu-tze. Chu Cham migrated from China to Korea some time in the early 13th century. Chu is a fairly common surname and is found throughout the peninsula. Compare Chew 4 Choo 2 Joo 3 Jou 3 Ju 11 and Jue 4.14: Vietnamese: from the Chinese surname 朱 (see Zhu 1).15: Vietnamese (Chử): from the Chinese surname 褚 (see 2 above). Also possibly a variant of Châu (see Chau).\n\nDardis : Irish (Westmeath): possibly a variant of French D'Artois a Norman habitational name for someone from Artois France. Woulfe however suggests this may be a habitational name from the Ards peninsula in County Down which was heavily settled by Normans.\n\nDelisle : 1: French: topographic name with fused preposition de and definite article l' ‘from the’ for someone who lived on an island Old French isle (from Latin insula) or a habitational name for someone from L'Isle or Lisle names of several places in various parts of France named with this word. Compare Delille.2: English (of Norman origin): variant of Lisle (see Lyle).\n\nDiego : Spanish: from the very common male personal name Diego which in the Spanish-speaking world is usually taken to be a shortened form of Santiago. However this may be only a folk etymology. The personal name is found in the Middle Ages in the Latin forms Didacus and Didagus probably a derivative of Greek didachē ‘doctrine teaching’. However in view of the fact that this personal name is unknown outside the Iberian Peninsula it may actually have a pre-Roman origin.\n\nEngel : 1: German Dutch and Danish: from a short form of various ancient Germanic personal names (see for example Engelbert and Engelhard). A number of different elements have fallen together in Engel- mainly Ingal extended form of Ing the name of an ancient Germanic god or folk hero and Angel ‘Angle’. The Angles were an ancient Germanic tribe living on the Jutland peninsula; in the 5th–6th centuries they invaded eastern and northern Britain and gave their name to England (Old English Englaland ‘land of the Angles’).2: German and Dutch: topographic or habitational name referring to a house bearing the sign of an angel Middle High German engel. This surname in both possible senses (see also 1 above) is also found in France (Alsace and Lorraine).3: English (London): of German or Dutch origin (see 1 and 2 above) or a variant of Ingle.4: Jewish (Ashkenazic): artificial name from German Engel ‘angel’ (see 2 above).\n\nFortey : from one or more of the numerous minor places so called such as the lost Forty Green in Hanley Castle (Worcs) which is recorded thus in 1789 Forthay in North Nibley (Gloucs) recorded as la Fortheye in 1248 Forty Hill in Enfield (Middx) recorded as Fortyehill Fortye Green in 1610 The Forty in Cricklade (Wilts) recorded as Vorty in 1841 and Forty Green in Epping (Essex) recorded as Forteye in the 13th century. The place-names derive from Old English *forð-ēg ‘island or peninsula which projects (into surrounding marshland or low-lying ground)’ a compound of forð ‘forward’ + ēg ‘island’.\n\nFu : Chinese:: 1: Mandarin and Cantonese form of the surname 傅 meaning ‘master’ or ‘teacher’ in Chinese: (i) said to be borne by descendants of Fu Yue (傅說)(died c. 1246 BC) a prime minister during the Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BC) who is said to have lived in a place called Fu Yan (傅岩) possibly located in Shanxi province.

(ii) borne by descendants of Fu Jia (扶嘉) who was endowed with the surname Fu (扶) by the Emperor Gaozu of Han (256–195 BC) because of his support to the royal family of the Western Han dynasty (206 BC–25 AD). (iii) adopted as the surname by the Qi Fu (乞扶) family from the Xianbei ethnic group in northern China during the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534 AD).5: Mandarin form of the surname 伏 meaning ‘dog days’ or ‘subdue’ in ancient Chinese: (i) said to be borne by descendants of Fu Xi (伏羲) a legendary figure prior to the Xia dynasty (2070–1600 BC).

Also Cantonese form of the surname 扈. See Hu 1 and 2.\n\nFurness : 1: English: habitational name from the district on the south coast of Cumbria (formerly in Lancashire) earlier Futharnes so named from the genitive case (Futhar) of Old Norse Futh meaning ‘rump’ the name of the peninsula formerly of an island opposite the southern part of this district + Old Norse nes ‘headland nose’.2: English (of Norman origin): occasionally perhaps a variant of Furneaux (see Furnace 2). The two names were sometimes confused.3: Norwegian: old variant of Furnes (and in North America probably also an altered form of this) a habitational name from any of various farms particularly in Møre og Romsdal named Furnes from Old Norse fura ‘pine’ + nes ‘headland’.\n\nGianakos : Greek: patronymic from Giannis a vernacular form of the personal name Iōannēs (see John) + the suffix -akos which is particularly associated with the Mani Peninsula in southwestern Peloponnese.\n\nHam : 1: English (mainly southwestern) and German: variant of Hamm.2: Dutch: topographic name from ham ‘land in a river bend’ ‘enclosed meadow’ or a habitational name from any of several country houses and places called De(n) Ham. Compare Van Ham and Vanderham.3: French: habitational name from any of various places in northern France (Ardennes Pas-de-Calais Somme Moselle) named with the ancient Germanic word ham ‘meadow in the bend of a river water meadow flood plain’.4: Hungarian (Hám) Slovak (also Hám) and Croatian: nickname or occupational name from Hungarian hám (Croatian ham) ‘harness’. Alternatively it may be of German origin (see Hamm).5: Slovenian: perhaps a nickname from the interjection ham ‘bite grab’. Alternatively it may be from dialect ham ‘harness’ (see 4 above) or of German origin (see Hamm).6: Czech (also Hám): from a short form of the personal name Abraham.7: Korean: there is only one Chinese character for the Ham surname. Some sources report that there are sixty different Ham clans but only the Kangnŭng Ham clan can be documented. Although some records have been lost and a few generations are unaccounted for it is known that the founding ancestor of the Ham clan is Ham Kyu a Koryŏ general who fought against the Mongol invaders in the thirteenth century. His ancestor Ham Hyŏk was a Tang Chinese general who stayed in Korea after Tang China helped Shilla unify the peninsula during the seventh century. Another of Ham Hyŏk's ancestors Ham Shin accompanied Kim Chu-wŏn the founding ancestor of the Kangnŭng Kim family to the Kangnŭng area and hence the Ham clan became the Kangnŭng Ham clan. The first prominent ancestor from Kangnŭng whose genealogy can be verified is Ham Kyu the Koryŏ general. Accordingly he is regarded as the Kangnŭng Ham clan's founding ancestor. Compare Hahm 2.8: Chinese: Cantonese form of the surname 咸 see Xian 2.9: Chinese: Cantonese form of the surname 闞 see Kan 1.10: Chinese: variant Romanization of the surname 范 see Fan 1.11: Chinese: variant Romanization of the surname 譚 see Tan 1.12: Chinese: possibly from Cantonese form of the Chinese name 涵 (meaning ‘contain’) a monosyllabic personal name or part of a disyllabic personal name of some early Chinese immigrants in the US.\n\nHamerston : 1: variant of Hammerton with intrusive -s-. Compare Ursula Hamerton 1567 Georg Hamerston 1674 in IGI (Boston Lincs); Thos Hamerton 1706 Grennel Hammerston 1778 in IGI (Romford Essex). 2: perhaps also a late variant of Humberstone.\n\nHarris : 1: English (southern England and south Wales): from the personal name Harry + genitival -s. This surname is also established in Ireland taken there principally during the Plantation of Ulster. However in some cases particularly in families coming from County Mayo Harris can be an Anglicized form of Gaelic Ó hEarchadha. This surname is also very common among African Americans.2: American shortened and altered form of Greek surnames begining with Cha(r)- such as Chasandrinos (variant of Kassandrinos a habitational name from the Kassandra peninsula of Chalkidiki) and various patronymics from the personal name Charalampos (see Charos). In North America the surname Harris may possibly also originate from a transferred use of the Greek personal (given) name Charis or Harris (shortened forms of Charalampos) as a surname (i.e. as a replacement of the original surname).3: Americanized form of various like-sounding Jewish surnames.\n\nHong : 1: Chinese: Mandarin and Cantonese form of the surname 洪 meaning ‘vast’ in Chinese: (i) adopted in place of another Chinese surname 共 (Gong in Mandarin pinyin). In some families this surname is traced back to Gong Gong (共工) an official during the reign of the legendary Huang Di the ‘Yellow Emperor’ (c. 27th century BC). In other families it is borne by descendants of people from the state of Gong (共) (located in present-day Huixian in Henan province) which was granted to Ji He known as Gong Bo (Earl Gong) a figure during the Western Zhou dynasty (1046–771 BC). For other families it is borne by descendants of Shen Sheng a prince in the state of Jin during the Spring and Autumn Period (770–476 BC) who was given Gong as a posthumous title. His descendants inherited this title as their surname. Later some of his descendants changed the surname to 洪 in order to escape persecution by their enemies. Thus the surname 洪 shares some of the same ancestors with the surname 龔; compare Gong 1.

Although some sources indicate that there are 120 Im clans that use this Chinese character only two of these are documented: the Im clan of Changhŭng and the Im clan of P’ungch’ŏn.

The name of the immigrant who founded the first of these two clans has been lost; but the name of the second is Ku Chon-yu. Members of these two clans can be found throughout the Korean peninsula but 45 percent of them live in Kyŏngsang South province while 20 percent of them live in Seoul and Kyŏnggi province. The founder of the clan that uses the other Ku character was named Ku T’ae-rim. He was an emissary for Tang China on his way to Japan when a storm blew his ship onto the shores of Koguryŏ Korea in 663. He settled in Koguryŏ territory and subsequently held a post in that government. Koguryŏ was a Korean kingdom which existed in the northern part of the Korean peninsula from 37 BC to AD 668. Its territory was incorporated into Shilla when the peninsula was unified in 668. Most of the modern-day members of this clan live in Ch’ungch’ŏng province.

All Pak clans spring from a single semi-mythological ancestor named Pak Hyŏkkŏse (朴 赫; 居世). Before the establishment of the Shilla kingdom the southern tip of the peninsula is said to have been ruled by six elders leaders of the six tribes who inhabited that part of the country. In AD 69 a leader Pak Hyŏkkŏse arrived at the foot of a mountain in Kyŏngju in Kyŏngsang north province. Legend has it that he was inside a golden gourd-shaped egg. When the egg was opened Pak Hyŏkkŏse emerged and after taking a wife (who was borne on the back of a dragon) he established the new Shilla kingdom. The word pak in Korean (박; 朴) can mean either ‘gourd’ or ‘to shine brightly’ and the surname Pak is said to denote either the gourd-shaped egg in which the youth was found or the light that is said to have radiated from his head.

One of the remaining two characters is used by the Wŏlsŏng (or Kyŏngju) Sŏk clan which provided the Shilla kingdom with eight of its 56 kings. Nowadays most members of this clan live in South Korea's Ch’ungch’ŏng South province Chŏlla North province and in the old Shilla capital Kyŏngju located in Kyŏngsang North province.

The Kaesŏng Wang clan which originated in China ruled the Korean peninsula for almost five hundred years as the ruling dynasty of the Koryŏ period (918–1392). There are some indications that the Kaesŏng Wang clan was present in the ancient Chosŏn Kingdom (c. 194 BC). When the Chŏnju Yi clan seized power in 1392 and established the Chosŏn kingdom many of the members of the Kaesŏng Wang clan changed their names and went into hiding to avoid being persecuted by the new ruling dynasty. The Chenam Wang clan is also of Chinese origin.

Aside from a few other Yi families that originated from the Kyŏngju Yi clan most of the other 100 or so clans were formed at the end of the Koryŏ or beginning of the Chosŏn periods. Some Korean Yi families trace their origins back to China. The founder of the Chosŏn Kingdom or Yi Dynasty Yi Sŏng-gye (李 成桂) was a member of the Yi clan from Chŏnju.
