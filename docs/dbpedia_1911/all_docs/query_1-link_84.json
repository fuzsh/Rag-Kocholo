        "text": "All of these things were firmly established by the summer of 1929, when Armstrong was just 28-years-old. If he had tragically died at that point, the above paragraph could still be written verbatim and Armstrong would still be the most towering influence in jazz.\n\nBut Armstrong was much more than a jazz musician; he was a popular artist and entertainer who appealed not just to jazz aficionados, but rather to anyone who regularly listened to music and liked to have a good time. If you were hip, you loved Louis Armstrong. If you were square, you loved Louis Armstrong. He ultimately transcended the world of jazz--something that world never truly forgave him for.\n\nIn fact, some of today’s younger crop of jazz musicians and writers might scoff at Armstrong being called “undisputedly” the most influential figure in jazz; how can that be when every other musician nowadays sounds like John Coltrane? But that’s just in the relatively small realm of jazz. Armstrong’s innovations have been felt in jazz, rock, rhythm and blues, rap and much of the pop music of the last century. Armstrong has never received the credit he deserved as a masterful pop artist, though at almost all times in his career, he was more popular with the general public than in the jazz world. He was the “King of Pop” before Michael Jackson was even born.\n\nArmstrong and Jackson don’t get mentioned together as often as they should. A definitive look at the two was provided by trumpeter Nicholas Payton in his 2012 blogpost, “I Love MJ, but Satchmo was the Original King of Pop.” Payton, the self-proclaimed “Savior of Archaic Pop,” created a stir in 2011 when he denounced the word “jazz” in favor of “Black American Music.” Because he’s not hung up on Armstrong solely a jazz artist, Payton properly places him in a pop context. His entire article should be required reading, but a lengthy excerpt is worthwhile for establishing some context for Armstrong the pop performer, written by one of this century’s finest musicians:\n\n“I love MJ, but I believe Louis Armstrong should be given as much praise, if not more than MJ. Pops was the Original King of Pop. And for clarification, I didn’t flat-out say Pops deserved more praise than MJ, but he is definitely deserving of as much if not more. I’m not discrediting Michael’s accomplishments, I’m just saying Armstrong is the progenitor of the Black, Pop aesthetic. The Black, Pop aesthetic is the American Pop aesthetic….Louis Armstrong was the 1st face of popular Black music, i.e., Pop music, almost 40 years before Michael Jackson was born. I’m not saying Pops was more impactful because he was born before Michael, but because of his specific contributions to the interpretation of the American Popular song….I’m not one for superlatives, but Armstrong’s Hot Five recordings are the most influential records in Pop music. More influential than the Beatles or Michael Jackson put together. On those sides, he developed the whole idea of the virtuoso vocal and instrumental soloist in the Pop idiom. It was his voice that shaped what would become the Popular song….Louis Armstrong was the authentic face of the world’s first Pop aesthetic. He is the architect of the Pop song. Satchmo was the one to galvanize all of these seemingly disparate elements into a singular force of Pop art.”\n\nIt was in 1929 that Armstrong began putting his own stamp on pop tunes like “I Can’t Give You Anything But Love” and “When You’re Smiling” and started appearing in front of a brand new audience every night on Broadway, breaking it up with “Ain’t Misbehavin’” in the revue Connie’s Hot Chocolates. Nationwide touring followed, along with his first appearances in the movies. He was greeted as a sensation in Europe during trips in 1932 and 1933, eventually settling there in 1934.\n\nWhen “The Swing Era” commenced in 1935 (the culmination of the music world catching up with ten years of Armstrong’s innovations), Armstrong returned to the United States and continued to be a popular live attraction, a mainstay on radio and a frequent presence in major motion pictures. But when it came to making records, it was as a pop artist on Jack Kapp’s new budget label, Decca, the label of Bing Crosby, then the biggest star on the planet and an unabashed Armstrong disciple. Armstrong began recording for Decca in 1935 and though he occasionally tested the waters at other labels, it remained his main recording base through 1958. Though Kapp recorded many great jazz artists, his number one goal was to make music for the masses, music that put the melody up front and center. As Maxene Andrews of the Andrews Sisters recalled:\n\n“Decca’s studios in New York City were a long, rectangular room. At the far end was a large picture of an Indian maiden, standing up and holding her hand in the air, as if signaling that she had a question. In the ‘dialogue balloon’ she was asking: ‘Where’s the melody?’ As you were recording at the opposite end, you couldn’t help seeing that question. It was staring you in the face the entire time you were singing. At Decca under Jack Kapp’s insistence, you played and sang the melody, and never mind a whole lot of improvising, or you didn’t record Decca again.”\n\nSuch words were anathema to disciples of pure jazz, who thought spontaneous improvisation was the key to the music’s importance and success. Armstrong, though, was a melody man, and he was at home on Decca recording whatever Kapp threw at him, including current love songs like “I’m in the Mood for Love” and “Once in a While,” novelties such as “Old Man Mose” and collaborations with everyone from Sidney Bechet and the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra to the Mills Brothers and Andy Iona and His Polynesians. Kapp even let Armstrong record flagwavers like “Swing That Music” and “Struttin’ With Some Barbecue,” New Orleans-styled treatments of spirituals “When the Saints Go Marching In” and “Bye and Bye” and up-to-date remakes of 1920s specialties such as “West End Blues,” “Hear Me Talkin’ to Ya” and “Our Monday Date.” Armstrong and Decca were a perfect match, especially when one considers Armstrong’s aversion towards placing his music in categories. “We play good music, if it fits any kind,” he told the Voice of America in 1956. “There are no styles. That’s the worst thing in the world. It ruined so many musicians when all these styles come up.” Armstrong’s 1935-46 Decca output proved it was impossible to pigeonhole Armstrong stylistically.\n\nBut a new breed of jazz fan, who might have disagreed with Armstrong’s views, cropped up in the 1930s: the hot record collector. These die-hard fans fell in love with the hot jazz of the 1920s, but much of that music was now out-of-print a decade later. Some collectors wanted to do something about this. Two such men later played a great part in shaping Armstrong’s recording career: Milt Gabler and George Avakian. Gabler, the proprietor of the famed Commodore Music Shop in New York City, started his own label, United Hot Clubs of America, in the mid-30s specifically to reissue out-of-print jazz classics, including early Armstrong appearances with King Oliver and a variety of blues singers. It was the first label devoted solely to releasing reissues of older music.\n\nA few years later, Avakian, while a student at Yale, wrote to Columbia Records about having them release material such as Armstrong’s 1920s recordings, which had become hard-to-find. Columbia responded by giving the 22-year-old Avakian a job producing what became the “Hot Jazz Classics” series, the first time jazz reissues were assembled in album form. Avakian’s first volume was King Louis, a collection of Armstrong’s Hot Five recordings released in 1940.\n\nImmediately upon release, the 1940 Armstrong had to compete with the 1928 Armstrong in the jazz press. Writers such as Rudi Blesh and Paul Edward Miller advanced a narrative that Armstrong had been a serious musician devoted to instrumental jazz in the 1920s but now, as Miller wrote in 1941, “Creatively and artistically, Armstrong is dead….Armstrong has chosen to play exclusively for the box office, has assumed a downright commercial attitude. Therein lies Armstrong’s failure.” In some circles, this narrative became the norm, echoed by James Lincoln Collier in his idiotic, mean-spirited 1983 autobiography, Louis Armstrong: An American Genius, which found The author lamenting, “I cannot think of another American artist who so failed his own talent.”\n\nBecause such wrong-headed assessments were assumed to be fact by so many wrong-headed individuals for so many decades (Collier’s book was released to generally positive, agreeable reviews in the 1980s), Armstrong’s overall reputation has suffered in the jazz community. He’s acknowledged as a great innovator who wrote the rules of jazz but scant attention is paid to his post-1928 output. Finding young musicians today who are directly inspired by Armstrong is not easy and those who are, get relegated to the perceived “underground” that is the traditional jazz world, unable to get any serious media attention compared to young musicians inspired by other long-gone legends like John Coltrane and Charlie Parker. Reissues of Armstrong’s music never get the same recognition as reissues of music by Coltrane or Miles Davis. And across the country, college students are getting jazz performance degrees and never checking out Armstrong in their studies. As clarinetist Dennis Lichtman recently asked me, could anyone imagine getting a degree in religious studies--and never checking out Jesus? (“New Testament is where it’s at, I never bothered with the Old Testament….”)\n\nBut maybe this is all because Armstrong became more than just a jazz musician. 1929 was the same year that OKeh moved his recordings from the “Race” series to the “Popular” series. One could argue that it was at this point that he became a full-time pop artist, infusing everything he did with his jazz sensibilities and swinging rhythm, but perfectly comfortable side-by-side with Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole and other giants of the pop field.\n\nFor example, in 1932, pure hot jazz was found in records by the likes of The Rhythmmakers with Henry Red Allen or Sidney Bechet’s New Orleans Feetwarmers, small groups that created torrid music. That same year, Armstrong was recording with a big band, aping Guy Lombardo’s signature syrupy reed sound and covering Bing Crosby tunes “Love You Funny Thing” and “Lawd You Made the Night Too Long.” In 1938, when Count Basie was loosening up the feel of the rhythm section and Lester Young’s lighter-than-air solos were paving the way for modern jazz, Armstrong was recording spirituals with Lyn Murray’s mixed choir for Decca and singing “Jeepers Creepers” to a horse in the film Going Places. When Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie exploded onto the scene with the complex sounds of bebop in 1945, Armstrong was scoring a hit with a cover of a recent rhythm and blues ballad, “I Wonder,” appearing in the film Pillow to Post with Ida Lupino and Sydney Greenstreet and backing up the era’s biggest sensation, Frank Sinatra, on a radio broadcast version of “Blue Skies.” Armstrong was always bigger than jazz but it was the jazz world that turned its back on him when it perceived him getting too big, unwilling to conform to their limited definition of what is and isn’t jazz.\n\nInterestingly, Gabler and Avakian, the two main pioneers of reissuing music from jazz’s past, never were content to simply look backwards. Both men eventually went from producing reissues to producing new music by living, breathing musicians, each becoming iconic producers in the process. Gabler started his own Commodore Records in 1938, devoted to the hot, small group swing favored by Eddie Condon’s mob, but he also recorded the Kansas City Six with Lester Young, the Chocolate Dandies with Benny Carter and Coleman Hawkins, Billie Holiday’s “Strange Fruit” and other timeless artists of that fertile era. His success with Commodore led Decca to come calling in 1941, hiring him to produce more pop singles instead of just the strictly jazz content of Commodore. Gabler proved to have incredible ears--and trend-setting tastes--as he soon began churning out hits featuring everyone from Lionel Hampton (“Flying Home”) and Billie Holiday (“Lover Man”) to the Andrews Sisters (“Rum and Coca Cola”) and Louis Jordan (“Choo Choo Ch’Boogie”). He stayed with the label until 1971.\n\n(It should also be mentioned that George Avakian stuck with Columbia, eventually heading their Pop Album department and like Gabler, was at home producing jazz sides by Duke Ellington, Kid Ory and Miles Davis, but was also comfortable overseeing recordings by Johnny Mathis, Frankie Yankovic and Ravi Shankar. Maybe Gabler and Avakian got along so well with Armstrong because they all had big ears and listened to more than just jazz.)\n\nThough Gabler joined Decca in 1941, he didn’t get to record “his champ,” as he referred to Armstrong in the 1989 documentary, Satchmo, until 1944, mostly because of the recording ban of 1942. And when he did record Armstrong’s big band, he was unsatisfied with the results, feeling the band was too exhausted after a grueling stretch of performances at army camps. Gabler could only record three sides and rejected them all at the time. He learned it would be more beneficial to attempt to record Armstrong when he was rested--not an easy thing to do--and without his ragged band of the period.\n\nThus, in January 1945, Gabler had bassist Bob Haggart put together a studio band to back Armstrong on a cover of the current rhythm and blues smash, “I Wonder,” in addition to a topical new song with an R&B groove, “Jodie Man.” The result was a hit record for Armstrong, the Pittsburgh Courier reporting that 75,000 copies were sold immediately.\n\nFor some reason, Decca didn’t record another Armstrong session until one year later in January 1946 when again, Gabler had Haggart arranging a date that teamed Armstrong with another popular Decca vocalist, Ella Fitzgerald. The resulting record, “You Won’t Be Satisfied” backed with “The Frim Fram Sauce,” was a jukebox hit and received good reviews, with critics applauding Gabler’s idea of pairing the two great artists.\n\nBut that same month, Armstrong also recorded two sides for RCA Victor. Joe Glaser must have grown frustrated that Decca had only released one single between April 1942 and January 1946, while they were pumping out hits by the likes of Fitzgerald and Louis Jordan after the ban was lifted. Just like that, the association with Decca that had gone back to 1935 was over.\n\nUnfortunately for Armstrong--and Glaser--RCA Victor didn’t have a great gameplan to showcase the trumpeter either. Armstrong’s big band during these years was one of his brassiest, bordering on unpleasant at times, and though the label made a few good records like “Back O’Town Blues” and “It Takes Time,” most of the band’s output for the new label consisted of forgettable performances of forgettable material.\n\nIn May 1947, Armstrong’s fortunes changed when a wildly successful evening fronting a star-studded small group at New York’s Town Hall led Glaser to lay off the big band and put Armstrong at the helm of a sextet, Louis Armstrong and His All Stars. RCA Victor released an album of six sides from the Town Hall concert and made two small group sessions with Armstrong that year. Though the results were artistically more satisfying than the label’s big band recordings, they didn’t yield any hit records. Jazz fans who cheered when Armstrong returned to his small band roots might have approved and turned the All Stars into a popular live attraction, but in a post-Swing Era world, such fans made up a small portion of the record-buying public, who were then going for tunes by the likes of Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Vaughn Monroe and Frankie Laine.\n\nWorse, yet another recording ban hit the industry at the end of 1947, lasting through the following year. With no new records being made and the two-year RCA Victor contract coming to an end, Glaser decided to jump ship and return his client to Decca in September 1949. “I got to love the man, but he was rough! King of his domain, that agency he had,” Gabler told Dan Morgenstern. “But Glaser liked me, I’m pretty sure. He said, ‘I give Louis to you for half the price of everybody else.’ I felt they were not doing the right stuff for Louis. At one point, Glaser was getting a $50,000 advance an album. I paid $25,000.”\n\nGabler was now in charge of recording Armstrong full-time, promising to release a steady stream of singles beginning in late 1949. Glaser had only one demand. “Glaser never asked to see the material,” Gabler said. “He used to say, ‘Give him a Top Ten hit!’ That’s what he wanted...and pop music….And the Decca sales organization, the loved Louis, but they also wanted pop tunes, or a plug tune. In those days, you had more than one record of a song when a publisher really worked on it, and as soon as Louis would make a pop tune, his record would go on all the coin machines immediately. And get air play.”\n\nGabler hit upon the winning formula of studying the Billboard charts and selecting current hits that would be appropriate for Armstrong to cover. Though Armstrong’s versions never supplanted the original hits on the charts, the passage of time has been kinder to Armstrong’s unique and timeless takes on this material. Though George Avakian chose not to make these types of records with Armstrong, he couldn’t help but admire Gabler’s methods and Armstrong’s results. “Milt Gabler was a terrific record producer, and he adored Armstrong,” Avakian told Michael Jarrett. “He did a great mixture of productions, and one of the things that he did very successfully was to have Louis cover other people’s hits rather quickly, like ‘Because of You,’ Tony Bennett. Louis’s version of ‘Cold Cold Heart’ [1951], the Hank Williams song, was unexpected, but it was done very well. Louis was probably the most successful cover artist of all time, though we never thought of him that way.”\n\nNeedless to say, to the pure jazz fans and writers who felt the formation of the All Stars to be a giant step forward, the Decca pop singles covering the hits of Hank Williams and Tony Bennett were treated as two giant steps back. A fairly overheated review of “A Kiss to Build a Dream On” and “I Get Ideas”--Armstrong’s best-selling Decca single--by disc-jockey Frenchy Sartell in England’s Musical Express gives an idea of how some critics received the music on this set. Titled “Louis Armstrong--Crooner! How Commercial Can One Get?” Sartell wrote:\n\n\"My blood is boiling, my ire is aroused. How dare they do it to my favourite jazz 'great'? How dare they bury him in commercialism? ...I've heard 'Pops' play and sing plenty of commercial numbers, but they've been materially suited to his inimitable style, and he has always been able to give his own feeling to them. Take Armstrong, put him in front of another orchestra leader's ensemble, give him a current pop tune and you'll find it's a very different story. If you don't let Louis have his own say, it's like tying his hands behind his back. Armstrong MUST create his own atmosphere. He's not a man who can be told what to do and how to do it.”\n\nSartell used the dreaded c-word--”commercial”--that would dog Armstrong during these years. He bristled at word any time it was mentioned in his presence. In September 1952, Armstrong sat down with disc jockey Sid Gross for an interview on Gross’s radio program, “International Jazz Club.” Armstrong had just recorded a cover of Sunny Gale’s pop hit, “I Laughed at Love” and Gross received a promotional copy he was about to debut on air--but not before sticking his foot in his mouth, daring to insinuate that Armstrong actually wanted his records to sell!\n\nGross: It’s a commercial approach but at the same time, I believe this is the first, shall I say, commercial record I’ve ever had on International Jazz Club.\n\nArmstrong: Could I interrupt there? What is the meaning of commercial and why do you use that expression, commercial?\n\nGross: Well, I use it in the sense that it is perhaps designed to sell records rather than not to sell them. It’s not purely aesthetic.\n\nArmstrong: Yeah, but sometimes that hurts a tune when they use that phrase. You take a guy that wants to be hip to the tip and he say, “That guy’s commercial,” you know, you’re about calling that guy a dirty name, in a way of saying. Why don’t you say just a good musician or a good swing man or someone that plays music period. A musician ain’t supposed to just play one type of music. When they ask me, say, “Why do you play, “Cold, Cold, Heart,” why do you play this?” I play anything where I come from.\n\nGross: Let me say then that it’s not jazz in the accepted word or meaning which I use when I play jazz on the “International Jazz Club.” Let me put it that way.\n\nArmstrong: Well, what makes you say that? Take tunes like “St. James Infirmary,” which goes down in history, everybody okays that as one of the numbers. Well, that’s an ordinary tune like this “I Laughed at Love,” it just was made Negroid and torrid. You see what I mean? So now if you just analyze “I Laughed at Love” there ain’t nothing can outswing it.\n\nGross: Oh, it’s a great, it’s a great swing thing. I like it!\n\nArmstrong: Well, that alone, look at nothing but swing lead. That’s your key right there. That’s jazz, don’t care what you’re playing. ‘Cavalleria Rusticana.’ If you’re expressing yourself and you can make that foot move, just pat lightly, you’re swinging. So just because it’s a late number, they call it commercial.\n\nArmstrong summed up his feelings by telling Gross, “Every tune’s hot until you make it otherwise, Pops. Don’t let anyone use that commercial on you. That word commercial, that ruined a lot of tunes, you’d be surprised.”\n\nMore important to Armstrong than the notes or chord changes was his ability to personally connect with the pop material Gabler handed him. Looking back at his career in 1965, the height of his post-”Hello, Dolly!” fame, Armstrong told Richard Meryman, “I guess it’s possible there’s people who wish I’d just play like the old days in Chicago….Those records aren't why I'm popular today. More people know me since ‘Hello, Dolly!’ than ever. And all my biggest hits are things like ‘Mack the Knife’ and ‘Blueberry Hill.’ But all songs display my life somewhat, and you got to be thinking and feeling about something as you watch them notes and phrase that music--got to see the life of the song. ‘Blueberry Hill,’ that could be some chick I ain’t seen for twenty years, which chick, who cares. ‘Mack the Knife,’ I seen many a cat in New Orleans lying around with a knife to slip in your back and take your money. And I think of that, even if the songs is so commercified.”\n\nThe times had changed and Armstrong had changed with them. He loved his vaunted 1920s recordings but even looking back on those, he saw room for improvement. In 1951, Armstrong made a private tape with some friends in Chicago, listening to the music of the Hot Five. During the vocal on 1926’s “Irish Black Bottom,” the 1951 Armstrong quietly starts humming along with the verse. But when it comes to the chorus, the 1951 Armstrong shouts, \"Here's the lead!\" and starts emphatically scatting the written melody over the 1926 Louis's shouted vocal on the record. He continues for the entire chorus, sounding quite animated. He probably hadn't performed it in 25 years but every note of the original melody was firmly entrenched in his brain.\n\nAfter scatting, Armstrong again moans, “That's the lead!” before imparting some self-critical analysis: “In those days, we sang just what you call ‘obligato,’ you know? And we commenced to hollering, ‘Where's the melody?’ See? First thing you see when you walk in the Decca studio, chick with her hair down to her asshole, hollering ‘Where's the melody?’ holding both of her hands out. Just like I say, we'll take this number….” At this point, 1951 Armstrong catches 1926 Armstrong playing the melody on the record and shouts, “There's the lead” before listening to it in silence to the end.\n\nIt’s a fascinating little insight because many writers and listeners--including myself--love listening to Armstrong's wild 1920s vocals and marveling at the chances he took with the written melodies. But here's Armstrong in the 1950s, made uncomfortable by his younger self, calling that vocal style nothing but an \"obligato\" and recalling the advice from the famed Native American photograph Jack Kapp plastered around the Decca studios: “Where’s the melody?” Armstrong had matured and wasn’t interested in playing and singing exactly like he did when he a young man. The results spoke for themselves as Armstrong’s run of Decca singles contain some of his all-time best-known music, recordings that are still tremendously popular to this day.\n\nBut even with the popularity of his Decca work, Armstrong still had trouble reaching African-American audiences. When he began recording for Decca again in 1949, the label was still reaping the rewards of rhythm and blues giant, Louis Jordan. Armstrong and Jordan had recorded a few of the same numbers for Decca in the early 40s (“Do You Call That a Buddy,” “You Run Your Mouth, I’ll Run My Business”) but those songs always seemed better tailored to Jordan. RCA Victor gave him some R&B-type numbers, too, in 1946 and 1947 and those didn’t take off either. Armstrong had always connected with romantic material with strong melodies and that's what he'd continue to record for Decca beginning in 1949.\n\nArmstrong was still popular in the African-American community in the late 40s, but that started to changed as the 1950s began and Armstrong started to be viewed by some not as a musical genius but rather as an Uncle Tom who mugged too much for white audiences.\n\n“There was something about Armstrong that seemed to be a certain kind of shadow, a certain kind of minstrelsy,” African-American cultural critic Gerald Early said in Ken Burns’ Jazz. “And I believe it made a lot of black people uncomfortable. Then too, his music, he had made certain kinds of adaptations in his music for popular taste but not significant adaptations in his music for black popular taste. Armstrong just really didn’t seem to be speaking to that community anymore and I believe that’s why he had such trouble with black people in the 50s and 60s.”\n\nThis gets into all sorts of issues that are probably best set aside for another essay, but a few points should be addressed here. Early’s point is valid but the question is what could Armstrong had done from a purely musical perspective--eliminating his mugging and stage persona--to adapt to “black popular taste”? If anything, Armstrong’s Decca singles paved the way for the success of Motown the following decade. Like Berry Gordy’s incredible stable of black talent, Armstrong used the quintessential “black” elements of jazz, an African-American creation--including his swing feel, his virtuosic trumpet solos, his scatting, his rephrasing of vocal melodies, his affinity for the blues--and applied them to the “white” pop sound of the era, including the use of strings and choirs. In 2009, Gordy said,” I wanted songs for the whites, blacks, the Jews, Gentiles, the cops and the robbers. I wanted everybody to enjoy my music.” So did Armstrong.\n\nArmstrong is usually called out and criticized for not adapting enough for black popular taste, but what about Ella Fitzgerald recording the Cole Porter songbook? Miles Davis recording “The Surrey with the Fringe on Top”? Oscar Peterson playing Django Reinhardt’s “Nuages” at the Stratford Shakespearean Festival? Charlie Parker with strings? Were those artists adapting to “black popular taste”?\n\nNo, but that’s the bigger point: jazz in general didn’t adapt to shifts in the kinds of music African-Americans wanted to hear beginning in the 1940s. The standard history of jazz tells us that swing led to bebop and from there, cool jazz, hard bop, modal jazz, free jazz and avant-garde followed. But in the African-American community, swing led to bebop, and most African-Americans fled from those sounds to the more danceable rhythm-and-blues and eventually rock ‘n’ roll, supporting Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Sam Cooke, etc. Cooke is another artist, like Michael Jackson, who never gets mentioned alongside Armstrong. Cooke was absolutely beloved in the African-American community, the definition of \"black popular taste\" of the era, but by the end of his tragically short life, he was performing and recording songs like \"Bill Bailey\" and \"Frankie and Johnny\" in front of a mostly white audience at the Copa, a place Armstrong had previously performed at. When asked to name his favorite singers in 1964, who did Cooke name? Louis Armstrong. Soul singer Bobby Womack told Jake Feinberg that Cooke once told him, \"You know who I try to sound like? I know you're going to think I'm crazy: Louie Armstrong. Bobby, he projects, it's not like he's singing a song on the beat. he would just say something [scat sings], 'Da da-da da da, be de da de lo,' like he's talking to you. Take his voice away and listen to my voice and you'll hear the same thing.\" Armstrong's impact on Cooke and those other popular black R&B, rock and soul artists of the 50s and 60s is immeasurable.\n\nLouis Armstrong was Louis Armstrong; he paved the way for each of those artists, but he stayed true to his own original style and didn’t feel the need to conform to the sounds of R&B and rock. Even when Decca nudged him in that direction in 1955, he did it on his own terms and without resorting to the electric guitars of Chuck Berry or the screaming vocals of Little Richard. Fitzgerald, Davis, Peterson, Parker and much of the rest of the jazz world of the 1950s didn’t show any particular concern with adapting to black popular taste but it was Armstrong whose reputation suffered the most, again, mostly because of non-musical issues.\n\n(Fitzgerald’s recording situation was actually the closest to Armstrong’s as she recorded a similar run of pop and jazz material for Decca at the same time as Armstrong. Yet the narrative in jazz circles is Norman Granz had to “rescue” her from Gabler in order to concentrate on jazz-centric recordings and the songbook series instead of any more pop records. Like Armstrong, Fitzgerald seemed perfectly happy making pop recordings for Decca. Nat Hentoff once wrote, “Left to herself, I think you would find Ella would pick many more of the pop hits of the day than she would material better suited to jazz.” He could have said the same about Armstrong.)\n\nArmstrong wasn’t about to change his persona either, mostly because he was just as gregarious and fun-loving offstage as he was on. The only thing that made him bristle more than being called “commercial” was being called a “clown.” When an interviewer in England in 1959 referred to Armstrong frequently being criticized for clowning, Armstrong responded, “I know, but how many people enjoy the clowning, you know? See, the majority rules in my plan, that’s what I go by. You can’t please everybody, but if you can please the majority, don’t worry ‘bout them few, you know. They probably don’t like anything….Well, if they say clowning, what is clowning? Anything to make the people get a little laugh, to put humor in your program and the note still comes out, that’s not clowning. Clowning’s when you can’t play nothing. And always remember that. So I don’t think that’s such a cute phrase.”\n\nArmstrong had superb comic timing and was a marvelous actor, something he shows off on some of these Decca singles. And the facial expressions he made onstage were not an act; he made the same faces in the quiet recording studio, as can be seen in a film acquired by the Louis Armstrong House Museum showing Armstrong recording the album Satchmo Plays King Oliver in 1959, and going through all the motions as if he was onstage in front of a thousand people. He knew that that was his way to connect with the material and that the listening public would be able to tell if he was just going through the motions. He was nothing but authentic at all times.\n\nIncredibly, these Decca singles have never been assembled together in a single package such as this one, not in the LP era, not on CD, not from Mosaic Records or any other label. It’s the first time a listener can hear the “A” side followed by the “B” side in the original way Decca released these tracks. And on these sides, you'll hear a little bit of everything:\n\n*All the big hits: “That Lucky Old Sun,” “Blueberry Hill,” “La Vie En Rose,” “A Kiss to Build a Dream On,” “I Get Ideas” and more.\n\n*Unvarnished, exciting playing by the All Stars in 1950 doing many New Orleans favorites.\n\n*Updated takes on songs from the early days such as “When It’s Sleepy Time Down South,” “Big Butter and Egg Man,” “Them There Eyes,” “When You’re Smiling,” “Basin Street Blues” and more.\n\n*Two songs written by country music king Hank Williams.\n\n*Religious songs from Louis and the Good Book.\n\n*A song of South African origin, “Skokiaan.”\n\n*Multiple tangos from Argentina.\n\n*Six Christmas songs and one, “Spooks!,” that could be Halloween anthem.\n\n*Touches of rhythm and blues and early rock and roll on “Ko Ko Mo” and “Only You.”\n\n*Duets with Louis Jordan, Ella Fitzgerald, Velma Middleton, Jack Teagarden and both Crosbys, Bing and Gary.\n\n*Armstrong surrounded by his All Stars, with a big band, with strings, with a choir.*Arrangements by Sy Oliver, Gordon Jenkins, Tutti Camarata, Jack Pleiss, Benny Carter and Sonny Burke.\n\n*Selections from the monumental Satchmo: A Musical Autobiography, which found the older Armstrong often topping his younger self on a series of stirring remakes of old favorites.*And much, much more.\n\nMost of all, the material on this set should stand as a tribute to not only Louis Armstrong but to Milt Gabler. Not only did he offer intelligent song choices and inspired settings but he always took his time recording Armstrong, getting a remarkably clear quality out of Armstrong’s voice and always capturing nothing but fantastic trumpet playing, mostly because he knew how to pace Armstrong’s chops. Where later producers like Norman Granz would try to record an entire album in a single day, taxing Armstrong’s lips terribly, Gabler usually recorded two or four songs in a session, sometimes only having Armstrong play on a few of the selections. Thus, Armstrong’s trumpet playing is consistently brilliant in this Decca period, hopefully putting to rest the notion that his best days were far behind him and that he nothing more than a comic singer. As already mentioned, I feel Armstrong should stand side-by-side with the pop giants of this time like Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby and Peggy Lee, but unlike them, when he stopped singing, he picked up that horn and made miraculous sounds each and every time the mouthpiece hit his lips. Double the genius in one human being.\n\nBelow are descriptions of each single as they were released, complete with context, some analysis and quotes from contemporaries reviews. In my previous writings on this music, I tended to lean on the jazz periodicals, most of which had something negative to say about Armstrong’s Decca sides. But in preparing this essay, I leaned heavily on Billboard’s archives, available through Google. Billboard was the Bible of the music industry, charting record sales, radio plays, jukebox popularity and everything in between. Their unnamed reviewers paid attention to all of Armstrong’s singles and usually met them with raves. I had never really thought about it until now but a lot of these reviewers were getting the dreck of early 50s pop, trying to get excited about the latest offerings from Dick Haymes or Patti Page or Georgia Gibbs or Mitch Miller--and then along comes an Armstrong cover of a pop tune and it sounds completely different, completely fresh, completely swinging, just as it did when he released his versions of the pop tunes of the late 20s and 1930s. On the other hand, the jazz critics of the time were getting deeper into listening to challenging music by Charlie Parker and Lennie Tristano and Thelonious Monk. They’d hear Louis Armstrong with Gordon Jenkins singing a pretty tune like “It’s All in the Game” and think, “What the hell is this?” But in the pop world, Armstrong’s singles were welcomed with open arms.\n\nMaybe that’s because the greatest jazz artist of them all was really a pop star. He put 100% of himself in each of these Decca singles and the public responded. They still respond. The majority still rules.\n\nMaybe It’s Because / I’ll Keep the Lovelight Burning\n\nLouis Armstrong (tp, voc), Buck Clayton, Ivor Lloyd (tp), Henderson Chambers (tb), George Dorsey, Artie Baker (as), Budd Johnson, Freddie Williams (ts), Horace Henderson (p), Everett Barksdale (g), Joe Benjamin (b), Wallace Bishop (d), Sy Oliver (cond, arr).\n\nDecca 24751\n\nRecorded September 1, 1949, New York City\n\nFor Armstrong’s first Decca session since January 1946, Gabler selected two current songs, “Maybe It’s Because,” a hit for Dick Haymes and “I’ll Keep the Lovelight Burning,” made popular by Patti Page. Gabler selected Sy Oliver to write the arrangements for Armstrong, the first of many times he’d get the call, though Oliver was certainly not a stranger to Louis, having backed him on trumpet with Zack Whyte’s band in 1930 and later writing occasional arrangements, such as “I Never Knew,” for his big band. Oliver truly loved working with Armstrong, as can be glimpsed in this Paul Studer photograph of a Decca session from 1957:\n\nOliver assembled a friendly, all-star crew for the occasion, including familiar associates such as Budd Johnson, Buck Clayton, Henderson Chambers and Fletcher Henderson’s brother, pianist Horace Henderson. One new face was bassist Joe Benjamin, who told Downbeat in 1970, “I always liked Louis Armstrong. You listen as a youngster and all of a sudden you’re an adult. And then one day you find yourself in a Decca recording studio with him and find he’s one of the nicest people on this earth.”\n\nOf the two sides, I’ve always felt “I’ll Keep the Lovelight Burning” to be something of a minor classic. The vocal is full of Crosby-isms and some sublime scatting, while the trumpet solo is fiery one--dig those closing repeated high notes! And don’t miss that “Oh yeah” ending, the first time Armstrong ended a studio recording with what would become one of his indelible trademarks.\n\nBillboard wasn’t tremendously impressed with “I’ll Keep the Lovelight Burning,” writing “Louis doesn’t quite warm to his material here,” but they recognized what Gabler was trying to do: “Decca here applies its old formula of the Armstrong heyday: a sweet pop, a big band and Pops blowing and singing in his inimitable style.” Billboard thought “Maybe It’s Because” was more on the mark, describing it as “eminently congenial to the warm Armstrong treatment.” They were right about “Maybe It’s Because” being a fine side--Dick Haymes sure couldn’t pull off an opening “Mmmmmm” like Louis does here--but this coupling never made a dent in the charts and didn’t exactly usher in the second Decca era with a bang.\n\nFor that, though, they’d have to just wait five more days….\n\nThat Lucky Old Sun / Blueberry Hill\n\nLouis Armstrong (voc), Billy Butterfield, Carl Poole, Yank Lawson (tp), Will Bradley (tb), Milt Yaner, Hymie Schertzer (as), Tom Parshley, Art Drelinger (ts), Bernie Leighton (p), Carl Kress (g), Jack Lesberg (b), Johnny Blowers (d), Unknown female choir (voc), Gordon Jenkins (cond, arr).\n\nDecca 24752\n\nRecorded September 6, 1949, New York City\n\nIn many ways, this is the true beginning of Armstrong’s second reign as a Decca pop artist. Gabler had the brilliant idea to team Armstrong with arranger Gordon Jenkins, then at the peak of his popularity. Nowadays, Jenkins is best known for his emotional string writing on songs sung by everyone from Frank Sinatra to Nat King Cole to Harry Nilsson. But in 1949--smack dab in the middle of the period between the end of jazz as America’s popular music and the start of rock and roll--Jenkins was it.In the July 16, 1950 issue of Billboard, Jenkins was named the number one “Top Selling Popular Artist Over Retail Counters,” with 12 recent hit records to his name.\n\n“Everyone wanted to work with Gordy, and as you look back, he was making history back then,” Gabler remembered. “He’s the one who brought background vocals into combination with musicians. The Armstrong sessions typified that.”\n\nIndeed, Jenkins chose to leave his signature strings at home, instead bringing a choir to the September 6, 1949. In a daring move, either Gabler or Jenkins--or both--decided Armstrong should leave his trumpet at home, too. This session would spotlight the gorgeous combination of Armstrong’s warm, gravelly voice and Jenkins’s dramatic singers.\n\nJenkins worshipped Armstrong and was overwhelmed when he saw Armstrong at the session. “I cracked up,” he said. “I walked into the studio, looked over there, saw Louis and broke down. Cried so hard I couldn’t even see him. Later that night, I came home, and I was so excited I couldn’t eat my dinner. Then I started crying again. I took it pretty big.”\n\nGabler had selected “That Lucky Old Sun” to be the “A” side, a smart choice as it was the song of 1949, a big hit for Frankie Laine that was covered by everyone from Frank Sinatra to Vaughn Monroe (Laine and Monroe’s versions were released simultaneously on August 20, 17 days before Armstrong covered it). Immediately, one can hear a nuance in Armstrong’s vocal stylings that was never better captured until Gabler began recording him regularly in 1949. “That Lucky Old Sun” illustrates Armstrong’s impressive range, but also spotlights his emotional connection to a lyric, singing earnestly without overdoing it. (Also check out Billy Butterfield’s Armstrong-infused trumpet obbligato; legend has it he won a coin toss to get the opportunity to do this over session-mate, and fellow Armstrong worshipper, Yank Lawson.)\n\nFor the flip side, Gabler went back to a forgotten song of 1941, “Blueberry Hill,” originally recorded by “The Singing Cowboy” Gene Autry and recorded by Glenn Miller, among others. No one ever asked Gabler why he chose this eight-year-old song for this date, but it ended up being one of his best calls, as the song fit Armstrong like a glove. Jenkins even went the extra mile to write some special lyrics, which Armstrong debuted in his second chorus. You can hear Armstrong smiling throughout the performance; not only was he connecting with the material, he was inspired by the setting, telling interviewers that the female singers emoting at the end of “Blueberry Hill” took him right back to his days singing in church in New Orleans with his mother, Mayann. “It was easy for me to do that number because it reminded me of the church me my mother used to take me to, Reverend Cozy’s church,” he told Sid Gross in 1953. “It was a Baptist church. Couldn't afford no choir so everybody sang. And that's the way ‘Blueberry Hill’ reminded me of when [sings] ‘I found my thrill’--and all those beautiful voices, that's what it reminded me of.”\n\nIt didn’t take long for the record to start making waves. Billboard listed it as one of “The Billboard Picks” in the “Record Possibilities” section on September 17, just 11 days after it was recorded. “This is an inspired recording--a remarkable mating of talents on a song which is already making its mark via the Frankie Laine etching,” the note read. “Louis, who at 50 is greater than ever, sings the fine song in his gravel-throat voice with tremendous feeling. Jenkins’ backing, a small band with a large choir, sets a perfect contrast and builds a fine production. This etching should give Laine a run for the money.”\n\nAs will be a theme here, it’s interesting that trade magazine for popular music thought Louis was “greater than ever” something that was definitely not the case in the jazz world. The same September 17 issue noted elsewhere, “At Decca, Louis Armstrong, currently packing them in at Bop City, was paired off with Gordon Jenkins, the label’s musical chief and a top pop artist in his own right, for a pair of sides.”\n\nThe Bop City mention is worth exploring. Armstrong spent most of 1949 blasting bebop in the jazz press, saying at a luncheon for the Anglo-American Press Association that Bebop “comes from the sticks. Those kids come to a passage they don’t dare tackle, so they play a thousand notes to get around it. It’s ju-jitsu music. Nothing but squeezing and twisting notes.” Such criticism, made an enemy out of Armstrong to many young musicians--Dizzy Gillespie called him a “plantation character” in Downbeat earlier in 1949--but also to critics and disc jockeys who supported bop.\n\nArmstrong being booked to play New York City’s Bop City, of all places, seemed like a recipe for disaster. On a privately taped conversation in 1953, Armstrong told friends, “All of them sumbitches on Broadway were feeling sorry for us the evening that we opened up there. I said, 'What's wrong with these sumbitches?' They say, 'Well, you know, your style of music and you going into Bop City...' I say, 'So what!? A note's a note in any language. And I'll prove it to you.' And I say, 'The people that's gonna come up there from now on the time we're there, they ain't never looked into the damn place before!' And I proved it to them….Bullshit. Bop City. Just another joint from where we play. Looking forward to them. They thought we was gonna flop all over the place.”\n\nInstead, Armstrong broke Bop City’s box-office records with his small group, the All Stars. “They’re thinking of changing the name of the joint to Pops’ City since Ol’ Satchmo’s half-century-old chops blew up 30 years of ephemeral jazz memories Thursday,” Hal Webmen wrote. “He came out the winner and still king in the territory which has been ascribed to citizens oo-bla-dee. This crowd, which was estimated at over 2,000 persons, mobbed Bop City to pay tribute to and come away enthralled by the artistry and showmanship of Louis Armstrong.”\n\nSuccess didn’t come easy. Jazz critic George T. Simon negatively complained about Armstrong’s showmanship. “At Bop City, he was mugging like mad, putting on the personality, bowing, scraping and generally lowering himself as a human being in the eyes of his worshipers. There is no need for a man as great as Louis to have to resort to such behavior.” Also, popular disc jockey Symphony Sid Torin did his best to sabotage Armstrong’s Bop City run. “And Symphony Sid tried his dandiest to ruin us,” Armstrong said in that private 1953 conversation. “We made an ass out of him. I told my band, I say, ‘Go on. Your first set will make an ass out of Symphony Sid.’ Going ahead, telling them people, ‘Well you might like what’s coming up.’ You know, as if to say, ‘They’re a little corny’ or some shit. You know, cause he's bullshittin' them boppers, taking all their money to go inside until they woke up on him and run his ass out of New York. I could have told them that….You know, I listen to all those cute motherfuckers, honey. Somebody asked him, 'Why don't you play Louis Armstrong records?' And he says, 'Somebody want to know why we don't play Louis Armstrong records--ha! We don't.' I said, 'Dig him! Isn't he the cutest thing?'”\n\nJazz critics like Simon could complain and jazz disc-jockeys like Symphony Sid could choose not to play his records, but Louis Armstrong was outgrowing the jazz world. On October 8, as Armstrong conquered Europe in his first major overseas tour since the 1930s, “That Lucky Old Sun” and “Blueberry Hill” was featured in Decca’s Best Sellers advertisement in the “Popular” category, in addition to being the number four “Operators Pick” that week.\n\nWhen they got around to reviewing the single on November 12, 1949, Billboard called “That Lucky Old Sun,” “A standout Armstrong vocal and the usual smart Gordon Jenkins production backing make this an excellent entry in the ‘Sun’ stakes” and added of “Blueberry Hill,” “The Armstrong-Jenkins combination projects a standard ballad of some years back with feeling and charm.” The record was a hit.\n\n“It just got played so much more than anything he’d had,” Jenkins said. “He was well known around the world, but he’d never appeared with a chorus before, or with strings, that kind of treatment.” Los Angeles disc jockey Chuck Cecil added, “It took Louis out of the jazz idiom and gave him a piece of pop music. I’ve always thought it not only changed his career but prolonged it. Made him more popular than he’d ever been in his life.”\n\nInterestingly, Armstrong performed “That Lucky Old Sun” with a choir at the Apollo Theater later in 1949 but made “Blueberry Hill,” what was supposed to be the flip side, a permanent part of his act. Again, some in the jazz world resented this; Gunther Schuller for one, bemoaned the feeling that Armstrong had “the need to scratch out a living as a good-natured buffoon, singing ‘Blueberry Hill’...night after night.” Armstrong would have disagreed. When appearing on BBC’s Desert Island Discs in 1968, Armstrong was asked what single record he would take to a mythical desert island and responded, “I’d like to take ‘Blueberry Hill,’ ‘cause right now, it’s like ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ in America when I sing it.”\n\nYou Can’t Lose a Broken Heart / My Sweet Hunk O’Trash\n\nLouis Armstrong, Billie Holiday (voc), Bernie Privin (tp), Sid Cooper, Johnny Mince (as), Art Drelinger, Pat Nizza (ts), Billy Kyle (p), Everett Barksdale (g), Joe Benjamin (b), Jimmy Crawford (d), Sy Oliver (arr, cond).\n\nDecca 24785\n\nRecorded September 30, 1949, New York City\n\nArmstrong concluded his busy September 1949 with a third and final Decca session, this one pairing him with one of his greatest disciples, Billie Holiday. Though the two had appeared together in the film New Orleans, they never made any commercial duet recordings at the time of that film’s 1947 release. Instead, they joined forces for this, their one and only studio session.\n\nArmstrong and Holiday were at something of a crossroads at this juncture. Gabler had helped turn Holiday into a superstar at Decca, recording a number of hits starting with 1944’s “Lover Man.” Gabler had been the man who put out the haunting “Strange Fruit” on Commodore Records, along with a selection of quiet ballads with a small, jazz combo backing. On Decca, though, he draped Lady Day in strings and got her on the pop charts. But in 1949, her struggles with addiction were inching her off the Decca roster, just as Gabler was starting to work his magic with Armstrong. There would no more opportunities for two of jazz’s greatest and most influential singers to record together again (though they both recorded for Norman Granz in 1956 and 1957, Granz chose to team Armstrong up with Ella Fitzgerald instead; could you imagine a series of Billie and Louis albums?)\n\nTheir lone studio date was comprised of two songs from the now-forgotten James P. Johnson-Flournoy Miller musical Sugar Hill. Both tunes have their charm but haven’t exactly become standards. Gabler still didn’t seem to grasp that he had in Armstrong, not only the greatest jazz singer of them all, but also the greatest duet partner. On “You Can’t Lose a Broken Heart,” Armstrong and Holiday don’t interact at all, much like Armstrong and Fitzgerald barely interacted on their first Gabler pairing of “You Won’t Be Satisfied” and “The Frim Fram Sauce” in 1946. But even separately, there’s plenty of meat to enjoy from each artist, notably Armstrong’s sublime entrance and Holiday’s full-powered 1940s voice in all it glory.\n\nBut on the flip side, “My Sweet Hunk o’Trash,” the two interacted perhaps a little too much. It’s a fun recording showing that Armstrong could even bring out the humorous side of Holiday in a period when her choice of material seemed more plugged into the sadder aspects of her personal life. Everyone sounds like they’re having a good time until Holiday sings, “It makes me mad to wait” and Armstrong responds by asking her, “How come, baby?” But--some would argue deliberately--Armstrong garbled up the first two words so it sounded more like, “Fuck ‘em, baby.”\n\nThe record was issued and apparently the world went mad. Walter Winchell, one of Louis's staunchest supporters, wrote a column complaining about it. The Downbeat review read, \"On 'Trash,' Louis feels constrained to dish out the same expletive Patricia Norman used some years ago on Eddy Duchin's 'Old Man Mose,' when she worked it into the 'bucket' line. Here it is not only in bad taste, it doesn't even make much sense in the lyric line. And since when does Louis have to use obscenity to sell records?\"\n\nThe \"fuck 'em\" controversy was big enough for Gabler to record some poor schmo singing a crystal clear \"How\" and inserting it into a reprint of the original single. We chose not to include it in this set, but it’s on YouTube.\n\nBillboard never mentioned the “fuck ‘em” controversy but gave the pairing top marks, saying of “You Can’t Lose a Broken Heart,” “Two top jazz artists join forces here for a sprightly pop job.” Some jazz critics might have bristled at these two giants doing a “pop job,” but Gabler made sure to throw those hard-to-please folks a bone the next time Armstrong entered Decca’s studios.\n\nNew Orleans Function, Parts 1 and 2\n\nLouis Armstrong (tp, voc), Jack Teagarden (tb, voc), Barney Bigard (cl), Earl Hines (p), Arvell Shaw (b), Cozy Cole (d).\n\nDecca 27059\n\nRecorded April 26-27, 1950, New York City\n\nLouis Armstrong was now a bona fide pop star but night in and night out, he wasn’t appearing with Gordon Jenkins or with orchestras or choirs. He was touring the country with his sextet, the All Stars, playing an assemblage of music that could not be categorized: New Orleans warhorses, comedy numbers, Swing Era anthems, love songs, duets, Hot Five classics and yes, the latest Deccas. Armstrong was proud of his band but the All Stars had not recorded as a group since their last RCA Victor session of October 1947 and it was beginning to rankle Armstrong as the 1950s began.\n\n“I used to go to this company that I record with, one of them there, and I used to tell them, ‘Well, man, why don’t you turn us loose in the studio here and let us wail?’” Armstrong told the Voice of America in 1956. “They’d say, ‘Well, that’s a good idea.’ And I’d say, ‘It’s a very good idea. If them people listen to our concerts and give us thunderous applause over these tunes we play, you know they would like to have it in their files. So why don’t you just record these things, the same as we’re on the stage?’ ‘That’s nice, but we’ve got a few pop tunes here I think is going to be on the Hit Parade’ blah blah blah. And that’s when you look around, people are wondering, ‘What happened to Louie Armstrong?’”\n\nArmstrong claimed not to read the critics but as that quote makes clear, he knew that recording nothing but pop tunes was going to harm his hard-earned reputation--especially when two of the first three Decca sessions didn’t feature any trumpet playing at all.\n\nMilt Gabler heard the complaints loud and clear and to appease his star, set aside two days, April 26 and 27, 1950, to let Armstrong and his All Stars record some of the tunes were playing night in and night out. No arrangements, nothing to learn in the studio, just two days of blowing as if they were still onstage.\n\nOnly one of the batch would become a two-sided single, “New Orleans Function,” Armstrong’s attempt to recreate the brass band funeral marches of his youth. It’s a recording that really sums up almost everything you need to know about Louis Armstrong: there’s the great actor, setting the stage; the dramatic trumpeter, able to make the listener cry with his straight, chilling reading of the hymn, “Flee as a Bird”; the comedian, invoking the “ashes to ashes” bit while the rest of the band hilarious cries in the background; and finally, the out-and-out swinger, who plays a chorus in a traditional parade-like two-beat before finishing the record by swinging like it’s 1950, not 1905.\n\nThe single was issued in July 1950 as a special release commemorating Armstrong’s 50th birthday, which he celebrated on July 4. The jazz press gave it the seal of approval, Ernie Anderson reporting, “Musicologists who have heard the record call it the finest example of New Orleans jazz ever cut. And Louis’ horn and voice were never in finer fettle than for this exhibition of hometown music.” But this time, the pop-oriented Billboard gave it a subpar review (rating 61 out of 100) on July 8, saying Armstrong’s spoken role was in “questionable taste” and the overall result was “For Satch’s faithful followers only.” You can’t please everyone--but Armstrong certainly came close!\n\nNEW ORLEANS DAYS and JAZZ CONCERT\n\nThat’s For Me, Parts 1 and 2\n\nDecca 9-27187/8\n\nFine and Dandy\n\nDecca 9-27189\n\nI Surrender Dear, Parts 1 and 2\n\nDecca 9-27189/90\n\nRussian Lullaby\n\nDecca 9-27190\n\nMedley: Bugle Call Rag, Ole Miss, Parts 1 and 2\n\nDecca 9-27191/2/3\n\nPanama, Parts 1 and 2\n\nDecca 9-27191/2\n\nMy Bucket’s Got a Hole In It\n\nDecca 9-27194\n\nRecorded April 26-27, 1950, New York City\n\nLouis Armstrong (tp, voc), Jack Teagarden (tb, voc), Barney Bigard (cl), Earl Hines (p), Arvell Shaw (b), Cozy Cole (d).\n\nWhen putting together this set, my co-producer Harry Weinger and I decided to keep bonuses to a minimum, as not everything Louis recorded for Decca in these years was issued as a single. But we relaxed the rules for the material from the April 26 and 27 sessions, New Orleans Days and Jazz Concert. For one thing, the albums were issued in 45-rpm format, though not as outright singles. And the music--and personnel--is of such a high level, how could we leave it out?\n\nNew Orleans Days only contained four tracks, but each is an extended version of a New Orleans favorite with the Armstrong horn front and center. In fact, the entire band is on fire throughout. For star-power, this edition of the All Stars couldn’t be topped with Jack Teagarden, Barney Bigard, Earl “Fatha” Hines, Arvell Shaw and Cozy Cole justifying the band’s name.\n\nThough the band had some spectacular moments on the bandstand and--in this case--the recording studio, personally, it’s not my favorite version of the band: Hines never wanted to be a sideman and often couldn’t hide his displeasure in his role in the band. Armstrong even told William Russell that Hines, Shaw and Cole formed a clique and even refused to sign autographs for fans. Armstrong said of this band in 1956, “Some of the other Stars got so they was prima donnas and didn’t want to play with the other fellows. They wouldn’t play as a team but was like a basketball side with everybody trying to make the basket. They was great musicians, but after a while they played as if their heart ain’t in what they was doin’. A fella would take a solo but no-one would pay him attention--just gaze here, look around there. And the audience would see things like that--I don’t praise that kind of work y’know. Then you get cliques in a band. Want to play that way and this way, full of that New Orleans fogeyism. I was taught to watch that kind of thing as a youngster and always to give my mind to my music before anything else.”\n\nBut in April 1950, the All Stars put aside any differences--and fogeyism--and turned in a series of masterful performances on these albums. On Jazz Concert, the sidemen were rewarded with a series of effective features, including Hines’s “Fine and Dandy,” Bigard’s “I Surrender Dear,” Shaw’s “Russian Lullaby” and Teagarden’s “Baby Won’t You Please Come Home.” It’s not a stretch to say that Armstrong steals each performance every time he picks up his Selmer trumpet (or in the case of “I Surrender Dear,” tenderly sings a favorite song he originally recorded in 1931).\n\nHe steals the entire album on “That’s For Me,” a beautiful Rodgers and Hammerstein ballad from State Fair. Once again, further proof that it was impossible to pigeonhole Armstrong’s music. After giving “moldy fig” lovers of traditional jazz occasion to cheer on New Orleans Days, he opens Jazz Concert with this performance. Ironically, he seems to have stopped performing it live after this recording, but he fell in love with it soon after its 1945 publication, dedicating it to his new bride, Lucille, and performing it with his big band (an arrangement still survives at the Louis Armstrong House Museum). One can see why: his singing has never been more charming, especially as he stretches the limit of the tenor range of his voice, and in his muted trumpet spot, he displays some fleet-fingered explorations of the horn, floating across the bar lines with grace and lyricism. He also gets sympathetic backing from the All Stars, especially from his brother in the band, Jack Teagarden, as well as Hines, whose sparkling comping simply shines.\n\nAround this time, Armstrong’s press agent Ernie Anderson approached Gabler with a special offering: 16-inch discs of an All Stars concert Anderson had personally recorded at Symphony Hall in Boston in November 1947. Gabler knew a good thing when he saw it and purchased the discs from Anderson. After New Orleans Days and Jazz Concert were released on September 1950, Satchmo at Symphony Hall followed in January 1951. At the end of January 1951, Gabler himself recorded the All Stars live in California and released Satchmo at Pasadena in July 1952. It’s yet another reason Gabler should be applauded. The All Stars recordings never sold like the pop sides but Gabler promoted pure no-fills jazz since his Commodore Records days and he loved Armstrong and obviously respected the All Stars and wanted to make sure that their sounds would also be welcome at Decca. But with the April 1950 sessions out of the way, it was time for Gabler to return Armstrong to the pop world in a big way.\n\nLa Vie En Rose / C’est Si Bon\n\nLouis Armstrong (tp, voc), Melvin Solomon, Bernie Privin, Paul Webster (tp), Morton Bullman (tb), Hymie Schertzer, Milt Yaner (as), Art Drelinger, Bill Holcombe (ts), Earl Hines (p), Everett Barksdale (g), George Duvivier (b), Johnny Blowers (d), Sy Oliver (arr, cond).\n\nDecca 27113\n\nRecorded June 26, 1950, New York City\n\nFor the next pop session, Gabler turned to France. Edith Piaf’s “La Vie En Rose” was a smash hit, especially its Columbia Records single produced that year by Armstrong’s friend and associate, George Avakian. As Avakian explained, “That same year [1950], Edith Piaf took New York by storm and me by surprise. I was doubling as International and Pop Album director at Columbia in those days, and when Piaf's manager told me she was coming back to New York despite a cool reception the first time 'round, I asked our Paris affiliate to send me samples of her interim releases so that I could try to choose something which might appeal to the American public. I recognized one melody as 'You're Too Dangerous, Cherie,' a failed pop tune I had liked a couple of years earlier. The label said 'La Vie En Rose,' and the impassioned French lyric was far superior to wishy-washy English words I knew. We gave it a shot and to everyone's astonishment but 'Ay-deet's,' it sold a million copies.\"\n\nThe record was so huge, it didn’t take long for the covers to start appearing. Armstrong recorded his on June 26; in the August 12 issue of Billboard, it was listed by Decca as “Coming Fast” along with other versions on the label by Bing Crosby and Guy Lombardo. But Armstrong’s is the one that has endured. After “What a Wonderful World,” it has become the most ubiquitous Armstrong recording of the 21st century, used in movies, in commercials, in anything and everything.\n\nAnd with good reason. Armstrong’s version is heartfelt and timeless. Once again, Armstrong plays and sings with tremendous warmth, his voice and horn captured brilliantly by the Decca engineers. It’s a perfect side in every way and speaks to the enduring nature of Armstrong as an artist. Bassist George Duvivier was on the session and remembered, “Louis was amazing. There was very little rehearsal. He just came in, put on his glasses, looked at his part, ran it through briefly, and said in that voice of his, ‘Okay. Let’s make it, men!’ And that was it. Perfect!”\n\nIt was already advertised in Decca’s Billboard advertisement on July 22 with an official review following on July 29 stating, “Imaginative assignment to ‘Pops’ results in a delightful interpretation with Armstrong’s vocal and trumpet work.”\n\nFor the flip side, it only made sense for Gabler to stay in France and have Armstrong and Oliver tackle Yves Montand’s monster 1948 hit, “C’est Si Bon.” Legend has it that Armstrong heard Suzy Delair sing it in French at the Nice Jazz Festival on February 25, 1948 and asked to make a recording of it. There was a recording ban going on at the time and Armstrong didn’t start recording again until September 1949, but in 1950, Armstrong got his wish as the the French tune received English lyrics by Jerry Seelen. Jean Sablon got first crack at it but finally, Louis got to wax it in June 1950, helping to make the song an even bigger international hit. In fact, at the time, this might have even been bigger than ‘La Vie En Rose’ as the disc was referenced in the August 12, 1950 Billboard as “A top up-and-coming number is Louis Armstrong’s ‘C’est Si Bon’ with ‘La Vie En Rose.’” (Even Ella Fitzgerald used to impersonate Louis on “I Can’t Give You Anything But Love,” singing “Til that lucky day, when ‘C’est Si Bon’ becomes a hit!”)\n\nPerhaps remembering that Decca asked him not to play trumpet on two of his first three pop sessions in September 1949, Armstrong came ready to blow on June 26, 1950. After the majestic, operatic turn on “La Vie En Rose,” Armstrong simply wailed at the end of “C’est Si Bon” with a powerhouse display of chops. Oliver let the band play the melody while Armstrong improvises in and around them, getting stronger and stronger as he goes on until he’s playing the melody an octave higher at end, topping out at a sky-high concert Eb.\n\nArmstrong was fond of telling a story about sitting in a hotel bar shortly after the record was released. “There was a guy sitting down there, glass full of whisky,” he told the Voice of America in 1956. “He comes over and says, ‘Man, that ‘Cest Si Bon’ was gone! But I want to know one thing: who played the solo for you? He said,’ You’re an old cat, man, somebody must have played it for you.’ So a chick jumped up and said, ‘Who COULD play it for him? Get away from there!’ She run him away!” In other tellings of the story, Armstrong identified “the chick” as Billie Holiday!\n\nThough clearly popular at the time (Armstrong played “La Vie En Rose” to great applause on Bing Crosby’s radio show that summer), the single doesn’t seem to have hit the charts at anytime. Still, when Decca compiled a checklist of their “All-Time Hits” in the March 17, 1951 issue of Billboard, they made sure to list “La Vie En Rose” and “C’est Si Bon.” Armstrong almost immediately added both numbers to the All Stars repertoire and had yet another hit that remains popular decades after his passing.\n\nDream a Little Dream Of Me / Can Anyone Explain?\n\nLouis Armstrong (tp, voc), Ella Fitzgerald (voc), Paul Webster (tp), Hank D’Amico (cl), Frank Ludwig (ts), Hank Jones (p), Everett Barksdale (g), Ray Brown (b), Johnny Blowers (d), Sy Oliver (arr, cond).\n\nDecca 27209\n\nRecorded August 25, 1950, New York City\n\nNorman Granz usually gets the credit--deservedly so--when people bring up the unbeatable team of Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald. But it should always be remembered that Milt Gabler teamed them first at Decca and, in my humble opinion, produced the single greatest Ella-and-Louis performance: “Dream a Little Dream Of Me.”\n\nEverything is perfection on this platter, from the song choice to the arrangement by Sy Oliver to the interplay between Armstrong and Fitzgerald. Perhaps realizing he wasted a good opportunity when he first paired these two in 1946 on two sides where they barely interacted, Gabler allows Armstrong and Fitzgerald to take turns scatting an obligato behind the other before a magical ending featuring touching harmonizing and a few lines of new, heartfelt lyrics. Simply magical.\n\nThough originally written in 1931, “Dream a Little Dream of Me,” was rediscovered in 1950 in a major way. Publisher Words & Music, Inc. ran an ad in the September 23, 1950 Billboard advertising “7 Great Records!” and listing versions by Cathy Mastice, Dinah Shore, Georgia Gibbs and Bing Crosby, Jack Owens, Frankie Laine, Vaughn Monroe and Ella Fitzgerald with Louis JORDAN--oops! Wrong Louis, but Jordan will make an appearance in due time (and the typo was fixed by the November 4 issue).\n\nOne week later, Billboard gushed, “Ella and Louis make a masterful disking of this revived lovely. A future collector’s item, this one should draw heavy play with spinners, ops and fans.” Indeed, it was the number three pick on the jukebox operators charts on October 7 and on the Decca “Best Sellers” chart the following month. (In the December 2 issue, both this single and the “La Vie En Rose”/”C’est Si Bon” coupling were listed on Decca’s “Sepia” chart, denoting popularity with African-American audiences.)\n\nBut for all my gushing over “Dream a Little Dream of Me,” the record was probably made with the intention of pushing the other side, a brand new pop song, “Can Anyone Explain (No! No! No!),” written by Bennie Benjamin and future “What a Wonderful World” scribe, George David Weiss. The Ames Brothers had the first hit with it, entering the Billboard charts on August 4, 1950. The parade of covers followed, including versions by Dinah Shore, Vic Damone, Ray Anthony and more (Decca alone gave it to Ella and Louis, Dick Haymes and Four Hits and a Miss).\n\nArmstrong and Fitzgerald go the duet route, right down to a little comedic interlude with Fitzgerald shouting at Armstrong to stop blowing his trumpet and Armstrong offering the autobiographical truth, “I’ve been in love four times!” It’s a lot of fun, especially when the two join forces at the end. “A pair of all-time greats get together for a clambake with a currently hot ballad,” according to Billboard. “A delightful waxing which should grab a share among these talents’ followings at the very least.”\n\nThe record became a moderate hit, hitting #30 for one week in November on the Popular charts. Armstrong even added it to his live repertoire, turning it into one of his hilarious duets with female vocalist Velma Middleton, keeping it in the act for a year or two. Armstrong’s All Stars were already getting critical knocks for reputedly playing the same songs every night but after one full year with Decca, he had added “Blueberry Hill,” “La Vie En Rose,” “C’est Si Bon,” “New Orleans Function” and “Can Anyone Explain” to his live shows. There would be more to come.\n\nLife Is So Peculiar / You Rascal You\n\nLouis Armstrong (tp, voc), Louis Jordan (as, voc), Aaron Izenhall (tp), Josh Jackson (ts), Bill Doggett (p), Bill Jennings (g), Bob Bushnell (b), Joe Morris (d).\n\nDecca 27212\n\nRecorded August 23, 1950, New York City\n\nLike Armstrong’s one and only session with Billie Holiday, it’s mind-boggling that it took Louis Armstrong and Louis Jordan until August 23, 1950 to make a record together and judging from the results, it’s equally mind-boggling to realize it never happened again.\n\nBut also like Armstrong and Holiday, Armstrong and Jordan were at a crossroads at the time of their session. Jordan had been one of the all-time best sellers in Decca’s history, routinely hitting number one during the 1940s and a tremendously popular attraction with both white and black audiences. As the 1950s began, though, he was mainly carrying the black audience and no longer racking up as many hits as he used to. Decca was still pushing him; in the December 16, 1950 Billboard, Armstrong had small mentions of hit records in both the Popular and Sepia categories but it was Jordan who was featured at the top of the ad, a large photo running next to a screaming promotion for his latest single, “Chartreuse” backed by “Lemonade.” It wouldn’t work. Jordan remained popular in the Rhythm and Blues field--his music clearly paved the way for Rock and Roll--but he couldn’t break the charts again. His sales declined until Decca dropped him in 1954.\n\nBut that was a few years away. On August 23, 1950, it must have been quite a joyous occasion for Gabler to see his two prize “Louies” together for the first time. But his joy must have disappeared when an exhausted Armstrong proved unable to make a sound out of his trumpet. As Jordan told the BBC in 1973:\n\n\"Oh, now, that was something. We had tried for about, oh, about five or six times. I would come in town from Florida to New York, and he’d come in town from Los Angeles to New York, and we would try to get together, and something would happen. So he came in town this—this day. His lip had busted on him, had busted all—all the way down. And—and he says, ‘I don’t care if I don’t have a lip.’ Said, ‘We going to record today.’ Said, ‘We—we been making a date for the-- So we went out. We got in—got in the studio at 6 o’clock in the morning. And we went—there’s a—there is couple of places around New York called Chock Full o'Nuts. Well, there’s one not far from 50 West 57th Street. That’s where we recorded on Decca. And he said, ‘Let’s go down here to Chock Full o'Nuts and get a sandwich and some coffee and we see if we can find some fruit.’ I said, ‘What about this fruit?’ He said, ‘Well,’ he says, ‘I found that if we—if we can get some white grapes and we eat them and rest awhile, probably my voice will clear,” because he was hoarse. He was real hoarse. And he says, ‘And I—I’m going to make it anyhow.’ I said, ‘Oh, don’t worry about it.’ He said, ‘I’m going to—I’m going to make it.’ So we—we were supposed to record, start recording, at 7 o’clock. We didn’t start until 10:30 or 10:45, and we were through in ten minutes because, you know, right—we went right on through it. Because we had—we’d talked it over and he looked at the music and we knew what we were going to do, but we had to wait on his lip. So finally he said, ‘Let’s go.’ And we went on and played it. He even—he even—if you have ever heard the record, he even played those high C’s and things with his lip busted. So he was magnificent.\"\n\nIndeed, that’s the glory of these Decca singles sessions: Armstrong the luxury to take as much of the four-hour session time as he needed to get his chops together. In just a few years, he’d be making entire 12-song albums in a day for Norman Granz’s Verve label and couldn’t hide any irregularities with his trumpet playing. But for Gabler, he was able to have his fruit and sandwiches and coffee and rally to blow the roof of Decca’s 57th Street studio at the last minute.\n\nLike the Ella Fitzgerald session--which actually took place after this date but was released first--the main reason for the session was to cover a new song, “Life is So Peculiar” from the musical Mr. Music (Decca had a version by Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters going at the same time). In the hand of the two Louies, it’s an infectious masterpiece; you simply can’t listen to it without your mood improving. The instrumental interlude rocks, too, with Armstrong and Jordan both getting downright bluesy before a nifty unison break. Also, notice the lyrics mention of “cabbage,” which gets a loaded “I love cabbage” from Armstrong. Anyone familiar with the 1920s Maggie Jones song “Anybody Here Want to Try My Cabbage” knows that Louis isn’t thinking about food.\n\nBut it’s the standard recorded that day that has proven more durable (perhaps because that’s the very definition of a standard). Armstrong put “I’ll Be Glad When You’re Dead You Rascal You” on the map in 1931. It was such a big hit, he re-recorded it for RCA Victor in December 1932 as part of a “Medley of Armstrong Hits”--with young Louis Jordan in the band on alto saxophone. Though the original is wonderful and a 1941 Decca remake is even better, it’s the 1950 duet that is the version to end all versions. Both men are at their peaks, taking turns singing lead and playing cheerleader behind the other. Jordan is smooth and sassy but it’s Armstrong’s personality that eventually swallows him whole, sneaking in yet another reference to “cabbage” and uncorking a dazzling descending reading of the line, “I wonder what you got” that never fails to make me laugh (the declamatory “I say” is pretty great, too).\n\nAs Armstrong shouts, “Blow ‘em out!” Jordan’s Tympany Five responds by locking into an irresistibly swinging groove, the horns setting one riff after another while drummer Chris Columbo (real name Joe Morris) switches to a Chinese cymbal that threatens to send the whole thing into the stratosphere. With the band positively cooking, Armstrong floats on top of them, flexing those mangled lip muscles, hitting high notes, holding them for impossible lengths, responding to the riffs and not at all sounding like a man barely able to make a sound just a few hours earlier. He never made it easy on himself, but the effort was more than worth it.\n\nDecca rolled it out on October 7, winning rave reviews from Billboard. “Both Louies sing, play and kid their way thru this old Armstrong fave,” the magazine said of “You Rascal You. “Should score heavily with fans and could rack up juke coin in metropolitan situations.” Of “Life is So Peculiar,” Billboard wrote, “This ‘Mr. Music’ score ditty serves as an ideal material piece for the vigorous styling of the Louies. Happy disking could pick up big returns in pop and R&B locations.” Indeed, it was listed as “Retailer’s Pick” on October 16 and as a Decca Best Seller on November 16.\n\nIt would seem a natural occasion for a rematch but it was never to be. Jordan’s wife, Martha, blamed it on Armstrong’s manager Joe Glaser, saying, “Louis would have loved to have recorded again with Louis Armstrong but Joe Glaser seemed to veto the idea. I’m certain that it wasn’t anything to do with Pops himself, because Louis and I loved Pops and he was always great with us. Joe Glaser somehow saw Louis Jordan as a threat to Louis Armstrong, which was absolute nonsense.”\n\nActually, Glaser was not so far off. In scouring old issues of Billboard magazine, one can see Jordan still ruling the “Sepia” charts, while Armstrong spread to more of the “Popular” world. Around 1952, Armstrong and Jordan ended up in Dallas at the same time. As Armstrong’s friend Jack Bradley remembered, Armstrong told him “all the [black] people went to see [Jordan] and hardly any went to see Louie [Armstrong]. And that really upset him a lot, ‘cause he told me about it. But you know, it was obviously a black community, and Louie was considered by the blacks as well to be an Uncle Tom. But he said, ‘My own people didn’t come.’”\n\nArmstrong remained hurt about this until the end of his life, telling the story on BBC television in 1968 without mentioning Jordan by name. “I played in Dallas, Texas at the Coliseum and they paid a lot of money for our attraction. But at the next block, they had one of them zoot suit saxophone players playing all that [imitates boogie-woogie eight-to-the-bar sound], you know what I mean, the trend--but still in all [Louis makes a first, shakes it powerfully, closes his eyes and nods seriously]--like Mozart. Them people came to see Satch and they was all white. I could count the colored there. That's the night--I remembered that.”\n\nIn the November 16, 1950 issue of Billboard, Armstrong and Jordan’s duet was listed as a Popular Best Seller while his duet with Ella Fitzgerald was listed one column over as a Sepia Best Seller. Armstrong didn’t believe in categories but he’d be spending much more time on the former charts than the latter as the years progressed.\n\nSit Down You’re Rockin’ the Boat / That’s What the Man Said\n\nLouis Armstrong (tp, voc), Billy Kyle (p), Everett Barksdale (g), Joe Benjamin (b), Johnny Blowers (d), Unknown mixed choir (voc), Sy Oliver (arr, cond).\n\nDecca 277254\n\nRecorded August 31, 1950, New York City\n\nWill Friedwald has always lamented that Louis Armstrong never did an all-Broadway album (Satch Digs Broadway?). When listening to “Sit Down You’re Rocking the Boat,” it’s easy to understand Friedwald’s feelings. This is Armstrong the actor at his finest.\n\nFrank Loesser’s Guys and Dolls was the smash Broadway hit of 1950. With Decca responsible for the Original Cast Recording (another innovation pioneered by Milt Gabler at Decca in the early 1940s), it didn’t take much imagination for Gabler to tab Armstrong to put his take on Stubby Kaye’s big feature. Armstrong more than rises to the occasion, even without blowing a note of trumpet. “Louis contributes a wonderful performance, one of his most persuasive, on this ‘Guys and Dolls’ item,” according to Billboard. “Louis alone should stir a brisk business if disking is pushed at all. Must for alert spinners.”\n\n“Sit Down You’re Rocking the Boat” allows us to daydream about the spectacle of Armstrong on Broadway. We already know he was great in films and on television but can you imagine Armstrong singing, playing and acting on the stage? Of course, you can argue that he was already doing that with his All Stars 300 nights a year but it’s a shame his talents were never utilized on really strong scripted material in a theatrical setting.\n\nPerhaps because of the revivalist nature of “Sit Down You’re Rocking the Boat,” Gabler chose Willard Robison’s brand new composition “That’s What the Man Said” as the flip side. It’s a shame Armstrong didn’t do more Robison material--his musical brother Jack Teagarden memorably tackled his catalog on the later album Think Well of Me--as he clearly thrives on Robison’s folksy storytelling ways (though the addition to “Gizzard” is pure Armstrong, not Robison). We even get to hear a spot of trumpet on this one, effective as always. Billboard wrote off this side as “For Armstrong fans mainly” and they were correct; this coupling never took off on the charts. Metronome, though, did publish a fantastic photo of Armstrong at work during this session:\n\nHowever, someone at MGM was listening. The following year, Armstrong took part in a musical, Glory Alley, in which he performed “That’s What the Man Said” as the finale of the film. It’s even better on the big screen as Armstrong looks completely comfortable in the musical setting, a natural actor if there ever was one. But the record-buying public didn’t want to hear Armstrong the actor and this single remains one of his lesser known Decca items, undeservedly so.\n\nYou’re Just In Love / If\n\nLouis Armstrong (tp, voc), Chris Griffin (tp), Red Ballard (tb), Wayne Songer (as), Dent Eckels (ts), Charles LaVere (p), Allan Reuss (g), Phil Stephens (b), Nick Fatool (d), Velma Middleton (voc), Gordon Jenkins (cond).\n\nDecca 27481\n\nRecorded February 6, 1951, Los Angeles\n\n“Sit Down You’re Rocking the Boat” might not have been a big seller but that didn’t stop Gabler from having Armstrong tackle another recent Broadway hit, Irving Berlin’s “You’re Just in Love” from Call Me Madam. Decca was already pushing a version by Ethel Merman and Dick Haymes in the January 6, 1951 issue of Billboard so it’s not much of a surprise to see Armstrong get the call one month later.\n\nBut instead of Ella Fitzgerald or Billie Holiday as his duet partner, we finally hear from Armstrong’s longtime female vocalist and comic foil, Velma Middleton. Critics always (unfairly) savaged Middleton’s singing and dancing, but she had unbeatable chemistry with Armstrong, especially on their duets. “You’re Just in Love” fit the team perfectly and though it wasn’t a big seller when released in March, it immediately entered Armstrong’s live repertoire, remaining a riotous audience favorite for the next few years.\n\nThe flip side completely changes the mood with the very pretty, very popular ballad, “If.” Like “Dream a Little Dream of Me,” the song was originally written in 1934 but was rediscovered in 1950 with Perry Como having the number 1 hit in November of that year. Dean Martin followed with another version that made the charts in December. In fact, on Christmas Day 1950, Armstrong made a reel-to-reel tape at his friend Stuff Crouch’s house in Los Angeles, listening to the radio with his Boston Terrier, General. Martin’s “If” came on and at the end, Armstrong turned to his dog and said, “A beautiful way to end this reel, eh, General?” General barked his approval in return. Armstrong’s vocal on “If” is all-heart and though he only plays a short snatch of trumpet, he sticks to the melody, one he clearly adored.\n\nThis session was once again arranged by Gordon Jenkins, who still didn’t use strings on his second date with Armstrong. He didn’t even bring a choir, perhaps because Sy Oliver got choir duty on the previous session. Instead, Jenkins is at the helm of a fine small big band of California stalwarts. We’ve already established that Jenkins worshipped Armstrong but beginning with this session, it becomes something of a game to spot all the Armstrong licks in his writing (there’s a Hot Five lick before his vocal on “You’re Just in Love” and the interlude before the trumpet solo on “If” is straight out of the Armstrong vocabulary, to name just two examples).\n\nThe single was listed as a “Special” in the March 3 Billboard, but it didn’t receive a review and never hit any of the charts, including Decca’s own internal listings. It wasn’t a repeat smash for the team of Armstrong and Jenkins after “That Lucky Old Sun” and “Blueberry Hill.” Next time, he’d bring the strings.\n\nGone Fishin’\n\nBing Crosby, Louis Armstrong (voc), Red Nichols, Bobby Guy, Ziggy Elman (tp), Dick Taylor, Bill Atkinson, Wendell Mayhew (tb), Matty Matlock, Phil Shuken, Larry Wright, Warren Baker, Babe Russin, Jack Chaney (reeds), Jacques Gasselin, Harry Bluestone, Sam Freed, Henry Hill, Walter Edelstein, Mayer Oberman, Murray Kellner, Milton Thomas, Cy Bernard (strings), Mel Henke, Buddy Cole (p), Perry Botkin (g), Phil Stephens (b), John Cyr (d), John Scott Trotter (cond, arr).\n\nDecca 27633\n\nRecorded April 19, 1951, Los Angeles\n\n“Papa” Bing Crosby only makes one appearance in this set but it’s quite a memorable one. Between 1949 and 1951, Armstrong appeared on Crosby’s radio show numerous times, sometimes performing hot jazz numbers, sometimes introducing a Decca pop hit, but always finding time to perform a showstopping duet. Hoagy Carmichael’s “Lazy Bones” was their regular go-to choice but on April 19, 1951, they tried out something else: “Gone Fishin’,” written by brothers Nick and Charles Kenny. The Kenny brothers published the song in 1950, when it was recorded by Arthur Godfrey, but it sank without a trace.\n\nSomehow it caught Crosby’s attention and it was decided it would be a good vehicle for “Mr. Satch and Mr. Cros” on Crosby’s radio show. Indeed, the audience went wild for the good-natured duet, especially when Crosby remarks he doesn’t have to work anymore because he has a piece of his son, Gary Crosby, then riding a wave of popularity as a singer.\n\nThe mystery remains as how “Gone Fishin’” ended up with Decca. It appears that Armstrong and Crosby recorded a take of it with the John Scott Trotter Orchestra either before or after the live version. Crosby, still a king at Decca, knew he had a good thing and sold the recording from his rehearsal to the label, where it was backed by Crosby’s solo performance of “We All Have a Song in Our Heart.”\n\nArmstrong didn’t even remember making it, telling a radio interviewer, “And this ‘Goin’ Fishin’,’ I notice the record came out and we didn’t make it in the studio. We did it, you know, while doing the broadcast. So they took the applause out and everything and the record sold. So I asked Papa Bing, I said, ‘Well, Daddy, there’s a little extra taste there for me.’ ‘No, Satchmo,’ he said, ‘You’re under contract, daddy!’” Armstrong broke into laughter recounting this conversation.\n\nCrosby remained enamored of the song as well, telling the BBC in 1974, “Any time I ever worked with Louis it was just a pleasure to be around. Lots of gags going all the time, you know, because he loved to laugh. He had an infectious laugh, too, about your singing or about his cornet playing or about a wardrobe or about music in general or anything. ‘Gone Fishin’ that’s a great song, and it’s wide open for the kind of thing Louis does best, you know. [I’m] kind of proud of that record.”\n\nCrosby wasn’t alone. It was the “Top Billboard Pick” on May 26, the magazine writing, “A pop tune, which didn’t make it a year or so ago, is back with a brand new lease on life in a happy gab-fest treatment by Croz and Satch.” By June 23, Billboard listed it as a Disc Jockey Pick, Retailer Pick and Operators Pick. Interestingly, with a hit on their hands, Armstrong and Crosby didn’t make any more studio recordings until 1960’s Bing and Satchmo, though there were still plenty of joint radio, television and film appearances to come in the 1950s. But could anyone have guessed in 1951 that Armstrong would make more singles with Gary Crosby than Bing in this decade?\n\nUnless\n\nLouis Armstrong (tp, voc), Jack Teagarden (tb), Barney Bigard (cl), Earl Hines (p), Arvell Shaw (b), Cozy Cole (d), Velma Middleton (voc).\n\nSupposed to be Decca 27616 but not issued as such\n\nRecorded April 23, 1951, Los Angeles\n\nThis is another bonus in this set of Armstrong’s Decca singles as it was never released as such. “Unless” was a big hit for Gordon Jenkins and Guy Mitchell (with Mitch Miller) in the spring of 1951. Gabler pegged Armstrong to cover it, even sending him an acetate disc of a solo pianist playing the melody in pseudo-classical style so Armstrong could familiarize himself with the melody before heading to the studio (he dubbed the acetate to his reel-to-reel tape collection).\n\nIn the studio, Armstrong turned in a charming performance, the highlight of which is his own cascade of scatting, which he uses as a call and response with the tune’s lyrics. But honestly, the All Stars sound a little tired. It got worse on the next song recorded that day: “A Kiss to Build a Dream On.” Armstrong had featured this in the new film The Strip so it made sense for Gabler to make a version for single release but the All Stars turned in a rare snoozer and Gabler knew it. That version of “A Kiss to Build a Dream On” was rejected immediately (and is not included here).\n\nAs for “Unless,” a copy of the MCA Records Catalog shows Decca assigned number 27616 to “Unless” with the flip-side being an edited version of the gorgeous “That’s For Me” from the previous April. But perhaps unsatisfied with the too-quiet nature of “Unless,” Gabler scrapped the whole idea, instead assigning Decca 27616 to Don Cherry’s single of “Vanity” and “Powder Blue.” Because “Unless” was at least given a number and planned as a single--and it was released that way by Brunswick in England and Fonit in Italy--we’ve included it here, but it remains one of the least-known of all of Armstrong’s Decca recordings. The same could not be said of his next session for the label.\n\nA Kiss to Build a Dream On / I Get Ideas\n\nLouis Armstrong (tp, voc), Cutty Cutshall (tb), Milt Yaner (cl, as), George Dorsey (as), Freddy Williams, Al Klink (ts), Billy Kyle (p), Sandy Block (b), Bunny Shawker (d), Sy Oliver (arr, cond).\n\nDecca 27720\n\nRecorded July 24, 1951, New York City\n\nTo this point, Armstrong had some major hits for Decca--”That Lucky Old Sun” / “Blueberry Hill” and “C’est Si Bon” / “La Vie En Rose” being the biggest--but the best-selling record he ever made for the label was this one.\n\nGabler was not satisfied with the All Stars’s somnolent take on it in April and was determined to get a quality single out of the song, which had already had quite a history. It was written by the formidable team of Oscar Hammerstein II, Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby for the 1934 film A Night at the Opera, but it was cut from that film and lay dormant until it was resuscitated for MGM’s The Strip, filmed at the end of 1950. The Strip would be released on August 31 and Gabler was still pushing to get a single out in time for the film’s opening.\n\nHis persistence paid off on the July 24 date. Sy Oliver came in with an unassuming but effective arrangement and a strong studio band, including future All Star Billy Kyle, who sets off the proceedings with a typically elegant piano introduction. Yet again, Armstrong’s voice is smooth as silk (take a bow, Decca engineers) and he clearly loves the song, passionately rephrasing it in the last eight bars. But to bury any lingering memories of the quiet version from April, Oliver built in an instrumental half chorus in the best New Orleans tradition, trombonist Cutty Cutshall really playing up the tailgate role, clarinetist Milt Yaner wailing in the upper register and drummer Bunny Shawker laying down a thundering backbeat, all over bassist Sandy Block’s firm, propulsive two-beat feel. Armstrong rides on top of this like a king, taking an excellent break in the middle and getting into the stratosphere in the second half of the instrumental portion. Finally, a pop single even the moldy figs could love!\n\n“A Kiss to Build a Dream On” is a knockout but as the song was unknown and The Strip hadn’t even opened yet, it was still a bit of a risk. Thus, Gabler chose it as the flip side, instead going with something more familiar for the “A” side, “I Get Ideas.” Originally an Argentine tango known as “Adios Muchachos” and popularized by Carlos Gardel, it was given English lyrics, rechristened “I Get Ideas” and became a big hit for Tony Martin in May 1951 (it was the number one “Disc Jockey’s Pick” in the same May 26, 1951 issue of Billboard that chose “Gone Fishin’” as the “Billboard Top Pick” overall).\n\nArmstrong didn’t have much experience with tangos, but to him, a beautiful song was a beautiful song. He barely changes a note of melody during his muted reading of it, while his vocal--without a trace of gravel--is full of all sorts of wicked insinuations. Like “A Kiss to Build a Dream On,” the instrumental portion packs quite a punch, Armstrong’s playing at its most rhapsodic. You can sense how much he loves performing this number, right down to the spontaneous laugh of satisfaction that closes the record. Perhaps he was laughing because he knew he was about to have another hit.\n\nBy this point, Decca began publishing its own “Decca Data” page in Billboard, a helpful guide to how Armstrong’s music sold for the label. It was the number one “Best Bet” in the Decca Popular category on September 15 and it became the number 2 best selling Pop record on the label on September 29, a spot it held until October 1--when it became number 1. It bounced between number 1 and number 2 for the rest of 1951.\n\nSomewhere along the way, “A Kiss to Build a Dream On” began receiving more airplay than “I Get Ideas.” On December 29, Billboard reported the song became “active during the past eight weeks when deejays started to flip the disk from the ‘I Get Ideas’ side.” In January 1952, Jet didn’t even mention “I Get Ideas,” writing, “Currently kicking on all fours in Louis ‘Satchmo’ Armstrong’s disking of ‘A Kiss to Build a Dream On,’ the best-selling platter of his lengthy career. ‘Kiss’ has sold well over 400,000 copies, surpassing even his ‘Lucky Old Sun’ which hit the 300,000 sales mark over a year ago.”\n\nNo one could deny that Milt Gabler’s strategy of presenting Louis Armstrong on the Popular charts was paying huge dividends, giving the trumpeter his biggest-selling record at age 50. He also had two more songs to add to the All Stars’s ever-expanding repertoire. Jazz critics continued to complain--”I Get Ideas” is the record that caused disc jockey Frenchy Sartell to write his apoplectic column about “How dare they bury him in commercialism?”--but there was no reason to stop Decca’s winning formula at this juncture. Because of Milt Gabler’s strategy, Louis Armstrong was more popular than ever.\n\nCold Cold Heart / Because of You\n\nLouis Armstrong (tp, voc), Charlie Holmes, George Dorsey (as), Harold Clark (ts), Dave McRae (ts, bar), Don Abney (p), Everett Barksdale (g), Frank Goodlette (b), Jack Parker (d), Sy Oliver (arr, cond).\n\nDecca 27816\n\nRecorded September 17, 1951, New York City\n\nArmstrong recorded the seminal “Blue Yodel Number 9” with Jimmie Rodgers in the summer of 1930, but he hadn’t really explored country music in the ensuing decades. That changed in the early 50s when Gabler gave Armstrong two Hank Williams tunes to record. (Technically, one could argue three. Though Armstrong played “My Bucket’s Got a Hole In It” since his days in New Orleans, he never recorded it until the April 1950 New Orleans Days sessions, one year after Hank Williams had a hit with a countrified version of the Storyville favorite. One must wonder if Williams’s hit spurred Gabler to have Armstrong record his blues-infused version.)\n\n“Cold, Cold Heart” was already more than just a country hit, though. Williams’s original version was already number one on the country charts when Tony Bennett recorded a straight pop version on July 20, 1951, garnering a number one hit on the Popular charts in the process. For Armstrong’s version, he kept it in pop territory, though with enough of a two-beat feel (arranger Sy Oliver’s specialty) to keep the country crowd happy. Armstrong doesn’t do much with the melody, preferring to sing it straight for the most part and taking an understated trumpet solo before wailing during the closing coda. A perfectly pleasant record but a bit of a letdown after “I Get Ideas” and “A Kiss to Build a Dream On.”\n\nThe same cannot be said for the flip side, “Because of You,” one of my personal favorites of Armstrong’s Decca pop singles. This was another major Tony Bennett hit of the period and it’s a natural fit for Armstrong, who sings it tenderly for the most part, until busting out some dazzling scatting towards the end. His delayed entrance after the trumpet solo is a marvel. But it’s that trumpet solo steals the record, Armstrong in pure powerhouse form as he takes the melody up an octave and into the stratosphere, flexing his spectacular muscles throughout.\n\nIf you listen carefully, there’s a trumpet obligato behind the vocal throughout by none other than Louis Armstrong! George Avakian got the publicity when he had Armstrong overdub himself playing and singing behind his vocal on “Atlanta Blues” on 1954’s Louis Armstrong Plays W.C. Handy but Gabler did it first. It wasn’t easy, however. Armstrong told Variety, “I did a gimmick bit for Decca with ‘Because of You’ and let me tell you, Pops, I won’t do that again.” I’m guessing Avakian didn’t read Variety.\n\nThe coupling of Tony Bennett covers was issued on October 20 and received a rave in Billboard. “Louis, being used to make distinctive readings of top hits, follows thru with another wonderful job on this Tony Bennett hit,” the magazine said of “Cold, Cold Heart.” “Stacks up with his previous similar efforts as a non-competitive coverage which should do well.” Of “Because of You,” the reviewer wrote, “Again Louis is superb in running down the top song of the day. He sings and, via dubbing, plays a trumpet obbligato for himself. A solid coupling for Louis.”\n\nOnce again, thanks to “Decca Data,” we can see that it was yet another successful single. One week after its release, it was the number 11 Decca “Best Bet,” a chart advertised as “Your guide to the hits of tomorrow based on actual sales.” It was the number 4 “Best Bet” on November 3 and number 10 on November 10 before jumping to the number four slot on Decca’s Popular charts"
