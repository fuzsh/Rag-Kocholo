As such, he was often referred to as \"The Dutchman\", the literal meaning of his surname is \"of the decks\". Vanderdecken was a ruthless Captain, not tolerating disrespect from any of his crew. As such, he was overzealous, believing he could sail his ship alone if necessary.\n\nHe also made a point of employing sailors of different nationalities, so that they would be less likely to mutiny against him."
