        "text": "The etymology of many surnames used by Jews in Italy is readily apparent. Yet, there is also a set of surnames that was either considered by previous authors as being of obscure origin or for which whimsical roots were suggested. The size of this set is relatively small, but many are among surnames that are commonly used and often had famous bearers. The article addresses the following names: Almagia, Artom, Chimchi, Cordovero, Cuzzeri, Finzi, Lampronti, Luzzatto, Meldola, Panzieri, Segre, Seppilli, Sforno, de Sola, and Treves.\n\nAlessio BOATTINI/Eugenio BORTOLINI/Roland BAUER/Marta OTTONE/Rossella MIGLIO/Paola GUERESI/Davide PETTENER: Background: Thanks to the availability of rich surname, linguistic and genetic information, together with its geographic and cultural complexity, Trentino (North-Eastern Italy) is an ideal place to test the relationships between genetic and cultural traits. Aim: We provide a comprehensive study of population structures based on surname and dialect variability and evaluate their relationships with genetic diversity in Trentino. Subjects and methods: Surname data were collected for 363 parishes, linguistic data for 57 dialects and genetic data for different sets of molecular markers (Y-chromosome, mtDNA, autosomal) in 10 populations. Analyses relied on different multivariate methods and correlation tests. Results: Besides the expected isolation-by-distance-like patterns (with few local exceptions, likely related to sociocultural instances), we detected a significant and geography-independent association between dialects and surnames. As for molecular markers, only Y-chromosomal STRs seem to be associated with the dialects, although no significant result was obtained. No evidence for correlation between molecular markers and surnames was observed. Conclusion: Surnames act as cultural markers as do other words, although in this context they cannot be used as reliable proxies for genetic variability at a local scale.\n\nL’onomastica di Malta è multistrato e multilingue. In modo particolare i cognomi sono penetrati nell’isola lungo alcuni secoli, conformemente alla complessità delle vicende storiche e linguistiche. alcuni dei cognomi più antichi sono di origine etimologica araba ma la deportazione dei musulmani nel Duecento ruppe i legami dell’isola con il mondo arabo-berbero. Da quei tempi, a parte il recente influsso inglese, le maggiori fonti culturali sono state la Sicilia, l’Italia e altre nazioni europee, in ispecie del mediterraneo. La lunga presenza dei Cavalieri di San Giovanni (1530-1798) moltiplicò la popolazione e il conseguente influsso di cognomi neolatini e continentali. Il presente studio esamina tre documenti rappresentativi che forniscono un quadro affidabile dei loro tempi: (a) l’elenco della Militia del 1419-20, che è il vero punto di partenza per lo studio demografico dell’isola nel periodo tardo-medievale; (b) lo Status Animarum, cioè il censimento diocesano del 1687, che illustra i cognomi del periodo dei Cavalieri; e (c) il censimento nazionale del 2005, che ritrae il profilo sociodemografico della popolazione isolana nel primo decennio del secolo XXI. Maltese onomastics is polystratal and polyglot. Family names, in particular, have reached the island over many centuries in complicated historical and linguistic conditions. Some of the oldest Maltese surnames are of Arabic origin; however, the expulsion of the Muslims in the thirteenth century brought about the final rupture of the powerful cultural ties which had bound Malta to the Arabo-Berber world. Since then, barring latter-day English influence, the dominant cultural driving force in Malta has come from Sicily, Italy and other European, mainly Mediterranean, countries. The prolonged presence of the Knights of St John (1530-1798) produced, in a more pronounced manner, an influx of neo-Latin and continental surnames. The present paper discusses three representative documents which serve as reliable snapshots of their times: (a) the militia List of c. 1419/20, which is truly a starting point for the study of Malta’s demographic make-up in the Late middle ages; (b) the Status Animarum or diocesan census of 1687, which throws significant light on Malta’s cognominal pool in the Hospitaller era; and (c) the national Census of 2005, which provides a socio-demographic profile of the local population in the early years of the twenty-first century."
