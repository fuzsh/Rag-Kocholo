        "text": "WARM is the word for Enzzo’s Trattoria, a peach-hued snuggle of a restaurant that is battling the recession with platters of reasonably priced Italian comfort food. The approach seems to be working  in two visits, this Short Hills place was packed, and Perri Urso, 41, co-owner with her husband, Vincenzo, 45, the chef, was continually kissed and hugged by regulars whom she greeted by name.\n\nEnzzo’s is now in its 15th year, and though it expanded from 35 seats to about 80 in the late ’90s, the real action still occurs in the tiny, original storefront dining room along a busy street of shops that are deserted by dinnertime.\n\nThe menu is a laminated affair with predictable categories, supplemented by a longish specials list, the details of which can get lost in hubbub and plate clatter. Pay attention if chicken Murphy is mentioned. Do not miss this dish, with its tender slabs of sautéed meat dressed with caramelized onions, both sweet and hot cherry peppers, roasted potatoes and a sprinkling of pasta, all drenched with a brown house-made demi-glace.\n\nBut before the main dishes, there are the appetizers  antipasti, salads and soups. The sautéed garlic shrimp on focaccia was a luscious knife-and-fork dish moistened by a lemon-and-white-wine sauce and garlic-olive-oil base, though its generous size pushed the dish from appetizer to appetite suppressant; it was difficult to stop eating it. Antipasto was a vinaigrette-drizzled mix of typical components  marinated artichokes, house-made mozzarella, provolone, prosciutto, house-roasted peppers and sun-dried tomatoes, with, oddly, canned, sliced black olives.\n\nThe orange salad, with its sparkling slices of fruit juxtaposed against anchovy fillets and drizzled with olive oil, approached alchemy, but the spinach leaves and more of those mundane olives seemed out of place. I wished for another green  maybe arugula, watercress or Belgian endive  and nearly any other kind of olive. A Caesar salad (anchovies optional) was credible, though overdressed.\n\nPastas are the foundation of Enzzo’s (a whimsically-spelled diminutive of Mr. Urso’s first name), and the restaurant has worked out the formula: huge portions and too much sauce, but plenty of flavor. Pasta Romano, a blend of bow ties with white beans, escarole, black olives, marinated artichokes and house-roasted red peppers, benefits from having bits of pancetta through the dish. The rigatoni Bolognese, also from a family recipe, looks festive with its sprinkling of green peas, though the sauce was somewhat sticky. The same was true of the gnocchi, though it was the potato pasta, and not the pleasant ricotta cheese and tomato sauce, that did the sticking.\n\nAmong the main courses, a fresh slab of cod, broiled in tomato-herb sauce with capers, onions and more of those black olives, was simply delicious. Veal saltimbocca was beguilingly flavored, with its surfeit of brown sage sauce mixing with prosciutto and truly too much mozzarella; the raw spinach in the dish would have been better cooked, though, and in more generous quantities, and the meat had an occasional bit of gristle. The slim eggplant cutlets were over the top  stuffed with ricotta, pecorino and prosciutto and buried under too much tomato sauce and mozzarella  but the leftovers were eaten and appreciated. On another night, the shrimp oreganata was my favorite: exceedingly tender jumbo shrimp atop a too-generous bed of thin spaghetti, all swimming in a sauce of lemon, white wine and oregano that threatened to flow over the side of the plate and into my lap.\n\nThat’s where the bread came in  the restaurant’s rolls, served hot, with a shatteringly crisp crust surrounding an innocuous center, worked as a foil to any extra sauce, but when I think of Italian bread, I wish for something more interesting. I wish, too, for Italian-style vegetables  broccoli, broccoli rabe, cauliflower, cabbage and kale, Swiss chard, radicchio, zucchini and other squash. They are in short supply here, unfortunately.\n\nEnzzo’s slips on desserts  they were unremarkable, as were the coffees, and not worth the wait. But no matter: The sweetness at this restaurant is simply good and plenty, warmly delivered.\n\nEnzzo’s Trattoria\n\n514 Millburn Avenue\n\nShort Hills\n\n(973) 379-7111\n\nenzzos.com\n\nGOOD\n\nTHE SPACE Two-room dining space seating 80; tight seating on one side, quiet spaciousness on the other. Wheelchair access except for steps at rear entrance.\n\nTHE CROWD Noisy and casual, with an endless parade of regulars; plenty of children. Friendly servers.\n\nTHE BAR Bring your own.\n\nTHE BILL Lunch items, $7 to $16, with specials from $8 to $12. Dinner pastas, $11 to $14; main dishes, $12 to $19. All major credit cards accepted.\n\nWHAT WE LIKE Antipasto, garlic shrimp on focaccia, sliced orange salad, Caesar salad, pasta and bean soup, bow-tie pasta with white beans and escarole, rigatoni Bolognese, chicken Murphy, veal saltimbocca, broiled cod in tomato-herb sauce with capers and black olives, shrimp in lemon-wine sauce over spaghetti."
