        "text": "Philip has completed several graduate classes at Harvard focusing on medical and psychological studies on anxiety, yoga, and mindfulness. His goal, together with Co-facilitator Renee Deslauriers is to identify a more evidence-based approach to yoga classes. An evidence-based approach is more relevant today than ever. For a variety of reasons, levels of anxiety in the United States are rapidly rising. Philip and Renee see yoga studios as a widely-available, low-cost, pharmaceutical-free option that can provide a reliable front-line of resilience against anxiety.\n\nPhilip studied for ten years with Baron Baptiste where he rose to co-facilitator. Following that, in 2009, he co-created Live Love Teach with Stacy Dockins and Deborah Williamson. Today, Live Love Teach, is owned and operated by Philip Urso and Renee Deslauriers. Live Love Teach is one of only a few Yoga Alliance-recognized Yoga Teacher Training schools to maintain a five-star rating with over one-hundred reviews from certified graduates.\n\nWhen not facilitating teacher training with Live Love Teach, Philip leads vinyasa classes regularly at Rhode Island Power Yoga, a studio in North Kingstown, Rhode Island which he co-founded with Renee Deslauriers and Terry Munnelly in 2014. Philip has taught over fifty Teacher Trainings since 2005.\n\nPhilip is also known for his two podcasts: “A Crash Course in Miracles,” and “Yoga Classes- Live Love Teach,” which have millions of downloads. You can find both by searching “philip urso” in Apple’s podcasts. He has also published articles on this website, and on Medium and Elephant Journal."
