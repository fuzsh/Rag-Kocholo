        "text": "PLYMOUTH, Mich. (WILX) - One family’s greatest loss has inspired an opportunity for people to learn about suicide prevention.\n\nThe eighth annual Kevin’s Song Conference on Suicide: Continuing the Conversation, kicked off on Jan. 25 with a summit on youth mental health. The conference is about educating the public to inspire hope and save lives, but it began as Gail and John Urso’s path to healing.\n\n“I think the collective idea was, hey, if we know nothing, it’s probably true that a number of people are not aware of suicide, and the suicide epidemic,” said John.\n\nAfter losing their son, Kevin, to suicide in March of 2013, the Ursos were left in the dark. They knew they couldn’t be the only people struggling to understand why someone they love would take their own life.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention estimates that every suicide effects over 100 people, and it remains one of the leading causes of death in the United States.\n\nAt the same time, the number of suicides continues to grow, with the rate of suicide increasing by 2.6% between 2021 and 2022, according to the CDC. That’s why, only six months after their son’s death, the Ursos started Kevin’s Song.\n\n“Everyone grieves differently, “said Gail. “So, for a lot of people who have lost someone to suicide, they may just want to read books, or be with their close circle of family and friends. Our way of grieving was to do something.”\n\nThat something was gathering leaders in mental health research to educate those who are most likely to cross paths with people at risk of committing suicide, like counselors, teachers and doctors.\n\n“We hope to provide a forum for the latest in research and the latest in treatment options so that the clinicians who leave here are better qualified and better capable to help them and make a difference,” said Leo Nouhan, conference coordinator, and member of the Kevin’s Song board of directors.\n\nNouhan said the information on suicide that’s available today is vastly different when compared to suicide and mental health research from decades past. It’s an ever-changing field, and as risk factors, coping mechanisms, and resources continue to develop, he said it’s crucial that it be communicated to people who can intervene when someone they know is struggling.\n\nAside from the professionals, the Ursos believe suicide prevention education is just as important for the everyday person. If everyone knows the signs, they can not only identify those signs in classmates, family, friends or coworkers, but know what steps to take to help them.\n\nThe Ursos said it’s Kevin’s love for music that inspired the organization’s name, but it’s their love for Kevin that inspired action to keep families whole.\n\n“You grieve, and you attempt to heal,” John said. “A lot of negative energy was turned into positive things with regard to the formation of this organization.”\n\nThe Kevin’s Song Conference on Suicide will through Saturday, Jan. 27 at the Saint John’s Resort in Plymouth. However, the organization raises awareness to the suicide epidemic year-round.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather."
