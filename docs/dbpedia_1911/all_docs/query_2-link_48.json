        "text": "He began the season with the chicken pox. Then he lost his first two decisions. After a 13-0 mark as a junior, Salvy Urso, the left-handed ace of the Plant pitching staff, proved he was human after all. His time among the mortals didn't last long, though. Urso won his next 11 decisions and led the Panthers to their third straight appearance in the Class 3A state final four.\n\nThe senior also slugged 10 home runs and drove in 43 runs, both county highs, and batted .359, splitting his time between pitching and playing first base.\n\nAlthough he lost his final high school decision 11-5 to Satellite Beach in the state semifinals, Urso finished with a 11-3 mark, a 1.70 earned-run average, and 102 strikeouts.\n\nFor these achievements, Urso is the St. Petersburg Times Hillsborough County Player of the Year for the second consecutive time.\n\n\"I missed 2{ weeks at the beginning of the season,\" Urso said. \"When I lost those first two, I really thought I wasn't 100 percent yet. I felt I didn't have my velocity. I kept working hard, though. Instead of just working with the team, I had to go work on my own. I wanted to get back as quick as possible.\"\n\nThe Seattle Mariners drafted Urso in the 30th round of this week's draft, leaving him with a choice to make. He already had signed a letter of intent to play for the University of Miami.\n\nClass 4A state runner-up Brandon placed the most players on the all-county first team _ four. They are pitcher Gary Graham, catcher Troy Dean, shortstop Rodd Kelley and outfielder Jimmy White.\n\nGraham had the best pitching record in the county this season, 13-1. His only loss came in relief, 10-9 to Altamonte Springs-Lake Brantley in the state final. Graham posted a 2.06 ERA, struck out 83 and walked 16 in 95 innings.\n\nA teammate of Urso's, T.J. Rood, went 9-1 with a team-best 1.29 ERA and claims another first-team pitching spot. Jesuit's Marc Valdes, who was 10-6 but had the most strikeouts (131 in 86 innings) and lowest ERA (0.81) in the county, rounds out the first-team staff. Valdes' pitching records eclipsed those set by former Jesuit Tiger and current New York Met Dave Magadan.\n\nGraham's battery mate, Troy Dean, is the county's top catcher. Dean batted .366 with 20 RBI. He also walked 26 times and scored 24 runs. Dean and teammates Graham and Kelley all signed letters of intent to attend the University of Tampa.\n\nKelley hit .392 in the lead-off spot for the Eagles this season. He stole 27 bases in 30 attempts and finished with team highs in runs (33), hits (38), doubles (seven) and RBI (24).\n\nJoining Kelley and Urso in the infield are two of the county's top student-athletes: Jefferson second baseman Manish Patel and Jesuit third baseman Jason Raeckers. Patel, who batted .373 this season, has been accepted at Yale. Raeckers, a .359 hitter, will attend Georgetown.\n\nHillsborough's Carl Everett, Brandon's Jimmy White and Chamberlain's Jimmy Riggio make up the all-county outfield.\n\nEverett, who was chosen 10th overall by the New York Yankees in the draft, had the scouts drooling with his county-high .519 batting average. White hit only .275, but the Houston Astros chose him in the sixth round of the draft. He finished with four homers and 29 RBI. Riggio hit .282 with six homers and 28 RBI.\n\nLamar Cherry, the best hitter in Armwood history, earns the designated-hitter spot with a .479 average, 35 runs and 17 RBI. Chamberlain shortstop Allen Parker, cited by many coaches one of the top three infielders in the county this year, was named to the first team as a utility player.\n\nRobert Campbell, who took the Eagles to the state championship game, is the Times' selection for Coach of the Year.\n\nCampbell brought a team that was unranked in the preseason to a No.\n\n1 state ranking, a No.\n\n15 USA Today national ranking, a 19-game winning streak, and within one strike of its first state title.\n\n\"I think the kids on this team kept developing and improving,\" said Campbell, whose squad finished 28-3.\n\n\"It wasn't like we hit a real low. We kept rising to the occasion.\"\n\nCampbell attributed Brandon's success to a team-oriented attitude among the players and coaches.\n\n\"There can be factions, and it can be cancer to a team,\" Campbell said. \"Our goal isn't to win state; it's to have fun. The rest is all gravy.\"\n\nAll-Hillsborough baseball team\n\nPlayer of the year _ Salvy Urso, Plant\n\nCoach of the Year _ Robert Campbell, Brandon\n\nFIRST TEAM\n\nPosition Name Gr.
