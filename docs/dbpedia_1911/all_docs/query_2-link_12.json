Today wasn't just another day at the office—because we weren't at the office at all! The team and I seized the chance to step away from our usual surroundings for a crucial strategy day. And what better way to discuss next year’s plans than face-to-face? A big shoutout to Alliance Healthcare in the UK & Daniel Rudland for hosting us. You came through in spectacular fashion, providing the perfect space for our discussions. Today was about synchronising our watches, We reviewed plans for the coming year to ensure we’re all aligned. The face-to-face interaction was invaluable, never grow tired of saying this 😂😂 face to face is the future! Ideas flowed more naturally, and it felt like we broke down silos just by stepping outside of them. Setting our sights on the future, we have a clearer understanding of what needs to be done. Watch this space for exciting updates in the coming months. Big thanks again to Alliance Healthcare. Your hospitality didn’t just facilitate our strategy day; it made it a roaring success. Here’s to taking these insights and turning them into actionable results for the benefit of our patients, pharmacists, and the broader business. #AsdaPharmacy #AllianceHealthcare #StrategyDay #TeamAlignment #FutureFocus #pharmacy #pharmacist Piotr Katrina Richard Trevor Mohit Rupal Maq Katie Nicola Egle Jennifer Lottie Merjana Faye Shafiya\n\nWe've walked in your shoes, looking into quiet Clinic halls and asking ourselves, \"Why can't we find the GPs we truly need?\" It's more than just filling spaces; it's about connecting with the kind of talent that not only fits but enhances our practices.
