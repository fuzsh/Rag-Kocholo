        "text": "Oscar Pettiford - [1953] The New Oscar Pettiford Sextet with Phil Urso, Julius Watkins, Walter Bishop, Charles Mingus, Percy Brice / Louis Hjulmand, Jan Johansson / Red Rodney, Al Cohn, Earl Swope, Serge Chaloff, Barbara Carroll, Terry Gibbs, Denzil Best\n\nFull album (11 tracks): http://vk.com/audios-31738390?album_id=55526960\n\nOriginal album liner notes:\n\nOscar Pettiford needs no introduction to the jazz world where he holds the enviable reputation of bassist and cellist par excellence.\n\nBorn on an Indian reservation in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, on September 30,1922, at 12:05 midnight (and still a stickler for detail!), Oscar became a musician more of necessity than by choice. His father \"Doc\" Pettiford, a practicing veterinarian who had pursued music as a hobby, finally gave up the former for the more lucrative latter. With his wife, who taught music, and the six Pettifords who preceded Oscar (Leontine, Harry, Cecile, Ira, Margie, and Alonzo), he formed the \"Doc Pettiford and His Family Orchestra\" which toured throughout the Midwest. Although the entire family doubled on most of the instruments, no one played bass. Consequently, Oscar was a natural for this instrument and briefly studied piano, guitar, and trombone before filling the much-needed bass chair.\n\nPreferring medicine to music and feeling more of an inclination to become a doctor than a musician, when he was fourteen Oscar tentatively expressed this desire to his father. Shocked at finding a traitor under his own roof, Doc not only denounced him as such but listed all the many reasons he should and would be a musician, driving such good advice home and into Oscar's head with the aid of a well-aimed drumstick. Needless to say, Oscar was convinced.\n\nSomehow, between engagements, the family managed to spend enough time in Minneapolis for the children to complete their educations and today Oscar always thinks of Minneapolis as \"home.\" The family orchestra, including five more Pettifords who followed Oscar (Rosemary, Helen, Katherine, Alice, and Joseph), continued to play together until Doc Pettiford's death in 1943, at which time they disbanded.\n\nAfter that, Oscar began to make a name for himself with such bands as Charlie Barnet, Duke Ellington, and Woody Herman. In 1943, with Dizzy Gillespie, he formed the first modern jazz quintet to play what was later known as \"bebop,\" and it was for this group that Oscar first began to compose. His growing popularity was reflected in his winning of the Metronome and Esquire All-Star Awards for bassist in 1944 and 1945. Oscar went to California with Coleman Hawkins, where he appeared in a motion picture, The Crimson Canary. He then joined Duke Ellington, and was a featured soloist with the band until 1948 when he formed a trio with George Shearing and J.C. Heard which played for a long while at the Clique Club (the present Birdland). Shearing took over the trio when Oscar left to join Woody Herman's herd for a nationwide concert tour. His stay with Woody was abruptly terminated in 1949 when he broke his arm playing softball with the band team.\n\nWhile with Woody's band, Oscar had once substituted a cello for his bass solo as a gag on Woody. The immediate response of the band and the audience convinced Oscar of its great potentialities as a jazz instrument. Now that his arm was in a cast, Oscar began to give a great deal of thought to writing expressly for cello and its development as a solo instrument in jazz. His work on cello with the various small groups under his leadership since 1950 is now a matter of music history.\n\nWith his new sextet, recorded for the first time in this album, Oscar explores new possibilities in writing for French horn and tenor. This is especially notable in \"Tamalpais,\" an enchanting ballad tided after a beautiful mountain near San Francisco, where the accent is on counterpoint between these two horns: the mountains portrayed by Watkins, the winds by Urso. Oscar momentarily forsakes cello to play bass on this one composition.\n\nThe swinging \"Pendulum\" and romping \"Fieldstalker\" both show off fine cello by Oscar. The pace is kept by Phil Urso's swinging tenor and Julius Watkins's nimbly-executed solo on French horn.\n\n\"Stockholm Sweetnin',\" from the pen of Quincy Jones, provides a medium-jump tempo vehicle for Oscar and the other soloists, with an interesting first chorus by Walter Bishop on piano leading into the blowing fine.\n\n\"Low and Behold\" is a real \"tradition piece\" for Oscar who is very much at home and at his blues-swinging best here.\n\nOn these recordings with Oscar is another formidable string man—Charles Mingus—who walks sure-footedly and solidly on these sides (except for \"Tamalpais\" on which Oscar plays bass), kicking the rhythm section with his usual great bass and coming in for fine solo work on \"Pendulum.\" Percy Brice on drums rounds out the rhythm complement.\n\nPersonnel #1-3, 5-6:\n\nOscar Pettiford - cello (bass on 2)\n\nPhil Urso - tenor sax\n\nJulius Watkins - French horn\n\nWalter Bishop - piano\n\nCharles Mingus - bass (except 2)\n\nPercy Brice - drums\n\nRecorded in New York, December 29, 1953\n\nPersonnel #4 & 7:\n\nOscar Pettiford - bass\n\nLouis Hjulmand - vibes\n\nJan Johansson - piano\n\nRecorded in Copenhagen, Denmark, August 22, 1959\n\nPersonnel #8-11:\n\nOscar Pettiford - bass\n\nRed Rodney - trumpet\n\nAl Cohn - tenor sax\n\nEarl Swope - trombone\n\nSerge Chaloff - baritone sax\n\nBarbara Carroll - piano\n\nTerry Gibbs - vibes\n\nDenzil Best - drums\n\nShorty Rogers - arranger\n\nRecorded in New York, March 10, 1949\n\nReissue 1999\n\nOJC/Debut Records (OJCCD 1926-2)\n\nFLAC (tracks+.cue), 213 MB:\n\nhttp://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3090113\n\nmp3/320kbps .zip 102mb (c) jazz-jazz.ru:\n\nhttp://rusfolder.com/25386965\n\n#jazz #jazzulove #bebop #HistoricalJazz #OriginalJazzClassics #JazzCello\n\n#OscarPettiford #PhilUrso #JuliusWatkins #WalterBishop #CharlesMingus #PercyBrice #LouisHjulmand #JanJohansson #RedRodney #AlCohn #EarlSwope #SergeChaloff #BarbaraCarroll #TerryGibbs #DenzilBest"
