This document is a bill introduced in the New York State Assembly to amend laws relating to name changes and gender designation changes. Specifically, it would enact the \"Gender Recognition Act\" to remove publication requirements for name changes, allow courts to seal name change records for safety reasons, and establish a process for petitioning courts to change the sex designation on identity documents. The bill aims to make it easier for transgender and non-binary individuals to update identifying documents to match their gender identity.",
