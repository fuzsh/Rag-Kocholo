        "text": "Fisher History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nGermany\n\nIreland\n\nWhen the ancestors of the Fisher family arrived in England following the Norman Conquest of 1066, they brought their name with them. It is a name for a person who worked as a fisherman. Looking back even further, we found the name was originally derived from the Old English word fischer. 1\n\n\"This seems to be a sufficiently obvious derivation from the calling of a fisherman, especially since ' fisher ' occurs in our version of the New Testament in this sense; and Leland in his Itinerary usually describes the smaller sea-coast places as \"fischar tounes.\" In Domesday [Book] and other early records, we meet with the forms Piscator, Le Pecheur, etc.\" 2\n\n\"In the time of King Stephen the family of Fitz-Urse (a name which in after days degenerated into Fitzour, Fyshour, and Fisher) became possessed of the great manor of Williton; they had their descent from that Urso, or Ursus, who in the time of William the Conqueror held lands in Grittleton, and other parts of Wiltshire, of the Abbey of Glastonbury. The first of the name who enjoyed this manor was Richard Fitz Urse, who died about 14 Hen. II., leaving issue three sons ; Sir Reginald, Sir Robert, and Walter. Sir Reginald, the eldest, had his residence at Williton, in a house which he afterwards gave to his brother Robert, with a moiety of this manor. This Sir Reginald was among the courtiers standing in the presence chamber at Bur, near Bayeux, a few days before Christmas 1170, when the King gave audience to the three prelates that had been excommunicated by Thomas a Beckett, and came to lay their complaint before him.\" 3\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Fisher family\n\nThe surname Fisher was first found in Essex, where Richard le Fischer was listed in the Feet of Fines in 1263. Years later, Ralph de Fissharâ€™ was listed in the Subsidy Rolls for Sussex in 1296. 4\n\nIn early records the name was often listed in Latin as \"piscator\" as seen by this record found in Scotland: Robert dominus Piscator, burgess of Perth, 1292. The Latin version quickly deferred to a more English version when \"Michael Fysser who appears in record in 1344 as bailie of Perth is probably the Michaele Fisser recorded in 1338. \" 5\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Fisher family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Fisher research. Another 185 words (13 lines of text) covering the years 1455, 1488, 1513, 1514, 1603, 1605, 1613, 1616, 1623, 1655, 1661, 1665, 1683, 1693, 1698, 1702, 1705, 1826, 1827, 1890 and 1956 are included under the topic Early Fisher History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nFisher Spelling Variations\n\nEndless spelling variations are a prevailing characteristic of Norman surnames. Old and Middle English lacked any definite spelling rules, and the introduction of Norman French added an unfamiliar ingredient to the English linguistic stew. French and Latin, the languages of the court, also influenced spellings. Finally, Medieval scribes generally spelled words according to how they sounded, so one person was often referred to by different spellings in different documents. The name has been spelled Fisher, Fischer and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Fisher family\n\nOutstanding amongst the family at this time was\n\nSir Thomas Fisher\n\nSir Robert Fisher, 1st Baronet of Great Packington, Warwickshire\n\nSamuel Fisher (1605-1665) was an English Quaker controversialist from Northampton\n\nPayne Fisher (1616-1693), an English poet\n\nJoseph Fisher (c. 1655-1705), an English churchman, Archdeacon of Carlisle (1702 until his death)\n\nFisher World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Fisher is the 113rd most popular surname with an estimated 191,499 people with that name. 6 However, in Canada, the name Fisher is ranked the 164th most popular surname with an estimated 21,163 people with that name. 7 And in Newfoundland, Canada, the name Fisher is the 354th popular surname with an estimated 131 people with that name. 8 Australia ranks Fisher as 102nd with 25,685 people. 9 New Zealand ranks Fisher as 143rd with 3,453 people. 10 The United Kingdom ranks Fisher as 92nd with 50,646 people. 11 South Africa ranks Fisher as 525th with 13,540 people. 12\n\nMigration of the Fisher family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Fisher family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 57 words (4 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nFisher migration to the United States +\n\nTo escape the political and religious persecution within England at the time, many English families left for the various British colonies abroad. The voyage was extremely difficult, though, and the cramped, dank ships caused many to arrive in the New World diseased and starving. But for those who made it, the trip was most often worth it. Many of the families who arrived went on to make valuable contributions to the emerging nations of Canada and the United States. An inquiry into the early roots of North American families reveals a number of immigrants bearing the name Fisher or a variant listed above:\n\nFisher Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nMr. Robert Fisher, who arrived in Virginia aboard the ship \"Elizabeth\" in 1611 13\n\nMrs. Katherine Fisher, who arrived in Virginia in 1621 aboard the ship \"Marmaduke\" 13\n\nHenry Fisher, who settled in Virginia in 1623 with his wife and children\n\nEdward Fisher, who arrived in Virginia in 1620 aboard the ship \"Jonathan\" 14\n\nMrs. Sarah Fisher, who arrived in Virginia in 1624 aboard the ship \"Warwick\" 13\n\n...

By 1838, the British New Zealand Company had begun buying land from the Maori tribes, and selling it to settlers, and, after the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, many British families set out on the arduous six month journey from Britain to Aotearoa to start a new life.

They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 21\n\nFisher Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nMr. Robert Fisher, (b. 1625), aged 10, British settler travelling aboard the ship \"The Dorset\" arriving in Barbados in September 1635 22\n\nMr. Edward Fisher, (b. 1608), aged 27, British settler traveling aboard the ship \"Paul of London\" arriving in St Christopher (Saint Kitts) in 1635 23\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Fisher (post 1700) +\n\nBrenda Fisher (1927-2022), English long-distance swimmer who broke the women's world record for swimming the English Channel in 1951\n\nJames Bernard Fisher (1934-2022), English professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper in the Football League for Hull City (1955-1963) and Bradford City (1963-1965)\n\nJohn Alfred \"Jackie\" Fisher (1925-2022), English footballer who played as a left-back in the Football League, twin brother of George Fisher\n\nMichael Ellis Fisher (1931-2021), English physicist, chemist and mathematician, known for his many seminal contributions to statistical physics, including the theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena, co-winner of the 1980 Wolf Prize for Physics\n\nGeorge Sidney Fisher (1925-2015), English footballer who played from 1942 to 1960 for a total of 458 matches\n\nSir Nigel Thomas Loveridge Fisher (1913-1996), Conservative Party politician\n\nSir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1890-1962), English statistician, evolutionary biologist, eugenicist and geneticist awarded the Darwin Medal in 1948\n\nJohn Arbuthnot Fisher (1841-1920), English naval commander\n\nRight Honorable Herbert Albert Laurens Fisher (1865-1940), English historian\n\nGrant Jackson Fisher (b. 1997), American middle- and long-distance runner\n\n...

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Respice finem\n\nMotto Translation: Regard the end.\n\nSuggested Readings for the name Fisher +\n\nBlue Ridge Mountain Kinfolks: A Record of Ancestors, Descendants, and Relative of the Author and Wife, Including Fisher-Gilbert-HAll-Harley-Hill-King-Kirby-Lawson Families by Larry King.\n\nThe Descendants of Nathan Cramer-Alazana Fisher, Including Allied Families and Genealogical Notes: Applegate, Ball, Bean, Cheney, Cox, Crammer, Fessenden, Hensley, Lyon, Mourning, Stookey, Wright by Dolores Cramer Wolf.\n\nCitations +\n\nSmith, Eldson Coles, New Dictionary of American Family Names New York: Harper & Row, 1956.
