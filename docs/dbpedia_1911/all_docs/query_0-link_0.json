        "text": "Urso History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nItaly\n\nThe distinguished surname Urso originated in an area of Italy, known as the Papal States. Although people were originally known only by a single name, it became necessary for people to adapt a second name to identify themselves as populations grew and travel became more frequent. The process of adopting fixed hereditary surnames was not complete until the modern era, but the use of hereditary family names in Italy began in the 10th and 11th centuries. Italian hereditary surnames were developed according to fairly general principles and they are characterized by a profusion of derivatives coined from given names. The most traditional type of family name found in the region of the Papal States is the patronymic surname, which is derived from the father's given name. During the Middle Ages, Italians adopted the patronymic system of name-making because it perfectly complemented the prevailing Feudal System. In Italy the popularity of patronymic type of surname is also due to the fact that during the Christian era, people often named their children after saints and biblical figures. The surname Urso came from the name Orso, which is derived from the Latin name Ursus, meaning bear.\n\nEarly Origins of the Urso family\n\nThe surname Urso was first found in Forli (Latin: Forum Livii), a comune and city in Emilia-Romagna, capital of the province of Forli-Cesena. The Church of S. Mercuriale is notable.\n\nCastello Ursino (Bear Castle), also known as Castello Svevo di Catania, is a castle in Catania, Sicily, southern Italy that was built in the 13th century. Built between 1239 and 1250, it was one of the royal castles of Emperor Frederick II, King of Sicily. Over the years it had fallen into ruin but in 1932, the castle was acquired by the city of Catania and restored to its original grandeur.\n\nEarly History of the Urso family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Urso research.
