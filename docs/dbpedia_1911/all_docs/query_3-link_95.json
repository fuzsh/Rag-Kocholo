        "text": "Philip Urso loves teaching yoga teachers to deliver exhilarating and unscripted yoga classes. He is a Live Love Teach™ cofounder whose two five-star podcasts on iTunes—A Crash Course in Miracles and Yoga Classes Live Love Teach—investigate what it means to teach and live from love. The podcasts have been downloaded more than 1.5 million times. These concepts form the foundation of his teaching and fuel his frequent articles for Elephant Journal. Philip first studied Siddha Yoga, then Kripalu Yoga with Anita Bussey, followed by 10 years of comprehensive vinyasa training. He is a fluent teacher of A Course in Miracles, which feeds his teaching and his life coaching."
