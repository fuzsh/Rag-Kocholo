        "text": "Data Transparency and Trust: Understanding WebMD Doctor Listings and Reviews\n\nWe know that finding the right doctor or provider is important to your health. Thatâs why we want to ensure you have confidence in the provider profiles and listings you see on WebMD Care. Our provider data is sourced from the physicians themselves as well as publicly available databases. Any doctor or provider who claims their profile by verifying themselves can update their information and provide additional data on their specialties, education, accepted insurances, conditions they treat, and procedures they perform.\n\nAll the physician and provider reviews on WebMD Care are provided by users just like you. Knowing these reviews provide insight into how other patients feel about a doctor, we maintain internal policies and protocols to ensure the quality and accuracy of all reviews. Providers are not able to remove or modify reviews on their own. Reviews can only be removed after an internal review by our customer service team."
