        "text": "Sorry to say it but, since he has been Minister of Business and Made in Italy, Adolfo Urso He didn't get one right, not even by mistake. But the crazy idea of ​​the intervention of the Italian state in Stellantis to balance the presence of the French state risks being its final Caporetto. If his statism of returning to the car were to gain traction, Urso would go down in the annals as the minister who chased the illusion of a new Alfa Romeo at the expense of the taxpayer precisely at the moment in which the Government does not know how to find the resources to prevent the collapse of the largest European steel plant such as that ofex Ilva of Taranto. But what would be the point of investing Italian money to try to counterbalance, in the name of economic sovereignty, the presence of the French state in Stellantis? It makes no sense. Not only because it would be a very expensive investment for the Italian state coffers - more than 6 billion euros at current stock market prices - but because it would be of absolutely no use as the main shareholders of the Franco-Italian car manufacturer effectively hold the majority of Stellantis with 27,4% of the capital but 43,8% of the voting rights, of which 9,6 are held by the French CDP. The hypothetical public investment in Stellantis would only be a disposable investment even if, to top the paradoxes, the regurgitations of statism they seduce the radical left, from Fiom-Cgil al Elly Schlein's Pd and the Five Star Movement Giuseppe Conte, not to mention Carlo Calenda, who rediscovered his old job as spokesperson for the former President of Ferrari, Luca Montezemolo, notoriously irritated with Agnelli house since he was ousted from the Maranello team. It would be much more sensible for the Italian Government to adopt an industrial policy worthy of the name which is based on an honorable and transparent exchange between State and company as other countries do: public incentives to support the certain increase in production volumes of cars in Italy and in particular the electric car. It would be enough to give up the fake display of muscles and use the brain. But this does not seem to be Minister Urso's propensity."
