        "text": "Joseph P. Urso (Chief Executive Officer)'s thirst for knowledge and entrepreneurial spirit led him to foresee the inevitability of global pandemics and the need for reliable and safe air, water, and surface solutions. He purchased Electrolux North America in 1998 and transformed the company into what is today ActivePure Technologies, LLC – an industry leader in creating better indoor environments and helping organizations achieve their ESG goals. The company’s flagship Active Advanced Photocatalysis (ActivePure) Technology—a key cornerstone of business growth—now provides peace of mind to businesses, schools, healthcare facilities, government centers, and individuals around the world. Joe Urso is the winner of the 2022 Entrepreneur Of The Year for Ernst & Young’s Central Plains Region, as well as a finalist at the national level.\n\n“It’s an honor to lead our team as we reduce microburdens, transform health outcomes and drive ESG goals across the world.”\n\nAmy Carenza (Chief Commercial Officer) is responsible for the development and implementation of global strategy and sales for ActivePure Technology in corporate and institutional end markets. Through this role, she helps organizations achieve their ESG goals while keeping an eye on energy efficiency and peace of mind. Carenza has over 20 years of experience assisting mid-cap and large-cap companies strategically identify and optimally execute growth opportunities; her research and achievements in this vein have garnered multiple patents. Before joining ActivePure in 2021, Carenza enjoyed a distinguished career in financial services, most recently as a Managing Director at PNC.\n\n“Returning to normal will be a disservice. We should all demand and expect a return to better than normal.”\n\nDeborah L. Birx, MD (Chief Medical & Science Advisor) is one of the foremost immunologists and pandemic infectious disease experts in the world. As former director of CDC's Division of Global HIV/AIDS (DGHA) from 2005-2014 and U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, State Department from 2014-2021, she has managed infectious disease responses under three U.S. presidents. Birx oversaw the implementation of the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in history. She also oversaw U.S. government engagement with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Serving as the U.S. Special Representative for Global Health Diplomacy from 2015 to 2021, she aligned the U.S. government’s diplomacy with foreign assistance programs that address global health challenges and accelerate progress toward achieving an AIDS-free generation, ending preventable child and maternal deaths, and preventing, detecting, and responding to infectious disease threats. Before joining ActivePure, Birx served as the White House Coronavirus Task Force Coordinator from March 2020 to January 2021. Birx is a decorated Army physician, retiring in 2008 with the rank of Colonel.\n\n“I was looking at other indoor air quality solutions on the market, but I ended up working with ActivePure, because they are focused on investing in the science.”\n\nKevin Hickey started with ActivePure in 1977 when it was still known as Electrolux USA. In 1998, as an Executive Vice President, he was instrumental in supporting the Field Sales organization during the company’s expansion into healthy home products. Hickey has served as President since 2010, where his planning and execution have kept air purifiers flowing to wherever customers need them most—from the 2015 Porter Ranch gas leak to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“I’m grateful to be on the front lines of the battle for peace of mind. The number of people we’ve helped—I’m grateful for it every day.”\n\nPhilip Urso is responsible for integrating the efforts of ActivePure’s marketing, sales, and customer support teams into one strategic spearhead. Urso started with the company in 2006 as an Aerus sales representative. In 2017, he became the President of Allergy Buyers Club, ActivePure’s B2C eCommerce site for the allergen-conscious consumer. Urso rejoined the main ActivePure executive team in 2020 to head its COVID-19 business development strategy.\n\n“We have one of the most important products in existence for changing how we think about indoor air. It’s a revolution comparable to the development of municipal water disinfection.”\n\nAndy Eide is the head of the research team that developed ActivePure’s signature, proprietary technology. Eide and his team spent eight years refining a solution for pathogen reduction in homes, schools, and businesses to create Advanced Active Photocatalysis (ActivePure). As ActivePure was based on a concept originally developed for space travel, Eide was inducted into the Space Technology Hall of Fame in 2017. Eide is personally responsible for 35 of ActivePure’s patents. Today, Eide continues to perfect and develop products which improve indoor spaces for all. He also heads ActivePure and ActivePure Medical’s manufacturing and engineering teams.\n\n“Taking the original space technology and transforming it into something targeted enough that it could be used by individuals but powerful enough it could help sports arenas—that was the challenge. ActivePure Technology was the answer to that challenge.”"
