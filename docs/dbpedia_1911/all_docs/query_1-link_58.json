        "text": "Donna DeVine is one of the strongest vocal jazz artists today, but she didn’t just start there. She started receiving recognition in her home town of Roseburg, Oregon, by being selected as a freshman to play the lead Marion the Librarian in a local production of ‘The Music Man.’ It sold out every show at a large college auditorium, adding additional shows by request. The show was met with such notoriety that the cast of University Of Oregon, who was performing it also that year, came to see the production.\n\nShe followed by lead roles in multiple musicals, most notably her stirring performance as Maria in ‘West Side Story.’\n\nShe brought this solid start as a powerful vocalist in the Purduettes Show Choir; auditioned for in strict competition at Purdue University. She was selected as one of the three leads in the Purduettes’ jazz touring trio, singing to 5,000+-sized crowds and doing alumni tours all over the state of Florida and extensively in Indiana. She was awarded the coveted title of Purduette of the Year.\n\nAfter relocating to Denver she took a step to tackle another musical style by becoming the lead singer in a crossover country-rock band called Prairie’s Edge, honing her modern country/rock music singing skills all around the Colorado region.\n\nDonna then became the lead singer in a Rock band which she co-founded called Flash Point, where she grew to love and know the power of performing classic contemporary rock and pop songs with a strong rock guitar and percussion ensemble in and around Denver.\n\nAfter meeting John Hines, she returned to her jazz roots by becoming his lead singer. Her ability to absolutely mesmerize a crowd was instantly recognized, and only grew over time. Because of her diverse vocal experience over the years she has brought an ability to sing not only the timeless jazz standards, but also contemporary, popular songs ranging from Janis Joplin and Tina Turner to Norah Jones, Queen Latifah, Diane Reeves, Sting, John Lennon, and even Lady Gaga. The versatility that she brings vocally to the group brings ‘a little something” for everyone to enjoy. The trombone-vocal duet arrangements of these songs bring a fresh new twist to melodies which instantly connect in a whole new way.\n\nShe can croon with the best on the jazz ballads that can bring goose bumps, and in addition you can hear Donna’s strong, clear vocals on “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy” and ‘You & I.’\n\nIn 2017, Donna joined the Denver Jazz Orchestra as their lead singer, bringing her vocal talents to the public in a big band setting.\n\nAnd in December 2018, Donna is performing with the Colorado Springs Philharmonic Orchestra for their New Year's Eve 'Swing, Swing, Swing' concert, performing 10 jazz songs in an orchestral, concert hall setting, at the Pikes Peak Performing Arts Center.\n\nIn 2022, John and Donna relocated to Daytona Beach, FL, and are continuing to create and perform music in Central/NE Florida.\n\nIn an era where true vocal talent is often overshadowed by quirky, warbly pop singers, Donna’s pitch-perfect, expressive tonality and remarkable stylistic range will be a welcome, refreshing addition to any jazz library."
