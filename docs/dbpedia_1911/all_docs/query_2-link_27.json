        "text": "The event is June 6-8, but let's break that schedule down ‚¨áÔ∏è It's officially a three-day event, but check out the breakdown of what each day looks like commitment-wise. Thursday, June 6 - Trivia Competition at Naked River Brewing Co. from 5-8 PM - You'll only need to send 5 people to represent the company, although you're welcome to bring more to cheerlead/support/have some drinks Friday, June 7 - Bowling Competition at Spare Time from 12:30 PM - 4:30 PM - You'll send 5-10 people to represent the company on the bowling team. You can pick a time from 12:30 PM - 4:30 PM to stop by, whatever your team prefers. Saturday, June 8 - The Field Day Event at Finley Stadium and First Horizon Pavilion - Officially 7:30 AM - 4 PM - This is the day you want the entire company to come out. It's way more fun if you have everyone come out and stay/tailgate all day, but if you have employees who need to pop in and out, they are welcome to. Corporate Challenge is flexible so people can still participate even if they can't stay all day. It's also family-friendly - families are more than welcome to come out and support, although they cannot physically participate in the challenges.\n\nü§´When a golf coach says your shot is bad you have created doubt, even anxiety in the student‚Äôs mind. That means your ancient brain, your amygdala, has created cortisol and possibly adrenaline which are sent as neurotransmitters to your body/muscles. ü•∫This is not ever what a golfer need hear on the course it wrecks the rest of their game. To differentiate between opinions and facts offers little help. ü§≠This is why outdated golf training is such poor methodology!!! ü§©Keeping the negativity at bay is critical unless you don‚Äôt mind high blood pressure, contracting muscles and heart racing. Old school golf coaching misses these key sport training techniques! üëäüèªYes preshot routines show imagery, but never use bad as a tool to teach. Every shot is good so what if there is a mis-hit every golfer does that. This coach should have explained this in-depth to the student!!!"
