        "text": "Philip Urso\n\nPhilip studied for ten years with Baron Baptiste where he rose to co-facilitator. Following that, in 2009, he co-created Live Love Teach. When not facilitating teacher training with Live Love Teach, Philip leads vinyasa classes regularly at Rhode Island Power Yoga. Philip has completed several graduate classes at Harvard focusing on medical and psychological studies on anxiety, yoga, and mindfulness. His goal, together with LLT co-owner Renee Deslauriers, is to identify a more evidence-based approach to yoga classes. An evidence-based approach is more relevant today than ever. For a variety of reasons, levels of anxiety in the United States continue to rise rapidly. Philip and Renee see yoga studios as a widely-available, low-cost, pharmaceutical-free option that can provide a reliable front-line of resilience against anxiety.\n\n\"Destroy your script. Relentlessly become a beginner again, for the rest of your teaching years. Question every word. Everything.\" - Philip\n\nRenee Deslauriers\n\nRenee has been practicing yoga regularly for over 32-years and teaching classes for nearly 28-years. Some of Renee’s most influential teachers have been Mary Ann Nassa, Donna Nassa, Rajashree Choudhury and Baron Baptiste. Since 2013 Renee has co-facilitated fourty 200 hour-level Live Love Teach modules and twenty-five 500-level advanced intensives. Renee, with Philip Urso, explores evidence-based approaches to teaching yoga classes. Together they are refining class-design to give students the maximum experience of yoga’s central mindfulness practices in a compelling and commercially-successful format. They are perfecting this widely-inclusive class design at Rhode Island Power Yoga -a yoga studio they opened with Terry Munnelly in 2014. The business is run on Live Love Teach principles and is thriving. Since the studio’s opening, Renee has managed its operations including customer relations, marketing and teacher development. She also teaches upwards of eight classes per week at RI Power Yoga.\n\n\"What teachers discover in our training is that teaching is never about them. To be most effective as a teacher, teaching must be 100% about the students.\" - Renee"
