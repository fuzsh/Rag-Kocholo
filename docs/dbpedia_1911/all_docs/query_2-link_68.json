        "text": "Police have charged a prospective PL local council candidate for harassment and incitement after she had linked the Facebook profile of an activist on three groups for PL supporters.\n\nAngele Camilleri posted Tina Urso’s photo and Facebook profile on the groups last year in retaliation for Urso having protested in London against Prime Minister Joseph Muscat outside a conference organised by Henley & Partners.\n\n“Tina Urso was the mastermind behind the protest where insults were hurled at Prime Minister,” Camilleri said. “This is the link to her Facebook page.”\n\nUrso is an activist with Il-Kenniesa, a protest group set up after the 2017 election and which is best known for its stunts demanding justice for the murdered journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.\n\nAfter her identity was revealed, Urso was met with a torrent of abuse on social media, with people flooding her Facebook page with derogatory comments and some even spreading her parents’ address and her ID card.\n\nVideo by The Shift News\n\nA meme falsely quoting her as saying she hated Malta, Labour and the Prime Minister’s family went viral, prompting Valletta 2018’s former artistic director Mario Philip Azzopardi to call Urso a bitch and later apologise for having fallen victim to “fake news”.\n\nUrso testified about her experience in court today, with Camilleri set to take to the stand at the next sitting in May.\n\nUrso is being represented by Cedric Mifsud while Camilleri is being represented by Franco Debono.\n\nLeft: Angele Camilleri, Right: Tina Urso during last year’s London protest"
