To learn more about each base’s specialities and available roles, search below.\n\nSee what it takes\n\nA day in the life of those who protect everyday life\n\nGuardians defend our country and freedom to operate in space—keeping it secure and accessible for military space power and new waves of innovation.

But your salary is just part of the package. From the moment you put on your uniform, you’re eligible for additional compensation based on your job and station.\n\n02\n\nInsurance\n\nThe Space Force offers Guardians and their families top-of-the-line, low-rate insurance plans, each with comprehensive medical and dental care at military or civilian facilities. Additionally, we provide full pay and allowances for sick days and life insurance.\n\n03\n\nRetirement\n\nThe Space Force offers a generous retirement plan which operates within the Blended Retirement System, providing benefits similar to those of many civilian 401(k) plans with employer-matched contributions. This plan combines two main sources of retirement savings: a monthly retirement income for Guardians who serve a minimum of 20 years and the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) which includes automatic and matching government contributions.\n\n04\n\nRecreation\n\nMost Space Force bases are equipped with golf courses, tennis courts, swimming pools and full-service gyms, along with arts-and-crafts facilities. All are either free for use or are available at lower rates than similar facilities off base.\n\n05\n\nVacation and Travel\n\nAll military Guardians get 30 days of paid vacation per year. They can travel on Air Force aircraft to almost any U.S. state and many international destinations. Additionally, for destinations near military facilities, Guardians qualify for reduced-rate hotel lodging.\n\n06\n\nEducation\n\nEnlisting in the Space Force offers a wide range of educational opportunities, which include scholarships for Guardians who wish to pursue ongoing education. Enlisted Guardians can receive up to 100% tuition assistance through the Air Force Tuition Assistance Program, the Montgomery GI Bill or Post-9/11 GI Bill. Members select which option to take based on what’s best for them.\n\nLearn More\n\nFeaturedCareers\n\nTargeting Analyst\n\nSupervises and develops intelligence to analyze targets, assess threats and achieve objectives\n\nLearn More\n\nCyberspace Effects Operations Officer\n\nEnsures the effectiveness of cyberspace operations, from planning missions to supervising satellite communications\n\nLearn More\n\nIntelligence Officer\n\nProtects our intelligence across a full range of military operations\n\nLearn More\n\nSpace Systems Operator\n\nPerforms vital tasks to assist in rocket launches and space-flight operations\n\nLearn More\n\nSpace Operations Officer\n\nPlans, organizes and directs space operations\n\nLearn More\n\nget space force updates in your email\n\nSign up and never miss out on what we’re up to.\n\nEmail address\n\nFirst name\n\nLast name\n\n® 2024"
