Consequently, Navy veterans had the highest incidence of asbestos exposure among all military branches.\n\nEven if not mentioned above, numerous other Navy bases could have exposed you to asbestos. The Mesothelioma Hope team can ascertain the source of your asbestos exposure and assist you in obtaining the appropriate medical attention. Contact our Patient Advocates today.\n\nAsbestos on U.S. Coast Guard Bases\n\nSeveral U.S. Coast Guard bases located throughout the country relied on asbestos-containing products before the 1980s.\n\nCoast Guard military bases with asbestos include:\n\nU.S. Coast Guard Base Alameda, California\n\nU.S. Coast Guard Base Gloucester, New Jersey\n\nU.S. Coast Guard Base Los Angeles Long Beach, California\n\nU.S. Coast Guard Station, Connecticut\n\nU.S. Coast Guard Station Curtis Bay, Maryland\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard also commonly used asbestos-based products to protect its ships from fires. All areas surrounding the engine, boiler room, and other high-heat areas on the lower deck of Coast Guard vessels were insulated with asbestos.\n\nHow Asbestos Exposure Occurred on Military Bases\n\nConstruction work done by Marines on military bases led to high exposure to asbestos. This happened when they cut, drilled, sawed, sanded, and fitted materials containing asbestos.\n\nWhen old asbestos materials crumbled, they released asbestos fibers into the air which could be unknowingly inhaled by the personnel. It is difficult to detect their presence in the air because asbestos fibers are microscopic.\n\nOnce inhaled, they remain in the body and can irritate healthy tissue. This leads to scar tissue formation and mutations in healthy cells after 10-50 years. This may result in the development of cancers such as mesothelioma.\n\nHelp After Asbestos Exposure on U.S. Military Bases\n\nAfter a mesothelioma diagnosis, military veterans may feel confused, scared, or angry. Thankfully, veterans who developed mesothelioma after exposure to asbestos on military bases can apply for government-issued and private benefits.\n\nEssential resources available to U.S. veterans include:\n\nPrivate mesothelioma claims (which award financial compensation from makers of asbestos-based products)\n\nVA benefits (including monthly financial payouts and free/low-cost health care)\n\nAsbestos trust fund claims (which can award additional compensation)"
