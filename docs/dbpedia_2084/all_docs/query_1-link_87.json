The measure was approved by the Committee with a vote of 34 to 25.\n\nImage\n\nDefense Subcommittee Chairman Ken Calvert (R-CA) said, “This bill provides the resources necessary for our military to deter conflict and prevail in war. The spending priorities included in this bill acknowledge that the threats against the United States are no longer a future challenge, but a current reality. The Fiscal Year 2025 Defense Appropriations Bill provides our warfighters with the resources they need to meet these challenges by prioritizing capabilities that counter China, increasing investments in rapidly-fielded innovative technologies, reforming the Pentagon’s business practices, and increasing the Department’s role in countering the China-supplied fentanyl crisis. Recognizing that our national security is only as resilient as our military members and families are, this bill fully funds a military pay raise and includes a historic pay increase for our junior enlisted servicemembers. I am proud of this bill and pleased to see it pass full committee today, and grateful to Chairman Cole for his leadership.”\n\nChairman Tom Cole (R-OK) said, “Freedom endures because of the selfless people willing to defend their nation at all cost. Our troops have committed to that sacred oath, and their cause continues to be summoned. Renewed threats and aggressors across the globe echo imperialism of the past and challenge U.S. safety and interests. It’s why providing our men and women in uniform with the tools needed to deter, fight, and win is imperative. This FY25 bill strengthens America’s defense and the readiness of our armed forces. Chairman Calvert focused resources on the Pentagon’s core mission of delivering a combat-ready military that can prevent war and protect our great nation. Voting to advance this bill is core to keeping our military the strongest fighting force in the world.”\n\nSubcommittee Chairman Calvert’s opening remarks are available here.\n\nChairman Cole's opening remarks are available here.\n\nFiscal Year 2025 Defense Appropriations Act\n\nThe Defense Appropriations Act provides a total discretionary allocation of $833.053 billion, which is $8.57 billion (1%) above the Fiscal Year 2024 level and consistent with the limit set in law by the Fiscal Responsibility Act.\n\nThe bill strategically refocuses the Pentagon on its core mission: delivering combat-ready military forces to deter war and ensure national security. It eliminates funding for divisive social agendas and initiatives that do not align with the Department’s primary purpose.\n\nDue to persistent oversight of program execution across the Department of Defense (DOD), the bill rejects $18 billion in unjustified and unnecessary items included in the President’s Budget Request and redirects those resources to programs and activities that counter the People’s Republic of China and other near-peer adversaries, foster innovation, enhance the DOD’s role in combating the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs, and support servicemembers and their families.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nPrioritizes the fight against China by:\n\nAllocating $200 million for Taiwan's international security cooperation programs and prioritizing defense articles and services
