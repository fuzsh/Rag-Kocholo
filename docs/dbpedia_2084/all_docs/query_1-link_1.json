        "text": "While the City of San Antonio has been known for years at “Military City USA,” it is now finally official as the city has trademarked the phrase and will start using it on logos and promotional material.\n\nSan Antonio has been called Military City USA dating back to World War II, but the phrase was never made official. This past March, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office officially granted the exclusive use of the phrase to the city of San Antonio.\n\nThe City of San Antonio unveiled the registered trademark of Military City, USA® and accompanying logo at 9:30 a.m. June 19 on the steps of City Hall, celebrating the City’s deep-rooted history with the military. San Antonio is home to Joint Base San Antonio the largest joint base in the U.S. Department of Defense includes the four primary locations of Randolph Air Force Base, Fort Sam Houston, Lackland Air Force Base and Camp Bullis.\n\nSan Antonio has a 300-year history with the military, including the first U.S. military aviation flight at Fort Sam Houston in 1910 by Lt. Benjamin Foulois.\n\nEvery enlisted medic in the DOD is trained at JBSA; every airman in the Air Force completes basic military training in San Antonio; Lackland Air Force Base hosts the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency; and Fort Sam Houston has the DOD’s largest hospital and only level one trauma center in the country.\n\n“For years many have referred to San Antonio as Military City, USA and now we are officially a registered trademark, a name that no other city can claim. Our relationship with the military is one of the many reasons our city continues to prosper and we are proud to celebrate this historic announcement,” said Mayor-Elect Ron Nirenberg. “Thank you to the entire military community, their families, and the service men and women who call San Antonio home.”"
