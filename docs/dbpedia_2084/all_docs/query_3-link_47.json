        "text": "The Important Bird Areas (IBA) Program is a global effort to identify and conserve areas that are vital to birds and other biodiversity. Some military lands, including DoD installations and Army Corps of Engineers projects, have been identified as IBAs. In general, an IBA should exist as an actual or potential protected area, or should have the potential to be managed in some way for birds and general nature conservation. Military installations, through their Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans and Sikes Act compliance, manage their lands in ways that benefit naturally occurring bird populations. Corps project sites also implement comprehensive management plans which enhance bird habitat. Refer to the table below for IBA information on DoD installations. Global IBAs are administered by American Bird Conservancy (ABC), and IBAs administered by the National Audubon Society may meet State, Continental, or Global criteria.\n\nIdentification as an Important Bird Area is recognition from an outside organization (American Bird Conservancy, National Audubon Society, or both) of excellent stewardship of military lands that benefits resident and migratory birds and their habitats. Identification as an IBA entails no legal or management requirements. Once a site has been identified and/or nominated as an IBA, official designation via a recognition ceremony may take place at the discretion of the installation. The DoD PIF program endorses Important Bird Areas on military lands, where appropriate. Please note that public access to military installations is handled on a site by site basis. IBA status does not imply public access to a site.\n\nAir Force\n\nHolloman Air Force Base (NM)\n\nNone\n\nKirtland Air Force Base (NM)\n\nNone\n\nWestover Air Reserve Base (MA)\n\nNone\n\nArmy\n\nFort Jackson (SC)\n\nNone\n\nFort McCoy (WI)\n\nNone\n\nHuachuca Mtns (AZ), includes Fort Huachuca\n\nNone\n\nMassachusetts Military Reservation (MA)\n\nNone\n\nYakima Training Center (WA)\n\nNone\n\nMarine Corps\n\nCamp Lejeune (NC)\n\nNone\n\nNavy\n\nBoardman Bombing Range (OR)\n\nNone\n\nCrescent Harbor Marshes (NAS Whidbey Island WA)\n\nNone\n\nIndian Island Naval Reservation (WA)\n\nNone\n\nKings Bay Naval Station (GA)\n\nNone\n\nNaval Weapon Station Concord (CA)\n\nNone\n\nSan Diego NWR Complex (CA), includes:\n\n– Outlying Landing Field Imperial Beach\n\n– Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station\n\nNone\n\nUS Army Corps of Engineers\n\nAllegany Reservoir (NY)\n\nNone\n\nAndrews Island Spoil Site (GA)\n\nNone\n\nBlue Marsh Lake (PA)\n\nNone\n\nCoos Bay (OR)\n\nNone\n\nFern Ridge Reservoir (OR)\n\nNone\n\nJordan Lake (NC)\n\nNone\n\nLake Red Rock (IA)\n\nNone\n\nLake Wappapello (MO)\n\nNone\n\nRiverlands Environmental Demonstration Area (MO)\n\nNone\n\nSavannah Spoil Site (SC)\n\nNone\n\nSaylorville Reservoir (IA)\n\nNone\n\nSchodack Island State Park Area (NY)\n\nNone\n\nSiltcoos Lake (OR)\n\nNone\n\nWalla Walla River Delta (WA)\n\nNone\n\nWickiup Reservoir (OR)\n\nNone"
