        "text": "As the son of a World War II veteran, I know firsthand the sacrifices that our brave servicemen and servicewomen make to keep us all safe. Freedom is not free—and it is the heroic actions of our men and women in uniform that have made America a beacon of democracy and prosperity around the world. For decades, America has been respected and feared on the world stage. Unfortunately, President Biden’s disastrous foreign policy, including the ill-advised, hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, set off a ripple effect emboldening our enemies and making our allies and partners less secure. Now, we see that countries like Iran, Russia, and China are on the move—and Joe Biden’s foreign policy is appeasement. Joe Biden has put America last—and the world is a more dangerous place as a result.\n\nI am proud to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I am committed to making sure the United States military is ready to face the challenges ahead. It is imperative that we prioritize robust funding to increase the depth and lethality of our armed forces. We must make sophisticated, long-term, and serious investments to give our armed forces the tools they need to protect the nation. We cannot allow ourselves to be outpaced in spending or development by those who wish to do us harm.\n\nAlabama has a long history of military excellence and hosts five bases across the state: Redstone Arsenal, Maxwell-Gunter, Fort Novosel, Anniston Army Depot, and Ft. McClellan Training Center Alabama National Guard. The men and women at these facilities are integral to our national security and Alabama is proud of their dedication to their fellow Americans.\n\nAlabama is also home to some of the brightest stars in the space industry. Huntsville, “The Rocket City”, plays a vital role in both commercial and national security space efforts—the city has been instrumental to America’s space programs since the Apollo era. I will continue to advocate for Redstone Arsenal, NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, and all of the guardian organizations that help ensure that the U.S. is at the forefront of this new frontier. I have also been leading the fight to bring U.S. Space Command to its rightful home in Huntsville."
