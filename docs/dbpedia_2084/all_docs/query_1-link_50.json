        "text": "The Women's Land Army (WLA) made a significant contribution to boosting Britain's food production during the Second World War.\n\nBefore the Second World War, Britain had imported much of its food. When war broke out, it was necessary to grow more food at home and increase the amount of land in cultivation. With many male agricultural workers joining the armed forces, women were needed to provide a new rural workforce.\n\nThe WLA had originally been set up in 1917 but disbanded at the end of the First World War. It reformed in June 1939. Women were initially asked to volunteer to serve in the Land Army and, from December 1941, could also be conscripted into land work. At its peak in 1944, there were more than 80,000 women – often known as 'land girls' – in the WLA.\n\nLand girls did a wide variety of jobs on the land. They worked in all weathers and conditions and could be directed to work anywhere in the country.\n\nHere are 10 surprising facts about the work of the WLA during the Second World War."
