        "text": "Xi Jingping has one goal: override the United States and make China the global superpower. In order to do that, he is attacking freedom and democracy worldwide.\n\nThe United States is Target #1. Already, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has exploited America’s free market system and become the second largest economy in the world. At the same time, Xi is pushing the envelope when it comes to the military.\n\nRecent reporting shows that a CCP-affiliated corporation purchased farmland in North Dakota that is just a stone’s throw from high-capability military bases. The purchase raises the possibility that the Chinese government could use the farmland as a launching pad for espionage under the guise of operating a business.\n\nThat is why I joined other Republicans and called on the Biden Administration to use every tool at its disposal to protect the integrity of our military. China has made its intentions very clear, and the United States cannot allow the CCP to succeed.\n\nI will continue to push the Administration to take action and stand strong against China.
