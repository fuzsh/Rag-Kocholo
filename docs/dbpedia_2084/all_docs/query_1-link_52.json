In order to access HMMS-POP, you will need to request the HMMS-POP and EBS roles via Account Management and Provisioning System (AMPS). AMPS will allow you to request both roles on the same request.\n\nRequest both the HMMS-POP and EBS Portal roles with the following steps:\n\nLog into AMPS (CAC or User I.D./Password required.\n\nFor CAC users, select your Email certificate).\n\nTo the left, click, “Click Here to Access AMPS\".\n\nClick “OK”.\n\nOn left side of screen Under “Request”.\n\nSelect “Request Roles”.\n\n“Accept” privacy statement.\n\nOn your profile screen:\n\nInput your Date of Birth.\n\nSelect “Next” on top right-hand side of screen.\n\nUnder “Browse Roles by Application”:\n\nSelect “DLA Enterprise Applications”.\n\nUnder “Search Roles” search by “Role Name”:\n\nFor HMMS-POP role input Web User POP-001:\n\nClick “Search” button.\n\nSelect the role and hit the arrow to place role in “Selected Roles” box.\n\nFor EBS Portal role:\n\nDLA personnel, input 835. (If you receive an error message that there is a conflict with another primary role, select 835B instead).\n\nNon-DLA personnel, input 845. (If you receive an error message that there is a conflict with another primary role, select 845B instead).\n\nClick “Search” button.\n\nSelect the role and hit the arrow to place role in “Selected Roles” box.\n\nNote: Do Not select any roles other that the “PROD” (Production) roles that are provided in this instruction. Any other role will be rejected/denied.\n\nHit “Next” button at top of screen.\n\nInput justification.\n\nA good justification to keep request from being rejected/denied could be, “Need access to HMMS-POP in order to process hazardous material shipments. Need access to the EBS Portal in order to access HMMS-POP, which is housed in the EBS Portal\".\n\nSelect “Submit” button.\n\nOnce your request has been approved for the HMMS-POP role (approval process may take a day or so), you will receive an email containing the temporary password assigned to your User ID. You will not be able to login to HMMS-POP to assign your permanent password until you have your EBS role.\n\nAccessing HMMS-POP through the EBS Portal\n\nTo Access HMMS-POP through the EBS Portal take the following steps:\n\nOpen your browser and navigate to the correct URL:\n\nProduction environment\n\n​non-DLA Users (CAC or User I.D./Password required): Prod 845/845B\n\nDLA Users (CAC or User I.D./Password required): Prod 835/835B\n\nOn the certificate pop-up use the “Email” credential.\n\nOn the consent banner click ‘I Accept’.\n\nWhen you are logged in, you will see the welcome page. Click the HMMS-POP tab. The application should open in a new tab and log you in.\n\nIf this is your first time in HMMS-POP you will need to input the temporary password and your User ID. HMMS-POP will then direct you to assign a permanent password. Once you have completed this process will not have to input your User ID and password from that point on. The EBS Portal will take you directly to the Homepage of HMMS-POP when you click the HMMS-POP tab.\n\n***If at any time you experience difficulties accessing the POP application, please contact:\n\nDISA Global Service Desk​ (system access or technical issues)​\n\nToll Free: 844-DISA-HLP (844-347-2457)​\n\nDSN: 850-0032​\n\nPress 5, then speak or enter D-L-A\n\nEmail: disa.global.servicedesk.mbx.dla-ticket-request@mail.mil (Non-urgent general IT issues)\n\nAny questions/concerns, please feel free to contact us at DistPOPSupport@dla.mil.\n\nDLA Packaging Approved Commercial Packaging\n\nApproved commercial packaging permits use of non-specification materials. ASTM D3951, Standard Practice for Commercial Packaging, provides standard commercial guidelines and will be utilized when specified by the contract/purchase order.\n\nMilitary vs Commercial Packaging\n\nDetails on Military and Commercials packaging.\n\nASTM D3951 Overview\n\nDescribes requirements for reservation, packaging, packing, and marking furnished by the suppliers.\n\nHow to Identify Adequate Commercial Packaging\n\nDescribes how to identify adequate commercial packaging.\n\nHow to Identify Inadequate Commercial Packaging\n\nDescribes how to identify inadequate commercial packaging by showing examples.\n\nDefense Logistics Agency (DLA) Packaging\n\nApproved Commercial Packaging\n\nApproved commercial packaging permits use of non-specification materials. ASTM D3951, Standard Practice for Commercial Packaging, provides standard commercial guidelines and will be utilized when specified by the contract/purchase order.\n\nASTM D3951 is the “Standard Practice for Commercial Packaging.\" It covers the requirements for the commercial preservation, packaging, packing (exterior container), and marking for supplies and equipment. It provides for multiple handling and shipments by any mode of transport, and storage periods of a minimum of one year in enclosed facilities without damage to the product.\n\nAccess to commercial standards requires purchase of the standards from the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) (Non-DLA Web Site).\n\nMilitary versus Commercial Packaging:\n\nMilitary packaging requires the use of specification materials, interpretation of preservation/packing instructions, MIL–STD–129, Military Marking, and the preservation methods of MIL–STD–2073–1, Standard Practice for Military Packaging. Military packaging should be used for items expected to enter the military distribution system. The military distribution system is the process by which material, not intended for immediate use, is stored and/or moved within or between Defense Department facilities. It may also cover items intended for delivery-at-sea, items delivered during wartime, or items requiring reusable containers.\n\nCommercial packaging permits use of non-specification materials. ASTM D3951, Standard Practice for Commercial Packaging, provides standard commercial guidelines. Application of preservation/packing techniques is at the discretion of the contractor or the activity. Items not going into stock, items intended for immediate use (e.g., Aircraft on the Ground (AOG)), items for Not Mission-Capable Supply (NMCS), items intended for depot operational consumption, small parcel shipments (Continental United States (CONUS), not-for-stock), and customer direct deliveries (CONUS) shall be packaged in accordance with standard commercial practice as defined in ASTM D3951.\n\nASTM D3951 Overview:\n\nPreservation, packaging, packing, and marking furnished by the suppliers shall meet or exceed the following minimum requirements:\n\nCleanliness—Items shall be free of dirt and other contaminants which would contribute to deterioration of the item or which would require cleaning by the customer prior to use. Coatings and preservatives applied to the item for protection are not considered contaminants.\n\nPreservation—Items susceptible to corrosion or deterioration shall be provided protection such as preservative coatings, barrier protection, volatile corrosion inhibitors, or desiccated unit packs.\n\nCushioning—Items requiring protection from physical and mechanical damage or which are fragile shall be protected by wrapping, cushioning, pack compartmentization, cartonizing, or other means to mitigate shock and vibration to prevent damage during handling and shipment.\n\nLoose-fill Cushioning/Dunnage—Loose-fill material shall be prohibited for all DoD and/or General Services Administration (GSA) shipments and shipments to aerospace facilities.\n\nA unit package must contain the contents with no damage to them, and with minimal damage to the unit pack during shipment and storage in the shipping container, and will allow subsequent handling.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the contract or purchase order, the unit package quantity (QUP) shall be one each part, set, or assembly.\n\nUnit packages and intermediate containers not meeting the requirements for a shipping container will be packed in shipping containers. The shipping container (including any necessary blocking, bracing, cushioning, or water resistance) will provide safe delivery to the destination. The shipping container will be capable of multiple handling and storage periods at a minimum of one year in enclosed facilities without damage to the product.\n\nHow to identify adequate commercial packaging:\n\nMaterial must be free of dirt and other contaminants.\n\nMaterial must be protected from corrosion.\n\nMaterial must be protected from physical damage and mechanical malfunction.\n\nThe unit package must withstand normal shipment and storage without damage to the material and without major damage to the package for ONE year.\n\nLoose fill is not acceptable cushioning.\n\nMIL-STD-129 identification markings must be present and correct.\n\nExamples of inadequate commercial packaging:\n\nThis item shown is in inadequate commercial packaging. It is not protected from physical damage or mechanical malfunction and contains no markings.\n\nHad the binoculars been cushioned and placed in a box then marked in accordance with MIL–STD–129, it would have been adequately packaged and marked in accordance with ASTM D3951.\n\nDLA/DOD personnel will submit a DD Form 1359 request to the identified UI Coordinator. Vendor requests should be submitted using the Post Award Request (PAR) request link on DLA Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS). Once submitted, the request will be routed to the UI coordinator for the specified supply chain. It is important to note that a UI change request takes some time for review and, if approved, will not become effective for 90 days after final approval. UI change requests require approval from the packaging specialist and product specialist, finance, and the UI coordinator. The UI coordinator may reach out to the administrators of existing long term contracts to determine if those LTCs would be adversely affected."
