For each base, the zip code, nearest metro city, miles to the nearest metro city, and total number of sponsors, dependents, and personnel are presented. The data in this table are based on the “duty locations” of the Sponsor only. There are instances where sponsors and dependents are co‐located, but dependents may not be located at these installations.[i]\n\n* Bases with fewer than 100 Active-Duty Sponsors are included in the Other category for their State.\n\n** Nearest Metro City listed has population greater than 50,000.\n\n*** “NMC” stands for Nearest Metro City.\n\n**** United States Other includes personnel within the United States, but with unknown base and state. Note: The Sponsor column includes all Active-Duty military personnel at each base. “C” refers to bases that have been closed. The number following “C” refers to the base realignment and closure (BRAC) round in which the base was closed.\n\n[i] Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Military Community and Family Policy (ODASD (MC&FP)), “2017 Demographics Profile of the Military Community,” U.S. Department of Defense, November 2018, p 176, accessed April 25, 2019, http://download.militaryonesource.mil/12038/MOS/Reports/2017-demographics-report.pdf."
