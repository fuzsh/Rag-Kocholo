        "text": "Welcome to the Department of Defense Sustainable Products Center\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) Sustainable Products Center (SPC) serves as an informational repository for results, success stories, technical data, and lessons learned from sustainable technology and product demonstrations conducted at DoD installations. The SPC is managed by the DoD Sustainable Technology Evaluation and Demonstration (STED) Program.\n\nThe Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment (OASD(EI&E)), as directed by Congress, established the DoD STED Program to evaluate, demonstrate, and transition sustainable commercial off-the-shelf technologies and products with a focus on performance, operational readiness, resilience, security, and cost effectiveness. The DoD STED Program identifies, evaluates and demonstrates sustainable technologies and products with experienced military, civilian and contractor end users at DoD installations. The objectives of the DoD STED Program are to:\n\nIdentify emerging sustainable technologies that meet DoD needs\n\nEvaluate technical data of sustainable alternatives against Military Specifications and other Government requirements;\n\nConduct demonstrations at DoD installations and other Federal agency facilities to prove these sustainable technologies work in operational environments, compare them to traditional products, and transition successful technologies Government-wide.\n\nThe STED Program Team conducts outreach by holding sustainability expos at DoD and Federal agency facilities to showcase sustainable technologies to installation personnel, facilitate government attendee interaction with sustainable technology manufacturers, and identify additional sustainable technology need areas for future demonstrations.\n\nThe SPC also serves as a forum for DoD and other Federal agency personnel to submit questions regarding sustainable products and technologies and to share success stories. In addition, DoD and other Federal agency personnel can submit sustainable technology needs for potential inclusion in future demonstrations. The intent of the SPC is to improve compliance with related federal statutes and Executive Orders, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and DoD policies while increasing sustainable offerings and enhancing mission readiness.\n\nRequest Information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments regarding sustainable products, the DoD STED Program, or the SPC, please contact us.\n\nPlease provide us with your name, title, installation, and the urgency of your question and the SPC will respond to you as quickly as possible.\n\nLatest News\n\n2024 Pentagon Earth Day photos available, to include the DoD STED Program booth.\n\nMarch 8 is National Biobased Products Day. Visit USDA BioPreferred website for federal biobased purchasing requirements.\n\nDoD releases MILSPEC MIL-PRF-63460 Revision G, requiring all qualified cleaner, lubricant, and preservative (CLP) products for weapons and weapons systems to contain at least 33 percent biobased content.\n\nFirst product qualified under DoD Fluorine Free Foam (F3) MILSPEC.\n\n2023 Pentagon Earth Day photos available, to include the DoD STED Program booth. Click HERE to view (DENIX account required).\n\nDoD, GSA Sign MOU to Bring More Environmental Innovators to Federal Marketplace. See the DoD announcement for more information.\n\nUSDA recognizes FBI efforts related to DoD STED Program demonstration of biobased tires. See the USDA announcement for more information."
