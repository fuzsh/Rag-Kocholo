At that time each Wednesday the units had the afternoon off for recreation in this case a barbeque & beer afternoon. I happened to be on my rotation to the VNAF Sqd 211 on the Danang base in my Advisor status I returned to the Danang base in the evening & joked to my friends; this would be a time the VC having watched the days action to attack There was CH37 & UH34 helicopters there also besides the HU1Es that were damaged & lost. I heard all the explosions that night over on the Danang Base . During my 4 years (1964/1968) I saw many such actions, some were on Army & AF units over all 4 sectioins of Vietnam during VNAF Operations. (Danang, Nhatrang, Saigon & Binh Thuy) PM\n\n_________________\n\nExtracted from above URL\n\nMarble Mountains near Da NangOn July 28, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced that the U.S. would increase the number of its forces in South Vietnam from 75,000 to 125,000. Shortly thereafter the Joint Chiefs of Staff dispatched Marine Aircraft Group 16 (MAG 16) to Vietnam on top of the three Marine helicopter squadrons already there. This rapid build-up of helicopters and other aircraft from the United States Air Force at Da Nang saturated the base and had the leaders of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing (I MAW) quickly looking for an alternate site for their helicopter squadrons. The Marines ultimately chose a stretch of sandy beach on the South China Sea that was about five miles southeast of Da Nang and just north of a series of red marble mountains for their first helicopter facility. American military construction units were overtasked at the time so the initial construction of the field was done by Raymond, Morrison-Knudson/Brown, Root & Jones (RMK-BRJ). By the end of August 1965, they had completed a 2000 ft runway and on August 26, MAG 16 officially moved in. A week later Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) would approve the name Marble Mountain Air Facility.[1]\n\nOn the evening of 27–28 October approximately 90 Viet Cong attacked MMAF. They attacked under the cover of 60mm mortar fire using four demolition teams armed with bangalore torpedoes and hand grenades. They were able to reach the MAG 16 ramp destroying 19 aircraft and damaging another 35. VMO-2 took the brunt of the attack with thirteen of its UH-1E Hueys destroyed leaving the squadron with only four serviceable aircraft. The attack left two Marines and one Navy Corpsman killed in action with another 91 wounded in action. Forty-one enemy were killed during the battle along with four wounded that were taken prisoner\n\nAttached files\n\nRe: Attack on Marble Mountain Base\n\nIt was that for sure Especially for the Marble Mountan MAG-16 units !!! Some additional info >>>>iThe base had several local Vietnamese working on the base. In fact one of the VC that attacked that night was the barber at the base. I know first hand how that works. At the VNAF Sqd there at Danang 3 of the enlisted maintenance personnel were discovered to be VC on active duty. They were noted to be traveling each weekend & by following them discovered their activities. . Prior to the Tet Operations I had noticed a large increase of funeral processions. A large hand carried vehicle with a picture of the supposed deceased was carried by tough looking mourners to the local cemetary near Tan San Nhut air base. Also many logging trucks with huge timbers were suddenly in Saigon. There was no saw mills in Saigon. Our units had very little activity that the VC didnt know about . As in my Recollections my last mission at Binh Thuy (June 1968) ended up in the same type scene . Photo of hangars after VC attack Binh Thuy June 1968. All helicopters & AD A/C were destroyed)\n\nAttached files\n\nRe: Attack on Marble Mountain Base\n\nDANG! Paul!\n\nI didn't know that you and Skid were Buds!\n\nSkid was the Senior enlisted Marine in HMH-463 during '67-'68 at MMAF.\n\nI recall at squadron parties at Marble, there would be an iced down wash\n\ntub of Schlitz with a sign in it, stating: \"Skid's Beer\".\n\nOne day all of us enlisted weenies surrounded that tub and drained it.\n\nWe were tired of the Carling Black Label that was left to the remainder of\n\nthe enlisted folks.\n\nI think that I heard that he died of a heart attack while walking on an\n\nArizona highway, some years after we returned from Vietnam.\n\nAttached files\n\nRe: Attack on Marble Mountain Base\n\nI was assigned to HMM-163 in 1964-65. We returned to Okinawa after our float phase on the Iwo Jima in September 1965. In October part of our squadron was reassigned to HMM-361 at Marble Mountain.\n\nThe night of the attack I had just secured my aircraft and was walking to my tent. In front of the lead Huey was a corpsman. He was a chief corpsman on medevac duty. Don't recall his first name but his last name was Hunter. We spoke at length and had a great conversation. He told me his youngr brother was Tab Hunter, the movie star. I found that hard to believe but what he told me about Tab led me to believe he was telling me the truth. I told him I had an early wake up for the morning's launch and it was time to say goodbye. I asked him where he was going to sleep and he pointed to the lead Huey. I told him that was not a good idea because if we got overrun that bird would be the first one to be destroyed.\n\nThe night of the attack on the base whether it be 18 October or 27 October I don't recall. I do recall the first blast I heard came from the above ground fuel bladders. It was midnight, or close to midnight. The blast was so loud I believe the entire tent city was awakened. My eyes opened to see a huge ball of flame. We all dove into our trenches and stayed there until our reactionary company was called out to form up on the flight line. I believe satchal charges were laid in each Huey and completely blown up. Many of the H34s were also destroyed. When the little gooners ran out of satchal charges they continued their mission with hand grenades. The H37s, well the clam shells were blown off. My newly made friend, Navy Chief Corpsman Hunter was killed that night. If only he had listened to me. The rest is history.\n\nFast forward to the Popasmoke reunion in San Diego, in 2000. For those of you who attended the memorial service at Miramar you would have seen Tab Hunter. He was a guest at most of our reuynions. He often brought his mother with him. After the service my wife and I approached Tab and I told him how and when I met his brother and I might have been the last person to speak with his borther. Tab told me he was very appreciative of my story and wished his mother would have been with him to hear it also. I continued flying until the day I was transferred back to Okinawa for my return to CONUS.\n\nThat's my story and I'm sticking to it.\n\nGySgt Bob Torres\n\nUSMC, Retired\n\nColonel Victor Bianchini, USMC, Ret. Life Member\n\nOn October 27, 1965, I was the newly appointed 1st Marine Aircraft Wing Photo Officer, ISO and Wing Civil Affairs Officer. It was quite late that night, and I don’t remember whether I was already awake or awakened by explosions coming from the direction of Marble Mountain. I was in my bunk in the officers’ quarters of the DaNang French compound and the Headquarters of the 1st MAW. Whatever was going on at Marble Mountain, from the sounds, it was obvious it was very serious.\n\nDoubling as a photographer with my shop, and wanting to be where the action was, I quickly calculated that 1) I could never get there by ground transportation, because of the river and the bridge, and 2) I knew the Commanding General, Brigadier General Keith B. McCutcheon, (later a 4-star, and tragically fatally stricken with cancer just after being named Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps), had a command Huey on a helicopter pad within running distance from where I was. I jumped up, dressed faster than I had ever done before, and ran at a sprint for the pad. Sure enough, the Huey’s blades were turning, and the crew chief was standing by. I asked the crew chief if the general had arrived yet, and he said he would be there any second. As if on cue, General McCutcheon appeared, and I asked him if I could go with him. It was totally unnecessary to ask where he was headed. He said, “jump on.” I was on my way to the battle.\n\nAs soon as we landed at Marble Mountain, the General jumped off and went on his way for assessments and briefings, and I jumped of and immediately took cover behind a sandbag, as there were still explosions and gunfire, and propped my camera on the sandbag and took a timed exposure photograph. I didn’t think much of it at the time and turned my film into the shop’s lab. As was the practice, the daily prints would go out to the media, including the Stars & Stripes. The very next day after turning the photo in, the centerfold of the newspaper’s front section, in journalistic terms, the “double truck”, featured a giant size version of my photograph, which was on a slight tilt. I was unmercifully shamed by my crew as having used the “tilted sandbag” technique. But there was a twinge of jealousy.\n\nLater, when dawn broke and the damage was being assessed, with at least 40 H-34’s damaged or destroyed by satchel charges thrown in by the sappers, approximately 17 of whom were dead in various states of damage, several with partial skulls, who were adjudged to be North Vietnam regulars, and were killed by our troops, had been arrayed in a line on the sand. One of the General’s staff asked me to take intelligence photographs of the line of bodies and headshots of the dead sappers, in order to give them to the intelligence personnel. I was the only photographer on site, and it was a useful coincidence that I was there and had enough film to perform the assignment.\n\nColonel Victor E. Bianchini, USMC, Ret., Life Member"
