        "text": "1/3 In Vietnam\n\nIn the early days of the war, the Third Marines were called into action to protect the American air base at Danang. The Third Marines were part of the first fighting forces to be inserted to Vietnam in 1965. Their first areas of operation were centered around Danang then moved south to help protect the new base at Chu Lai. During this period, the Marines were under orders to serve only as a defensive force, allowing the South Vietnamese (ARVN) to conduct offensive operations. As the war escalated and more American troops were deployed in country, the Third Marines were sent north to the city of Quang Tri where they could be of service blocking the NVA from infiltrating into the South. Eventually, 3rd Marine Division moved its headquarters to the town of Dong Ha, just ten miles south of the DMZ. Dong Ha was strategic because of its location at the junction of Hwy 1 which ran north and south up the coast, and Hwy 9 which ran east and west to the Laotian border. The landscape in this area was everything from rugged, mountains to rolling sand dunes; from rice paddies to triple canopy jungle. The Third Marines were no longer limited to strictly defensive operations and were actively engaged in search and destroy missions, hunting out and stopping the NVA who attempted to cross into the South. In September of 1969, the 3rd Marines received orders to stand down and were out of Vietnam by mid October.\n\nLinks of Interest: Books about 1/3 in Vietnam Living in Vietnam Today A history of the Vietnam War as I understand it.\n\n1ST BN./ 3RD MARINES OPERATIONS and INFORMATION\n\nRepublic of VIETNAM 1965 thru 1969\n\nCompiled by Don Bumgarner and Ron Asher (C Company)\n\nJump to 19651966196719681969\n\n1965 07Mar65 to 12Mar65\n\nDEPLOYMENT to VIETNAM Province: Quang Nam Units: 1st BN./ 3RD MARINES was ordered DEPLOYED by 9TH M.E.B. from OKINAWA to DA NANG, RVN.
