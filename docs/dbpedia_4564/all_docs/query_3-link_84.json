        "text": "G Fiume/Getty Images\n\nThe MLB trade market is closed for now, but it won't be that long before it has its grand reopening for the 2024-25 offseason.\n\nAs such, it's not too early to wonder which players teams might make available.\n\nI've nominated one winter trade candidate for every team in MLB. This was a matter of informed speculation for the most part, as many of these guys have appeared in trade rumors before. In other cases, it's pure speculation.\n\nI've already covered eight stars whose names could end up in the offseason rumor mill, and they'll be reappearing in this space. As for the other 22 guys, most just aren't perfects fits on their current teams for various reasons.\n\nLet's go in alphabetical order by city and check off three teams at a time.\n\nRob Tringali/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n\nArizona Diamondbacks: OF Jake McCarthy\n\nAge: 27\n\n2024 Stats: 96 G, 298 PA, 3 HR, 16 SB, .293 AVG, .371 OBP, .409 SLG\n\nContract Status: $766,000 salary, under club control through 2028\n\nIt's not as apparent as it was when Daulton Varsho was still with Arizona, but McCarthy remains part of a surplus of left-handed-hitting outfielders alongside Corbin Carroll and Alek Thomas.\n\nAt least one team was reportedly eyeing McCarthy ahead of the deadline, and it would make sense if he hit the block again this winter. Whereas he's more of a nice-to-have for the Diamondbacks, other teams could value his club control, versatile glove and pesky bat.\n\nAtlanta: SS Orlando Arcia\n\nAge: 30\n\n2024 Stats: 108 G, 408 PA, 11 HR, 0 SB, .227 AVG, .273 OBP, .365 SLG\n\nContract Status: Year 2 of 3-year, $7.3 million deal, with 2026 club option\n\nThis is a long shot. Arcia has been a solid role-player on otherwise star-studded teams in Atlanta, and there hasn't been any public indication that the club wants to move on from him.\n\nYet the slide in his productivity since the 2023 All-Star break makes it conceivable that Atlanta will look to upgrade at shortstop, perhaps by signing Willy Adames or Ha-Seong Kim or trading for Bo Bichette. If so, they'd surely try to find a taker for Arcia.\n\nBaltimore Orioles: 1B Ryan Mountcastle\n\nAge: 27\n\n2024 Stats: 105 G, 433 PA, 13 HR, 3 SB, .268 AVG, .307 OBP, .437 SLG\n\nContract Status: $4.1 million salary, arbitration-eligible through 2026\n\nThe Orioles had a \"willingness\" to talk about Mountcastle ahead of the deadline, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan. A bit out of nowhere, but also a sensible concept that should be revisited.\n\nHe is a solid hitter, but his right-handed power stroke is, frankly, at a disadvantage at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. He could have more value to Baltimore as a trade chip, especially if he brings back pitching.\n\nStephen Maturen/Getty Images\n\nBoston Red Sox: DH Masataka Yoshida\n\nAge: 31\n\n2024 Stats: 65 G, 262 PA, 6 HR, 0 SB, .283 AVG, .355 OBP, .408 SLG\n\nContract Status: Year 2 of 5-year, $90 million deal\n\nIt was tempting to ponder a trade of Trevor Story, but the notion of another team taking on the back half of his six-year, $140 million contract is too preposterous to present as a serious idea.\n\nWith Yoshida, at least we know Boston was willing to trade him last winter. And while his own contract isn't cheap, he's owed $55.8 million after 2024 compared to $80 million for Story.\n\nChicago Cubs: RHP Jameson Taillon\n\nAge: 32\n\n2024 Stats: 19 GS, 110.2 IP, 106 H (15 HR), 86 K, 22 BB, 3.25 ERA\n\nContract Status: Year 2 of 4-year, $68 million deal\n\nThough the Cubs apparently never approached Taillon, who has a 10-team no-trade clause, about any possible deals, he was one of the more notable hurlers whose name was making the rounds ahead of the deadline.\n\nThere would be some sense in putting him back out there this winter. Even with Kyle Hendricks' contract due to expire, they'll have Justin Steele, Shōta Imanaga, Javier Assad, Jordan Wicks, Ben Brown and top prospect Cade Horton among their rotation options for 2025.\n\nChicago White Sox: LHP Garrett Crochet\n\nAge: 25\n\n2024 Stats: 23 GS, 118.1 IP, 90 H (12 HR), 162 K, 30 BB, 3.19 ERA\n\nContract Status: $800,000 salary, arbitration-eligible through 2026\n\nTo be clear, center fielder Luis Robert Jr. is also a candidate to be moved this winter. But whereas he'll be coming off a down year that hasn't helped his value, the chance to sell high on Crochet won't be Chicago's only excuse to move him.\n\nThe whole thing with his contract demands was pretty weird, and it clearly didn't make Chicago GM Chris Getz happy. With these two sides seemingly headed for an inevitable divorce, it would be for the best if they got it over with this winter.\n\nJason Mowry/Getty Images\n\nCincinnati Reds: 2B Jonathan India\n\nAge: 27\n\n2024 Stats: 106 G, 442 PA, 9 HR, 10 SB, .258 AVG, .363 OBP, .398 SLG\n\nContract Status: Year 1 of 2-year, $8.8 million deal, arbitration-eligible through 2026\n\nIndia's name was a regular on the rumor mill last winter. And even less than a week before the deadline, ESPN's Jorge Castillo reported that the New York Yankees were interested in him.\n\nThe Reds held India in both cases, but let's not be so sure they'll recommit this winter. Once Matt McLain is recovered from shoulder surgery, they'll have a surplus of infielders that could at least make them amenable to hearing offers on the 2021 NL Rookie of the Year.\n\nCleveland Guardians: RF Lane Thomas\n\nAge: 28\n\n2024 Stats: 85 G, 378 PA, 8 HR, 28 SB, .243 AVG, .323 OBP, .387 SLG\n\nContract Status: $5.5 million salary, arbitration-eligible through 2025\n\nThe Guardians only just traded for Thomas, so this concept is a reach by default. But here's the thinking: Cleveland is a low-payroll team, and he should get a fair deal more than $5.5 million in his final year of arbitration-eligibility.\n\nTrading him would thus be a way to manage costs, and the benefit could be twofold if the Guardians turned him into the pitcher they've so sorely lacked in 2024.\n\nColorado Rockies: 3B Ryan McMahon\n\nAge: 29\n\n2024 Stats: 111 G, 470 PA, 16 HR, 3 SB, .250 AVG, .340 OBP, .422 SLG\n\nContract Status: Year 3 of 6-year, $70 million deal\n\nThat report from Castillo also noted that the Yankees reached out to the Rockies about McMahon, only to be told he wasn't going anywhere.\n\nThe Rockies should nonetheless be prepared for calls to keep coming this winter, and they'd be foolish not to listen. McMahon is a fine player, but he's also about to turn 30 in December and thus not truly a building block for a franchise that badly needs to be thinking long-term.\n\nBrian Fluharty/Getty Images\n\nDetroit Tigers: RHP Kenta Maeda\n\nAge: 36\n\n2024 Stats: 20 G, 16 GS, 80.0 IP, 96 H (18 HR), 64 K, 24 BB, 6.75 ERA\n\nContract Status: Year 1 of 2-year, $24 million deal\n\nIt was tempting to wonder if the Tigers could make 2020 No. 1 pick Spencer Torkelson available this winter. But his value is basically kaput right now, and president of baseball operations Scott Harris still sees the slugger as \"part of our future.\"\n\nA salary-dump deal involving Maeda is less exciting but more realistic. He's been such a disaster for Detroit that it wouldn't be surprising if the club released him, though the first attempt should be to eat his salary in an attempt to buy a prospect in a trade.\n\nHouston Astros: INF/OF Mauricio Dubón\n\nAge: 30\n\n2024 Stats: 93 G, 289 PA, 4 HR, 2 SB, .263 AVG, .286 OBP, .380 SLG\n\nContract Status: $3.5 million salary, arbitration-eligible through 2026\n\nThere was some trade interest in Framber Valdez last winter, and both he and Kyle Tucker will be free agents after 2025. Stuff like that will make one go \"hmm,\" but it's hard to imagine Houston wilfully shopping either this winter.\n\nDubón isn't necessarily ripe for shopping, either, but he's on the pricey side for a light-hitting utility type. The Astros could save money by trading him and not really be worse for wear.\n\nKansas City Royals: LF MJ Melendez\n\nAge: 25\n\n2024 Stats: 93 G, 318 PA, 13 HR, 2 SB, .195 AVG, .261 OBP, .397 SLG\n\nContract Status: $755,000 salary, arbitration-eligible through 2028\n\nThe Royals were reportedly willing to discuss Melendez last winter, and that was when he still had some of the shine that accompanied him when he arrived as a top prospect in 2022.\n\nThat shine is barely visible now, but his pedigree, youth and club control might still appeal to teams. If the Royals get a chance to turn him into pitching depth, they'll have to at least consider it.\n\nOrlando Ramirez/Getty Images\n\nLos Angeles Angels: LF Taylor Ward\n\nAge: 30\n\n2024 Stats: 109 G, 459 PA, 16 HR, 3 SB, .228 AVG, .309 OBP, .395 SLG\n\nContract Status: $4.8 million salary, arbitration-eligible through 2025\n\nBoth Ward and infielder Luis Rengifo were involved in plenty of rumors before the deadline, yet neither went anywhere. Come the winter, the Angels could remedy that by dealing either or both of them.\n\nBetween the two, Ward seems the more likely candidate to go. He's a bit more of a known quantity and is shorter on club control than Rengifo, who's controlled through 2025.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers: 2B Gavin Lux\n\nAge: 26\n\n2024 Stats: 96 G, 339 PA, 6 HR, 4 SB, .245 AVG, .307 OBP, .361 SLG\n\nContract Status: $1.2 million salary, arbitration-eligible through 2026\n\nHe never seemed to actually be on the trade block, but Lux was a popular source for speculation last winter. Which was understandable, as he looked like a change-of-scenery candidate even then.\n\nNow? Even more so. He's been healthy this year after missing all of 2023 with a torn ACL, yet he's still nothing close to the star the Dodgers hoped he would become. Trading him to clear the way for a middle infield upgrade would make sense.\n\nMiami Marlins: LHP Jesús Luzardo\n\nAge: 26\n\n2024 Stats: 12 GS, 66.2 IP, 61 H (9 HR), 58 K, 22 BB, 5.00 ERA\n\nContract Status: $5.5 million salary, arbitration-eligible through 2026\n\nThe Marlins seemingly traded everyone but Luzardo before the deadline, and they surely would have if they could have. It's hard to trade a guy when he's out with a back injury.\n\nIt now seems possible the lefty won't be able to return before 2024 is over, in which case Miami could hold him into 2025 to see if he can bounce back. Unless, of course, it would sooner save some money than maximize his trade value.\n\nJohn Fisher/Getty Images\n\nMilwaukee Brewers: RHP Devin Williams\n\nAge: 29\n\n2024 Stats: 3 G, 3 GF, 3.0 IP, 3 H (1 HR), 5 K, 1 BB, 3.00 ERA\n\nContract Status: $7.25 million salary, $10.5 million club option for 2025\n\nLast winter, it was the Brewers trading Corbin Burnes as they stared down his last year under their control. Could they do the same with Williams this winter?\n\nIt may not be a given, as that option is a more-than-reasonable rate for an elite closer. But if Milwaukee's plan is to play the long game, it's not like it'll be able to re-sign Williams if he hits the open market in search of Josh Hader and Edwin Díaz dollars.\n\nMinnesota Twins: 2B Edouard Julien\n\nAge: 25\n\n2024 Stats: 63 G, 209 PA, 7 HR, 6 SB, .204 AVG, .311 OBP, .354 SLG\n\nContract Status: $747,000 salary, under club control through 2029\n\nIt was only last year that Julien placed in the AL Rookie of the Year voting after posting an .839 OPS. Yet he's since fallen out of favor in Minnesota, getting optioned to the minors multiple times amid his struggles in the majors.\n\nThis need not be a prelude to a trade, but the Twins will need pitching more than infielders this winter. It would be in their interest to put him on a line and hope he attracts an arm.\n\nNew York Mets: 3B Brett Baty\n\nAge: 24\n\n2024 Stats: 50 G, 171 PA, 4 HR, 0 SB, .229 AVG, .306 OBP, .327 SLG\n\nContract Status: $750,000 salary, under club control through 2028\n\nSpeaking of prospects who have fallen out of favor, Baty hasn't played for the Mets since June 9 and has thus been powerless to stop Mark Vientos' rise as the club's de facto third baseman.\n\nAccording to Mike Puma of the New York Post, other teams contacted the Mets about Baty ahead of the deadline. And why not? He was a good buy-low target then, and he'll be a good buy-low target again this winter.\n\nRob Tringali/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n\nNew York Yankees: LHP Nestor Cortes\n\nAge: 29\n\n2024 Stats: 23 GS, 129.2 IP, 127 H (20 HR), 122 K, 28 BB, 4.16 ERA\n\nContract Status: $4.0 million salary, arbitration-eligible through 2025\n\nAs reported by Bob Nightengale of USA Today, the Yankees were planning on trading Cortes upon acquiring Jack Flaherty at the deadline. Which, according to Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic, nearly happened before Flaherty's medicals scared the Yankees away.\n\nCortes is still in pinstripes as a result, but he shouldn't get too comfortable. With Gerrit Cole, Carlos Rodón, Marcus Stroman, Luis Gil and Clarke Schmidt all slated to return in 2025, the Yankees will have an excuse to view Cortes as the odd man out this winter.\n\nOakland Athletics: DH Brent Rooker\n\nAge: 29\n\n2024 Stats: 101 G, 418 PA, 28 HR, 7 SB, .291 AVG, .368 OBP, .584 SLG\n\nContract Status: $750,000 salary, arbitration-eligible through 2027\n\nRooker seemed like an obvious candidate to get moved before the deadline, but then Jon Heyman of the New York Post reported the A's were \"reluctant\" to trade him. And they were apparently serious, as he indeed ended up staying put.\n\nStill, teams are bound to keep calling about the 2022 All-Star. And knowing where the A's are headed in 2025, they only have so much incentive to keep Rooker as a star attraction on an otherwise lousy team.\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies: RF Nick Castellanos\n\nAge: 32\n\n2024 Stats: 114 G, 473 PA, 15 HR, 4 SB, .245 AVG, .298 OBP, .414 SLG\n\nContract Status: Year 3 of 5-year, $100 million deal\n\nRemember when Castellanos appeared on the rumor mill last winter? It was early on, and the moment proved to be fleeting.\n\nYet it wouldn't be surprising if history repeated itself this winter. And as opposed to three years and $60 million, he will only have two years and $40 million left on his deal. It's that much less for a team to absorb...or the Phillies to eat.\n\nOrlando Ramirez/Getty Images\n\nPittsburgh Pirates: 2B Nick Gonzales\n\nAge: 25\n\n2024 Stats: 65 G, 267 PA, .258 AVG, .293 OBP, .387 SLG\n\nContract Status: $740,000 salary, under club control through 2029\n\nThe Pirates had to get Isiah Kiner-Falefa in part because Gonzales wasn't hacking it at second base. And since IKF is signed through 2025, there's no downside for Pittsburgh in seeing what's out there for Gonzales this winter.\n\nHe was the No. 7 pick in the draft just four years ago and a top-50 prospect as recently as 2022. An enterprising team might see him as a change-of-scenery candidate.\n\nSan Diego Padres: 1B Jake Cronenworth\n\nAge: 30\n\n2024 Stats: 110 G, 467 PA, 14 HR, 2 SB, .250 AVG, .320 OBP, .413 SLG\n\nContract Status: Year 2 of 7-year, $80 million deal\n\nCronenworth appeared in trade rumors last winter, but it's no surprise the Padres didn't end up moving him. The .689 OPS he had posted in 2023 was no help to his value, and that was only the first season of his contract.\n\nBut if the Padres want to try again this winter—which would signal they're not done cutting payroll—they might have better luck. Even if his bat still isn't right for first base, his current production would work just fine if a team wanted to use him back at second base.\n\nSan Francisco Giants: OF Mike Yastrzemski\n\nAge: 33\n\n2024 Stats: 96 G, 309 PA, 9 HR, 2 SB, .248 AVG, .318 OBP, .446 SLG\n\nContract Status: $7.9 million salary, arbitration-eligible through 2025\n\nThough he wasn't the most notable Giant getting buzz ahead of the deadline, Rosenthal noted that Yastrzemski was among the hitters they were making available.\n\nGiven his age and relatively modest production, he may be more likely to get non-tendered than be traded this winter. But even if the Giants have the former in mind, they're sure to see if they can't pull off the latter first.\n\nJack Gorman/Getty Images\n\nSeattle Mariners: RHP Emerson Hancock\n\nAge: 25\n\nContract Status: $741,000 salary, under club control through 2029\n\nThough they ultimately didn't do so, the Mariners may have been willing to subtract from their starting rotation last winter. It's a concept they should revisit this winter, as it could be their ticket to adding a bat to an offense that has struggled all year.\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals: LHP Steven Matz\n\nAge: 33\n\nContract Status: Year 3 of 4-year, $44 million deal\n\nThere have been whispers concerning seemingly every young hitter under the Cardinals' employ, but that group doesn't really look like a surplus anymore. Instead, I'm putting the spotlight on Matz because, frankly, I don't know who else to put it on.\n\nThere isn't an obvious place for him in St. Louis' future, as the club can bring back all of its current starters for another go-round in 2025. If so, the Cards should at least try to shop Matz before they simply eat the $12.5 million he's owed in 2025.\n\nTampa Bay Rays: 1B Yandy Díaz\n\nAge: 33\n\n2024 Stats: 104 G, 459 PA, 10 HR, 0 SB, .274 AVG, .333 OBP, .406 SLG\n\nContract Status: Year 2 of 3-year, $24 million deal, with 2026 club option\n\nThere's not a lot of resemblance between the Rays of early August and the Rays of early July. That Díaz is still around is a surprise, as he seemed to be a shoo-in to be dealt ahead of the deadline.\n\nIt's hard to imagine him still being a Ray come 2025, though. His reliable bat gives him solid value. Enough, at least, for Tampa Bay to get talent back and offload his $10 million salary for next season if it trades him.\n\nJim McIsaac/Getty Images\n\nTexas Rangers: 1B Nathaniel Lowe\n\nAge: 29\n\n2024 Stats: 93 G, 375 PA, 9 HR, 2 SB, .263 AVG, .357 OBP, .390 SLG\n\nContract Status: $7.5 million salary, arbitration-eligible through 2026\n\nIt got lost in the shuffle, but there was a report from Jeff Wilson of Rangers Today that Lowe's name surfaced as \"a possible trade piece\" ahead of the deadline. Could be nothing. Or it could be something.\n\nIf his name surfaces again this winter, it might be because the Rangers don't want to give him a raise after back-to-back years of mediocre offense. Or it could be because they want to create an opening for an upgrade at the cold corner.\n\nToronto Blue Jays: 1B Vladimir Guerrero Jr.\n\nAge: 25\n\n2024 Stats: 113 G, 493 PA, 22 HR, 2 SB, .317 AVG, .391 OBP, .536 SLG\n\nContract Status: $19.9 million salary, arbitration-eligible through 2025\n\nThis is an attention-grabber, alright, though it comes with the caveat that Guerrero is still a Blue Jay for a reason. According to Ben Nicholson-Smith of Sportsnet, Toronto ultimately settled on a plan that keeps the \"the door open on contending\" next season.\n\nWhat could make things interesting, though, is if Guerrero and the Blue Jays can't hammer out an extension. That wouldn't have to automatically trigger a trade, but they would have to at least consider doing so while the slugger's value is back up.\n\nWashington Nationals: RHP Kyle Finnegan\n\nAge: 32\n\n2024 Stats: 48 G, 44 GF, 46.1 IP, 37 H (9 HR), 45 K, 14 BB, 3.30 ERA\n\nContract Status: $5.1 million salary, arbitration-eligible through 2025\n\nHow Finnegan didn't get moved at the deadline is a mystery wrapped in an enigma. He was clearly a trade candidate, and his MLB Trade Rumors page confirms the interest was there.\n\nOh well. There's always this winter, wherein the All-Star righty could draw a crowd as an alternative to paying big bucks for Tanner Scott or Clay Holmes on the free-agent market."
