New York: Little, Brown (Hachette), 2010. 374 pp. Krulak had a long career, so this biography cannot go into great detail about his involvement with Vietnam, first as Special Assistant for Counterinsurgency and Special Activities (SACSA) under Kennedy, and then as the commander of Fleet Marine Force, Pacific under Lyndon Johnson.\n\nGary K.

White Mane Publishing, 1996. 248 pp. Croizat arrived in Vietnam in 1954, and became in 1955 the first U.S. adviser to the Vietnamese Marine Corps.

The Virtual Vietnam Archive of the Vietnam Project, at Texas Tech University, has begun to place online, in the Joseph Drachnik Collection, some documents from his files. I don't know how large this body of material will eventually become, but I am optimistic. Since the U.S. Marine advisers to the Vietnamese Marine Corps also were under Drachnik, the collection also contains some (though not much) information about them. For a partial listing see Navy Documents.\n\nSimon Dunstan, 1st Marine Division in Vietnam.

Despite its name, this mathematical model considered the effects of ground weapons in combat, not just air power. The Rand (RAND) Corporation, a \"think tank\" financed by the U.S. military, published a variety of studies comparing the model's predictions with actual combat experiences of U.S. Marines in I Corps. Most Rand publications can be purchased in hard copy through the RAND Corporation online bookstore, but many also can be read online for free. Most of the FAST-VAL studies were originally classified \"Secret.\" In the case of the ones that are not available today, I am not sure whether this is because they simply have never been declassified, or for some other reason.\n\nJennifer Lind, K.

A black Marine, subject to racial harrassment, killed one of his white tormenters. Henderson says that although names and backgrounds of individuals have been changed, the events in the book are true, based on investigation records, court transcripts, and his conversations with a Marine Captain who was assigned to the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, First Marine Aircraft Wing, Danang, at the time of the events. There is a pretty good subject index. But the sources Henderson cites could not have given him a lot of the details in this book, including many conversations. Those have to have been invented, so I would classifiy this as semi-fiction.\n\nMichael A. Hennessy, Strategy in Vietnam: The Marines and Revolutionary Warfare in I Corps, 1965-1972.

Dates are inconsistent; in one place his Vietnam tour seems to have begun about June 1965, in another it seems to be ending about June 1965. As far as I can tell checking information from other (fragmentary) sources, HMM 162 did a four-month tour in Vietnam beginning June 1964, then returned to Vietnam in March 1965.\n\nCaptain Dale Eddy, a helicopter pilot with HMM 163, based at Da Nang, February to March 1965.\n\nSergeant Floyd Miller, a helicopter crew chief with HMM 163, who arrived at Da Nang February 1965.\n\nSergeant Daniel Gage, an aircraft fire control technician working on F-4B Phantoms, who was in Vietnam for about 5 months ending November 1, 1965.\n\nMajor Edward Chester Tipshus, who arrived on Okinawa as a Captain early September 1964 for what he thought would be a 13-month tour there with the 1/12 Marines. Then suddenly a group of about 60 officers and enlisted were alerted for transfer to Vietnam as battalion advisors. He arrived Vietnam 12 October 1964. He was given a two week Military Assistance Training Advisor (MATA) course in Saigon, then made the advisor to the 2nd Vietnamese Artillery Battalion of the 2nd Vietnamese Infantry Divsion, in I Corps. The battalion's guns were spread across southern I Corps in two-gun platoons under the operational control of the units to which they were attached. In December 1964, he was moved south to become an advisor in the Rung Sat Special Zone. Left Vietnam August 1965. Interview conducted 12 January 1966.\n\nCaptain Joseph B. Knotts, in Vietnam September 1964 to May 1965. He was senior adivsor to the 3rd Battalion, 6th Regiment of the ARVN in Quang Tin province, later PsyWar Civic Action Advisor to the 2nd ARVN Division in Da Nang.\n\nCaptain Don Hannah, an intelligence officer and F-4B Phantom pilot with VMFA-531, 10 April to 6 June 1965. Operating almost entirely in South Vietnam; discusses one mission north of the DMZ.\n\nLt. Col. Jack K. Knocke, commander of 2/12 Marines, an artillery battalion, in Vietnam in 1965.\n\nCaptain Harvey J. Morgan, commander if I Company, 3/9 Marines, March to June 1965 in the Da Nang area. The interview, conducted 12 January 1966, was mainly concerned with the occupation of Hill 327 immediately after the unit arrived in Vietnam.\n\nCaptain G.F. Squilis (sic), the S-3 (operations officer) of 1/3 Marines, in the Da Nang are March to September 1965. Company D of the battalion was sent to Da Nang in late January to provide security. The main part of the interview deals with the plans for movement of the battalin to Vietnam by air, and the actual movement. His name is variously spelled Squillis or Squilis in the interview transcript; the relevant volume of the USMC official history of the war lists him as Gaetano F. Squillace.\n\nMajor William Dickison, who was in Vietnam July to October 1965, as division ordnance officer of the 3d Marine Division. 4 pp. Interview conducted December 14, 1965.\n\nColonel James B. Ord, Jr., arrived in Vietnam in October 1968 and initially was commander of the 5th Marines. Later assistant chief of staff, G3, 1st Marine Division. Interview conducted November 3, 1969.\n\nMarine Corps Pacification: CAP, etc.\n\nJohn Akins, Nam Au Go Go: Falling for the Vietnamese Goddess of War. Port Jefferson, NY: Vineyard Pres, 2005. 262 pp. Akins arrived in Vietnam in February 1968, served in E Company, 2/1 Marines during operation Pegasus (the relief of Khe Sanh), then was assigned to CAP 1-1-4, then sent for a month of Vietnamese language training, then sent to CAP 1-1-7.\n\nBruce C.

He was quickly assigned to a CAP team, Papa Three, near Cam Lo just a few miles south of the DMZ. The story is supposed to be accurate in detail, except that names have been changed. A good account of what could happen to a CAP team in a high-risk area. (See also Edward Palm, below.)\n\nBarry L. Goodson, CAP M√¥t: The Story of a Marine Special Forces Unit in Vietnam, 1968-1969.

Hoa Vang district directly bordered the city of Danang to the west and south. The American impact on the area was of course huge, quite a aside from the large number of CAPs in the district. The text of this report, and some memos commenting on it, and some unrelated documents on the CAP program, have been placed on-line in the Virtual Vietnam Archive of the Vietnam Project at Texas Tech University.\n\nFrancis J.

Culbertson, A Sniper in the Arizona: 2d Battalion, 5th Marines, in the Arizona Territory, 1967. New York: Ivy, 1999. 270 pp. (plus photocopied documents, as unnumbered pages after p. 270, on the death of Capt. James Graham, Commander, F Company, 2/5 Marines, June 2, 1967). This book, the second Culbertson has written about his service in Vietnam, ends abruptly in early June 1967, not going up to his departure in July; there may be a third book coming.\n\nJohn J. Culbertson, 13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam. New York: Presidio/Ballantine, 2003. xiv, 272 pp. A collection of stories about various members of the sniper platoon of the 5th Marines, from 1966 through about April 1967. Additional volumes are planned.\n\nCarlos Hathcock was probably the most famous Marine sniper of the Vietnam War. He served two tours between 1966 and 1969.\n\nRobert F. Burgess, Hathcock and Burke: The Marine Corps' Deadly Duo. Chattahoochee, FL: Spyglass, 2020. 109 pp. Burgess writes so many such short volumes that I doubt he can spend much time on them, and the short chapter (pp. 11-13) that is available in the sample for reading on Amazon looks fictional to me.\n\nRoy F. Chandler and Norman A. Chandler, White Feather: Carlos Hathcock USMC Scout Sniper. Jacksonville, NC: Iron Brigade Armory Publishing, 1997. 277 pp.\n\nCharles Henderson, Marine Sniper: 93 confirmed kills. Briarcliff Manor, NY: Stein and Day, 1986. 274 pp. (there is also a book club edition with the same publication data, but xviii, 236 pp.). New York: Berkley, 1988. xv, 291 pp. This appears to me to be heavily fictionalized. What concerns me is not just the invented dialogue, and the passage where Henderson recounts the thoughts passing through the mind of a PAVN general moments before the general's death. What seems more serious is the story in Chapter 7 of the Viet Cong nicknamed \"Apache,\" who is supposed to have taken prisoner and tortured to death, sometimes noisily and within earshot of American positions, more than a dozen U.S. Marines during a three-month period in 1966. I don't believe Marines were that easy to capture, and I don't believe anything even vaguely resembling what Henderson describes could have occurred without the fact having been reported in numerous more reliable sources. Chapter 14, \"Stalking the General,\" is if anything even more preposterous. The PAVN has placed a division headquarters in the center of a wide open space, with no cover for more than a mile in any direction. The United States, learning of this, does not obliterate the headquarters with an air strike. Instead a valuable sniper is sent on a near-suicidal mission to spend days crawling across the open space through short grass, in order to get close enough to kill the division commander with a single bullet, leaving the division staff unharmed. I don't believe a word of it.\n\nCharles Henderson, Silent Warrior: The Marine Sniper's Story Continues. New York: Berkley, 2000. xvi, 286 pp. Sequel to the above.\n\nEd Kugler, Dead Center: A Marine Sniper's Two-Year Odyssey in the Vietnam War. New York: Ivy, 1999. 370 pp. Kugler arrived in Vietnam in March 1966, and promptly joined the 4th Marines' scout-sniper unit. After training, he was assigned to 3d Force Recon, eventually some other unit. Served two tours.\n\nCharles B. \"Chuck\" Mawhinney served in Vietnam from May 1968 to March 1970. He had 106 confirmed kills, the most of any Marine sniper in Vietnam.\n\nJim Lindsay, The Sniper: The Untold Story of the Marine Corps' Greatest Marksman of All Time. New York: St. Martin's, 2023. xix, 231 pp. Foreword by Chuck Mawhinney.\n\nChuck Mawhinney, interviewed by Marc Honorf, \"Top Marine Corps Sniper.\" Vietnam Magazine, April 2003, pp. 18-25. Mawhinney trained as a scout-sniper, was sent to Vietnam in March 1968, served three months in L Company, 3/5 Marines before shifting to a scout-sniper unit.\n\nJohn R. Nutting, The Court-Martial of Corporal Nutting: A Memoir of the Vietnam War. Skyhorse, 2014. 208 pp. Nutting arrived in Vietnam late in 1966. He served initially in F Company, 2/3 Marines, later became a scout-sniper. He was court-martialed for possession of marijuana.\n\nPeter R. Senich, The One-Round War: USMC Scout-Snipers in Vietnam.
