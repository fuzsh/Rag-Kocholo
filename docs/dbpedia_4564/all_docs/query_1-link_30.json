Their use dates to World War 2, but Marine helicopter squadrons first used call sign in combat during the Korean War.\n\nIn Korea, call signs changed on a regular basis; during the Vietnam War, squadrons might use the same call sign for more than a year. Today, squadrons deploying to a combat zone,i.e. Iraq and Afghanistan, are assigned a \"theater\" call sign for use during that deployment only."
