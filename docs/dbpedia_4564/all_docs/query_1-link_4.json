        "text": "← 1964\n\n1966 →\n\nUS Army soldiers disembarking from helicopters in the Ia Drang Valley\n\nLocation\n\nBelligerents\n\nAnti-Communist forces:\n\nSouth Vietnam\n\nUnited States\n\nSouth Korea\n\nAustralia\n\nNew Zealand\n\nKingdom of Laos\n\nRepublic of China\n\nCommunist forces:\n\nNorth Vietnam\n\nViet Cong\n\nPathet Lao\n\nPeople's Republic of China\n\nSoviet Union\n\nNorth KoreaStrength US: 184,314\n\nSouth Vietnam: 514,000 (including militia)Casualties and losses US: 1,928 killed[1]\n\nSouth Vietnam: 11,242 killed.[2]: 275 North Vietnam: 35,436 killed\n\nIn 1965, the United States rapidly increased its military forces in South Vietnam, prompted by the realization that the South Vietnamese government was losing the Vietnam War as the communist-dominated Viet Cong (VC) gained influence over much of the population in rural areas of the country. North Vietnam also rapidly increased its infiltration of men and supplies to combat South Vietnam and the U.S. The objective of the U.S. and South Vietnam was to prevent a communist take-over. North Vietnam and the VC sought to unite the two sections of the country.\n\nPolitical instability and internal dissent continued to plague the government of South Vietnam, although in June General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu and Air Marshall Nguyễn Cao Kỳ took control of the country and remained in power for the remainder of the year. In the United States, a majority of Congress and the people supported U.S. participation in the war, although protests against the war became larger and more frequent, especially among college students.\n\nThe U.S. began bombing North Vietnam in March, in Operation Rolling Thunder. The U.S. Army and Marines began ground operations to ferret out and defeat the communist forces. U.S. Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV), commanded by General William Westmoreland adopted a strategy of attrition, employing U.S. superiority in firepower, technology, and mobility. The usual military tactic of the United States was search and destroy operations in which large U.S. and South Vietnamese units, supported by air and artillery, swept through an area to attempt to engage the communists in battle. The People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the VC, by contrast, relied on hit-and-run operations and ambushes, avoiding set-piece battles except at their own initiative.\n\nIn November, the U.S. and PAVN met head-on for the first time in the Battle of Ia Drang. Both sides claimed victory. The U.S. inflicted heavy casualties on the PAVN, but the battle vindicated the conviction by North Vietnam that its military could slowly grind down the U.S.'s commitment to the war.\n\nSouth Korea contributed an army division to South Vietnam, while Australia, New Zealand and other countries provided smaller numbers of soldiers. North Vietnam received military aid from the Soviet Union and China.\n\nAt year's end, President Lyndon Johnson declared a temporary halt to the bombing of North Vietnam and undertook a diplomatic initiative to seek negotiations with North Vietnam. North Vietnam, on its part, aimed to achieve a decisive military victory, but prepared also for an expanded war if the U.S. continued to escalate its involvement.\n\nJanuary\n\n[edit]\n\n1 January\n\nThe South Vietnamese security forces, including the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), Regional and Popular Forces, Montagnard irregulars and National Police totaled 567,246 personnel.[2]: 20 23,310 U.S. military personnel were in South Vietnam.[3]: 102\n\nThe number of VC guerrillas and PAVN regulars in South Vietnam was a matter of much debate. One U.S. government estimate was that the VC consisted of 40,000 full-time fighters and 80,000 to 100,000 part-time guerrillas.[2]: 19 The Department of Defense's fact book estimated that the VC numbered less than 200,000 plus 39,175 political cadre.[4]: 34 These numbers presumably included thousands of PAVN soldiers and cadre infiltrated during the previous five years. The first PAVN units dispatched to South Vietnam, consisting of three regiments (about 5,000 men), had arrived in South Vietnam in late 1964.[5]: 200 A junior-level Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analyst, Samuel A. Adams, had just begun work estimating VC numbers; he would later conclude that MACV underestimated VC strength by about one-half.[2]: 20 [4]: 84\n\nBoth North Vietnam and the United States would rapidly increase the number of their troops in South Vietnam during 1965.\n\nThe Battle of Binh Gia concluded as the PAVN/VC withdrew from the battlefield. In six days of fighting, the VC 9th Division had killed 201 South Vietnamese soldiers from the Airborne Division, Marine Division and Rangers and five American advisers.[6]: 302–3\n\n3 January\n\nSenator Mike Mansfield, considered the U.S. Congress's most knowledgeable person about Vietnam, appeared on television and said that neutralization of South Vietnam through an agreement reached by negotiations between the U.S. and the communist powers might be the best solution to the war. Mansfield was one of several senators who had doubts about the course of U.S. policy in South Vietnam.[6]: 305–6\n\n6 January\n\nThe Armed Forces Council made a show of officially renouncing all their power to Prime Minister Tran Van Huong, who was asked to organize elections.[7]: 350 They also agreed to appoint a civilian body and release those arrested in the December coup.[8]: 297\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam General Maxwell Taylor summed up the situation in a telegram to the U.S. government in Washington. \"We are faced here with a seriously deteriorating situation characterized by continued political turmoil, irresponsibility and division within the armed forces, lethargy in the pacification program, some anti-US feeling which could grow, signs of mounting terrorism by VC directly at US personnel and deepening discouragement and loss of morale throughout SVN. Unless these conditions are somehow changed and trends reversed, we are likely soon to face a number of unpleasant developments ranging from anti-American demonstrations, further civil disorders, and even political assassinations to the ultimate installation of a hostile govt which will ask us to leave while it seeks accommodation with the National Liberation Front and Hanoi.\"\n\nTaylor opposed the introduction of U.S. ground units to help fight the VC (as proposed in frustration by President Johnson a few days earlier), endorsing instead a U.S. policy of graduated air attacks against the Ho Chi Minh trail, the supply line for the PAVN/VC itself.[9]\n\nSouth Vietnamese military strength: January 1, 1965 Regulars (Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps) 246,284 Regional Force (RF) 96,049 Popular Force (PF) 168, 317 National Police 31,395 Civilian Irregular Defense Group 21,454 Coastal Force 3,747 Total 567,246\n\n9 January\n\nHuong and the South Vietnamese military again reiterated their commitment to civilian rule through an elected legislature and a new constitution, and that \"all genuine patriots\" would be \"earnestly assembled\" to collaborate in making a plan to defeat the communists.[8]: 297 Khánh and Taylor were both signatories to this announcement.[10]: 122\n\n14 January\n\nTwo U.S. jets were shot down over central Laos while bombing North Vietnamese supply lines.[3]: 104\n\n15 January\n\nThe first two Women's Army Corps soldiers arrived in Saigon.[11]\n\n20 January\n\nWhile Buddhist protests against the government and the United States intensified, including the burning of a United States Information Service library in Huế, Ambassador Taylor met with a Buddhist leader. He said the Buddhists wanted peace and told Taylor that the leaders of South Vietnam were only interested in the benefits they could derive personally from American aid and would otherwise capitulate to the VC. The Buddhists had been protesting against the government of South Vietnam for the previous two years.[6]: 212\n\n21 January\n\nAn ARVN air assault in Kien Hoa Province killed 46 VC and captured 61.[3]: 104\n\n26 January\n\nIn a speech, former Vice President Richard Nixon argued the U.S. military effort should be escalated to destroy communist supply lines and staging areas in Laos and North Vietnam. He said the U.S. must \"either get out, surrender on the installment plan through neutralization, or... find a way to win.\"[12]: 321\n\n27 January\n\nAmidst continuing political chaos in South Vietnam, General Nguyễn Khánh and the Armed Forces Council overthrew the civilian government of Trần Văn Hương in a bloodless coup, replacing Houng with civilian Nguyễn Xuân Oánh. Khánh, who had been Prime Minister during most of 1964, had been hovering in the background for some time, so the coup d'état was not a great surprise. Ambassador Taylor cabled Washington that Khánh had an alliance with the Buddhist Institute headed by Thích Trí Quang. Taylor said, \"The most sinister aspect of this affair is the obvious danger that the Buddhist victory may be an important step toward the formation of a government which will eventually lead the country into negotiations with Hanoi and the National Liberation Front [VC].\"[6]: 316\n\nIn response to the coup, National Security Council director McGeorge Bundy and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara wrote a memo to President Johnson. They gave the President two options: use American military power to defeat the insurgency, or negotiate thus attempting to \"salvage what little can be preserved\". Bundy and McNamara favored the first option; Secretary of State Dean Rusk disagreed. Johnson accepted the military option and sent a telegram to Ambassador Taylor in Saigon saying \"the U.S. will spare no effort and no sacrifice in doing its full part to turn back the Communists in Vietnam.\" President Johnson had crossed the Rubicon.[6]: 317–9\n\n27 January - 4 February\n\nIn Laos two coups took place. On 27 January General Phoumi Nosavan once again attempted to seize control of the government but was opposed by forces loyal to General Kouprasith Abhay. On 29 January Colonel Bounleut Saycocie independently mounted his own coup, but after a short term takeover of Vientiane's radio station and infrastructure his forces returned to Government control and were then used by Kouprasith to suppress Phoumi's coup.[13]: 123–5\n\nFebruary\n\n[edit]\n\n6 February\n\nThe VC's Radio Liberation announced that the VC had shot two American prisoners of war as reprisals against the Vietnamese government, which had sentenced two VC to death.[14]\n\n7 February\n\nThe VC attacked Camp Holloway near Pleiku killing eight Americans, wounding 128, destroying 10 U.S. aircraft and damaging a further 15. McGeorge Bundy (visiting South Vietnam) and General Westmoreland visited Pleiku that day. Bundy strongly recommended a reprisal attack against North Vietnam.[15]: 215 Bundy reported to Johnson \"The situation in Vietnam is deteriorating and without new U.S. action defeat appears inevitable--probably not in a matter of weeks or perhaps even months, but within the next year or so.... There is still time to turn it around, but not much.\"[16]: 14\n\nIn retaliation, President Johnson ordered Operation Flaming Dart: 49 retaliatory sorties by American and Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) planes targeted PAVN bases near Đồng Hới; a second wave targeted VC logistics and communications near the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Among the pilots was Air Marshal Kỳ. Poor weather limited the damage caused by the strikes. One plane and its pilot were lost.[17]: 58 [15]: 218–9\n\nThe Premier of the Soviet Union, Alexei Kosygin, was visiting Hanoi during the bombing. The Soviets were furious that an American attack was carried out while Kosygin was present and motivated to provide additional assistance to North Vietnam.[18]\n\nBundy sent a memorandum to President Johnson advocating \"a new US action\" without which \"defeat seems inevitable\". Bundy said that \"any negotiated US withdrawal today would mean surrender on the installment plan.\"[12]: 329–30\n\n8 February\n\nThe USMC 1st LAAM Battalion based on Okinawa arrived at Da Nang Air Base and by 9 April its HAWK SAMs were operational at the base.[19]: 4–5\n\n9 February\n\nAs bombing of North Vietnam continued, the People's Republic of China issued a statement that \"We warn U.S. imperialism: You are overreaching yourselves in trying to extend the war with your small forces in Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the Far East. To be frank, we are waiting for you in battle array.\"[20] On the same day, U.S. National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy told Senator Mike Mansfield that the Johnson administration \"was willing to run the risk of a war with China\" if an invasion of North Vietnam was deemed necessary.[21]\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Moscow was attacked by a mob of about 3,000 Asian and Russian students who were protesting against the American bombing of North Vietnam. Two reporters, Adam Clymer of the Baltimore Sun and Bernard Ullman of the Agence-France news agency, were injured, and more than 200 windows in the building were shattered before Moscow police intervened.[22]\n\nThe first twenty of 1,819 wives and children of South Vietnam-based American civilian and military personnel departed that nation, by order of President Johnson.[23] The rest, including the dependents of Ambassador Taylor and General Westmoreland, departed over the next 15 days.\n\n10 February\n\nVC sappers blew up a hotel used as an enlisted men's barracks in Qui Nhơn, killing 23 U.S. soldiers, two VC sappers and seven civilians.[24]: 41\n\n11 February\n\nIn response to the Qui Nhơn attack President Johnson ordered Operation Flaming Dart II: 155 sorties and air strikes by U.S. and RVNAF aircraft.[17]: 58–9\n\nIn Hanoi, Soviet Premier Kosygin announced the Soviet Union had agreed to assist North Vietnam to defend itself from air attacks, by providing surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), jet fighter planes, technical support and advisers.[25]\n\nOn his way back to Moscow from Hanoi, Kosygin stopped in Beijing for the second time in less than a month, and met with Mao Zedong, with a suggestion that the two nations help the United States to \"find a way out of Vietnam\" that would end the continuing war there; Mao's response was a warning that the Soviets should not use Vietnam as a bargaining issue in negotiations with the U.S., and refused to agree.[26]\n\n13 February\n\nPresident Johnson approved Operation Rolling Thunder, the Joint Chiefs of Staff plan for the sustained bombing of North Vietnam. Over an eight-week period, U.S. warplanes planned to bomb fixed targets and interdict military traffic along roads in southern North Vietnam. Johnson did not immediately launch Rolling Thunder.[6]: 333–4\n\n16 February\n\nIn the Vung Ro Bay Incident, an American pilot spotted a 100-ton North Vietnamese naval trawler unloading munitions on a beach at a remote bay on the coast of central South Vietnam. RVNAF aircraft sank the ship and the defenders and crew were later killed or captured after a firefight with South Vietnamese naval commandos. The incident spurred further United States Navy involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\nThe Armed Forces Council of South Vietnam appointed medical doctor Phan Huy Quát as Prime Minister.[7]: 363\n\nRadio Moscow, the official English-language broadcasting station of the Soviet Union, warned that American bombing raids on North Vietnam could lead to a world war. \"The flames of war starting in one place could easily spread to neighboring countries and, in the final count, embrace the whole world\", the broadcast noted, and admonished that \"responsibility for the dire consequences of such a policy rests with America.\"[27]\n\n17 February\n\nOn the United States Senate floor, Senator Frank Church said \"The Saigon government is losing its war, not for lack of equipment, but for lack of internal cohesion\" and the best solution would be the negotiation of a neutral South Vietnam. Church's speech was supported by several other prominent Democratic Party Senators, including George McGovern. Church's call for a neutral South Vietnam echoed similar statements by French President Charles de Gaulle, the Pope and the Secretary General of the United Nations. Former President Eisenhower and several Republicans supported Johnson's policy. Eisenhower advised Johnson not to negotiate from weakness.[6]: 333–50\n\n18 February\n\nInfluential columnist Walter Lippman in The Washington Post said escalation of the war would be a disaster. \"For this country to involve itself in such a war in Asia would be an act of supreme folly.\"[6]: 351–2\n\n19 February\n\nColonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo and General Lam Van Phat mounted a coup d'état to overthrow General Khánh, head of the Armed Forces Council. The coup failed but the instability forced Khanh from power. North Vietnam later revealed that Thao was a communist agent.[7]: 307 [28]: 325 The coup collapsed when the U.S., in collaboration with Generals Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Cao Văn Viên, assembled units hostile to both Khanh and the current coup into a Capital Liberation Force.[29]: 302 Saigon was recaptured \"without a shot\" the next day by loyal troops and Khanh was restored to power[30]\n\n21 February\n\nThe 15 generals comprising South Vietnam's High National Council — Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, Nguyen Van Cao and Nguyễn Cao Kỳ — voted to remove General Khánh from leadership as Prime Minister, and replaced him with a caretaker civilian premier, Trần Văn Hương.[31]\n\n22 February\n\nGeneral Westmoreland requested that two battalions of United States Marines be assigned to protect Da Nang Air Base from the increasing threat of attacks by the VC.[19]: 7\n\n25 February\n\nGeneral Khánh departed South Vietnam. He was persuaded to leave by his fellow generals and by Colonel Wilson of MACV. Air Marshall Kỳ became the de facto leader of South Vietnam.[7]: 364 [6]: 362\n\n26 February\n\nThe first South Korean troops arrived in South Vietnam in a brigade group known as Dove Force. These included engineers, a medical unit, military police, a navy LST, liaison staff, and other support personnel. Dove Force was deployed to Biên Hòa and helped build schools, roads and bridges. Medical teams are reported to have treated over 30,000 South Vietnamese civilians. The civilian operations in the early southern part of the campaign are reported to have had some success.[3]: 108 [32]: 122–4\n\n27 February\n\nThe U.S. Department of State issued a white paper to the press, Aggression From the North: The Record of North Viet-Nam's Campaign to Conquer South Viet-Nam, as a part of the U.S. government's effort to justify the escalation of the role of the U.S. in the war.[33] As a CIA employee and National Security Council staffmember would note later, the paper \"proved to be a dismal disappointment... the only hard information we had about North Vietnamese participation and supplies and so forth came from information that was much too highly classified to include, and the only information that was of sufficiently low classification was pretty thin gruel.\"[34]: 127\n\n28 February\n\nThe U.S. and South Vietnam announced that sustained bombing of North Vietnam would begin during the coming week. As a result of the announcement, North Vietnam's leaders ordered the evacuation of children and elderly residents from Hanoi and other major cities.[35]\n\nMarch\n\n[edit]\n\n1 March\n\nAmbassador Taylor met with generals Thiệu and Trần Văn Minh in Saigon to request permission for the assignment of the Marines to Da Nang Air Base. The generals raised no objections, but asked that the Marines arrive \"in the most inconspicuous way feasible\".[19]: 9\n\nIn a memo to the Secretary of the Army, Stephen Ailes McNamara advised \"I want it clearly understood that there are unlimited appropriations available for the financing of aid to Vietnam... under no circumstances is a lack of money to stand in the way of aid to that nation.\"[24]: 43\n\n2 March\n\nOperation Rolling Thunder was launched. One hundred and four U.S. fighter-bombers and 19 RVNAF aircraft hit targets in the largest U.S. bombing raid to date against North Vietnam. Five U.S. planes and one RVNAF plane were shot down. The operation was meant to last eight weeks, but instead lasted more than three years.[36]: 408 [15]: 234\n\nPreviously, North Vietnam and its allies China and the Soviet Union had indicated a willingness for negotiations leading to the neutralization of South Vietnam and the withdrawal of the U.S. The bombing resulted in a hardened and less flexible communist position. North Vietnam shut down channels it had with Canada and France for exploring negotiations.[6]: 366–7\n\n4 March\n\nAn angry mob assembled outside the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to protest the bombing of North Vietnam, before finally being driven away by police on horseback and soldiers.[37] The next day, the Soviet Union formally apologized to the U.S. government and began replacement of 310 broken windows in the embassy building and the removal of stains from more than 200 inkpots that had been shattered against the walls.[38]\n\n5 to 12 March\n\nDuring a visit to Saigon Chief of Staff of the United States Army General Harold Keith Johnson met with senior officers and advised them that he had a \"blank checque\" from President Johnson to prosecute the war and asked then what they need to win.[24]: 43\n\n6 March\n\nMcGeorge Bundy wrote a memo to President Johnson saying: \"Last night, Bob McNamara said for the first time what many others have thought for a long time - that the Pentagon and the military have been going at this thing the wrong way round from the very beginning: they have been concentrating on military results against guerrillas in the field, when they should have been concentrating on intense police control from the individual villager on up.\"[39]: 413–4\n\n8 March\n\n1,400 Marines of the U.S. 9th Marine Expeditionary Brigade began to land on beaches near Da Nang. The arrival of the Marines heralded the direct involvement of American combat units in the war. The Marines had the responsibility of guarding the Da Nang Air Base but were ordered to \"not, repeat not, engage in day-to-day actions against the Viet Cong.\" By the end of March the Marines at Da Nang numbered almost 5,000[19]: 11–6 Although there were 23,000 American military personnel in South Vietnam already, the deployment represented \"the first body of Americans to go to the embattled southeast Asian nation as a fighting military unit.\"[40]\n\n10 March\n\nIn Washington, Assistant Secretary of Defense John McNaughton sent a memo to National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy outlining the U.S. objectives in South Vietnam in percentage terms: \"70% - to avoid a humiliating US defeat...; 20% - to keep SVN [South Vietnam]...territory from Chinese hands; 10% - to permit the people of SVN to enjoy a better, freer way of life.[15]: 236–7\n\nThe first drawings were held under Australia's new birthday lottery system of conscription. At the Department of Labor and National Service in Melbourne, Representative Dan Mackinnon drew marbles from a barrel as part of the \"birthday ballot\" until there were sufficient eligible men to meet the quota of 4,200 draftees. The results were kept secret, with a policy that \"Although pressmen will be able to watch and photograph the drawing of the first marble they will not be allowed to see or photograph the number on it.\" Young men whose birthdays were selected were \"balloted out\" and would be notified within four weeks.[41]\n\n11 March - March 1973\n\nOperation Market Time, a U.S. Navy operation began off of the coast of North and South Vietnam with patrols along the coast and out to 150 miles (240 km) offshore, in order to disrupt North Vietnam's supply lines to the PAVN/VC in the south.[42]\n\n12 March\n\nVice President of the United States Hubert Humphrey had dinner with the Ambassador of the Soviet Union Anatoly Dobrynin in Washington. Dobrynin asked why the U.S. bombed North Vietnam while the USSR Premier Kosygin was visiting Hanoi. Dobrynin advised that the USSR was now committed to the support of North Vietnam, saying \"We can't be a leader and stand by and ignore the bombing of the North Vietnamese.\"[43]\n\n16 March\n\n82-year old Alice Herz stood at the corner of Grand River Avenue and Oakman Boulevard in Detroit, doused herself with two cans of flammable cleaning fluid, then set herself ablaze in protest against the war.[44] She left a note that said, \"I choose the illuminating death of a Buddhist to protest against a great country trying to wipe out a small country for no reason.\" Two bystanders smothered the flames, but she died of her burns 10 days later.[45]\n\n17 March\n\nThe CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency issued an estimate of military strength in South Vietnam. The armed forces of South Vietnam numbered 567,000, of which 245,000 belonged to the ARVN and the remainder to the Regional and Popular Force militia. The VC was estimated to number between 50,000 and 60,000 regulars and 100,000 militia.[46]: 143\n\n20 March\n\nAfter hearing from General Johnson that it would take five years of fighting and 500,000 American troops to win the war, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to McNamara to change the American mission from being \"not simply to withstand the Viet Cong... but to gain effective operational superiority and assume the offensive\", and that two additional divisions of combat troops be transferred to South Vietnam for that purpose. \"To turn the tide of war,\" the memo said, \"requires an objective of destroying the Viet Cong, not merely to keep pace with them, or slow their rate of advance.\"[34]: 174–5\n\n22 March\n\nQuoting Associated Press (AP) photographer Horst Faas and unidentified sources, AP reporter Peter Arnett broke the story that U.S. and South Vietnamese forces were using gas warfare in combat. Though he emphasized that these were \"non-lethal\" gases dispensed by helicopters and bombers, Arnett wrote that \"one gas reportedly causes extreme nausea and vomiting, another loosens the bowels\".[47] Hours after the story was revealed, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Defense confirmed for afternoon papers that the story of the use of gas, but said that it was only being used by \"South Vietnam's armed forces\".[48] Two days later, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk would hold a press conference to respond to the controversy, saying \"We are not embarking upon gas warfare in Vietnam. There has been no policy decision to engage in gas warfare in Vietnam. We are not talking about agents or weapons that are associated with gas warfare... We are not talking about gas that is prohibited by the Geneva Convention of 1925.\"[49]\n\n24–25 March\n\nThe first Teach-in to protest the war was held at the University of Michigan, 3,500 people attended.[50][51]\n\n25 March\n\nChina announced that it was ready to \"send its personnel to fight together with the Vietnamese people to annihilate the American aggressors.\"[52]\n\nRepublican senators John Sherman Cooper and Jacob Javits called on Johnson to support negotiations between North and South Vietnam without any preconditions.[53]\n\n26 March\n\nWestmoreland, said in a report to Washington that the South Vietnamese armed forces had \"begun to show evidence of fragmentation and there is no longer an effective chain of command\".[54]\n\n29 March\n\nIn the face of disagreement among U.S. military leaders about where and how many U.S. combat troops should be stationed in Vietnam, McNamara, Westmoreland, Ambassador Taylor and the Joint Chiefs met in Washington. The Chiefs and Westmoreland wanted two U.S. combat divisions sent to Vietnam along with one combat division from the Republic of Korea. Taylor disagreed. McNamara didn't take a position. In meetings the next day, President Johnson agreed only to the assignment of two additional U.S. combat battalions to South Vietnam, but he approved an expansion and extension of the bombing of North Vietnam under Operation Rolling Thunder.[46]: 145–6\n\nAfter a three-year testing period that had started with the beginning of Operation Ranch Hand on 29 December 1961, the United States moved into the second phase of the operation with the heavy use of defoliants and herbicides in combat zones. Initially, four tactical herbicides, codenamed Purple, Pink, Green and Blue, were used, with Purple, a combination of 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) being the used the most.[55]\n\n30 March\n\nThe VC exploded a car bomb in front of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon killing 22 people, including 2 Americans.[56]: 110\n\nThe Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China signed an agreement allowing Soviet trains to travel through China to deliver economic and military aid to North Vietnam. However Mao Zedong rejected a request by Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev to allow Soviets overflights through an air corridor for shipments.[57]\n\nThe RAND Corporation publishes its first report on the war: Viet Cong Motivation and Morale in 1964 A Preliminary Report based on interviews with 145 VC POWs defectors and suspects between July and December 1964.[58]\n\nApril\n\n[edit]\n\nIn North Vietnam President Ho Chi Minh decreed a new military service law. Enlistments were extended indefinitely for soldiers, previously discharged soldiers were recalled, and an increased number of young people were inducted into military service. During 1965, North Vietnam expanded the size of its army by 290,000 personnel and its self-defense militia from 1.4 million to 2.0 million.[59]: 164\n\n1 April\n\nPresident Johnson authorized a change in the U.S. Marines' mission in South Vietnam, a month after the first units had been sent to protect installations at Da Nang from attack. For the first time, American ground troops were scheduled to move into the surrounding area and to engage PAVN/VC forces in combat.[60]\n\n1st Logistical Command was activated in Saigon to assume logistics support for the U.S. Army in II, III and IV Corps.[61]\n\n3 April\n\nThe first jet-to-jet combat of the war took place when four U.S. Navy F-8E Crusaders from the USS Hancock were engaged by eight Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF) MiG-17 fighters from the 921st Sao Do Regiment. One of the F-8Es was set on fire by cannons fired from a MiG-17 but was able to land safely at Da Nang.[62] The VPAF claim to have shot down two F-8Es.[59]: 166 In future years, 3 April would be a Vietnamese public holiday commemorated as \"Air Force Day.\"[63]\n\n3 April - 11 November 1968\n\nOperation Steel Tiger was a covert United States Air Force (USAF) 2nd Air Division, later Seventh Air Force and U.S. Navy Task Force 77 aerial interdiction effort targeted against the Ho Chi Minh Trail in southeastern Laos.[64]: 53\n\n4 April\n\nThe USAF conducted its first airstrike on the Thanh Hóa Bridge, the raid failed to down the bridge and it would resist further attacks until finally being downed on 13 May 1972. Two USAF F-105 Thunderchief strike aircraft were shot down and both their pilots killed, the first aircraft lost in air-to-air combat by either side during the war.[65] A USAF F-100 Super Sabre fighter escorting the strike aircraft scored the first probable USAF kill of the war shooting down a VPAF MiG-17.[66]\n\n5 April\n\nA U.S. Navy RF-8 Crusader reconnaissance aircraft photographed an SA-2 Guideline surface-to-air missile (SAM) site under construction in North Vietnam for the first time. The discovery, 15 miles (24 km) southeast of Hanoi, \"sent shivers down the spines of task force commanders and line aviators alike\", a historian would note later, but official permission to attack a site so close to the capital would not be given \"until the Navy and Air Force lost a few jets to the SA-2s\".[67]\n\n5-7 April\n\nFighting in the Mekong Delta kills 276 VC and six U.S. advisers and helicopter crewmen.[3]: 115\n\n7 April\n\nPresident Johnson made a major televised speech at Johns Hopkins University. Johnson described the war as an attack by North Vietnam on South Vietnam. He proposed \"unconditional discussions\" to exchange views with interested parties in search of a peaceful solution, but offered no concessions. Johnson also proposed a massive program to develop the Mekong River basin which could include North Vietnam among the recipients of the Tennessee Valley Authority-type project. Ho Chi Minh responded that the United States must withdraw from South Vietnam as a condition for a peace agreement.[39]: 423–6 The Johns Hopkins speech marked a change in American policy. Formerly, over a period of several years of escalating warfare in South Vietnam, the U.S. had refused to consider talking to the VC and North Vietnamese until the U.S. and South Vietnam had gained a military advantage.[39]: 421\n\nElements of the VC 2nd Regiment attacked the positions of the 2nd Vietnamese Marine Battalion at midnight. The Marines repulsed 10 attacks and the VC withdrew at dawn leaving 59 dead, 10 wounded and 71 weapons. Intelligence revealed that a further 70 VC dead and over 200 wounded were removed from the battlefield; VNMC losses were four killed.[19]: 206\n\n8 April\n\nNorth Vietnamese Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng responded to President Johnson's proposal for peace negotiations by announcing North Vietnam's Four Points peace formula: withdrawal of all U.S. forces from South Vietnam, neutralization of both Vietnams pending reunification, adoption of the program of the National Liberation Front [VC] for internal affairs, and reunification without foreign interference.[68]: 25\n\nA mutiny by 20 young officers ousted Admiral Chung Tấn Cang as commander of the Republic of Vietnam Navy in an action \"that evidently had the government's blessing\". The military junta governing South Vietnam did not order a response, and one U.S. official commented that Cang, an associate of recently ousted President Nguyen Khanh, \"has been a thorn in our side\", because of his lack of cooperation in moving military supplies.[69]\n\nTwo U.S. Navy F-4B Phantom fighters flew into Chinese airspace and were tracked by radar flying over the Yulin Naval Base on Hainan Island, but departed before the Chinese military could respond to an alert.[70]\n\n9 April\n\nAt a CINCPAC meeting in Hawaii, the planners recommended the deployment of two brigades to South Vietnam. One would be stationed at Biên Hòa near Saigon to protect Bien Hoa Air Base; the other would go to Nha Trang to prepare for the introduction of a full division of U.S. troops. Ambassador Taylor had not been present at the meeting and he protested that \"Recent actions relating to the introduction of U.S. ground forces have tended to create an eagerness in some quarters to deploy forces into SVN which I find difficult to understand.\" Taylor opposed the introduction of American ground troops for offensive operations, believing they should be restricted to coastal \"enclaves\". General Westmoreland disagreed, believing that enclaves were \"an inglorious, static use of U.S. forces....that would leave the decision of when and where to strike to the enemy.\"[46]: 140–9\n\nTwo groups of four U.S. Navy F-4Bs, flew over Hainan Island. This time, a squadron of four Jian-5 jet fighters from the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) intercepted them, with instructions not to fire unless fired upon. The American pilots stated that they had believed that they were outside China's airspace and in an area 36 miles (58 km) southwest of Hainan, while China accused the U.S. of trying to provoke a war.[70]\n\n10-14 April\n\nOn 10 April 1965 Task Force Alpha of 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines was landed by helicopter from Danang Air Base to secure Phu Bai airfield and the surrounding area. On 13 April a detachment of ten UH-34D helicopters from HMM-162 was established at Phu Bai. On 14 April Battalion Landing Team 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines replaced Task Force Alpha at Phu Bai.[19]: 235\n\n14 April\n\nThe U.S. and South Vietnam began \"Operation Fact Sheet\", a psychological warfare aerial mission, dropping over two million notices on those cities in North Vietnam with military facilities. The paper leaflets carried different types of messages written in the Vietnamese language. Some of them warned civilians to stay away from the areas that were to be bombed, and others suggested that civilians \"could end the bombings by turning against their government\", or advocated the benefits of moving to South Vietnam. During April, May and June, nearly 25 million papers were dropped. \"The leaflets had no effect on North Vietnamese strategy\", an author would note later, \"but they did result in a few civilians moving away from military facilities\".[71]\n\n15 April\n\nVC Le Dua aka Le Van Dau was executed by firing squad at Da Nang stadium for the attempted bombing of the Grand Hotel.[72]\n\n16 April\n\nLife magazine published as its cover story the photo-essay \"One ride with Yankee Papa 13\" by Larry Burrows documenting a helicopter mission on 31 March.[73]\n\n17 April\n\nIn Washington, D.C. about 20,000 people gathered to protest the war organized by the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). This was the first large protest against the war in the United States.[74] At the same time, a counter-protest of about 100 people took place across the street, and a group of students representing the University of Wisconsin presented National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy with a petition of support for the war, signed by 6,000 faculty and students.[75]\n\nChina rescinded the order to the PLAAF to not attack American war planes violating Chinese air space. Over the next three years, 12 American war planes and several reconnaissance planes were shot down over China.[52]: 377\n\n20 April\n\nAt a meeting of American military and political leaders in Honolulu, Ambassador Taylor successfully proposed that the U.S. adopt what he called the \"enclave strategy\" in its conduct of the war. Defense Secretary McNamara and Assistant Secretary John McNaughton, CIA analyst William Bundy, General Westmoreland, U.S. Navy Admiral U. S. Grant Sharp Jr. and the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Earle Wheeler concurred in the proposal, which was adopted by President Johnson. Taylor's idea was to limit U.S. ground operations to within a 50 miles (80 km) radius of important areas in important coastal areas, and with the ARVN to conduct counter-insurgency operations in the surrounding territory. The strategy would prove unsuccessful, leading to Taylor's resignation and a switch to a \"search and destroy\" operation in June.[76] In a memo to the President the next day, McNamara described the military consensus that \"it would take more than six months, perhaps a year or two to...break the will of the DRV/VC [PAVN/VC] by denying them victory.\" On this date the U.S. had 33,000 U.S. military personnel in Vietnam and another 20,000 scheduled to be there.[77]: 212\n\n22 April\n\nDefense Secretary McNamara told reporters that he would not rule out the use of nuclear weapons in the war, as part of a press conference given under the condition that the reporters not attribute his remarks to him, nor quote him verbatim. Tom Wicker of The New York Times took notes and paraphrased the statement, in which McNamara said \"We are not following a strategy that recognizes any sanctuary or any weapons restriction. But we would use nuclear weapons only after fully applying non-nuclear arsenal. In other words, if 100 planes couldn't take out a target... we would try 200 planes, and so on. But 'inhibitions' on using nuclear weapons are not overwhelming.\" Wicker's report noted that \"High officials\" in the Johnson administration \"emphasize that it is 'inconceivable' that nuclear weapons would be used in the present circumstances of the war. They do not rule out the possibility that circumstances might arise in which nuclear weapons have to be used.\"[78] Nikolai T. Fedorenko, the Soviet Ambassador to the United Nations, sharply criticized McNamara and the U.S. in a speech the day after the report, commenting that \"See the statement made today by Mr. McNamara... The United States is not averse to utilizing — this time perhaps as tactical weapons - nuclear warheads against the people of an Asian country as they have done once before, covering themselves with indelible shame for centuries to come. Mr. McNamara clearly reserved the right to unleash nuclear war in Vietnam.\"[79]\n\nA Marine reconnaissance company was fired on by a VC unit, the Marines returned fire and killed one VC.[19]: 236\n\n23 April\n\nAmbassador Taylor reported to Washington that Prime Minister Quat was reluctant to accept the assignment of more U.S. soldiers to South Vietnam.[77]: 213\n\nUSAF Lieutenant Colonel James Robinson Risner commander of the 67th Tactical Fighter Squadron is featured on the cover of Time magazine. On 15 September Risner's F-105 was shot down over North Vietnam and he was captured and held as a prisoner of war until 12 February 1973.[80][81]\n\n28 April\n\nPresident Johnson met with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and noted that, according to U.S. intelligence reports, American protests against the war were part of a strategy of China, North Vietnam and the American members of the \"New Left\"; with the goal that \"intensified antiwar agitation in the United States would eventually create a traumatic domestic crisis leading to a complete breakdown in law and order\" and that \"U.S. troops would have to be withdrawn from Vietnam in order to restore domestic tranquility.\"[82]\n\nCompanies E and F, 2/3rd Marines participated in the first coordinated ground operation with ARVN forces.[19]: 236\n\n29 April\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Robert Menzies informed the Parliament in Canberra that he was sending the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) to fight in the war, at the request of the Premier of South Vietnam.[83] The day before, after the news of the government's plans had been published to the press, Menzies cabled the Australian Embassy in Saigon to stress the urgent need for South Vietnam to actually send a request, and during Thursday, Ambassador H. D. Anderson and his staff had to speak to the Vietnamese Premier, Phan Huy Quát, to ask him to invite Australia to enter the war. The cable from Premier Quát was not received by Menzies until 5:36 p.m. two and a half hours before Menzies was scheduled to speak to Parliament.[84]\n\nCaptain Charles Shelton was shot down and captured by the Pathet Lao. He would be listed as a prisoner of war by the United States Department of Defense until 20 September 1994 making him the last American classified as a prisoner from the war.[85]\n\n30 April\n\nThe CIA warned in a memorandum that the introduction of U.S. ground forces into Vietnam might result in \"constant danger that the war weary people of South Vietnam will let the U.S. assume an even greater share of the fighting.[46]: 150\n\nLate April\n\nThe U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Johnson lunched with Vietnam expert and author Bernard Fall in Washington. Johnson said that, \"As a result of my discussions with Dr. Fall, I conclude that I am the victim of appreciable misinformation concerning cliques, claques, and the variety of outlooks and objectives of the diverse elements that comprise the population of Vietnam.\"[86]\n\nIn his search for more reliable information about Vietnam, in June, Johnson appointed a team of military officers to develop \"new sources of action to be taken in South Vietnam by the United States and its allies, which, will, in conjunction with current actions, lead in due time to successful accomplishment of US aims and objectives.\" What came to be called \"A Program for the Pacification and Long-Term Development of South Vietnam\" (PROVN) would be completed on 1 March 1966.[87]\n\nMay\n\n[edit]\n\n3 May\n\nAn article in Newsweek magazine prompted the breaking of diplomatic relations by Cambodia with the United States. Prince Norodom Sihanouk cited a report about his mother, Queen Kossamak, that had accused her of involvement in \"various money-making schemes\".[88]\n\n4 May\n\nPresident Johnson requested an additional appropriation of $700 million for the war during the remainder of the fiscal year. The request was approved by Congress two days later. Johnson indicated that he might have to request additional funds.[89]\n\n5 May\n\nSoldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade arrived in South Vietnam. The brigade would be responsible for providing security to Bien Hoa Air Base and the port of Vung Tau, both near Saigon. This was the first combat unit from the U.S. Army to arrive in South Vietnam.[46]: 147, 151\n\nForty male students at the University of California in Berkeley stood in front of the city's draft board office and burned their draft cards, introducing what would become a common form of antiwar protest and a refusal to join the war effort. The 40 UC students were among hundreds who marched to the draft board after a noon rally on the Berkeley campus. \"While Berkeley police photographers snapped their photos,\" an Associated Press report noted, \"the students squatted in a huddle like a football team and placed their burning cards in a small pile\". Although future draft-card burnings would be made in opposition to the war, the initial protest was against the U.S. intervention in the Dominican Civil War.[90]\n\n6 May\n\nThe Armed Forces Council of South Vietnam under General Thiệu dissolved itself leaving in nominal control of the country the civilian Prime Minister Quat.[56]: 114\n\nIII Marine Expeditionary Force established its headquarters at Da Nang Air Base.[19]: 236\n\n7 May\n\nMarine forces land at Chu Lai to secure the area for construction of an air base.[19]: 236\n\n9 May - 1 June\n\nConstruction began on what would become the Chu Lai Air Base in South Vietnam, as a unit of the U.S. Naval Mobile Construction Battalion, NMCB-10, began the task of putting in the first combat zone \"Short Airfield for Tactical Support\" (SATS). The team would have a 4,000 feet (1,200 m) runway in place within 23 days and the first airplanes A-4 Skyhawks from VMA-225 and VMA-311 would land on 1 June and launched their first airstrike later that day.[19]: 33–4\n\n10–15 May\n\nIn the Battle of Song Be the VC overran the capital city of Phước Long Province, about 60 miles (97 km) north of Saigon. The town was recaptured by the ARVN with U.S. air support but the VC withdrew in good order and evaded pursuit by the ARVN.The battle resulted in 85 VC, 49 ARVN and five U.S. killed.[56]: 115\n\n13–18 May\n\nPresident Johnson halted the bombing of North Vietnam under Operation Rolling Thunder in an attempt to induce the North Vietnamese to negotiate a peace agreement. North Vietnam instead said the bombing halt was only \"an effort to camouflage American intensification of the war.\"[56]: 115\n\n16 May\n\nHo Chi Minh met with Chinese leader Mao Zedong in China. Ho said that North Vietnam would \"take the main burden of the war by themselves\" but requested additional Chinese economic and military support. Mao agreed and they set the ground rules for Chinese assistance: North Vietnamese would fight the war with Chinese logistical help, but the Chinese would not intervene militarily unless the United States invaded North Vietnam. Chinese assistance to North Vietnam took three forms: engineers and laborers to build and maintain defense works, airfields and roads, anti-aircraft personnel to defend North Vietnam from air attacks, and military equipment. The total number of Chinese stationed in North Vietnam and dedicated to these tasks was about 160,000 with the first tranche arriving in May 1965.[52]: 369–374\n\nTwenty-eight USAF airmen and eight RVNAF were killed in an accidental explosion at Bien Hoa Air Base. Thirteen airplanes were destroyed and 25 damaged.[56]: 115 [64]: 45\n\n17 May\n\nPresidential adviser and future Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford in a letter to President Johnson said, \"I believe our ground forces in South Vietnam should be kept to a minimum, consistent with the protection of our installations and property in that country ... This could be a quagmire. It could turn into an open end commitment on our part that would take more and more ground troops, without a realistic hope of ultimate victory.\"[91]\n\n20 May\n\nA few officers and around 40 civilians, predominantly Catholic, were arrested on charges of attempting to assassinate Quát and kidnap Kỳ among others. Several of the arrested were known supporters of Thảo and believed to be abetting him in evading the authorities.[8]: 338–44 [92]: 249\n\n23 May\n\nSenator Ernest Gruening called for an investigation into the situation in South Vietnam and for U.S. forces to be withdrawn.[93] Gruening and Wayne Morse were the only two senators to vote against the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.\n\n26 May\n\nEight hundred soldiers of 1 RAR departed Australia on HMAS Sydney to be deployed to Biên Hòa.[94][56]: 116\n\n27 May\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Keith Holyoake announced in Parliament that 120 troops from the 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery become the first of that nation's troops to be committed to the war. \"Nothing will give Australian soldiers more satisfaction than to be in company with troops from New Zealand\", Holyoake told the opening session of Parliament in Wellington.[95]\n\n28 May-1 June\n\nThe Battle of Ba Gia in Quảng Ngãi Province began when the VC 1st Regiment, 2nd Division ambushed the ARVN 1st Battalion, 51st Regiment 25th Division. The VC claim to have killed or wounded 915 ARVN and captured 270, while the ARVN claim to have lost 392 men and killed 556 VC. The battle highlighted the vulnerability of the ARVN as a military force against the flexible VC.[56]: 116\n\nLate May - 17 August\n\nThe PAVN besieged Đức Cơ Camp which was defended by the 5th Special Forces Group Detachment A-215 and Civilian Irregular Defense Group program (CIDG) forces. On 3 August a force of ARVN Paratroopers with Major Norman Schwarzkopf as senior military adviser was sent to relieve the camp. The paratroopers took heavy casualties and a second, larger force was required to relieve them. That force too came into heavy contact on 5 August. Schwarzkopf and his group fought continuously for several days. On 17 August additional ARVN forces supported by two battalions of the 173rd Airborne Brigade arrived and broke the siege.[96]\n\nJune\n\n[edit]\n\n5 June\n\nThe U.S. Navy began a permanent presence by one aircraft carrier at Dixie Station off the coast of South Vietnam.[97]: 152\n\n7 June\n\nGeneral Westmoreland reported to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the VC were stronger than ever and that ARVN was taking heavy casualties and suffering from a high rate of desertions and an unwillingness to take the offensive. Westmoreland said, \"I see no course of action open to us except to reinforce our efforts in SVN South Vietnam with additional U.S. or third country forces as rapidly as is practical.\" He identified U.S. units that could be assigned to South Vietnam that would bring U.S. military strength in the country up to 44 combat battalions.[39]: 440–2\n\n8 June\n\nA U.S. State Department spokesman, Robert J. McCloskey told a press conference \"more or less offhandedly\", that General Westmoreland had been given presidential authorization to commit American ground troops to combat in support of ARVN missions. McCloskey specifically said that \"I'm sure it's been made clear... that American forces would be available for combat support together with Vietnamese forces as and when necessary.\"[98] The White House issued a carefully worded denial the next day.[99]\n\n9–13 June\n\nIn the Battle of Đồng Xoài, in Phước Long Province about 60 miles (97 km) northeast of Saigon, the VC overran the district capital, then withdrew following air strikes and ARVN reinforcements brought in by U.S. helicopters. The battle resulted in 350+ VC, 416 ARVN and 7 U.S. killed and 12 missing.[56]: 118\n\n12 June\n\nSouth Vietnam's President Phan Khắc Sửu and Prime Minister Phan Huy Quát announced their resignations, less than eight months after they had formed a civilian government that worked within the oversight of the military leaders.[100] Major General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu was named as the President, chairing the \"Supreme Military Council\" and Vice Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ became Prime Minister.[101]\n\nGeneral Westmoreland asked the U.S. Department of Defense for increased authority to undertake offensive operations. He said, \"We have reached the point in Vietnam where we cannot avoid the commitment to combat of U.S. ground troops.\" The Pentagon endorsed Westmoreland's request for additional soldiers which would bring total U.S. military personnel in Vietnam up to 117,000, plus 20,000 third-country troops, by November 1.[39]: 445–6\n\n16 June\n\nSenator J. William Fulbright, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations said on national television that the U.S. should negotiate directly with North Vietnam and make \"major concessions\" to end the war. Fulbright's statement was criticized by prominent Republicans; former Vice President Nixon said that negotiations \"would be surrender on the installment plan\".[36]: 445–6\n\nSecretary of Defense McNamara announced that 22,000 additional troops were being sent to South Vietnam, while conceding that the war was going unfavorably for the U.S.[102]\n\n17 June\n\nCommander Louis Page and Lieutenant John Smith, of VF-21 operating from the USS Midway, scored the first U.S. Navy air kill of the war, shooting down a VPAF MiG-17 while flying an F-4B Phantom. In all, four MiGs were downed on that day by the U.S.[103]\n\n18 June\n\nUnder Secretary of State George Ball wrote a memo to President Johnson stating, \"Ever since 1961 - the beginning of our deep involvement in Vietnam - we have met successive disappointments. We have tended to underestimate the strength and staying power of the enemy. We have tended to overestimate the effectiveness of our sophisticated weapons under jungle conditions. We have watched the progressive loss of territory to Viet Cong control. We have been unable to bring about the creation of a stable political base in Saigon.\" Ball advised caution in expanding the U.S. military commitment to South Vietnam.[39]: 448–9\n\nUnder Operation Arc Light, B-52 aircraft were used for the first time in the Vietnam War. Flying out of Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, 27 B-52s dropped 750- and 1,000-pound bombs on a VC stronghold. Two B-52s were lost in a mid-air collision. An after-action survey found little evidence of VC casualties.[104]\n\n19 June\n\nAir Marshall Kỳ was appointed by the military junta as Prime Minister. With Thiệu as president and Kỳ as Prime Minister the revolving door of rulers that had prevailed in South Vietnam since the overthrow of Ngô Đình Diệm in November 1963 ended.\n\n20 June\n\nAfter being ambushed while in support of a rescue operation, A-1 Skyraider pilots Clinton Johnson and Charles Hartman shoot down a VPAF MiG-17 with their 20 mm M3 cannons. This is the first confirmed air-to-air gun kill of the war.\n\n22 June\n\nThe South Vietnamese publicly executed VC Tram Van Dong in Saigon for terrorism.[105]\n\n23 June\n\nThe Soviet Union rejected a proposal by British Prime Minister Harold Wilson to come to Moscow, along with the leaders of three other British Commonwealth states (the United Kingdom, Ghana, Nigeria, and Trinidad and Tobago), on a peace mission to end the war. Denying that the Soviet Union would have any influence over the Communist regime in North Vietnam, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin said that the U.S.S.R. \"has not been authorized by anybody to conduct talks on a settlement in Viet Nam and the Soviet Government does not intend to conduct such negotiations.\"[106]\n\n24 June\n\nGeneral Westmoreland advised Washington that he needed more soldiers than those previously approved and proposed that the U.S. bomb the railroad from North Vietnam to China, mine Haiphong harbor, and carry out B-52 strikes.[39]: 451–2\n\nIn retaliation for the execution of Tram Van Dong, the VC executed Sergeant Harold G. Bennett who had been captured on 29 December in the Battle of Binh Gia.[105]\n\n25 June\n\nThe VC planted two bombs in central Saigon, the first on the My Canh Café floating restaurant and second on a tobacco stall to injure the first responders. The two bombs killed 27 Vietnamese, 12 Americans, two Filipinos, one Frenchman, one German and wounded 80.[107]\n\n26 June\n\nGeneral Westmoreland was granted authority by the Department of Defense \"to commit U.S. ground forces anywhere in the country when, in his judgement, they were needed to strengthen South Vietnamese forces.\"[108]\n\n28–30 June\n\nA battalion of the 173rd Airborne Brigade undertook the first major U.S.-led search and destroy mission of the war. ARVN and Australian soldiers also participated in the sweep through part of War Zone D, about 40 miles (64 km) northeast of Saigon. The assault began with an artillery barrage; it located very few VC.[39]: 454 An observation of an Australian on the operation was: \"Our patrols do not fire off ammo or shoot up flares like the Yanks - they listen and move quietly, we haven't fired a shot or sent up a flare yet. The Americans think we are mad. It seems to me though, that all they're doing is letting the Viet Cong know where they are. I guess we have a bit to teach them.\" The Australians had experience in jungle warfare in the Malayan Emergency.[16]: 26–7\n\nJuly\n\n[edit]\n\n1 July\n\nUndersecretary of State Ball dissented from the buildup of American forces in South Vietnam. He wrote President Johnson that \"The Viet Cong - while supported and guided from the North - is largely an indigenous movement\" and that \"although we have emphasized its Cold War aspects, the conflict in South Vietnam is essentially a civil war within that country.\" Ball's view conflicted with the official view that the insurgency in South Vietnam had been created and was sustained by North Vietnam.[109]\n\nAustralia began training its first draftees for the war, bringing up the first of 63,790 conscripts who would have two years full-time service in the Australian Regular Army, followed by further service in the army reserves. In all, 804,286 young men who were 20 years old at the time that the draft reactivated, or turned 20 during the Vietnam era, registered for National Service.[110]\n\nA PAVN/VC mortar and sapper attack on Da Nang Air Base destroyed one F-102 and two C-130s and damaged a further two F-102s and one C-130.[19]: 56–7\n\nThe Special Landing Force comprising 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines and HMM-163 landed at Qui Nhơn to secure the area.

The allies claimed to have inflicted 100 VC casualties.[56]: 120\n\n7 July\n\nFormer Olympian Lieutenant Ronald Zinn commanding a platoon of B Company, 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment was killed in action in War Zone D.[113]\n\n8 July\n\nMaxwell Taylor resigned as U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam. Taylor had opposed the introduction of U.S. ground troops into South Vietnam, proposing instead an intensified air campaign against North Vietnam. Taylor would be replaced by Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., who returned to Saigon for his second stint as ambassador.[56]: 120 [36]: 395\n\nThe Vietnam Service Medal was established by Executive Order 11231 for all members of the armed services who served in the Vietnam War.[114]\n\n9 July\n\nThe VC attacked the Junk Force base on Ky Hoa Island, Marine units were sent to help repel the assault. 16 Junk Force sailors and two U.S. Navy advisers were killed in the initial attack and three Marines were killed in clearing the VC.[3]: 129\n\n10 July\n\nThe New York Times reported that the 173rd Airborne suffered 10 killed and 42 wounded on its sweep through War Zone D, and that its estimates of VC casualties were inflated. The newspaper reported that the U.S. had begun \"to accept aerial estimates of enemy casualties. The command has also begun to calculate probable damage inflicted on the Viet Cong despite the absence of bodies or weapons.\"[39]: 454–5\n\nTwo USAF F-4C Phantom fighters of the 45th Tactical Fighter Squadron shot down two VPAF MiG-17 fighters, scoring the first confirmed USAF jet victories of the war.[115]\n\n12 July\n\nThe 2nd Brigade of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division began to arrive in South Vietnam. The brigade was initially responsible for providing security for Bien Hoa Air Base.[16]: 33–4\n\n13 July\n\nU.S. Army Sergeant First Class Isaac Camancho became the first U.S. prisoner of war to successfully escape from a VC prison camp. Four days earlier, Camancho had managed to pry loose a bar on a bamboo cage where he had been kept at night, after having been captured 19 months earlier on 24 November 1963.[116]\n\n15 July\n\nThe first New Zealand Army combat unit, 161 Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery arrived at Bien Hoa Air Base.[117]: 88\n\n16 July\n\nSecretary of Defense McNamara, visiting South Vietnam, was briefed by General Westmoreland who said that U.S. airstrikes had not succeeded in halting the flow of military supplies down the Ho Chi Minh trail. To defeat the VC, now reinforced by the PAVN, would require another large influx of U.S. soldiers amounting to 57 battalions plus helicopter companies and support units. Westmoreland said he planned to reverse the deteriorating military situation by the end of 1965, take the offensive in 1966, and destroy the VC and capture their strongholds by the end of 1967.[77]: 220–1\n\nThree months after a commitment by China's President Liu Shaoqi to provide Chinese pilots to fight in North Vietnam, the Chinese General Staff notified North Vietnam's Defense Ministry that \"the time was not appropriate\" to supply the assistance.[118]\n\nThao was reported dead in unclear circumstances;[29]: 497 an official report claimed that he died of injuries while on a helicopter en route to Saigon, after being captured north of the city. However, it is generally assumed that he was murdered or tortured to death on the orders of some military officials.[8]: 338–44 [92]: 249\n\n20 July\n\nMcNamara returned to Washington and recommended to President Johnson that the number of U.S. troops in South Vietnam be increased to 175,000. He recommended also that 235,000 soldiers in the Reserve and National Guard be activated and that the number of U.S. military personnel be increased by 375,000 and that air strikes against North Vietnam be increased from 2,500 to 4,000 per month.[77]: 221\n\nOn the 11th anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords ending the First Indochina War, Ho Chi Minh said that the North Vietnamese and the VC will fight for 20 years or more to achieve victory and unification of the two Vietnams.[56]: 121\n\nPolice in Saigon foiled a plot to assassinate outgoing U.S. Ambassador Taylor, 15 minutes before he was scheduled to enter a stadium for South Vietnam's \"National Unity Day for the Liberation of North Viet Nam\" rally. VC members had placed a shrapnel-loaded bomb at a cemetery across the street from the entrance that Taylor was to use.[119]\n\n20–1 July\n\nTwo VC battalions attacked Bù Đốp Camp. At daybreak three CIDG companies arrived from Camp Bù Gia Mập securing the camp. VC losses were 161 killed.[120][121]\n\n21 July\n\nPresident Johnson convened his advisers in a meeting of the 15 member National Security Council at the White House, prior to making a decision about the direction that the United States should take in fighting the war. During the morning session, George Ball, the United States Under Secretary of State strongly argued against the recommendation by Secretary of Defense McNamara to increase the number of American troops in South Vietnam. According to minutes of that day's meeting that would be released years later, Ball urged that the U.S. should \"cut its losses\" and allow the South Vietnamese government to \"do what seems natural to it, let it fall apart\" and, with the rest of the advisers against him, closed with the prophetic statement that South Vietnam would ultimately lose to the VC guerrillas, regardless of McNamara's plans to commit 175,000 additional troops, that the U.S. would not get out with a victory, and that \"we'll double our bet and get lost in the rice paddies.\"[122] In the course of the discussion, General Wallace M. Greene Jr. estimated that winning the war would take 5 years and 500,000 American soldiers. He said that he believed the American people would back such a commitment. Johnson was skeptical that Americans would support such a large commitment and opted instead for a gradual buildup of American forces and escalation of the war as recommended by General Westmoreland.[3]: 132\n\n24 July\n\nA USAF F-4C Phantom #63-7599 was shot down by a North Vietnamese SAM-2 45 miles (72 km) northeast of Hanoi, in the first loss of a US aircraft to a North Vietnamese SAM.[123]: 163–4 The pilot, Captain Richard P. Keirn ejected successfully from his stricken aircraft and was captured. His bombardier/navigator Captain Roscoe H. Fobair failed to eject and was killed, his remains were recovered in 2001.[124] 24 July would be celebrated in North Vietnam as \"Missile Day\".[59]: 167\n\n27 July\n\nIn a meeting with President Johnson most Congressional leaders of both parties agreed with his plan to increase U.S. military forces in South Vietnam. The exception was Senator Mike Mansfield, while publicly supporting the President said at the meeting, said, \"we are going deeper into a war in which even a total victory would, in the end, be a loss to the nation\". Mansfield proposed negotiations to end the war.[36]: 455–7\n\nU.S. aircraft struck a surface-to-air missile installation for the first time, attacking an SA-2 site at Suối Hai, Hà Tây Province, North Vietnam. Operation Spring High took off with 46 F-105 fighter-bombers and 58 other supporting aircraft to bomb the sites, losing six planes in the process and destroying only one of the two targets, designated as \"Site 6\". Afterward, \"bomb damage assessment photos disclosed that there was a dummy missile in Site 6, placed there as a trap, and that Site 7 was empty.\"[123]: 164–5 [97]: 153 [59]: 167\n\n28 July\n\nIn a nationally televised speech, President Johnson announced his decision to send an additional 50,000 U.S. troops to South Vietnam, increasing the number of personnel there by two-thirds and to bring the commitment to 125,000. Johnson also said that the monthly draft call would more than double, to more than 1,000 new young men per day (from 17,000 to 35,000) for enlistment and training in the U.S. Armed Forces, but he declined to activate the Reserve and National Guard.[125] Johnson timed the speech for the noon hour in Washington, when there were fewer television viewers.[77]: 22 [36]: 458\n\n29 July\n\nThe 1st Brigade of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division arrived at Cam Ranh Bay and set up its base camp there.[19]: 237\n\nAugust\n\n[edit]\n\nSixty-one percent of Americans responded \"no\" to the following question by the Gallup Poll, \"Do you think the U.S. made a mistake sending troops to fight in Vietnam?\"[126]\n\n1 August\n\nGeneral Lo Jui-ching, the Chief of Joint Staff of the armed forces of the People's Republic of China, declared on Radio Peking that the Chinese were ready to fight the United States again, as they had in the Korean War. Comparing Johnson to Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Hideki Tojo, General Lo said of the Americans that \"If they lose all sense of reality in their lust for gain and persist in underestimating the strength and determination of the Chinese people, impose a war on us, and compel us to accept the challenge, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, long well prepared and standing in battle array, not only will stay with you without fail to the end, but invite you to come in large numbers, the more the better.[127]\n\n3 August\n\nAfter coming under VC sniper fire, U.S. Marines burned down the South Vietnamese village of Cam Ne, \"using flame throwers, cigarette lighters and bulldozers\" to set fire to 150 houses made up of straw, thatch, and bamboo and bulldozing homes made of sturdier materials.[128] Major General Lewis W. Walt, the commander of the 3rd Marine Division, said in a statement that \"the civilians had been urged in advance by helicopter loudspeakers to go to open fields where they would be safe\" before their homes were burned down.[129] The Marines were accompanied by CBS reporter Morley Safer and a cameraman, and while the newspaper reports of the deliberate destruction of homes had little impact, American TV viewers were shocked when they saw film of the attack on the CBS Evening News, and President Johnson was infuriated by the CBS decision to show the war in an unfavorable light.[19]: 64\n\n3–17 August\n\nĐức Cơ Camp, 45 kilometres (28 mi) southwest of Pleiku had been under siege by the VC since late May. On 8 August the South Vietnamese Marines Task Force Alpha and an ARVN armored task force departed Pleiku on 8 August to relieve the garrison. On 9 August they came into heavy contact with a PAVN battalion dug in astride Route 19. The South Vietnamese attacked and dislodged the PAVN, only to have the rear of the column attacked by another reinforced PAVN battalion. Battered by air strikes all night long, the PAVN 32nd Regiment, launched a final attack at dawn and then withdrew from the battlefield. On 10 August the South Vietnamese moved into Đức Cơ and broke the siege. The South Vietnamese infantry, with the support of U.S. and RVNAF air strikes, claimed to have killed over 400 PAVN and captured 71 weapons. VNMC losses were 28 killed and 3 missing.[19]: 206 General Westmoreland sent the 173rd Airborne Brigade to Pleiku and the brigade opened the highway from Pleiku to Duc Co.[16]: 30–1\n\n5 August\n\nThe VC attacked the Esso petroleum storage facility in Liên Chiểu District near Da Nang, destroying 40 percent of the facility and almost 2 million gallons of fuel.[56]: 124\n\nFormer General and Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, now an adviser to President Johnson, told the President: \"By the end of 1965, the North Vietnamese offensive will be bloodied and defeated without having achieved major gains.\" North Vietnam would be forced to change its strategy.[36]: 464\n\nGerald R. Ford, a Congressman from Michigan and the leader of the Republican minority in the House of Representatives, urged President Johnson to ask Congress to declare war on North Vietnam, so that the increasing commitment of American servicemen could be debated. \"It would be the honest thing to do under the circumstances, considering our present commitment.\"[130]\n\n6 August\n\nAfter its pilots ejected safely, a battle-damaged USAF B-57 bomber and its payload of 16 armed 250-pound bombs crashed in a residential area of Nha Trang, killing at least 12 people and injuring 75 others.[131]\n\n12 August\n\nThe North Vietnamese revealed that they had mobile SAM-2 units that could be taken to any location, shooting down a U.S. Navy A-4 Skyhawk flying 50 miles (80 km) southwest of Hanoi. Lieutenant (j.g.) Donald H. Brown Jr. operating from the USS Coral Sea was killed in the crash, becoming the first U.S. Navy flier to be downed by a SAM missile.[132]\n\n15 August\n\nThe VC attacked the National Police headquarters in Saigon killing two guards and exploding a bomb in the building before making their escape.[133] The VC claim to have killed 165 police in the attack.[59]: 161\n\n18–24 August\n\nOperation Starlite was the first offensive military action conducted by the U.S. Marines during the war and the first purely American operation. Lieutenant General Lewis W. Walt with 5,500 Marines launched a preemptive strike against 1,500 VC to nullify a threat on the Chu Lai base, 60 miles (97 km) south of Da Nang. The operation resulted in 614 VC killed and 42 captured and 45 Marines killed.[19]: 79–80 General William E. DePuy at a later briefing said that the VC \"maneuvered in the jungle, maintained tactical integrity, withdrew their wounded, lost practically no weapons, and did a first class job\" and that \"we'd be proud of American troops...who did as well.\"[77]: 234\n\n22 August to 2 October\n\nOperation Highland was a clearing operation around An Khê conducted by the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division to secure the area for the arrival of the 1st Cavalry Division.
