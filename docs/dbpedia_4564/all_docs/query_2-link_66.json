        "text": "Chapter Text\n\n15\n\nDraco could not physically imagine how he was going to - as the young people put it - deal - when he got in, and he didn't have to.\n\nHe had nodded at Blaise, got changed into white night shirt and trousers, thrown on a Malfoy robe, sat on his bed, shoulders slumped and ignored the others. Honestly, he had had no patience now with the creature or experience that was Harry taking up his time to be their leader, he should have put more effort in on that front, it would have been advantageous, not just because Blaise thought so, another thing not done, a self-imposed expectation not met-\n\nWhen the alarm sounded.\n\nWell, it wasn't an actual alarm. It never was. It was just that slowly, panic started happening, sounding further away, then closer and closer. Someone left, someone consulted another, someone went to a window, others burst in-\n\n“Death Eaters have breached the castle! Our Lord is amongst the loyal!”\n\nThen the catastrophe that Draco had always given possibility to was upon them. It was a Slytherin thing.\n\nDraco and Balise sat motionless for a split second that they both knew was stretching and both knew that the other was thinking was stretching.\n\nThen they rather pleasantly retrieved their wands, bowed to each other, and got up.\n\nDraco wished he hadn't gotten changed. He didn't want to fight in pj's and in slippers but when the fight was upon you-\n\n“Draco, what should we do?!” Goyle asked, amid crashing and commotion outside.\n\n“Men, the fight is upon us. And there will be a good chance you will end up dead. So fight, be the hero of your story, and try and win favour with the Gods!”\n\n“But-”\n\n“And most importantly, keep out of my fucking way!”\n\nDraco all but bodily hurled someone out of his path. Ok. He shouldn't have enjoyed that. His blood was coursing through his veins, both poison and elixir.\n\nAntonio Dolohov was stationed outside Slytherin-\n\n“Avada kedarva!” Draco said commandingly, before the fool could even get his wits about him. Hmph. Served him right. He felt a stilling behind him from whoever had followed him out. Were they all surprised to see which side he killed? That he killed at all?\n\nHe progressed round a few corridors. There was chaos. Pupils were running around and some were crying. Truly pathetic. There seemed to be some fires occurring. There was Evan Rosier advancing on someone-\n\n“Avada kedarva!” Draco shouted with relish. The man crumpled like a hessian sack of potatoes. The Ravenclaws he had saved cowered away from him for some reason. He shrugged. Morons. He pressed on.\n\nDraco didn't really have a horse in this race…anymore. Well, it was complicated, damn it! He had an overall exit plan; to be reunited somewhere comfortable enough with his mother and make himself useful to the Potter - NO - Not Voldermort - side.\n\nAs for now, either this was the end if Hogwarts for the time being, or it wasn't. Either way, he had to survive and see what would happen.\n\nSomewhere further behind him Blaise was trying out bizarre curses on Death Eaters. Right on.\n\nThey might have been able to retain him as a recruit if they hadn't been so overbearing with their ideology, Draco reasoned to himself. He was still a staunch conservative-\n\nThorfinn Rowle was coming down the stairs, holding a boy by the scruff of his neck.\n\n“Malfoy! your father-”\n\n“Avada kedarva!” Draco shouted, and he assumed that the boy may have incurred some injuries as the man above him dropped dead and fell on him.\n\nThis was good! Three for three. No hits. This was like hunting people in the maze at Malfoy manner. Draco always won.\n\n“Crucio!” Augustus Rookwood shouted at him. Draco narrowly avoided it.\n\n“You cunt!” Draco screamed. He dropped back and caught his breath.\n\n“Sectumsempra!” Draco retaliated, and the man ribboned. Yeesh. Is that how he'd looked to-\n\n“Sectumpsempra!” He screamed again and the next Death Eater he saw. The Death Eater did that flying smoke spell and went out of the window like a brick on fire. Draco almost had a hang of that spell…\n\nStudents ran like headless chickens in all directions. Didn't they want a chance at survival? Or at least to die well?\n\nDraco’s culture favoured martyrdom and glory in death. This was how the children were brought up-\n\nDraco did not want to dwell on the dead first years on the floor. He swallowed, regripped his wand. But there was a faint crying close by…how could the dead cry?\n\nThey'd find a way, Draco thought grimly. Badness had no bottom.\n\nThere was a little dark-haired boy sat against a wall with his knees drawn up and his hands on his ears. He cowered at the sight of Draco, so frightened.\n\n“I'm not going to hurt you,” Draco said with authority. “Take my hand.”\n\nThe boy did in a daze, and Draco led him to the closest classroom and closed the door. Checking they had not been followed. The corridor with the dead was quiet, for now. Draco pulled the boy to the supply cupboard, opened the door. They went inside and closed the door behind them. The boy was whimpering. Draco pushed him to the back of the closet.\n\n“We mustn’t interrupt anything, we must make it seem untouched. Let's see, revelio.”\n\nA smaller cupboard opened in the dark panelling at the back of the cupboard. He pushed the terrified boy inside the space.\n\n“Stay here until it's over.”\n\nDraco turned away from him.\n\n“Wait! I'm…scared.”\n\n“Of no relevance.”\n\n“I am!”\n\n“Better than death.”\n\nThe boy sobered.\n\n“But people say you're really mean.”\n\nDraco shrugged. “They're right.”\n\nHe left.\n\nTwo flights up he ran into Blaise again, who only looked slightly ruffled.\n\n“I've had a chance to try the eyeball removing curse.” It was the most excited Blaise had ever sounded, but he still didn't sound that excited. “They seem to cauterise, straight out, no blood.”\n\nDraco nodded. A death eater rounded on them. Blaise raised his wand but Draco was faster, “Avada kedarva!”\n\nBlaise looked at him. Draco shrugged. “It's easier.”\n\nIn truth, every time Draco killed a death eater, he fantasises about how much it would aggrieve his father.\n\nDraco assessed his options. He could go the same way as the boy, find somewhere nice to hide, try and stay alive. The disadvantages to that were that if death eaters took the castle, he'd be found and killed like a dog - a big no no. And not a martyr's end. Hmm. If he joined a larger battle, because there was a larger battle, a axis, somewhere, there may be a higher chance of getting killed, but he'd know whether it was time to leave Hogwarts or not, information he could not get anywhere else. Right, well that was that then.\n\n“My friend, I'm going to go and-”\n\n“-find Harry.”\n\nDraco balked. “What?! No! I'm going to go and fight or die like a martyr, and to assess our position. Coming?”\n\nBlaise nodded.\n\n“Do we know where we're going?” Blaise asked over shouting further ahead.\n\n“We do not.”\n\n“He'll be at the centre.”\n\n“Unfortunately,” Draco growled.\n\nThey came upon about a hundred students of all different ages. Draco sent sparks into the air and Blaise a very loud horn charm. Everyone stopped to look at them.\n\n“Potter? Dumbledore?” Blaise asked.\n\nPeople shook their heads and shifted around, some lost interest, many disliked them.\n\n“Come on, someone must have seen something!”\n\n“Most of the Death Eaters headed for the astonomy tower!” A Ravenclaw girl told them in a scared voice.\n\nA look passed between Draco and Blaise and they headed that way without a further word. Blaise seemed a little out of breath.\n\nA Death Eater was chasing some children down a corridor.\n\n“Occudeletris!” Blaise shouted.\n\nDraco didn’t want to examine someone who had just lost their eyeballs too closely at the moment.\n\n“Come on,” He said. “Let’s lie low.”\n\nIt was quiet as they approached the astronomy tower. Too quiet. Draco and Blaise creeped up the stairs till they were almost on the lower deck. That’s when his heart sank because, damn it, he recognised the shoes straight away.\n\nThere was Harry, standing on the lower deck, looking up at the confrontations and conundrums going on.\n\nAs Draco and Blaise rose, all their eyes met at the same time.\n\nHarry’s face was open and on it Draco could read shock, anger, surprise and fear. Harry’s eyes flitted to the scene above them and then back to Draco and Blaise. Harry put his finger to his lips and carried on standing, sick and frozen.\n\nDraco considered his options, and then went up.\n\n“Ah, Draco, you’re here,” Bellatrix said.\n\nHarry hated hearing her voice and wildly considered whether Draco had been on their side all along.\n\n“Avada kedarva!” Draco suddenly said to his aunt, but unlike the other times he had used the spell, he had too much anxiety, and the spell didn’t stick, but stunned her.\n\nDumbledore beheld him sharply.\n\n“So keen to take a life Draco?”\n\n“Keen to save yours,” Draco retorted.\n\n“Not so long ago, you were trying to kill me.”\n\nDraco hesitated, a ball of adrenaline as his stunned aunt could be roused at any moment. The other Death Eaters weren’t sure what to do. They weren’t sure of Draco’s standing and what this was between him and his aunt, whether it was internal or indicative of Draco’s wider position. Besides, they had no love for Bellatrix, her cruelty, or her top spot with The Dark Lord. Still, it was like they were waiting for something.\n\n“Something changed me,” Draco finally said, looking Dumbledore in the eyes, and it that moment he knew Dumbledore knew.\n\n“Yes,” Dumbledore said softly.\n\nSnape showed up.\n\nHe surveyed Bellatrix, now twitching and rousing, and then his eyes hardened on Draco.\n\nGo below deck. Do not come up.\n\nDraco frowned.\n\nNOW!\n\nDraco knew it was Severus’ magic that in part pushed him down to where Harry and Blaise were.\n\nHe caught Harry’s eyes and he was looking at him with such betrayal. Draco rolled his eyes. If Harry didn’t like killing, this was going to be a long war indeed.\n\n“Ah Severus,” Albus said, but Severus just looked at him in an unreadable, stormy way.\n\n“Avada kedarva!” Severus bellowed.\n\nThen Dubmledore was falling, Bellatrix was screeching and the Death Eaters were fleeing.\n\n“He’s dead! He’s dead! Dumbledore is dead!” Bellatrix was laughing. No doubt she was still furious over her nephew trying to kill her but Dumbledore’s death was a big win.\n\nDraco was shocked then, not quite sure what had happened, and looked at Harry. All the colour had drained from Harry's face. He looked like a ghost, and so hurt, Draco felt embarrassed. No one ever wanted to see someone look like that.\n\nBlaise watched, terrified. This might be Potter's world but action wasn't really his forte. He could sense that there was an energy between Draco and Potter - God help them all.\n\nAs Bellatrix, Severus and the other Death Eaters went to leave, Harry tore after them. Draco couldn't even believe that Harry had the strength, but Harry was always good at mustering up last minute burst of energy."
