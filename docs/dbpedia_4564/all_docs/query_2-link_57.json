        "text": "Marine Corps Capt. Earl Ehrhart never shot down five or more Houthi drones according to the U.S. Navy, but the media indicated that he did.\n\nEhrhart’s story has its origins in a BBC piece that first ran on February 12. In it, a BBC correspondent said that Ehrhart had shot down seven Houthi drones while flying an AV-8B Harrier from the USS Bataan, a Wasp-class amphibious assault ship - basically a light aircraft carrier.\n\nThe BBC’s correspondent was embarked on Bataan while it was in the eastern Mediterranean (where it remains) sometime in mid-January after it had returned from the Red Sea. Earlier in the month, the ship had participated in air strikes launched by the U.S. and UK against Houthi targets in Yemen according to the article.\n\nSeeking to learn more about the nature of the drone engagements that Capt. Ehrhart and his squadron, VMA-231, had flown in, I emailed the Marine Harrier pilot directly on the Bataan where he is embarked as a part of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) on February 15.\n\nOn the 20th, I received a call from Italy from the U.S. Navy’s Sixth Fleet. Sixth Fleet public affairs had called to respond to the questions I had put to Capt. Ehrhart.\n\nOn-background, I was told that neither Ehrhart nor any other Harrier pilot from the VMA-231 detachment aboard Bataan had shot down any Houthi drones. Nor had they made any Houthi drone intercepts.\n\nAccording to the Navy, the BBC had gotten it wrong, using language that implied that Houthi drones had been shot down.\n\nThe Navy (presumably Sixth Fleet), and or U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), subsequently requested that the BBC change the language in the article. There appears to have been no formal correction by the BBC.\n\nThe initial version of the BBC’s article, entitled, The fighter pilots hunting Houthi drones over the Red Sea, was widely picked up and repeated in global media with articles stating the Capt. Ehrhart was the first American ace since the Vietnam War, albeit a new kind of ace - one who shot down unmanned aircraft.\n\nAs noted above, the Navy says that didn’t happen. The Bataan’s Harriers had not even intercepted Houthi drones according to Sixth Fleet. Why then, did the BBC correspondent initially report that Capt. Ehrhart had shot down seven drones? I asked the BBC.\n\nIn an emailed reply, Lala Najafova, senior communications specialist for BBC World Service Group Communications told me that the BBC’s report was, “amended on the same day [as published], with changes resulting in references mostly to drones being ‘intercepted’ rather than ‘shot down.”\n\n“The quote by the flight lead, Capt Earl Ehrhart, was taken from the interview recorded with him and implies that they used Harriers in their interception operations,” Najafova said.\n\nThat direct quote and others from Ehrhart remain in the revised version still online. At best they confuse the issue. At worst they contradict what the Navy now says. An excerpt from the article reads;\n\nTo be effective against this rebel group, the marines needed to adapt. “We took a Harrier jet and modified it for air defence,” Ehrhart tells me. “We loaded it up with missiles and that way were able to respond to their drone attacks.\"\n\nThis certainly sounds like preparation to make the squadron’s Harriers part of the layered air defense that U.S. ships in the Red Sea have been relying on. By “loading it up with missiles” Ehrhart presumably meant placing a full compliment of AIM-9L/M Sidewinder air to air missiles on the jet’s six underwing weapons stores pylons.\n\nMarine Corps AV-8Bs can also carry longer range AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) which may be better able to track small drones. But employing these against relatively cheap, unsophisticated Houthi drones seems less likely.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the Harriers can be equipped with a GAU-12 25mm gun pod, potentially an effective close-range (and cheap) weapon for knocking down drones. The Harrier is also capable of flying at the slow speeds (around 115 mph) that drones including Iranian-designed Shahed-136s used by the Houthis fly at as noted by an article in The War Zone.\n\nEhrhart, however, did not mention any gun. But he is further quoted in the article which currently reads;\n\nAn experienced fighter pilot, Ehrhart says he has intercepted seven Houthi drones. But when flying so close to these explosive devices, he says, every interception carries great risk. “They are shooting at us all the time, so we need to be even more focused. Our systems need to be primed so we can stay safe.”\n\nThe BBC author’s paraphrasing here is obvious. Ehrhart intercepted seven drones. This may be where the correspondent initially indicated that the Harrier pilot had “shot down” seven drones. Ehrhart’s comment was taken from an in-person interview according to the BBC spokesperson.\n\nWhether one uses the terms “shot-down” or “intercepted”, the article and the direct quotes from Capt. Ehrhart remain at odds with what I was told on background. As such, I followed up with Sixth Fleet with a series of emailed questions.\n\nThe Command declined to provide on-the-record answers to several of the questions including definitively explaining whether Capt. Ehrhart or any other VMA-231 pilot had shot down or intercepted Houthi drones. I was told other questions I had asked could possibly be answered but no responses were forthcoming as this article went to publication.\n\nI also reached out to CENTCOM for answers to the above and to additional questions. Again, no answers were provided by publication time. If and when either provides responses, I’ll update this article.\n\nThe lack of forthright responses from the Navy and CENTCOM and to a lesser extent the BBC, makes it difficult to determine what the truth is here. Is Capt. Ehrhart the first American ace since the Vietnam War? My guess is no. But it’s only a guess.\n\nEhrhart’s reported comments indicate he and other Harrier pilots were intercepting drones at close range to their aircraft at some point, somewhere despite the Navy’s background assertion to the contrary. There have been reports of U.S. Navy aircraft downing Houthi drones since the Israel-Hamas War began last October.\n\nThe BBC’s initial reporting that the Harrier pilot had shot down seven Houthi drones spread rapid-fire, blowing the story (and the narrative) up whatever the truth may be. It illustrates a pair of all-too-common problems - a global media hungry for sensational reporting and an American military whose transparency is increasingly in question."
