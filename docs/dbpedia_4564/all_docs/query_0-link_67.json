        "text": "Photo above from 7/15/66 shows the crash that killed two men from the Fulton/Montgomery County area of upstate New York just west of Albany, SGT Robert R. Telfer (Fonda, NY) and CPL Orsen H. Case (Johnstown, NY). Thanks to Gus Kappler for the info.\n\nOne out of every ten Americans who served in Vietnam became a casualty. As a result, 58,169 were killed and 304,000 wounded out of 2.29 million who served. Although the percent of dead is similar to other wars, amputations or crippling wounds were 300% higher than in World War II. 75,000 Vietnam Veterans are severely disabled.\n\nMEDEVAC helicopters flew nearly 500,000 missions, airlifting 900,000 patients (nearly one-half were Americans). The average lapse between being wounded and reaching a hospital was less than one hour, and as a result, less than one percent of those wounded died of their wounds within the first 24 hours.\n\nThe helicopter provided unprecedented mobility. Without helicopters, it would have taken three times as many troops to secure the 800 mile border with Cambodia and Laos (the politicians thought the Geneva Conventions of 1954 and the Geneva Accords of 1962 would secure the border).\n\nArmy Huey’s totaled 9,713,762 flight hours in Vietnam between October 1966 and the end of American involvement in early 1973. Cobra helicopters totaled 1,110,716 flight hours in Vietnam. This is also the main reason that soldiers in Vietnam saw more action than those soldiers of preceding wars. Large groups of soldiers could be air-lifted into a battle and then be withdrawn after a few hours and flown to another area to reinforce other units or to engage the enemy again in a different portion of the country.\n\nThe chart below is not all inclusive but includes most of the helicopter units that served during the Vietnam War. Where it is known, I’ve indicated their unit name / call sign, and a sample of nose art or unit patch for those units. I did post another article on this website a while ago that includes hundreds of photos of nose art used by these crews in-county. I’ll leave a link at the end of this article in the event you want to check it out.\n\nIf I’ve erred on the chart below, please let me know so I can make corrections. Also, I invite you to get back to me on any missing units, call signs or duplicates. I am aware that many of the units mentioned herein had multiple call signs and nose art – I’m just limited to the available space I can’t show them all in this format..\n\nCIVILIAN HELICOPTER UNITS UNIT UNIT CALL SIGN Air America U.S. ARMY HELICOPTER UNITS\n\nAmerical Division\n\nSouthern Cross B Co. 123rd Avn.

This was especially true in the Mekong Delta (IV Corps) where no U.S. ground forces remain. However, there still remained a requirement for ongoing non-combat aviation support to ARVN military units, regional/provincial militia (Ruff-Puffs), MACV advisers, VIP transportation and non-combat classified missions. On 1 June 1971 the 18 th Corps\n\nAviation Company was formed at Can Tho Army Airfield in IV Corps, Republic of South Vietnam.\n\nWhen aviation units deactivated, portions of their assets and personnel were transferred to the 18 th CAC. Since the CAC was still evolving, the first couple of months was organized chaos. When the dust settled, aviation wise, the CAC wound up with four flight platoons and one VIP flight detachment. There were 30 UH-1H Hueys divided into two flight platoons of 10 aircraft each, one VIP detachment of\n\n8 Hueys, one commanders aircraft and one maintenance aircraft. The Huey’s callsign was “Green Delta”. The maintenance aircraft callsign was “Short Shaft”.\n\nThere was a platoon of 12 OH-58 Kiowas, call sign “Bartenders” and a heavy-lift platoon of 12 CH-47C Chinooks, call sign “Hillclimbers”. There were two maintenance platoons, one for single rotor aircraft (UH-1’s and OH-58’s) and one for the CH-47’s, each with their own hanger and maintenance personnel. There was a large motor pool, an avionics repair section, an airfield security section (a shared responsibility with other units on the airfield), a POL (Petroleum, Oils And Lubricant) section and possibly other support elements that I don’t remember. All\n\ntold there were over 500 officers and enlisted assigned to the 18 th CAC. The first commander of this massive organization was Major Douglas Thorpe.\n\nOn 6 June 1972 there was a change-of-command. Major Jerry Childers became he new commander and remained until the unit stand-down on 13 March 1973. At 0800 hrs. 28 January 1973 the long-awaited cease fire became effective. Therefore, the war was officially over. However, someone forgot to tell our former enemies, the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and the local Viet Cong (VC).\n\nAt 0945 hrs. a pilot, WO1 Anthony Del Pazzo, from the 18 th CAC, flying a marked Joint Military Command (JMC) UH-1 on approach to Can Tho Army Airfield, was killed when the aircraft was hit by small arms fire. WO1 Pazzo was the last Army pilot killed in Vietnam. On 16 February 1973 a CH-47 from the 18 th CAC, also marked as a JMC aircraft, on a supply mission for the peacekeeping forces had\n\njust delivered building materials to a joint NVA/VC compound near Song Be in Binh Long Province – north-west of Saigon. On departure, at about 300 feet AGL, the\n\naircraft was strafed by heavy small arms fire, setting the aircraft of fire. The aircraft crash landed in flames. Flight Engineer SP5 James L Scoggins was severely burned in the crash and died 7 days later from complications relating to\n\nhis injuries. SP5 Scoggins was the last Army aircrewman to die in Vietnam before the final combat troop withdrawal which occurred on 28 March 1973.\n\nThe 18 th Corps Aviation Company was to be short-lived. On 27 February 1973 the 18 th CAC received orders to stand-down and prepare to transfer all assets to the\n\nVNAF. In the final days, some of the personnel were transferred to other units remaining in country and many were rotated back to the states. A skeleton crew\n\nremained to facilitate the transfer. The draw-down was completed on 13 March 1973. All of the assets were left in place: aircraft, motor pool, weapons, tools and shop equipment – everything, including pilot and crew flight helmets. The remaining personnel moved off base to facilities in Can Tho. On 14 March 1973 the VNAF\n\ntook over the facility. The colors (unit flag) for the 18 th CAC were folded and transferred to Ft. Bragg, NC.\n\nGreen Delta\n\n18th CAC Aircraft Recovery Team\n\nCH-47 Hillclimbers\n\nGreen Delta Typical Flight Platoon\n\nUH-1 Maintenance Platoon\n\nUH-1 Flight VIP Platoon\n\n25th Combat Assault Company Red Carpet 25th Aviation Battalion Little Bears and Diamondheads 31st Transportation (CH-34) Company and 138th Transportation Detachment 48th Assault Helicopter Company Bluestars and Jokers 52nd and 119th Camp Holloway Dragons 52nd Combat Aviation +Battalion Flying Dragons 57th Assault Helicopter Company Gladiators and Cougar 57th Medical Company Dustoff 59th Combat Assault Company Red Cloud 60th Assault Helicopter Company Ghost Riders 61st Assault Helicopter Company Lucky Stars and Star Blazers 62nd Corps Aviation Company Royal Coachman 62nd Assault Helicopter Company Outlaws &Mavericks 68th Assault Helicopter Company Top Tigers, Mustangs & Raiders 71st Assault Helicopter Company Rattler and Firebirds 82nd Medical Detachment DUSTOFF 92nd Assault Helicopter Company Stallions and Sidekicks 101st Airborne Division Association\n\nD Co, 158 Avn Bn (Cobras) Redskins\n\nA Co, 101st Avn Bn (Huey’s) Comancheros\n\nA Btry 377 Arty (Huey and LOH) Gunner\n\nA Btry 4/77 ARA (Cobras) Dragons\n\nB Btry 4/77 ARA (Cobras) Toros\n\nC Btry 4/77 ARA (Cobras) Griffins\n\n326 Med Bn (Huey’s) Eagle Dustoff\n\n1st Bde Hdqtrs (LOH and Huey) Deadbone\n\n2nd Bde Hdqtrs (LOH and Huey) Brandy\n\n3rd Bde Hdqtrs (LOH and Huey) Thunder\n\n163 Avn Co.

Those red figures in the chart below represent the combined total of all other helicopters / crews outside of the Huey category; I was unable to locate individual statistics for each line item for that group. The numbers in the destroyed column are actual numbers which are verified by tail numbers.\n\nIt should also be pointed out that 532 American passengers were killed in downed aircraft and are not included in any of the KIA totals.\n\nKIA KIA Model # Served # Destroyed Pilots Lost Crew Lost All UH-1 Huey Slicks/guns 7,013 3,305 1,074 1,103 All AH-1G Cobras ⇑ 272 ⇑ ⇑ CH-21C Banana ⇑ 18 ⇑ ⇑ CH-3 Jolly Green’s ⇑ 14 ⇑ ⇑ CH-46 / 47 Chinook ⇑ 284 ⇑ ⇑ CH-53 Sea Stallions ⇑ 23 ⇑ ⇑ CH-54 Flying Crane 5000 9 1128 1601 HH-37 Heavy lift transport ⇓ 2 ⇓ ⇓ HH-3 Jolly Green Giant ⇓ 21 ⇓ ⇓ HH-43 Huskie Rescue ⇓ 13 ⇓ ⇓ HH-53 Super Jolly Green ⇓ 9 ⇓ ⇓ OH-13/23 Light Observation ⇓ 240 ⇓ ⇓ OH-6 LOH Scout ⇓ 842 ⇓ ⇓ OH-58A Armed Scout ⇓ 45 ⇓ ⇓ Misc Sioux / Sikorsky SH-3/34 ⇓ 14 ⇓ ⇓ Totals 12,013 5,111 2,202 2,704\n\nIt’s believed that the Huey and Cobra have more combat flight time than any other aircraft in the history of warfare assuming you count actual hostile fire exposure versus battle area exposure. As an example, heavy bombers during World War II most often flew missions lasting many hours with only 10 to 20 minutes of that time exposed to hostile fire. Helicopters in Vietnam were always exposed to hostile fire even in their base camps.\n\nThe following short video offers an animation presentation that shows crash sites during the war on a map of Southeast Asia. It’s interesting to note that only three major areas of the country show heavy concentrations in additions to the many locations in Cambodia and Laos.\n\nThe following article was published in the San Diego Union Tribune by John Wilkens on January 8, 2017 about the last pilots to die in Vietnam:\n\nHistory remembers them as the last two American pilots to die in Vietnam, killed when their Marine Corps helicopter went into the South China Sea during the frantic evacuation of Saigon on April 29, 1975. Their bodies were never recovered\n\n“I’ve thought about it every day for 41 years,” said Steve Wills, who was on the helicopter as crew chief and survived the crash. “I think it would be a healing thing for the whole nation.”\n\nOne of the aviators was Capt. William Nystul, who grew up in Coronado. The oldest of four sons, he graduated from Coronado High and San Diego State. He was 29 when he died, married with a young son. His co-pilot, 1st Lt. Michael Shea, from El Paso, Texas, was 25.\n\nYT-14 was on search and rescue duty off the carrier Hancock that day, ready to swoop in if other helicopters crashed and the crews needed to be pulled from the water. It took off at 6 a.m. for what would turn out to be about 17 hours of flying, interrupted a half-dozen times to land on the carrier to refuel.\n\nAbout 1 p.m., Nystul and Shea came on board to relieve the original pilots. Nystul, who had been teaching at a fixed-wing flight school in Pensacola, was sent back to Vietnam for his second tour after about 20 hours of re-training in the CH-46. Shea, a CH-53 pilot, had about 25 hours of training in the 46 before he was deployed.\n\nWills, the crew chief and right gunner, and Richard Scott, the mechanic and left gunner, were the other crew members. It was a busy day. They transported refugees from one ship to another. They rescued a Vietnamese man who crashed his small plane in the water.\n\n“We were dodging aircraft left and right,” Wills said in a phone interview from his home in Kalispell, Mont. “The helicopter flew good that day.”\n\nAt about 11 p.m., YT-14 was running low on fuel and needed to land on the Hancock. But there wasn’t room. Nystul got waved off twice. Finally cleared to come in, he had to make a hard right turn away from the carrier to avoid being hit by a plane arriving from behind.\n\n“Missed us by less than 100 feet,” Wills said.\n\nHe remembers the pilot telling the crew, “Somebody is going to die up here tonight.”\n\nInto the water\n\nBruce Collison was a medic that night on board the Hancock. Now living in Sarasota, Fla., he recalls being on the flight deck, transfixed by the red, blinking anti-collision light of a helicopter overhead: YT-14.\n\n“It continued circling the length of the ship, running out of fuel, looking for a place to land, losing altitude with every pass,” he said. “I’m convinced that if they had tried to land, with all the other helicopters there, some of them refueling, there would have been a total conflagration and a lot of people would have been killed. So they took it into the water instead.”\n\nOthers have surmised that the pilots got disoriented; it was a pitch-black night, no visible moon, impossible to see the horizon. The last thing Wills remembers hearing over his headset was a voice saying: “Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up!” Then darkness.\n\nHe regained consciousness underwater and made it to the surface. His left leg was fractured and his right hip dislocated. His helmet had been torn off. He fired two pen flares, then activated his rescue strobe. Scott was nearby and turned on his strobe, too.\n\nOn the Hancock, Collison remembers seeing the two strobes and thinking, “Great, there are survivors!” Then it dawned on him: “There should be four strobes.”\n\nAnother CH-46 lifted off the carrier, and to those on the flight deck, it looked as if it might disappear, too. Its landing lights went under water. Moments later, the engines roared and it lifted into the air and back toward the ship, carrying the engines roared and it lifted into the air and back toward the ship, carrying the two survivors.\n\nThe next day, on board the Hancock, they held a traditional burial at sea for the pilots. There were no bodies, so they put mock corpses under the American flags, and slid those into the ocean.\n\n“We were numb like zombies,” Collison said. “We’d spent all day saving people and then we lost two Marines. Nobody wanted to be the last guy to die in Vietnam, and then it happened to two guys that we knew. The whole thing felt surreal.”\n\nIt’s part of military lore that no man is left behind, but the evacuation task force had orders to move on. Saigon had fallen to the Viet Cong.\n\nA sobering video showing the aftereffects of helicopter crashes…many after the recovery:\n\n<iframe src=”https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fproud.us.veteransss123%2Fvideos%2F387690968724384%2F&show_text=0&width=560&#8243; width=”560″ height=”315″ style=”border:none;overflow:hidden” scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0″ allowTransparency=”true” allowFullScreen=”true”>\n\nClick on this link to read the entire story written above: http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/military/sdut-vietnam-helicopter-crash-2016may28-story.html\n\nLink for nose art: http://wp.me/pRiEw-1P4\n\nInformation for this article was obtained from Wikipedia, The Military Channel, The History Channel, https://www.archives.gov/research/military/vietnam-war/casualty, and Vietnam Helicopter Pilots Association. (Visit the VHPA museum in the near future at http://www.vhpa.org )\n\nI want to personally thank the 40,000 pilots and crews for being there when called. You are all held in the highest regard by us grunts and others who were in harm’s way. Thank you for your service and Welcome Back to those who made it home. Side note: Every time a Chinook or Blackhawk passes overhead from nearby Selfridge National Guard Base, I still find myself looking into the sky and watching it cross over until it’s gone…and then sometime when I’m outside, I hold my cane in both hands overhead in tribute to those magnificent men in their flying machines – and was then thankful that they didn’t land in my backyard.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.
