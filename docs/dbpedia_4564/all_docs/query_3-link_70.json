        "text": "Well, not on fire, but two big brown spots would f-up the Easter Egg Roll.\n\nHonestly, though, making his usual 10-min helo flight into a 5-minute helo flight probably isn't a big enough deal to incur the additional logistics load of the V-22. While there might be other missions of HMX that the V-22 would be well suited for, POTUS lift probably isn't the best one.\n\nI'd almost rather have the presidential helo NOT be something in the fleet. That way the parts don't all get sucked up into Quantico. Part priority always goes: HMX, deployed, fleet CONUS, supporting establishment.\n\nAn MV-22 Osprey with Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 261, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (Forward), here, lifts off on its way to a full day of missions April 24. The Osprey continues to prove a valuable asset for shrinking the battle space in 3rd MAW (FWD)'s operations area, flying faster and farther than any assault support aircraft in the region\n\nAn MV-22 Osprey with Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 261, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (Forward), Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, flies over the baron landscape of the Aghanistan desert while performing missions delivering personnel and cargo April 24.\n\nI just finished \"Dream Machine.\" It was generally very even-handed and focused more on the history than the controversy. It was kind of interesting to see lots of familiar names in print.\n\nThat douche-bag crank Carlton Meyer got more than his share of ink, though, as did Harry Dunn.\n\nBest quote--a Marine from VMM-263 holding a sign saying \"F--- You Mark Thompson.\" Mark Thompson was the writer of the Time hit-piece on the V-22.\n\nI just finished \"Dream Machine.\" It was generally very even-handed and focused more on the history than the controversy. It was kind of interesting to see lots of familiar names in print.\n\nJust finished it as well, outstanding. A must read for tiltrotor guys.\n\nThat douche-bag crank Carlton Meyer got more than his share of ink, though, as did Harry Dunn.\n\nYes, but I think the author did a good job putting things into perspective with regard to those guys. When he described the \"Red Ribbon\" side of the house, I reflected on all the colorful conversations I had with various KNDZ/KNSE sim instructors who openly admitted to getting their intel from G2Mil. It wouldnt be a stretch to say they probobly drink beer and play golf with Dunn on a regular basis...or maybe that's Kool-Aid...\n\nBest quote--a Marine from VMM-263 holding a sign saying \"F--- You Mark Thompson.\" Mark Thompson was the writer of the Time hit-piece on the V-22.\n\nThe picture is just as classic."
