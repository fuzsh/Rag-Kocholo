        "text": "Command SgtsMaj, LCpls, Cooks, and Grunts I was medically separated from the Marine Corps, as a LCpl. I never deployed to Afghanistan. I never deployed to Iraq. In fact, while in the Marine Corps, I never left the Continental United States. I never saw combat and I never ki||ed anyone. Regardless, I still served in the United States Marine Corps and I still earned the title Marine. I say that to say, if you served, you served. You signed a line that few ever have. Take pride in that. There‚Äôs no need to inflate, misrepresent, or outright lie about your service. Look, I am not Thomas Schueman. I am not Jake Reiff, and I‚Äôm not Justin LeHew. Those three men are warriors. That isn‚Äôt me. And that is okay. Because each of us brings a unique set of skills to the table. In my experience, respect comes, not from how many bodies you‚Äôve dr0pped, but from how honest you are and from what kind of a leader you are. It takes all kinds of kinds to make this world go round - from cooks to infantry officers to everything in between - each has a role and each is valuable. To misrepresent or to lie about your service does far more harm than good and, to discredit the service of another, because they held the title 92G/3381 vs 11B/0311, is toxic and has no place in the #veteran community. Be yourself. There‚Äôs enough of everyone else. _____ üì∏: me - terminal lance, subpar angler, district commander, decent hunter, and d@mn good veterans advocate. #veteransaffairs #veterans #stolenvalor #marinecorps #semperfi #leadership #noteveryoneinthenationalguardisacook #cooksarecooltoo\n\nSSgt. Michael A. Bock, 26, of Leesburg, Florida, died 13 August 2010 in Helmand province, Afghanistan, while supporting combat operations. No matter what time of day it was or where he was in the world, SSgt. Michael Bock always put his family first. A Valentine's Day didn't go by without Bock sending his wife roses, even while she was back home and he was overseas. The 26-year-old made sure to get up in the middle of the night recently while in #Afghanistan, so he could get online and watch his 3-year-old son, Zander, blow out his birthday candles. ‚ÄúHe was such a wonderful husband and an excellent father,‚Äù said Tiffany Bock, 27, of Omaha. ‚ÄúFamily was always the first thing on his mind.‚Äù She said her husband, a member of the 3rd Combat Engineer Battalion, was shot and killed Friday in Afghanistan. No other details were available. Michael Bock was the third Omaha-area service member to die in the fighting in Afghanistan. Bock grew up in Springfield, Neb., and attended Elkhorn Mount Michael High School for two years. Then his mother retired from teaching at #Omaha Northwest High School. Bock graduated from Leesburg High School in 2002. About a month after graduating, he started boot camp. ‚ÄúHe wanted to be a good provider for his family, and he thought the military was the best way to do that,‚Äù Tiffany Bock said. Louis Sojka, Bock's religion teacher at Mount Michael, remembered his former student as someone who carved his own path. ‚ÄúHe worked hard, and he didn't go with the main crowd,‚Äù Sojka said. ‚ÄúHe did his own thing and found his own way.‚Äù Bock was stationed mostly at Camp Pendleton near San Diego, but he was deployed twice to Iraq and most recently to Afghanistan in April. Bock also served in Australia and Indonesia, and he received a #MarineCorps humanitarian ribbon for his help during the tsunami recovery in 2004. He re-enlisted in the Marines twice. ‚ÄúHe was proud to serve his country,‚Äù his wife said. ‚ÄúBut no matter what he was doing, even when he was working 16-hour days, he would still call and tell us he loved us.‚Äù Michael Bock and Tiffany Scheiblhofer were high school sweethearts. He attended Mount Michael, and she went to Omaha Mercy. They met at a high school football game through mutual friends. When Bock moved to Florida, the couple stayed in touch and made their long-distance relationship work. Tiffany loved everything about Mike. He was outgoing and had a lot of friends. When he was a sophomore and Tiffany a junior, the couple performed together in Mount Michael's production of the musical ‚ÄúJoseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.‚Äù The couple, married in 2003, had been together for almost 11 years. They planned to buy a home in Omaha. ‚ÄúHe just wanted to come home and be with his family,‚Äù said Tiffany, a homemaker and student in Metro Community College's culinary arts program. _____ August is about Afghanistan. #marines #usmc #semperfi\n\nThe sh***iest advice I‚Äôve ever received and a lesson for veterans A little over four years ago, in the midst of COVID, I found myself at a crossroads. The professional landscape around me was shifting and I sensed I should return to school, to obtain an advanced designation. At the time, pursuing advanced designations was not financially supported, but not one to let a regulation stand in my way, I looked elsewhere. Shortly after receiving word that I had been granted a full-ride scholarship from The American College of Financial Services, I received a call from someone in leadership, advising me to ‚Äúreconsider my decision‚Äù to continue my education. The individual was concerned I wouldn‚Äôt be able to juggle both school and work. I‚Äôd either lose my business or I‚Äôd never graduate. No one else had sought a designation this early in their career. I should wait longer. At the time, I was furious. What I lack for in other areas of my life, I make up for in tenacity. I am unrelenting in obtaining what I desire. When I set my mind to a particular goal, nothing will stop me. It is, without question, one of my greatest attributes. So the idea that I was somehow incapable of juggling a career and school was insulting. Perhaps, to others, the task was insurmountable. But I had spent my career surrounded by those who chose to consistently climb the highest mountains - surrounded by those who ran towards obstacles, not from them. Fortunately, I had an exceptional mentor who encouraged me to continue, despite the noise around me. Fast forward, last week, I found myself in a conference for training. One of the overarching themes of the training was the importance of continued learning. The presenters encouraged everyone in the room to obtain an advanced designation. Specifically, they mentioned the importance of the very designation I was discouraged from obtaining four years ago. What was so frowned upon then, was actively encouraged there, in that moment. I silently smiled. I silently smiled, because of all those intangible qualities that service members bring to the table - initiative, endurance, courage, commitment - those same qualities far too often overlooked by employers, had me years ahead of the curve. So, if you‚Äôre reading this, especially if you‚Äôre a veteran, and you find yourself being told to dampen your energy or to shrink yourself so that those around you may feel less intimidated, don‚Äôt. Trust your gut, follow the voice in your heart, and bet on yourself. _____ üì∏: photo is from years ago, after I had passed one of the courses for the designation. #leadership #mentorship #education #transitioningmilitary #hireveterans #hiremilitary #militarythriving #veterans\n\nPolitical v Partisan: a lesson in semantics and a small rant As we approach the November election, it‚Äôs imperative veterans and, particularly members of The American Legion, understand the difference between the words ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù and ‚Äúpartisan.‚Äù The American Legion has been, is, and will continue to be a political organization. The organization and, primarily, its DC office exist solely for political purposes - to lobby Congress on behalf of its membership on matters to ‚Äúpertaining to the government or the public affairs‚Äù of our country. (Political!) The American Legion is not a ‚Äúfirm adherent to one party, faction, or person.‚Äù (Partisan!) The organization exists to push forward legislation that benefits its members, regardless of which party may or may not support the legislation. As for politics, I‚Äôm not sure when, but as some point, being deemed ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù became a bad thing. I adamantly believe the SIV process should be streamlined for Afghan Allies. I believe immigrants should receive citizenship for serving honorably in our nations military. I believe outdated AUMFs should be repealed, so that Congress no longer usurps the voice of the American people. I believe the Coast Guard should be paid during a federal shut down. I believe the VA should continue to modernize to provide the most efficient and effective service to our veterans. All of those statements are political. None of those statements are partisan. Rather than admonishing members for being political, we should encourage them to be more political - more engaged, more loud, more concerned. Do you think officials should be held responsible for the deaths of 13 servicemembers in Kabul in 2021? GOOD. Say something about it. Do you think it‚Äôs malarkey Congress has a seemingly bottomless pit of funds for foreign nations, but not for barracks construction? GOOD. Say something about it. We need more men and women - not less - with the intestinal fortitude necessary to take a stance and stand by it. Be political. _____ üì∏: eating a beignet, probably arguing politics #foreignpolicy #veteransstrengtheningamerica #politics #veterans #defense #military #readingcomprehension\n\nUS Army Captain Jeremy Chandler was killed on August 11, 2005, during combat operations near Tarin Khowt, Afghanistan.
