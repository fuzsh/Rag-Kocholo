        "text": "MARINE MEDIUM TILTROTOR\n\nSQUADRON 162\n\n\"Golden Eagles\"\n\nVMM-162 was activated 30 June 1951 at MCAF Santa Ana, CA, as Helicopter Transport Squadron (HMR) 162. After initial forming and outfitting, HMR-162 deployed to Japan with MAG-16 in 1953. During the next six years the squadron participated in several exercises and flew missions in support of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing and the 3d Marine Division. After redesignating to HMR(L)-162 in 1956, the squadron began rotations between Japan and New River. This lasted until 1962. In 1960, MAG-16 relocated from Oppama, Japan, to the new base at Futenma, Okinawa.\n\nDuring 1962 HMR(L)-162 became HMM-162. It again deployed to Okinawa, taking part in operations during the crisis in Laos (Jun-Jul 1962). In 1963 (Jan-Jun)and 1964 (Jun-Oct) HMM-162 deployed to Da Nang, South Vietnam, as part of Operation SHUFLY. After the official outbreak of hostilities 162 returned to South Vietnam, operating there from March to May 1965.\n\nAfter serving in Vietnam, HMM-162 returned to New River, which has been its home for nearly 45 years.\n\nFrom the 1960s through the 1980s, HMM-162 participated in numerous training exercises, as well as deploying as the Aviation Combat Element for the Caribbean and 6th Fleet Landing Forces. The Golden Eagles were deployed to Lebanon in 1982. During the next decade they participated on several operations including \"Sharp Edge\" in Liberia, \"Provide Comfort\" in Iraq, \"Restore Hope\" in Somalia, \"Provide Promise\" and \"Deny Flight\" in Bosnia, and finally, \"Assured Response\" in Liberia.\n\nHMM-162 participated in the Liberaton of Iraq in 2003. This marked their last combat deployment with the CH-46. In 2005, the squadron entered cadre status in preparation for transition to the MV-22 \"Osprey\". VMM-162 was stood up on 31 August 2006 at MCAS New River. Since then, the \"Golden Eagles\" have made a deployment to Iraq in support of operations there.\n\nLINEAGE\n\n1951 - 1961\n\nActivated 30 June 1951 at Santa Ana, California, as Marine Helicopter Squadron 162 and assigned to Air, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific.\n\nReassigned during March 1952 to Marine Aircraft Group 16, Air, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific.\n\nDeployed during August 1953 to Asaka, Japan, and reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 16, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\nDeployed during March 1954 to Oppama, Japan.\n\nRedesignated 31 December 1956 as Marine Helicopter Squadron (Light) 162.\n\nRelocated during February 1959 to New River, North Carolina, 2d Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\nDeployed during April 1960 to Futenma, Okinawa, and reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 16, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\nRelocated during July 1961 to New River, North Carolina, and reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 26, 2d Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\n1962 - 1969\n\nReassigned 1 February 1962 as Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 162.\n\nDeployed during June 1962 to Futenma, Okinawa and reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 16, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\nTemporarily stationed in Thailand during June - July 1962 for Laotian Crisis.\n\nRedeployed during January 1963 to the Republic of Vietnam.\n\nParticipated in the war in Vietnam, January - June 1963, June - October 1964, and March - May 1965, operating from Da Nang - Nha Trang.\n\nRelocated during June 1963 to New River, North Carolina, and reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 26, 2d Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\nDeployed during May 1964 to Futenma, Okinawa, and reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 16, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\nRedeployed during June 1964 to the Republic of Vietnam.\n\nRedeployed during October 1964 to Futenma, Okinawa.\n\nAfloat onboard USS Princeton in the Eastern Pacific, October 1964 - March 1965.\n\nRedeployed during March 1965 to the Republic of Vietnam.\n\nRedeployed during May 1965 to Futenma, Okinawa.\n\nRelocated during June 1965 to New River, North Carolina, and reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 26, 2d Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\n1970 - 2006\n\nDeployed at various times during the 1970s and 1980s to the Mediterranean, North Atlantic, Caribbean, and Indian Ocean areas.\n\nParticipated in deployment to the Indian Ocean, October - December 1980.\n\nReassigned during January 1983 to Marine Aircraft Group 29.\n\nParticipated as part of the Multinational Peace-Keeping Force in Lebanon, May - November 1982.\n\nParticipated in Operation Sharp Edge, Liberia, August 1990 - January 1991.\n\nParticipated in support of Operation Provide Comfort, Iraq, July 1991.\n\nParticipated in support of Operation Restore Hope, Somalia, November 1993.\n\nParticipated in support of Operations Provide Promise and Deny Flight, Bosnia, January 1994.\n\nParticipated in Operation Assured Response, Liberia, April - June 1996.\n\nParticipated in Operation Iraqi Freedom (2003).\n\nHMM-162 placed in cadre status - October 2005.\n\nVMM-162 activated 31 August 2006 at New River.\n\nUNIT HONORS\n\nPRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION STREAMER with one bronze star\n\nVietnam\n\n1965\n\nIraq\n\n2003)\n\nNAVY UNIT COMMENDATION STREAMER with three bronze stars\n\nVietnam\n\n1963 - 1964\n\nLebanon\n\n1983\n\n1983\n\nMERITORIOUS UNIT COMMENDATION with 3 bronze stars\n\n1974\n\n1979\n\n1986 - 1987\n\n1998\n\nMARINE CORPS EXPEDITIONARY STREAMER with 3 bronze stars\n\nNATIONAL DEFENSE SERVICE STREAMER with 3 bronze stars\n\nKOREAN SERVICE STREAMER\n\nARMED FORCES EXPEDITIONARY STREAMER\n\nVIETNAM SERVICE STREAMER with 2 bronze stars\n\nSOUTHWEST ASIA SERVICE STREAMER with 1 bronze star\n\nIRAQ CAMPAIGN STREAMER with 1 bronze star\n\nGLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM EXPEDITIONARY STREAMER\n\nVIETNAM CROSS of GALLANTRY with PALM STREAMER"
