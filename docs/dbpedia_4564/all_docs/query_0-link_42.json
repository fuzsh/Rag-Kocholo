        "text": "A highly selective and unique niche fills the ranks of the Marine Corps’ Silent Drill Platoon. Throughout the unit’s history, the platoon has proven unparalleled among the services at their craft and represented the Marine Corps on the grandest scale. To earn a spot with this elite group, a young Marine must begin proving himself from the moment he steps on the yellow footprints.\n\nWhen a new infantry Marine graduates from Infantry Training Battalion, a select few receive assignment to Marine Barracks Washington, D.C. Selections are based on multiple characteristics, but character and performance trump all. Once finished with Ceremonial Drill School, the basic training for all new marching Marines at “8th and I,” fewer still receive the opportunity to compete for a spot with the Silent Drill Platoon.\n\nSilent Drill School commences every December. Prospective candidates volun­teer to showcase their skills and attention to detail. Some years, more than half of the platoon’s requirement of 39 Marines is vacated when some move into the fleet or civilian life. As the candidate pool is whittled down, instructors finalize the list of selectees. The platoon veterans then pack up and take off with the new selects for their culminating annual training event at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Ariz.\n\nSpring training in Yuma lasts one month. The Marines work 12 or more hours a day, seven days a week, memoriz­ing every muscle movement in the routine.\n\n“In Yuma we learn the new sequence for the year and work to get the new guys in the platoon up to par,” said Corporal Alexander A. Rojas, 2nd Squad Leader in the platoon. “Training days are very long, every day.”\n\n“It’s a grind, waking up at 0600 every morning and working until 10 o’clock at night,” added Cpl Jack N. Conner, 3rd Squad Leader. “But it’s a great way to get away from everything here at the barracks and just focus on ourselves, perfecting everything and preparing for the parade season.”\n\nThe platoon’s Drill Master, a senior corporal in his third or fourth year with the unit, creates the routine. He envisions the flow and tempo of each Marine and invents the paths they take, orchestrating their movements into a single, purposeful design. The platoon Rifle Inspector serves as the subject matter expert in rifle manual and spins. He and the Assistant Rifle In­spector take the lead in polishing the re­flexes and hand-eye-coordination of each Marine to ensure a flawless performance.\n\nWhile the Drill Master and Rifle In­spec­tor work together to create a unique performance, flavored with their personal brand of experience and style, several major portions of the routine endure as Silent Drill Platoon traditions. Anyone familiar with the platoon recognizes the iconic “bursting bomb” formation, or “long line” rifle inspection sequence. Like all Marines, Silent Drill Platoon members idolize their forerunners, em­brace their unit history, and pass their creed onto a new generation each year.\n\nThe legacy of the Silent Drill Platoon originated in 1948. Though intended as a one-time performance, the first version of the team received an overwhelming and enthusiastic response. The public demanded repeat performances. As a result, the platoon eventually became a permanent part of Marine Barracks Washington. Throughout its history, newly minted infantrymen, prior to their first tour in the fleet, filled out the platoon. The Marines today celebrate one notable exception to this standard, memorializing a unique point in time on their barracks wall. A black and white photograph displayed in the passageway depicts the platoon during the Vietnam War, when even the Marines of the Silent Drill Platoon deployed to combat. The photo looks much like any other taken of the platoon in formation, except that each Marine wears sergeant or staff sergeant chevrons and a chest full of medals.\n\nThe Marines proudly differentiate them­selves through numerous traditions passed down over the years. From tattoos to unique uniform details, some traditions are held sacred and recognized only by veterans of the platoon. The coveted silver buttons worn by the number one Rifle Inspector represent one of the more widely known rituals. Since the 1970s, the Rifle Inspector has removed the brass buttons from his dress blues and entrusted them to his successor. Over time and through constant polishing, the buttons turned silver and became a trademark feature. The original buttons are pre­served today in a glass case, still handed down to each new Rifle Inspector for safe keeping, while he sews another set of silver buttons to his blouse to keep the tradition alive. As a far lesser known or visible tradition, when practicing drill out of uniform, the Marines adopt the style of their predecessors, drilling in Converse hightop shoes. A keen observer might notice the iconic shoes tied dif­ferently from Marine to Marine, laced one eyelet farther down to signify the number of years a Marine has served with the platoon.\n\nThe summer parade season is the pla­toon’s primary tradition and premier event, and is the most widely anticipated engagement every year. Most spectators familiar with the Silent Drill Platoon recognize the unit from one of their classic performances at a Friday Evening Parade or Tuesday Sunset Parade. Running June through August, these two performances every week represent the minimum of the platoon’s time commitment. The Ma­rines travel all over the country, and sometimes internationally, performing at a variety of venues. One day, the platoon might execute their routine in a local high school gymnasium for a group of students and their parents. The next night, the Marines could be standing on the 50-yard line during the halftime show of a National Football League game in front of thousands of cheering fans. Often, the Marines land back in Washington, D.C., within an hour or two of their next performance at an Evening Parade. They don their dress blues, proceed directly onto the parade field, then fly out once again the following morning for their next performance.\n\nIn addition to performing, traveling, and remaining the best in the business at slide drill and rifle spinning, platoon members must maintain proficiency in the basic skills as an infantry Marine.\n\n“It’s a tight window, but we throw in infantry classes, land nav classes, and practical application on our annex field here in D.C. whenever we can,” Corporal Christopher I. Houck stated, who serves as 1st Squad Leader. “Sometimes it’s tough to get in training here in the city, but we use whatever resources we can.”\n\nHouck and the other squad leaders prepare the Professional Military Edu­ca­tion to be covered during their days abroad. Several times a year, the platoon travels to Marine Corps Base Quantico, Va., to practice infantry tactics in the field and complete their basic set of re­quirements. They spend time on the range for rifle qualification and complete their annual Physical Fitness and Combat Fitness Tests.\n\nWhile extremely demanding and chal­lenging, Silent Drill Platoon Marines take immense pride in their role. Not only because of the unique opportunity they possess to be one of the very few who have ever earned a spot with the platoon, but also because of what the unit rep­resents about the Corps and our beloved history. When the elevator door opens onto the Silent Drill Platoon’s deck at 8th and I, a large wooden sign is immediately visible to anyone visiting, and to Marines returning home. “Remember what you represent.” There’s nothing ambiguous about the meaning behind those words for the Marines of the Silent Drill Pla­toon—they are part of something greater than themselves.\n\nPlaques, memorials, and photographs evenly spaced down each passageway contrast against the black-painted walls in distinguished prominence. Each tells a proud story of platoon history, remem­bers an extraordinary example of bearing and fortitude, or recognizes individual Marines for their performance.\n\nOne stun­ning memorial just beyond the elevator door remembers Lance Corporal Davis M. Mosqueda. While on holiday leave in his hometown of Boise, Idaho, Mosqueda joined a party on Dec. 30, 2020. When gunshots rang out from the apartment parking lot, Mosqueda realized one of his friends was outside and in danger. He ignored the threat and moved outside in order to protect his friend. In the proc­ess, the assailant shot and killed Mosqueda. To recognize his off-duty example of honor, courage, and commitment, a pen­cil sketch of Mosqueda performing with the platoon stands alongside his M1 Garand bayonet and several other items in his memory.\n\nOther memorials along the wall pay tribute to Marines who displayed exem­plary demeanor during a performance as a reminder that no matter what occurs, you must maintain your bearing. On April 28, 2004, LCpl Jamar C. Bailey executed his part on the rifle inspection team during a performance at 8th and I. According to his Certificate of Com­menda­tion, “At the moment when two rifles are exchanged between three Ma­rines, the rifle that was thrown to Lance Corporal Bailey was not in the proper position … and struck him in the face. The front sight post caught him in the cheek and opened a 2-inch long cut.”\n\nA photograph next to Bailey’s certifi­cate shows him standing at attention as he continued on to flawlessly finish out the remainder of the performance. Blood pours down his chin and covers his blouse. It took 14 stitches to sew his face back together. His bloodstained blouse hangs in the display case with his photo as a testament to his outstanding example of commitment to his profession.\n\nAnother plaque on display serves as a persistent reminder to all Marines in the platoon that their role is constantly under evaluation and up for grabs. Dedicated by the outgoing platoon leadership in 2022, the “Old Dogs and New Dogs” plaque recognizes both the top performing pla­toon veteran and rookie each year.\n\nThe Marines named here earn their spot in the marching 24. The remaining 22 spots are highly coveted and must be earned throughout the year. Character and discipline play a primary function in securing a role in the platoon. To achieve the highest honor of marching with the 24, each Marine must be constantly ready for Challenge Day.\n\nThe first Challenge Day of the year comes at the end of spring training when the initial marching 24 are finalized. Every Marines understands, however, that his spot in the 24 remains secure only through demonstrating the highest level of proficiency and character. The number of Challenge Days in a year varies at the discretion of the platoon leadership. They come as a surprise, un­announced until the morning of, forcing each Marine to remain constantly pre­pared. Every Ma­rine in the platoon per­forms the routine from start to finish, individually and under close scrutiny of the Drill Master. They receive a com­posite score at the end, and the highest scores fill out the marching 24. The intense level of preparation re­quired for competition against their peers enables those who achieve the marching 24 to perform under any circumstances, in front of any audience.\n\nSilent Drill Platoon Marines consider their bearing as a leadership trait held in the highest regard. They revere examples such as Jamar Bailey and others who, under extraordinary circumstances, main­tained their bearing, performed their drill routine, and demonstrated exactly the type of character the Marine Corps wants to embody. On rare occasions, mistakes are made. Hats cock to the side and fall off, or rifles are dropped. In cases such as this, the Marines remain stoic on the outside while the Rifle Inspector corrects the problem as he moves down the line.\n\nPerforming on the grandest stage, at the highest level of visibility, appears not to unnerve the Marines. Representing the heart and soul of what the public envisions about the Marine Corps drives the pla­toon to perform flawlessly, regardless of the circumstances surrounding the oc­casion. In March 2023, the Silent Drill Pla­toon travelled to Anchorage, Alaska, to perform at the opening ceremony of the 51st annual Iditarod sled dog race. Before dawn, with temperatures hovering below zero, the platoon donned hoodies and beanies to practice their routine a final time in the quiet, empty street near the starting line. Several hours later, they marched out once more in full uniform before the cheering crowd. The Marines executed the drill on a slippery and snow-covered street, while the temperature rose barely above zero. Their incredible dis­cipline and professionalism marked an awesome first-time appearance for the platoon at the event.\n\nFleet Week in New York City arrived two months later. In front of an audience of civilians, allied nation military rep­resen­tatives, and members of each branch of the U.S. Armed Forces, the Silent Drill Platoon shone. They performed their solemn and respectful routine in the cen­ter of Times Square with fluorescent flashing lights all around, traffic and car horns blaring, police whistles signaling, and people shouting. A nearly torrential downpour elevated the impact of the per­formance, as the Marines flowed together unfazed by the rain, spinning, flipping, and tossing their soaked rifles with soaked gloves.\n\nOne annual opportunity offers the Ma­rines a chance to prove they truly are the masters of their craft. Drill teams from each branch of service compete head-to-head at the Joint Service Drill Exhibition every spring near the National Mall in Washington, D.C. On April 15, the Silent Drill Platoon wowed the crowd once again, outperforming teams from the Navy, Coast Guard, Army, and Air Force to win the competition for the third year in a row.\n\nThe character traits Marines perfect during their time with the Silent Drill Platoon serve them well over the rest of their career.\n\n“None of us have been to the fleet yet, but a lot of friends who have gone on from here have become very successful,” said Cpl Conner. “They have a lot of unique skills; the attention to detail, the discipline, ability to teach, ability to learn quickly; and take them with them. We’ve had guys go to MARSOC, we’ve had guys go to Recon. Others lateral move and find success in a different MOS.”\n\n“The intangibles these Marines take with them from being part of the platoon sets them up for success,” said Captain Gregory Jones, the Silent Drill Platoon Commander. “It pays dividends wherever they decide to go from here.”\n\nRegardless of their next duty station, a Marine’s time with the Silent Drill Platoon remains a cherished time in their career. The pride they take reflects what other Marine veterans feel when we watch them perform. Throughout our lives, the title of “Marine” endures as the proudest we have earned. With each performance, the Silent Drill Platoon offers outsiders a glimpse of why.\n\nAuthor’s bio: Kyle Watts is the staff writer for Leatherneck.

He lives in Richmond, Va., with his wife and three children.\n\nEditor’s note: This article was re-published in honor of Women Veterans Appreciation Day on June 12. It was originally published in the August 2022 issue of Leatherneck Magazine.\n\nAfter a recent visit to the Military Women’s Memorial and its edu­cation center, located at the cere­monial entrance to Arlington National Cemetery, a group of young women in uniform seemed to stand up a little taller and straighter than when they walked in mere hours earlier. At least that’s how the memorial foundation’s president, retired Chief Warrant Officer 5 Phyllis Wilson, USA, describes the visible boost in morale she observed as the noncommissioned of­ficers absorbed the stories of the trail­blazing women who came before them and paved the way.\n\n“Many of them had no idea on whose shoulders they stand and what these women endured to make it easier for the next generation,” said Wilson, who as­sumed her current position in 2019 after 37 years of service in the Army intelligence community. “It’s a great educational op­por­tunity, and it’s empowering […] under­standing the lineage, the collective lineage: not just by your branch of service, but what all these women have collectively done for us.”\n\nOfficially named the Women in Military Service for America Memorial, the unique landmark, which recently reopened to the public on Memorial Day after a six-month closure for partial renovation, celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. It’s the only major national memorial of its kind, honoring the efforts of the more than 3 million American women who have served in defense of the nation since the Revolutionary War. And while it’s cer­tainly a mecca of sorts for women who have worn the uniform, the small, dedicated group of staff members who oversee its daily operations emphasize that it’s important for all servicemembers and all Americans—regardless of gender—to understand the complete history of women’s military service and the barriers that women in uniform continue to break today.\n\nThat’s precisely what the memorial’s 33,000 square-foot education center strives to achieve by featuring artifacts from its extensive collection of memorabilia, uniforms, diaries, photographs and more in a chronological array of exhibits that detail women’s contributions to national defense which began even before women were legally permitted to serve—or even to vote.\n\nFrom Deborah Sampson, who dis­guised herself as a man and joined the Continental Army during the American Revolution, and Dr. Mary Edwards Walker, who served as a civilian surgeon for the Union Army during the Civil War and is the only female Medal of Honor recipient in history; to the female yeomen or “yeomanettes” and the first Woman Marines who joined through the U.S. Navy Reserve and Marine Corps Reserve due to a loophole in the Naval Act of 1916, visitors to the education center learn about the women whose bravery and patriotism set the conditions for the progress that would slowly but surely follow.\n\nAnother exhibit entitled “Sweet Victory” educates visitors on the Women’s Armed Services Integration Act of 1948, which came on the heels of the Second World War, during which women served in separate and distinct branches of the services: the U.S. Marine Corps Women’s Reserve, the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (WACs), the Women Air Force Service Pilots (WASPs), the Women Accepted for Volunteer Military Services (WAVES), and the Coast Guard Women Reserve who were known as SPARs – Semper Paratus Always Ready. The act allowed women to integrate into the regular and reserve Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force as full members and to serve during peacetime, albeit with significant restrictions: women had limited benefits, could only make up 2 percent of the total force, could not have children, and could not achieve a grade above O-5 unless they were chief of one of the women’s components.\n\nAccording to retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Marilla Cushman, who has been on the staff of the Military Women’s Memorial since shortly before its 1997 dedication and now serves as Wilson’s senior advisor, it’s vital that young women serving in uniform today gain an understanding of their collective history and recognize that it wasn’t long ago that they were granted many of the opportunities and entitlements they are afforded today. When speaking with these servicewomen, Cushman often uses the Supreme Court’s 1973 landmark decision in Frontiero v. Richardson, which allowed military women to secure equal benefits like housing allowances and healthcare for their spouses and dependents, as an example. They’re often surprised to learn, she said, that when Cushman was commissioned in 1972, she was not yet entitled to the same benefits as her male counterparts.\n\nAmong the education center’s other displays are a case detailing the instru­mental efforts of the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS), established in 1951, as well as a look at the various capacities in which women have served, ranging from Ameri­can Women’s Voluntary Service on the homefront during World War II, to nurses in the Vietnam and women who served in combat roles during the Global War on Terror. A sobering display of 177 yellow ribbons pays tribute by name to each woman who has died in service since 9/11, and the newest exhibit, “The Color of Freedom,” honors the diversity of Ameri­ca’s servicewomen throughout history.\n\n“The Women’s Memorial is a living tribute to all who have worn the uniform,” said veteran Marine Dr. Betty Moseley Brown, who, while serving as the 19th national president of the Women Marines Association, was an honored guest at the memorial for the unveiling of an exhibit that honored the 100th anniversary of women in the Marine Corps in 2018. “The Women’s Memorial opened their doors so we could commemorate our history and weave their stories of those in uniform today and for our future. We are honored to have this living memorial,” she added.\n\nThe memorial’s recent renovation in­cludes an update to its office spaces, rest­rooms and, most notably, the transfor­mation of its 196-seat theater into a state-of-the-art multipurpose event space known as the Vaught Center, a tribute to retired Air Force Brigadier General Wilma L. Vaught, the memorial’s founder and a pioneer of her time who was in­ducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame in 2000. After her 1985 retirement as one of the most decorated military women in U.S. history to that point, Brig Gen Vaught dedicated the following three decades to serving as the memorial foun­da­tion’s president. Wilson, her successor, often refers to the memorial as “the house that Wilma built,” and lauds the tireless efforts of the general who, now in her 90s, continues to serve as the memorial foun­dation’s president emeritus.\n\nAfter the Women in Military Service for America Memorial Foundation was founded in 1985, Congress approved the story of women’s service to the nation, at its heart—literally and figuratively—is its “Register,” a central alcove of the memorial that houses its digital repository of stories of individual women’s service, to include their memorable experiences and awards and decorations. To date, they’ve collected just over 300,000—nearly two-thirds of which were gathered before the memorial even opened in 1997—and Wilson, Cushman and their team are on a mission to raise that number significantly by getting the word out to women who have served or are currently serving, or their surviving family members. Reg­istration is simple and can be done by creating an account on the memorial’s website, uploading a photo and submitting the requested information.\n\nIt’s an effort that retired Marine Lieu­tenant General Loretta “Lori” Reynolds, who served as the Corps’ deputy com­mandant for information and has been a stalwart supporter of the Military Women’s Memorial, believes in wholeheartedly.\n\n“So much of our history is the big stories. It’s the big stories of courage and those are important. But it’s the little stories of courage and service that don’t always get noticed. I think the memorial does a fabulous job of collecting those,” said LtGen Reynolds.\n\nNot only are the stories collected by the Military Women’s Memorial accessible online at its website, where they are fre­quently accessed by family members and researchers alike, but they also come to life in the Register room, where visitors can search their own names, or the names of family members or friends who served, which are then displayed on a screen. Often, veterans visit the memorial as part of an Honor Flight, and Wilson, Cushman and the rest of the memorial staff relish the opportunity to recognize the women veterans among the tour group by pulling up their “stories” from the register, calling them up front and center and reading their accolades and memorable experiences to the group.\n\n“Firsthand accounts are so critical to our database, to our researchers, to us,” said Wilson. “It’s so amazing what they tell us. It’s just stunning what these women are willing to entrust to us.”\n\nAt the foundation offices just down the road from the cemetery, a “book room” is home to wall-to-wall shelving filled with binders that catalog all of the registrations that were received by mail in the years leading up to the memorial’s opening. Within them are handwritten stories, original photographs and letters from women across the nation who answered the call when their country needed them most.\n\n“Often we’ll have folks that say, ‘Well, I didn’t do anything.’ But you did,” said Cushman, to which Wilson added, “You served in the capacity that the nation permitted you to serve. Women couldn’t graduate from service academies until 1980. We didn’t have the first woman general until 1970 […] so there are a lot of things in very recent history that have changed and freed us up.”\n\nFrequently, family members come to the memorial after their loved one has been buried at Arlington and want to look up the deceased’s individual story of service. Other times, it’s the women themselves, many of whom earned the title “Marine.”\n\nLast summer, veteran Marine and form­er Private First Class Patricia Morlock Sanderson, who served in the Corps from 1954 to 1955, visited the memorial with her granddaughter. When a staff member pulled up her profile on the screen, Sanderson, in her late 80s, raised her sleeve to show off her recent USMC tattoo, which she got at the age of 85, and took a photo with her personal story “card.”\n\nIn another instance, during an Honor Flight visit, Wilson had the opportunity to present a Marine veteran, Evelyn Kandel, who also served during the 1950s, with a complete uniform that she never received during her time in the Corps. The emotion on her face, said Wilson, was priceless.\n\n“It just illustrates the pride, and the enduring pride in service, of these women. What it meant to be able to say, ‘I’m a Marine,’” said Cushman.\n\n“Individually we can all say, ‘Well, what I did wasn’t much. If I had never served, the Army or Marine Corps would have driven on,’” said Wilson. “But when you see as a collective these different eras of women and the transformation over time, what has transpired, and you realize, ‘I was part of that!’ That’s what causes these women to suddenly sit up straighter, whether they’re in their wheelchairs or they’re 100 years old or they’re a young woman coming in and they’re at the front of their military career […] I think it just gives them a better sense of the lineage of which they are now part of.”\n\nIt’s important to Wilson and her staff that even those who can’t physically visit the memorial are still able to benefit from its treasure trove of women’s military history. Artifacts from the foundation’s collection are on loan at numerous museums and the memorial also has traveling exhibits that make their way to universities, libraries and other institutions. In recent years, they’ve expanded their website with a 360-degree virtual tour of the website and launched a YouTube channel with an extensive collection of videos called “HERstory Spotlights” that feature various topics and individuals related to women’s military history.\n\nIn late 2023, the memorial will close again for a second phase renovation, this time to its exhibits, which will be overhauled to include more interactive and technology-based displays. But despite current and future changes, the mission remains unchanged.\n\n“To embrace that legacy is so important to who you are, and to know that you’ve been part of this journey, and that you have been entrusted to carry that legacy forward,” Cushman said.\n\nAt first glance, with their dis­similar camouflage and a red star on the tail, the F-5 Tigers on the flight­line don’t appear to be American aircraft. A closer look will reveal “Ma­rines” emblazoned boldly on the fuse­lages. These F-5s belong to Marine Fighter Training Squadron 401, currently the only adversary squadron in the Ma­rine Corps. Stationed aboard Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, VMFT-401, the “Lucky Snipers,” are an expert team of pilots and support personnel who play an integral role in honing Marine Corps readiness through their use of dissimilar air combat training (DACT). In other words, they play the “bad guys,” and they are very good at it.\n\nSquadron History\n\nVMFT-401 was activated in 1986 in response to a growing need for DACT for Marine Corps aircrews. DACT places aircraft of different types against each other in simulated combat with the goal of providing realistic training and sharp­­ening the ability of American aircrews to counter peer or near-peer threats. For this training to be successful, the ad­versary needs to present an authentic opponent, and adversary pilots need to be expert in the employment of “red” tactics as well as their own.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, following losses in the skies over Vietnam, the Air Force and Navy began to develop and implement more intentional air combat training as they stood up their adversary squadrons. In the 1980s, as the Marine Corps adopted the F-18 Hornet, a fourth- generation fighter, the need arose for those Marine aircrews to train against a peer or near-peer adversary, and VMFT-401 was created. The first aircraft to come to the squadron were F-21 Kfirs from Israel. The Israeli pilots worked closely with the Marines of the squadron to integrate the aircraft, and the pilots trained with Navy and Air Force adver­sary units. In 1989, the squadron tran­sitioned to the F-5 Tiger, a simple but robust aircraft capable of Mach 2 with a service ceiling of 50,000 feet.\n\nLucky Sniper Pilots\n\nToday, VMFT-401 flies many types of missions with the F-5, all in support of the Fleet Marine Force. Though they focus heavily on air-to-air combat train­ing, the Lucky Snipers also fly sorties to train ground defense units to hone their aircraft detection and neutralization skills, help train rotary-wing aircrew to counter air-to-air threats, and aid in the develop­ment of training programs. “Our job is to keep the Marine Corps from fight­ing the last war,” said Lieutenant Colonel Eric Scherrer, commanding officer of VMFT-401. “We don’t know exactly the enemy that we’re going to fight next, and we don’t know exactly what they’re going to do. That’s where I come in. I study that enemy.\n\nAnd so when I go, when I provide fleet support to squadrons across the Marine Corps, I’m going to fight them in a way that one of our peer or near-peer adversaries will fight.” As the Marine Corps’ only squadron dedicated to acting as the opposing force in simulated air combat, VMFT-401 most often provides support for Marine fighter/attack squad­rons, fleet replacement squadrons, and for large scale exercises, like Weapons and Tactics Instructor Course and Marine Division Tactics Course.\n\nA defining feature of the unit is their wealth of experience, which greatly en­hances their ability to carry out this mis­sion. Each of the pilots is seasoned, hav­ing already flown multiple tours in the fleet. “There are so many deployments in the squadron. I don’t know how many combat tours or real-world tours that we all have,” said Major Joel Adolphson, a pilot with VMFT-401. “And the goal is to use our experience, our knowledge, to better train the fleet. There are thousands of hours of experience between everybody that flies here, so we use our experience and expertise not only to accomplish their training, but also to increase the quality of their training.”\n\nPilots come to the squad­ron from all over the Marine Corps, including from the active-duty and Reserve components, integrating the individual skills and specialties they’ve developed over the course of their careers into the mission here. Major Benjamin VanWingerden, a pilot currently assigned to VMFT-401, flew the F/A-18 in Iwakuni, Japan, before coming to the Lucky Snipers. “China was one of the threats, and it definitely ramped up while I was there,” Maj VanWingerden said, “so we had quite a few briefs when I was there. I leveraged that when I got here to try to push to the local squadrons to up their training. Because we don’t want you to go out trained to a minimal threat. That’s the mentality I bring to the Snipers—give the hardest threat available even though sometimes they don’t like it. I’d rather have them survive than get shot because they’re not upping their training.”\n\nThe squadron is also unique in its manpower. Assigned to the 4th Marine Air Wing, VMFT-401 is a reserve squad­ron with a roughly even mix of active duty and reserve pilots. “All of my Reserve aircrew are also airline pilots. They’re very, very good aviators,” said LtCol Scherrer. “They add a lot of safety and a lot of maturity to the squadron, and experience that you wouldn’t always have. So, I see it as a great gift.”\n\nKnowledge of Tactics\n\nAdversary squadrons, and VMFT-401 in particular, are characterized by a deep knowledge of the tactics of peer and near-peer threats. This knowledge is acquired through study and experience. The pilots not only need to know red tactics, they need to be able to employ them in order to provide formative training. “I’m very fortunate because all of our pilots are very experienced. They’ve done at least one full fleet tour before they come to us. So, they’re very well versed in blue tactics, and they’re very experienced in the airplane.” said Scherrer. “They have to learn how to fly the F-5, but they already know blue tactics, and they already have a basic understanding of what red tactics are. Then it’s just a matter of taking them from the blue side and indoctrinating them into the red.”\n\nTo become expert in red tactics, every pilot goes through further advanced train­ing to hone their adversary abilities, usual­ly including either the adversary course at the Navy Fighter Weapons School, more commonly known as TOPGUN, or through Marine Corps Weapons and Tactics Instructors Course, where they’ll serve as adversary mission commanders. Each of the pilots also be­comes a subject matter expert in a relevant field. “We’re very closely tied in with the 64th Aggres­sor Squadron out of Nellis Air Force Base,” said Scherrer. “They’re really the red adversary subject matter experts. Every one of our pilots goes up there to be a subject matter expert in every­thing from doctrine, to aircraft and missiles, to tactics. So, everyone that’s here, including myself, goes to train in that capacity.”\n\nAfter becoming a subject matter expert in a particular area, whether it’s a specific aircraft or weapons system, each of 401’s pilots can pass that knowledge on to others in the squadron and share it with other squadrons. They provide presenta­tions on their area of expertise to pilots in the fleet and use this expertise to en­hance the realism of their training scenarios. “Rarely do we have a vanilla problem for them to solve. Most of them are very difficult, especially for the weapons course,” said Maj Adolphson. “It’s extremely difficult sometimes, so that they’re better prepared when they actually go do the real thing, if that does happen.”\n\nThe scenarios themselves are not difficult just for the sake of being challenging. It’s all directed toward the formation of top-of-the-line combat aviators. The squadron’s pilots use their knowledge to hone the abilities of air­crews and provide them with training experiences to call back to in the future.\n\n“Sometimes people say ‘red punishes blue mistakes.’ If blue wins every time, no questions asked, what will be masked by that overall win are execution errors or things that they could have done better. If somebody is always telling you you’re doing a great job, naturally you’re going to think you’re doing a great job, and you might get a little lax in your execution,” said LtCol Michael Webb, VMFT-401 executive officer. “Maybe we’re going to go to combat someday and that’s going to bite you. So, I see us as the best way to not critique blue verbally, but to give them critiques of themselves. And to build confidence in their airframe, con­fidence in their weapons systems, and an understanding of what they can and can’t do well. It’s our job to kind of pick at that perspective that they have, figure out ways to beat them so they eventually fix that gap and then they’re unbeatable.”\n\nMaintainers\n\nThe pilots aren’t the only ones at VMFT-401 with a wealth of experience and expertise. The squadron’s maintainers are civilian contractors, many of whom have been working with the squadron’s F-5s for well over 20 years. “We’ve still got maybe 12 or 15 guys that have been here since 1989,” said Marcel Gaud, who has been a maintainer with VMFT-401 since July 1987. He and the other main­tainers credit much of their success to this longevity. They’re experts with the airframe, and they work well as a team, drawing on each other’s strengths to keep the squadron flying. Like many of the other maintainers, Gaud is a veteran Marine, having served with VMAT-102 from 1983-1986 in the same hangar he works in today. “It’s longevity … most of us are Marines here. I really think that that has something to do with it. Most of us are former jarheads, and we have the bar pretty high.” Many of the maintainers are also able to cross-train in positions besides their own and qualify to operate in positions besides their reg­ular spe­cialty. Their work ex­ceeds expectations, and it allows the squad­ron to keep up an incredible mission capable rate for their aircraft. This isn’t taken for granted by the Marines of the squadron, and the pilots acknowledge the maintainers’ skill as integral to their success. “Our aircraft health is very good,” said LtCol Webb. “We can have a pretty robust flight schedule because we have such a good maintenance foot­print.” VMFT-401 hasn’t had a mishap since 1995, in part because of the dedica­tion and expertise of the maintainers. “I’ve seen some amazing things done by just a group of six or seven of us,” said Gaud. “I’m very proud of the work we do here.”\n\nF-5 Tiger\n\nThough the F-5 Tiger isn’t a fifth-gen­eration fighter, it lends itself incredibly well to an adversary role for fifth-genera­tion fighters like the F-35. In addition to the exceptional skill the pilots have for mimicking adversaries, the Tiger is a platform for a handful of technologies that contribute to effective and safe train­ing. One of these, the Tactical Combat Training System, or TCTS, allows pilots to track other aircraft in the training exercise through a TCTS pod mounted on each aircraft. The pilots also have access to “RedNet,” which is tied in to the TCTS system. RedNet allows for the real time tracking of any aircraft carrying a TCTS pod, increasing situational aware­ness and precision during training scenarios, but it also allows for playback. This is a valuable tool because it gives pilots an opportunity to debrief where and how they made their good shots on “blue” aircraft, enhancing the depth of understanding pilots have of their tactics, and helping them to refine their training scenarios. The enhanced situational aware­ness also creates a safer training environment in what can become very dynamic and crowded airspace.\n\nAnd the Lucky Snipers love what they do. “It’s almost like this finishing school for not just red air, but for being a proficient aviator,” said Webb. “VMFT-401 is everything I ever wanted in a fight­er squadron. And we don’t have a gun, we don’t have any missiles, we don’t drop any bombs, but we get to do the fun stuff. All we do is dogfight; fight other people, fight each other, plan these large force exercises and go out and execute, and we have such a good enlisted component here. This is an awesome place to be.”\n\nAdversary units have an increased relevance as the Marine Corps looks toward the future. Later this year, VMFT-402 will be activated at MCAS Beaufort in South Carolina, increasing the avail­ability of adversary training to squadrons across the fleet. The aircraft will also continue to develop with new tech­nologies being integrated to provide the most realistic training available. And the Marines of VMFT-401 will continue to study, train, and perfect their role as red air, all with one goal in mind. “Just trying to polish the diamond, right?” Webb said. “That’s what we’re trying to do—to make them that much better so that the first time they see something in combat, they’ll realize they’ve seen it before. We’re just here to make the fleet better combat aviators in any way we can.”\n\nAuthor’s note: Special thank you to LtCol Eric Scherrer and the Marines and civilians of VMFT-401 and MCAS Yuma for their assistance with this article.\n\nAuthor’s bio: Patrick Reed is a historian and graduate of Abilene Christian Uni­versity. He has a particular interest in the Marine Corps and Marine Corps history and travels to speak with World War II veterans about their experiences.\n\nBy June 15, 1944, the Central Pacific drive of the United States had inexorably pushed the Japanese back toward their homeland. Throughout the methodical island-hopping campaign, the Japanese had put up stiff resistance, fighting furiously on the sea, on land, and in the air. Unlike the Marines, who had developed a combined arms team that included infantry weapons, artillery, and tanks as well as naval gunfire and close air support, the Japanese failed to integrate all their available weapons. Noticeably absent was any significant use of tanks or armor. That would all change with the invasion of the Mariana Islands.\n\nThe 2nd and 4th Marine Divisions landed on Saipan on June 15. Japanese artillery and mortars were hidden on the heights overlooking the beaches. Small, local counterattacks attempted to push back the invaders. But the Marines’ com­bined arms teams dealt with each piecemeal attack. Despite more than 3,000 casualties and gains of less than a mile inland, in some places less than three hundred yards, the Marines had a solid foothold on the island. By evening, the Army’s 27th Infantry Division was landing.\n\nOn D-day, the men of Lieutenant Colonel William K. Jones’ 1st Battalion, 6th Marines, came ashore on the extreme left flank of the invasion force. Known as “Willie K” by Marines, Jones led his men inland beyond the beaches, where the bulk of enemy forces were entrenched, passing a radio station with its tall tower a few hundred yards from the beach.\n\nThe Japanese use of tanks on the first day was disjointed and uncoordinated. At about noon, four unsupported light tanks attacked the boundary between 1st and 2nd Battalions, 6th Marines. “Amtanks,” Marine amphibious infantry support vehicles mounted with a cannon, destroyed three of the Japanese tanks.\n\nDuring that first night, Japanese sail­ors attempted a small landing with a few amphibious tanks on the left flank of 2ndMarDiv. It was defeated by the combined arms of the Marines, in part due to a new weapon, the 2.36-inch rocket launcher, which would later be nicknamed the bazooka. The Japanese also carried out frequent infantry attacks that night, probing and pushing for weaknesses to exploit. Artill­ery, naval gunfire, tanks and 75mm guns mounted on halftracks supported the Marine infantry, and by morning there were over 700 Japanese dead near 2ndMarDiv and hundreds more in 4thMarDiv’s sector.\n\nThe next day, Jones’ battalion continued to carve out the island’s terrain, flanked by 2/2 under Major Howard Rice. The men of 1/6 made way for the remainder of the 2nd Marine Regiment to land.\n\nThat night, both Marine divisions formed tight perimeters and prepared for a Japanese counterattack. Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Saito, the commander of the Japanese army on Saipan, issued an order for the 136th Infantry Regiment and the 9th Tank Regiment to “attack the enemy in the direction of Oreal (Charon Kanoa Airfield) with its full force.” In “Saipan: The Beginning of the End” by Carl W. Hoffman, Saito described the plan: “The tank unit will advance SW of Hill 164.6 after the attack unit [the infantry] has commenced the attack. The tank unit will charge the transmitting station and throw the enemy into disorder before the penetration of the attack unit into this sector.” Then, the Japanese 1st Yokosuka Special Naval Landing Force would attack from the north, parallel to the beach, to capture the Charon Kanoa Airfield, which was well behind Marine lines. One Japanese NCO noted, “Our plan would seem to be to annihilate the enemy by morning.”\n\nThis time, the Japanese had between thirty and forty tanks. Most were medium Type 97 Kai Shinhoto Chi-Ha vehicles armed with a 47mm main gun and a couple of machine guns. A few were the smaller Type 95 Ha-Go armed with a 37mm main gun and two machine guns.\n\nThe tanks gave away their presence moving into their attack positions. The Marines heard the sounds of their en­gines, as well as the chanting and shout­ing of Japanese infantry, early in the evening. Due to poor coordination, the Japanese attack didn’t begin until 3:30 a.m. and the Marines were ready.\n\nCaptain C.G. Rollen called for armored support as the enemy tanks approached the front line of Company B, 1/6. A pla­toon of M4A2 tanks from Company A, Second Tank Bn, and a section of the halftracks were dispatched to support the infantrymen. Rollen called for artillery and naval gunfire support. The Navy provided an almost constant supply of star shells, turning the night into an eerie bright daylight.\n\nCorrespondent Robert Sherrod, in his book “On to Westward,” quoted one Marine who said: “The [Japanese] would halt, then jump out of their tanks. Then they would sing songs and wave swords. Finally, one of them would blow a bugle, jump back into the tanks, if they hadn’t been hit already. Then we would let them have it with a bazooka.”\n\nMajor James A. Donovan Jr. executive officer of 1/6, noted: “Many of the tanks were ‘unbuttoned,’ [with their turrets open,] the crew chief directing from the top of his open turret. Some were being led by a crew member afoot. They seemed to come in two waves, carrying foot troops on the long engine compartment or clustered around the turret, holding on to the handrail. Some even had machine guns or grenade throwers set up on the tank.” Marine artillery and machine guns stripped away their infantry support. Then the infantry Marines took over.\n\nThe armor of the Japanese light and medium tanks was so thin that, in many cases, Marine antitank rounds went com­pletely through them. Several Japanese tankers became disoriented as star shells and tracers lit up the darkness. They strayed into nearby swamps and were immobilized, making them easy targets for the Marines.\n\nDonovan recalled, “The battle evolved itself into a madhouse of noise, tracers, and flashing lights. As tanks were hit and set afire, they silhouetted other tanks coming out of the flickering shadows to the front or already on top of the squads.” Marine infantrymen hunkered down in their foxholes as some of the enemy tanks managed to reach the front-line positions.\n\nJones related in a June 1988 Leatherneck article, “One tank, leaking oil heavily, soaked a Marine as it passed over his foxhole. Another Marine, also lying low in his foxhole until a tank passed over him, jumped out and stuck a coconut log in its bogey wheels. The tank spun in circles. And when the bewildered tank commander opened his turret top to see what was going on, the Marine jumped on top and hurled a thermite grenade into the open turret. The tank blew up like a volcano.”\n\nAs the battle grew in ferocity, Rollen was injured by the concussion of a near miss. Jones ordered Captain Norman K. Thomas, the Headquarters Company com­mander, to take over the command. Oddly enough, Thomas had earned a Silver Star on Tarawa in relief of Rollen there. Now, as Thomas advanced, he was struck and killed by fire from a Japanese tank. Sergeant Dean Squires saw the captain fall. He shot the Japanese vehicle commander and placed a demolition charge on its back deck—the resulting explosion disabled the tank.\n\nCorporal Donald Watson threw two phosphorous grenades on the back deck of a tank passing by his foxhole, then shot the crew as they exited the burning vehicle. Despite machine-gun fire from another tank, he retrieved a wounded comrade who was stranded in the midst of the enemy tanks. He would be awarded the Navy Cross.\n\nTwo other Marines were awarded Navy Crosses by knocking out seven tanks with seven rockets. Private First Class Charles D. Merritt and PFC Herbert J. Hodges moved into the open, dodging from left to right and back again. Both were untouched by enemy tank and in­fantry fire.\n\nPrivate Robert S. Reed used his rocket launcher to hit four Japanese tanks. After he ran out of rockets, he mounted a Japa­nese tank and put it out of action with a grenade down the hatch. PFCs John Kounk and Horace Narveson stalked the enemy tanks. Ultimately, they scored hits on three tanks with four rockets.\n\nMachine-gun squad leader, Sergeant Alex Smith, frustrated that the bullets of his guns bounced off the tanks’ armor, left his Marines and moved into the open. Using the grenade launcher mounted on his carbine, he disabled three tanks in quick succession.\n\nJapanese artillery attempted to silence the Marine artillery instead of concen­trating on the Marine front-line positions. This let the infantry Marines concentrate on the enemy assault. Marine artillerymen suffered many casualties but continued firing.\n\nDuring the action, Donovan noted, “The Japanese tanks … appeared con­fused. As their guides and crew chiefs were hit by Marine rifle and machine gun fire, what little control they had was lost. They ambled in the general direction of the beach, getting hit again and again until each one burst into flame or turned aimless circles only to stop when hit.”\n\nAs daylight spread across the battle­field, Marine tanks and halftracks ad­vanced into the area, finishing off many of the derelict enemy vehicles. By 7 a.m., the attack was over. Only one Japanese tank remained in action, but it rolled away into the hills. A call for naval gun­fire brought down a barrage of 5-inch gunfire from a destroyer, which turned the tank into a smoking pyre. Despite the long night, Jones’ Marines began the day’s attack at 7:30 a.m.\n\nIf all the claims of destroyed tanks were added up, including those of the infantry, antitank guns, tanks, and half­tracks, they would have equaled over 50 tanks. After the battle, 2ndMarDiv ob­servers counted 31 metal carcasses. Perhaps a thousand Japanese men were dead. Jones was circumspect, stating that if the Japanese attack on June 17 had been successful, it “would have been fatal to the division’s fighting efficiency.”\n\nFor the rest of the campaign, Japanese tanks were used only in small numbers, the largest armored attack occurred on June 24, when tanks of Co C, 2nd Tank Bn, destroyed seven Japanese tanks near the town of Garapan.\n\nSlowly, relentlessly, the Marines and soldiers conquered the island. Airfields were secured, allowing B-29s to bomb Japan. The only major counterattack was a banzai charge on July 7, the largest in the Pacific Island campaigns, of 4,000 bedraggled Japanese soldiers, sailors, and civilians without armored support. They smashed through front-line positions but were ultimately killed. The campaign for Saipan ended with the island declared secure on July 9.\n\nIn Oscar Gilbert’s book “Marine Tank Battles in the Pacific,” the commander of the Marine tanks, Captain Ed Bale, talked about credit for the destruction: “The argument has never been settled who destroyed the Japanese tanks, whether B Company [2nd] Tank Battal­ion or whether Weapons Company, 6th Marines did.” Sherrod gave credit to the infantrymen in an article for Leatherneck: “But most of the [Japanese] tanks were knocked out by infantrymen … who declined to get panicky. They waited in their foxholes until the moment was right, then they let go with bazookas or with antitank grenades. Some of them sat in their holes until the tanks rolled over and past them. Then they aimed at the weaker rear armor.” Ultimately it was the individual Marine, acting as part of the combined arms team, that defeated the Japanese in the Pacific.\n\nGeneral Thomas Watson, commanding general of 2ndMarDiv, surveyed the destruction around 1/6 and pronounced, “I don’t think we have to fear [Japanese] tanks anymore. We’ve got their number.” The general was right; the Japanese never tried a large-scale tank assault in the Pacific.\n\nAuthor’s bio: MSgt Jeff Dacus, USMCR (Ret) is a retired Marine tanker.

Out of the side door emerged an elderly gentleman, hunched over, his physical frame sharply contrasted by the fierce resolve propelling him forward. Protruding from his bowed head was a red hat emblazoned with a vibrant yellow USMC.\n\nHis eyes rose to meet mine as I introduced myself and he waved his hand for me to follow him. The 82-year-old man was named James, and he told me he had been a recruit at Parris Island in 1959. He had dreamed of coming to Belleau Wood for over six decades. With his health in decline, it was now or never. Earlier in the day, James and his wife walked through Belleau Wood with the intent of “walking in the footsteps of those heroes from 1918.” James was adamant that their day end with a visit to the “devil dog” fountain.\n\nIt was clear there was a lot riding on this moment, and he wanted it to unfold exactly as he envisioned. We walked to the iron gate, and after a woman from the local museum had unlocked it, James slowly pushed it open with his cane. He beckoned his wife to join us, and the three of us walked into the old farmyard. When he saw the fountain, James whispered, “It all makes sense.\n\nThis is why we are the devil dogs. I knew we earned this title from the Germans in World War I, but now it all makes sense. I’m here because I’m a Marine.”\n\nJames hobbled toward the fountain. His wife held his right arm, stabilizing him as he leaned forward to position his head near the water trickling out of the dog’s mouth. He removed his hat, closed his eyes, and craned his neck to drink from the fountain. He paused with his eyes closed, then turned to his wife and said, “I’m done. It’s complete.” His face was splashed with water droplets. He shuffled back to the van and climbed into his seat. After a few minutes, his wife joined him and we waved goodbye as the van drove up the hill. I was left to ponder what I had witnessed—and to reflect on James’ words, which seemed to imbue a profound sense of meaning. He hinted at a lifetime of reasons that motivated him to make a pilgrimage to Belleau Wood and the bulldog fountain.\n\nThe fountain positioned him in a line of continuity existing within a sacred landscape. It reaffirmed an overarching narrative that as an individual Marine, James existed inside the collective. He and the Corps were one.\n\nI’m here because I’m a Marine.\n\nHistory of the Fountain\n\nThe Marine Corps has long understood the power of place and the importance of inculcating a sense of connection to hallowed ground. Servicemembers of all branches are tied to particular places, but Marines are collectively tied to the same places: Belleau Wood, Iwo Jima, Chosin Reservoir, Khe Sanh, Fallujah. This list of sacred places includes the devil dog fountain, which has become synonymous with Belleau Wood. However, because Marines were never in this exact location in 1918, the site’s prominence is not grounded in historical events. Rather, it emerged from the confluence of geo­graphic proximity to Belleau Wood, in­dividual and group identity, rituals and rites of passage, personal relationships, devotion, and collective memory. The site is an exemplar of how once-insignifi­cant places can evolve into pilgrimage sites—and of the symbiotic relationship that emerges between sacred sites and pilgrims.\n\nThe fountain is located inside the vil­lage of Belleau on private property, formerly the 16th century chateau built for the Graimberg family. The current owners are descendants of Alphonse Paillet, who, in 1842, purchased the chateau, along with most of the hunting preserve known as Belleau Wood. Paillet sold Belleau Wood to the Belleau Wood Memorial Association in 1923, and it was dedicated as a shrine to the American Expeditionary Force. The family retained the chateau ruins and have been an in­tegral part of the growth of pilgrimages to the site. The fountain is sourced by a spring-fed aquifer that supplies water to the entire area.\n\nThe sculpted bronze bull­dog head is more accurately a Dogue of Bordeaux, a hunting breed that gained popularity in France in the mid-to-late 19th century. This particular fountain was used inside the farm area of the chateau grounds and is an unlikely struc­ture to emerge as a sacred site. However, its proximity to the battlefield and the significance of the bulldog coalesced into the birth of a Marine Corps shrine. Visits to this shrine are a relatively recent phe­nom­e­non, as Marines were not in the village of Belleau during WW I. There is a possibility that a Marine may have been held as a prisoner of war or treated in the German first aid station under the chateau. But, despite this, there are no accounts of Marines drinking from the fountain during the war.\n\nThe historic silence on the topic of the bulldog fountain is conspicuous given its current prominence. It is particularly noteworthy because of the number of fountains established by Americans as living memorials after WW I, such as the fountain on Belleau’s main road that is dedicated to the memory of soldiers from Pennsylvania who died in Belleau Wood. There is no mention of our foun­tain in the writings about Belleau visits to in­clude the 1920 Knights of Columbus pil­grimage, the dedication of Belleau Wood in 1923, or the 1929 reconstruction of the church that also serves as the U.S. Army 26th “Yankee” Division memorial.\n\nBrigadier General James Harbord, USA was incensed by the location of this memorial and released a number of press statements asserting that Belleau Wood belonged to the Marines. Had the fountain been important to the Marines, this would have been a perfect time to emphasize their connection not only to Belleau Wood but to the village of Belleau. Gold Star Mothers also visited the area as part of the U.S. government funded pilgrimages of 1930-1933, and there are no written or photographic rec­ords of them visiting this particular fountain.\n\nAfter World War II, veterans of both wars continued visiting the area, and the Yankee Division veterans again paid for repairs to the church, which was rededicated in 1953. Also visiting during this time was 20th Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Lemuel Shepherd. He was concerned that people were for­getting the contributions of Marines in Belleau Wood and initiated a plan to erect a monument, which was dedicated in 1955. It seems likely that Shepherd, along with other dignitaries, would have paid a visit to the fountain had there been an established Marine Corps connection to the site. The following decades reflect a similar lack of attention.\n\nBased on testimonies from Belleau res­idents and press pieces from the 1980s, it was sometime during this decade that Marines began to visit the village of Belleau and the fountain as an extension to Belleau Wood itineraries. In the November 1988 issue of Marine Corps Gazette, author Agostino von Hassell described Marines visiting the devil dog fountain and proposed an interesting rationale for why Marines were connected to the village of Belleau. He referenced an account wherein the Germans oc­cupied Belleau in 1914 and encountered the “Hounds of Belleau” inside the cha­teau. During the subsequent fighting in June 1918, the Germans recalled their first skirmish in Belleau, which resulted in the devil dogs moniker. On July 15, 1990, Boston Globe sportswriter Bud Collins asserted that the Marines had bivouacked in the former farmyard of the chateau during the war. This is par­ticularly interesting given the fact that the date of Collins’ visit to the location corresponded to the dates in 1918 when the Yankee Division liberated the village.\n\nDespite the historical inaccuracy of the Marines’ connection to Belleau, both authors linked fragmented pieces into one integrated framework. From this point, the village of Belleau was sub­sumed into the Belleau Wood narrative and fused together as one place within the collective memory of the area. This is illustrated by a conversation I had with a veteran Marine visiting Belleau Wood, who stopped me to inquire about the location of the fountain inside the woods. This man had actually been at the foun­tain and inside Belleau Wood in the early 1990s with a group from The Basic School but had forgotten the sites were geo­graphically separated. At some point in the decades following his visit, his in­dividual memory of the fountain’s lo­cation had merged with the collective memory of Belleau Wood.\n\nWhile Belleau Wood had been hallowed ground since 1918, the subsummation of Belleau into Belleau Wood was cemented by 31st Commandant General Charles Krulak during his 1997 and 1998 visits. Gen Krulak’s personal connections to the area ran deep—he grew up hearing about the battle from his godfather, General Holland Smith, who had seen action at Belleau Wood—and these visits sacralized the oneness of the landscape in four significant ways. First, he chose the battlefield as the setting for the 222nd Marine Corps Birthday film. Like a prophet standing in the wheatfield, with one arm seemingly reaching back to WW I-era Marines and the other arm extended to future generations, Gen Krulak passionately spoke of continuity, identity, and shared vision. He also ef­fectively used water as a connective motif by saying Belleau Wood was “like a river that runs through all Marines and all Frenchmen … rippling through our souls, renewing us, sustaining us and fortifying us for the trials to come.”\n\nSec­ondly, Gen Krulak was photographed drinking directly from the devil dog fountain, giving a visual template for how future Marines would engage with the site. Third, he referenced his visit to Belleau Wood as a “pilgrimage of great personal meaning” and emphasized the importance of reenacting the journey of the 1918 Marines. Lastly, Gen Krulak acknowledged the local residents by presenting the fountain landowners with a Certificate of Appreciation, a powerful indicator of the importance the Corps placed on the site.\n\nCurrent Practices at the Fountain\n\nThe devil dog fountain’s emergence as a sacred site is concurrent to the growth of pilgrimages worldwide. The practices there mirror those at other sacred sites involving wells or fountains. These places are often associated with healing properties, miracles, or divine connections, which makes them focal points for spiritual practices and pil­grimages. Pilgrims and visitors come to these wells seeking physical, emotional, or spiritual well-being and either ingest the water or immerse themselves in it. Over time, stories and legends associated with such fountains get passed down through generations.\n\nLike other sacred wells, the bulldog fountain is a center point of gathering for those who share a common identity and has become an important site for rituals and rites of passage, including reenlistments, promotions, and retire­ments. Moreover, the fountain shares another characteristic with other pilgrim­age sites: an element of challenge or dif­ficulty to access. The courtyard gate is locked and knowing how to access the key becomes part of the experience and affirms a sense of exclusivity.\n\nI spoke to a Marine sergeant who told me she had waited her entire life to be at the fountain. The fact that she was sta­tioned in Europe was a dream come true, and being at the fountain was her sign that she was in the right place at the right time. She attributed her good fortune and life trajectory to the Marine Corps and was eager to send photos to her family and friends to show them how she made it to the fountain, knowing how proud they would be.\n\nAnother Marine I spoke to, a captain who was a prior enlisted Marine, told me being at the fountain reminded him of the yellow footsteps at PI and how he was walking in the footsteps of Marines from 1918 and taking his place among all Marines. He said that he felt a great deal of responsibility to honor the Marines of the past.\n\nIt is customary for Marines to drink directly from the fountain rather than filling a canteen or bottle to drink from. Either during the initial drink or the subsequent one, most Marines are photo­graphed in the same pose as Krulak in 1998. If they are part of a group, they will often flank the fountain for a photo. These photos are subsequently posted on social media with the hashtag #BelleauWood, further cementing the oneness of the two places.\n\nThe water’s meaning has evolved over time, too. Marines drinking from the fountain in the 1990s focused on the power of the water to extend one’s pro­fessional life in the Corps. Now, it is said that the water extends one’s physical life for 20 years. It is also considered the ele­ment that links all Marines to one another. Marines drink the water for those at Belleau Wood, for the current Marines, and for future Marines. Many Marines report taking home bottles of water from the bulldog fountain in the same man­ner as pilgrims do from other sacred wells. These bottles are treasured arti­facts that form part of a collection that may include sand from Iwo Jima or one of the Normandy beaches.\n\nNot all visitors coming to the fountain are Marines; others such as civilians and non-USMC servicemembers frequent the site. U.S. Army and National Guard personnel visiting the fountain often recount contested battle histories and the evolving collective memory of the war. In many ways, this reinforces the foun­tain’s status as a pilgrimage site—con­tested narratives always characterize such places. The long-standing inter­service rivalry between the Marine Corps and the Army is also a point of dialogue, with a particular emphasis on WW I. Soldiers often remark that the Marines were never in that location and jest that they will post photos in front of the foun­tain on social media with messages re­lated to historical accuracy.\n\nThere is also a sense that the Marine Corps has system­atically removed the Army’s presence in the Belleau Wood narrative, and one soldier told me that the Corps was “doing what Marines do and making everything about themselves.” Soldiers visiting the fountain who know about the Yankee Division’s liberation of the village of Belleau also recount the actions of July 1918. In addition, they point out the weather­ vane on top of the nearby barn, which depicts a Yankee Division soldier with his boot permanently kicking east, symbolizing pushing the Germans out of Belleau.\n\nThere is also a local impact resulting from the prominence of the site. The museum across the street, opened in 2008, retains the key for gate access and now has vessels for the water, similar to other holy wells like Lourdes. Local guides have incorporated a stop at the fountain as part of battlefield itineraries in the area. The fountain landowners re­main central to the site and fund ongoing maintenance and access for ceremonies and cultivate personal connections with the diplomatic and military communities in France.\n\nMemorial Day\n\nThe steady stream of Marines visiting the Belleau area rises to a groundswell during the Memorial Day weekend. There is a growing list of ceremonies for the weekend occurring across multiple sites, to include the German cemetery and the village church where a Catholic mass is held on Saturday evening. The recent inclusion of Marine Corps participation in this service is conspicuous due to its overtly religious nature, indicative of the evolution of pilgrimages in Belleau.\n\nDuring the 2023 service, there were con­tributions by French clergy members, local residents, and American military dignitaries. During the sermon, the priest referenced “martyr Marines” who died in Belleau Wood, which is interesting given the fact that the church itself is a memorial for the Yankee Division. During this service, Marines inhabit a space that was paid for by the sacrifices of their brothers-in-arms in the Yankee Division. For the locals, though, these Marines seem to personify the names of the war dead flanking the church walls. The Yankee Division soldiers, who lib­erated the village of Belleau, seem to have been reborn as Marines, a nod to the Corps’ powerful influence on the collective memory of the area in WW I.\n\nOn Sunday, the culminating ceremony, infused with grand military pageantry, occurs at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery. Similar ceremonies take place at all American Battle Monuments Com­mission cemeteries in France and all of them include military representation. However, the ceremony at Aisne-Marne is palpably “Marine Corps” in choreog­raphy, presence, and tenor. The list of distinguished guests continues to grow and is evidence of the increasing impor­tance ascribed to the ceremony by French military and government officials. More­over, the German Army has a burgeoning presence, and several German soldiers I spoke to shared that they were there to honor the war dead of “our allies” and focus on reconciliation.\n\nThe Marine Corps understands the power of place, and the Memorial Day ceremony demonstrates a superior grasp of symbolism, ritual and narrative. Cere­mony attendees from many countries fill the parade ground, and their gazes are initially fixed on the Memorial Chapel, ascending as a stark reminder of the human costs of war. Behind the chapel is Belleau Wood. Prior to the start of last year’s ceremony, visitors watched the Commandant and Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps descending from Belleau Wood, shoulder to shoulder with the Chief of Staff of the French Army and a German Brigadier General. Not only was this a powerful symbol of reconciliation between former enemies, it was also a reminder that the Marine Corps, which had been untested in the conflicts of WW I, matured inside the primordial darkness of Belleau Wood and emerged victorious.\n\nThe speeches given by dignitaries men­tioned the sacrifice and loss of life in WW I. This reality was made more poig­nant by the setting, which includes over 2,200 graves of servicemembers who died during the war. Death and burial are tangible at places like this, and the proximity of the cemetery to the battlefield creates an immediate sense of the gravitas of the toll of war. The entire Memorial Day ceremony was a well-choreographed display of order, dis­cipline, and precision that sharply con­trasted the chaos and carnage of 1918.\n\nAs the ceremony ended, hundreds of attendees made a procession through the town, down the main street, and into the courtyard for a reception at the devil dog fountain. Like other pilgrimage processions, an amalgam of people moved together toward the sacred site. It was even more remarkable given the blending of military ranks within close proximity, which would not occur in any other set­ting. The climactic event was Gen David H. Berger’s arrival at the fountain, where he gave a speech thanking the local hosts, allies, and partners and mentioning the “sacrifices of those who fought here at Belleau Wood.” He posed for a photo with the other generals, who represented the military alliance amongst the United States, France and Germany. He re­enlisted a Marine during the reception as well.\n\nMemorial Day weekend is also about the local inhabitants, often silent stake­holders in the pilgrimage saga of Belleau Wood and Belleau. During this weekend, the Belleau locals are co-creators of the experience; they renew personal relation­ships with Marines and other visitors and have a sense of agency in decision-mak­ing about the ceremonies. This agency is increasingly important as the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The added notoriety and people visiting these sites impacts the locals and, like other pilgrimage sites around the world, their voices are often marginalized. Many of the families have lived in the area since before WW I, and they have their own strong attachments to the sites. These attachments often reflect a dif­ferent type of priority, function, and meaning than for American pilgrims and visitors. During the Memorial Day week­end, the locals also host Marines in their homes, and the relationships forged over decades are treasured by all involved. Finally, the fountain landowners have the opportunity to remind visitors of their benevolence and hospitality, while also ensuring a seat at the table regarding the future of the fountain.\n\nThe Hero’s Journey\n\nThe Marines fighting in Belleau Wood in 1918 engaged in a hero’s journey mir­rored by an archetypal psychological process. They left their ordinary world for a call to adventure and reached a place known as “Hellwood.” After fighting with the enemy inside this Hell, they were bruised and battered; many were dead. The survivors emerged and returned home with the elixir of victory. Their reality set the stage for a new type of journey: walking in their footsteps through reenactment. Such reenactments began as early as 1919 as pilgrims flocked to Belleau Wood to follow in the footsteps of the heroes. And it was important for them to retrace the steps exactly as the events unfolded in June of 1918. However, the reenactments could only reach the resurrection stage of the archetypal Hero’s Journey through the practice of calling to memory the Marines and their actions—they could not return with the elixir of victory as their forebears had.\n\nGen Krulak tapped into this need for the completion of the quest in his 1997 video. He provided a pilgrimage template as he moved from the wheatfield into the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, while recalling the people and events of the battle. He was then photographed at the devil dog fountain drinking direct­ly from the source of the water. This imagery sent a powerful message that pilgrimages were a sanctioned part of the Marine Corps experience and further cultivated the idea that places connected to the Corps could be spoken of in overt­ly spiritual terms. His use of the water motif provided further language to de­scribe how Marines are connected to hallowed ground and that there is a life force that fuses all Marines together. The fact that the water originates from the same source as it did in 1918 carries deep spiritual significance. And Krulak’s language around renewal and rebirth set the stage for a shrine that could be visited and revisited by future generations of Marines seeking exactly that.\n\nFor James, the 82-year-old Marine vet­eran, his visit to the devil dog fountain was a moment of completion to the nar­rative of his life that opened at Parris Island. He was looking to reaffirm his place within the collective, and it must have been reassuring to know that the memory of past generations of Marines lives on at sites like Belleau Wood. In knowing this, there is the comfort that he will not be forgotten. He had walked the battlefield and communed with the Marines of 1918—and the last step was that he needed to ingest the water from the sacred fountain. Within the fusion of the individual with the collective, I am here because we were here is inter­changeable with we are here because I am here. “Here” is Belleau Wood, which now includes Belleau—their oneness understood through how average places evolve into sacred spaces through their relationship with pilgrims.\n\nJames was a pilgrim reenacting the Hero’s Journey, and his final quest was to return home with the elixir from the devil dog fountain. He found completion, belonging, and continuity with the Ma­rines of the past and the Marines of the future. He became fused with a landscape that emerged as hallowed ground. It is quite appropriate that Belleau means “beautiful water”—and the elixir pil­grims seek is the essence of the place.\n\nAuthor’s bio: Heather A.

He spent six weeks living with the Marines and telling their stories to TV audiences back home. He developed a better understanding of what it means to be a Marine—he also developed a profound respect for these young men and the sacrifices they made. Twenty years later, Reid interviewed those Marines again. In this book he tells their inspiring stories of heroism in battle, camaraderie, patriotism and belief in the mission. Reid also writes about recovery from wounds—both physi­cal and mental—and delves into the new appreciation for life that results from post-traumatic growth. We chose to publish this excerpt in this issue because June is PTSD Aware­ness month, and hope that it reinforces the importance of speaking openly about mental health issues.

It had temporary plates and two Marine Corps stickers, one on the rear window and one on the bumper. I thought: “Isn’t that just like a Marine. He just bought the damn thing and it’s already plastered with Marine Corps stickers.”\n\nThat got me thinking about the most challenging, gratifying, jaw-dropping, and frightening story I covered in my 33 years as a journalist—the slightly less than six weeks I spent embedded with 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, dur­ing the invasion of Iraq in 2003, as a correspondent for NBC News.\n\nFor years I had thought that one day I would escape the journalism rat-race and write a book, but I hadn’t settled on a topic. “That’s it!” I thought as the pickup disappeared out of sight. For the 20th anniversary of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2023, I would write a book about the Marines of 3/5.\n\nAs I drove, I thought of questions I wanted to ask them. Where are they today and what are they doing? Do they have families? How did their lives change due to their first combat experience? (It was the first combat for almost all of them.) What did they learn as Marines that helped them prosper in civilian life? Did they struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)? What do they think about the war today?\n\nWhen I returned home, I reached out to some of the Marines I had occasionally stayed in touch with and started asking questions. I found their stories fascinating and powerful—and they were eager to tell them. They clearly did not want their service and their sacrifice to be forgotten.\n\nAt first, I thought I could get a good cross-section with about a dozen Marines, but word spread about my project and requests to be included started pouring in. Eventually I interviewed more than 40 Marines, plus several wives and grown children, whose experiences and insights were often as engrossing as those of the Marines.\n\nI was often surprised, sometimes stunned, by their honesty, how deep they reached to tell me their stories. On several occasions I heard the words “I’ve never told this to anybody who’s not a Marine, but …”\n\nI was deeply gratified that they still trusted me after all those years. Many of them talked about arriving home from Iraq and discovering that their families knew all about where they had been and what they had done because they had been glued to NBC and MSNBC, waiting for my frequent updates on their progress along the road to Baghdad.\n\nWhenever I appeared on TV, I was later told, the phone tree would “light up” with wives, mothers, and other loved ones speaking only two words before hanging up: “Chip’s on!”\n\nOf course, their passionate interest in my reports had nothing to do with me—it was because they were desperate for information about their Marines. Where were they? What were they doing? Were they in danger? Had anyone been injured—or, heaven forbid, worse? When were they coming home? They hoped to catch a glimpse of their Marine in the background of my live reports—or even better—to see and hear him in an interview. I interviewed as many Marines as I could convince NBC and MSNBC to put on the air.\n\nOne of my most prized possessions is an immense photo book with “Ma­rines” stamped on the front in gold letters. It contains dozens of letters and family photos from the Marines’ wives, girl­friends, fiancées, parents, grandparents, etc., thanking me and my crew for en­during battlefield conditions to report on their men.\n\nThis book is a tribute to the dozens of Marines I interviewed, and to everyone who served in the Iraq war. Many of the Marines I interviewed also served in Afghanistan, so I think of this book as a tribute to all who served in those wars.\n\nWorld War II and the Iraq War, of course, have very different places in American history. World War II saved the world from fascism and dictatorship. The Iraq War, by contrast, is a war that many Americans, especially young ones, know little about. Many Americans who do know about the war believe it never should have happened.\n\nI had serious reservations about the war in Iraq even before it began. But I believed then, and I believe even more strongly now, that the stories of those who fight our wars should be told. Even if a war is unpopular, even if you think it was a mistake, our men and women in uniform put their lives on the line and answered their nation’s call.\n\nIn writing a tribute to the Marines of 3/5, I believe it’s important to honor not only their service, but also their sac­ri­fice—in battle and in the two decades since. Indeed, there is quite a bit of sacri­fice in the pages that follow, including death in battle; death by tragic accident; life-changing injuries; and the whole panoply of nightmarish symptoms of PTSD. Also, of course, addiction, divorce, and suicide, which tend to plague the armed forces to a greater degree than the non-military public.\n\nBut there is also much that’s positive and life-affirming in this book: heroism in battle; the intense, life-long camara­derie among Marines; patriotism and belief in one’s mission; life-changing traits learned as Marines; and the post-traumatic growth that often follows PTSD.\n\nFor the most part, I have told the 2003 Iraq invasion story chronologically, from Kuwait to Baghdad, while interspersing that account with stories from the past 20 years about Marines who were affected by specific battles and other incidents along the way. It took only 22 days for the Marines of 3/5 to fight their way to Baghdad, but the effects on those who fought in that war have lasted two decades.\n\nAs the convoy moved toward Baghdad and the Marines came under attack almost daily, I was awed by the fact that men as young as 18 and 19 were charging forward under machine-gun fire and making instantaneous life and death decisions at an age when my biggest worries were who to take to the high school prom and what courses to take in college. I developed enormous respect for their courage and devotion to duty. That respect only increased during my time writing this book.\n\nFrom someone who doesn’t have a military bone in his body, this is my small contribution to ensuring that the service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform—even in unpopular wars—are not forgotten.\n\nMarine Families Tell Their Stories:\n\nThe Martinez Family\n\nIn early September 2003, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines came home from Iraq after a seven-month deployment. NBC News asked me to cover the homecoming of “my” battalion. I met Joe Klimovitz, who was my cameraman in Iraq, at Camp Pendleton in Southern California.\n\nWe waited for the Marines to arrive, standing with their wives, newborn babies, mothers, fathers, and other family members, who profusely thanked us for our reports. In previous wars, those with loved ones on the front lines often went weeks or months without hearing a word. With our live and taped re­ports airing multiple times every day, the families kept their televisions tuned 24/7 to MSNBC or NBC.\n\nThe Marines arrived in three waves with the last arriving at 2:30 a.m. The families of the final group had waited in a state of nervous excitement for more than eight hours. When the Marines finally got off the buses, Klimo shot video of the emotional reunions and I did interviews for stories that would air later that day.\n\nLooking at those stories years later, one of the lines I wrote stands out: “Many here say that after so long apart, getting back to normal will be hard work.” That turned out to be an enormous understatement for many of the Marines and their families, including Corporal Mike Martinez, who held his son Mike Jr., while I interviewed him and his wife Stefanie, who held their newborn son Scott.\n\nA photo of this moment is in­cluded in this book. Stefanie was overwhelmed with joy to have their family reunited, but Mike was stoic and distant. Looking at his eyes, he appears to have what is known as “the one-thousand-yard stare.”\n\nAt the time, I thought that’s just the way Marines are. They don’t like to show their emotions. And of course, he must have been physically and mentally exhausted. In fact, though, as I later learned, the ex­treme disconnectedness of some of the Marines, including Martinez, was also a sign of difficult times to come.\n\nAlmost 20 years later, I interviewed Mike and Stefanie Martinez again, this time on Zoom from their home in Califor­nia. Their son Mike Jr. is in the Air Force and joined us on Zoom from a base in Italy. Son Scott, a Midshipman at the United States Naval Academy, joined us from Annapolis, Md.\n\nMy first impression of the family on the screen in front of me was of the quintessentially happy military family—the proud father wearing a shirt with the Marine Corps eagle, globe, and anchor symbol, sitting next to his beautiful, smiling wife; the sons, Mike Jr. and Scott, both handsome young men proudly following in their father’s military foot­steps. And in fact, I was right. They are a happy family. But it took a long time, a tremendous amount of patience, and a lot of love to get to this point.\n\nMike had told me before the interview that he struggled mightily with PTSD for several years following his 2003 de­ployment in Iraq, so I approached the topic gingerly because his family was present. He told me not to worry about it. He was totally open to any question I wanted to ask. “They know 100 percent,” he said.\n\nAll four members of this courageous family were not just willing, but eager, to talk about their struggle in detail. Their hope is that other families can learn from their difficult experience. Perhaps someone else who reads this—and is driving his family to the ragged edge because of PTSD—will seek help right away, instead of putting it off for 15 agonizing years.\n\nMike said he had several symptoms of PTSD, including explosive anger. Just about anything could set him off. He had such a short fuse that his family was always “walking on eggshells.”\n\nMike Jr. said there was never any physical abuse—but the mental abuse was at times, severe. His father could explode without warning. He said it was like living with a drill instructor. “We were scared. I was always angry, hearing my dad going off on our mom. Why is he doing this? Why is he like this? I didn’t understand at the time.”\n\nYounger brother Scott said: “It was something that we just had to keep going through and endure, despite the fact that we knew it was wrong.”\n\nThere were some good times. Even some good years. “It wasn’t 24/7,” wife Stefanie said. “It would come and go in spurts.” But the bad times always seemed to return.\n\nAnger was not Mike’s only PTSD symp­tom. Many veterans with PTSD suffer from addiction. Mike’s addiction wasn’t drugs or alcohol. He medicated himself with food, gaining an enormous amount of weight and peaking at 340 pounds. That made him even more frighten­ing. Stefanie said his attitude was: “I’m big and intimidating, and I don’t care what people think.” Mike said his mindset, before he sought help, was: “This is just who I am. I’m the big bad guy. I’m right, you’re wrong.”\n\nMuch of that attitude was aimed at Stefanie, who says the hardest part was that she always doubted herself. “I always felt like there was something I did wrong. Everything I did was never right, and I couldn’t keep him happy.” She was often too frightened and confused to respond to his outbursts. “I would always shut down. I couldn’t say anything.”\n\nHer job, she said, was to try to keep peace in the household. When Mike was angry, she would sneak away to warn the boys. “Just stay away from dad, he’s in a mood,” she would tell them. “I was always protecting them so they wouldn’t get the brunt of the anger,” she told me, as her husband nodded in agreement beside her. Mike’s PTSD almost tore the family apart. “There were moments where I wanted to just give up and leave, take the kids and go,” Stefanie said. “There were many nights I cried myself to sleep because I just didn’t know what else to do. I was stuck.”\n\nShe said three things kept her going: her sons, her faith, and her commitment to helping her husband climb out of the dark hole he was in. “Don’t give up. He needs you,” she would tell herself. “You have to stay. You love him. And I do. I love him to death. And I decided, I’m going to fight for him. I have to fight for him because he’s not fighting for himself.”\n\nMike had sought help at the VA in 2007, but says they weren’t helpful at all. A nurse even told him he needed to “suck it up.” Instead, he gave up. It took him another 12 years to try again. For most people, New Year’s resolutions rarely meet with success, but on Jan. 1, 2019, Mike’s resolution was to get help. And it turned his life around.\n\nHe started seeing a therapist who guided him through his time in combat and the horrors he had witnessed, zeroing in on one particular incident—the death of Michael “Doc” Johnson, the battalion’s first fatality in 2003. For years Mike had blamed himself for Johnson’s death, even though his reasoning made little sense. This is how he explained it: “When Johnson got hit, I felt like I failed. As a forward observer my job was to call for fire, to provide support for anybody who’s in need. I broke my radio; I could not maintain communication. My one job was to maintain communications. I could not do that. Because I failed, Johnson died.”\n\nWith the help of his therapist, and the strong support of his family, he finally accepted the fact that blaming himself was absurd. “It’s the Marine Corps,” he says now. “… Things break. It was absolutely not my fault that Doc Johnson died.” That was the beginning of the end of 15 years of self-imposed torture over unfounded feelings of guilt.\n\nEventually he reached the light at the end of the tunnel—and turned PTSD into Post-Traumatic Growth. Stefanie, who attended some of Mike’s therapy sessions, says his turnaround has been the answer to her prayers. He’s growing in ways that amaze and inspire her. He’s going to school, with the goal of trading his monotonous job at the post office for his dream job—teacher and sports coach.\n\n“He’s now in a very happy place,” she says. “He’s very content with his life now.” Mike calls it a “positive place,” a dramatic change from the constant negativity of just a few years ago. And he adds that there’s no chance he could have made the change without the love and support of his family. “They were my rock,” he says. He now has a new mantra: “Better every day.” A vast improvement, he says, over his previous mantra: “F— ’em.”\n\nScott sees a silver lining on the dark cloud of his father’s PTSD. It taught him an important life lesson. “We saw firsthand what PTSD can do to those around you,” he said. “I feel like we have a different understanding than what the average person has.”\n\nEpilogue\n\nAnd here’s an update on Mike Martinez. During his interview he said he wanted to leave his tedious job at the post office and pursue his dream—to become a teacher and a coach. Well, guess what. He did it. In October 2023, while I was narrating this audiobook, I received the following email from Mike: “After read­ing the transcript from our interview, I wanted to update you with more informa­tion. I have now finished my bachelor’s degree program and I am working full time as a 7th grade math teacher. I also became the head coach for our high school cross country and track and field teams. I genuinely believe PTG is real but strangely must appreciate the PTSD that allowed me to rebuild myself into something that I never thought was pos­sible. I guess it’s true that you can’t have a rainbow without the rain.”\n\nAuthor’s bio: Chip Reid’s journalism career has spanned 33 years. In addition to being embedded with Marines during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, Reid re­ported from Ground Zero and the Pentagon after 9/11. He has also covered stories on the war on terror from Afghani­stan, Israel, Gaza, Uzbekistan, Egypt and around the world.\n\nMarine Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) represent a small slice of the active-duty component. Less than 1,000 of these Marines exist in the service today, with even fewer operating in capacities actually control­ling aircraft. Though small in number, these Marines perform a vital “behind the scenes” function for Marine aviation, providing safety and order within their assigned airspace.\n\nThe path to achieving the Marine ATC designation 7257 looks different from other MOS training pipelines. Following boot camp and Marine Com­bat Training, prospective ATCs attend entry-level training at Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola, Fla. Marine and U.S. Navy instructors teach students the fundamen­tals of air traffic control, tower and radar operations, and provide them with a base­line understanding of Navy and Marine Corps policies and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. Grad­uates depart less than six months later as 7251 Air Traffic Control trainees. Each trainee receives an assignment to one of the 10 permanent Marine Corps ATC Facilities around the world, where the training continues.\n\nA controller’s credentials vary depend­ing on the facility to which they are assigned. In order to control aircraft in­side the assigned airspace, new trainees must complete certifications within an allotted timeframe from the day they check in. This process can take over a year in some cases. Because of this extensive training, ATC candidates enlist for an initial period of five years, rather than the standard four-year contract. During their training period, Marines are cleared to operate from the tower, communicating with aircraft actively landing or departing the runway, and the radar room, keeping an eye on the entire airspace and communicating with incoming aircraft beyond visual range.\n\nIn a world where specific credentials are required to hold increasing levels of responsibility, Marine Corps rank structure matters little in deciding who performs what duties. Lance corporals on their first enlistment might act as tower supervisors, watching over cor­porals as they talk with aircraft and instruct sergeants or staff sergeants who just checked in. This practice is largely unique to the ATC field. Every duty station requires its own set of credentials to understand the specific airspace and the types of aircraft it accommodates. As a result, moving to a new location at any rank can be like starting over again. Career Marines can easily spend three or four years away from their craft on a special duty assignment such as recruit­ing, drill instructor or Marine Security Guard. Loss of currency, coupled with the requirement to obtain credentials upon return to the community, can be a daunting task.\n\nAt the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Va., roughly 40 Marines control the airspace in shifts around the clock. Corporal Abraham Gamboa serves as one of the tower supervisors.\n\n“Painting the picture for the pilots will solve all the problems,” Gamboa said, breaking down the essence of his job in its simplest terms.\n\nTower-related aircraft mishaps typically result due to a lack of communication be­tween controllers and pilots. It is the responsibility of the ATCs, Gamboa explained, to inform the pilots of anything that might inhibit their safe landing or departure. During a Leatherneck visit to the tower at Quantico, Gamboa dem­onstrated this tenant of air traffic control with a sophisticated simulator. All kinds of variables can be entered to throw off the ATCs. While another Marine demonstrated how he would bring in a simulated plane, Gamboa manipulated helicopters circling, weather patterns changing, flocks of birds swarming, and even a herd of deer sprinting across the runway.\n\n“We sequence, we separate, and we make sure everyone abides by the rules to remain safe within the airspace,” ex­plained Staff Sergeant Marcus Beacham, ATC Training Chief at MCAF Quantico.\n\nControllers assigned to USMC air stations and facilities, like the Marines at Quantico, are also somewhat unique because they are non-deployable. They serve as permanent staff members of each Marine Corps installation. To deploy, controllers must achieve their 7257 des­ignation and be assigned to an Air Traffic Control Company. These units fall under the Marine Air Control Groups of their respective Marine Aircraft Wing. Ma­rines train for deployment in scalable units, from single Marines deploying as liaisons to allied airfields around the world, to a full company deployment into a combat zone. The capabilities they offer scale in relation to the size of the unit going forward and the gear they carry. This quality of Marine ATCs makes them the only branch of service with ATCs trained and equipped to provide expe­ditionary Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) services.\n\nMarine ATCs have accompanied avi­ators in combat since WW II. The first of these Marines served with the Marine Air Warning Group established in 1943, focusing their radar capabilities on pro­viding early warning and fighter direc­tion. Post-war changes upgraded and reformed the group into Marine Air Traffic Control Units (MATCUs). By the Vietnam War, MATCUs offered a full complement of all-weather capabilities.\n\nA small detachment from MATCU-62 served admirably in one of the most high stress and high visibility settings of the war. Led by Captain William J. Flahive Jr., the section of controllers and radar operators arrived at Khe San"
