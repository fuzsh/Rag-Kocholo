        "text": "– What the heck?\n\n– The undead were wiped out in one go…\n\n– Was that Turn Undead?\n\n– Is Turn Undead a spell that can be cast without an incantation?\n\n– No, it seems to be a completely different ability.\n\nAs the chat window filled with messages, a particular discussion gained traction.\n\n– Is that old man one of Kim’s summons?\n\n– It doesn’t seem like it. He called Kim an esteemed guest.\n\n– The staff seems to be the key.\n\n– I think he’s connected to the ship. Necromancers must have noticed it by now.\n\n– Right, I sensed the same aura from the old man as from the ship.\n\n– I’m not entirely sure, but I felt the aura too.\n\nNecromancers from around the world shared their heated opinions, concluding that what happened should be impossible.\n\nThe reason was simple. Nullifying the undead with similar necromancy…?\n\nIt’s doable if you know the structure, pattern, and ritual of the summons being used by Marlina.\n\n– That’s absurd. Does that old man think he’s a god or something?\n\n– Exactly. How could he know the summon structure of a necromancer he’s never even met before?\n\n– Neither the old man nor Marlina had previously interacted or had frequent skirmishes as to become familiar with each other’s techniques.\n\n– For someone who’s never encountered her before, how could he nullify her summons so thoroughly?\n\nEven Marlina, the person directly affected, was no different.\n\n“What did you do?!”\n\nFor the first time since this arena began, she raised her voice in anger.\n\n“I’m asking you! How did you neutralize my summons?!!”\n\n“Kikik. I simply disposed of those who dared to board without the right.”\n\nHrymr replied with the same laugh.\n\nBut, “Shut up!”\n\nMarlina’s neck veins bulged in anger.\n\n“Unworthy? Where on this heavily death-infused ship is there anyone as fitting as me and my summons?”\n\nShe swung her arm angrily.\n\n“The ones who are truly unworthy are those two!”\n\nShe pointed at Kim Shimun, still seated in his chair, and Choi Jinsu, who was observing the situation with a wary stance.\n\n“Anyone can see they have nothing to do with death!”\n\n“You’re a bold young lady, but I can’t agree with that statement.”\n\n“Ha! You old fool! Have you lost your mind with age?”\n\nMarlina raised her hand aggressively. An eerie, chilling energy that made the surrounding air feel deathly cold began to rise from her hand.\n\nThe essence of necromantic power—death aura.\n\n“You must be somewhat skilled to neutralize my summons in one go, but do I really need to prove here? Do you think there’s another necromancer in Platinum who can match me?!”\n\n“Indeed, it’s quite an impressive death aura for someone of your level. With more years, you might become an excellent necromancer.”\n\nHrymr responded with his own chilling laughter.\n\n“Old man. I didn’t show my aura to hear such drivel from you.”\n\nMarlina snapped back irritably at Hrymr’s compliment.\n\n“Enough talking. You look like the master of this ship. How about it? Join under me.”\n\n“Kikik! Amusing. Given that I neutralized all your summons, what reason do I have to join you?”\n\n“Sure, it might look that way.”\n\nShe extended her arm to the side.\n\n“But old man, who told you that?”\n\nHumm.\n\nAlong her outstretched arm, a series of necromantic magic circles in a deep green hue began to appear.\n\nBy the time they reached her fingertips, a complex array of emerald magic circles, reminiscent of Odin’s Eye, spun and then split apart.\n\nFrom within them.\n\n“You thought that was all of my summons?”\n\nGroooan.\n\nScreech!\n\nUndead with emerald green glowing eyes poured out.\n\n*\n\nClatter.\n\nSkeletons adorned in various armors and wielding different weapons, along with zombies,\n\nScreech.\n\nSpecters, wraiths, and other ghostly undead that usually required at least a Diamond rank to control, all exuded a sinister aura mixed with emerald green and gray.\n\nThese undead quickly occupied not just the deck of Naglfar but also the surrounding air.\n\nAnd,\n\n“Hmm…”\n\nKim Shimun, observing the scene, let out a small hum. It wasn’t the formidable nature of the undead that caught his attention.\n\n‘I thought only Malik was involved, but Marlina also had the support of Quetzalcoatl back then.’\n\nThe emerald green undead summoned by Marlina, owing their allegiance to the Constellation Quetzalcoatl, were the cause.\n\nMore precisely,\n\n『The Constellation Black Goat sneeringly remarks, ‘Heh. Judging by the numbers, she seems to have offered quite a bit.’』\n\n『The Constellation Odin frowns deeply, ‘Ugh! As if Naglfar wasn’t enough, now that repulsive serpent.’』\n\nIt was the price Marlina had paid for Quetzalcoatl’s support. Seeing the reactions of the Constellations hovering in his mind, Shimun was convinced.\n\n‘So, she has already performed numerous human sacrifices. And quite a lot of them too.’\n\nHuman sacrifice. The act of offering human beings as sacrifices to a deity. Though it was an act sometimes recorded in ancient human history, in modern times, it was unthinkable, yet, just like in his previous life…\n\nWith the advent of Galaxy Arena, human sacrifices resumed. All to offer them to the Constellations.\n\n‘Most Constellations don’t accept human sacrifices…’\n\nGenerally, constellations didn’t require human sacrifices. The reason wasn’t entirely clear, but even formidable Constellations like the Black Goat or Baal never asked for human sacrifices.\n\nYet, there were always exceptions.\n\n‘Constellations like Quetzalcoatl relish in human sacrifices.’\n\nIn his previous life, the notoriety of Malik and Marlina, the siblings of death, stemmed from this very reason.\n\n‘They offered all the refugees and survivors of fallen nations as sacrifices to bolster their undead army.’\n\nSetting aside the value of human life, very coldly, human sacrifice proved to be quite a profitable venture.\n\nThe Death Constellation Quetzalcoatl was uniquely different in that the level of his support depended more on the quantity of human sacrifices offered than on the player’s potential or favor.\n\nKim Shimun recalled the tales the siblings boasted about in their broadcasts in his previous life.\n\n‘They said they could get one undead from Quetzalcoatl for every one or two non-awakened humans sacrificed.’\n\nNo matter how advanced the necromancy, a normal human corpse could typically only produce a low-tier undead.\n\nHowever, the undead provided by Quetzalcoatl were all at least mid-tier.\n\nConsidering they were summoned from Quetzalcoatl’s domain and required no additional management like standard undead, it was clear just how advantageous human sacrifices were.\n\nOf course, this benefit was exclusive to Malik and Marlina, who were under Quetzalcoatl’s patronage.\n\nKim Shimun, frowning slightly, began counting the undead swarming the deck and hovering above it.\n\n‘Roughly 80 to 90 of them…’\n\nNearly 100 of Quetzalcoatl’s undead.\n\nWhich meant, ‘They’ve sacrificed close to 200 people up until now.’\n\nHa.\n\nA bitter chuckle escaped him. As expected from members of the worst villain organization.\n\n200 people?\n\nKim Shimun’s expression quickly turned icy. Mistaking his reaction, “Kikik! What’s that? Finally realizing you’re screwed? But it’s too late to beg now.”\n\nMarlina burst into her characteristic mocking laughter.\n\n“I’ll turn you into an undead while you’re still alive here, and I’ll do the same in reality as well. Of course, after I’ve taken this ship first.”\n\nShe cackled like a witch from a fairy tale. The combined menacing presence of the surrounding undead made her laughter sound like that of a grim reaper.\n\n“Hrymr.”\n\nKim Shimun called out, completely unfazed.\n\n“Kikik. At your command.”\n\n“You can handle this, right?”\n\nAt this, Hrymr’s eyes twinkled.\n\n“Why, it seems our esteemed guest is aware of their affiliations?”\n\n“I don’t know them well, and I don’t care to. It’s a group I personally find very revolting.”\n\n“Ah! Indeed. That lady is a player from the same world as our guest, so that’s understandable.”\n\nHrymr sighed deeply.\n\n“Kikik! So you’re not just any esteemed guest. Given that you summoned me in this manner…”\n\nHe nodded, marveling to himself.\n\n“What nonsense are you two babbling about? What are you waiting for?! Kill them both!”\n\nMarlina, brimming with malice, pointed and commanded.\n\n“Groooar!”\n\n“Screeech!”\n\nNearly a hundred of the emerald green-eyed undead charged all at once.\n\n“Not only is there trouble in Styx, but there’s also Quetzalcoatl… a delightful underworld club.”\n\nObserving the scene, Hrymr stroked his white beard and asked.\n\n“Esteemed guest. Though they’re of mid to high rank, I can handle this alone, but I wish to show some courtesy. Would that be acceptable?”\n\nThough his words were ambiguous, Kim Shimun seemed to understand what he meant.\n\n“Do as you see fit.”\n\nHe nodded without hesitation.\n\n“Kikik! My thanks. Then please, watch from your throne.”\n\nHrymr, with a satisfied smile, tapped his staff.\n\n“Enjoy our hospitality.”\n\nAt that moment.\n\n『Insufficient alchemy energy to achieve the desired alchemy.』\n\n『To compensate for the lack of the Philosopher’s Stone, 600 achievement points are required for equivalent exchange.』\n\n『Do you accept? (Yes / No)』\n\nA familiar message window popped up in front of Kim Shimun.\n\n‘Huh? 600 points?’\n\nThis massive death cruise ship, naglfar, only cost 400 points; now it required 600?\n\nHowever, ‘Well, I do have around 37,700 achievement points.’\n\nThanks to the recent special arena, the Black Forge, he had accumulated a significant amount of achievement points.\n\nEven if he spent points to alchemize the World Tree Seed Shard for upgrading the guild’s growth buffs, he’d still have around 27,000 points left.\n\nConsidering the payback from the Philosopher’s Stone, he had plenty of achievement points to spare.\n\nSo,\n\nSnap.\n\nWithout hesitation, Shimun chose ‘Yes’ and then snapped his fingers.\n\nThwack.\n\nShwaa!\n\nA sudden gray mist enveloped Naglfar almost instantly. It wasn’t just ordinary mist.\n\n“Groooar?”\n\n“S-screeech!”\n\nKept off balance, the undead of the Constellation Quetzalcoatl retreated in confusion. An unusual scene given that undead typically couldn’t express emotions unless they were exceptionally high-level.\n\nMarlina, knowing this, shouted in alarm,\n\n“What’s this?! What kind of trickery is this?!”\n\nHer face mirrored the dismay of her summons. Fortunately for Marlina and her undead, their confusion didn’t last long.\n\nStep.\n\nHefty footsteps, the sound of military boots echoed from within the gray mist.\n\nSoon, “O-hoho! Captain, we thought you’r enjoy this entertainment alone!”\n\n“To think you’d grant us such an opportunity is truly unexpected.”\n\nHefty and gruff voices resounded. Large helmets adorned with strong, sturdy horns, resembling Viking helmets, one by one, large figures emerged from the gray mist.\n\n“Isn’t our captain generous? We must savor battle together!”\n\n“Kahaha! Surely it’s just because of laziness. Is there any warrior lazier than the captain?”\n\nThe figures ranged from orcs to trolls. Warriors with physiques comparable to any greenskin’s, boasting rock-like muscles. Their exposed skin was so pale it appeared gray, resembling actual stone.\n\n“G-groar…”\n\n“S-screech…”\n\nThe once aggressive, charging emerald undead now displayed unmistakable fear, a feeling undead shouldn’t be able to exhibit. Considering these undead belonged to the Constellation Quetzalcoatl, it was truly an improbable sight.\n\n“Damn you! Express your gratitude to the esteemed guest! It is he who granted you this entertainment.”\n\nAt Hrymr’s command, like genial uncles or street bullies, the gray giants lined up before the seated Kim Shimun.\n\n“Khaha! True that!”\n\n“Sincerely, we thank you, esteemed guest.”\n\nBoom.\n\nThey all brandished their massive, vicious weapons and knelt on one knee. The sheer size and force were worrying, as if the ship might collapse.\n\nOf course, hel’s Naglfar wouldn’t break from the actions of its crew.\n\n“It’s nothing.”\n\nKim Shimun nodded casually. It was a scene befitting a king receiving the loyalty of numerous warriors.\n\nAt this, “W-what is this…”\n\nMarlina’s face paled beyond sickly, turning ghostly white.\n\nInto her ear, “Go.”\n\na clear melodious voice whispered.\n\n“Bring me her limbs, and place them at my feet.”\n\nThe familiar words echoed, before she even realized it was the same command she had given her undead earlier.\n\n“The esteemed guest has given his order! Show those blasphemous serpent’s minions the power of Helheim!”\n\nHrymr’s thunderous voice boomed.\n\n“Kuhahaha! The esteemed guest is truly generous! I like it!”\n\n“Dismembering limbs is my specialty.”\n\n“Move aside! I’m going to sacrifice her limbs to the esteemed guest!”\n\n“Back off! The offerings to the esteemed guest are mine!”\n\nAmid the cacophony of roaring laughter and shouts from the rough warriors,\n\nCrash.\n\n“Kiiaaak!”\n\n“G-groaar!!”\n\nA grotesque massacre, undead being slain once more, began.\n\nTL’s Corner:"
