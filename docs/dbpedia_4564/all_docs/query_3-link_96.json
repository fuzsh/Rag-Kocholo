You almost forgot about it, but then you're like \"Oh yeah damn, I can't believe how careless I was.\"\n\nIn 2018, we were soooo desperate for some level of accountability against Trump that we latched on to hucksters like Avanati. Sadly, 6 years later after two impeachments, an insurrection, 93 criminal indictments, 2 civil judgements and 1 criminal conviction, we still have to see Trump's name on an election ballot and vote against him before he can see the full consequences of his actions. We had no idea that the Mueller / Avanati days were just the beginning of the journey...\n\nI'm still here, 13 years later if you count the old place. Great job OP. Still reading often even if i'm not commenting.\n\nMain advice for the primary posters here is to see the enthusiasm and energy around K/W as the obvious/profound realization by Kamala's team (and immediately by Walz thereafter) that the voters we all agree are low-info, both-sidesy, enlightened centrists of the world are just really tired of weird shit. And it's those voters that re-elect Bush, that elect Obama, that reject Hillary, that come home for Biden. And coming home for K/W now. That doesn't make the lefty lefty stuff less righteous, less correct, or less worthy.\n\nBut y'all gotta know the the entry price for playing this game is knowing that it's played on a capitalist imperialism gameboard. Fight it from within, using its own rules to win meaningful improvements for the most lives possible. I hold my nose every day. But I'm not flipping over that gameboard. Nor should you when the triangulation of governance begins, gods willing.\n\nLots of work to do. Let's fuckin go.\n\nThat avatar. It's been a while.\n\nI think earlier we saw a post about him recording some long interview. I imagine he stayed behind in no small part because of that.\n\nAnd let's note, he was just interviewed by Adin Ross over Kick. So he's definitely not ill. But something is keeping him from doing large events.\n\nI think it's that he's old, lazy, and probably afraid of getting shot at again.\n\nFound the original post for this, and wow it's a doozy:\n\nView: https://x.com/JDVance/status/1821271841538998643?t=wRe3HPmOlsZwMyOTS0tzJA&s=19\n\n\"Hey let's make a post that will be cool for the kids.

We had no idea that the Mueller / Avanati days were just the beginning of the journey...\n\nNot for much longer though 😁\n\nWell, unless they wheel him out in '28 Weekend at Bernie's style lol\n\nSomething I've been thinking about with all the positive energy the last few days is how much Trump's situation now mirrors Biden's. With Biden out, Trump's lack of clarity, messaging and simple presence is now obvious compared to Harris. It really feels like the Republicans are where the Democrats are only a few weeks ago - but unlike Biden, Trump's ego and lack of any sense of loyalty, duty, or service would never permit him to step aside. I think it's only going to get worse for them, fingers crossed.\n\nThe Cult leader can't step aside.\n\nThe GOP doesn't have any sort of message that resonates with much of America. They've alienated every part of the party that isn't loyal to dear leader, so this is all that remains.\n\nI have a feeling this is going to get a lot of use over the next several weeks (*years).\n\nSidenote: But that VoteVets PAC also have a merch store with election signs if anyone was looking.\n\nHarris Walz Yard Sign\n\n\"Veterans And Military Families For Harris Walz\" graphic on 24\" x 18\" coroplast yard sign, with ground stakes.

I think Trump is just old and lazy. Even during his presidency, he was the laziest president with the lowest amount of actual work hours and the most vacations. And post presidency, he spent most of his time on the golf course.\n\nHe just doesn't have the vigor anymore to do 4 rallies a week. And the ones he does now tend to be fairly low energy and slurs a lot of the words.\n\nAlso I noticed Trump and Vance's energy are so mismatched and that's probably why you never actually see them campaign together. Harris and Walz got a good combo going where they can flow well together. Vance isn't even a good opening hype man for Trump, he's an energy vacuum.\n\nFound the original post for this, and wow it's a doozy:\n\nView: https://x.com/JDVance/status/1821271841538998643?t=wRe3HPmOlsZwMyOTS0tzJA&s=19\n\n\"Hey let's make a post that will be cool for the kids. What was that show with all those cool guys hanging out?\"\n\n*Chooses show with biggest collection of douchebags ever put on television*\n\nIt should also be noted that Entourage is a comedy about a talentless hack failing upward. Sure it resonated with Trump and Vance.\n\nFound the original post for this, and wow it's a doozy:\n\nView: https://x.com/JDVance/status/1821271841538998643?t=wRe3HPmOlsZwMyOTS0tzJA&s=19\n\n\"Hey let's make a post that will be cool for the kids.

Instead he ran away before he could actually deliver the challenge, lol. Very emblematic of Trump and today's GOP. 100% performative.\n\nHe's a 78 year old who isn't running against an 81 year old anymore.\n\nI think it's as simple as that.\n\nHe didn't have a plan to run for president, just a plan to run against Biden.\n\nNow he has the opportunity to lose the popular vote against 3 different candidates. If he loses this election by 9 million votes, he will have the largest cumulative popular vote deficit ever. McGovern lost in 1972 by 18M votes. 2016(-2.9M), 2020(-7M), and 2024(???) could put him over the top.\n\nIt doesn't really mean anything, but it would bother him to be the all time record for total vote deficit.\n\nThey know how to message this. This is exactly how Biden should have been addressing things instead of always saying how great the economy is doing (which to be fair on a macro level, yes it is), but that's how you reach those disenfranchised voters. Praise the economy while empathizing that there's still work to be done on x, y, z.\n\nView: https://x.com/Acyn/status/1821271209373528171\n\ni get it, but im wary of this type of stuff because the president doesn't control prices. the corporations do.\n\nso its going to take an act of congress, to which she signs off on, to get anything done on that. And then if and most likely when that doesn't happen it will be an easy thing to harp on, that she actually promised and didnt deliver.\n\nThis dude is so strange. I'm not sure what he thought that was going to do or what he was trying to achieve. But it felt like I was some sort of school yard mudslinging.\n\nOh god, I'd be so happy if he caught something from the (presumable) disease vector that is Adin Ross.\n\nIf Trump managed to narrowly survive an assassination attempt only to get terminally ill from an Adin Ross interview I may have to turn in my atheist card\n\nFound the original post for this, and wow it's a doozy:\n\nView: https://x.com/JDVance/status/1821271841538998643?t=wRe3HPmOlsZwMyOTS0tzJA&s=19\n\n\"Hey let's make a post that will be cool for the kids.

And now I somehow hate it even more.\n\nHistory repeats\n\nRight-Wing Obama Critics Obsess Over 'Rock Concert Conspiracy'\n\nRight-Wing Obama Critics Obsess Over 'Rock Concert Conspiracy'\n\nRightward critics of Barack Obama continue to be all a-flutter over the fact that the Illinois Senator's massive rally in Portland, which drew over 75,000 people, was preceded by a free rock concert by area musicians Colin Meloy, Chris Funk, Jenny Conlee, Nate Query, and John Moen, who are better known to indie rock fans as The Decemberists (though they were not billed as such at the rally)."
