The Squadron grew rapidly from this inauspicious beginning and in July of 1971 transitioning from the venerable UH-34 to the Bell UH-1E \"Huey\" and being re-designated Marine Light Helicopter Squadron 765 (HML-765). During this period HML-765 was the lone Marine Helicopter Squadron selected to retain the Gunship mission. On 1 July 1976 the Squadron received its first single engine AH-1G \"Cobra\" (now on static display at the NAS Atlanta front gate) and the Squadron was re-designated Marine Attack Helicopter Squadron 773 (HMA-773). In late 1978, HMA-773 transitioned to the twin engine AH-1J \"Sea Cobra\", an airframe that the unit would utilize for the next fourteen years. Throughout the following decade HMA-773 refined its war fighting skills through a myriad of training and operational exercises.\n\nIn November 1990 the Citizen-Marines of HMA-773 were the first Reserve helicopter squadron to be activated and deployed to the Persian Gulf in support of Operations Desert Shield/Storm. While embarked aboard the USS New Orleans and USS Tripoli, the squadron distinguished itself with mine sweeping escort and combat missions during the war. In recognition of their exemplary performance during the war HMA-773 received the Navy Unit Commendation.\n\nIn the fall of 1992, the squadron received eight, state of the art AH-1W \"Super Cobras\". With only a short time to transition to this radically improved weapons platform, HMA-773 embarked on an accelerated training regimen for all pilots and maintenance personnel in order to support two back to back regimental level Enhanced Combined Arms Exercises (ECAX's) at Marine Air Ground Combat Center Twenty-Nine Palms, CA. In November 1993, HMA-773 began receiving UH-1Ns and personnel from other disestablished units. In October 1994, having re-designated as Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 773 (HMLA-773), the squadron mirrored the active duty HMLA structure enabling rapid total force integration for current and future combat and contingency operations.\n\nSince reorganizing, the \"Red Dogs\" of HMLA-773 have deployed on numerous counter narcotic operations throughout the United States, Caribbean, and West Indies. In May 1995 the Squadron deployed to the island nation of Antigua for the first in a series of \"Weed Eater\" marijuana destruction missions. Further eradication missions followed on the islands of St. Kitts-Nevis, St. Lucia, Trinidad-Tobago, Grenada, and Nassau Bahamas. HMLA-773 counter-narcotics missions in the United States included joint operations with the Army, Coast Guard and several US Law Enforcement Agencies in Kingsville and El Paso TX, Naco AZ, London KY, West Palm Beach FL, and El Centro CA. In the space of two years, the Red Dogs aided in the destruction of over $20 billion worth of illegal narcotics. Proving one of the Marine Corps mottos, \"in any clime and place,\" in March 2002, the Red Dogs deployed with two Cobras, two Huey's, and 60 Marines and Sailors to Lundamo, Norway. Participating in \"Operation Battle Griffin,\" the Red Dogs took part in the second phase of NATO exercise Strong Resolve 2002. During Battle Griffin, HMLA-773 was the only reserve unit to participate and demonstrated the units ability to rapidly integrate with active components and NATO allies.\n\nIn 2002, HMLA-773 and HMLA-773 Det A based at NAS Belle Chasse LA, combined in order to form one complete HMLA squadron capable of fulfilling any assigned HMLA mission in the Marine Corps. The current squadron organization is structured to maintain 2/3 of the Squadron at NAS Atlanta and 1/3 of the Squadron at JRB Belle Chasse.\n\nFollowing the September 11th attacks, HMLA-773 prepared for action in the Global War on Terror. The Squadron focused on preparations for combat operations in both Afghanistan and Iraq as training continued with an emphasis on desert and mountain combat techniques. In October 2003, HMLA-773 answered the nation's call by deploying to Bagram, Afghanistan, and conducting combat operations along the international border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Red Dogs served continuously in Afghanistan through April 2005, becoming the longest serving Marine squadron in a combat zone since the war in Vietnam. In addition to combat operations the Red Dogs instituted Operation Red Dog, in which the Marines and Sailors of the unit gathered school supplies and other humanitarian items and distributed them to the local population. Upon their return to CONUS the unit supported relief operations in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and was recognized with the Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron of the Year award for 2005 as well as a Navy Unit Commendation.\n\nDuring June of 2007 members of the squadron volunteered for further service in the Global War on Terror and were deployed to Al Asad Iraq from September through January of 2008. The unit was recognized again as the 2008 winner of Marine Light Attack Squadron of the Year and also received the Department of the Navy Safety Excellence Award.\n\nHMH\n\nMarine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 361 (HMH-361)\n\n- - - -\n\nFirst design insignia at New River circa 1968 flying CH-53As\n\nUSA made, UnUsed.......inquire\n\n- - - -\n\nHMH-361 Helicopter Squadron, \"WESTPAC 86-87\" \"Flying Tigers\", Philippine(PI) made, UnUsed........inquire\n\nHMH-361, Japan made, UnUsed.....(sold)\n\nMarine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 362 (HMH-362)\n\n\"Ugly Angels\"\n\nDesignated HMM-362 circa RVN era\n\n- - - -\n\n\"HELO SQUADRON OF THE YEAR 1977\"\n\n4 x pigtails, pebble backing material, scrapbook residue on back, Unused.........inquire\n\n- - - -\n\npartial History\n\nHMH-362 was activated on April 30, 1952 as Marine Helicopter Transport Squadron\n\n(See HMM-362 for more History and patches)\n\nMarine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 462 (HMH-462)\n\n\"HEAVY HAULERS\"\n\n- - - -\n\nHMH-462 2nd Design, CH-53A era, circa 1969\n\nJapan made with a very-fine mesh backing\n\nLarge patch removed from a uniform(RFU), soiling, Used......inquire\n\n- - - -\n\nHMH-462\n\nLooks like the 3rd Design from Mr. Holmberg's dBase, he does not have it dated\n\nprobably from the 1990s (possibly from the late-1980s), UnUsed......inquire\n\nMarine Heavy Helicopter Squadron-463 (HMH-463)\n\nGreen background variation of the 1st Design patch circa 1966 to 1969 era flying CH-53As, not shown in Mr. Holmberg's dBase\n\nfrom the \"Burns\" collection, cheesecloth backing, Unused........inquire\n\n- - - -\n\nHMH-463\n\nLeft patch is similar to the 4th Design but with a Blue background that was used a Kaneohe Bay circa early-1990s flying CH-53Ds\n\nHMH-463, \"MARINE HEAVY HELICOPTER SQUADRON\", Asian made, UnUsed....inquire\n\nHMH-463 Japan made Large patch, \"Vietnam 1967-68\", Unused..........(sold)\n\n- - - -\n\npartial History\n\nOperated in Vietnam from 1966 - 1975\n\nParticipated in Operations Eagle Pull and Frequent Wind during evacuation of Cambodia and Saigon March - May 1975\n\nMarine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 772 (HMH-772)\n\nHMH-772, UnUsed.......inquire\n\nUI#221 - Marine CH-46 Helicopter Novelty patch\n\nclick on picture\n\nHML & HML/A\n\nHML-167\n\nHML-167, glue residue on back, (similar backing material goes back to the 1970s(?)), UnUsed..........inquire\n\nHML-167, Japan made, (found with a VMO-2 patch listed below), UnUsed.......inquire\n\n- - - -\n\nHML/A-267 and HML-267\n\nHML/A-167 (Light Attack), cheesecloth backing, flew Cobra Gunships, UnUsed.......inquire\n\n\"ANY TIME ANYWHERE\", Japan made, minor soiling from incorrect storage, small puckers from the maker's shop(common with partially embroidered Japan made patches), UnUsed...........inquire\n\nHML-367\n\n\"Scarface\" callsign first used by VMO-3 in Summer of 1967\n\nMade in Thailand patch\n\nHML-367 (formerly VMO-3) U.

The Squadron then deployed in August of 1951 to Korea and attached to the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW), where it operated in the central and western fronts. After becoming the first helicopter squadron to deploy troops into combat, HMR-161 successfully flew from the USS Sicily (CVE-118) to test new concept of combining vertical envelopment with amphibious assault during Operation \"Marlex-5\" off the coast of Inchon on September 1, 1952. This was the first ever ship to shore helicopter flight with Marines aboard. The Greyhawks then participated in the defense of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) from July 1953 to March 1955.

In 1956, the squadron was redesignated Marine Helicopter Transport Squadron (Light) 261 (HMR(L)-261) to reflect the acquisition of the H-34 Choctaw to replace its HRS-1 helicopters. The squadron was the first helicopter squadron to conduct troop lifts on the East coast. In 1961, the squadron was redesignated Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 261 (HMM-261). The squadron was, by then, flying the UH-34D helicopter. During 1962, HMM-261 was embarked aboard the USS Boxer (CV-21) and subsequently the USS Thetis Bay (CVE-90) for support during the Cuban Blockade. Returning to MCAF New River, HMM 261 was deployed in the south in support of the civil rights freedom marches in the spring of 1963. Returning to MAG-26, MCAF New River, HMM-261 prepared to stand down for subsequent transfer of its colors to the Western Pacific.\n\nIn 1963, the Bulls were assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 16, and as part of \"Operation Shufly\" they were based in Danang, Republic of Vietnam. During their time at Danang, HMM-261 conducted combat operations and delivered troops and supplies throughout the operating area. In 1964, the squadron, deployed aboard the USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2) as part of the Ready Landing Force in the Western Pacific, participating in training exercises in the Philippine Islands and Taiwan and was afterwards shore-based at MCAS Futenma, Okinawa until returning the squadron colors to MCAF New River.\n\nDuring the 1965-66 tour, the Bulls operated from Danang, Marble Mountain, Chu Lai, and the USS Valley Forge. The squadron continued to fly the H-34 helicopter throughout both tours, and participated in several major offensives including: Operations Starlight, Harvest Moon, Double Eagle, Utah, Nevada, Texas, and Hot Springs. During its 1965-66 tour HMM-261 flew 11,859 combat hours, MEDEVAC-ed 2,315 wounded, flew 38,090 combat sorties, ferried 47,522 troops into battle and expended 32,610 rounds of ammunition. Throughout its three combat tours in Vietnam, many of the units' helicopters were badly shot up while performing medevacs and troop insertion missions; during 1965-1966,its helicopters were hit 273 times with many aircraft destroyed. Squadron members were awarded personal decorations from the Navy Cross on down.\n\nIn 1966, the Bulls came home to New River again. During the late 1960s, the squadron accepted their first, brand new CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters. The squadron still flies an updated model of the same helicopter, the CH-46E. Throughout the 1970s, the Bulls participated in various training exercises in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Caribbean regions. It was during this time that the squadron added to their nickname and became the \"Raging Bulls\".\n\nA CH-46F of HMM-261 lands on Grenada during Operation Urgent Fury, Oct. 1983.\n\nIn 1982, the Raging Bulls deployed to Beirut, Lebanon. In October 1983, the squadron was about to be deployed again to Beirut, but was diverted to the Caribbean for the invasion of Grenada, codenamed Operation Urgent Fury. There, the squadron provided assault support during the initial landings and subsequent operations ashore. Two AH-1 Cobra and two CH-46 helicopters were shot down and three squadron pilots were killed during the invasion. Several hundred American students received their rides to safety aboard Raging Bull aircraft. Following this operation, HMM-261 deployed to war-ravaged Beirut. While stationed off Beirut, the squadron conducted medevac missions in support of the Marine Amphibious Unit ashore following the bombing of the Marine Barracks, and flew over 800 American and Lebanese citizens to safety.\n\nIn 1990, the squadron took part in Operation Sharp Edge, which consisted of the evacuation and protection of American citizens in Liberia. In January 1991, following a quick turnaround in New River, the squadron deployed to Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. With the ground war in full swing, the Raging Bulls flew numerous medevac and assault support missions in support of 2nd Marine Division. The squadron returned home to New River on May 13, 1991.\n\nApril 15, 1997 saw HMM-261 prepared for a pending Noncombatant Evacuation Operation (NEO) in the country of Zaire, leaving behind a detachment of (4) CH-46's and (2) UH-1N's to board the USS Ponce. The 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) Forward, which included HMM-261 (REIN) Det. A departed on time and entered the Mediterranean Sea to cover the 22nd MEU's commitments. During the deployment, the main body of the 22nd MEU participated in two major operations: Operation Guardian Retrieval, operating out of Brazzaville, Congo; and Operation Noble Obelisk, in Freetown, Sierra Leone, which resulted in the evacuation of more than 2,500 American citizens and foreign nationals. Meanwhile, HMM-261 (REIN)'s Det. A participated in Operation Silver Wake in Tirana, Albania. A year later, in October 1998, HMM-261 was called upon to help provide hurricane relief in Puerto Rico.\n\nIn July 2002, the MEU was called upon to conduct operations in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). Once off the coast of Pakistan, the MEU continued to plan for interdiction operations in Afghanistan. Concurrently AV-8s flew the MEUs first reconnaissance flights over the country. Advanced parties were dispatched into Pakistan to conduct liaison with host nation agencies.\n\n2003 brought about pre-deployment planning for Operation Iraqi Freedom II. Upon arriving in the Persian Gulf, HMM 261 flew into 1st Marine Expeditionary Forces Area of Operation, where it was attached to the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at Al Asad Airbase. This was the first such integration of this scale in Marine Corps History, and the Raging Bulls were integral to its success.\n\nWhile in Iraq, HMM-261 was fully engaged in various operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom II. The squadron continued to perform direct support missions in the form of Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC), Command and Control (C&C) standby, general support, re-supply, troop movements, VIP lifts and Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP)/Quick Reaction Force (QRF) during the day and night. In September 2004, HMM-261 returned to MCAS New River, where it was attached to Marine Aircraft Group 29. During the deployment, HMM-261 successfully completed over 2,000 Aviation Support Requests (ASRs), transported 8,358 passengers and 815,274 lb of cargo, flew 3,058.2 hours and executed 1,941 sorties, with zero combat casualties or loss of any aircraft.\n\nOn November 8, 2005, HMM-261 (REIN) conducted their onload to the USS Nassau to begin their current deployment as part of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit. They were based at Al Asad air base in western Iraq and on their third tour in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.[1] The squadron finished its latest tour in Iraq in late March 2006, accomplishing 1,845 sorties and over 3,000 combat flight hours providing medevacs and close air support.[2]\n\nIn late 2007, the squadron served as the aviation combat element for the 22nd MEU. From September 25 to October 11, 2007, AV-8B Harrier II's attached to HMM-261 flew 70 combat missions over Afghanistan providing aerial reconnaissance, close air support and convoy escort in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.[3] Following the impact of Cyclone Sidr on November 15, 2007, helicopters from the squadron operating from the USS Kearsarge off the coast of Bangladesh in the Bay of Bengal provided humanitarian assistance to those affected by the cyclone[4].\n\nOn April 10, 2008, VMM-261 transitioned to the MV-22 Osprey after 42 years of flying the venerable CH-46 Sea Knight[5].\n\nVMM-261 deployed to Afghanistan in November 2009 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.
