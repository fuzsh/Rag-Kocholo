Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 163 (VMM-163) is a United States Marine Corps helicopter squadron consisting of MV-22 Osprey transport tiltrotors. The squadron, known as "Evil Eyes", is based at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 16 (MAG-16) and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW).

The Squadron's original nickname, the "Ridge Runners", was bestowed as a result of typhoon rescue and relief operations in the mountainous terrain surrounding Hanshin, Japan following Typhoon Tess in September 1953. In 2015, the squadron officially adopted the moniker "Evil Eyes." This comes from the eyes that have been painted on squadron aircraft since October 1965 when it was recommended by the squadron's intelligence officer for operation in South Vietnam.
