MARINE MEDIUM TILTROTOR

SQUADRON 162

"Golden Eagles"

VMM-162 was activated 30 June 1951 at MCAF Santa Ana, CA, as Helicopter Transport Squadron (HMR) 162. After initial forming and outfitting, HMR-162 deployed to Japan with MAG-16 in 1953. During the next six years the squadron participated in several exercises and flew missions in support of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing and the 3d Marine Division. After redesignating to HMR(L)-162 in 1956, the squadron began rotations between Japan and New River. This lasted until 1962. In 1960, MAG-16 relocated from Oppama, Japan, to the new base at Futenma, Okinawa.

During 1962 HMR(L)-162 became HMM-162. It again deployed to Okinawa, taking part in operations during the crisis in Laos (Jun-Jul 1962). In 1963 (Jan-Jun)and 1964 (Jun-Oct) HMM-162 deployed to Da Nang, South Vietnam, as part of Operation SHUFLY. After the official outbreak of hostilities 162 returned to South Vietnam, operating there from March to May 1965.

After serving in Vietnam, HMM-162 returned to New River, which has been its home for nearly 45 years.

From the 1960s through the 1980s, HMM-162 participated in numerous training exercises, as well as deploying as the Aviation Combat Element for the Caribbean and 6th Fleet Landing Forces. The Golden Eagles were deployed to Lebanon in 1982. During the next decade they participated on several operations including "Sharp Edge" in Liberia, "Provide Comfort" in Iraq, "Restore Hope" in Somalia, "Provide Promise" and "Deny Flight" in Bosnia, and finally, "Assured Response" in Liberia.

HMM-162 participated in the Liberaton of Iraq in 2003. This marked their last combat deployment with the CH-46. In 2005, the squadron entered cadre status in preparation for transition to the MV-22 "Osprey". VMM-162 was stood up on 31 August 2006 at MCAS New River. Since then, the "Golden Eagles" have made a deployment to Iraq in support of operations there.
