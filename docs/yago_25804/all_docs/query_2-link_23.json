He resides in Northern Virginia with Laura, his wife (a patent attorney), their six children, a cat, and a St. Bernard dog.\n\nSoon after meeting his would-be wife of 31 years, Brian Patlen gave his life to Jesus Christ in what was a “Paulian” conversion. But it wasn’t until a few years later that he really began to seek wisdom and study GOD’s Word which has been a personal commitment for the past 25 years. Professionally, Brian Patlen is a 32-year career veteran of many industries. He began as a chemist in the environmental field, worked his way up through various management roles, was an entrepreneur in business quality systems, auditing, business consulting and most recently served in several director-level positions. During this long career, he has learned and experienced what GOD tells us in Proverbs 16:9 “A person plans his way, but the LORD directs his steps” which is especially fitting given the many seemingly disparate businesses he has been involved in. Throughout this time, he has received recognition and awards at various times but all of these he refers to as “the wall of hay and stubble.” In contrast, there are real walls adorned with pictures of children and family along with their stories and victories which he calls “the precious walls.” Brian Patlen is married to his college sweetheart, Wendy, has four children, one grandchild and another on-the-way.\n\nBrent practiced transactional law in the Chicago area for forty years, specializing in corporate business and non-profit work. That practice was split about equally between private practice as a partner at two law firms and in-house corporate practice for two publicly-traded companies, first as an Associate Counsel and then as General Counsel. As of December 31, 2014 he retired from the practice of law.\n\nBrent has sought to integrate his Christian faith and his law practice through (i) the Christian Legal Society (as former Board member and President and now Staff member, working with lawyers and law students); (ii) Peacemaker Ministries and Crossroads Resolution Group (as a Certified Christian Conciliator for conflict resolution, mentor and teacher); (iii) Administer Justice (whose mission is to meet the legal and spiritual needs of the poor) and (iv) Judson University (as a Business Law Adjunct Professor).\n\nOver these years, Brent has been a speaker and teacher at national, regional and local law-related conferences.\n\nBrent serves as an Elder, Community Group Coordinator and Leader at his Church.\n\nSports and grandparenting are his two favorite extra-curricular activities.\n\nBrent is married to Sherrie (his “better seven-eights”) and has been blessed with two children and six grandchildren.\n\nJoseph (“Joe”) A. Ruta has been an attorney in New York City for 30 years. He began a solo practice of law in Manhattan in 1994, after being out of law school for only two years. Joe grew the practice by forming a partnership with Steven Soulios in 2001 and then adding Demetrios Stratis as a partner in 2011. The practice deals with various civil litigation, corporate, employment, real estate, bankruptcy and non-profit matters. Joe also currently serves as outside general counsel to over 30 companies including public and national not-for-profit organizations. He has successfully litigated religious freedom, religious discrimination, and right of conscience matters in state and federal courts.\n\nJoe graduated valedictorian of Marist College in 1989 after having attended Oxford University during his junior year abroad and winning Marist’s first debate championship in the college’s history as a sophomore. He then attended Brooklyn Law School as a Richardson Scholar obtaining a J.D. 1992. While in law school, he had the privilege of clerking for the Honorable Harold Baer, Jr. Joe was the president of the New York Metro Chapter of Christian Legal Society from 2002 to 2013 and was a member of the board of directors on a national level for Christian Legal Society from 2008 to 2017. Joe also served on the board of directors of Zarephath Christian Church from 2011 to 2017, ending his tenure as vice chair. He currently lives in New Jersey with his wife of 26 years, and they have three children.\n\nAnnie Bennett is the director of Legal Aid at Christian legal Society. Prior to joining CLS, Annie worked in civil legal aid in Washington, D.C., representing clients at all stages of complex custody and domestic violence matters. Throughout her time in legal aid, Annie also provided brief legal services to indigent clients facing a variety of civil legal issues, including housing conditions, evictions, and consumer issues.\n\nAnnie earned her J.D. from the University of Texas School of Law. Before law school, Annie taught 8th grade and earned a Masters in instructional practice from Lipscomb University. Her interest in advocating on behalf of children goes back to her studies at Vanderbilt University, where she studied education policy.\n\nAnnie is dedicated to God’s call to uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed, and she is passionate about empowering all attorneys to be confident in their ability to take up that call."
