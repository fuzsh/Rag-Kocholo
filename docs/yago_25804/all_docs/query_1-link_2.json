Clint marries central heroine Victoria Lord Riley in 1982, cementing the family's prominence in the series.\n\nClint adopts Viki's sons Kevin and Joey Riley, and in 1986 discovers he has an adult son, Cord Roberts, with old flame Maria. Clint and Viki have a daughter of their own, Jessica, that same year. In 2001 it is revealed that Viki had been pregnant with twins, one fathered by Clint and the other by Viki's nemesis Mitch Laurence; Jessica turns out to be Mitch's daughter, and Clint and Viki's child — kidnapped at birth — is a young woman named Natalie. On January 6, 2012, Allison Perkins revealed that Jessica and Natalie are both biologically Clint's daughters.\n\nIn 1983, Bo and Becky Lee Abbott have a son they name Drew, who ultimately becomes a police officer and dies in the line of duty in 1998. In February 1999, Bo fathers a son (later named Matthew) with wife Nora, though Matthew is thought to be Sam Rappaport's biological child until 2003.\n\nPatriarch Asa marries multiple women during his decades in Llanview, and in 1999 Viki's husband Ben Davidson turns out to be Asa's biological son. Ben is shot and slips into a coma in 2002; he eventually dies in 2004. Asa passes away on August 16, 2007,[6] and it is revealed that he had believed con-man David Vickers is his son. David is ultimately proven to be Bo's biological child in 2009.\n\nIn 2010, it is revealed that Rex Balsom, the man who was raised with Natalie by Roxy Balsom, is actually Clint's son with Echo DiSavoy, who was conceived after an affair in 1983.\n\nMinor character roles[]\n\nDrew Buchanan[]\n\nBuchanan Family The Buchanan Men of One Life to Live 2.0 One Life to Live Information Place(s) of Origin Texas Species Human Duration 1979-present\n\nDrew Buchanan One Life to Live Portrayed by Keith Bogart (1988–89)\n\nVictor Browne (1996–97)\n\nSam Ball (1998)\n\n(and infant child actors) Duration 1983–85, 1988–89, 1996–98 First appearance September 23, 1983 Last appearance September 16, 1998 Created by John William Corrington\n\nJoyce Hooper Corrington Introduced by Jean Arley Profile Family Buchanan Gender Male Occupation Officer for the Llanview Police Department\n\nRelationships Parents Bo Buchanan\n\nBecky Lee Hunt Siblings David Vickers Buchanan\n\nMatthew Buchanan Grandparents Asa Buchanan\n\nOlympia Buchanan Aunts and uncles Clint Buchanan\n\nBen Davidson First cousins Cord Roberts\n\nNatalie Buchanan\n\nRex Balsom\n\nKevin Buchanan (adoptive)\n\nJoey Buchanan (adoptive)\n\nJessica Buchanan\n\nMain article: Drew Buchanan\n\nDrew Buchanan is the son of Bo Buchanan and Becky Lee Abbott (née Hunt), conceived during a one-night stand between the two when Bo cheated on his then-fiancée Delilah Ralston. Upon the realization of her pregnancy with Drew, Becky Lee accepts the marriage proposal of Delilah's brother, Drew Ralston, to legitimize the pregnancy. The morning of Becky and Drew's wedding, Drew Ralston is killed. Asa Buchanan, assuming the child to be the illegitimate child of his son Bo, offered to marry Becky Lee to give the child the surname \"Buchanan.\" The child is born to Becky Lee Buchanan on the episode first-run September 23, 1983, and Becky Lee later leaves Llanview with new husband Jesse Wilde and infant Drew Buchanan in tow in 1985. A SORAS-ed, teenaged Drew returns to Llanview in 1988 for the funeral of Bo's then-wife and his stepmother, Didi O'Neill, leaving shortly thereafter in 1989. Drew returns as the bitter estranged son of Bo in 1996, influenced by his mother's torrid feelings toward the Buchanan family. A charming and troubled young man, he engages in romantic liaisons with some women in Llanview before leaving again in 1997. In 1998, a reformed Drew, freshly graduated from the police academy, returns to Llanview to repair his broken relationship with his father, and is hired by Bo as an officer for the Llanview Police Department. Months later, he is shot in the line of duty. Template:-\n\nDrew Buchanan II[]\n\nMia-Bella Knight (January 13, 2012)\n\nDrew David Buchanan II is the son of Matthew Buchanan and Destiny Evans, born on January 13, 2012 at the Buchanan mansion. He was named after his deceased uncle, Drew and other uncle David. Dr. Vivian Wright delivers him with Matthew and Destiny's families surrounding them.\n\nDuke Buchanan[]\n\nAdam and Connor O'Brien (1992)[7]\n\nDavid and Michael DeFranco (December 1993 – January 1994)[7]\n\nMatthew Metzger (August 23, 2004 – May 22, 2006)[7]\n\nDemerest \"Duke\" Buchanan is the son of Kevin Buchanan and LeeAnn Demerest. On the rebound from a failed romance with Stephanie Hobart, Kevin becomes involved with LeeAnn. They sleep together and LeeAnn becomes pregnant; Kevin finds out in 1992, and he and LeeAnn elope. Their son Duke is born in 1992, but their marriage crumbles over her closeness with Jason Webb. Kevin and LeeAnn divorce, and at one point in the fierce custody battle LeeAnn insists Duke is Max Holden's son. LeeAnn ultimately leaves town for Texas with Duke in 1993.\n\nIn 2004, Kevin is married to Kelly Cramer; they become involved in a messy divorce and an even messier custody battle over their son Ace. Somewhat bitter over Kevin's lack of participation in his life so far, an adult Duke comes to town to attend business school and sides with Kelly, even testifying for her in court. Kevin and Kelly's marriage completely collapses when Kevin discovers that Kelly had miscarried their biological child, adopted another baby illegally, and passed him off as theirs; Ace turns out to have been stolen from his biological mother, and a devastated Kevin and Kelly return him.\n\nMeanwhile, Duke has begun a relationship with Adriana Cramer; her mother Dorian Lord has hated the Buchanans for decades and despises the match. But when Adriana breaks up with Duke over her increasing feelings for Rex Balsom, Duke turns to alcohol and admits to Kelly that he has fallen in love with her. She convinces him that his feelings are not real, and they part. Later on in the St. James Church rectory, Duke again comes across Kelly, distraught from a horrible argument with Kevin. Their emotions get the best of them and they have sex, but a tornado hits and they are buried under debris. Critically injured, Duke and Kelly are rushed to Llanview Hospital, where a shortage of surgeons puts Kevin in the impossible position of choosing who will be operated on first. He chooses Kelly, whom he is told by the doctors is in more desperate need. Kevin is devastated when Duke dies on May 15, 2006 before he can be brought into surgery.\n\nInitially blaming Kelly for Duke's death, Kevin goes off the deep end when he learns that Kelly is pregnant with Duke's child. Having both had fertility issues in the past, Kevin and Kelly begin to view the pregnancy as a blessing, and are brought closer together. Kevin is by Kelly's side when Duke's son Zane is born on October 31, 2006. Kelly accepts Kevin's invitation to accompany him to London, where they can start over and raise Zane together. Template:-\n\nBuchanan Enterprises[]\n\nBuchanan Enterprises, founded by billionaire Asa Buchanan, is a multinational, family-owned corporation with offices worldwide. After visiting in Llanview in 1979, Texas-born Asa moves the headquarters of his company to Llanview in 1980 to stay close to sons Clint and Bo. As ruthless in business as he is devoted to his family, Asa's machinations (and attempts to both protect and control his family members) drive much of the drama in the series over the next two decades.In 1997, Clint's son Cord Roberts leaves Llanview for the London office of Buchanan Enterprises, and in 1998 Clint follows him. Clint returns to Llanview for good in 2005, and his adopted son Kevin later succeeds him in London in late 2006. Clint's daughter Natalie joins the company in 2007 after a failed attempt to become a police forensics investigator. Natalie's sister Jessica as well soon joins B.E. to fund her husband Nash's vineyard. Asa remained at B.E.'s helm until his death in August 2007 in which his son Clint succeed him as CEO. Asa's will forces his heirs[8] to work together as board members for the company to earn their inheritance. The usually-upstanding Clint finds himself using the underhanded tactics of his father to fend off the multiple takeover attempts of Asa's business rivals. Fueled by a desire for personal revenge against Clint, Dr. Dorian Lord plots a secret, hostile take-over of the company, which succeeds at the Buchanan Enterprises shareholder meeting on June 3, 2008.[9] Dorian renames the company Cramer Enterprises. In October 2008, District Attorney and Clint's love interest, Nora Hanen, manages to finesse Dorian into signing controlling interest of the company back to the Buchanan family in exchange for dropping potential attempted murder charges. The company is re-christened Buchanan Enterprises or BE.\n\nIn December 2008, the Buchanans gather for a video message from Asa. A year prior, Asa had stipulated in his will that the family had one year to fulfill a challenge in order to receive their inheritance: work together as a family to raise the price of BE stocks. If they succeeded, they would be rich, if they failed...they would not receive a cent. Due to the takeover commandeered by Dorian and the near collapse of the US economy, BE shares have declined. As punishment, the Buchanan inheritance is left to Asa's long-lost son, David Vickers.[10] David learns of his true parentage,[11] and soon claims what is his.[12] However, a DNA test confirms that David is instead Bo's son,[13] rendering Asa's original will null and void.\n\nOn episode first-run June 28, 2011 in order for Clint Buchanan to get a heart transplant and live, he was forced to give his estranged son Rex Balsom Buchanan Enterprises. In return, Clint would get Rex's fiances, Gigi Morasco's heart. All existing shares, funds and properties were signed over to Rex Balsom. On the October 21 episode of that year, Rex Balsom returned all of the Buchanan holdings to its rightful owner Clint Buchanan.\n\nSubsidiaries[]\n\nLone Star Records - Record Label started and run by Bo Buchanan in the 1980s.
