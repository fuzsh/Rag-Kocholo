        "text": "News From Llanview In 2001 Soap Opera Weekly's - Hits Or Misses For 2001 Breakout Performer - Mark Derwin\n\nFans of OLTL are now happily living in 2001 A.D. (After Dave, that is).� Before Dave, the simple , childlike character Ben created to trick Allison, it was hard to imagine Mark Derwin as anything other than Blondie's smiling knight.� Now that we've all seen what he can do, hopefully OLTL will use Derwin's talents to play more than Viki's straight-laced dutiful husband.\n\nFans who visit Soapnet's website were asked to submit their votes for whose naughty and whose nice for Christmas. Results below are for OLTL only. WTG Mark! Naughty & Nice From \"One Life to Live...\" Naughty:\n\nAsa Buchanan & Todd Manning\n\nIt was too hard to decide who was the most dastardly of this duo. Asa faked his death and Todd told Blair that her baby had died. In reality, Asa is lounging on an island and Todd gave the baby away. Should these acquaintances be forgotten? Most definitely!\n\nNice:\n\nBen Davidson\n\nBen should really be nominated as husband-of-the-year. He has stood by Viki's side through trial after trial, including this latest switched-baby tidal wave. Oh, come let us adore him.\n\nEditors Comment: We already do!\n\nSoap Opera Weekly, October 16th, 2001\n\nApplause, Applause\n\nMark Derwin\n\nOutstanding Performer for the week of Sept. 17 \"Mark Derwin has never looked smarter than when he's playing dumb. Derwin had been doing time on the back burner as One Life to Live's Ben, playing perfunctory scenes as Viki's dutiful, supportive husband. This week, Derwin still filled that role, but with a twist. As \"Dave\", the slow, simple-minded out-patient at St. Ann's, Ben went undercover to try to unearth Allison's true agenda for Viki. Derwin's portrayal of Ben's new alter ego was an amusing departure from the Ben Davidson viewers are accustomed to, and it exploited Derwin's heretofore untapped comedic talent.\n\nMuch like an overeager, naive child, Dave comes complete with rapid speech and an anxious physicality (his legs kept swinging while sitting) that allowed Allison to believe initially that Dave was real. Derwin kept his eyes darting and his questions rapid-fire, never letting Ben slip out of character in Allison's presence. Dave was relentless with Allison, and Derwin kept up the energy level.\n\nEven though it was Dave hurling question after another at Allison, viewers could still see Ben in Derwin's eyes, as he anxiously hung on Allison's every word.\n\nThe entertainment value of these scenes came as much from the humor inherent in the situation as from the welcome surprise that Derwin is adept at comedy. This was especially evident when Ben, as Dave, met with an absolutely befuddled Sam. In a rapid back and forth reminiscent of Abbott and Costello's famous \"Who's On First?\" routine, Ben thrust his new persona at his brother as Sam tried to figure out what the hell was going on.\n\nFor viewers, the answer to that question was simple: They were watching a fresh performance by an actor clearly invigorated by the challenge.\" - Travis Kinsey\n\nNEW! 11/2/01\n\nSOW- Nov. 6th 2001 - Mail Bag\n\nIn the mail call column: Our Applause, Applause for OLTL's Mark Derwin made his fans happy. They were glad to see him finally get the credit they feel he deserves. Some wish we acknowledged him sooner.\n\nMark Derwin gets the magazine's prestigious \"Applause, Applause\" for his scenes as \"Dave,\" the naive patient Ben created to infiltrate St. Ann's and learn Allison's plans for Viki. OLTL Executive Producer Gary Tomlin said that Derwin's latest story twist served as a unique way to utilize the actor while co-star Erika Slezak was on her annual summer vacation. \"This gave Mark something really fun to play with Barbara Garrick,[Allison]. He wasn't relegated to background stuff during that period [of Slezak's vacation]. Then when Erika did return, the story was off and running.\"\n\nRecent Magazine Photos From October 2001\n\n&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp\n\nMark with his TV brother Laurence Lau. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Before signing autograph for fan Mark and David\n\n&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp catch up on the latest SID news. Soap Opera Weekly, November 6th, 2001, Vol. 12 Issue 45 Hit Or Miss\n\nHit �. The Mother Of All Reveals ON OLTL WHEN IT COMES TO BIG SOAP REVEALS, One Life To Lives's Jessica not being Clint and Viki's daughter was about as big as they come. Still, the \"I'm-your-real-daughter\" twist has been so overdone that these scenes could easily be have been ho-hum. But this revelation was anything but boring, thanks to some brilliant ensemble acting. Erika Slezak's Viki has always been formidable, and she was here too. A person would be crazy to mess with this woman when she's mad. But Slezak had a worthy adversary in soap newcomer Melissa Archer. As Natalie, Archer gave as good as she got. Before the big reveal, Nat toyed with Viki, warning her that she didn't know what she was in for. As foolish as such a statement sounded in light of who Nat dealing with, Archer made the words believable and ominous, getting right in Slezak's face, bringing an intensity to the scenes that heightened the drama long before the actual reveal. When the secret finally did come out, Barbara Garrick's performance as Allison, the plan mastermind, was chillingly calm. As simply as if she was reading a grocery list, Allison recited how she took Nat as a baby and replaced her with Jessica. Garrick's matter-of-fact tone demonstrated that Allison is as deranged today as she was when she kidnapped newborn Natalie. Garrick let Allison relish being in control, and the simple pleasure she exhibited was positively scary. Interestingly, the person most affected by the reveal had the least to say. Erin Torpey held Jessica almost in suspended animation as these scenes played out. The look on her face went from disgust to shock to a surprising - though tentative - acceptance. As Viki fought valiantly against what she was being told, Torpey played Jessica as someone who, while obviously shocked, was entertaining the idea that what she was hearing could be true. Jess said little, but we can't say enough about these electrifying scenes.\"\n\n--Travis Kinsey\n\nSoap Opera Digest, November 13th, 2001, Volume 26, No. 45 Editor's Choice\n\nThe Changeling, OLTL � So, it all comes down to this: Having discovered a potential loophole in OLTL's history � who says the child returned by Allison after several weeks of kidnapping was the same one she stole from the Llanfair crib in 1986 � writers faced a daunting task. To make this enormous tweak of history work, they'd need to assemble their best actors and craft emotional, crackling writing that lifted the question off the page, landing it square in the realm of \"could have really happened.\" �Adding in a good, old-fashioned bitch-slap (from the wounded Jessica to smug Natalie) was just the cherry on top. �Man, this was fun! �Although Natalie, Seth and Allison's shenanigans have been idling for a few weeks now, it wasn't until Viki � happening upon Natalie telling Seth that he was her man, not Jessica's �asked, �\"What did you just say?\" that the engine was thrown into full gear. A face-off with vet Erika Slezak (Viki) requires a confidence that most actors couldn't muster, Melissa Archer (who does lean towards frequent, strenuous pop-eyed surprise) however, lived up to the challenge. �Nat had a secret hidden under the enormous chip on her shoulder. So, in an extended sequence (during which Erin Torpey's Jessica , rarely looking so sweetly vulnerable, ran around Llanview discovering that her boyfriend and new best friend had been lying to her), Natalie taunted a righteously angry Viki. �Yet Viki never threw her out, coming down hard on Natalie with a simmering, narrow-eyed gaze, as if daring her to realize the error �of her ways and ask forgiveness. �Natalie never flinched, lips curling back in disgust at Mrs. Davidson's perceived arrogance. �\"Seth and I are lovers. And we have been since way before we met Jessica.\" �But Natalie was just playing for time. �With that satisfying smack in the face out of the way and all the players assembled, including a long-suspicious Ben and an overeager Allison, Nat could finally move the chip aside and let the secret out. �The success of the scenes grew out of more than just having all the characters together � thanks to the muted, creepily building music, and the staging, which put all of Viki and Natalie's sparring in the Llanfair living room, then crammed the other actors in there too, the scenes had a closeness verging on claustrophobia. �It was tense. �It was meant to be that way. �The players took sides : Ben, Jessica and Viki Vs Seth, Natalie and Allison. �Viki demanded an answer: \"What is it that you and Allison are planning to do to my daughter?\" �\"Your daughter?\" grinned Natalie, delivering her long-held punchline with thick relish. �\"Oh, she's not your daughter. She's nothing. �I'm your daughter.\" �And with that explosive release, the humid closeness hissed out of that room like air from a balloon. �It all came out: How Allison took one baby but brought back another, how dirt-poor Natalie grew up embittered that her own mother hadn't realized that shed been given back a changeling, and so on. �The ripples will resonate for months and years. �With a less-than-deft treatment, this story could have lumbered around like a blind giant. �Instead, the talented cast, crew and writers once again proved they've got the talent and guts to handle any twist in the tale � no matter how big.\n\nSOU� Can These Marriages Survive? � Except from article that speculates on the likely or unlikely survival of various soap marriages.\n\nBen & Viki, OLTL\n\nWhy did they get married? They are in love!\n\nWho or what might come between them?\n\nViki's other personalities, which include Niki Smith, are always a threat, as are women from Ben's past. �\n\nFamily Support\n\nAsa may not like his long-lost son, but at least Ben being married to Viki keeps her in the Buchanan family. Viki's children all have lives of their own and are supportive of Viki's decision to be with Ben.\n\nGolden Anniversary Gift\n\nIts hard to come up with a gift for the couple that has everything. �Family and friends could always chip in to give Crossroads a makeover.\n\nSoap Opera Update, July 31, 2001, Volume XIV, No. 31\n\nBehind the Scenes of One Life to Live's\n\nWild Nightmare\n\nOLTL took Rae on a hellish fantasy and viewers had the time of their lives watching. All is not what it appears to be, as Rae Cummings (Linda Dano) found out when she was transported into the worst nightmare of any sleep. But what was horrible for Rae turned out to be fun for ONE LIFE TO LIVE.\n\nHere's the backstory: Rae arrived at St. Ann's Institution and encountered most of Llanview's occupants fitted into other identities. Better still they were out to pummel Rae. Update went behind-the-scenes to share what really went on.\n\nIt's All In Good Fun!\n\n\"When you have a nightmare, anything goes\" says Linda Dano. \"There are all kinds of bizarre things going on.\" Credit definitely goes to the hair/makeup and costume departments for a superb job.\n\nSoap Opera Weekly, Volume 12, Issue 31, July 31, 2001\n\nCritical Condition � OLTL's Inmates Took Over The Asylum In the lead section in her column, Marlena DeLacroix writes...\n\n\"Postmark Llanview:\n\nDid you see OLTL's special July 4 episode? Wow! Who ever expected soap fans to get such a great payoff for staying indoors and watching television on a holiday? 'Trading Places', as the episode was called, was funny, fresh, and totally original. Not since 'The Daisy Awards', OLTL's spoof of the Daytime Emmys, has a soap so savagely made fun of itself � and daytime drama in general. The one-episode satire was set up as show shrink Rae Cummings' (Linda Dano) hour-long dream.\n\nRae was called to St. Ann's (Llanview's mental hospital/asylum), where, wandering the halls, she ran into many of the show's main characters, who had literally changed places: Todd and Viki (and Viki's alters), Nora and Lindsay, Bo and R.J., Jessica and Jen, Will and Cristian, and last but not least, Rae herself with little Starr. Interspersed were characters inspired by '60s and '70s television � a nun impersonated by Renee named Sister Mary Richards (from The Mary Tyler Moore Show )and a flying nun impersonated by Ben, (a take on Sally Field's character on The Flying Nun). Part Rocky Horror Picture Show/part college lampoon/part drag show, 'Trading Places' was packed with so many references and inside jokes that I had to watch the episode three times to catch them all. (Marlena has never before watched a single soap episode more than twice in 30-plus years of viewing!) What was totally divine about 'Trading Places' was that everyone and everything connected with OLTL was fair game. For example, some characters made nasty fun of the poorly conceived character Rae, a shrink who infamously, if a bit nonsensically, listens to anyone's problems anywhere and anytime in Llanview. \"'Are you sure you're a psychologist?' Sister Mary Richards kept asking Rae over and over.\n\nLater, in the middle of a zany chase sequence, 'Lindsay' (really Hillary B. Smith dressed as Lindsay) took a moment to check herself in the mirror. Smith was brilliant to catch this tiny mannerism of the vain Lindsay. Still later, 'Max' (a cross-dressing Fiona Hutchison) and 'Gabrielle' (played by James DePaiva) were interrupted during one of the typical shouting matches that characterizes their relationship by the swelling notes of 'their song' (Michael Bolton's That's What Love Is All About). They instantly plunged into a deep kiss and fell into bed (with 'Max' jumping on top!). But what will probably be most remembered about this episode was the cross-casting. DePaiva was a pip as a rather chunky Gabrielle. Bob Wood's wearing R.J. dread locks, and Timothy Stickney wearing a Bo-style hat, were once-in-a-lifetime hoots. And I liked Erika Slezak as a shifty-eyed, rather seedy Todd. But Roger Howarth deserves and Emmy nomination for his brilliant impersonation of Viki and her alternate personalities. As Viki, Howarth's sweet expressions and upper-class 'at-talls' he tacked right on the end of many of her sentences were right on the money. In a conversation with Rae, 'Viki' suddenly turned into Niki Smith. ('It's Niki Smith Time', Howarth exulted hilariously). Later, in a soap moment destined to be classic, Howarth as naughty 'Niki' danced across the room, shimmying 'her' enormous fake breasts from side to side. Wasn't it all a scream? To me, the episode seemed to me to be the deepest, longest in-house vent in soap opera history. Because, television viewers, we deceive ourselves when we think we are the only ones who know how funny and utterly absurd soap operas can be. It's purely my guess, but I wonder if the people who make the shows � the actors, writers, producers � aren't even more frustrated about the state of soaps than we are? What better way of letting off a little steam than by letting the inmates take over the asylum for a day?�\"\n\nEmmy Awards 2001\n\nThe Emmys Awards are once again in the history books and while One Life To Live along with many other of the ten daytime dramas were totally shut out from the acting nominations, a small contingent from the show did attend the evenings festivities at Radio City Music Hall in NYC on Friday May 18th.\n\nWith this year's win, Canary became the most honored performer in the\n\nLead Actor category in Daytime Emmy history. Ironically, the woman who\n\npresented him with this year's Emmy, One Life to Live's Erika Slezak (Viki)\n\nhad five wins of her own in the Lead Actress field and is the most honored\n\nperformer in the Lead Actress category in Daytime Emmy history.\n\nThe highlight of the evening for this OLTL fan was seeing Erika Slezak presenting the award for \"Best Actor In A Daytime Drama\" to the very deserving David Canary. David's portrayal of Adam and Stuart Chandler was and is indeed one of Daytime's Best and truly deserved this recognition.\n\nDavid now joins Erika in that elite group of two who have 5 times received an Emmy for their roles as Best Actor/Actress In A Daytime Drama. Erika was also honored in a montage of Anniversary milestones for her 30 years in daytime.\n\nOLTL Fan Club Luncheon\n\nCongratulations to Ben and Viki Davidson (Mark Derwin and Erika Slezak) who were chosen as \"Best Couple\" by the One Life To Live Fan Club again this year. The winners were announced on Sunday, May 6th at the Annual One Life To Live Fan Club Luncheon.\n\nViki and Ben were sole winners in the Best Couple category this year, overtaking Bo and Nora who were tied by Viki and Ben last year and had previously won this award for several years.\n\nMark Derwin along with Kale Brown were chosen as \"Best Supporting Actor\" again this year. Congratulations to them both for their hard work and great performances this past year. Their portrayal as brothers Ben and Sam was the absolute best in Daytime. Kale was notified of his win and posted this response on his official website. It's reprinted here with the permission of his FC President, Allie Jenkins.\n\n\"Thanks to all of you from the bottom of my heart.\n\nI loved playing Sam Rappaport for you and\n\nam very happy that you enjoyed it. And, yeah,\n\nto share it once again with brother Derwin\n\nconjures only one thought in my mind:\n\n...Who's Mark Derwin?\" Kale (whose no longer on the show) continues to be greatly missed by his many fans and former castmates.\n\nWe're all \"Wild About Harry\"! \"Harry The Hook\" who is portrayed by Ed Kershan was a big hit at the Fan Club Luncheon. He was delighted and thrilled by the fans response to him and the standing ovation he received when introduced. Ed made his first appearance in the recurring role of \"Harry The Hook Henderson\", Ben's old mob buddy, last year on the 7th of June, 2000. Lets hope he makes many more appearances on the show again real soon.\n\nErika Slezak's Fan Club Luncheon A Big Success!\n\nA large number of Ben and Viki fans were in attendance on Saturday, May 5th at \"Erika Slezak's Fan Club Luncheon\" which was a dream come true for many of her fans who had never met her previously. All reports from those in attendance mentioned what a wonderful and well run event it was and how beautiful, friendly and gracious Erika was to everyone. A special packet of memorabilia was presented to each guest in attendance and Erika made sure to spend time with each and every guest. Congratulations to Walter Miller, Fan Club President, and to all the Fan Club Officers and members who worked so hard to make this such a special event for Erika and for her fans. Bravo on a job well done!\n\nMICHAEL'S ANGELS\n\nMichael Zaslow (Ex-David Renaldi, One Life To Live; ex-Roger Thorpe, Guiding Light) died of ALS in December of 1998 but his spirit and determination to put an end to the ravaging disease live on. ZazAngels, the organization he founded to find a cure, hosted a fund-raiser on May 6th at the Neil Simon Theater in NYC. Family, friends, co-workers and admirers turned out to support this worthy cause and enjoyed a stage reading of The Nature of the Universe.\n\nDuring a break, Linda Dano (Rae, OLTL ) was the hostess for a live auction. Dano stated \"There's something so wonderful about keeping the memory of a friend alive\". \"When Michael died, the disease didn't and I think we just have to be on it and honor him by working for a change any way we can.\"\n\nSusan Hufford, Michael's widow and the president of ZazAngels, made the announcement that a possible treatment has been found -- until now there's been none -- by a doctor whose study is being underwritten by ZazAngels. Susan was accompanied by her two adopted daughters Marika and Helena.\n\nFelicia Minei Behr accepted the first Angel Award that was presented to One Life To Life for helping raise awareness about ALS.\n\nIt was a great night and a wonderful tribute to one of Daytime's most unforgettable actors.

(OLTL, B&B, Y&R)\n\nBig soap weddings have it all: the beautiful flowing gown, a spectacular, multitiered cake - and the unexpected plot twist.\n\nOne OLTL, Viki wed onetime mob doc Ben, and the ceremony went off without a hitch. It was during the reception that everything went awry. By employing slick filming techniques (the slo-mo, the sudden dropout of all sound except a beating heart and music) and genuine surprise (Ben's shot! No, wait, he had a lucky coin that saved him!), OLTL, turned a potential disaster into a great sigh of relief.\n\nLittle did anyone know that the shooting at Ben and Viki's wedding reception was just the start - and that was where the real trick came in. By convincing viewers that all the mayhem was done for one day, no one really expected that another married couple would be involved in a shooting, even though all the elements had been in place for days. Blair, taking a swan dive into temporary mental oblivion, took aim at her cheatin' husband, Max, and plugged him right in the back. It took two bullets, but OLTL, now has the shot in the arm it needs to jump-start new story.\n\nFrom Soap Opera Update December 19, 2000, Vol. XIII, No. 51Soap's Sexiest Couples\n\nOLTL's Viki and Ben\n\nOne Life to Live's Viki Carpenter and Ben Davidson fell in love and no one, including them, could believe it. Ben had left a life in the mob behind and was on the run when he met Viki. He called her \"Blondie,\" because when they first met he didn't know her name or who she was. For Viki, Ben was the happiness she hadn't had in her life since her husband Sloan passed away years ago.\n\nTogether Ben and Blondie have overcome many obstacles. They split once and during that time Viki learned she had breast cancer. She wouldn't tell Ben, but he later found out. They have loved each other dearly and in November they finally walked down the aisle and wed. However, their wedding day was hardly without a hitch. Asa hired a hit man, who shot Ben, but he wasn't seriously hurt.\n\nFrom Soap Opera Update December 19, 2000, Vol. XIII, No. 51\n\nBest and Worst of 2000\n\nMost Poignant Storyline\n\nViki's Cancer\n\nJust when Viki got her life in order, tragedy struck as she was diagnosed with breast cancer. From the moment she was told and throughout her treatment, Viki's plight touched the viewers' hearts while informing and educating them about this insidious disease.\n\nSoaps In Depth, ABC, Volume 4, Issue 52, December 26th, 2000\n\nBest Wedding 2000\n\nPhoto on cover of SID\n\nSoap Opera Weekly, Volume 11, Issue 51, December 19, 2000\n\nHits and Misses 2000 The Year in Review Hit Couple: Ben and Viki\n\nSoaps are all about romance, and Ben and Viki exude it like there's no tomorrow. Even during their characters' estrangement, Erika Slezak and Mark Derwin never let Viki and Ben's love fade. Their reconciliation was truthful and honest, and paved the way for one of daytime's most romantic scenes, as Ben and Viki made love for the first time following Viki's breast cancer surgery.\n\nHit Most Shocking Twist:\n\nThis was soap storytelling at it's best - mortal enemies in life-and-death situation. Ben held Asa's life in his hands when Asa suffered a massive heart attack and Asa's \"son\" Max begged Ben to save Asa's life. As a last resort, con artist Max confessed the truth - Ben is Asa and Renee's biological son.\n\nHit Social Issue: Viki's Breast Cancer\n\nMegan McTavish and the OLTL writing team scripted a sage that inspired, educated and most of all, didn't depress. Truer words had never been spoken as Viki, alone in her hospital room, sang what is now her signature song, I Will Survive. Erika Slezak turned in an Emmy-worthy performance with unwavering support from Tim Gibbs and Mark Derwin.\n\n2001 Preview\n\nBen & Viki\n\nBen's only hope to get out of danger is to turn to the past.\n\nWill his next move cost him Viki forever?\n\nBen takes desperate actions to secure the future for himself and Viki.\n\nSoap Opera Update, January 30, 2001, Vol. XIV, No.5\n\nFebruary Previews Danger Sign\n\nBen realizes that he can't have a future with Viki until he finds out who is trying to kill him.� In order to do that, Ben has to return to his past and to a woman who he thinks can help him learn the truth.� The problem is that the woman is not only beautiful, but an ex-love of Ben's.\n\nFrom Soaps In Depth-ABC, December 12th, 2000, Vol.4, Issue 50Winners Announced In The\n\nFirst Annual Soaps In Depth Awards Most Romantic Couple\n\n1.Ben & Viki\n\nBest Love Story\n\n2.Ben & Viki\n\nBest Love Scene\n\n2.Ben & Viki\n\nFavorite Actor\n\n4.Mark Derwin\n\nFavorite Actress\n\n3.Erika Slezak\n\nSexiest Actor\n\n5.Mark Derwin, OLTL\n\nCharacter You'd Most Like To Call A Friend\n\n1.Viki OLTL\n\nCharacter You'd Most LIke To Switch Places With\n\n4.Viki Soap Opera Weekly's Viewers Voice\n\nWho was your favorite performer the week of Oct, 23?\n\nAmber Tamblyn and Chad Brannon and Genie Francis of GH were mentioned, along with \"OLTL's\" Mark Derwin, his scenes as Ben struggled to tell Renee the truth were heartbreaking.\"\n\nWhich November sweeps story sounds best?\n\n\"Viki and Ben's wedding.

This year's annual Feast With Famous Faces: Chefs and TV Personalities Cook paired daytime actors and local news personalities with 40 chefs from New York's finest restaurants to benefit infant and children's services provided by the League For The Hard Of Hearing. ONE LIFE TO LIVE's Kassie (Blair) and James DePaiva (Max) led the committee of daytime stars, who assisted at the 25 tasting tables. \"We're here because of our son,\" said Kassie DePaiva, whose 3-year-old James Quentin, is hearing impaired and thriving after cochlear implant surgery. \"It's our second year with this wonderful organization, and they do such important work.\" The evening raised over $300,000 for the League, which has been aiding the hard of hearing since 1910.\n\nThe League for the Hard of Hearing has had a major impact on my life,\" explained Kassie DePaiva (Blair, r., ONE LIFE TO LIVE, with hubby James DePaiva, Max, and his mom Rosemarie). \"Deafness does not happen to an individual; it happens to a family. It's a wonderful event to raise awareness, to see friends and to gain a few pounds!\"\n\nOLTL's Mark Derwin (Ben) came out in support\n\nof the cause for co-star James DePaiva.\n\nOLTL's Jessica may have given Cristian\n\nhis walking papers, but in real life, co-stars\n\nErin Torpey and David Fumero joined\n\nforces to support their co-stars.\n\nDerwin shared more than a laugh with\n\nrestaurant owner Brown-Steppe. Her eatery,\n\nPurdys Homestead of North Salem, NY,\n\nis near the actor's hometown.\n\nTheir OLTL Characters may be at odds, but off-screen\n\nCatherine Hickland (Lindsay), Ty Treadway (Colin)\n\nand Hillary B. Smith (Nora) had fun\n\ntogether for a good cause.\n\nLinda Dano (Rae, c., OLTL, with cast members, from l.-r. Ty Treadway, Colin; Gigna Tognoni, Kelly; Charissa Cree Chamorro, Sophia; and Mark Derwin, Ben) were glad they went to the event. \"I was delighted to be helping out, knowing full well that J.Q. [the DePaivas' son} has benefited tremendously from the work of the League for the Hard of Hearing.\" smiled Dano.\n\nSoap Opera Weekly, Vol. 11, Issue 47, November 21, 2000 OLTL's Ben is Shot!\n\nBen and Viki celebrate their wedding this week on OLTL, unaware that Asa's gift to them is a contract hit on the groom.\n\n\"It's a magical wedding, which is exactly what we had all hoped for,\" reports Erika Slezak, who plays the blushing bride. \"Headwriter Megan McTavish wrote the vows herself. We wanted the character to have a no-trouble, beautiful wedding, and she does. It's only afterward that it falls apart.\"\n\nAnd how. After Ben and Viki exchange vows on Monday (complete with Jessica singing and Sam reading Sandburg's Solo for a Saturday Night), Asa spills all to his \"son,\" Max, who immediately races to the reception to stop the carnage. Meanwhile, crusty old Asa also gets a pang where his conscience used to be and tries to stop the hit.\n\nToo late. The gunman takes aim on Wednesday, felling the groom and forcing Viki to drastically shift gears. \"Yes, the honeymoon doesn't come off quite as expected,\" quips Slezak. \"In the tradition of good old soap opera weddings, things may seem to wind down, but in fact they get wound much tighter, spinning everyone off into new directions.\"\n\nSoap Opera Digest, November 14, 2000, Vol. 25, No. 46\n\nUp Front\n\nViki and Ben On The Cover Of SOD\n\nOnce upon a time (actually, February of 1999) on One Life to Live, there was a doctor named Ben, who had ditched his job stitching up mobsters for a bartender's life, and a seven-times married, newspaper-publishing grand dame of Llanview society named Viki - and their lives intersected on night at a dive called Crossroads. Charmed by Ben's chemistry behind the bar and in front of it, Viki announced (via karaoke), \"I Will Survive\"; won a pair of red, fuzzy dice and fell in love. This week their offbeat, fairy-tale romance will climax in a romantic, fairy-tale wedding - assuming nobody gets killed first.\n\n\"For Viki, this is the last time she's getting married,\" insists Erika Slezak. \"Of course, I'm sure she thinks that everytime!\" For Mark Derwin's Ben, the feeling is mutual. \"He's pumped. He's deeply in love with Viki. With all of the bad things that have happened to him in his life, he finally feels like it's all behind him. Of course, Ben doesn't realize he's in a soap opera....\"\n\nNo, he doesn't. Ben and Viki are concentrating on their impending nuptials, which come on the heels of an extended breakup: Ben kept mum about being Asa's son (a factoid he learned in March), and she didn't want to burden him with her breast cancer. But they came clean and reconciled, so it would seem they've put the worst behind them.\n\nBut they've failed to realize the depth of Asa's loathing for Ben's adoptive family, the \"Rappa-Davidsons.\" And since Asa doesn't know that Ben is really his son, that twisted wrath is on a collision course with what should be the most joyful day of Ben and Viki's lives together. \"It's the climax of a love story and the climax of a hate story,\" explains OLTL Head Writer Megan McTavish. \"Asa is being driven to an edge, and he does something that he may well live to regret...and that they may not live to regret.\"\n\nIn other words, he's hired a hitman to take out the on-time mob doc, something that the engaged couple is blissfully unaware of because they've been busy planning an all-out bash. As Slezak notes, since she's been playing the character of Viki, she's never had a true bridal gown until now. \"What they've made for me is just lovely,\" she enthuses. \"I feel like I'm wearing a dress out of a 16th century painting.\"\n\nBen and Viki also surprise one another with gifts - a bracelet with gold and diamond dice charms for her, and a set of onyx and diamond-studded dice cufflinks for him. Says Slezak, \"[The dice] symbolize a totally different world for Viki, so I'm glad they brought them back.\"\n\nMcTavish agrees: \"This is a new beginning of life for her. Any love story and wedding is wonderful, but for Viki, this is permeated by the fact that she might not have survived. But she did, and the dream has come true.\"\n\nWell, almost. Yes, the bride and groom are in danger of not getting to the reception on time, but there may be a dark horse in the running to convince Asa to call off the hit. Explains McTavish, \"Max loves Asa enough that he doesn't want him to kill his [biological] son. If there's saving to be done, it might come from an unlikely savior - named Max.\"\n\nCan there be a happily ever after? Ben and Viki have already rolled the dice in life-and-death situations - luck is on their side. After all, this is one couple that hasn't come up snake eyes yet.\n\nEighth Time's the Charm\n\nVictoria Lord Riley Burke Riley Buchanan Buchanan Carpenter's been at this wedding game for 30 years - and has gone through some very different bridal gowns in the process...\n\n1970: Viki and Joe Riley\n\nNuptial Notes: Though she was in the throes of her first multiple-personality episode, Viki got hitched to blue-collar fellow Banner reporter Joe.\n\nErika Slezak Comments: \"The original Viki - Gillian Spencer - wore a big, white wedding dress for her first wedding. But until now, \"I'd never gotten to wear one!\"\n\n1972: Viki and Steve Burke\n\nNuptial Notes: When Joe was presumed dead, Viki let her domineering father talk her into tying the knot with company man (and new Banner editor) Steve on Memorial Day. Wouldn't you know it? Joe turned up alive!\n\nErika Slezak Comments: \"When I joined the show, they were just putting Viki and Steve together. They had this second wedding in the garden and she wore a long, white-ish afternoon tea dress with a big, flowery hat.\"\n\n1974: Viki and Joe Redux\n\nNuptial Notes: After much indecision, VIki left Steve and wed Joe in September (although it nearly didn't happen because Joe felt obligated to propose to Cathy Craig, who was pregnant with his child). After Cathy said, \"No,\" Viki said, \"Yes.\"\n\nErika Slezak Comments: \"When Viki married Joe again, she had on a beige cocktail dress with a matching chiffon wrap. The wedding was on location in New York City on 69th Street in St. Stephens Church.\"\n\n1982/1986: Viki and Clint Buchanan\n\nNuptial Notes: Joe died of a terminal brain tumor, and a grieving Viki bickered constantly with Clint. They finally realized they were made for each other and wed. But when Viki's personality split into Niki, she dumped Clint. They reconciled after she came to her senses.\n\nErika Slezak Comments: \"For the first wedding with Clint, Viki wore a long evening gown; for the second one, she was in a white blouse and white skirt by Ralph Lauren. Hello, I still remember the designers!\"\n\n1989: Viki and Roger Gordon\n\nNuptial Notes: Viki got pregnant and wed Roger Gordon when she was a teen, but her evil daddy, Victor, annulled the nups and hypnotized his daughter so she'd forget the whole incident. Which Viki did, until she ran into Roger...in the underground city of Eterna.\n\nErika Slezak Comments: \"Well, this was a bit of a rewrite of history, so there was no ceremony to be seen.\"\n\n1994: Viki and Sloan Carpenter\n\nNuptial Notes: Clint divorced Viki after learning of her illicit romance with Sloan. The two married, but Sloan died of Hodgkin's disease shortly after.\n\nErika Slezak Comments: \"Viki wed Sloan on his deathbed in the hospital in a beautiful red dress and matching coat that I believe is still in her wardrobe.\"\n\nSoap Opera Update, Vol. XIII No. 43\n\nShow Of Support\n\nIt was a star-studded day when actors from the East Coast soaps came out to join NYC's Labor Day Parade in a show of support for their union.\n\nRobert Woods (Bo Buchanan), his son Tanner and Mark Derwin (Ben Davidson) along with Timothy Gibbs(Kevin Buchanan), and Cassandra Creech (ATWT) were on hand from OLTL along with other stars from AMC, GL, ATWT. ABC Soaps In Depth, October 17, 2000, Vol. 4 Issue 42WANTED MEN\n\nLooking for a few good men? Look no further. There may be no such thing as a single man for all seasons, but ABC's soaps boast a different man for each season. And whether your tastes run to the bad boys or sweethearts. ALL MY CHILDREN, GENERAL HOSPITAL, PORT CHARLES AND ONE LIFE TO LIFE have a guy for you. Care to be introduced?\n\nTHE KNIGHT, Ben Davidson, One Life To Live\n\nWhen Ben looks at Viki, he doesn't see\n\nany age difference whatsoever; He only sees\n\nthe woman who makes his heart skip a beat.\n\nIn order to sever his ties to the Mob, Ben turned his back on his career in medicine. It was a big sacrifice, sure, but that's just the kind of guy he is. Viki Carpenter glimpsed Ben's inner light right away. Though he was working as a barkeep when they met, she knew immediately that it wasn't alcohol raising her spirits. Even throughout her battle with breast cancer, the selfless superman has kept a smile on his Blondie's face -- and now he has completed the picture by slipping an engagement ring on her finger.\n\nBen and Viki Are Newsmakers\n\nJane Magazine, September 2000 Below is an excerpt from an article entitled, \"Why Soap Operas Rule\".\n\n\"Why women rule the roost;\n\nOn Primetime most of the women over 40 have three casting options: the sitcom mom or the troubled lifetime mom, or the fiesty ol broad mom. But on One Life To Live, fifty something millionaire Viki brilliantly manages a newspaper, organizes charities and nuzzles with her studly younger fiance. In fact, while most tv shows and movies perpeptuate that idea that the nubile girls want to make it with old farts, soaps regularly pair young men with older women. Now, thats the kinda of \"pro-Women\" stuff that its about...\"\n\nEditors Note: We couldn't agree more!\n\nSoap Opera Hairstyles Magazine\n\n\"These cute twosomes are primed for romance\n\nbut there are bound to be problems along the way\n\nand we are not just talking bad hairdays.\"\n\nViki and Ben: \"It's been a wild few months for this unlikely duo. Ben found out he's really a Buchanan, Viki endured Breast Cancer surgery-then the two got engaged! This is a romance fraught with obstacles (the fact that he's several years her junior is one), but that is what makes them so charming and watchable. Plus the always elegantly coifed Viki and the slightly receding but still adorable Ben have chemistry to spare. Kudos to the executives who had the guts and insight to pair up these two.\"\n\nSoap Opera Update, Vol. XII No. 41, October 10, 2000\n\nSoap Opera Update did an indepth story on \"The Incomparable Erika Slezak\" in their recent edition. Below is the photographic lead in to it. Definitely a must read article for Erika Slezak and Viki fans.\n\nOne Life to Live's Mark Derwin has re-signed in January 2001\n\nfor another three years. Indeed this is great news!"
