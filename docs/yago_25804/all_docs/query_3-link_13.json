My neighbours would disagree…\n\nI can do most yoga-bird-poses such as bird-of-paradise, eagle, crow, king-pidgeon, but don’t manage to stand on my head.\n\nI’ve never been bored in my life. No rest for the wicked! Although a dear colleague in Geneva called me “not wicked, only slightly naughty”.\n\nOther than naughty, I’ve been called a dreamer, a unicorn, an elusive fish, and mad but adorable (twice!).\n\nI care about literature, and I also care about the how people treat the earth, their stories, each other.\n\nI value conversation, not so much of the argumentative kind but when it’s generous and explorative."
