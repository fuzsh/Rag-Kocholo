        "text": "Soap vet Catherine Hickland posted to Facebook a moving tribute to her late sister-in-law and mother-in-law, Hollywood icons Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds.\n\nAll in the Family\n\nIn 2012, Hickland married Todd Fisher, son of the late Hollywood greats Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. His sister was, of course, Carrie Fisher, the legendary actor and writer.\n\nLast month FisherÂ died of cardiac arrest on December 27th. The next day her mother had a stroke and died. The two shared a tumultuous but always close and loving relationship.\n\nA Broken Heart, Now Healing\n\nAs she recounts in her Facebook post, Fisher and Reynolds’ deaths shattered Hickland. Until yesterday, Hickland hadn’t communicatedÂ publicly about her experience. The actress’Â post recounts a particularly close relationship with Reynolds, whom she called, “Mom.”\n\n“Losing one was enough of a shock. Losing them both at once was unimaginable. Never in a million years did we see that coming,” she wrote.\n\nHickland says she has been mostly at home in mourning since her family members’ deaths. Only in the last couple days did she venture back out into the world, describing her experience of it as a changed, surreal place.\n\nSee Hickland’s full Facebook post below.\n\nHollywood Royalty, Soap Royalty\n\nHickland wasn’t just married into Hollywood stardom, she is also an icon in the soap world herself. She has appeared on “Bold and the Beautiful,” “The City,” “Loving,” “One Life to Live,” and “Capitol.” She has numerous other television and stage credits as well and an album of Broadway show tunes. The Renaissance woman serves as CEO to a line of cosmetics called Cat Cosmetics.\n\nShe was previously married to Michael E. Knight (Tad Martin, “All My Children,” Simon Neville, “The Young and the Restless”) and David Hasshelhoff.\n\nGive us your input in the comment section below.
