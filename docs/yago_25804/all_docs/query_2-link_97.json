        "text": "Question: What's become of Michael Moriarty, \"Law & Order's\" Ben Stone? He was so good. -- M.H., Columbus, Ga.Answer: Moriarty's talents extend beyond acting. He's a poet, a jazz and classical music composer, a playwright and, since his \"Law & Order\" departure in 1994, a public speaker on various political issues. In recent years, he has been a regular in the syndicated \"Psi Factor\" series (1996-97), starred in various made-for-TV movies and in the children's movie \"Shiloh.\" Next, he'll be in the Kiefer Sutherland-directed \"Woman Wanted\" with Holly Hunter. He married for the third time in October 1998 and lives with his wife in Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\nQuestion: I've been watching reruns of \"All in the Family,\" and most of them are directed by Paul Bogart. Is he the son of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall? -- M.A., Wichita, Kan.\n\nAnswer: The Emmy-winning TV director is not the son of Bogart and Bacall. In fact, he's five years older than Bacall. Paul Bogart gained fame directing live TV dramas in the 1950s and '60s and went on to direct the groundbreaking \"All in the Family\" series and episodes of \"The Golden Girls.\"\n\nQuestion: My grandson loves the Hardy Boys books. I understand there was a TV series with Shaun Cassidy as one of the Hardys. Are there any plans to rerun this series, or is it on video? -- J.G., Buffalo, N.Y.\n\nAnswer: Shaun played Joe Hardy to Parker Stevenson's Frank in the 1977 \"Hardy Boys Mysteries\" series. You'll find it on TV Land, weekdays at noon. If you don't get TV Land, some episodes are available on video.\n\nQuestion: Please answer these questions that have me perplexed. There are two actresses with almost the same name: Catherine Hicks of \"7th Heaven\" and Catherine Hickland of \"One Life to Live.\" Which one was married to David Hasselhoff? Do they have any children? Which one played in the Marilyn Monroe story? -- R.B., Philadelphia\n\nAnswer: Catherine Hicks, Annie Camden on \"7th Heaven,\" starred in the 1980 telefilm \"Marilyn: The Untold Story.\" She's also been in \"Child's Play,\" \"Peggy Sue Got Married\" and \"Ryan's Hope.\" Catherine Hickland, a soap opera veteran who stars as Lindsay Rappaport on \"One Life to Live,\" married David Hasselhoff in 1984 after they met on the set of \"Knight Rider.\" They divorced in 1988 with no children. She's now married to Michael E. Knight, who plays Tad Martin on \"All My Children.\"\n\nQuestion: Where is Saundra Quarterman, who played the character Geneva on the show \"Hangin' With Mr. Cooper\"? -- W.I., Dallas\n\nAnswer: You'll find her starring with Tim Guinee (\"Brave New World,\" \"Courage Under Fire\") in the new ABC series \"Strange World.\" The sci-fi drama, from \"X-Files\" producer Howard Gordon, gets a four-week run this month.\n\nQuestion: I watched the news about Chuck Norris' wedding on \"Entertainment Tonight.\" They said his friends call him Carlos. Is that his real name? -- M.S., Rochester, N.Y.\n\nAnswer: The \"Walker, Texas Ranger\" star was born Carlos Ray in 1942. He married the former Gena O'Kelley in November."
