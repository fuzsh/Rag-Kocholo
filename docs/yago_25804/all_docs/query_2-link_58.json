        "text": "OLTL has done it again!\n\nThe character of Lindsay has undegone a complete transformation (and a believable one!) since she was introduced onto the canvas back in 1998.\n\nThe ‘old’ Lindsay was a master manipulatress; i.e. tampering with Matthew’s test results to reflect that Sam Rappaport was Matt’s biological father & not Bo in order to keep Bo & Nora apart. Also, holding Nora captive after the train wreck where Nora was presumed dead as well as sleeping with Rex will Jen was married to him. I’m sure there are a handful of dastardly deeds Lindsay has committed that I’m failing to mention.\n\nThe turning point for Lindsay IMO was a combination of her losing her marbles and being committed to St. Anne’s after accidentally murdering Sam Rappaport (when he was in bed with Blair) AND, more importantly, her daughteer Jen’ murder.\n\nLike a piece of clay in a pottery kiln, the character of Lindsay has developed into a kind, compassionate, strong woman. There is no sense of guile, manipulation that I can pick up in Lindsay now. I especially like her & Marcie’s special relationship.\n\nShe is quickly becoming one of the ‘good’ characters on OLTL (compare her growth as a person against Dorian, for example).\n\nI really believe that when all is said and done, even Nora & she will develop a bond (that is, if they are both not jello wrestling for Bo’s affections!)\n\nCan’t wait to see what happens with Lindsay next. She has so many more layers to her than Paige ever did.\n\nI suspect that Lindsay is the latest in a long line of Llanviewites who frequented Spencer’s hospital room prior to his death.\n\nI also suspect that Lindsay will not be the killer. IF THE WRITERS CHOOSE TO NAME HER AS THE KILLER, the only plausible explanation I can come up with is that Lindsay stopped by Blair’s room to comfort her on the loss of her & Todd’s child that she lost when she was pulled off the roof by Spencer.\n\nShe may have entered the room, saw Spencer over Blair, and\n\nreflected back to how Jen was killed so viciously by Daniel Colson & then stabbed Spencer–so Lindsay’s involvment would be separate from Tommy’s paternity secret.\n\nThat being said, I still don’t believe Lindsay killed Spencer but Johnny McB is getting close to the big reveal!\n\nHey Fellow OLTL fans,\n\nHaving just watched yesterday’s episode, I have a theory re: Lindsay:\n\nFirst of all, I don’t believe she’s the killer. This latest twist & turn serves 2 purposes: to kick the ‘Who killed Spencer’ whoduunit into overdrive AND to place Lindsay’s character back on the canvas. Based on yesterday’s episode, I believe Marty only WITNESSED Lindsay leaving Blair’s hospital room. She didn’t witness Lindsay killing Spencer.\n\nThis new revelation by Marty places Lindsay in a unique position. For most of her OLTL life (until recently she has been guilty of all the bad deeds she’s been accused of). I believe that she is is now innocent of the crime but will now have to prove her innocence. Ironically, Nora (Lindsay’s mortal enemy) may come to Lindsay’s defense. This could change the whole make up of their relationship.\n\nNeedless to say, the murderer will soon be revealed. I just don’t think it’s Lindsay."
