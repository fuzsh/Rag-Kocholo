I was\n\n>rather looking forward to Jean's staying around for awhile!\n\nI don't think so. Viki has been determined to be cured and the alters are\n\nnot expected to emerge again. Supposedly, all the different personalities\n\nhave integrated into Viki's core personality and she has all their strengths\n\nand quirks as part of who she is now.* (note asterik in later paragraph that\n\ncorresponds w/ this sentence)\n\n>> In yesterday's ep, however, I felt I caught a glimmer of her.

I wish she'd stick around a while, too, but no....I don't believe Jean\n\nis in control. I think Viki is really Viki.\n\n>I too thought that Viki's treatment of Gabby was devoid of emotion. It\n\n>wasn't like Viki was pissed off... she just seemed indifferent, in a\n\n>slightly annoyed kind of way.\n\nYeah, that's what I mean. She treated Gabbi in a very \"Jean\" kind of way.\n\nJean is very much a part of who Viki is today.\n\n>> And when Gabrielle asked if that was a threat, Viki glared at her oh so\n\n>> coldly and silently.

Maybe I should just skip it and move on from where we are\n\nnow.\n\nBtw, can you believe Melanie supposedly leaving town for good w/ one\n\novernight bag? (yesterday's ep) This bugs me more than anything, how\n\ncharacters on soaps travel unbelievably light when they leave town for good.\n\nNo one ever packs up any personal belongings. They leave whole furnished\n\nhouses or apartments behind, furniture, books, dishes, personal momentos and\n\nthese incredible wardrobes included. They always show them w/ airline\n\ntickets, too, or at the airport, having made no arrangements about selling\n\ntheir car. This is what Tea did. When she ran off w/ Todd, she didn't return\n\nhome to pack even an overnight bag....not even a change of underwear or a\n\ntoothbrush. She abandoned her car at the cabin and all her personal\n\npossessions. Who leaves town like that unless they're running for their\n\nlives, or from the law?\n\nAnd have you seen how many times Blair has had to move from one house to\n\nanother, depending on where she's been thrown out of? She always shows up\n\nthe next place she's going w/ one or two small suitcases. Yet, we hardly\n\never see her in the same outfit twice and she's always wearing all sorts of\n\njewelry and accessories. You'd think the jewelry and accessories alone would\n\ntake at least two suitcases. Are we to believe her clothes vaporize into\n\nthin air when she takes them off and a whole new fashion ensemble\n\nmaterializes magically overnight? And I guess she doesn't have any personal\n\nitems like books, pictures, kitchen stuff, lamps, linens, art objects, etc.\n\nGood lord, I don't live in anywhere near the grandeur these soap characters\n\ndo and when I move, it's a two-month enterprise of packing, hauling and\n\nunpacking!\n\nAnd really considerate of Melanie to leave all her patients behind and her\n\njob at the hospital w/o any notice or warning, as it appears she was ready\n\nto do. I sure would not want to be involved w/ someone so impulsive, flighty\n\nand irresponsible. I wouldn't care how good the person looked in a bathing\n\nsuit!\n\n>> Welcome back...to ordinary life!\n\n>Thanks! It's odd being back in the Bay Area, without the ocean right\n\n>outside my door. Ah well. I'll cope. :)\n\n>Taryn\n\nThe Bay Area, you say? Hmmm. Yes, I bet you have to walk all of two blocks\n\nto see the ocean. That must be rough. ;o)\n\nNatasha\n\nNatasha wrote:\n\n>\n\n> Taryn wrote:\n\n> >Yeah, but how many other OLTLers get the chance to stop midway and play\n\n> >six or seven different characters?

I hope Jean re-emerges from time to time,\n\njust to give Ben a good verbal smack around. I'm still chuckling when I\n\nthink of Jean's scathing (yet accurate) comments regarding Ben. :)\n\n> >Well what finally made Jean the \"gatekeeper\" for all the other alters?\n\n>\n\n> I don't think this was ever established.

I get it.\n\n... but she was only the \"head\" alter when Viki was still\n\n\"dis-intergrated\" (or rather, before she was re-integrated)? So I guess\n\nit truly isn't possible for Jean to re-emerge... Damn. :(\n\n> >How did she manage to totally regain control of the others?\n\n>\n\n> Well, she didn't always have control.

I thought I was watching OLTL during this\n\ntime but I don't remember this. I remember Jean locking Dorian down in\n\nher basement/prison, but I don't remember much else.\n\nTori was able to be in control for awhile, without arousing any\n\nsuspicion from viki's friends and family? That's amazing.\n\n> I don't think so. Viki has been determined to be cured and the alters are\n\n> not expected to emerge again.

So Viki still has some Jean-esque and Tommy-esque (etc.) qualities\n\nin her recently reintegrated personality. Intersting. I didn't realize\n\nthat was the case-- I thought the alters had more or less just faded\n\ninto the background.\n\n> >So there's absolutely NO WAY Jean could have been back?

I like Viki, but sometimes she's so complacent\n\naround Ben (in a sort of \"whatever you say, honey\") that it's kind of\n\nannoying. I miss the more lively Viki. Maybe I've got a case of\n\nBlondie-on-the-Brain. :)\n\n> >Where do you live, where you have such chilly as that? Alaska?\n\n>\n\n> LOL! Feels like it, but no...I'm in Chicago.

Or are they\n\npretty mild?\n\n> LOL! It's not normally that dark at 10 am here. My point was, the cloud\n\n> cover was so thick and heavy, it was hard to remember it was morning, not\n\n> night.

It's no fun having\n\nrain in the summertime!\n\nFor what it's worth, the weather gets irratic here too. But I can't say\n\nmuch now, it's blue skies and in the 80s during the days, although we\n\ndid have a go at a bit of a heatwave last week.\n\n> This morning it's not raining, but there's a fog here as thick as London.\n\nSounds like San Francisco (way colder in SF than it is where I live)!\n\n> >Maui was beautiful.

She goes from Todd's Penthouse to Asa's Mansion to Dorian's\n\nmansion, to Kelly's whatever-you-call-it-house... but she doesn't have\n\nany place her own, so in essence, she has very few personal effects.\n\nSpeaking of which, I'm surprised she hasn't been fired from the Banner.\n\nshe hasn't shown up for work for MONTHS.\n\n> Good lord, I don't live in anywhere near the grandeur these soap characters\n\n> do and when I move, it's a two-month enterprise of packing, hauling and\n\n> unpacking!\n\nI'd crack up if I saw Blair driving a Uhaul away from Dorian's....\n\n<chuckling>\n\n> And really considerate of Melanie to leave all her patients behind and her\n\n> job at the hospital w/o any notice or warning, as it appears she was ready\n\n> to do.

Wasn't it funny how she kept insulting him to Gina? Her criticisms were\n\nso on target, too. I'm gonna miss that, too. I was thinking w/ that scene\n\nyesterday of her dream w/ Niki Smith, maybe Jean will show up again in a\n\ndream. It wouldn't be the same as having her around for real (real being a\n\nrelative term considering it's a soap), but at least we'd get another\n\nglimpse of her here and there.\n\n>Oh I see-- because Jean didn't feel anything for anyone or anything, she\n\n>could remain detached enough to be the leader of the other, more emotive\n\n>alters.

So I guess\n\n>it truly isn't possible for Jean to re-emerge... Damn. :(\n\nIt should not be any more likely for Jean to re-emerge than any of the other\n\nalters...and that supposedly won't happen because she's supposed to be\n\ncured.\n\nI do remember reading, though, that Christine Sizemore, the real-life DID\n\npatient who was the basis for the excellent and rather creepy movie \"Three\n\nFaces of Eve\" was never totally cured. I read an article in some magazine\n\nsome years ago about her. It said she was mostly better and a lot more\n\nstable, but still had lapses from time to time where another personality\n\nwould emerge...and even some new ones were introduced once in a while. Ms.\n\nSizemore had more than 3 personalities, too, btw...that was made up for the\n\nmovie. The article said her psychiatrist documented over 60 distinct\n\npersonalities over the years of working w/ her. Some had not been seen or\n\nheard from since, but had logged in long enough to be counted.\n\nTheoretically then, Viki might not be reliably cured and they could come\n\nback at any time. But for the purposes of the show, they're gone. Erika\n\nSlezak reportedly had it written in her contract that she would not do\n\nanymore storylines w/ Viki having more outbreaks of DID. I think she was\n\ngetting sick of it. I guess she agreed to have Viki fake the return of the\n\nalters for the purpose of the storyline and just to have some fun, maybe.\n\n>> control began to break down.

I thought I was watching OLTL during this\n\n>time but I don't remember this. I remember Jean locking Dorian down in\n\n>her basement/prison, but I don't remember much else.\n\nBeats me. We saw all the different personalities from time to time. Jean,\n\nNiki, Princess, Tommy, Tori. Most of them came out after Dorian was\n\nreleased, however. Maybe that's why it's fuzzy for you. I remember Tori came\n\nout and decided to destroy everything related to Victor Lord's legacy. She\n\npretended to be Viki and ran the Banner into the ground. She helped Todd\n\nstart his rival paper to the Banner and get scoops for the Sun. The grand\n\nfinale was when she tried to torch Llanfair. I think Viki came out in the\n\nnick of time and stopped things from getting worse and saved the lives of\n\nher kids. I forget all that happened then, but that was the end of Tori.\n\n>Tori was able to be in control for awhile, without arousing any\n\n>suspicion from viki's friends and family? That's amazing.\n\nShe was better at playing Viki than Jean because she wasn't cold and she\n\ndidn't mind being touched, etc. When Jean was in control, she did some very\n\nuncharacteristic things for Viki that aroused suspicion. I can't remember\n\nall of it anymore, but she was kind of mean. I remember she kicked Tina and\n\nher kids out of Llanfair w/ no notice. She wouldn't talk to her at all and\n\nTina was devastated. She was really nasty to Clint, too, and that was not\n\nsomething Viki would do.\n\n>Hm. So Viki still has some Jean-esque and Tommy-esque (etc.) qualities\n\n>in her recently reintegrated personality. Intersting. I didn't realize\n\n>that was the case-- I thought the alters had more or less just faded\n\n>into the background.\n\nIt's subtle, but there are glimpses from time to time. I've sometimes\n\nthought this whole relationship w/ Ben has something to do (at least I'm\n\nguessing this is maybe what the writers are trying to show) w/ the\n\nintegration of Niki Smith. The whole business of her falling for an\n\nex-gangster who tends bar and calls her \"Blondie\" and her attachment to\n\nthose fuzzy dice....that seems like Niki's influence.\n\n>> LOL! I wish she'd stick around a while, too, but no....I don't believe\n\nJean\n\n>> is in control. I think Viki is really Viki.\n\n>Yeah you're right. There's no way that Jean could have held it together\n\n>the way he was holding and kissing Viki and calling her \"Blondie\" all\n\n>the time.\n\nNo, she could maybe fake it for a minute or two but would find an excuse to\n\ninterrupt things quickly. And no way could she make it through sex, which\n\nthey obviously had (sorry to remind everyone).\n\n>Well then if that's the case - with Jean having a part in viki's current\n\n>persona - why doens't Viki just tell Ben and some of the other where to\n\n>stick it sometimes?\n\nROFL! Too bad Jean couldn't be just a little more in control.\n\n>I like Viki, but sometimes she's so complacent\n\n>around Ben (in a sort of \"whatever you say, honey\") that it's kind of\n\n>annoying. I miss the more lively Viki. Maybe I've got a case of\n\n>Blondie-on-the-Brain. :)\n\nLOL! That's why I blame that part on Niki. Ben is the kind of guy Niki would\n\nenjoy hanging w/. But not for long and not exclusively. But since her\n\ninfluence is only subtle and very much in the background, Viki finds it\n\nendearing on an ongoing basis.\n\n>I actually have never been to Chicago but I hear it's a lovely city.\n\nIt has its drawbacks, but it has a lot going for it, too. I grew up in the\n\narea and have spent most of my adult life in the city here. I love traveling\n\nand wish I could do a lot more of it than I get to...but I will always call\n\nChicago home. I just can't imagine living anywhere else at this point in my\n\nlife.\n\n>But aren't the summers really hot (read: balmy) as well? Or are they\n\n>pretty mild?\n\nIt depends. Every few years we'll get a real stinker, but in between,\n\nthey're usually rather moderate. We'll always have some really hot days,\n\neven in our mildest summers, but mostly those spells don't last long unless\n\nwe're in a monster summer. And we get cool summers once in a while, too.\n\nSomeone here told me the other day that this chilly weather we're having now\n\nmeans we'll have a cool summer. We have the lake here (Michigan) which is a\n\nnice, moderating force. It helps keep temps. cooler. I won't mind if we have\n\na cool summer. I love not having to run the air conditioner. I love to sleep\n\nw/ the window open a little and get the night air (except for the time a\n\nskunk decided to move in under a bush just below my bedroom window). The\n\nonly drawback to cool summers is that it detracts from the beach. We have\n\nsome marvelous beaches here and a hot day is really nice for the beach. We\n\nhad a coolish summer last year and I remember trying the beach on of the\n\ndays and it was just too chilly sitting out on a blanket in my swimsuit or\n\ngoing into the water.\n\n>> LOL! It's not normally that dark at 10 am here. My point was, the cloud\n\n>> cover was so thick and heavy, it was hard to remember it was morning, not\n\n>> night.

Do you remember when he was dating Lindsay and they had a big blowout\n\nover her jealousy over Nora? She had this incredible moment of insight and\n\nshe went by his place to tell him goodbye. She said she was going to spend\n\nsome time w/ Jen, who was recovering from a broken leg, and then she was\n\ngoing to get some therapy. She didn't think they should resume the\n\nrelationship until she could get some answers as to why she does these kinds\n\nof things. And do you remember what he did? He begged her not to go....he\n\npressured her to forget about Jen and her broken leg and not to see a\n\ntherapist, and that the answer to all their problems was for them to get\n\nmarried!!!! Can you believe it????\n\nThe woman has one moment of lucidity and clarity for the first time in her\n\nwhole life and Bo squashes it and says all they have to do is get married! I\n\nnearly kicked the TV set in! Had he not interferred, Psycholady might have\n\ngotten some help for herself and who knows? Think of all the suffering that\n\nmight have been avoided.\n\nI bet he kicks himself over that one lying awake at night! He has some real\n\nco-dependency issues, I tell you!\n\nCould you believe the nerve of Lindsay yesterday when she was ragging on\n\nLanie about bringing Colin into all of their lives and she said something\n\nabout Nora losing years her life? I thought, you're blaming that on Lanie?\n\nTalk about chutzpah!\n\n>I guess soap characters are so rich nowadays that they can just up and\n\n>leave their homes and cars and buy new ones at their destination.

They still never lock their\n\ndoors. I decided years ago that Llanview must have enacted a special\n\nordinance prohibiting locks on the inside of doors to keep people out. The\n\nonly locks allowed on doors are on the outside to lock people in. People are\n\nforbidden to speak of the reason behind this strange law...but it's strictly\n\nenforced and obeyed. As a result, people are not required to ring or knock.\n\nRinging or knocking is considered an extreme courtesy....most folks simply\n\nwalk right in as if it was their place.\n\n>> And have you seen how many times Blair has had to move from one house to\n\n>> another, depending on where she's been thrown out of?

No, you're right....I don't think she's had her own\n\nplace in all the time she's been in Llanview. She's always been somebody's\n\nhouseguest. There was a whole class of people in the Victorian era that\n\nlived like this. They stayed at the homes of friends for weeks at a time,\n\ntraveling from one home to another, in the US and abroad. Maybe Blair is\n\ntrying to bring that era back in style.\n\n>Speaking of which, I'm surprised she hasn't been fired from the Banner.\n\n>she hasn't shown up for work for MONTHS.\n\nNo, she hasn't done a lick of work there, so it would seem. At least we've\n\nseen Kelly cover some stories. Speaking of the Banner, who's been running\n\nit? Kevin has been visiting Duke in Texas for ages now and Viki was trapped\n\nin Gina's basement for a long time, too....although, I noticed the other day\n\nshe referred to the time as two weeks. A long two weeks, but probably about\n\nright by Llanview time, where one day can drag out a week or more. It's like\n\nliving on Saturn or something.\n\nAnyway, who ran the paper in the meantime? Kelly, I suppose. It's amazing\n\nhow Kevin has this important job as managing editor and yet can spend months\n\nout of town.\n\n>> And really considerate of Melanie to leave all her patients behind and\n\nher\n\n>> job at the hospital w/o any notice or warning, as it appears she was\n\nready\n\n>> to do.

I\n\n>thought of your comment about Lainey's patients.\n\nI know! I totally cracked up when he said that! It was like an hour after I\n\nhad posted that. Too funny. Did you notice she told him she had found some\n\nother doctors to take over her patients? I thought, oh, yeah? When did you\n\ndo that? In one scene, Lindsay tells her to get out of town and leaves an\n\nairline ticket on her couch. The next scene, Lanie has her one little\n\nsuitcase all packed and is heading out the door til Bo stops her. In the\n\nnext scene she says she rounded up doctors to take over her whole patient\n\nload. Boy, she sure is efficient. Amazing how she was able to get all that\n\ndone in like no time. And did she notify her boss at the hospital? And was\n\nhe or she happy when she called 5 mins later and said, \"Ooops, changed my\n\nmind! I won't be leaving afterall!\"\n\nWould you want anyone that flighty caring for patients at a hospital you\n\nran?\n\n>But Lainey probably\n\n>doens't have many patients-- she seems to have so much time off from\n\n>work, and we hardly ever see her with a patient, it's just filling out\n\n>reports, etc. etc.\n\nThat's true...by the looks of it, all she has to do is go in a couple of\n\nhours every once in a while and do a little paper work. I bet she hardly\n\never sees any real patients.\n\nThey did something today I thought was odd. They decide she'll move back in\n\nw/ him and they're both still in love and want to get married, but they\n\ndecide there's too much going on right now to hold a wedding. So they cancel\n\nthe wedding but nothing is else is different. So why is it she can't wear\n\nthe engagement ring? Being engaged doesn't mean you have to get married the\n\nnext day. The engagement can last as long as they want. If they're going to\n\nlive together and they still want to get married someday, I find it very\n\ndifficult to understand why she wouldn't put the ring back on.\n\nTheir whole relationship is so weird, it's just one more ill-fitting piece\n\nin a mixed up puzzle that makes no sense. I sure hope the Curse of Bo's\n\nWives catches up w/ him this time and takes out Lanie. I really hate them\n\ntogether and she is especially a weak and dull character.\n\nNatasha\n\nTina did NOT go to California. She moved to Baltimore w/ CJ and Sarah. She\n\nrec'd a job offer to be a buyer for a chi-chi dept. store. That's the last\n\nshe was seen. Cord moved to London, Eng. to take a job, also. Clint and Joey\n\nmoved there, too, when each left the show.\n\nI remember once Viki saying something about going to visit Tina and the kids\n\nwhen Erika Slezak was taking a few days off. She has not been mentioned\n\nsince. Considering that Baltimore is not all that far from Philadelphia,\n\nit's a little odd that Tina never blows in for a visit....not for weddings,\n\nfunerals or crises, like when a family member has taken a bullet or been run\n\nover by a car and is in the hospital, fighting for his/her life. But when a\n\ncharacter is gone, he/she is usually really gone.\n\nAnd yes, Sarah is the daughter Tina thought Johnny D. had fathered, but it\n\nturned out Cord was the father. I stopped watching OLTL for a while around\n\nthe time Carlo Hesser's family was brought in and I missed that and the\n\nBadderly Island stuff, so I can't tell you what her motives weree for\n\ngetting involved w/ Johnny, but what you suggest could be right.\n\nI have a question about the following:\n\nTaryn wrote:\n\n>jasey brite wrote:\n\n>> <snipping Natasha's neato-keen insight into Niki's influence on the\n\n>> Ben/\"Blondie\" ship and the thing about Lindsey's abortive departure>\n\nIt wasn't Lindsay. It was Lanie.\n\n>> Oh, my God, I remember that now! That's crazy! I recall being disgusted\n\n>> myself. I think I must've blocked it b/c I absolutely couldn't believe\n\nit.\n\n>I actually don't remember that, but I hope the writers give Lindsay more\n\n>moments like these.\n\nI'm lost here. Taryn, to what do you refer? What did Lindsay do that had you\n\nso surprised and incredulous? Maybe I missed something.\n\n>To think she can carry on as evil and irrational as\n\n>she has been simply isn't realistic. Somewhere down there, DEEP, there's\n\n>bound to be a heart. I'd like to see more of it (or less of her\n\n>intrinsic evil-ness). I mean, no one can be that soul-less and evil,\n\n>can she?\n\n>Taryn\n\nI wouldn't characterize Lindsay as soulless and evil. I would say she's\n\nsomewhat unbalanced and incredibly neurotic and insecure. To compensate for\n\nher terrible insecurity and feelings of worthlessness, she finds other\n\npeople to blame for her problems (Nora, most consistently, and more recently\n\nLanie and Jessica....a nice bit of consistent writing when Lindsay went off\n\non Jessica for providing a hair sample at the police dept....when afraid\n\nthings are closing in on her, she typically lashes out at someone and blames\n\nthem in the most irrational way for her problems).\n\nShe acts impulsively when her insecurities are stirred up and often what she\n\ndoes is very irrational or self-deluding. If she would take some time to\n\nthink one of her hair-brained schemes out before she jumps on it, she would\n\nnot constantly have to go around putting out the endless fires that her\n\nill-conceived plots spark. Changing Bo's sperm count test and bribing the\n\ntechnician to rig the paternity test, if necessary, is one example. But\n\nprobably the biggest and stupidest and most ill-conceived was convincing\n\nColin to hide Nora from the world. Her motivation for this dopiest of\n\nschemes was that Bo had been nicer to her since the accident. What she\n\ndidn't get, however, was that Bo felt a desire to offer Lindsay forgiveness\n\nbecause he was moved by Nora's death (or her presumed death). But poor\n\nwhacko Lindsay mistook this sudden kindness as a sign there was still a\n\nchance for them....and she attributed this change in fortune for her to the\n\nfact that Nora was believed to be gone for good.\n\nWhen Nora turned up alive, Lindsay panicked and mistakenly assumed if Nora\n\nreturned to Llanview, her chance for a fresh start w/ Bo would be\n\nobliterated because she believed Nora still had a hold on Bo's heart. But\n\nshe was deluding herself. Lindsay never had another chance w/ Bo and it had\n\nnothing to do w/ Nora....it was about Lindsay. Not only that, but the other\n\npart of her plan was so brainless, too. She tells Colin it would be just for\n\n\"a few days\" until things w/ Bo are cemented. But what did she think would\n\nhappen in \"a few days\"? How long did she think Nora could be kept in Colin's\n\nhouse before she healed enough to begin demanding to be released? She never\n\nthought the thing out and it was a totally brainless plan from the get-go.\n\nWhat's saddest is it was all for nothing. She would have gotten more credit\n\nfor being the one to bring Nora home. Bo was totally over Nora. His\n\ndisenchantment w/ Lindsay had nothing to do w/ feelings he had for Nora...it\n\nwas all about his feelings for Lindsay, which changed when he learned about\n\nher lies and manipulation. And that was never going to be countered to the\n\npoint of him wanting her back in his life as a partner.\n\nVery soon after that, Nora began to realize she was a prisoner not a patient\n\nand, from that point on, there was no way out for Lindsay that would free\n\nher from serious criminal charges. No way would Colin take the rap alone.\n\nOnly then do I think Lindsay realized how trapped she was and, by that time,\n\nshe could see Bo was starting a new life w/ Lindsay's sister. Had Lindsay\n\nnot found the memory loss drug, Nora would either have recovered enough to\n\nthe point she was able to escape, or Lindsay would have had to kill her to\n\navoid going to prison. Nora probably does not realize how lucky she is only\n\nto have lost a few years from her life.\n\nNatasha"
