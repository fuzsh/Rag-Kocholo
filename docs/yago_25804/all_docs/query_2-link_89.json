        "text": "Question: Please answer these questions. There are two actresses with almost the same name: Catherine Hicks of 7th Heaven and Catherine Hickland of One Life to Live. Which one was married to David Hasselhoff? Do they have any children? Which one played in the Marilyn Monroe story?\n\nAnswer: Catherine Hicks, Annie Camden on 7th Heaven, starred in the 1980 telefilm Marilyn: The Untold Story. She has also been in Child's Play, Peggy Sue Got Married and Ryan's Hope. Catherine Hickland, a soap opera veteran who stars as Lindsay Rappaport on One Life to Live, married David Hasselhoff in 1984 after they met on the set of Knight Rider. They divorced in 1988, with no children. She's now married to Michael E. Knight, All My Children's Tad Martin.\n\nQuestion: What's the name of the movie starring James Brolin about a car that's killing people?\n\nAnswer: The film is 1977's The Car, which also stars Ronny Cox and Melody Thomas Scott.\n\nThe film doesn't appear to be available on video, but it still airs occasionally on TV. The Sci-Fi Channel aired it in late January.\n\nThe movie should be easier to find if a planned sequel is filmed. The Internet movie site Coming Attractions reported last year that writers Brad Heiner and Robert Masciantonio are working on a script for The Car 2.\n\nThe story reportedly brings back the demonic 1971 Lincoln Mark III, and Brolin has been approached to star in it. You can find Coming Attractions at www.corona.bc.ca//films.\n\nQuestion: Whatever happened to my teenage crush, Van Johnson? I can remember never missing one of his movies. Incidentally, my two granddaughters saw some of his movies on TV recently and agreed he was really cute.\n\nAnswer: Van Johnson is alive and well and living in New York, where he often turns up at social events in the Big Apple.\n\n_ Times wires"
