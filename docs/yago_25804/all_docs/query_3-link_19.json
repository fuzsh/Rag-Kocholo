        "text": "When Andrea Evans left in 1990, Slezak made a smug and snide remark about people going off the show because they want to be movie stars and returning in defeat a few years later. I always thought that was very telling about Slezak's resentment that Evans became for OLTL what Susan Lucci was for AMC (despite Lucci and Slezak being the same age, Slezak was perceived as matronly and older in comparison to Lucci and with Evans playing Tina, OLTL finally had its own version of La Kane).\n\nNever mind the fact that Andrea left because she was in fear of her life, this comment was purely and simply malicious:\n\n[quote]...on why people leave Daytime: “Because they think they can do better somewhere else. And the track record isn't good. In the number of years I've been here, I've seen any number of people leave...”I'm gonna be a star'...and off they go. And two years later, they're back. Sometimes they come back, and almost without exception, it does not work when they come back. Andrea (Evans, ex-Tina) was the only exception.”\n\nOLTL was must watch until 1995 and the Angel Square shit was part of the reason why, I remember Luna getting shot and killed there and her brother, the one who dated Marty Saybrooke, being devastated by it. The show was on a role until then with the Marty rape story and Viki and her alters back and burning down Llantano and the Dorian/Blair/David/ Tina hijinks.\n\nIn fact fall 1995 is when OLTL started to loose it, they also brought on Crystal Chappelle, whom I loved as Carly Manning on Days of Our Lives (the first soap I watched and the only one of the current 4 I still watch) and gave her the horrible thankless Maggie Carpenter, the secret nun!, role and paired her with Cord and Max with zero chemistry at that time too and the boring ass Marty/Patrick Thornhart storyline began at that time\n\nAMC and GH were still solid but had fallen from where they were in 93/94 as well\n\nThank God that DAYS was rocking on all cylinders back then with it's supernatural, far out camp, fun storylines of fantasy and adventure. DAYS headwriter at the time, the late James Reilly, wouldn't of dare wrote an Angel Square type storyline on DAYS, he knew viewers watched soaps to escape from reality and he fully embraced the camp.\n\nThat is why Ron Carlivati just FITS so much more at DAYS as headwriter than he did at OLTL or GH\n\nR322- Let me tell you this, I at least AGREE about Susan Haskell, and Marty is one of my favorite characters ever, and not only was Susan one of daytime's best actresses, I think she gave some of daytime's greatest performances EVER In 2008/2009? The storyline was not great, but it was the year everyone said Debbie Morgan was going to win the Emmy. After watching Susan that year, I KNEW that if Susan was nominated, her reels would be UNBEATABLE- they were that good. But I thought that she would never get nominated. She did. And she won. That aside- Malone and Gottlieb made an elegant, literate, humane, and GOOD LOOKING and beautifully produced show (from the Youtube videos I have seen OLTL had looked gaudy since 1981- and what Gottlieb did production value wise, WAS remarkable- although I missed Paul Rauch's larger than life sets and AMAZING BACKGROUND MUSIC- the best background music a soap had ever had other than Y&R) But in my opinion, other than Carlo and Alex, Malone could only write one good A story with compelling characters and usually a very good storyline. But his B shit was straight up trite, boring DRIVEL. When I watch the show from that era now, its overall quite boring- Its slow and the secondary storylines and characters are just not compelling. Max and Luna, \"Serenity Springs\", Luna's brothers, Angela Holliday, Marty and Suede, Angel Square (I am including this because its still Malone)- It is all so schmaltzy. Andrew and Cassie were boring, although I LOVED Andrew. What a kind soul for a soap. The show did not get enough credit for being so humane at that time. I just don't find that the Gottlieb era \"holds up\" well. It is a true mixed bag.\n\n[quote] Slee seemed to relish when Viki was finally pulled away from Clint. I guess now we know why.\n\nActually according to the oral history of OLTL, Erika Slezak was one of the few actors who didn't have an issue working with Ritchie. Many, many actors couldn't stand Ricthie (Tony Call - ex-Herb being one of them)\n\nBut the actors who made up the Buchanan family (including Erika) were tight. Anyways the story goes that Ricthie would show up drunk after lunch, but somehow always pull it together when it came to tape. Erika only had to stop tape TWICE in all her years working on OLTL, one of them was with Ritchie\n\nHe was once so wasted he threw a chair at her! She stopped tape and everyone took a break to cool off, and then resumed.\n\nFast forward a year later and Erika comments to Ritchie that she wishes she had her directors chair to sit on set between scenes. Later she finds out that Ritchie refused to re-sign his contract, unless Erika got her own director's chair on-set. Which she got.\n\nWhen both AMC & OLTL, Sidetrack, a Chicago institute of higher drinking big viewing party for the episode of each. Went to the OLTL one which was three days after coming home from burying my mother. Met the cast who came to the event (Ilene, Tonya Walker, Mark Dobies, Robuck, Florenzia, Josh Kelly - Ilene signed my cocktail napkin! Actually said to her at the bar 'Aren't you Delia Reed Ryan Ryan Colridge?' which made her laugh as we were introduced). Asked Dobies about Zimmer and HBS - he laughed and refused to answer when I asked who was the tougher scene partner). Unexpectedly warmest? Tonya Walker. Robuck and I had the eye 'conta. Josh Kelly lamented Prospect Park (at the time not going forward with the online version) as costing him TWO jobs as he had a film project going with them as well.\n\nStill have Ilenes cocktail napkin waiting to be unpacked from my last move - should probably have it framed.\n\nBest scoop? A cocktail invented for the occasion called the Cartini (Vodka/Something/Something Else/Pink Stuff). That and Ron supposedly had great stuff on deck for the initial online transition that had to be jettisoned (apparently not used for the reboot either!)\n\nEllen Holly said Kathy Glass was so jealous of her during their time on OLTL\n\nEllen Holly telling anyone who would listen\n\n\"And then, a white actress on the show by the name of Kathy Glass came up to me and snarled, 'I bet you think you're responsible for this.' Well, I laughed my best “Uncle Tom” laugh and I said, 'Not necessarily.' She backed down, and she had no political traction, so I knew she wasn't going to be any trouble. But I knew there were people who did have a lot more pull than Kathy (And I liked Kathy!) and I realized I would never see a five day week again.\n\n\"Sure enough, I never would be given a five day week again. I'm sure it went up the food chain, and somebody said, 'Who let her off her chain? Put her back where she belongs, and don't let that happen again.' And it didn't.”\n\nHere's a long interview with Gregg from 2013 where he talks about many subjects, including his time in soaps.\n\nAbout 3/4 of the way in, he talks about being gay and how being out is discouraged for male daytime actors, even now. Here's what he said:\n\n[quote]When did you come out?\n\n[quote]Well, again, it's been a process of moving through a lot of stuff. When I lived in New York, certainly my friends knew, but I didn't really discuss any of that with anyone - including the people I was closest to like Hillary. When I look back now, I really did enjoy my time on As the World Turns. However, I think I could have really enjoyed it a lot more had that degree of authenticity been something I could access at the time. As close as Hillary and I were, when I actually told her, it was kind of like \"Why didn't you tell me three years ago?\" But there were a number of reasons. It was at a time when there was no Will & Grace - there was no gay marriage on the horizon. I became very good friends with Vince Liebhart, who cast me in the show. When I would go back to New York to visit, we would have lunch or dinner, and I remember sitting with him in this little cafe down in the Village on one of my trips back a few years after I'd left the show. I said, \"Things are kind of changing in terms of people being able to be more open about who they are\", and he said, \"Not in daytime.\" Now that was probably 15-20 years ago, but I was surprised because I thought things were moving - but they moved in that respect really slowly. That was just something you didn't want to publicize. You're the stuff of primarily women's fantasies, and there were many people in the business I think who felt that it wasn't possible - if you were known as a gay actor - to play a straight role, which is kind of ridiculous. But the lines between fantasy and reality - especially in the daytime world - get blurred. You're out in the public and people will call you by your character and expect you to answer. In hindsight - with what I know now - I wish either I had been more courageous or less worried about what people would think. I think it would have freed me up - as a person and as an actor. Acting is all about opening up and exposing yourself, and that is completely juxtaposed and antithetical to covering up and hiding and concealing. I really do think that I did some good work, but I could have done even better work if I'd been able to access all parts of myself more openly. I think I'm able to do that now with the music because I've come to a different place in my life, but also it's a different experience.\n\nAs great as she was as Dorian, Elaine Princi unfortunately never got that daytime role that made her \"A\" list. Dr. Kate Winograd (\"Days\") was a recurring character who never clicked; I wonder if she ever shared a scene with Margaret Mason (Linda Anderson) whose role she later took over. (Mason was on \"Y&R\" in one of her brief returns when Princi took over as Linda.) Other than a few attempts at giving her a story, she just ended up being Salem's resident troublemaker with no real motive, and Linda faded out after they hinted but did nothing with a potential Linda/Victor story. (She did get a goodbye in the Thanksgiving episode, but it was nothing really memorable). Elaine was also badly paired with Bob Hughes on \"As the World Turns\" where she got to utilize her great French accent (also utilized on \"Days\" as Linda), but there was absolutely no chemistry. A brief part as a madame named Eva followed for her on \"AMC\" but it was a day here, a day there, and nothing long term. Perhaps that led her to being cast as Dorian, ironically crossing over to \"AMC\" a few times. After several guest stints as a judge on \"Another World\", Princi seemed to just vanish from the business. Her continental looks should have gotten her more work and a better part, but it just wasn't in the cards.\n\nWhen Pinkerton died in 2010, Strasser wrote a tribute to her. I may not like Strasser as Dorian, but you have to admit she's a class act:\n\n[quote]“I feel enormous gratitude to Nancy Pinkerton because it was her great talent as an actress, her intelligence as a woman, and her humorous and feisty energy as a human being that birthed Dorian Cramer. I am playing the delicious part, due in large part to the unique and dedicated artist that Nancy was. I am the third and fifth actress to play Dorian. Nancy Pinkerton was the first, Claire Malis the second, I was the third, Elaine Princi the fourth, and then, I returned and became the fifth … a distinction that amuses me to note. We all bit into the role with the gusto and relish it truly deserves. But I think of the four of us who have played the part, Nancy and I were wired most alike. I was a big fan of hers, because yes, I watched One Life then.\"\n\n[quote]\"I was handed her obituary by a crew member, and was saddened to learn she had passed so young. However, her solid relationship with her long-time partner, her activism in her community and business acumen, just validated what one might have predicted if you had known her only casually.I felt like a kindred spirit with her, even though it had been more than 30 years since we last spoke. I learned from her obituary that she was born on May 7. I wish I had known that bit of personal intel before so I could at least have once called to wish Nancy, “Happy Birthday! Now that I know, I won’t forget to light a candle in her memory. And I won’t forget because May 7 is my birthday, too!”"
