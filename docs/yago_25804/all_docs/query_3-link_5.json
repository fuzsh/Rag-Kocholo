He befriends his waitress, Victoria \"Viki\" Lord Davidson, and asks her out. Charlie and Viki have a date at the local drive-in. A recovering alcoholic, Charlie is looking for his son to make amends. He gets a lead and heads to the nearby Buchanan Ranch, where the Buchanans are assembling for the reading of patriarch Asa's will. Charlie is unaware that Clint Buchanan is actually Viki's ex-husband, and that her daughters are at the ranch too. By the time Charlie arrives, his son Jared has returned to Llanview, Pennsylvania. Charlie discovers an injured Dorian Lord in the bushes and follows her home to Llanview to find Jared.\n\nCharlie ends up at Nash Brennan's vineyard, where Jared had been living, and learns that Jared is now residing at the Buchanan mansion. Nash makes no attempt to hide his disdain for Jared but wishes Charlie luck. Charlie interrupts the Buchanans as butler Nigel Bartholomew-Smythe falsely reveals that Jared is Asa's son. Once Jared steps outside to greet his visitor, he is unpleasantly surprised to see that it is Charlie. Jared berates Charlie for his past alcohol abuse and for the way Charlie had treated him and his mother. Jared then informs Charlie that he wants nothing to do with him. Dorian eavesdrops on the entire conversation.\n\nCharlie is devastated by Jared's apparent hatred of him and falls off the wagon, drowning his sorrows at Rodi's Bar. He finds a drinking buddy in troubled Dr. Michael McBain, whose wife Marcie is on the run from the police. Charlie ends up spending the night at Michael's apartment. Michael learns from Charlie that Marcie had been in Paris, Texas, and the two fly down to Paris. Charlie continues to drown his sorrows and shows up at the Bon Jour Café drunk. Unsure of how to handle the situation, waitress Gigi Morasco calls Viki for help. Viki flies back to Paris and convinces Charlie that the fight for sobriety is worthwhile.\n\nCharlie commits himself to protecting Jared by hiding his identity as Jared's father from everyone, including Viki. Dorian, however, knows the truth and promises to keep the secret. Caught off guard after meeting Roxy Balsom, Charlie tells Rex Balsom and Adriana Cramer that his last name is Balsom, not realizing that Rex is Roxy's son. When Rex's investigation into his own background puts his paternity in question, Roxy claims that Charlie is his father to keep him from looking into his background. She begs Charlie to go along with the ruse, suggesting that the truth of Rex's parentage is worse than any lie she could tell. A compassionate Charlie agrees, but is later guilty as he is forced to lie to Viki as well.\n\nOn February 15, 2008, Jared indicates that he has at least one sibling when he relates to Charlie the abuse they and their mother had suffered at the hands of her boyfriend after Charlie had left them. On March 21, 2008, Jared and Charlie discuss how during that time Jared's younger brother, Jimmy, had been hit by a car and killed. Though Valerie had told Charlie that it had been an accident, Jared reveals that Jimmy had actually been overwrought because of their mother's abusive boyfriend. Jared blames himself for letting an upset Jimmy run out into the street.\n\nOn December 1, 2008, Charlie reveals that he had rebuilt Carlotta's diner, which had burnt down earlier in the year, in the image of the Bon Jour Cafe, naming it the Buenos Dias. Charlie marries Viki on August 4, 2009. Their happiness is short lived, however, when Jared is murdered by Mitch Lawrence. Unable to cope, he starts drinking again and pushes Viki away. In March 2011, Charlie starts an affair with Echo DiSavoy. In April 2011, Viki goes to Echo's apartment and barges in on Charlie and Echo in bed. Charlie admits that the affair has lasted a month. When Viki asks if he loves Echo, Charlie hesitates, and Viki storms off. On April 12, Viki asks Charlie again whether or not he loves Echo; he says he does. Viki files for divorce. Charlie learns of Echo's lies and ends their relationship. Charlie learns that the Bon Jour Cafe was destroyed and wants to help rebuild it. On May 11, 2011, Charlie apologizes to Viki and the two part. Charlie returns to Texas and Viki goes to see Clint.\n\nWhen Viki goes back to Texas for a pie contest, she and Charlie run into each other as Viki again becomes a waitress. Though awkward at first, Charlie apologizes for the failures in their marriage, and they reconcile a friendship. Charlie tries to understand why Viki is in Texas again. When he accuses her of running away from her problems, she protests but soon divulges her feelings for Clint and how she feels like a consolation prize in contrast to Kim Andrews, Clint's younger ex-wife. Charlie shocks Viki by revealing that, despite the love they once had for each other, he always knew Viki belonged with Clint, and that they both still love each other, citing how Clint has and will always be a big part of Viki's life. He encourages her to go after him, prove she is Clint's first prize, and win him back.\n\nBree BrennanOne Life to Live characterPortrayed by\n\nStephanie Schmahl (2008–11)\n\n(and others)\n\nDuration2006–11First appearanceMay 1, 2006 ( )Last appearanceNovember 23, 2011 (November 23, 2011)ClassificationFormer, recurringCreated byDena HigleyIntroduced byFrank Valentini\n\nIn-universe informationFamilyParentsHalf-brothersRyder FordGrandparents\n\nPhil Brennan\n\nCindy Brennan\n\nClint Buchanan\n\nVictoria Lord\n\nAunts and unclesFirst cousins\n\nBree Victoria Brennan (born Brennan Buchanan) is a fictional character on the American soap opera, One Life to Live.

Mark Dobies played the role from July 2003 until June 2005.\n\nDistrict Attorney Daniel Colson marries Nora Buchanan in 2005, who soon suspects he is having an affair.

Daniel first frames Jennifer Rappaport for the crime, and then suffocates her when she learns the truth. Daniel is ultimately caught and sent to prison.\n\nDaniel's controversial[8] storyline was compared to former New Jersey Governor, James McGreevy, to which Headwriter Dena Higley attributed the character's inspiration.[9] The portrayal of a homicidal gay character garnered backlash from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD),[10] who claimed it reinforced negative stereotypes.[9][8] GLAAD had recently honored One Life to Live with a 2004 GLAAD Media Award for Mark Solomon's coming out storyline.[9] The organization reached out directly to Executive Producer, Frank Valentini, who responded, \"The anger is understandable, but everyone needs to watch all of it. This is a story about the harsher side of intolerance and about one man not being true to himself. There are going to be meaningful, frank discussions that come out of this.\"[9] Higley added,\"Daniel is not the first gay character on 'OLTL.' If he had been, I would have felt a different responsibility. But writing a political ambitious character who is deep in the closet and who murders as a result is something that hasn't been explored before on daytime.\"[8] While some groups shared in GLAAD's criticism, such as TV Guide,[9] others were supportive. Hillary B. Smith, who played Daniel's wife Nora, explained that support groups such as Straight Spouse Network praised the story for bringing attention to those women who are dealing with their husbands identifying as gay.[8]\n\nRiley ColsonOne Life to Live characterPortrayed byJay WilkisonDuration2003–05First appearanceFebruary 24, 2003Last appearanceJune 8, 2005Created byJosh GriffithIntroduced byFrank Valentini\n\nIn-universe informationOccupationMusicianFamilyColsonParentsDaniel ColsonStepparentsNora HanenGrandparentsTheodore Colson Sr.\n\nRiley Colson is a fictional character on the American soap opera, One Life to Live.

He sometimes targets women at random, such as private investigator Elyssa Collins or sorority girl Madison Kensington, but seems to focus on women who are either older and maternal, or promiscuous and involved in sex work, like Jennifer Rappaport or her friend Karen Reeder, a local prostitute. In reality, Haver is murdering women whom he identifies with his mother, a promiscuous, alcoholic dancer and folk singer from the \"free love\" era of the 1960s. For a time, Haver uses psychotic mental patient Troy MacIver as his alibi; as MacIver's therapist at St. Ann's Sanitarium, Haver releases the man from the institution at the times when he plans to kill. As the authorities get closer, Haver kills Gabrielle Medina, and nearly kills Sarah Roberts. Meanwhile, John McBain grows increasingly suspicious of Haver, who becomes his prime suspect in the case. Jessica angrily defends her teacher to McBain, but when she stumbles upon the truth, Haver is forced to take action. He kidnaps Jessica, and brainwashes her to conceal his crimes. In the meantime, Rae Cummings also deduces Haver's secret; he takes her hostage, forcing her to act out his twisted psychological ritual of posing as his mother before apparently strangling her and then immolating her isolated prison.\n\nThe LPD discovers Jessica's brainwashing and rehabilitates her, but they still have no actionable proof of Haver's guilt. As John McBain digs deeper into Haver's past, he discovers that Haver has actually posed as many serial killers in many different parts of the United States, changing methodology and modus operandi each time to avoid detection. John is shocked to learn that Haver was once the White Rose Killer, whom he had hunted unsuccessfully during his tenure with the FBI; and who had murdered McBain's fiancée, Caitlin Fitzgerald.\n\nTrapped and growing desperate, Haver abducts Jessica's sister, Natalie Buchanan, to whom John has become romantically linked. In a stand-off with police, Haver straps a bomb to Natalie's body and threatens to kill her. Haver is shocked as Rae Cummings suddenly enters the room. She had survived his assault and had been kept in police protection. Taunting Haver with the memory of his mother, Rae manages to distract Haver long enough for the police to subdue him. While behind bars and awaiting trial, Haver is shot and killed by a rogue cop. It is revealed that Haver brainwashed the cop to shoot him and then commit suicide, in the hopes of framing John for Haver's murder. The rogue cop had implicated John as an accomplice in his suicide note; this plan does not succeed.\n\nHugh HughesOne Life to Live characterPortrayed byJosh CasaubonDuration2005–06First appearanceJuly 18, 2005Last appearanceSeptember 21, 2006Created byDena HigleyIntroduced byFrank Valentini\n\nIn-universe informationOccupationAsst.

Hugh then discovers that Spencer Truman and Paige Miller are his biological parents; Paige had put him up for adoption without telling Spencer that she was pregnant.[15] At Spencer's bail hearing for Margaret Cochran's murder, it appears as if Hugh wants Spencer to go free when he agrees to a $1 million bail. However, he and John McBain had planned it in the hopes that Truman would lead them to the gun that he used to kill John's father, Thomas McBain.\n\nHugh is killed on September 22, 2006, in a car accident, but in a case of mistaken identity, he is thought to have survived and is bandaged for his burns.

Back in Llanview, Irene confirms that the man with the scar is Todd Manning, and the other who had been living there as Todd, is really Victor Lord Jr.[22] In 2003, Irene had ordered a hit on the real Todd Manning to keep him from exposing the agency. She had Todd strapped to a chair and made him uncover every detail of his life. She originally gave Victor, Todd's trademark scar, but then had Victor's face altered with reconstructive surgery to make him look like Mitch Laurence's long lost brother Flynn Walker Laurence. Irene then sent Victor away in Todd's place, so that he could get his share of the inheritance as Victor Lord Sr.'s heir, and unknowingly help the agency. She kept the real Todd locked up, instead of following through with the original plan to kill him. In March 2011, Irene ordered a hit on Victor, then still believing he was Todd Manning. He was shot in the stomach by a sniper after refusing to do more dirty work and went into a coma.\n\nThe day after the truth is revealed, and Victor gains acceptance from his family, Victor is supposedly shot dead by an unknown assailant,[23] and is shown dying from his injuries with his wife, Téa Delgado, at his side.[24] Shortly after, it is revealed by a blocked memory that Todd is the one who supposedly shot him, and Todd tries to cover it up.

Tea, Dani, Jack, and Sam were thrilled to have Victor back in their lives. Victor learned from Tea that they had a stillborn son that Todd had switched with another baby. Victor was angry at Todd for causing Tea so much pain, so he took revenge by poisoning Todd's supply of alcohol. Todd approached Victor with a truce and Victor accepted, so he replaced the tainted alcohol in Todd's room with a new untainted one. Soon after, Victor announced that he had to leave town to keep Tea and he kids safety. On his way out, he stopped by to see Todd and told him that had to leave town, and asked Todd to keep their family safe as well. Todd blasted Victor for leaving and breaking the kids' hearts all over again, and Victor punched Todd in the throat, grabbed him by the throat and choked him unconscious, and told him that he had poisoned him, before leaving.\n\nOnce Victor's crimes were exposed, the police wanted to bring in him. Tea, who Victor had been e-mailing, agreed to help them find Victor, believing he would be safer in jail then on the run. However, Todd wanted payback and planned to kill Victor. Todd's guy tracked him down to a hotel near a place Tea and he only knew, where she and Todd found Todd's guy dead. Victor escaped and contacted Tea telling her they can't have anymore contact.

Margaret disappears and Todd and Blair are later reunited. A pregnant Margaret returns to Llanview, Pennsylvania, but is murdered. Todd is tried, convicted, and sentenced to death for the crime. He is revived at the last second by his enemy Dr. Spencer Truman as proof surfaces that Margaret is alive. With no memory of her time in Llanview, Margaret is first unable to recall even having a child; soon the memories come flooding back. It is revealed that Spencer had taken Margaret in, orchestrated her \"murder\", and framed Todd.

An unhinged Spencer is murdered; in the wake of his death, hints to the whereabouts of Todd's son begin to surface, prompting Todd to resume his search. The rest of Spencer's final plan plays out as his heir, Miles Laurence, gives Todd proof that Spencer orchestrated the adoption of Todd's son by the McBains.\n\nTodd takes the McBains to court to win custody of his son.
