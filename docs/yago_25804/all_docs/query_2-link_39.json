        "text": "The Good Wife's Ben Rappaport on Carey's \"Brotherly\" Bond with Cary and Winning Over Alicia\n\nIs Lockhart/Gardner big enough for two Carys? They may share the same name, but there was no confusing Cary Agos (Matt Czuchry) with Lockhart/Gardner fourth year Carey Zepps in the season premiere of The Good Wife. In his first appearance on the show, Carey-with-an-e not only gave Alicia (Julianna Margulies) a hard time about her history with Will, but also almost (accidentally) blew Florrick, Agos &amp; Associates' cover with David Lee. \"Sometimes you got to start things with a bang,\" Ben Rappaport tells TVGuide.com. \"If you're going to introduce someone new, you got...\n\nMega Buzz: Scandal's Mistress-gate, a Five-0 Loss, and Once's Trip to Neverland\n\nEvery week, editors Adam Bryant and Natalie Abrams satisfy your need for TV scoop.

It's hard for them to figure out what their roles are. If she's the client, how can she be the boss? Who gets to make the rules?\" Got any more teases about the&nbsp;Hawaii Five-0&nbsp;premiere? &mdash;&nbsp;Lindsay ADAM:&nbsp;Look for McGarrett to be&nbsp;very&nbsp;proactive in his efforts to find out exactly what Wo Fat's connection is to his mother. Since he can't get a straight answer from anyone in the know, he begins investigating his own&nbsp;hypothesis...."
