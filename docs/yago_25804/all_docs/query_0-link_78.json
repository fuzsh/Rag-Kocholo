        "text": "Dear Ms. Shapiro:\n\nThere are no words to express my sincere disappointment, sadness, frustration and disgust about what has happened to a show that I watched faithfully from the day it premiered in July 1968 until this past June -- a total of 31 years. But it is now too painful to watch because I don't recognize OLTL.\n\nI could write an entire thesis about what has happened to this show since Jill Farren Phelps took over as Executive Producer, but here are just a few of the mistakes which immediately come to mind:\n\n1. Allowing Clint Ritchie to retire, thereby leaving a void that simply cannot be filled.\n\n2. Firing Stephen Markle and killing the character of \"Mel.\"\n\n3. Firing Laura Koffman and shipping the character of \"Cassie\" off to Switzerland.\n\n4. Allowing Robin Strasser to leave the show, as she has announced on her hotline.\n\n5. Emphasizing new characters with whom the audience does not relate such as Sam Rappaport, Will Rappaport, Lindsay Rappaport, Sykes, Roseanne, Ben Davidson (and Mark Derwin is the worst actor in daytime), Skye, Grace, et. al. I DON'T CARE about these characters. Case in point: The ridiculous and protracted death of Grace Davidson. I was dry-eyed. I never liked her, I didn't really know anything about her, I did not empathize with her, I had no emotional attachment to her. Thus, her death was a non-event.\n\n6. Changing core characteristics of long-time favorite characters. Cases in point:\n\n* Nora Buchanan would NEVER have slept with Rappaport in order to become pregnant. And her actions in the aftermath are beyond ridiculous and are totally embarrassing to both the character of \"Nora\" and Ms. Smith who struggles valiantly to protray her realistically.\n\n* Bo Buchanan has turned into a complete dolt with no backbone. You might as well just tell the writers to change his last name. Clearly, Bo is no longer a Buchanan Man and I wonder, based upon his behavior, if he even knows what family he is a part of.\n\n* Victoria Lord Buchanan has become a simpering, hormone-driven idiot. I've never seen a more humiliating moment on ANY television program than when \"Blondie\" sang karaoke. And since when would a strong, in-charge, independent and self-respecting woman allow an insolent stranger to call her \"Blondie\"?? Ms. Phelps gave an interview in which she said that the \"Ben\" and \"Blondie\" storyline was representative of every woman's fantasy. A more ludicrous statement would be hard to imagine. Here's the truth: Its not MY fantasy, nor is it the fantasy of any real woman I know.\n\nI also have to wonder why the ABC brass isn't telling the stars of this show to QUIT GIVING INTERVIEWS IN WHICH THEY BLATANTLY INSULT THE FEW FANS WHO CONTINUE TO WATCH OLTL. Bob Woods lectured us at the OLTL Fan Club luncheon in April as though we were errant children, telling us to \"find something else to do at 2:00\" if we don't like what we're seeing. I, for one, accepted his invitation on June 17, 1999. Worse, Erika Slezak stated in Soap Opera Digest that she doesn't care whether the storyline is working because she and her new costar, Mr. Derwin, are having \"fun.\" She also stated earlier this year, in Soap Opera Weekly, that fans who didn't enjoy her embarrassing karoke scene should \"turn it off.\" Add to these sentiments the recently expressed comments of Linda Dano about the \"tiny cadre\" of unhappy fans (I'm sure you wish that the number of fans who are unhappy was \"tiny,\" but that simply is NOT the case), and you have a major public relations and image problem on your hands. Fans are continuing to tune out in droves and the defensive and obnoxious attitudes of your stars are certainly not inspiring loyalty to them or the show.\n\nThe number of fans who are unhappy is far beyond \"tiny.\" Your ratings confirm that. Since Jill Farren Phelps took over as Executive Producer of OLTL, the show has posted its worst Neilson ratings and worst demographic statistics ever. Moreover, viewership is down 8% from this time last year, demonstrating that JFP has not only not pulled in new viewers during her tenure, but she has, indeed, LOST viewers during her own reign. Considering that ABC should have increased viewership with the demise of \"Another World,\" especially given the number of actors from that show that JFP has hired, Ms. Phelps' performance can only be viewed as a dismal failure.\n\nConsider this: Fans have STILL not quit asking for the reunion of Clint and Viki. All over the Internet, those characters are still talked about and profoundly missed. And, more importantly, Clint Ritchie's presence on the show, and scenes involving the Buchanan Men, guarantee ratings. NOTE: OLTL's highest ratings in the past year were posted when Clint Ritchie was predominantly featured. The highest Neilson rating of 4.0 was achieved during his final week on the show in 1998. The show has not even approached that level of success since that date. More importantly, the demographic ratings surged during his return in May 1999, achieving a #1 demographic for the first time in 10 years!!! Coincidence??? OF COURSE NOT. If Clint is on the show, viewers tune in to see him. More importantly, there is an expectation of interaction between Clint and Viki and anticipation that the Buchanan Men will appear. That adds up to viewership!!!\n\nJill Farren Phelps knows that the true and loyal fans of OLTL want to see Clint and Viki back together. They were and always will be in the jewel in OLTL's crown, the core, the foundation and the centerpiece of the show from which all other positive energy flows.\n\nFace it, OLTL is DOOMED unless someone has the GUTS and VISION to take control, set things right and get it back on track. The viewers like me who have tuned out in DISGUST will tune back in if they hear that 1) Clint is returning; 2) Viki will begin to act like Viki again; 3) Other core veteran characters will resume behavior that conforms to the show's history (e.g., Dorian, Bo, Nora, Asa, Renee, et. al.) and 4) There is a distinct chance that OLTL will start to look and feel like OLTL again.\n\nIt's not too late to save OLTL, but it will take courage. Are you up to the challenge, Ms. Shapiro?? I certainly hope so."
