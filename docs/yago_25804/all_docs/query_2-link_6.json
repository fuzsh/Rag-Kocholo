        "text": "Lindsay Eisenman, a recipe and product developer, met Hilary Rappaport, a food stylist, after a mutual friend in New York City suggested they connect.\n\nFor their first date, Lindsay recommended they meet for brunch. “I wasn’t that excited, because I thought it sounded like a friend-zone thing. But it turned into the longest first date ever, and that only would have been possible if it started with brunch, so it ended up being perfect,” Hilary said.\n\nThe date ended up lasting twelve hours, and Hilary discovered they had more in common than both being trained chefs who love to cook. “We both have strong ties to Martha’s Vineyard,” Hilary said. “My dad was born and raised on the Island, and Lindsay’s grandparents started coming to the Island when they were first married, eventually buying a house in Chilmark. My parents and her grandparents lived in the same neighborhood and knew one another.”\n\nAfter falling in love and getting engaged, when it came time to plan their wedding two things were certain: the wedding would take place on the Vineyard, and the party would be a nonstop celebration that would end with a long, delicious brunch.\n\nHilary said they always knew the Allen Farm in Chilmark would serve as their backdrop. “Separately, we both just envisioned getting married there. It was a no-brainer.”\n\nThe aesthetic of the wedding reflected the farm scenery itself. “We really took our inspiration from the sheep farm, which is arguably one of the most stunning settings on the Island. We wanted the overall feeling of our wedding to align with the rustic and natural beauty of the venue. We stuck to pale blues, greens, pinks, and touches of yellow,” Hilary said. “We wanted it to be comfortable, special, and fun.”\n\nTo kick off the celebration, they held their rehearsal dinner on Thursday at the Outermost Inn in Aquinnah. On Friday, guests sailed aboard the Mad Max for lunch and an Edgartown harbor cruise. Later that night there was a welcome barbecue at the Agricultural Hall in West Tisbury. Finally, the day after the Allen Farm ceremony and reception, the couple hosted a brunch at The Beach Plum Inn in Chilmark. It was all about the food and the drinks and the people who enjoy those two things together. “How rare is it that you get to be with all your favorite people, your family, your friends, in one place? It’s really special,” Hilary said. “And I’m so happy we got to do that.”\n\nDetails"
