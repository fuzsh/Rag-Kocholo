        "text": "Marlena De La Croix, Soap Opera Weekly, June 8, 1999\n\nYou can imagine how the bean counters at ABC Disney feel about OLTL. Until a few years ago, this 31-year-old soap was a big, lucrative hit. Now, the very-expensive-to-produce soap usually places eighth out of 11 in the ratings. Ill bet its not so lucrative now! A directive must have come down from on high: Change this show right now, and change it radically.\n\nSo the past few months have been painful for veteran OLTL fans. We hate change. Many fans have blamed all that is wrong on the shows executive producer, Jill Farren Phelps. Moi, I dont think all of Ms. Phelps changes have been so awful. What really bothers me - and the real reason I think OLTL fans are so inflamed  is that too much of OLTL was changed way too swiftly.\n\nSoap audiences need time and explanatory scenes before they can accept radical personality changes in characters theyve known for decades. The best example is the introduction of the romance between the shows central character, middle-aged widow Viki Carpenter, and a brand new character, the slightly younger Ben Davidson. As a soap fan, I loved the idea of teaming great performers like Erika Slezak and Mark Derwin.\n\nI have long been a staunch Slezak fan. And I happen to be a middle-aged woman myself, so, obviously, I have no probelm with middle-aged sex. So I was shocked at my gut reaction to Viki and Bens first sex scenes. I felt as if I had stumbled across my parents having sex!\n\nWhy? Well, one problem is that no transition in Vikis life was presented on screen. For almost 30 years, we have been watching Viki as a prim, stuffy newspaper publisher. Suddenly, we were presented with the sight of Victoria Lord Buchanan Carpenter sighing in postcoital satisfaction, quasi-dishabille in a kimono? Oy? couldnt we have had a few weeks, or even months, of Viki explaining to Renee or to herself, in an interior monologue, that she has finally become ready for a new relationship? The only place I saw Viki explain her thoughts or motives to the audience was in one of those black and white confessional ABC promos. Now the kids are grown, and Im ready for my own life . . . Theres no excuse for such sloppy production.\n\nGrace is another character who was integrated too quickly. The beautiful style editor of the Banner was introduced at the beginning of one week, and by the end of the next she had become so prominent I though she was going to get the Friday tag. Kevin Buchanan a major character fell in love with her over the course of about three episodes. Yikes! And not more than two months later she was revealed to be the long lost sister Maisie of Ben and Sam Rappapport, the shows new major family. Susan Misner is very pretty and shes a nice match with Kevin, but please OLTL give us a little more time to get used to your new characters.\n\nThen there are entire new situations that dont make a lot of emotional sense. Téa had hardly gotten over being deserted by her one time husband Todd when she embarked on a steamy romance with hunky cop John Sykes. I have alway loved John Bolger, especially as Gabe on AW. But in the role of the somewhat tainted cop Sykes, the character had once been just a little bit too close to the wrongdoings of the homicidal Barbara Graham, there is only one word for poor Bolger on OLTL  icky. How am I supposed to enjoy explicit sex scenes of a heroine Ive long loved and a character whos icky?\n\nI also cant key into the new Kelly/Max/Blair/Joey story. The young, idealistic Kelly and the older, shift Max just dont cut it as a romantic pair. It has been quasiexplained that Kelly loves Max because hes good in bed. Oy! But why would she become engaged to him overnight? More importantly, why would Max want to bilk Kelly of her money? Max has always been a bad boy, but he has never been that entirely immoral.\n\nAre we supposed to believe hes doing it because Blair wants him to? The Max we used to know was a little too independently for that. As a long time OLTL fan, I like my characters to have clear motives, and I like to be able to at least recognize the characters Ive known for years.\n\nOne facet of the new OLTL that has been deplorably sped up lately is the dumbing down of its female characters. Ive written repeatedly about how completely out of character I find it that the intelligent, principled Nora would choose to become pregnant by Sam when she was married to Bo, no matter what stupid reason the show gave us. Now the show has backtracked illogically and revealed that Nora loved Sam at the time of the conception.\n\nBaloney! It was not originally presented that way. Noras actions in the baby Matthew story have so defied logic that its as if OLTL took out an ax and gave Nora 40 whacks. Even if Matthew turns out to be Bos baby and his parents reconcile, the character Nora has been ruined for me.\n\nFormer head writer Michael Malone, created the character named Nora after the character in Ibsens A Dolls House who triumphantly emerged from the suffocating bonds of 19th century marriage as her own person. Now, OLTL might as well change Noras name to Daisy Mae!"
