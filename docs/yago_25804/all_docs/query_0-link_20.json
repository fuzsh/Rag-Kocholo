Find out which one describes that sick feeling in your stomach.\n\nWhen you scramble a word to create a new word, you've created an anagram. For example, you can turn the word anagram into ragman, ma rang or nag a ram! Anagram examples can be fun and witty, and they often end in hilarious results."
