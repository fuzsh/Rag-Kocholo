Charles Woodbury Thompson (1824-1880). Charles was married in 1849 in Topsham where he was born and died. He married Jane Hunter Whitney who had been born in (1829) Lubec, Maine and died (1866) in Topsham, Maine. He also married Ann Eugenia Thompson (1853) in Topsham and died (1919). She had been married to Edwin Albert Scribner. In October 1873 there was an estate action by the Court:\n\n”The plaintiffs who were foreign bankers having accounts with Charles Thompson of Kennebunk Me and also with Charles Thompson of Topsham, Me by mistake credited on their books to Charles Thompson of Topsham the defendant’s intestate a considerable sum received by them instead of to Charles Thompson of Kennebunk to whom it belonged. Before either account was settled Charles Thompson of Topsham died and his original administrator as such drew from the plaintiffs all the funds standing on their books to the credit of his intestate including the amount erroneously credited as above neither party being aware of the error. Subsequently the original administrator resigned and the defendant was appointed administrator de bonis non Afterwards on settlement of the account of Charles Thompson of Kennebunk the error was discovered and thereupon the plaintiffs brought this action against the defendant as administrator de bonis non to recover the amount erroneously paid to the original administrator. The defendant contended that the only claim of the plaintiffs was against the original administrator personally and that the action did not lie. SC Strout HW Gage for plaintiffs William L Putnam for defendant Shepley J. Whatever property or money is lawfully recovered or received by the executor or administrator after the death of his testator or intestate in virtue of his representative character he holds as assets of the estate and he is liable therefor in such representative character to the party who has a good title thereto This doctrine was established by the Supreme Court of the United States after full consideration of the conflicting cases upon the subject in the case of De Valengiris AdmWs v Duffy 14 Pet 283 290 This money was deposited with the plaintiffs and was placed on their books to the credit of the intestate prior to his decease and so stood at and after his decease No one but the personal representative of Charles Thompson could withdraw the funds and it was the duty of his administrator to collect the balance which he found standing to the credit of his intestate In the absence of any knowledge on the part of the administrator of the mistake he acted lawfully and in the pursuance of his duty in the execution of his trust and not tortiously in collecting the money He could only do this upon proof of his appointment and qualification as administrator No credit was given to him personally nor was any money paid to him in any other way than in his representative character The old doctrine seems to havebeen that upon any promise made after the death of the testator or intestate the executor or administrator was chargeable if at all as of his own goods and not in his representative capacity More recent cases have settled that an executor or administrator may in some cases be sued in his representative capacity on a promise made by him in such capacity and a judgment had against the assets of the estate This however is limited to cases where the transaction which constituted the cause of action arose in the lifetime of the deceased and does not extend to actions for goods sold and delivered to an executor or work and labor done for him as executor In such cases the defendant is charged personally and not in his representative character. If after the decease of Charles Thompson the Barings had by mistake placed this sum to the credit of HP Thompson as executor and he had collected it a different question would have been presented which it is not necessary in the present case to decide as the case of De Valengins Adm rs v Duffy 14 Pet 283 is in the opinion of the court conclusive when applied to the facts in this case Judgment for plaintiffs with interest from date of demand made upon the estate\n\nCharles was born in Topsham and moved to Lisbon.

may have been its charms in summer it was dreary enough in winter and I shall never forget the picture he presented to my mind when he told me that here as a lit the boy he would sometimes lie awake at night to hear the barking of wolves in the distance and the ticking of the old fashioned clock in his room In 184 1 he went with his parents to live at Topsham Me Though the years were few that he passed atMonmouth after he had become old enough to receive impressions or to be affected by his surroundings he often thought of the picturesque old town and delighted to describe it In a letter written in the last year of his life in acknowledgment of an editorial notice he said I am glad you mentioned my birthplace Monmouth Towns have turned out sons of infinitely greater ability to make names for themselves but no birthplace ever inspired greater love than I bear for the old farm in Monmouth near the head of Winthrop Pond When he was ten years of age he was sent to Bow doinham to do light work on a farm He went in seed time and remained until harvest receiving for his services in addition to his board the stupendous sum of nine dollars He had worked about four and a half months for it When he was twelve years of age he was employed during the winter in a match factory on Shad Island receiving matches in the spring in return for his work But matches were looked upon as a luxury then and those received by him if they were not sold must have been very economically used by his parents He managed however to attend the district school at Topsham during its winter sessions with few interruptions until he was fifteen years of age when he was sent to Saco Me to earn what he could as a clerk for a dealer in dry goods Here he remained two years returning to Topsham in 1849years returning On returning to Topsham he assisted his father during the summer at house building and learned enough of carpentry in one way and another to be able to say that he had nearly mastered a trade But hefound he was not rugged enough to be a carpenter and wanting to get knowledge get understanding and living almost in the shadow of Topsham Academy he wished he could attend that institution but the circumstances of his parents were such he did not see how he could He comforted himself a while with the thought that a person can teach himself something and had a room in his father’s house set apart for a study and borrowed books from a neighbor In this room he pored over these books night after night adding much to the store of his knowledge but it was natural that the more he learned the more he wanted to learn and he looked again with longing eyes at Topsham Academy and not in vain he was told by some one having influence at the academy that he might have tuition there during the winter free of cost if he would ring the bell build the fires and sweep the floors He at once promised to do this work not caring for the humiliation which his sensitive nature would be sure to feel He was quick to comprehend and his memory was good At the end of the term he had learned all there was to be learned at the academy But his desire was not satisfied Bowdoin College was not far awaj and he began to wish he could regard a college education as possible for him His uncommon intelligence and capacity for learning had impressed his neighbor Rev Dr Wheeler who had lent him books and given him free access to his library and this scholarly gentleman told his parents that he would like to send him to college with his son William A Wheeler who became famous as a lexicographerrapher and that he would bear the expense of his tuition But his parents felt obliged to say that the family was a large one and that he must contribute what he could to its support He knew that he could do very little if anything in this direction if at college and sorrowfully giving up the hope of receiving a polite education went to work for a bookseller in Brunswick Me in whose employ he remained until late in 1850 when fortune favored him a little and he was engaged to keep the books of a prosperous dealer in lumber at Gardiner Me whither he went with a light heart wearing the first full suit of good clothes that he ever had He was now eighteen years of age He was married in Gardiner Jan 20 1853 to Harriet Nowell Howard who was born at Haverhill Mass and whom he had met in Topsham in 1852 and earlier He had given so much satisfaction to his employers here that late in 1853 when he was twenty one years of age they sent him to act as their agent in a sash and blind business at Philadelphia Either this sash and blind business did not pay well or he wearied of it for in the fall of 1854 he quitted it as its creditor and was in the city of Brotherly Love with nothing to do and almost a stranger But it was not long before he found employment and entered the office of the publishers Lippincott Grambo & Co now j B Lippincott & Co beginning his work here as under clerk but showing so much ability that he was soon promoted and in a few years given general chargeof all the clerical work and paid a handsome salaryIii 1859 when he was twenty seven years of age he built a beautiful villa in Fisher’s Lane Germantown now part of Philadelphia employing his father and younger brothers to do the work There were now prosperous days but the haunting dream of better would not suffer him to be content He did not want to do clerical work all his life but what he should do to get awa T from the desk and better his circumstances he did not know He had invented a number of useful things including an inkstand which I am now using a penholder and I am told a letter press but he had been too busy in the discharge of his duties at the office to turn any of these devices to account What should he do It was hard to say but casting about as it were he found there was need of improvement in the text books used for primary instruction in geography and he believed that he could supply it though he knew he could do nothing to this end during the day time He went to work burned his taper and in 1862 issued his Primary Geography on the basis of the object method illustrated with numerous engravings and pictorial mapsThis excellent work was highly commented upon by eminent educators and introduced into many of the schools in Pennsylvania and western states He was not publicly known as the author of this work It bore the name of Fordyce A Allen principal of the Chester County Normal School West Chester Pa The reason will be obvious doubtless The author who could boast of no higher Alma Mater if he ever regarded it as such than the academy at Topsham and who was very nearly self taught had not gained areputation in any department of educational work On the other hand the gentleman whose name was used was widely known as a person of accurate scholarship who had been for fifteen years an educator and had been connected with county institutes in every section of Pennsylvania as well as in other states Encouraged by the reception that this work met with its author began the compilation of his Comprehensive Geography combining mathematical physical and political geography with important historical facts designed to promote the normal growth of the intellect This important work characterized as original and progressive was published in 1864 when he was only thirty two years of age and was as well received by educators as the Primary Geography had been and as widely introduced It was compiled as the Primary Geography had been at night and for nearly three years kept its author from his bed until two or three o clock in the morning and nearly made a recluse of him for it prevented his participation in any social event or pleasureIt was put forth as the work of Benjamin F Shaw and Fordyce A Allen Professor Allen did nothing in its production further than to make some suggestions as to what its general arrangement would better be In 1866 he accepted the position of general manager of the outside operations and investments of Dr JC Ayer & Co Lowell Mass which he held until the summer of 1868 continuing to reside at South Danvers To most men the discharge of the duties of this important position would have been work enoughbut in addition to it he invented a seamless stocking and an automatic loom for its production which involved a radical departure from any method of making stockings that had been known and which as perfected by him some years later raised him to the distinction he enjoyed as an inventor Though this stocking which was patented to him April 23 1867 was destined to be made in the course of some years by many manufacturers to be widely marketed and to become known commercially as the seamless stocking it did not satisfy him mainly because its heel did not fit perfectly and fearing it would not be salable he laid it aside with the loom which was the first circular knitting machine capable in itself of producing a stocking without seams having a rounded heel and toe On resigning the position of manager for Dr JC Ayer & Co he entered upon the most unsatisfactory period of his life during which he sold his beautiful home in South Danvers at auction and moved to Cambridge Mass and after a number of reverses became nearly discouragedThis period of nearly eight years though so unsatisfactory was not barren but was productive of much that was highly creditable He seldom referred to it yet I sometimes think that during this period he best showed his uncommon attainments and extraordinary versatility so many and so various were the kinds of work he did He invented processes for making glue gelatine and superphosphate two of which were successfully used by concerns with which he was connected invented a process and apparatus for destroyingstroying the offensive gases of rendering establishments which were used in factories at East Cambridge with the most gratifying results and did some literary work a portion of which was commercial He had literary talent in an artistic degree and the stories essays sketches and poems of his that have been preserved incline me to regret that his circumstances and duties were such he could not give more time to its cultivation In 1876 through the pecuniary assistance of a gentlemen who had faith in his ability to materialize his dreams Mr Shaw was enabled to resume work on his invention Another loom embodying the principles of the earlier one and so ingenious as to seem almost imbued with human intelligence was constructed and on it in the summer of 1877 was produced what has since been known as the Shawknit Stocking differing from the earlier one in having gussets in its heel and instep This stocking which was patented to him February 12 1878 satisfied his ambition which was to make the best fitting stocking art could produceIn October 1877 the Shaw Stocking Company was incorporated with a capital of $30,000 to build and operate the knitting loom and manufacture the stocking invented by him and he was chosen manager In 1880 a desire to introduce the loom into England and Germany having been manifested by hosiery makers in those countries he visited Europe He took the loom to London patented it and sold the right to manufacture under it to an English company for $75,000 The loom made quite a seusation among thehosiery men of Leicester Within two years after that people from all parts of Europe were coming to see the loom and riots were threatened in Leicester if the loom should be shown there In 1875 he purchased a natural park of five hundred acres among the mountains of New Hampshire of which John Greenleaf Whittier who with other noted guests was entertained there wrote Surely there is nothing in all New England mountains to compare with thy place From this New England Paradise as it was termed by Professor Foy of Tufts College Mr Shaw was carried in an enfeebled condition after a painful sickness of four weeks to his home in Lowell where he soon suffered a relapse and on the nth day of December 1890 at the age of fifty eight years departed this life Of Mr Shaw it has been truly said in tribute to his memory that he was one of the best types of New England cultivation He was talented and had educated himself in the truest sense of the word He had filled his mind with useful knowledge and had developed by exercise its highest facultiesdeveloped by highest The Rev Dr Hersey president of the College of Letters and Science St Lawrence University who had known him twenty five years said in the address at his funeral that he had never seen a man so well informed that was not thoroughly educated in the schools Of Mr Shaw’s five brothers two are still living

Alfred married Josephine Van Dorn in NYC (she died in 1907 and was previously married to Rev. Swain and his widow.\n\nAlthough the restaurants run by Alfred W. Dennett in the 1880s and 1890s were popular and earned him a cool million in just a few years, some people took a strong dislike to them because of the framed bible quotations which covered the walls. Newspapers regularly ridiculed them, noting for instance that burglars who cracked the safe at the Park Avenue Dennett’s in New York City did so right under a sign that read, “Be ye strong, therefore, and let not your hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded.” But no one took such a negative position against the Northeastern coffee/dairy/beans & fishcakes-based chain as did Terrence Powderly, head of the Knights of Labor. In a talk in Brooklyn he offended some audience members when he declared, “I, temperance man as I am, would go into the lowest rumhole in the city, and get blind, rolling drunk, rather than go into that restaurant where they have such signs as ‘Love Thy Neighbor as Thyself,’ to get a cup of coffee.”\n\nFounder Dennett, born in 1840 the son of a storekeeper in Topsham, Maine, was a zealous religious believer and temperance advocate who required his waitresses to attend daily prayer services and took a leading role in citizen vice squads. In New York City he disguised himself — as streetcar conductor, laborer, or man about town — to conduct surveillance and collect evidence against suspected sites of immorality. He gave away his fortune to charity, was forced out of his company by stockholders, and had numerous mental breakdowns, culminating in a declaration of insanity after being found wandering the streets of San Francisco with a pillowcase over his head. When the Childs brothers took over the chain in 1900 evidently they retained the Dennett’s name and left the bible verses on the walls. The chain of about 16 outlets continued until at least 1912.\n\nAt various times Dennett and his son George tried for a comeback on the West Coast, operating several places in San Francisco and Los Angeles in the early 20th century (and possibly earlier) but they did not succeed and some of the San Francisco locations were taken over by the Puritan restaurant chain, which continued in a religious vein under the management of the appropriately named Mr. Goodbody.\n\nThe Sinking Springs land changed hands several times after the Lincolns left in 1811. In 1894, Alfred W. Dennett, a New York businessman, purchased 110 acres of the property and shortly thereafter began to create a park known as “Lincoln Spring Farm” and “Lincoln Birthplace.” In 1895, Dennett acquired a nearby, aging log cabin, which according to local tradition contained some of the original logs from the Lincoln cabin, and moved it to the site. Dennett dismantled and displayed the log cabin in a number of places. In 1905, he had to sell the property at auction.\n\nDennett, Alfred W. – 1839-1908\n\nBorn in New York. He first came to California in the Gold Rush days, then returned East. He was the inventor of the quick lunch idea, starting his first place in New York City in 1880. In 1897 he displayed logs from Abraham Lincoln’s birthplace at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition. He returned later to California and settled in Stockton where he retired. .\n\nIn 1894 Alfred W. Dennett of New York, a restaurateur and philanthropist, purchased 110 acres of the property where Thomas Lincoln’s farm once stood and shortly thereafter began to create a park known as \\”Lincoln Spring Farm\\” and \\”Lincoln Birthplace.\\” In 1895 Dennett acquired an aging log cabin standing on nearby property and reerected it near Sinking Spring, on the approximate location of Thomas’ cabin. According to Dennett and local opinion, the cabin incorporated some of the same logs that had been used in the Lincoln cabin, though the latter apparently had been moved and rebuilt after the departure of the Lincolns.\n\nApparently Dennett’s plans to create a commercially successful park failed, for in 1897 he dismantled the cabin and transported it to Nashville, where it was reassembled and displayed as part of the Nashville centennial celebration. He then placed the logs in storage in New York City until 1901, the year they were exhibited at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo. Subsequently, some of the logs were lost while being transported; the remainder lay untouched for several years in the basement of an old mansion on Long Island. During that time, Dennett lost title to them which has been the starting point of almost every known survey of the Rock Spring farm. When Alfred W. Dennett bought the Old Creal Place in 1894, a chain of events was set in motion which, within a few years, involved a number of interesting characters. Dennett was the inventor of the quick-lunch. In the eighties his famous place on Park Row, New York, was opened, and it was here that William and Samuel Childs, the founders of Childs Restaurants, received their training. Dennett was extremely religious and was co-founder of the Florence Crittenton Mission and other important mission organizations. He helped support them all with a wide open pocketbook. The outstanding reformers of the eighties and nineties, in the East and on the Pacific Coast, were his close, personal friends. Gold mining in California had his attention for a number of years. His bankruptcy in 1901, was the genesis of protracted litigation over a fraudulent conveyance of the Lincoln birthplace farm, and, as will be seen, the records of this litigation provide much of our story. The conveyance was set aside by the court at a time when Dennett was a patient in a California mental institution in 1905.\n\nHis restaurants were open around the clock except for Sundays. He and his associate invested in a Mexican mine (La Trinidad Mining Co.) with a purpose of using all the profits for evangelization. In 1901 he filed for bankruptcy. His creditors who were missionaries were promised 6% interest. He had invested about 1/3 of 3,000,000 with his associate in the mining company. He had liabilities of $92,667.88. He ;;was putin to an asylum in 1904.\n\nFrom the Jan. 24, 1908 New York Herald:\n\nA.W. DENNETT DIES, HIS FORTUNE GONE\n\nFounder of a Chain of Lunch Rooms in Many Cities Succumbs in Stockton, Cal.\n\nVICTIM OF RELIGIOUS MANIA\n\nMind Affected by Heavy Losses, he was Once Found Wandering and Place in an Asylum.\n\nAlfred W. Dennett, known throughout the country as “Angel” Dennett, who amassed a fortune through a chain of lunch rooms in many of the larger cities, died yesterday at Stockton, Cal.\n\nAt one time reputed to be worth more than $300,000 he died in humble circumstances, a victim of financial enterprises that were impelled by religious enthusiasm.\n\nMr. Dennett was well known in New York through the establishment of a series of small restaurants in which proverbs and scriptural mottos hung side by side on the walls with the prices of food and coffee. Beginning in the business in Boston on a small scale in 1882, in the course of fourteen years he had a string of restaurants from New York to California. The salaries alone in one year aggregated to more than $210,000. His first place of the kind was in this city was opened in 1891.\n\nThrough unfortunate investments in gold mines Mr. Dennett failed in 1899 and judgements for large amounts were entered against him. He went to California, and in 1901 it was reported from there that he had failed, owing $92,000, most of his creditors being women and missionary societies.\n\nAgain in 1904, he suffered such heavy losses in Oakland and Los Angeles that his mind was affected and he was found one day wandering in the Piedmont Hills, waving his arms and shouting “Glory, Glory!”. He was placed in an asylum , but afterwards was discharged as cured, and since then little has been known of him and his affairs. He was seventy two years old and was a son of William Dennett who kept a general Store in Topsham Maine.\n\nJosephine and Alfred had: Alice (R3 #67), Edward H. (1862)(R3 #67) and Alfred R.

Hall and Harriett Noyes and was born in Topsham, Maine, and died in Portland, Maine. He married Margaret C. Sturtevant in 1858 in Freeport, Maine, daughter of Moses Sturtevant and Margaret (Peggy). The 1860 Census shows Edwin D. Hall and Margaret S. (for Stureivant) Hall living in Milo Maine on property adjacent to her parents. On July 1860 they showed a son Charles W. one month old. Since their son Frank was born in June of 1860 it was obviously the same child.How Edwin got to Milo a farming community to meet and marry Margaret, the youngest daughter of Moses Sturtivant, a farm girl is a mystery. He was supposedly born in Topsham, near Portland on the coast of Maine and Milo is in Piscataquis County in central Maine.His Service record shows his prewar occupation as “Carpenter”Edwin D. Hall, a resident of Durham, Maine at the age of 29 (in 1863) enlisted as a private in the Union Army. He was mustered into the DC Cavalry on February 19th, 1864 subsequently he tranferred into “A” Company of the Maine First Cavalry. He was discharged on June 5, 1865. Citation Historical Data Systems, Inc.His Service Record shows he was injured in an accident aboard a Troop Transport on May 20th 1864 when another soldier fell on him. He injured his side and back. That injury worsened after the war, causing him to apply for disability pension and ultimately he died of the injury in 1871. An autopsy showed that adhesions from the injury encircled his intestine and colon.The 1st District of Columbia Cavalry was organized in the later part of 1863 and early 1864 for the express purpose of providing protection to Washington D. C. 8 Companies of this unit were organized in Augusta Maine. It appears Edwin was paid a “Bounty” of $300 by the Army to get him to enlist. He was 29 at the time he joined and had a 4 year old son. It seems likely that the bounty was the reason he enlisted.When his unit arrived at Washington, D. C. it was ordered to report to Norfolk and it was in transit to Norfolk that he was injured. A month later he was transferred to the 1st Maine Cavalry (One of the most decorated units in the army. More 1st Maine members were killed in action during the war than any other cavalry unit). However, he spent the rest of the war in their “Dismounted” camp, probably in rehab for his injury.The 1870 Census show Edwin D. Hall, Age 35 living in Portland, Ward 1 with wife Margaret age 34 and sons Franklin E (10) and William (4). His occupation was listed as “Grocer.” He died a few months later in early 1871 at age 35. They had Frank Edward Hall (1860) born in Brunswick and died in 1911 in Collins, Minnesota; and William H. Hall who was born in 1866 in Brunswick and died in 1936.\n\nJoseph Hall Jr. (1803-1825)(R4 #70)died in Mobile. On West side of the Veazie monument. He married Nancy J. Hall (1803-1885)(R4 #70).

There was a severe Yellow Fever epidemic in Mobilein 1825 with over 108 fatalities.\n\nSamuel Winslow(1769-1833)(R4 #70,75) He married Sally Johnson and raised a family in early Topsham where he became a Deacon in the Church. Samuel and some, if not all, of his family are buried in Riverview Cemetery in Topsham. Samuel and his wife, Sally Johnson(1771-1855)(R4 #70,74) are names on one side of the large stone. On the otherside is who some believe to be their chidren: George(1796-1812)(R4 #70)who drowned, John(1804-1816)(R4 #70) who also drowned, Samuel Jr.1795-1822)(R4 #70), Jonathan(1797-1824)(R4 #70,73), Sally(1800-1862)(R4 #70,71) and Betsey1808-1867)(R4 #70,72), most of who died as children or young adults. On another side is named Mary Jane (Winslow) Veazie who is buried in Bangor and apparently was instrumental in setting this stone as a memorial to her parents. On the last side is name Joseph Hall and Nancy J. Hall, his wife. Some are trying to establish that the Jonathan Winslow named above is in fact the Jonathan Winslow who in 1821 in Bath , Maine married Ruth Ann Wales and subsequently died about a month before their only child, a daughter named Martha Johnson Winslow, was born. Ruth married second about three years later to John Stockbridge Eaton and had three more children. Some are also trying to establish that Martha Johnson Winslow is the Martha J. Winslow who in 1848 married John Pinkham and had four children: Amelia, Carrie,George, and Annie.\n\nMary Jane Veazie(1810-1863)(R4 #71) Veazie monument North Face; This monument was dedicated by Mary J.

He\n\nmarried Jane McLellan of Gorham (who was born Dec. 29, 1748) in Nov., 1766; died Aug. 28,\n\nHe died July 26th,1816, aged 79, was born in Ireland Jan. 22, 1737. Their children were:\n\n1-Elizabeth, wife of Benj.

William Patten, mariner\n\n11-Margaret, married Joseph Levett, first, and second Noah Melche\n\n12- Actor Patten 1st, was born in Ireland.\n\n. Margaret5 Wallingford was born probably in Dover, New Hampshire about 1749. The date is illegible in Tate’s record but her name is listed as the first child before all the others born from 1750 through 1770. The next child was born in December 1750, and since her parents were married in May 1748 it seems likely that she was born in 1749.\n\nShe married Robert Tate, 10 August 1767 Robert was born 10 August 1744, probably in Dover, New Hampshire. Robert was the son of Master Joseph Tate and Elizabeth Saunders. Robert died in November 1827. Shackford says he died before 1796. Canney’s Strafford County Marriages states that Robert married Alice Spinney on 22 August 1770 , but this seems unlikely. Master Tate’s records do not indicate any such marriage for Robert, and the family listing has just Robert and his wife Margaret Wallingford and their eight children. And Master Tate would have known if there was another marriage, as he was Robert’s father. If this other marriage did occur it would mean that the last four children are not in the Wallingford line. Canney’s work is very unreliable so in this case is likely wrong. According to Robert’s father Joseph’s diary, they moved to Lebanon, Maine on 29 May 1771. His diary has another entry concerning Robert that is hard to comprehend: “Tuesday July 12, 1774. My son Robert Carried to York Goal pr. Mr. Joseph Prime. Rong Dr. pr. yt. Notori[worn] Infernal Devil (Lydia Lord)”. It sounds like Tate believed his son was wronged by a woman named Lydia Lord. On 17 March 1775, again in the words of his father, “My Son Robert Narrowed [sic] Escaped of Being Drown’d”.\n\nMargaret Wallingford and Robert Tate had the following children:\n\nDavid6 Tate was born probably in Somersworth, New Hampshire 24 June 1769. The family record kept by schoolmaster Joseph Tate, who was also Robert’s father, gives the date as “Sunday June 24, 1767 1769”, with both dates given in the original record. As his parents were married in 1767 it seems that 1769 would be the correct date, but in neither year was June 24th a Sunday. It was a Wednesday in 1767 and a Saturday in 1769.\n\nWilliam Tate was born probably in Somersworth, New Hampshire 14 September 1770. William died 12 April 1843, in Topsham, Lincoln County, Maine. He married Abigail Patten, 26 August 1798, in Topsham, Lincoln County, Maine. Abigail was born 9 July 1773, in Topsham, Lincoln County, Maine. Abigail was the daughter of Capt. Actor Patten and Jane McLellan. Abigail died 4 January 1863, in Topsham, Sagadahoc County, Maine.\n\nSophia Tate was born 17 April 1773.\n\nMargaret Tate was born 19 October 1775.\n\nPenethia Tate was born 6 March 1778. The spelling of this name is uncertain, and it could even be a male. Could this be the Palatiah Tate who married Anna Hanson in Lebanon on 15 May 1799? Church records give her name as Amy.)\n\nBetsey Tate was born 23 April 1781\n\nEunice Tate was born in October 1783\n\nSabra Tate was born 29 July 1786.\n\nLydia P.

(1839) and James H. (1842). The daughter Elizabeth (1836-1836) with Jordan Hinkley is a mystery since it would not seem to be the Rachel of the Aaron marriage.\n\nGeorge E. Drew (b. 1814) and Harriet T. Drew (b. 1814) had Edwin Drew (1858-1886)(R4 #93) and Lillie Drew (1855-1877)(R4 #94). George was a farmer in Topsham and they also had: Emma T. (1850); Annie M.
