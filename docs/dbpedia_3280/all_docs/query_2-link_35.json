(The name is spelled \"Pearceley\" in the Nebraska Gazetteer list of farmers in 1890. We spell it \"PEARSLEY.\"). John appears on the 1880 census in Johnson County, NE with a wife named Ellen (Ellen PARRISH was his second wife), daughter Martha Jane b. 1870 Whiteside Co. IL, and my grandfather, Adolphus Orison or Arthur O., b. 1872 in Johnson Co. My g-grandmother's name was Susan SCAGGS b. Ohio Co. Indiana, in June 2, 1848. Susan and John were married in Whiteside Co. IL, October 1, 1868. In 1871 or 72 they moved to Johnson Co., NE and in 1876 Susan died, cause unknown. Susan's grave is in Vesta Cemetery, Vesta Nebraska (Johnson County)-- Lot 30 in Block 1 purchased by John Pearsley. The headstone reads Susan O. wife of John Pearsley died Nov 10, 1876 aged 28 yrs, 5 m, 8 days gone but not forgotten. I've found out quite a lot about Susan. Her father, Riley Scaggs is buried in Vesta Cemetery. Her brother, David H. Scaggs, married a Margaret Jane VAN OSDOL in 1859 and died in 1869 in Johnson Co. Another brother, Van Crowley Scaggs, died in the Civil War. I still know little about John except that he had two brothers killed or lost in the Civil War. I'd like to find the Pearsley parents, other siblings, or cousins, where they landed when they came to this country, etc. Anything would be helpful. Thanks in advance.\n\nJulia Ryden <jryden@roguecc.edu> Update December 28, 1999\n\nPERRY - see HURLBUTT\n\nPETRICH, SIKYTA, JOEKEL - 30 May 2002\n\nI am interested in any information on Florian PETRICH. A tombstone in Hopewell Cemetery near Sterling, Johnson County, Nebraska, bears his name along with that of Anna & Anton SIKYTA, my ancestors. Family stories say that Florian was the father of Anna SIKYTA. I can find no other record of Florian PETRICH.\n\nI would also be interested in the history of HOPEWELL CEMETERY. Research tells me that the land it is located on belonged to a Mr. JOEKEL and that the land owned by Anton SIKYTA bordered on this land. Florian PETRICH died 15 May 1871 and is among those who died before the establishment of the cemetery. Caroline Joekel also died in 1871. Was there a possible relationship between the JOEKEL family and the SIKYTA'S and PETRICH'S? Can anyone tell me the English equivalent of the name FLORIAN?\n\nI would be willing to exchange and share information on the SIKYTA descendants.
