        "text": "Joseph Patrick Kruse, age 93, of Dearborn, Michigan, went to be with the Lord on March 19, 2024 (the Feast Day of St. Joseph). He was born on November 2, 1930, in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nJoe led a remarkable life filled with love, laughter, and service to others. Throughout his life, Joe's warm and jovial personality touched the hearts of all who knew him. He was known for his infectious good mood, sense of humor, and generosity. Joe's unwavering dedication to the church began at a young age when he joined the seminary at 13 and never faltered.\n\nJoe was a dedicated member of the US Army, where he served his country with honor, stationed in Germany. His commitment to duty and country was evident throughout his military service. After his time in the service, Joe embarked on a fulfilling career as a special education teacher in Hazel Park, where he met his beloved wife, Rose. Their love story was one of devotion and companionship until her passing.\n\nA devout Catholic, Joe worshiped at Divine Child Catholic Church in Dearborn, MI, where his faith played a central role in his life. He attended Mass daily, frequently walking to the church even in the winter until he was 89. He then moved to the country to be close to his sister, Margaret Mary, and attended St. Agnes Catholic Church in Fowlerville, Michigan.\n\nJoe will be deeply missed by his surviving sister, Margaret Mary Kruse Byars, along with numerous nieces, nephews, and cousins. He is preceded in death by his wife, Rose Garofalo Kruse, his parents, Ann Nester and Francis Richard Kruse, his brothers, Francis Richard Jr., John Alphonse, and Thomas Michael Kruse, and his sister, Mary Ann Howard.\n\nVisitation for Joe Kruse will be held on Monday, March 25, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. at St. Agnes Catholic Church in Fowlerville, Michigan, followed by a Funeral Mass at 11:00 a.m. Interment will take place at St. Hedwig Catholic Cemetery in Dearborn Heights, Michigan.\n\nJoe's legacy of kindness, faith, and selflessness will forever be cherished by those who were fortunate enough to know him. He was truly a beacon of light and love to all who crossed his path.\n\nArrangements by Caskey-Mitchell Funeral Home."
