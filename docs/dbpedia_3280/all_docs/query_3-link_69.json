        "text": "PART 7 HELENA.\n\nA settlement at this point has existed almost from the organization of the country. In early days it was regarded as a promising point, and the surrounding country was rapidly settled up. The town site was surveyed and laid off by W. L. Dunlap in 1867. George P. Tucker, B. F. Lushbaugh and Charles Dorsey were the proprietors of the town, and strong efforts were made to build it up--numerous Brownville citizens interesting themselves in it. The Presbyterians built a good church here in 1870, and were followed by the Lutherans, who put up one the same year. The construction of the railroad through the county, leaving Helena six miles out in the cold, proved a coup de grace to the hopes of the thriving community, and a hegira from the neighborhood followed, leaving the town in 1873 almost deserted. The present settlement comprises perhaps fifty persons, supporting two country stores and a blacksmith shop. The Baptists erected a small church in 1881, near Helena, which is liberally attended by the settlers.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES.\n\nPALMER BLAKE, farmer and stock-raiser, Section 28, Tecumseh P.
