        "text": "While pandemic has postponed a formal celebration, Detroit Catholic honors 77 faithful nuns, priests and brothers celebrating jubilees in 2020\n\nDuring September and October, Detroit Catholic is asking readers to prayerfully consider a gift to the Catholic Services Appeal, which funds more than 170 ministries vital to the Church in southeast Michigan, including this publication. Visit www.givecsa.org to support the mission by making a gift today. We are grateful for your generosity and prayers.\n\nDETROIT — Four thousand, eight hundred and fifty-five years ago, Abraham had yet to be born.\n\nNoah may have been building the ark. The pyramids didn’t exist yet.\n\nYet, that’s how long, combined, this year’s religious jubilarians in the Archdiocese of Detroit have served God’s Church.\n\nHowever they served, all 77 nuns, priests and brothers below share a deep love of God and a passion for serving His Church. Some are teachers. Others health care workers. Some care for the poor, or for the elderly. Some served in administration, finance, or pastoral ministry.\n\nWhile 2020 has prevented a formal celebration of their vows of poverty, chastity and obedience — which will be delayed until next year — Detroit Catholic and the Archdiocese of Detroit have not forgotten their sacrifice and faithfulness.\n\nPlease join us in congratulating, and praying for, the following men and women on their milestone anniversaries this year:\n\nSisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary\n\nSr. Kathy Grosh, IHM (50 years)\n\nSr. Grosh has served in parish ministry, religious education and as a psychologist and psychotherapist in the Archdiocese of Detroit.
