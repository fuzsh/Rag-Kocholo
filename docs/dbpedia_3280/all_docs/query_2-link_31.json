Yost\n\nJoan was born in Mississippi in 1941 to Eldred and Lillian Foster but grew up in Marble Falls, Texas. Her skills as a pianist were employed at First Baptist Church, where her father, a school principal, was the adult Sunday School teacher for many decades. Her mother owned the only florist shop in town and prepared arrangements for every holiday, wedding, funeral and event in the area, including those at LBJ's nearby ranch. Joan used the skills she learned from her mom to beautify every space she occupied throughout her life. A brilliant student, Joan graduated from Mary Hardin-Baylor College. In later years, she earned a Masters' degree at SDSU. Her first assignments as an English teacher were in Dickinson, TX, then in Tempe, AZ, but her marriage to a merchant marine brought her to San Diego. The marriage didn't last, but Joan's career as a teacher at Pacific Beach Junior High and then Mission Bay High School lasted over forty years. This bright, beautiful, always-fashionably-attired blond kept her students engaged and conforming to her very high standards. She loved her students and made every effort to prepare them to succeed, even calling one student every morning at 5:00am to make sure she would be on the bus on time. In 1986, Joan was selected as High School Teacher of the Year in the San Diego Unified School District.\n\nWhen she first came to Pacific Beach in the 1960's, Joan rented a small house not far from the beach. Some years later, she met the artist who lived across the street after he heroically pulled a neighbor out of a burning garage. They bonded and during Christmas break in 1974, she married Dennis Yost. By then she had bought the house, which became filled with his large, colorful impressionistic paintings and her artful flower arrangements. Joan was a voracious reader. She doted on her beloved dachsunds Gus and Brunhilde, then Holle and finally Sofie. Joan and friends were season ticket holders at The Old Globe, rarely missing any theatrical performances in San Diego. She introduced her students to cultural experiences of many kinds. Joan initiated annual block parties and frequent dinners out to keep her beloved neighbors connected. She unwound each day walking with neighbors to the beach-or to Baskin and Robbins for pralines and cream ice cream! In later years, she attended weekly TOPS or Weight Watchers meetings. At Christ Lutheran Church she participated in the Book Group, prepared meals for homeless programs, knitted prayer shawls, and volunteered generously. Throughout the years Joan called her mother every day, arranged travel with relatives and friends, sent cards to everyone celebrating any occasion, and maintained countless friendships. She lived life exuberantly!\n\nIn 2017, Denny and Joan both experienced health issues and moved to assisted living in Marble Falls near family. She played bridge weekly with her mother at the local senior center until Lillian died at the age of 101. Joan died peacefully at home at the age of 82 with Denny and her sister-in-law Carmen at her side. She was predeceased by her parents and her brother, Ellie Foster. She is survived by her husband Denny Yost, brother Billy Foster and his wife Carmen and their sons Shane and Sean, sister-in-law Nancy Foster, niece Kristin, nephew Chad, and many cousins. A service was held in Marble Falls, Texas on January 27, 2024.\n\nView Joan's Obituary\n\nPosted 01/30/2024\n\nBloneva L.

Delaney\n\nJanet Delaney passed away on January 4, 2024, to be with the Lord. For 69 years she lived her life as a loving wife and daughter. Both of her parents, Kathryn Drain (1992) and George Drain (2020) predeceased Janet. She is survived by her husband, Michael, married for 45 years.\n\nJanet was born in Bethesda, MD, at the Naval Medical Center. Her parents, George and Katherine Drain met in Hawaii during World War II. In 1957, when Janet was three years old, she and her family moved to Cairo, Egypt. George, being in the Navy, was assigned for three years to a Naval Medical Research unit. The family had a cook, a housekeeper, and a gardener.\n\nJanet attended an American School operated by the US Embassy and was transported there daily on the back carrier of their gardener Ashur's bike. Janet delighted in being pampered by the help and enjoyed the local cuisine. She was fond of her foreign \"home\" and was greatly disappointed when her dad's assignment was completed. They left in 1960 and toured the Holy Land, Lebanon, Greece, Italy, Germany, France, England, and Wales, before returning to State side. The family settled in San Diego, where her dad started his second career as a teacher at San Diego Unified School District.\n\nJanet attended Juarez Elementary School, Taft Junior High, and Kearny High School. She would ride her bike to high school while singing Joni Mitchell songs. At an early age, she enjoyed composing poems and songs. Her dad being an English teacher was a big influence in her budding writing interest, and Janet's years of classical piano training influenced her to write songs. At one point in her career, Janet's English classroom at Kearny High School was located across the hall from her dad's classroom. All the kids thought that was cool and asked when her mother would be coming.\n\nJanet received her B.A. Major in English and Teaching Credential at U.S.I.U., and her M.A. in Education, and Administrative Credentials at San Diego State University. She was a member of numerous professional affiliations and enjoyed interacting with the business community. Her entire educational career of nearly 33 years was at San Diego Unified School District, and included English teacher at Morse High School, Kearny High School (her alma mater) and Patrick Henry High School, and ESL Curriculum Writer, Lincoln Magnet Resource Teacher, and Director of Community Relations. Janet's final assignment as Director of Community Relations included Partnerships In Education (PIE). Janet had the best job in the School District.\n\nPIE's mission was to engage the business community's expertise with all the schools within the School District. This enrichment by the business community and Navy was in the form of mentoring, internships, scholarships, tutoring, and other forms of active involvement with the schools and students.\n\nJanet would set up formal Partnership Agreements between a school and a Partner. She would meet with individual businesses and match their talents with the needs of the individual schools. When Janet retired in 2009, the School District had over 1,500 active Partnerships.\n\nPIE was so successful that it was recognized as a model for the State, and PIE was awarded the highly coveted Golden Bell award by the State. Janet and the Superintendent also met with Governor Schwarzenegger. Janet indicated that the \"Guvernator\" was a real charmer.\n\nThe Navy Mayor of San Diego invited Janet for a week out at sea onboard the aircraft carrier Constellation, to see what Navy life was about. She stayed in a female officer's cabin. Janet was catapulted off the ship in an aircraft when she departed, along with her breakfast.\n\nAnother one of Janet's assignments was being in charge of the School District's new school Naming Committee. A student from Mira Mesa wanted a new school to be named Jonas Salk Elementary. Dr. Salk's family had his name copywritten, and Janet had the opportunity to meet with Dr. Peter Salk of La Jolla to facilitate the granting of the School District's request to name a school after his father.\n\nJanet's dream of writing a book featuring all her poems and songs was fulfilled by her husband. The book, titled \"My Life In Poems & Songs\" includes a Tribute To My Wife, About The Author, a collage of personal photos, and a collection of 48 poems and songs. The book is the culmination of her works, and it gives one a glimpse of her creativity.\n\nJanet's writings include the following six topics: Religion, Love, Identity, People, Imagery-places, and Songs. The poem entitled, \"Winnie Mae,\" was a tribute to Janet's grandmother, whom she visited often in Colorado. Her love of the ocean and surfing at Law Street in Pacific Beach inspired her to write \"Ocean\" and \"The Blue Window\" both located in the Love section. \"Waterfront,\" located in the Imagery-places section, identifies Delaney's Grill---\"Home of the Happy Dog\" was written before meeting her future husband.\n\nJanet's Memorial Service will be held at a later date. Inquiries for more information regarding her Memorial Service can be forwarded to [email protected].\n\nView Janet's Obituary\n\nPosted 01/19/2024\n\nDr. Kirk Steven Ankeney\n\nDr. Kirk Steven Ankeney age 65 of Seal Beach and Indio died on Saturday November 17, 2023.
