The motion to reconsider shall not be renewed the same day. A motion to reconsider any question shall not be subject to any subsidiary motion except to postpone for the day. The question of passing a bill the objections of the Governor notwithstanding shall not be reconsidered more than twice.\n\nNotice of Reconsideration.\n\nRule 64. A notice of intention to move for a reconsideration of any bill that is still in the possession of the House may be given by any Member from the floor or in writing to the Clerk, with the support of 1/3 of the Members elected and serving, which shall be immediately announced by the Clerk, spread upon the House Journal, and the bill shall be retained by the Clerk of the House until after the time expires during which under Rule 63 the motion can be made, either by the Member serving such notice or by any other Member.

The House may proceed to business under a Call of the House pending the arrival of any absentees.\n\nAPPEALS\n\nForm of Question.\n\nRule 67. On all appeals from the decisions of the Presiding Officer, the question shall be decided by a majority vote of those voting, by a roll call vote.

(See Const 1963, Art 4 § 7) Upon a finding by a majority vote of the Members elected and serving in the House that the offense committed by such Representative-elect is within the provisions of this rule, that person shall be declared to be not qualified for membership in the House, and the office shall be declared vacant. The question of a Member’s qualifications shall be presented only by a Member.\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nEqually Divided House.\n\nRule 77. If at any time during the Ninety-seventh legislative session, there are 55 Members duly elected and serving as Democrats as evidenced by the party he or she represented on the general or special election ballot from which he or she was elected to the Ninety-seventh legislative session, and 55 Members duly elected and serving as Republicans as evidenced by the party he or she represented on the general or special election ballot from which he or she was elected to the Ninety-seventh legislative session, then the House of Representatives shall proceed with the election of a Speaker and other officers provided for in Rule 1 by at least 56 votes.\n\nThe question being on the adoption of the resolution,\n\nThe resolution was adopted.\n\nThe Clerk announced that the next business in order was the election of a Speaker.\n\nRep. LaFontaine placed in nomination the name of Rep. Bolger.\n\nRep. Stamas moved that Rule 17 be suspended.\n\nThe motion prevailed, 3/5 of the members present voting therefor.\n\nRep. Stamas moved that the following remarks be printed in the Journal.\n\nThe motion prevailed.\n\nRep. LaFontaine:\n\n“Thank you Mr. Clerk:\n\nToday I have the honor to rise and nominate a fellow colleague, a family man, and a trusted leader to the position of Speaker of the House.\n\nI want to take a moment to reflect on a few statements he made in 2011, in his first address to this chamber after being elected Speaker of the House.\n\nHe said, ‘MI is at a historic crossroads.’\n\nHe said, ‘I believe in the people of our great state, and I believe in Michigan’s future.’\n\nHe later ended his speech by saying ‘Let’s do this together, lets do this for Michigan.’\n\nThose three statements alone reflect truth, humbleness, and passion — three remarkable qualities. But when an individual possesses all three of those qualities, that makes them a remarkable leader.\n\nSpeaker Bolger was right — two years ago, Michigan stood at those historic crossroads. Today, thanks to Speaker Bolger’s leadership and the support of a committed and courageous caucus, we are certainly headed in the right direction. We were knocked down, but Michigan is getting back up and continuing to travel on the road to a full recovery.\n\nWhen you say you believe in this great state, and in Michigan’s future, that means you have faith in the hard-working families and individuals that do not believe in giving up. Our citizens believe in a better Michigan, and they are looking to us as their elected representatives to have the courage necessary to deliver results.\n\nMr. Clerk, I too believe in this state, and in its future. I know in my heart and in my mind that there is one man who will continue to lead us in that direction. He promised to be bold two years ago, and he kept that promise. I hope he will never shy away from being the bold leader we have all come to know and respect.\n\nOn that note, it is with great pleasure Mr. Clerk, that I proudly nominate the Honorable Representative from the 63rd District — Jase Bolger — to the position of ‘Speaker of the House.’”\n\nRep. Greimel seconded the nomination of Rep. Bolger.\n\nRep. Greimel:\n\n“Thank you Mr. Clerk.\n\nI rise today on behalf of the House Democratic Caucus to second the nomination of Representative Jase Bolger to be the Speaker of the House. It’s no secret that Representative Bolger and I have had our differences and that our caucuses have had their differences. I am sure that on many issues moving forward we will continue to have differences, but I have tremendous respect for this institution and for the history of this institution. Most importantly I know that we owe it to the people of this state to work hard to find solutions to very real challenges facing Michigan. We know what the people of Michigan want. They want solutions that improve their kid’s education and that strengthen and benefit middle class families. Today is the first opportunity to move forward and to do what this Legislature owes it to the people of the state of Michigan to do, and that’s to do better than it did last term. I look forward to this new opportunity to work across the aisle with my colleagues, to find opportunities where we can have common ground and enact real solutions that will benefit our great state and its middle class families. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me today in voting for Representative Bolger to be the next Speaker of this House. Thank you.”\n\nThe question being on the election of a Speaker,\n\nThe roll of the House was called by the Assistant Clerk and the members voted as follows:\n\nRoll Call No. 1 Yeas—107\n\nAbed Genetski Lane Roberts\n\nAnanich Glardon Lauwers Robinson\n\nBanks Goike LaVoy Rogers\n\nBarnett Graves Leonard Rutledge\n\nBolger Greimel Lipton Santana\n\nBrinks Haines Lori Schmidt\n\nBrown Haugh Lund Schor\n\nBrunner Haveman Lyons Segal\n\nBumstead Heise MacGregor Shirkey\n\nCallton Hobbs McBroom Singh\n\nCavanagh Hooker McCann Smiley\n\nClemente Hovey-Wright McCready Somerville\n\nCochran Howrylak McMillin Stallworth\n\nCotter Irwin Muxlow Stamas\n\nCrawford Jacobsen Nathan Stanley\n\nDaley Jenkins Nesbitt Switalski\n\nDarany Johnson O’Brien Talabi\n\nDenby Kandrevas Oakes Tlaib\n\nDianda Kelly Olumba Townsend\n\nDillon Kesto Outman VerHeulen\n\nDriskell Kivela Pagel Victory\n\nDurhal Knezek Pettalia Walsh\n\nFaris Kosowski Poleski Yanez\n\nFarrington Kowall Potvin Yonker\n\nForlini Kurtz Price Zemke\n\nFoster LaFontaine Pscholka Zorn\n\nFranz Lamonte Rendon\n\nNays—2\n\nGeiss Slavens\n\nThe Clerk announced that Rep. Bolger, having received a majority vote of the members present and voting, was duly elected Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n______\n\nRep. Geiss, having reserved the right to explain his nay vote, made the following statement:\n\n“Mr. Speaker and members of the House:\n\nI cast a no vote for Representative Bolger for the position of Speaker today, because I do not believe he is the correct person to lead the Michigan House of Representative. I could have cast a yes vote for any other member of the majority party, other than Representative Bolger. This is my first and only opportunity to weigh in on the actions taken by Representative Bolger during the 96th Legislature. Based on past actions, I cannot see improved working relations or practices taking place under the leadership of Representative Bolger.\n\nFirst and foremost, the lack of ethics exhibited by Representative Bolger during the last legislature reflects poorly on the institution of the Michigan House of Representatives. While it was political to orchestrate the party switch of Representative Roy Schmidt, it was abhorrent that the then Speaker also worked to have a false Democratic candidate file to run in the same election, in an attempt to keep a real Democrat from filing to run. This is political gamesmanship unprecedented in Michigan history. Not only did Representative Bolger coordinate this abomination of the electoral process, but he lied about his involvement in the process. This cannot be condoned.\n\nNext, the Representative Bolger orchestrated cuts to Michigan’s public schools and taxes on Michigan’s seniors, in order to pay for a $1.8 Billion tax cut for Michigan’s businesses. While talking about making Michigan more competitive for businesses, Representative Bolger failed to discuss the negative impact of the cuts in school funding on our children and the inability of those living on a fixed income from affording these new taxes. I did not support those actions and am fearful of similar additional burdens on Michigan’s families in the 97th Legislature.\n\nFinally, Representative Bolger rammed through legislation in the lame duck session which concluded the 96th session. In particular, the Freedom to Freeload legislation was introduced and passed through our chamber in less than two session days of the House of Representatives. There were no committee hearings for this legislation. There was plenty of time to have them. I personally attended numerous meetings of the House Education Committee and the Insurance Committee during November and December, while many of my colleagues were hunting or on break. If this process was correct for deliberation of the EAA legislation and the Blue Cross/Blue Shield legislation, then why was it not proper for the most onerous changes affecting labor in Michigan’s history? The reason is that Representative Bolger knew that a majority of Michigan’s residents did not support the Freedom to Freeload legislation and that it would not stand the light of day. This is contrary to the true nature of our legislative process, to talk, discuss and ultimately vote on vital issues to the people of the State of Michigan.\n\nIf, in the spirit of bipartisanship, my colleagues and I are being asked to forgive and forget these transgressions, then so to should my historic no vote for the election of Speaker Bolger be forgiven. This is the cathartic process of stating your opinion for the record, then moving on to new challenges and issues facing the people of the State of Michigan. I look forward to serving the people of Romulus, Taylor and Van Buren Township, and all of Michigan, for the next two years.”\n\n______\n\nThe Speaker assumed the Chair.\n\nSpeaker Bolger:\n\n“Good afternoon and congratulations to all of my colleagues who have just been sworn in to serve in the 97th Legislature!\n\nI’d like to recognize my family here today: my Dad, Jim and his wife, Betty.\n\nMy bride of 20 years this year — Molly — and our two great kids: Nick & Megan.\n\nOur families are the ones who sacrifice for our attempts to serve the public. They never stop believing in us. They are the support for our efforts and the inspiration for our ideals.\n\nAlthough serving in the legislature does mean sacrifice for them, let us each be sure we never sacrifice our families. Please join me in thanking our families for their love and support, and for joining us in this service.\n\nColleagues, friends, and family whom we have lost from this life cannot physically be with us today. But those of you who, like me, are missing someone special, know that their spirit is here.\n\nI am grateful that this year my brother, Eric, is in the United States, having safely returned from Afghanistan, serving with the 82nd Airborne. While we seek to serve and talk of sacrifices, let’s remember the great sacrifice being made by our military servicemen and women and their families.\n\nIt is an honor and responsibility to serve as Speaker of the House. It is not a position I have taken lightly — nor will I ever take it for granted. It is one I pledge to do my best at, but one I know I cannot promise to do perfectly. I look forward to working with each of you over the next two years as we focus on making Michigan an even greater place for Michiganders to call home.\n\nTwo years ago, I stood here and told you I believed in our ability to achieve the goals necessary to allow Michiganders to restore economic prosperity to our state. I believed that – by working together and delivering solutions to our problems — we could turn our state around.\n\nThanks in part to our efforts — but MAINLY thanks to the grit and determination of the hardworking men and women of Michigan — our state is finally turning the corner toward prosperity.\n\nMore and more Michiganders now agree: Michigan’s brightest days are ahead of us.\n\nOur state has made significant improvement in past two years.\n\nUnemployment is down because job opportunities are up. For the first time in 7 years, Michigan’s population has grown. But beyond numbers, families are returning to our great state. Moms and dads are working hard inside and outside their home, and grandparents are being reunited with their grandkids.\n\nWe could look back to the past session and get lost in a focus on individual recalls and personal attacks, rough political campaigns and tough legislative arguments. But the hardworking men and women of Michigan will not accept excuses and they deserve results. They deserve our working hard together to support their hard work.\n\nThe faith they placed in electing us is based on our working to represent them, not political parties. In Capitols from Lansing to Washington, people tire of Republicans and Democrats fighting about the past and demand we focus on the future.\n\nAs I look ahead to 2013, I believe the state House has a clear set of challenges facing us that allow many opportunities to work together to deliver results.\n\nJob number one remains more jobs and better careers. Michigan workers are the hardest workers in the world. They get up every day to literally make, build, and grow our state.\n\nWe must continue to make Michigan a better place to provide a job so workers can grow their careers right here.\n\nIn part, that means we need to focus on applying common sense to regulations. We must ask of each regulation: Does it protect our citizens or our natural resources? If so, we should ask if we can make it more efficient and effective. If it does not protect our citizens or our natural resources, common sense says we should eliminate it.\n\nRegulations that do not serve our citizens only serve as red tape stopping families from living their lives and workers from finding jobs.\n\nAs we all were united in the shock, disbelief and horror of the massacre of innocent kids and adults in Connecticut, we should also be united in raising the value of life in our society by ensuring a bright future for all of our children.\n\nWe should celebrate and improve adoption and pre-natal care for women and children.\n\nWe should ensure every child in Michigan gets a quality education, regardless of their ZIP code.\n\nWe must work with parents and teachers to ensure our schools are delivering results for our kids in safe environments that encourage creativity and problem solving.\n\nWe must move past instant gratification and a focus on the next election to be willing to tackle challenges today that may take many tomorrows to show results.\n\nAnd we should expand early childhood education opportunities as investments to help kids succeed. Those investments also will provide savings to our schools and communities years later as those students learn — and a decade later as they find success through working and don’t enter our criminal justice system.\n\nFor those who choose to earn higher degrees, we must provide support for high-quality colleges and universities. That means demanding accountability and results by providing support that allows us to educate and keep our kids here in Michigan.\n\nWe also must ensure that the talent developed in Michigan helps continue to transform Michigan. And we should see to it that university research and ideas are turned into jobs and opportunities here.\n\nNot everyone wants to get a college degree, so making sure those who don’t are well prepared for successful careers is vital. We should work to develop a trained and ready workforce. We can expand the skilled training opportunities for our students to become our workers — the kind of workers who earn an honorable living by working with their hands each and every day.\n\nWe need to ensure training exists to meet the needs of advanced manufacturing, and that our existing programs are coordinated to be efficient and effective.\n\nAs we look to move Michigan forward, we will need a solid infrastructure on which to do so. That’s why we must finally answer the billion-dollar question of how to provide quality roads to Michigan’s drivers and a high-quality infrastructure for Michigan’s job creators.\n\nWe should ensure existing resources are maximized before we consider additional revenue from our hardworking taxpayers. Too often, the first question asked is how much money can we raise? But first we must demonstrate that we appreciate that every dollar state government spends is a dollar a Michigan taxpayer first worked hard to earn.\n\nIf we can find the money from existing resources, we must do so. But, if we cannot, we must convince road users how and when we will pay for this vital service.\n\nWith so much at stake, we must work together to finally solve this problem.\n\nSpeaking of our taxpayers and key services, we must remain committed to continuing to deliver fiscal accountability. We will complete a balanced budget by June 1st. While a mere two years ago nobody believed the budget could be done by early June, we will now do so for the third year in a row. That means we can change this date from being considered ‘getting our job done early’ to being considered ‘the normal way we get our job done.’\n\nEven more important than timing is quality. We can come together through priorities on public safety, education, and infrastructure. We will ensure the budget is structurally balanced and continues to pay down debt from the past so our kids are not forced to pay for the excesses of their parents. We also must continue to work with the governor and state agencies to review how mental health services are delivered.\n\nThroughout all the work awaiting us this session, we should seek to build and rebuild relationships.\n\nThe past year has strained relationships. However, we can and should leave that past behind us. We should each work with anyone who will also set aside politics to work for the hardworking men and women of Michigan, the future of our kids, and the security of our parents and grandparents.\n\nTo those who claim bipartisanship cannot exist we must reject their efforts to divide us. Those who seek political gain from partisan division do not have the authority to rewrite history. Let us not grant them the power to falsely sell that we cannot achieve success for Michigan because we cannot work together.\n\nIn the past two years, Republicans and Democrats HAVE worked together to achieve difficult change. There were amendments and votes to alter bills and reform teacher tenure in Michigan that came from Republicans and Democrats.\n\nLast session, Republicans and Democrats worked together to unanimously accomplish what many told us was impossible for 30 years: amend PA 312, binding arbitration for police and fire.\n\nLast session, Republicans and Democrats came together to help stop bullying in our schools and we offered help to parents with autistic children.\n\nAnd even in the midst of our most heated time, members with courage delivered results by working together. Republicans and Democrats working together achieved a solution to turn the lights on for the people of Detroit.\n\nDisagreeing with someone on a single issue should not taint the discussion of the next issue, or the resolve to deliver results for Michigan. We must seek compromise and improve working relationships with people who disagree on issues or who belong to different political parties.\n\nWhile none of what we do as public servants should be in the name of our own legacies, we do play a role in the history of our state and the legacy of this legislative body.\n\nThe history of this legislature has not yet been written. Each of us, by working together, can have a positive impact on what happens for the next two years and well into the future.\n\nThe hopes, the realization of dreams, and a brighter future for the people of Michigan are before us. That is our collective goal — so, let’s get to it.\n\nThank you and may God bless you, this House and the great state of Michigan!”\n\nReps.
