        "text": "Fall 2020\n\nJamie Wraight, CASL, History\n\nI am requesting $300 to pay the creators of the Tim O’ and Harley Show podcast. The podcast, now on its 523’d episode, discusses different aspects of “classic, cult and rare” horror films. The requested funds will pay for the creation of 3 episodes of the podcast that discuss films about Jack the Ripper. The last of these podcasts will be dedicated to the 1944 film, The Lodger. The creators of the podcast have also agreed to participate in a 90 minute Zoom meeting/discussion with the class (this meeting will not be mandatory but will be recorded for members of the class who are unable to attend).\n\nJonathan Smith, CASL, Beh.Sciences\n\nTwo years ago at the Hub's recommendation I used WordPress for the website my students in ENGL 434 were creating with their research projects for the course. That website, on Charles Kingsley's 1863 children's novel, The Water-Babies, can be viewed at https://waterbabiesweb.wordpress.com/. This term, I'm teaching the course again, and my current students are adding to that web site. Since ENGL 434 meets the DDC Capstone and Upper-Level Writing requirements and the ENGL discipline's research requirement, the publication of these projects supports both the course's and the program's learning goals. In addition, since the English program's goals include \"the relationship between works of literature and the cultures in which they are embedded,\" these historically-based projects both support that goal and make the results of the students' research available to students, scholars, and the general public.\n\nMargaret Murray, CASL, LCC\n\nCOMM 460: PR Campaigns is a capstone course that features a real client, and students compete to see whose campaign meets their needs best. Since the course will be offered asynchronously in Winter 2021, an original podcast will be created to accompany the class. The podcast format is ideal for interviewing the client and subject matter experts. Students can leave audio comments in response to each podcast, the best of which will be incorporated into future episodes. This format is more flexible for guest speakers and for students and will avoid the “Zoom fatigue” that many are feeling.\n\nSummer 2020\n\nBruce Maxim, CECS, CIS\n\nMany engineering educators regard experiential learning as the best way to train the next generation of engineers. This project will focus on increasing the engagement of students enrolled in the distance learning section of CIS 375 paired with the face section of the same course. New active learning materials will be created for the distance learning students to be done at home. These new materials will provide opportunities for developing both technical and soft skills (project management, communication, marketing, and interdisciplinary design). Gamification will be added to both sections to students to increase their course engagement and encourage exploration beyond required activities.\n\nRajeshwari Janakiraman, CASL, Nat. Sci.\n\nI am requesting funding to host Dr. Betsy Foxman, Professor of Epidemiology at the School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Dr. Foxman will talk to my Epidemiology students about her research work particularly the human microbiota interacts with pathogens leading to recurring urinary tract infections and otitis media.\n\nMike Vanhemert, COB, Business\n\nI'm applying for a maximum award of $1,000 to cover registration fees for two conferences and related hotel expenses for one of those two, assuming it is held face-to-face in mid-October. The \"START/END\" dates referenced above are for the Digital Pedagogy Lab 2020 (DPL) being held virtually this year, while the October 15 - 17 Lilly Conference / Traverse City remains scheduled at present as a face-to-face presentation.\n\nNatalie Sampson, CEHHS, HHS\n\nHHS 250: Introduction to Environmental Health is a required course for students in the Health and Human Services program. A core thread of the course is the role of structural discrimination in shaping our natural, built, and social environments with implications for health inequity. To best address these inequities, society must center community voices and priorities of those who live and work on the frontlines of compounding environmental exposures. This grant would allow for compensation for 4-5 local and national environmental justice leaders to participate in interviews prepared for HHS 250 students in its new online version.\n\nWinter 2020\n\nJacob Napieralski, CASL, Nat. Sci.\n\nThis fund will support UM-Dearborn students traveling to the volcanic island of Montserrat, as part of a study abroad during Spring Break, 2020. This fund would cover costs for students to enter and explore the abandoned capital city of Plymouth, now known as the “Pompeii of the Caribbean”. Students will see firsthand the impact of an eruption, including the toll on society. In addition, the fund will also support interactions with the Montserrat National Trust, which would enrich their understanding of biodiversity, especially on a volcanic island in a tropical environment.\n\nCaitlin Finlayson, CASL, LPA\n\nAs part of this Foundations course, students will attend a one-day field trip to the Stratford Festival, during which they will see a production of a play we are studying, engage in a Q&A with the actors after the performance, and participate in a costume warehouse tour. This field trip will provide an ‘international’ experience for students and will be a gateway to the ‘Global Education’ opportunities on campus. This also provides that ‘memorable’ college experience that invests students in their education and in the University long-term. Student will critically reflect on the relationship between the pre-script and the possibilities for performance of any play by evaluating and writing reviews of the performance. We will discuss the live performance as one interpretation of the text. Theater is about performance – ‘drama comes from the Greek verb for ‘to do, act’ – so this field trip is crucial to students’ understanding of this art form.\n\nDiane Smrt, COB, Mgmt. Studies\n\nI am seeking funding to purchase materials for an “escape room” simulation. This simulation would serve as the end-of-the-semester projects for some of my classes and as experiential activity for others. With the “escape room” activity, my students have an hour “to escape”, meaning to solve riddles, clues, and puzzles that ultimately provide answers to specific questions related to topics presented in class. Finally, students will be asked to write the end-of-semester project or reflection papers, where they talk about all the concepts depicted/experienced during the game.\n\nFall 2019\n\nPatricia Wren, CEHHS, HHS\n\nEngaging professional transportation services will lower a significant barrier to our students ability to participate in the IPE in Action event in Ann Arbor. The IPE in Action event is already significant for our students. Our undergraduate HHS students last year were able to hold their own in groups comprised of graduate students in medicine, pharmacy, physical therapy, dentistry, social work and public health, among others. Our students were able to showcase their knowledge of health disparities, social determinants of health, and cultural considerations. By making it possible for more students to attend, we will meet all of the aims of this funding initiative. Interprofessional education is a teaching innovation in health and medicine. The IPE in Action event aligns with the core values of the HHS department. We have three different courses – representing public health, child life studies, and medicine and addition – participating this year. And finally, we will significantly impact our students and, ultimately, the community members they will serve as health care providers and human service professionals.\n\nKatherine LaCommare, CASL, NatSci\n\nStudents will visit Kitty Todd Nature Preserve in Toledo Ohio. While at the preserve, students will meet with staff from the Ohio Chapter of The Nature Conservancy. The preserve is one of the highest quality remnants of a globally rare landscape known as the Oak Openings. The preserve is a model for this type of ecosystem as well as a model for land management practices. Nature Conservancy staff will lead students through the preserve describing the unique features of the landscape and management practices required to maintain the rare and endangered species that are found there. For students interested in a career in environmental biology, this will be an unparalleled opportunity to meet with natural resource professionals as well as get a hands-on look at a stunning and unique landscape. After visiting Kitty Todd Nature Preserve, student will visit to additional natural area parks in the Toledo area that also harbor protected remnants of this unique ecosystem. Students will learn the role that private non-profits, government agencies and citizens all play in protecting rare and endangered species.\n\nDanielle DeFauw, CEHHS, Education\n\nLacea Zavala, MSW, LMSW, Kids-TALK CAC Supervisor, has volunteered her time to present to student teachers each semester. In order to create more in-person time during student teaching seminar to apply high leverage core practices required by the Michigan Department of Education, Ms. Zavala is willing to learn how to complete a screencast about the topic, Supporting Children in Trauma. This will create opportunities for students to learn the content outside of class as the screencast will be available through Canvas. Student teachers will then apply what they learned in class with their peers in small groups.\n\nHani Bawardi, CASL, SocSci\n\nThis lecture by immigration attorney Vicky Farah addresses how changes to immigration laws impact the lives of mostly subaltern immigration applicants, emigration hopefuls, and their families. This lecture will be attended by members of the local communities, and include question answer segment. One objective of this event is to realize the learning goals of both courses by encouraging the students to consider how ethnicities, nationalities, religions, class and/or race intersect. Combined with background on immigration by Arabic speaking peoples and Muslims, rising islamophobia and anti immigrant sentiments enhances textual framing of the attendant social issues. Atty Farah will augment our discussions on Arab Americans and immigrants generally by providing examples of how selectively exclusionary laws may lead to demographic shifts in the future, as it becomes harder for peoples of certain countries to immigrate to the U.S. Students will have a chance to interact with largely immigrant guests from various regions, and hear their stories and questions and add their own.\n\nSummer 2019\n\nSarah Nesbitt, CASL, LPA\n\nDigital graphic tablets will allow students enrolled in Applied Arts courses to work with more precision and gain the ability to speed up tasks when creating digital drawings, artwork, editing photographs, technical drawings, computer-aided design (CAD), and to take digital notes/mathematical equations. By allowing students the opportunity to be exposed to and to practice using this tool, they would be able to have the knowledge of a tool that would put them on a successful, cutting edge path of working more creatively and more efficient in their other courses and their chosen field they get into after college.\n\nMichael McDonald, CASL, LCC\n\nI have previously used this grant to establish a small library of complex board games to be used to help teaching technical writing, in particular: writing instructions, definitions, translation, and the usability report genre.Since then, the library has been used in several sections of COMP 270: Technical Writing for Engineers to great success.This grant would allow me to update and expand that library as well as add materials on game design, world-building, and other aspects of writing related to the gaming industry. This library will then have more flexibility and more diversity in terms of genre and audience, but also inclusion and accessibility (for example, featuring designers of color, attending to color-blindness, language barriers, etc.).\n\nJerilyn Mannion, CASL, LCC\n\nThe French discipline is requesting funding to pay for an assistant to help French discipline faculty create and implement content and practice activities for French Hybrid courses in CANVAS. The French 101 hybrid course has been taught once, and it became evident that more of these kinds of activities were needed.With the help of a native speaker, who is also a student, the activities he will help create will be more organic and have culturally embedded material, offering our students better opportunities to be exposed to the Spanish language in a foreign language setting.\n\nSheila Smith, CASL, Chemistry\n\nTo purchase a CatchBox (tossable/passable wireless Microphone) in order to increase student participation in my large lecture sessions.\n\nGeorgina Hickey, CASL, SocSci\n\nThis project exposes students to the skilled and productive work done by women in pre-20th century households. They will first explore the variety of 18th and 19th century homes at Greenfield Village.After their visit, students will link a piece of what they saw to a scaffolded research project on one of the processes/skills that women would have had to master (such as cooking on a fire or cast iron stove, brewing or bread making, making soap, laundry, gardening, preserving harvests, clothing production, dairying, caring for the ill, or spinning and weaving).\n\nWinter 2019\n\nJulie Taylor, CEHHS, Education\n\nIn an examination of the current civil rights case, Gary B. v. Snyder, students, faculty, and community members will explore the question, “Is literacy a fundamental right?” Mark Rosenbaum, the lead attorney and Public Counsel’s directing attorney for the Opportunity Under Law project, will present and field questions.\n\nFrancia Valencia, CASL, LPA\n\nThe Spanish program together with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) at the University of Michigan-Dearborn will begin a Hispanic cultural project this Winter 2019. This innovative and first time partnership project will permit all students, in the Spanish program in CASL as well as students from the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers in the College of Engineering, to enjoy and live an unique cultural and hands-on learning experience through Hispanic music and dance at the UM-Dearborn. Classes will take place at the studio in the Wellness Center at UM-Dearborn\n\nJackie Vansant, CASL, LPA\n\nI am requesting a grant to support the visit of the Hungarian choreographer/filmmaker Réka Szabó. Originally a mathematician, Szabó has been artistic director of the dance company The Symptoms since 2002. I have invited her to campus to show her film The Euphoria of Being, The film, The Euphoria of Being, a documentary of moving dance performance, has been summarized as follows by the producer: The Euphoria of Being documents the extraordinary process in which a 90-year-old Holocaust survivor, a 32-year-old dancer and a 47-year-old choreographer create a contemporary dance performance. Through the rehearsals, we experience how these three women, with vastly differing experiences and at different stages of life, create a performance and a dialogue before our eyes. In addition to presenting and discussing her film, she will give a talk on one of her dances, which has to do with giving birth.\n\nHana Bawardi, CASL, SSCI\n\nPublic lecture:“Ambassador Ali Ajami on Public Service and Arab American Life.”Dr. Ajami, our guest speaker, describes his journey as an Ambassador to Lebanon and Syria, author and poet,educator,and President of the local Arab American Center for Culture and the Arts in Dearborn.Members of the Stab American community will join our students for Dr. Ajami’s presentation and will be followed by open conversation between our guests and the campus community.The event will be augmented by display of museum quality rare manuscripts from private collections belonging to local Arabic-speaking immigrants.\n\nCraig Donahue, CASL, Chemistry\n\nFunds requested for supplies to enhance the 3D printer in Natural Sciences for use in chemistry courses.\n\nMargaret Willard-Traub, CASL, Comp & Rhet\n\nTo purchase 25 copies of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks to provide to faculty considering adopting the book for the Community Read 2019-2020.\n\nFrancia Valencia & Jorge Gonzales Del Pozo, CASL, LPA\n\nFunds requested to extend the work of the assistant helping to set up hybrid course materials for Spanish 102\n\nFrancia Valencia & Jorge Gonzales Del Pozo, CASL, LPA\n\nRequest for funding (up to $300) for lunch for Spanish 302 students to have an opportunity to interact and exchange cultural and personal experiences in Spanish with UM-Dearborn faculty and staff from diverse Hispanic countries.\n\nJill Darling, CASL, LPA\n\nFunding request to support presentation at the Conference on College Composition and Communication\n\nThom Foy, CASL, Comp & Rhet\n\nI am requesting funding in order to attend and present my own teaching scholarship at the CCCC. The panel includes four lecturers from UM-Dearborn and one from EMU. This panel will explore how aspects of performance inside and outside the classroom might enact “a Freirian liberatory pedagogy” that highlights “Freire’s emphasis on dialogue ... students’ and teachers’ bodies as constrained by specific social relations, and ... learning toward action” and social practices (Claycomb, 2008). Through examples of student-teacher interactions and student projects, we demonstrate how interactive critical pedagogy can help students develop real world literacies that transcend understanding and reiterating course material.\n\nMahesh Agarwal, CASL, Mathematics\n\nRequest funding for student worker support to create a Question Bank of concept questions for Math 116 and Math 228\n\nFall 2018\n\nErik Bond, CASL, LPA\n\nTo celebrate and acknowledge the 200th anniversary of the publication of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, English 312 will screen the National Theater’s (UK) 21st century stage-adaptation of the novel on 28 October 2018 at the Michigan Theater, Ann Arbor. UM-AA’s University Music Society is sponsoring the screening. We will attend after reading the novel during class and analyzing how Shelley’s status as an early nineteenth-century female writer shapes interpretation. To celebrate and acknowledge the 200th anniversary of the publication of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, English 312 will screen the National Theater’s (UK) 21st century stage-adaptation of the novel on 28 October 2018 at the Michigan Theater, Ann Arbor. UM-AA’s University Music Society is sponsoring the screening. We will attend after reading the novel during class and analyzing how Shelley’s status as an early nineteenth-century female writer shapes interpretation.\n\nGail Luera, CEHHS, Education\n\nThis request is to provide the students in the Environmental Interpretation course the unique opportunity to participate in the National Association for Interpretation Certified Interpretive Guide credential workshop. The workshop curriculum complements the academic components in the course and provides the added value of the practical skills and experience required in a wide range of fields. As a result of integrating the 32 hour workshop into the course all students enrolled in the course would emerge as trained interpreters. The curriculum must be provided by an NAI certified interpretive trainer. This application is a request to provide a stipend to the trainer.\n\nJamie Wraight, CASL, Soc. Sci.\n\nMichael Berenbaum will discuss “Holocaust Denial, Vulgarization and Falsification: It’s not about denial anymore. It’s all the rest that is troubling, from trivialization to overexposure.” He is an award winning producer and consultant, editor, author, speaker and teacher. Director of the Sigi Ziering Institute for Holocaust Studies at American University, Berenbaum is one of America’s foremost Holocaust scholars. He oversaw the creation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s Research Institute and served as project director there from 1988-1993. He was also President and CEO of the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Archive.\n\nPaul Draus, CASL, LPA\n\nFund to support Academic Service Learning Student Fellow\n\nFrancia Martinez, CASL, LPA\n\nRequest for funding support $2600 for student assistants to develop a thematic unit, “Linguistic Landscapes in the U.S.: The case of Spanish and Arabic in Detroit, Michigan”\n\nClaudia Walters, CASL, Geology\n\nRequest for funding to support a student assistant to develop an Online resource for Geog 327: Michigan Geography and Geology\n\nSummer 2018\n\nDeLean Tolbert, CECS\n\nThe goal of this request is to support the cross-disciplinary teaming in the joint course project between the ENGR 100 and BA 320 courses. About 30 teams from these courses collaborate as they complete various aspects of an engineering design project. For example, the BA 320 students will focus on project management tasks and the ENGR 100 will focus on engineering design and construction but together they may complete research on the target user/client. We have found that because there are limited intentionally designed opportunities for the teams to collaborate, our ability to assess specific course learning goals (see below) is restricted. We plan to use the funds to financially support carefully designed activities that will help us assess and meet the relevant course goals.\n\nEric Charnesky, CIS\n\nWe are requesting funding to purchase a Microsoft HoloLens device for use in C# and game design courses. With access to a HoloLens, students would have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge Augmented Reality development projects leverating the UWP platform in the C# course, and the Unity engine in the game design courses. the Augmented Reality market is new and full of potential uses, student will have the opportunity to use their talents to create innovative solutions.\n\nJorge Gonzalez del Pozo, CASL, LCC\n\nFunding is requested to cover the cost of dinner for 20-25 people at Spanish restaurant Mallorca, in Cleveland. This experience would be part of the Spanish Culture of Food and Cuisine course that also encompasses a few demo cooking sessions at the HFCC ́s culinary arts facilities, as well as some film showings. This course it ́s very unique and tries to be as hands on as possible;this piece will supplement a very round experience, given the context and circumstances, making it as close as we possibly can while being in Michigan.\n\nJulie Taylor, CEHHS, Education\n\nUM-Dearborn students will be introduced to the Choices Program’s award-winning resources and approach to teaching about contested issues and exploring multiple perspectives. The Choices Program develops curricula on current and historical international and public policy issues. The program is designed for preservice and full-time teachers in the field of social studies. Each participant will receive two titles: China on the World Stage and The Middle East: Questions for U.S. Policy. The Choices Program is designed to empower middle and high school students with the skills, knowledge, and participatory habits to be engaged citizens. The rich teaching resources include primary sources, maps, images, editorial cartoons as well as a growing library of videos. In 2017 and 2018, the Choices Program held popular workshops at the annual conferences of the National Council for the Social Studies. Choices is a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization.\n\nCarrie Swift, CASL, Nat Sci.\n\nWe intend to hire two senior design students from CECS to (i) complete deployment and (ii) perform beta testing of an innovative new web-app (MI-Cluster) and framework that allows students at the DDC level to perform out-of-class, collaborative projects using real data, in a manner not permitted by traditional Learning Management Tools such as Canvas. The framework has been developed with Astronomy investigations in mind, but could apply to a wide range of out-of-class collaborative activities in many disciplines.\n\nFrancia Martinez, CASL, LCC\n\nThe Spanish discipline is requesting funding to pay for an assistant to help Spanish discipline faculty implement (set up all course content) SPAN 101 and SPAN 102 hybrid and online courses in CANVAS. These courses currently are only available in the traditional format. The change will permit the Spanish program to update theses courses, in order to incorporate the latest pedagogical innovations and trends, as well as offering our students better opportunities to be exposed to the Spanish language in a foreign language setting.\n\nJosh Akers, CASL, Soc. Sci.\n\nThese funds are for a guided bike tour in Detroit by the Wheelhouse. The tour is being developed to correspond to an assignment for URS 300 students. It will as be used to bring together Urban and Regional Studies majors or those considering the program. The pace and physical engagement of cycling offers a more direct encounter with the city. The built environment is a reflection of the broader social relations that brought it into being and shape its contemporary state. Despite UM-Dearborn’s proximity to Detroit many of our students have limited experiences with the city. The tour provides an entry or those unfamiliar with the city and a new experience for students more engaged in Detroit.\n\nWinter 2018\n\nJill Darling, CASL, LCC Composition and Rhetoric\n\nI request supplemental funding to attend the NOLA Poetry Festival, April 19-23, and give a presentation that combines critical pedagogy of teaching creative writing, samples from student writing, and my own creative work to highlight the relationship between writing and reading poetry, fiction, and creative essays and their public reception. In my classes, students complete two projects that bring their work in to the public realm: a hand-made book and a final electronic portfolio. Reading excerpts from these projects and related student reflections will show how moving the work into the public space helps students gain confidence, develop a more critical eye, and feel like participants in something larger than themselves. I believe this can help them to take their experiences from the creative writing classroom into other classes and beyond. Comp/Eng 223 is a class many students take to fulfill a requirement, but I have witnessed many students become excited to discover a sense of confidence in themselves as writers in the world. Producing and presenting my own creative work in such a venue as the Poetry Festival further enables my own professional development as a writer in order to also become a better creative and academic writing teacher. Attending panels and workshops at the festival, and giving my presentation, will help me to enhance the goals and outcomes for my classes.\n\nSheryl Edwards, CASL, Social Sciences\n\nWorking with Henry Ford College, Oakland Community College, Wayne State University, ACCESS, and the Roosevelt Institute in Ann Arbor, we are taking busloads of students to Lansing on March 20. This is not a field trip; it is a lobby trip. All participants must attend a training session about a topic they have chosen from a list of four prior to going. They will then meet with their State Representative and/or their State House member and discuss the issue with them. The goal of this is to encourage civic engagement and participation in order to be effective in communicating with their representatives as an active citizen.\n\nHani Bawardi, CASL, SSCI\n\nRequest used to support a talk by Dima Khalidi, Director of Chicago-based Palestine Legal. Speaker will discuss legal challenges to free speech when Palestine/Israel is concerned. This talk will dovetail with our discussion on the genesis of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the implications of the conflict in our lives as Americans, therefore, serving to expand inquiry and analysis into our social space and political process. This talk will also positively impact our students, and the campus community as a whole by providing basic information on the legal implications of advocacy. The speaker is sure to attract community members and community advocates, and will provide forum for discussing many topics relating to free speech, historical events, and analysis regrading the topic of intellectual and academic freedom.\n\nVadym Pyrozhenko, Lara Rusch, CASL, Social Sciences\n\nThe grant will be used to train 25-30 students as facilitators of civic engagement. It will pay for a four-hour workshop provided by a professional facilitator. On the completion of the training, students will be able to facilitate civic engagement events on campus and in the local communities. A typical civic engagement event will engage from 50-80 students/citizens for a deliberation over pressing public issues and concerns. Student facilitators will facilitate table discussions (6 to 10 students/citizens per table). A professional facilitator or a professor will lead the deliberation.\n\nJacob Napieralski, CASL, Geology\n\nThis fund will give 15 UM-Dearborn students access to Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands) in Iceland (May 2018) to explore Eldfell and Eldheimar Museum (nicknamed \"Pompeii of the North\") without increasing the overall cost for student travel. Visiting this island will enhance the learning experience because students will (a)climb and explore Eldfell, a steaming volcano that erupted in 1973; (b) study the impact volcanic eruptions and hazards have on local communities; and (c) connect content from a pre-departure, required reading of Island on Fire to their field observations. As transportation to and from the island is limited and expensive (and currently not on the itinerary), this fund would add another, remarkable high impact learning component to the field course.\n\nJorge Gonzalez del Pozo, CASL, LLC\n\nFunding is requested to cover the cost of tickets to a European film showing (Happy End, Michael Haneke, 2018) at Royal Oak Main Theater. Many of our students have never been exposed to a European film. Our class is centered around European film after WWII and the impact of film in society. Attending this film will aid students' experiential learning process and bring to life classroom discussions and readings.\n\nBruce Maxim, CECS, Computer and Info Science\n\nArtificial intelligence is a hot area. It is important to make it accessible to more people. Many engineering educators regard active learning as they best way to train the next generation of engineers. The project team will critically examine the existing artificial intelligence course at UM-Dearborn, create new instructional materials for selected course topics, and devise delivery strategies that incorporate academic research findings and software industry best practices, including gamifcation strategies. This project will help students to be better equipped with fundamental theoretical knowledge and invaluable hands-on experiences to increase their ability to contribute to the software industry and society.\n\nGeorgina Hickey, CASL, Social Sciences\n\nStudents will attend the Michigan National Organization for Women state conference. After a semester of studying women's leadership in movements for social change, students will use what they have learned to participate in and observe contemporary feminist leaders from around the state during this one day event. There will also be one session with the conference keynote speaker, national NOW Vice President Gilda Yazzie, just for students. They will reflect on the historical issues covered in the course in light of these contemporary leaders in a short final paper, which will serve as a capstone assignment for the course.\n\nYi-Su Chen, COB, Operations Management\n\nThe requested funds will be used to purchase sets of five simulation games for students to play in groups. Use of simulation games help students relate tools and concepts learned in the classroom to a real-world setting such that students can\"analyze business situations and recommend managerial responses\" (BBA program objective #7). Moreover, playing in groups provides students with opportunities to \"collaborate effectively in teams\" (BBA program objective #3)\n\nFall 2017\n\nJoshua Akers, CASL, Social Sciences\n\nWe are requesting funds to defray the cost of a public symposium organized and planned by the URST 300 students in response to their partnership with the Dearborn Historical Society. The public symposium will address race and the region led by prominent professionals and academics working on these issues nationally and locally. It was inspired by the students work on race, monuments and public space this term.\n\nFrancine Banner, CASL, Behavioral Sciences\n\nThese funds will support attendance by students from the Family Violence class at the film The Glass Castle and purchase of food (pizza) during a gathering afterward to discuss the film. The Glass Castle is assigned reading in the Family Violence class. This excursion will provide an opportunity for students to critically evaluate the film and discuss issues of the ways in which violence is portrayed in the memoir versus on screen.\n\nHani Bawardi, CASL, Social Sciences\n\nThe funds will be used for a tour of the Arab American National Museum, visit an additional popular venue, share a meal accompanied by speaker. The tour will serve as a primer on some aspects of Arab American life accompanied by an exercise intended to compare Arab immigrants to other Eastern - and South – European immigrants. At a local Yemeni traditional restaurant, we will experience culinary distinctness and listen to a speaker discuss challenges facing Arab immigrants due to two factors: post 9/11 legislation limiting immigration and heightening suspicion toward Arabs and Muslims generally, and impending travel restrictions and their effects on travel for work, immigration and leisure.\n\nDanielle DeFauw, CEHHS, Education\n\nPre-service teachers enrolled in LIBR 465 (Literature for Children) will conduct the ASK - Authors, Specialist and Knowledge - Interview program that transfers to elementary teaching contexts. After reading The Breadwinner by Deborah Ellis, they will interview Parwin Anwar, a woman who lived in Afghanistan and escaped when the Russian takeover of Afghanistan was beginning in 1984. Mrs. Anwar was not part of the Taliban takeover in 1996 (per the novel's content); however, she does explain how and why people leave the country during an invasion along the way of life in Kabul and the hardships of children during a war.\n\nCaitlin Finlayson, CASL, Literature, Philosophy and the Arts\n\nA significant portion of ENGL408 focuses on Shakespeare's early plays in performance - then and now. For instance, students are doing research on the performance history of specific characters for one of their papers in this course. As part of this class, I wish to take the class to see A Midsummer Night's Dream at Wayne State in order for students to critically reflect on the relationship between the pre-script and the possibilities for performance of any play. As part of this trip, students will evaluate and write reviews of the performance and we will discuss the performance as one interpretation of the text as part of our unit on A Midsummer Night's Dream.\n\nBethany Hedden, CEHHS, Health and Human Services\n\nThis funding request will be used to support student learning and engagement through classroom integration of the Institute of Cultural Affair’s “Technology of Participation” (ToP) group facilitation methods. ToP facilitation methods provide a democratic and equitable process for critical thinking, consensus building, and action planning. The facilitation methods also serve as an experiential training opportunity for students who will be able to take these methods out into their social work (or other) profession to engage community members and colleagues at their future or current employers. Funds will also support honorariums for guest speakers.\n\nKatherine LaCommare and Judy Nesmith, CASL, Natural Sciences\n\nWe will be adapting some already created exercises for the Avida-ED evolution platform (https://avida-ed.msu.edu/) to teach evolutionary theory in Biology 130 - Introduction to Organismal and Evolutionary Biology. This is a simplified version of a program (Avida) that was developed at MSU by evolutionary biologists to study evolution. Avida-ED is an educational version that allows students to investigate evolution using this real-world software. Because of the nature of the program and the change to the curriculum, we would like to schedule a 1/2 day meeting at the end of August/beginning of September, to train the other Biology 130 instructors how to use the program, answer questions that they may have and help them realign their lectures so that some of the principals of the labs will reinforced in lecture. We are requesting funds from the Creative Teaching Fund for lunch and incentives fo the faculty that attend the meeting.\n\nLiana McMillan, CASL, Language, Culture and Communication\n\nFunding is requested to cover the cost of tickets and parking to Mozart's opera The Marriage of Figaro at the Detroit Opera Theater. Many of our students have never heard an opera, let alone experience the thrill of a live opera performance. Our German classes are centered around culture, and I introduce a musical segment in each class. Attending a live opera will aid students' experiential learning process and bring to life classroom discusions and readings.\n\nMargaret Murray, CASL, Language, Culture and Communication\n\nI would like to buy a VoiceThread instructor's account. This would allow students to leave audio or video comments on embedded content within Canvas. On the VoiceThread website, they state that \"VoiceThread fills the social presence gap found in online learning interactions.\" I used VoiceThread at my previous institution and found that to be true. The students' VoiceThread comments were more personal, engaging and interactive than their written comments.\n\nJoan Remski, CASL, Mathematics and Statistics\n\nThe Student Success Collaborative data directly relates 6-year graduation rates to successful completion of calculus. Since most students enrolled in calculus declare STEM majors, the Active Calculus engages students with a flipped classroom, challenging worksheets and student mentoring with peers who have been trained specifically to facilitate group work. Funding from the Hub/CTF will support student mentors in sections of Active Calculus during the Winter, 2018 semester.\n\nElizabeth Rohan, CASL, Language, Culture and Communication\n\nI am organizing a UM-Dearborn writer's reunion speaker series to accompany an alumni survey. Money has already been raised for one speaker's stipend. This money will be used to pay for two other local alumni speakers. The JASS department and LCC have agreed to supply funding for refreshments after the talks to help meet costs. The speakers will participate during an upper level writing course, Theories of Writing. Their presentations, featuring the relationship between their coursework at UM-Dearborn and their careers as writers, intersects with a learning outcome of the class, studying the relationship between theories of writing and their application.\n\nDavid Skrbina, CASL, Literature, Philosophy and the Arts\n\nRequesting funds to support student visits to museum and archeological exhibitions related to ancient philosophy during study abroad trip in May 2018, including visits to the Acropolis Museum, the Acropolis, the National Museum, Agor, Temple of Zeus, the Mycenae Museum, the Delphi Museum and the Nafplion Museum.\n\nSummer 2017\n\nJoshua Akers, CASL, Social Sciences\n\nThese funds are for a guided bike tour in Detroit by the Wheelhouse. The tour is for Urban and Regional Studies majors or those considering the program. The pace and physical engagement of cycling offers a more direct encounter with the city. The built environment is a reflection of the broader social relations that brought it into being and shape its contemporary state.Despite UM-Dearborn’s proximity to Detroit many of our students have limited experiences with the city. The tour provides an entry or those unfamiliar with the city and a new experience for students more engaged in Detroit.\n\nSuzanne Bergeron, CASL, Women's and Gender Studies\n\nThis grant supports activities aimed at fostering curricular transformation in the Introduction to Women’s and Gender Studies class away from a coverage model and toward a concepts-centered approach to understanding the field. It will allow the instructors of the class to organize and attend a roundtable conversation on concepts-based approaches to teaching Introduction to Women’s and Gender Studies as part of the Program Director’s pre-conference at the National Women’s Studies Association (NWSA). The roundtable will provide the instructors with ideas to support their current plans to transform the organizational structure of this class. The instructors will also attend relevant panels at the NWSA meeting on new pedagogical approaches to the Introductory class. Finally, the grant will support hosting for dissemination of these ideas to the entire WGST faculty.\n\nStein Brunvand, CEHHS, Education\n\nWe would like to purchase a variety of materials and supplies in order to introduce coding and robotics to students in EDT 211/511 and EXPS 400/500. Specifically, we would like to buy an education pack of SPRK+ programmable robots, a Bloxels Team Builder 5-Pack , 5 Ozobot Starter Kits, a Dash and Dot Robot Wonder Pack and 5 Breakout EDU Kits. These materials will allow us to teach our students basic computer programming and robotics as well as show them a variety of ways they can integrate coding and robotics across the curriculum.\n\nYi-Su Chen, COB, Management\n\nThe funding request will be used to pay for five sets of the Pandemic Board Game. The board game can be used repeatedly whenever the said courses are offered.\n\nTimothy Davis, COB, Management\n\nTo help emphasize that many of the products we use are designed around the needs of people. I plan to use two types of experiences for students. The first will include multiple sessions where students are exposed to a variety of products (some they won't be familiar with and others they will know a great deal about) and either guess their purpose or experiment with them and suggest improvements. The second will be an online simulation where students interview virtual customers about a new discovery and how those needs can translate into solutions (new product ideas).\n\nMarouane Kessentini, CECS, Computer and Information Science\n\nTitle: Gamifying and Socializing Teaching and Learning of Software Engineering Summary: This project focuses on gamifying and socializing teaching and learning of software engineering,which can serve as an effective complement to formal classroom teaching and learning.Specifically, it is achieved by designing a social game on mobile devices. The game consists of a series of worlds to be explored (i.e., representing different phases of the life cycle of software engineering, ranging from requirements engineering and architectural design to implementation and software testing). Each world has several sections (i.e., representing specific topics of each phase from basic ones to advanced ones), and each section has several levels (i.e., representing choice questions relevant to specific topics, getting increasingly challenging). The game has a leader board to keep the players engaged. The game targets students and teachers from introductory to advanced software engineering courses (CIS375)\n\nJung Hyun Lee, COB, Management\n\nStudents in OB354 and HR305 often tend to have diverse backgrounds including their major and working experience. Stimulating individual students' interest and participation in classroom is a key to achieving learning objectives of these courses. I am applying for the CFT to make the class(es) more interactive and engaging by introducing a clicker-free classroom response system (Poll Everywhere) and a web-based communication application (VoiceThread). Through these systems, I'm hoping to systematically collect/monitor students' reactions, diagnose misconceptions and promote more engaging interactions among students.\n\nSimona Marcincean and Sheila Smith, CASL, Natural Sciences\n\nLaboratory notebooks are a fundamental aspect of evidentiary science. In teaching laboratories, we use notebooks at assess the quality of student work. In industrial research settings, notebooks are used to establish invention, to document discovery and to ensure reproducibility. Training in proper documentation is an essential part of a chemists' education. Industrial and government research settings are turning to electronic notebooks for convenience, collaboration, reliability and integrity. We seek the same benefits in teaching laboratories for our students and ourselves. Funds will be used to explore and implement the use of electronic notebooks in undergraduate level teaching laboratories.\n\nBruce Maxim, CECS, Computer and Information Science\n\nMany engineering educators regard experiential and active learning as the best way to train the next generation of engineers. The project team will critically examine an existing game design course at University of Michigan-Dearborn, create new instructional materials for selected course topics and devise the delivery strategies that incorporate academic research findings and software industry best practices including gamification strategies. This project will help students to be better equipped with fundamental theoretical knowledge and invaluable hands-on experiences that can measurably increase their ability to contribute to the software industry.\n\nJennifer Proctor, CASL, Language, Culture and Communication\n\nThis request is for the purchase of Super 8 cameras and film and an HTC Vive virtual reality system to support JASS 405: New and Emerging Media in the immediate term, and the larger JASS curriculum and CASL community in the longer term. These technologies will provide students with experiences in hand-on, tactile, and embodied media expression, while also opening up the experience of virtual reality to faculty, staff and students who wish to use it for their own innovations.\n\nJennifer Proctor, CASL, Language, Culture and Communication\n\nThis request would partially fund the hiring of a research assistant to develop and expand an online database of inclusive teaching resources in media production pedagogy.\n\nElizabeth Rohan, CASL, Language, Culture and Communication\n\nThis assessment apparatus studies the transfer of skills from academic to vocational contexts through an electronic survey from alumni writing center consultants and writing certificate recipients. It measures also the relationship between theory and practice emphasized in writing center methods and built into the reflection component of the writing certificate. A speaker series of alumni will accompany the gathering of data through an electronic survey. The survey will be used as a continuing apparatus for graduated UM-Dearborn alumni and copy from the survey and the speakers will be repurposed as publicity material for the certificate and for CASL.\n\nJulie Anne Taylor, CEHHS, Education\n\nIn advance of his March visit, Khalid el-Hakim, curator of the Black History 101 Mobile Museum,will lead a discussion on teaching with primary historical documents. el-Hakim will bring authentic sources for analysis and discussion. In advance of his March 2018 visit to UM-Dearborn, he will discuss the role of mobile museums in K-12 and college education.\n\nWinter 2017\n\nJoshua Akers, CASL, Social Sciences\n\nThese funds will allow students to access various geospatial data set that allow them to create strategy maps that assist Detroit Eviction Defense in their work to keep people in their homes.\n\nMarilee Benore, CASL, Natural Sciences\n\nMany of us have discussed a team taught class or seminar series about the Science of Images (or other intersecting topics). If you are receiving this email, it is because you have an interest and/or experience in this topic. I think the Science of Images includes optics, ink, paper, traditional film, video, camera lenses, digital images, the human eye, the physics of light and movement, glass, maps, chemistry, schlierin waves, cyanotypes,quilting, dyes, and many other topics! If you would like to explore how we might go about creating a course or series, please doodle poll yourself for a meeting the last week in January. I think this is just the beginning, and there are many possibilities to explore. My role is just to bring people together for brainstorming. We already have a Natural Science 390 topics core, and it could easily fit into that core. A bigger issue (and conversation) is a mechanism to team teach.\n\nJohn Chenoweth, CASL, Behavioral Sciences\n\nPart of the class is the critical analysis of representations of or statements about the past in the public sphere. One of the assignments requires students to visit a museum and critically analyze it's selective representation of history. This year, the DIA is presenting an exhibit called \"Bitter Sweet\" on tea, coffee and chocolate, which closely relates to my research on slavery-based 18th century plantations (which made these products and sugar, which was mainly consumed in them). Though the DIA is free to most of our students, the special exhibit is not, and costs $10 per person. I am requesting funding for myself and all students registered for the class, up to a total of 21 people, or $210.00.\n\nMaureen Linker, CASL, Literature, Philosophy and the Arts\n\nJonathan Lethem, the Roy Edward Disney Professor of Creative Writing at Pomona College will be on campus to give a creative writing workshop for English majors as well as a public lecture on the writing process and the processes involved in publishing fiction.\n\nLara Rusch, CASL, Social Sciences\n\nThis is a request to video-record a presentation by visiting speaker Tamar Carroll on her book, Mobilizing New York, so that I can show the event to my online course, POL 466/566 (Social Welfare Policy and Politics), and to future students in POL 334 (Organizing and Leadership).\n\nFall 2016\n\nAnna Muller, CASL, Social Sciences\n\nI am applying for $1000 for an honorarium for four speakers. All of them will give lectures in conjunction with the Forbidden Art exhibition that our campus gallery will host this fall. The class that I will teach this fall: Hist390V, Forbidden Art is also structured around the exhibition. In addition to four lectures that will take place on our campus, all speakers will have workshops that are vital for students who are enrolled in Hist390V (11 students at this point), but can also offer a lot in terms of educational opportunities to other students on our campus as well. The workshop and meetings will be open to all students on our campus, but they will be obligatory to my students. Jamie Wraight is going to offer extra credit to his students who participate in either talks or workshop. I have also begun communicating with Art History hoping that they will encourage their students to do the same. The first speaker and person who will open the exhibition is Teresa Wontor Cichy, a curator from the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. The second speaker is Barbara Milewski, an Associate Professor of Music at Swarthmore College. In October, she will give a lecture titled “Musical Remembrances of Love and Death from Auschwitz-Birkenau.” In class she will lead a workshop about various pieces of music created in different concentration camps. The third speaker is Jonathan Huener, an Associate Professor of History at the University of Vermont. His research is focused on public memory in post-World War II Germany and Poland, Polish-Jewish relations, and Auschwitz. The fourth speaker is Wojtek Sawa, a visual artist and most recently the author of an exhibition titled The Walls Speak. At the starting point, it looks at the experiences of children during WWII, but the message it conveys is centered on racism and other forms of discrimination. In November, he will display a digital presentation in the library. After the presentation, he will have a workshop with my class on recording, presenting, and interpreting oral interviews.\n\nBruce Maxim, CECS, Computer and Information Systems\n\nMany engineering educators regard experiential learning as the best way to train the next generation of engineers. This requires engineering programs to go beyond simply offering industry-based capstone courses and internships. In this project, we will be exploring the use of a term long role playing activity to shape the students' experiences as they complete their team project (an original 3D game). This project includes incremental product deliveries using accepted game industry milestones. We will be creating instructional role play activities that emphasize industry best practices for both technical and soft skills (project management, communication, marketing and interdisciplinary design).\n\nDanielle DeFauw, CEHHS, Education\n\nAward winning children’s book author of the Wilder Trilogy, Diane Bradley, will share her experiences as a writer. First, pre-service teachers enrolled in LIBR 465 (Literature for Children) will conduct the ASK (Authors, Specialists and Knowledge) Interview assignment requirements that transfer to elementary teaching contexts; EXPS 298 (Writing to Communicate, Learn and Teach) pre-service teachers will be invited to attend the ASK event. Second, EXPS 298’s Writing Clinic, hosted at Henry Ford Elementary, includes third-grade students, their families and their EXPS 298 tutors; together, they will celebrate literacy with Diane Bradley as she shares her writer’s craft insights.\n\nGabriella Scarlatta, CASL, Language, Culture and Communication, Jerilynn Mannion, CASL, Language, Culture and Communication\n\nThis fund will allow us to decrease the cost of the trip to France which will lead students to important historical sites and cities that they study in French 336: French Civilization of the Past. Visiting these sites will allow students to engage with a real-life experience and impact their lives as culturally and globally educated students. While in France, students will also participate in lectures by Prof. Scarlatta, and guided tours by professional guides; they will prepare questions ahead of the visit for the guides; and keep a journal online, as well as participate in discussions online and prepare a presentation for French 336 in the Fall.\n\nJorge Gonzalez del Pozo, CASL, Language, Culture and Communication\n\nSPAN 321, Spanish Culture of Food and Cuisine is a course that offers a panoramic on the rich and hybrid culinary tradition that is a symbol of the amalgamation of cultures and civilizations that have settled in the Iberian Peninsula through the centuries. Several times (4) during the semester cooking demos in the facilities of Henry Ford Community college will be offered. In order to develop these special events some food, ingredients and main products are needed. This support will help tremendously covering costs of not-so-conventional teaching materials needed for this course.\n\nJorge Gonzalez del Pozo, CASL, Language, Culture and Communication\n\nIn order to improve SPAN 356 \"Spanish Civilization and Culture\" and add a distance learning component to the class, I am requesting support towards registering and attending workshops in Visual Thinking Strategies training. VTS is a sound and growing teaching approach that focuses on integrating paintings, video and visual materials, mainly from high (traditional) culture, to promote expression, articulation of ideas, class discussion and participation; all while learning about cultural matters related to the materials presented aligned with the course contents. I would be delighted to present a workshop for M&CL or LC&C regarding my learning experience in these workshops and share it with colleagues. More info here http://.vtshome.org/\n\nKim Killu, CEHHS, Education\n\nThe University of Michigan Integrative Medicine Program offers a year-long multidisciplinary Faculty Scholars Program to explore the principles and practices of integrative therapies. The program is designed to extend resources to faculty that can be applied to teaching, research, and clinical care in the area of integrative health. In light of the recent CEHHS expansion to the Department of Health and Human Services and the pursuit of converging the disciplines of education and health and human services, I intend to apply to the Faculty Scholars Program in order to develop a course on Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) (i.e., a) emotional, physical,or sexual abuse, b) emotional or physical neglect, c) witnessing domestic violence (especially against mothers), d) household substance abuse, e) the presence of mental illness in a household member, f) parental separation or divorce, and g) an incarcerated household member), and the implications of those ACEs to one’s cognitive, social, emotional, psychological, behavioral, health, and academic functioning. The Faculty Scholars Program would provide me with the training and resources to develop the course and learn from a multidisciplinary group on the integration of health and medicine into the educational domain.\n\nPhilip Potvin, CASL, Language, Culture and Communication, Writing Program and Honors Program\n\n\"Walking the Talk in Detroit's Eastern Market\" builds on DeCerteau (1984), Kivel (2000) and Elbow (2007) to investigate innovative uses of student-generated audio podcasts in the first-year writing classroom. Through historic walking tours guided by Preservation Detroit, student groups engaged in primary and secondary research. What challenges and rewards did students encounter? How did this research challenge, reinforce or expand preconceptions? How did students compile, organize and write audience-centered scripts? How did students craft audio recordings for public audiences while expanding personal agency and voice? How can these projects encourage other student writers to make some noise?\n\nSheila Smith, CASL, Natural Sciences\n\nFunds are requested for partial support for attendance and presentation at the Lilly Conference on Evidence Based Teaching, October 20-22, 2016 in Traverse City.\n\nAnna Muller, CASL Social Sciences\n\nI am applying for $1000 towards the Poland Study Abroad program. In summer 2017, I plan to take a group of 15 students to Poland (and Ukraine) for almost four weeks for a class to explore Polish culture and history. During the trip, students will take a class titled: Memory and Oblivion: Multicultural Past and Its Presence in the Eastern European Contemporary Landscape. The class will focus on the culturally diverse history of the lands within the broad region historically encompassed by the Polish state. While doing this, there will be a special emphasis on Polish-Jewish relationships. In addition to 10 class meetings conducted in Poland, during which the students will discuss the assigned material, the class will travel around Poland, visit various museums and memory sites, and participate in workshops with local historians and researchers. I am planning on using the money for tickets to museums and as honoraria for historians who will be organizing various workshops with us.\n\nSummer 2016\n\nEmily Matthews Luxon, CASL, Social Sciences\n\nThere are wonderful methods and approaches to innovative teaching out there, but implementing them in one’s own classes often requires reference to explanations and examples. To that end, this request is intended to purchase several reference books, to have on hand and with easy access, so that some of these new approaches can be incorporated slowly and thoughtfully over time into several Political Science courses (cross-listed with Environmental Studies, and fulfilling DDC requirements).\n\nAmy Brainer, CASL, College Wide Programs\n\nThese funds will support a photography project in Sexualities, Genders and Bodies, an upper level seminar cross-listed with Women's and Gender Studies, the Humanities and Sociology. Following the interdisciplinary spirit of the course, students will use photography to integrate social theory with the world around them. Each student will select a course concept to represent visually and write an accompanying paper contextualizing the image. At the end of the term, students will display their photographs and abstracts as part of an exhibit open to the wider campus. The exhibit seeks to dispel stereotypes about LGBTQ people and cultures and engage the campus in dialogue around these issues.\n\nWinter 2016\n\nDavid Hill, CEHHS, Education\n\nThe primary goal for students enrolled in EDN 401 is to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges students with learning disabilities encounter in K12 education. It is one thing to read about the experiences through expository text but it is quite different when students actually experience it through active learning what it is like to have a disability. That said, funds from this grant will be used to purchase a variety of simulators that will allow students to experience first-hand the challenges associated with a sensory deficit on academics.\n\nSimona Maricean, CASL, Natural Sciences\n\nFunding is requested towards purchase of Livescribe Pen 3 to be used in Organic Chemistry courses, CHEM 225 and CHEM 226. Electronic documents, problem set and exam keys, that will have synchronized audio explanations will be created. The students will access the documents via the web-portal and be able to review them at a pace that will suit their learning abilities. The pen will be used to generate instructor notes, answers to in-class questions and solutions to group work problems assigned during lecture, that will be projected on-the-fly through the wifi network. The interactive nature of the lecture will be enhanced significantly by incorporation of Livescribe pen and will come to no additional cost to the students.\n\nJamie Wraight, CASL, Social Sciences\n\nOn Friday, April 15, 2016, the Voice/Vision Archive, along with Phi Alpha Theta, will host a talk by Holocaust survivor, Irene Miller. Irene will speak about her experiences during the Second World War, as well as about promoting tolerance and diversity, inspiring positive action and empowering people to overcome obstacles in life. Following her talk, Irene will be signing copies of her book, \"Into No Man's Land: A Historical Memoir,\" published by the University of Michigan-Dearborn Press (2013).\n\nFall 2015\n\nDiana Smrt, COB, Management Studies\n\nUM-Dearborn aims at delivering excellent, student-focused education. Consistent with our University mission, I am seeking support to create a hands-on simulation for our business students. The simulation will mimic the Amazing Race TV show and will allow students to: 1) learn and apply, on their own, business concepts in an engaging and interactive way, 2) sharpen their critical thinking and communication skills, 3) recognize the critical role of teamwork. The funds will be used to purchase supplies to assure that the simulation is authentic and, ultimately, a success for student generations to come. Thank you for your consideration!\n\nJisu Han, CEHHS, Education\n\nI am requesting a Creative Teaching Fund grant that can be used to purchase early childhood assessment materials. These tools include the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, the Developmental Profile, the Ounce Scale and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. In EDC 445/545: Developmental Assessment of the Young Child, students acquire knowledge regarding various early childhood assessment tools appropriate for use in assessing the development of young children. As class assignments, students will have an opportunity to practice administering assessments using these instruments with young children and to review and evaluate the tools. Because some of the proposed assessment tools can be used to assess the development of infants and toddlers, students in EDC 440/541: The Child: Birth to Three will benefit from these resources as well.\n\nBochen Jia, CECS, Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering\n\nThe funds will be used to support student study with hands-on experiences, such as, student projects with real-world case study or as well as student nationwide competition activities. In particular, through this fund, students will receive necessary equipment to conduct any in-field tests to solve real-world issues. In addition, students will also receive financial support to participate in nationwide competition to start creative initiatives and gain hands-on experience.\n\nYi-Su Chen, COB, Management Studies\n\nThe funding request will be used to pay for software for students' term project, possibly data set, along with honorariums for guest speakers.\n\nWilliam DeGenaro, CASL, Writing Program\n\nThe Writing Program is piloting three sections of an innovative, one-credit \"Writing Studio\" course this Winter, 2016. Studio pedagogy is intensely student-centered and predicated on supplemental instruction in writing. Studio \"participants\" (course enrollees) concurrently enroll in an Introduction Composition or upper-level writing-intensive course; in studio, they bring in artifacts like essay drafts from their writing classes and receive support from peers and from studio instructor Mike MacDonald. The present request is to pay a stipend ($500) to an imbedded \"Writing Fellow\" (an experienced writing center consultant) to provide additional feedback on works-in-progress and to assist the instructor providing targeted one-on-one support to each participant.\n\nWinter 2015\n\nMichelle Leonard, CASL, Behavioral Sciences\n\nStudents in the health psychology graduate programs are given research-oriented training specializing in health and behavioral medicine. As part of their curriculum, a new course, Applied Research in Behavioral Medicine (Psych 584), was developed. Funding for this course allows students the opportunity to have intensive hands on training with physiological data collection methods (e.g., ECG, EEG, GSR, acute pain, etc…), data analysis and presentation of results; ultimately enhancing the talent students can take into the workforce upon graduation.\n\nJamie Wraight, CASL, Social Sciences\n\nOn April 13, 2015, the above organizations will hold a Holocaust Remembrance event in Kochoff Hall. The event will include poster presentations by student enrolled in history 387 and 389, as well as members of the Jewish Student Organization and Phi Alpha Theta. There will also be a screening of the documentary, Never A Bystander, a film about Irene Butter, a local Holocaust survivor. The screening will be accompanied by a talk by Mrs. Butter and the creator of the film, Evelyn Neuhaus.\n\nHyejin Kim, CASL, Mathematics and Statistics\n\nThe Department of Mathematics and Statistics offers a special topic course, \"Preparation for Industrial Careers in Mathematical Sciences,\" to help students improve their practical problem solving skills and better prepare them for their future industrial careers. As our class is intended to guide students toward industrial careers, we would like to invite people from local companies to give lectures or lead discussion on their hands-on experience in mathematics. Through these activities, students will have an opportunity to interact with new people and build a network with industry experts. In addition, we would also like to send our students to conferences related to industrial mathematics so they would be exposed to even broader spectrum of possibilities for their future careers. We also wish to provide opportunities for students to visit local companies.\n\nMarilee Benore, CASL, Natural Sciences\n\nWe plan to host a luncheon for STEM women in tenure track and lecturers 3s and 4s faculty positions from across the campus, including those in engineering, science, math and the behavioral sciences. The purpose of the luncheon will be to connect, share ideas and collaborate. We have never had a gathering like this before- the hope is that the outcome will be new initiatives, both large and small, in and out of the classroom. It will lead to improved teaching, and perhaps retention, as we work together to find ways to support students, teaching and research.\n\nSuzanne Bergeron, CASL, College Wide Programs\n\nThis grant supports a speaker and event series on Food Justice for the 2015-2016 academic year. The series of events connect classes across the CASL curriculum on issues related to creating equitable food systems, achieving food security and addressing differential nutrition and health outcomes. It provides an opportunity to broaden the campus conversation on food justice between both faculty and students across the disciplines who would otherwise not come together on this topic. The series includes a mix of film screenings, panel discussions with community members and students involved in food justice initiatives, talks by community leaders, and lectures by researchers in the field. The series is proposed by a group of five faculty members who each have strong teaching and/or research interests in the area of food justice and are teaching course modules related to this topic in the academic year.\n\nPatricia Hartshorn, CASL, Natural Sciences\n\nThis collaborative project between STEM faculty and staff in CASL, CEHHS and the Mardigian Library seeks to provide engaging, interactive learning modules with assessment pieces that will seamlessly integrate with existing courses to support Dearborn Discovery Core development in the Natural Sciences. The Creative Teaching Fund, in supporting the purchase of innovative e-learning authoring software, is making cutting-edge interactive learning modules for science students possible. These learning modules will be readily accessible for students, and the Science Learning Center will provide assessment proctoring, support for hands-on activities, and a welcoming space with flexible scheduling for student completion of the modules.\n\nKaylan Kondapalli, CASL, Natural Sciences\n\nCell biology is no longer a descriptive science and instructors have to seriously consider providing students with strong foundation of current-knowledge and at the same time engage them in the scientific process. To this end, an inquiry-based learning approach to teach cell biology lab course has been initiated. As opposed to a cookbook style, my approach allows students to be intellectually engaged in the lab and helps students make connections between the concepts to see the big picture. Based on a pilot run, funding is requested to employ a student mentor to facilitate this process.\n\nMichael MacDonald, CASL, Language, Culture and Communication\n\nMany technical writers would agree that audience awareness, precision, conciseness and usability are key components of any technical document. Beginning writers, such as the engineering majors that enroll in COMP 270, need an introduction to these practices that engages them in problem-solving tasks and working in groups. Recently, complex, strategy-based board games have become quite popular. And, because of their complex rules (sometimes poorly written due to the nature of the gaming industry) serve the perfect medium for introducing students to best practices in technical communication.\n\nPhilip Potvin, CASL, Writing Program\n\n\"Who's that Knocking?: Multimedia Collaborations in Service-Learning\" This paper and presentation explores the frames, negotiations, challenges and rewards involved in telling stories beyond our personal experiences, i.e., collecting and disseminating the stories of others. How does one define an \"Arab American?\" What social, historical, geographical and political elements serve to create such definitions? Through service-learning collaborations with the Arab American National Museum, a complex and historically-layered entity, this paper examines how student-collected oral histories and multimedia can assist in navigating difference, engage local and global communities, serve as guides for deeper citizenship and despite apparent dissimilarities, demonstrate the collective.\n\nJacob Napieralski, CASL, Natural Sciences\n\nObservations are a critical component to the successful use of scientific inquiry in the field, particularly for geology students. UM-Dearborn geology students have studied Earth surface processes in Iceland and Puerto Rico using an innovative technique that scaffolds scientific inquiry and relies on peer learning and reflective writing. This method will now be enriched with the addition of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which will provide a \"birds-eye\" view of geologic phenomena, such as volcanoes, abandoned mines and dunes. The integration of UAV into field-based learning will be tested on our field geology course to Cyprus, May, 2015.\n\nNatalie Sampson, CEHHS, Health and Human Services\n\nCTF funding will make it possible for UM-Dearborn students to engage in an environmental justice tour through Detroit, Dearborn and downriver communities during the Fall 2015 semester. On this tour, speakers will describe the experiences of living and working in communities where compounding environmental health risks greatly threaten quality of life. The tour will also highlight community assets and potential interventions to address these disproportionate burdens. This learning opportunity convenes students from a variety of disciplines and highlights how environmental justice may be relevant to future educators and public health practitioners training at UM-Dearborn, among others.\n\nLiz Rohan, CASL, Writing Program\n\nThe fund, if awarded, will be used as a stipend to pay local young adult fiction author, Bethany Neal, to speak about her young adult novel, \"My Last Kiss,\" which was published last June, 2014 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Neal's book has been well reviewed by a range of book critics who appreciate the quality of Neal's writing, the book's dark but innovative premise and the strength of the main female character. During Neal's visit, she will read from her book and also discuss her process as a young adult fiction writer, including the process of getting published. Light refreshments will be provided.\n\nJacqueline Vansant, CASL, Language, Culture and Communication\n\nI propose to hire a minimum of ten students to work in a variety of capacities at the conference. These include among other things: animating students to attend, working registration, serving as guides and facilitators for the many out-of-town guests as well as local attendees, serving as a moderator on one of the panels, serving as drivers for the shuttle and helping me with logistics.\n\nFall 2016\n\nAaron Kinzel, CASL, Behavioral Sciences and Criminal Justice Studies\n\nThe Cell Block 7 Prison Museum in Jackson, Michigan is the only prison exhibit within the walls of an operating penitentiary, Cell Block 7 is not a replica of a prison it is a real prison where thousands of convicts have served hard time. Students will be accompanied by University of Michigan-Dearborn Lecturer, Aaron Thomas Kinzel with guest speakers who have all spent time in a correctional facility. Kinzel and these speakers will give students a real life experience of what it is like to stay in a prison that had some of the most hardened criminals in Michigan's history.\n\nRoger Loeb, CASL Behavioral Sciences\n\nStudents in the Psychology and Theater class (PSYC/ENG394) will attend a performance of \"It's a Wonderful Life: on the Air.\" This production is a radio-show version of the classic film to be performed by the Park Players of Detroit. One of the unique features of the course is the analysis of theatrical pieces. The class assesses the impact of the direction (blocking, staging) of the play, the choices made by the actors (body language, paraverbal behaviors, subtext), and the technical aspects (costumes, sets lighting and sound effects). While we read numerous plays and watch portions of filmed productions, there is no substitute for live theater.\n\nSummer 2016\n\nJulie Taylor, CEHHS, Education and Deborah Smith Pollard, CASL, Literature, Philosophy and the Arts\n\nWe are requesting funds for tickets and transportation so that UM-Dearborn students may see the University of Michigan’s Men’s Glee Club perform 7 Last Words of the Unarmed at the D.S.O. on February 12, 2017. The students will also see a performance by Sphinx musicians. In 2017, we will be commemorating the 1967 Detroit rebellion. The concert will spark conversations on race relations since 1967. Pre-service teachers and other students will consider the use of music to raise awareness of social issues. Dr. Eugene Rogers will address the group prior to the concert.\n\nWinter 2016\n\nAaron Kinzel, Criminal Justice Studies\n\nThe Cell Block 7 Prison Museum in Jackson, Michigan is a former operating prison where thousands of convicts have served hard time. Attendees will be accompanied by University of Michigan-Dearborn (UM-Dearborn) Lecturer, Aaron Thomas Kinzel and guest speakers who have all spent time in a correctional facility. Kinzel will give up to 50 UM-Dearborn students, faculty and staff a tour of what it is like to stay in a prison that had some of the most hardened criminals in Michigan's history. This trip is an important experiential learning process to bring lessons from a college textbook to life.\n\nJamie Wraight, CASL, Social Sciences\n\nThe Holocaust Memorial Center (HMC) in Farmington Hills is the nation’s first, freestanding museum of the Holocaust. Given its proximity to the UM-Dearborn, the HMC offers our students a unique opportunity not only to study the Holocaust, but to also understand the ways in which it is remembered and memorialized. By visiting the Holocaust Memorial Center, students enrolled in History 387, Aspects of the Holocaust, are able to make the important connections between the history of the event and public memory of it.\n\nBarbara Kriigel, Mardigian Library and Danielle DeFauw, CEHHS, Education\n\nThe Young Authors’ Festival (YAF) is a collaboration between the Department of Education and Mardigian Library. The YAF includes a writing contest for third- through fifth-grade students, and a half-day public event for families. The event begins with a children’s author’s presentation followed by breakout sessions for the families. Sessions are created and led by pre-service teachers; session content explores reading and writing strategies. To advertise the YAF, pre-service teachers conduct read aloud lessons with local schools. Pre-service teachers evaluate the writing contest entries. YAF participation facilitates authentic celebration of literacy for pre-service teachers, elementary students and their families.\n\nGail Luera, CEHHS, Education\n\nSince 1997, CASL has offered UM-Dearborn students the opportunity to enroll in courses with students who are incarcerated in Michigan Correctional Facilities. These courses are part of the Inside-Out Prison Exchange Program at Temple University and provide CASL students the opportunity to learn with a community they would not normally have access to. In order to be adequately prepared to teach these unique courses, faculty are required to go through a rigorous training program, sponsored by the Inside-Out Center. I am requesting funds to attend the training and expand the program at UM-Dearborn to courses in CEHHS.\n\nThe funds would go towards my training at the Inside-Out Training Institute which is held at a Michigan correctional facility June 6-12, 2016. The Institute will give me formal training in adult education using a pedagogy that has been demonstrated to be effective with college and prison populations since it was established in 1997. The 60 hour intensive training will cover everything necessary to develop a course (e.g. training in interactive pedagogies for adult learners, techniques for managing group dynamics) using the Inside-Out model. The final part of the training is a consultation to assist with the development of the CEHHS course. Once the training is complete, I will be ready and able to develop the CEHHS course."
