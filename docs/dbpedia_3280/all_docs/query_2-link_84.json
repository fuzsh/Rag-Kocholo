Eleven years were spent at Fitzenrider, Inc., Defiance, Ohio, as their office/service coordinator, and 33 years at Bard Manufacturing Company, Inc., Bryan, in the customer service, and sales and marketing departments.

During the four-and-a-half-day Habitat for Humanity trips to Indiana, William helped build homes from floor joists to shingles and prepared for the next week’s crew to continue the construction.
