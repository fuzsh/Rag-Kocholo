        "text": "LeBron James and Kyrie Irving had their usual stellar performances. Kevin Love came up big, too.\n\nBut when Channing Frye turned in the best playoff game of his career, the Atlanta Hawks didn’t have a chance.\n\nFrye scored 27 points and the Cavaliers kept up their three-point barrage Friday night, dominating down the stretch for a 121-108 victory that gave Cleveland a commanding 3-0 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\n“We’re a team that’s destined for greatness,” James said.\n\nCertainly, the Cavaliers will be hard to stop if Frye plays like he did in game 3.\n\nAcquired from Orlando in February to provide another outside threat and extend defenses, the 32-year-old played that role to perfection. He made 10 of 13 shots, including seven of nine from three-point range.\n\nIt was a devastating blow for an Atlanta team that already was outgunned by the Cavaliers and couldn’t cope with someone else stepping into a lead role.\n\n“We brought him here to shoot,” James said. “And shoot and shoot and shoot.”\n\nTwo nights after setting an NBA record with 25 baskets beyond the arc, the Cavaliers were nearly as good in a 21-of-39 performance that moved them within one victory of their second playoff sweep over the Hawks in two years.\n\nAtlanta turned in a much more respectable showing after getting blown out in game 2. But in the end, it was the same result for a team that has lost 10 straight to the Cavaliers going back to last year’s conference final.\n\nGame four is Sunday in Atlanta, but this was likely the last chance to make it a competitive series.\n\n“We’re fighting for our playoff lives right now,” Al Horford said. “At this point, we have to do some changes, because what we’ve done hasn’t worked.”\n\nThe Hawks led by as many as 11. Turns out, that wasn’t nearly enough to hold off the Cavaliers.\n\nJames and Irving each scored 24 points, while Love chipped in with 21.\n\nThen there was Frye, whose previous high in these playoffs was 12 points and best showing ever in the postseason was a 20-point effort in 2010, when he played for Phoenix.\n\nFrye relayed some advice from teammate James Jones: “Channing, you’ve got to stop passing. You’re not very good. You’ve just got to shoot it.”\n\nSo he did. Over and over again.\n\nThe Hawks led 103-99 with just over eight minutes remaining, but the Cavaliers were relentless and the home team – which had matched Cleveland shot for shot – suddenly went cold.\n\nCleveland went ahead for good when the Hawks inexplicably left James all alone outside the three-point stripe. He had time to step up to the line, set himself, and put up the jumper. Nothing but net, naturally, giving the Cavaliers their first lead since late in the second quarter.\n\nAt the other end, Paul Millsap had a pass knocked away by JR Smith, the ball winding up in James’ hands. He saw Frye breaking toward the other end, all alone, and fired ahead for a thunderous dunk that extended Cleveland’s lead with 5:56 left.\n\nCleveland scored 22 of the final 27 points, the Hawks making just two of their final 12 shots, with four turnovers mixed in.\n\nThe frustration boiled over in the closing seconds. As James attempted to drive, Jeff Teagueshoved him into the seats behind the basket with a shoulder shot, drawing a flagrant foul.\n\nLooking for a boost after the game 2 blowout, the Hawks changed up their lineup. Thabo Sefolosha started in place of struggling Kyle Korver, who reacted to the demotion with his best game of the series.\n\nKorver scored 18 points and made five of nine from three-point range. Horford led the Hawks with 24 points, also his best showing of the series. On top of that, the Hawks got some valuable minutes out of little-used reserve Kris Humphries, who had nine points and four rebounds.\n\nIt didn’t matter."
