        "text": "“[Frye] called me and said, ‘Live in the moment, first of all,’” Love told ESPN.com. “He’s like, ‘You’re 27 years old, you’re playing in the Eastern Conference finals.’ He goes, ‘We don’t care if you 0-for-25. Just be aggressive, make an impact on the game and go out there and play hard. Let’s get a win.’ But he also told me no one is immune to the NBA playoffs, either. That kind of stuff happens. There’s different ways to impact the game. There’s different ways to get the job done. That was a big deal for me to hear that come from him.\n\n“When I went to Orlando, I had high hopes, and it just didn’t work out,” Frye said late Friday night. “I was the oldest guy on the team. We were very young. Those are great guys down there, man. They’re just young and really trying to establish themselves. “I think Coach Skiles did a great job this year of giving them an identity, of showing them how hard it is to win. They’re going to be great in the future. They’re some good, good kids, and they’re very talented.”\n\nIn 2014, Frye was a free agent again. David Griffin, who helped recruit him to Phoenix over Cleveland five years earlier, was the new GM in Cleveland and trying to do it again. David Griffin sold Frye on playing with Kyrie Irving and told him about plans to sign free agent Gordon Hayward. They swapped numbers and approached a deal. Then James’ agent called about his return to Cleveland and the breaks were slammed. Frye ended up in Orlando. Now it was 2016, and Frye and the Cavs were moving into alignment again. Griffin was competing with the Los Angeles Clippers to get Frye from the Magic. Griffin could get him for a second-round pick — the Magic preferred the Cavs’ deal — but the catch was the Cavs had to swallow Frye’s contract."
