        "text": "As many sports enthusiasts may know, the Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics have a plan in place to make arguably the biggest move of the 2017 NBA offseason. They plan on trading away four time All-Star Kyrie Irving for standout point guard Isaiah Thomas, defensive specialist Jay Crowder, rookie center Ante Zizic and a prized first round draft pick originally from the Brooklyn Nets. Although the teams are currently waiting on Isaiah Thomas to pass his physical, the structure of the trade is already set.\n\nFrom a Cleveland point of view, I am a big fan of this trade. Kyrie is a star player who has a multi-dimensional game. In his time with the Cavs, he always wanted the ball in his hands as the clock dwindled down in a close game. He was clutch, plain and simple. But no player is perfect. There were a few parts of his game that I was not a fan of.\n\nFirst, his defensive efforts were subpar. Watching him play since the Cavs drafted him with the first pick in the 2011 draft, defense was always an issue. He did get slightly better over the years, but his defense lacked during his time with LeBron James.\n\nAnother aspect of his game I disliked was his distribution and assist count. Kyrie liked the ball in his hand and enjoyed taking the last shot. He averaged around five assists through the past three years with LeBron, but never took the lead as a distributor. Passing is key when you’re playing with “King James,” and that isn’t part of Kyrie’s game.\n\nDoes this trade answer all the Cavs’ questions? To be honest, not quite. Are the Cavs a better team with Irving traded? I believe so. I am a huge fan of Isaiah Thomas because of his work ethic and attitude towards the game. He puts everything out on the court and has elevated his game every year. Although he’s small, standing at 5’8”, he plays with heart, courage and grit. He is a near perfect player that will embody the “Cleveland Against the World” mantra. Jay Crowder brings a fantastic defensive presence to the Cavs that was invisible during the second half of last season. Crowder would be effective anywhere he is placed, either coming off the bench or starting at the shooting guard position.\n\nAlthough he’s a rookie, Ante Zizic brings in an attribute the Cavs have been missing: size. The first year center is nearly seven feet tall and carries a seven foot wingspan. With Tristan Thompson and even Channing Frye as the team’s rotational centers, Zizic carries a very good upside and could be a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe icing on the cake in this trade is the 2017 1st round draft pick, originally from the Brooklyn Nets. Although the season hasn’t started, Brooklyn is already slated to have a top pick.\n\nThe Cavs can either trade this pick throughout the season or hold onto it and potentially draft a future star, which could bring young talent to one of the oldest teams in the NBA.\n\nAs a basketball enthusiast, I truly believe this is a good trade for both sides. Boston gets a top point guard and bolsters an already strong team. Cleveland gets flexibility and depth at multiple positions.\n\nAs a Cleveland fan, I’m excited for the Cavs to take the court and get to work. The main goal is to beat the super team located in Northern California, and I truly believe this trade is a step in the right direction."
