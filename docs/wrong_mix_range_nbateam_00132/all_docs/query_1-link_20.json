        "text": "Suns forward Jared Dudley had a lighthearted suggestion for how Channing Frye could prepare for last night’s game against the Celtics at the Garden.\n\nAs Dudley passed his teammate after the morning shootaround, he recommended Frye make sure he was wearing a protective cup.\n\nThe comment was a reference to a dust-up Frye had with Kevin Garnett when the Suns beat the Celtics, 88-71, in Phoenix on Jan.Ã¢â‚¬â€°28.\n\nWhen Frye attempted a 3-pointer late in the game, Garnett came out to contest the shot. As he did earlier in the game, Garnett slid under Frye, with the Phoenix big man landing on Garnett’s foot. Additionally, Garnett poked his hand in Frye’s midsection, catching him lightly in the groin. Frye briefly went down in pain before popping up and going nose-to-nose with Garnett. The incident earned Frye a technical and two for Garnett, resulting in an ejection.\n\nWhen Dudley made his comment, Frye was explaining his problem with Garnett’s actions.\n\n“Just the whole thing. There’s a rule. There’s certain things you just don’t do, and he just overstepped that boundary twice,” Frye said. “It is what it is. There’s nothing else I can say about it. What am I going to do, slap him on the hand or tell him don’t do that?\n\n“That’s just how he plays. Everybody knows that. I think you can look at how many people have complained about him. It’s not like it’s just me. I don’t take it personal. He just wants his team to win and feels like he has to do that to make them win.”\n\nFrye has had plenty of company criticizing Garnett’s on-court behavior this season. The critics have ranged from Suns coach Alvin Gentry to Pistons forward Charlie Villanueva to film director and Knicks fan Spike Lee.\n\nGarnett and his defenders, most notably C’s coach Doc Rivers, contend the future Hall of Famer hasn’t changed. So why has there been so much discussion of Garnett’s actions this season?\n\n“People just aren’t afraid of him,” Frye said. “It’s just not as concealed. I think an elbow here, maybe tripping somebody or grabbing hold of them, that happens and it’s just people playing hard. But other stuff is a little different, being a little disrespectful.\n\n“It is what it is. He plays like that, and that’s what he does. Everybody knows it.”\n\nGentry injected himself into the controversy when he told a Phoenix radio station he “lost a little respect for (Garnett).”\n\nThat led Rivers to fire back, claiming Gentry, and any other critic, would welcome Garnett on their teams. The Suns coach didn’t argue that point.\n\n“Hell yeah,” Gentry said. “That’s not even close. Of course. (Spurs guard Manu) Ginobili annoyed the hell out of us also, but we’d love to have him on our team. That’s not anything. (Garnett) plays hard and he competes, and that’s the way it should be. But that’s the line right there.”"
