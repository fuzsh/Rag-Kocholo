        "text": "Channing Frye scored a career playoff-high 27 points and the Cleveland Cavaliers kept up their 3-point barrage Friday night, pulling away in the closing minutes for a 121-108 victory over the Hawks in Atlanta and taking a commanding 3-0 lead in this Eastern Conference semifinal series.\n\nTwo nights after setting an NBA record with 25 baskets beyond the arc, the Cavaliers were nearly as good in a 21-of-39 performance from long range that moved them within one victory of their second playoff sweep over the Hawks in two years.\n\nAtlanta turned in a much more respectable showing after getting blown out in Game 2. But in the end, it was the same result for a team that has lost 10 straight to the Cavaliers going back to last year’s conference final.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Hawks led by as many as 11 but were dominated in the closing minutes.\n\nSpurs 100, Thunder 96 — Kawhi Leonard had 31 points and 11 rebounds, and the San Antonio Spurs beat the Thunder in Oklahoma City to take a 2-1 lead in their Western Conference semifinal series.\n\nLaMarcus Aldridge had 24 points and eight rebounds, and Tony Parker added 19 points and eight rebounds for the Spurs, who regained the home-court advantage they had surrendered with a loss in Game 2.\n\nRussell Westbrook led the Thunder with 31 points, but he made just 10 of 31 shots."
