        "text": "The Orlando Magic were considered underdogs before their first playoff series since the 2019-20 season. They have a young core of players who don’t have extensive playoff experience, and their star player is only in his second year in the NBA.\n\nWhile the first two games did show the inexperience the Magic against the Cavaliers, things definitely changed for the team when they played Game 3 at the Kia Center. Paolo Banchero had an outstanding game where he put up numbers that put him beside incredible players.\n\nHis performance was so good that one member of the Cavaliers’ 2016 championship squad gave high praise for the young forward.\n\nChanning Frye praises Paolo Banchero for his superb performance for the Orlando Magic vs Cavs\n\nChanning Frye was one of the role players who helped the Cavaliers win the first NBA title in the franchise’s history, so the team has a special place in his heart.\n\nHowever, he cannot help but praise the first pick of the 2022 NBA Draft for his outstanding showing during the Magic’s 83-121 shellacking against his former team.\n\n“I think Orlando… the pre-game jitters, the young jitters went away,” Frye said about the Magic’s mentality in Game 3. “They said, ‘We’re at home, the crowd is rocking.’ This guy Paolo said, ‘Get on my back, I’ll carry you.'”\n\n“Paolo is easily one of the best up-and-coming stars [in] this league, and people are starting to [pay] attention.”\n\nPaolo Banchero finished the game with 31 points, leading all players on the Magic and Cavaliers. He complemented his performance with 14 rebounds, five assists, and a steal on 50% shooting and 44.4% from long-range.\n\nHis inspired performance allowed his teammates to shine as well. Jalen Suggs dumped 24 points, Franz Wagner added 16, and Markelle Fultz scored 11 from the bench.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cavaliers weren’t able to hold a candle to a motivated Orlando Magic squad. Donovan Mitchell couldn’t find the ring as he shot 6-for-16 to finish with 13 points. Darius Garland was also shooting blanks, finishing the game with only five points to his name.\n\nWith the Magic showing such a performance in their home floor, fans can expect an exciting series between these two ball clubs.\n\nFor More Content"
