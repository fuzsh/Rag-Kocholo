        "text": "Here’s what you need to know about point guard Isaiah Thomas, who was acquired by the Lakers on Thursday along with center Channing Frye and a protected first-round pick from Cleveland in exchange for guard Jordan Clarkson and forward Larry Nance Jr. (See full coverage of Lakers trade)\n\nGrowing up\n\n* Thomas, 29, was born Feb. 7, 1989, in Tacoma, Wash., and was named after former Detroit Pistons star guard Isiah Thomas.\n\n* He attended Curtis Senior High in University Place, Wash., before transferring to South Kent High in Connecticut to focus on academics.\n\nCollege\n\n* The 5-foot-9 Thomas played three years at the University of Washington, receiving the blessing of similarly undersized former Huskies guard Nate Robinson to wear his No. 2 jersey.\n\n* Thomas was voted Pac-10 Freshman of the Year for 2008-09 with 15.5 ppg.\n\n* He was named All-Pac-10 first team as a sophomore with 16.9 ppg in leading Washington to the Pac-10 Tournament championship, where he was named tournament MVP.\n\n* He repeated the All-Pac-10 first-team honor as a junior with 16.8 ppg and 6.1 apg, leading the Huskies to their second consecutive Pac-12 Tournament title with a buzzer-beating shot over Arizona in overtime to again be named tournament MVP. He received AP All-American honorable mention honors.\n\nNBA Draft\n\n* Thomas chose to forgo his senior season at Washington and enter the NBA Draft.\n\n* He lasted until the final pick as the Sacramento Kings took him 60th at the end of the second round.\n\n* Only five other players drafted before him — No. 1 pick Kyrie Irving, No. 9 pick Kemba Walker, No. 11 pick Klay Thompson, No. 15 pick Kawhi Leonard and No. 30 pick Jimmy Butler — played in an All-Star Game, which Thomas eventually did in 2016 and 2017.\n\nSacramento (2011-14)\n\n* Thomas averaged 11.5 ppg and 4.1 apg and was named to the NBA All-Rookie second team. Twice, he was selected NBA Rookie of the Month\n\n* Thomas increased his scoring average to 13.9 ppg in his second season.\n\n* In his third season with the Kings, Thomas posted career highs with averages of 20.3 points, 6.3 assists and 1.3 steals. He became the shortest player to ever record a triple-double when he went off for 24 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds in a 117-110 OT win over Washington on March 18, 2014,\n\nPhoenix (2014-15)\n\n* Thomas was traded to the Suns on July 12, 2014, for the rights to Alex Oriakhi, who has never played a minute in the NBA. Thomas averaged 15.2 points and connected on a career-best 39.2 percent from 3-point range. He started just one out of 46 games in Phoenix.\n\nBoston (2015-17)\n\n* Thomas was traded to the Celtics on Feb. 19, 2015, for Marcus Thornton and a 2016 first-round pick. Thornton ended up playing just nine games for the Suns.\n\n* Thomas, with averages of 19.0 points and 5.4 assists over 21 games, led the Celtics to the Eastern Conference playoffs, where they were swept in the first round by Cleveland. He finished second for the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award.\n\n* Thomas finished his second season in Boston with 22.2 ppg and 6.2 apg. He was a reserve for the Eastern Conference in the 2016 All-Star Game, becoming the lowest draft pick to be named an All-Star since the draft was limited to two rounds in 1989. He led the Celtics to the playoffs, where they played Atlanta in the first round. After losing the first two games, Boston won Game 3 behind Thomas’ 42 points, making him only the ninth Celtic to score 40 points in the postseason, before losing the series in six games.\n\n* Thomas had a storybook season in his third year in Boston. He posted career bests of 28.9 points, a 46.3 field-goal percentage and a 90.9 free-throw percentage, in addition to 5.9 assists per game. He was named an Eastern Conference reserve for his second consecutive All-Star Game. Season highlights included scoring at least 20 points in 20 of the Celtics’ first 21 games and posting career highs of 7 3-pointers (Dec. 20, 2016, vs. Memphis); 52 points (Dec. 30, 2016, vs. Miami); and 15 assists (Jan. 3, 2017, vs. Utah). He became just the sixth Celtic to score 2,000 points in a season and earned All-NBA Second Team honors.\n\n* On the day before the first round of the 2017 playoffs, Thomas learned his sister Chyna had died in a car accident in Washington. Thomas played all six games in leading the Celtics to a 4-2 series win over Chicago before flying home for her funeral. In the conference semifinals, Thomas led Boston to a 4-3 series win over Washington, buoyed by his 53-point effort in Game 2 — one point shy of John Havlicek’s Celtics postseason scoring record. In the conference finals against Cleveland, Thomas was forced out after two games due to a hip injury. The Cavaliers won the series in five games.\n\nCleveland (2017-18)\n\n* Thomas was traded to the Cavaliers on Aug. 22, along with Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic and an unprotected first-round pick, for Kyrie Irving. A physical showed Thomas had been playing for years with lingering hip injuries, which resulted in Boston sending the Cavs an extra 2020 second-round pick as compensation.\n\n* Thomas appeared in just 15 games with Cleveland and struggled to fit in with his fourth team in three years. He averaged just 14.7 ppg and shot just 36.1 percent from the field and 25.3 percent on 3-pointers."
