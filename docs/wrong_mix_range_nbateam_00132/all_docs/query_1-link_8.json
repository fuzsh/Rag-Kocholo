        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Channing Frye was with his family in Puerto Rico during All-Star break when his future came into focus.\n\nAfter spending the last 14 years in the NBA, pouring his all into the game he loves, it was time to make room for something else.\n\n“The straw that broke the camel's back, I was on vacation,” Frye said. “I went to Puerto Rico with my kids and I saw our best friends who live down there and their kids are 12, 11, 10. My son is eight now. I'm like, ‘I want to go his practice and not have to worry about my practice.’ I want to make time for them.\n\n“What some of these young fellas don't understand is your whole life is on a selfish bubble, what's best for you, what you want to do. For me it took a while, but my dad instinct, and my husband and family guy kicked in. What can I do for my family? Money is awesome, but at this point I've had enough people either die or go away through relationships that couldn't get kept up. That's what's most important, making something outside of basketball.”\n\nFrye has been thinking about the possibility of retirement for the last few years. Like others, he has struggled with when to walk away. He joked about his 30-minute drive to practice and the 30-minute journey back home giving him plenty of alone time to talk to himself and ponder the future. He chatted with Dwyane Wade, who is in the midst of his final season. Dallas’ Dirk Nowitzki also inquired.\n\nWhen Frye signed a one-year deal with the Cavaliers this past summer, reality started to set in. He even wondered if he had anything left to give.\n\nHe picked Cleveland because it’s where he felt he could make the biggest impact. He also knew this could be his final hurrah. And Frye, who became an integral piece of Cleveland’s 2016 title run, couldn’t think of a better place to cap his career.\n\n“I wanted to retire a Cav,” Frye said. “I didn’t know what was going to happen this summer so I wanted to make sure I’m controlling my own destiny and going out the way I wanted to go out.”\n\nThis probably isn’t exactly what he envisioned. Frye’s playing time has been sporadic. The Cavs have dropped near the bottom of the NBA standings. Head coach Tyronn Lue was fired six games into the season. Some of Frye’s old teammates were shipped away ahead of the trade deadline.\n\nThe trying season and a diminished role played a part in the announcement he made on social media Friday.\n\n“Everybody knew it was coming. I wasn't playing. I was sitting next to the coaches all the time. For me it was the natural progression of where it should go,” Frye said. “I love basketball and I love being around, but also love that basketball always gave me a challenge. Right now my job and my job for however many years if I wanted to play, I would be more like a coach figure. I’m a competitor and I’m like, ‘OK, I want to help.’ But I also know there’s limitations to where this league is going or where this team is going. It’s not like, ‘Oh man, I deserve to play.’ It’s not like that at all.\n\n“At the end of the day, you have to look at yourself and be like, ‘Is this what’s truly the right type of gas for the car you’re driving.’ For me, right now, this season, it’s on E. I have enough to finish out the season and I’m excited to do it with these guys. Over the course of this year, there have been some things that happened at the beginning that kind of crushed me a little bit and then just seeing the progression of these guys playing, how good they’ve gotten and how good they’re going to be in the next three or four years has been amazing. But that’s where my happiness is coming from, seeing other people doing stuff. For me, I have to look at what’s going to make me happy, my family happy and I think at the end of the year, I can wipe my hands and say I’m good. I’ve done enough and I think it’s the correct time to step away.”\n\nFrye doesn’t know exactly what’s to come after these final 19 games. But, as he has done during his hoops career, Frye will commit fully to whatever he decides.\n\n“I think some people are scared about retirement and are like what are you going to do after? Whatever the hell I want. It’s exciting to me,” Frye said. “Would I do broadcasting? Would I do my podcast? Yep. Would I try to be an astronaut? If I want to. I might want to be a mechanic for a couple of months. And that’s the thing, I want to do all these things but for me to be the best at doing anything other than basketball, I gotta ravel myself back in and find out what gets me going in the morning, what’s going to be the right kind of gas for my engine.”\n\nFrye mentioned coaching as a possibility. But says he’d rather be a consultant so he doesn’t have to immediately get back into the day-to-day grind. The high school and college level is actually more appealing, allowing him to get a feel for the stressful lifestyle before jumping in fully.\n\nBefore he does anything, he’s going to relax, just as he did Friday night, watching his son play hockey inside Quicken Loans Arena and then staying for the Lake Erie Monsters game.\n\n“I want to be normal for a second,” Frye said “I’ve had somebody for the last, almost 22 years tell me, ‘You gotta wake up, you gotta work out, you gotta get better at this, you gotta do this.’ And for a second I just want to get used to being normal.”\n\nCoaches and teammates rave about his influence. He often shouts instructions during the game and gives pointers during film sessions.\n\nFrom one locker over prior to Saturday’s game, Nik Stauskas, who has only been in Cleveland for a few weeks, leaned in on the conversation and told Frye he didn’t want him to go.\n\nA valuable piece of Cleveland’s culture, Frye has instilled a sense of professionalism and direction in a team that’s hoping for a brighter future.\n\nHe’s also, unapologetically, himself. That’s the trait that led to him becoming a fan favorite. His personality had ex-teammate Richard Jefferson referring to Frye as the key to the Cavaliers’ morphing in 2016, from a collection of talent to a real team, one with the cohesiveness to overcome a 3-1 deficit in the 2016 Finals against the historic Golden State Warriors.\n\nForget the 1,041 career 3-pointers. The five seasons in double figures. Or the first-round pedigree. Frye wants to be remembered for his honesty.\n\n\"Whether it was goofy or rude or brash, whatever it is, just know that I was me all the time, I tried to be,” Frye said. “Throughout my career I haven’t cared about stats. I don’t care about none of that. Every team I’ve been on, I just wanted to win and I wanted to see guys do well. If you were better than me that was perfect. That made me work harder every day. If you were better than me we have a better chance of winning.\n\n“I met some amazing guys. Hopefully they say Channing was an amazing guy and send me a text once in a while.\""
