        "text": "Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWith Channing Frye seemingly on his way to the fringes of the Orlando Magic's rotation, teams have begun inquiring about the forward's availability.\n\nContinue for updates.\n\nClippers Delaying Possible Trade for Frye\n\nThursday, Feb. 18\n\nAdrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical reported the Los Angeles Clippers are \"still unwilling to commit to [a Frye] deal.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Wojnarowski reported the Clippers won't give Orlando a final answer on a trade that would send Frye to the Clippers in exchange for Lance Stephenson, C.J. Wilcox and a second-round pick until Thursday.\n\nL.A. was \"nearing agreement\" on a deal for Frye on Tuesday, per Wojnarowski.\n\nCavaliers Interested in Frye\n\nThursday, Feb. 18\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers have proposed a trade involving Anderson Varejao that would send Frye to the Cavaliers, according to ESPN's Marc Stein on Wednesday, who added that Cleveland is trying to \"pre-empt\" a possible trade between Orlando and the Los Angeles Clippers for Frye.\n\nOn Thursday, Fox Sports' Sam Amico reported that the Cavaliers are \"still in it with Frye.\" However, Amico noted he doesn't expect a deal to be reached.\n\nThe Cavs could \"absorb Frye's $8.2 million salary into a $10.5 million trade exception,\" according to Wojnarowski.\n\nFrye was deemed a \"significant target\" for the Cavaliers on Tuesday by Wojnarowski.\n\nFrye Expected to Be Traded Before Deadline\n\nTuesday, Feb. 16\n\nStein reported Orlando is trying to move Frye ahead of Thursday's trade deadline, noting that he's more available after the Magic reportedly completed a trade sending Tobias Harris to Detroit for Brandon Jennings and Ersan Ilyasova, per ESPN's Chris Broussard.\n\n“He’s one of the names I think you hear a lot and you will hear a lot more about before the deadline,” an NBA executive told Sporting News' Sean Deveney on Feb. 1. “His contract is not that bad and he could help a contender, and it looks like they’re moving on from him. There’s a lot of interest there.”\n\nFrye's Decreased Production Makes Him Expendable\n\nFrye, 32, is averaging a dismal 5.2 points and 3.2 rebounds per game—numbers that rank among the worst in his career.\n\nHe's also seen a marked decrease in playing time, dropping from 24.9 minutes per game in 2014-15 down to 17.1 this season. The veteran forward did not leave the bench in Sunday's 119-114 win over the Boston Celtics, with Aaron Gordon taking the power forward reins for 39 minutes.\n\nGordon, in his second season out of Arizona, appears to have won over full-time starter duties. He has pushed Frye to the bench for Orlando's last five games, including a 19-point, 14-rebound, five-assist outing against Boston. Orlando coach Scott Skiles made the move amid a miserable January run that saw the Magic win twice the entire month.\n\nThat month-long stretch of poor play removed the Magic from the East's playoff picture and likely set up a second-half youth movement. Moving Gordon into the starting lineup will allow Skiles to see how the team's projected core plays together. He's already experimented with bringing Victor Oladipo off the bench, something he may have to revisit if spacing gets cramped with Frye out of the rotation.\n\nThe Magic shouldn't ask for much in any Frye trade. His contract is manageable but still concerning given his play, with two seasons and around $15.2 million remaining after this year. Even though Frye's ability to stretch the floor won't subside with age, he hasn't been the same player since leaving Phoenix.\n\nHis two years in Orlando have thus far resulted in the worst per-minute production of his career, per Basketball-Reference."
