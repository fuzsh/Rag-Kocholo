        "text": "INDEPENDENCE, Ohio — Channing Frye is like you. He was asked to come back to the Cavaliers after LeBron James left.\n\nHe sees the correlation.\n\n“I think Cleveland is not about one person,” Frye told The Athletic on Monday, the first media day for the Cavs without LeBron since 2013. “I think Cleveland is a very big ‘team’ city.”\n\nFrye is 35. He’s played 12 seasons, owns a championship ring and has millions of dollars to his name. He could have signed with the Toronto Raptors — a team of which much is expected. Unlike the Cavs.\n\nBut Frye agreed to a one-year, $2.4 million contract as a free agent in July to return to the franchise that traded him in February, even though its best player left for Los Angeles and took with him any legitimate hope for a championship in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe story of the 2018-19 Cavs won’t be about Frye, of course. Not really. He’ll play a small role on the court and a bigger one as a veteran in the locker room. But he is the embodiment of what is at the heart of it all for the players, coaches, front office executives, and the organization’s millions of fans.\n\nHe moved on from LeBron by buying in and coming back. He didn’t dwell on what they lost.\n\n“At the end of the day, nobody thinks we’re going to be shit,” Frye said. “It’s just us in this locker room that think we’re going to be good. And we can shock the world. … At the end of the day, we’ve got nothing to lose. Also, when you put it in this perspective, you’re free to show the world what you’ve got. Because we’ve got nobody but us.”\n\nDead team walking\n\nWith LeBron out of the equation, the NBA has largely left the Cavs for dead. The league scheduled just two games on national TV for the Cavs this season (the five on NBA TV don’t count in my book). Vegas projects 30.5 wins.\n\n“Rivalry” is not the word associated with Cleveland’s season opener at Toronto (against a Raptors team the Cavs knocked out of the playoffs three years running); its first trip to Boston on Nov. 30 (twice the Cavs beat the Celtics in the Eastern finals); or for the Warriors’ lone trip here Dec. 5.\n\nHell, in the hullabaloo this summer over whether Tristan Thompson sucker punched Draymond Green after the ESPYs, and Cleveland fans wanted to throw Thompson a parade, Green said on social media: “Keep the parade that city won’t have any for a while … I forgot Bron left.”\n\nIt’s a steep drop for an organization that is the four-time-defending Eastern Conference champs, predicated on a single event: LeBron’s signing of a four-year, $153.3 million contract with the Lakers in July.\n\nThis is the third time James left an organization behind in free agency. When he did it to Cleveland in 2010, the Cavs suffered through the fourth-worst season in franchise history. The year after he returned to Cleveland, the Miami Heat failed to reach the postseason.\n\nThe Cavs resisted calls to tear down their roster in LeBron’s wake and held on to all of their veterans (who weren’t free agents). They signed Kevin Love to a four-year, $120 million extension.\n\nAll along, they’ve said they’d try to make the playoffs. Coach Tyronn Lue took it a little further Monday when he was asked who he thought was the class of the East now and he said: “We haven’t lost yet, have we?”\n\nA LeBron-sized crater\n\nBeyond the consecutive Finals (four) and titles (one, in 2016) LeBron generated while he was here, the Cavs enjoyed the second-most wins in the regular season over any four-year stretch in their 48-year history. Cleveland won 211 games in James’ second stint, bested only by the 222 it won from 2006-10 before he left the first time.\n\nAlso over the last four years, LeBron took 20.4 percent of the Cavs’ shots, scored 22.4 percent of their points, accounted for an astounding 32.5 percent of their assists and 16.4 percent of their rebounds.\n\nThe gaping hole created by James’ departure looks even bigger when considered within the context of what he did last season. LeBron enjoyed arguably his best statistical year (27.5 ppg, career highs 9.1 apg and 8.6 rpg), and during the team’s dramatic run to the Finals scored one third of the Cavs’ points and doled out an absurd 47 percent of their assists.\n\nThat team wheezed its way to 50 wins and a fourth-place finish in the East, and needed to win Game 7s over Indiana and Boston to make it back to the Finals. The Warriors erased the Cavs in four games for their third title in four years.\n\nSo, no, they haven’t yet lost a game this season. They only lost the sun in their orbit from the last four.\n\n“We’re going to evolve,” Kyle Korver said. “We’re going to play a different style of basketball, and if we don’t we’re probably not going to be very good. I think it’s a great opportunity for all of us, from the top to the bottom of this organization, to create a new path.”\n\nNew look, new feel\n\nKorver is 38 and has played 15 seasons. He nearly retired after last year, he said, so emotionally drained he was by personal tragedy (the unexpected death of his younger brother) compounded by a year in Cleveland that just wasn’t much fun.\n\nBut Korver is refreshed and back in a Cavs uniform. He and Love talked Frye into returning to the fold. Tristan Thompson, JR Smith, Love and Frye are the only remaining players from the Cavs’ 2016 championship season.\n\nThe Cavs drafted Collin Sexton out of Alabama in June as their first No. 1 pick they’ve kept since 2013.\n\nGeorge Hill, Rodney Hood, Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr. — the four players general manager Koby Altman traded for at least season’s February deadline — are all back.\n\nCedi Osman, a rookie from the Euroleague last year, will get a big chance to play. David Nwaba and Sam Dekker are new to the fold.\n\nMost, but not all, of these Cavs traveled to Miami at Love’s request earlier this month to work out and get to know each other.\n\n“We didn’t talk about LeBron at all for the most part,” Frye said.\n\n“When you have the best player in the world, who’s dominated this game for the last 12 or 13 years in LeBron, it’s always tough to lose a player like that,” Lue said. “With LeBron gone, the media circus calms down, but as far as what we want to do with this team, that doesn’t change. The culture is still the same. We still want to win.”\n\nJust like you\n\nWhen Love signed his extension, the Cavs announced it in front of a team of hard-hat wearing construction workers at The Q. The symbolism was obvious — the team wants you, blue-collar Cleveland — to know that Kevin wants to be here.\n\nLue thought about walking away after last season, following months of health issues that cost him two weeks’ worth of games. But he wanted to coach this team.\n\nFrye wants to be here. So does Korver. And Sexton.\n\nYour 2018-19 Cavs, sans LeBron.\n\n“I think we have some kids you’re gonna like, who are real Cleveland people,” Frye said. “I’ve been talking to guys here, they really like the city. I think they’re shocked how much they really do like the city.\n\n“We’re not giving up on ourselves so they shouldn’t give up on us,” Frye continued. “I don’t know a whole lot of fair-weather Cleveland fans.\n\n“If you like the Browns, shit, you better love us.”\n\n(Photo of Channing Frye: Jason Miller/Getty Images)"
