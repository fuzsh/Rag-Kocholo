        "text": "LeBron James, Tobias Harris\n\nTobias Harris (34), shown here driving past Cleveland's LeBron James (23) in his first start as a Detroit Piston in February, will meet up with cousin Channing Frye in the playoffs.\n\n(AP Photo | Tony Dejak)\n\nAUBURN HILLS -- Channing Frye of the Cleveland Cavaliers and Tobias Harris of the Detroit Pistons have known each other most of their lives. They text each other periodically but with a playoff showdown looming between them, \"It's more like you need to just stay in your own lane,\" Frye said.\n\nFrye also called the Pistons \"a team full of 'tweeners,\" since acquiring Harris in trade as the team shifts more to hybrid perimeter positions.\n\nFrye meant no disrespect, of course: He and Harris are cousins.\n\nLisa Harris and Karen Frye, the players' mothers, are sisters.\n\nThe players weren't close growing up because Channing Frye is nine years older and they grew up on opposite sides of the country. They grew much closer during their time as teammates last year and this year.\n\n\"I think our family does a pretty good job of keeping up with where each other's at, the accolades, accomplishments,\" Frye said. \"So for me it was just watching him grow and develop into what he is now. Even playing with him for that one year in Orlando, or year-and-a-half, I've seen him grow up a lot and I think he's in a great situation.\"\n\nHarris, a 6-foot-9 power forward, grew up in a basketball family. His father Torell played at Duquesne and was a player agent who represented, among others, George Gervin.\n\nFrye, a 6-11 forward-center, grew up with a mother who was a television producer and director.\n\nAs for the part about staying in your own lane, the Pistons and Cavaliers will meet in a best-of-seven Eastern Conference playoff series beginning with Game 1 Sunday at Cleveland (3 p.m., ABC). So the cousins won't have the time or inclination for social activities.\n\n\"He's doing what's best for his team and I'm doing what's best for mine,\" Frye said. \"If we meet up in between, we do. But we know we're always family, we're always supporting each other outside of when we play each other.\"\n\nFor Harris, watching Frye's development, first at the University of Arizona then as a first-round 2005 draft pick of Harris' hometown New York Knicks, was yet another element of a strong athletic and educational familial foundation.\n\n\"We have a difference in age but we're still family,\" Harris said. \"So obviously I grew up watching him play a lot. I got to see a lot of his college games. I followed him real heavy and I saw him when he made the NBA.\n\n\"Him making it, it was like it just showed me that anything could happen with hard work, and keep working hard. He definitely was a great older cousin and role model to me growing up.\"\n\nThe two were teammates in Orlando two months ago.\n\nIn a span of two days, both were dealt to playoff teams in trade-deadline deals, Harris to Detroit on Feb. 16, and Frye to Cleveland two days later.\n\n\"We had a great chemistry out there on the floor when we played,\" Harris said. \"We were always looking out for each other, on and off the court. You know, we're family, so family's going to do that, look out for each other. Just like when I got traded, he was one of the first persons that called me and wished me the best. And I wished him the best too, the minute he got traded, and I knew this was a good situation for him.\"\n\nFrye said that with Harris and Marcus Morris playing the two forward spots, the Pistons have the \"opportunity to be very versatile.\"\n\nHarris is a multi-dimensional offensive player who gives the Pistons a player who can create off the bounce, an element they lacked in the starting lineup except for point guard Reggie Jackson. Morris also is a versatile offensive player who usually draws the tougher forward matchup on defense. The Pistons are 17-8 with Harris starting.\n\nFrye comes off the bench and can play two positions as the Cavs, who already plan to start Tristan Thompson at center, plot to use their range-shooting big men to pull NBA rebounding king Andre Drummond away from the rim and exploit physical mismatches at power forward.\n\nIn both respects -- Detroit's pick-and-roll switchers at forward, and Cleveland's element of big men with dual 3-point-shooting and post-up skills -- the Pistons' \"team full of 'tweeners\" element comes into play.\n\n\"You know, he plays two different positions, the same as Marcus. I think Tobias is more of an up-the-floor runner than Marcus. I think Marcus is maybe a better one-on-one player,\" Frye said. \"So they do different things, different sides of the court, so it gives them options. I think Stan is a great coach and so he's been using them to his ability and putting Tobias in positions to be successful.\"\n\nAll those years when Harris knew his elder cousin more fleetingly, via television and shared basketball interests, with himself growing up in New York and Frye in Phoenix, narrowed when Frye signed with Orlando as a free agent in 2014.\n\n\"We always was family, so you do get to know each other,\" Harris said. \"Age separates a little bit. But obviously, being with him in Orlando a lot of the time, you get to know somebody definitely better being with them on a team.\"\n\nTwo months later, they will go against each other in a best-of-seven playoff series.\n\n\"I don't really think anything of it,\" Frye said. \"It is what it is. It's basketball. We're going to play each other regardless. But at the end of the day, I think he knows how I am, and I know how he is, so other than maybe tonight, I may not speak to him for the rest of the thing. It's about business and I've talked to him enough. So we'll be fine after. But right now it's about business.\""
