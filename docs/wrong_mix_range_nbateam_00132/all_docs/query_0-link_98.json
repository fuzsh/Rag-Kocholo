        "text": "Channing Frye ready for NBA after enlarged heart issue\n\nHealed, cleared, delivered: Channing Frye is yours, Phoenix Suns.\n\nAfter a year away from basketball due to an enlarged heart, the Suns' deep-shooting big man said he is healthy and was cleared for all activity by doctors at The Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. He began working out and returned with his family to Phoenix. All he awaits now is word from the Suns that their doctors concur.\n\n\"They told me, 'No human being is 100% healthy. The highest we give is a 98%. You are a 98%,' \" Frye said. \"They said, 'We see this all the time.' I don't have any fear. I'm not scared to push myself and run and play and get my heart rate up. I'm just waiting on the paperwork. I'm healthy. It's out of my hands. It's up to the Suns and what they feel comfortable doing.\"\n\nThe Suns are not commenting on Frye's disclosure, but general manager Ryan McDonough said last week, \"All the results we've gotten on Channing are positive. We're just waiting for a conclusion.\"\n\nFrye said a virus caused his heart's enlargement, which shut him down before the Suns went to training camp last year. He said the condensed lockout season of 2012, stress, lack of sleep, coffee and energy drinks were contributors.\n\nEven if Frye is cleared, he likely will not be in playing shape when the Suns open their season Oct. 30. He is just beginning to do the off-season work that he normally would have done in May and June because he was restricted to golf, yoga and set-shooting for most of the past year.\n\n\"It's a long process, and I'm continuing to be patient,\" Frye said. \"This is not something to rush. I want the Suns to make the right decision. I'm 100%, unequivocally healthy. I'm excited to get back with the team when this is resolved.\"\n\nFrye already has worked off 18 pounds since being cleared for increased activity.\n\nHe knows he is nowhere near the level he played for three seasons in Phoenix, particularly the 2009-10 and 2010-11 seasons, when he made a 343 three-pointers combined, second-most in NBA.\n\n\"Why not take the time to really get myself right?\" Frye said. \"I could do it (play at the start of the season), but I'd be exhausted from crushing myself to get ready. I need a lot of practice hours. There should be no rush because I don't want to rush back and get injured. Once you step on that court, everyone expects you to be 100%.\"\n\nFrye has two contract years remaining: $6.4 million this season and a $6.8 million player option for 2014-15. Insurance covered his $6 million salary for last season.\n\nFrye's case may remind NBA observers of Boston Celtics forward Jeff Green. Green, then 25, missed all of 2011-12 because of an aortic aneurysm but came back last season as the Celtics' sixth man. He averaged 12.8 points and 3.9 rebounds a game and figures to take a more prominent role this year.\n\nFrye now is the Suns' oldest player after turning 30 in May and could be looked to as a leader, along with Goran Dragic and P.J. Tucker.\n\n\"I don't want to be considered the leader just because I'm the oldest,\" Frye said. \"I want to earn that. Grant (Hill) and Steve (Nash) earned that every day. If the fellas respect me enough and the work I put in and my consistency, then great.\"\n\n\"I've been through everything in my career. We weren't as good as we should have been last year because we didn't see the big picture. I'm excited to see progress. We're a young team and we're going to make dumb mistakes but we can cut those mistakes and then, by the end of the year, we'll have established who we are.\"\n\nFrye said he would not be in the position to return with the optimism for better health and an improved mindframe without the impact of three Valley people. He saw naturopathic physician Suneil Jain (who also had Hill, Nash, Jared Dudley and Jason Richardson as patients), natural cardiologist Jack Wolfson and yoga instructor Angie Fie.\n\n\"Angie basically almost saved my life to get me comfortable with my situation,\" Frye said. \"Without those three people, I wouldn't have had a chance to come back and I've learned how to live longer.\""
