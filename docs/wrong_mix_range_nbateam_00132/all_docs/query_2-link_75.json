Frye, who was obtained in a trade from Orlando on Thursday, missed the 2012-13 season with a heart condition. But Cavs coach Tyron Lue said there's \"no concern at all\" he won't be cleared to play.\n\nAfter visiting the Thunder, the Cavs host Detroit on Monday, when Frye could play for the first time since the trade.\n\nAlso, Cavs guard Iman Shumpert is doubtful for Sunday's game with a sprained left shoulder. It's the same shoulder Shumpert injured last season and missed six weeks.\n\nShumpert got hurt while trying to make a steal Thursday in a victory over Chicago. He has not practiced the past two days.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed."
