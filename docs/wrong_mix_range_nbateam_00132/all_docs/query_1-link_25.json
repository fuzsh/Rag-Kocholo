        "text": "Kyrie Irving has gained plenty of critics recently, and a recent report that his \"mood swings\" are making the Brooklyn Nets uneasy isn't helping his cause.\n\nBut the former Boston Celtics point guard still has plenty of people in his corner -- among them former Cleveland Cavaliers teammate Channing Frye.\n\nThe retired NBA forward, who spent three seasons with Irving in Cleveland that included an NBA title in 2016, joined NBC Sports' Tom Haberstroh on the latest episode of the \"Habershow\" podcast to discuss why Irving doesn't get a fair shake.\n\n\"I don't know what the word 'moody' means,\" Frye told Haberstroh. \"Like, if some days he doesn't feel like talking to somebody, he is a grown man. You don't know what's going on in his life.\n\n\"I think every teammate I've ever had has bad days, so sometimes I think we try to make stories where there's no stories or we don't really think about what we're reporting.\"\n\nIrving occasionally took heat during his Boston tenure for being distant or even uncooperative with teammates and the media alike. But Frye doesn't hold that against his former point guard.\n\nThis Kyrie billboard may not sit well with Celtics fans\n\n\"It's like, 'Oh, sorry, he didn't want to do something one time?' That doesn't mean he's moody,\" Frye said. \"It just means he's having a bad day, which happens, because you see somebody every single day.\n\nBoston Celtics\n\n\" ... Like, life happens outside of sports. So, to say someone's moody, like, that's just him. He's not happy-go-lucky all the time. That's no big deal.\"\n\nFrye also made sure to note Irving -- who's the fifth-best scorer in the NBA at 28.5 points per game -- can still bring it on the court.\n\n\"And as good as he's playing this year, s---, I'll take moody,\" Frye said. \"I'll take moody all day.\"\n\nCheck out the full Habershow episode here or in the player above."
