        "text": "Suns bench didn't see Goran Dragic's nasty move coming.\n\nvia i10.photobucket.com\n\nI sure didn't see it coming. I didn't see Goran Dragic's nasty move around Fisher, followed by an right-handed off-handed lay in. I didn't see the Suns bench playing against the Lakers for 9 of the 12 4th qtr minutes, just like they did against the Spurs. I didn't see Channing Frye finally hitting his 3s. I didn't see the Lakers falling to the Suns zone defense for a second straight game. I didn't see the Suns evening the series up at 2-2. Did you see any of this coming? I sure didn't. That was a fun game last night, and I can't wait for tomorrow's Game 5 back in LA.\n\nTo hold us over until tomorrow, we have the Eastern Conference Game 5 between the Celtics and the Magic. Make the jump for some more reading.\n\nSeries gameflows: Game 1 | Game 2 | Game 3 | Game 4\n\nToday's lineup:\n\nCeltics @ Magic Game 5, ESPN 5:30pm PDT\n\nI completely missed Game 4, so pardon me for grabbing bits and pieces of info from here and there. Somehow, the Magic hung on to beat the Celtics in overtime in Game 4. I heard that Rajon Rondo suffered from back spasms, or muscle spasms, or cramps. Whatever it was, the story I heard is that he didn't look like himself, and that weakened the Celtics enough to let the Magic edge out the win in Game 4.\n\nIt turns out that Rondo isn't the only one suffering. On the Magic side, Rashard Lewis has been fighting his own health issues this series: a viral infection. He says he's been sick the entire series against the Celtics. He's been throwing up and feeling weak with no energy. The word is he'll take some IVs and go no matter what.\n\nIn any case, I've read a couple of comments about a Magic comeback in this series. It's too early to talk about the Magic being the first NBA team to come back from an 0-3 deficit. If the Magic win today, well, maybe they can. If they win Game 6, hoo boy it really could happen. Until then, I'm not ready to put the Magic and historic comeback in the same sentence.\n\nBring on Game 5!"
