        "text": "INDEPENDENCE — Channing Frye believes he is still the Cavaliers’ “text-chain guy.”\n\nHe remains the fun-seeking teammate always suggesting group gatherings or stopping to get a glass of wine after games. Former general manager David Griffin cited Frye as instrumental in breaking up the Cavs’ cliques and fostering closeness during the 2016 championship season.\n\nBut coach Tyronn Lue has a different role in mind for Frye as the post-LeBron James Cavs prepare to open the season Wednesday at Toronto.\n\nLue wants Frye to be their James Jones.\n\nJones was one of the most respected players in the league as he and James went to seven consecutive NBA Finals with the Miami Heat and Cavs. Jones was not in Cleveland for the eighth, retiring in July 2017 to become vice president of basketball operations for the Phoenix Suns. Jones has since been promoted to interim GM.\n\nFrye may have no desire to follow in Jones’ footsteps into a front-office career post-basketball, definitely ruling out coaching. But Frye, a 35-year-old center/forward, knows how much responsibility filling the Cavs’ void left by Jones carries.\n\n“That’s a lot. That’s the gold standard,” Frye said Tuesday after practice at Cleveland Clinic Courts.\n\nWhat Frye can bring to the Cavs off the court may be the reason the front office was thrilled when he signed a one-year veteran’s minimum contract on July 19. The Cavs traded Frye to the Los Angeles Lakers in February in the deal that brought them Larry Nance Jr. and Jordan Clarkson.\n\nEmbracing the challenge of being the sage veteran of the Cavs even though Kyle Korver, 37, is older, Frye said he talks to Jones every two weeks.\n\n“He said, 'Enjoy it, man. Enjoy the camaraderie, enjoy your teammates. Always feel like you have to do what’s best for you to be ready, but at the same time you have to give everything you have mentally to the team,’ ” Frye said of Jones’ advice. “ 'You have to watch more film than everybody. You’ve got to know all the plays and know where people should go. You’re an extension of the coach.’ ”\n\nFrye said he has plied Jones with questions like, “ ‘What did you do? How did you do this?’ or ‘What was your mindset on this?’ ”\n\n“I have to be me,” Frye said. “How I always watched James was like in awe of his routines, how he would be completely separate, but a part of us. Separating yourself from the team so you can give them straight-across-the-board advice that’s unemotional, that’s strictly for basketball. I’m not afraid to be wrong, but most of the time I’m not afraid to do the work to be right. If you want me to be here with you to work on something, I will. If you want to get better, you can just ask me.”\n\nFrye said he’s never been afraid to be bluntly honest.\n\n“I’m very no-holds [barred], but I say it in more of a joking manner than he did,” Frye said of Jones.\n\nLue said he sees similarities in Jones and Frye, both in how they prepare and how they communicate.\n\n“He’s great in the locker room, he’s great with the young guys, he’s always out here working every single day,” Lue said of Frye. “You see a veteran like that working every single day, it’s huge. And when we put him in a game, he’s going to be ready to play.\n\n“Channing helping the younger guys understand what we’ve done over the last four years and the culture we try to build here, he’s been good with that. Just talking to the young guys, teaching the young guys, you see he’s always pulling the guys to the side.”\n\nFrye admitted that working behind the scenes wasn’t the reason he returned to Cleveland.\n\n“If I didn’t think there was an opportunity for me to play at all this year I wouldn’t have come back,” he said. “Injuries happen, things happen. If I can make an impact and help us go to the playoffs, then I’ll definitely be happy.”\n\nBut on a team that may open the season with seven rotation players 25 or younger, Frye knows his role will require spending time with his teammates away from Cleveland Clinic Courts or Quicken Loans Arena. He said his wife, Lauren, has commented how much he’s been around the house during training camp, but that will soon change.\n\n“I’ll ask you to come to dinner, eat, drink with us, let’s see the world.” Frye said. “If you want to go walk around the city, hit me up, I’m down to do that. That’s what you have to do so you can have relationships.”\n\nCavs fall to Pistons\n\nBlake Griffin and Andre Drummond combined for 50 points as the Detroit Pistons topped the Cavaliers 129-110 in a preseason game Friday night at Michigan State University.\n\nRodney Hood made 11-of-12 free throws and scored 21 points for the Cavs, who finished the preseason with a 2-2 record. Also in double figures for the Cavs were George Hill (14 points), Tristan Thompson (13), Kyle Korver (11) and Ante Zizic (11).\n\nGriffin had 29 points and Drummond had 21 points and 15 rebounds for the Pistons, who led 35-30 after one quarter, 69-60 at halftime and 97-91 heading into the fourth."
