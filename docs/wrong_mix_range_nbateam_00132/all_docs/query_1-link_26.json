        "text": "Before things got close in the second half -- how did a 62-42 halftime lead become a 93-85 game with just 7:14 left? -- the Boston Celtics were cruising past the Phoenix Suns in the third quarter. A lot of credit is due to Kevin Garnett who led all scorers with 28 points (to go along with 11 rebounds), a nice evening for him, especially considering everything that happened that last time these two teams met in Phoenix.\n\nâ†µ\n\nBut the play of the night -- and the NBA's Dunk of the Night -- came courtesy of Paul Pierce, who threw it down on (around?), ironically enough, Channing Frye, putting the Celtics up 24 at the time.\n\nâ†µ â†µ\n\nPierce was hit with the technical foul for scowling afterward. No doubt done in tribute to Kendrick Perkins."
