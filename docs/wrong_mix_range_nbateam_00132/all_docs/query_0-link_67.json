        "text": "At the end of this season, Channing Frye will be calling it a career.\n\nOn Friday, Frye tweeted that, at the end of the season, he’ll be retiring after 13 NBA seasons.\n\nFrye, who is 35 and will turn 36 before the start of next season, first hinted at his retirement in an Instagram post after the Cavs played the Knicks, writing “Playing at MSG for the last time last night, had me thinking of how fast time has flown by.” Frye played the first two years of his career with the Knicks and, in addition to the Cavs, Frye played for the Trail Blazers, Suns, Magic and Lakers.\n\nAs a member of the 2016 title team — and a key piece on that team, both on and off the court — Frye will always be beloved in Cleveland. As one Twitter user suggested, he should never have to buy a meal or drink in Cleveland for the rest of his life. And considering he hosts the Road Trippin’ podcast, this also likely won’t be the last anyone hears of Frye.\n\nIn his four seasons with the Cavs, Frye has averaged 6.8 points and 3.1 rebounds per game. In 29 games this season, he has averaged 3.3 points."
