        "text": "If the Boston Celtics had an interest in trying to trade for Portland Trail Blazer veteran guard C.J. McCollum, it may have waned a bit after hearing what former teammate Channing Frye believes it would take to get him in green and white.\n\nTo be very clear — it does not seem that the Portland guard is on the market, but rather that the topic came up in a recent episode of the “Talkin’ Blazers” podcast, of which Frye is a co-cost.\n\nFor teams that would like to add the veteran sharpshooter’s services, the price would evidently be a steep one — to the point it would make little sense for a contending team like Boston to go after if Frye’s assessment were accurate.\n\n“If you want CJ McCollum and somebody, you’d have to give me Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart,” explained Frye on the podcast. “That’s what I see CJ’s value as.”\n\nHe would go on to suggest perhaps a deal built around Gordon Hayward and Smart could also work.\n\nOn paper, the math for the Brown-Smart deal makes sense financially, but it’s arguable Brown alone is worth more as a player, and when you add in Smart’s value deal it becomes a non-starter.\n\nHowever, while the financials of a Smart-Hayward deal don’t add up, throwing in a year of Trevor Ariza as a backup wing if the Indiana native were definitely leaving at the end of the season and there were no better deal to be had at least has a leg to stand on.\n\nIf you view it as an upgrade from Smart alone with McCollum as the focal point, it’s a definsible move, even if one that isn’t going to happen, and that at least we would pass on.\n\nSmart may still have heat-check games and other creases to his game still in need of ironing out, but he’s matured mightily as a player, becoming a threat on both ends earning several million below his market value.\n\nAnd while McCollum is a steadier source of offense, what you gain there you lose on defense, making the Blazers guard hard to fit next to starting point guard Kemba Walker.\n\n[jwplayer uloPlAaR]"
