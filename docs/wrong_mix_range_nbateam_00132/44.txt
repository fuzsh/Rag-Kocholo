Over the past year, the NBA has dealt with a comparatively high amount of coronary problems. Last December, it was announced that Boston Celtics forward and key reserve Jeff Green would miss the entire season after having surgery to repair an aortic aneurysm. Then, three months later, it came to light that Green's teammate Chris Wilcox would also miss the rest of the season with an enlarged aorta. These were sad stories, obviously, but also happy ones in that team doctors were able to catch the issues before they became more serious.

No one wants to see more of them, though. And so, on Thursday we got more bad news: Suns sharpshooter Channing Frye is out indefinitely due to an enlarged heart. From the Associated Press:

On Twitter, Frye thanked fans and well-wishers for the outpouring of support.

Elsewhere, Paul Coro of The Arizona Republic spoke with Frye and has more details:

Again, this is very unfortunate news, but Frye is taking the diagnosis with the appropriate level of seriousness and making sure he can return with a full bill of health in the fall of 2013. At 29 years old, Frye has the majority of his life ahead of him, and he intends to use it.

On the court, the Suns were already facing a tough season after star point guard Steve Nash's move to the rival Los Angeles Lakers, and losing Frye's ability to stretch the floor will only make things worse. Regardless, it's tough to think too much of wins and losses when a person's long-term health is at stake. For the NBA, all heart-related ailments bring to mind the shocking death of Celtics guard Reggie Lewis at an offseason practice in 1993. That incident transformed the way that the NBA screens its players for heart defects, and Green, Wilcox, and Frye can partially thank those changes for having their issues caught relatively early.
