According to a social media post that LeBron James shared on Wednesday, he will be appearing on the next episode of Road Trippin‘ with Richard Jefferson, Channing Frye and Allie Clifton. James shared a zoom meeting image with his two former Cleveland Cavaliers teammates and Clifton, who covered the Cavs championship team for Fox Sports Ohio before moving on to cover the Los Angeles Lakers.

Building on a deal first signed in January 2019, NBA Digital – the basketball league’s partnership with Turner Sports – will offer a live streaming option for the second half of at least 20 regular season games, the All-Star Game and 16 play-off games, including the Western Conference finals. The US geo-locked Twitter feed features an isolated-camera on a player voted on by users, with NBA influencers and veteran star Channing Frye providing commentary.

Former NBA player Channing Frye believes the Boston Celtics have started the 2019-20 NBA season so well because the head coach’s system runs better with Kemba Walker at point guard than it did with Kyrie Irving. Frye told NBA TV’s “Handles” the offseason point guard change has helped the other Celtics players flourish to the team’s overall benefit. “I think it is (designed to excel without a superstar),” Frye said of Stevens’ scheme. “I think for them, less is more. “They drafted really well, they made some good acquisitions when they had Al Horford and Gordon Hayward. Those guys fit into Brad Stevens’ system and they excel in that.

Frye will co-host a new weekly podcast, Talkin’ Blazers, with NBC Sports Northwest’s Dan Sheldon, Northwest Emmy Award winner and co-host of the Rip City Morning’s radio show. With new episodes dropping each Friday throughout the NBA season, Talkin’ Blazers will discuss all things Trail Blazers as Frye and Sheldon also dive into conversations that extend beyond the court, discussing Portland lifestyle, culture and community.
