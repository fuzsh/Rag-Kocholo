Former Arizona Wildcats center Channing Frye has decided to sit out the 2012-13 NBA season with the Phoenix Suns after he was diagnosed this week with an enlarged heart. The team announced the news on Thursday and said the starting power forward's condition was found during a routine preseason physical exam.

Suns beat reporter Paul Coro talked to Frye, who said he was scared after learning of the problem but was no doubt going to return to the hardwood when he's ready.

"The good news is it is a virus so it does have a good chance of going away," Frye said. "My heart can be normal again."

"It was very shocking and, at the same time, scary," he said of his situation. "It's not like an arm or a knee or an elbow where you're like, 'Maybe I can just rehab this.' It's something that keeps you going."

Frye won't participate in basketball activities and his condition will be reevaluated by the Suns medical staff in December.

Under such a diagnosis, there's the worry for a heart problem that goes beyond if and when Frye will return. But the good news is that it was caught, and recent medicine has shown that much worse heart ailments didn't keep players off the floor.

Ronny Turiaf underwent open heart surgery and won an NBA championship with the Miami Heat. Jeff Green missed all of last season with the Boston Celtics after a more severe heart condition was discovered. The Boston forward issued his support for Frye on Twitter Thursday.

Former Arizona manager and NAU Lumberjacks head coach Jack Murphy, who was on staff when Frye was at Arizona, wished Frye the best of luck.

Arizona head coach Sean Miller offered his well wishes to Frye via Twitter as well.

You know, Luke Walton joined Memphis' coaching staff during the NBA lockout last season. If Frye takes Miller up on the offer, it wouldn't be too bad to have a successful NBA player around the program a little more often than usual.

But of course, the main thing on Frye's plate should and will be his health.
