The purpose of this research was to find the relationship of sport injuries in neck and trunk and fitness factors in female futsal players. Sixty eight athletes (19-22 yrs) of futsal teams participated in 2012 in competition were selected as statistical samples. Fitness tests were used to measure their physical fitness. A questionnaire was used for the collection of sport injuries. K-square of correlation coefficient was used to examine the relationship between variables. The results showed that it is observed that 5.9% of the subjects had injuries in the neck, 1.5% at their trunk. There have not been found any rate of injuries in the forehead and ears of players (p&gt;0.05).

The main purpose of this study was to investigate injury patterns, risk factors and causes in female futsal players. This study was performed on 66 volunteer female athletes (age: 20.72±2.08) playing at different university teams. Sports injuries were detected by means of data forms. Describe statistic was applied and Pearson Correlation Test was used to determine whether there was a significant correlation between the quantitative parameters. Totally, 93 sports injuries were investigated related futsal. Twenty nine (31.20%) of the all injuries occurred in preseason and 64(68.80%) occurred in the competition season. Fifty three (57.00%) of 93 injuries occurred in lower extremities and 22(23.70%) occurred in upper extremity. The overall injury rate of ankle injuries was 25 (26.90%), knee:20 (%21.50),low back: 15 (16.10%), hip/thigh/leg:11(11.80%), shoulder:8(8.60%), elbow:4 (4.30%), hand/finger:5 (5.40%), and head/face:5 (5.40%). The proportion of acute/traumatic injuries was 73 (78.50%) and overuse was 20 (21.50%) and 24.70% of all injuries were caused by contacting to rival player. Because futsal is a foot sport, high rate of lower extremity injuries (ankle, knee, leg, hip and thigh) may be accepted inevitable. Wearing protective equipment, performing functional strength training and efficient warm up/calm down exercises might reduce the risk of sports injuries related futsal.

Introduction: This study aimed to investigate the mechanism and incidence of sports injuries in male handball players of the Iran premier league. Materials and Methods: The study data were collected by an injury report form filled out based on the video analysis. A total of 46 out of 90 videos of matches were analyzed. The statistical population of this study consisted 120 players of ten teams. Concerning this point that data were non-parametric, the Chi-squared test (P<0.05) was used to analyze the gathered data. Results: Mean±SD height, weight, and age of the handball players were 184.3±6.5 cm, 85.2±8.5 kg, 23.4±4.2 years, respectively. A total of 105 injuries were recorded; this rate is equal to 164.5 injuries per 1000 h of competition. Most injuries occurred in lower extremities (39.2%), especially in the knee (21%), (χ 2 =26.92, P=0.001). The injury rate among back players (54.1%) was higher compared to other players (χ 2 =26.95, P=0.001). The difference in the type of contact that resulted in injury was statistically significant (χ 2 =60.40, P=0.001). The main mechanisms of injury in different playing positions were blocking (23.8%), being blocked (21%), and face hitting with hand (18.1%) (χ 2 =1.05, P=0.001). The rate of injury in the dominant side (70.4%) was significantly higher than the non-dominant side (29.6%), (χ 2 =8.96, P=0.003). Conclusion: Among handball players of the Iranian premier league, most of the injuries occurred in the knee and ankle regions. Back players suffered more injuries in comparison with other players. Also, blocking was the dominant mechanism of injury.

Introduction: Football is the most common sport played not only in Kuwait but also worldwide. This sport is not limited to athletes only; many of non-athletes practice it regularly on a daily basis. Football injuries are very common, caused by different factors that can be eradicated by preventive measures .Aim: This study is conducted to find out the prevalence of most common football injuries among athletes and non-athletes in Kuwait, in order to prevent these injuries. Method: This study was held in several Kuwait clubs and 2 malls in Kuwait to include athletes and non-athletes players. Our study tool is a questionnaire distributed from June 2013 to September 2013. It is a cross sectional study with a sample size of 400 Kuwaitis including 200 athletes and 200 non-athletes. All samples were chosen randomly to capture the inclusion criteria. Result: From our results, we established that the most common injury among athletes is the ankle in both age groups (above 18 and under 18 years old) On the other hand, the most common injury in non-athletes differs in both age groups making the knee the most injured site in above 18 years old and the hand in under 18 years old. Also we found that,lack of warm up is the most common cause of these injuries in both, athletes and non-athletes.Conclusion and Recommendation: We have seen that the prevalence of football injuries in Kuwait this year is 79%.We recommend the Authority of Youth and Sports to educate the players about protective methods to prevent injuries.

Study aim: To assess the prevalence and anatomical sites of injuries in professional soccer players in one game season. Material and methods: A cohort of 510 professional male soccer players consisting of 48 goalkeepers, 194 defence players, 189 mid-field players and 79 forward players of the 1st and 2nd Turkish Professional Soccer Leagues in 2005-2006 season were requested to submit questionnaire reports on all injuries they experienced. Results: About 60% of all injuries pertained to lower extremities, another 25% to upper extremities, the most frequent being skin abrasions (about 24%). The percentage of players who sustained injuries was lowest among mid-field players (about 47%) compared with other categories (nearly 70%) but the average number of injuries per player was highest among them (8.1 vs. about 4.5). The risk of sustaining injury when playing a match amounted to 9.8% for mid-field players; that was significantly (p<0.01) lower (11.7 - 13.0%) than for other categories of players. Conclusions: Football injuries are the major factor affecting players' performance. Thus, appropriate strategies, aimed at reducing injuries, ought to be implemented.
