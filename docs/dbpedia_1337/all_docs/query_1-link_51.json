        "text": "RIYADH: The head of the Saudi Arabian Football Federation’s Women’s Football Department, Aalia Al-Rasheed, has lauded the Kingdom’s female futsal players as they near the end of their training camp in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nIn the last two weeks, Saudi’s national futsal team has secured impressive back-to-back victories against Serbia in Sarajevo.\n\nIn the first match, they recorded a 3-2 thanks to goals from Al-Bandari Mubarak, Seba Tawfiq and Al-Bandari Hawsawi. This was followed by a 5-2 win, with Al-Bandari Mubarak scoring all five of Saudia Arabia’s goals.\n\nThe national team are currently ranked 51st in the FIFA Futsal Women’s World Ranking, whilst the Serbian national team are ranked 43rd.\n\n“These wins show just how much effort and passion our team puts into every game,” said Al-Rasheed. “Winning against a strong team like Serbia really boosts (their) confidence and highlights the progress we’re making in women's futsal. It’s incredibly rewarding to see the hard work of our players and coaching staff pay off in such a significant way.”\n\nShe added: “We’ve been focusing on building a strong, cohesive team, and these victories are indications that we’re on the right path. Our goal is to keep pushing forward, learn from every match, and continue to grow. We’re determined to keep this momentum going and reach even greater heights. The support from SAFF and the dedication of our players are key to our success, and I couldn’t be prouder of what we’ve achieved so far.”\n\nThe friendly matches were part of the team’s training camp in Sarajevo, which started in May and continues until June 15. Overseen by head coach Mato Stankovic, it is seen as a critical part of their preparation for upcoming competitions and matches.\n\nThe players currently in Sarajevo are: Layla Ali, Leen Mohammed, Al-Bandari Mubarak, Noura Ibrahim, Atha Fahad, Abeer Nasser, Raghad Mukhayzin, Rahaf Al-Mansouri, Al-Hanouf Saud, Mohrah Al-Malhi, Nadeen Saleh, Al-Bandari Hawsawi, Raghad Saleh, Lana Abdulrazaq, Bayan Sadagah, Seba Tawfiq, Yara Alfaris, Raghad Munai, Manar Al-Onaizi, and Noura Al-Athel.\n\nNEW YORK: Iga Swiatek and Jannik Sinner flashed their No. 1 form on Thursday with powerful performances that moved them into the third round of the US Open.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz and Naomi Osaka couldn’t quite find the games that once had them on top of the rankings.\n\nThose past US Open champions were both knocked out Thursday night, with the No. 3-seeded Alcaraz’s 15-match Grand Slam winning streak halted by a 6-1, 7-5, 6-4 loss to 74th-ranked Botic van de Zandschulp.\n\nSwiatek raced by Japanese qualifier Ena Shibahara 6-0, 6-1, finishing off the match in 65 minutes. It took the 2022 US Open champion longer than that to play the second set of her first-round match, when she needed a tiebreaker that she eventually closed out in 72 minutes.\n\n“I just felt the rhythm was much better,” Swiatek said. “I was a bit tense in my last match, so today I just wanted to focus on the right things.”\n\nEarlier, Sinner downed Alex Michelsen 6-4, 6-0, 6-2 in 1 hour, 39 minutes.\n\nBut on the same Arthur Ashe Stadium court at night, Osaka’s forehand faltered in key moments and the two-time US Open champion was eliminated by Karolina Muchova 6-3, 7-6 (5).\n\nSinner dropped the first set in his opening match in New York but didn’t encounter much trouble while facing his second straight American on Ashe. The Italian earned his 50th victory of the season, including his ATP Tour-leading 30th on hard courts.\n\nHis previous one was a little shaky after a slow start against Mackie McDonald, so Sinner got in a practice session after that match and was happy with the results Thursday.\n\n“Trying to keep going, trying to understand what works here best on these courts. Let’s see what I can do in the next round,” he said.\n\nThat will be against Christopher O’Connell of Australia on Saturday.\n\nNo. 5 seed Daniil Medvedev, the 2021 US Open champion, moved into the third round along with No. 10 Alex de Minaur, who will next face Dan Evans. Evans’ victory in a tidy 2 hours, 37 minutes was three hours quicker than it took him to beat Karen Khachanov in the first round, their match setting a US Open record by lasting 5 hours, 35 minutes.\n\nSinner beat Michelsen for the second time this month, having also won a second-round match in Cincinnati shortly before it was revealed that he tested positive twice for an anabolic steroid in March.\n\nAnother Italian, Jasmine Paolini, played just three points before advancing when Karolina Pliskova appeared to injure her left foot. The No. 5-seeded Paolini, who has reached the finals of the French Open and Wimbledon in her breakout season, advanced past the second round of the US Open for the first time.\n\n“Finally, we made third round!” she said with a laugh during an interview on the court.\n\nPaolini will next play No. 30 seed Yulia Putintseva.\n\nOther women’s winners included No. 6 Jessica Pegula, No. 15 Anna Kalinskaya, No. 16 Liudmilla Samsonova and No. 18 Diana Shnaider. Pegula took out fellow American Sofia Kenin.\n\nBut No. 4 seed Elena Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, withdrew from the tournament before her second-round match with a lower back injury, sending French qualifier Jessika Ponchet to the weekend.\n\n“Unfortunately, I have to withdraw from my match today due to my injuries,” Rybakina said in a statement. “I did not want to finish the last Grand Slam of the year this way but I have to listen to my body, and I hope I can close out the remainder of the year strong.”\n\nNo. 7 seed Hurbert Hurkacz was eliminated in straight sets by Jordan Thompson, and No. 16 Sebastian Korda was knocked out by Tomas Machac.\n\nMADRID: Kylian Mbappe remained scoreless and defending champion Real Madrid settled for a 1-1 draw at Las Palmas in the Spanish league on Thursday.\n\nMbappe, Madrid’s biggest signing in years, is yet to score in the league this season. His only goal with Madrid came in the team’s UEFA Super Cup victory against Atalanta earlier this month.\n\nIt was Vinicius Junior who scored for Madrid, who beat Valladolid 3-0 in the previous round but had opened their title defense with a 1-1 draw at Mallorca.\n\n“It’s been difficult for us to be as solid as we were last season,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. “We need to find a solution quickly, and I think we are going to find it. It has been harder than expected. These first three matches showed me a lot of things that have not been working well.”\n\nVinicius found the net for his first league goal this season by converting a 69th-minute penalty kick after a handball inside the area.\n\nThe hosts had taken the lead five minutes into the match after Alberto Moleiro got past a couple of defenders before finding the net from inside the area.\n\nYoung Brazil forward Endrick, who scored against Valladolid in his debut, came off the bench in the 86th to replace Vinicius Junior.\n\nLas Palmas are yet to win this season, having drawn against Sevilla and lost at Leganes.\n\nBarcelona on Tuesday became the only team with three wins in the first three rounds after a 2-1 victory at Rayo Vallecano.\n\nGirona, the surprise team last season after a third-place finish, earned their first win with a 4-0 rout of Osasuna at home.\n\nBryan Gil scored in the first half, then Viktor Tsygankov, Abel Ruiz and Cristhian Stuani sealed the victory in the second.\n\nGirona had opened with a draw and a loss. Osasuna had a draw and a win from their first two matches.\n\nPARIS: The Paris Paralympics crowned its first champions on Thursday, with swimmer Ugo Didier collecting the host nation’s first gold in euphoric scenes at La Defense Arena.\n\nDidier, who was born with clubbed feet and has reduced use of his legs, won the 400m freestyle event in the S9 category after being roared home by French supporters in scenes reminiscent of those when Leon Marchand won four golds at the Olympics.\n\nDidier, 22, timed 4min 12.55sec to finish a second and a half ahead of Simone Barlaam of Italy.\n\nBrazilian swimmer Gabrielzinho won the third Paralympic title of his career. The 22-year-old, who has no arms or hands and his legs are atrophied, claimed the men’s 100m backstroke S2 title.\n\nFrancesco Bocciardo and Carlotta Gilli launched much-fancied Italy’s search for multiple swimming golds as they both successfully defended their titles.\n\nMedals were also on offer in track cycling, table tennis and taekwondo.\n\nParalympic powerhouses China dominated the last Games in Tokyo with 96 golds and cyclists Zhangyu Li and Xiaomei Wang opened their account in Paris.\n\nThe Chinese also won two golds in swimming to take an early lead in the medals table.\n\nThere was bitter disappointment though for Britain’s Kadeena Cox after her eight-year reign as C4-5 time trial champion ended when she crashed in the velodrome just meters after pushing off.\n\nThe action started too in archery, sitting volleyball, wheelchair basketball, wheelchair rugby, badminton, goalball — a form of football for the visually impaired but played with hands — and boccia, a version of bowls.\n\nIn men’s wheelchair basketball, reigning champions USA and the pretenders to their title, Great Britain, were quick to get their first wins.\n\nThe Americans had a hard-fought 66-56 victory against Spain while Britain, the bronze medallists three years ago in Tokyo, beat Germany 76-55.\n\nBritain, who finished second in the medal standings behind the Chinese at the 2020 Paralympics, made a winning start to the defense of their men’s wheelchair rugby title as they beat world champions Australia 58-55.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron declared the Games open on Wednesday after a ceremony blessed with balmy weather — a far cry from the rain that poured all evening when the Olympics opened with a parade on the River Seine on July 26.\n\nThe 4,400 competitors from 168 delegations marched into the Place de la Concorde in central Paris as the sun set.\n\nInternational Paralympic Committee (IPC) president Andrew Parsons said in a speech he hoped for an “inclusion revolution.”\n\n“The Paris 2024 Paralympic Games will show persons with disabilities what they can achieve at the highest level,” Parsons said.\n\n“The fact that these opportunities largely exist only in sport in the year 2024 is shocking. It is proof that we can and must do more to advance disability.”\n\nFive French Paralympians, including 2020 gold medalists Alexis Hanquinquant and Nantenin Keita, then lit the already-iconic cauldron in the Tuileries Gardens before it rose into the sky.\n\nOf the 35 venues for the highly successful Olympics, 18 will be used for the Paralympics including the ornate Grand Palais and the Stade de France.\n\nRiding the wave of their Olympic team’s success, host nation France are aiming for a far stronger showing than the 11 golds they won in 2021, which placed them 14th in the medals table.\n\nOn Friday, giant Iranian sitting volleyball legend Morteza Mehrzad, who stands 8ft 1in (2.46m) tall, starts his bid for another gold medal as his nation faces Ukraine in the preliminary round. Iran have won three of the last four titles.\n\nMONACO: The Champions League will have a series of rematches of recent finals in the bigger slate of games paired Thursday in the new format of European soccer’s signature competition.\n\nReal Madrid will have re-runs of their past three Champions League title wins, against Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund, in a revamped eight-game schedule for each team now the traditional group stage is abolished.\n\nMadrid have added France superstar Kylian Mbappe to their stellar team since beating Dortmund in last season’s final. They also beat Liverpool in the 2022 and 2018 finals among their record 15 European titles.\n\nMadrid will host Dortmund and travel to Liverpool, though the match dates are not confirmed until Saturday.\n\nManchester City also get a Champions League final reunion — hosting Inter Milan they beat to win their European title in 2023.\n\nBayern Munich will host Paris Saint-Germain in a rematch of the 2020 final that the German giants won 1-0.\n\nDefending champion Madrid’s slate of opponents also include home games against seven-time European champion AC Milan, Salzburg and Stuttgart with trips to Atalanta — the Europa League winner that Madrid beat in the UEFA Super Cup this month — and twice to France, to play Lille and debutant Brest.\n\nA complex draw ceremony in Monaco aided on stage by Cristiano Ronaldo gave eight-team slates of opponents for all 36 teams in the bigger and more lucrative Champions League, that has a prize money fund of at least &euro;2.5 billion ($2.8 billion).\n\nThe traditional 32-team group stage played each season since 2003 was scrapped in favor of a single-standings league. Now, 36 teams each will play eight games against eight different opponents through January.\n\nThe top eight in the standings in January go direct to the round of 16 in March. Teams ranked ninth to 24th go into the knockout playoffs in February. The bottom 12 teams are eliminated.\n\nMan City’s away games at PSG and Juventus were balanced by one of the easier slates of home games: against Club Brugge, Feyenoord and Sparta Prague.\n\nThe English champions also must travel to Slovan Bratislava, one of the lowest-ranked teams, which meant avoiding Girona, their Spanish sibling in an Abu Dhabi-backed global network of clubs. Man City is the flagship club and its owners had to put their Girona shares into a blind trust to comply with UEFA integrity rules.\n\nBayern also will host Barcelona, whom they routed 8-2 in the quarterfinals of the 2020 title run, and travel to Aston Villa, the surprise winner of their 1982 European Cup final.\n\nLiverpool will host Bayer Leverkusen, the German champion coached by their former star midfielder Xabi Alonso, in a standout match of the expanded league phase.\n\nLeverkusen will host city rivals Inter Milan and AC Milan, and also travel to Atletico Madrid.\n\nThe new-style draw was made at a gala ceremony in a beach-side concert hall in Monaco with soccer greats Ronaldo and Gianluigi Buffon.\n\nAfter each team’s ball was picked by Buffon from one of four bowls — seeded according to results in the past five years of European club competitions — Ronaldo theatrically pressed a button for the reveal of how a software program allocated two opponents from each of the four seeding pots.\n\nThe new format was created by UEFA under pressure from influential clubs who wanted more guaranteed games and a wider variety of high-profile opponents, believing the old group stage was predictable and lacked drama. The later knockout stages have typically involved only wealthy clubs from the richest domestic leagues.\n\n“If you see the number of competitive matches in this format, unbelievable. It’s amazing,” PSG President Nasser Al-Khelaifi said. “That’s what everybody wanted to change.”\n\nAl-Khelaifi leads the influential European Club Association which negotiated the new format with UEFA. They also manage the competition’s commercial strategy in a joint venture.\n\nThe new league phase will have 144 total games compared to 96 in the group stage last season. By also adding a new knockout playoffs round in February, the competition overall has 189 games instead of 125.\n\nThis Champions League edition already was given a fresh look by unexpected entries from each of the big-five domestic leagues, which all were among the lowest-ranked seeds.\n\nVilla return for the first time since their European Cup title defense in 1983 was ended by Juventus that they will host again.\n\nBologna last qualified in 1964, Stuttgart are back after a 14-year gap, while Girona and Brest will make their European competition debuts. Brest will host defending champions Madrid and Leverkusen in a borrowed stadium in nearby Breton town Guingamp because their 102-year-old home ground is outdated."
