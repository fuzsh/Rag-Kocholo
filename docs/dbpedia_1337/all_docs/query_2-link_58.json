        "text": "RIYADH: The head of the Saudi Arabian Football Federation’s Women’s Football Department, Aalia Al-Rasheed, has lauded the Kingdom’s female futsal players as they near the end of their training camp in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nIn the last two weeks, Saudi’s national futsal team has secured impressive back-to-back victories against Serbia in Sarajevo.\n\nIn the first match, they recorded a 3-2 thanks to goals from Al-Bandari Mubarak, Seba Tawfiq and Al-Bandari Hawsawi. This was followed by a 5-2 win, with Al-Bandari Mubarak scoring all five of Saudia Arabia’s goals.\n\nThe national team are currently ranked 51st in the FIFA Futsal Women’s World Ranking, whilst the Serbian national team are ranked 43rd.\n\n“These wins show just how much effort and passion our team puts into every game,” said Al-Rasheed. “Winning against a strong team like Serbia really boosts (their) confidence and highlights the progress we’re making in women's futsal. It’s incredibly rewarding to see the hard work of our players and coaching staff pay off in such a significant way.”\n\nShe added: “We’ve been focusing on building a strong, cohesive team, and these victories are indications that we’re on the right path. Our goal is to keep pushing forward, learn from every match, and continue to grow. We’re determined to keep this momentum going and reach even greater heights. The support from SAFF and the dedication of our players are key to our success, and I couldn’t be prouder of what we’ve achieved so far.”\n\nThe friendly matches were part of the team’s training camp in Sarajevo, which started in May and continues until June 15. Overseen by head coach Mato Stankovic, it is seen as a critical part of their preparation for upcoming competitions and matches.\n\nThe players currently in Sarajevo are: Layla Ali, Leen Mohammed, Al-Bandari Mubarak, Noura Ibrahim, Atha Fahad, Abeer Nasser, Raghad Mukhayzin, Rahaf Al-Mansouri, Al-Hanouf Saud, Mohrah Al-Malhi, Nadeen Saleh, Al-Bandari Hawsawi, Raghad Saleh, Lana Abdulrazaq, Bayan Sadagah, Seba Tawfiq, Yara Alfaris, Raghad Munai, Manar Al-Onaizi, and Noura Al-Athel.\n\nISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Monday it had appointed five former cricketers mentors for the domestic cricket season 2024-25, following a “robust and transparent” recruitment process.\n\nThese former cricketers include Waqar Younis, Saqlain Mushtaq, Misbal-ul-Haq, Shoaib Malik and Sarfaraz Ahmed who have cumulatively played 1,621 international matches, with a total score of 32,780 runs and 1,503 wickets.\n\nThe development comes a day Pakistan’s loss to Bangladesh in the first of a two-match Test series. It followed Pakistan’s humiliating exit from the World Cup this year.\n\nThe decision to appoint mentors was aimed at precisely spotting the new cricketing talent in the South Asian country, according to the PCB.\n\n“Misbah-ul-Haq, Saqlain Mushtaq, Sarfaraz Ahmed, Shoaib Malik and Waqar Younis were today confirmed as mentors of the five Champions Cup sides on three-year contracts following a transparent and robust recruitment process,” the PCB said in a statement on Monday. “Names of their sides and squads will be confirmed in due course.”\n\nIt said the first assignment to be undertaken by the mentors would be the Champions Cup being held in the eastern Punjab province on Sep 12-29 after two years.\n\nOf the five mentors, Sarfaraz and Shoaib are two-time ICC event winners, Misbah is the 2012 Asia Cup winning captain, while Saqlain and Waqar were part of the team that played the 1999 World Cup final that Pakistan lost to Australia.\n\nPCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi said he was pleased to welcome five “exceptional champions” as mentors of the Champions Cup teams.\n\n“These individuals bring a wealth of cricketing experience, knowledge and expertise, which, combined with their passion for the game we all love, will help the Pakistan Cricket Board identify, develop and nurture the next generation of cricketers across all formats,” he said, highlighting that the initiative will bridge the gap between domestic and international cricket.\n\nNaqvi said the five mentors would play a role in the progression of emerging cricketers that would aid in “strategic planning and team-building processes,” apart from providing leadership and personal development support.\n\n“The PCB is committed to strengthening Pakistan’s cricket through a robust domestic structure that offers a clear and competitive pathway for all cricketers,” he said. “The most talented and skilled players will advance through the ranks to represent Pakistan at the highest level.”\n\nRAWALPINDI: Pakistan and Bangladesh have been fined and docked World Test Championship points over slow over rates during the first Test in Rawalpindi, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said Monday.\n\nBangladesh achieved their first victory over Pakistan in 14 Tests with a thumping 10-wicket win on Sunday after both teams struggled in hot conditions on a flat Rawalpindi pitch.\n\n“Hosts Pakistan were found to be six overs short and lost six WTC points, while visitors Bangladesh were docked three points after being found three overs short of the acceptable rate,” the ICC said in a release.\n\nPakistan’s players were also fined 30 percent of their match fee and the Bangladeshis 15 percent, it said.\n\nPakistan slumped to eighth in the nine-team WTC points table after the defeat, while Bangladesh are seventh.\n\nBangladesh allrounder Shakib Al Hasan was also fined 10 percent of his match fee and received a demerit point for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct.\n\n“Shakib threw the ball at Pakistan’s Mohammad Rizwan in the 33rd over of the second innings after the latter had backed away,” the ICC said.\n\nThe second and final Test will also be played in Rawalpindi from Friday.\n\nSTOCKHOLM: Swedish football manager Sven-Goran Eriksson, who coached England from 2001 to 2006, died Monday at the age of 76 after a battle with pancreatic cancer, his agent said.\n\n“He passed away peacefully this morning with his family around him at his home,” Eriksson’s agent Bo Gustavsson told AFP.\n\nThe Swede, who managed a number of high-profile teams and took England to World Cup quarter-finals in 2002 and 2006, announced in February 2023 that he was stepping back from public life due to “health issues.”\n\nIn January, he told public broadcaster Sveriges Radio that he was suffering from pancreatic cancer and that his doctor’s assessment was that he had “at best maybe a year (to live), at worst a little less.”\n\n“We have known about this but it happened very quickly. We were not prepared for it to happen today,” Gustavsson told AFP.\n\nBorn February 5, 1948 in Sunne in western Sweden, Eriksson, who goes by “Svennis” to Swedes, found success as a football manager after retiring from a modest career as a defender.\n\nIn 1977, he became manager of Swedish club Degerfors IF. After leading the small club to success in lower divisions, he attracted the attention of bigger clubs.\n\nHe went on to manage Sweden’s IFK Goteborg before finding success internationally, managing Benfica in Portugal, as well as several Italian teams including Roma and Lazio.\n\nHis most high-profile position was as the first foreigner to manage England’s national squad.\n\nDuring his spell, he took England to the World Cup quarter-finals in 2002, where they were knocked out by Brazil.\n\nThey also made the last eight four years later where Portugal came out on top in a penalty shoot-out in a game where Wayne Rooney was sent off after a clash with his then Manchester United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nEriksson led England to the last eight of the 2004 Euros where Portugal also knocked them out in another penalty shoot-out.\n\nHe left the England job in 2006 after five years in charge.\n\nHis time in the hotseat had seen a memorable 5-1 win over Germany in a World Cup qualifier but also controversy over his personal life.\n\n“This is a very sad day. He gave all England fans such special memories,” Mark Bullingham, CEO of England’s Football Association, said in a statement.\n\n“Sven will be rightly recognized and forever remembered for his significant work with the England team, and for his wider contribution to the game,” Bullingham continued.\n\nEriksson went on to manage Mexico, Ivory Coast and the Philippines, but never his native Sweden’s national squad.\n\nIn March, Eriksson fulfilled what he said had been a life-long dream of managing English football club Liverpool.\n\nAlongside former Liverpool favorites Ian Rush, John Barnes and John Aldridge in the home dug-out, he managed Liverpool Legends in a charity match against Ajax Legends, overseeing a 4-2 win for his team.\n\nEriksson said afterwards he had shed tears before kick-off, when he received a standing ovation from the crowd as he walked out onto the pitch, with fans singing the Liverpool anthem of ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’.\n\n“That will be a huge memory in life,” said Eriksson said. “Absolutely beautiful.”\n\nRiyadh: People are more likely to invest in things they feel connected to, according to the founder and president of Works Collective, Nate Morley, speaking on a panel titled “Cultural Crossroads in Games” on the second day of the New Global Sport Conference in Riyadh.\n\nThe panel brought together creative professionals from diverse fields, including entertainment, art, and fashion. They explored the impact of cultural influence on creative industries and emphasized the need to balance cultural authenticity with commercial success.\n\nJe Alipio, director and head of business development at Walt Disney Co. for APAC & MENA, discussed how Disney innovates while maintaining the integrity of its beloved characters and stories.\n\n“It’s really about finding the right partner,” he said, noting that collaborating with like-minded creatives who bring fresh ideas can unlock many opportunities.\n\nAlipio also outlined two approaches to business collaboration: a top-down method, where Disney enters a partner’s space to inform or influence it, and a bottom-up approach, where partners are empowered to expand their ideas on a larger scale under Disney’s guidance.\n\nKhaled Makhshoush, a Saudi artist specializing in digital pixel art, began his career inspired by video games. He discussed the cultural elements featured in his work and how he draws inspiration from his surroundings. “You start to see things — the places you grow up in, the city … that’s the main source of cultural inspiration.”\n\nMakhshoush noted that when creating an image, his focus is not on accuracy but on conveying emotion. By “breaking it down and then rebuilding it” based on his interpretation, he fosters a connection between personal and cultural elements.\n\nIn discussing how to create culturally authentic gaming experiences, Morley remarked: “One of the worst things you can do is to be a cultural appropriator.”\n\nHe elaborated that while fostering a platform that invites people to contribute and expand ie-spdeas is valuable, appropriating elements from other cultures and using them as your own is problematic.\n\nMorley stressed that collaboration and diversity are key to elevating a brand. He said that within a single brand framework, one can showcase a multitude of voices in various ways, adding that a distinctive mix of backgrounds and industries transforms the brand from a mere “copy and paste” entity into an inclusive “platform for expression.”\n\nNicola Mizon, COO and co-founder of Kutur Runway and Vitza DGTL, discussed the increasing efforts by fashion brands to integrate into the esports sector through advanced technology. He noted that there is a growing demand for audiences “to look their best.\n\n“We want to create a fashion gaming platform that’s at the intersection of technology, commerce, and games and bring everyone together to celebrate the art of fashion in the digital space,” he said.\n\nThis involves engaging in discussions with local designers and creators to understand their needs for a gaming platform that allows them to feel celebrated and unrestricted in their creative expression, such as crafting innovative concepts like “dresses made of fire.”\n\nExpanding the discussion on integrating fashion within both cultural and digital contexts, Reem Al-Kanhal, fashion designer and creative director of brand Reem AlKanhal, said: “Fashion is connected to everything.”\n\nAl-Kanhal emphasized that, given the extensive time newer generations spend online, it is crucial to integrate cultural elements — such as traditional wardrobes and national landmarks — into games for the sake of cultural preservation.\n\nShe concluded: “I think (that) owning your story is your power,” highlighting its significance for personal ambition and maintaining cultural connections.\n\nPARIS: Paris has chosen the iconic Champs-Elysees avenue and the historic Place de la Concorde to host the opening ceremony for the Summer Paralympics on Wednesday.\n\nThe prestigious avenue sweeping through the 8th arrondissement to the west of central Paris is dotted with cafes, palaces and luxury shops and connects the Arc de Triomphe in the west with Place de la Concorde in the east in a single straight line.\n\nTens of thousands of people daily throng the two-kilometer-(one mile)-long tree-lined artery with its wide sidewalks.\n\nIt has long been for French a place of celebrations and popular gatherings.\n\nIt was there in 1960 that American actress Jean Seberg appeared in Jean-Luc Godard’s legendary new wave film “Breathless” selling copies of the New York Herald Tribune.\n\nOn Wednesday it will be the scene of a popular parade, open to everyone and involving up to more than 180 delegations and 4,400 para-olympians from around the world.\n\nFrance has celebrated two football World Cup victories there, the traditional military parade on July 14, the Bastille Day national holiday, and the Tour de France cycle race ends there.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Parisians and tourists gather there to celebrate New Year’s Eve.\n\nOnce fields and fallow land, the avenue started to take shape when Louis XIV’s city planner first linked the Louvre to the Tuileries Garden in the mid-17th century.\n\nAt one end of the avenue is the Arc de Triomphe, commissioned by French Emperor Napoleon which now honors France’s war dead, and was inaugurated in 1836.\n\nFrance’s WWII leader General Charles de Gaulle, chose it, of course, for his triumphant return from exile on Aug. 26, 1944, after the Liberation of Paris from the Nazis.\n\nHowever, the prestigious thoroughfare has known scenes of unrest. Police used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon when “yellow vest” anti-government protesters in 2018 attacked the Arc de Triomphe, and ransacked shops.\n\nHowever, with stores and historic cinemas closing along the avenue due to rising rents and falling sales, locals have gradually abandoned the Champs-Elysees over concerns that it is too noisy, dirty and expensive.\n\nWith Paris’ other famous symbol the Eiffel Tower looming just across the River Seine, the name is the French for Elysian Fields, the paradise for dead heroes in Greek mythology.\n\nAt the other end, the Place de la Concorde, the largest square in Paris, will be the scene of the official parade for ticket holders, in addition to the protocol and artistic sequences.\n\nThe square has a bloody past: Then known as “Place de la Revolution” it was a place of execution and heads rolled (literally) there during the French Revolution.\n\nKing Louis XVI and his wife Marie-Antoinette were famously guillotined there in 1793 during the Reign of Terror that followed the 1789 Revolution.\n\nIt was renamed Concorde after the July Revolution of 1830.\n\nToday the elegant paved square by the Seine is defined by its huge obelisk, one of a pair originally erected by Ramses II outside the temple in Luxor in Egypt in the 13th century BC. It was gifted to Paris in 1830."
