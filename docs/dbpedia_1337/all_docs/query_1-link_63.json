        "text": "Inter Milan, the Champions of Italy, played its first match preparing for the new football season with a friendly against the Swiss side Lugano. This match marked the start of the season for Inter and took place behind closed doors in Appiano Gentile. Team Melli center forward who recently signed for Inter Milan was a starter for the friendly match.\n\nInter gave debut of some other signings in this match. Beside Taremi, the Spanish goalkeeper Martinez experienced his first game in an Inter shirt. Both the new arrivals are eagerly awaited and are expected to play an important role in the team in the coming season.\n\nInter did not take long to score through Joaquin Correa in the 12th minute. Lugano, however, bounced back with two quick goals in a matter of five minutes both scored by Kacper Przybylko with a penalty lick in the 20th minute and then scoring on the 25th to put his club ahead 2-1. That was indeed the result of the first half.\n\nIn the second half, Mehdi Taremi scored the equalizer in the 59th minute. It was his first goal for the Nerazzurri. It came from the penalty spot, in the second half of the friendly. Taremi stepped up to the penalty spot and scored the goal that made it 2-2 for the Nerazzurri in the match against the Swiss club. Shortly after, Taremi made it 3-2 with a splendid shot in front of the opposing goalkeeper. It was his first Nerazzurri brace.\n\nThe match ended 3-2 for the Italian champions with Mehdi Taremi impressing and registering the goals that Inter will be eagerly waiting from him.\n\nInter has confirmed the signing of Mehdi Taremi on a three-year contract following his departure from Porto.\n\nThe deal between Inter and the striker, who left Portugal after seeing out the end of his contract, was reached earlier this year and was confirmed after he completed his medical.\n\nTaremi made 182 appearances for Porto after joining in 2020, scoring 91 goals in all competitions.\n\nThe Iran international enjoyed a distinguished four-year spell at the club, winning the Primeira Liga, two Portuguese Super Cups, three Portuguese Cups and the Portuguese League Cup.\n\nTaremi is the third player to move to San Siro so far this transfer window, joining Piotr Zielinski and Josep Martinez at the club.\n\nThe Team Melli center forward has expressed his eight as the first Iranian player to join the Italian giants Internazionale of Milan. In his first interview in Milan, Taremi focused on helping his club win matches, score goals, and assist his teammates.\n\nStriker Mehdi Taremi will weigh a total of €5.55 million on Inter Milan’s balance sheet for the fiscal year ending next June.\n\nThis is according to Italian outlet Calcio e Finanza. The outlet does note that the commissions involved in the deal are not known, however.\n\nNow it’s official. Inter has completed the signing of Taremi on a free transfer.\n\nThe Nerazzurri confirmed the Iranian’s arrival yesterday.\n\nTaremi has arrived on a free transfer. His contract with Porto had run out at the end of last month, meaning that he left the Portuguese giants after four years and was able to join another club without a fee.\n\nInter’s propensity for free transfer signings is hardly a secret.\n\nThat is the route via which all of Hakan Calhanoglu, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Andre Onana, and Marcus Thuram have arrived at the Nerazzurri in recent seasons.\n\nAnd this summer, Taremi is not the only big name free transfer signing that Inter have made.\n\nThe Nerazzurri have also brought in Piotr Zielinski after his contract with Napoli ran out.\n\nMehdi Taremi Weighs Around €5.55M On Inter Milan Balance Sheet\n\nOf course, even without a transfer fee, it is not as though signing Taremi has cost Inter nothing.\n\nCalcio e Finanza note that the commissions involved in the deal have not been revealed. However, it is safe to say that there were some.\n\nBut in terms of the wages for the Iranian, Taremi is earning €3 million net per season.\n\nInter will not be able to apply the Growth Decree to these.\n\nIn the past, the Growth Decree would have allowed Inter to spend less on the wages of a player arriving from a foreign league like Taremi.\n\nThis would have been the result of lower taxes on the wages.\n\nHowever, the Italian government scrapped the application of the policy to football last year.\n\nAs the end of 2023/2024 season, the future prospects of Team Melli’s legionnaire players hang in the balance. Unfortunately, their performances in European leagues have been less than stellar. Let’s delve into the individual stories of these key players:\n\nMehdi Taremi\n\nIn the 2022/23 season, Taremi dazzled as a key player for FC Porto, scoring 22 goals in 33 Primeira Division games. However, last season, contract negotiations and reduced playing time dimmed his star. Porto’s head coach favored other players, and Taremi featured in only 23 league matches, netting 6 goals. His heart now beats for a move to Inter Milan, although no official contract has been announced yet.\n\nSardar Azmoun\n\nAzmoun’s loan spell at AS Roma in Serie A didn’t pan out as expected. Despite Bayer Leverkusen’s Bundesliga triumph, Azmoun played second fiddle to Lukaku and Dybala. His 23 appearances included just 3 starts, with 20 substitute roles. He found the net 3 times. AS Roma’s contract with Azmoun ends soon, and Leverkusen seeks offers—preferably an outright sale—to recoup their investment.\n\nAlireza Jahanbakhsh\n\nJahanbakhsh’s stint at Feyenoord was forgettable. In 16 Eredivisie matches, he failed to score. Starting in only 3 games, he spent most of his time as a substitute. Feyenoord has let go of the 30-year-old captain and winger. Jahanbakhsh’s agents are actively scouting West European clubs, though Turkish sides have shown interest at lower wages.\n\nSaman Ghoddos\n\nBrentford’s Premier League journey didn’t feature Ghoddos prominently. His one-year contract expires soon, and the club shows no interest in an extension. Ghoddos made 19 appearances, mostly as a substitute, but did manage a memorable goal. His versatility caught the eye, but his next destination remains uncertain. Sweden beckons, but Ghoddos hopes for a more ambitious opportunity.\n\nThe Crucible Awaits: Team Melli’s Legionnaires\n\nAs the 2023/2024 season draws its final curtain, Team Melli’s legionnaire players find themselves at a crossroads. Their lackluster performances in European leagues cast shadows over their prospects. The stakes are high—the FIFA World Cup 2026 looms on the horizon, and Iran eyes a coveted spot among the final 48 teams.\n\nThe Unyielding Challenge\n\nWhile Iran’s group isn’t insurmountable, the team’s fate hinges on its key players. Their game time and exposure to strong leagues will reverberate through every match. Can they rise to the occasion and propel Team Melli to glory?\n\nThe Race Against Time\n\nWith the 2024/25 season kicking off in August, these players face a tight schedule. Settling into new teams swiftly becomes paramount. As winter approaches, the four World Cup qualifying matches await—a litmus test for their mettle.\n\nThe arena awaits, and Team Melli’s fate hangs in the balance. Will these legionnaires seize their moment or fade into obscurity? Only time will tell.\n\nKuala Lumpur: The pain of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s semi-final exit at the AFC Asian Cup Qatar 2023™ still stings for Mehdi Taremi but, as the striker tells the-AFC.com, he is choosing to look towards the future; to his impending move to Serie A giants Inter Milan and to what he hopes will be another FIFA World Cup Finals appearance.\n\nNo nation knows semi-final heartbreak at the AFC Asian Cup quite like IR Iran; on seven occasions since 1976 – the most recent of the country’s three consecutive continental titles – Team Melli have fallen one hurdle before the tournament’s deciding match.\n\nThe latest loss remains fresh in the mind of Mehdi Taremi, the talismanic striker whose goals in recent years have been one of the drivers of his country’s qualification for the last two FIFA World Cup Finals, but who continue to fall short of a fourth AFC Asian Cup.\n\nThe 3-2 defeat to hosts Qatar – the defending champions who would go on to retain the title – in February hurt so much that Taremi has refused to watch reruns of the game and shies away from discussing the defeat.\n\n“After the Qatar game, I never saw the game and I haven’t talked until now about that game,” he tells the-AFC.com. “I don’t want to look back and think about the past.\n\n“We’re always thinking about what is in front of us. We’re looking forward to the next step and who we are going to play against.\n\n“It’s still painful. I think we deserved to win the Asian Cup. We created a lot of chances there, we missed a lot of chances but that’s football.”\n\nMissing scoring opportunities is not a characteristic often associated with Taremi. The 31-year-old hit a hat-trick against Hong Kong, China earlier this month to record his 48th goal in 804 matches as he continued his long-standing run of form for Iran.\n\nIt is his ability in front of goal that has seen Taremi establish himself among the leading scorers in European club football since his move to Portugal to join Rio Ave from Al Gharafa in Qatar before a subsequent move to Porto, where he has spent the last four seasons.\n\nTaremi’s time on the Iberian peninsula, however, has come to an end with the expiration of his contract with the Estadio de Dragao-based club, and a new adventure in Italy with Inter Milan awaits.\n\n“That five years, it has created this Mehdi,” he says of his time in Portugal, where he scored 112 times in 217 games in all competitions.\n\n“I have become a more experienced guy, I have become a more professional guy and all of those people who have helped me there I appreciate all of those guys, the staff the players at Rio Ave club and at Porto as well. They have created this Mehdi.\n\n“When you play in Asia and in Europe it’s completely different. There you have to be more professional, otherwise you cannot play at a high level.\n\n“In Asia you have to too, but how they play there is faster and quicker and the games are at a higher level. When you play in the UEFA Champions League you have to be ready, you have to play against big players, big teams and that has made me different.”\n\nTaremi’s ability in front of goal led to significant speculation over his next destination and, while the rumour mill generated talk of numerous possibilities, it was the newly crowned Italian champions who won the battle for his signature.\n\nIt is a move the Bushehr-born forward is relishing as it presents him with another opportunity to feature once more in the UEFA Champions League.\n\n“Inter has a strong team and from what I’ve seen on the TV the players are friendly, the team are strong and they are compact, together,” he says.\n\n“I think there is a good feeling there between the players and the coaches. Inter is a big club and because of that I chose Inter. I want to play in Italy, I want to show myself there too.\n\n“Since I was seven, eight years old I saw a lot of games in Italy, Spain, England, everywhere. When you watch the games you’re a supporter of the big clubs and Inter is one of those. I remember many things of Inter in the UEFA Champions League, in the league and the history of Inter and that makes me happy to go there. It convinced me to go there.\n\n“My goal is to help the team as I can. I’ll try to do my job, scoring and assists. So let’s see what’s going to happen.”\n\nWhile Taremi will be adjusting to his new surroundings at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza – better known around the world as San Siro – he will also be attempting to ensure Iran qualify for another FIFA World Cup finals.\n\nHaving failed to score in his first FIFA World Cup appearance in Russia in 2018, Taremi was twice on target at Qatar 2022 against England and his aim is to improve on that tally in the Canada, Mexico and United States edition in 2026.\n\n“I always try to think about football and about my future,” he says. “I put a lot of effort each day into my job.\n\n“The main goal is, first of all we have to go to the World Cup, and then my main goal is I have to try my best to score more than two goals at the next World Cup. So let’s see.”\n\nSoft spot-kick turns the tide for Iran in the Fifa World Cup qualifier, but Hong Kong shows guts with new boys Timmy Ma and Anthony Pinto on target\n\nPaul McNamara+ FOLLOW\n\n6 Jun 2024\n\nHong Kong football christened two new heroes on Thursday night, but Wolfgang Luisser’s first game in temporary charge ended in a controversial 4-2 World Cup qualifying defeat at home to Iran.\n\nTimmy Ma Hei-wai adeptly swept home a cross from Tan Chun-lok after 15 minutes of his senior international debut. Anthony Pinto was even quicker off the mark, dispatching a low effort past Payam Niazmand only two minutes after replacing Ma in the second half.\n\nMa’s stunning introduction was sandwiched by a pair of penalties from Mehdi Taremi, the second awarded after Yapp Hung-fai appeared to legally dispossess the striker in the box.\n\nTaremi, on the verge of a transfer from FC Porto to Inter Milan, chipped in a Panenka kick before completing a hat-trick 11 minutes after half-time. But Pinto, released by English League One club Bolton Wanderers, soon fired home to give Hong Kong hope.\n\nSardar Azmoun finally killed off the hosts when he escaped the attention of Leon Jones to slip home Iran’s fourth with 25 minutes left.\n\nThere were no complaints about the first penalty. Jones, another full Hong Kong debutant, used his arm to block a floated 11th-minute cross from Mehdi Ghayedi. Taremi ignored the howls to place his penalty into the bottom-left corner.\n\nThere was a 137-position gulf between the teams in the Fifa world rankings, but after a slow start, the hosts gave as good as they got on a stirring night at Hong Kong Stadium.\n\nThey had an early let-off when Helio Goncalves deflected a Taremi strike onto the crossbar. Iran sustained the attack, and Azmoun’s volley had Yapp tumbling to his left to tip behind.\n\nHong Kong’s anemic opening gave way to a gutsy, ambitious performance, sparked when Tan stole possession on the quarter-hour. The midfielder was allowed to progress down the left and measure a delivery to the near post, where Ma arrived from the opposite flank to steer a finish across goalkeeper Niazmand.\n\nEastern attacker Ma was so far out of the international reckoning until recently that he did not make the squad for the under-23s’ Asian Games campaign last September.\n\nYapp needed a strong hand to beat out an effort from Azmoun, but Iran’s discomfort was laid bare when Amin Hazbavi sliced a panicked clearance past a post.\n\nThe visitors were given a break, however, when Qasim Matar Al-Hatmi, the referee, awarded a spot-kick for a foul by Yapp. The goalkeeper seemed to make clean contact with the ball as he dived at Taremi’s feet in the 32nd minute, but Hong Kong’s protests were waved away.\n\nBefore kick-off, the home fans had hoisted a banner emblazoned with images of Jorn Andersen, accompanied by the words “thank you”, in tribute to the Norwegian, who last week resigned as head coach.\n\nAnd their backing created a wall of noise throughout as their team, in keeping with the progress made under Andersen, battled to recover from Taremi’s second penalty. Songs stuck in the throats of most of the 9,992 crowd when the dead-eyed Taremi angled a sidefooted shot into the corner to claim the match ball.\n\nPinto pounced on ponderous efforts to clear and caressed a first-time left-foot shot inside Niazmand’s right post, but Azmoun extinguished any comeback hopes. This was a night, however, that will be recalled for Luisser’s impressive first audition for the job, and the birth of two new Hong Kong stars.\n\nIran’s national football team, represented by Mehdi Taremi, the esteemed striker, voiced poignant reflections following their commanding 5-0 triumph over Turkmenistan. Taremi remarked, “We’ve lacked the necessary infrastructure to ascend to championship levels. Iranian football appears to be regressing.”\n\nIn the aftermath of their resounding victory, Taremi elaborated on the match’s dynamics, stating, “It was a highly satisfying game. Our performance reflected our ability to create numerous goal-scoring opportunities throughout both halves. We could have easily netted more goals, underscoring our determination to delight our fans.”\n\nExpressing gratitude to the fervent supporters at Azadi Stadium, he added, “The unwavering support from our fans served as a driving force, spurring us to elevate our game.”\n\nResponding to expectations regarding World Cup qualification and progression from the group stages, Taremi adopted a pragmatic outlook, remarking, “In football, especially at this level, nothing is guaranteed. The influx of new players adds complexity to our preparations, presenting formidable challenges. Qualification is a step-by-step process, and our focus remains on delivering our best performances in each game.”\n\nAssuming the role of captain against Turkmenistan, Taremi underscored the team’s collective journey, stating, “We’re a cohesive unit, having embarked on this journey with Team Melli together. As elder statesmen within the team, we aim to foster unity and success, striving to bring joy to our supporters.”\n\nAddressing the inclusion of young talents in the national squad, Taremi acknowledged the inevitable learning curve, noting, “Our young players possess immense potential, albeit with some inconsistencies in training, which is normal. The coaching staff meticulously selects players based on their capabilities, recognizing their potential contributions.”\n\nReflecting on past disappointments, particularly the AFC Asian Cup 2023 semi-final loss to Qatar, Taremi emphasized a forward-looking mentality, asserting, “I prefer not to dwell on past setbacks. Our focus is solely on upcoming challenges and striving for continuous improvement.”\n\nExpressing gratitude for the robust fan turnout despite adverse weather conditions, Taremi acknowledged the competitive landscape in football, stating, “Today’s matches in the qualifying rounds of FIFA World Cup in Asia, demonstrated the unpredictability of football, even against perceived weaker opponents. We must consistently give our best effort, recognizing the evolving nature of the sport.”\n\nRegarding facilities and support for Iranian football, Taremi highlighted existing shortcomings, stating, “Our facilities have not been conducive to achieving championship glory, contributing to lowered expectations. Sustainable success necessitates more than passion and resilience; it requires structured development, financial backing, and effective administration. We possess the potential; now, we require comprehensive solutions to propel Iranian football to greater heights.”"
