Amidst the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, though the stands were devoid of spectators, the passion for the game burned brighter than ever. On the second matchday of the Concacaf Futsal Championship, the U.S. Futsal National Team showcased their prowess, securing a 4-2 victory over Nicaragua. This triumph, coupled with El Salvador's earlier win against Cuba, propelled the USA to the top of Group D as they brace for a showdown against Cuba in the group finale.Under the strategic guidance of former head coach Dusan Jakica, the USA fielded a dynamic line-up, with Diego Moretti guarding the goalpost. From the onset, the USA asserted dominance, with Luciano Gonzalez orchestrating the opening goal, expertly setting up Jeremy Klepal for a clinical finish past Nicaragua's goalkeeper Alejandro Sequeira. The momentum continued in the USA's favour, with Eduardo Buenfil doubling the lead with a precise strike from outside the arc, setting the stage for a commanding halftime advantage. In the second half, Zach Reget's persistence paid off, leading to Klepal's second goal of the day, a testament to the team's relentless attacking prowess. However, Nicaragua displayed resilience, clawing back with goals from Bryan Corea and Patrick Luna, taking advantage of a temporary numerical advantage after Buenfil's red card. Diego Moretti's heroics between the posts ensured the USA maintained their lead, culminating in Tomas Pondeca's decisive goal, securing the team's first victory in the Concacaf Futsal Championship since 2012. As the USA geared up for the group finale against Cuba, the team remained poised to secure a spot in the tournament quarterfinals, with various scenarios in play, contingent upon results from other matches.

And this was three points that the United States desperately needed in their quest to advance on to the knockout stages of this competition. Nicaragua got the first win in their history yesterday, but the scoring started early. Jeremy Klefbom one of his two goals today for the United States on the assist from Lucho Gonzalez. And then later on Eduardo Bueno. Phil. He would get his first goal before he then got a red card, but this would make it 2 nil to the United States and at halftime, that's what the scoreline. Was in favor of the Americans. Come the 2nd 20 minutes they would just look to see this game out. They would test Rudy Rodriguez and goal. I see Y'all would have a couple of chances trying to follow up his. Beautiful goal from yesterday. And then with the injury to the goalkeeper, there would be a change for just a few moments. But look at this play by Zach Raggett, keeping it in deflected cross, but Jeremy Koeppel would find his brace. Complete hustle play from Zachary, get just to keep that alive and find Klepp ball that made it 3 nil and you thought that might be enough for the United States to see it out. Ultimately it was, but Nicaragua would still have their moments as they would find two goals in this latter part of the second-half, forcing more saves at him already who came back after the injury. But this was the first goal from Brian Correa with the outside of the left foot, They're part of me with the right foot just sending the goalkeeper. The wrong way, bringing it onto his right foot. And just a little lane to shoot. I don't think Moretti knew much about that. And once again it was creating downs, creating all sorts of havoc for the United States. And then it was Patrick Luna scoring the second goal of the day. That made it 3-2. And you thought Nicaragua could maybe find another one, forcing Moretti into more and more saves. That one nearly slipped by him and so did this, but Moretti stood strong in net once again. And then it was coast to coast once again. Second straight day Moretti gets an assist. This time to Tomas Pond, Deca was able to head at home. That made it 4-2, and that was surely enough for the United States on the day for two winners and all three points here on Match Day #2.\n\nTo view or add a comment, sign in"
