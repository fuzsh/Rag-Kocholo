        "text": "The defending champions produced a dominant performance, taking a five-goal lead in the first half with strikes from Ahmed Esmaeilpour, Ali Asghar Hassanzadeh and Hossein Tayebi.\n\nThailand’s Jirawat Sornwichian found one back but further goals from Mahdi Javid and Mohammad Shajari, sealed a comprehensive win for Iran.\n\nIran took the lead just 10 seconds into the match with Hassanzadeh’s long range pass finding Esmaeilpour, who made no mistake with a left-footed shot.\n\nIt was just the beginning for the title holders as Esmaeilpour scored his second in the fourth minute when he intercepted a pass and surged down the middle, before hitting home.\n\nHassanzadeh turned goalscorer less than 30 seconds after the restart from a set-play, tapping the ball in from close range, before Tayebi made it 4-0 in the sixth minute, courtesy of Farhad Tavakoli’s swift pass.\n\nASEAN champions Thailand’s first real chance came in the 10th minute with Madyalan aiming for the top left but Ali Reze Samimi palmed the the ball away.\n\nThailand conceded again in the 17th minute with Tayebi’s superb ground shot to the bottom right corner.\n\nThere was to be no respite for the Southeast Asians as Javid etched his name on the scoresheet two minutes into the second half, but Thailand’s five-men assault team avoided a whitewash with Sornwichian finding the back of the net moments later.\n\nShajari restored Iran’s six-goal lead in the 25th minute with a simple tap in, and as Thailand piled on the pressure in search of goals, they were hit again.\n\nTayebi completed his hat-trick in the 36th minute, before Shajari struck the final goal of the match.\n\nIran will face the winners of the Vietnam-Uzbekistan quarter-final, which will be played later on Thursday.\n\nMohammed Nazemasharieh: Iran Head Coach\n\n“There were some good reasons for our win. Firstly, we had a meeting with our players, because we weren’t satisfied with their performance against Iraq and told them to have better concentration. And we also analysed Thailand’s performance in this and other tournaments. Thailand have been one of the best teams in Asia, and have been one of Iran’s rivals since 20 years ago, and we really respect them. I will say it again, the Iranian team play with our hearts. We have a vision, it started in 2016 Colombia. We started with some new players, and are aiming for the 2020 FIFA Futsal World Cup. We aren’t only representatives of Iran in that competition, but of Asia as well. Whatever way we can improve, we will try to reach there.”\n\nJose Maria Pazos: Thailand Head Coach\n\n“There was no game. Once they scored the first goal in the opening seconds, it was over. It was important to keep the concentration, but we lost that in the first few minutes after conceding three goals in four minutes. The score reflects our performance. Maybe our mental preparation was not there, and making one mistake after another against Iran meant it’s over. We showed two faces in this tournament, our really good and bad. We showed today that we are not ready to face a team like Iran. Now we must analyse what was the problem here. We need to know why we have two faces, and find a stable level. This tournament is the first tournament for some of our players, and the last for some, and we need to fix the problems we have in this tournament, ahead of 2020.”\n\nPhotos: AFC\n\nIRAN\n\nBest finish: Champions – 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2016\n\nHow they qualified: Group B winners (South & Central Zones)\n\nFIFA Ranking: 5\n\nDefending champions Iran are the favourites to lift the title again in Chinese Taipei as Mohammad Nazemosharia’s side prepare to open their defence against Myanmar on Feb 2.\n\nTeam Melli, who won the Asian Indoors in Ashgabat last year, beating Uzbekistan 7-1 in the final, topped their group during qualification as they maintained a perfect record beating Afghanistan 8-2 and Tajikistan 12-2.\n\nAhead of the Finals, Iran beat Belarus 5-0 and 2-1 in Tehran.
