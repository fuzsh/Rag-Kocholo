        "text": "Alexis Sanchez, Chile\n\nChilean forward Alexis Sanchez single-handedly humiliated England last year, scoring both goals in the country's 2-0 rout at Wembley Stadium. Barcelona paid around $35 million for Sanchez back in 2011, but his market value has gone up since. If Sanchez can shine for Chile this Cup, expect the likes of Manchester United and Liverpool to come calling.\n\nAndrea Pirlo, Italy\n\nSuperathletes dominate modern soccer, but there are still some old-school artists and none has a finer touch than Italian star Andrea Pirlo, called \"The Professor,\" whose pinpoint deliveries can make purists sigh with delight. The title of his best-selling autobiography, released this year, nicely sums up his cerebral approach to the game: I Think, Therefore I Play. Pirlo's serious, bearded mug is the face of Italy's 2014 campaign and is plastered on television, magazines and billboards across the country.\n\nNeymar, Brazil\n\nSo famous around the world that he is known just by his first name, Neymar was ranked the sixth-best player in the world by The Guardian in December 2013. The 22-year-old's endorsement deals include Nike, Volkswagen and Panasonic, and he appears on the cover of Red Bull's current The Red Bulletin magazine, where he revealed that when Brazil last won the World Cup in 2002: \"I was 10, so I understood football. I woke up before dawn to watch the final at home. I even had Ronaldo’s haircut.\" After just the first match against Croatia in the 2014 World Cup, he had already scored two goals to help lead Brazil to victory.\n\nAntonio Valencia, Ecuador\n\nAs a winger for Manchester United, Antonio Valencia was named \"Man of the Match\" when his assist to Wayne Rooney's winning goal secured the team the 2010 League Cup Final title. He has since been given the honor of wearing the team's No. 7 jersey, following in the footsteps of legendary United players including George Best, Eric Cantona, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nWayne Rooney, England\n\nWayne Rooney's new four-year contract with Manchester United could net England's star striker $104 million. His abrasive personality on and off the field has probably hurt his endorsements (though he has plenty – from Nike and Ford to Coke and Electronic Arts), but Rooney's 8.8 million Twitter and 20 million Facebook fans don't seem to care.\n\nArjen Robben, The Netherlands\n\nArjen Robben's lightning speed and finishing ability (they call him \"the Bomber\" for his precision in hitting the net) make him a talent to watch at this year's Cup. But the Bayern Munich star, who has sponsorship deals with Adidas and Hugo Boss, is also a notorious flopper and has as many enemies as he has fans.\n\nAshkan Dejagah, Iran\n\nAshkan Dejagah is truly global, being an Iranian-German player for a London club (Fulham). \"I know there are not as many Iranians playing in 'big' leagues now. … I was luckier, growing up in Germany, but not many scouts go to Iran to watch games,\" he told The Guardian, adding that he hopes the World Cup shows everyone how good Iran's team is.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo, Portugal\n\nIn a World Cup packed with stars, Cristiano Ronaldo is a supernova. Portugal's midfielder is the full package: massive talent, movie-star good looks and power couple cred thanks to Russian supermodel girlfriend Irina Shayk. Ronaldo ranks as the world's most marketable soccer player, has 26.6 million fans on Twitter and a truckload of endorsement deals, for everything from Nike and Samsung to Emirates airline and Herbalife. He also has his own CR7 brand of undies. Perhaps it was fate this his father named him after that champion of free enterprise, Ronald Reagan.\n\nEdin Dzeko, Bosnia & Herzegovina\n\nAs a striker for Manchester City, Edin Dzeko is a member of the current Premier League championship team and was named Bosnian Footballer of the Year three years in a row. Originally from Sarajevo, he became Bosnia's first UNICEF ambassador in 2009 and has since visited schools and children in his home country who were affected by the Bosnian War.\n\nGeorgios Samaras, Greece\n\nThe 6-foot-4 striker Georgios Samaras is pretty much Greece's only chance of scoring at this year's World Cup. The long-haired point man, who plays for top Scottish side Celtic, has had more than 70 caps for his country and scored the goal against Croatia that qualified Greece for the the 2012 European Cup.\n\nJames Rodriguez, Colombia\n\nJames Rodriguez was named the 40th–most-valuable player in the 2014 World Cup, priced at $43.6 million, according to a study by Pluri Consulting, and is considered to be one of the rising stars on the global soccer stage. The 22-year-old has been dubbed a successor to Colombian icon Carlos Valderrama and has earned the nickname \"El Nuevo Pibe,\" meaning \"The New Kid.\"\n\nJoel Campbell, Costa Rica\n\nJoel Campbell, 21, was signed by Arsenal in 2011 but was then loaned out to a number of other European clubs after facing issues getting a U.K. visa. While expected to be one of the emerging talents in Brazil this World Cup, his career has already been marred by accusations of unsportsmanlike behavior.\n\nKarim Benzema, France\n\nWith Franck Ribery, France's other star forward, out injured, the hopes of Les Bleus rest on Karim Benzema's ample shoulders. The former French Player of the Year is reportedly demanding that his club, Real Madrid, double his salary to more than $12 million if they want him to stay on after next year.\n\nKeisuke Honda, Japan\n\nFamous for his free kicks and dribbling skills, Keisuke Honda is no stranger to international soccer as a member of the Milan squad and a star of Japan’s 2010 World Cup team. A household name and a hero in his home country, the bleach-blond 27-year-old said that he is approaching this World Cup as \"if it is his last\" because for every player, \"there is no guarantee there will be another.\"\n\nLionel Messi, Argentina\n\nAt just 26, Lionel Messi has been named possibly \"the best soccer player ever,\" and in May, Forbes ranked him the second-highest-paid player after Cristiano Ronaldo with earnings of $65 million in the previous 12 months. Messi is a brand ambassador for Turkish Airlines (appearing in commercials with Kobe Bryant) and earns $20 million a year from sponsors including Adidas, PepsiCo, Gillette and Electronic Arts.\n\nLuis Suarez, Uruguay\n\nSparking headlines on and off the pitch — most notably after biting a Chelsea defender during a match — Luis Suarez earned an estimated $10.5 million in 2013 and signed a $65 million deal with Liverpool in December, making him one of the highest-paid soccer players in the world. The controversial 27-year-old, who is a spokesperson for 888poker.com, was also fined $67,000 and given an eight-game suspension for racially abusing a rival player.\n\nMesut Ozil, Germany\n\nArsenal shelled out a (for the club) record $65 million to pick up creative German midfielder Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid. His 19.9 million Facebook fans are more than top German clubs Bayern Munich, Shalke and Borussia Dortmund combined. Among his many endorsements, Ozil is the face of Adidas' Predator cleats, part of a seven-year, $35 million deal with the German sportswear giant.\n\nMichael Essien, Ghana\n\nNicknamed \"the Bison\" for his tough tackling style, Michael Essien currently plays for Milan as a midfielder who can also play defender. After missing the 2010 World Cup in South Africa because of an injury, the 31-year-old made the current squad saying: \"I am delighted to be back with the Black Stars. I am coming here to give off my best for the country.\"\n\nOribe Peralta, Mexico\n\nWinner of the 2013 Concacaf Player of the Year award, Oribe Peralta signed a deal to be an ambassador for the 5-Hour Energy brand in March. Despite a slow start to his professional career, Peralta scored both of his team's goals during the 2012 Olympic match against Brazil to help Mexico win its first Olympic gold medal.\n\nRoger Espinoza, Honduras\n\nAfter playing in the MLS since 2008, Roger Espinoza represented Honduras in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London and joined British team Wigan Athletic last year. \"It’s a great place to learn the physicality of the game, the techniques of the game and the tactics of the game,\" the former Sporting Kansas City player said of the MLS.\n\nSamuel Eto’o, Camaroon\n\nCameroonian striker Samuel Eto'o also holds a Spanish passport and used to play for European superclub Barcelona, where he scored 100 goals in five seasons. As the most decorated African player of all time, having won the African Footballer of the Year award a record four times, he is sponsored by Puma and Ford.\n\nSofiane Feghouli, Algeria\n\nFrench-Algerian winger Sofiane Feghouli is eligible to play for both countries, but in 2011 he made a request to FIFA to switch from France to Algeria. While he is sometimes criticized for not scoring enough, the speedy player is admired for creating goal opportunities for his teammates.\n\nSon Heung-min, South Korea\n\nStriker Son Heung-Min is described as a lethal finisher, a skill that has helped his international career as well as earned him a five-year contract at German club Bayer Leverkusen. Son made the surprising decision not to play for South Korea in the 2012 Olympics, instead choosing to remain with his then-team, Hamburg.\n\nTim Cahill and Mile Jedinak, Australia\n\nTim Cahill is currently a member of the MLS' New York Red Bulls, but previously played for Everton in the Premier League. In 2006 against Japan, he became the first Australian player to ever score a World Cup goal — and then topped it off with a second in the same match! Meanwhile, Mile Jedinak also has a Premier League pedigree with Crystal Palace, and led the league in tackles and intercepts this year, having played every minute of every game except the last one of the season.\n\nTim Howard and Clint Dempsey, U.S.A.\n\nWith Landon Donovan off the U.S. roster, the mantle has been handed to Clint Dempsey (right) and Tim Howard (left). Dempsey currently plays for the Seattle Sounders following a stint in London with Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur, he's also an aspiring rapper and was featured on the song \"Don't Tread\" in the Nike campaign for the 2006 World Cup. Goalkeeper for the U.S. national team and Everton, Howard was even drafted by the Harlem Globetrotters to play basketball in 2009 — making him and Messi the only soccer players to ever receive that honor.\n\nVincent Enyeama and Ejike Uzoenyi, Nigeria\n\nNigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama also plays for Lille FC and was named the best African player in French Ligue 1 football for 2013-14. During the 2010 South Africa World Cup, he was also credited by Argentinian World Cup hero and coach Maradona as being the reason that Messi was unable to score a goal (ultimately, Argentina won the Group B matchup 1-0). Teammate Ejike Uzoenyi has also earned his stripes, having been named MVP of the 2014 African Nations Championship.\n\nXherdan Shaqiri, Switzerland\n\nFor communal Switzerland, the team is the star. But the Swiss have one out-and-out VIP in the form of Xherdan Shaqiri, an explosive, powerful striker who could be this year's come-from-nowhere discovery of the World Cup. Liverpool is reportedly looking to pay around $25 million to pry Shaqiri away from current club Bayern Munich.\n\nYaya Touré, Ivory Coast\n\nThe Manchester City midfielder scored 20 goals in the team’s Premier League-winning 2013-14 season. After receiving treatment for a thigh injury, he is now said to be fighting fit. He recently proved he hasn't forgotten his Ivory Coast roots, signing an endorsement deal with Puma that included distributing the brand's gear to underprivileged African children."
