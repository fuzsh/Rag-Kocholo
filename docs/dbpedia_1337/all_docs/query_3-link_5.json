Yehuda Wegman, March 19, 2004\n\nThe halt in attacks by Hamas from September 2003 to January 2004 was the direct result of the threat to the lives of the group’s leadership after an unceasing series of air attacks. This proved once again the validity of Israel’s traditional security doctrine, that requires those in charge to apply force – the IDF – to provide defense together with achieving a decision as rapidly as possible against any type of war that may be waged against the State of Israel.

From Iran’s standpoint, the region had been ignited too early, before its nuclear program was ready. Any end to the war that does not involve Hizballah’s disarmament will enable the jihadist movement to rise again like a phoenix, rehabilitate itself, and continue its jihad against Israel.

No geographical area in the world has sustained such a large quantity of rocket strikes since the Iran-Iraq war in the early 1980s. On most occasions, the rocket warhead contained anti-personnel munitions, a mixture of explosives and steel balls or fragments that were lethal to all those caught outside.

Lebanese and international forces will do little to ensure security and will end up as a cover for ongoing Hizballah operations, hampering Israel’s freedom of movement. Hizballah will neither disarm nor redeploy from the south.

Gleis, December 1, 2006\n\nIn responding forcefully to Hizballah’s provocation in the summer of 2006, Israel not only restored much of its deterrent capability, but did so against a weapon of the Iranian and Syrian militaries.

It is that we are not suckers and we are not going to make the same mistake again. We are not going to put ourselves in danger if it is not necessary. We unilaterally retreated from Lebanon and didn’t retaliate for six years, and in the end we found Hizbullah in a stronger position to fight against us. When Israel retreated from Gaza what was the result? More Kassam rockets on Sderot and Ashkelon. Read More »\n\ntop\n\nIsrael’s Deterrence after the Second Lebanon War\n\nMaj.-Gen. (res.) Uzi Dayan, February 13, 2007\n\nThe Islamic fundamentalist war against Israeli and Jewish existence in the Middle East – which is being waged by both Hizbullah and Hamas – did not begin in 1967, and it is not going to end even if Israel redeploys along the 1967 lines. Hardly anybody in Israel thinks that if we give territories now, we will get peace in return.

Yaakov Amidror, May 7, 2007\n\nIsrael completed its unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon on May 24, 2000. It was hoped that the withdrawal would erode the legitimacy of any continuing military activity by Hizbullah, especially in Lebanon’s internal politics. Israel did not prepare for war with an enemy that was far more powerful than what it was familiar with in the past.

The widespread accusation regarding disproportional use of force does not meet the test of international law that places the emphasis on intention rather than results.

Fletcher, June 18, 2009\n\nEverybody in the international arena agrees that no country should have to tolerate attacks against its territory and that it is entitled to use defensive forces to repel aggression. Article 51 of the UN Charter enshrines the principle of self-defense. If we tolerate missile attacks upon our territory, then we surrender our dignity as an independent entity in the international arena.

Israel should favor the lives of its own soldiers over the lives of the well-warned neighbors of a terrorist when it is operating in a territory that it does not effectively control, because in such territories it does not bear the moral responsibility for properly separating between dangerous individuals and harmless ones.

Desmond Travers was one of the four members of the UN Fact Finding Mission that produced what is widely called the Goldstone Report. On February 2, 2010, he asserted that in the past Israeli soldiers had “taken out and deliberately shot” Irish peacekeeping forces in Southern Lebanon. Travers also stated: “We found no evidence that mosques were used to store munitions” – though Israel produced photographic proof that large amounts of weapons were stored in mosques.

Hamas, with massive aid from Iran, has acquired the Iranian Fajr-5 rocket with a range of 46.6 miles, putting Tel Aviv, Rishon LeZion, and Rehovot in striking distance. The Iranian weapons flowed through the tunnels into Gaza beneath the Egyptian border. Some of this weaponry originated in Sudan, where Iran has had a naval presence for many years.

Halevi, November 21, 2012\n\nHamas views each round of armed conflict with Israel as a stage in a long-term war of attrition. Hamas leaders hope the increasingly severe and violent outbreaks will eventually erode Israel’s resilience, while goading the masses toward the emergence of a united military front for the liberation of Palestine.

Michael Herzog, January 21, 2013\n\nBoth in the 2008-2009 Operation Cast Lead and in the 2012 Operation Pillar of Defense, Israel’s government focused its objective on enhancing deterrence – opting for hitting the terrorists hard enough to give them an interest in a ceasefire for as long as possible – rather than dismantling Gaza’s terror infrastructure or toppling the Hamas government. R Read More »\n\ntop\n\nGaza War – 2014\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nFebruary 26, 2015\n\nThis is a researched and documented narrative that relates the truth as it happened. Despite the appearance of massive damage to Gaza, the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, stated that Israel had gone to “extraordinary lengths to limit collateral damage and prevent civilian casualties in the Gaza conflict.” A discerning look at the facts leads to the conclusion that Hamas, not Israel, must be tried for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\ntop\n\nPreface\n\nHirsh Goodman and Amb. Dore Gold, February 26, 2015\n\nWhile written from an Israeli perspective, this report not a document intended to negate criticism of Israel’s actions during the war or improve Israel’s image in the eyes of the world. It has but one goal: to relate a truth obfuscated by the fog of war and lost in the immediacy of reportage from the battlefield.\n\ntop\n\nIsrael’s Narrative – An Overview\n\nHirsh Goodman, February 26, 2015\n\nDespite Hamas’ cynical invocation of the victimhood in order to achieve its strategic objectives, Israel successfully focused on eliminating terror threat emanating from the strip while trying to avoid a “potential massacre.” This was a war Israel preferred to avoid and supported all efforts to end, even at the expense of sparing Hamas’ military infrastructure.\n\ntop\n\nTelling the Truth about the 2014 Gaza War\n\nAmb. Dore Gold, February 26, 2015\n\nThe 2014 Gaza war began with an outright act of aggression by Hamas: the escalation of rocket attacks on Israel’s towns and cities. But over time, a complete fabrication of the events emerged, as Hamas tried to downplay the threat to Israel, argue that Hamas had become moderate, and portray Israel as a nation dedicated to starving the Palestinian population.\n\ntop\n\nIsrael, Gaza and Humanitarian Law: Efforts to Limit Civilian Casualties\n\nLt. Col. (res.) David Benjamin, February 26, 2015\n\nThis is a brief outline of the measures adopted by Israel’s military to minimize the impact on civilians of its campaign to neutralize the rockets and terror tunnels of Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip. It should be noted that during this time, the rulers of Gaza cynically engaged in a parallel effort to maximize the exposure of their own civilians to the dangers of the conflict.\n\ntop\n\nThe Legal War: Hamas’ Crimes against Humanity and Israel’s Right to Self-Defense\n\nAmb. Alan Baker, February 26, 2015\n\nHamas’ actions, like the indiscriminate targeting of civilian population centers and deliberate exposure and use of its own civilians as human shields, are violations of international law. International law recognizes Israel’s right to self-defense, both via the UN Charter’s conventional international right of self-defense or by the international customary right to self-defense.\n\ntop\n\nThe Limits of the Diplomatic Arena\n\nAmb. Dore Gold, February 26, 2015\n\nThe 2014 Gaza war was unique in comparison to past Arab-Israeli fronts. In this conflict, Israel was engaged almost only with Hamas, a terror group that rules Gaza – not a state government. While non-state actors have recently come under the restrictions of international humanitarian law, Hamas did not see itself bound by international conventions or UN resolutions.\n\ntop\n\nHamas’ Strategy Revealed\n\nLt. Col. (ret.) Jonathan D. Halevi, February 26, 2015\n\nThe 2014 Gaza war was viewed by Hamas as a critical link in the chain of jihad and armed struggle, whose eventual goal is the Palestine’s liberation and Israel’s destruction. Destroying Israel remains Hamas’ goal and signs exist that it has adopted genocidal doctrines toward the Jewish people as a whole, beyond its militancy toward Israel.\n\ntop\n\nHamas’ Order of Battle: Weapons, Training, and Targets\n\nLenny Ben-David, February 26, 2015\n\nThroughout their 50-day war against Israel, Hamas and its terrorist allies fired more than 4,500 projectiles at Israel. Hamas’ weapons would have caused hundreds, perhaps thousands, of civilian casualties if not for Israel’s active and passive defenses. This, coupled with other dubious methods, leaves Hamas culpable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\ntop\n\nHamas’ Tunnel Network: A Massacre in the Making\n\nDaniel Rubenstein, February 26, 2015\n\nIn the past decade, Hamas methodically built a sophisticated network of tunnels that would enable its fighters to infiltrate Israel and carry out terrorist attacks and abductions on an unprecedented scale. Operation Protective Edge targeted this tunnel network, eliminating one of Hamas’ strategic assets and preventing a surprise attack behind Israel’s front lines.\n\ntop\n\nHamas’ Silent Partners\n\nLenny Ben-David, February 26, 2015\n\nToday, dozens of Palestinian, Israeli, international, and Christian organizations are engaged in the Palestinians’ campaign against Israel and are supported financially by major foundations, private donations, and even European governments. These organizations were critical to Hamas’ diplomatic front against Israel during the 2014 Gaza war.\n\ntop\n\nGazan Casualties: How Many and Who They Were\n\nLenny Ben-David, February 26, 2015\n\nFollowing the 2014 Gaza war, UN and Palestinian sources claimed that some 2,100 Palestinians in Gaza were killed, of whom 72 to 84 percent were civilians. There are strong reasons to contest these figures and argue that the percentage of Gazan civilian casualties was fewer than 50 percent.\n\ntop\n\nKey Moments in a 50-Day War: A Timeline\n\nDaniel Rubenstein, February 26, 2015\n\nThis timeline seeks to concisely summarize the critical events of the 2014 Gaza war on the military, diplomatic, and media fronts.\n\ntop\n\nIsrael’s Critical Security Requirements for Defensible Borders\n\nIsrael’s Critical Security Requirements for Defensible Borders\n\nJerusalem Center for Public Affairs, 2011\n\nThis study by leading Israeli security experts presents a comprehensive assessment of Israel’s critical security requirements, particularly the need for defensible borders that was enshrined in UN Security Council Resolution 242 and endorsed by past U.S. administrations. Authors include Lt.-Gen. (ret.) Moshe Yaalon, Maj.-Gen. (res.) Uzi Dayan, Maj.-Gen. (res.) Yaakov Amidror, Maj.-Gen. (res.) Aharon Ze’evi Farkash, and Brig.-Gen. (res.) Udi Dekel.

Giora Eiland, 2009\n\nIsraeli-Syrian negotiations in 1999-2000 discussed security arrangements to compensate Israel for the loss of the Golan Heights. This analysis demonstrates that Israel does not possess a plausible solution to its security needs without the Golan Heights. Not only was the “solution” proposed in the year 2000 implausible at the time, but changing circumstances have rendered Israel’s forfeiture of the Golan today an even more reckless act.
