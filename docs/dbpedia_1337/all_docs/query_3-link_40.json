This number was more than twice the 6,852 that were announced by the Japan Coast Guard in 1987. Advances in surveying technology and the detailed representation of topographic features through digital mapping allowed for the greater accuracy. Only about 260 of the islands are actually inhabited.\n\nJune 1, 2023\n\nThe World Factbook has added a new âWorld biomesâ field to the Environment section of the World entry.

While different classification systems define different numbers of biomes, the Factbook recognizes the seven biomes used by NASA: Tundra, Coniferous Forest, Temperate Deciduous Forest, Rainforest, Grassland, Shrubland, and Desert.\n\nThe new entry includes a World Biomes map, as well as photos and detailed descriptions of each of biome.\n\nMay 25, 2023\n\nIn the Economy category, the âBudgetâ field â with its revenues and expenditures subfields â was recently updated with the latest available data.\n\nMay 18, 2023\n\nIn the Environment category, two water-availability fields â âTotal water withdrawalâ and âTotal renewable water resourcesâ â were recently updated with the latest available data.\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\nThe World Factbook recently updated the World âPopulationâ entry and its four superlative subfields based on data provided by the US Census Bureau. As of 2023, the Worldâs population is estimated to be 7.98 billion.Â Its most populous country is China (1.41 billion), and its least populous is the Holy See (1,000).Â The Worldâs most densely populated country is Macau (22,856.1 people per sq km) while Greenland is the Worldâs least densely populated (0.003 people per sq km).\n\nMay 4, 2023\n\nThe World Factbook has launched an exciting new product, the Africa Demographic Atlas.Â The Atlas brings together many of our population fields for African countries, including such topics as ethnic groups, languages, and religions, as well as fertility, mortality, migration, health, education, and population distribution.Â The Atlasâ maps and graphics provide geographic context and data visualization for over 50 African countries.\n\nApril 27, 2023\n\nThe World Health Organizationâs âWorld Malaria Dayâ is April 25th. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that in 2020, 241 million cases of malaria occurred, and 627,000 people, mostly children in Africa, died of malaria.Â The World Factbook has expanded the Major infectious disease field in the World entry to focus on the global distribution of the most serious infectious diseases and has provided maps showing the disease distribution.Â In addition, the âMajor infectious diseaseâ entry for all countries has been updated with the most recent risk assessments.\n\nApril 20, 2023\n\nIn the Transnational Issues category, the âTrafficking in personsâ field has been updated with 2022 information from the State Departmentâs annual Trafficking in Persons Report.Â This year the State Department designated 34 countries as Tier 2 Watchlist (not meeting minimum standards to eliminate trafficking but making significant efforts to do so) and 22 as Tier 3 (not meeting minimum standards to eliminate trafficking and not making significant efforts to do so).\n\nApril 13, 2023\n\nThe World Factbook is pleased to announce the addition of two new Economy fields: âRemittancesâ and âAverage household expenditures.â Expressed as a percent of GDP, âRemittancesâ are the aggregate amount of personal monies that people send from one country to people in another (often family and friends) to help with expenses. âAverage household expendituresâ are the average percentages of household income spent on certain goods and commodities, and this initial release features the expenditures on food and on alcohol and tobacco.\n\nApril 6, 2023\n\nIn the Military and Security section, the âMaritime threatsâ entry â which describes piracy threats â was recently updated with 2022 numbers. Overall, the number of incidents world-wide continues to decline â 115 in 2022 compared with 132 in 2021. This total is the lowest number since 1994. Nonetheless, certain areas remain very dangerous. The majority (64%) of the attacks occurred in the waters of five countries: Bangladesh (7), Ghana (7), Indonesia (10), Peru (12), and the Singapore Straits (38).\n\nMarch 30, 2023\n\nThe number of country photographs in The World Factbook now exceeds 5,000. All are in the public domain. These photographs may be viewed in a number of ways. After clicking on a countryâs Photos section, the first 12 images will show up. In the upper right, a âPer Page:â box with a dropdown arrow allows users to view more photos at a time (24, 48, or All). Once an image is selected, it appears in a larger size along with a useful scroll bar that displays icons of the five photos before and after the selected photo in the photo sequence. Check out the new photo access system and enjoy browsing the Factbookâs ever-growing photographic collection.\n\nMarch 23, 2023\n\nA large number of demographic entries in the People and Society category were recently updated with the latest 2023 data from the US Census Bureau. Among the fields updated are: âPopulation,â âPopulation growth rate,â âAge structure,â and âTotal fertility rate.â\n\nMarch 16, 2023\n\nAre you keeping up with the Fact of the Day on the Factbookâs home page? If you missed some recent entries, you can catch up in the newly added Daily Facts Archive that displays all the facts from the previous 30 days.\n\nMarch 9, 2023\n\nAppendix H: Strategic Materials has been further enhanced with the addition of photographs illustrating most of the minerals that serve as the sources for strategic materials. Detailed information on each image becomes visible when hovering over the photo.\n\nMarch 2, 2023\n\nThe World Factbook is pleased to announce the addition of its 10th appendix, which displays Population Pyramids by Region. Population pyramids illustrate a countryâs age and sex structure.Â By grouping the pyramids by region, the age and sex structure of neighboring countries can be compared visually. For example, the male, working-age side of Kuwaitâs population pyramid bulges out more than the female side because of the large number of male labor migrants, while nearby Iraq has a triangularly shaped pyramid because the youth population (the base of the pyramid) is much larger than its elderly population (the upper part of the pyramid). The striking difference in age and sex structure may be seen in the new Appendix I, under âMiddle East.â\n\nFebruary 23, 2023\n\nThe World Factbook has completed its review and supplementation of Appendix F: Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names. This appendix now contains some 1,600 place names and their geographic coordinates. It is particularly valuable as a source of historic (former), alternate, or local names for a variety of regions, countries, cities, islands, water bodies, and other geographic features.\n\nFebruary 16, 2023\n\nThe World Factbook recently uploaded almost 9,000 economic data updates, including all GDP fields, âInflation rate,â âIndustrial production growth rate,â âLabor force,â âUnemployment rate,â âPublic debt,â âTaxes and other revenues,â âCurrent account balance,â âExports,â âImports,â âReserves of foreign exchange and gold,â âExternal debt,â and âExchange rates.â\n\nFebruary 9, 2023\n\nâDemographic profilesâ for eight Central Asian and South Caucasus countries have recently been added to the People and Society category.Â The countries included are: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.\n\nFebruary 2, 2023\n\nUpdates to the âPorts and terminalsâ field include new information on liquid natural gas (LNG) terminals, container ports, and cruise ports. Germany is ramping up LNG import terminals to offset the loss of natural gas pipelines from Russia and now has three operational LNG import terminals with plans to build as many as six in total. To accelerate the availability of LNG imports, Germany is utilizing ship-based Floating Storage and Regasification Units (FSRU).\n\nRecently released 2021 port data shows that most of the top-twenty container ports in the World in terms of âtwenty-foot equivalentâ (TEU) units continue to be in Asia, but in 2021 three US ports made the top twenty list. The most important cruise tourism destination in the World is the Caribbean Region, where tourism is vital to the economies of most of the island countries. The new update includes an expanded list of Caribbean cruise ports.\n\nJanuary 26, 2023\n\nThe World Factbook is pleased to introduce two new entries in the People and Society category.Â The first field is the âGross reproduction rate,â which is the average number of daughters a woman would have if she survived all of her childbearing years.Â It indicates whether the next generation of women will exceed, match, or outnumber the current population of women of reproductive age.Â The second field is âCurrently married women (ages 15-49),â which provides the percentage of married or in-union women among women of reproductive age (15-49).\n\nJanuary 19, 2023\n\nAppendix H: Strategic Materials has been updated and an additional section on Alloys added. The new information supplements the existing data on Metals, Non-metals, Rare earth elements, and Compounds.\n\nJanuary 12, 2023\n\nIn the People and Society category, the following fields have been updated for all countries:Â âEducation expenditures,â âSchool life expectancy,â â Dependency ratios,â âContraceptive prevalence rate,â and âHIV/AIDS â adult prevalence rate.â\n\nJanuary 5, 2023\n\nIn Appendix B: International Organizations and Groups, three global sport governing bodies have been added: for association football (soccer), the International Association Football Federation (FIFA); for basketball, the International Basketball Federation (FIBA); and for baseball, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC).\n\nDecember 29, 2022\n\nInformation on ocean currents in the Geography section of each of the five Oceans â Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, Pacific, and Southern â was recently transferred into its own âMajor ocean currentsâ entry, along with a map showing the Major World Ocean Currents.\n\nIn the Transportation category, a new âIcebreakerâ field has been added for the three Oceans â Arctic, Atlantic, and Pacific â where icebreaker fleets are harbored. A detailed map shows the Homeports of Major Polar Icebreakers.\n\nDecember 15, 2022\n\nFor the past several years, The World Factbook team has provided an interesting daily fact to staff at the CIA. Beginning today, The World Factbook will share a new daily fact with folks visiting this site from around the World.\n\nDecember 8, 2022\n\nThe World Factbook is delighted to recognize the ongoing World Cup soccer tournament in Qatar with eight special World Cup One-Page Country Summaries, one for each of the remaining quarterfinalists: Argentina, Brazil, Croatia, England (UK), France, Morocco, Netherlands, and Portugal. The Summaries appear in the Factbookâs World entry under the Introduction > âWorld Cup 2022â.\n\nDecember 1, 2022\n\nThe World Factbook has dramatically expanded its five Oceans entries and newly added features will be announced over the next few weeks. The first of the new components may be found in the Environment section under the âMarine fisheriesâ entry where illustrations of the major commercial fish and shellfish harvested in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans (where most commercial fishing takes place) are now included.\n\nNovember 17, 2022\n\nAccording to UN estimates, the World population reached 8 billion this week. This marks the third time that The World Factbook has marked a billion-person growth milestone. Previous instances occurred in 1999 (6 billion) and 2012 (7 billion). This phenomenal growth is due to the gradual increase in human longevity owing to improvements in nutrition, personal hygiene, public health, and medicine, as well as high and persistent levels of fertility in some countries. While it took the global population about 10.7 years to grow from 7 to 8 billion, it will take some 15 years â until 2037 â for it to reach 9 billion, a sign that the overall growth rate of the global population is slowing.\n\nNovember 10, 2022\n\nAcknowledging user feedback, The World Factbook recently added a âCarbon dioxide emissionsâ field to its Energy category. In addition to the total emissions per country (in million metric tonnes), the field includes three subfields for emissions: from coal and metallurgical coke, from petroleum and other liquids, and from consumed natural gas.\n\nNovember 3, 2022\n\nWhile the European Union (EU) does not have any permanent standing military forces, Europe has a variety of multinational military organizations that may be called upon to deploy through the EU, in a NATO environment, upon the mandate of the participating countries, or upon the mandate of other international organizations, such as the UN or OSCE. The World Factbook has added a listing of these organizations and their missions under the European Union entry, âMilitary â noteâ field.\n\nOctober 27, 2022\n\nConsiderable numbers of new photos were recently added to the following Pacific island entities: American Samoa, Clipperton Island, French Polynesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and the Northern Marianas.\n\nOctober 20, 2022\n\nThe World FactbookÂ is proud to announce the inclusion of five new Special Products under the World entry. These unique compendia condense fascinating information about our World onto five special two-page summaries covering: The Human World, The Connected World, The Energy World, The Physical World, and The Economic World. Check them out, print them off, and impress your friends with this engrossing data drawn from the pages of the Factbook.\n\nOctober 13, 2022\n\nResponding to user feedback, The World Factbook recently introduced a âCoalâ field into its Energy section, with subfields of production, consumption, exports, imports, and proven reserves. The Factbookâs coal data includes anthracite, metallurgical, bituminous, subbituminous, and lignite coal and metallurgical coke.\n\nOctober 6, 2022\n\nKazakhstan recently changed the name of its capital city from Nur-Sultan back to Astana. This was the latest in a long list of name changes for the city. Founded in 1830 as Akmoly, it became Akmolinsk in 1832, Tselinograd in 1961, Akmola in 1992, Astana in 1998, and Nur-Sultan in 2019. The latter was to honor a former president who has now fallen out of favor, thus the reversion to the Astana designation.\n\nSeptember 29, 2022\n\nThe recent installation of a new monarch in the United Kingdom has prompted the question: Just how many countries in the World have royal families? The answer in 27, most are in Asia (13) and Europe (10), three in Africa, and one in Oceania. To see a list of all these countries by continent, go to World > âExecutive branchâ > chief of state. Note, however, that there are 14 additional Commonwealth countries that share the British monarch as their chief of state.\n\nSeptember 22, 2022\n\nA third set of larger and more detailed country maps has been added to the Factbook. The new country maps include: Bangladesh, Belarus, Botswana, Burundi, Canada, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mauritania, Mexico, Moldova, and Poland; as well as the European Union; the tri-partite British overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha; and the island of Taiwan. The total number of newly enhanced maps now stands at 50; of these, 15 include new high-elevation locations in order to conform with the latest data from the US Department of State.\n\nSeptember 15, 2022\n\nWith the recent passing of Elizabeth II, The World Factbook has updated its chief of state entries for all 15 of the Commonwealth realm countries â as well as for all of the many British, Australian, and New Zealand dependencies and areas of special sovereignty â for which she was recognized as monarch.\n\nSeptember 8, 2022\n\nThe World Factbook has added a new âAlcohol consumptionâ field to the People and Society category providing the latest estimates on alcohol consumption per capita (APC). APC is an estimate of the amount of alcohol consumed per capita by persons aged 15 years and over in a calendarÂ year, measured in liters of alcohol. The field not only provides information on total alcohol consumption but breaks consumption down further into beer, wine, spirits, and other forms of alcohol. The Cook Islands has the highest alcohol consumption world wide at 12.97 liters per person per year.\n\nSeptember 1, 2022\n\nThe World Factbookâs revised âElectricityâ field now combines five former fields into a single field for reading ease. The new field reports a countryâs installed generating capacity, consumption, exports, imports, and transmission/distribution losses as subfields. The only definitional shift is replacing the legacy âElectricity productionâ field with the new transmission/distribution losses subfield, referring to the combined difference between the electricity generated and/or imported and electricity consumed and/or exported. The previous âElectricity productionâ field captured these losses.\n\nAugust 25, 2022\n\nIn the Geography section for all countries, the âLand boundariesâ entry was recently updated with the latest country boundary lengths (terrestrial) as compiled by the US Department of State.\n\nAugust 18, 2022\n\nPassenger traffic through the Worldâs airports in 2021 increased 38.3% over 2020, reflecting a significant rebound in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta was the Worldâs busiest in 2021 with 75.7 million passengers. US airports dominated with nine out of the top 10 airports, including the top seven. Most of this recovery was due to an increase in domestic travel in the US. Air cargo volumes also increased 15.4% globally, to reach a record 125 million metric tons. Check out all the latest numbers under World > Transportation > âAirportsâ.\n\nAugust 11, 2022\n\nA new The World of the CIA page has been added under the About tab to let visitors learn more about the Factbookâs home world at CIA headquarters. This portfolio of outstanding photographs also contains links to still further photos of the CIA compound. Check it out.\n\nAugust 4, 2022\n\nThis month marks The World Factbookâs 60th birthday! To celebrate, a special 60th anniversary cover has been commissioned.\n\nAlthough the Factbook ceased publication in 2017, new annual cover designs have continued to be made as they help brand the publication and online audiences look forward to seeing what each new cover will highlight. This yearâs special design â appearing on the Gallery of Covers page â subtly shows the progression and expansion of the Factbook over time; it becomes more graphic heavy âreadâ from left to right. Also added to the Gallery this week are selected examples of some of the plain covers from the Factbookâs first two decades, which further underscore the publicationâs development over the past sixty years.\n\nJuly 28, 2022\n\nThe World Factbookâs Energy category was recently restructured; while most data has been retained, various former fields have now been combined as subfields under the broad headings of âElectricity,â âCoal,â âPetroleum,â and âNatural gas.â Explanations of some of these revisions will appear below and in Whatâs New statements in coming weeks.\n\nTo improve readability and address user feedback, The World Factbook has revised its natural gas data by combining the five former fields into a singular âNatural gasâ field, with production, consumption, exports, imports, and proven reserves sub-fields. All data reflect only dry natural gas and exclude non-hydrocarbon gases, as well as vented, flared, and reinjected natural gas.\n\nJuly 21, 2022\n\nThe 2021 edition of The World Factbook has been added to the Archives page (under About). All previous versions of The World Factbook â from 2000 to 2021 â are now available on that page.\n\nJuly 14, 2022\n\nIn Appendix D: Cross-Reference List of Country Data Codes, the old two-character GEC codes in the first column have been replaced by the new standard three-character GENC codes being adopted by the US Government as the authoritative codes for countries and their subdivisions. GENC stands for Geopolitical Entities, Names, and Codes and is the authoritative set of country names and codes for use by the Federal Government for information exchange. Further details about various types of country codes may be found in the introductory paragraphs of Appendix D.\n\nJuly 7, 2022\n\nA common question asked of The World Factbook is: How many countries are there? The answer is 195. Based on the seven-continent model, and grouping islands with adjacent continents, Africa has the most countries with 54. Europe contains 49 countries and Asia 48, but these two continents share five countries: Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkey. North America consists of 23 sovereign states, Oceania has 14, and South America 12.\n\nJune 30, 2022\n\nHave you ever travelled abroad and wondered about a countryâs traditional foods? Now you can turn to a countryâs Travel Facts and learn about one of its popular national dishes in a new âTraditional Cuisineâ entry. In Egypt, for example, ful medames is a stew of cooked fava beans with olive oil, cumin, and other herbs and spices that is served from a large metal jug.\n\nJune 23, 2022\n\nThe World FactbookÂ has added a new âTobacco useâ field to the People and Society category providing the latest estimates of tobacco use, whether smoked or smokeless or both. According to the World Health Organization, 23% of the US population uses tobacco products, 28.4% among men and 17.5% among women.Â This usage rate ranks the US in 66th position among countries, below Italy but above the Philippines.\n\nJune 16, 2022\n\nDid you know that Antarctica contains more water than any other continent? The only problem is that it is all ice! Some 99% of the land area is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, the largest single mass of ice on earth covering an area of 14 million sq km (5.4 million sq mi) and containing 26.5 million cu km (6.4 million cu mi) of ice (this is almost 62% of all of the worldâs fresh water). If all this ice were converted to liquid water, one estimate is that it would be sufficient to raise the height of the worldâs ocean by 58 m (190 ft).\n\nJune 9, 2022\n\nFor the five World oceans â Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, Pacific, and Southern â a âVolumeâ entry was recently added that not only presents the estimated volume of each of the oceans in million cubic kilometers, but also the percent of the World Ocean total volume. For example, the Indian Oceanâs 264 million cu km volume represents 19.8% of the volume of all of the Worldâs oceans.\n\nJune 2, 2022\n\nYou are visiting a new country and trying to determine what would be a perfect memento of your trip. The World Factbook can help you decide. The Travel Facts page for every country now includes a Souvenirs section that lists favorite items that visitors like to procure. For example, in Nepal common souvenirs include: knotted/woven carpets and hemp items, wool pashminas, sheepskin slippers, woven caps, kukri knives, precious metal and turquoise jewelry, sacred scroll paintings, wood instruments, lokta bark paper, tea, and kitchen spices.\n\nMay 26, 2022\n\nIn the Environment category, the âFood insecurityâ field was recently updated with first quarter 2022 information for 44 â mostly African and Asian â countries where access to food supplies remains a concern. While there have been no significant changes, lingering effects of COVID-19 restrictions are still apparent. More ominously, the ongoing Ukraine war is preventing grain deliveries and raising warnings of an impending global food crisis.\n\nMay 19, 2022\n\nA second batch of larger and more detailed country maps was recently added to the Factbook. The new countries include: The Bahamas, Benin, Cameroon, Cuba, Denmark, Egypt, Gabon, Kyrgyzstan, Montenegro, and North Korea.\n\nMay 12, 2022\n\nSeveral key demographic fields in the People and Society category have been updated with 2022 data.Â These fields are:Â âLife expectancy at birth,â âTotal fertility rate,â âInfant mortality rate,â and âSex ratio.â\n\nMay 5, 2022\n\nIn late March of this year, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Travel Alert for polio in Africa, as well as for a few Middle Eastern countries. While wild or naturally occurring polio has been virtually eradicated worldwide, a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) has become a concern. VDPV is a strain of the weakened poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine and that has changed over time and behaves like the wild or naturally occurring virus. This means that it can be spread more easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come into contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a sneeze, of an âinfectedâ person who received oral polio vaccine. The CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccination series. The CDC recommendations may be found in the âMajor infectious diseasesâ entry in the People and Society section of the 24 Sub-Saharan African (and miscellaneous other) countries where VDPV is a threat.\n\nApril 28, 2022\n\nAn important new field providing data on the prevalence of âChild marriageâ has been added to the People and Society category. Girls who marry early tend to drop out of school and often have early, higher-risk pregnancies. Child brides are also at risk of abuse, exploitation, and separation from relatives and family.\n\nApril 21, 2022\n\nIn the Military and Security section, the âMaritime threatâ entry â which describes piracy threats â was recently updated with 2021 numbers. Overall, there was a significant drop in incidents world-wide over 2020 (195) to 132 for 2021; this is the lowest number since 1994.Â The Gulf of Aden remained quiet and West African incidents were down considerably. Areas that showed an increase in attacks were the Singapore Straits and the Western Hemisphere.\n\nApril 14, 2022\n\nSeveral population-growth-related fields in the People and Society category have been updated with 2022 data.Â These fields are: âPopulation,â âPopulation growth rate,â âBirth rate,â âDeath rate,â and âNet migration rate.â\n\nApril 7, 2022\n\nIn the Military and Security category, the âMilitary equipment inventories and acquisitionsâ field was recently updated with the latest available information from 2021.\n\nMarch 31, 2022\n\nAppendix H: Strategic Materials, which lists all of the compounds, metals, non-metals, and rare earth elements deemed to be of critical importance to US national security, has been updated. The US is 100% import reliant for 14 of the 59 elements listed as Strategic Materials. The US gets between 19-25 commodities from China, 13-18 commodities from Canada, 10 from South Africa, 9 from Brazil, 8 from India, and 6 from Russia. The economic slowdown associated with COVID-19 affected global production of many commodities in 2020, but that slackening began to recover in 2021.\n\nMarch 24, 2022\n\nThe World Factbook is delighted to announce the inclusion of 24 new country maps â the first tranche in what will be a series of cartographic updates. The new maps, larger in size and more detailed than previous versions, may be found for the following countries/territories: Afghanistan, Algeria, American Samoa, Antarctica, Australia, China, Republic of the Congo, Iceland, India, Iran, Japan, Kazakhstan, Laos, Mongolia, Morocco, Pakistan, Portugal, Spain, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Yemen.\n\nMarch 17, 2022\n\nIn the Military and Security category, the âMilitary expendituresâ field was recently updated with the latest available information.\n\nMarch 10, 2022\n\nInformation on drinking water and sanitation has been updated for 2020; both of these subjects are key indicators of social and economic development.Â Both the âDrinking water sourceâ and âSanitation facility accessâ fields (in the People and Society section) are categorized as âimprovedâ or âunimprovedâ and include data for rural, urban, and total populations.Â Over 90% of the worldâs population has access to improved drinking water sources, while almost 70% of the worldâs population has access to improved sanitation facilities.\n\nMarch 3, 2022\n\nHave a look this week at the population pyramids (under People and Society > âAge structureâ) all of which have recently been updated for 2022. Population pyramids illustrate the age and sex structure of a countryâs population. Pyramids that are wider at the bottom and get progressively narrower toward the top are typical of youthful populations, while pyramids that are barrel-shaped characterize more mature populations. Population pyramids can provide insights about political and social stability, as well as economic development.\n\nFebruary 24, 2022\n\nSubstantial quantities of new photos have recently been added to the following World Factbook entries: Angola, Cuba, Djibouti, Liberia, Nepal, Rwanda, Serbia, and Taiwan.\n\nFebruary 17, 2022\n\nIn the People and Society category, the âUrbanizationâ field, which shows the estimated proportion of a countryâs population living in urban areas, has been updated with 2022 data. The âMajor urban areas â populationâ field, which provides the estimated population of up to six of a countryâs largest urban centers over 750,000 people, has also been updated. For those countries with no metropolisÂ of 750,000 or more, the estimated population of only the capital has been provided.\n\nFebruary 10, 2022\n\nThe World Factbook is delighted to unveil its latest field this week entitled âNational heritage,â which introduces a countryâs UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The first subfield in this new entry â found in the Government section â lists how many sites are present in a country and whether they are cultural or natural or both. The second subfield lists up to 10 or so selected sites in a country. Most countries have fewer than 10 or 12 sites, but some (mostly larger) countries contain many dozen. The United States currently has 24 inscribed sites. Where possible, links have been set up from a listed site to a photo from The World Factbookâs photo collection.\n\nFebruary 3, 2022\n\nThe âMilitary service age and obligationâ field has been expanded where possible with information on the approximate numbers or percentages of conscripts in a countryâs military. Additionally, the percentages of women in the military have been added where that data is available.\n\nJanuary 27, 2022\n\nThere are 195 independent countries in the World; amazingly, 80 of them (41% !) have names beginning with one of only four letters (at least in the English language): B (18, Bahamas to Burundi), C (18, Cambodia to Czechia), M (18, Macedonia to Mozambique), and S (24, Saint Kitts and Nevis to Syria). All other letters except W and X begin the name of at least one country.\n\nJanuary 20, 2022\n\nLast week the uninhabited island of Hunga Tonga in the Tongan archipelago began to erupt. Located 65 km (40 mi) north of Tongatapu, Tongaâs main island, it is part of the highly active TongaâKermadec Islands volcanic arc in the South Pacific. The eruption caused damaging tsunamis along the entire rim of the Pacific Ocean but, fortunately, loss of life has been low. The explosion is the largest of the 21st century to date.\n\nJanuary 13, 2022\n\nAppendix B: International Organizations and Groups has been completely updated and includes several new entries (e.g., Forum for the Progress of South America and Wassenaar Arrangement), as well as their contact information (address, phone, fax). In addition, email and website addresses have been added for most organizations.\n\nJanuary 06, 2022\n\nAppendix T: Terrorist Organizations has been updated with the latest information from the US State Departmentâs just-published Country Terrorism Review. All Appendix T entries are now up to at least 2020 and most are 2021. Included are two new foreign terrorist organizations: the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-Peopleâs Army (FARC-EP) and Segunda Marquetalia.\n\nDecember 30, 2021\n\nHave you ever heard of AOSIS? The acronym stands for the Alliance of Small Island States. Established in 1990, it is an intergovernmental organization of 39 small island and low-lying coastal countries that are particularly vulnerable to climate change. AOSIS has been very active from its inception and has played a leading role in global forums in raising awareness on climate change and in advocating for action to address climate change. To find out more about AOSIS, or about any of more than 200 other international organizations, go to References and click on Appendix B: International Organizations and Groups.\n\nDecember 16, 2021\n\nIn the five Oceans entries, the âMarine fisheriesâ field â in the Environment category â has been updated with the latest available 2019 FAO numbers. Overall, the rankings did not change significantly. The Pacific Ocean remains the largest fishery with 57.8% of total global catch, followed by the Atlantic (26.4%), and Indian Oceans (15.3%). Herrings, sardines, and anchovies make up 24% of the global catch of marine fishes.\n\nDecember 9, 2021\n\nIn the Transportation category, theÂ âMerchant marineâ entry has been updated for all countries that have a merchant fleet.\n\nDecember 2, 2021\n\nOn 30 November 2021, the Caribbean island nation of Barbados became a republic, transitioning from a parliamentary constitutional monarchy to a parliamentary republic with a ceremonial elected president as head of state. The prime minister remains head of government and the country continues its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations. The date marked the 55th anniversary of Barbados achieving its independence from the UK in 1966.\n\nNovember 18, 2021\n\nAre you interested in education and youth employment trends?

The countries are: Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Egypt, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, and Tunisia. While MNNA status provides military and economic privileges, it does not entail any security commitments. Information on MNNA status has been added to the âMilitary â noteâ for each of these countries.\n\nOctober 14, 2021\n\nThe World Factbook is introducing four new water-related fields, to appear in both the Geography and Environment categories. âMajor aquifersâ and âMajor watershedsâ are being launched this week; âMajor lakesâ and âMajor riversâ will be added in the not-too-distant future.\n\nOctober 7, 2021\n\nThe âMilitary expendituresâ entry was recently updated for all countries with the latest available data â mostly with 2020 numbers, but a few with 2021 or 2019 figures.\n\nSeptember 30, 2021\n\nIn the Government category, the âDiplomatic representation in the USâ and the âDiplomatic representation from the USâ entries were recently updated for all countries. Additionally, email and website addresses were included for all foreign embassies in the US, as well as for US embassies abroad.\n\nSeptember 23, 2021\n\nDid you know there really is a Robinson Crusoe Island? From 1704 to 1709, the island was home to a marooned sailor, Alexander Selkirk, who at least partially inspired novelist Daniel Defoeâs fictional Robinson Crusoe in his 1719 novel. Today some 850 people live on the island, which received its current name in 1966 to reflect its literary connection and to promote tourism. To find out where the island is located, what it was formerly called, and to what country it belongs, check the Factbookâs Appendix F: Geographic Names.\n\nSeptember 16, 2021\n\nThe troy weight system is primarily used in the precious metals industry (e.g., the troy ounce is a traditional unit of gold weight). So, how would someone convert from troy pounds to kilograms? Find out by visiting The World Factbookâs Weights and Measures page (Appendix G) and scrolling down to either kilograms or pounds, troy.\n\nSeptember 9, 2021\n\nRare earth elements or REEs are 17 chemical elements that are critical in many of todayâs high-tech industries. Typical applications for REEs include batteries in hybrid cars, fiber optic cables, flat panel displays, and permanent magnets, as well as some defense and medical products. Appendix H: Strategic Materials includes detailed information on 16 of these elements, including facts describing the elements, their uses, import sources and import quantities, world resources, and any available substitutes. (The only REE not included is Promethium, which exists only in miniscule, economically insignificant quantities.)\n\nSeptember 2, 2021\n\nIn the Government category, under the âLegislative branchâ entry, the descriptions for all Central and South Asian countries, as well as all South American, Mesoamerican, and Greater Antilles countries, have been reviewed and updated where necessary.\n\nAugust 26, 2021\n\nIn the Transportation section, the âPorts and terminalsâ container port(s) throughput numbers were all recently updated with the latest-available 2019 data. These figures, which are pre-COVID, show no significant trend, but the pandemic could have an effect on 2020 and 2021 numbers. China recently closed its second-largest port (third-largest in the world) due to the COVID outbreak. Many reports indicate a down-turn in container traffic world-wide for the last 18 months.\n\nAugust 19, 2021\n\nIn the Government section for all countries, the âDiplomatic representation from the USâ entry has recently received a new subfield. In addition to the name of the ambassador/chargeâ and the embassy address, telephone, and FAX, an email address has now been added.\n\nAugust 12, 2021\n\nAre you interested in foreign languages? Would you like to hear what Thai or Hungarian sound like? Following up on the June addition of printed âmajor-language sampleâ entries to the âLanguagesâ entry for over 130 countries, The World Factbook has now added âaudio language samplesâ for over 110 countries. Happy listening!\n\nAugust 5, 2021\n\nIn the Geography category for all countries, a review and updating of âLand boundariesâ (lengths measured in kilometers) was recently completed. Additionally, a new âWorldâ land boundaries total was compiled that came to 279,035.5 km. This figure is actually misleading, however, since it is impossible to accurately measure every river meander along a boundary. A number rounded slightly higher â to 280,000 km â makes more sense and has been coordinated with and approved by the US State Department.\n\nJuly 29, 2021\n\nThe latest addition to our popular Travel Facts download is a second emergency phone number. The original number supplied was for US citizens while abroad. The new number (1-888-407-4747) can be used by US/Canada-based US citizens in the event of a foreign natural disaster or terrorist event to call about the status of loved ones traveling abroad in affected areas.\n\nJuly 22, 2021\n\nIn the Environment category, all the âFood insecurityâ entries have been updated with the latest available UN Food and Agriculture Organization data (July 2021).\n\nJuly 15, 2021\n\nSubstantial quantities of new photos have recently been added for the following countries: Cyprus, France, Kenya, Malta, Saint Lucia, and the United Kingdom.\n\nJuly 8, 2021\n\nA Major Sports entry was recently added to our acclaimed Travel Facts download to highlight some of the most popular spectator and participatory sporting activities to be found in every country.\n\nJune 30, 2021\n\nThe World Factbook has expanded its âLanguagesâ entry to include major-language samples for 130 countries where English is not the only principal language.

More language samples will be added in the future.\n\nJune 17, 2021\n\nIn the Government category, the âConstitutionâ entry (including the âhistoryâ and âamendmentsâ sub-entries) has been reviewed and updated for all countries in Africa, East Asia, North and South America, the Caribbean, and Oceania. These latest regions join the European, Central and South Asian, and Middle Eastern countries that were completed earlier this year.\n\nJune 10, 2021\n\nIn the Transnational Issues category, the âTrafficking in personsâ entry was recently updated for the roughly five dozen countries where this situation continues to be a serious problem and is not being adequately addressed.\n\nJune 3, 2021\n\nMany World Factbook users are aware that the Government section for every country contains a âNational anthemâ entry as well as a musical link. Did you know that the World entry also has national anthem information? Listed in that entry are distinctive or exceptional anthems, such as the worldâs oldest anthem, the worldâs shortest anthem, the countries with two official anthems, etc. Visit the World entry to learn what all these remarkable anthems are.\n\nMay 27, 2021\n\nDid you know that the oceans are divided into three zones based on depth and light level? Find out what these three levels are by going to any of the five ocean entries (Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, Pacific, Southern), then the âElevationâ field and checking out the new âocean zonesâ entry. A link to a helpful chart is also included.\n\nMay 20, 2021\n\nThe âMarine fisheriesâ field in the Environment section of the five Oceans entries was recently updated. The link found in each of these fields displays the Major Fishing Areas of the world as delineated by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.\n\nMay 13, 2021\n\nTrade data fields for âImports â commodities,â âExports â commodities,â âImports â partners,â and âExports â partnersâ have been updated for all countries and territories. This update includes trade data for smaller territories that The World Factbook had not previously reported.\n\nMay 6, 2021\n\nIn the World entry, the airport traffic numbers in the Transportation category have been updated with preliminary 2020 data and they present a dramatically different scenario due to COVID-19 restrictions. Passenger traffic through the top ten airports declined 45.7% in 2020 and for all airports globally dropped am amazing 64.6%. Atlanta, which had been the busiest passenger airport for more than 20 years, is now number two. Seven of the top ten airports for passenger traffic are in China and the other three are in the US. Most of the new rankings are due to domestic flights in China; when global traffic opens up again the old passenger patterns should reemerge.\n\nIn contrast, air cargo traffic in the top ten airports grew by 3% in 2020 and the rank order was largely unchanged. Memphis, TN surpassed Hong Kong to become the busiest cargo airport. All told, the top ten cargo airports handled 28% of global air cargo.\n\nApril 29, 2021\n\nIn the Military and Security category, the following fields have been updated with the latest 2020 or 2021 data/information: âMilitary and security forces,â âMilitary and security service personnel strengths,â âMilitary deployments,â and âMilitary equipment inventories and acquisitions.â\n\nApril 22, 2021\n\nIn honor of Earth Day, The World Factbook is introducing a new Environment category, with newly compiled entries that include information on air pollution, water supplies, revenues from natural resources, food insecurity, and waste and recycling. A few of the new categoryâs fields have appeared in other Factbook sections before (climate, land use, urbanization, major infectious diseases) and they are now gathered in this new section. The new category may be found after âPeople and Societyâ but before âGovernmentâ under every country listing.\n\nApril 15, 2021\n\nA âDemographic profileâ was recently added to the People and Society category for the eleven Southeast Asian countries: Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam.

Demographic profiles are also available for all of the African, and Central and South American countries.\n\nApril 8, 2021\n\nIn the Economy section, the âEase of Doing Business scoresâ entry has been expanded and now includes four subfields: Overall score, Starting a Business score, Trading score, and an Enforcement score. These scores illustrate the business climate in a country relative to other countries, as well as that countryâs entrepreneurial, trading, and contract-enforcement environment.\n\nApril 1, 2021\n\nAppendix H: Strategic Materials, which lists all of the compounds, metals, non-metals, and rare earth elements deemed to be of critical importance to US national security, was recently reviewed and updated.\n\nMarch 25, 2021\n\nA Tourist Destinations entry was recently added to our popular Travel Facts download â to highlight some of the most popular sights and attractions to be found in every country.\n\nMarch 18, 2021\n\nIn the Government category, the âConstitutionâ entry (including âhistoryâ and âamendmentsâ sub-entries) has been reviewed and updated where needed for all European, Middle Eastern, Central and South Asian countries.\n\nMarch 11, 2021\n\nIn the Military and Security category, the âMaritime threatsâ (piracy) field has been updated with a summary of information from the Office of Naval Intelligence and the International Maritime Bureau. With 196 attacks in 2020, piracy has increased over the 162 incidents in 2019 especially in West Africa/Gulf of Guinea, which has emerged as the new hot spot. As a result, a âMaritime threatsâ field now appears under the following West African countries: Benin, Cameroon, Cote dâIvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Sao Tome, and Togo, in addition to the previous entry under Nigeria. The Horn of Africa remains quiet, but Southeast Asia is another significant problem area including the Malacca Strait, and the South China and Sulu Seas.\n\nMarch 4, 2021\n\nAppendix T: Terrorist Organizations has been updated to reflect information available as of late 2020/early 2021. Newly included is Harakat Sawaâd Misr (HASM), which was designated by the US Government as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) in January 2021. HASM operates in Egypt and is in part composed of alienated Muslim Brotherhood (MB) members who view violence rather than dialogue as a more effective means to overthrow the Egyptian Government and who operate independently of MB.\n\nFebruary 25, 2021\n\nIn the People and Society category, the following fields were all recently updated: âPopulationâ (projected mid-year numbers), âPopulation growth rate,â âBirth rate,â âDeath rate,â âNet migration rate,â âInfant mortality rate,âÂ and âLife expectancy at birth.â\n\nFebruary 18, 2021\n\nAll of the world and regional maps â both physical and political â have been updated to reflect recent boundary and administrative changes.

Additionally, in the Economy category, two new fields launched: âCredit ratingsâ and âEase of Doing Business Index Scores.â These fields, in addition to the newly updated fields of âImports,â âExports,â âExchange rates,â and âInflation ratesâ for many countries, showcase the most recent business and trade environments in the world economy.\n\nDecember 10, 2020\n\nYears of wrangling were brought to a close this week when officials from Nepal and China announced that they have agreed on the height of Mount Everest. The mountain sits on the border between Nepal and Tibet (in western China), and its height changed slightly following an earthquake in 2015. The new height of 8,848.86 meters is just under a meter higher than the old figure of 8,848 meters. The World Factbook rounds the new measurement to 8,849 meters and this new height has been entered throughout the Factbook database.\n\nDecember 03, 2020\n\nMost countries have had their macroeconomic entries updated with the latest available data. The updated fields include: âGDP (purchasing power parity),â âGDP â per capita (PPP),â âGDP â real growth rate,â âLabor force,â and âUnemployment rate.â\n\nNovember 25, 2020\n\nMore One-Page Country Summaries have recently been added to the site; the current total stands at 194.

The appendix provides details on US State Department-designated terrorist groupsâ aims, organization, tactics, weaponry, funding, etc.\n\nNovember 12, 2020\n\nIn the Communications category, the entries for âTelephones â mobile cellularâ and âTelephones â fixed linesâ have been updated for all countries with the latest available data.\n\nNovember 05, 2020\n\nThe âNational Air Transport Systemâ entry is a valuable indicator of economic and transportation activity. The quality of a countryâs air transport system is important since it binds a country together internally as well as connecting it to the wider global community. Found in the Transportation category, the âNational Air Transport Systemâ field has recently been updated for each country with the latest information regarding the number of registered air carriers, the number of fixed-wing aircraft they operate, and the numbers of passengers and amount of air cargo carried.

Three new fields have been added to the Military and Security category of every country that should be of value to researchers across many disciplines. The new entries are: âMilitary and security service personnel strengths,â âMilitary equipment inventories and acquisitions,â and âMilitary deployments.â Explanations of exactly what data is included in each of these fields may be found on the Definitions and Notes page under the References tab.\n\nJune 04, 2020\n\nThe World Factbook presents a couple of geographic puzzles for budding geographers to work on while at home undertaking online learning. 1. What is the greatest distance between two capitals of countries sharing a border? (Hint: the countries are in the northern hemisphere.) 2. What is the greatest distance between one national capital and the capital closest to it? (Hint: the countries are in the southern hemisphere.) Get out your world maps or globes and start measuring. The answers will appear next week on the Did You Know? page, under the About tab.\n\nMay 28, 2020\n\nBy far the two most common forms of citizenship are by birth (where one is born) or by descent (nationality of one or both parents). The World Factbook lists both of these citizenship types and whether they are used by any particular country.

The âCitizenshipâ entry may be found in the Government section.\n\nMay 21, 2020\n\nDid you know that more than three-quarters of the worldâs countries have a maritime boundary of some sort. As such, they have an exclusive economic zone (EEZ), which is a sea zone â set forth by the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea â over which a country has special rights regarding the exploration and use of marine resources. An EEZ stretches from a countryâs mean-low tide baseline at its coast out to 200 nautical miles. Most maps do not show EEZs, but The World Factbookâs World Oceans map does (under the References tab>Regional and World Maps>World Oceans; the PDF version is the most informative, particularly when enlarged). More than one-third of the worldâs ocean area falls within an EEZ.\n\nMay 14, 2020\n\nIn the Communications category, the âTelephone systemsâ field name has been adjusted to âTelecommunication systemsâ to better reflect its many components including various types of telephone systems, cable transmission, satellite linkage, and diverse categories of radio transmission/relay.\n\nMay 07, 2020\n\nThe âCapitalâ entry (under Government) is where visitors to The World Factbook will find information related to time. This placement is because the Factbook indicates the time difference in a country relative to the time observed in Washington, DC. The âCapitalâ entry is also where information on daylight savings time and time zones may be found.\n\nDid you know that only about a third of all countries â and only about one-fifth of the worldâs inhabitants â use daylight savings time? Find more detailed information on time zones and daylight savings time under World>Government>Capital.\n\nApril 30, 2020\n\nDid you know? In a 100-year period, a water molecule spends 98 years in the ocean, 20 months as ice, about two weeks in lakes and rivers, and less than a week in the atmosphere.
