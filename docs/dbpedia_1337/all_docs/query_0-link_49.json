        "text": "RIYADH: The head of the Saudi Arabian Football Federation’s Women’s Football Department, Aalia Al-Rasheed, has lauded the Kingdom’s female futsal players as they near the end of their training camp in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nIn the last two weeks, Saudi’s national futsal team has secured impressive back-to-back victories against Serbia in Sarajevo.\n\nIn the first match, they recorded a 3-2 thanks to goals from Al-Bandari Mubarak, Seba Tawfiq and Al-Bandari Hawsawi. This was followed by a 5-2 win, with Al-Bandari Mubarak scoring all five of Saudia Arabia’s goals.\n\nThe national team are currently ranked 51st in the FIFA Futsal Women’s World Ranking, whilst the Serbian national team are ranked 43rd.\n\n“These wins show just how much effort and passion our team puts into every game,” said Al-Rasheed. “Winning against a strong team like Serbia really boosts (their) confidence and highlights the progress we’re making in women's futsal. It’s incredibly rewarding to see the hard work of our players and coaching staff pay off in such a significant way.”\n\nShe added: “We’ve been focusing on building a strong, cohesive team, and these victories are indications that we’re on the right path. Our goal is to keep pushing forward, learn from every match, and continue to grow. We’re determined to keep this momentum going and reach even greater heights. The support from SAFF and the dedication of our players are key to our success, and I couldn’t be prouder of what we’ve achieved so far.”\n\nThe friendly matches were part of the team’s training camp in Sarajevo, which started in May and continues until June 15. Overseen by head coach Mato Stankovic, it is seen as a critical part of their preparation for upcoming competitions and matches.\n\nThe players currently in Sarajevo are: Layla Ali, Leen Mohammed, Al-Bandari Mubarak, Noura Ibrahim, Atha Fahad, Abeer Nasser, Raghad Mukhayzin, Rahaf Al-Mansouri, Al-Hanouf Saud, Mohrah Al-Malhi, Nadeen Saleh, Al-Bandari Hawsawi, Raghad Saleh, Lana Abdulrazaq, Bayan Sadagah, Seba Tawfiq, Yara Alfaris, Raghad Munai, Manar Al-Onaizi, and Noura Al-Athel.\n\nPARIS: The United States won their fifth straight Olympic men’s basketball crown on Saturday, holding off a battling France 98-87 to take their tally of Olympic golds to 17.\n\nIn a rematch of the Tokyo Olympics final three years ago, LeBron James and the US team stacked with NBA stars once again proved too much for France, despite the efforts of sensational NBA Rookie of the Year Victor Wembanyama.\n\nFrance sliced a 14-point deficit to three with 3min 04sec to play on Wembanyama’s put-back dunk, but Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry drilled a three-pointer — one of four from him with less than three minutes remaining — and the United States relentlessly powered to the finish.\n\nCurry finished with eight three-pointers — including a rainbow over a leaping Wembanyama — and led the US scoring with 24 points.\n\n“You just simply marvel,” James said of Curry. “Having him on your side, you just try to get stops and figure out other ways on the other end but keep finding him, keep getting him the ball.”\n\nCurry said of his late-game heroics: “I was just trying to settle us down.”\n\n“All we wanted to do was get a good shot,” Curry said. “It had been a while since we had a good possession.\n\n“(Finally) the momentum was on our side. At that point, your mind goes blank. You don’t really care about setting or the scenario or anything. It’s just a shot.”\n\nKevin Durant and Devin Booker added 15 points apiece and James scored 14 with six rebounds, 10 assists, a steal and a block.\n\nFor Durant it was a US men’s record fourth Olympic gold. James earned his third and Curry, a four-time NBA champion, claimed his first in his first Olympic appearance.\n\n“There’s a lot of relief,” Curry said. “It wasn’t easy but, damn, I’m excited, man. This is everything that I wanted it to be and more, so I’m excited.”\n\nWembanyama had his best offensive game of the Olympics, scoring 26 points. Guerschon Yabusele added 20.\n\nFrance connected on just nine of 30 three-point attempts and the United States held a 31-9 advantage in fast-break points.\n\nBoth teams were locked in defensively in a tense first half that featured 10 lead changes.\n\nWembanyama soared for a dunk that gave France an 11-10 lead and sent the Bercy Arena crowd into a frenzy.\n\nThe Americans were soon back in front when Booker made a layup off a behind-the-back pass from James and a steal from James set Jayson Tatum loose for a dunk.\n\nDown by five after one quarter, France took a 25-24 lead on a Bilal Coulibaly dunk, but the US continued to capitalize in transition off of France’s misses.\n\nJames drove through traffic for a layup, drawing a foul and flexing at the US bench before making the free throw to put the United States up 37-31, and they led 49-41 at halftime.\n\nThe dream final drew a raft of luminaries. French President Emmanuel Macron was in the house and so was sprint star Sha’Carri Richardson, a day after she anchored the US 4x100m relay to gold.\n\nJames signalled his intentions early, taking the court in golden shoes and opening the scoring with a dunk.\n\nCurry, who scored 36 points in the come-from-behind semifinal victory over Serbia, heated up in the second half, giving the US their biggest lead of the game, 61-47, with a three-pointer early in the third.\n\nFrance kept pressing and were only six down heading into the fourth quarter, but finally had to watch the US players celebrate at the end, draped in flags.\n\nA downcast Wembanyama could only hug his teammates, but with the silver medal around his neck he called the experience “incredible” and said he’d try to return the favor at Los Angeles in 2028.\n\n“I will be going for gold in four years’ time,” he said.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Serbia won bronze with a dominant 93-83 victory over World Cup champions Germany.\n\nThree-time NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic posted a triple double of 19 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists to lead Serbia, who lost 95-91 to the United States in the semifinals.\n\nPARIS: International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said at the Paris Games on Saturday he will not seek to remain in charge for a third term.\n\n“New times are calling for new leaders,” the 70-year-old German lawyer, who has been in charge since 2013, told a session of IOC members in the French capital.\n\nBach said he was asked to stay in his role but insisted he would not attempt to extend his mandate by changing the Olympic charter that limits the president to a maximum of 12 years in the role.\n\n“I know with this decision I am disappointing many of you... But it is in the best interests of our beloved Olympic movement,” he said.\n\nHis successor will be elected during the IOC’s 143rd session in Athens from March 18-21, 2025 and will take office the following June.\n\nThe jostling to succeed Bach will now begin, with some well-informed IOC watchers tipping Zimbabwean former swimmer Kirsty Coventry, 40, for the role.\n\nAruban Nicole Hoevertsz, a 60-year-old former synchronized swimmer and IOC vice president, has also been cited as a possible contender along with World Athletics chief Sebastian Coe, a British two-time Olympic gold medallist over 1,500m.\n\nBach, who won gold for West Germany in the foil fencing team event at the 1976 Olympics, was elected an IOC member at the age of 37 and went on to play a series of influential roles within the organization, notably as a founding member of the IOC’s Athletes’ Commission, before taking over from Jacques Rogge.\n\nWhen he was elected in 2013, the Bavarian claimed to embody the renewal of Olympism — in particular with less expensive and more environmentally friendly Games — with the slogan “change or be changed.”\n\n“This mantra also applies to myself,” he said, before pausing for a few moments, with tears in his eyes.\n\nBach has repeatedly voiced his opposition to sports boycotts, attempting to establish a watertight boundary between political conflicts and the Olympics.\n\nThe next president will be able to prepare for the future with peace of mind with the summer and winter Olympic Games awarded until 2034, with “significant” interest in the 2036 and 2040 editions, Bach said.\n\nPARIS: Mallory Swanson scored the winning goal as the United States edged Brazil 1-0 in Saturday’s Olympic women’s football final to claim the gold medal for a record-extending fifth time.\n\nBrazil fought hard on a hot afternoon at the Parc des Princes, but the USA struck just before the hour mark when Swanson — on her 100th cap — ran through to finish past goalkeeper Lorena.\n\nIt is the first time the USA have taken the Olympic title in 12 years, their gold in Paris adding to those won in 1996, 2004, 2008 and 2012.\n\n“I am just in awe of how hard everyone has worked to get here,” said the winger Trinity Rodman.\n\n“I believed the entire time, but to finally be able to hold (the gold medal) is so amazing.”\n\nThe USA have now beaten Brazil in three of those Olympic finals, with the South Americans again having to settle for silver here just as they did in Athens in 2004 and Beijing four years later.\n\nIt was not quite the ending that their legendary captain Marta was hoping for, as she bowed out of her sixth and last Olympics aged 38 with a third silver medal.\n\n“We surpassed ourselves throughout the competition to get to the final. That was our main objective, to come away with a medal,” Marta said.\n\nBrazil were never expected to get this far, while the USA’s victory confirms their renaissance under new English coach Emma Hayes.\n\nShe only arrived from Chelsea in late May but has worked wonders with a team that a year ago was sent packing from the World Cup in the last 16.\n\n“I am very emotional. It has been a dream of mine to be in this position,” Hayes told broadcaster Eurosport.\n\nShe described her team as “tremendous people and players and role models, I love them.”\n\nThat World Cup campaign in Australia and New Zealand was the international swansong for USWNT icon Megan Rapinoe, who was among the crowd for Saturday’s final, as was Tom Cruise.\n\nMuch of the talk in the build-up was about Marta, with the Brazil great free to return for a farewell Olympic appearance after serving a two-game ban for a red card in her team’s last group outing.\n\nBut the 38-year-old multiple winner of the FIFA world player of the year award was left on the bench at kick-off by coach Arthur Elias.\n\nA younger Marta had played in Brazil’s defeats in the 2004 and 2008 finals, both of which came in extra time.\n\nThis was also the second clash between the nations in a final this year, after the USA won 1-0 in the CONCACAF Gold Cup in March.\n\nThe USA subsequently welcomed Hayes as coach and she oversaw wins against Japan and Germany in the knockout rounds to get to the Olympic final.\n\nBrazil, meanwhile, scraped through their group as a best third-placed team, before wins against hosts France in the quarter-finals and World Cup holders Spain in the last four, both achieved without Marta.\n\nTheir direct approach posed problems to the USA defense in the first half, and they had the ball in the net on 16 minutes.\n\nLudmila turned Naomi Girma inside out in the box before finishing, but the goal was disallowed for offside.\n\nSwanson was denied at the other end by Lorena after bursting into the box, yet it was Brazil who had the best chance of the opening half.\n\nCaptain Adriana crossed in stoppage time for Gabi Portilho to divert the ball toward goal, but Alyssa Naeher saved well.\n\nThe Americans boasted the more dangerous attack, though, and they went ahead on 57 minutes when Korbin Albert released Swanson to advance and finish expertly for her fourth goal of the tournament.\n\nBrazil sent on Marta for the final half hour, but they never seriously looked like equalising.\n\nThe veteran sent a free-kick over the bar before Naeher kept out Adriana’s header in stoppage time as the USA secured a third straight 1-0 win to take the title."
