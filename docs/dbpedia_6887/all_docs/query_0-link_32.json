        "text": "Tourdates from Ike and Tina Turner\n\nBy 1958, Ike Turner and his band, the Kings of Rhythm was one of the most popular live performing attractions to the St. Louis and neighboring East St. Louis club scene. Ike had moved there from Memphis in 1954 after work as a talent scout for the Modern and RPM labels. Around this time, a young nurse's assistant named Anna Mae Bullock began frequenting the nightclubs in both St. Louis and East St. Louis with her sister Alline and several friends. One night, Bullock saw Ike and the Kings of Rhythm performing at the East St. Louis club, Club Manhattan. She later stated that the band's performance put her \"in a trance\".\n\nWhile there, Anna began dating a member of Ike's band, saxophonist Raymond Hill. During a band intermission in Club Manhattan, Anna was given a microphone from the band's drummer Gene Washington. Bullock eventually sang along with Ike's band for several songs that night. Going by the stage name \"Little Ann\", Bullock made her recording debut as a background vocalist to Ike's song \"Box Top\", which became a regional single on Tune Town Records. During this period, Ike trained Ann on voice control and performance. In March 1960, singer Art Lassiter was chosen to front the Kings of Rhythm. Ike had written a song for Lassiter he called \"A Fool in Love\". Lassiter failed to show up to record. Having already booked expensive studio time, Ike allowed \"Little Ann\" to sing the song as a \"dummy track\" for Lassiter. The song impressed one radio disk jockey so much that he told Ike to send the record to Sue Records president Juggy Murray.\n\n1956\n\n9 January 1956 - Café Royale, Lake Charles, LA – USA\n\nUpon hearing the track, an impressed Murray bought the musical rights to the song and gave Ike a $20,000 advance for it, convincing Ike to keep Ann's voice on the track. Ike renamed the song's backing female trio \"The Ikettes\" and also gave \"Little Ann\" the name \"Tina Turner\" after being inspired by his favorite television character, Nyoka. He also gave her the name to prevent her from running off with it. In case Ann left, he could give another woman the name of Tina Turner. Including the Kings of Rhythm and the Ikettes singing (and later dancing) trio, the entire troupe performed under the name, \"The Ike and Tina Turner Revue\".\n\n1959\n\n27 October 1959 - Club Imperial, St. Louis, MO - USA\n\n\"A Fool in Love\" became a hit after its release in the late spring of 1960, reaching #2 R&B and #27 on the Billboard Hot 100, selling over a million copies. It was described by Kurt Loder years later in Tina's autobiography I, Tina as \"the blackest record to ever creep the white pop charts since Ray Charles' 'What'd I Say' a year before\". In 1961, the duo reached the top 20 on the pop charts with \"It's Gonna Work Out Fine\", which became the duo's second million-selling single and also garnered them their first Grammy Award nomination.\n\nThe duo would score several R&B charted singles including \"I Idolize You\" and \"Poor Fool\". In between, the personal friendship between Ike and Tina had turned sexual. Ike later described that his first sexual encounter with Tina \"felt like I had screwed my sister or somethin'. I mean I had hoped to die... we really were like brother and sister. It wasn't just her voice... Anyway me and Ann were tight.\"\n\n1960\n\n1 April 1960 - Washington Arena, Washington, DC - USA\n\n6 November 1960 - Filmmore Auditorium, San Francisco, CA – USA\n\n13 November 1960 - Hollywood Palladium, Hollywood, CA – USA\n\nThe entire Revue relocated from East St. Louis to Los Angeles in 1960. Gigging for 300 days a year touring the chitlin' circuit to make up for a lack of hit records put a strain on Tina.\n\n1961\n\n17-23 February 1961 - Howard Theatre, Washington, DC - USA\n\n24 December 1961 - The Auditorium, Klamath Falls, OR - USA\n\nTheir relationship often was combative. Tina claimed in her autobiography that Ike hit her with a shoe stretcher after she complained about monetary issues and her own misgivings about continuing their offstage partnership. According to Tina, they would eventually marry in 1962 in Tijuana, though Ike later disputed the account.\n\n1962\n\n28-30 June 1962 - Fountain Blue Hotel, Miami Beach, FL - USA\n\n1 September 1962 - Mambo Club, Wichita, KS – USA\n\n7 October 1962 - Castle Farms Club, Cincinatti, OH - USA\n\n30 December 1962 - Coconut Grove - Sacramento, CA - USA\n\n1963\n\n19-20 November 1963 - Club Emperial, St. Louis, MO - USA\n\nIn 1964, after months of tense business relations, Ike Turner ended his contract with Juggy Murray and Sue Records. He signed with the Kent label and a year later signed with Warner Bros. Records and its subsidiary Loma Records, where they met Bob Krasnow. Krasnow would begin managing them in 1965.\n\n1964\n\n22-23 March 1964 - Club Handy, Memphis, TN - USA\n\n21 May 1964 - Club Imperial, St. Louis, MO- USA\n\n8 June 1964 - The 49er, El Monte, CA - USA\n\n29 June 1964 - The 49er, El Monte, CA - USA\n\n1 July 1964 - Masonic Temple, Port Angeles, WA - USA\n\n27 July 1964 - The 49er, El Monte, CA - USA\n\n7 October 1964 - Rockland Palace, New York City, NY – USA\n\n16 November 1964 - The 49er, El Monte, CA - USA\n\n27 November 1964 - Old Olympia, Tacoma Highway, WA - USA\n\n7 December 1964 - The 49er, El Monte, CA - USA\n\n9 December 1964 - Ciro’s Le Disc, Hollywood, CA - USA\n\n13 December 1964 - Continental Club, Oakland, CA - USA\n\nThroughout 1965, the Revue promoted their music on rock and roll-themed musical variety series such as American Bandstand, Hollywood A Go-Go and Shindig! as well as the concert film The Big T.N.T. Show. In addition to deals with Kent, Warner and Loma, the Revue would record for seven other labels in a five-year period, through 1969. The Turners' lack of a hit single was sometimes blamed on Ike Turner's limited facility in the studio. With Krasnow, however, that changed. Hit producer Phil Spector soon called Krasnow asking him if he could produce for Ike and Tina, to which Krasnow agreed. Spector forked over $25,000 for the right to record with them, with the intent on creating his \"biggest hit\".\n\nTina recorded the Ellie Greenwich/Jeff Barry composition \"River Deep – Mountain High\" in late 1965. Released in 1966, the song failed to become a hit in the United States. However, in Europe, the song became a hit, reaching the top three in the United Kingdom. Its UK success prompted Spector to state in interviews, \"Benedict Arnold was quite a guy\", in regards to the United States' indifferent reaction to the song. Later that year, The Rolling Stones offered Ike and Tina a chance to be one of their opening acts on their fall tour in the United Kingdom, which they accepted. The duo took the opportunity afterwards to book themselves tours all over Europe and Australia where they attracted audiences. The audiences' appreciation of the band's sound stunned Ike Turner, who noted that \"there wasn't anything like my show.\"\n\nFollowing this, the band returned to the United States in demand despite not having a big hit.\n\n1965\n\n18 Jan. 1965 - The 49er, El Monte, CA - USA\n\n15 February 1965 - The 49er, El Monte, CA - USA\n\n16-20 February 1965 - Skol’s Lounge, Tarzana, CA - USA\n\n21 February 1965 - Filmore Auditorium, San Francisco, CA - USA\n\n25 February 1965 - Los Angeles Valley College, Van Nuys,CA - USA\n\n5-13 March 1965 - Ciro’s Le Disc, Hollywood, CA - USA\n\n22 March 1965 - The 49er, El Monte, CA - USA\n\n20 May 1965 - Club Imperial, St. Louis, MO - USA\n\n6 June 1965 - Carr’s Beach Ballroom, Anapolis, MD - USA\n\n18 Augustus 1965 - Cinnamons Cinder, Long Beach, CA - USA\n\n24-30 September 1965 - Howard Theatre, Washington, DC - USA\n\n2 October 1965 - Convention Hall, New Jersey, NY - USA\n\n9 October 1965 - St. Louis Armory, St. Louis, TN – USA\n\n13 December 1965 - The 49er, El Monte, CA - USA\n\n1966\n\n2 February 1966 - Filmore Auditorium, San Francisco, CA - USA\n\n14 March 1966 - The 49er, El Monte, CA - USA\n\n2 July 1966 - The Coliseum, EL Paso, TX - USA\n\n28 July 1966 - The Limit, Long Beach, CA - USA\n\n31 August 1966 - The Limit, Long Beach, CA - USA\n\n23 September 1966 - Royal Albert Hall, London - UK*\n\n24 September 1966 - Odeon Theatre, Leeds - UK*\n\n25 September 1966 - Empire Theatre, Liverpool - UK*\n\n28 September 1966 - ABC Theatre Ardwick, Manchester UK*\n\n29 September 1966 - ABC Theatre, Stockton - UK*\n\n30 September 1966 - Odeon Theatre, Glasgow, Scotland*\n\n1 October 1966 - City Hall, Newcastle Upon Tyne - UK*\n\n2 October 1966 - Gaumont Theatre, Ipswich - UK*\n\n6 October 1966 - Odeon Theatre, Birmingham - UK*\n\n7 October 1966 - Colston Hall, Bristol - UK*\n\n8 October 1966 - Capitol Theatre, Cardiff - UK*\n\n9 October 1966 - Gaumont Theatre, South Hampton - UK*\n\n14 October 1966 - Tile’s - London - UK\n\n15 October 1966 - Mojo Club - Sheffield - UK\n\n16 October 1966 - Ricky Tick Club, Hounslow , Middlesex - UK\n\n22 October 1966 - California Ballroom, Dunstable - UK\n\n27 November 1966 - Olympia, Washington, DC - USA\n\n8 December 1966 - Civic Playhouse, Wichita, KS – USA\n\n*Opening Act for the Rolling Stones\n\n1967\n\n7 January 1967 - Blue Bunny, Long Beach, CA - USA\n\n17 January 1967 - California Hall - San Francisco, CA - USA\n\n18 January 1967 - The Limit, Long Beach, CA - USA\n\n3 February 1967 -Lazy X Night Club, San Francisco, CA -USA\n\n26 April 1967 - The Limit, Long Beach, CA - USA\n\n1 May 1967 - The 49er, El Monte, CA - USA\n\n9 June 1967 – Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles, CA – USA*\n\n22-23 June 1967 - Pink Carousel, Downey, CA - USA\n\n6 July 1967 - Calderon Ballroom, Phoenix, AZ - USA\n\n15 July 1967 - Coliseum Ballroom, BENLD, IL - USA\n\n22-24 September 1967 - Phelps Lounge, Detroit, MI - USA\n\n30 September 1967 - Coliseum, BENLD, IL - USA\n\n13 November 1967 - The 49er, El Monte, CA - USA\n\n13 December 1967 - The Limit, Long Beach, CA - USA\n\n24 December 1967 - Civic Center, Oklahoma City, OK - USA\n\n27 December 1967 - Civic Center - Oklahoma City, OK - USA\n\n* Opening Act for the Monkees\n\nBy 1968, they were performing and headlining in Las Vegas. That year, they signed with Blue Thumb Records and released the first of two albums with them, the first of which, Outta Season, included their modest hit cover of \"I've Been Loving You Too Long\" (a song originally sung and written by Otis Redding). The second Blue Thumb release, The Hunter, followed in 1969, and included their modest hit cover of the Albert King hit as well as an original composition titled \"Bold Soul Sister\". Tina's rendition of \"The Hunter\" led to the singer receiving her first solo Grammy nomination in 1970. Prior to the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, Ike had lived a teetotal, drug and alcohol free life. Following the success of the Revue, however, Ike began smoking marijuana and, later, cocaine, after being introduced the drug by, he says, \"two famous Las Vegas headliners\". In 1968, after another violent confrontation with Ike, Tina bought 50 Valiums and swallowed them all in an attempt to end her life before a show in Los Angeles; Tina eventually recovered.\n\n1968\n\n13 January 1968 - Oakland Auditorium - Oakland, CA - USA\n\n14 January 1968 - California Hall - San Francisco, CA - USA\n\n14 January 1968 - Lazy X Night Club, San Francisco, CA - USA\n\n26-28 January 1968 - Both/and Club - San Francisco, CA - USA\n\n5 Febr. 1968 - The 49er, El Monte, CA - USA\n\n23-24 February 1968 - Cheetah Club, Venice, CA - USA\n\n7 March 1968 - The Limit, Long Beach, CA - USA\n\n20 March 1968 - H.O.T Fair, Waco, TX - USA\n\n28 March – 3 April 1968 - Phelps Lounge, Detroit, MI - USA\n\n19 April 1968 - California Ballroom, Dunstable - UK\n\n20 April 1968 - Middle Earth - London - UK\n\n20 April 1968 - Starlight Ballroom, Boston - UK\n\n20 April 1968 - Gliderdrome - Boston - UK\n\n24 April 1968 - Locarno - London - UK\n\n26 April 1968 - Royal Theatre - Tottenham - UK\n\n27 April 1968 - Twisted Wheel Club, Manchester - UK\n\n1 May 1968 - Mistrale Club - Kent - UK\n\n5 May 1968 - Concertgebouw, Amsterdam - The Netherlands\n\n5 May 1968 - De Doelen, Rotterdam - Netherlands\n\n14 May 1968 - Club Imperial, St. Louis, MO - USA\n\n7 June 1968 - Muncie Armory, Indianapolis, IN - USA\n\n8 June 1968 - Benld Coliseum, Benld, IL - USA\n\n25-29 June 1968 - The Golden Bear, Huntington Beach, CA - USA\n\n12-14 July 1968 - Filmore West, San Francisco, CA - USA\n\n19-20 July 1968 - Cheetah Club - Venice, CA - USA\n\n27 July 1968 - Shelby County Fairgrounds, Shelbina, MO - USA\n\n27 July 1968 - Convention Hall, San Diego, CA - USA\n\n2-4 August 1968 - Shrine Hall, Los Angeles, CA - USA\n\n11 August 1968 - Coatham Hotel, Redcar - UK\n\n13 August 1968 - Victoria Ballroom, Chesterfield - UK\n\n17 August 1968 - Imperial Ballroom, Nelson - UK\n\n27-29 September 1968 - The Showcase Theater, Oakland, CA - USA\n\n17-19 October 1968 - The Limit, Long Beach, CA - USA\n\n9 November 1968 - Coliseum Ballroom, Benld, IL - USA\n\n15 November 1968 - Phelps Lounge, Detroit, MI – USA\n\nA second opening spot on The Rolling Stones' American tour in November 1969 made Ike and Tina a hot item.

The title track, a cover of the famed Beatles song, charted, as did their cover of Sly and the Family Stone's \"I Want to Take You Higher\", which became their first top 40 pop song in eight years, peaking at #25, placing several spots higher than Sly's original had done months earlier. The album would sell a quarter of a million copies. That same year, Ike and Tina appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show. Their successful records and increasing popularity with mainstream audiences increased their nightly fee, going from $1,000 a night to $5,000 a night.\n\n1970\n\n1-2 January 1970 - Newport Resort Motel, Miami, FL - USA\n\n9-10 January 1970 - Filmore East, New York, NY - USA\n\n25 February 1970 - Pine Aerodome, Auburn, KY - USA\n\n22 March 1970 - University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL - USA\n\n29 March 1970 - Madison Square Garden, New York, NY - USA\n\n29 March 1970 - Bithlo, Orlando, FL - USA\n\n9 April 1970 Centenary College, Shreveport, LA - USA\n\n24 April 1970 - Anaheim convention Center, Anaheim, CA - USA\n\n25 April 1970 - Selland Arena, Fresno, CA - USA\n\n26 April 1970 - UCLA, Los Angeles, CA - USA\n\n29 April 1970 Chico State College, Chico, CA - USA\n\n30 April 1970 University of Nevada, Reno, NV - USA\n\n2 May 1970 - Swing Auditorium, San Bernadino, CA - USA\n\n3 May 1970 - Berkley Community Theatre, Berkley, CA - USA\n\n6 May 1970 - Western Washington State College, Bellingham, WA - USA\n\n7 May 1970 - Pacific Lutheran College, Tacoma, WA - USA\n\n8 May 1970 - Seattle Center Arena, Seattle, WA - USA\n\n9 May 1970 - Agradome, Vancouver, BC - Canada\n\n13 May 1970 - Central Washington State College, Ellensburg, WA - USA\n\n14 May 1970 - ASISU Mini-Dome, Pocatello, ID - USA\n\n15 May 1970 - Cal State Hayward, San Francisco, CA - USA\n\n16 May 1970 - Spartan Stadium, San Jose, CA - USA\n\n23 May 1970 - Denver Coliseum, Denver, CO - USA\n\n26-27 May 1970 - Mill Run Theatre, Niles, IL - USA\n\n28 May 1970 - Bush Stadium, Indianapolis, IN - USA\n\n13 June 1970 - Waikiki Shell, Honolulu, HI - USA\n\n13 June 1970 - Atlanta Braves Stadium - Georgia - USA\n\n19 June 1970 - Cow Palace, Daly City, CA - USA\n\n22 June 1970 - Harvard Stadium, Cambridge, MA - USA\n\n27 June 1970 - Euphoria Ballroom, San Rafael, CA - USA\n\n1-5 July 1970 – King’s Castle Hotel – North Lake Tahoe, CA - USA\n\n8 July 1970 - Honka Monka Club, New York City, NY - USA\n\n10 July 1970 - Music Circus, Lambertville, NJ - USA\n\n11 July 1970 - Newport Jazz, Newport, RI - USA\n\n12 July 1970 - Music Inn, Lenox, MA - USA\n\n13 July 1970 - Wollman Skating Rink, New York, NY - USA\n\n13 July 1970 - Central Park, New York, NY - USA\n\n15 July 1970 - Harvard Stadium, Cambridge, MA - USA\n\n16-22 July 1970 - The Raquet Club, Hyannis, MA - USA\n\n7-9 Aug. 1970 - The An Arbor Blues Festival - Ann Arbor, MI - USA.

The former album, consisting of country songs, resulted in Tina receiving her second Grammy solo nomination, while the latter album was released to build on the hype of Tina's well received performance in the musical film version of The Who's Tommy.\n\n1973\n\n5 January 1973 - Civic Arena, Pittsburgh, PA - USA 3 February 1973 - Bolic Sound Studio’s, Los Angeles, CA - USA\n\n11 February 1973 - Hic Auditorium - Honolulu, HI - USA\n\n25 February 1973 - PNE Agrodome - Vancouver, BC - Canada\n\n8 April 1973 - Catawba College - Salisbury, NC - USA\n\n11 April 1973 - Capitol Theater, Porchester, NY - USA\n\n12 April 1973 - Bridgewater State College - Bridgewater, MA - USA\n\n13 April 1973 - Civic Center - Springfield, MA - USA\n\n14 April 1973 - New Brunswick State Theater - New Brunswick, NJ - USA\n\n15 April 1973 - Nassau Community College - Hempstead, NY - USA\n\n17-22 April 1973 - Marco Polo Motel, Miami Beach, FL - USA\n\n26 May 1973 - Toronto - Canada\n\n9 June 1973 - Long Beach Auditorium Arena - Long Beach, CA - USA\n\n15 June 1973 - Mobile Muncipal Auditorium - Mobile, AL - USA\n\n17 June 1973 - Masonic Auditorium - Detroit, MI - USA\n\n2-8 July 1973 - Marco Polo Motel, Miami Beach, FL - USA\n\n12 July 1973 - Muncipal Auditorium - Atlanta, GA - USA\n\n13 July 1973 - Mid-South Coliseum - Memphis, TN - USA\n\n14 July 1973 - Muncipal Auditorium - Huntsville, AL - USA\n\n15 July 1973 - Memorial Auditorium - Greenville, SC - USA\n\n16 July 1973 - Charlotte, NC - USA\n\n27 July 1973 - Oakland Auditorium, Oakland, CA - USA\n\n28 July 1973 - Dane County Coliseum - Madison, WI - USA\n\n18 August 1973 - Capitol Theater - Portchester, NY - USA\n\n19 August 1973 - Philharmonic Hall - New York, NY - USA\n\n21 August 1973 - National Shrine of Our Lady of the Snows - Belleville, IL - USA\n\n22 August 1973 - Music Park - Cincinatti, OH - USA\n\n26 August 1973 - Spectrum, Philadelphia, PA - USA\n\n31 August 1973 - Monticello Raceway, Monticello, NY - USA\n\n1 September 1973 - Monticello Raceway, Monticello, NY - USA\n\n2-3 September 1973 - Arie Crown Theatre, Chicago, IL - USA\n\n4 September 1973 - Knoxville, TN - USA\n\n7 September 1973 - Macon, GA - USA\n\n27 September 1973 - Portland Memorial Coliseum, Portland, OR - USA\n\n28-29 September 1973 - Oil Can Harry’s, Vancouver - Canada\n\n10 October 1973 - State Teachers College, Valdosta, GA - USA\n\n12 October 1973 - University of South Dakota, Vermillion, SD - USA\n\n14 October 1973 - Seattle Center Arena, Seattle, WA - USA\n\n26 October 1973 - Hearst Greek Theatre, Berkley, CA - USA\n\n26 October 1973 - Murray State College, Murray, KY - USA\n\n28 October 1973 - Union College, Schenectady, NY - USA\n\n27 October 1973 - Sunny Brockport, Brockport, NY - USA\n\n1 November 1973 - Jackson State University, Jacksonville, AL - USA\n\n2 November 1973 - Jonesboro State College, Jonesboro, AR - USA\n\n8 November 1973 - Philipshalle, Düsseldorf - Germany\n\n10 November 1973 - Jahrhunderthalle, Frankfurt - Germany\n\n12 November 1973 - Sporthalle, Cologne - Germany\n\n13 November 1973 - Deutschlandhalle - Berlin- Germany\n\n18 November 1973 Wembley Pool, London - UK\n\n22 November 1973 - Schwarzwaldhalle - Karlsruhe - Germany\n\n23 November 1973 - Odeon Theatre - London - UK\n\n30 November 1973 Fresno College, Fresno, CA - USA\n\n13-26 December 1973 - Flamingo Hotel, Las Vegas, NV - USA\n\nThe duo's work on their 1974 album, The Gospel According to Ike & Tina, led to the duo receiving several Grammy nominations.

During this time, Ike was spending more time at Bolic Sound than he was with Tina and their children at their home in Inglewood. Tina Turner, meanwhile, had looked inward to alleviate her own problems and soon found solace after a friend introduced her to the teachings of Buddhism. In July 1976, Ike intended on signing a five-year contract with a new record company, Cream Records, for a reported yearly amount of $150,000. The contract had a key person clause, meaning Ike would have to sign the contract in four days, keeping Tina tied to Ike for five more years.\n\nOn the 2nd of July 1976 The Ike and Tina Turner Revue traveled by plane to Dallas where they were to perform at the Dallas Statler Hilton. While on the airplane, the two became embroiled in an altercation, which led to a physical fight in their limousine.The duo presented different accounts as to what went on that day. Ike accused Tina of being negligent to help him with a nose bleed due to constant cocaine. Tina claimed Ike was annoyed that Tina was eating chocolates while wearing an all-white outfit, causing Ike to slap her. The couple agreed, however, that Ike had been up for five days straight on a cocaine binge. Following Ike's slap, Tina recalled fighting him back, scratching him and kicking him. Ike Turner alleged to a musician associate friend that the two \"went around like prizefighters for awhile\". Both Ike and Tina were bleeding by the time they arrived at the hotel. After going up to their suite, Ike retired to a sofa. Once Ike had fallen asleep, Tina grabbed a few toiletries, covered herself and escaped from the back of the hotel, running across an active freeway before stopping at a local Ramada Inn hotel. She claimed that she later hid at several friends' homes for a time. On the 27th of July 1976, Tina Turner filed for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.\n\nIke and Tina fought for a year in divorce court arguing over money and property. By late 1977, Tina decided to stop her pursuit of any financial earnings including an apartment complex in Anaheim and another apartment, stating to her lawyer that her freedom \"was more important\". Tina also agreed to retain only the use of her stage name. The divorce proceedings ended in November 1977 and was finalized March 1978. She also agreed to pay a significant IRS lien.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nIke & Tina Turner\n\nAlbums Ike & Tina Turner\n\n7 Inch Singles Ike & Tina Turner\n\nDVD Ike & Tina Turner\n\nLP Ike & Tina Turner\n\nTourdates Ike & Tina Turner"
