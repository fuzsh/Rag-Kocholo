        "text": "Counterfeit Records in the 1940s\n\n(and Beyond)\n\nBy Allan Sutton\n\nA likely Savoy counterfeit. Pressed on poor-quality material and bearing a suspiciously fuzzy-looking label, its inner margin lacks identifying markings and has a run-out that differs markedly from those found on genuine Savoy discs.\n\nPiracy of sound recordings existed virtually from the beginning of the commercial recording industry, but counterfeiting was a different matter. Whereas early pirated discs usually were issued under different labels than those from which they were copied, counterfeits were made to look like the genuine item, right down to the label artwork. Outright counterfeiting of discs was rare during the American record industry’s early years.\n\nWidespread counterfeiting began to run rampant during the postwar phonograph boom of the late 1940s, helped along by the proliferation of dubbing services and small independent pressing plants eager for business of any sort. Adding to the problem was the reluctance of distributors, dealers, and jukebox operators to ask questions when offered records at far less than market prices.\n\nRumors of counterfeiting operations had been circulating since the war’s end, primarily victimizing small start-up labels. Billboard reported,\n\nLarge firms whose distribution coverage is big enough to blanket a hit-demand market in rapid order have rarely run into bootleggers. Small firms suddenly beset by rush calls for their items have been more fruitful targets for the illicit copies. [1]\n\nThe first major case broke in Chicago during the autumn of 1947, after Tower Records president Richard Bradley discovered that distributors and retailers had ample supplies of a newly released hit by Jack Owens, even though production was bottlenecked at Towers’ pressing plants. His suspicions were further aroused after discovering that the pressings were being handled by an unlicensed distributor. After ruling out theft from his own plants as the source, Bradley contacted Treasury Department officials in Chicago, who agreed to investigate the case because of the potential loss of federal excise tax on those sales.\n\nThe start of the second American Federation of Musicians’ recording ban in December 1948 was widely viewed as an open invitation to piracy. Several weeks before the ban took effect, band leader Bob Crosby (whose Decca contract had recently expired) was called by an unnamed individual wanting Crosby to slip him a radio transcription, presumably for processing into black-market records. [2] The larger problem, however, remained the counterfeiting of existing, legitimate commercial releases.\n\nDuring the spring of 1948, the investigation expanded to Los Angeles, where an interstate counterfeiting ring was thought to be operating. Paul Reiner, the president of Black & White Records, had recently discovered counterfeit Black & White and Jewel pressings on which no master numbers were visible. Variety reported,\n\nThere are dozens of indie plants in this area that will job-lot anything handed to them to work on, with no questions asked. Reps of legit firms are convinced that as many as 40,000 copies of hits tunes are surreptitiously turned out weekly and fed into the various record markets in competition with bonafide platters, at 25¢ a copy… Al Katz, who handled distribution here on “Near You” for Bullet records, claims he has knowledge of at least 5,000 copies of that tune which didn’t originate with him.” [3]\n\nIn short order, counterfeit pressings bearing Aladdin, King, National, Savoy, and Specialty labels were also identified throughout the Los Angeles area.\n\nUnlike the earlier record pirates, who usually produced masters by electroplating commercial pressings, most postwar counterfeiters favored electrical dubbing, leading Bob Hope to quip, “What’s crime coming to? Somehow I can’t picture a masked figure running down the street at 2 a.m. with a smoking revolver in one hand and a wire recorder in the other.” [4] Printing plates were produced from photographic copies of the originals labels, often resulting in a less-than-crisp appearance.\n\nIn some cases, the counterfeit pressings were wholesaled for as little as 25¢, a strong signal that they were not legitimate. “Dealers know this is going on,” the Los Angeles Daily News reported, “‘but what are we going to do,’ one asked. ‘We get the same record for 15 cents less—naturally we make more money on it.’” [5]\n\nAnd so the battle initially was taken to distributors and dealers who were handling the counterfeits. In April 1948 Miracle Records, a small Chicago producer, secured a temporary restraining order against the Millner Record Sales Company, alleging that Millner was selling “inferior reproductions of Miracle’s original hits [bearing] counterfeit labels.” [6]\n\nSubsequent investigation revealed that Millner had no hand in producing the counterfeit discs, and was an unwitting accomplice in their distribution. In a sworn deposition, Millner executive Milton Saul identified A. M. Wolfe, Forrest (War) Perkins, and Perkins’ Day Distributing Company (which operated its own pressing plant) as the source of the bogus discs. Saul testified that he had ordered shipments to stop once he was informed by Miracle that the pressings were counterfeit. [7] On July 19, the case against Millner was dismissed. [8]\n\nSavoy warns against purchasing\n\ncounterfeit records (May 1948)\n\nShortly after Miracle filed its lawsuit, Savoy Records’ Herman Lubinsky declared that a Los Angeles ring had turned out a million counterfeit copies of Savoy hits in recent months. [9] [10] On an expected sale of 250,000 Black & White records, the Los Angeles Daily News reported, only 10,000 discs were said to be genuine. [11]\n\nBillboard reported that the Los Angeles rings so far were focusing exclusively on race records, peddling the counterfeit pressings in “neighborhoods where such records would be in high demand.” But the discovery in early 1948 of a counterfeit Decca record by Louis Jordan in a Central Avenue record store offered the first clue that mainstream hits on major labels were now being counterfeited as well. [12] One reporter noted, “[Decca] officials, in the fit of coy shyness which occasionally afflicts Hollywood citizens, don’t like the fact bruited about.” [13]\n\nIn early April, a group of Capitol, Columbia, Decca, and RCA Victor executives gathered in Capitol’s Hollywood office, where they agreed to help underwrite an investigation. [14] At the same time, unscrupulous distributors and dealers were proving to be so successful at selling counterfeit copies that one record-company official reportedly considered letting them handle his legitimate output. [15]\n\nWar Perkins proved to be of particular interest to various investigators. Although Perkins ran a legitimate operation, it was not the first time he had been accused of producing and selling illicit goods. In January 1948, he had been sued by band leader Roy Milton for issuing two sides by Milton’s Solid Senders that were dubbed from radio broadcasts without Milton’s knowledge or consent. [16], [17] However, Perkins denied having any connection with the Miracle case, or any knowledge of the counterfeit records’ source, which was widely rumored to be a pressing plant in Paris, Texas.\n\nThe only pressing plant operating at the time in Paris, Texas, was the Swing Record Manufacturing Company, a small start-up owned by Jimmy Mercer (née Harry Schaefer, a.k.a. Jivin’ Joe Jackson). His checkered past included a 1928 conviction for robbery and forgery, and allegedly, a 1931 arrest for passing bad checks. By the mid-1940s, Mercer had moved to Paris, where he worked at radio station KPLT, operated the Melody Lane Record Shop, and gave piano lessons. Mercer is perhaps the best-documented example of a small-time entrepreneur whose output simultaneously included original, pirated, and counterfeit records.\n\n(Left) A 1946 advertisement for Jimmy Mercer’s record shop. (Right) Mercer at his record press, which he claimed could produce 2,700 records per day.\n\nThe October 1946 launch of Mercer’s Swing Records was well covered in the local press. The Paris News devoted a feature story to the company in November, at which time Mercer invited local artists to audition for his new Swing and Downbeat labels (the latter having no connection to DownBeat magazine). [18] Mercer’s records were pressed on poor-quality recycled scrap and bore equally shoddy labels. He regularly solicited broken records in the local want-ads, along with “strong active women” to work the night shift at his plant. [19]\n\nAlthough Mercer claimed to be pressing for several “well known” (but undisclosed) labels, his only confirmed connection with the established companies consisted of pirating their discs. He is known to have copied recordings from Atlantic, Cow Town, Freedom, 4 Star, Gold Star, and other labels, which he then issued on his own labels. Gold Star’s Bill Quinn sued Mercer, then settled out of court after Mercer agreed to purchase some masters from the company. Atlantic Records reportedly threatened legal action as well.\n\nIt was Mercer’s party-record pressings (some on the Zest and Zip labels, others lacking any brand name) rather than his pirating and counterfeiting activities, that eventually brought him to the attention of federal authorities. In March 1949, he was arrested and charged with delivering obscene records for shipment across state lines. He pled guilty to two counts in January 1950, and was sentenced to three years’ probation.\n\nMercer’s arrest marked the end of his involvement with the record business. With few other offenders apprehended, the investigation into record counterfeiting wound down in the early 1950s, causing the problem to worsen considerably. By September 1951, Billboard was reporting that one operation in the New York area, which had so far eluded all efforts at detection, was believed to be pressing more than 50,000 counterfeit discs weekly. [20]\n\nRecord counterfeiting would continue unabated into the LP era, even as attempts to locate and prosecute the perpetrators were becoming increasingly successful. In November 1960, thirty-five detectives and police officers raided a major counterfeiting operation in North Hollywood, California, arresting Brad Atwwood (who was already under indictment in New Jersey) and six others. [21]\n\nRev. Richard Engel and partners in crime, May 1961. The lower photo was taken at the time of their arrest in New York.\n\nOne of the highest-profile busts of the LP era involved Rev. Richard Engel, an ordained Evangelical minister and owner of Bibletone Records. In May 1961, Engel and his associates were arrested while celebrating a new counterfeit-record deal over drinks at New York’s Plaza Hotel. An informant had identified them as the heads of an East Coast operation accused of pressing more than 50,000 bootleg Frank Sinatra albums, among other offences. Engel was charged with grand larceny, conspiracy to commit grand larceny, and conspiracy to violate trademark laws. [22]\n\nThe reverend and his cronies were a major catch, but they would not be the last, by any means.\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] “Tower Calls on T-Men to Trace Bootleg Discs.” Billboard (November 15, 1947), p. 20.\n\n[2] “Black Market Ready to Take Over the Discs.” Elyria Chronicle-Telegram (December 15, 1947), p. 7.\n\n[3] “Major Diskers Crack Down on Coast Bootlegging of Hit Recordings.” Variety (April 7, 1948), p. 42.\n\n[4] Hope, Bob. “It Says Here.” Winona Republican-Herald (March 29, 1949). p. 4.\n\n[5] “Counterfeit Records Turned Out in L.A.” Los Angeles Daily News (July 27, 1948), p. 17.\n\n[6] “Bogus Records for Phonographs Charged in Suit.” St. Louis Globe-Democrat (April 23, 1948), p. 6.\n\n[7] “Saul, Perkins Depositions Clash as Court Probes Miracle Claims vs. Millner on Bogus Wax Charge.” Billboard (July 17, 1948), pp. 3–4.\n\n[8] “Court Clears Millner Co. of All Bogus Disk Charges.” Billboard (August 21, 1948), p. 37.\n\n[9] Ibid.\n\n[10] “Attention!
