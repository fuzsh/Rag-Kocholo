        "text": "Back in 2006, Jimmy Melton, Kevin 'Swine' Grantt and I went to Alabama to play a show for Roger Murrah. That afternoon during soundcheck, Jimmy started pulling out some old country tunes that we all grew up listening to and playing. We were having such a blast playing them that we came to one conclusion: we need to put together a band that plays this country music! Such is the beginning of 45 RPM.\n\nOur good friend Cyndi Forman, who is Senior VP, A&R at Universal Music Publishing Group, also loves traditional country music and played a big part in helping us put things in motion. We started playing Douglas Corner, a historic club/showcase room in Nashville and we played there for a number of years. We hosted tribute nights, bringing in Connie Smith, Norro Wilson, Garth Fundis, and Sonny Throckmorton. We could always count on country music icons dropping by to sit in with us. Some of those included Gene Watson, Jamey Johnson, Tanya Tucker, Matraca Berg, Jon Pardi, Eddie Montgomery and the list goes on and on! We've even played some private shows and music industry parties where folks like Brad Paisley, Chris Stapleton, Alison Krauss and Radney Foster got up and sang and picked with us.\n\nOur time at Douglas Corner was great, but we felt like it had run its course. Some of the members from the original band werenât able to play with us anymore. Kevin had to bow out due to his wifeâs illness and Hank Singer had moved to Texas. We werenât sure that we would even continue 45 RPM. Thatâs when I got a call from Ann Soyars. She was booking The Station Inn, a world famous venue known for its bluegrass music. She told me their 'country band', The Time Jumpers were moving to a different venue and asked if we would be interested in bringing our band to The Station Inn. It was an honor to get the call, and I told her we would love to! The Station Inn, being more of a listening room, inspired us to revamp a few things, do some rehearsing, put our own arrangements to some of these classic songs, and we've been playing there since 2013.\n\nOn any given night, you might see Joe Nichols or Martina McBride, along with our friends from 'Country's Family Reunion' and 'Larry's Country Diner', Teea Goans, Mo Pitney, Linda Davis or Ben Hall.Â We always look forward to our super talented friend, Rhonda Vincent coming by to sing a tune or two. A 45 RPM show is a gathering place for music industry folks and fellow musicians as well as traditional country music lovers from around the world.\n\n45 RPM consists of some of the finest studio musicians, producers and most incredible singers and songwriters in the world. Our band is all about the great old songs. We pay tribute to the integrity of the records that we all love so much and also add the '45 RPM' touch to them. We try to make every song interesting, both vocally and musically. We make our living playing, singing, writing, producing and engineering a variety of music, but with all our hearts, we still love playing this timeless country music.\n\nOn behalf of 45 RPM, we want to say thank you to all who have supported us over the years.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Mike Johnson"
