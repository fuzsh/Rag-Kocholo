        "text": "Is there an equalization for old 78 RPM records? They are pre RIAA standard and can vary by company. My records are RCA Red label. In the Audio Cleaning Lab upgrade ad I thought that I saw a screen shot showing a selection for \"Legacy\" equalization but cannot find such a setting in ACL or Music Maker. Software is current version running on a Windows 10 laptop.\n\n@Raymond-Compton\n\nHi,\n\nI have Sound Forge Audio Cleaning Lab 1, not the current version 2. I think that you are referring to the Sound Cloner/FFT Filter in which there is a preset for \"Record player equalization (RIAA)\" I don't see anything for pre RIAA or 78 RPM records.\n\nCan you point us to the specific screen?\n\nYou can always download the trial version and try it yourself.\n\nDo you have an older version, and if so, which one?\n\nJohn CB\n\nWhat I think that I saw saw was the ad for version 2 with a collage of screen shots and one showed what must have been presets and one was clearly labeled for 78's and something like \"Legacy\". Since that ad was for an upgrade to version 2 and now, only days later, version 3 is being advertised the previous ad is gone. It was that screen shot that prompted me to upgrade to version 2. I did not pay close attention since I assumed that I would find that preset within the program. Needless to say, if I had known that version 3 was only days away, I would have skipped version 2 and gone directly to version 3. Anyway, I have been using this since \"Audio Cleaning Lab 3.0\" from 2003.\n\n@Raymond-Compton\n\nHi,\n\nIt was probably a screen shot of what I mentioned.\n\nI suggest that you ask Magix for a refund and/or apply it to the new version. There should be a 14 day return period.\n\nThat said, I don't really see anything in the new version that would entice me to upgrade from SFACL1. The Wizard FX Suite looks like a new wrapping of the essentialFX suite or 64bit version of cFX. And, I have iZotope RX8 Elements and don't need the other stuff. Interesting, though, and nice to see that Magix is trying to improve the software.\n\nJohn CB\n\n@browj2\n\nHi John.\n\nI have iZotope Vinyl. I'm sure you know it's designed to \"add\" vinyl noise, of various types, to \"modern\", clean recordings. The latest version also has, for me, the annoying behaviour of \"working\" (i.e. producing its \"noise\") even when playback is stopped (I'm pursuing that direct with iZotope.) Hence, I'm really not sure why it would be of interest to the OP???\n\nJeff"
