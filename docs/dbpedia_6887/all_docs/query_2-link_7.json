        "text": "I bought an LP record from a local library and back home turned it on to hear it. And I get very funny voice like somebody is on helium.\n\nI thought I had it on 45 and wanted to switch to 33, but it was on 33. After some fiddling with my player thinking something is wrong with it, I still hear the fast speaking. Then I look at the label it says 16⅔. I have never heard of such a thing!\n\nIs there any way one can still play this record on a turntable that only has 33 and 45 speeds, or should I try to find something even more ancient that also has 16⅔? I thought my equipment was tyrannosaurus-age, but there is clearly something that predates that!\n\nWhile 16⅔ RPM might be rare, some DJ turntables have a pitch adjustment going as low as -50% (also known as ultrapitch). Note that \"33\" is really 33⅓, so 16⅔ is exactly half of it. A turntable set to \"33\" with pitch -50% would play the record correctly. But that might be an expensive way just to play one record.\n\nConsider playing back the record at 33 speed, recording it on a computer, and slowing it down by 50%. You can do it using a free editor such as Audacity.\n\nanswered Feb 12, 2023 at 2:25\n\nuser1079505user1079505\n\n29111 silver badge66 bronze badges\n\nIf you have access to a manual or some online resources for your record player, you should be able to find a speed adjustment screw somewhere on the unit. I'm sure it differs greatly from unit to unit, but on mine, it requires a fairly precision flathead screwdriver to turn it. Turning the screw clockwise should raise the speed on all settings, and counterclockwise should slow it down.\n\nYou can use a strobe or turntable rpm app to fine-tune it to run at 16 2/3 when set at 33. The purpose of the screw is to correct the rpm in cases of it becoming off, so I wouldn't fiddle around with it too much outside of its designed purpose.\n\nHope this helps."
