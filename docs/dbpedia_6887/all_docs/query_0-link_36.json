        "text": "IKE & TINA: Album (Live)\n\nLive - The Ike & Tina Turner Show (1965)\n\nLive - The Ike & Tina Turner Show was shortly released after the album Revue Live from Kent Records. Warner Bros. Records acquired the rights to this similar recording by the label-hopping duo and quickly countered with this album, which reached the top ten of the R&B charts in February 1965, making it the very first album for Ike & Tina on the American charts. The recording is very raw with vocal performances from Tina, The Ikettes and the Kings of Rhythm. It was recorded live at the Skyliner Ballroom (Fort Worth, Texas) and the Lovall's Ballroom (Dallas, Texas). The UK release contains the extra track Tell Her I’m Not Home, which was a single the same year. Some month later, Warner put out the sequel with Volume 2 on it’s Loma subsidiary. The album was re-issued under the different titles On Stage in England (1970) and Something Got A Hold On Me in America (1971).\n\nProducer: Robert A. âBumps\" Blackwell\n\nPhotographer: Bell\n\nRelease: 1965 / 1966 (UK) / Various (Reissue)\n\nLabel: Warner / Various (Reissue)\n\nFormat: Vinyl / CD\n\nCharts: USA: #8 (R&B)\n\nBillboard - February 06, 1965\n\nThe husband and wife team have hit with a few pop and r&b hits in the past. Their hits have always been exciting. Here they go the same route with a pounding, driving, wailing sound. Chorus and big brass, plus hubby, give Tina's wailing great support.\n\nCashBox - February 20, 1965\n\nThe hearty rhythm and blues sound of Ike and Tina Turner should sell up a storm among their fans on this new set from Warner Brothers. The 'live' taping was made at two separate shows, and exhibits all the drive and verve that has made the pair popular for many years. Guesting on the set are Jimmy Thomas, Vanetta Fields and Jessie Smith. Great soul sounds include: âSomething's Got A Hold On Me,â âYou Are My Sunshine,â and âTwist And Shout.â There should be no trouble in marketing this platter in r&b areas, and it could well grab some pop exposure."
