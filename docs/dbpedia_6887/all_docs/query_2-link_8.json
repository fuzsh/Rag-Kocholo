        "text": "I've always heard that it was Fannie Mae byBuster Brown (on the Fire label outta NYC), released in summer or fall of 1959. I know that What'd I Say by Ray Charles (Atlantic 2031) was released in July of '59. So does anyone know of any US 78s released after Fannie Mae?\n\nJuly of '59 sounds about right for the last commercially sold 78 in the USA,however some labels,Atlantic was one,continued to press78 for jukeboxes into late 1960 or early 1961.78s this late were pressed in very small quantity,maybe a few dozen copies each.\n\nA few DOZEN copies of some of my favorite-ever records?!?!?! Something else I have to find!\n\nI know about India as I've seen Beatles 78s. I've never heard one, though, but I bet they sound amazing.\n\nI'm reasonably confident that in the UK library music for film and TV continued to be released on 78 even after commercial labels had stopped doing so, apparently studios didn't want to invest in new gear until they had to, was that the case in the States or with more money did they abandon the format sooner in US studios?\n\nAccording to this site:\n\nHistory of Phonograph Record Technology- The 78 RPM disc »\n\nThe date of the very last 78-rpm record is not known, although some claim that the last one issued in the U.S. was Chuck Berry's \"Too Pooped to Pop \" (Chess 1747), released in February 1960.\n\n\"I Only Have Eyes For You\" by the Flamingos is among the last that were commercially available in the US (mid-1959). I've only ever seen one copy and it had a very fat price tag.\n\nDepends on what 'last' you have in mind. As far as major label standard issues, two that come to mind include 'I got stung'/'One night' by Elvis on RCA Victor 20-7420, and 'Instant love'/'Everybody loves a lover' by Doris Day on Columbia 41195. A story in BILLBOARD claims sales figures for 'Twilight time' by the Platters (98.2% were 45s, the remaining 1.8% 78) was what led them to make it the last one Mercury produced (71289). All of those were in 1958. Labels like Chess and Atlantic produced 78s into 1959 or very early 1960. Children's records were regularly on 78 for several more years....Disneyland's last known 78 was a record of 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' in very late 1964, and somewhere I have an unplayable copy of 'Do-re-mi' on one of those Peter Pan records, and that dates from 1965.\n\nI have it as well. Have you got the John Zorn one?\n\nThere were probably lots of 78 singles issued on R&B/gospel labels in the USA in 1960. Tefteller had a couple in a recent auction. Brownie McGhee & Sonny Terry on Old Town 1075:\n\nJohn Tefteller's June 11th Sabis auction: All original 78's! R&B, Blues, Rock & Roll, Rockabilly, Gospel & Country, with pictures, page 4 »\n\nThough I'd be careful with his dating. I've caught him dating some 1959 78s as being from 1960.\n\nThere are some Duke 78s from 1960 I think. Perhaps a few from Chess.\n\nThey are not easy to find, but I seriously doubt only \"a few dozen\" were pressed of 1960 78s. That would be too expensive to justify pressing. I'd think at least 300 were pressed of any 78s coming out in '60.\n\nThis doesn't include novelty, children, educational and non-commercial \"no interest\" records that continued to be pressed into the early-to-mid '60s.\n\n263. Lavern Baker — \"Shake A Hand/Manana\" Atlantic 2048 M- Super late one on 78 rpm format from 1960!!!! MB $100\n\n267. Chuck Berry — \"Let It Rock/Too Pooped To Pop\" Chess 1747 VG+ THE LAST CHUCK BERRY 78 FROM 1960. First and ONLY copy I've had. Saw one other copy decades ago but that is it!!! Don't miss this one!!! MB $250\n\nJohn Tefteller's Sabis March 8th auction: All original 78's! R&B, Blues, Rock & Roll, Rockabilly, Gospel & Country, with pictures, page 4 »\n\n282. Irma Thomas — \"Set Me Free/Don't Mess With My Man\" Ron 328 MINT RARE!!!!! 1960 78!!! MB $200\n\n342. Randy Newman — \"The Beehive State/I Think It's Going To Rain Today\" Reprise 0284 MINT WHITE LABEL PROMO pressed on thin VINYL from 1972 when Warner Brothers made a brief attempt to revive the 78 rpm speed MB $100\n\nJohn Tefteller's December 1st Sabis auction: All original 78's! R&B, Blues, Rock & Roll, Rockabilly, Gospel & Country Boppers, with pictures, page 4 »\n\nInteresting. I didn't know that Warner Bros was trying to revive 78s in 1972.\n\nThat was new to me, but this internet is something sometimes."
