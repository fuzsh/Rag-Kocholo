        "text": "The early Elvis singles were on HMV in the UK. When the proper RCA label was launched it looked and smelt like Decca.\n\nthats certainly the case in the UK Steve, I am not sure about the states mind you - help requested on that pls. Yes those injection moulded singles were dreadful and of dreadful play quality too, however many that had the injection labels initially had an injection moulded three pronged centre, later they would be pretty much all solids. The philips/fontana/polydor large centres appear as a \" variant \" in 1968 but still have paper labels but could also have been injection too as the quality on them was pretty poor also. They last until around 1972 and were supplanted as those god awful injection label jobs started to take over from by then what was known as the polygram group. But it wasn't a linear process, variants lived happily alongside one another for some time...\n\nRCA adopted the Nipper logo through their partnering with Victor, thus \"RCA Victor\". EMI does not own RCA, but EMI may have owned Victor.\n\nWhen Lyntone took delivery of two double cavity 7\" presses we had to remove the automatic dinker unit from the trimmer that also removed the flash. The presses were made by Lened in the U.S.\n\nThe 45rpm single was developed by RCA Victor and the large center hole was for easier handling. At the same time, RCA Victor introduced the 45rpm record changers with the 1 1/2\" spindles.\n\nMeanwhile, in other parts of the world, like England, their main type of \"singles\" were still the 10\" 78rpm discs, which had the traditional small hole. With the introduction of LP's, also with small center holes, as happened elsewhere, multi-speed record players were introduced. Possibly because the 45rpm singles were the last to catch on, they decided it would be better to give them small center holes also.\n\nIf you noticed, most of the British 45's had centers that could be punched out for the 1 1/2\" holes. It's just the later British 45's which just had the small center hole. Capitol records in North America tried it the British way with punch-out centers. They called these the \"OC' 45's for optional center. Didn't go over, so they are rare.\n\nAs for the rest of the world, some used small holes and some used large holes.\n\nAs far as jukeboxes are concerned, even after the introduction of the \"big hole\" 45rpm single, 10\" 78rpm records were still the choice for a few more years. Many jukeboxes can interchange the small and large hole records.\n\naside from the states ( which i do not know ) in the UK i think you are right Steve. There are examples of Decca solid centres which are apparently test pressings for quality control purposes. The edges are not properly trimmed and apparently they would have to go through some kind of \" puncher \" which punched in the push out holes in before they left the factory\n\nThis may be something you are familiar with at PYE Steve, I do not mean the solid tests but the push out punching machine ??\n\nobviously PYE issued both solids and push outs but from around 1963-72 Decca only issued push outs, any solids are as I described above and were not meant to leave the factory.\n\nI haven't read the whole thread so it's probably been mentioned already, but what I vaguely remember reading about it is that it had something to do with trying to make proprietary systems because of some kind of business war between RCA and Columbia. The 45 would have been direct competition the the 78 since there was no 33 1/2 at the time.\n\nPye's push outs resemble Decca's save for the edge which is tapered and the vinyl which is usually slightly thicker. And yes you are quite right about the Juke box co dinkers, I believe ironically they usually used solid centred copies to dink as well !!"
