We uphold top quality standards on the manufacturing floor and throughout the supply chain. Here is how we do it:\n\nEXCEPTIONAL QUALITY CONTROL. Our records are defect free. We always reject skipping, warped and noisy records. There is no “good enough” for a skipping record, if we can fix it – we will. While packing records by hand, employees inspect every single copy for scratches, warping and artwork damage.\n\nHIGH QUALITY STANDARDS. We maintain top-quality standards for both visual appeal and sound quality. Produced on modern technology, our records are low noise level, perfectly centered, and consistent from copy to copy. Our team values glorious days of vinyl, and the warm, natural, open sound it entailed.\n\nPARTNER NETWORK. We work with a diverse network of professional mastering houses. Over 30 years of experience, and state-of-the-art equipment enable the best possible sound in all genres of music.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE. We are committed to immediate customer care.

We believe in the importance of actively listening to music rather than merely skipping through or relegating it to background noise. It is this profound appreciation for the tangible experience of physical music that drives our dedication to preserving its legacy."
