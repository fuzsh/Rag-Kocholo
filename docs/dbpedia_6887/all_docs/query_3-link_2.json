        "text": "I was curious about a couple artists very first recordings, was looking them up, and I thought you guys (and girls?) might be into it. Either first actual record, or maybe demos, whatever.\n\nHere's the one I found.\n\nLeon Russell played on tons of other people's records, but his first solo song was one called Everybody's Talking 'Bout The Young, from 1965.\n\nHe had recorded previously with David Gates, including a 1963 single as C.J. Russell - 'The Girl I Lost in the Rain'\n\nand there was an earlier 1962 single 'Sad September' by David & Lee (David & Leon)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuW83C6tPXA&ab_channel=GottaHaveMoreTunes\n\nHe played piano on 'Swingin' Baby Doll' by David Gates (1959)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9AhrDkjdWg&ab_channel=53jaybop\n\nDavid Bowie took a while to \"find his thing,\" though I actually quite like the early mod singles. This was the first one iirc:\n\n(1964)\n\nAnd of course there's The Quarrymen... everyone started somewhere!\n\nMan, that's a rarity! Sounds like he didn't use his well known soul voice then yet. Thanks for posting!\n\nHe actually had a great voice. Almost like finding out that Picasso knew how to paint.\n\nHendrix's first recorded appearance (1963) on record was on Frank Howard & The Commanders' \"I'm So Glad\" (written by Billy Cox!). It's on Youtube.\n\nJimi's first credited song on record was the instrumental \"Hornet's Nest\" when he was with Curtis Knight & The Squires. This was recorded right around the time when Linda Keith and then Chas Chandler were getting involved with him in Greenwich Village:\n\nThere is actually a mega rare stock copy of this release that is listed on Discogs\n\nMore images\n\nSmile (6) – Earth\n\nLabel: Mercury – 72977\n\nFormat:\n\nVinyl, 7\", 45 RPM, Styrene, Mono\n\nCountry: US\n\nReleased: Dec 2, 1969\n\nGenre: Rock\n\nStyle:\n\nA Earth Written-By – T.
