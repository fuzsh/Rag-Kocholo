        "text": "Stephen C. Barr\n\nSpiral Bound, 8.5” x 11\", 177 pp\n\nThis work is absolutely essential for anyone collecting 78 rpm recordings, regardless of type or musical genre. It covers over 500 record labels, and lists them by manufacturer, catalog number and matrix number. Additionally, brief histories of recording firms and labels are given and the complex interrelationships between them are discussed.\n\nThis is not a fancy book. It is spiral bound (actually an advantage), contains numerous typos and no illustrations. But it is filled with good information. And for the price, it's a steal! If you are looking for something to display on your coffee table, keep looking. If, however, you want a source of information that you will refer to again and again, this is it."
