The death is announced of M Jean Paul

Pierre Casunir-Pener, fifth President of

France.

M. Casimir Perier, who was 60 years of

age, was elected President of the Republic

on the assassination of President Carnot,

in July, 1894. The highest hopes were

entertained of his Government, since be

rivalled his predecessor in integrity and

surpassed him in firmness, and great was

the disappointment when, after an administration

of six months, during which

he had in some measure alienated the

Moderate party without gaining the support

of the more advanced Republicans,

President Casimir Fener resigned office

The cause of his resignation assigned by

himself was inability to withstand the in

suits continually directed against him by

his opponents This was evidently in

sufficient, it was generally believed that

the real motive was impatience at finding

himself a mere cipher in the hands of his

Ministers. A more plausible reason is

supplied by the newspapers, which, in

their obituary notices, declare that M

Cusimir-Perier'a resignation of the Presidential

office placated the Kaiser and saved

France from invasion by Germany.

It appears that on a certain occasion

prior to his resignation, dispatches which

were being brought to Paris by German

couriers were intercepted by the

general staff, which also intercepted a

dispatch in which the French President

conveyed his apologies to the Kaiser for

the unfortunate incident. It is considered

that nothing but the President's timely

resignation would have given the Kaiser

satisfaction, for he evidently regarded the

action of the French officers as an affront

to the dignity of Germany.
