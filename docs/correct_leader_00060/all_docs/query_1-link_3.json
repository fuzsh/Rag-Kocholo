        "text": "Casimir Perier (born Oct. 21, 1777, Grenoble, Fr.—died May 16, 1832, Paris) was a French banker and statesman who exercised a decisive influence on the political orientation of the reign of King Louis-Philippe.\n\nPerier was the son of a manufacturer and financier. After service with the staff of the French army in Italy (1798–1801), he returned to France and together with his brother, Antoine-Scipion, founded a new bank. By 1814 he was one of the most important bankers in Paris. In 1817 he opposed the government’s policy of relying on foreign banks to finance France’s war indemnity. Elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1817, he sat with the moderate opposition of the left."
