        "text": "The death is announced of M Jean Paul\n\nPierre Casunir-Pener, fifth President of\n\nFrance.\n\nM. Casimir Perier, who was 60 years of\n\nage, was elected President of the Republic\n\non the assassination of President Carnot,\n\nin July, 1894. The highest hopes were\n\nentertained of his Government, since be\n\nrivalled his predecessor in integrity and\n\nsurpassed him in firmness, and great was\n\nthe disappointment when, after an administration\n\nof six months, during which\n\nhe had in some measure alienated the\n\nModerate party without gaining the support\n\nof the more advanced Republicans,\n\nPresident Casimir Fener resigned office\n\nThe cause of his resignation assigned by\n\nhimself was inability to withstand the in\n\nsuits continually directed against him by\n\nhis opponents This was evidently in\n\nsufficient, it was generally believed that\n\nthe real motive was impatience at finding\n\nhimself a mere cipher in the hands of his\n\nMinisters. A more plausible reason is\n\nsupplied by the newspapers, which, in\n\ntheir obituary notices, declare that M\n\nCusimir-Perier'a resignation of the Presidential\n\noffice placated the Kaiser and saved\n\nFrance from invasion by Germany.\n\nIt appears that on a certain occasion\n\nprior to his resignation, dispatches which\n\nwere being brought to Paris by German\n\ncouriers were intercepted by the\n\ngeneral staff, which also intercepted a\n\ndispatch in which the French President\n\nconveyed his apologies to the Kaiser for\n\nthe unfortunate incident. It is considered\n\nthat nothing but the President's timely\n\nresignation would have given the Kaiser\n\nsatisfaction, for he evidently regarded the\n\naction of the French officers as an affront\n\nto the dignity of Germany."
