        "text": "A historic institution, a century ensuring the promotion of French language around the world\n\nThe Cours de civilisation française de la Sorbonne was founded in 1919 with a main goal: contributing to peace between peoples by supporting student exchanges. Acting at the time within the framework of the Société des Amis de l’Université de Paris (Society of Friends of the University of Paris) created in 1899, the CCFS contributed to ensure the influence of French higher education.\n\nIn 2009, the CCFS were placed under the direction of the Robert de Sorbon Foundation which is recognized as being of public utility. A new legal reorganization in 2021 finally gave birth to the subsidiary “Sorbon Langue Française”, the Cours de civilisation française de la Sorbonne now constituting an SAS, “Société à mission”.\n\nHistory of the CCFS: an institution shaped by its humanism roots\n\nThe Cours de Civilisation Française de la Sorbonne were founded in 1919, a year which also saw the birth of the CIUP (Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris); just like the later, the CCFS aimed to promote the re-establishment of fraternity between peoples by supporting international student exchanges. The Society of Friends of the University of Paris, under whose leadership the CCFS were created, has distinguished itself over time by prestigious representatives: the Presidents of the Republic Jean-Casimir Perier and Raymond Poincaré, the Nobel Peace Prize Winer René Cassin to name a few\n\nAfter the division of the University of Paris in 1970, the structure became the “Society of Friends of the Universities of Paris”, an association under the law of 1901 recognized as being of public utility. In 2009, it underwent a new transformation to give birth to the Robert de Sorbon Foundation. Finally, in 2021, the Sorbon Langue Française subsidiary enabled the French civilization courses at the Sorbonne to be counted among the companies with a mission as defined by the PACTE law. An opportunity to affirm its will to promote the teaching of the French language and civilization.\n\nThe Institution today\n\nThe structure now brings together around 60 employees, including forty teachers on permanent contracts and a group of temporary teachers. Teachers must have at least a master’s degree, although some have obtained a doctorate.\n\nIn addition, the institution is distinguished by the labeling procedures which confirm the quality of the courses offered by the CCFS: since its first application, it has had all the stars awarded under the various headings of the Quality label FLE – Français Langue étrangère, French as Foreign language – issued by France Education International. The CCFS also has the “Qualiopi” label addressing continuous training. Last but not least, the institution is a member of ADCUEFE, which brings together French university structures teaching French as a foreign language."
