After the war, he returned to Spain and set to work attempting to overthrow General Franco. He was caught in 1945 and executed in 1946. This cinderella, unfortunately a bit chewed up, appeared in last night's search through a random worldwide lot.\n\nRyan\n\nPost by Londonbus1 on\n\nVery nice Exposition labels Rod and james. There are many nice labels for these kind of events from France. They are so attractive.\n\nHere are some more.\n\nProduced for the Colonial Exposition in Marseille, 15th April-15th November 1922. The labels can be found on cover from cards or letters dated as early as March 1922.\n\nProduced in Publicity booklets in panes of 12, there are many different types including different lettering, colours and most or all exist with the printers imprint, one label per booklet ![But not on all panes!] To get a full set would be nigh on impossible methinks !\n\nPrinted [assumption?] by Imp.Regionale, 12 Rue St.Jacques, Marseille.\n\nThe labels depict local costumes/head-dress for French Colonies. Whilst there are many design varieties they do not appear to change position within the pane. So the Cambodian Dancer [below] is always in the middle of the bottom row [3x4] but can be found in many colours and different style of lettering.\n\nA most unusual series.\n\nThe only booklet cover I have seen had one of the labels affixed, but I have no idea if this was the norm.\n\nLondonbus1\n\nPost by rod222 on\n\nHere is the official poster for the Exposition.\n\nI wonder if there is a Poster stamp around somewhere of the same design..........\n\nThat is just beautiful Londonbus, Thanks for sharing,\n\nI'd have that hanging in my loungeroom any time.\n\nFabulous artwork.\n\nAt $4000 AUD a bit out of my price range.\n\nPost by jamesw on\n\nConsidered creating a separate thread, but these are so French, they belong here. La Jeuness au Plein Air.\n\nIn their own words:\n\n'Youth the Plein Air is a confederation of secular organizations is a project of social transformation based on the values ​​of secularism, solidarity and citizenship.'\n\nHere's the translated web page:\n\ntranslate.google.ca/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://www.jpa.asso.fr/&prev=/search%3Fq%3Djeunesse%2Bau%2Bplein%2Bair%26biw%3D2094%26bih%3D1180\n\nThe first two are by Henri Monier, the second two by Herve Morvan.\n\nThere must be more of these out there in TSF-land.\n\nPost by Ryan on\n\nHere's a French label I came across recently. While trying to figure out what I had, I came across this page on Keijo's site (TSF user scb). Have a look through the comments on that page, that's where we learn that these labels came on exported French produce. Note that his label has numerous differences from mine - mine has no region overprint, his is missing the letter type underneath the serial number, there are many small design differences, etc.\n\nRyan\n\nPost by Ryan on\n\nHere are two cinderellas that celebrate the Eiffel Tower. I noticed the flag on top of the tower on one of the stamps and that made me curious - when was the flag there, and when was it not? If you look at modern photos of the Eiffel Tower, there's just a mess of satellite dishes and so on. I have seen a photo of the tower from its inaugural year of 1889, and there was a flag present then. During WWII occupation of France by Germany, there was a Nazi flag on top of the tower, and it was replaced by a French flag shortly before the Germans left. But on the vast majority of historical photos, I don't see a flag, and I never see it on modern photos.\n\nRyan\n\nPost by rod222 on\n\nOther than what the sheet tells me, I have been unable to find out anything else about this part sheet/pane.\n\nThe Free Commune of the Montmartre, Paris. Looks like the 2nd series although I have never seen any others. I purchased this one from an Aussie.\n\nFascinating stamps Lb1, not seen these before.\n\nPrinted by Girard and Bunino (Book printers) Paris.\n\nPost by rod222 on\n\nOther than what the sheet tells me, I have been unable to find out anything else about this part sheet/pane.\n\nwww.ephemanar.net/janvier07.html\n\nNote : On your left hand claret stamp, there is a five pointed star, on the right hand stamp, it is missing.\n\nPost by rod222 on\n\nHere's a French cinderella commemorating a Spaniard.

He was caught in 1945 and executed in 1946. This cinderella, unfortunately a bit chewed up, appeared in last night's search through a random worldwide lot.\n\nRyan\n\nHi Ryan,\n\nactually this is a Spanish Cinderella.\n\nAlas, a bit late for my catalogue \"Vinetas politicas republicanas de la guerra civil espanola\"\n\nPost by Ryan on\n\nactually this is a Spanish Cinderella.\n\nAlas, a bit late for my catalogue \"Vinetas politicas republicanas de la guerra civil espanola\"\n\nA bit late for any Spanish civil war stamp - the Spanish civil war ended in 1939! The text under the portrait is in French and the currency is French as well, so I doubt it's of Spanish origin.\n\nRyan\n\nPost by rod222 on\n\nactually this is a Spanish Cinderella.\n\nAlas, a bit late for my catalogue \"Vinetas politicas republicanas de la guerra civil espanola\"\n\nA bit late for any Spanish civil war stamp - the Spanish civil war ended in 1939!

I never noticed the missing star before. And to think of all those times I have ogled this part sheet lovingly ! I must be slipping !\n\nGet a grip Bus, get a grip.\n\nThanks for pointing it out Rod."
