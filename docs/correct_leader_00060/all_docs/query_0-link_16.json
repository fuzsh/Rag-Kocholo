Taken in 1894 and featured in Le Petit Journal on July 9th of the same year, this portrait captures the essence of Casimir-Perier's influential role as the fifth president of the French Third Republic. Casimir-Perier served his country diligently from 1894 to 1895, leaving an indelible mark on French politics during his short tenure. With a distinguished moustache adorning his face, he exudes confidence and authority through this vividly colored image.
