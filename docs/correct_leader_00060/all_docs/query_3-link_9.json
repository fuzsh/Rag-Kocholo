        "text": "Summary\n\nThis silver medal dating from 1894 depicts Jean Paul Casimir-PÃ©rier.\n\nChaplain (1839-1909) was a French medallist and sculptor. He entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in 1857, where he studied sculpture under FranÃ§ois Jouffroy and medals under EugÃ¨ne OudinÃ©. In 1863 he won the Prix de Rome for medal-engraving and worked in Rome from 1864 to 1868. He exhibited regularly at the Salon from 1863, receiving numerous awards. As the leading French medallist he was elected to the AcadÃ©mie des Beaux-Arts in 1881. He had been profoundly important in transforming the public's perception of medallic art.\n\nChaplain changed public taste by moving away from the established tradition by which medallic portraits and reverse compositions emerged from a completely flat field bounded by a raised circular rim. He incorporated the field into the composition, using it not as a neutral background but as the pictorial space in which the event or portrait sitter was situated.\n\nBibliographic references\n\nInventory of Works of Art Acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum in the Years 1903 - 1904.
