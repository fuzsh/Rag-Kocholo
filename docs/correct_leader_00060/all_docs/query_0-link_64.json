        "text": "Official portraits of French presidents.\n\nAs soon as technology made multiple reproduction of images possible (in fact, since the invention of the negative around 1840 by Talbot) it has been customary to take an \"official\" photo at the beginning of a president's term of office. posted in all French town halls and in certain other public places. Adolphe Thiers was the first president to benefit from this image reproduction technique, in black and white at the time.\n\nThese official presidential portraits were taken by well-known photographers who listened either to the personality of the President to be photographed, or to the instructions of his communications department. It is interesting to analyse these portraits by placing them in context and considering that each of the photos was exactly what the client wanted. In fact, when you're called the ElysÃ©e, you have the the means to have a photo redone if it is not exactly what was expected.\n\nIt is amusing to note that the pose of Adolphe Thiers in 1871 (his hand resting on a book symbolising the constitution) is regularly found in subsequent presidential portraits: Armand FalliÃ¨res in 1906, Raymond PoincarÃ© in 1913 (but without the book), Alexandre Millerand in 1920, Gaston Doumergue in 1924, Paul Doumer in 1931, Albert Lebrun in 1932 and, more recently, Charles de Gaulle (1959) and Georges Pompidou (1969).\n\nThe recurring symbols only began to change very recently, in 1974 with ValÃ©ry Giscard D'Estaing. Previously, a book was often placed on the table (the constitution), with a bookcase in the background (knowledge), the Legion of Honour or other decorations.\n\nValÃ©ry Giscard D'Estaing also brought about a break in posture: the haughty attitude was replaced by a smiling face and a direct gaze. In addition, a French flag appears for the first time. This is perhaps justified by the fact that presidential photos have long been in black and white: blue-white-red in black and white just doesn't look the same. Since then, the French flag has always featured in official photos, except with Miterrand, who preferred a return to the front of the library.\n\nGiscard d'Estaing also changed his attire: he wore a suit and tie, stripped of all presidential attributes and decorations. It was the suit of someone you might meet in the street. This novelty would later be adopted by all his successors.\n\nThis portrait of Giscard D'Estaing marks the beginning of official photos that are carefully thought out and designed to convey a particular message. It's easy to imagine a set of specifications, given to the photographer and designed by the communication department.\n\nIt is then worth analysing these images to determine what message you wanted to get across or what impression you wanted to convey. The first elements to consider may be :\n\nThe distance.\n\nWhen the President is depicted in full or as an American portrait (cut off at mid-thigh), this creates a distance between the viewer and the president.\n\nA head-and-shoulders portrait, on the other hand, is a sign of closeness, indicating that the person is not inaccessible.\n\nThe low-angle shot.\n\nThis term is used when the point of view (the camera) is relatively low in relation to the subject.\n\nThe low angle is used to make the person being photographed more majestic. It gives the impression that the viewer is inferior to the person in the photo.\n\nThe President's posture, the gaze.\n\nIs the attitude haughty or welcoming ? Is the gaze directed at the viewer or elsewhere ? All these elements influence the impression given by the person of the president.\n\nThe flags.\n\nFlags are strong and immediately identifiable symbols. In this case, it could be the French flag and/or the European flag. The presence or absence of these elements, their size, but also their position in relation to the person of the President (on the same plane, behind) is significant.\n\nOther symbolic elements.\n\nThe background is becoming increasingly important: before 1950, presidents were often photographed in front of a neutral background (there were exceptions). After 1950, the place where the photo is taken is chosen carefully: library, gardens, office, etc.\n\nThe objects and furniture visible in the dÃ©cor also have a meaning. Their presence is no accident.\n\nCharles de Gaulle.\n\nGeorges Pompidou.\n\nValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing (1974-1981).\n\nIt's a head-and-shoulders portrait, which suggests a certain closeness between the viewer and the president.\n\nThe background is a French flag waving in the wind. This adds colour and dynamism to the image.\n\nThe suit is simple and devoid of the usual presidential attributes (decoration, Legion of Honour, etc). It's the suit of someone you might meet in the street.\n\nThe posture is inviting: the low-angle shots of his predecessors are a thing of the past. The face is smiling and the gaze is directed at the viewer. All details that suggest a President who is close to the French people. The look in the camera would be repeated by all his successors right up to the present day.\n\nFinally, the photo is oriented horizontally, which is also a first.\n\nFranÃ§ois Mitterrand.\n\nJacques Chirac (1995-2007).\n\nNicolas Sarkozy (2007-2012).\n\nFranÃ§ois Hollande (2012-2017).\n\nEmmanuel Macron.\n\nThe French and European flags surround the President and are themselves arranged symmetrically. The left-hand side of a photo is generally associated with the past, while the right-hand side represents the future. This gives the placement of the flags a very clear meaning in the President's mind.\n\nSee also :\n\nA video showing the preparations for the official portrait. We see the President himself arranging the objects on his desk. We should bear in mind that this video may have been staged.\n\nTo read more :"
