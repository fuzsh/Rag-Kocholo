        "text": "Emotion vibrated through the walls of the Élysée Palace on February 16, 1899. It was night, and the President of the Republic had just died in the arms of an admirer. No, scratch that! The President of the Republic had just died while receiving oral pleasure from his last mistress.\n\nThe deceased, Félix Faure, is a handsome 58 year-old-man with a thin mustache à la Guy de Maupassant. He was elected President of the Republic by a coalition of moderates and monarchists on January 17, 1895, following the resignation of Jean Casimir-Périer. His contemporaries nicknamed him “Président Soleil” (President Sun) because of his love for pomp and splendor.\n\nOnce, upon receiving a Russian Grand Duchess at the Élysée Palace, he had been served before her. The Grand Duchess naturally protested, and the President replied without thinking: “It is the custom at the court of France!”\n\nFaure might have been President, but he was also a Queen by today’s standards.\n\nReckless chivalry\n\nThe public initially believed that his last moments’ companion was Cécile Sorel, a famous actress of the moment."
