        "meta_description": "Jean Casimir-Perier was born in Paris, the son of Auguste Casimir-Perier and the grandson of Casimir Pierre Perier, premier of Louis Philippe. He entered public life as secretary to his father, who was minister of the interior under the presidency of Thiers.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 he was elected general councillor of the Aube département, and was sent by the same département to the chamber of deputies in the general elections of 1876, and he was always re-elected until his presidency. In spite of the traditions of his family, Casimir-Perier joined the group of Republicans on the Left, and was one of the 363 on the Seize-Mai (1877). He refused to vote the expulsion of the princes in 1883, and resigned as deputy upon the enactment of the law, because of his personal connections with the family of Orléans.\r\n\r\nOn 17 August 1883 he became under-secretary of state for war, a post he retained until 7 January 1885. From 1890",
