Claude's descendants became leading Paris bankers, regents of the Bank of France and owner-directors of Anzin, the major coal mining company of France in the Department of Nord. They were mayors of towns, prefects of departments and members of municipal tribunals and chambers of commerce. Many were elected representatives of departments to the Chamber of Deputies in Paris and appointed to France's Chamber of Peers. Most notably, Casimir Pierre Perier (1777–1832), the fourth of Claude's eight sons, became Prime Minister of France in 1831–32 during the Orleanist monarchy of Louis-Philippe I. Casimir's grandson, Jean Casimir-Perier (1847–1907), was elected president of the Third Republic in 1894. Claude Perier was sufficiently wealthy before 1789 to be known as \"Perier-Milord\" in Grenoble and surroundings, but it was mainly during the decade of revolution 1789–99 that he created the financial underpinning of the Perier dynasty. His eight sons and two daughters would share his legacy of around 5,800,000 francs.
