        "text": "Bonnet Family Cousins\n\nJean-Paul RAPPENEAU - (1932 - Present) is a French film director and screenwriter. He started out in film as an assistant and screenwriter collaborating with Louis Malle on Zazie dans le métro in 1960 and Vie privée in 1961. In 1964, he was co-screenwriter for L'Homme de Rio, which starred Jean-Paul Belmondo. The first film that he both wrote and directed was A Matter of Resistance in 1965. Although it was a great critical and popular success, he did not make another film until 1971, when he directed Les Mariés de l'an II, again starring Belmondo and Marlène Jobert.\n\nSince 1975, Rappeneau has written only for his own films, including Le Sauvage, starring Yves Montand , Catherine Deneuve and Tout feu, tout flamme [fr] (1981), again with Montand, who co-starred with Isabelle Adjani.\n\nIn 1990, Rappeneau directed a deluxe Technicolor film version of Cyrano de Bergerac, his adaptation of the classic French play by Edmond Rostand, starring Gérard Depardieu. Rappeneau's film version is the most elaborate film version of the play ever made, and one of the most expensive French films ever produced. It is the only rendition of the play in the original French to be released widely. At the 1991 César Awards, Rappeneau won the César Award for Best Director and César Award for Best Film and was Nominated for the European Film Award for Best Film.\n\nThe 2003 comedy Bon voyage, co-written with Patrick Modiano, again starred Depardieu, this time with Isabelle Adjani. The film was nominated 11 times at the 2004 César Awards.\n\n​--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJean Esprit Marcellin – (1821 – 1884) French Sculptor. Many of his works are featured in Sotheby’s auctions today. Amongst his official commissions in Paris were several sculptures for the façade of the Louvre, the Tuileries Palace, the Town Hall, the Opera and the churches of La Sorbonne and Saint-Gervais-Saint-Protais. He was also the author of the pediment of the Town Hall of Marseille and the marble group of the Shepherd Cypress (Grenoble Museum).\n\nMarcellin produced several versions of this charming model in 1854-1855, in marble, bronze and plaster, enlisted by Gérard Brès in the 1992 exhibition catalogue (op. cit.). The model received significant praise, including by Théophile Gautier who described the work as \"œuvre pleine de charme et de talent\" (a work characterised by great charm and talent) and by Larousse, who mentioned that this work is one of his most gracious. Born in Gap, France, Jean Marcellin comes from a modest background. He became an apprentice in 1837 to a sculptor and painter-decorator whom he quickly left for one of his competitors. Showing himself to be very gifted at sculpture, he wished to go to Paris, and was supported by the mayor of Gap, Élisée Roubaud, and the deputy of Embrun, Antoine Allier, himself a sculptor. In 1841, Marcellin took evening classes at the Petite École in Paris, while working for a sculpture workshop.\n\nAround 1844, the general council of Hautes-Alpes and the City of Gap supported it financially for several years. After entering the Paris School of Fine Arts, Allier recommended him to François Rude who took him into his studio.\n\nIt was in 1848 that success smiled upon him through works such as The Shepherd Cyparissus holding his fawn which he had just accidentally killed and Cypris breastfeeding Cupid. His talent was unanimously recognized, he was decorated with the Legion of Honor in the 1860s.\n\n​\n\nJean Marcellin frequently sent his works to the Salon until 1864. He becomes a member of the jury.\n\nIn 1866, he donated the Monument to Charles-François de Ladoucette to the town of Gap. Strongly attached to the region where he was born, he returned very often to the Hautes-Alpes. Due to his origins, he was at the base of what would become the Société fraternelle des Hautes-Alpes in Paris upon his death.\n\n​--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDidier DECOIN - (1945 - Present) is a French screenwriter and writer awarded the Prix Goncourt in 1977. A film and television writer (adapted scripts for television as the major TV films Les Misérables, The Count of Monte Cristo, Balzac and Napoleon).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrédéric MISTRAL – (1830 – 1914) Joseph Étienne Frédéric Mistral (French: [mistʁal]; Occitan: Josèp Estève Frederic Mistral, 8 September– 25 March) was a French writer of Occitan literature and lexicographer of the Provençal form of the language. He received the 1904 Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of the fresh originality and true inspiration of his poetic production, which faithfully reflects the natural scenery and native spirit of his people, and, in addition, his significant work as a Provençal philologist\".​ Mistral was a founding member of the Félibrige and member of the Académie de Marseille​. French Writer and Lexicographer of the Occitan Language (Catalonia) Nobile prize Lit.\n\nFrédéric Mistral (1830-1914) came from an old and well-to-do family of landowners that had settled in Provence in the sixteenth century. He was deeply influenced by his early years in the leisurely and patriarchal manor of his father. Mistral read law, but after taking his degree devoted himself entirely to writing poetry in Provençal, the passion for which had been aroused during his school days by one of his masters, the Provençal poet Joseph Roumanille. Mistral’s aim was to make neo-Provençal a literary language conforming to fixed standards of purity. For this purpose he spent many years on the compilation of the Trésor dóu Félibrige, a dictionary of Provençal published by the «Felibrige», a literary society that Mistral had founded.\n\nMistral was both an epic and a lyrical poet. His work is determined by Provence, not only in language, but in content and feeling. Provence is the true hero of all his poems. His first great success was Miréio (1859), a story of two star-crossed lovers. It was followed by Calendau (1867), a fantastic narrative poem about a Provençal fisherman. Other works include Lis Isclo d’or (1876) [Islands of Gold], a collection of poems; «Nerto» (1884), a narrative poem based on a chronicle of the Avignon Popes; La Rèino Jano (1890); and Lou pouémo dóu rose (1897) [The Song of the Rhone]. A five-volume edition of his works appeared between 1887 and 1910; three volumes of unpublished works appeared posthumously (1926-30). Mistral wrote an autobiography Moun espelido: Memori è raconte (1906) [Memoirs of Mistral]. His efforts to revive Provençal were at various times supported by the Academie Française and the Institut de France.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJacques TARDI – (1946 – Present) Awarding-winning Comic Artist spanning international awards from 1974-2021). Tardi was born in Valence, Drôme. After graduating from the École nationale des beaux-arts de Lyon and the École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs in Paris, he started drawing comics in 1969, at the age of 23, in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Pilote, initially illustrating short stories written by Jean Giraud and Serge de Beketch, before creating the political fiction story Rumeur sur le Rouergue from a scenario by Pierre Christin in 1972.[1][2] In 2013, Tardi was nominated as a Chevalier in France's Legion of Honour, the country's highest distinction.[4] However, he turned down the distinction, citing that he will \"remain a free man and not be held hostage by any power whatsoever.\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMadeleine COLLE LEMAIRE - (1845 – 1928) French painter. French painter, pastellist and illustrator.\n\nRecognized for her natural authority, energy and humility,\n\nMadeleine Lemaire is perhaps better known to us as the socialite Madame de Villeparisis and the tyrannical Madame Verdurin in Marcel Proust’s “In Search of Lost Time.” A few photographic portraits show her in her studio, a conservatory in the Plaine Monceau district where she entertained guests from all walks of life. Every Tuesday evening, writers, musicians and actors from the Comédie-Française and politicians flocked to her very sought-after musical and literary salon. The dandy Robert de Montesquiou was a regular visitor. Tenor Reynaldo Hahn won over his first audiences there, and M. Proust was initiated into the fever of socialite life at her salon in 1891. In the summer, the whole company was hosted by their benevolent friend at her Château de Réveillon in the Marne, where M. Proust wrote Les Plaisirs et les Jours while R. Hahn created four piano pieces and M. Lemaire painted watercolours of wildflowers.\n\n​\n\nBorn into the upper middle-class, the daughter of General Baron Joseph Habert and niece of famous miniaturist Mathilde Herbelin (1820-1904), who also ran a salon, M. Lemaire developed social skills that benefitted the practice of her art. However, she refused to remain confined to the salons. Villeparisis and Verdurin only briefly outshine the independent artist she was, who was resolved to assert herself amidst a very masculine assembly. M. Lemaire had spent her childhood in the presence of artists. Her aunt was her first teacher, and Charles Chaplin (1825-1891) later became her tutor. The portraits she exhibited at the Salon from the age of nineteen showed the influence of 18th-century art. Her marriage to municipal civil servant Camille Lemaire in 1870 and subsequent motherhood never prevented her from working tirelessly to perfect her precocious talent. Her relationship with Alexandre Dumas fils cemented her position within the artistic elites and marked her emancipation and her move towards a more personal output. She exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts and The Woman’s Building at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nClaude-Nicolas Perier (28 May 1742 – 6 February 1801) was assured an important place in French history when he opened his Château de Vizille near Grenoble to the famous meeting of the estates of the Province of Dauphiné (21 July 1788) heralding the coming of the French Revolution.\n\nHe is notable also as the founder of the remarkable Perier family \"bourgeois dynasty\" that rose to economic and political influence and prominence in France during the 19th century. Claude's descendants became leading Paris bankers, regents of the Bank of France and owner-directors of Anzin, the major coal mining company of France in the Department of Nord. They were mayors of towns, prefects of departments and members of municipal tribunals and chambers of commerce. Many were elected representatives of departments to the Chamber of Deputies in Paris and appointed to France's Chamber of Peers. Most notably, Casimir Pierre Perier (1777–1832), the fourth of Claude's eight sons, became Prime Minister of France in 1831–32 during the Orleanist monarchy of Louis-Philippe I. Casimir's grandson, Jean Casimir-Perier (1847–1907), was elected president of the Third Republic in 1894. Claude Perier was sufficiently wealthy before 1789 to be known as \"Perier-Milord\" in Grenoble and surroundings, but it was mainly during the decade of revolution 1789–99 that he created the financial underpinning of the Perier dynasty. His eight sons and two daughters would share his legacy of around 5,800,000 francs.\n\nChildren of Claude Perier:\n\nJacques-Prosper (1768) Died at birth\n\nElisabeth-Josephine (1770–1850) m.

Claude's father, Jacques Perier (1702–1782), moved there about 1720 from the hamlet of Perier, located near the small town of Mens some 50 kilometers south of Grenoble. He was an aspiring merchant of linen and canvas cloth, and Grenoble at the time was becoming a main commercial center with links to important markets at Arles, Avignon, Lyons, Marseilles and the great annual fair at Beaucaire. He prospered at Grenoble and in 1741 married Marie Dupuy, the daughter of a merchant and one-time municipal consul. Claude Perier, born in 1742, was the first of their seven children. In 1749, Jacques purchased an imposing, multi-story home for the family on the Grande Rue.\n\nBusiness career\n\nJacques' business developed as a family affair over the years. His daughter Elisabeth, for example, married Pierre Jordan, a wealthy merchant in Lyon. Commerce with Voiron near Grenoble was added by François Perier-Lagrange, who was a nephew. In 1764, Madeleine Perier, a niece, married a leading merchant in Voiron, François Tivolier. Claude Perier cemented these connections when he came of age by marrying Marie-Charlotte Pascal (1749–1821), the daughter of a leading Voiron merchant. Her dowry in 1767 amounted to 60,000 livres. By that date Claude was already an active member of the family enterprise. In 1764 the business was named \"Jacques Perier, Father, Son, Nephew & Company.\" Claude Perier and Perier-Lagrange were the minor partners. When this association was renewed in 1773, the shares of Jacques and his son, Claude, were 344,266 livres and 72,493 livres, respectively.\n\nThe trade in linens was a mainstay, but the Periers also acted as credit bankers for area businesses, made land investments, and ventured into manufacturing at Grenoble on their own account (muslins, 1777; hardware, 1779). Most importantly, Claude and his father responded to the increasing demand in France for printed cotton cloths (toiles peints) and wallpapers (papiers peints). Printed cottons were mainly imported from India and were known as indiennes, but they began to be fabricated in France in 1760 by the famous industrialist Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf (1738–1815). His factory for cotton prints at Jouy near Paris, which employed 900 workers by 1774, was named a \"royal manufacturer\" in 1783 by Louis XVI. Oberkampf invented the first machine for printing wallpaper in 1785. Jacques and Claude Perier began the production of these printed stuffs in 1775–1777 at Vizille, a small village just south of Grenoble.\n\nChateau de Vizille\n\nPurchase of the Château de Vizille\n\nFamously, in a bold entrepreneurial move in 1780, Claude purchased the historic 17th century Château de Vizille with its large rooms and spacious main hall, extensive grounds, numerous out-buildings, streams and water park, as well as nearby lands in Oisans and La Mure. All told, here were ideal conditions for the manufacture of indiennes. Claude paid Gabriel Louis de Neufville, duc de Villeroy, approximately 1,254,000 livres for the buildings and properties. By 1785, about 100 workers (400 by 1789) were employed at the château producing printed cottons.\n\nAs became typical of his business style, Claude Perier was involved in other money-making projects even as production of printed cottons at the Vizille factory began to get underway. In fact, the factory was rented out to Swiss experts from Geneva, Jean-Louis Fazy and his son, who ran the operation until January, 1794, at which time other specialists from Geneva and Mulhouse were brought in. Only beginning in 1798 would Claude's eldest son, Augustin-Charles, assume direction of the family enterprise.\n\nCane sugar investments\n\nMeantime, in 1782, Jacques Perier died leaving a fortune of 600,000 livres to be divided among his three sons, Claude, Jacques-Augustin and Antoine. As the eldest son, Claude's share of the estate was 400,000 livres. These were funds that helped Claude establish a new commercial house at Voiron in 1783. The purpose was to make money importing cane sugar from the Caribbean. The business was called \"Perier, Father and Son, Berlioz, Rey & Company.\" Berlioz and Joseph Rey, who were business associates at Grenoble, each invested 48,000 livres (4 shares) in the company; Claude also invested 48,000 livres, plus 240,000 as working capital; and one share (12,000 livres) was listed in the name of Augustin Perier, Claude's then 10-year-old son. In 1784 Claude took a half-interest in another sugar import company at Marseilles, \"Pierre Chazel & Company.\" These companies were very profitable until 1793.\n\nInvolvement in Hospital General\n\nIn the 1770s the directors in charge of the Hospital General of Grenoble (a facility meant to incarcerate paupers and beggars) abandoned the hospital. A group of new men became the directors and among them was Claude. In fact, out of all the directors, Claude Perier was the wealthiest. Claude was wealthy and powerful enough to bring along his business associates onto the board of directors for the Hospital as well: Monsieur Dupy, Monsieur Pascal, and his cousin Périer-Lagrange.\n\nClaude Perier from Grenoble/Vizille to Paris, 1789–1801\n\nInvolvement in the French Revolution\n\nClaude Perier played an important role in the onset of the French Revolution by supporting resistance in Grenoble (Assembly of Vizille) by the Parlement of Dauphiny against the centralizing and fiscal abuses of the monarchy of Louis XVI. His eldest son Augustin would write later: \"His travels in England had given him a proper idea of the benefits of a free government. Associating himself readily with all the opinions and all of the hopes of that period, he made hurriedly all the preparations necessary for such a large gathering, and his eagerness, which was not without danger, was worthy of the tokens of public gratitude.\" Almost 500 persons gathered at the Château de Vizille (21 July 1788) where Claude provided a large banquet for the deputies of the province. Mostly, although also with popular support, it was an assemblage of well-to-do \"notables\": churchmen, landed nobility, lawyers, notaries, municipal officials, businessmen and doctors. Their famous demand was for the convocation in Paris of an Estates-General wherein the Third Estate would have double-representation and votes would be by head rather than by order. Thus was precipitated a revolutionary movement in France more inclusive, complex and disruptive than anyone could have anticipated.\n\nClaude Perier dealt opportunistically with the escalating political postures of France's decade of revolution, 1789-99. He became a valuable member of the new municipal council of Grenoble (Department of Isère), but did not aspire to political leadership or fame. He remained at heart and acted basically as a merchant-banker and inveterate \"money-manager\" (manieur d'argent).\n\nHe kept abreast of opportunity in matters of investment and enterprise. Early on (1789–90), when it was considered patriotic, he purchased nationalized properties of the church and emigrated nobles, paying in assignats, the paper money issued by the National Assembly in Paris. In 1790, he acquired a mechanized cotton-spinning factory at Anilly, near Montargis. In 1791, he invested heavily in a sugar refining company in Marseilles, \"Seren & Company.\"\n\nIn 1793, when France was at war and Jacobins of the National Convention held sway in Paris (Marie Antoinette was guillotined on October 31, 1793), he organized a company to manufacture rifles for the French Army in Savoy; and with the chemist-geologist Alexandre Giroud, he petitioned Paris for permission to establish the production of commercial soda at the cantons of Vizille and Mure near Grenoble. These initiatives enhanced his reputation as a patriot and good citizen (bon citoyen) at an opportune time, for in October 1793 Claude found himself denounced as an enemy of the Revolution by Pierre Chépy, who was president of Grenoble's Société Populaire. He was accused of cupidity, for liquidating his sugar importing company (Perier, Berlioz & Rey) by paying investors in depreciated assignats, and more seriously, of supporting an anti-Jacobin revolt in southern France at Lyons. There was some substance to these charges - Claude Perier's opportunism was not always circumspect. But ultimately, his 'indiscretions' came to be excused, probably most importantly because he had befriended Camille Teisseire, a very popular Jacobin member of Grenoble's municipal council and the city's chief of police. In 1794, Teisseire married Marine Perier, Claude's youngest daughter.\n\n​\n\nClaude Perier in Paris\n\nWhen the Thermidorian Reaction cooled down revolutionary fervor in France, Claude shifted his business activity to Paris, where he took up residence (28 November 1794) at No.341-43 rue Saint-Honoré. His eldest son, Augustin, was primed to take over family affairs at Grenoble/Vizille. In Paris, Claude made contacts with leading merchant-manufacturers and money-managers, such as Jean Lecouteulx de Canteleu, William Sabatier, Médard Desprez and Jean Perregaux, and also the noted legal advisor, Pierre-Nicolas Berryer. His first financial coup came in 1795 when he participated in a major loan of 2,418,505 livres to the owners of the Anzin Coal Company in the department of Nord. The loan allowed the company to buy back shares in the enterprise that had been nationalized/confiscated by the government of the Convention. Claude's investment in the loan was 393,425 livres, payable in assignats. In return, he received a large number of the company's coveted shares and (in 1798) a directorship. Anzin would be a major client of the Paris bank founded in 1801 by two of Claude's sons, Casimir and Scipion.\n\n​\n\nClaude Perier's most notable achievement as a money-manager came in 1799–1800 when he was a founder and became one of the first regents of the Bank of France. Claude had associated in 1796 with a group of twenty or so bankers and businessmen to establish a private bank called the Caisse des Comptes Courants. This bank, with offices in Paris on the Place des Victoires, was capitalized modestly at 5 million francs and specialized in short-term business loans at 6 per cent interest, but the group aspired to grow the capital base and expand into long-term investments and government finance. In brief, these were the financiers who, shortly after the coup d'état of 18 Brumaire (November 9, 1799) established the government of the Consulate, met with the new First Consul, Napoleon Bonaparte, and convinced him to enlarge and transform the Caisse des Comptes Courants into the Bank of France, to be capitalized at 30 million francs. They agreed to loan the new government 12 million francs to get the bank started. Claude Perier, aided by the lawyer Berryer, drafted the statutes of the bank. He was appointed as one of its first fifteen regents. Subsequently, he was named a member of Napoleon's Corps Législatif. The Bank of France began its operations on February 29, 1800, in the former offices of the Caisse des Comptes Courants at the Hôtel Massiac, Place des Victoires. Jean-Frédéric Perregaux was named president of its directing Council of Regents.\n\n​\n\nLate life\n\nClaude Perier died at his mansion in Paris on February 6, 1801. He was 59 years old. He had brought the Periers successfully through the difficult years of the Revolution, leaving an enormous fortune and invaluable social and business connections that would help the family on its way to prominence. For the Perier family, he had \"opened the doors to the two powers entrusted to Notables, politics and high finance.\" Paris now became the major arena of Perier business activity. Claude had positioned his family members well to play significant roles in the industrialization of France during the early 19th century.\n\nAddendum regarding the death of Claude Perier:\n\nWriters sometimes report Stendhal's assertion that Claude Perier died of the cold in the night because he was too miserly to pay for wood to heat his mansion. However, as Madeleine Bourset warns in her biography of Casimir Perier, the novelist Stendhal exercised a certain personal bitterness toward Claude Perier, claiming even that his sons, Casimir and Scipion, were left to starve and share clothing for lack of money. Claude was in fact very careful about money and did not pamper his sons. They were not raised with a sense of entitlement. But he loved them and saw to it that they had allowances. He ceded them income-providing properties. As for Claude's death, Bourset references the matter-of-fact report in the Duc d'Audiffret-Pasquier's Notices historiques sur la famille Perier (Paris, 1844), that \"he died for having spent an hour in his unheated study wearing a mere dressing-gown.\"\n\n​--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJean CASMIR-PERIER – (1847 – 1907) was a French politician who served as President of France from 1894 to 1895.\n\nJean Casimir-Perier was born in Paris on 8 November 1847, the son of Auguste Casimir-Perier, the grandson of Casimir Pierre Perier, premier of Louis Philippe, and the great grandson of Claude Périer, one of the founders of the Bank of France. He entered public life as secretary to his father, who was Minister of the Interior under the presidency of Thiers.\n\nTIMELINE of Jean CASIMIR-PERIER\n\n8 November 1847\n\nJean Paul Pierre Casimir-Perier, son of a minister in the Thiers Government, grandson of Prime Minister of Louis-Philippe was born in Paris.\n\n1862-1866\n\nHe conducted his secondary studies at Lycée Bonaparte, then earned a degree in Law and a degree in the Arts.\n\n1870\n\nHe was Capitan of the Fourth Company of the First Battalion of the Mobiles of Aube (equipped at his own expense), he stood out in combat, was mentioned in the Order of the Army and was made a Knight in the Legion of Honour.\n\n17 April 1873\n\nHe married his cousin, Hélène Périer-Vitet.\n\n18 July 1873\n\nHe served as Nogent-sur-Seine Departmental Council (Aube Deparment).\n\n1874\n\nHe was elected General Councilor of the Aube départment, and was sent by the same départment to the Chamber of Deputies in the general elections of 1876, and he was always re-elected until his presidency. In spite of the traditions of his family, Casimir-Perier joined the group of Republicans on the Left, and was one of the 363 on the Seize-Mai (1877). He refused to vote the \"expulsion of the Princes\" in 1883, and resigned as Deputy upon the enactment of the law (26 June 1886) because of his personal connections with the family of Orléans.\n\n20 February 1876\n\nHe served as a Centre Gauche Deputy (Department of Nogent-sur-Seine), he was re-elected successively until 1894.\n\n1877\n\nHe refused to give his vote of confidence for the highly conservative and repressive-of-the-left Government of Duc de Borglie (Mac-Mahon Presidency).\n\n14 December 1877-31 January 1879\n\nHe served as Under-Secretary of the State for Public Instruction, Fine Arts and Religions in the Dufaure Government.\n\n17 October 1883-3 January 1885\n\nHe served as War Under-Secretary of State in the Ferry Government (Grévy Presidency).\n\n1885\n\nHe served as Vice-President of the Chamber of Deputies.\n\n1891-1893\n\nHe was President of the Budget Committee.\n\n1893-1894\n\nHe was Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs (under the Sadi Carnot Presidency). Because of anarchist actions, he had laws passed on individual liberty and press offences, dubbed “wicked laws” by the socialist opposition.\n\n27 June 1894\n\nHe was elected President of the Republic after President Sadi Carnot was assassinated.\n\nDecember 1894 to 1906\n\nThe “Dreyfus Affair.”\n\nFrench Army Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a graduate of the École Polytechnique and a Jew of Alsatian origin, was accused of handing secret documents to the Imperial German military. After a closed trial, he was found guilty of treason and sentenced to life imprisonment. The “Dreyfus Affair” has come to symbolize modern injustice in the Francophone world. It remains one of the most notable examples of a complex miscarriage of justice and antisemitism. The role played by the press and public opinion proved to be influential in the conflict. At the trial of Alfred Dreyfus at Rennes (known as the “Dreyfus Affair”, Casimir-Perier's evidence, as opposed to that of General Mercier, was of great value to the cause of Dreyfus which led to a complete exoneration. how justice can be tested by prejudice and political intrigue. It is an invitation for reflection on our own society's commitment to truth and fairness amidst controversy.\n\n16 January 1895\n\nIn a deeply troubled and divided government President Jean Casimir-Perier found himself ignored by the ministers, who did not consult him before taking decisions, and did not keep him informed upon political events, especially in foreign affairs. Uncomfortable in office, President Jean Casimir-Perier resigned and retired from political life.\n\n1899\n\nHe refused President Émile Loubet’s offer to form a Government.\n\n11 March 1907\n\nHe died in Paris. Casimir-Perier died on 11 March 1907 in Paris of Angina pectoris (reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.) From that time, he completely abandoned politics, and devoted himself to business – especially mining.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHelene CASMIR-PERIER - (1854 -1912) First-Lady to the President of France. Hélène Perier-Vitet was born in Grosley-sur-Risle in Val-d'Oise. She married Jean Casimir-Perier, a distant cousin, on 17 April 1873. He was the grandson of Casimir Pierre Périer, president of the Council of Ministers under Louis Philippe I. Her influence on him was strong; she was the driving force behind his run for the presidency.[1] wife of the President of France_1894-95.\n\n​--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAugust CASMIR-PERIER – (20 August 1811, in Paris – 6 June 1876) was a French diplomat and political leader. He was the son of Prime Minister Casimir Pierre Perier and the father of President Jean Casimir-Perier.\n\nHe entered the diplomatic service, being attached successively to the London, Brussels and St Petersburg embassies and in 1843 became minister plenipotentiary at Hanover.\n\nIn 1846 he resigned from the service to enter the legislature as deputy for the département of Seine, a constituency which he exchanged for another one in the département of Aube after the Revolution of 1848.\n\nOn the establishment of the Second Empire he retired temporarily from public life, and devoted himself to economic questions of which he published a series of works, notably Les Finances et la politique (1863), dealing with the interaction of political institutions and finance. He contested Grenoble unsuccessfully in 1863 against the imperial candidate, Casimir Royer; and failed again for Aube in 1869.\n\n​\n\nIn 1871 he was returned by three départements to the National Assembly, and elected to sit for Aube. He joined the Centre gauche parliamentary group. He was minister of the interior for a few months from 11 October 1871 to 6 February 1872, and his retirement deprived Thiers of one of the strongest elements in his cabinet. He also joined the short-lived ministry of May 1873 (18 to 25 May). He consistently opposed all efforts in the direction of a monarchical restoration, but on the definite constitution of the republic became a senator for life, declining Mac-Mahon's invitation to form the first cabinet under the new constitution. He died in Paris.\n\nMaurice COUVE DE MURVILLE - French diplomat and Politician. (1907 – 1999) was a French diplomat and politician who was Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1958 to 1968 and Prime Minister from 1968 to 1969 under the presidency of General de Gaulle. As foreign minister he played the leading role in the critical Franco-German treaty of cooperation in 1963, he laid the foundation for the Paris-Bonn axis that was central in building a united Europe. He was born Maurice Couve (his father acquired the name de Murville in 1925[1]) in Reims. Maurice Couve de Murville, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Birmingham (1929–2007), was his cousin.\n\nCouve de Murville joined the corps of finance inspectors in 1930, and in 1940 became Director of External Finances of the Vichy régime, in which capacity he sat at the armistice council of Wiesbaden. In March 1943, after the American landing in North Africa, he was one of the few senior officials of Vichy to join the Free French. He left for Algiers, via Spain, where he joined General Henri Giraud. On 7 June 1943, he was named commissioner of finance of the French Committee of National Liberation (CFLN). A few months later, he joined General Charles de Gaulle. In February 1945, he became a member of the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF) with the rank of ambassador attached to the Italian government.\n\nAfter the war, he occupied several posts as French Ambassador, in Cairo (1950 to 1954), at NATO (1954), in Washington (1955 to 1956) and in Bonn (1956 to 1958). When General de Gaulle returned to power in 1958, he became Foreign Minister, a post he retained for ten years until the reshuffle that followed the events of May 1968 where he replaced Finance minister Michel Debré, keeping this post only a short time: very soon after the elections, he became a transitional Prime Minister, replacing Georges Pompidou. The following year he was succeeded by Jacques Chaban-Delmas.\n\n​\n\nCouve de Murville continued his political career first as a UDR deputy, then RPR deputy for Paris until 1986, then as a senator until 1995. He died in Paris at the age of 92 from natural causes.\n\n​--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLucien Achille MAUZAN - (1883-1952) was a French painter, illustrator, poster artist, sculptor, and writer. He was known for his decorative illustrations during the Art Deco movement, and he designed over 2,000 posters and over 1,000 postcard images. Mauzan was born in Gap, Hautes-Alpes, France, and moved to Italy in 1905, where he divided his life between Milan, Paris, and Buenos Aires. He was an outstanding lithographer and produced about 1500 posters of films between 1909 and 1913, including posters of silent films1. Mauzan’s style was marked by humor and brilliant colors for advertisement and events. He also designed several war posters, including an adaptation of the famous Lord Kitchener poster. Mauzan passed away in Gap, France in 1952.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLeon Eugene CORNAND – (1876 – 1929). French Senator Leon Eugene\n\nLéon Eugène Cornand was a French politician, journalist, and cabaret owner. He was born on July 14, 1876, in Veynes, Hautes-Alpes, France, and died on May 29, 1929, in Paris, France 12. He was a socialist member of the French parliament, serving as a deputy from Isère during the 9th legislature and from Hautes-Alpes during the 13th legislature.\n\nAn active parliamentarian, he intervenes mainly on social issues, notably weekly rest or income tax. At the opening of the ordinary session of 1906, he took his place at the office, as senior secretary. He tabled two bills, the first on weekly rest (1906), the second on the nationalization of mines (1908). He spoke on the podium about: the public works budget for the 1908 financial year (1907), bills and proposed laws concerning income tax (1908), war budgets and posts and telegraphs of the financial year 1909 (1908), of the public education budget of the financial year 1910 (1910). And he raised a question about the arbitrary arrest of which he was the subject (1907). However, his political career was interrupted in 1910: coming third in the first round, he withdrew.\n\nThis failure led him to return to his region of origin. Elected mayor of Veynes in 1912, then general councilor of Hautes-Alpes in 1914, he left the SFIO to join the republican-socialists. That same year, he tried to regain a deputy seat, in the constituency of Gap, but with the same result as in Isère four years earlier.\n\nHe was finally elected in the legislative elections of 1924, but only sat in the House for a short time. He ran in the partial senatorial election caused by the death of Victor Bonniard, and was elected on August 17. Cornand registered with the group of French socialist republicans and socialists when he joined the Commission for Final Accounts and Economies. A few years later Cornand registered with the Democratic Left group, he belonged to the Commission for Hygiene, Social Assistance, Insurance and Welfare, and to the Special Commission for Sales and Pledge business funds. He tabled two bills: one tending to repeal articles 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the law of June 20, 1845 on the award of hunting rights and the issuance of special permits (1926), another aimed at granting amnesty to political offenses (1928).

He intervened during the discussion: of the labor, hygiene and social welfare budget for the financial year 1925 (1924) and of the bill reorganizing the administrative regime of the departments of Haut-Rhin, Bas- Rhine and Moselle (1925).\n\nHe died prematurely during his mandate, on May 29, 1929 in Paris. He was only 53 years old. President Paul Doumer delivered his eulogy at the following day's session: “Our Assembly had for him, he declared, the respect and esteem that it always grants to sincere convictions and persevering work. The untimely death of our colleague saddens us all. With a unanimous feeling, we join his family and his fellow citizens in mourning and preserving the memory of this good servant of the country. »\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLouis Mathieu MELEY - (1850 - 1924) French Patron & Philanthropist.\n\nLouis Mathieu Meley was a French philanthropist, art collector, and patron born on February 23, 1850 in Rive-de-Gier, France.

As an engineer, Eugéne Chaper participated in a period when engineering expertise was highly sought after for urban planning, railway construction, and military fortifications. His career coincided with the Second Empire under Napoleon III, where there was a strong emphasis on modernizing France’s infrastructure. This era saw the redesigning of Paris by Baron Haussmann and the expansion of the French rail network.\n\n​--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nClaire DE CASTELBAJAC – (1953–1975) was a kind, joyful, delightful young woman who worked in art restoration in Italy. Claire de Castelbajac was an angst-filled college student who was enmeshed in toxic friendships and barely even believed in God. Claire de Castelbajac died at only twenty-one. TO those who knew her, her brief existence was known to inspire miracles among the people she met and is being considered for sainthood.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAstier Nicolas (born 19 January 1989) is a French equestrian.\n\nHe represented his country at the 2016 Summer Olympics, where he won the gold medal in the team eventing and the silver in the individual eventing.​\n\n​-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nElisabeth BREMOND - (Alexandrine Élisabeth Brémond, born 28 October 1858 – 22 June 1898), known as Brémonde de Tarascon (in French) or Bremoundo de Tarascoun (in Occitan), was one of the best-known poets in France who wrote in the Occitan language. She was a member of the Félibrige, a society that tried to preserve the language and its literature.\n\nThe recurrent themes of her lyrical poetry include the contemplation of Nature, the link she maintained with the History of her region and the expression of her feelings as a woman; her verses express her enthusiasms as a young girl and her happiness and disappointments as a woman: love, hope and despair as well as amazement at the idea of Beauty.\n\nBorn in Tarascon, Bouches-du-Rhône, on 28 October 1858, her parents were Alexandre Brémond and Henriette Reynier. They owned and cultivated a farm in Trébon, near Arles, and soon after her birth acquired the Darbousille farm at Fontvieille, Bouches-du-Rhône, also near Arles. She grew up in modest circumstances. Alexandrine began writing poetry in Provençal under the pseudonym \"Brémonde de Tarascon\", or \"Bremoundo de Tarascouno\" in Provençal, and would become one of the best-known Provençal poets of her day.\n\nIn 1885, Brémonde de Tarascon was awarded the prize for poetry at the Grand Jo Flourau dou Felibrige (Great Floral Games of the Félibrige). The Grands Jeux Floraux have been held every seven years since 1878 by the Félibrige to reward the best writers in the Occitan language. The grand prize winner has the honor of choosing the Queen of the Félibrige, an honorary title that will be held for the next seven years. Brémonde de Tarascon chose Thérèse Roumanille, wife of Jules Boissière.\n\nOn 25 November 1886, she married the lawyer Joseph Gautier, who also wrote poetry. A few years later, her parents divorced. Alexandrine gave birth to a daughter, Marthe Gautier, in 1894. Marthe later became a police medical inspector in Paris. Alexandrine died of acute bronchitis on 22 June 1898 at the Darboussille farmhouse, aged 40. Her eulogy was pronounced by the poet Charloun Rieu. The town of Tarascon has given her name to one of its squares and erected a bust of the poetess. The bust, by sculptor Camille Soccorsi, was inaugurated on 2 May 1965.\n\nFrédéric Mistral (neveu) said Alexandrine Élisabeth Brémond was the most lyrical of the Provençal poets, and saw her as the literary sister of Théodore Aubanel. Her first work to appear in print was Li Blavet de Mount-Majour (The Blueberries of Montmajour, 1883). The poems celebrate flowers, pretty girls at the window, spring, laughter, the breeze in the trees and a serene song of young love, joy and hope. In Velo blanco (White Veil), which appeared in 1887, a girl who is bold and timid, who laughs and cries, sings her hopes; a woman speaks her love. The superb L'Amazone was included in the second volume of the Anthologie du Félibrige Provençal, edited by Charles Pierre Julian and Pierre Fontan.\n\nAlexandrine's next work, published five years later, was Brut de canèu (Sound of reeds). Frédéric Mistral wrote the preface. The collection is a second return to her childhood, the great plains of the Trébon of Arles where she saw her father's laborers tracing their furrows as far as the eye could see towards Montmajour, whose towers exalt the glory of God, towards the banks of the Vigueirat Marshes where she saw the fish spawn and the water lilies bloom, and towards the farmhouse at Darbousille where she gazed at the stars in the long summer evenings. Three poems are exceptional: Le maître d’aire; Aubanel, in honour of the great lyric poet; and Pluie d’étoiles (Rain of Stars), describing a flock of stars that turn into women as they touch the ground, the muses, dreamers and singers of all the ages.\n\nLou debanaire flouri (The Flowery Reel) with a preface by Paul Arène, was not published until 1908, ten years after her death. It was a collection of poems that had appeared in various publications during her life. One, in verses that leap like bulls, tells the legend of the Bulls of Peter. It is perhaps the best known.​\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPierre de FÉLICE - (1896- 1978) Member of Parliament, Senator, Secretary of State Foreign Affairs and then Agriculture. (1896-1978), French politician. Former radical-socialist deputy of Loiret and former minister. Born into a Protestant family, son of a pastor, Pierre de Félice followed studies which led him to the free school of political science, then to a doctorate in law.\n\nA lawyer at the Paris bar in 1926, he became involved in politics shortly after by joining the Radical Party. An intellectual specializing in rural law and agricultural economics, he is also a supporter of European construction. In 1928, he published a work, Realism, in which he defended this idea. Subsequently, he gave numerous conferences throughout France.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRose-Philippine DUCHESNE – (1769 - 1852)\n\nRose Philippine Duchesne was a French Catholic nun and educator who was born on August 29, 1769 in Grenoble, France. She immigrated to America as a missionary and is recognized for her care and education of Indigenous American survivors of the United States Indian removal programs. She was beatified on May 12, 1940, and canonized on July 3, 1988 by Pope John Paul II.\n\nShe considerably developed in America the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus founded in 1800 by Saint Madeleine-Sophie Barat, and evangelized the Potawatomi Indians. Philippine is the daughter of Pierre-François Duchesne , from Romans-sur-Isère , lawyer at the Parliament of Dauphiné , and Rose-Euphrasine Perier. Through her mother, she belonged to an extremely wealthy family from which Jean Casimir-Perier, President of the French Republic in 1894, came. She is also the niece of the banker Claude Perier who financed the coup d'état of 18 Brumaire with Perrégaux. ED 1 . She was educated by the Sisters of the Visitation.\n\nFrom the age of twelve, she wanted to become a nun. Her parents took her home, but her desire persisted and at the age of 17 she refused a marriage proposal. A year later, she entered the convent despite her parents' opposition. She still accepted the ban from her father, very involved in the political life of Grenoble since Tiles Day, who refused her any permission to take religious vows before the age of 25. Nevertheless, his father attended his taking of the habit on September 10, 1788, at the age of 19.\n\nShe was recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church and is celebrated on November 18th.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRené Arthaud (1915 - 2007) was a French politician. He served as a member of the National Assembly from 1946 to 1951, representing Vaucluse.[1][2] He was also the Minister of Public Health from 24 June 1946 to 16 December 1946.\n\nRené Arthaud was the son of Jeanne Ravel and Eli Rodolphe Arthaud, originally from Orpierre (Hautes-Alpes), who was radical general councilor of this canton, deputy mayor of Gap and president of the general council of Hautes-Alpes. At the end of his secondary studies in Gap, Marseille and Paris, René Arthaud opted for pharmacy and graduated from the Marseille faculty in 1941. But, from the age of 19, in 1934, he joined the Federal Union of Students and Communist Youth and served as a delegate to the World Student Congress in Brussels. In 1936 he became a member of the Communist Party and editor of the newspaper Rouge-Midi.\n\nMobilized in 1939 at the Bar-le-Duc hospital, he was in Laon on May 10, 1940. After the defeat and demobilization, he completed his studies and resumed the clandestine struggle in Avignon where he established himself as a pharmacist. René Arthaud organizes the National Front in Vaucluse and represents the Communist Party on the departmental liberation committee.\n\nPolitical career\n\nAugust 25, 1944, he was designated as deputy mayor of Avignon, functions which will be confirmed to him after the municipal elections of April 1945. In the elections of October 1945, at the first National Constituent Assembly, René Arthaud led the Communist Party list and received 36,578 votes, against 37,974 for the Socialist list (which had two elected officials) and 26,126 for the MRP list (one elected official).\n\nDuring this first mandate, René Arthaud belonged to the Family, Population and Public Health Commission as well as the Food Commission. In this capacity, he wrote several reports on proposed laws affecting the profession of pharmacist, pharmaceutical education or pharmacy technicians. December 30, 1945, he took part in the general discussion of the budget of the Ministry of Health, of which he criticized certain orientations: excessive emphasis placed on the population to the detriment of prophylaxis, too systematic subsidies to private works, particularly religious ones.\n\nIn the elections to the second National Constituent Assembly, René Arthaud again led the communist list, which obtained an almost identical score (36,339 votes) ahead, this time, of the SFIO list (31,044 votes), the radical list (28 845 votes) and the MRP list (24,587 votes). He belongs to the same Commissions as in the previous Assembly and accedes to the functions of Minister of Public Health in the Government of Georges Bidault, from June 24 to December 16, 1946. The brevity of this ministry hardly allows him to intervene in the debates.\n\nNovember 10, 1946, during the legislative elections, he further improved his electoral result with 39,877 votes against 31,270 for the radicals, 24,804 for the socialists and 22,022 for the MRP. René Arthaud returns to his position as Commissioner for Family and Population and is elected vice-president of this Commission. But during the legislature, he diversified his skills: he was part of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and that of Overseas Territories. In this capacity, he was appointed member of the Commission responsible for investigating the incidents that occurred in Côte d'Ivoire (May 9, 1950).\n\nDuring the legislature, René Arthaud was a particularly active parliamentarian. He tabled no less than thirty-two proposed laws or resolutions, some concerning his department, Vaucluse (for example, requests for subsidies for artistic events at the ancient theater of Orange or aid for affected farmers) although the Most of them relate to public health or pharmacy (status of hospital staff, creation of the Biochemical Products Company, etc.). René Arthaud also intervenes very often in sessions, notably as rapporteur for the Family Commission. March 6, 1947, he is worried, for example, about the excessive burdens weighing on the emerging social security system. The following July 17, he carried out a careful critical examination of the health budget and attributed the excessive infant mortality figure to insufficient prevention spending. December 5, 1947, while the Communist Party has moved into opposition, René Arthaud participates in the discussion of the government's questioning following the incidents which left three people dead in Valence during a demonstration by strikers; he in turn denounces the behavior of the police against the strikers of Avignon and Vaucluse. This harassment continues June 10, 1948 when he attacks the Poinso-Chapuis decree which, according to him, restored in a disguised manner the subsidies to private schools which existed under the Vichy government. René Arthaud at the same time pleads for the defense of secular schools. The following July 30, he again criticized the budget of the Ministry of Health which would favor the General Directorate of Population over the General Directorate of Health.\n\nBut, from August 19, 1948,\n\nRené Arthaud's most important interventions in the debates are devoted to the denunciation of the government's Atlanticist policy (Marshall Plan) and the Indochina War. December 22, 1949, during the general discussion of the budget, he attacked, in very harsh terms, “colonial exploitation”. He returns to the charge on the same subject on January 28, 1950, during the discussion of the bill regulating relations between France and the new associated states of Indochina. He pays tribute to the Vietminh struggle and concludes by calling for recognition of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, its independence and the withdrawal of the expeditionary force. This intervention led the same day to an incident which opposed him to the socialist deputy for Vaucluse, Charles Lussy.\n\nIn February of the same year, René Arthaud filed a request for an inquiry into the policy of provocation carried out, according to him, by the Government against the leaders of the African Democratic Rally. This is once again the occasion for a polemical discussion on French colonialism in Africa which pits him against the Minister of Overseas France. The events at the end of the legislature provided him with many other subjects to renew his attacks against \"American imperialism\" or the colonial policy of France: for example, November 22, 1950, during an arrest which followed French setbacks in the Tonkinese delta, he underlined the demoralization of the expeditionary force and called for immediate peace, or even November 27. Next, during the discussion of the draft overseas labor code, he denounced the numerous abuses from which, according to him, workers in the colonies suffered.\n\nIn the elections of June 17, 1951, René Arthaud once again heads the communist list and collects 39,258 votes. Despite the stability of his list, he was a victim of the relationship system and he was a radical who obtained the fourth seat in the department to his detriment. In compensation, the Communist Party had him appointed advisor to the French Union, a position for which his interventions on overseas problems had prepared him. He only sits in this assembly from October 9, 1952. On January 13, 1953 the authorities of his party forced him to resign for having supported theses too close to those of the socialists. By the summer of 1952, he had also left the post of director of the communist periodical La Renaissance du Vaucluse.\n\nHe then abandoned political life.\n\nHe created the Landy pharmacy in Aubervilliers in the 1960s, then another pharmacy-laboratory in Sarcelles.\n\nRetired, Yoga teacher, he lived in Apt in the mid-1980s then returned to Paris after the death of his wife in 1991.\n\n​--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChâteau de Vizille - The castle park has a total of 130 hectares (320 acres) of space, and is the most popular site in the Isère department with 804,511 visitors in 2008.\n\nThe Château as a Monument\n\nOne of the owners Adolphe-Joseph-Scipion Perier, son of Augustin Perier was married to a granddaughter of General Lafayette.\n\nThe Perier family owned it until 1895, during which time the castle itself was made a monument historique in 1862.\n\nIn 1924 the castle became the property of the French State and in 1973 the castle was given by the French government to the Community Council of Isere.\n\nThe park was classified as a historic monument on 23 August 1991. The design of the park dates from the 19th century.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
