        "text": "Prior to the Danubian Revolution,\n\nthere is context behind it on why it happened in a short spam of time. Historians in the 20th Century like to point the Raid of the Palais Modena as the main event which inspired the later Danubian Revolution.\n\nRiot of the Palais Modena\n\nIn St. Leopold day of 1883, the Saint of Vienna and Austria, a big strike started, being lead by Victor Adler, a prominent doctor and socialist leader of the city. The strike was due to the impoverished workers of a nearby steelworks metalurgy. What it was originally a peaceful strike in front of the President Office ended as a bloodbath, when the Minister-President of Austria, Eduard Taaffe, sent the guards and policemen to fight back the workers.\n\nTo give more context, the president had a very strict policy against Socialist Movements, as Marxism was seen as an issue for the Empire stability. The Paris Commune was 12 years ago yet the politicians around Europe got conscient on the importance of the labor movements and did shy reforms to improve the workers well-being.\n\nEvents\n\n9:30 - The Strike started in front of the Palais Modena.\n\n10:00 - As more workers come, the ambient gets heated.\n\n10:40 - Eduard Taaffe goes to the balcony and tries unsuccessfully to calm the strikers.\n\n10:45 - The president start the crackdown on the rally.\n\n11:00 - The policemen from all around the city act violently against the strikers.\n\n11:07 - The door of the Palais Modena burns and the steelwork workers enter the Palace.\n\n11:15 - The policemen recieve an order to fire against the rioters. First casualties.\n\n11:50 - The Emperor gets notified of the Incident.\n\n12:15 - The rioters start to withdraw and leave the place, after more than 70 deaths.\n\n12:17 - The narrow streets become a mortal trap for the workers, over 500 rioters get shot to death.\n\n12:30 - The leader of the rally, Victor Adler gets captured and imprisoned.\n\n17:05 - The Emperor Franz Joseph calls Eduard Taaffe immediately and moves him back to the Tyrol, where he served as governor before.\n\n17:35 - Victor Adler gets released by the Emperor, feared that would cause more deaths in the capital.\n\nPrior to the incident, the powerful spheres of Vienna supported German Pan-Nationalism and an unification with Germany, leaving Hungary alone. But the massacre changed the approach to it, as the majority of the casualties were Hungarian migrants. The people of Vienna sympathized with the victims and the Austrian Socialist Movement changed their views to more federalist stances, the same stances that the Liberal Party supported and the ones that Eduard Taaffe was not really fond of it.\n\nIn Budapest, where the news would reach it pretty fast, it was seen as an attack to the Hungarians yet still praised how the Emperor reacted. Some days after the incident, the Emperor was forced from his close circles to legalize and specially loose the anti-socialist laws.\n\nFrom the other powers of Europe, the different heads of government thought it was the start of a new Paris Commune. They feared that the Emperor would get overthroned. A wave of relaxing the laws against socialists happened in Europe, to ensure that it wont happen in the different capitals, but at long term the number of socialists only grew massively.\n\nAdler and Friedjung managed to calm the waters of Vienna, and preached reformist socialism. Meanwhile at the Imperial Palace, the aristocracy overreacted as they were out of touch with the proletarian classes.\n\nThe Budapest Manifesto, 13 of April, 1887\n\nIn the next years after the Riot of Palais Modena, the new appointed ministers of Cisleithania (The non-hungarian or croatian parts of the empire) failed to get rid of the diverse movements that started as a countermovement to Pan-Germanism which was the idea endorsed by the Austrian upper classes. Meanwhile in Budapest, the Riot of Palace Modena was seen as a demostration that the commonfolk of Austria wasn't ideologically aligned to their elites, so hungarian danubian circles started to flourish in Budapest. The Pan-Danubian movement was not seen as a proletarian one but an anti-german one.\n\nYears passed and the danubian circles of Wien and Budapest grew in the elites meanwhile the working classes established Pro-Danubian unions which were mainly hidden from the bureaucracy and sometimes had the protection of the nobility. The National Party of the Danube was founded in the winter of 1886 but got banned and persecuted. Meanwhile other parties had wings aligned with the anti-german ideas but were still based on strongly ideological bases like the Social-Democratic Party of Austria.\n\nGoing back to Hungary/Transleithania, the Liberal Party was encouraging a magyarization of the minorities and usually did side with Austrian Politics, but of course with an unstable Austria, the emperor had to direct sometimes the politics of the nation. This caused that the hungarian opposition to the Liberal Party, mainly independentists and autonomists feared a sudden takeover of their politics.\n\nKálmán Tisza, the Prime Minister of Hungary was very popular as he had been elected four times prior to the revolution and did tremendous improvements to the hungarian economy. The emperor held many talks between 1885 and 1887, where they debated primarily about the state of Cisleithania. After some failed governments there, the emperor did a speech on Budapest on January 1887 to compliment the hardwork the hungarian parliament did (which was mainly forced by Kálmán Tisza) and said some risky pro-german rhetoric, in a parliament where the main opposition is against it. In the years which the Prime Minister worked togheter with the Emperor on Austrian affairs, kinda shifted the ideas of our Pro-Austrian Hungarian Prime Minister into supporting an even more symbiotic relationship between the two main kingdoms that conformed the empire. Some of the autonomist opposition which were mainly pan-danubian drones at the time also supported the ideas.\n\nIn April of the same year, Kálmán Tisza and the two main leaders of the Riot of the Palace Modena, Victor Adler and Heinrich Friedjung. Had some meetings with hungarian danubian circles leaders and wrote the Budapest Manifesto.\n\nManifesto of the Hungarian Parliament April 13, 1887\n\nI, Kálmán Tisza, member of the Hungarian Parliament, along with our colleagues from the Danubian Circles and Victor Adler, declare our support for a Federal Danubian Monarchy.\n\nThe recent instability and turmoil in the Austrian government is a clear sign that the current system of the Austrian-Hungarian Dual Monarchy is not working. The rapid turnover of governments in Vienna has resulted in a lack of consistent and effective leadership, causing confusion and uncertainty for the people.\n\nIn contrast, the Hungarian government has been stable and effective, with a strong opposition that holds the government accountable. Our country has been able to make significant progress, due in part to the strength of our democratic system.\n\nIt is our belief that a Federal Danubian Monarchy, based on the principles of national sovereignty and equal representation, is the solution to the challenges we face. Under this new system of government, the unique needs and perspectives of each region will be respected and protected, while promoting unity and cooperation among the member states.\n\nWe are confident that this new system of government will bring stability, prosperity, and progress to our country. It will encourage innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth, while also promoting social justice and equality for all citizens. Apart from creating a bright future for our hungarian people and nobility.\n\nWe call on all citizens of the Danubian Federation to join us in this effort to build a brighter and more prosperous future for our country. Together, we can create a government that truly represents and serves the needs of all its citizens.\n\nSigned, Kálmán Tisza, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Hungary and Victor Adler, Danubian Proletarian Leader.\n\nThey supported to mantain the monarchy of Franz Joseph, they also got inspiration from the Revolutions of 1848. Which got the support of the Independence Party and therefore with the big majority of the Liberal Party, legitimized the Manifesto. In the first two days, they got support of the majority of Budapest, with few casualties. Still the Emperor would not get the news until some days later\n\nMeanwhile, the Political Earthquake was heading directly into Wien, Victor Adler took a train with some hungarian supporters. But that is for another day.\n\nEntrance into Vienna, 24-25 of April, 1887\n\nAfter the Manifest of Budapest, the revolutionaries planned on how to accomplish the goal. They had the support of the Hungarian Aristocracy and suposely from also the higher circles in Vienna and some unions. The main leaders of the movement reached the city by train, just some days after the news reached Wien. There was tension in the air, that you could cut it through with a knife. As the movement was more persecuted in Vienna as it was seen as Anti-Monarchist and Proletarian, the revolutionaries had to occupy the city fast.\n\nAdler and Friedjung then did a speech in one of the Danubian Circles place, and informed the local leaders on the situation in Budapest. Meanwhile they were planning, the network of danubian clubs across the empire were being noticed of the news and also planning to overthrone their local and regional authorities. After some days of preparation, a raid into the palace of Hofburg was finally executed, shortly followed by a raid into Schönbrunn Palace, where the Emperor was staying. The emperor called all the military and guards near the palace to aid him, but due to the sudden riot, that it was dark, and some soldiers changing sides, the defences did not manage to bring a solid structure.\n\nEvents\n\n19:20 - A group of 1800 people surround Hofburg Palace.\n\n20:00 - The rebels violently fight the guards, which some guards change sides.\n\n20:45 - The rebels start entering the complex, which also ends with severe looting.\n\n20:58 - A fire starts in the Swiss Wing of the Palace.\n\n22:00 - The palace is under Danubian Control\n\n22:10 - Some of the rioters start heading south, to join the other people into Schönbrunn.\n\n22:20 - The militar batallions in Vienna are urgently called to Schönbrunn, to protect the Emperor.\n\n22:30 - The rioters reach the palace and start surrounding it, a group of 2600 people. Including Adler.\n\n22:54 - Former PM Eduard Taaffe is assasinated in his house, by danubian militants.\n\n23:15 - The rioters enter the palace, the guards and the military protecting the palace start charging against the peasants.\n\n23:30 - The Emperor is tracked down by the rioters who try to kill him but it is brought to Adler.\n\n23:45 - Adler pardons the life of the Emperor and proclaims the Danubian Federation, the Emperor is put into house arrest.\n\nAt midnight, the civil war just started. The news were widely spread from Vienna with the telephones and telegraphs. The next day, Bratislava was succesfully occupied but apart from that, the expansion into rural areas would be very slow initially. The first days after the incident, the citizens started to build barricades and defences, and in Hungary, it would spread faster.\n\nThe first weeks of the war, the Bohemian Revolution starts and in Krakow fights start to reclaim their independence.\n\nMap of Austria-Hungary, 1 of May of 1887\n\nProvisional Timeline of the Danubian Federation Part I (1882-1932)\n\n1882 - Riot of the Palais Modena, start of the Danubian Movement.\n\nVictor Adler - First Mandate (1887-1896) - Socialdemocrats\n\n1887 - Budapest Manifest. creation of the Provisional Danubian Government by Victor Adler in Austria and Kálmán Tisza in Hungary.\n\nJanuary 1889 - Creation of the Austrian Republic and the Hungarian Republic under the Federation.\n\nMarch 1889 - Creation of the Venetian Compromise with Italy, the Venetian Republic is created but not absorbed into the Federation.\n\nApril 1891 - Creation of the Serbian and the Croatian Republics under the Federation.\n\nMay 1891 - Creation of the Moldovan, Wallachian and Bulgarian Republics under the Federation.\n\n1892 - Proclamation of the Danubian Federation, Victor Adler is elected Chairman by the seven republics.\n\nHeinrich Friedjung - First Mandate (1896-1900) - Liberal + Socialdemocrats\n\n1896 - First elections of the Danubian Federation, Heinrich Friedjung is elected Chairman.
