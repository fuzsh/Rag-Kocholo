        "text": "June 24, 1894\n\nFrench President Sadi Carnot is assassinated in Lyon by an Italian anarchist, Caserio.\n\nJune 27, 1894\n\nJean Casimir-Périer becomes the new President of the Republic.\n\nJuly 20, 1894\n\nInfantry Major Ferdinand Walsin-Esterhazy who, through occasional contacts with the General Staff, was exposed to classified French information, offers his services to the German Military Attaché, Lieutenant-Colonel von Schwartzkoppen, promising to pass on military secrets.\n\nAugust 15, 1895\n\nEsterhazy receives payment by Schwartzkoppen for delivering classified mobilization documents.\n\nSeptember 26, 1894\n\nThe French Intelligence Services intercept a message (from Esterhazy, but not signed), received Sept 1, 1894 by Schwartzkoppen. From the nature of the leaks in this memorandum -- the \"bordereau,\"-- they conclude that the spy must be an artillery officer and a member of the General Staff.\n\nIn addition, the traitor may have been in contact with different bureaus as an intern.\n\nOctober 6, 1894\n\nAfter a brief inquiry, only half a dozen officers seem to match the description, including Captain Alfred Dreyfus, an artillery officer on the General Staff. He is from Alsace, a French province under German rule since the Franco-Prussian war (1870-1871), and some members of his wealthy family still reside there. As a probationary officer since January 1893, he has rotated through most of the bureaus of the Ministry of War. He is also Jewish, a fact noted by Sandherr and his deputy Colonel Fabre, both openly antisemitic. They communicate their unsupported suspicions to General Mercier, the Minister of War in the Charles Dupuy Cabinet.\n\nOctober 15, 1894\n\nAfter consulting reputable handwriting experts, but still lacking incriminating evidence, General Mercier along with the heads of the General Staff, General de Boisdeffre and his deputy in charge of Intelligence, General Gonse, are now convinced that Dreyfus has been privy to the information leaked to the Germans. In order to obtain an irrefutable handwriting sample, Commandant du Paty de Clam, placed in charge of the investigation, calls Dreyfus and feigns to dictate him a letter based on the wording of the \"bordereau.\" Since the two documents appear to match, Dreyfus is accused of spying and arrested, despite his protestations of innocence. He is sent immediately to the Cherche-Midi military prison.\n\nOctober 31, 1894\n\nThrough a leak from the Headquarters, Edouard Drumont, the publisher of the anti-Semitic paper La Libre Parole, learns of Captain Dreyfus's indictment. The evening issue of Le Soir publicly identifies him, followed the next day by La Libre Parole, which starts a virulent campaign against the Jewish officer.\n\nNovember 3, 1894.\n\nMajor d'Ormescheville starts the judicial investigation of the case. His final report, Dec. 3, 1894, recommends a Court-martial.\n\nDecember 19-22, 1894\n\nDuring the Dreyfus Court-martial, held in closed session, the judges still hesitate over the evidence, including a ludicrous demonstration from the handwriting expert Bertillon. Obeying orders from General Mercier, Major Henry gives the judges an incriminating file which contains a letter dated May 1894 from the Italian Military Attaché mentioning \"this scoundrel of D...\" However, in the name of national security, Dreyfus' defense lawyer Edgar Demange, a civilian, is not made aware of this \"dossier secret\".\n\nThe Military Court is now persuaded by the evidence and thus unanimously pronounces Dreyfus guilty of high treason. Professing his innocence, he is nevertheless condemned to perpetual deportation and military degradation.\n\nDecember 31, 1894\n\nDreyfus' petition for appeal is rejected.\n\nJanuary 5, 1895\n\nThe degradation takes place in public in the courtyard of the Ecole Militaire. A warrant-officer strips him of his badges and buttons, then draws Dreyfus' sword from its scabbard and snaps it across his knee. During the ordeal, sincere patriots along with an anti-Semitic mob unleash shouts of anger at \"the traitor,\" who continues to maintain that they are punishing the wrong man.\n\nMany newspapers echo Dreyfus' alleged confession to Captain Lebrun-Renaud.\n\nJanuary 17, 1895\n\nPresident of the Republic Félix Faure succeeds President Jean Casimir-Périer who has resigned over a minor political dispute .\n\nNew Cabinet, with Prime Minister Alexandre Ribot. Ludovic Trarieux, Justice Minister.\n\nFebruary 22, 1895\n\nDreyfus begins his journey to the penitentiary in French Guyana.\n\nMarch 12, 1895\n\nDreyfus arrives in French Guyana.\n\nApril 13, 1895\n\nDreyfus is transferred to Devil's Island, where he will be placed in solitary confinement.\n\nJuly 1, 1895\n\nAfter a long illness, Colonel Sandherr is dying. A new Chief of Intelligence Services, Lieutenant-Colonel Georges Picquart, another Alsatian like Dreyfus, is chosen among the General staff officers, bypassing Major Henry.\n\nOctober 28, 1895\n\nNew Cabinet, with Prime Minister Léon Bourgeois.\n\nMarch 1896\n\nAnother express letter from the German Embassy --\"le petit bleu\"-- which this time identifies Major Esterhazy-- is intercepted.\n\nApril 29, 1896\n\nNew Cabinet, with Prime Minister Jules Méline. General Billot is Minister of War.\n\nJuly, 30 1896\n\nOpening the Dreyfus file, Picquart is able to compare the Esterhazy's handwriting with that of the \"bordereau\" and gradually realizes that all the evidence brought against Dreyfus in 1894 are wrong.\n\nAugust 5, 1896\n\nPicquart informs the Chief of the General Staff, General de Boisdeffre, of his suspicions about Esterhazy as the actual spy.\n\nSeptember 3, 1896\n\nEfforts by Picquart to convince the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, General Gonse, of Dreyfus' innocence again prove unsuccessful. He is now considered as a whistle-blower who could bring embarrassment to the General Staff if he keeps insisting in reopening Dreyfus' earlier investigation.\n\nThe English press is circulating the false news of Dreyfus' escape from Devil's island.\n\nImmediate measures are taken to prevent any future attempts. At night, Dreyfus is kept in irons.\n\nSeptember 14, 1896\n\nTipped by a leak from Headquarters, an article in L'Eclair mentions for the first time the incriminating secret file communicated to the judges alone during the trial of December 1894. In trying to definitely prove Dreyfus' treason, the paper even quotes -wrongly, but conveniently- the letter mentioning \"this scoundrel of D...\" now transformed into \"this scoundrel of Dreyfus\".\n\nSeptember 18, 1896\n\nCiting the revelation of a secret file as new evidence for a mistrial, Lucie Dreyfus petitions the Chamber of Deputies in the name of her husband.\n\nHenry starts tampering with documents in order to incriminate definitely Dreyfus and discredit Picquart later.\n\nOctober 27, 1896\n\nGeneral de Boisdeffre and General Gonse transfer Picquart from his position and send him to a mission far removed from Paris.\n\nOctober 31, 1896\n\nWith Picquart now out of the way, Major Henry conveniently produces new evidence: a letter allegedly from the Italian Embassy to the German Attaché specifically naming Dreyfus as their contact. This document, fabricated by master-forger Lemercier-Picard -an agent of Henry-, will be later known as \"le faux Henry.\"\n\nNovember 6, 1896\n\nThe wife and the brother of the convicted officer, Lucie and Mathieu Dreyfus, continue to fight untiringly in the hope of a fairer trial. Inspired by their efforts, the writer Bernard-Lazare publishes his brochure Une Erreur judiciaire [A Judicial Error: The Truth on the Dreyfus Affair ] in Brussels, marking the point of departure for a retrial.\n\nNovember 10, 1896\n\nThanks to another leak from Headquarters, Le Matin boastingly publishes the copy of the first incriminating document of 1894, the \"bordereau,\" as evidence of Dreyfus' treason.\n\nDecember 26, 1896\n\nGeneral Gonse sends trouble-maker Picquart to a dangerous mission in Tunisia where rebels are rising up against French colonial rule.\n\nFebruary 7, 1898\n\nJules Guérin organizes the Ligue antisémitique française.\n\nJune, 21-26, 1897\n\nOn a short leave in Paris, fearing retaliation, Picquart shares his convictions with the lawyer Louis Leblois, a long time friend from Alsace, but asks him not to reveal publicly his secret nor the name of Esterhazy.\n\nJuly 13, 1897\n\nPicquart's lawyer Leblois meets with the Vice-President of the Senate, the Alsatian Auguste Scheurer-Kestner, who becomes convinced of Dreyfus's innocence as well and starts his own investigation. However, sworn to secrecy by Leblois, and because the Intelligence Office still keeps all documents restricted to civilians, Scheurer-Kestner cannot find any significant proof of the frame-up. Even during an interview with Mathieu Dreyfus, Scheurer-Kestner refuses identifying Esterhazy because of his promise of silence to Leblois.\n\nUnable to provide evidence of his claim, the cancer ridden Scheurer-Kestner is ridiculed by the anti-Semitic press as totally senile and bribed by a Jewish interest lobby, “le Syndicat”.\n\nAugust 17, 1897\n\nWar Minister General Billot has Esterhazy retired from active duty in the Army \"for temporary infirmity,\" because is has become an embarrassment.\n\nOctober 16, 1897\n\nAt a meeting with Billot, Gonse, Henry and du Paty de Clam decide to warn Esterhazy of the accusations pointed at him.\n\nOctober 18, 1897\n\nEsterhazy receives a letter conceived by dy Paty de Clam, written by Mme Henry and signed \"Espérance\", warning him to be more careful.\n\nOctober 23, 1897\n\nEsterhazy sees Schwartzkoppen for the last time. Later that day, in parc Montsouris, he has a secret interview with du Paty de Clam in disguise, who promises to protect him..\n\nOctober 29, 1897\n\nScheurer-Kestner has an inconclusive interview with President Félix Faure.\n\nOctober 30, 1897\n\nScheurer-Kestner has lunch with his old friend General Billot, who asks him to be patient.\n\nNovember 3, 1897\n\nScheurer-Kestner has an interview with Prime Minister Méline.\n\nNovember 6, 1897\n\nBernard-Lazare meets with Emile Zola.\n\nNovember 8, 1897\n\nLeblois visits Zola.\n\nNovember 10, 1897\n\nEsterhazy, with Henry or du Paty de Clam's approval, sends anonymous letters to Scheurer-Kestner requesting clandestine meetings, then has his mistress, Marguerite Pays, address mysterious notes signed \"Speranza\" and \"Blanche\" to Picquart. Forged messages are also planted in his file to make him appear as the fabricator of the \"petit bleu,\" which he himself had discovered in March 1896.\n\nNovember 11, 1897\n\nBy a twist of fate, Mr. de Castro, a stock-broker from South America, notices a facsimile of the bordereau on sale at a newspaper stand -- thanks to Mathieu Dreyfus' efforts to publicize it as much as possible, in the hope that someone would recognize the handwriting. Realizing that it matches that of one of his clients, Major Esterhazy, he immediately contacts Mathieu Dreyfus.\n\nNovember 12, 1897\n\nMathieu Dreyfus goes to see Scheurer-Kestner to check if Esterhazy is the same individual whose identity he has sworn not to reveal. Scheurer-Kestner can finally confirms that Esterhazy is the actual traitor.\n\nNovember 12-13. 1897\n\nAt his home, Scheurer-Kestner has a meeting with Matthieu Dreyfus, Leblois and Zola.\n\nOn Devil's Island, Dreyfus' hut is surrounded by a double eight feet high stockade.\n\nNovember 13, 1897\n\nGerman authorities order Schwartzkoppen to leave his post in Paris.\n\nNovember 15, 1897\n\nScheurer-Kestner declares Dreyfus innocent in an open letter to Le Temps.\n\nSchwartzkoppen leaves Paris for his new position.\n\nNovember 16, 1897\n\nMathieu Dreyfus writes the Minister of Justice denouncing Esterhazy as the author of the \"bordereau\" and sues him.\n\nNovember 17, 1897\n\nBecause of the accusation, the Military Governor of Paris, General Saussier, orders the opening of an inquest on Esterhazy conducted by General de Pellieux.\n\nNovember 25, 1897\n\nZola starts a campaign in favor of Dreyfus' cause in Le Figaro.\n\nNovember 26, 1897\n\nPicquart is recalled to Paris to be questioned as part of the Esterhazy investigation.\n\nNovember 28, 1897\n\nLe Figaro starts publishing a correspondence from Esterhazy that one of his spurned mistresses, Madame de Boulancy, has communicated to the newspaper in which he vents his contempt for the French, even dreaming to become a German Uhlan and be able to slaugher as many French soldiers as possible.\n\nDecember 3, 1897\n\nGeneral de Pellieux's inquest exonerating Esterhazy is followed by a second judicial investigation on him, conducted by Major Ravary.\n\nDecember 4, 1897\n\nPrime Minister Jules Méline declares at the National Assembly: \"There is NO Dreyfus affair whatsoever.\"\n\nDecember 7, 1897\n\nScheurer-Kestner tries to rally his colleagues at the Senate but no avail.\n\nDecember 13, 1897\n\nZola publishes \"Letter to youth.\"\n\nDecember 26, 1897\n\nThree handwriting experts, Belhomme, Varinard and Couard, declare the bordereau not to be by Esterhazy's hand.\n\nJanuary 1, 1898\n\nFinal report by Ravary concludes that a case against Esterhazy lacks evidence and that there is no need for Court-martial. General Saussier however decides with Esterhazy that demanding a Court-martial is the best course to clear him completely.\n\nJanuary 4, 1898\n\nZola publishes \"Letter to France.\"\n\nJanuary 10-11, 1898\n\nEsterhazy is brought to trial, which is soon held in closed session. He is quickly unanimously acquitted by the Court-martial.\n\nIronically, Colonel Picquart is indicted for revealing military secrets to civilians and is put under arrest at the Mont-Valérien military prison.\n\nUnder pressure from the Dreyfus family, Scheurer-Kestner meets with more celebrities who now believe that Dreyfus has been unfairly convicted. Among those \"intellectuals\", as they are referred to by the anti-Dreyfusard press, are Joseph Reinach, Marcel Prévost, Anatole France, Georges Clemenceau , and Emile Zola.\n\nJanuary 13, 1898\n\nIn the journal L'Aurore, under the political editorship of Georges Clemenceau, Emile Zola publishes an open \"Letter to the President of the Republic\" accusing the military of scheming to bring about Dreyfus' disgrace and the handwriting experts of being totally blind. Entitled as a full page headline \"J'accuse...!\" by Clemenceau, the pamphlet is intended is to force the reopening of the Dreyfus Case, provided that Zola's accusations are not found to be slanderous.\n\nThe Chamber of Deputies votes to bring Zola to trial.\n\nScheurer-Kestner's term as Vice-president of the Senate is not renewed.\n\nIn Algiers, violent antisemitic riots are taking place.\n\nJanuary 14-16, 1898\n\nL'Aurore publishes a series of petitions by \"intellectuals\" - writers, scholars, scientists - calling for a retrial. Marcel Proust, one of the initiators, succeeds in obtaining the decisive support of Anatole France’s signature.\n\nJanuary 18, 1898\n\nBillot lodges a formal judicial complaint against Zola and L'Aurore.\n\nJanuary 21, 1898\n\nThe three handwriting experts, \"accused\" by Zola, start a formal suit for libel.\n\nFebruary 7-23, 1898\n\nEmile Zola's trial takes place in the Cour d'Assises de la Seine (Palace of Justice, Paris) with Clemenceau 's brother and Labori as his defense.\n\nHis sensationalistic trial hearings are accompanied by numerous incidents: witnesses are silenced; General de Boisdeffre intimidates the Jury; opponents begin a campaign to defame Zola's family; anti-Semitic hoodlums mob the Court premises; and Drumont, then Picquart and Henry fight in a duel; riots erupt in Paris. Public opinion is divided: out of sincere concern or for more absurd reasons, every level of society becomes involved and takes sides.\n\nDuring the trial, however, General de Pellieux inadvertently acknowledges the existence of the secret file that was distributed to the judges at Dreyfus' unfair military trial of 1894 and quotes the document produced by Henry Oct. 31 1896, the \"faux Henry,\" thereby offering new evidence for a re-trial.\n\nFebruary 20, 1898\n\nThe Ligue des Droits de l'Homme et du citoyen [League for Human and Civic Rights] is founded.\n\nLudovic Trarieux is its first President, assisted by Emile Duclaux, Edouard Grimaux and Francis de Pressensé.\n\nFebruary 23, 1898\n\nZola is convicted and receives the maximum sentence for libel: one year in jail and a fine of 3000 Francs.\n\nFebruary 26, 1898\n\nBy decree, Picquart is dismissed from the Army\n\nZola appeals against the judgement\n\nMarch 13, 1898.\n\nLemercier-Picard, author of the forged letter quoted by General de Pellieux a month earlier (the \"faux Henry\"), is found hanging from the window-catch of his hotel bedroom. Circumstances of death remain unclear.\n\nApril 2, 1898\n\nAgreeing on reason of legal technicality, the Court of Appeals overturns the verdict of February 23 granting Zola a new trial.\n\nMay 23, 1898\n\nSecond Zola trial in Versailles. Labori appeals. Suspension.\n\nIn his Petit Journal, Ernest Judet publishes \"Zola Père et fils,\" an article in which he defames the past of Zola's father.\n\nMay 24, 1898\n\nZola sues Judet for libel.\n\nMay 15, 1898.\n\nThe Méline government resigns.\n\nJune 16, 1898\n\nThe Court of Appeals rejects Labori's appeal filed May 23.\n\nJune 28, 1898\n\nNew Cabinet with Henri Brisson as Prime Minister. Godefroy Cavaignac is Minister of War.\n\nJuly 7, 1898\n\nIn an attempt to close the case by producing genuine proofs, Cavaignac, unwittingly presents the National Assembly documents which include a piece of forged evidence, \"le faux Henry\". Picquart and the Socialist leader Jean Jaurès, however, publicly denounce the falseness of this evidence and challenge Cavaignac.\n\nJuly 9, 1898\n\nZola is convicted of libel in the three handwriting experts' libel trial: 2 weeks suspended prison sentence, fine of 2000 Francs, plus 5000 Francs in damages to each of the handwriting experts.\n\nJuly 12, 1898\n\nEsterhazy is charged with swindling his nephew and having sent forged telegrams to Picquart in November 1897.\n\nJuly 13, 1898\n\nPicquart arrested for the second time on charges brought by Cavaignac for having divulged military documents to Leblois, a civilian.\n\nJuly 18, 1898\n\nSecond Zola trial, in Versailles.\n\nZola is convicted again and sentenced to one year in prison and fined 2,000 Francs.\n\nIn order to avoid the notice of the sentence being served and to continue fighting, Zola takes refuge in England. Labori files for appeal.\n\nJuly 19, 1898\n\nLabori appeals the verdict of the three handwriting experts.\n\nJuly 26, 1898\n\nZola is suspended from the Légion d'honneur.\n\nAugust 3, 1898\n\nJudet and Le Petit Journal are convicted of libel.\n\nAugust 5, 1898\n\nThe Court of Appeals rejects the appeal of July 19.\n\nAugust 10, 1898\n\nThe Court of Appeals stiffens the penalties awarded to the handwriting experts: Zola is sentenced to one month in jail, a fine of 2000 Francs and 10,000 Francs in damages to each expert.\n\nAugust 12, 1898\n\nAll charges against Esterhazy are dismissed.\n\nAugust 13, 1898\n\nWhile browsing through the still-classified Dreyfus file in the Intelligence office, Captain Cuignet (although an ardent anti-Dreyfusard) realizes that some of the documents have been forged, especially the one naming Dreyfus as a German agent. This particular document is the one so conveniently produced by Lt.-Col. Henry in October 1896 (the \"faux Henry\") and that Cavaignac has mentionned in the National Assembly, on July 7. Cuignet accuses Henry of having forged the documents to insure Dreyfus’ certain condemnation. Henry's still debatable motives might have been to cover Esterhazy (possibly then used as a double agent) and protect his superiors from self-incrimination.\n\nAugust 27, 1898\n\nEsterhazy dismissed from the army for \"habitual misconduct.\"\n\nAugust 30-31, 1898\n\nHenry confesses his perjuries against Dreyfus to Cavaignac. He is interned at the military prison, Mont-Valérien, where he commits suicide by slashing his throat with a razor.\n\nGenerals de Boisdeffre and de Pellieux request to be relieved from their duties.\n\nEsterhazy flees to Belgium, then to England.\n\nSeptember 3, 1898\n\nMinister of War Cavaignac resigns, and his statement is posted throughout France.\n\nLucie Dreyfus petitions once more the Chamber of Deputies requesting a retrial for her husband.\n\nSeptember 5, 1898\n\nGeneral Zurlinden, Military Governor of Paris, becomes Minister of War.\n\nSeptember 6, 1898\n\nNationalist writer Charles Maurras writes an eulogy for Henry, a “man of honor” who wrote a “patriotic forgery.”\n\nSeptember 17, 1898\n\nGeneral Zurlinden refuses to consider the possibility of a retrial, then resigns. He is replaced by General Chanoine, but is reinstated in his former function as Military Governor of Paris.\n\nSeptember 20, 1898\n\nZurlinden orders inquiries against Picquart to start.\n\nSeptember 21, 1898\n\nA trial against Picquart and Leblois is postponed.\n\nSeptember 22, 1898\n\nPicquart remains under arrest and is brought to the Cherche-Midi military prison.\n\nSeptember 26, 1898\n\nCiting new evidence, Prime Minister Brisson submits the Dreyfus file to the Court of Cassation requesting a retrial.\n\nSeptember 29, 1898\n\nThe Court accepts to conduct an investigation of the Dreyfus facts.\n\nSeptember-October 1898\n\nFashoda crisis between England and France.\n\nOctober 11, 1898\n\nIn order for the fine of the August 10 verdict (the equivalent of $ 300,000 today) to be paid in cash, a distraint order is placed on Zola's estate: his furniture and private belongings of his home, rue de Bruxelles, are put up for sale in an in absentia public auction. Editor Eugène Fasquelle buys the first item, Zola's desk, for the total amount of the fine, 32,000 Francs, thus closing the sale.\n\nOctober 25, 1898\n\nGeneral Chanoine resigns.\n\nViolent antisemitic demonstrations in Paris.\n\nOctober 26, 1898\n\nThe Brisson Cabinet resigns.\n\nOctober 29, 1898\n\nThe possibility of a retrial is finally granted.\n\nOctober 31, 1898\n\nNew Cabinet with Charles Dupuy as Prime Minister. Freycinet is Minister of War.\n\nNovember 4, 1898\n\nFrench troops led by Colonel Marchand evacuate Fashoda.\n\nNovember-December 1898\n\nJoseph Reinach starts a series of articles in Le Siècle (later published as Le Crépuscule des traîtres) in which he accuses Henry of connivance with Esterhazy.\n\nNovember 18, 1898\n\nPicquart's Court-martial begins.\n\nDecember 14, 1898\n\nLa Libre Parole starts a subscription to help Henry's widow in a suit against Reinach.\n\nDecember 31, 1898\n\nThe Ligue de la Patrie française (Nationalist and anti-Dreyfusard) is founded.\n\nJanuary 21, 1899\n\nFollowing another distraint order and public auction against Zola' estate, publisher Fasquelle buys a mirror and a table for 2500 Francs.\n\nJanuary 27, 1899\n\nReinach's libel trial at Mme Henry's request.\n\nJanuary 28, 1899\n\nProposal in the Chamber of Deputies to have the Dreyfus Case heard by a Supreme Court of Appeals, with all three Chambers sitting jointly (loi de désaisissement).\n\nFebruary 10, 1899\n\nThe proposal, modifying the normal jurisdictional process, is voted as Law.\n\nThe Court of Appeals rejects the demands by the Military to stop the process for retrial.\n\nFebruary 16, 1899\n\nPresident Félix Faure dies suddenly in his office.\n\nFebruary 18, 1899\n\nEmile Loubet, a supporter of the Dreyfus' cause, succeeds Felix Faure as President of the Republic.\n\nNationalist demonstrations in Paris.\n\nFebruary 23, 1898\n\nDuring Faure's state funeral, writer Paul Déroulède, Jules Guérin and the Ligue des Patriotes attempt a coup. They are arrested.\n\nMarch 1, 1898\n\nThe Senate follows suit on the institution of a Supreme Court of Appeals, with all three Chambers sitting jointly.\n\nMarch 21, 1899\n\nFirst plenary session of the Supreme Court of Appeals, with all three Chambers sitting jointly, Charles Mazeau presiding.\n\nThe sessions will end April 23. Cuignet and du Paty de Clam have been summoned.\n\nJune 1, 1899\n\nDu Paty de Clam is arrested.\n\nJune 3, 1899\n\nThe Court of Appeals overturns the verdict of 1894.

He formally apologizes to the Dreyfus and Zola families, expressing France’s gratitude for their courage confronting hate, injustice and intolerance:\n\n\"Just a century ago, France was experiencing a grave and deep crisis. The Dreyfus Affair was tearing French society apart, dividing families, dividing the country into two opposing camps violently confronting each other. Because Captain Dreyfus had to remain guilty as charged at all cost, his subsequent trials became nothing but a pathetic farce. After having been stripped of his rank and having seen his military sword broken, he was going to suffer, on Devil’s Island, for the conspiracy deliberately plotted against him in the secrecy of some office.\"\n\n\"In spite of the unyielding efforts by Captain Dreyfus’ family, his case could have been filed away forever. A dark stain, unworthy of our country and our history, a colossal judicial error and a shameful state compromise! But a man stood up against lies, malice and cowardice. Outraged by the injustice against Captain Dreyfus, whose only crime was to be a Jew, Emile Zola cried out his famous “I Accuse...!”. Published on January 13, 1898 by L’Aurore, this text struck minds like lightning and changed the fate of the Affair within a few hours. Truth was on the march.\"\n\n\"That day, Emile Zola, was appealing to the President of the French Republic. Today we are celebrating the centennial of this letter which has entered History. Today, I would like to tell the Dreyfus and Zola families how much France is grateful to their ancestors to have been able to give all its meaning to the values of liberty, dignity and justice.\"\n\n\"Let us not ever forget that the man who was rehabilitated to shouts of “Long live Dreyfus!” answered with a strong voice: “No! Long live France!”. In spite of his humiliation, his exile, his sufferings, wounded in his heart and in his flesh, harmed in his dignity, Captain Dreyfus was able to forgive. Magnificent forgiveness, magnificent answer: love of country against intolerance and hate.\"\n\n\"Let us not ever forget the courage of that great writer who, taking every risk, jeopardizing his peace and quiet, his fame and even his own life, dared to take up his pen and put his talent to the service of truth. Emile Zola, high literary and moral character, had understood that his responsibility was to enlighten and his duty was to speak up when others kept silent. Like Voltaire before him, he has become since then the incarnation of the best of the intellectual tradition.\"\n\n\"Captain Dreyfus’ tragedy took place a century ago. However, after so many years, it still resonates strongly in our hearts. Zola’s text has remained in our collective memory as “a great moment in the conscience of humanity”\n\n\"Half a century after the Vichy regime, we know that dark forces, intolerance, injustice can insinuate themselves up to the highest levels of the State. But we also know that France, in moments of truth, can find again the best of herself: great, strong, united and vigilant This is without a doubt what Emile Zola and Alfred Dreyfus are telling us, after all these years. It is because they had faith in our common values, those of our Nation and our Republic, and because they so deeply loved France, that these exceptional men were able to reconcile her with herself.\"\n\n\"Let us not ever forget this masterful lesson of love and unity.\"\n\nJacques Chirac\n\nPresident of the French Republic\n\nJanuary 13th 1998\n\n(Translation: Jean-Max Guieu, Georgetown University)\n\nDecember 1999\n\nThe City of Paris decides to name after Alfred Dreyfus a square in the 15th Arrondissement at the corner of the Avenue Emile-Zola."
