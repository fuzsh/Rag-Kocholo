        "text": "Jean Casimir-Périer (born Nov. 8, 1847, Paris, France—died March 11, 1907, Paris) was a French politician and wealthy businessman who served brief and undistinguished terms as a premier and as the fifth president of the Third Republic.\n\nThe son of a former minister of the interior, he served as a captain during the Franco-German War (1870–71). In 1876 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies as a Left Republican from Aube département, serving as the chamber’s vice president (1890–92) and president (1893). On Dec. 4, 1893, he formed his own cabinet, which fell within six months because of his inability to cope with anarchist terrorism and the vexing church-state issue."
