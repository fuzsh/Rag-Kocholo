        "text": "“ Alejandro Sosa: So, how's this going to work, Tony? How do we solve our problem?\n\nTony Montana: You're going to die, Alex, for everything you've done in your entire life.\n\nAlejandro Sosa: What about what you did? I told you not to fuck me, and you did, Tony.\n\nTony Montana: There were kids in the fucking car, Alex! Innocent kids! Huh, what kind of animals you got working for you?\n\nAlejandro Sosa: I want to clear something up with you, Tony, before I kill you. When you move 400 kilos a month, it's imperative that you do kill children. That way, heroes don't get confused and go on \"60 Minutes\". They instead crawl back into the hole they came from.\n\nTony Montana: Hey, Sosa, it's time for you to make that crawl, huh? „ ~ Alejandro Sosa's last words before getting killed by Tony Montana.\n\nAlejandro Sosa is the main antagonist of the 2006 video game Scarface: The World Is Yours, a pseudo-sequel to the 1983 epic crime drama film Scarface, which is in on itself a loose remake of the 1932 film of same name, based on the 1929 novel, also of same name.\n\nLike his film counterpart, Alejandro Sosa is a powerful Bolivian drug lord and Tony Montana's former friend up until the latter betrays him. However, whereas Tony is killed by his men in the film, the video game shows what would have happened if Tony had avoided being killed, leading him to escape and plan his revenge against Sosa.\n\nHe was voiced by Robert Davi.\n\nHis Evil Ranking[]\n\nHis Villainous Deeds[]\n\nDue to the video game's nature as a pseudo-sequel to the film picking up from the events towards the film's ending, this version of Alejandro Sosa likely committed the same crimes his film version did, including:\n\nOrdering The Skull to hang Omar Suarez up from a helicopter for being a \"police informant\" (though this is never stated to be true or not), although Omar likely deserved it for supposedly setting Tony Montana up earlier in the film, leading to his friend Angel's death.\n\nSending Tony and his friends alongside his henchman Alberto the Shadow to blow up the car from a journalist who can expose his crimes at the United Nations building, though it turns out that the journalist is bringing his wife and kids with him, leading Tony to shoot Alberto when he refuses to back out.\n\nFurthermore, Alberto's tone of voice, when he says that if Sosa ordered them to carry out the task they must do it, may imply that Sosa harshly punishes his henchmen if they fail him. That said, when Sosa calls Tony later on to reprimand him for betraying him, he is shown to be more furious that they didn't kill the journalist instead of expressing anger at Alberto's death.\n\nSending The Skull and other goons of his to Miami to kill Tony for his betrayal, killing Tony's bodyguards and sister Gina in the process, even though the latter was drunken and didn't pose a genuine threat.\n\nUnlike the film, Tony survives the shootout at his mansion, but his mansion is burned by Sosa's men under his orders.\n\nWith Tony's drug empire gone, he makes an alliance with Gaspar Gomez and they take over Montana's remaining turf, becoming so powerful over Miami that all the drug dealers must report to him and leaves Tony with few allies, even leading Tony's lawyer George Sheffield to betray Tony and join him.\n\nOnce Tony goes to Bolivia to kill him, Sosa discusses with Gomez and Sheffield how to get rid of Tony. While he declines Sheffield's idea of sending the Amerian military and some Bolivian tanks after Montana with his Washington connections, he doesn't accept the idea out of care for the Miami citizens, but rather because of the legal repercussion that would mean for him.\n\nStays seated in his couch at his living room while he allows Sheffield, Gomez and all his goons be killed by Tony on his way to kill Sosa.\n\nTries to kill Tony one last time but not before reprimanding him for not killing the journalist and explaining him that, in their business, sometimes children have to die so they can make profit upon learning why Tony didn't kill the journalist, leading Tony to finally kill him for his lack of standards.\n\nWhy Doesn't He Stand Out?[]\n\nWhile he is a vile crime lord, Sosa ultimately fails the heinous standards too much. There are several reasons why he doesn't go beyond standard villainy:\n\nHe is only confirmed to have killed one person, and all of his other victims are implied.\n\nHe fails the heinous standards to Nacho Contreras (who also fails the standard himself), who sexually assaulted, harassed and raped several women offscreen. He even fails to Tony Montana, who killed dozens of people in self-defence.\n\nHe severely holds back on his resources, as he is a powerful and wealthy crime lord with connections to military forces, yet he doesn't kill, torture or traffic people. In fact, even Nacho has less resources than Sosa. He also holds back on his resources due to not wanting to cause any distress, meaning he doesn't use his resources to commit enough villainous deeds.\n\nWhile he knew the journalist was bringing his wife and kids and didn't care if he almost killed them (unlike his movie counterpart who isn't shown to be aware of that), this doesn't push enough boundaries for him to stand out when compared to the other villains in the game. In addition, his claims does not have any onscreen effects, making it Fridge Horror at best.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHe was originally approved as Pure Evil for a long time, but it was agreed to cut him due to his actions being too standard for a crime lord with his resource tier.\n\nSosa's lack of concern about killing children may be an indicator that he has killed children in the past. If this were confirmed, this would make Sosa even worse (in the video game version, at least). But, because it's too offscreen, there's no onscreen evidence that he's indeed killed children at all, making it Fridge Horror altogether.\n\n[]\n\nAlejandro Sosa on the Villains Wiki\n\nNavigation[]"
