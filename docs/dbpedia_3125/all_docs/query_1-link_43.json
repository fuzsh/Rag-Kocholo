The actor he selected, André Sogliuzzo, had previously worked as Pacino's chauffer for a considerable period of time, though neither the developers nor Pacino knew that when he was selected. Having spent so much time with Pacino, André was familiar with his mannerisms and personality, and was able to imitate him much better than any of the other actors who auditioned for the role."
