        "text": "Ever hear the phrase: “Nothing Exceeds Like Excess”? We’re not sure exactly what it means… But we do know where the quote came from. It’s from a 1983 film which epitomizes stylistic “excess” in Hollywood. One that people either passionately love or absolutely hate. And which features the combined efforts of three of the most talented personalities in movies: Actor Al Pacino, writer Oliver Stone, and director Brian De Palma.\n\nThe film we’re talking about is Scarface. And together, with The Godfather and Goodfellas, it helps form one of the legs which support the tripod of the modern gangster film. Even if their styles and themes couldn’t be more different.\n\nAs such, the excesses of “Scarface” have secured its place not only in the pantheon of all-time great gangster films, but as part of the larger tableaux of popular culture. Many people are well familiar with many of the lines from the film, even if they’ve never actually seen it.\n\nBut believe it or not, the story behind the movie didn’t start in the early 1980s. For that, we have to go back some 50 years earlier…to the very dawn of sound in Hollywood. That’s when famous multi-millionaire Howard Hughes set out to make a realistic gangster film that would pull no punches while depicting the violence associated with prohibition. He bought the rights to a book named “Scarface” which was written in 1929 by a young scribe named Armitage Trail.\n\n(Trail, whose real name was Maurice Coons, was morbidly obese. And would eventually die of a heart attack at the age of 28 shortly before the eventual film’s release. If he had lived, he probably would have become a very rich man).\n\nHughes brought on one of Hollywood’s all time famous scriptwriters, Ben Hecht, to work on the film. And hired another up-and-comer named Howard Hawks to direct. The script had already run into trouble when it was shown to the censors, but Hughes told Hawks to ignore their protests and to shoot the film as it was set down on paper. He also told his director to “make it as grisly [and] realistic as possible.”\n\nHawks was only too happy to comply. He also filled the 1932 movie with his own unique touches. This including finding interesting ways to insert a cross or “X” into every scene whenever someone is murdered. On the set, Hawks offered monetary awards to crew members who could think of inventive ways to add this visual metaphor. And as a result, there are literally dozens of “X”s scattered throughout the film. They keep up step by step with the film’s generous body count. Just to show you how far Hawks wanted take this foray into symbolism, look no further than the scene in which a rival gangster is machine gunned to death in his hospital bed. Hawks wanted “the victim” to contort his body into mock “cross” after being rubbed out. But the extra couldn’t do it to the director’s satisfaction. So Hawks did the cameo himself. (You might even call it a personal “X” cess).\n\nBack in the early 1930s, there wasn’t yet a production (much less a ratings) code for Hollywood films. Most movies were submitted to individual censorship boards operated by the states or other localities. When “Scarface” was finished and screened for them, many rejected it outright. In addition to the violence, many censors objected to the way it supposedly glorified the gangster’s lifestyle. Hecht’s sly insertion of other racy subject matter (such as Tony’s less than pure motives toward his own sister) didn’t go unnoticed either.\n\nSo, to appease the censors, Hughes cut down several objectionable scenes, gave film a new subtitle (“Shame of a Nation”), and added a disclaimer. But even then, many of the review boards still refused to budge. Rather than admit defeat, Hughes decided to just ignore them. He went back to his original version and in 1932 released the film in its entirety to those areas of the country which lacked strict censorship laws.\n\nThis turn of events is worth keeping in mind, because as we shall see, history has a way of repeating itself…even in Hollywood.\n\n”Scarface” was an immediate sensation, and quickly became one of biggest hits of the early 1930s. Word of mouth practically forced its showing in many areas of the country which had previously banned it. But the film’s notoriety was also a contributing factor to the production code which was instituted two years later. The new guidelines prohibited much of the content that “Scarface” reveled in. As a result, the film was rarely seen for decades after its original run.\n\nFast forward to the early 1980s. One night, producer Martin Bregman (Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon) was up late watching television. Seems he was dealing with a bout of insomnia…a very common affliction in the movie industry. On TV, Bregman caught an airing of the 1932 version of “Scarface” and it suddenly dawned on him that no one had recently made an “over-the-top” gangster film which didn’t cut corners when it came to depicting on-screen violence. To his way of thinking, excess could turn out to be a good thing.\n\nSo, Bregman called up two individuals he had collaborated with on his previous films to gauge their interest. One was Al Pacino, who was immediately attracted to the idea of playing the title character. The second was director Sidney Lumet. When Bregman pitched the concept to Lumet, he confessed that the biggest obstacle they needed to overcome was finding the right hook to bring the themes up to date with the present day. Lumet responded by suggesting they jettison the whole idea of gangsters trafficking in bootleg whiskey and guns. Instead, he suggested, the story should concentrate on the cocaine trade, and could feature a Cuban tough-guy. Everyone liked that idea.\n\nBut the next step was developing a script centered around that concept. Which left them with one hitch. Where were they going to find a screenwriter who was already familiar with the drug culture, and who could write from personal experience? Hmmm….\n\nEnter Oliver Stone. At the time, the fledgling director had just come off his first feature. It was called The Hand. It told the heartwarming tale of a man who loses the title appendage in an accident, only to see it take on a life of its own and go on a killing spree. Needless to say, the film didn’t break any box office records. Its complete failure had left Stone broke, dejected, and with a nasty cocaine habit.\n\n(By the way, if you’re ever desperate for entertainment on a Saturday night and are intrigued by movies featuring killer hands on the loose, also check out Mad Love, The Hands of Orlac, The Beast With Five Fingers, The Crawling Hand, and Body Parts. On second thought, if you really are that desperate, you might be better off digging through the DVD bargain bin at Walmart…or even re-watching old episodes of “The Addams Family.”)\n\nStone needed a job, and jumped at the opportunity that Bregman handed him. He first traveled to Miami and Dade County in Florida. There, he met with local police officials. They opened up their case files and showed Stone the most grisly pictures imaginable of what happens when rival gangs battle for control of the drug trade. From there, Stone exploited some of his own connections to fly down to Ecuador and Bolivia and meet with actual drug lords. Being up front with the topic he was trying to research, they were glad to (anonymously) describe their operations, and talk about what it was like to run a drug empire. When he wasn’t busy sampling the local wares, Stone took copious notes in anticipation of his script writing assignment.\n\nAfter flying back to the Los Angeles to write the movie, Stone realized he had a problem. Everyone he knew in LA at the time was doing drugs. Big time. And there was just too much temptation to remain high. Knowing that wasn’t the best strategy for writing a screenplay, he fled to Paris to buckle down and stay away from the white stuff. And while there, the script for the movie began to take shape.\n\nOne of his earliest decisions was to name the main character Tony Montana. Why? Because Stone was a huge fan of the San Francisco 49ers. As well as their star quarterback: Joe Montana. From there, he peppered the screenplay with ideas lifted both from the original film, as well as some of the case histories he read about from actual police files in South Florida. The final draft was laced with graphic violence, nudity, and what one might euphemistically call “colorful language.”\n\nWhen Stone delivered his screenplay to Bregman, he and Pacino liked what they saw. But Sidney Lumet was totally aghast. He wanted a movie that was thoughtful and political in nature…not one filled with such unbelievable excess. And after both Bregman and Pacino voiced their approval for the approach that Stone had taken, Lumet excused himself from the project.\n\nThat left the team in need of another director, and after a quick job search, they thought they had found a suitable candidate after talking with Brian De Palma. Famous for his homages to Alfred Hitchcock, De Palma already had a strong reputation in Hollywood as a unique visual stylist (Sisters, Obsession, Carrie, Dressed to Kill). Long takes, high angles and a moving camera were De Palma’s forte. He told Bregman and Pacino that he wanted to make “Scarface” an “operatic” vision of the American dream gone wild. Something not only larger than life, but with a “heightened sense of reality.”\n\nBregman and Pacino quickly realized that in De Palma, they had found the perfect partner. One that was going to be able to bring the kind of movie they always had in mind to life. Universal Studios agreed to finance the picture.\n\nThe rest of the production began to come together. For Tony Montana’s mistress, Michelle Pfeiffer indicated an interest in the role. At the time, she was just starting out in her career, and in order to gauge her level of commitment, Bregman pulled an old Hollywood trick. He told Pfeiffer she was more than welcome to read for the role, but had to pay her own airfare from New York to L.A. When she agreed, Bregman knew how badly she wanted the part. Bregman always had every intention of paying her way. He just wanted to make sure she wasn’t just another “prima donna.” Other cast members also came on board. They included Steven Bauer (Manny, Tony’s best friend), Robert Loggia (Frank, Tony’s boss), Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Tony’s sister Gina), Paul Shenar (the drug lord Sosa) and F. Murray Abraham (Omar, one of Frank’s lieutenants). Before a frame of footage was even shot, De Palma thoroughly rehearsed with all of the actors for over a month.\n\nOn the technical side, John Alonzo, the Director of Photography, approached De Palma and asked what kind of look he wanted for the film. De Palma responded: “Give me the most beautiful pictures you can. I’m going to place violence inside of them.” Alonzo thought this was an unusual approach for a film, but he had help from a dedicated visual stylist named Ferdinando Scarfiotti. Between the two of them, they were able to create a gorgeous series of set designs which just pop off the screen. Tony’s mansion, the Babylon club, the various other locations…all feature a neon, acrylic, vibrant look that is completely at odds with the dark, muted “film noir” style of previous gangster films.\n\nIn fact, “Scarface” remains a great example of superior production design – one of the things that sets Hollywood apart from the rest of the world. The murderers depicted in the film aren’t the somber, introspective type. They love to party and have a good time. While eagerly embracing a lifestyle of conspicuous consumption. And their excessive and extravagant tastes are amply reflected by what you see on screen.\n\nBut not everything associated with the shoot went smoothly. The original intention was to film “Scarface” on location in and around Miami. But the local Cuban community got wind of the subject matter portrayed in the film, and literally ran the production out of town. In between all the protests, there were acts of vandalism and physical threats made against various members of the crew. So, De Palma and his team were forced to pack up and move back to Los Angeles. After things calmed down, they flew to Florida for two weeks to get some crucial location shots, including the exteriors featuring the Art Deco buildings along Miami’s beachfront. But the vast majority of the film was shot in Southern California.\n\nThere were even more problems during the shooting of the film’s famous climax when Tony engages in a fierce gun battle with the South American hit squad sent to rub him out. In order to get the flash of the muzzle from Tony’s M16 machine gun to appear on camera, it was synchronized with the film camera’s shutter speed. This meant that it would only work at certain intervals. This caused no end of frustration for Pacino, who felt hamstrung by the prop when it didn’t always fire when he wanted it to.\n\nAt one point, he badly burned his hand against the casing. His injury which took over a week to heal. While Pacino was away from the set recuperating, De Palma focused on the other shots needed for the firefight. But as word got around about the elaborate fire-fight being staged, even Steven Spielberg stopped by the set to watch all the fun. Later, they spent two entire days filming the final shot where Tony is blown away with a shotgun and falls into the fountain pool – creating a literal “bloodbath.”\n\nIn comparing Oliver Stone’s script for “Scarface” with the 1932 version, it’s amazing how many parts of the original plot structure have been left intact. In addition to Tony’s inappropriate feelings for his sister, there’s “The World is Yours” sign. In 1932, it was part of an advertisement for a travel company, in 1983, it’s on the Goodyear Blimp. Many of the lines from the 1932 film are repeated verbatim in the remake. And probably most obviously, there’s the reworking of the key scene in which Tony confronts his boss, Frank, and the damning phone call which clinches the latter’s fate.\n\nIn both films, after being ambushed by potential assassins, Tony isn’t sure who ordered the hit. So, he asks a subordinate to call Frank at a pre-appointed time and say (edited version): “we messed up, he got away.” When Frank answers the phone and after hearing the message pretends it’s his mistress on the other end of the line, Tony instantly knows his rival is the guilty party. After taunting Frank, Tony has Manny, his second in command, execute his former boss at point blank range.\n\nTony next demonstrates his willingness to dirty his own hands by killing Bernstein, the corrupt policeman who had served as Frank’s lapdog. Right before blowing away Bernstein, Tony tells him “while you’re at it, why don’t you buy yourself two first class tickets to the resurrection…” It echoes an earlier conversation in which Bernstein had demanded airplane tickets while shaking down Tony for money…and is another memorable line from a movie full of them. The fact that Tony pulls out the reference at this critical juncture illustrates his intelligence and understanding of the “big picture.” As well as what it means to bring things full circle.\n\nBut the real insight into Tony’s character comes just a few seconds later. As his crew prepares to leave the scene of the executions, Manny asks Tony what they should do with the lone survivor: Ernie, who served as one of Frank’s bodyguards. The camera slowly zooms into a close up of both Tony and Ernie while ominous music plays in the background. De Palma intercuts the shots between the two men, and you can see the palpable fear on Ernie’s face. But suddenly, the tension is broken when the music suddenly stops and Tony simply asks: “Ernie, you want a job?” Ernie looks around nervously, and replies in the affirmative. Tony responds: “Then you call me in the morning…”\n\nThis simple interchange helps illustrate why the film “Scarface” is so popular. Tony may be a ambitious, murderous thug, but he also possesses a tremendous amount of integrity. As he himself says, “I never done nothing to nobody that didn’t have it coming.” Tony understands principles of fairness, and realizes that Ernie isn’t the enemy. He’s just a foot soldier, following orders. And as such, there’s no need to kill him.\n\nAnother facet of Tony’s character is his honesty. In the restaurant scene during which he gets intoxicated, Tony is only too happy to tell his captive audience that he may be a bad guy, but he “always tells the truth…even when I lie.” Sosa, the drug kingpin agrees. When he first meets the aspiring gangster, he tells him: “I like you Tony. There’s no lying in you.” Ironically, it’s only after his excessive lifestyle and overuse of drugs have taken their toll on Tony’s judgment that you begin to see him abandoning the principles which have taken him to the top of the criminal underworld.\n\nIn many ways, Tony is a classic anti-hero. Despite his criminality, you can’t help but like him. He displays a flair and bravado that has made him one of cinema’s most iconic characters. Throw in a sense of humor, and you have the stuff of which Hollywood legends are made.\n\nAl Pacino has stated that Tony Montana remains one of his all time favorite roles in a career full of them. And in the rest of film industry, it seems like everyone has their own interpretation of Tony Montana. (Bruce Willis is said to do one humdinger of an impersonation).\n\nBrian De Palma once said that one of the legacies of directing “Scarface” is that every time he auditions a male actor for a part in a movie, they always want to show him their version of Tony Montana. (“Say hello to my little friend!!”) For his part, Oliver Stone says he knew he had arrived as a successful Hollywood screenwriter when he would ride the subway in New York and nearly every day hear passengers quoting lines from “Scarface”. (“I’m Tony Montana. You F…with me, you’re F…ing with the best!!“)\n\nBut before the movie was released, there was still one huge hurdle to overcome…the Motion Pictures Association (MPAA) ratings board. Bregman, Pacino, De Palma and Stone knew their movie was going to be controversial, but they never realized just how tough the battle was going to be.\n\nIn order to qualify for commercial or television advertising, movies needed to obtain an “R” rating. But when they submitted “Scarface” for review, it immediately received an “X.” So, De Palma cut the movie down and re-submitted it. Once again, the result was another “X.” Then, the film underwent a third surgical procedure. With the same result…a third “X.” (Perhaps the ghost of Howard Hawks was on the panel).\n\nAt this point, De Palma threw up his hands. Despite intense pressure from the studio, he categorically refused to cut the film down any further, stating that to do so would destroy the movie’s integrity. Bregman asked the ratings board to provide a description of scenes they found most objectionable. To De Palma’s dismay, the list they got back was both all-encompassing and unbelievably nit-picky. For a film containing multiple executions (including an infamous sequence involving a chainsaw) the board focused on mundane things like counting how many times a clown was hit by bullets during a gunfight at a nightclub. It was almost as if the ratings board was fixated on the most inconsequential shots and wasn’t going to approve ANY part of the movie, no matter what the filmmakers did.\n\nIt was at this point that Bregman and De Palma realized they were being jerked around. To put pressure on the ratings board, De Palma contacted several of his friends who were journalists. They began running stories in the local Hollywood trade papers highlighting what was going on. Which at the time, touched off a huge debate in the community about the power of the ratings board, the feasibility of the ratings system, and the nature of censorship. With all the expected tangents dealing with art, commerce, and issues of morality. In many respects, it was a replay of the same discussions which had taken place back in 1932.\n\nStill, the ratings board refused to budge. Some claimed that Jack Valenti, the head of the MPAA, was putting personal pressure on the board not to cave. (Note: Even though it’s supposed to be impartial, the ratings board is not an independent organization. It’s owned and run by the studios). Apparently Valenti liked the anti-drug message the film sent and wanted his young daughter to see a cleaned up version of the movie. After having reached an impasse, both sides finally agreed to submit the film for arbitration. A 20 member board was going to hear both sides of the argument, and decide what rating the film would get.\n\nBregman prepared for the arbitration hearing like it was an actual trial. He lined up a series of witnesses. They included homicide detectives and the head of Miami’s organized crime bureau. They testified there was nothing in the film which couldn’t directly be related to real life drug wars. He also brought in a series of psychiatrists and main stream news reporters. They all made the case that the content in “Scarface” was real, and that in order for people to understand the consequences of the drug culture, they needed to see all the violent excesses that went with it. Not some watered down Hollywood version with a contrived happy ending.\n\nAs a result of Bregman’s preparations, they won the arbitration hearing hands down. The final vote was 18 to 2. “Scarface” was going to be released with an “R” rating.\n\nBut when it came time to hand over the print, De Palma suddenly had an epiphany. At this point, there were three versions of the film. All branded with an “X” rating. If the first version got the same rating as the third, De Palma reasoned, there was nothing stopping him from submitting his original cut for release. After all, according to the ratings board’s verdict, they were all identical. When De Palma told the studio what he intended to do, Universal told him “You can’t do that!” But just like Howard Hughes 50 years earlier, De Palma basically replied “watch me.” He released his original cut. And no one stopped him.\n\nFittingly, the final film is dedicated at the start of the end credits to Howard Hawks and Ben Hecht – the creative team responsible for the original 1932 film. Ironic, isn’t it? Given the similarities between the censorship battles fought over each version of “Scarface” – and how each film eventually found its respective audience.\n\nFor years, people have asked about the “Director’s” or “Unrated” cut of “Scarface.” After all the publicity about the arbitration hearing, it was assumed that the version which was released to theaters was edited down. But the fact is, what audiences first saw in 1983 (as well as all the subsequent DVD releases) IS the definitive version of the movie. If you’ve seen the film on cable or home video, you haven’t missed a thing. (There are some other deleted scenes floating around, but they were never intended for inclusion in the final version).\n\nWhen “Scarface” was released in 1983, it did respectable business at the box office, and more than met Universal’s financial goals. But to say it didn’t meet with initial critical success would be an understatement. Bregman remembers there was only one mainstream film critic who liked the film when it first came out (Vincent Canby of the New York Times). Everyone else panned it, mostly because of all the violent and profanity in the picture. Actor Steven Bauer remembers attending the New York premier of the film and sitting behind director Martin Scorsese. Midway through the film, Mr. Scorsese turned around and said: “You guys are great, but be prepared, because they’re going to hate it in Hollywood. Because it’s about them...”\n\nStill, despite the film’s initial lukewarm reception, the reputation of “Scarface” has only grown over the years. It’s now recognized as a bona fide cult classic, and has become a staple reference in the hip hop and rap community. 35 years after its release, the film’s iconic poster is still in production and continues to sell well. The American Film Institute lists it among the Top Ten American gangster films, as did Entertainment Weekly in their list of top cult films. There are several popular video games based on the characters from the movie. And if you look on YouTube, you can also watch a re-enactment of scenes from the movie done as part of an elementary school play. (Yes, we know it’s inappropriate…but oh, so funny…)\n\nAnd even many of the critics have come around. We think perhaps the best summary of the film comes from Newsweek’s David Ansen, who wrote:\n\n“If Scarface makes you shudder, it’s from what you think you see and from the accumulated tension of this feral landscape. It’s a grand, shallow, decadent entertainment, which like all great Hollywood gangster movies, delivers the punch and counterpunch of glamour and disgust.”\n\nA good quote to keep in mind while we indulge our own passion for “”Scarface” by watching it for the 20th time.\n\nPOSTSCRIPT:\n\nAbove, we mentioned that if you’ve watched “Scarface” on cable or DVD, you’ve already seen the original, definitive version. But in the interest of full disclosure, you should know that there IS another cut of the movie you may have run across as well.\n\nAfter the movie was released to the home video market, producer Martin Bregman was approached by Universal Studios. They wanted to create a version of “Scarface” which would be suitable for airing on network television.\n\nWhen Bregman heard about the intention to sanitize the film for a mass audience, he told the studio execs that they were crazy. He pointed out, even if they could get around all the violence and the nudity, nearly every piece of dialogue was full of profanity. The film includes the “F” word 226 times alone. (Yes, believe it or not, someone counted them all up…).\n\n“We can do it. We can do it,” was their reply. And the studio’s team of editors set to work removing over a half hour of the film, and re-worked large segments of the dialogue.\n\nIf you’ve seen the “network” version of “Scarface,” it’s a laugh riot. To see what we mean, take a look at these following pieces of dialogue from the re-dubbed film, and try to figure out their original context. (That is, if you can keep from laughing):\n\n“How did you get that beauty scar, tough guy? Eating pineapple?”\n\n“Why don’t you try sticking your head up your toilet.”\n\n“This town is like a great big chicken waiting to be plucked.”\n\n“You have a look in your eye like you haven’t been touched in a year.”\n\n“Hey Jose…who, what, where, when, and how I make it is none of your business.”\n\n“I’m going to wipe you all over this filthy place.”\n\n“You think I’d kill two kids and a woman? Not that…I don’t need that stuff in my life…You’re dead butcher!”\n\nWhen Bregman saw the final product on network TV, he was positively shocked. But had to admit that in some strange, weird way, the studio had actually pulled it off.\n\nAll joking aside, the excesses of “Scarface” have secured its place not only in the pantheon of all-time great gangster films, but in film history as well. Not to mention its effect on the even larger tableaux of popular culture. Many people are already familiar with some of the lines quoted from the script, even if they’ve never seen the film."
