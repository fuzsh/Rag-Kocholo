        "text": "PS2 | Submitted by Ninja_Assault 25\n\nGood Start-off\n\nOne of the best Start-offs in the game is this:\n\nFirst-off, when you buy the mansion back form Vice, go around to the back to the underground bunker and at the first stair-case at the entrance will be a fully-loaded Carbine.(Note: Don't turn the system off or restart or you lose this cheat!)\n\nAfter you beat the Penthouse mission at the start, buy the driver, Renovate the mansion, and buy the Bandit the second you get out of the bank!\n\nThen go to the mansion and level up to unlock the shotguns and chainsaws. Eliminate all the gangs in Little Havana before you buy any fronts! I know it takes a long but it's WAY less risky after to do distribute drugs! You will almost never get attacked and it works well when you own more than one area of Miami. While getting them BALLZ accumulated get after them femme fatales. They're worth the health, stamina, and balls upgrades, plus who doesn't want sexy woman around the house?!\n\nAfter the gangs, use the money to buy enough exotics to level up again and get some Aks and buy the Corvette-like car, then get some money from deals and buy the Fronts. Now you're ready to Take the Diaz Bros and get Downtown. Take all the gangs like before! Once you unlock the Islands, get to level six to unlock the best Drug deals. Get all the weapons and weapon upgrades to become a true badass! Now take on Nacho Contrerez and win Downtown fully!\n\nNow that you're in Gaspars turf, Get that fully-upgraded carbine or the machine gun! They are TOUGH in this turf and the front misions are hard as hell! Take the gangs in Both turfs like before nad get to level seven! (Don't get to level 8 until you buy the Montana Financial because the only thing level 8 does is make your laundering taxes higher, but you need it to be allowed to Take Gaspar and Sosa). Make sure have all the femmes to be able to take the most damage and deal it the best. you now go after Sosa, and prove you are the baddest Cubano to live!"
