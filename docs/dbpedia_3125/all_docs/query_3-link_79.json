        "text": "Imprint # 37\n\nDistributor: Via Vision Entertainment (Imprint)\n\nRelease Date: May 05, 2021\n\nRegion: Region Free\n\nLength: 01:29:42\n\nVideo: 1080P (MPEG-4, AVC)\n\nMain Audio: 2.0 English Linear PCM Audio (48 kHz, 2304 kbps, 24-bit)\n\nSubtitles: English\n\nRatio: 1.33:1\n\nBitrate: 33.06 Mbps\n\n“Scarface is my favorite picture, even today, because we were completely alone, Hughes and I. Everybody was under contract to the studios. We couldn’t get a studio, and they wouldn’t loan us anybody, so we had to find a cast. They just didn’t want independent pictures made in Hollywood. So we rented a little cobwebbed studio and opened it up and made the picture. It turned out to be the big picture of the year. We didn’t get any help from anybody, and that’s why I think I liked it best.” —Howard Hawks (‘Scarface’ and Howard Hughes, Hawks on Hawks, 1982)\n\nHoward Hawks is one of the most celebrated filmmakers of his era, and Scarface is the film that established him as an important director, but the film was actually produced by Howard Hughes and owes a significant debt to the writing talents of Ben Hecht. Interestingly, both Hawks and Hughes were prone to self-aggrandizing exaggerations and other forms of revisionist retrospective tales about their work. The result is a somewhat cluttered history of the production, and individual memories about the writing of the film’s script were particularly contradictory. Note how severely Hughes underplays the contributions of his writers:\n\n“I wasn’t yet twenty-five years old and still a bit of a smart-aleck. I know now that you get a good writer, turn him loose on a project, and let him do it. But at that time, I took over Irving Thalberg’s idea, which was to put a number of writers to work on a story without letting any of them know that the others are working on it. I had Ben Hecht and W.R. Burnett and three or four other top-flight writers working on it, and none of them knew the others were involved… and when they had all finished a version of the script, I took all four or five versions of it, picked out the best parts, strung them together myself and wrote in my own interim connecting scenes.” —Howard Hughes (The Autobiography of Howard Hughes, 1972)\n\nHawks was always more considerate when it came to praising Hecht’s writing contributions, but he tended to spin his recollections to his own favor:\n\n“I wanted Ben Hecht to write on it, and he said, ‘Sure, what are you going to make?’ I said, ‘A gangster picture.’ He said, ‘Hell, you don’t want to make one of those things.’ I said, ‘Well, Ben, I’ve got an idea that the Borgia family is living in Chicago today. See, our Borgia is Al Capone, and his sister does the same incest thing as Lucretia Borgia.’ And he said, ‘Well, let’s start tomorrow morning.’… There was a young reporter, John Lee Mahin, who worked on it, and he had some good ideas. We knew just what we wanted. The original story [a novel by Armitage Trail] had two brothers in it. [One was a cop, and one was a gangster.] The script didn’t have the brother.” —Howard Hawks (‘Scarface’ and Howard Hughes, Hawks on Hawks, 1982)\n\nNumerous parties have questioned the validity of claims that it was Hawks who came up with the idea of the incestuous Borgia-like relationship between Tony and Cesca as most remember this being Hecht’s creation. In fact, years before the numerous retrospective interviews given by Hawks in the 1970s, Hawks had credited Hecht with this particular aspect of the film’s story:\n\n“Ben Hecht wanted to make the Capone-like character a Caesar Borgia and Capone’s sister like Lucretia Borgia. This analogy permeates that script, and every intelligent person sense something unusual — something that can’t be brought out into the open — but [it] affects all the scenes.” —Howard Hawks (The Genius of Howard Hawks, Cahiers du Cinéma, February 1956)\n\nHowever, even this mid-career interview takes a fairly daring dive into revisionist history:\n\n“I like to work on the scenarios. Some of my best movies were written in very little time. Scarface took only eleven days, story and scenario… I know because I paid the writers who worked for me by the day… The facts came from several reporters in Chicago — many books, and magazine articles. The outline was done by Ben Hecht. He didn’t have to do any research. All he had to do was ask me about this or that detail, and I would rattle off the information because I had read a lot on the subject. For example, I don’t know if you recall George Raft flipping a ‘nickel’ in his hand? There [has] actually been a large number of murders in Chicago, where, as a mark of disrespect, the killer stuck a nickel into the hand of the corpse. Raft’s character being that of a killer, he always had a coin in his hand. We also exploited another little known fact: The papers that published the photos of a murder indicated ‘X marks the spot where the body was found.’ So we designed fifteen or twenty scenes around the X, finding all sorts of ways to use the X when a murder occurred… Once you start off on that path, why not go all the way? Do you remember the scene in which Boris Karloff is bowling? As he lets the ball go, he’s hit; the pins all go down. An X for a strike is marked on the scorecard.” —Howard Hawks (The Genius of Howard Hawks, Cahiers du Cinéma, February 1956)\n\nOne will notice that Hawks even claims to have paid Hecht’s salary in this particular interview! This flies in the face of everything we know about the film’s production, and Ben Hecht’s own recollections clearly contradict this rather audacious fabrication:\n\n“I didn’t trust Mr. Hughes as an employer. I would work for him only if he paid me a thousand dollars every day at six o’clock. In that way I stood to waste only a day’s labor if Mr. Hughes turned out to be insolvent. Myron was pleased by my attitude and put the deal over with dispatch.” —Ben Hecht (A Child of the Century, 1954)\n\nAt least the director gave the writer credit for one of the film’s most memorable lines of dialogue (even if he does spin it so that the celebrated moment is the result of his own idea):\n\n“I get awfully sick and tired of a lot of the gangster stuff that I see where everybody is growling at somebody and being the toughest guy in the world. These fellows were not that way. They were just like kids. We had fun doing it. When we conceived the idea that these fellows were childish, it helped us do some scenes. For instance, Ben Hecht wrote Muni a scene when I told him I thought we ought to make a good scene out of when Capone discovered a machine gun. Ben said, ‘What do you mean?’ I said, ‘Well, can’t you write a scene like a kid finding a new toy?’ ‘Oh, yeah.’ And he wrote a marvelous line — Muni came in with a machine gun and Johnny Lovo said, ‘You murdering ape, you’re going to take orders.’ Muni said, ‘This is the only thing that gives orders, Johnny. Get out of my way, I’m gonna spit.’ The fellow jumped to one side, and the machine gun went off.” —Howard Hawks (‘Scarface’ and Howard Hughes, Hawks on Hawks, 1982)\n\nApparently, Al Capone wasn’t initially thrilled about a potential film that might dramatize his activities and sent representatives to “discuss” his reservations with Ben Hecht.\n\n“News that it was a biographical study of Al Capone brought two Capone henchmen to Hollywood to make certain that nothing derogatory about the great gangster reached the screen. The two henchmen called on me at my hotel. It was after midnight. They entered the room as ominously as any pair of movie gangsters, their faces set in scowls and guns bulging their coats. They had a copy of my Scarface script in their hands. Their dialogue belonged in it. ‘You the guy who wrote this?’ I said I was. ‘We read it.’ I inquired how they had liked it. ‘We wanna ask you some questions.’ I invited them to go ahead. ‘Is this stuff about Al Capone?’ ‘God, no,’ I said. ‘I don’t even know Al.’ ‘Never met him, huh?’ I pointed out I had left Chicago just as Al was coming into prominence. ‘I knew Jim Colisimo pretty well,’ I said. ‘That so?’ ‘I also knew Mossy Enright and Pete Gentleman.’ ‘That so? Did you know Deanie?’ ‘Deanie O’Banion? Sure. I used to ride around with him in his flivver. I also knew Barney.’ ‘Which Barney?’ ‘Barney Grogan—Eighteenth Ward,’ I said. A pause. ‘O. K., then. We’ll tell Al this stuff you wrote is about them other guys.’ They started out and halted in the doorway, worried again. ‘If this stuff ain’t about Al Capone, why are you callin’ it Scarface? Everybody’ll think it’s him.’ ‘That’s the reason,’ I said. ‘Al is one of the most famous and fascinating men of our time. If we call the movie Scarface, everybody will want to see it, figuring it’s about Al. That’s part of the racket we call showmanship.’ My visitors pondered this, and one of them finally said, ‘I’ll tell Al.’ A pause. ‘Who’s this fella Howard Hughes?’ ‘He’s got nothing to do with anything,’ I said, speaking truthfully at last. ‘He’s the sucker with the money.’ ‘O. K. The hell with him.’ My visitors left.” —Ben Hecht (A Child of the Century, 1954)\n\nThis is a story that was retold throughout the years by both Hawks and Hughes. Hawks usually credited the writer for this particular tale, but it may have also inspired another story wherein Hawks received a visit from Capone’s men:\n\n“While we were making it, five or six of them came out and said, ‘The boss wants us to see the picture.’ And I said, ‘You go and tell him when it comes out, he can pay a dollar and buy a ticket. You don’t scare me. Why the hell don’t you come out and just ask to see it?’ They reported to Capone that it was just great, and they invited me to Chicago to see him. They met me at the train, and they were late. One of the fellows said, ‘There was a killing last night and we had to go to the funeral.’ I said, ‘Do I have to ride with you if there was a killing last night?’ They said I could ride in a different car. But when we went into a cafe, they would sit with their backs to the wall, and I had my back to the door. We had some damn good-looking girls with us, a bit brassy but very pretty. When I saw Capone, we had tea, and he was dressed in a morning coat, striped trousers, a carnation, being a very nice man, saying how much he liked the picture. I was with him two, three hours. Then he asked me to come again, and I stopped by there. But there was a shooting in Chicago, so they said that he couldn’t come because he was hiding out in Atlantic City or something. Then he came to see me when I was working in Hollywood, and the cops came and arrested him right on the set… [Capone saw it] five or six times. He had his own print of it. He thought it was great. He’d say, ‘Jesus Christ, you guys got a lot of stuff in that picture! How’d you know about that?’ I said, ‘Look — you know how somebody can’t testify if he’s a lawyer? Well, I’m a lawyer.’ And he laughed. He didn’t give a damn. Another famous gangster brought two very lovely daughters out to watch the movie and introduced himself to me. He said, ‘Where’d you get that stuff in that killing?’ I asked him, ‘Why? Are you mad?’ He said, ‘No, I’m just curious.’ I told him, and he laughed, and he said, ‘That’s the way we did the shooting. Why hasn’t the picture played in Chicago?’ I said, ‘They won’t let me.’ He said, ‘Do you want it to play?’ I said yeah. And he said, ‘Can I use your phone a minute?’ When he finished he said, ‘You can play it any time you want.’” —Howard Hawks (‘Scarface’ and Howard Hughes, Hawks on Hawks, 1982)\n\nIt’s impossible to know just how accurate these memories are, but they may very well be true. If they visited Hecht at the scripting stages, it seems reasonable to assume that they may have also visited Hawks after the film was complete. What’s more, it seems fitting that Al Capone might have been narcissistic enough to enjoy seeing a sympathetic rendering of a gangster that was modeled after him. In any case, it made a great anecdote, and Hawks certainly knew how to tell a story.\n\nUnfortunately, even a first-class raconteur like Hawks can’t make a film without an assortment of actors to bring their stories to life. Oral histories as to the casting of Scarface are as contradictory as those about the writing. The one thing that is clear is that the production had limited options. Most (if not all) of the well-known screen stars of the era were under contract to major studios, and they had limited resources in which to pay star salaries. It was clear that they would need to take another route.\n\n“After we did the script, we couldn’t borrow any money, and we couldn’t get an actor. I told Howard I was going to New York to see what I could do. I saw Muni in a Jewish theater on 39th Street playing an old, old man. I asked him if he’d like to do the picture, and he said, ‘I’m not that kind of a guy.’ I said, ‘Well, are you afraid to make a test?’ ‘No,’ he said. So we built some clothes and made him look husky and put him on a four-inch platform. We got little people to play with him, and he made the test, and he was very pleased. Muni could do any damn thing that you could tell him to do. When he took the job, Muni told me, ‘I’m not an athlete. I’m a completely sedentary man.’ And I said, ‘We’ll take care of that.’ He had to hit somebody. I don’t know whether you remember, he hit somebody, and they went right over a table. I got a friend of mine who just happened to have been middleweight champion of the world, and I said, ‘Can you teach this guy how to throw a punch?’ He said sure…” —Howard Hawks (‘Scarface’ and Howard Hughes, Hawks on Hawks, 1982)\n\nThe validity of the detail about Hawks finding Muni in a Jewish theater has been called into serious question, but there’s no question that the actor brought something special to the role. In fact, his manic energy sometimes went too far over the line, and it could be a struggle for the director to subdue that energy when it was necessary. Apparently, even the best actors can occasionally overact.\n\n“When he was going to end up lying in the street with his head in what the horse had left there, he was going to play the scene very dramatically. He came downstairs and was yellow like an actor being yellow, not playing it for honesty. I talked to him about it, and he did it the same way. So I went over and started a game of poker, and he began to get more and more fidgety. Finally, he came over and said, ‘When are we going to do the scene?’ and I said, ‘Whenever you decide to do it the way it should be done.’ About five minutes later he came over and said, ‘OK. I’ll do it.’ And he really played the devil out of it, you know.” —Howard Hawks (The Rule of the Game, Who the Devil Made It, 1962-1972)\n\nOf course, there were other roles to cast as well.\n\n“Osgood Perkins I saw in a play, doing the lead in a love story; George Raft I saw at a prizefight; Ann Dvorak was a chorus girl down at Metro-Goldwyn, making forty a week, and I got her out of her contract because a vice-president at Metro-Goldwyn liked me; Karen Morley went around with some fellow I knew, and I thought she was attractive. Boris Karloff had just been in The Criminal Code. He said, ‘I don’t care how small it is — I’m going to have a part.’ He thought I was good for him. Little Vince Barnett had been hiring out as a waiter — insulting people at the Coconut Grove. So we just collected actors and went into a little dust-covered studio and opened it up. We were an entity unto ourselves, and we made a picture. The whole thing was a challenge and a lot of fun. Then it turned out very well and became a kind of legend.” —Howard Hawks (The Rule of the Game, Who the Devil Made It, 1962-1972)\n\nActually, Scarface is probably known as much for its noiresque style as it is for the many breakthrough performances.\n\n“I had a great cameraman — Lee Garmes. He used half the light of an ordinary cameraman. We had more light in the houselights than we did on the set. We had just got some faster film, too… The funny thing about making that key scene between [Tony and Cesca] — I rehearsed it again and again. I was shaking my head, and Lee Garmes said, ‘What’s the matter?’ and I said, ‘Lee, something’s wrong. You shouldn’t be able to see faces when you hear lines like that.” He said, “Can you wait ten minutes?’ He sent for a pair of curtains that had a pronounced pattern so the light barely came through. He turned out all the front light and just shot it in backlight. [That] made a really good scene out of it. So if you’re ever stuck and get into a scene you don’t think should be exposed to people — shoot it so they can’t be seen too well. It can cure an awful lot of evils.” —Howard Hawks (The Rule of the Game, Who the Devil Made It, 1962-1972)\n\nThe third and most controversial ingredient in the film (perhaps even more controversial than the hints of an incestuous brother and sister relationship) was the film’s violence and carnage. It was always going to be a violent movie, but it seems like the carnage was only elevated during the production stages.\n\n“Hughes would see the rushes and call and say, ‘That’s great stuff. Keep on going.’ You remember where there’s about five wrecks? Well, I had made one wreck for the reign of terror sequence. ‘Oh, God,’ he said, ‘that’s a great wreck. When are you gonna do some more?’ ‘Well,’ I said, ‘I hadn’t figured on it. Do you think it would be a good idea?’ He said, ‘Yeah.’ I remember when Lewis Milestone saw the picture he said, ‘You’re not going to have all that stuff in there, are you?’ I said, ‘I’m thinking about it.’ ‘Oh, God,’ he said, ‘that’s too much.’ Hell, I think that’s one of the good things about the picture… It was much more violent than any other picture that had been made to that time.” —Howard Hawks (The Rule of the Game, Who the Devil Made It, 1962-1972)\n\nIt was the violence that created the most problem with censorship boards when it came time to release the film. In fact, it is almost impossible to discuss the film without also discussing censorship. Of course, Howard Hughes was vocally against censorship, and his battle with the censors received an incredible amount of publicity. His statements articulated his stance in no uncertain terms:\n\n“It becomes a serious threat to the freedom of honest expression in America when self-styled guardians of the public welfare, as personified by our film censor boards, lend their influence to the abortive efforts of selfish and vicious interests to suppress a motion picture simply because it depicts the truths about conditions in this country which have been front-page news since the advent of prohibition.” —Howard Hughes (as quoted in “Hughes, Hawks, and Hays: The Monumental Censorship Battle Over Scarface,” The Journal of American Culture, June 2017)\n\nThe publicity probably helped the film at the box-office, but the inserted scenes added to appease censors stick out like a sore thumb. This fact still irritated Hughes years later, and he was unable to discuss the film without also talking about the damage done what might have otherwise been a masterpiece of the genre.\n\n“It was a hell of a good film and I was delighted with the results. That is, until I showed it to Will Hays, the Hollywood censorship mogul, and our troubles started. Today people say there should be more censorship because of the violence in movies, but there sure should have been less at the time I made Scarface. Will Hays, with his holier-than-thou attitudes, made speeches about how my film was un-American and how we should present a better image to the world… But in America, according to Will Hays, we didn’t have any gangsters — or if we did, we swept them under the carpet. I went along with them part way because I knew otherwise, I would have a tough time getting distribution.\n\nI changed one scene after another, even put in a totally phony endings showing Scarface hanged — the trial, the sanctimonious speech by the judge. They changed the title. They called it The Shame of the Nation… One other thing was notable about Scarface. In the Hays Office version, the New York Police Commissioner, Mulrooney, wrote the prologue to it, telling how noble everyone on the police force was, and how organized crime didn’t exist in the United States, it was all a myth. I saw a copy of the text before it was used, and I said, ‘This is pap for babies.’ I figured that I had to give it some juice, some fire. So, I changed it, saying that the best way to stop crime in the United States was to prohibit the sale of firearms and their distribution interstate. That was included in the commissioner’s speech.” —Howard Hughes (The Autobiography of Howard Hughes, 1972)\n\nThe censorship issues also created issues with the film’s distributor.\n\n“Joe Schenck of United Artists — UA was supposed to release the picture — was giving me a hard time too. He wanted to make a statement to the press just before the premiere in New Orleans that the picture was a social document which would help the police in their fight against crime — and some more bullshit to the effect that the changes were all good ones, and how grateful we were to the various police departments for suggesting them to us. He was afraid I’d open up my mouth about what a lot of crap this was and how the original version was so much better. He wanted the world to forget there’d ever been an original version, and he knew I’d never let them forget. Then they showed the changed version to the New York censors, and the New York censors rejected it as unacceptable. ‘Hell,’ I said, ‘if I’m going to have an unacceptable film, I might as well have an unacceptable good film’ — and I threw out all the changes and went back to the original version, and that’s the one that finally got distributed.” —Howard Hughes (The Autobiography of Howard Hughes, 1972)\n\nWhile the film’s original ending was, in fact, restored to the theatrically released version of the film, they were still forced to use the censorship ending in a few states that had local censorship boards. What’s more, there were a few censorship scenes that remained shoehorned into the film’s final assembly. These scenes are the film’s biggest and most irritating flaw. They stick out like a very pretentious sore thumb, and it is clear that Howard Hawks wasn’t particularly fond of these additions when he spoke of them.\n\n“[The film avoided moralizing], except for that one sequence which was put in for the censors, in which all the mayors of the towns were talking… It was made as a sop for the censors. When Hughes asked me about it, I said, ‘It can’t hurt the picture. Everybody will know it wasn’t part of the picture.’ The censors wrote it; somebody shot it. I didn’t come around for it. I didn’t want to have anything to do with it. There were a few things that had to be done to get by the censors.” —Howard Hawks (The Rule of the Game, Who the Devil Made It, 1962-1972)\n\nThe trouble is that the scene does hurt the film, and it hurts the film precisely because it is all too evident that it is a scene that has been obviously added as an afterthought. It takes the viewer out of the film and is a slow moving tonal hiccup to a film that otherwise moves at a rapid-fire pace. Even so, the film ended up being a huge audience pleaser, and the critics were behind Hughes.\n\n“After a press screening of that [so-called] un-amended version was rapturously received in Los Angeles, journalists started criticizing the Hays Office for its stance. ‘The absurdities of film censorship have never been carried further than in the case of Howard Hughes’s new screen sensation — Scarface,’ declared the Los Angeles Times… Scarface was a huge victory for Hughes — morally and financially. It was United Artists’ biggest hit of 1932, and Hughes’s contract entitled him to receive 75 percent of the profits netted from the film’s $900,000 gross. It would also be his last hurrah in Hollywood for most of the rest of the 1930s, at least as a producer.” —Karina Longworth (Seduction: Sex, Lies, and Stardom in Howard Hughes’s Hollywood, November 13, 2018)\n\nScarface remains one of the most watchable films made during that rickety early talkie era, and it is essential viewing for anyone who enjoys the genre.\n\nThe Presentation:\n\n4 of 5 Stars\n\nVia Vision Entertainment’s thirty-second Imprint disc is housed in a clear Blu-ray case with an insert sleeve that features attractive artwork featuring the film’s titular character. This is essentially the same kind of case that Arrow Video uses for their releases.\n\nThe limited edition (1500 copies) of this release will protect the case with a cardboard slipcase that features artwork based upon one of the film’s original one sheet designs. Collectors will be pleased to note that the rating sticker is on the plastic wrapping and not on the actual slipcase and doesn’t ruin the packaging.\n\nThe static menu utilizes the same design featured on the insert sleeve and is reasonably attractive and easy to navigate.\n\nPicture Quality:\n\n4 of 5 Stars\n\nIf one compares Imprint’s new 1080P Blu-ray transfer to earlier DVD editions, one can instantly see that this is a superior image in nearly every respect as fine detail is revelatory in comparison, the image hasn’t been stretched, the contrast is more pleasing, and there is quite a bit more information in the frame. However, this is an extremely old title, and it carries with it the limitations inherent to films of the period. The image is decidedly on the soft side, and there is a fairly heavy layer of grain. These are not problems but simply how the film looks. We’d much rather see the grain than a heavy dose of DNR. There also seems to be less damage on display here. Both versions of the film are of equally good quality.\n\nSound Quality:\n\n4 of 5 Stars\n\nThe included 2.0 Mono Linear PCM track is probably as good as one can expect from a film that was made during the early “talkie” era. Suffice it to say that it is a solid representation of the film’s original mono audio mix, and this is really all that one should expect. Those who are used to watching early sound era titles will know what to expect, and they will be pleased with this faithful transfer. The lossless results in more noticeable depth than what fans heard on DVD editions of the film.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\n4 of 5 Stars\n\nAlternate Censored Version\n\nThe alternate “Censored Version” of Scarface is available on the disc as well, but the changes can all be found during the film’s final ten minutes (which is available to watch separately as well).\n\nFeature Length Audio Commentary with Drew Casper (Theatrical Version)\n\nDrew Casper is obviously knowledgeable about his subject, and he reveals a lot of interesting information about the production here (particularly about Hawks and Hecht). He also offers some light analysis and a few interesting observations along the way. Some might find his delivery to be a bit on the dry side, but anyone interested in the film probably won’t notice or even care.\n\nAlternate Ending — (10:38)\n\nThe ending from the censored version of the film is available to watch divorced from the rest of the film for those who do not wish to sit through an entire film in order to see the censored version’s ending.\n\nTony Rayns on Scarface — (27:20)\n\nTony Rayns discusses the two Howards (Hawks and Hughes), the director’s tendency to fabricate stories about the making of his films, Ben Hecht’s participation as the writer, censorship, and quite a few other pertinent subjects. It’s an informative discussion about the film and its production that earns a place on this disc.\n\nMatthew Sweet on Scarface — (22:27)\n\nMatthew Sweet’s interview discusses censorship quite a bit in addition to the film’s legacy. It’s a decent addition to the supplemental package.\n\nTheatrical Trailer — (02:53)\n\nA vintage theatrical trailer is included, but it’s not necessary the one used for the film’s original release. In any case, it’s cool to have it here.\n\nIntroduction by Robert Osborne — (02:22)\n\nRobert Osborne’s introduction for Turner Classic Movies is included as an added perk, but the information in it is fairly generalized and included in other supplements.\n\nFinal Words:\n\n“We made Scarface because the violence of this particular era was interesting. Scarface is still being copied — and hence still lives. There were fifteen murders in Scarface, and people said I was crazy to have so many. But I knew that was the story: violence made the story. Also, in practice, all the gangster movies that have followed Scarface only reiterated the same material.” —Howard Hawks (The Genius of Howard Hawks, Cahiers du Cinéma, February 1956)\n\nThe original Scarface may very well be tame by today’s standards, but it certainly has had an influence on all the various “gangster films” that followed. Fans of Howard Hawks will also want to check this film out if they haven’t already seen it, and Imprint’s new Blu-ray edition is a terrific way to do this. Recommended."
