        "text": "Scarface Responses: A short paper detailing your reactions to Howard Hawks' Scarface (1932). Include in your response your view Tony Camonte's character and whether the film glorifies violence and gangsters.\n\nJeanie A:\n\nTony Comante, the protagonist in Scarface; Shame of the Nation, is presented as a brass, self-assured man who desires power and wealth. In regard to society�s view of a proper and dignified way to make a living, morality and ethics are challenged when Comante uses violence and manipulation to acquire high status in the Italian mob. He carries this mentality through all of his endeavors, including those involving his family and love interests.\n\nComante�s character can be viewed as complex or simple, depending on how the audience views him. He is portrayed in a subtle manner due to short and direct nonverbal expressions, particularly in the first few interactions with the police officer that indicate his resistance toward authority. His resistance toward authority is also demonstrated in his first interaction with Johnny Lovo, his new boss preceding his former title as the bodyguard for Louie Castillo. In this interaction, the audience can also observe a sense of disrespect for authority in his constant gestures and comments toward a love interest, Lovo�s girlfriend Poppy. His inability to react in a serious way to Poppy�s sarcastic and disinterested remarks can be interpreted as a sly form of humor or simply blatant stupidity. Regardless, his behavior and progressive power begins to attract Poppy, who supports and assists him in his violent masquerades.\n\nUp until the scene in which O�hara�s mob attacks the restaurant where Comante and his gang are located, the film appears to glorify violence and gangsters. Comante strikes fear in his enemies, as well as in his family and cohorts, due to his love for violence and power. His relentless attempt to gain the utmost power and murder anyone who might interrupt his journey can be articulated in the advice he offers Gino: �Do it first, , and keep doin� it�. This advice serves as his own justification for his actions and becomes even more prominent and dangerous when he proves to the audience that, under these circumstances, one can live by it and execute plans.\n\nIn the same scene, in which O�hara�s mob attempts to shoot Comante, character development continues as Comante�s actions glorify violence through his callous reaction to the dangers of gunfire. Not only is Comante not afraid of the gunfire, but he is also excited and motivated by it. The glorification of violence is also demonstrated when Gino rather effortlessly acquires a machine gun from O�hara�s mob during the shooting. Perhaps the most dangerous portrayal of all is the humor during the shooting, which conveys the idea that violence can be entertaining, perhaps enlightening the audience to a bright or positive side to violence. The film also conveys the idea that violence can be empowering when Comante encounters Lovo at the pool hall and begins firing his machine gun at the wall. In this action, he proudly exclaims that he will, in bullets, write his name all over town, thus presenting the concept that power and ownership can be attained through violence. It is this notion of power through violence that can make violence attractive to those watching it, thus making it a threat to society.\n\nKaren A: A most memorable and engaging character in the 1932 film, �Scarface,� is Tony Camonte. The first view we get of Camonte we don�t even see his �scarface.� I think that was strategically done because when the face isn�t shown just yet, curiosity builds, and when you�re waiting to see one�s face you will probably take in every detail of that face when you do see it. That�s what happened to me and I quickly found him unattractive. His demeanor towards the police sped that on, as he spoke disrespectfully, and instigated trouble. By acting nonchalant towards the police, I think he is a calm, cool, cocky sort of man who is obviously up to no good. Lighting a match on the cop�s badge is a clear sign he�s a bad man, holding no respect for authority. At the police questioning, Camonte is again calm, carefully selecting the words he uses, revealing nothing, showing he is completely guilty and/or loyal to Johnny Lovo. Camonte wants his way and works fast to get it his way, a later quote in the restaurant scene just before the shooting, when Poppy says, �You work fast don�t you? Camonte is later shown as ruthless, greedy, and eager to �run the whole works,� as he puts it. He is confident to the point of egotistical and fearless to the point of stupidity. A number of examples of this are present throughout the film. One occurring as Camonte goes on his violent spree, taking orders from bars in favor of Lovo�s business and disobedient to him by eliminating Berdine, Siegler, and harming Meehan-only to later kill him at the hospital. This just shows his ruthless, serial-killer like behavior, yet is softened by cunning, charming flirting with Poppy. He is bold though, and dismissive of everyone else�s feelings. For example, when he joins Poppy at a restaurant after coming back from his second visit to the police station, Poppy says she�s hungry, and says, �Why don�t you order something already?� He ignores her request. At present the most glorification of violence is at this very scene when the North Side gang drives by shooting off their machine guns. The director fails completely at showing the devastating effects of such a violent crime. The focus remains on Camonte as he is getting a kick out of it, smiling, and assured everything is exciting right now. Even his secretary, Angelo, (�Dope�) is caught up in a comedic scenario with the phone, and a barrel of water spilling out through a bullet hole onto his clothes.\n\nSamantha B:\n\nLindsey C:\n\nAfter seeing the beginning of the film, Scarface appears to glorify the gangster lifestyle. The main character, Tony Camonte is portrayed in a positive light; even though he is arrogant and ignorant, he has a very nice house, expensive clothes, and even ends up with the beautiful girl, all of which were highly coveted and unattainable for many moviegoers during this era.\n\nWhile it may be based on real events, it overlooks key negative impacts of a criminal life. In reality the life of a gangster is far from glorious. The movie never mentions the emotional distress of killing people for a living, or the impact the senseless violence has on families and innocent bystanders. The film even makes light of a violent shooting scene, in which many innocent people are injured. Tony and Poppy are dining in a Caf� when Tony gets a phone call. Tony�s secretary takes the call, and as he fumbles with the call a comedic scene incorrectly makes light of the violent shooting taking place at the very same time. Tony is not even scared of the volley of gunfire and is too distracted by the powerful machine guns they are using.\n\nThe caf� shooting scene hardly compares to a later scene, after Tony gets his own machine gun. He eyes glow as he tests out his new toy. The elation on his face, and approval from his new admirer Poppy send a message that almost directly praises violence. The machine guns are an answer to his prayers, and his means to attaining power; both horrible messages to subliminally or directly convey to youth.\n\nThe Hayes office, through a series of negotiations, attempted to lessen the violent influence the film might have on society by cutting out portions and adding others. But parts that were cut out might have actually sent a better message overall. The final film lacked the blood and gore necessary to show the downsides of a gangster life. A dramatic, heartfelt goodbye from a husband to his wife as she lay dying from a stray bullet would have ultimately had a more positive message for the audience about how harmful criminals can be. The added text that introduces the movie is likely forgotten when the first murder takes place, no more than ten minutes into the movie. It claims that the picture is �an indictment of gang rule� but that contradicts the actual meaning the movie has, invalidating the disclaimer at the beginning.\n\nScarface not only glorifies violence but promotes it and educates the populace about positive gangster lifestyles, while ignoring the negative impacts. Tony becomes a character the audience can relate to and admire. This film became one of many sensational yet one-sided stories that indirectly encourage criminal behavior.\n\nKelly Clinton:\n\nViewed as a self-assured, arrogant gangster, Tony Camonte takes on the main character role portraying Al Capone in the original filming of Scarface in 1932. Throughout this movie, Tony Camonte can be seen as very sarcastic, carefree, and not intimidated by any authority figure. Furthermore, he is insolent and resistant to anyone that tells him �no.�\n\nTony Camonte, identified as the main character by an X-shaped scar on his face, is first seen inside the barber shop when he is confronted by police about the murder of Louis Costillo, the man in which he was a body guard for. After referring to the chief of police as �the kidney foot� and lighting a match on the officer�s badge to light his cigarette, the barber shop is where we first get an impression of Camonte�s character because he is cocky and disrespectful towards the officer and all authority figures present. This same attitude is repeated in later scenes in the movie such as when Camonte is speaking with Lovo, and he catches a glimpse of Poppy, Lovo�s girlfriend. Camonte can�t keep his attention away from her and in turn, shows signs of negligence for his boss. Overall, I believe Tony Camonte�s character is extremely unattractive. They seem to depict him as a tough guy in the mob who was never smart enough to make it to Wall Street so he went about his way killing people and acting out.\n\nThe violence shown in this film is frightening and scary, but the way that the gangsters are depicted leads people to believe that the violence is not taken seriously. In the scene where Tony Camonte is eating and flirting at the caf� with Poppy, O�Hara�s North Side gang comes through and starts to shoot up the South Side. Camonte�s secretary, �Dope�, who answered the fake phone call to Camonte, remains on the phone despite the shootings all around him and the hot water that is pouring on him after a gun-shot pierced a hole in a coffee pot. Tony protects Poppy as they take cover, but all Tony can think about is getting one of the remarkable machine guns the North Side was using. The other passer-bys that may have been injured or killed are not exposed in the plot so this also leads people to believe that there was not a huge sense of urgency while this raid and gang violence was occurring. Although this film may depict violence that leads people to think that it is not to be taken seriously because gangs were prominent after the Great Depression, the younger children of America during this time may see it as appropriate behavior in their own lives. Since there is more to the plot than solely the attack from the North Side, children will assume that crime, violence, and gangs are not as noticed and frightening as they really are.\n\nJackie F:\n\n�Scarface was directed by Howard Hawks in 1932 and is a representation of New York City mobster life during that era. The main character, Tony Camonte, is portrayed as both an arrogant and overconfident man who wants nothing more than to rule the streets. He will stop at nothing to get this and claims that �There is only one thing that gives orders and gets orders and that�s my gun�.\n\nAlthough Tony has many characteristics that individuals should dislike he comes across as somewhat attractive. He constantly makes remarks and comments that are dim-witted but with this brings laughter and appeal. For a man with such wrongdoing one would expect audiences to despise him, but that is not the case. I believe that Tony is so interesting to audiences is because he is such a �bad guy�. I feel that people are intrigued with this type of behavior and find stupidity and egotism amusing. Because Tony makes the spectators laugh, it is hard not to like him.\n\nWhen this movie was first released, it produced a plethora of controversy over violence in the media. Some claimed the movie had glorified violence and gangsters and should be censored. I agree with the statement that the film glorified gangsters but do not feel as though the movie was at all violent. I do not think it was violent because I have grown up in a world of killing video games and violence all over television. In the 1930�s though, I could see how they found this movie to be violent. For example, in the shootout scene, set in the restaurant, between the gangs from the North and South we see round after round of bullets being shot at both mobsters and innocent victims. This scene I found to be aggressive. The funny thing, no pun intended, was that it was censored to seem less violent, but through censoring the scene they made it appear funny. I think this was the worst way they could have censored the movie because by making violence funny it disharmonizes what we find funny. Therefore, if we see an act of violence with humorous undertones, the next time we see a similar act of violence we might find it humorous. No violence is comical, and should never be portrayed as such.\n\nIn conclusion, �Scarface� is a great movie in the use of studying violence in the media and whether or not censorship should be used in movies. I did not find the movie to be too violent; I found that they censored the film to make violence funny which, in turn, made it worse. Furthermore, the main character Tony who should have been unlikable was cast to be attractive and appealing which glorified gangsters and made them more alluring.\n\nBen G:\n\nAfter watching Hawk's cinematic film, Scareface, i gained a new love for black and white movies. The film was definitly a classic and i can see why its struck such a cord with critics of the time. It was bang bang mayem centered around the slick, hot-tempered ganster Tony Camonte. Tony came off as a guy looking to make a name for himself. Instead of taking his time and playing it safe, Tony only knew how to jump into action and get the job done. He definitly displayed leadership qualities even when he started out as a small timer. He quickly rose to the top because he wasn't afraid to act, and act violently to add. Tony's temper is a little out of of control, as can be noted during the scenes where he attacks his sister. He even kills his best friend out of shear rage without a second thought. Does this movie glorify the life of a gangster? I don't think so, because in the end, everyone of them loses. Its not a great life when you have to walk down the street with ten bod yguards surrounding you just to stay alive. Gangster have constant enemies, are involved in constant gunslinging, and are in constant danger of losing their lives. This movie displays this idea well. People need to give the younger viewers a little more credit. It is unreasonable to think kids will be watching this movie and plunge into a life of crime. This story shows the real consequences of that and i dont think anyone wants a part of a gangster's life.\n\nSafa K:\n\nTony Camonte, the main character in Howard Hawks� 1932 film �Scarface�, is an ambitious and arrogant person. Camonte�s disregard of authority and his pursuit of self interest both make him an attractive character to the viewer. The gangster lifestyle was glamorized during the 1930�s because of the government�s inability to help people during the depression. Tony Camonte lived by one law, which was �Do it first, Do it yourself, and keep on doin it�, this was evident in the ways that he went around Lovo and disregarded orders. During the shootout scene at the restaraunt, Camonte was excited and fearless, this type of reaction strikes fear into others. Tony is very competitive, both in business and in love, the viewer sees him taking increasing control of Lovo�s business and girlfriend, Poppy. The lack of education makes Tony seem harmless on many occasions, Poppy repeatedly makes comments to Tony that are meant to be insulting, however he does not seem to realize this and considers them compliments. Camonte�s boldness and charisma make him an attractive and likeable character, not knowing what to expect from him. Although the gangster lifestyle is violent, and based on illegal business, people seem to have a slight empathy towards to gangsters. Hawk�s was able to portray a lot of Tony�s character through his facial expressions, expressing anger and confidence many times, especially in scenes with the police and Lovo, authoritative figures. Camonte�s eagerness to do any job is part of his drive to become the leader and in control of everything. The film may seem to oppose the gangster lifestyle due to the censors, however it also seems to glorify the lifestyle.\n\nKara K:\n\nHoward Hawks� 1932 production, Scarface is a gangster film that gives an insight to gang warfare and illustrates the fatal, brutal reality of a life of crime. This film was the epitome of violence and was an indictment of the glorification and acceptance of gangster menace during this time period. The entertaining and somewhat comedic aspects of Scarface give light to the mass murders, illegal interactions, and implied corruption that is proceeding in this film.\n\nI thought that the gangsters in Scarface were repeatedly portrayed as rather ignorant, remorseless, and childish criminals who did not fully comprehend the extent of their misconduct. The protagonist, Tony Camonte is an ambitious gangster who embarks on a reign of terror in order to achieve more power in the mob society. Camonte is an over confident, arrogant yet charismatic figure who exemplifies the macho male persona. For this reason, I believe that Tony Camonte is an attractive character to the audience and greatly appeals to the male audience as a glorified, powerful mobster.\n\nThis film seems to be giving consent to violence by adding in humorous touches to conceal the enormity of the gangsters� transgressions to the audience. Take for example the comedic performance of Camonte�s secretary, Angelo, during one of the most brutal and vicious scenes that is the confrontation with the North Side mobsters in the restaurant that was under rapid fire and incursion. The entertaining/comedic performance�s in Scarface make the horrific acts of violence and decadence appeal significantly to an audience who has its first glimpse of an action packed film and sets the stage for many more to come in the future.\n\nMarjorie M:\n\nHoward Hawks� 1932 film, Scarface seems to glorify and promote violence and gangs by depicting gangsters in a position of high power and wealth. By intimidating each other and the community, gangs have risen to an extraordinary power, power which not even the police can contain. Gangsters have absolutely no respect for police authority or the law. The film revolves around the time of prohibition and the gangsters are in the business of selling illegal alcohol to the public.\n\nThe film is especially generous to the �bad boy� characters. Johnny is the self proclaimed �president� of Louis old turf. Johnny has killed and manipulated his to the top and now has money and a girlfriend to show off to his minions. Gangster Tony Camonte is portrayed as an all around �tough guy�. He is a smart mouthed thug who is not easily intimidated by law enforcement. Although Tony is not the �president� but second in command he has succeeded, through his criminal actions, to get what he wants; power, wealth, and Poppy (Johnny�s girlfriend).\n\nAlthough the film was censored by Hay�s laws, the underling message seemed to have been missed. In order to get what you want there is �only one law you gotta follow to keep out of trouble. Do it first. Do it yourself. And keep on doing it.� Of course, the most likeable character, to this point, delivers this all so powerful line. Although Tony is portrayed to be a tough gangster, he also shows a playful side. He is a man who just wants to live well and carefree. What teenager could not relate to that? For the time in which this film was produced, young people as well as older people where equally as desperate to find a way of making money and movies like Scarface only made gang living seem like the best way to live.\n\nMark O:\n\nA classic picture that incorporated expression and sound, Scarface: The Shame of the Nation premiered in 1932 to major criticism. Released during a time when jobs were scarce, money was tight, and based on a theory that violence was taking over our nation; this movie told a story of how gangsters and mobs were running the streets. It is very interesting to see how the main character, Tony Camonte, is portrayed as dense yet extremely intelligent in a world of violence and killings.\n\nTony Camonte, played by Paul Muni, was the main focal point of this movie. From his very first entrance to his last scene, he has such a strong commanding presence; to which he uses to gain control in tough situations. Even Poppy, the sultry lead female, knows that Tony is someone that is going to go far in the business. However, I believe that she is trying to just protect herself from ruin and therefore follows whoever has the money and the courage to lead the mob. Tony might play dense when it comes to Poppy, played by the lovely Karen Morely; however, when it comes to the business he knows the only law of the streets: �The one law to keep out of trouble�Do it first, do it yourself, and keep on doin it.� Tony makes no bones about taking care of the business. After all he is a survivor and he takes care of business first, so know one will take care of him first.\n\nI believe that this is a strong characteristic for Tony and one that is so needed during the movie. However, I feel that this might be his one and true downfall. Like any great tragedy, someone will die in the end and usually it is the main character. In this case, I think that Tony�s cocky, self-assured attitude is going to prove disastrous and send him for the dirt nap in the end. This movie might have portrayed gangsters in the wrong light and the youth might have gotten the wrong idea about the business. However, it is just a movie and the ability to separate fact from fiction is the responsibility of the moviegoer. Tony is just a character: flawed, intriguing, a true enigma; he is still just a character in a movie. This movie can no more make a Saint than it can make a killer. It is purely entertainment.\n\nNow I know that there are going to be those that argue that kids model what they see on television and on the big screen. To that I ask: isn�t it our responsibility as parents to teach our children right from wrong, good from bad, and fact from fiction. Seriously, what little girl honestly believes that the knight always races with his sword drawn to save and win the princess� heart? It is make believe and mind-less entertainment. Mr. Hawks did a fine job portraying the gangster life.\n\nReshma P:\n\nTony Camonte has several characteristics, which make him the character he portrays in the movie Scarface. My first instinct was that he was really into his looks. He demonstrates this when he is in the saloon and he checks out his hair in the mirror as the cops approach him. Also throughout the movie he is very much into the expensive suits and jewelry. Secondly, Camonte is definitely a man of style. Not only in his appearance but also with his actions. For example, instead of being worried when the police want to take him to the station, he instead lights his match by striking the officers badge. Camontes humoristic persona makes him a likeable character, which people would like to associate with. He is not only purposely funny, but his lack in knowledge at times adds to his character and makes the audience laugh. When Camonte gives his sister money, I think this is very sweet of him, as a brother. He mentions he wants to see her have fun and as a brother this shows that he cares for his sister, although the money is not earned in the best way. I feel that Tony Camonte is a likeable character because of these certain characteristics he demonstrates.\n\nThere are several other characteristics, which Camonte possesses which I feel adds some disliking to his character. Tony Camonte lives and acts as he pleases and he can be perceived as an authoritative figure throughout the movie. For example, when he confronts his sister, Cesca, he appears to be more like a �father� figure than a brother. When he shoots the machine gun in the �violence� scene, he appears to be enjoying it very much, mainly because this makes him feel powerful. He also hits the man in charge of one of the salons when he is trying to get him to purchase beer from Lovo. I found that Tony gets his way a lot, many times by beating people up. He also feels that he is better than others, especially when he says, �Lovo is not much smarter than Louis.� I feel that Camonte is ambitious, by looking at his actions. We can see that he is �money driven� when he is at Lovos bargaining, and also when he encounters Poppy both on the stairway and when she visits him at his place. He shows her all of his belongings that he is proud of. These characteristics show another �side� to Tony Camonte that I feel are not bad. Overall I think that this character is easy going, unless if you get into his bad book by getting in the way of what he wants.\n\nDang P:\n\nI have had a chance to watch a part of a 1930�s film, the Scarface, and I think this was a good film compare to other films at that time. Besides having trouble understanding the 1930�s accent, I was still able to get across much of the detail of the film and the subtitle helps me a lot too. I was attracted to this film quickly right after I saw the �scarface� character, a gangster named Tony Camonte, because of his characteristics and his behavior development throughout the film. In my opinion, Tony Camonte is a simple-minded gangster who is a no brainer, but he always thinks himself as the best and does not even know people around are laughing at him. An example of that could be when Poppy always looks down, and laughs at him. Tony Camonte actually does not act or behave as a real gangster but as a beer dealer. He acts similar to a bully who wonders around messing things up and not dealing with the situations at all. For instance, he forced and killed the club owners to consume his beer. He can�t be called a �beer dealer�, but he is a stupid, stubborn killer who is really a shame of the nation. From what I see, Tony Camonte is a very immature guy, and an immature person can not have his own rules except the dumb rules. Indeed, Tony Camonte does have his �do it first, do it yourself, and keep on doing it�. I was laughing at him when I heard these rules to which I think were ridiculous. I myself have never been a gangster and I never like being one either. However, I have watched many movies which were about gangsters and violence issue, and I didn�t think his laws work fine for him. I think this �scarface� guy tried to be smart to show off to his fellow, Guino. However, his own law seemed fascinating, �do it first to be died fast, do it himself so he can die quick, and keep on doing dumb thing�. In addition, the film Scarface does not glorify violence and gangster issue, in my opinion. The film maker made this film in purpose to criticize, laugh at, and look down on the mobs, gangsters who were and are always the shame of the nation. That�s why instead of being created as an important and dangerous character, the gangster Tony Camonte was built as a clown that is full of sense of humor so the audiences can laugh at him through out the film. The picture of Tony Camonte is compared to the violence in the 1930�s as a laughing issue, and can be prevented successfully by the government. Finally, I also guess that the film maker sent an urgent message to all the gangsters in the nation that �try turning back into the good citizens, and don�t be foolish,� and as �funny� as Tony Camonte who intended to take over the North �himself� with his only one machine gun, don�t be the shame of the nation anymore�.\n\nKaren R:\n\nOnce the movie began we watched a scene where Tony Camonte was being arrested by Ben Guarino. During this scene I felt Tony seemed incredibly rude. He displayed a complete disregard for authority by not cooperating with the police. Tony was trying too hard to be the tough guy. Also, Tony showed a large amount of disrespect for the police when he lit his match on Guarino�s badge. However, after this Guarino punched Tony in the face knocking him over. You could tell the two men had interacted before and that Tony has had previous experience with the police.\n\nAt this point I felt Tony was not a very likeable character. The rude and obnoxious behavior was a real �turnoff.� I found it hard to connect to and understand his character. My opinion however, may be a bit biased since I will be going into law enforcement upon graduation. Those who dispute the law are often viewed as menaces to society and are seen as being unintelligent. The only reason Tony does not like this officer is because he has actually done something wrong by being involved with the murder of Castello.\n\nThroughout the movie there is a side story that involves Tony and his boss�s (Lovo) girlfriend Poppy. Just the thought of Tony trying to pursue Poppy is another example of Tony�s disregarding authority. Tony visited Lovo�s house and this is where he first met Poppy. Poppy would not even say �Hello� in response to Tony�s greeting. Despite all this, Tony is still extremely attracted to her. You can tell Poppy is also slightly interested by the sole fact that she stays in the same room throughout the entire duration of Tony�s visit.\n\nLater on Poppy begins to warm up to Tony by joking around with him on occasion. She made a comment about his ugly suit but with the big words she used, Tony apparently did not understand what she meant. He ended up taking the nasty comment as a complement. Poppy then laughed at Tony and he never caught on. This sort of interaction between the two happened a few more times and, once again, Tony never realized Poppy was putting him down.\n\nSome say the fact that Tony does not �get� Poppy�s insults is an attractive thing. This �cuteness� makes Tony a more likeable character even though he is running around beating up and killing people. I do not feel this way. Tony�s inability to catch on to the small things makes him look silly. I feel he is disrespectful to anyone who gets in his way and he only wants Poppy for her looks. Tony just seems like bad news all around.\n\nEd R:\n\nFilmed in 1932, the original Scarface is a very entertaining movie who�s main character, Tony Camonte can be viewed as a charismatic villain. The movie opens with a scene in a restaurant after the �south side gangster boss� Louie Costillo throws a big party as it appears he is celebrating his own belief that he is �on top of the world�. A few minutes later in the film, Costillo is gunned down by someone who knew him. Later we find out the killer is Tony Camonte, Costillo�s strongman, who has decided to change �bosses� to Johnny Lovo and by doing so must kill Costillo.\n\nI personally found the gangster characters, including the main character Tony Camonte, to be fairly repulsive. We first meet Tony when he is brought in for questioning as a likely suspect for the Louie Costillo killing. Immediately you get the impression that Camonte is an egotistical, disrespectful, uneducated thug that is fearless and possibly psychotic. Camonte�s lack of respect for authority and fearlessness is first apparent as he strikes a match on the badge of the office dispatched to bring him in for questioning. Tony�s partner in crime, Rinaldo, is an even more sinister character because he is dark, mysterious and quiet.\n\nThe gangsters portrayed in this movie are probably fairly realistic for the 1930�s America. The movie is shot from the point of view of an observer who follows Camonte around. This gives the audience insight into Camonte�s life. What the camera intentionally misses is an accurate portrayal of the destruction wrought by Camote�s actions. For example, in a scene in the middle of the film the �North Side� gang shoots up a restaurant trying to kill Camonte. There are innocent bystanders shot and probably some killed, but because this is a passing scene and the\n\nbystander�s injuries were not central to the plot of the movie, the audience gets no sense that what had just occurred was a senseless tragedy. In fact, the point of the scene is to introduce Camonte to the machine gun, which he later uses to kill even more people.\n\nThis movie was rife with action, killings, fast cars, gangsters that have no respect for authority, implied corruption from figures in authority, women in what was considered skimpy clothing in the 1930�s, easy money and booze. Of course the gangster character that gets what he wants when he wants it would have been attractive to youth in the 1930�s and was definietely glorified in this film. Kids who saw this movie probably discounted Camonte�s death in the end as just a foolish mistake he�d made. Either Camonte was too greedy, or too thoughtless which was what got him in the end. Kids probably thought Camonte would have escaped his fate if he�d just done one or two things differently.\n\nTahereh S:\n\nFilled with what was at the time extreme violent crime drama, Howard Hawkes� film Scarface: The Shame of the Nation caused so much controversy that it�s original release date of 1930 was pushed back for two years so that enough changes could be done to it before finally debuting in 1932. The film was thought to exalt gangster life in an excessive manner and that the main character, Tony Camonte, played by Paul Mauni openly insulted the work and authority of law enforcement, ridiculing them.\n\nTony Camonte is the stereotypical tough guy. He�s a macho man who loves guns, violence, women and smart-alecking cops. He�s sure of himself at all times and innately believes that anything he wants he will get, including power, prestige and women. As viewers, we get the image that Tony is right, he does get whatever he wants. He�s moved up in the gangster world and is the right hand man of Johnny Lovo, the head of the south side gang. No other gangster dares to question Tony�s authority, no matter how much he threatens or intimidates them. And though originally he is ignored and ridiculed in a distained way by Poppy, the lead female character of the film, she later begins to warm up to him and becomes attracted to his tough guy attitude and love for violence.\n\nDespite the fact that Tony is a gangster, as a movie watcher, you still find yourself rooting for him through out the film. You want him to get the girl. You�re happy for him when he starts raking in the dough and you cheer for him when he finally takes the big step and goes to the North side, killing O�hara and at last disregarding Lovo�s command.\n\nI never found myself on Lovo�s side when I was watching the movie, even at times finding him annoying because he seemed like such a wimp compared to Tony and I didn�t like the way he would hold Tony back from fulfilling his potential as a gangster. I also never really rooted for the cops either and found myself viewing them the same way Tony viewed them, as rude pesky people you just had to deal with. The police aren�t depicted as nice and friendly people. On the contrary, they seem to have temper tantrums and are unable to control their anger, getting ticked off at the slightest comments. Beginning with the first scene they give off an aggressive and almost militant vibe. It is for these reasons that I don�t necessarily think that the film glorifies gangster life per say, but it does glorify Tony who IS a gangster.\n\nBecause this film, like so many other films has a high amount of violence in it, the idea of censorship and how much should be taken out or revised in films was and still is an important concept in many peoples minds. My answer to them is this, in a society in which free speech and free will takes a prominent place in everyone�s life, it�s up to a person to learn and educate themselves and to be able to make decisions on what they think is appropriate for themselves to view and what is not. And when it comes to children it is a parent�s responsibility to control what they want their children to be exposed to and what not to be exposed to. A child who knows no better would think that the life Tony has as a �pretty cool� life to live. It�s up to parents to watch over their children and help them interpret what they learn from society in the correct manner.\n\nKalie S:\n\nHoward Hawk�s Scarface is a gangster movie that includes controversial themes such as the negative roles in a family and violence while still including humor in a conservative and censored time. Though the film was revised in accordance to the Hayes office�s censorship standards it is still able to portray its controversial themes through subtle innuendo and body language. The looks that characters give each other and their actions such as Tony Camonte�s interaction with his sister, Cesca, in the hallway and his jealous manner are still present but not in an out right way that offended censors. I believe that this is the greatest characteristic of the film. By relying on subtle and understood meaning it allows the audience to watch a gangster movie but not feel negatively about it.\n\nBy including comedic characters and actions into scenes that contain violence Hawk keeps the film light hearted but still able to show the hard side of gangsters killing and forcing people to do what they want. One of the comedic characters in the film is Tony�s secretary, Angelo, who plays a significant role in maintaining the humor through out the movie. Angelo�s lack of common sense creates humor in violent scenes such as the shooting at the restaurant. By focusing on Angelo attempting to get a message from someone while the restaurant is being shot up, the audience is able to view a violent scene but not focus solely on the violence occurring but rather laugh at Angelo�s actions. Additionally Tony�s character adds an element of humor in the film. Though it is unclear whether or not Tony is playing dumb or is actually that dumb, Hawk turns his lack of intelligence into a likeable quality that allows the audience to laugh at him or with him rather than out right hate him for his violent and un-respectful nature. In reality a man that has no respect for authority such as Tony and is responsible for multiple killings would be a shunned man but I believe that Tony�s playful nature leaves me liking him rather than hating him. In a way this allows for a slight glorification of violence by incorporating humor to keep the film amusing, but I do not believe that the violence in the movie is presented in the way that it should have a negative effect on society. Though I am able to see how the film would be controversial in its time for its negative themes I believe that it is more entertaining than it is able to negatively impact the morale character of members of society.\n\nBrittney W:\n\nThe film Scarface, directed by Howard Hawks, is notorious for portraying a time in the 1930s when gangsters held power. They maintained their power and authority in the city by controlling the selling of beer. Breaking laws and proving who was more powerful became an unconventional way of life for the gangsters. In the film, Scarface, Howard Hawks specifically depicts the events that occur after one gang leader, Luis Costillo, is murdered in order for John Lovo to take control. When initially released, this film created a great stir amongst critics as possibly promoting violence. Censorship had its way with the film and several changes were made in order to appease sensitive viewers. However, I believe that this film does promote violence through the repeated emphasis on power and how the gangsters achieved that power with violence as well as through the character traits of the main character, Tony Comante.\n\nThroughout the entire film, attaining money is shown to be the most important goal for anyone to have. All morals are thrown out the window in order to attain money and power. This includes killing others in order to advance. The viewers see Tony gradually win over the woman he has his eyes on as his wealth increases. As the plot progresses, Poppy seemingly falls in love with Tony. With his carefree confidence and arrogant actions, Tony covers for his lack of intelligence. After all, with his willingness to kill anyone that gets in his way, he must deserve to be on top with ultimate power, wealth, and the girl of his dreams.\n\nThis idea that Tony is advancing in the world regardless of laws and ethics, is further emphasized in a pinnacle scene in which gangsters from the North Side attack a restaurant in which Tony and Poppy are eating in order to send a message. As there is mass chaos behind the main actors including bullet holes displayed throughout the building, women screaming, and a man struggling to help the bar tender get help for his wounds, Tony and his gang appear wildly excited as they rush to make plans to retaliate.\n\nSome may argue that all of what I have stated above is necessary to show what truly happened when the government turned their back on what was taking place during this time. Yet, I believe that the consequences of the actions of the gangsters should have been further shown. The film is merely portrayed from the gangsters� perspectives as an exciting lifestyle. By taking away the realistic costs of the gangsters� dealings, the possibility is there for the viewer to believe the film to be glorifying violence.\n\nCynthia W:\n\nWatching Howard Hawks� Scarface was initially uncomfortable for me, as I am not one of those people who particularly enjoy violent, �shoot-them-up� movies. I was not as hesitant as I usually am when it comes seeing action films these days because in today�s world, Hollywood is very creative and not very restrained in showing blood and gore in its films. I was still a little surprised at the violence, albeit without a lot of blood, that was present in the 1937 version of Scarface. While I do not agree, necessarily, that Scarface glamorizes gangsters and violence per se, I definitely think that there is a slight Hollywood spin on Tony Camonte�s character and life. He wins over the girl all too easily, and his immediate and blatant defiance of the new boss is somewhat unbelievable. He�s extremely likeable despite his extremely arrogant attitude, which seems a little too unlikely to be a true gangster characteristic. He and his crew manage to avoid a couple of likely death situations, which also seem to be a little unrealistic.\n\nThe caption before the movie started said, essentially, that this film was to make the U.S. government aware of the brutality and strength of gang activity in the U.S. and to force them to do something about it. I can see that in the film. The lack of police presence in the movie, and the technicalities from corrupt officials that get Camonte out of the slammer are prime examples. I think that symbolism is much more prevalent than the glamorizing of Gangster life, which really isn�t existent in the film. Yes, the gangsters do seem to have money and power and seem to be living �the good life� but that is semi-realistic and also the betrayals, random slayings, and death threats are very real. So, based on the first hour of the film, I would say that Scarface does not glamorize gangster life or violence.\n\n:"
