When Sir Clive Sinclair sold off his computer business last week, it had to be the most widely followed $7 million corporate transaction in British history.

The announcement last Monday received extensive coverage on television news programs that evening, and the story was at the top of the front pages of most London newspapers the next morning. A headline in The Times of London said: ''Sinclair computer sale ends an era.''

For Sir Clive, the inventor who developed the pocket calculator and some popular home computers, the sale effectively ends his efforts to head a business. He will now concentrate on doing contract research for other companies and generating product ideas.

Sir Clive's business career has been marked by irony and contradiction. Though Britain's best-known entrepreneur, he displayed some of the traditional British aversion for business. He repeatedly said he regarded himself as an inventor, not a businessman. For him, inventing was the noble purpose; selling was a necessary expedient.

Still, in a country tired of reminders of its industrial decline, Sir Clive became a national celebrity and a symbol of economic optimism. His company, Sinclair Research Ltd., was for a while a high-flier on the London stock market.

In 1983, Sir Clive was knighted for his accomplishments and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher often pointed to him as the kind of entrepreneur who was showing the way toward a prosperous high-technology future.
