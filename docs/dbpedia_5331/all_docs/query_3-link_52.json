        "text": "Sinclair Group has opened a new dealership in Swansea which is the first in the 30-site dealer group to feature a drive-in service reception complete with technology to automatically assess bodywork condition and tyre tread depth.\n\nThe Sinclair Jaguar Land Rover dealership, now just off the M4 motorway at Riverside Business Park and two miles from its previous home on Swansea Enterprise Park, has capacity to display 12 new vehicles from the Range Rover, Defender, Discovery and Jaguar JLR 'house of brands', plus 380 parking and car display spaces outside, and an 18-bay workshop.\n\nAmongst the facilities at the multi-million pound investment are a personalisation suite where clients can view the various options available on their new luxury car to help visualise it and bring it to life, two handover areas, a barista-style coffee bar and areas for customers to work or relax.\n\nAndy Sinclair, Sinclair Group managing director, said: \"This is a flagship retail facility that is undoubtedly one of the finest of its kind in the UK and we're so grateful to all involved in creating such a magnificent premises.\n\n\"State-of-the-art and second-to-none in every respect, it is a development that will not fail to impress visitors and enables us to enhance our service offering to even greater heights, delivering an unrivalled experience, befitting of the Jaguar Land Rover brands.”\n\nIts forecourt and parking area includes 24 spaces for charging plug-in vehicles, and it has solar panels on the roof.\n\nNicky Boyce, head of franchise for Sinclair Jaguar Land Rover, which includes Swansea and its sister sites in Aberystwyth, Hay On Wye and Ludlow, said: \"Every time I visited the site during its construction, I was blown away by the progress and to see its transformation has been remarkable.\n\n\"Our Swansea team has done an amazing job in driving the business forward since our acquisition in 2018 and they can now come to work every day in a premises that is the epitome of modern luxury which they can be proud of.”\n\nThe dealership will be run by Jamie Callan, Sinclair Jaguar Land Rover Swansea’s head of business, who oversees a 68-strong team that has been bolstered with 22 new staff ahead of moving in."
