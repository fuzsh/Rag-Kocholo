        "text": "Nebraska stakes its claim as the crown jewel of the bioeconomy intending to turn golden fields of corn into almost anything, including a new facility that could be worth billions.\n\n“It's absolutely gigantic, it's a game changer,” Gov. Jim Pillen said.\n\nPillen said the $5 billion plant announced for Phelps County could be the single biggest investment in state history.\n\nAgriculture is the backbone of Nebraska and while her husband grows corn, Kelsey Bergen grows the economy.\n\n“Joining our two biggest resources, agriculture and empowering it with economic development sector to set us up for success in the future,” she said.\n\nThe two sectors unite at the Governor's Summit. It's the latest in Pillen’s effort to turn farm products into the building blocks of the economy.\n\n“Bioeconomy, feeding off last 25 years in ethanol,” Pillen said. “As I say we used to make with carbon below ground now carbon above ground.\n\nCurrent biofuel plants like the one in Trenton have created new markets for corn and created jobs.\n\n“Ethanol is a true rural American success story, revitalizing communities for decades, we've kept schools alive,” said Tony Leiding of Trenton Agri Products.\n\nThe governor tells local leaders he wants action, addressing the issues that could hold growth back.\n\n“We need workers that have a place to live and a safe place for kids to be while they're at work,” Bergen said.\n\nThe governor also sets his sights on the brain drain.\n\n“We have to compete to keep our best and brightest here we have to scholarship, room and board, tuition, $10,000 stipends like our neighbors do. We have to wake up and compete hard,” Pillen said.\n\nThe governor believes Nebraska has a strong story to tell - at the epicenter of both beef and corn with farmers growing more sustainable. But he tells his crowd it's time to get moving."
