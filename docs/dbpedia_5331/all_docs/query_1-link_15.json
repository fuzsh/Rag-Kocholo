Ratings may be subject to change.\n\nPortfolio Positioning as of 6/30/2024\n\nWe decreased the portfolio’s exposure within investment grade corporate bonds over the quarter, taking profits on positions that have performed well and were trading at tight spreads.\n\nWe increased exposure to short term high yield corporate bonds over the period given our expectations for strong nominal growth and positive real growth in the near term.\n\nThe portfolio’s CLO allocation is composed of highly rated securities with short average lives and low spread volatility.\n\nHigher-rated ABS was the portfolio’s largest increase over the quarter given compelling relative value. Using investment grade corporates as a funding source, we’ve reallocated to higher quality ABS, where excess issuance has led to attractive risk adjusted spreads, enabling the portfolio to move up in quality without sacrificing carry.\n\nWhile we are comfortable with our commercial real estate portfolio and find compelling value within the asset class, we remain cautious and have continued to reduce the portfolio’s exposure given the wide range of possible outcomes.\n\nPortfolio Details as of 07/31/2024\n\nTotal Net Assets\n\n$42.44 B\n\nAverage Effective Duration\n\n1.74 Years\n\nAverage Life\n\n2.08 Years\n\nAverage Maturity\n\n2.09 Years\n\nNumber of Issues\n\n1128\n\nAverage Yield to Maturity\n\n5.74%\n\nTo view definitions for the above Portfolio Details, Click here.\n\nYield to maturity (YTM) represents the expected total return on a bond (expressed as an annualized rate) based on the bond’s expected future cash flows, including coupon payments over the life of the bond and the bond’s principal value received at maturity.\n\nAverage Life - Measures how long it will take, on average, to receive the repayment of the principal amount on a debt security. Average life is often used in connection with mortgage-backed securities as a measurement of the length of time, on average, before the underlying mortgages are paid, refinanced, or otherwise retired.\n\nAverage Effective Duration - The change in the value of a fixed income security that will result from a 1% change in interest rates, taking into account anticipated cash flow fluctuations from mortgage prepayments, puts, adjustable coupons, and potential call dates. Duration is expressed as a number of years, and generally, the larger a duration, the greater the interest-rate risk or reward for a portfolio’s underlying bond prices. Where applicable, certain investments, such as common or preferred stock, convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock, ETFs, ADRs, and CPI swaps and related futures, are excluded from these calculations.\n\nHolding Coupon Maturity Assets\n\nUnited States Treasury Inflation Indexed Bonds 0.250% 01/15/2025 0.8% United States Treasury Note/Bond 5.000% 09/30/2025 0.8% United States Treasury
