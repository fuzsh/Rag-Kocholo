        "text": "An alligator was spotted swimming in Lake Erie.\n\nbeachgoers in Erie, Pennsylvania spotted an alligator Sunday, near the East Avenue Boat Launch. Per the outlet, several individuals claimed to have seen a four-to five-foot-long alligator, with eyewitnesses contacting authorities, who then passed the information along to the Erie Port Authority.\n\n\"We’ve been very diligent in making sure to keep an eye on the water and of course on the land. We’ve not had a sighting since then. We have a team in place that is just monitoring our entire footprint and of course, on the water, just to make sure everyone is safe,” Erie Port Authority Executive Director Julie Slomski told WJW.\n\nSlomski said the port authority is working with trappers and are in contact with professionals in the south that have experience with alligators. WJW reported that signs have been erected in the area that warns that an alligator has been spotted in the lake, and that beachgoers should exercise caution.\n\nReptile experts at the Erie Zoo told WJW they don't believe the alligator would survive the Erie winter and hope that it will be captured soon.\n\n\"They do go into a hibernation sort of thing called brumation where they won’t eat quite as much during the winter and their bodies will slow down because they’re cold-blooded versus us and other mammals that are warm-blooded. They need the sun, they need the heat to be able to metabolize anything that they do eat,” Darren Julius, a reptile keeper at the Erie Zoo, told WJW.\n\nJulius told the outlet that due to the alligator's size, it's likely around two to four years old, which he said means it'll primarily feed on tadpoles, frogs, fish or smaller mammals.\n\nAccording to the station, it is believed that the alligator was an exotic pet that somehow found its way into the lake.\n\n“It’s definitely more scared of you than you are of it, so it’ll probably just swim away from you anytime you’re within like 10 feet of it. It’s not really going to come after you,” Julius told WJW.\n\nWhen speaking to WJW, Port Authority officials confirmed it will monitor the area.\n\n“Again, the concern is if somebody just released it in the bay like what we’re hearing happened, it’s disappointing because again, it puts many people in danger along with the gator itself,” Slomski told the outlet.\n\nAnyone who spots the alligator can call 814-455-7557 extension 223."
