        "text": "Andy Sinclair has been appointed the new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Winger Motors Auckland.\n\nThe new head honcho has long been associated with the local automotive industry, having started his career as the Franchise Owner/Director of Pit Stop, before moving into the Consulting Sales Director of Braders Car Court in Masterton, and later becoming the General Manager of Majestic Motors.\n\nHowever, Sinclar’s shift to Winger Motors comes after he wrapped up a 14-year tenure at Hyundai New Zealand where he started out as the company’s National Sales Manager. He then held the role of General Manager for just under ten years before becoming CEO.\n\nHis new digs at Winger Motors will see him assume responsibility for six locations across Auckland, including a new customer service centre in Penrose which has been set up specifically to service vehicles, including tyre and wheel repairs, windscreen repair and replacement, oil changes, Warrant of Fitness (WOF) inspections, and more.\n\nThe dealership chain will also welcome two new brands to its flanks this year, those being Omoda and its sibling Jaecoo, both of which can be found at its North Shore, East Auckland, and Pukekohe sites.\n\nPricing for Omoda’s range of petrol-powered and electric vehicles has yet to be announced for New Zealand, but the Chinese brand has promised all models will be offered with a seven-year/unlimited-kilometre warranty.\n\nSinclair began his role as the CEO of Winger Motors Auckland in January 2024."
