        "text": "Barbados’ high debt burden had stifled the country’s efforts to invest in essential conservation and climate change adaptation activities that would allow its nature-based economy to thrive.\n\nThrough a new co-guarantee structure, TNC worked alongside the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), to enable Barbados to complete a debt conversion that will facilitate the expansion of the country’s marine protected areas—from virtually zero to approximately 30%. The project is expected to free up approximately $50 million to support environmental and sustainable development actions in Barbados over the next 15 years, making both the country and the livelihoods of its people more resilient in the face of climate change.\n\nContribution to TNC’s 2030 Goals\n\nOcean conservation, biodiversity protection, and support of local stewards\n\nRead more details about the project in TNC’s official press release.\n\nLearn more in the Barbados Blue Bonds for Ocean Conservation Case Study\n\nTNC worked with RRG Capital Management LLC (“RRG”)—an experienced investment and asset management firm focused on sustainable, innovative approaches to agriculture, water, and renewable energy—to create a new model for investing.\n\nThe result is the $900+ million Sustainable Water Impact Fund (“SWIF” or the “Fund”), which closed in April 2020. SWIF’s strategy is to acquire land and water assets, improve the management of farms and water sources, and ultimately address the needs of people and nature.\n\nMultiple projects to date demonstrate how water and land can be managed to better meet the needs of both people and nature.\n\nContribution to TNC’s 2030 Goals\n\nLand conservation, clean water and biodiversity protection and support of local stewards\n\nFor updates on impact and progress, see the latest SWIF Impact Report.\n\nWorking with Belize, TNC arranged an innovative financial structure that allowed the country to address its marine conservation and debt challenges simultaneously.\n\nThe resulting $364 million debt conversion for marine conservation enabled Belize to repurchase its debt at a significant discount and then to direct a portion of the savings into marine conservation, with a commitment to protect 30% of its ocean.\n\nThe Blue Bonds in Belize transaction won two Environmental Finance Bond Awards: the 2022 Grunin Prize for Social Entrepreneurship and the 2022 IFLR Editor’s Choice and Deal of the Year Award (Debt and Equity Linked).\n\nContribution to TNC’s 2030 Goals\n\nOcean conservation, biodiversity protection, and support of local stewards\n\nDownload the Belize Blue Bonds for Ocean Conservation Case Study to learn more about the award-winning transaction.\n\nTNC and TIG joined forces in 2021 to advance the potential of sustainably managed forests across the U.S. to address the twin crises of biodiversity loss and climate change.\n\nThrough a first-of-its-kind agreement, the initiative has the potential to sequester millions of tons of CO2e and set a new industry benchmark for forestry management. The collaboration will also seek options to provide outdoor recreation and development opportunities to benefit rural communities.\n\nContribution to TNC’s 2030 Goals\n\nCarbon sequestration, land conservation, and biodiversity protection\n\nLearn more about TIG and how this collaboration can set a new standard for working forests on P12 of NatureVest’s 2022 Impact Report.\n\nFrom a conservation perspective, wind power projects can present siting challenges and may introduce new impacts to wildlife, such as bird strikes with wind turbines. But, those same projects often secure long-term power purchase agreements, leading to predictable revenue streams—funding that can be utilized to support conservation.\n\nOne such project is the Kipeto wind farm project, 45 kilometers outside Nairobi. Working with the project’s owners, TNC designed an investment structure that provides a $10 million loan with a commitment from the project to make conservation payments totaling $500,000 per year for offsite mitigation. The use of the conservation payments is governed by an independent committee comprising TNC and several other leading local and international non-profits.\n\nBiodiversity conservation in the Kipeto Wind Farm area includes protecting vultures and other birds of prey. The project also benefits local communities by providing clean energy, which is essential for economic development.\n\nContribution to TNC’s 2030 Goals\n\nBiodiversity protection and support of local stewards\n\nTo learn how tagging is helping to safeguard Kenya’s critically endangered vultures and what that means for the local ecosystem, check out P17 of the 2022 NatureVest Impact Report."
