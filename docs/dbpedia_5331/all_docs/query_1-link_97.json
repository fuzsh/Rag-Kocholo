I thank the CHP and our law enforcement partners for their ongoing work to take down organized criminal activity and secure justice for this community. We remain committed to working in Bakersfield and across the state to further reduce criminal activity and make our neighborhoods safer,\" stated Gov. Newsom.\n\nRELATED:\n\n“The California Highway Patrol has a great working relationship with the Kern County Sheriff’s Office, and we are thrilled to welcome them to our ongoing crime suppression operation with the Bakersfield Police Department,” stated CHP Commissioner Sean Duryee.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom between CHP and the Bakersfield Police Department.

In April, Governor Newsom launched a coordinated enforcement effort in Bakersfield to continue improving public safety, address roadway violence, and stop criminal activity. Through a state and city partnership, the CHP saturates high-crime areas of mutual interest, aiming to reduce roadway violence and criminal activity in the area, specifically vehicle theft and organized retail crime,\" said Newsom in a statement.\n\nGov.

Together, we can more effectively address and combat crime, ensuring a more secure environment for everyone.”\n\nHis office said the statewide grant program is the largest single investment to combat organized retail crime in state history.\n\nOfficials said to support efforts in the area, a deputy from KCSO has been assigned to the Kern County Auto Theft Task Force, and a CHP officer will join the Kern County High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Task Force."
