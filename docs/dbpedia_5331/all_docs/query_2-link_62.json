        "text": "Statement by the directors in performance of their statutory duties in accordance with s172(1) Companies Act 2006\n\nThe board of directors of Sinclair Motor Holdings Limited consider that they have acted in the way they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole (having regard to the stakeholders and matters set out in s172(1)(a)-(f) of the Act) in the decisions taken during the year ended 31 December 2019.\n\nThe Sinclair group was started by Bill Sinclair in 1945 and the company continues to be controlled and run by the Sinclair family. We’re proud of the ways in which the company has provided employment, training and financial reward for its owners and employees for over 70 years. We are the largest and most successful motor group in Wales, representing some of the most prestigious automotive brands. In a highly competitive market, we aim to stand out from our competitors by virtue of quality, reliability and the great customer care that our reputation is built upon.\n\nWe make strategic decisions based on long-term objectives. In particular, this has meant significant investment in premises and people in the business. This investment is to continue in the future to provide customers with state-of- the-art facilities and the very finest expertise. We acknowledge that, in order to progress to the next phase in the company’s future, it is likely that we will continue to expand our existing businesses and add to the prestige brand portfolio that we have. We continue to explore possibilities along these lines. Our aim continues to be to maximise the company’s ability to grow profits to fund continued investment for the future of the business and job security for the employees.\n\nOur Employees\n\nWe rely on the hard work, commitment and enthusiasm of our staff which is fundamental to the delivery of our plan. We aim to be a responsible employer in our approach to the pay and benefits our team members receive. We provide comprehensive training and career development support. The health, safety and well-being of our employees is one of our primary considerations in the way we do business.\n\nOur suppliers and customers\n\nWe meet with our manufacturing partners regularly throughout the year and take the appropriate action to prevent involvement in modern slavery, corruption, bribery and breaches of competition law. Our business model prioritises quality and customer satisfaction. We have built and will maintain a reputation for transparency and fair dealing with customers and suppliers\n\nOur Community and the Environment\n\nWe are a family-run company with roots in South Wales and have invested in our community through our charity donation scheme. From sponsoring sports kit of local children’s clubs, to having employees play and arrange charitable football matches. Our plan takes into account the impact of the Group’s operations on the community and environment and our wider social responsibilities, and in particular how we comply with environmental legislation and pursue waste-saving opportunities and react promptly to local community concerns.\n\nBusiness conduct and Corporate Governance\n\nAs the Board of Directors, our intention is to behave responsibly and ensure that the management operate the business in a responsible manner, operating within the high standards of business conduct and good governance expected for a business such as ours and in doing so, will contribute to the delivery of our plan. The intention is to nurture our reputation, through both the construction and delivery of our plan, that reflects our responsible behaviour. As the Board of Directors, our intention is to behave responsibly towards our shareholders and treat them fairly and equally, so they too may benefit from the successful delivery of our plan."
