        "text": "Bob Sinclair, the American marketing executive who pushed Saab to design more-luxurious cars and created one of the Swedish automaker’s most iconic vehicles--the 900 Convertible--died on May 10 at his home in Santa Barbara, Calif., after a three-year battle with cancer. He was 77 years old.\n\nIn the 33-year span that ended in 1991, Sinclair worked for either of Sweden’s automakers--Saab or Volvo--in the United States. Sinclair started with Saab in1958 as a field representative and worked his way up through the marketing ranks. But he jumped to Volvo in 1961, unhappy with Saab’s plan to move its U.S. headquarters to Connecticut. Sinclair returned to Saab in 1979 to lead the U.S. operation, Saab-Scania of America.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Sinclair was pushing Saab to add more content and luxury to its cars so that he could move the brand upmarket in the United States and boost profits. But Saab execs in Sweden were focused on building more-affordable cars.\n\nIt was a clash of those goals that provided the spark for the 900 Convertible. As recounted in an AutoWeek article in 2006, Saab pushed Sinclair to take 1,000 units a year of the two-door 900. Sinclair could equip the cars as he wanted--and his list of demands included a convertible top. (Read the story at www.autoweek.com/article/20060612/FREE/60605007.)\n\nThe Saab 900 Convertible prototype in 1983.\n\nWorking with the American Sunroof Co., Sinclair had a 900 Convertible concept created and the car was unveiled at the 1983 Frankfurt motor show. It was an instant hit, at a time when many automakers had abandoned building convertibles. Production of the 900 Convertible started in early 1986.\n\nSinclair also dressed up 900s with the high-performance Special Performance Group (SPG) package and was a driving force behind the Saab 9000 model. He retired from Saab in 1991.\n\nSinclair was enamored with motorcycles and a noted collector of vintage two-wheelers. In retirement, he and his wife, Anne, moved to California. Sinclair served as a board member for McLaren Performance Technologies and Catalytic Solutions Inc. He also was a fixture at Saab owner conventions.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Sinclair is survived by six children. Memorial information will be released soon."
