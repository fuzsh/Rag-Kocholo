        "text": "The Arkansas Commission on Child Abuse, Rape, and Domestic Violence awarded over $630,000 in grants to 11 organizations for projects working to prevent child abuse and neglect.\n\nOne of those organizations is Community Connections in Conway. Executive Director Courtney Leach tells KATV that children with intellectual disabilities are more vulnerable for child abuse, which is why the grant is needed.\n\nView the full interview from Little Rock ARC below:\n\nThe grant added a position for a Child Abuse Coordinator. Anna Valenzuela was named to the position, and she’s no new face to Community Connections. Her journey started as a parent.\n\n“The program has built me up as a person, as just a mom,” Valenzuela says.\n\nCommunity Connection in action means quality, extracurricular activities for children and young adults with intellectual disabilities and special needs, and for parents like Valenzuela and Leach, the nonprofit is dear to their hearts.\n\n“So, I have been around for a while. I have a son who was born with a chromosome deletion and has autism. He’s 17. But, I have had the privilege of watching our programs grow and meet so many different families,” Leach says.\n\nAside from extracurriculars, one of their growing needs is in supporting families, and that’s where the grant comes in.\n\n“So, this grant that is helping with child abuse prevention is going to help this very special population of kids with special needs in our education, for our program directors and our volunteers and our families on what we can do to help prevent the stresses that end up leading to child abuse,” she says.\n\nLeach describes the need, saying their service includes respite care, parent support groups and mentorship all around the state.\n\n“We have kids that are nonverbal, we have kids that have low intellectual disabilities, we serve a lot of kids in all backgrounds. But often, they’re more susceptible and vulnerable to abuse, letting them know what to look for and what they can do to prevent putting their kids in those positions is going to be huge. We feel like it will make a big impact on a vulnerable population in our state,” she says.\n\nThe future of Community Connections is expected to include education for staff on child abuse and neglect, and expanded services."
