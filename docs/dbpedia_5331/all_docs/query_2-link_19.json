        "text": "Sprouts Farmers Market named Jack Sinclair its new CEO and board member, effective June 24, 2019. The grocer has been conducting a search for a new CEO since Amin Maredia stepped down from the position on Dec. 30, 2018.\n\nThe company also announced that Brad Lukow, interim co-CEO and CFO has resigned. Lawrence âChipâ Malloy will serve as interim CFO until a permanent successor can be found.\n\nâWe are extremely excited to have Jack Sinclair as our new chief executive officer following a thorough search and selection process by the board of directors,â said Joseph Fortunato, chairman of the board of Sprouts Farmers Market. âJack is a proven chief executive officer with an outstanding track record in grocery and retail merchandising. On behalf of the board, we look forward to working with Jack as he leads Sprouts forward to continued success.â\n\nSinclair has 35 years of experience in grocery and retail, previously serving as CEO of 99 Cents Only Stores. He also previously was EVP of the U.S. grocery division for Walmart, where he led all aspects of the mass retailerâs grocery business and was instrumental in the divisionâs growth through a focus on local assortment and fresh foods. Before that, he spent 14 years with Safeway PLC in London.\n\nâI am humbled and extremely privileged to be appointed chief executive officer of Sprouts Farmers Market,â said Sinclair. âSprouts is a company with a higher purpose â to empower every person to eat healthier and live a better life â and the commitment of its 30,000 team members to drive lasting change in the communities they serve truly resonates with me. I look forward to working with Sproutsâ board of directors, leadership team and all Sprouts team members to continue furthering that purpose.â\n\nThe natural and organic grocer also announced that Shon Boney will step down from the board. Boney is a founder of the company and has been a board member since 2002."
