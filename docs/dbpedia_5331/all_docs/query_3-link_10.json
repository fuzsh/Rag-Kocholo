        "text": "In recent years, Sinclair Research Limited has exploited its technology through companies formed with investors. These ventures include Anamartic Limited, the first and only company in the world to produce products incorporating wafer scale integration (WSI), Shaye Communications Limited, one of the leaders in the CT-2 telephone field, Cambridge Computer Limited, making laptop computers and satellite receivers and Symbolkit Limited, through its licence granted to P.G.C Limited, which is developing the ultra fast computer processors.\n\nAnamartic Limited has recently and successfully started to sell finished products to the computer manufacturing industry. These have proved highly reliable and cost effective. The need for further capital will probably lead to dilution in our shareholding.\n\nShaye Communications Limited are selling their original CT-2 phone in several countries and have reached a turnover of around £5 million pet annum. The development of a second generation machine conforming to the common air interface (the new standard) is well advanced and should lead to a considerable growth of business.\n\nDuring the year we sold the majority of our interest in Cambridge Computer Limited to S.C.l. for a nominal amount in return for a royalty stream on the satellite receivers. This was a disappointing result of our inability to raise the capital needed for the Company at a difficult time in the market.\n\nP.G.C. Limited continues to develop its very high speed computer chip and has received an injection of capital from outside investors. Progress is very promising.\n\nThe main project within Sinclair Research Limited is a pedal bicycle dramatically lighter than any previously made. This uses lightweight composite materials to the almost complete exclusion of steel. Development is well advanced and tooling will commence soon. We intend to launch the bike in 1992.\n\nLast year we made a reasonable profit but this is unlikely to be repeated in the current year as the bike project absorbs funds. The longer term prospects remain good.\n\nOver the past year your company has developed and tooled a radical electric bike called the Zike. This has cost £500,000 paid for partly by the sale of our remaining shares in Shaye Communications and partly by borrowings totalling £200,000. Production is due to start in late June at the works of our subcontractor Tudor Webasto in Birmingham.\n\nThere have been many electric bikes over the years but these have all weighed upwards of 35 kg making them most \"unbike\" like. The Zike weighs just 11 kg or about the same as an ordinary racing bike. This is a result of a new motor, electronics, battery and complete frame as the enclosed leaflet explains. If you would like to order one you are entitled to a £50 discount as a shareholder. The leaflet contains an order form.\n\nIt is too early of course to know the success of the Zike but all the early indications are encouraging. Over 2,000 members of the public rode prototypes at the Cyclex exhibition in March and were clearly impressed. 300 orders have been placed by members of the public who requested leaflets. Over 200 foreign companies have approached us for agencies and many sample orders have been placed.\n\nOur company is now focused on the Zike electric bike. This is tooled and in production with around 1,200 sold so far but two problems have arisen which, at the time of writing, have much inhibited the rate of sales which had been rising steadily. Some batteries were found to have corroded which caused us to recall Zikes, though only 1% were affected. This was not a design fault and is so far unexplained. Also Tudor Webasto who have made the Zike so far have decided to cease as they need the factory space for expansion of their core business.\n\nWe are talking to several companies interested in taking over from Tudor Webasto and we are developing new models but no reliable forecasts can yet be made.\n\nSince the company year end Zike sales have continued favourably and this product now represents positive cash flow.\n\nWe have concluded an agreement with MTI Inc in Seattle whereby we licence them to sell a computer chip we developed with an associated company. This looks highly promising, we have received a first payment of £100,000, but it is too early to make predictions.\n\nOn the 28th April 1994 we launched a new product called ZETA. This is a bolt on unit which converts any bicycle to electric power. At the time of writing, 18th May, we have sold over 1,000 units by mail order at £144.95 each. Clearly the prospects look excellent."
