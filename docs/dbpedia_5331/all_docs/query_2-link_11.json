        "text": "From its humble beginnings, the Sinclair Group has grown into a genuine driving force but it remains a company with family values very much at its heart.\n\nThe business began in 1945 in Port Talbot, where mechanic Bill Sinclair returned from the war to be reunited with his family and started to repair cars on the site of a former sawmill.\n\nJUST LIKE OUR CARS,\n\nWE'RE BUILT TO LAST...\n\nOver the years, car sales were added to the operation and Bill's son, Gerald, joined the firm as its reputation for quality, service and value grew.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the Audi franchise was secured in Port Talbot and this was quickly followed by the addition of Volkswagen sales too as Sinclair Garages expanded into Swansea, Bridgend and then Neyland in 1985.\n\nMercedes-Benz was added to the Sinclair portfolio in 1990, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles in 1998, smart in 2002, Škoda in 2009, SEAT in 2012 and more recently the acquisition of both Land Rover and Jaguar as the company increased its offering with some of the leading motoring marques.\n\nThroughout the years, the Sinclair Group has invested in its premises and its people to provide customers with state-of- the-art facilities and the very finest expertise for whichever brand that they’re interested in.\n\n\" I AM IMMENSELY PROUD OF WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED BY THIS COMPANY. THE BUSINESS COULD NEVER BE WHERE IT IS TODAY WITHOUT THE HARD WORK, COMMITMENT AND ENTHUSIASM OF THE TEAMS IN EACH OF OUR RETAIL OUTLETS AS WELL AS THE INCREDIBLE LOYALTY OF THE CUSTOMERS WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE ARE HONOURED TO SERVE.\"\n\nGERALD SINCLAIR\n\nWe have evolved beyond all recognition over the years but we certainly haven't lost sight of our drive to deliver outstanding service to our valued customers at all times, which is something we will steadfastly provide as the Company continues to grow and enjoys future success.\n\nSo whether you’re looking for a new or quality used car, require expert assistance with the maintenance, servicing or repair of an existing vehicle or seeking genuine manufacturer parts and accessories, you’ve certainly come to the right place by calling upon the Sinclair Group."
