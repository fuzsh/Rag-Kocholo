        "text": "After they bought their Eichler home in 1997, Bryan and his wife, Jo-Anne, wanted to eliminate combustion inside their house (the source of most toxic air pollutants). They removed the fireplace and went fully electric, eliminating the need for any gas inside their home. In addition to using all-electric appliances, they installed a heat pump water heater and hydronic heating/cooling system which uses tubes in the floor to keep every room in their house at the perfect temperature. To further reduce their use of fossil fuels, they bought electric vehicles and installed car chargers and wall-mount batteries. Finally, to offset the increase in electricity consumption, they invested in rooftop solar panels.\n\n“We moved to an all-electric system, eliminated natural gas inside our home, generated electricity on site, and switched to all-electric vehicles. We are doing our part to directly reduce the release of greenhouse gas. And with SVCE providing carbon-free electricity, we are confident that our living and transportation requirements are minimizing carbon emissions to the greatest extent possible.”"
