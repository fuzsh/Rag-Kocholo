        "text": "My #1 business goal: I want L&K to be a company my kids would be stoked to join. Yeah, I know. It's not exactly \"maximise shareholder value\" or \"disrupt the industry.\" Sue me. But it’s honest. Look, yesterday my girls spent hours building a mud kitchen in the backyard. We’re talking a proper gourmet mud restaurant—full menu, daily specials, the works. Even had a candle on the table (don't ask where they found it). Three mud-soaked Michelin stars, easy. Watching them, I realised two things: My kids are way more entrepreneurial than me. And I need to step up. Why? Because I’m building L&K to be me. All me. Because honestly? I suck at faking it. I’m over writing bland posts about “top 10 marketing hacks” or whatever's hot on LinkedIn. It's like... you know when you're a kid and you try on your parent's clothes? That's how I feel writing that stuff. Awkward and obvious. Truth is, I’m no marketing whiz or branding genius. I'm just... me. A dad with muddy shoes. A husband who has strong opinions about the best way to stack a dishwasher. A storyteller who loses the plot. Trying to make a living without losing myself in the process. This past year? Chaos. And not the “oh, I'm so busy crushing it” kind. The real, messy, life-happens kind. Knee-deep in life’s mud, trying to build something gourmet with twigs and leaves. And you know what? I've been scared to be myself in my business. Worried about judgement. Putting on a “business persona” that feels about as uncomfortable as a cat in a bathtub. And the kicker? I'm pretty sure y’all can see right through it anyway. But you know what? I'm figuring it out. Bit by bit. Stumbling towards this idea that maybe, just maybe, being myself is the only way forward. All this talk about “authenticity”—it's not just fancy brand-speak. It's the whole damn point. It's messy and scary and real. It's what makes us human in a world that’s increasingly...well, not. The stories that stick? They're not polished. They're raw. Real. Sometimes they're “I have no clue what I'm doing but I'm doing it anyway” kind of stories. So today, I'm choosing to be me. Sharing what I actually give a damn about. Learning out loud. Seeing what happens when I drop the act and get real. Because what I want for L&K isn’t world domination or to be the next big thing. It’s honesty. Creativity. Compassion. The stuff that matters when we close our laptops. Like my kids' mud kitchen, the best brands are built with imagination, guts, and a willingness to get messy. To try stuff out. To fall on our faces sometimes. To learn. To grow. To be human. So here’s to being real. To sharing our wins and our face-plants. To building something our future selves—and maybe even our kids—will be proud of. To working to live, not the other way around. Who’s game?\n\n🔥 QUICK TO KILL, SLOW TO HEAL! 🔥 Most likely, your company's primary goal is to make a profit every month. It is critical to keep a close eye on your financial results. There is nothing wrong with that. ❓But what happens if this monthly goal is not met, especially if it is not met for a few months in a row? ▶️ Cutting costs is a common reaction among key decision-makers because it is the quickest fix. And marketing budgets are frequently used as the first line of defence. I have seen brands die or barely survive as a result of squeezing their necks to spit out a planned profit. 🩺 Before rigorously cutting your investment budget, look at the heart of your business—your brand strategy. Ask yourself one simple question: Is it still relevant? Is there anything you can do differently to achieve better results? If you find market frictions, address them head-on and adjust your market approach. 💯 Fix the basics first before you take deadly actions, lowering that one line in your P&L statement over and over again. This decision may have a short lifespan. Try a combination of the two: 👉Revising your strategy on the one hand and 👉Modestly reducing your marketing budget, on the other hand, if you need to respond to cost-cutting immediately. Cutting off the fuel supply? That's not just unwise; it could be your business suicide.〽️ 📖 For more insights on refining your brand strategy, see here: https://edgedots.com/book/ https://lnkd.in/dnTmYe3n #Entrepreneurship #BusinessGrowth #MarketingStrategy #BrandBuilding\n\nHave you ever been zoning out, thinking about all the cool things your business could do, and then suddenly, doubt crashes the party? I know that feeling all too well. It's like one second you're on top of the world, planning out your digital empire, and the next, you're wondering if you can really pull it off. Scary stuff, right? Here's something I've picked up along the way: we've all been there. Yep, even the folks who seem like they've got it all figured out. Starting something new or taking a business digital can feel like you're stepping into a whole new world without a map. But, what if we looked at doubt a little differently? Like, what if it's not the enemy but actually something that can push us forward? I've found that letting those 'what ifs' fuel my creativity and drive kinda turns them into a secret weapon. It's all about using that energy to keep moving forward, even when it's tough. Your dream for your business? It's not just a daydream; it's totally within reach. And those doubts? They're just part of the journey. So, how about we dive into this together? If you're feeling a bit unsure but excited about what's next, let's talk.

If you are guilty, this is not intended to bring shame but mere food for thought for re-alignment for yourself first, then your business ⭐ In an increasingly digitized world of social media, people and brands are even more scrutinized and from time to time need reflection and re-alignment 🧭 So here are some questions you may consider for self-reflection 💡 - are you chasing fame on social media? - do you have something of value to offer? - are you passionate about the work you do? - does it have merit for someone to buy your product or service? - do you carry the same values your brand stand for or is it simply click bait content? The real flex will always be \"authenticity\" backed with \"merit\" and \"competence\" in what you DELIVER! There are no shortcuts in the honest hustle and grind but losing yourself in the process in pursuit of financial rewards may not yield the desired results 💯 Let me know your 💬 on the comments below\n\nNovember Business Boosters: Tuesday Tips November is a pivotal month and sets the tone for the year's end.

Foot traffic dips, phones go silent, and the initial excitement of your grand opening can feel like a distant memory. But fear not, fellow entrepreneurs! Here are 5 battle-tested strategies to help you navigate the lull: Plan for the Lull: It might sound counterintuitive, but budgeting for slow periods is crucial. Sock away a portion of your profits during peak times to create a financial buffer. Reinvest and Replenish: Use slow periods to up your game! Take advantage of the downtime for staff training, product development, or website improvements. Consider offering discounts on slower days to attract new customers and boost inventory turnover. Market Like a Mastermind: Don't let your brand presence fade during the quiet! Double down on social media engagement, run targeted online ads, or launch loyalty programs to incentivize repeat business. Embrace the Analytical Advantage: Use the slowdown to analyze customer data and identify trends. This can help you refine your marketing strategy, product offerings, and even pricing to better align with customer preferences. Network, Network, Network: Connect with other businesses in your industry. Share experiences, collaborate on promotions, or even explore bartering opportunities to keep resources flowing. First-Year Woes and Financial Foresight: The first year is a rollercoaster, especially when it comes to finances. Resist the urge to overspend on flashy equipment or unnecessary inventory. Every decision should be data-driven and aligned with your long-term goals. Remember, it's a marathon, not a sprint! Bonus Tip: Be wary of \"shiny object syndrome!\" Don't get swept away by the latest marketing fads. Focus on strategies that resonate with your target audience and deliver measurable results. The Takeaway: Quiet periods are inevitable, but they don't have to be your downfall. View them as an opportunity to strategize, adapt, and emerge stronger. After all, a little rain helps the garden grow, right? So, stay positive, keep innovating, and your business will blossom in no time! 🏆 #SmallBusiness #EntrepreneurLife #SlowAndSteadyWinsTheRace #MeekBusinessFinance #Growth #Business #Funding"
