Swansea is already home to Audi, Mercedes-Benz, SEAT, Skoda, smart and Volkswagen vehicles dealerships owned by the company, which celebrates its 75th anniversary next year.\n\nIt is the second acquisition by the Sinclair Group in a matter of months following its purchase of Likes, Hay-on-Wye Land Rover, in December.\n\nAll 65 staff employed at the site will be welcomed into Sinclair Group.\n\n“The opportunity to acquire this business fitted perfectly with our ongoing expansion plan – adding the illustrious Jaguar brand to our portfolio and strengthening our association with Land Rover in the wake of our recent purchase of Likes from the Walters Group,” said Sinclair Group managing director Andy Sinclair.\n\n“The Land Rover and Jaguar operations have been trading on Swansea Enterprise Park for 27 and 12 years respectively, so both are extremely well-established at this location and we’re extremely proud to welcome them into the group.”\n\nHe added: “Since 1945, we have built our reputation on delivering the highest standards of personal service to Welsh motorists and we now look forward to extending that unrivalled retail experience to the customers of Sinclair Land Rover and Sinclair Jaguar in Swansea for many years to come.”"
