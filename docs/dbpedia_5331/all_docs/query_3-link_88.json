        "text": "YOUR MERCEDES SERVICING EXPLAINED\n\nWondering what the difference between an A and B Service? Unsure what recommended additional items are or what is considered to be routine maintenance? Let us fill in the gaps for you.\n\nWhen you bring your Mercedes-Benz to one of our retailers, you can rest assured that you're in good hands. Our team of experts combine unparalleled technical knowledge with a dedication to exceptional customer care. Whether your vehicle requires a standard 'A' service or a more comprehensive 'B' service, we'll make sure that only necessary parts are replaced, and we'll always keep you informed every step of the way with written confirmation of the work performed. Trust us to take care of your vehicle and give you complete peace of mind.\n\nWHAT'S INCLUDED IN YOUR SERVICE?\n\nThe service includes a personalised ‘StarView’ video from your vehicle technician outlining details of your vehicle's health check and detailing any required work, no work is ever carried out without customer approval.\n\nOnce we receive approval, you'll receive a personalized quotation. The service quotation is composed of two parts: Routine Maintenance, which includes a full inspection and items needed at every service such as an oil/ filter change, and ‘Recommended Additional’ Items*, which are determined by the vehicle's age and mileage. A 'B' service is a little more comprehensive and also includes brake testing and headlamp alignment.\n\n*Recommended Additional Items are needed to follow the Manufacturer’s Recommended Service Schedule. Without them your free Roadside Assistance cover and 30 years perforation and corrosion warranty will not be renewed."
