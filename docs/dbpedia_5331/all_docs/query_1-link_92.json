At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for voting.\n\n(Operator Instructions) Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris King, VP of Investor Relations. Chris, you may begin.\n\nChris King\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Sinclair's First Quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call today are Chris Ripley, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Lucy Rutishause, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Weisbord, our Chief Operating Officer and President of local media.\n\nBefore we begin, I want to remind everyone that the slides and supplemental information for today's earnings call are available on our website.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. The Company uses its website as a key source of company information which can be accessed at www.sptin.net in accordance with Regulation FD.

We also expect that the presentation of certain information in our second quarter earnings release conference call and investor presentation will differ from our first quarter presentation due to an ongoing routine common process with the Securities and Exchange Commission that we believe other publicly traded broadcasters are currently engaged in as well.\n\nLet me now turn the call over to Chris Gryphics.\n\nChristopher Ripley\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll start on Slide 4 by introducing an overview of our first quarter financial results. As you can see, Sinclair delivered strong solid first quarter results that meant that met our guidance expectations in our Local Media segment.\n\nWhile Tennis Channel exceeded expectations for adjusted EBITDA within local media, our distribution revenue came in slightly above the top end of our guidance range, while advertising revenue was slightly below the low end of our range. As a result, we were comfortably within the consolidated guidance ranges for total revenues and adjusted EBITDA.\n\nTurning to slide 5, I wanted to highlight our strong commitment to our stakeholders through our return of cash. Since the beginning of 2024, we have paid approximately $16 million to shareholders through our regular quarterly dividend, which has a dividend yield of 7% as of March 31st, while also purchasing $27 million of debt in January for approximately $25 million in cash.\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, we bought back approximately $91 million in face value of our debt and retired another $35 million through amortization related payments in early 2023, we also repurchased nearly 9 million shares of our Class A. common stock in addition to the $81 million in dividend payments to our shareholders since the beginning of 2023. Our commitment to maximizing value for all of our stakeholders remains a top priority for the Company.\n\nTurning to Slide 6. We remain committed to the transformation of our traditional local media business. We believe Sinclair, as well as the broader industry has multiple growth drivers. First, excluding the impact of the 2020 Georgia runoff, we expect to see record-breaking political advertising revenues in 2024, which equate to more than $350 million.\n\nWe continue to see strong political advertising demand, and we expect the strong growth of issue orientated political advertising and what appears to be several closed Senate and House races in our footprint to accelerate this growth significantly as we get closer to this year's general election.\n\nGiven the lack of hypercompetitive primaries, we do expect political advertising spend to be more heavily weighted to the third and fourth quarters as we anticipate most of the spend at the presidential level will be focused on general election. Rob will cover this more in more detail shortly.\n\nSecond, our focus on high demand and differentiated local news and sports content continues to drive strong and loyal viewership with over 44% of your impressions across our station portfolio, driven by non network content. In addition, with nearly all of our big four traditional subscribers renewing throughout 2024.\n\nWe expect a mid single digit net retrans to year kegger from 2023 to 2025. We have already renewed 42% of our big four traditional network subscribers as of the beginning of May. With the remaining renewals coming up throughout the remainder of the year, next-gen broadcasting is becoming a reality as well.\n\nWe now have three data coverage in over half of our 86 markets and over 75% of the U.S. In addition, at the NAB conference last month in Las Vegas, we launched broadband wireless, our next-gen data casting platform with our first go-to market data casting market partner, M-GO.\n\nTurning to Slide 7 for years, the broadcast industry often led by Sinclair has spoken about next-gen broadcast opportunities that will represent a sea change for the traditional broadcast industry. I'm very pleased to announce at the time for next-gen data distribution opportunity is now broadcast data distribution has many benefits such as a more efficient distribution of mass consumption.\n\nData improves customer experience with lower latency and higher quality and lower cost for data delivery. Broadband will use the industry's three-dose spectrum for data distribution to deliver a suite of data solutions to the market platform, centralizes data distribution management across multiple stations and markets allocate spectrum assets without disruption to the existing broadcast services and collect insights on executed data deliveries.\n\nAnother business use case focuses on automotive connectivity services, which would allow the distribution of data to vehicles to include over the air software updates, live broadcasts and alerts, high-fidelity audio and other features.\n\nIn addition, working in partnership with M-GO, we have launched a new content distribution service using streaming video offload, allowing a customer to seamlessly switch between over-the-air and over-the-top sources to offload bandwidth-intensive traffic from traditional broadband networks.\n\nBroadband will also be able to deliver precise navigation, which is able to achieve up to three centimeters GPS accuracy accuracy by augmenting GPS data with real-time kinetic position, positioning error correction feeds.\n\nIn addition, the broadcast positioning system or BPS. is not satellite based, which can offer crucial redundancies should anything happen to the existing GPS infrastructure that almost every industry relies on heavily today. We could not be more excited regarding the near term and long term business opportunities for next-gen broadcast and broadband. And we're focused on remaining an industry leader in this exciting new technology Turning to Slide 8.\n\nLast week, we paid the remaining $445 million to Diamond Sports Group per the settlement with Diamond that we previously announced in January. STD contributed $347 million to the gross settlement figure, while ventures contributed an additional $98 million. In addition to the $50 million ventures paid in March.\n\nThese allocations were made following discussions between the two independent Board of Directors of STG. and ventures after considering several different financial metrics, including revenue, assets, income, EBITDA and free cash flow for the two units among other considerations.\n\nNotably, our net settlement cost estimate remains $250 million to $325 million, which reflects income tax benefits. The increase in the MSA fees and other considerations of the net cost estimate. We expect SBG.'s portion of the total to be approximately 55% to 60%.\n\nNow let me turn it over to Rob to discuss our local media strategy.\n\nRobert Weisbord\n\nThanks, Chris. Turning to slide 9, I wanted to begin by touching on the broad advertising environment which came in slightly below our expectations for core advertising in the first quarter, pro forma core advertising was down 2.1% on a reported consolidated basis.\n\nHowever, the quarter was impacted by less premium sports exposure compared to a year ago period due to the Super Bowl being broadcast on CBS this year versus Fox last year, as well as the plan for being based on cable this year in addition to a $6 million decline in the sports betting category.\n\nAbsent those revenue streams in both years, core revenue would have been up low single digits year over year. We do expect core advertising revenue growth to increase year over year in the second quarter, with growth expected in the 2% to 6% range over last year's second quarter.\n\nNo other categories services continued to be a top performer up year over year in the quarter, driven by home repair and home building categories, legal and pharmaceutical categories. Also showed nice growth year over year. However, as noted earlier, exports fell adding fell materially year over year for automotive and medical were the largest drivers of our slight miss versus our guidance for core advertising revenue.\n\nAuto continues to see modest pressure as manufacturers and dealers see fewer sales primarily by the higher interest rates. As we begin the second quarter retail services and entertainment pacings are strong, while medical and pharmaceutical pacings are slightly softer than April last year. Also of note, sports betting, which was down almost 60% year over year in first quarter is pacing up almost 30% in the second quarter.\n\nOn slide 10, I wanted to provide a quick update on political ad spending as the political season is well underway and expected to be a record year. We booked $24 million in political advertising in the first quarter of 2024. Within our guidance range, we saw strong fundraising trends. We continue to anticipate political revenues to be back-end loaded this year based on both independent third-party research and our internal data.\n\nNotably, as of May first, we have pre-bought over $77 million in political advertising for the second half of the year through election day. This compares to $21 million as of the same date in 2020 and $28 million in 2022. Our proprietary pricing tool will help us to price properly versus demand throughout the political season to maximize revenue.\n\nLooking at the individual races 23, the 34 US Senate races this fall being Sinclair markets. We forecast 10 of the states will have competitive races as opposed to eight in 2020. We have seven states in our footprint with the governor races, and we believe we have 24 competitive House races in our footprint this fall as opposed to 18 in 2020.\n\nThis is in addition to the 10 battleground states for the presidency within our footprint, we continue to see strong activity from pack and super pack fund raises and heavy spending is forecasted to continue for issue based advertise. These developments lead us to continue to expect political advertising revenues above $350 million in 2024.\n\nNow turning to slide 11, we have reached retrans agreements with 42% of our traditional big four subscribers for new multiyear distribution agreements so far this year, nearly all of the remaining traditional big four network subscribers on agreements that expire between now and the end of 2024.\n\nWe also have only one big four network affiliation that expires before the back half of 2026, providing us with high visibility on our network compensation expenses over the 2024 through 2026 timeframe. When these negotiations scheduled in mind, we continue to expect a mid-single digit two year kegger for net retrans from 2023 to 2025.\n\nAnother positive data point during the quarter comes from our over the air broadcast networks charge comments and TBD, which referred to as the SAP stack, set a new high in the quarter in the quarter with primetime viewing up 38% year over year, reaching 73,000 viewers in the coveted 25 to 54 age group. In fact, the three networks combine set 62 all-time high record ratings records during the first quarter.\n\nTurning to Slide 12. Our news gathering operation continues to excel while highlighting the importance of broadcast news to local communities as demonstrated by our coverage in the March 26th collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge here in Baltimore, our Baltimore and Washington D.C. station dominated the coverage locally with our Baltimore station WBFS, providing WiFi coverage of the Class A bulk 30 minutes before any other station in the market with line.\n\nWithin 48 hours of the strategy. Our two stations combined for 1.6 million page views on their website over 2 million YouTube views more than 9 million social impressions and 300,000 engagements illustrating our focus on connecting with our viewers wherever they may be and how are they wants to view our content as seen on slide 13, we also continue to build and develop our audience social division and evolve the art of reporting and storytelling to engage with fans of sports entertainment news and true crime.\n\nWe have recently signed three time national champion college football, Coach, Urban Meyer and commentator Rob Stone to host a new sports podcast focused on college football on and off season, which will launch this fall. Our team is also in active negotiations with multiple top-tier athletes and entertainers as we continue to build out our roster of podcast and audio that look for an announcement in the coming weeks, which will detail all we have planned for rollout later this year. So let me turn the call back over to Chris to provide an update on sales channel as well as our broader Ventures segment.\n\nChristopher Ripley\n\nThanks, Rob. As seen on slide 14, Tennis Channel recorded another strong quarter with $63 million in total revenue, which was at the high end of our guidance and $26 million in adjusted EBITDA. After excluding $1 million in growth initiatives, net costs, which was comfortably above our guidance. We expect continued strong growth metrics from Tennis Channel as we look forward to our live coverage of rolling barrels later this month.\n\nMoving to slide 15, the average number of households watching Tennis Channel in the first quarter grew by 35% year over year, while total viewers grew by 27% and social media impressions grew by 141% year over year. Once again, Tennis Channel ratings out growth outpaced all other English-language sports networks in the world. The TC. plus streaming platform increased monthly subscribers by 7% year over year, ending the quarter with its highest monthly subscriber total ever.\n\nThe Tier two FastChannel grew by 273% year over year, thanks in large part to expanded distribution and its as its exclusive tennis content continues to drive strong growth across multiple delivery platform. In addition, Tennis Channel will launch a direct-to-consumer offering later this year, which will provide a significant new leg of growth. We also believe Pico ball coverage and PBTV. will drive even stronger growth metrics for Tennis Channel in the coming quarters.\n\nAlso of note, for the first time, Sinclair is participating in the sports upfront next week in New York. In addition, we will be offering opportunities for advertisers to be aggregated in stadium as well as through sponsorships for all US-based tennis tournaments through Tennis Channel. We remain excited about the many growth opportunities ahead for Tennis Channel.\n\nI wanted to provide a brief update on our ventures portfolio on Slide 16. As of March 31st, ventures held a cash position of $318 million. Of note, during the quarter, the Company received $49 million in exit distributions and $3 million in capital distributions while making an additional $2 million of capital contributions into the portfolio.\n\nAs illustrated this quarter, our goal over time is to translate a significant amount of these minority investments into other majority owned investments that we expect to have long term growth potential and consolidation opportunities as well as provide greater visibility into the performance of ventures assets. We will continue to update our investors on a regular basis as we transform this investment portfolio.\n\nBefore I turn the call over to Lucy to discuss the financial results, I wanted to highlight our awards and charitable endeavors on Slide 17. Sinclair won 28 different broadcast awards during the quarter, including three national awards and two regional Emmy Awards.\n\nOn Earth Day, we released our second annual corporate social responsibility report, which highlights our environmental and social efforts throughout the Company. On the charitable front, we held our second company-wide day of service in April, which saw over 1,300 employees volunteering their time to provide over 37 hundred hours of service.\n\nDuring that single day, we collected over [EUR1,100] of trash prepared and served over 38 hundred meals impact more than 14,000 baby products and more than 500 boxes of food. I want to take this opportunity to thank our employees for another successful day of service.\n\nIn addition, I'm proud to announce that Sinclair donated $50,000 to the Maryland, tough Baltimore, strong Key Bridge fund, which will go towards helping our fellow mount of Merrill lenders that have experienced an economic hardship following the collapse of the key bridge here in Baltimore. Our Sinclair cares also completed a partnership with reading is fundamental, which was a month-long campaign during national reading months. In March.\n\nNow let me turn the call over to Lucy to provide additional details on our financial results in the quarter.\n\nLucy Rutishauser\n\nThank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Beginning on slide 18. On a consolidated basis, we delivered media revenues during the first quarter that met our guidance range as distribution revenues exceeded our guidance.\n\nPolitical revenues came in near the upper end of our guidance range and core advertising was slightly below guidance due to the reasons Ralph mentioned earlier. As compared to last year, consolidated media revenues increased to $792 million during the quarter, primarily on the higher political revenues and an increase in distribution revenue.\n\nOn Slide 19, consolidated adjusted EBITDA was also within our guidance range with media expenses favorable to guidance as a result of sales, promotion and G&A expenses coming in better than anticipated and corporate overhead higher due to primarily stock-based compensation and group insurance as compared to last year.\n\nOn a pro forma basis, consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the quarter increased by 10%, driven by the increase in higher media revenues and lower corporate overhead. Media expenses were up year over year, largely driven by annual compensation increases and network programming fees.\n\nSlide 20 walks through our balance sheet metrics with the next meaningful maturity more than two years away Sinclair Television Group's first lien net leverage was 4.3 times and total net leverage 5.3 times at the end of the quarter.\n\nOn a trailing eight quarter basis, interest coverage was 2.9 times as of March 31st. As previously announced, we repurchased $27 million in face value of debt for approximately $25 million in cash in January, our consolidated cash position was $655 million at quarter end was $337 million at SPG and $318 million at Ventures, including our undrawn revolving commitments. Total liquidity was more than $1.3 billion. There were 66 million total shares outstanding at quarter end.\n\nSlide 21 introduces our second quarter guidance, which calls for total media revenues in the $813 million to $832 million range, up 7% to 9% year over year in the quarter. The growth is driven primarily by political, which we expect to be in the $29 million to $35 million range as well as a 4% increase in distribution.\n\nRevenues for advertising, as Rob mentioned, is expected to grow 2% to 6%, given continued strength in the services, retail and entertainment categories. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the quarter to be in the range of $132 million to $155 million, up from the pro forma $110 million of adjusted EBITDA in the year ago period. That's due to higher media revenues being modestly offset by higher production costs, network programming fees, sales cost on the higher revenue and Tennis Channel growth initiatives.\n\nTurning to slide 22, we include our 2024 full year guidance for certain expenses. Notable changes are an increase to interest expense on fewer Fed rate cuts expected this year, an acceleration of Q2 25 cash taxes into Q4 of 24, lower CapEx, lower media expenses and an additional $10 million in ventures distributions received in the first quarter.\n\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris for some closing comments.\n\nChristopher Ripley\n\nThank you, Lucy. Turning to our key takeaways on Slide 23 six. Sinclair delivered solid first quarter results, meeting guidance expectations in our Local Media segment and exceeding adjusted EBITDA expectations that Tennis Channel core advertising trends remain solid in most categories with our effective yield management and sales training processes, driving industry leading core growth over the past several quarters, we anticipate second quarter year-over-year growth of between 2% and 6% in core advertising.\n\nWe have significant retransmission agreements renewing this year, of which we've already renewed 42% of the traditional base for subscribers with only one network affiliation agreement remaining to be renewed. We have good rate visibility into the next couple of years, leading us to forecast a mid single digit to year CAGR in net retransmission from 2023 to 2025.\n\nWe announced the launch of broadband, our next-gen data solutions brand that will deliver a unified suite of products to the marketplace and also announced our first next-gen corporate partner M-GO.\n\nIn summary, Sinclair is in a strong position for both the short and long term. Our strategic focus aligns with the anticipation of record-breaking political election year contributing to robust growth in adjusted EBITDA throughout 2024. We could not be more excited about the future in front of Sinclair. Lucy, Rob and I will now open the call to questions.\n\nThank you for joining us today.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions)\n\nDan Kurnos, The Benchmark group.\n\nDan Kurnos\n\nGreat, thanks. Good afternoon. And can you guys just dig a little bit deeper into the core guide for Q2? It's really healthy. You guys give a little bit of color on it. It sounds like there's a little bit of uniqueness there like sports betting that Rob called out. But beyond that, it sounds like things are getting slightly better. So maybe you could talk through kind of what you're seeing on the core environment in Q2 is especially as we head into the back half of this year.\n\nRobert Weisbord\n\nSure, Dan, this is Rob, even though orders trending negative is a very small, low single digit. So it's starting to return to some how they're going to have to get rid of the 20 fours coming up. We expect some rebates. There's been some softness in the first part of the year due to interest rates. But with our automotive specialist, we've been able to offset some of that weakness in that category.\n\nOur services remain strong. We have a big home purchase predictor out in the marketplace that has delivered key results for us to help drive our service category. And we believe that with our proprietary pricing system, we're able to maximize the demand that is in the market with rates.\n\nChristopher Ripley\n\nAlso, I'd just add to that Dan, I think for reasons that Rob pointed out in his prepared remarks, Q1 had some negative impacts from the lack of certain sports and sports betting coming off some high comps from the prior year. And but what we see in Q2 is really pretty consistent with what we have been performing at in terms of core growth in 2023 quarter after quarter. So we've had we've been consistently posting numbers that are industry-leading. So obviously, Q1, a little bit different for reasons we described. But where we're back on trend for Q2.\n\nDan Kurnos\n\nDo you have a view on how the year kind of plays out, not necessarily a specific number, but given some crowd-out potential and the fact that you guys are already calling for record political. And I don't know if you're factoring in the Merrill Lynch craziness that's already going on, that's not considered a competitive race?\n\nRobert Weisbord\n\nYes, we factored that in and that's why we've gone to the algorithmic approach to pricing our inventory in those markets where we've seen significant pre-books of those dollars, we've adjusted the rates based on that demand. So in prior years without having a T cell pricing system.\n\nIt was kind of like a whack-a-mole, but now there's weekly meetings with we have a yield and pricing and planning team that goes through and what's happening with the system on a weekly basis. So we think we're better prepared now than ever to be able to handle that demand.\n\nChristopher Ripley\n\nYes. Certainly, I'm sorry, to end it just second, everything Rob said, in terms of the record political advertising we're expecting for this year, would you would expect that to amount to some amount of crowd out in the third and fourth quarter. But we're optimistic that the trends we've been putting up and our new systems for managing pricing that will swell the so-called will hopefully stay positive through. That's a political dailies.\n\nRobert Weisbord\n\nAnd I don't want to understate the signing of Urban Meyer as our first top sports podcast personality. It'll be in season out of season urban already has a series of top-notch people lined up to come on to the podcast. So that is definitely a growth area for us as well.\n\nDan Kurnos\n\nAnd my sneak one more in Chris, just on the next-gen, I mean, you know, you're saying it's here. We've heard it for a while. Obviously, you guys have been out front on this one. Is there any way to quantify the impact to the P&L from this immediately handfuls of millions next year, how should we start to think about the actual benefit from the initiatives that you guys are launching and you have a very unique opportunity set both here and abroad. So love some color.\n\nChristopher Ripley\n\nThere is, as I said, the time to actually make this opportunity real is now and where in one of the first product sets is going to be a CDN offload with our partner M-GO. I'm sure other CDN operators would be interested in that to automotive hot on its heels and enhanced GPS. And some of those things are going to be coming live the end of this year.\n\nAnd I think the dollars will start to come in when those when those offerings become live, I think this is going to be a situation where it's sort of an exponential growth curve, if you will. If you think about and shape adoption curve and typical new technologies, I'd expect it to start off somewhat slow, but then pick up significant pace as we get more adoption. So 2025 what you're asking about.\n\nYes, it's probably not a very material amount of revenue. But as we get more penetration into these end markets, we'd expect that to pick up pace significantly.\n\nDan Kurnos\n\nGot it. Super helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAaron Watts, Deutsche Bank.\n\nAaron Watts\n\nThanks for having me on has had two questions. The first one, another one around core advertising. We've heard from several ad driven media companies that well local has been fairly steady and healthy. It seems as though that a sustained national ad recovery is proving elusive, curious if that's the same experience you're having, but also how you think about the drivers of that continued national softness go beyond simply macro rate concerns, et cetera, causing large brands to hold back spending?\n\nOr is this maybe some early signs of all the ad inventory coming online from recently introduced streaming advertising tiers, perhaps siphoning off share that used to flow into traditional TV marketplace. And if that's not happening yet, is that an impact you are expecting to see?\n\nRobert Weisbord\n\nPerfect. So after that, so we started off the year naturally slow, but it has rebounded. It is pacing positive for us in the second quarter. And in addition, we struck a very unique deal to be able to be the exclusive seller of Netflix in our local markets as well. So in any impact where streaming might it plays, we've taken some of the ad dollars. We've positioned ourselves to add premium streaming on inventory to sell with our local sellers. So I think it fortifies us both locally and nationally.\n\nAaron Watts\n\nOkay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then secondly, around capital allocation does the focus continue to land on debt reduction going forward? And relatedly, have you bought back any debt since the end of the first quarter? And as we think about you moving towards your leverage target of high three times, low four times area. And there'll be clearly healthy cash inflows this year from political. But as you move into next year, that obviously cycles off either ways you can help us think about perhaps in a way, inorganic ways to help accelerate your journey towards targets?\n\nChristopher Ripley\n\nYes. So look, the we we're still focused on a few different priorities within within broadcast, there's a decent amount of transformation spending going on around cloud and unified ad sales. And and they'll they'll be significant savings coming out of those transformation efforts, which should come to fruition over the next year or so.\n\nAnd on our ventures, as I've stated before, they're there, we're looking for new opportunities. But in terms of the capital structure, we will continue to be opportunistic, depending on where debt and equity markets trade. Our emphasis right now is for SBG on the deleveraging side and certainly debt buybacks are something that are going to be high on our list for that excess cash flow that is being produced.\n\nAnd as we've always stated, where we have no sacred cows we want to unlock there and the sum of the parts valuation that we think we're grossly undervalued for and the extent that asset sales makes sense in order to unlock that value and help us delever, then that's something that we'd be open to as well.\n\nAaron Watts\n\nOkay. Thanks, Chris. Thanks everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nSteven Cahall, Wells Fargo.\n\nSteven Cahall\n\nThank you. And first, Chris and Lucy, just on the Q2 retrans guide, it's about $384 million. I think that's flat with what you had in Q. one on. So you've done a lot of renewals year to date. Was wondering if you could just update us on what you're seeing in those renewals of pricing coming in the way I would expect, I think we thought that you might see a little bit of acceleration quarter to quarter in retrans. So would love it, if you could unpack those trends a bit.\n\nAnd then on Tennis Channel, really strong EBITDA in Q1, the guide is much lower in Q2. Just trying to understand, is that timing of programming is that investments in DTC? Anything else? And then just lastly, kind of following up on Aaron's question. As you think about refinancing that you've got ahead, you've got a lot of assets at Ventures.\n\nYou've always been very, I think, particular and how you've structured the Company in terms of what could STG. and what the debentures on. So as kind of creditors move into the refinancing and see the leverage at STG., do you see those assets as fungible? Or do you really think that the silos are going to be on kind of going their separate ways increasingly as you get into the refinancing. Thank you.\n\nChristopher Ripley\n\nGreat. Thanks, Steve. So first on on retrans of all of the deals that we've done so far have met or exceeded our expectations. I think the what you're seeing in terms of your expectation of acceleration just might be a timing issue in terms of when the MVPDs are coming up because we will see that acceleration this year. And as we indicated that, that dovetails with our guidance of mid-single digit growth from 2024 and five. So I think what you're seeing there is just a timing issue in terms of when those deals, the bulk of the deals come up. And then your second question?\n\nSorry, Steve, what was your second question again?\n\nSteven Cahall\n\nJust on Tennis channels, kind of once we kind of second quarter, the quarter's strong background commentary on medical and animal handling.\n\nChristopher Ripley\n\nI'll let Lucy chime in on this, but a Tennis Channel is seasonally lowest in Q2 because of mainly because of oil and gas or so as the French Open, it's it's our biggest event. It's one of the majors. There's a lot of production spend in that quarter, and I wish you want to add.\n\nLucy Rutishauser\n\nI guess I would just add on Steve, that there's there's also a timing of rights payments around tennis and as well as they have our upcoming third direct to consumer launch later this year. So there is some initiative spending around that. It happens in Q2 as well.\n\nChristopher Ripley\n\nRight. And then in terms of your last question, look, our expectation now is that both of ventures and SBG. are self-funded and we don't see a need for assets to be moved from one or the other. And obviously, to the extent that, you know, circumstances were to change, then that's something we could do, but we don't foresee that need needed.\n\nSteven Cahall\n\nGreat. Thank you for that.\n\nOperator\n\nBarton Crockett, Rosenblatt.\n\nBarton Crockett\n\nOkay, great. Thank you. Wanted to just to drill down on a couple of the key numbers that you guys talk about. So in terms of subscriber churn in the industry, could you give us a sense of what you're seeing now? I know box, I think spoke earlier about minus 8% on different people have different take. So I'm just wondering what you're seeing if you could update us on that?\n\nAnd then in terms of fee, the ad market, you touched on this a little bit but on. I'm just curious, just in broad kind of feeling that we're in an environment where we have interest rates that are kind of higher for longer than I think people were hoping even a couple of months ago, it sounds like that might have impacted your advertising a bit, but maybe that impact is fading now. Just what are you feeling from that kind of macro backdrop, if anything in your ad business?\n\nLucy Rutishauser\n\nSo far, and I'll take the first one to come. We are continuing to see mid-single digit percent churn across our subscriber base on that inertia. The traditionals are down the virtual. It's been growing. Average is mid-single digit churn from the advertising.\n\nRobert Weisbord\n\nFrom the advertising we continue to watch the interest rates, how it's impacting the economy through second quarter, and we're now halfway through it on we kind of see how it's playing out. The business has become a month-to-month business, but we have the Olympics coming up in third quarter that will stimulate our NBC stations. Political will be hitting about that time as well.\n\nAnd then we get into NFL and college football were robust on the fact that the price of college football coming up this season to go along with Prime NFL. So starting Friday nights through all the way through Sunday night and ABC, as hasn't announced, but the indications are that 10 Monday night football games will air on NBC as well as a simulcast. It carries us through the year and through political because that's how I look at it.\n\nChristopher Ripley\n\nAnd get to a I'll add on to that, Robin mentioned that Princess Auto, which is particularly interest-rate sensitive, it was down a little bit or is down a little bit. And but what we've been able to do is fill in and up with other categories and other areas and continue to have that overall core growth that we've been reporting on even if there is some weakness showing up because of interest rates.\n\nRobert Weisbord\n\nAnd I'll remind everybody, several years ago, we brought in specialists from key categories that had a background in those categories to train our the rest of our sales group to make them knowledgeable to not have that reliance on automotive. So we've been well prepared to go out to the marketplace as called consulting versus just selling spots and bars.\n\nBarton Crockett\n\nOkay. That's great. And then just one other kind of check-the-box question on this. Is there any exposure that you guys would have now or not if the Bally's kind of bankruptcy emergence doesn't doesn't develop as everyone hopes, given the Comcast outage there? I think there's more questions about that than there might have been, but you guys are not exposed to that, correct? It doesn't matter for your settlement or anything at this point?\n\nChristopher Ripley\n\nYes, Barton, we now that we've paid the settlement there should be no impact to whatever happens to Diamond in the future.\n\nBarton Crockett\n\nOkay, great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nDavid hamburger, Morgan Stanley.\n\nDavid Hamburger\n\nThanks for taking the question. Could you help us with the timing of the income tax benefit, the MSA, the increase and various other considerations with regard to the Diamond Sports kind of sentiment.\n\nChristopher Ripley\n\nSo on the the tax side, it should be it depends on when diamond actually exits, but that will either it have an impact at the end of '24 into '25. And the next biggest category is MSA fees and those those were already collecting at a higher rate.\n\nAnd we are guaranteed to have at least six months of those post payments could go longer term. But again, that's where the previous question about FeNO, whether diamond emerges or not could have have some impact on whether they how long they want to be on our management services.\n\nI guess this is in fairness to that prior question, but at least they're committed to at least six months and maybe longer term after that. And that will happen post, you know, that's obviously time dependent, but in 2024.\n\nDavid Hamburger\n\nOkay, that's helpful. So post settlement, it looks like there's some use often most of the cash at the Television Group. I mean, obviously, we'll generate more free cash flow this quarter than there is about $220 million of residual cash at Ventures. Can you help us think about like what's the minimum cash balance you'd like to maintain? What would be the uses of cash?\n\nThe $200 million plus cash sitting at Ventures, if you were to use any cash or how you think about allocating as you spoke about assets between the two different silos, how do you envision managing cash between them?\n\nChristopher Ripley\n\nAnd while there's a lot of liquidity at SBGSTG. as a US does have positive cash on the balance sheet, cash will build significantly through the rest of this year, it has a fully undrawn over $600 million revolver. So minimum cash for this business is not very high.\n\nI'll let Lucy chime in on that if she wants to give a specific number there. But there is that whatever is coming in the door from here on out what's on the balance sheet is excess cash could be used for shareholder return and could be used for debt buybacks, as I mentioned before, which is the likely priority going forward. And of course, we are as I mentioned, at least as it relates to SVG. very focused on transformation and investing in certain areas that will pay off in the years to come.\n\nOn the ventures side, as we have been equitizing or monetizing our minority investments, we monetized approximately $50 million in Q1, and we'll continue to do so. So we'd expect cash to continue to build at Ventures, we're in no rush to redeploy it. We where we're looking for new majority controlled investments that are in fragmented industries with a good secular growth trends. And but again, no rush to us and to deploy that, we're going to be very disciplined in our approach to the marketplace there.\n\nDavid Hamburger\n\nOkay. And if I could just one housekeeping question. It sounded like Lucy had said that you are for your interest expense guidance. Previously you were factoring in more Fed cuts than anticipated now. What are you estimating now for for for that a higher number?\n\nLucy Rutishauser\n\nDavid, we always we always model based on the forward curve. So when we reported back in February, the forward curve had estimated I want to say it was probably like the Fed was trying indicating a six Fed cuts for the year now I think they're down to about two. So whatever the forward curve is what we use in our model.\n\nDavid Hamburger\n\nOkay. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nBenjamin Soff, Deutsche Bank.\n\nBenjamin Soff\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on the minority investments. I appreciate the commentary that you guys are looking to switch from the minority investments to the majority investments. When I look at your guidance, it implies that there's not much distributions left for the rest of the year. I'm just kind of wondering why that would be? And then a house keeping question, can you remind us what the value is of the value stake and then the other pieces of the investment portfolio? I think there was some real estate and some private equity in there.\n\nChristopher Ripley\n\nSo we don't forecast any monetizations or distributions explicitly. So that's why you're not seeing that in any of our projections. So not that's not to say that we don't think there will be. In fact, there almost certainly will be. But since it's not something that comes out of a regular operating business, that it's harder to project. And naturally, it's sort of lumpy. So we do not project and that explicitly, but we do expect there to be further monetizations as the year continues and I'm sorry, what was your next question?\n\nBenjamin Soff\n\nJust if you can share the value of the different items in the portfolio?\n\nChristopher Ripley\n\nSo the Valley stake is currently at one 55 about. And then when you sum up the rest of the minority assets, they're sitting around $600 million of NAV.\n\nBenjamin Soff\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nLucy Rutishauser\n\nlet me just also clarify, because I know historically, we've given that number, including cash to the number that Chris is quoting is excluding the cash that's sitting at Ventures.\n\nChristopher Ripley\n\nYes, that's excluding cash single estate, you've got the investments and then you've got cash. They all tested all that tallies up to around $1.1 billion.\n\nBenjamin Soff\n\nOkay, got it. And then I guess just a quick follow up. Like would you expect the amount of distributions you get going forward to accelerate as you guys kind of more actively look at that undergoing this transition?\n\nChristopher Ripley\n\nYes. I mean, look, it is lumpy. As I said, that's one of the reasons we don't put it in our models and projected, but we're actively working on several opportunities to monetize those that group of assets, that $600 million or so that I mentioned is what in the and the target lists to be monetized. And I would expect that we do have and some level of monetization continuing through this year.\n\nBenjamin Soff\n\nOkay. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much. That appears to be the end of our question and answer session. I will now hand back over to Chris for any closing.\n\nChristopher Ripley\n\nThank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today. To the extent you have any for further questions or comments, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time. And have a wonderful day. Thank you."
