        "text": "The Cullman County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) announced the purchase of multiple automated external defibrillators (AEDs).\n\nThe sheriff's office said the purchase was made along withthe Cullman County Commission as an investment into the lives of the citizens of the county.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nSheriff Matt Gentry acquired 80 of the devices from Cardiac Solutions, a Birmingham-based company.\n\nThe sheriff's office said the purchase will allow every Patrol Deputy and School Resource Deputy to have the equipment in their vehicle. The devices will also be placed throughout the sheriff’s office and detention center.\n\nThe sheriff's office said the remainder of the devices will be placed in the full-time Senior Centers located throughout Cullman County. Cardiac Solutions will provide the training to those who will use the equipment.\n\nCardiac Solutions is the only company that can offer camera remote monitoring 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\n“The safety and security of the citizens of Cullman County have always been the priority for the Sheriff’s Office. Keeping people alive is obviously a big part of this. Our deputies are the First Responders; they are the first ones on the scene of wrecks, accidents, assaults and other types of injury related incidents. It is their job to secure the scene and keep everyone alive until the medical professionals get there. I would like to personally thank the Cullman County Commission for partnering with us and helping to make this happen. These AEDs are a wonderful tool that will help save lives and hopefully give our citizens a little more peace of mind,” said Sheriff Gentry.\n\n\"The Cullman County Sheriff’s Office commitment to safety and readiness is commendable. Equipping vehicles and public spaces with AEDs, and AED camera remote monitoring is a crucial step in improving survival rates during cardiac emergencies. We are proud to collaborate with Sheriff Gentry and the Cullman County Commissioners on this life-saving endeavor,\" saidJon Seale, CEO of Cardiac Solutions.\n\nThe sheriff's office said the AEDs are currently at the CCSO and will be issued to the deputies as they receive the necessary training."
