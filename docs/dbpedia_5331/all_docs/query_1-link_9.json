        "text": "Predicting the future – 25 years too early\n\nSuggest buying a Toyota Prius and people will smile then nod approvingly. It’s cool to be seen to be doing your bit for the environment by buying an alternatively-propelled car. But tell those same friends that you always hankered after a Sinclair C5 and they will merely snigger and consider you rather strange for doing so. Strange, then, that Sir Clive Sinclair produced 12,000 C5s in nine months, and it took Toyota a whole lot longer – and cost rather more.\n\nSir Clive had already given the public accessible future technology. Though it was a Casio or Texas calculator that ultimately graced the executive desk of the 1970s, it had been the Sinclair pocket calculator of 1972 that started the ball rolling. Almost ten years later, the kit-build ZX80 led to the creation of the swish looking, ready-made ZX81, which truly kick-started the home computer revolution in the UK. In short, Sinclair Research was the UK’s Apple of its generation – giving the market exactly what it wanted, even though (customers) never knew they needed it.\n\nThe C5 was no different – except it was a quarter of a century premature.\n\nProviding the spark – the Electrically-Assisted Pedal Cycle Regulations 1983\n\nBoffins at the UK Transport and Road Research Laboratory configured this new legislation, the Department of Transport rubber stamped it. Sinclair then exploited these new rules to the max, ruthlessly.\n\nSimply any ‘electrically-assisted cycle’ constructed to these regulations had to weigh less than 60kg, contain an electric motor rated at (no more than) 250W and meet British standard pedal cycle braking specifications.\n\nSo, if Sinclair could meet these specifications anyone over 14 could legally ride a C5 without need for any licence, insurance or road taxation (or a protective helmet – a socially outrageous concept 25 years later).\n\nThe secret factory\n\nOf course, it’s hard to share a vision without a physical product – or hard cash. The Electricity Council had previously funded £5.5 million pounds of research grants (£2.3 million alone to the Lucas/GM electric van). However, Sinclair’s funding for the project came via a 10% sale of Sinclair Research Limited and, according to a report in The Engineer magazine, a total of £12.9m from Sinclair’s own funds. Having secured the funding, a production line was sought.\n\nOriginally, Sinclair’s aim was for the C5 to be the foothold of a whole range of electric vehicles, so when an option on the ashes of John Z. DeLorean’s Northern Irish facility,came up Sinclair voiced an interest. Sitting idle was a purpose-built vehicle assembly line embracing many modern production methods at a knockdown price with a workforce and Government backing to boot. At the same time Sinclair Vehicles Limited (SVL) was established, based at the University of Warwick Science Park.\n\nEarly in 1984 the seemingly well-informed Engineer magazine claimed an announcement was poised (for the ashes of DeLorean), though ultimately an arrangement could not be brokered. Undaunted, the Welsh Development Agency stepped in: Hoover (the American vacuum cleaner conglomerate) had a modern facility in deepest Merthyr Tydfil with space and workforce to spare. With a planned production volume of 200,000 vehicles a year, Hoover became interested enough\n\nto spend £100,000 on a satellite factory within the existing complex.\n\nStarting with six members of staff in a sealed room, the project was sworn to secrecy, such that the only scoop prior to launch was six months later in November 1984, when the Mail on Sunday published a story. In fact, all parties involved in the project treated it with the kind of security normally reserved for a new car launch. Hoover staff trial assembled 100 C5s prior to full production, pulling them apart before reassembling. Potentially 50 C5s could be produced per line per hour – with a capability of a massive 8000 C5s a week…\n\nThe other advantage of Hoover’s involvement with the project came in the form of 19 service centres, 400 Engineers and recommend six monthly servicing of the C5. A healthy contract on 200,000 projected vehicles.\n\nWhere there’s a Wills, there’s a way\n\nWhile Sinclair had an engineering aptitude, it was from the electronic rather than production background. However, an opportunity presented itself in the form of a casualty from the DeLorean debacle – Barrie Wills. Wills had a sound background in automobile lost causes – apprenticed at Jaguar, part of the team behind the Leyland National, Managing Director of Reliant before joining the board of DeLorean – all in the space of 20 years.\n\nWills was understandably sceptical of an electric car, but agreed to meet Sinclair regardless – despite being Delorean’s longest-serving employee, the Receivers were in control of the Belfast factory. Wills had a good relationship with Lotus in Hethel (so much so he would eventually father the front-wheel-drive Elan) and became the bridge between Lotus and Sinclair.\n\nFormula One design\n\nDevelopment had already begun at Ogle Design (Tom Karen’s design house responsible for the Scimitar and the Raleigh Chopper cycle amongst others). Sinclair, aided by Tony Wood Rogers, had a spent a year with Ogle honing the prototype, but the design was faltering and getting heavier – 100kg, then 150kg. So, when Wills arrived in March 1983, Ogle and Sinclair curtailed their association and transferred development to Hethel – home of Lotus.\n\nAt Lotus, brothers Brian and Colin Spooner examined what they had inherited: a design study with a set of regulations. Although the design was reworked by Lotus (dropping its drag co-efficient of friction from 0.95 to 0.6), Sinclair employed a young graduate fresh from the Royal School of Art’s Industrial Design course – Guy Desbarats. Desbarats revised the design and added flush wheel trims, in addition to a small boot tweaking the C5’s Bond Bug-esque rear pillar.\n\nHethel’s chassis design gurus set to work on the pressed steel chassis. The design had many parallels with the humble ski – great torsional strength made by two pieces of pressed steel joined in a sandwich, whilst giving enough flex to create a suspension effect. Over 19 months, the design was tested extensively – not just at Lotus’s Hethel test track, but at the Motor Industry Research Association (MIRA) test facility. The C5 was subjected to every surface and test condition bar the famous banked oval. Uniquely, the C5 crash testing found that no injury was likely in a collision simulation up to the C5’s maximum speed (15mph).\n\nFor a little piece of competition pedigree, the Bugatti Owners’ Club even opened up Prescott Hill Climb so Lotus could put development miles on the C5!\n\nThough originally sceptical of the whole commission for Sinclair, ultimately the Spooner brothers were won over – to quote Colin ‘It is a remarkably stable vehicle, it performs very well, and it’s safe. It is neither a toy or a plaything.’ To quote Brian: ‘The C5 is an extremely reliable piece of engineering, which I am convinced, will in time become even more sophisticated.’\n\nThe C5 also aided other automotive technology – its electronic display unit was created by AB Automotive Electronics. The next electronic display from AB would be the ‘Tokyo by night’ instrument cluster of the forthcoming Jaguar XJ40…\n\nBody moulding Maestro\n\nAt launch, it was established that the C5 had the world’s ‘Largest, mass produced injection moulding’. A bold claim and backed up by the UK industry big-hitters. ICI supplied the white/grey pigmented plastic polypropylene – any scuffs or scratches just revealed the same hue – with Linpac manufacturing the two-piece shell. The practice involved injection moulding the upper part of the shell complete, and moulding the lower part complete.\n\nThen a ‘tape’ would be placed between both halves of the shell whilst in a jig. The last stage was to ‘cure’ this tape by passing an electric current through it, effectively fusing the two halves (of the bodyshell) together. The total time taken for this process was just 70 seconds. A year earlier, in 1983, one of the first uses for this type of assembly was seen in the Austin Maestro – both its front and rear Bokan bumpers were moulded this way…\n\nWhile the moulded bodyshell waited, the assembly of the chassis began – wheels, tyres, bearing and steering were fitted. With the electric DC motor installed, further electrics (lights) are fitted to the complete shell before it clothes the rolling chassis. Just like a new car, the virgin C5s were rolling road tested on a special jig – which replicated a 12 stone body weight – before being rolled into cardboard packaging for transport direct from the line to waiting trucks.\n\nEnergy crisis\n\nAs owners regularly found out, battery technology had kind of stalled. In reality, until the mobile cellular telephone became common place ten years later, battery technology was not massively removed from the turn of the century. Undaunted, Sinclair made the most of what was commercially available – his personal belief being that once electric vehicles became popular, battery manufacturers would up the ante and pay for the development themselves.\n\nJoe Caine became Sinclair’s battery man. An ex-employee of Chloride, he contacted Sinclair by letter; one successful CV application later and he had his own lab in Bolton complete with £10,000 of testing equipment. In conjunction with Oldham Batteries, he developed a battery which withstood Sinclair’s remit 300 charge/discharge cycles. In four hours, a C5 could be 80% charged, in eight hours 100% charged. Because the C5 weighed 30kg and the battery (a 12V 36ah item) 15kg, it meant a spare could be carried and still not exceed the 60kg maximum of the new regulations.\n\nMeanwhile, Wood Rogers had found his first suitable electric motor – originally envisaged for a truck cooling fan. However, the Bosch item was replaced by an Italian item, unfortunately from a company that also manufactured washing machine motors – something the press quickly picked up on…\n\nIt was hoped that a 20-mile range was possible from a single charge, boosted by using the ‘push and coast’ system of driving. Quite simply you accelerated, eased off the (electric) throttle, coasted then accelerated again.\n\nThe launch\n\nSinclair Vehicles launched the C5 on Thursday, 10 January 1985 at Alexandra Palace in London. (Home of the first TV transmission in November 1936 by the BBC). The following day, the C5 made the front page of most national newspapers, followed by the invitation for the public to try the C5 over that weekend. Over 100 Electricity Board showrooms had a C5 on display to tantalise consumers.\n\nSinclair and Wills were upbeat during the press conference in which six C5s burst out of packaging on stage and circled the arena. A development film then showed the C5 being tested and, amongst the more sensible sales patter, rather bizarrely Wills informed the journalists present that the seating position was based upon that of the Ford Capri! The press pack also made much of the fact that the driver’s eye level in traffic was comparable to the Mini, but with a turning circle two thirds of Mini’s – not an amazing boast.\n\nIt was anticipated that over 100,000 vehicles could be produced in 1985, creating 200 jobs, and that as of 10.30am that day (during the press conference), it was confirmed that precisely 2507 C5s had been constructed so far. It was announced in addition to Hoover’s maintenance back up electrical retailer Comet had won the contract to handle replacement battery sales, with Woolworths additionally waiting in the wings. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents was represented too, assuring the press of the C5’s safety and handing out fact sheets.\n\nThe advertising plans for the new C5 were outlined, the main thrust of the £3m advertising campaign being TV commercials (even though the UK had just two commercial stations at the time.)\n\n‘Imagine a vehicle that can drive you five miles for a penny; a vehicle that needs no petrol, just a battery; and that takes the press of a button to start, the squeeze of a lever to stop. That needs no licence, no road tax, and you can drive it whether your 14 or 40. A vehicle that costs just £399. The Sinclair C5 is a new power in personal transport. The Sinclair C5. £399. Want to buy one? Or simply want to read all about it? Just dial 100 and ask for free phone C5 – NOW.’\n\nPersuasive stuff indeed. Final thanks were given to all the companies who had supported the project, then the floor was open to questions before the obligatory test drives. The overall response was all rather favourable – so, what went wrong?\n\nThe dream discharges\n\nDespite claimed orders approaching a 1000 units for the first week, and 5000 sales for the first month after launch, in reality approximately 7500 C5s were sold by Sinclair Vehicles – an impressive figure were it not for the additional 4500 unsold C5s.\n\nThough available direct (with a crafty £29 delivery charge added to the £399 retail price) by the summer of 1985 Comet stores were offering C5s with free delivery. On 13 August, Hoover announced it was to cease production of the C5 due to the stock pile of unsold units. A last ditch attempt by Comet to retail the C5 at a slashed price of £139.99 (delivered to your doorstep) in September did little to stop the Receivers being called on 12 October.\n\nTotal debts at the point of liquidation were £6.4m, (Hoover’s debt alone standing at £1.5m). In an effort to recoup some cash the remaining 4500 C5s were sold by the Liquidators but, as manufacture was outsourced, nothing much else existed to offset the debts.\n\nThere are many theories to the downfall of the C5, but perception and price remain the two fickle favourites. Worthy as electric transport was in 1985, the world was not ready to save the planet – but it could justify a front loading video recorder with remote control, or a compact disc player. If you needed personal transport, a new bicycle was just 20% of the C5’s purchase price, and people didn’t stare at you on your way to work.\n\nTherein lied problem number two – possibly the reason behind the C5’s downfall. Nobody dared be seen struggling to propel a C5 uphill with articulated trucks inches from your torso. Combine that with quizzical stares and finger pointing of the bemused general public and your pool of purchasers narrows considerably.\n\nSadly, the C5 was a visionary idea that just appeared in the wrong century.\n\nWords: Andrew Elphick Pictures: SinclairC5.com unless otherwise indicated."
