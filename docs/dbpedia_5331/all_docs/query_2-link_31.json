        "text": "Inside the showroom, clients are greeted by a contemporary and comfortable environment providing a sense of refinement and calm, where they can focus entirely on the vehicles – a stylish display of 12 models from the latest Range Rover, Defender, Discovery and Jaguar collections.\n\nConveniently located just off Junction 45 of the M4 motorway, the five-acre site features a drive-in service reception; barista-style café bar; as well as various seating areas where visitors can relax, or continue with their working day with use of the complimentary wi-fi.\n\nAmongst the facilities, is a personalisation suite where clients can view the various options available on their new luxury car to help visualise it and bring it to life. The site also boasts two dedicated handover areas to provide clients with a one-to-one introduction to their vehicle and its controls when it is ready to collect.\n\nThe striking facility has been constructed with sustainable and environmental considerations very much in mind. Built with a thermally-efficient shell and solar panel, the showroom has relocated two miles from its previous location at Valley Way on Swansea Enterprise Park. The site has preserved the biodiversity in the surrounding habitat too, by creating new wetlands and landscaping which will see more than 3,000 shrubs and trees being introduced over the forthcoming planting season.\n\nAndy Sinclair, Sinclair Group Managing Director, said: \"This is a flagship retail facility that is undoubtedly one of the finest of its kind in the UK and we're so grateful to all involved in creating such a magnificent premises.\n\n\"State-of-the-art and second-to-none in every respect, it is a development that will not fail to impress visitors and enables us to enhance our service offering to even greater heights, delivering an unrivalled experience, befitting of the Jaguar Land Rover brands”.\n\nThe advanced aftersales facilities and expert team will ensure all clients’ servicing, maintenance and repair requirements are taken care of. As well as 18 workshop bays, two of which are dedicated for MOTs, the Swansea operation is the first in the Sinclair Group’s network of 30 retailers to feature a drive-in service reception. Here, clients can conveniently drop off their car for a workshop appointment, while remaining undercover and protected from the elements. Entering via one of two lanes, their vehicle passes over a tyre tread depth indicator and is filmed by a 360-degree high-definition camera, enabling a partial health-check to be completed before the engine has been turned off.\n\nStrengthening its sales offering, Sinclair Jaguar Land Rover Swansea has expanded its Approved Used provision of expertly selected, previously-owned vehicles. Increased parking has also been factored into the development for ultimate conveniency - 380 spaces are now available, 24 of which are equipped with charging stations.\n\nNicky Boyce is the Head of Franchise for Sinclair Jaguar Land Rover, which includes Swansea and its sister sites in Aberystwyth, Brecon and Ludlow. He explained that, after months of anticipation, he is thrilled that the flagship premises is now open.\n\n\"Every time I visited the site during its construction, I was blown away by the progress and to see its transformation has been remarkable,\" he said. \"Our Swansea team has done an amazing job in driving the business forward since our acquisition in 2018 and they can now come to work every day in a premises that is the epitome of modern luxury which they can be proud of.”\n\nSimilar sentiments were echoed by Jamie Callan, Sinclair Jaguar Land Rover Swansea’s Head of Business, who oversees a 68-strong team that has been bolstered with 22 new staff ahead of the move to Swansea Vale.\n\n\"With the more curated approach to displaying model collections, our move is exciting and perfectly timed,” said Jamie. “We can't wait to welcome clients both old and new and show them around the outstanding facilities they now have at their disposal.\n\nRob Stewart, Swansea City Council Leader, was thrilled that an empty area of land had been brought back into use by the new Sinclair Jaguar Land Rover development.\n\n“The council has a strong record in supporting our business community in making Swansea a great city to live, work and thrive in so I'm pleased that we've been able to play our part in regenerating this area in Swansea Vale in partnership with the Welsh Government,\" he said.\n\n\"It's pleasing to see that such a long-standing Welsh business like the Sinclair Group is continuing to show confidence in investing in Swansea and that Jaguar Land Rover, a globally renowned brand, continues to be represented in a superb facility in the city.\"\n\nThe new Sinclair Jaguar Land Rover Swansea showroom is based on Riverside Business Park, Swansea Vale, SA7 0AP.\n\nThe transformation was constructed by design and build contractor, Jones Brothers (Henllan) Ltd.\n\nThe new Sinclair Jaguar Land Rover premises are situated on a plot to the east of the River Tawe and close to some former colliery workings which were filled 15 years ago by the Welsh Government in partnership with the land owners, Swansea City Council, in preparation for future development."
