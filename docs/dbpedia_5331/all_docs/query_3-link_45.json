        "text": "We are pleased to announce that Camp CAR 2024\n\nwill be held the week of July 15-19!\n\nApplications for 2024 are now closed!\n\nWe received a record number of applications and heartily thank everyone who applied this year.\n\nAll applicants will be notified of Camp CAR admission decisions by the end of April 2024.\n\nFor questions or inquiries about Camp CAR 2024, please send an email to CAR's Outreach and Engagement Specialist,\n\nJennifer Humphrey (she/her/Ms) at humphrey.113@osu.edu.\n\nCamp CAR is a free*, weeklong summer day camp for students ages 14-18/high school freshman, sophomore, junior or senior, rising college freshman/gap year.\n\nParticipants gain hands-on experience related to various aspects of automotive research, engineering and mobility including simulation, testing and manufacturing. Participants will also have the opportunity to (informally) tour The Ohio State University campus and visit local automotive research facilities.\n\n- Note that Camp CAR focuses on engineering principles related to the automotive industry, such as autonomy, electrification, and engineering design and testing. It does not focus on automotive maintenance or driving skills.\n\nGeneral information on Camp CAR\n\nAll applications we receive are reviewed after the closing deadline (late March), by our 12-member Camp CAR Team (most of whom are current CAR graduate students). This means, all applications submitted between February 1 and March 18 are read & scored after March 19.\n\nNote that Camp CAR focuses on engineering principles related to the automotive industry, such as autonomy, electrification, and engineering design and testing.\n\nOur camp does not focus on automotive maintenance or driving skills.\n\nThe application is ‚Äúeasy‚Äù, with the most detailed ask being an at-least 200 word ‚Äúessay‚Äù on why the student in interested in our camp.\n\nWe do humbly ask that the student complete the essay and yes, we can almost always tell when it‚Äôs the parents or guardians who have submitted the essay üòä\n\nWe do not ask for teacher recommendations or any external paperwork like class transcripts or anything like that.\n\nThe application will ask for an email/mobile for both the student and a parent/guardian, and each will be copied on the notification email.\n\nNOTE: in 2023, we received 115 applications (from 23 US states and 4 countries).\n\nIn 2023, welcomed 26 campers from 14 U.S. States and 2 countries!\n\nWe endeavor to send out all notifications by the end of April and we do notify each applicant regardless of outcome.\n\nThe general hours are 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. each weekday, during the week of camp.\n\nWe accept a maximum of 24 students for our free*, week-long, in-person camp. The maximum is based on staffing requirements, as well as space limitations for our activities.\n\nIf our only option is virtual programming, we will be able to accept up to 500 virtual campers.\n\nWe accept students from anywhere but we are unable to provide housing or oversight for your camper outside of camp hours.\n\nIf your student is accepted, we provide housing suggestions as well as fun things to do in Columbus while you are with us.\n\nFun fact: Columbus is within 500 miles of 50% of the US population and we have one of the best zoos in the world, featured on the Nat Geo Wild show, Secrets of the Zoo.\n\nOur camp includes continental breakfast, lunch, all-day snacks and non-soda beverages each day, as well as transportation to/from our building to any field trips.\n\n*We are able to make our camp free-of-charge through the generosity of donors, as well as program grant funds.\n\nNote that we are unable to provide housing (either on-campus or off-campus) for campers and families, and are unable to provide oversight of campers outside of the camp hours.\n\nWe are happy to recommend accommodations for out of town guests.\n\nOur camp is fully compliant within the State of Ohio and The Ohio State University guidelines with regard to care, custody and concern of minors.\n\nThis includes each Camp Staffer being fingerprinted, background checked, and trained, prior to the start of camp. We take everyone's health and safety very seriously!\n\nFor more information or to be added to our Camp CAR mailing list, please contact CAR Outreach and Engagement Specialist, Jennifer Humphrey (she/her/Ms) at humphrey.113@osu.edu. Thank you!\n\nOther opportunities for camps, programs, degrees:\n\nOur camp does not focus on automotive service or maintenance, but our friends at Columbus State Community College and Sinclair Community College both offer degrees in those areas.\n\nFor more information on other outreach opportunities at The Ohio State University for pre-college aged students, please visit The Office of Academic Affairs' list at https://oaa.osu.edu/other-osu-precollege-programs.\n\n(Updated 03.19.2024)\n\ndouble-arrow Related Stories\n\nJuly 25, 2024\n\nFueling Curiosity\n\nJuly 26, 2021\n\nHigh school students experience hands-on on automotive engineering first hand at Camp CAR\n\nJuly 30, 2020\n\nCamp CAR 2020 Goes Virtual\n\nJuly 30, 2019\n\nCAR Introduces High School Students to Automotive Engineering"
