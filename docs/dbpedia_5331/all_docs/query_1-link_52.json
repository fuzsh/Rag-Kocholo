        "text": "Before Sinclair was founded, branding for fresh produce was limited to the boxes carrying the fruits and vegetables. The individual items themselves carried no labels. So, Sinclair’s founding team filed for patents and developed the first food-safe labeling systems for individual pieces of produce.\n\nSinclair was started in 1982 in the UK, and is now owned by American firm, Gulftech. The two main hubs of their global network are located in Fresno and Norwich where the high-speed label-making machines are assembled and provided to customers to form part of the total labelling solution. The main product - fresh produce labels, are made in 10 locations around the world and Sinclair also have numerous other offices globally for agents to provide localised sales, support and servicing.\n\nSinclair is one of several food-related businesses that share a corporate parent, agricultural investment firm Gulftech. A few years ago, the firm tasked Sinclair’s IT team to provide technology services to all the firm’s subsidiaries.\n\n“Our parent company wanted to standardise the IT communications environment across all the businesses in its portfolio,” explains Ian Hamilton, Sinclair’s Global IT Manager. “Because we’re a global organisation, as are several of Gultech’s other subsidiaries, that meant finding a global cloud telephony solution.”\n\nGiven the challenges Ian and his team were facing with Sinclair’s legacy phone system, they were thrilled to be on the hunt for a new solution. “Our on-prem system was 35 years old, dependent entirely on desk phones and telecom carrier relationships, and a complete pain to use.”\n\nAnd just as Ian’s team began researching the cloud communications industry, COVID struck.\n\n“In those early days, we had to send our office staff home, which meant business phones were ringing and there was no one to answer,” Ian explains. So the IT team accelerated its search for a cloud solution.\n\n“RingCentral proved the best partner really from day one. The sales team was the most responsive of any vendor we reached out to. The implementation team made the rollout incredibly smooth—probably the most seamless technology implementation I’ve ever seen. And our experience with the RingCentral support team has been consistently brilliant.”\n\nAs Ian points out, Sinclair’s employees immediately began experiencing the benefits of an anywhere, any-device business phone solution. “Because RingCentral is internet-based, our business communications follow us anywhere we need them to. Whether our employees are in an office, at home, or traveling, they can still have their business lines and stay productive.”\n\nFrom an administrative perspective, Ian explains, RingCentral also significantly improved the company’s operations. “We could never master our old on-prem system. Even routine changes like adding or changing users required submitting a ticket to the provider… and waiting. With RingCentral, we can do it all ourselves, easily, from anywhere. If I need to replace someone on our reception call queue with another employee, I can do it online in seconds.” When support is needed, Ian was impressed with the speed of response, “RingCentral’s support is so responsive that at times I’ve found it shocking. I remember going online, logging a ticket, and literally having someone calling me as I was closing out of the system. I answered that call by saying, ‘Wow. Really? Already?’”"
