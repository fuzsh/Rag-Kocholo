For certain securities that are not rated by any of these three agencies, credit ratings from other agencies may be used. Where the rating agencies rate a security differently, Lord Abbett uses the average rating based on numeric values assigned to each rating. Ratings range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). Bonds rated BBB or above are considered investment grade. Credit ratings BB and below are lower-rated securities (junk bonds). High-yielding, non-investment-grade bonds (junk bonds) involve higher risks than investment-grade bonds. Adverse conditions may affect the issuer's ability to pay interest and principal on these securities. A portion of the portfolio's securities may not be rated. Breakdown is not an S&P credit rating or an opinion of S&P as to the creditworthiness of such portfolio. Ratings apply to the credit worthiness of the issuers of the underlying securities and not the fund or its shares. Ratings may be subject to change.\n\nPortfolio Positioning as of 06/30/2024\n\nWe continued to be overweight B-rated credits. The Fund remained overweight allocation to Bs relative to the benchmark, while underweight BBs. We believe that exposure to lower-rated credit currently offers the best relative value given the overall strength of the economy. While we are still constructive on credit in general given the resilience in the U.S. economy, we increased the Fund’s exposure to BBs towards the latter end of the quarter as a reflection of economic data that was softer than expected.\n\nWe favor cyclical sector exposure, specifically overweight allocations to Energy and Basic Industry sectors. Despite softer economic data, we remained constructive in cyclical sectors such as Energy and Basic Industry as a result of improved credit quality and stickier inflation. Within Energy, we remain focused on E&P and Oil Field Services subsectors, but with a shift in focus towards offshore energy as an attractive opportunity to find relative value. Within Basic Industry, primary overweights continued to be Metals and Mining and Chemicals, which continued to benefit from meaningful destocking of inventories over the last several months. The Fund also continues to be overweight sectors such as Financial Services and Banking. Conversely, the Fund finished the quarter underweight sectors such as Leisure, Capital Goods and Real Estate.\n\nThe Fund maintained modest exposure to off-benchmark sectors. We generally believe that select exposures to non-high yield sectors can offer attractive risk-reward opportunities, potential portfolio diversification benefits, and avenues for liquidity. While the Fund has the flexibility to toggle allocations to off-benchmark asset classes, such as bank loans and convertible bonds, we continue to view high yield corporate bonds as relatively attractive compared to other sectors.\n\nWe view short duration high yield as an opportunity to capture quality carry. We remain constructive in short dated high yield credit considering the overall health of the U.S. economy, relatively open capital markets and benign default rate outlook. Additionally, fundamentals for high yield issuers have been robust with leverage and interest rate coverage remaining at supportive levels. However, we acknowledge that the presence of higher policy rates for longer may lead to headwinds for certain high yield bond issuers, highlighting the importance of sound credit selection within the portfolio. Looking towards the second half of the year, we remain focused on maintaining a cyclical approach in the portfolio with emphasis on commodities, consumer cyclicals, and sectors with supportive underlying asset valuation that could allow for ongoing addressing of near-term maturities. However, we look to be more dynamic with our positioning given the potential for market fluctuations in response to some of the softer than expected macroeconomic data of late, including segments of rising consumer stress.\n\nPORTFOLIO DETAILS as of 07/31/2024\n\nTotal Net Assets\n\n$5.16 B\n\nAverage Effective Duration\n\n1.91 Years\n\nAverage Maturity\n\n3.64 Years\n\nNumber of Issues\n\n780\n\nAverage Yield to Maturity\n\n8.38%\n\nTo view definitions for the above Portfolio Details, Click here.\n\nYield to maturity (YTM) represents the expected total return on a bond (expressed as an annualized rate) based on the bond’s expected future cash flows, including coupon payments over the life of the bond and the bond’s principal value received at maturity.\n\nAverage Maturity - The length of time until the average security in a portfolio will mature or be redeemed by its issuer in proportion to its dollar value. Indicating a portfolio’s sensitivity to general market interest rate changes, a longer average maturity implies greater relative portfolio volatility.\n\nAverage Effective Duration - The change in the value of a fixed income security that will result from a 1% change in interest rates, taking into account anticipated cash flow fluctuations from mortgage prepayments, puts, adjustable coupons, and potential call dates. Duration is expressed as a number of years, and generally, the larger a duration, the greater the interest-rate risk or reward for a portfolio’s underlying bond prices. Where applicable, certain investments, such as common or preferred stock, convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock, ETFs, ADRs, and CPI swaps and related futures, are excluded from these calculations.\n\nHolding Coupon Maturity Assets\n\nRakuten Group Inc 9.750% 04/15/2029 0.7% PetSmart Inc / PetSmart Finance Corp 7.750% 02/15/2029 0.7% Venture Global LNG Inc 9.500% 02/01/2029 0.6%
