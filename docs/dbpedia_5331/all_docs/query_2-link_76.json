        "text": "Chuck Sinclair, Goodyear’s senior vice president of global communications, will retire March 1. Sinclair has held the position since June of 2003.\n\n\"I want to thank Chuck for his great 26-year career at Goodyear. He has been an outstanding business partner and valued member of the Goodyear team,\" said Rich Kramer, chairman, president and CEO. \"Chuck is a trusted friend and advisor to all of us, and we will certainly miss him. We all wish Chuck and his family the best for their future.\"\n\nChuck joined Goodyear in 1984 as plant public relations manager at the company’s Engineered Products plant in Lincoln, Neb. He relocated to corporate headquarters in 1987 as publications editor, and he was named public relations manager, general products in 1990. He was named manager of public relations for North American Tire in 1992 and manager of public affairs in 1993. Chuck became Goodyear’s manager of national media relations in 1995, and director of public relations for North American Tire in 1997. In 2002, he was named vice president of public relations and communications for NAT.\n\nPrior to joining Goodyear, Sinclair was a sports reporter and columnist for the Journal and Star newspaper in Lincoln.\n\nUntil a successor is named, Joe Ruocco will serve as acting senior vice president of global communications, in addition to his current role as senior vice president, global human resources."
