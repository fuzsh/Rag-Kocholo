        "text": "Disclosure: This page contains affiliate links. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases. Thanks for your support.\n\nBorn on July 30th 1940, Sir Clive Sinclair was a British inventor and entrepreneur who became best known for the hugely successful ZX Spectrum home computer and the infamous C5 electric tricycle. But they are only a tiny part of the whole story, and in this post, I’m going to take a look back at his best and worst inventions, some hugely successful and others ill-conceived. They all had one thing in common, though, they were all pretty unique and British to the core!\n\nSir Clive started out as a journalist, and one of his first jobs was as the assistant editor at Instrument Practice magazine. He then started writing for Practical Wireless, using the funds to help launch a mail-order company selling radio kits from his bedsit in London.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPocket Radios and Hi-Fi Systems\n\nOn 25 July 1961, Clive launched Sinclair Radionics Ltd., the company’s first product being the Sinclair Micro-amplifier.\n\nIn 1963, he introduced the Sinclair Slimline to the range, a kit-form radio.\n\nIn 1964, the X-10 amplifier was launched, one of the first switching (Class-D) amplifiers. However, a problem with its output transistors shorting led to a huge number of customer complaints, and the product was scrapped.\n\nAlso, in 1964, the company launched the Micro-6, which was marketed as “the world’s smallest radio.” With the transrista accessory, it could be worn like a watch and was roughly the size of a matchbox.\n\nIn 1965, “the world’s first pocket-sized FM tuner-receiver” was one of Sir Clive’s earliest failures. Technical problems and illegal clones made in the Far East led to its quick demise. Undeterred, the company launched yet another miniature product, the Micromatic Pocket Radio. This made reasonable profits for the company, and by 1972, it was raking in close to $100,000 in profits. It was marketed as the “World’s smallest radio.”\n\nIn 1966, Sinclair Radionics released its first hi-fi, the Stereo 25. However, when their supply of bulk-bought transistors ran out, the product was replaced by the Stereo 60 in 1969. This was the company’s most successful hi-fi and was part of the Project 60 range. A Project 60 kit was also released in 1972, with the more advanced Project 80 kit in 1974.\n\nDespite venturing into the world of hi-fi, the company’s backbone was its scientific instruments, and in 1974 it launched the DM1 digital multimeter.\n\nDigital Calculators\n\nIn 1972, the company entered the world of electronic calculators, switching its focus to building low-cost, pocket-sized calculators.\n\nThe Sinclair Executive was its first model, with a launch price of £79.95 (low cost for a calculator but still a huge sum for the working classes), and it was the world’s first slim-line pocket calculator. Its functions were basic, but its portability (you could run it on batteries and fit it into your pocket) made it hugely attractive, and it made £1.8 million profit for the company. The LED display, however, was a power drainer, which meant you needed a good supply of batteries.\n\nIn 1973, a cheaper release of the Executive was launched, as was a second model, the Sinclair Cambridge, which was available ready-built or in kit form for just £29.95. In 1977, the “scientific programmable” Mark 2 Cambridge was launched for just £17.22.\n\nThe Sinclair Oxford calculator range was released in 1975 and 1976, and the high-end Sovereign also launched in 1976, which featured a silver or gold plate coating. Although it was short-lived, it proved to be a huge success.\n\nTwo further models were released, the Sinclair Enterprise and President, although these were commercial failures.\n\nThe Black Watch\n\nAnother Radionics failure was the Black Watch digital watch. It was launched in 1975 and featured a five-digit red LED display that only lit up when the surface was pressed.\n\nHowever, it proved to be a disaster for the company, with the watch itself being unreliable and innacurate with a poor battery life of just 10 days, they were also very fiddly to replace. The LCD display was also difficult to see in daylight, and the kits proved to be too difficult to make for the average hobbyist. The circuitry was also over-sensitive to static shock.\n\nThe company also struggled to fulfil orders and almost went bankrupt through this product. It was saved by the Labour government’s National Enterprise Board (NEB).\n\nSinclair Radiophonics was left with a stockpile of unsold watches, so it cleverly launched the Microquartz car clock in 1977, which used the circuitry from the watches, and they actually sold quite well.\n\nSinclair FM Radio Watch\n\nCreating a radio small enough to wear on your wrist was no easy feat back in the 1980s, and it proved to be extremely costly to develop for many electronics companies. Sinclair Research launched its prototype FM Radio Watch in 1984, which featured an integrated speaker in the centre and a built-in aerial.\n\nHowever, it ate into Sinclair’s finances a little too much, and just 11,000 were made. Personally, I think it would have looked a lot nicer without that speaker and just some earphones!\n\nMicrovision Mini TVs (Microvision)\n\nIn 1966, Sinclair Radionics developed the world’s first portable television, the “Microvision“. However, due to the high production costs involved, it wasn’t launched until some ten years later in January 1977, as the Microvision MTV1A and MON1A with a price tag of £99.95. It proved to be another loss maker for the company, losing around $480,000, and 12,000 unsold units had to be sold off at a greatly reduced price for a loss.\n\nThe 1977 launch came after the NEB bought a 43% share of the company for £650,000 in 1976, and the National Research and Development Council injected £1,000,000 into the funds to rekindle the Microvision TV project.\n\nUndeterred by the loss, the company tried again with the MTV1B in 1978, but sales proved disappointing once again.\n\nTV80 (FTV1)\n\nClive Sinclair was certainly a trier, and despite his previous TV product failures, he decided to launch the TV80 in 1983 with his company, Sinclair Research. The flat-screen pocket TV (also known as the FTV1) was, once again, a commercial failure, and the flat CRT technology was already considered dated by many critics, who noted that Casio was developing LCD technology. 15,000 units were sold, which did not cover the £4 million investment.\n\nZX Home Computers\n\nZX80\n\nThe entrepreneur entered the home computer market in 1980, starting with the ZX80, the cheapest home computer to be sold for under £100. It retailed at £99.95 ready-built or just £79.95 in kit form. At this time, Clive’s company was named Science of Cambridge Ltd. Around 50,000 units were sold in total.\n\nZX81\n\nIn 1981, the company became Sinclair Research, and in March, they launched the ZX81 for £69.95 ready-built or £49.95 as a kit to assemble yourself. The computer was much more successful than its predecessor, selling 1.5 million units.\n\nZX Spectrum\n\nIn 1982, Clive Sinclair decided to buy and convert Baker and Wadsworth’s mineral water factory in Cambridge into his new headquarters. He also bought Milton Hall in the village of Milton, Cambridgeshire, to develop his new computer, the ZX Spectrum.\n\nIt was launched on 23 April 1982 and went on to become Britain’s best-selling microcomputer, selling around 5 million units worldwide. The Spectrum featured huge improvements over the ZX81, with 16kb entry-level RAM and a colour display.\n\nAlong with its biggest rival, the Commodore 64, the Spectrum helped to create a boom in the computer gaming and software industry and continued to be built until 1992.\n\nSinclair QL\n\nIn 1984, Sinclair launched a higher-spec version of the Spectrum. The QL was marketed to more serious home computer enthusiasts, professionals and small businesses, with a launch price of £399.99. However, it never really captured the public imagination, and just 150,000 units were sold.\n\nZX Spectrum +\n\nIn 1984, plans were laid out for a new and improved version, the ZX Spectrum +, which was launched in October with a retail price of £179.95. It featured an improved injection-moulded QL-style keyboard. The price was dropped to £129.95 in 1985, and the original ZX Spectrum with the rubber keys was discontinued.\n\nZX Spectrum 128\n\nIn 1985, Sinclair started working on a new computer for the Spanish market and released it as the ZX Spectrum 128.\n\nCambridge Z88\n\nThe Cambridge Z88 was based on Sinclair’s Pandora project and launched on 17 February 1987 by Clive Sinclair’s Cambridge Computers company. It was about the size of an A4 sheet and featured an in-built application called Pipedream, which included a word processor, spreadsheet, and database.\n\nThe machine has since gained a cult following. It’s powered by four AA batteries, although if you’re lucky, you will only get around 20 hours of use out of these! A PC link accessory could be bought, which allowed the user to connect it to a PC computer and back up the data. It features a pretty clear LCD display with eight lines.\n\nSinclair C5\n\nSinclair Vehicles was founded in March 1983 with an investment of £8.6 million, and the former DeLorean manager Barrie Wills was appointed as managing director. Despite this, just one vehicle was manufactured, the ill-conceived C5.\n\nWas it an electric tricycle or an electric car? Well, nobody was quite sure, and this uncertainty was just the start of its problems. The C5’s short range (20 miles if you were lucky!), lack of speed (max 15mph), lack of weatherproofing, and safety concerns all contributed to its notorious failure.\n\nIts small size and flimsy looks were significant problems. Being so low to the ground gave a feeling of vulnerability, making it ideal only for anyone who enjoyed the risk of being crushed by an HGV!\n\nThere was a dramatic, glitzy launch at Alexandra Palace in London, with oodles of promotional products (hats, mugs, T-shirts etc.) and attractive females bursting out of boxes. Unfortunately, many of the demonstration models didn’t work (the C5s, not the females!), with a Guardian newspaper reporter experiencing a flat battery after just seven minutes. It was, quite frankly, a disaster!\n\n14,000 were made, but just 5,000 were sold, despite a tempting price tag of £399. Sinclair announced that “sales have not been entirely up to expectations” – the understatement of the year!\n\nNonetheless, the C5 has since gained a cult following, with owners creating highly modified vehicles, adding big wheels and more significant electric engines, achieving speeds of up to 150mph!\n\nThat’s it! I hope you enjoyed discovering or rediscovering Sir Clive Sinclair’s many inventions."
