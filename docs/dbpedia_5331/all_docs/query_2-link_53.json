        "text": "The Sinclair Group has been operating since 1945 and ever since then we have taken enormous pride in the way we have treated our colleagues with the utmost Respect and Trust which is one of our distinctive values. We invest in and are committed to developing the careers and skills of our colleagues to be the best they can be and also to recruit the best people into our business regardless of gender.\n\nLike all motor trade businesses, we have traditionally been a male dominated environment, however as times have changed and as the company has grown we have improved our diversity and inclusion.\n\nAs an industry the Motor Trade workforce has a 19% female representation.\n\n2017 2018 2020 2021 2022 Total employees 880 894 990 827 858 Males employed 650 667 740 623 638 Females employed 230 (26%) 226 (25%) 250 (33%) 204 (25%) 220 (26%) Female Managers 20 27 27 22 21 Female Sales Execs 25 18 17 13 21 Female Technician Apprentices 3 3 3 1 2\n\nThis report outlines our results on Gender Pay Gap. As outlined in the legislation, the calculations have been done on people employed on a snapshot date of April 2022.\n\nThe pay gaps reported are driven from the fact that there is a greater proportion of male employees in the more senior and well-paid positions and also those roles that tend to attract higher bonuses such as Sales Executives and Technicians. As can be seen from the figures above we have made strides in recent years to increase the number of females in these roles and will continue to do so.\n\nPay gap differences do not indicate an equal pay issue, separate to this reporting requirement we constantly check and maintain pay equality of equivalent jobs to ensure that pay and bonus payments are fair to all. Where there is disparity of pay in the same job this is due to levels of skill, qualification and experience rather than any other contributing factor.\n\nThe information below relates to the total employees in the Sinclair Group.\n\nThe Mean Pay Gap shows the percentage difference in average pay between males and females when you look at hourly rate plus bonus pay\n\nThe Median Pay Gap is the midpoint between the highest and lowest paid again showing the percentage difference males and females.\n\nFigures were calculated for pay during April 2022 based on an hourly rate of salary plus bonus."
