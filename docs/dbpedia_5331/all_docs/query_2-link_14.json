        "text": "Sinclair’s Sustainable Slicker Solution\n\nRepresenting a host of prestigious brands including Audi, Jaguar Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, Sinclair’s 25-strong network of retailers expertly service and maintain the vehicles of thousands of motorists each year and its busy workshops generate a wide range of waste streams, including used oil, oil contaminated absorbents, oil filters and antifreeze. Slicker Recycling provides a comprehensive, sustainable management solution for all these waste streams, helping to reduce carbon emissions and achieve zero-waste-to-landfill but also an industry-leading, carbon efficient solution.\n\nUnder the new partnership, the significant volumes of used oil generated by the service departments will be managed responsibly at Slicker’s state-of-the-art re-refining facility, where it is processed back into a base oil product. This product will then be sold back to the lubricant market, where it is blended with other components to produce brand-new lubricating oil - a sustainable approach to managing used oil that is quite unique in the industry. Many other service providers process the used oil they collect into either a low-grade Processed Fuel Oil (PFO) or Gas Oil, both of which are burnt as a carbon-emitting fuel in the marine and energy sectors.\n\nWhen compared to PFO producers, Slicker Recycling is helping the Sinclair Group to save almost 59,000 kg of carbon each year, and as much as 102,000 kg of carbon, when compared to gas oil producers. By simply switching to Slicker Recycling, the Group has achieved huge carbon savings that will make a real impact in the combat against climate change – a development that Maria Drane, Group Purchasing Manager, is delighted about.\n\n“Sinclair Group is committed to a new sustainable direction, looking at ways we can reduce our carbon footprint, and make positive environmental changes,” said Maria. Thanks to our partnership, Slicker Recycling has made it easy for us to achieve an immediate and significant reduction of our carbon footprint. Simply by switching to Slicker for our hazardous waste management, we are contributing to a sustainable circular economy and greatly reducing our emissions with ease.”\n\nSean Thorpe, National Sales Manager at Slicker Recycling added: “It is great to be working alongside the Sinclair Group, who are as committed to responsible, sustainable business practices as we are. We are happy to help them on their carbon reduction journey, and through our innovative, carbon-cutting approach they have made outstanding progress.”\n\nNine senior representatives from the Sinclair Group undertook a bespoke training course at the National Botanic Garden of Wales in Llanarthne, Carmarthenshire, where they gained a better understanding of the impact of greenhouse gases and the effects of climate change together with an appreciation of the company's own footprint and the influence this has on the local environments around its 21 dealerships and much further afield. They are the first business in Wales to engage with the Carbon Literacy Project at a senior management level and the only motoring group so far.\n\nThe Sinclair Group represents a number of motor manufacturers that are already taking significant strides towards an emission-free future with the electrification of their vehicle ranges. By 2025, Audi will offer more than 20 models with all-electric drive and estimates around 40 per cent of its sales will be for electrified models, whilst by the same date, Mercedes-Benz will produce electric-only vehicles as it gets ready to go all-electric by 2030. Meanwhile as the decade draws to a close, Volkswagen intends to have increased the share of its all-electric vehicle deliveries to more than 70 per cent across Europe.\n\nFrom Brecon to Neyland, Sinclair employees are also making a difference following the appointment of 'eco-champions' at each site to co-ordinate colleague suggestions for green initiatives that can be introduced across the Group.\n\nAs a result, solar panels have been installed on the roofs of 10 of the Group's dealerships to convert the sun rays into electricity. The company has also switched its energy supply to providers using renewable sources. Other ideas include the introduction of meat-free Mondays to encourage staff to opt for vegetarian/vegan options at the start of each working week, the use of china cups in showrooms instead of plastic or paper alternatives to reduce waste levels and the installation of recycling stations in every location.\n\n\"In partnership with the manufacturers, we recognise that as a retailer we have a responsibility to do all we can to best protect our environment and offset carbon. It is our aim to see an 80% reduction in our carbon footprint by 2035 and to be carbon neutral as an organisation by 2050,\" said Andy Sinclair, Sinclair Group's Managing Director.\n\nHe added: \"We want to inspire our staff to understand climate change, their role in it and to take positive action at home and at work. That way we can make a positive difference together.\"\n\nDuring their training session, the Sinclair Group received a virtual visit from the Carbon Literacy Project to share the actions resulting from their day of learning with over 30 other leading UK businesses participating in similar events around the country.\n\nCynnal Cymru has trained over 600 people since they first introduced Carbon Literacy in Wales in 2017. Up until now, they have primarily provid- ed this type of training for the leadership of local authorities but this is the first time that a course has been delivered for the executive of a leading Welsh business.\n\nLead trainer and Principal Consultant, Rhodri Thomas, explained: \"It's not easy for executive teams to find the time to ask for training. It shows a level of humility, but it is also bold. In fact, it's a sign of true leadership - being willing to learn in order to improve, innovate and ultimately succeed.\n\n\"The Sinclair Group recognises that this is a hugely significant moment for the motor industry. We must stop using fossil fuels petrol and diesel, but can we really expect people to give up the convenience and freedom of personal mobility? We are on the verge of a revolution in transport and the Sinclair Group wants to lead the way by providing solutions for customers but also ensuring that their own behaviour is exemplary. Carbon Literacy is the perfect tool for bringing about this profound change in business culture.\"\n\nThe National Botanic Garden of Wales provided a fitting location to host the landmark event.\n\n\"It was great to welcome the Sinclair Group to the Botanic Garden and help celebrate a real 'first,\" said Director Huw Francis. \"We were delighted they chose us as the venue for their milestone 'seize-the-day' moment.\""
