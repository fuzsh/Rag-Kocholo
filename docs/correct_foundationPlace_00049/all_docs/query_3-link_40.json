        "text": "\"SAAS-WIFI\" will utilize your SAAS credentials to gain you access to the internet. This will not affect any aspects of our internet access, it is exclusively a change to how we authenticate users on our network. This new system allows Tech Staff to better manage and troubleshoot issues on our wireless network and is more secure than our old pre-shared key system.\n\n1) When you click connect on SAAS-WIFI, you will be redirected to a SAAS-branded webpage that looks like the screenshot below. Depending on your device -- PC, Mac, iOS or Android device -- how this page populates may be different, but the page will be the same for everyone. For all of us, we will use the \"Sign In Here\" button not the Register button (nor the form fields preceding it).\n\nYou'll be redirected to a Google Sign-in page; if it gives you the option to login with an already saved account, make sure you use your SAAS account; if there isn't a saved account, just enter your SAAS credentials. Note that this is a Google sign-in and you will most likely be required to enter a 2 factor authentication code if your login is not already saved on your device, so have your phone handy. Once you login, you'll be redirected to the Seattle Academy homepage and from there you can browse to any site or service you need.\n\nAs of now, this is a one-and-done login per device; in the future, based on our ever evolving cyber security landscape, this may change and users may be required to login more periodically, but for now it will stay this way."
