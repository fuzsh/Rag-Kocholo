        "meta_description": "We consider the observation and analysis of oceanic rogue waves collected within spatio-temporal (ST) records of 3D wave fields. This class of records, allowing a sea surface region to be retrieved, is appropriate for the observation of rogue waves, which come up as a random phenomenon that can occur at any time and location of the sea surface. To verify this aspect, we used three stereo wave imaging systems to gather ST records of the sea surface elevation, which were collected in different sea conditions. The wave with the ST maximum elevation (happening to be larger than the rogue threshold 1.25H s) was then isolated within each record, along with its temporal profile. The rogue waves show similar profiles, in agreement with the theory of extreme wave groups. We analyze the rogue wave probability of occurrence, also in the context of ST extreme value distributions, and we conclude that rogue waves are more likely than previously reported; the key point is coming across them, in space as well as in time. The dependence of the rogue wave profile and likelihood on the sea state conditions is also investigated. Results may prove useful in predicting extreme wave occurrence probability and strength during oceanic storms.",

        "text": "Observation of rogue waves in space and time\n\nIn this study, we investigate five ST wave records collected using three different stereo wave imaging systems deployed at stations in the Pacific Ocean (near Station P), Adriatic Sea (Acqua Alta platform), and Black Sea (Katsiveli platform) during active wind conditions. The examined sea states have both uni- and bi-modal distribution of energy (Figs 1 and 2), with significant wave height H s ranging from about 0.5 m to 4.6 m (Table 1). The omni-directional frequency f spectrum S(f) for each record is shown in Fig. 2 (left panel), including also the modeled spectrum at the time of the Draupner rogue wave event3. Albeit three out of the five directional spectra (namely SP2, AA2 and BS1 in Fig. 1) show a well defined bi-modality of the energy distribution, only the waves within the record BS1 present two clearly distinct modes in the spectrum S(f) at frequencies about 0.18 Hz and 0.41 Hz (left panel of Fig. 2). All energy distributions show an equilibrium range with slope proportional to f −4, in accordance, for example, with the Kolmogorov-type energy cascade caused by the resonant four wave-interactions32, or the model of the equilibrium range by Phillips33.\n\nTypical result of the stereo-photogrammetric processing is a 3D wave field (Fig. 3) representing the sea surface elevation z over an horizontal region Ω ∈ ℜ2 with area A, i.e. z(x, y), where x = (x, y) denotes the coordinate vector. The collection of multiple fields stacked up over the time span D of the stereo-image acquisition produces a ST record of sea surface elevations, i.e. a function z = z(x, y, t), spanning both spatial and temporal domains. In search of rogue waves we avoid to detect the largest wave groups37, but instead we search the global maximum sea surface elevation z m = max{z(x, y, t) | (x, y) ∈ Ω, t ∈ D} within each ST record. This global maximum is considered as one realization of the random variable “maximum crest height”. The marginal temporal profile z(t) of the maximum waves is extracted from z(x, y, t) at the position (x 0, y 0) ∈ Ω where z = z m (Fig. 4). All these maximum waves are rogue (Table 1) as they meet the classical geometric criterion z m > 1.25H s 38, with roguish strength γ RW = z m/H s ranging between 1.34 (record BS1) and 1.60 (record AA2). The crest-to-trough height H m of the waves is larger than 2.2H s (H m > 2.2H s is an alternative criterion to characterize rogue waves) except for the record BS1, for which H m = 1.7H s. For comparison, the rogue wave measured at the Draupner platform on 01/01/1995 has z m = 1.55H s and H m = 2.15H s 21, 39.\n\nThe temporal profile of rogue waves\n\nFor all ST rogue waves, including the Draupner event, Fig. 4 shows the actual temporal profiles ad hoc scaled with the corresponding integral parameters of the sea state H s and average zero-crossing period T z (on the left panel), and with the local wave parameter z m (on the right panel). The waves preceding and following the central one of the groups exhibit relatively small and random elevations, which begin to be narrowly concentrated around a deterministic profile for z > H s (or about 0.65z m). Indeed, the difference among the rogue wave profiles between the instants crossing the level z = H s is in the order of 2% for the rising face and 5% for the falling face of the characteristic wave periods. We note that for elevations z > H s all profiles are asymmetric with respect to z m, and positively skewed, that is the front steepness is higher. This is also the case for the Draupner wave, along with the likewise famous Andrea rogue wave39, which has, however, a steeper front crest, which is slightly detached from the others profiles (Fig. 4). No specific relationship between the minimum elevation of troughs preceding and following z m is observed. In the context of 3D wave fields, we note that, as the Draupner and Andrea waves were isolated as global maxima in a time record, it might also be that nearby the measurement point the sea surface elevations were even larger (as shown in the right panel of Fig. 3, and in Fig. 4 of Donelan and Magnusson40).\n\nThe existence of a predictable (in a stochastic sense) ST shape of high ocean waves is not novel per se. Indeed, the expected shape of large 3D wave groups can be estimated, for example, using the Slepian Model Representation41 or the Quasi-Determinism (QD) theory42,43,44, which, for a Gaussian wave field z 1(x, y, t) with variance σ 2, state that the average shape η 1 of the highest waves scales with the ST autocovariance function ψ(X, Y, τ) of z 1(x, y, t). That is,\n\n$${\\eta }_{1}={z}_{{\\rm{lm}}}\\frac{{\\psi }(X,\\,Y,\\,\\tau )}{{\\sigma }^{2}}$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere z 1m is a large maximum of the sea surface elevation field, X = (X, Y) is the 2D horizontal vector and τ the time lag measured from the absolute maximum of ψ. An example of the average 3D shape of the rogue waves is shown in Fig. 5, where the observed shape is compared with the prediction based on the ST autocovariance function at the focusing time, i.e. ψ(X, Y, 0). Albeit the former is estimated with few realizations and the latter is valid for Gaussian fields, the empirical and the theoretical 3D shapes share common features (e.g., the short-crestedness), as observed by Forristall45 using numerical simulations.\n\nAt the spatial position (X, Y) = (0, 0) of the apex of the 3D group development, the autocovariance function is paired (via Fourier transform) to the omni-directional frequency spectrum by the following equation\n\n$$\\psi (\\tau )={\\int }_{0}^{\\infty }S(\\omega )\\cos (\\omega \\tau ){\\rm{d}}\\omega $$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere ω = 2πf is the cyclic frequency, and we set ψ(τ) = ψ(0, 0, τ) for simplicity.\n\nFor the sea states analyzed in this study, Fig. 6 shows the normalized linear profiles \\(\\psi (\\tau )/\\psi (0)\\), which are symmetric around the maximum elevation. Likewise to the observed profiles, for large elevations the theoretical profiles are very similar to each other. This result is expected for sea states with energies that present an equilibrium range, which would guarantee the Froude similarity between the sea states43. The presence of a secondary spectral mode seems not to influence the largest elevations, while it has an effect near the troughs (see the flatter troughs of the BS1 profile shown in Figs 4 and 6, and, for comparison, Figure 4.9 of the textbook by Boccotti41), in dependence on the position of the secondary peak with respect to the principal one. The theoretical shape given in Eq. (1) is distorted by the inclusion of higher-order harmonics, with a dominant contribution expected by the phase-locked second-order bound nonlinearities7, 8, which produce waves with higher and sharper crests and shallower more rounded troughs (Fig. 6). In the context of the QD model, the apparent asymmetry of the observed profiles shown in Fig. 4 might indicate that all the groups were not at the focusing point, although the limited extension of the sea surface covered by the stereo systems does not permit to draw a firm conclusion on this aspect. Analyzing the same stereo records collected near Station P, Schwendeman and Thomson46 observed an asymmetry near the crest of the breaking waves, that the authors connected to the crest tilting effect of waves prior to reaching the peak of the group.\n\nHow likely are rogue waves in space and time?\n\nBecause the rogue waves described in the previous sections have been isolated from ST records, the question arises as to the occurrence probability of these extreme events and the appropriate statistical approach for describing their likelihood. The first implication of treating rogue waves as local maxima in space as well as in time is that, when examining a sea surface 2D region Ω wider than a single position P ∈ Ω, a larger number of rogue waves is found. This evidence can be inferred from the right panel of Fig. 3, in which the random positions where the sea surface elevation exceeds the rogue wave threshold 1.25H s are highlighted: looking at the wrong place, we would not see any rogue wave. Indeed, watching for maxima over a 2D region we may relax the hypothesis of uniformity of the wave field. As a matter of fact, the actual short-crestedness (see for instance the large crest visible in the left panel of Fig. 3, and the 3D shape in Fig. 5) and the wavenumber/direction dispersion of the 3D wave groups make wave maxima larger and more numerous when they are sought over an area A > 0, rather than on a point19, 47. In other words, it is unlikely that unsteady 3D wave groups focus at (or close to) a specific point P 19, 34.\n\nAs a matter of fact, analyzing a long series of single-point field measurements, Christou and Ewans2 established that only one every 145 20-min sea states contained one rogue wave, implying that these waves occur rarely, on average once every about ∼33000 waves (a recent study by Gemmrich and Thomson15 revealed similar statistics analyzing time records at Station P), consistent with the Tayfun model8 prediction of the probability that nonlinear crest heights exceed 1.25H s. In this respect, a key finding of our study is that at least one wave whose crest height exceeds 1.25H s was observed within the ST records, which contain on average less than 12000 individual 3D waves (Table 1), the minimum (N 3D ~ 400–600) being for the two records collected near Station P. The actual number of rogue waves is even higher, as we expect that more than one rogue event occurred within each ST record. Indeed, in a thorough analysis of the record AA1, Benetazzo et al.47 revealed as many as 23 rogue events belonging to independent 3D waves over a ST region containing on average 10830 waves: one rogue event every ~ 500 waves.\n\nIn search for a short-term statistics explaining the rogue waves observed within the ST records, we rely on the study of Fedele35, who derived an asymptotic extreme value distribution (based on the Euler Characteristic approach)48 of maximum crest heights occurring in a ST Gaussian field. This topic has been investigated also by Piterbarg36, whose method was successfully applied to the estimation of maximum wave crests45, 49. For weakly nonlinear random seas dominated by second-order nonlinearities, the Fedele’s solution was extended by Benetazzo et al.47 using the Tayfun8 model. This theoretical approach was validated using the sample of 23 rogue waves taken from the record AA1. For the five sea states considered here, we show in Fig. 7 the Gumbel-like probability density function (pdf) fitting the ST extreme nonlinear model by Benetazzo et al.47. We note that each observed crest height z m lies within the 99% confidence interval of the respective distribution.\n\nThe implication of the high (and larger than 1.25H s) modal values of the pdfs for records AA1, AA2, and BS1 is that, in those sea conditions, the probability to find a rogue wave within one realization of the ST record would be practically equal to 1. For the records SP1 and SP2 the probability would be smaller than 1, about 0.2, as a result of a relatively small area A compared to the average wave and crest lengths. These theoretical probabilities of rogue wave occurrence are considerably high, at least one order of magnitude larger than the ones obtained excluding the spatial contribution (i.e. imposing A = 0) in the distribution of the random variable “maximum surface elevation”.\n\nThe physical mechanism underling the distribution of ST extremes and thus contributing to the formation of rogue waves is the constructive interference of elementary waves50, with a significant role played by the wave dispersion51. The coming into phase of different frequency components responsible of localized dispersive focusing has already been recognized2, 52 as a mechanism responsible for rogue wave generation in generic storm conditions. The fundamental enhancement due to nonlinearities53 is limited to the contribution of second-order bound harmonics, as the effect of third-order nonlinearities is expected to be small1, 54, and thus the role of the modulation instability is limited.\n\nSea state conditions\n\nThis section discusses whether the temporal profile and the distribution function of rogue waves are linked to the sea condition at the time of their acquisition. The study of a deterministic model connecting the rogue wave development to the sea state conditions has not been fully explored. In the context of rogue wave generation through nonlinear focusing due to third-order quasi-resonant wave-wave interactions, Waseda et al.55 found that during freakish sea states the directional spreading is narrower. However, Fedele et al.1 justified oceanic rogue waves excluding the nonlinear focusing, and Cavaleri et al.3 suggested the presence of two large crossing wave systems being responsible for a large probability of occurrence for rogue waves at the time of the Draupner event. On the top of this, Christou and Ewans2, analyzing a large dataset of measurements, concluded that the existence of rogue waves within a time record is not governed by the sea state (such as the nonlinear parameters steepness, skewness, and kurtosis) or environmental conditions (such as the directional spreading).\n\nTo inspect this aspect of the problem, we examine the characteristic sea state parameters of the ST wave fields (Table 2). The observations include seas with mean wave steepness μ (computed as in Fedele and Tayfun56), ranging from low (μ = 0.04 for the record BS1) to mild values (μ = 0.06 for the records AA1 and AA2). The bandwidth parameter ν 57 embraces values typical of active sea conditions, around 0.50 for all records. The sea states have energies differently distributed over directions: the one-sided directional spreading σ θ is smaller than 30° for records SP1 and AA1, whilst the largest spreading σ θ = 66° is for the record BS1. All the sea states were indeed short-crested, having ~1 the short-crestedness parameter γ s 58, which we interpret as the ratio between spreading of the waves in the wavenumber domains k y and k x (assuming the x-axis coincident with the mean direction of wave propagation, and the y-axis orthogonal to it).\n\nThe effect of second-order and third-order nonlinearities on the likelihood and shape of rogue waves can be quantified using the skewness (λ 3) and kurtosis (λ 4) coefficients. In particular, λ 3 describes the effects of second-order bound nonlinearities, and λ 4 include the dynamic component due to third-order nonlinear interactions and a bound contribution8, 11. Among the ST records, a large variability is found for both these parameters: the maximum value of the skewness λ 3 = 0.16 is for records AA1 and AA2 (for which we should expect a larger effect of second-order nonlinearities), while the maximum contribution of third-order nonlinearities would be expected during the record SP2 (for which λ 4 = 3.27). We note that large skewness and kurtosis coefficients for the Draupner event (reported in Table 2) are misleading, as the evaluation of both coefficients is biased by the presence of a very high wave in a single time record59.\n\nA major contribution to the pdf of ST extreme nonlinear crest heights is given by the steepness of the sea state: the larger μ, the less peaked the pdf (Fig. 7). As a matter of fact, for a given pdf of linear ST extremes, the density function of nonlinear ST extremes is more narrowed around its modal value in those sea states for which the effect of nonlinearities is expected to be smaller. On the other hand, strong nonlinear conditions spread extremal waves over a wider range, and, as it is expected, shift crest heights towards larger values, making rogue waves more likely. In this, our results integrate the study by Christou and Ewans2, as these authors limited the analysis to time records of sea surface elevations."
