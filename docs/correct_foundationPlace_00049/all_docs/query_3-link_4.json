Our outreach and activities would not be possible without the thousands of volunteers who make our work possible. Managing the multitude of individual volunteers and volunteer projects has its own difficulties, but also incredible rewards. Tailoring structure, communication, and instructional materials for each type of volunteer and project is key for keeping a well run volunteer empire. We will explore this tailoring through the lens of some of the largest and smallest volunteer projects that the Free Software Foundation facilitates.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe talk will focus on three particular aspects of the work that Free Software Foundation volunteers provide to the world, going into detail about how the scope and nature of each project requires different tools in managing.\n\nMassively Multi-Volunteer On-line Projects: The GNU Project\n\nPublished Instructional Materials\n\nVolunteers as leaders: GNU Project Maintainers\n\nLowering the cost of contributing: make the process simple\n\nSpecial Ops: The GPL License and Compliance Lab team\n\nInternal documentation\n\nVolunteers as shepherds: Preceptors of the Queue\n\nMaintaining close-knit communications\n\nThe Walk in: turning one time volunteers into long term collaborators\n\nHaving tasks (and their instructions) ready for new volunteers\n\nHaving task progression - simple one off actions up to long running projects\n\nMaintaining contact and enthusiasm\n\nHow you can help - join the FSF volunteer empire\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nDonald is an attorney, and speaks on free software legal issues and activism. He handles copyright assignments and GPL compliance at the FSF. Previous talks include:"
