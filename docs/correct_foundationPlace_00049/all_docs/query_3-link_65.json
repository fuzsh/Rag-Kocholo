        "text": "Giving securities is one of the most effective ways to give from a tax planning perspective. Giving publicly traded securities to Seattle Colleges Foundation that were purchased over a year ago and have increased in value can be an especially attractive way to fund a donation. A donor may benefit from a charitable deduction equal to the value of the securities. In addition to the tax deduction, capital gains tax is not due on gain in the donated securities.\n\nMake a gift of securities\n\nIn-kind gifts – such as equipment, software, machinery, vehicles, tools, or services – are another way to give. Such gifts intended for use by any of the Seattle Colleges require approval by the receiving program/department dean or director and the college president before they can be accepted by the foundation. If you would like to discuss making an in-kind gift, please contact us to see if our programs are a good match.\n\nIn-Kind Donations\n\nPlanned giving, sometimes called legacy giving, allows you to make a contribution benefiting generations to come. Most often, a planned gift takes the form of a bequest in a donor’s will or living trust. Other planned giving opportunities include the donation of stocks and securities, real estate, retirement account balances, and life insurance. To maximize your gift’s impact, we will guide you through the process. Contact us to discuss your options. We recommend you consult with your legal and financial advisors to learn how planned giving will affect you.\n\nRead our Planned Giving Brochure\n\nTypes of Planned Giving and Related Options\n\nPlease note, the link above takes you to an external website maintained by Sharpe Group"
