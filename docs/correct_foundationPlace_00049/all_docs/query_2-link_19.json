Within the storefronts, fresh produce and flowers – a network of social services are woven throughout the historic district from child care and health care to a food bank and senior housing.\n\nThe Market Foundation supports the social services and the Market community through grants and Community Impact Programs by:\n\n• Providing annual, unrestricted grants to the Market’s five social services, including Neighborcare Health at Pike Place Market, Pike Market Senior Center & Food Bank, Heritage House at the Market, and Pike Market Child Care & Preschool.\n\n• Operating The Market Commons, a resource hub for anyone in the Market neighborhood to access support services and community activities.\n\n• Sustaining the Market Community Safety Net to help Market farmers, merchants, social service clients, and residents who need temporary assistance when faced with hardship.\n\n• Supporting the new COVID-19 Small Business Fund to help farmers, craftspeople, and small business owners adapt to new economic conditions created by the pandemic.\n\nLearn how you can support the Pike Place Market Foundation’s efforts below."
