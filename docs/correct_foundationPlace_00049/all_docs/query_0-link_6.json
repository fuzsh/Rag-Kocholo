One advantage we have is our own Seattle-based staff, who know and love the city. In putting together the 12-page report that begins on page 52, Northwest Editor Steve Lorton called on all 13 people who work in our Seattle office. Thank them for the personal insights. How else would we know to ask Cookie Cohen to show us geoducks at Pike Place Market? Or that PacificFirst Centre has a museum-quality glass display? For a different perspective on downtown, Lorton recruited his 10-year-old son, John, and some friends. Their favorite attractions? They nominate the ferry ride to Winslow, the underground tunnels, and the Kingdome.

SUf ET Country strains pour forth from guitar of stage iriver John Jenkel at lunch break on picturesque trip deep into rural Sonoma's Black Bart country New stagecoach tour of Black Bart's rural hangouts lolling into the wooded ravines of west- ern Sonoma County, the stage feels high and creaky but rides easily on its all- eather suspension. The driver lifts his whip very slightly, and the horses' muscu- ar brown backs flow forward in front of you, like a dark river channeled by the ong leather lines. Laughter lifts from the passenger compartment. But the old Concord coach is entering country haunted by an elusive outlaw, a ||former Wells Fargo employee who calls himself Black Bart. Though he makes travelers tremble, Bart has an oddly courtly way about him. Materializing on foot by the side of a stage road, a flour sack over his head, he demands only that the driver \"throw down the box\"; he will never accept a lady's purse. And once his robbery is accomplished, he offers some- thing in return: a scrap of poetry com- posed for the occasion. Wells Fargo may have been relieved long ago of its 19th-century highwayman nem- esis, but a 19th-century stagecoach again travels his favorite Sonoma route — with a barbecue lunch, wine tasting, and coun- || try-western concert to fortify passengers j against the apparition's possible return. The day outing is a new offering from Wine Country Express, which already runs winery-by-stagecoach tours in the region. John Jenkel (a Stanford engineer and the trip's horse handler) and Ray Roe (a country singer and man of many trades) have developed this experience around a fascination with the career of northern California's most legendary out- law. The enthusiasm is contagious, and historians say the research is accurate. At 10 a.m., you meet at Duncans Mills. You're taken by van to Black Mountain. From there, you ride the stagecoach 14 m les on Meyers Grade (overlooking a SFPTEMBER 1991 PETtK CHRISTIANSEN deep, redwood-crowded gorge and passing the fateful pepper tree that marks Black Bart Turn) — and rumble back into Dun- cans Mills in time for a \"dust-cutting libation\" at the Black Bart Tavern. Cost is $98 per person. Trips are offered Sep- tember 1 and 7, and by arrangement other days; call (707) 887-7589. A month of solo performance on three San Francisco stages September 4 through October 13, San Francisco highlights a form of theater distinctly at home in this individualistic town. Solo Mio, a festival of solo perform- ance, brings together an attention-worthy lineup of writer-performers. San Francis- co has long been hospitable to a kind of stylized autobiographical monologue that might have gone unnoticed by audiences that require more glitzy \"production val- ues.\" Fans here are willing to respond to the authority of the first-person voice, in a setting expressed by a few symbolic ges- tures and filled in with the imagination. The better-known soloists will perform in Fort Mason at the Cowell Theater and at Life on the Water, a theatrical workshop formed as an expressive vehicle for artist- producers like Bill Talen, Solo Mio's or- ganizer. Other artists will appear on the smaller stage of Joegh Bullock's Climate Theater, south of Market at 252 Ninth Street. The performers all share commit- ment to the intensity of personal narra- tive. \"I believe in personal confession,\" Talen says. \"It's an antidote to the media saturation of our society.\" Spalding Gray, the festival headliner, per- forms Monster in a Box (a three-month hit in New York) September 12 through 15 and 19 through 22.

The front lines in Sausalito: shipbuilding effort in WW II A new permanent exhibit. Marinship 1942 1945. is on view at the San Francis- co Bay Model. It documents the wartime conversion of 210 acres of quiet tideland in northern Sausalito into an instant ship- yard where, in three years, 93 vessels 1 5 Liberty ships, 16 Navy oilers, and 62 tankers — were hastened into existence as part of the post-Pearl Harbor war effort. When the government asked W.A. Bech- tel Company to create this amazing mari- time assembly line, most skilled laborers were already in service elsewhere. There was no choice but to enlist greenhorns. Of the 75,000 men and women who worked Bow art expressed Marinship s patriotism. Each shipfront got its individual scene — overpainted before vessel entered action PETER CHRISTIANSEN at Marinship, 90 percent were completely inexperienced. \"This exhibit is about peo- ple moving to a place they'd never seen, doing a job they never imagined,\" says Bay Model manager Daphne Derven. The training program was massive, and the recruits learned quickly. Three months after ground breaking, the keel for the first Liberty ship was laid. Produc- tion rose to a peak average of one ship every 13 days. And during the war, not one structural problem was ever discov- ered on any Marinship vessel. The adversity-inspired construction school became an opportunity for women and racial minorities, who received equal pa\\ for equal work. (As might be expect- ed, the tone of the instant assimilation sometimes wavered: the shipyard pub- lished advice to female welders on how to tie a head scarf so as to protect \"the crowning point of a woman's allure\" against the hazards of flying sparks.) Videotaped reminiscences by former workers convey a vivid sense of what the uartime experience was like. In addition, a 16-minute film, made during the yard's operation, illustrates the collective effort necessary to fabricate a tanker; viewers will feel a thrill as torches cut the cables to free the finished ship from its slide and let it \"come to life\" in the water. The Bay Model, at 2100 Bridgeway, is open, free, 9 to 4 Tuesdays through Satur- days; call (415) 332-3870. Anglers gather at Tahoe to trade insider information Practitioners of the quiet art of fly-fishing have an unusual opportunity to hone their skills and learn from the often-taciturn masters of their craft September 13, 14, and 15 at Kings Beach, on Lake Tahoe. Whether you're an inexperienced neo- phyte or a wily fly-caster, you're welcome to A Festival of Fly-fishing, offered on a \"once every few years\" basis by the Northern California Council of the Fed- eration of Fly-fishers — a sporting organi- zation that has done much, with its em- phasis on catch-and-release fishing, to preserve the fishery as a resource. Conservationist Bud Lilly, an acknowl- edged guru of fly-fishermen, will be the keynote speaker at a dinner Saturday night. Author Rick Hafele will present an entomological perspective, creating a \"liv- ing stream\"; setting up an aquarium situ- ation, he collects aquatic insects and helps fly-tiers and fishermen study the crea- tures and their movement patterns so as to mimic them more effectively. Commercial suppliers will provide d that participants can test in a casti pond (but bring your own equipment fi actual fishing); more than 20 specializi demonstrations and clinics will take pla over the three-day period. You might juj acquire that flick of the forearm thi looks like pure instinct but results froi much learning. Register at the festival site, the Nortj Tahoe Community Center, at 8318 Nortj Lake Boulevard in Kings Beach; admii sion is $20 for individuals, $30 for fam lies.

Three Bay Area swim-walks Some outdoor exertion can feel good on hot day; plunging afterward into fres cold water can feel even better. We'1 collected three good walks — in Marin, tl East Bay, and the Peninsula — that r ward late-summer hikers with a swin ming-hole splashdown. Both Tilden ar Memorial parks have changing rooms. In Point Reyes National Seashore. Cool, spring-fed Bass Lake is the destination here, a shivery silver splashdown — possibl) from a rope swing that appears and disappears at a lakefront tree. Start at the Palomarin Trailhead: driving northbound c State 1, take Olema-Bolinas Road (the fin left after Audubon Canyon Ranch) west t< Mesa Road and follow it to its end. Walk north along a coastal route that can feel breezy by the ocean but much warmer jus inland, where rock walls radiate the heat. You reach the lake in less than 3 miles; don't be deceived by several small ponds you pass first. An almost-concealed path leads left from the trail through low willox to a convenient swimming access. Or take more obvious route toward the firs along the southwest shore; from it, several spurs branch off to feasible launching areas, and one to a descent consisting of a series of retaining walls.

From Wildcat Canyon Road south of Lake Anza, take Central Park Drive north, then follow Lake Anza Road to lakeside parking. Walk across the spillway and head north about a mile on Wildcat Gorge Trail, along a bay- shaded canyon with steep, cave-riddled cliffs; go east and then south about 1 Vi miles, mostly through chaparral, on Canyoi Trail (with a detour to Inspiration Point, if you choose); then return west to the lake o Curran Trail.

Breaker -broken Big Sur coastline stretches south from Garrapata Stale Park. Hikers on Whale Peak trail eye cove for sea otters bobbing among kelp beds Quintessential Big Sur just 10 miles south of Carmel Kl M i n NS We'll get the bad news out of the way first. Garrapata is Spanish for \"tick.\" In the 1830s, explorers pushing along the Big Sur coast gave the name to a canyon and creek where the diminutive nuisances thrived. The name lives on in Garrapata Creek, and in the nearby coast and hills set aside as Garrapata State Park. Is there anything else unflattering to say about Garrapata State Park? Nothing comes to mind. Ten miles south of Car- mel, California, Garrapata gives you the quintessential Big Sur experience, though in fact it lies a little north of what some people consider the true Big Sur. Pacific breakers thunder against broken cliffs, rafts of sea otters bob in kelp beds, and redwood-shaded canyons thread through September's sun-bronzed hills. As for the garrapatas, they can be found in the inland portions of the park, but in no more bothersome profusion than in many other wild areas of California, and Fern grotto, shaded by redwood trees, lies near end point of Soberanes Canyon Trail this month doesn't fall within their pe season. A seaside walk to Whale Peak . . . Long used for cattle ranching, Garrapat became a 2,800-acre state park in 1983. doesn't look much different from how did in its cattle days, and many an residents want to make sure it stays thi way. Last year, when the state park syi tern announced tentative plans for moi intensive development, local oppositio) was fierce enough to send the plannei back to their drawing boards. As it stam now, Garrapata allows only day use, ail lacks facilities other than trail signs am portable toilets. The absence of a parking lot or officii park entrance means you have to be alei as you drive south from Carmel on Stall Highway 1. In about 9xh miles, you'll so) signs for the park. Watch for turnout! these bear signs with numbers so smat you'll have to stop your car to read therm Park at turnout 1 3 (on the west side of thl highway) or 14 (on the east side). From turnout 13, trails lace west acroJ the bluffs to Soberanes Point ana around — and up — Whale Peak. Durinl the fall and winter months, point and peal are favored spots for watching migrating gray whales; this time of year, you'll prob< ably have to content yourself with sell otters (the park lies near the northern end of the California Sea Otter Game Ref- uge). Tidepooling is also good, but shouldl be done with great respect for the wave! that bash these cliffs. Garrapata is used by two special-interest! groups. Rock fishermen like to try theii luck for greenlings and surfperch (a Cain fornia fishing license is required). And the sheltered northern and southern section!! of the park's beach draw nude sunbathers (One Bay Area publication recently named Garrapata best nude beach ill northern California.) More open to the elements, the middle section tends to rl quire a bathing suit, if not a windbreakei) and long pants. . . . and into the hills From turnout 14, two trails run east int(| the interior of the park. The easier 1 '/: [ mile (one way) Soberanes Canyon Trail pokes along Soberanes Creek to a small grove of redwoods; watered by the creell and by the fog that creeps up the canyonl they're a verdant surprise in these chaparf ral-clothed hills. More difficult becaus<| it's steeper is the Rocky Ridge Trail; in \\ miles (one way), it climbs 1,500 feet t<| views south to Point Sur, north to Monte f rey Peninsula.

Why. then, dally in Oakhurst? Here are a few reasons: logging flumes and log cabins, and Charcoal Grilled Bro- chette of Quail with Loganberry Madeira Jelly and Rosemary Sauce. If you can reserve a few hours on your way to or from Yosemite, the park's southern gate- way—50 miles north of Fresno, 20 miles south of Wawona — holds some surprises. Dog trot cabins . ... Admittedly, Oakhurst doesn't present its best face to the traveler. The main drag, State Highway 41, is one of those thor- oughfares where what isn't a gas station is a fast-food stand. But a quick detour brings you to Fresno Flats Historical Park, where volunteers have moved and restored 10 venerable buildings from the Madera County foothills. Docents are on hand to show you through them. Our favorite is probably the 1869 Taylor Log House, a \"two pen dog trot log cabin.\" Another charmer is two-story Laramore- Layman House, built in the 1870s. Near- by stretches a section of the flume that slid milled lumber on a 54-mile journey from the Sierra to the Central Valley. The park is open 1 to 3 Wednesdays through Saturdays, 1 to 4 Sundays; entry is $2, $1 children. From State 41 in Oak- hurst, take Road 426 east, then School Road (Road 427) north 1 mile to the park (on left). For details, call (209) 683-6570. 20 . . . and gourmet dining Seven years ago, Vienna-born Erna Kubin-Clanin chose an Oakhurst hillside as the site for a restaurant modeled on her favorite country dining spots in Provence. The cuisine she and German sous-chef Christian Mueller have created at Erna's Elderberry House — French-influenced, with creative use of seasonal California ingredients — has drawn kudos from food writers on both coasts. A six-course prix fixe dinner ($45) is served from 5:30 to 8:30 Wednesdays through Mondays, a prix fixe luncheon ($14.50) from 11 to 1:30 Wednesdays through Fridays, and brunch ($20) from 1 1 to 1 Sundays. You can eat inside, in one of the three tapestried dining rooms named for famous chefs (Bocuse, Escof- fier, and Point), or outside on a pine- shaded flagstone patio. Erna's is on Victoria Lane, off State 41 just south of central Oakhurst. For reser- vations (advised), call 683-6800. If you're looking for lodgings to match your meal, Kubin-Clanin has opened the nine-room Chateau du Sureau (French for elderberry), with rooms for $250 to $350 a night.

The trees kept loggers busy until the turn of the century. When the area was finally logged out, San Franciscans came for holidays among the giant stumps and sec- ond-growth trees. After World War II, motoring tourists aimed farther afield, and the area drifted into desuetude. In the late '70s, however, a river renais- sance began, led largely by San Francis- co's gay community. Today the area at- tracts all sorts of urban dwellers as a conveniently close getaway (l'/i hours north of the Golden Gate Bridge). Comfortable country inns hark back to the river's heyday. On weekends, the three we list serve dinner as well as break- fast, so you never have to leave the pre- mises if you just want to watch the river flow.

MICHAKL SCANNEll Backed by smashing views of the Golden Gate, volunteer atop Marin's Hawk Hill tracks migrating raptors, helps visitors spot and identify birds like the golden eagle fright), with massive beak and tawny head Here come the hawks In the Bay Area, where to watch the big migration \"Birds of prey know they're cool,\" says a Gary Larson cartoon showing eagles wearing shades and headphones. Among viewers, hawks are hot, and the best place to see them now is the Bay Area. In fall, some 16,000 hawks of 19 species cross the Golden Gate in the West's largest hawk migration. Last year, peregrine falcon and HPH (hawks per hour) sightings were up at Marin's Hawk Hill, where nonbirders can become aficio- nados by listening to \"hawk talks.\" They can also learn birding with the help of experts, or attend classes (new this year). Or try four other Bay Area migration- watching hills, all with dazzling vistas. Funneling down from as far as Alaska, hawks mass over Bay Area peaks en route to southern feeding grounds. Scientists know little of the birds' final destinations. Migration peaks mid-September to mid- October, with up to 500 hawks daily. Best viewing is between 10 and 2 as hawks soar and glide on midday thermals. Stay 24 home when it's foggy or rainy — the birds don't seem to migrate then. Bring binocu- lars and a field guide. Don't-miss migrants You may see Cooper's, red-tailed, or rough-legged hawks, kestrels, and more. These rare birds are worth waiting for: Golden eagle. The largest migrant, it has 90-inch wingspan. Dark brown. Slow wingbeats; glides with wings nearly hori- zontal. Peregrine falcon. Medium body; short, pointed grayish wings; and buff breast. Wide, dark mustache mark and black hel- met are tip-offs. Noted for fast flight and steep, dramatic dives after prey. From Hawk Hill to Russian Ridge At Marin Headlands, in Golden Gate Na- tional Recreation Area (GGNRA), Hawk Hill offers dramatic views of the city and Golden Gate Bridge. Go early for easiest parking; bring a picnic. Avoid Fleet Week, October 12 through 17, when jet flybys disturb migration. In September and October, you can listen to a hawk talk at 10 on Wednesdays an< at noon on Saturdays, or watch bird banding at 2 on Saturdays. August 19 through December 15, volunteers help you learn about and identify hawks be- tween 10 and 4 daily. Activities, spon- sored by Golden Gate Raptor Observa- tory (GGRO) with the GGNRA, are free (rain or fog cancels).

BMW engineers have always believed that the best way to survive accidents is to avoid them in the first place. Which is why the dramatically new 3-Series is equipped with some rather ad- vanced\"active safety\" systems. Including a high-performance, 24-valve,189-horse- powerengine.Twin-circuit antilock brakes. Responsive steering. And a patented sus- pension that offers greater stability and handling in emergency maneuvers. Yet, in the event of an unavoidable accident, BMW's\"passive safety\" features intervene instantaneously on your behalf. Hydraulic, regenerating bumpers help absorb the energy of impact. Seat belts automatically tighten their grip in a frontal impact.Three sensors trigger the driver's- side airbag. Even the doors are unlocked to assist occupants in escape or rescue. More reassuring still is the fact that the new 3-Series also offers a 4-year/50,000- mile bumper-to-bumper warranty* Along with a Roadside Assistance Program that will rally to your side at any time, on any road in the continental United States!* Both of which act to safeguard you from unexpected expenses. If the thought of such a car intrigues you, we invite you to visit your local autho- rized BMW dealer for a thorough test drive. It could very well be one of the safest trips that you ever take.

The Smith will re- lain undammed, no new mining claims /ill be allowed, and logging in the ancient forest will be sharply cut back. Smith Liver NRA sets aside some 1 18,000 acres )f old-growth forests east of Crescent rity — more, experts estimate, than could lave been bought under California's de- feated Forests Forever initiative last year. |The new NRA, administered by Six Riv- ers National Forest, also benefits the an- Icient trees of neighboring Jedediah Smith [Redwoods State Park, protecting against lerosion and siltation of their upstream Jwatershed. After 1990's heated old- growth debates (see \"Old Growth,\" page 54 of the August 1990 Sunset), this vic- tory has gone surprisingly unheralded. From the gentle redwood giants in Jed Smith at the new NRA's west side to the steep canyons and rushing Whitewater at its eastern boundary, the Smith River country offers a more varied landscape than you'll find in the more famous par- cels of Redwood National Park south of Crescent City. With maple and dogwood leaves gilding the ridges and salmon fish- ing starting to pick up, the gorge makes a good fall destination for a warm hike or picnic, a bracing swim, or a scenic drive.

Botanically diverse, these ridges contain incense ce- dar, Port Orford cedar, tan oak, madrone, white fir, redwood, and Douglas fir — the last two in impressive old-growth stands.

Smith River N.R.A. 52v Pyramids show campgrounds open year-round; more are open in summer of rain yearly, so go prepared for rain). Two visitor centers help unlock the area. The national forest office in Gasquet has maps and trail information; hours are 8 to 5 daily (weekdays only after October 15). A few miles west, Hiouchi Visitor Center, open 9 to 5 daily, has a picnic area and bookstore. Challenging fishing, rugged hikes It's rough country, so don't expect trails to be perfectly groomed — and watch for poison oak. Carry a Forest Service map and check conditions. Cautions: some cars have been broken into on remote roads; lock up, and take valuables. Deer hunting On a gravelly bar above a bend in the Smith River's middle fork, picnickers catch wind off the water 27 BbN DAVIDSON Granite gorge at Goose Creek access on Smith River's south fork offers a challenge for rock scrambling opens September 21, but it's not popular in the recreation area because of the diffi- cult terrain: ask the ranger station what trails to avoid. Mountain bikes are per- mitted on roads only: dogs are permitted, but in camp they must be on leash. Fishing. License required; two-fish limit. Check ahead for possible closure due to low water by calling (707) 457-3131 or 445-6493 weekdays. Salmon generally run September through December, steel- head December into March. Steelhead are famously wih and elusive, so be pa- tient. Drift boat fishing is best from Hiou- chi downstream. Boat ramps are slated to open in Jed Smith Park and at the nearby forks of the Smith. For a list of guided drift boat trips (about $250 per day for two), call Pacific Coast Guides Associa- tion at (707) 458-3577. Hiking. Myrtle Creek Trail: 3A mile one way; easy. This nature trail (new free guide) passes 1890s mining pits and a flume ditch; you'll see five-finger ferns, threatened California pitcher plant. Park off US. 199 at the west end of Myrtle Creek Bridge and use care crossing the highway. Craigs Creek Trail: 3% miles one way; moderate. Hike up through live oak and tan oak, and past huckleberry bushes into a few old-growth redwoods and then knobcone pine before angling down to a river view point. Park at the Second Bridge on South Fork Road. South Kelsey Historical Trail: 16 miles one way; moderate to tough. This 1850s military supply route is fairly level for the first 7 miles, then climbs steeply up a shadeless ridge. Short day-hikes out of Big Flat are popular. Try the easy Vh- mile one-way walk past cascading Yel- lowjacket Creek and old-growth Douglas 28 Old-growth update While no major timber-related legislation has been enacted this year, old-growth forest issues are moving ahead. In Congress Several House and Senate bills had been introduced by our press time. The bill that passes will likely mandate each of these points in some form: • A reserve system to protect major amounts of old-growth forest and its inhabitants, including spotted owls. • Economic relief for out-of-work loggers and mill workers. • A guaranteed supply of timber from public land. • A streamlined appeals system to quickly resolve disputed timber sales. A package of forestry reform bills, together called the Sierra Accord, was written by the Sierra Club and Sierra Pacific Industries, the state's largest timber landowner. It's designed to reduce clearcuts to 20 acres maximum, enhance stream and wildlife habitat, and provide a sustained yield of timber. In the courts Decisions by federal district judges have been driving old-growth issues this year. Judge Thomas Zilly, who ordered the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reconsider spotted owls for protection under the Endangered Species Act in 1988, recently ordered the FWS to designate critical owl habitat on public and private lands, then develop a recovery plan for the owl. Judge William Dwyer ordered a halt to old-growth timber sales on Forest Service land in which spotted owls might live. He told the Forest Service to develop an owl management plan by March 5, 1992. Judge Helen Frye ruled against environmental groups that had asked her to force the Bureau of Land Management to redo timber management plans for 2.1 million acres of BLM land in western Oregon. The groups had submitted new spotted owl research that might further limit timber harvests. In the woods and in the mills To preserve spotted owl habitat, much less Northwest timber is being sold this year. This cut in production, along with increased demand, is driving prices up sharply. Timber-related employment is continuing to drop, partly because fewer trees are being felled, and partly (according to information cited by Judge Dwyer) because the industry is able to mill more timber with fewer people. Trading junk bonds for redwoods Headwaters Forest, in California, the largest privately held old-growth redwood grove, may at last become public domain. Pacific Lumber owns the grove, but the Resolution Trust Corporation holds millions of dollars in Pacific Lumber junk bonds, seized from a failed savings and loan association. In a complex deal coordinated by the state, the bonds and cash (or additional bonds held by the state) could be swapped for Headwaters Forest. Beyond that, at least one bond issue with $300 million earmarked for purchase of Headwaters (or other old-growth forest) will likely be on California's June ballot. > fir to the icy waterfall at Buck's Creek (nice beaches here). River access. Dinner plate-size signs on small posts mark the 15 sites; watch for dirt pull-outs. Our favorite: Goose Creek access, 13'/2 miles up South Fork Road. There are no guided raft trips. The South Fork from Stevens Bridge to Craigs Creek is popular with kayakers and watchers. Cathedral groves at Jedediah Smith Walking through these ancient groves can be a spiritual experience. The 1-mile Simpson-Reed Discovery Trail (trailhead on U.S. 199) shows you some impressive giants on an easy nature hike. For a river- side picnic spot, take the unmarked road immediately west of the trailhead through memorial groves. Off unpaved Howland Hills Road (deep potholes; trailers not advised), the easy, 1- mile Stout Grove Trail leads through magnificent ancient redwoods. Farther up this road is one of our favorite hikes: Scout Tree Trail, a moderate 23/4-mile hike through old redwoods to a fern wa- terfall or more big trees.
