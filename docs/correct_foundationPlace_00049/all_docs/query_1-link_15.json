        "text": "BlitzMasters was born out of early sales blitzes our founder & sales prospecting expert, Andrea Sittig-Rolf, did while working as a sales manager for a telecom company in Seattle. This was old school sales, where dialing for dollars and rolodexes were the norm.\n\nShe turned this mundane, even hated task for setting appointments into fun, energetic, and motivational one-day blitzes, where everybody worked the phones together, and the team celebrated each appointment and success.\n\nThe energy in the room during those blitzes was hot! But more amazing were the numbers. Turns out, these blitzes did more than train the sales team and their partners how to set appointments with prospects. The blitzes also built strong relationships that converted at record high levels. Andrea’s boss wanted to know what her secret was to achieving these off-the-chart results.\n\nAnd that’s when it hit her. She had created something special. Something magical.\n\nSo, Andrea quit her job, taking her magic bag of tricks with her. BlitzMasters was formed to empower channel sales teams everywhere!"
