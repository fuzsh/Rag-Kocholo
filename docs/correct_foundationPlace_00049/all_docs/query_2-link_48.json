        "text": "Beyond the fish and flowers, Pike Place Market is a village of farmers, artists, residents and neighbors. With senior housing above the Market’s storefronts and a network of social services woven throughout the historic district, the Pike Place Market Foundation welcomes and supports a diverse community in the heart of downtown Seattle.\n\nEstablished in 1982, after a decades-long fight to save Pike Place Market from the wrecking ball, the Market Foundation was established to fulfill the Market’s historic charter to provide services and support for our community, especially our neighbors living on low incomes.\n\nRooted in our model for a healthy community, the Market Foundation improves the health and well-being of our neighbors by promoting and increasing access to education, nutritious food, community support, economic stability and a safe neighborhood.\n\nAs a community foundation, we provide annual support and partnership to a network of social services in Pike Place Market in addition to operating our own programs and services through our community resource center, The Market Commons.\n\nTogether, with the support of our staff, service partners, volunteers and donors, we are reaching our vision to nurture a healthy Pike Place Market community so that everyone within it can live their best life possible."
