A tidal wave is a shallow water wave caused by the gravitational interactions between the Sun, Moon, and EarthÂ (\"tidal wave\" was used in earlier times to describe what we now call a tsunami.) A tsunami is an ocean wave triggered by large earthquakes that occur near or under the ocean, volcanic eruptions, submarine landslides, or by onshore landslides in which large volumes of debris fall into the water.
