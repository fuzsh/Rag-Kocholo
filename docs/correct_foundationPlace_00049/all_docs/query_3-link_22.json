My enthusiasm lies in empowering our youth, engaging supporters, and fostering greater community connections to establish the Southside as the premier hub for learning, work, and leisure. I'm eager to build upon the incredible groundwork laid by our predecessors, working collaboratively with the board to elevate our impact in the Southside community.\n\nAs a Vietnamese Refugee deeply rooted in South King County, I'm privileged to serve the very community that offered my family opportunities and a welcoming embrace.\"\n\nLe has been the Executive Vice President at the Seattle Southside Chamber of Commerce since 2021. Alongside her new role as Executive Director at the Success Foundation, she continues leading the Chamber's education and workforce initiatives, strategic partnerships, programming, and offering support to the Chamber's membership and the wider community.\n\nThe Success Foundation's Education and Workforce Advisory Council collaborates with diverse stakeholders – businesses, policymakers, educators, community groups, and local youth – in uplifting and expanding college and career opportunities for historically marginalized students and families. Seeking partnerships to further their mission, we join forces with Puget Sound College and Career Network (PSCCN), and Highline College. Despite the region's tech prowess and vibrant business economy, many students and young adults are excluded. While over 90% aspire to postsecondary credentials, only 30% complete them, creating a looming gap in meeting the region's job demands. PSCCN's King County Promise and Highline College's responsive curriculum stand as success models, while our Success Foundation workforce program aims to diversify and prepare students for their desired careers, bridging gaps and empowering underrepresented identities."
