The Center is a dynamic public space for exhibits, programs, and conversations that explore design’s role in shaping cities.\n\nWe created the Center for Architecture & Design (CfAD) with Design in Public, AIA Seattle, and AIA Washington Council. By partnering at the Center, we leverage our expertise and resources to celebrate the power of design, advocate for policies affecting the built environment, and examine ideas to help Seattle meet the challenges it faces.\n\nPrograms and resources at CfAD are developed in large part with input from volunteers and members, mirroring their passion and interests. The programming enables the public to explore their curiosity about the role and impact of design, making this truly a center for all."
