        "text": "Providence Hospice of Seattle is a not-for-profit, community-based hospice ministry, serving seriously ill patients in all of King County, Washington including Vashon Island. We provide comprehensive and compassionate physical, emotional, and spiritual care to people nearing the end of their lives, including support for their families and friends.\n\nYour generous gifts to Providence Hospice of Seattle Foundation fund programs for terminally ill children, special patient needs for families in financial crisis, grief support for kids and families, and a palliative care program for adults who aren't ready for hospice. Most importantly, you help ensure that no patient is ever turned away based on their ability to pay.\n\nAt 104, Margot had lived a full life\n\nBecause of generous donors, she was able to die peacefully, with her daughter and son-in-law by her side.\n\nWhen Margot Morgan was 89 years old, she moved from Massachusetts to Vashon, to be closer to her daughter, Margie. She lived in a yurt, behind Margie’s house. When she was 102, it became apparent that she needed more care. She moved into an apartment at the Vashon Care Center and then to their skilled nursing area. Eventually, Margot’s health began to decline significantly. Fortunately, hospice was there to help.\n\n“Providence Hospice was wonderful!” said Margie.\n\nHer mom’s hospice nurse came weekly to check on her and manage her medications. “They developed a lovely relationship,” explained Margie. “Mom and I had a daily tea ritual. I brought her tea and cookies each day at 4pm. Mom’s hospice nurse planned her visits so she could join us. Mom loved that.” Margot’s hospice aide also came weekly to bathe her and cut her nails. “She was so gentle and non-intrusive,” said Margie. “There were a few times when I needed to be out of town. Knowing that hospice was there to monitor Mom and manage her care gave me incredible peace of mind.”\n\nRead More"
