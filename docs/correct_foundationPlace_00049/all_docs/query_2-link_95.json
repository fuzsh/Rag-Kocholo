        "text": "During your time with the SUSI program, you will stay near the University of Washington campus in Seattle. Many of your classes will also take place in campus buildings (though please note that you are not officially a University of Washington student through your participation in the SUSI, as your program is coordinated by FIUTS, not by the University).\n\nFounded in 1861, the UW is one of the oldest public universities on the West Coast. As the state’s flagship university, the UW serves more students than any other institution in the Northwest — more than 92,000 annually.\n\nThe University has 16 colleges and schools, offers 1,800 undergraduate courses each quarter, and confers more than 12,000 bachelor’s, master’s, doctoral and professional degrees annually. The UW is a multi-campus university in Seattle, Tacoma and Bothell, as well as a world-class academic medical center.\n\nHere are some links you can use to explore the University of Washington:\n\nGeneral Information\n\nCampus Webcams"
