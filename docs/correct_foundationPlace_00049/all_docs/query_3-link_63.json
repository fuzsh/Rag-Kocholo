        "text": "The United States has a long tradition of sheltering those fleeing conflict and persecution. Once refugees have been identified by the United Nations refugee agency and cleared for resettlement, the U.S. government works with the IRC and eight other national resettlement agencies to help them restart their lives in America. Out of the nearly 20 million refugees in the world, fewer than 1 percent are considered for resettlement worldwide.\n\nRefugees may be placed in a city where they have relatives or friends, or where there’s an established community that shares their language or culture. Other considerations include the cost of living and a community’s ability to provide medical services. However, as legal U.S. residents, refugees may live in any city and state they choose.\n\nLearn more about how refugee resettlement works.\n\nOur programs are designed to ensure refugees thrive in America—whether ensuring children are enrolled in school, adults become self-reliant through employment or starting businesses, or families receive acute medical care they need to recover from trauma or illness. The IRC helps those in need to rebuild their lives and regain control of their future in their new home community.\n\nRefugees are greeted and welcomed at the airport by IRC case workers and volunteers to ensure their transition is as comfortable as possible. The IRC also makes sure newly arrived refugees receive:\n\nA furnished home\n\nHelp with rent\n\nHealth care\n\nNutritious, affordable food\n\nEnglish language classes\n\nHelp building job, computer, and financial literacy skills\n\nEducation for their children\n\nSocial services and community support\n\nLegal services towards residency and citizenship\n\nOur programs in Seattle\n\nResettlement: Meeting the basic needs for food, shelter and legal rights in the early, critical stages of resettlement.\n\nEconomic Empowerment: Protecting, supporting and improving household livelihoods and financial security.\n\nCommunity Integration and Development: Strengthening communities and preparing individuals to participate fully in American society.\n\nHealth and Wellness: Promoting wellness and ensuring access to healthcare services that address physical and psychological needs.\n\nSalamati Rohi: Mental health and psychosocial support program that promotes the wellness of Afghans who are experiencing the stress and challenges of resettlement including the associated trauma, grief, and loss of having fled their home. You can learn more here.\n\nProtection: Promoting durable solutions and ensuring life-saving protection of vulnerable populations.\n\nChildren, Youth and Education: Providing educational and developmental opportunities that build the essential academic, personal and social skills needed to succeed.\n\nNew Roots: Focus on food access and nutritional needs of families upon arrival in the U.S., and builds on the agricultural experience of many new refugee and immigrant families by providing access to land, materials, and education for program participants to grow healthy food.\n\nThere are many ways that you can get involved with the IRC’s work in Seattle.
