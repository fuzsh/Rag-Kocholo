        "text": "United Indians’ History: A Vision of ALL Tribes Working Together for Justice, Transformed to Reality\n\nUnited Indians of All Tribes Foundation is a private nonprofit corporation that was founded in Seattle, Washington in 1970. We began as a small group of Northwest Native Americans and their supporters, led by the late Bernie Whitebear, who occupied Fort Lawton to reclaim a land base for the urban Indians living in and around Seattle. A twenty-acre site was eventually secured for this purpose in what is now Discovery Park.\n\nOccupying Ft. Lawton\n\nTaken from History Link by Patrick McRoberts and Kit Oldham, August 15, 2003\n\nOn March 8, 1970, about 100 members and sympathizers of United Indian People’s Council (later United Indians of All Tribes) confront the 392nd Military Police Company, who are armed with riot gear, while attempting to claim part of Fort Lawton, a 1,100-acre army post in Seattle’s Magnolia neighborhood. The United Indians, who are armed with sandwiches, sleeping bags, and cooking utensils, want to create a cultural center for Indians and Alaska natives.\n\nPlease visit University of Washington’s Seattle Civil Rights Project for more information, including interviews with occupiers.\n\nBy Right of Discovery\n\nThe group’s leader, Bernie Whitebear, read a proclamation explaining the action, but was drowned out by a sergeant barking orders. The proclamation was addressed to “The Great White Father and all of his people” and read:\n\nWe the native Americans reclaim the land known as Ft. Lawton in the name of all American Indians by right of discovery.\n\nWe feel that this land of Ft. Lawton is more suitable to pursue an Indian way of life, as determined by our own standards. By this we mean — this place does not resemble most Indian reservations. It has potential for modern facilities, adequate sanitation facilities, health care facilities, fresh running water, educational facilities, and transportation facilities.\n\nThe proclamation went on to explain that the Indians planned to use Fort Lawton to create a center for Native American studies, an Indian university, a center for ecology, a school, and a restaurant. The claim to Fort Lawton was based on rights under U.S. Indian treaties promising reversion of surplus military lands to their original owners.\n\nUIATF History Links\n\nPlease explore the links below to learn about the Foundation’s storied history:"
