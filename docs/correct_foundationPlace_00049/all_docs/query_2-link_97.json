This was definitely the highlight of our trip to Seattle. Totally unique.\n\n“Well Worth Your Time”\n\nNot typically being into art galleries, I didn’t expect to care much for this stop, but went along with others in our group. I was very pleasantly surprised. The glass artwork in this place is amazing, and is beautifully displayed. Photos don’t do it justice. There is also a garden area where some of the pieces are displayed, as well as a courtyard with snack vendor(s). You could easily spend a while here, but we went through in less than two hours.\n\n“Watch the Short Videos”\n\nBeautiful glass pieces! Check out the videos about Chihuly in the last room. There are several short videos about the glass blowing process and his journey working on some of his famous exhibitions. Also the professional photographers walking around will take your picture for free and you can e-mail yourself the photo for free as well. They make you take a short survey before they send it to you on the kiosk though.\n\n“Amaz­ing and a Must See in Seattle!”\n\nAMAZING! We loved visiting and the gardens were our favorite. We would recommend this to anyone visiting Seattle. We would suggest the Space Needle, Chihuly and MoPOP all in one day. The Chihuly can take as little as an hour to visit and we had no wait.\n\n“The Glass Col­lec­tion and Works is Bet­ter Than Murano”\n\nAmazing glass pieces in the museum, some using 300 plus colors. Very distinctive and tedious to make. From amazing glass chandeliers to canoe size pieces. The Chihuly gardens pieces are amazing, works of art. Excellent gift store associated where you can buy some pieces.Truly exceptional and a must visit, when you see the Space needle.\n\n“Very Beau­ti­ful”\n\nTruly a gem of a visit to Chihuly gardens and glass exhibits! Have lived in Seattle for 7 years and had never seen this. What a amazing collection. Worth revisiting just to see all the gorgeous stuff.\n\n“Unbe­liev­able and Spectacular”\n\nI was told that this is a must see. I had my doubts but I found that they are right. What he does with glass has to be seen to be believed. It was very beautiful and I was constantly amazed. There was also a demonstration by a glass blower that was very informative. We spent an hour and a half in there and it felt like 15 minutes. I highly recommend you visit this place\n\n“A Must See for All Ages”\n\nI take every guest that comes to town and I notice something new every time I visit. It is a remarkable talent to blow glass and create such majestic pieces. It’s breathtaking and worth a visit.\n\n“BEAU­TI­FUL!”\n\nWe were in Seattle for a wedding and had half a day to tour around and see the sites. We took the monorail into City Center and bought the citypass on our phones - HIGHLY RECOMMEND (it lasts for multiple days and includes so many things). I don't know if I'd recommend paying full price for just the glass garden, but if you're doing a package deal it's a MUST-SEE. Truly beautiful garden and very well constructed gallery. If you can catch one of the tours/talks I recommend it. I didn't know that much about Chihuly's history before."
