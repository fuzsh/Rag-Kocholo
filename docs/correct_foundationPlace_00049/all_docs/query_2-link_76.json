Read more...\n\nKeep Steaming Along\n\nThe craftsmanship and engineering behind Virginia V is a blueprint for success. The focal point is a magnificent steam engine settled in the all-wood hull. Thanks to donor support and meticulous maintenance, this is the same engine that has been powering the ship for as long as the Virginia V has been around.
