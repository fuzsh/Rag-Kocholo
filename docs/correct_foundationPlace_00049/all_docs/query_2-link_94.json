        "text": "Remembering or honoring an individual or pet with a gift to the Seattle Animal Shelter is a meaningful way to remember someone special. Special occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries or holidays are another time when a donation can be a meaningful gift.\n\nTo donate a gift in honor of someone, please stop by the shelter or send a check along with a note to:\n\nSeattle Animal Shelter/Donations\n\n2061 15th Ave. W.\n\nSeattle, WA 98119-2798\n\nIf you provide us with the name and address of the honored individual, he or she will receive a thank you note.\n\nMaking a planned gift to the Seattle Animal Shelter is an excellent way to ensure that your love and compassion for animals continues to benefit orphaned pets for many years to come. With your gift, the Seattle Animal Shelter is able to care for stray, abused and unwanted animals, along with ensuring that our officers can continue focusing on educating pet owners.\n\nBy planning to provide for the shelter in your asset planning, you are making a commitment to the animals. Here are several ways that you can make your planned gift:\n\nBequests\n\nYou can name the Seattle Animal Shelter and/or one of its funds as a beneficiary in your will. This ensures that your desire to support the animals is clear. You can donate a set amount or asset, a percentage of the total value of the estate or a residual bequest.\n\nBeneficiary\n\nSome assets, life insurance policies or certificates of deposit allow you to name a beneficiary. If these are no longer required to care for dependents, consider naming Seattle Animal Shelter or one of its funds as the beneficiary.\n\nThe staff, volunteers and animals of the Seattle Animal Shelter express their deepest gratitude to donors that honor the shelter with a planned gift. For more information on planned giving, please email us at seattleanimalshelter@seattle.gov.The Seattle Animal Shelter/City of Seattle tax identification number is 91-6001275.When planning a gift, please contact your tax attorney to help guide you in the legal and tax implications of your decision.\n\nThe shelter relies on donated items to ensure that the animals have the most comfortable, loving experience possible.\n\nWish list\n\nOur online wish list is hosted by Amazon. You can also ensure that a portion of your purchase is donated to the Seattle Animal Shelter Foundation by shopping with Amazon Smile. Or download our wish list (pdf). You can drop off donated items to the Seattle Animal Shelter during business hours.\n\nDog houses\n\nWe accept dog houses to distribute to dogs that do not have adequate shelter. While we do not promote dogs living outside, we do realize that sometimes this is the case. Since all dogs need warm, comfortable shelter, we ask for donations of Dog-loo style dog houses.\n\nPrescription medications\n\nThe Seattle Animal Shelter can no longer accept prescription medications. If you are looking to dispose of these medications, please go to takebackyourmeds.org to find locations and tips for disposing of these medications."
