The Base 2 Space Stair Climb (the “Event”) is a charity event sponsored and hosted by Space Needle LLC (the “Sponsor”) that supports one or more selected charities in which eligible persons (each a “Participant” and collectively the “Participants”) will climb one of the two stairways at the Space Needle that lead from the base to the Observation Deck located 520 feet above ground.\n\nb. Location. The Event will occur at the Space Needle at Seattle Center, Seattle, Washington. The course starts at the base of the Space Needle and ends on the Observation Deck and consists of approximately 832 stairs and 90 flights.\n\nc. When. The Event will occur on Sunday, September 29, 2024 (the “Event Date”). Starting times will begin at approximately 7 am (Pacific) with the last starting time depending on the number of Participants, but will be no later than 7 pm (Pacific). Starting times will be assigned based on the number of Participants, the varying climbing speed of the Participants and other factors, in each case, as determined by the Sponsor, in the Sponsor’s sole discretion. Starting times will be emailed to you prior to the date of the Event. Starting times are subject to change by the Sponsor on or prior to the date of the Event.\n\nd. What Not to Bring. No backpacks, baby carriers, pets, selfie sticks, sharp objects, firearms, flammable materials, or hazardous chemicals or materials are allowed in the stairwells. There will be a bag check area for personal items. The Sponsor reserves the right to prohibit Participants from taking other items into the stairwells or other areas of the Space Needle.\n\ne. What to Wear. Athletic shoes and sports attire appropriate for the Event are required. Clothing may not display or contain content, images, artwork, or material that is political in nature, inappropriate, indecent, obscene, hateful, discriminatory, tortious, defamatory, slanderous, or libelous or otherwise inconsistent with the Sponsor’s reputation and must be suitable for audiences of all ages. Participants that are not appropriately dressed or otherwise violate these Official Rules, in the Sponsor’s sole discretion, may be disqualified and prohibited from participating in the Event.\n\nf. Other Event Information. Other important information and restrictions regarding the Event are available at the “Official Website” (www.Base2SpaceSeattle.com). Information on the Official Website are subject to change at any time without notice.\n\n2. ENTRY REQUIREMENTS:\n\na. Entry Deadline. The registration deadline for the Event is September 29, 2024 (the “Entry Deadline”), which may be extended by the Sponsor. The maximum number of Participants will depend upon space availability as determined by the Sponsor. The Event may completely fill up prior to the Entry Deadline. In the event the Sponsor receives too many entries, as determined by the Sponsor, the Sponsor may choose to increase capacity or may deny any person or persons the right to participate in the Event (including persons who have submitted an Entry), in which case, the Sponsor shall return the registration fee and any Charitable Contributions raised by any such denied persons.\n\nb. Entry Form. To participate in the Event, you must first register online at the “Official Website” (Base2SpaceSeattle.com). To register on the Official Website, you must complete and submit the Event registration form (“Entry Form”). The Entry Form includes required form fields, which you must complete. You (or your parent or legal guardian) will also be required to acknowledge that you are at least eight (8) years of age and have read and agreed to these Official Rules, the required Release, Waiver, Hold Harmless Agreement and Fundraising Commitment and the Space Needle LLC’s “Privacy Statement” (http://www.spaceneedle.com/pri...), which Privacy Statement applies to the Sponsor and the Event. If you fail to tender these acknowledgements, you cannot enter the Event and any Entry will be deemed void. The Entry Form may also include other optional (non-required) fields. Whether or not you complete any or all of the optional fields, and your responses in those fields, will have no effect on your ability to participate. Fields that are required will be marked as such on the Entry Form. Your completed Entry Form (“Entry,” or collectively with all other valid, completed Entry Forms from all Participants, the “Entries”) must be received by Sponsor prior to the Entry Deadline. All required information must be provided. Entries are void if defective, altered, forged, illegible or obtained outside authorized channels. Entries become the property of the Sponsor and will not be returned. Sponsor is not responsible or liable for incorrect or inaccurate transcription of Entries or for late, lost, stolen, incomplete, illegible, damaged, misdirected, or corrupted Entries, which will be disqualified, or for problems or errors of any kind, whether mechanical, human or electronic. Only a valid, completed Entry that is actually received by Sponsor and fully complies with these Official Rules is eligible to participate in the Event. Proof of submission of Entry is not and will not be deemed to be proof of receipt of Entry by Sponsor. Each Entry will be deemed made only by the authorized account holder of the email address provided in the Entry. The authorized account holder is the natural person who is assigned to the email address by an internet access provider or other organization that is responsible for assigning email addresses or the domain associated with the submitted email address.\n\nc. Minimum Age Requirement. The Event is open only to persons who are at least eight (8) years of age (determined as of the date the Entry is submitted). Participants ten (10) and younger must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian during their climb.\n\nd. Registration Fee. If registered on or before by 11:59pm on May 31, 2024, $76 per Participant aged 18 years or older and $55 per Participant aged 8 years old to 17 years old. If registered after 11:59 pm on May 24, 2023, $89 per Participant aged 18 years or older and $55 per Participant aged 8 years old to 17 years old. The registration fee is non-refundable and non-transferable even if the Participant does not or cannot participate in the Event for any reason, including disqualification or any illness or injury that may preclude participation in the Event. Only $25 of the registration fee is tax deductible. The registration fee does not count toward the Participant’s Minimum Charitable Contribution.\n\ne. T-Shirt and Medal Deadlines: You must register by August 1, 2024, in order to reserve a finishers medal and participant t-shirt.\n\nf. Minimum Charitable Contributions. As the purpose of the Event is to raise funds for one or more charities, each Entry requires a minimum charitable contribution of $200 (the “Minimum Charitable Contribution”), which must be received at the time of Participant packet pick up on the Event Date. This is in addition to the registration fee. By registering for the Event, a Participant agrees to satisfy the Minimum Charitable Contribution by obtaining donations that are properly credited as supporting the\n\nParticipant’s participation in the Event, but the Participant is personally responsible for the Minimum Charitable Contribution even if the Participant does not raise sufficient donations and even if the Participant does not or cannot participate in the Event for any reason, including disqualification or any illness or injury that may limit or preclude participation in the Event. If a Participant’s Minimum Charitable Contribution has not been paid in full by the time of Participant’s packet pick up at the Space Needle on the Event Date, the Space Needle Foundation or the Sponsor has the right to charge the outstanding balance of the Participant’s Minimum Charitable Contribution to the Participant’s credit card at any time on and after Participant’s packet pick up on the Event Date. Participant agrees to pay promptly any balance of their Minimum Charitable Contribution outstanding on the Event Date, at the time of Participant’s packet pick up using a valid and effective means of payment. Funds donated by a Participant or others at any time to satisfy a Participant’s Minimum Charitable Contribution are not refundable for any reason including cancellation of the Event due to natural disaster or other reasons beyond the control of the Sponsor, cancellation of the Participant’s participation in the Event, or a Participant’s inability to participate in the Event for any reason, including any illness or injury that may preclude the Participant’s participation in the Event. Donations made directly to an overall team (rather than directly to one or more individual team members) may be allocated to the individuals team members for purposes of satisfying each individual team member’s Minimum Charitable Contribution. Donations made directly to an individual team member may be allocated to another member on the same team for purposes of satisfying each individual team member’s Minimum Charitable Contribution. See Section 4 below for the rules and regulations governing allocating or transferring individual and/or team donations for purposes of Fundraising Awards.\n\ng. Agreement to Official Rules and Decisions of Sponsor. Each Participant fully and unconditionally accepts and agrees to comply with and abide by these Official Rules, Space Needle LLC’s general terms and conditions for all visitors to the Space Needle (as posted at the Space Needle) and the decisions of the Sponsor, which shall be final and binding with respect to all aspects of the Event.\n\n3. WHERE THE CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS GO:\n\na. Selection of Charity or Charities. The Sponsor has selected Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and the Space Needle Foundation as the recipients of the Charitable Contributions from the Event. The Sponsor has selected the Space Needle Foundation as the recipient of the registration fees from the Event. Provided, the Sponsor reserves the right, for good cause, in its discretion, to remove any previously selected charity (and/or replace and add different charities) that will receive all or any portion of the Charitable Contributions from the Event. In the event the Sponsor elects to sponsor the Event (or any other charitable event) in the future, the Sponsor may select the same or different charities.\n\nb. Allocation of Charitable Contributions. In 2024, one hundred percent (100%) of the contributions raised by Participants and received by the Sponsor (the “Charitable Contributions”) will go directly to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and the Space Needle Foundation, as allocated by the Sponsor, but the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center shall receive no less than fifty percent (50%) of the Charitable Contributions. The Charitable Contributions do not include the registration fee.\n\nc. Use of Charitable Contributions. The Sponsor shall not be responsible in any manner for the use of the Charitable Contributions by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center or any other charity.\n\nd. Tax Benefits. Each Participant shall be solely responsible for determining the availability and applicability of any tax deductions or other benefits related to the Charitable Contributions and his or her participation in the Event. The Sponsor makes no representations, warranties or assurances regarding the current or continued availability or applicability of any tax deductions or other benefits.\n\n4. GENERAL RELEASE & CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION: The contents of this provision include a Waiver and Release of Liability. You are advised to read it carefully and consider it when deciding whether or not to participate in the Event.\n\na. WAIVER AND RELEASE OF LIABILITY. BY PARTICIPATING IN THE EVENT, EACH PARTICIPANT HEREBY AGREES TO RELEASE, INDEMNIFY, AND HOLD HARMLESS SPONSOR, THE SPACE NEEDLE FOUNDATION, FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER INSTITUTE, CITY OF SEATTLE, ALL BENEFITED CHARITIES, AND EACH OF THEIR AFFILIATES, AND EACH OF THE FOREGOING PARTIES’ RESPECTIVE SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, PARTNERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, MANAGERS, TRUSTEES, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, VOLUNTEERS AND REPRESENTATIVES (COLLECTIVELY, THE “RELEASED PARTIES”), FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS, COSTS, INJURIES, LOSSES OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, PROPERTY DAMAGE, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE, PERSONAL INJURY, BODILY INJURY, AND/OR DEATH (WHETHER DUE TO NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) DUE IN WHOLE OR IN PART, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO PARTICIPATION IN THE EVENT OR ANY EVENT-RELATED AND/OR TRAVEL-RELATED ACTIVITY, OR PARTICIPATION IN ANY AWARD-RELATED ACTIVITIES.\n\nb. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES: BY PARTICIPATING IN THE EVENT, EACH PARTICIPANT HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT NEITHER THE SPONSOR NOR ITS PARENT ENTITY AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SHAREHOLDERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AGENTS AND EMPLOYEES, HAS MADE NOR IS IN ANY MANNER RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR (AND IN FACT, HEREBY DISCLAIMS) ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, IN FACT OR IN LAW, RELATIVE TO ANY FUNDRAISING AWARD INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ITS QUALITY, SUITABILITY OR AVAILABILITY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, ALL FUNDRAISING AWARD ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND SPONSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND/OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n\nc. Assumption of Risk. Participants assume all risk of loss, damage, destruction, delay and misdirection of Award Claim Documents or any other forms or communication relevant to the Event and/or the Fundraising Awards.\n\nd. Publicity. Except where prohibited by law, submission of Award Claim Documents constitutes permission, but not an obligation, for the Sponsor to use Participants’ and potential Fundraising Award recipient’s name, voice, image (whether still or moving), hometown, likeness, other personally identifiable information (including city and state of residence), and any statements made by or attributed to such recipient in any and all media, now known or hereafter devised, without notice, review or approval, in perpetuity and throughout the universe for advertising, commercial and promotional purposes in connection with the Event and other promotions without further compensation, and releases the Sponsor and the other Released Parties from any liability with respect thereto. Except where prohibited by law, the Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, require potential Award recipients to sign an agreement to this effect as a condition of receiving the Fundraising Award, and it may disqualify any recipient or deem any Fundraising Award forfeited for failure to do so.\n\ne. Disclaimer of Responsibility. Sponsor, its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, franchisees, local advertising cooperatives, advertising/promotion agencies, and all of their respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees, representatives, and agents, and the other Released Parties, are not responsible or liable for: (a) incomplete, illegible, misdirected, late, lost, damaged, stolen, or postage-due submissions of Entry, Award Claim Documents or other Event materials; (b) any human or other error, technical malfunctions, lost/delayed data or voice transmission, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, line failures of any telephone network, computer equipment, software, inability to access any online service or website, or any other error or malfunction, or any injury or damage to Participant’s or any other person’s computer related to or resulting from participation in this Event; (c) lost, interrupted, inaccessible or unavailable networks, servers, satellites, Internet or Wireless Service Providers, websites, or other connection, availability or accessibility problems arising in connection with or over the course of the Event; (d) miscommunications, failed, jumbled, scrambled, delayed, dropped, interrupted, lost, non-delivered or misdirected computer, telephone, text message, email or cable transmissions or hardware or software or program or programming malfunctions, failures or difficulties; (e) any other errors of any kind, whether human, mechanical, clerical, electronic, digital or technical in nature, or unauthorized human intervention; (f) any incorrect or inaccurate information, whether caused by the Official Website users, tampering, hacking, or by any equipment or programming associated with, or utilized in, the Event; or (g) the incorrect or inaccurate capture of information, or the failure to capture or loss of any information.\n\nf. Other. Failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. If for any reason the Event is not capable of being executed as planned (in whole or in part) or any event or cause occurs which, in the opinion of the Sponsor, corrupts or affects the administration, security, fairness, integrity, or proper conduct of this Event, then the Sponsor reserves the right at its sole discretion to disqualify any suspect Entry or Participant and/or to cancel, terminate, modify or suspend the Event. In the event of any cancellation, termination or suspension, notice thereof will be posted on the Official Website and Sponsor reserves the right to determine, in its sole discretion, a procedure (if any) for awarding any unawarded Fundraising Awards.\n\n5. DISPUTES, ARBITRATION: By participating in the Event, each Participant agrees that:\n\na. Any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) that Participant may have against Sponsor, its subsidiaries, parents, affiliates, officers, directors and/or employees or any of the other Released Parties arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the Event, the awarding or redemption of Awards, or the scope, enforceability, or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate (“Dispute”) will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”);\n\nb. All arbitrations will be conducted in English at Seattle, Washington before a sole neutral arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by AAA (“Rules and Procedures”), to the extent they do not conflict with these Official Rules;\n\nc. This arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”);\n\nd. The arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of these Official Rules and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable Participant may have entered into in connection with Event;\n\ne. The arbitrator shall apply Washington law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law;\n\nf. The Dispute may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis; arbitration may only be exercised to decide Participant’s and/or Sponsor’s individual claims or counter-claims; and to the fullest extent permitted by law, no arbitration shall be joined to an arbitration involving any other party, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise;\n\ng. The arbitrator may award interim and final injunctive relief and other remedies, but may not award punitive, exemplary, treble, or other enhanced damages; however, these limitations on remedies may be deemed inoperative to the extent necessary to preserve the enforceability of the agreement to arbitrate;\n\nh. In the event that the administrative fees and deposits that must be paid to initiate arbitration against the Sponsor or any of the other Released Parties exceed $125 USD for claims less than $10,000, or $375 for claims greater than $10,000 but less than $75,000, and the Participant is unable (or not required under the applicable Rules and Procedures) to pay any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, Sponsor (or the other Released Parties, as applicable) agrees to pay them and/or forward them on the Participant’s behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator; additionally if the Participant is able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, the Sponsor (or the other Released Parties, as applicable) will pay as much of the Participant’s filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive;\n\ni. Each party shall bear its own expenses, including but not limited to expert witness and attorneys’ fees;\n\nj. Any award of the arbitrator (including awards of interim or final remedies) may be confirmed or enforced in any court having jurisdiction; and\n\nk. With the exception of subpart (f) above, if any portion of this Rule is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by AAA, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein; if, however, subpart (f) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Rule shall be null and void, neither Sponsor (and the other Released Parties, as applicable) nor Participant shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute, and in any action or judicial proceeding, each party hereby waives any right it may have to trial by jury.\n\n7. MISCELLANEOUS:\n\na. Internet Access, Email Account, Fees. By entering this contest, Participant hereby expressly acknowledges and understands that internet access is required to participate. Participants must submit their Entry using the Official Website, and Participants must have a valid, working email address at which to receive notifications from the Sponsor concerning their status as a potential Fundraising Award recipient.

Participants who do not have internet access are encouraged to seek public forums of internet access, including public libraries. Participants who do not have a valid, working email address are encouraged to sign up for free email services from any of a number of providers. In no event will the Sponsor be liable or responsible for any fees, charges, taxes, or costs of any other kind associated with or arising from any Participant’s efforts to secure internet access or an email address, whether solely to participate in this Event or otherwise.\n\nb. Force Majeure and Errors. The Sponsor reserves the right, without prior notice and at any time, to terminate the Event, in whole or in part, or modify, suspend or extend the Event in any way if it determines, in its sole discretion, that the Event is impaired. In the event the Sponsor is prevented from continuing with the Event as contemplated herein or by any event beyond its control, including but not limited to fire, flood, natural or man-made health epidemic, earthquake, explosion, labor dispute or strike, act of God or public enemy, satellite or equipment failure, riot or civil disturbance, terrorist threat or activity, war (declared or undeclared) or any federal, state, provincial or local government law, order, or regulation, public health crisis, order of any court or jurisdiction, or other cause not reasonably within Sponsor’s control (each a “Force Majeure” event or occurrence), then subject to any governmental approval which may be required, Sponsor shall have the right to modify, suspend, extend, or terminate the Event.\n\nc. Invalidity, Headings, Rule Modification. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Official Rules shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. In the event that any provision is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, these Official Rules shall otherwise remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein. Headings and captions are used in these Official Rules solely for ease of reference, and shall not be deemed to affect in any manner the meaning or intent of these Official Rules or any provision hereof. These Official Rules cannot be modified or amended in any way except in writing by a duly authorized representative of the Sponsor.\n\nd. Governing Law. All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of these Official Rules or the rights and obligations of any parties in connection with the Event and any Fundraising Awards shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Washington including procedural provisions without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions that would cause the application of any other state’s or jurisdiction’s laws.\n\ne. Venue, Attorneys’ Fees. Any and all court actions and proceedings arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the Event and any Fundraising Awards shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal and state courts in King County, Washington. Each party to the action or proceeding shall bear its own attorneys' fees, expenses (including without limitation expert witness fees) and costs.\n\nf. Language Discrepancy. In the event there is a discrepancy or inconsistency between disclosures or other statements contained in or displayed on any Event materials, the Official Website, and/or Award Claim Documents and the terms and conditions of these Official Rules, these Official Rules shall prevail, govern and control.\n\ng.
