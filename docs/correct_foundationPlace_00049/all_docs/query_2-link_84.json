        "text": "South Seattle College is fortunate to have philanthropic support from two foundations: Seattle Colleges Office of Advancement/Foundation and the South Seattle College Foundation.\n\nThe Seattle Colleges Office of Advancement\n\nThe Seattle Colleges Office of Advancement coordinates fundraising efforts district-wide to advance the mission of Seattle Colleges (including South Seattle College, Seattle Central College and North Seattle College). We work directly with the institutionally-related Seattle Colleges Foundation to connect donors who want to impact student achievement and strengthen the Seattle community. Donorsâ€™ interests range from student scholarships and faculty development to high quality academic programs and capital improvements.\n\nSeattle Colleges Foundation\n\nIn 2018, the Office of Advancement launched the Seattle Colleges Foundation, a new institutionally-related nonprofit that emerged from a process of consultation and collaboration among the campuses comprising Seattle Colleges, each of which previously supported a separate foundation.\n\nThe move to a single, unified foundation follows a prevailing national model for multiple-college districts adopting an integrated approach. It serves the philanthropic needs for each college as well as the Seattle Colleges District as a whole. With implemented structural changes, consolidated resources, improved coordination, and renewed strategy and alignment, we increase our overall fundraising capacity and efficiency. The Seattle Colleges Foundation is the official fundraising arm of Seattle Colleges, including South Seattle College.\n\nLearn more about Seattle Colleges Foundation and make a contribution at foundation.seattlecolleges.edu.\n\nThe tax ID number/employer identification number or EIN for Seattle Colleges Foundation is 83-0551671. Gifts to the Seattle Colleges Foundation are tax-deductible to the extent allowable by law. Consult with your tax advisor when determining the tax-deductibility of all of your charitable contributions.\n\nFoundation scholarships\n\nContact the Office of Advancement\n\nSiegal Center\n\n1500 Harvard Avenue Seattle, WA 98122\n\n206.934.2939\n\nAdvancement@seattlecolleges.edu\n\nSouth Seattle College Foundation\n\nSouth Seattle College is fortunate to have additional philanthropic support from the South Seattle College Foundation, an independent, nonprofit 501 (c) (3) that provides scholarship support to students, and promotes and supports educational programs and training pursuits at the college. The South Seattle College Foundation was established in 1980 and created the 13th Year Promise Scholarship in 2008. The 13th Year program informed and inspired the creation of Seattle Promise.\n\nFoundation scholarships\n\nContact the South Seattle College Foundation"
