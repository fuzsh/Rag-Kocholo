In 2013, the foundation awarded grants of more than $65 million.[4] It has worked with Seattle and King County, Washington lawmakers on civic initiatives to increase voter turnout[5] and provide services to immigrants and refugees.[6]\n\nSeattle Foundation's annual GiveBIG, a 24-hour online giving campaign designed to support King County and Washington state nonprofit organizations, has raised more than $100 million[7] from 400,000 individual donations to nearly 1,600 different organizations since 2011.[8] In its sixth year, GiveBIG was extended an extra 24 hours due to technical difficulties with Kimbia, the fundraising platform used by dozens of community foundations across the country on May 3, 2016.[9] The foundation's eighth and final GiveBIG campaign was held on May 9, 2018.[10]\n\nJune 23, 2011: $3.6 million[11]\n\nMay 2, 2012: $7.4 million[12]\n\nMay 15, 2013: $11.1 million[13]\n\nMay 6, 2014: $12.9 million[14]\n\nMay 5, 2015: $16.3 million[15]\n\nMay 3â€“4, 2016: $22 million [16]\n\nMay 10, 2017: $19 million[17]\n\nMay 9, 2018: $16.6 million[18]"
