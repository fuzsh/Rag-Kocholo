        "text": "An Important Message from the Seattle Chapter Board\n\nARCS Foundation Seattle Chapter stands in solidarity with the Black community. We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion. Over the past months, we have witnessed millions of people filling the streets throughout the country demanding justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade and locally Manuel Ellis, along with many others who have lost their lives due to police brutality and systemic racism. This is a reality we must not normalize or accept. Black Lives Matter. These senseless deaths and the division within our country sickens us. We can no longer look away or remain silent about the devastating effect of structural and systemic racism, laid bare by the current social, economic and health crisis in our country. COVID-19 continues to rise at disproportionate rates for people of color. We must do better. It will take hard work, but we are willing to listen and be part of the solution. For over 40 years, our mission of advancing science and technology in the United States has allowed us to support thousands of outstanding graduate students studying to complete degrees in sciences, engineering and medical research. We commit to use this platform to be a catalyst to create lasting change."
