        "text": "NEW YORK, February 5, 2001 â€“ iVillage Inc. (Nasdaq: IVIL), operator of the iVillage Network, which includes iVillage.com, Lamaze Publishing and the Newborn Channel, today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of Women.com Networks, Inc. (Nasdaq: WOMN), creating the world's largest and most comprehensive destination for women on the Web.\n\nIn a separate announcement, iVillage also reported its Fourth Quarter 2000 and Fiscal Year 2000 Financial Results.\n\n\"This acquisition strengthens the competitive position of iVillage, increasing its traffic and attractiveness to new sponsors,\" said Doug McCormick, who will serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the combined entity. \"It gives iVillage the highest reach among women's sites and propels us into the top 20 digital media/Web properties.\"\n\nMcCormick continued, \"By combining the two top players in the online women's space, we are creating the most comprehensive destination to meet the everyday needs of women online. Sponsors benefit by having one-stop access to one of the most highly targeted and desirable demographics on the Web. Additionally, through this agreement, we are partnering with Hearst, the number one women's media company. Hearst's $40 million commitment overall to the venture is a clear affirmation of its belief in iVillage and the viability of the online women's space.\"\n\nThe overall transaction has an aggregate value of $47 million, based on the February 2, 2001 closing price of iVillage common stock $1.69. Under terms of the merger agreement, iVillage will issue 0.322 shares of iVillage Common Stock for each share of Women.com Common Stock on the closing date of the acquisition, plus an aggregate amount of cash currently anticipated to be approximately $250,000.\n\nIn addition, through a registered rights offering, The Hearst Corporation and Women.com's other public stockholders will have the opportunity to invest an aggregate of $20 million in iVillage in exchange for approximately 9.3 million shares, and warrants to purchase an additional approximately 2.1 million shares, of iVillage Common Stock. To the extent any of Women.com's other stockholders do not purchase their pro rata percentage of iVillage shares and warrants in this rights offering, The Hearst Corporation has agreed to purchase any such shortfall.\n\nThe Hearst Corporation has also committed to purchase from iVillage a range of approximately $15 - $21 million in production and advertising services over a three-year period.\n\nMarleen McDaniel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Women.com will assist the new company through its transition period. Three designees of The Hearst Corporation will be appointed to the iVillage board. Other management structure decisions will be determined at a later date.\n\n\"This is a great move for iVillage and true to our mission,\" said Candice Carpenter, Co-Founder of iVillage. \"As the number of women online continues to grow, iVillage will remain a trusted place for women to find solutions for their everyday lives.\"\n\n\"We're thrilled to join together the two leading Internet sites for women,\" said Marleen McDaniel. \"By joining together, we will further elevate iVillage and provide women online with an even broader spectrum of offerings than ever before.\"\n\nThis acquisition creates the critical mass for additional revenue streams, including digital subscription services, as well as provides further opportunities to monetize iVillage's user base. It also offers the potential to create a separate research company by combining the research efforts already underway at both iVillage and Women.com.\n\nThe transaction, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2001, will be accounted for as a purchase and is subject to approval by the stockholders of iVillage and Women.com, and certain regulatory and customary closing conditions. Hearst Communications, Inc., which owns approximately 46% of Women.com, has agreed to vote all of its shares of Women.com in favor of the transaction.\n\nAllen & Co. served as financial advisor to iVillage Inc.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\n\niVillage management will host a conference call today, February 5, 2001, at 5:30 p.m. to discuss additional details relating to the Company's acquisition of Women.com. iVillage will also discuss its Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2000 results on this call, as previously scheduled. The call can be accessed through the ivillage.com Web site located at www.ivillage.com, and on Street Events, located at www.streetevents.com. A replay of the conference call will be available on iVillage's Investor Relations Web site for 48 hours after the call and can be accessed two hours after the call's start time.\n\nAbout Women.com\n\nAmong the top 50 most visited Internet properties, Women.com (Nasdaq:WOMN), is a leading women's Internet network offering programming, community and personalized services that are relevant, interesting and immediate to women online.
