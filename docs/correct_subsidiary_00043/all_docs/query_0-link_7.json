        "text": "NBCUniversal (colloquially referred to as NBCU or NBCUni and formerly written as NBC Universal) is an American multinational media conglomerate. Headquartered in Rockefeller Plaza's Comcast Building (formerly the GE Building) in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, the company is one of two successor companies to MCA Inc. (Music Corporation of America), the other being Vivendi through its subsidiary Universal Music Group.\n\nNBCUniversal is primarily involved in the media and entertainment industries; among its most significant divisions are NBC, one of the United States' \"Big Three\" television networks, and the major film studio Universal Studios. It has a significant presence in broadcasting through a portfolio of domestic and international properties, including terrestrial and pay television outlets. Via the Universal Parks & Resorts division, the company is also the third-largest operator of amusement parks in the world.\n\nNBC Universal was formed on May 12, 2004 by the merger of General Electric's NBC with Vivendi's Vivendi Universal Entertainment. GE and US cable TV operator Comcast announced a buyout agreement for the company on December 3, 2009. Following regulatory approvals, the transaction completed on January 28, 2011. Comcast subsequently owned 51% of NBCUniversal while GE owned 49%. Comcast intended to buy out the rest of GE's stake over the following seven years, but nothing happened until February 12, 2013, when Comcast announced its intention to complete the purchase all at once and assume 100% ownership of the company by the end of March. The deal was finalized on March 19, 2013.\n\nOriginally, the NBC Universal logo was a combination of the NBC peacock logo and the Universal Studios globe and text. The logo was redesigned by Wolff Olins on January 31, 2011 to reflect the new Comcast ownership and the unity of its two main divisions.\n\nAs of 2017, NBCUniversal currently owns four animation divisions, Gingo Animation, Universal Animation Studios, Illumination Entertainment, and DreamWorks Animation.\n\nSubsidiaries[]\n\nNBC Broadcasting\n\nNBC Advertising Sales\n\nNBCUniversal Television Stations\n\nNBC Owned Television Stations\n\nTelemundo Television Stations Group\n\nAffiliate Relations\n\nNetwork Research\n\nNBCUniversal Television Distribution\n\nNBCUniversal Digital Entertainment\n\nSpecial Events\n\nNBC Entertainment\n\nNBC programming\n\nUniversal Television\n\nUniversal Filmed Entertainment Group\n\nUniversal Studios\n\nFocus Features\n\nFocus World\n\nGramercy Pictures\n\nWorking Title Films\n\nUniversal Pictures Home Entertainment\n\nUniversal Animation Studios\n\nGingo Animation\n\nGlass Ball Productions\n\nWonderful Neon Productions\n\nGingo Interactive\n\nAmblin Partners (JV)\n\nAmblin Entertainment\n\nAmblin Television\n\nDreamWorks Pictures\n\nStoryteller Distribution\n\nDreamWorks Animation\n\nDreamWorks Animation Home Entertainment\n\nDreamWorks Classics\n\nBig Idea Entertainment\n\nHarvey Entertainment\n\nJay Ward Productions\n\nDreamWorks New Media\n\nAwesomenessTV\n\nAwesomeness Films\n\nBig Frame\n\nOriental DreamWorks\n\nIllumination Entertainment\n\nIllumination Mac Guff\n\nUniversal Interactive\n\nNBCUniversal Entertainment Japan\n\nNBC Sports Group\n\nComcast Sports Group\n\nGolf Channel\n\nNBC Sports\n\nNBC Sports Digital Network\n\nNBCSN\n\nNBCUniversal Cable\n\nSyfy\n\nE!\n\nUSA Network\n\nUniversal HD\n\nUniversal Cable Productions\n\nBravo (U.S. TV network)\n\nEsquire Network (Joint venture)\n\nOxygen Media\n\nUniversal Kids (formerly Sprout)\n\nThe Weather Channel (JV)\n\n(digital networks)\n\nDailyCandy\n\nFandango\n\nIntegrated Media group\n\nNBCUniversal Hispanic Enterprises and Content\n\nTelemundo\n\nNBC Universo\n\nNBC Deportes\n\nNBCUniversal News Group\n\nNBC News\n\nCNBC\n\nMSNBC\n\n[]"
