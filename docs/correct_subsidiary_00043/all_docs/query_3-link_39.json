        "text": "Shortly after noon on March 19, 1999, an Internet company called iVillage began selling common stock, as the culmination of a carefully orchestrated initial public offering, or I.P.O. The day before, the company’s pricing committee had met at about four o’clock and set a formal offering price at twenty-four dollars a share, but everyone involved knew that, once trading began, the stock’s value would increase dramatically. Those allowed to buy shares at the offering price were almost certain to reap great gains, unlike lay investors, for whom the outcome was far riskier. The opening bid was $95.88. In that instant, iVillage’s leaders, Candice Carpenter, the C.E.O., and Nancy Evans, the editor-in-chief, became multimillionaires, at least on paper. To outsiders, the transaction looked like magic. A company as ethereal as air, with deep losses, few physical assets, little proprietary technology, extravagant rates of spending, a high employee “burn rate,” and powerful emerging competitors, had accomplished one of the most successful I.P.O.s ever and suddenly was worth more than two billion dollars. It all seemed so easy. Bingo.com.\n\nThe road to this I.P.O., however, was neither easy nor direct. Its contours reveal forces that have made thousands of Internet investors and entrepreneurs rich despite the fact that most new Net ventures have yet to show a profit. In that sense, iVillage, which offers an array of services and advice for women, is typical of the dozens of startups in so-called new media. Its good fortune, however, attracted an unusual amount of attention—and hostility—because Carpenter and Evans were neither “Web heads” nor computer geeks, but two women in their forties with controversial reputations rooted in the realm of books, magazines, and television. To their old-media peers, their sudden windfall seemed to show that anyone with a few ideas and a lot of nerve could make a killing in cyberspace.\n\nIn Netspeak, there are two kinds of people: those who “get it,” and those who don’t. To get it means that you understand the extent to which the Internet will change work and commerce in the next millennium, and that you grasp why the race to stake out “real estate” in cyberspace is making so many people so rich so quickly. “What you’re buying as an investor in this marketplace is the premise that the Internet is literally on the order of magnitude of the industrial revolution,” said Bill Brady, the head of corporate finance for Credit Suisse First Boston’s technology group, which helped iVillage go public.\n\nCandice Carpenter, the primary architect of iVillage, not only “got it”; she also understood that in the absence of conventional yardsticks, such as profits and tangible assets, the stock market would find other ways to discriminate among hundreds of Internet startups. She grasped early on that such intangible qualities as brand identity and the ability to tell a good story—that is, to construct a narrative about how a few bright ideas might grow into a large profitable enterprise—would become paramount. She pioneered the use of “integrated sponsorships,” where advertisers participate in the creation of content, the information, articles, and services that appear on the company’s Web sites. She also foresaw that women, who were slow to embrace the Internet, eventually would constitute a vast and coveted on-line market, and that E-commerce would become an important source of revenue. Among her past and present colleagues, there is wide agreement that Carpenter’s greatest strength may be her talent for selling a vision of herself as a successful Internet mogul, a process she calls “self-branding.”\n\n“Candice is what Internet entrepreneurship is all about,” said Martin Yudkovitz, the president of NBC Interactive Media, which last November struck an alliance with iVillage. “She is not a small voice, she is not a timid personality. This is about creating multibillion-dollar market caps, up against some big existing traditional companies. . . . You think about how intimidating that is. A lot of very smart people won’t last twenty minutes in that culture.”\n\nBut the traits that allowed Carpenter to thrive—her demanding personality and penchant for self-promotion—also contributed to the incredulity and bitterness that greeted the iVillage I.P.O. Newspaper photographs of the iVillage executives celebrating their good fortune, particularly one showing Nancy Evans smoking a celebratory cigar, fed the hostility. A Slate diarist summarized the reaction in media circles this way: “Hey, if ‘fucking iVillage’ (as it’s invariably called) can do it, we can too.”\n\nCandice Carpenter is forty-seven years old and a single mother. She lives in a bright penthouse apartment on Park Avenue and Seventy-fourth Street with two daughters, aged four and five, attended by a vegetarian chef and a couple of nannies with overlapping schedules. Each morning, Carpenter commutes to the sixth floor of a nondescript building at 212 Fifth Avenue, on the edge of the Flatiron District, which is now often called Silicon Alley. These offices, where low partitions separate nests of young managers, plus offices on a couple of floors in each of two buildings farther down Fifth Avenue and fifty-some computer servers lodged at a secure “hosting farm” in Jersey City, New Jersey, constitute nearly all of iVillage’s tangible assets. Beyond this, iVillage exists as a ganglion of corporate alliances and digital pathways that together form a network of seventeen Web sites, or “channels,” through which the company seeks to build a community of women on the Internet, and thereby to help them endure divorce, miscarriage, breast cancer, rude children, corporate stress, unfortunate taste in boyfriends, and whatever else a woman in the twenty-five-to-fifty-four demographic is likely to experience. In the process, iVillage hopes to “monetize” this community by eventually selling enough products and advertising to make a huge profit.\n\nI first met Carpenter four months ago in her office, overlooking Fifth Avenue. She wore a dark gray pants-and-jacket combination and a peach-colored top with the opacity of mosquito netting. If you heard only her voice, you would imagine someone much younger. She punctuates her sentences with words like “sucks” and “gig” and refers to women as girls. Her eyes are the color of smoked glass, and during two of our many conversations, held in New York and Seattle, she chose to wear a pair of sunglasses with leopard-patterned frames, which seem to be emerging as a personal trademark.\n\nThe key to Carpenter’s business strategy—and to that of virtually every other Internet venture—is the concept of “stickiness,” the intangible quality that brings individuals to a Web site and holds them for long sessions during which, companies hope, they will click away like crazy and generate vast numbers of “page views,” the successive screens that users encounter as they navigate through a site. The more “sticky traffic” a company can accumulate, the better it does in the ratings tabulated by Media Metrix, a Silicon Alley company that does for the Internet what Nielsen Media Research does for television. It tracks data from some twenty-one thousand Web sites, and issues monthly rankings that are based on how many “unique visitors” each one has attracted in the most recent period. In August, iVillage ranked twenty-seventh among all Web properties, with five million visitors. America Online, with fifty-three million, was first.\n\nEach page view, in theory, represents an opportunity for an advertiser to steal the attention of a visitor, whom Net marketers often describe simply as a pair of “eyeballs.” Without profits to tout, companies like to tally their page views as a way of demonstrating growth, and in order to boost the tally they deploy various “stickiness” devices. Free E-mail is a popular way to draw people back several times a day. In August, iVillage reported that in the second quarter its visitors saw an average of more than a hundred million page views per month, thanks to such stickiness devices as E-mail; free personal home pages; a daily horoscope; nightly chats on current events, careers, and other topics led by a network of volunteers; and on-line consultations with experts in a variety of fields, like Dr. Patti Britton, the “Sex Coach.”\n\nWhile exploring “Parent Soup,” the company’s original Web site, I found a good example of how iVillage makes a site sticky, and eventually—it hopes—profitable. Here a pregnant woman can enter her due date and receive a calendar showing day by day what’s likely to be happening inside her body. iVillage links women with overlapping calendars to a “Pregnancy Circle,” a support group where they can trade advice and concerns. Throughout the calendar, iVillage gently prods them to buy stuff.\n\nI entered a date and received a calendar that recommended twenty books over ten months. I clicked on one title and rocketed to Amazon.com. At other points, my calendar recommended that I prepare for the arrival of my new baby by shopping at iVillage’s on-line store, iBaby, which, in turn, suggested that I visit iMaternity, where a “Maternity Checklist” listed all the clothing I would need for a comfortable journey toward parenthood.\n\niVillage was one of the first companies to envision a more intimate relationship between users and advertisers—what it calls “integrated sponsorships.” Last February, for example, iVillage launched a pet channel, sponsored by Ralston Purina, which offers chat rooms, message boards, and access to pet experts. As of now, there is only one pet expert—Jane Popham, a Ralston employee. In an early prospectus that iVillage prepared for its I.P.O., the company stated that Ralston Purina had agreed to “assist iVillage in the marketing, distribution and fulfillment of Ralston Purina products within the pet channel.” Soon the channel will include an on-line pet store.\n\nSo far, though, iVillage’s goal of monetizing its community has been spectacularly elusive. Like so many other Internet startups, it has seen costs, not profits, rise each year. Last year, it lost nearly forty-four million dollars and ripped through thirty million in cash that it had raised from private investors. The iVillage I.P.O. prospectus warned investors, correctly, that such losses might increase over the foreseeable future. But the company’s prediction that more women would come on-line has been borne out, too: iVillage now has 2.1 million registered members, up from three hundred and sixty-three thousand at the end of its second quarter last year. This audience has helped it to attract such blue-chip sponsors as Kimberly-Clark, A.T. & T., and Ford and to forge key alliances with A.O.L. and Amazon.com. Like cable-TV companies, which spent heavily at the outset to attract a mass audience, Carpenter expects iVillage eventually to become immensely profitable, but this strategy remains unproved. Jeffrey F. Rayport, a Harvard Business School expert on E-commerce, says, “It’s not clear that anyone, least of all iVillage, understands how to convert the social dynamic into a business.”\n\nFor now, though, iVillage is flush with I.P.O. cash and is making deals it otherwise could not have attempted, thereby gaining an advantage over other companies just now beginning to target women on-line. In August, it acquired the Lamaze Publishing Company for $102.3 million, most of it in iVillage stock. Earlier this month, iVillage bought a $7.5 million stake in an online drugstore and health-care site called PlanetRx.com, which agreed to pay $22.5 million to become iVillage’s exclusive drug and vitamin retailer.\n\n“We’re pretty well stocked for all-out war,” Carpenter told me. “I mean, let’s rock and roll.”\n\nTalk like this would have surprised anyone who knew Carpenter back in her home town, Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, when she was a teen-age beauty whose idea of ambition was to prevent the chlorine in the pool at the local club from destroying her hair. Her older brother, Peter, then an Air Force officer shuttling between Washington and Saigon, did not approve of her frivolity, and enrolled Candice in a twenty-eight day Outward Bound course in Colorado. Wilderness epiphany has become something of an overachiever’s cliché, but Carpenter’s life was undisputably transformed. She returned to the program every summer during her college years at Stanford University, becoming an accomplished rock climber and, eventually, an instructor at the National Outdoor Leadership School.\n\nIn 1979, Carpenter married a former Boeing executive, with whom she founded an Outward Bound program for executives. In 1981, she enrolled in Harvard Business School; from that point, her marriage began to unravel. She graduated in 1983, divorced in 1984. Her first job after graduation was at American Express, a company so focussed on its corporate identity that it regularly convened a “branding committee” to scrutinize every new product, advertisement, and mail solicitation. Carpenter was soon put in charge of a credit-related unit, but she chafed at the company’s methodical pace. She quit after five years to become the president of Time-Life Video, a small, Virginia-based division of Time Warner, which sold mail-order videos. Here, too, she disliked the “dusty, slow-moving” culture of Time-Life, but she was impressed by the entertainment executives on the Warner side of the company. “For the first time, I had role models, people more like me,” she said. “More independent. Good deal-makers. A little more cowboy energy. They were personalities. They were larger than life.” Carpenter wanted the same thing.\n\nCarpenter sought out the deal-makers she most admired, and one of them, Barry Diller, who was then the chairman of the home-shopping channel QVC, hired her to launch Q2, a more sophisticated cousin of the channel. But Carpenter’s one-year tenure at QVC was turbulent. The channel’s line managers viewed her and her newly hired team as glamorous, overpaid interlopers. Diller became embroiled in a bid to acquire CBS, and had no time to mediate. Carpenter never got the chance to show what she could do with Q2, Diller told me, because “there were too many things that were clanging together at the time.”\n\nCarpenter saw that Q2 had a fundamental flaw. It had targeted the kind of mobile, career-driven audience that did not watch much TV. “The problem for busy regular people is they’re not going to sit there for a week to see if tennis shoes float by,” Carpenter said. “The real thing you needed for that was the Internet.”\n\nThis was 1994. America Online was bracing itself for fundamental change: Microsoft was planning an Internet network, and the practice of charging users by the hour seemed about to give way to flat monthly fees. A.O.L. wanted to investigate Internet shopping as a source of revenue and saw parallels in Carpenter’s Q2 experience. In February, 1995, Ted Leonsis, the president of A.O.L. Services, hired Carpenter as a consultant and gave her a laptop. She went on-line for the first time, and was appalled.\n\n“I thought it just sucked,” she told me. “I thought, How could anything be this bad and be taken this seriously?” What she found appealing, however, was the way groups of like-minded people tended to converge for on-line conversations. “The gay community, the quilt community, the pet community—those things were cooking,” she said.\n\nThat month, a thirty-three-year-old entrepreneur named Robert Levitan came to New York after selling a small video-yearbook company he had founded in North Carolina. His brother had gone to Harvard with Carpenter and suggested that Levitan pay her a call. A few days after they met, she invited him to fly down to A.O.L. headquarters, in Virginia, to sit in on a meeting of the “gooey” team—the GUI, or graphic-user interface, group—which designed online shopping pages. She hired Levitan to assist her as a consultant on new business models.\n\nLater that spring, Carpenter called in Nancy Evans to consult with A.O.L. about starting an on-line magazine that would help subscribers learn how to use the Net. Evans, a friend of Carpenter’s, was a well-known publishing executive. She had been a columnist for Glamour, the editor-in-chief of the Book-of-the-Month Club, the president and publisher of Doubleday, and a founder, with Jann Wenner, of the magazine Family Life. Along the way, she had developed a reputation for having good ideas and high editorial standards. She was equally well known for micromanaging her harried employees and for refusing even to speak to those who displeased her—a treatment that some at Doubleday referred to as “the freeze-out.” Evans was eventually fired. “Nancy’s terrific,” Wenner told me, but he noted that she tended to become “overinvolved in all the minutiae.” As a result, he said, “you get high-quality work, but you get pretty frazzled doing it.” Wenner decided to sell Family Life in 1995, so when Carpenter called Evans she was again out of a job.\n\nAt A.O.L., Carpenter, Evans, and Levitan began discussing ideas for a new on-line venture. Off-line marketers had long agreed that people worried most about three things: family, health, and career. Carpenter and Evans, both mothers, believed that their first site should be for parents. Levitan agreed, and soon found himself using his new laptop to write a business plan. “I was thinking, What a wonderful world, and what a lucky guy I was,” said Levitan, who has dark, youthful looks and a soft, adolescent voice. “The sense of possibility is what overtook me.”\n\nIn the summer of 1995—the summer that Netscape went public and kicked off a frenzy of Internet investment—Carpenter, Evans, and Levitan rented temporary offices on Fifteenth Street and chose a corporate name. Carpenter loved the word “village,” for its evocation of a village green. Levitan proposed adding the “i,” for interactive. For the site itself, Carpenter wanted a name that captured both the paradox and the community of parenthood, Levitan said. The result was “Parent Soup.”\n\nAt the time, iVillage was proposing something daring. It sought to harness the community energy of the Web to produce a for-profit business by selling products and advertising. Carpenter took the business plan to A.O.L.’s Leonsis, who had begun seeding new Internet companies through his “Greenhouse” program. He offered to invest a million dollars. But Carpenter wanted a bigger commitment than he had made to other startups. She asked for two million, and got it, although Leonsis did express one reservation. He told Carpenter, mostly joking, “I think you’re too old.”\n\nInstead, she was too early. iVillage quickly discovered that the on-line audience was still far too small to support product sales, or E-commerce. Carpenter continued to believe that sales would eventually be an important source of revenue, but she temporarily changed strategy, to emphasize advertising revenue. What she had in mind, however, was not just the rectangular “banner” ads that had begun appearing at the top of Web-site pages throughout the Internet. Instead, iVillage proposed giving sponsors a greater role in content, which the company hoped would entice them to sign contracts for longer terms and greater amounts of money. Carpenter’s initial goal was to secure six of these integrated sponsorships at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars apiece. She dispatched Levitan to recruit them.\n\nAt the time, most of the companies Levitan approached had no idea what an on-line advertisement might look like. “Frankly, the company should have gone out of business,” said Dan Ambrose, a media consultant who was hired to help guide Levitan. It was only through “masterly salesmanship,” Ambrose told me, that Levitan was able to secure half a million dollars in commitments from five major corporations: Toyota, Nissan, M-G-M, Starbucks, and Polaroid. In this phase of the startup, Levitan was the company’s “rainmaker,” according to one of iVillage’s early investors. But Carpenter told me that she and Evans saw him as “kind of a junior partner, which he always felt was unfair.” Their styles clashed. Carpenter and Evans had private offices. Levitan, a decade younger, preferred to work among the junior staff, many of whom adored him.\n\niVillage’s initial seed money ran out in April, 1996, just a few months after the company launched “Parent Soup.” Its highest-paid employees skipped a paycheck, and Carpenter and Evans used their checking accounts to cover the rest of the payroll. A.O.L. lent the company another half million dollars. In May, iVillage received a crucial infusion of twelve million dollars from several investors, including the prestigious Silicon Valley venture-capital firm of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.\n\nCarpenter had courted Kleiner not so much for the money—although iVillage clearly needed it—as for the prestige that its investment would confer on the company, and on her. The firm, headquartered in Menlo Park, has a reputation for picking big winners, from A.O.L. to Amazon, so its investment in a new company greatly reassures other investors.\n\nInitially, Kleiner had had little interest in iVillage. It had focussed its Internet investments mainly on bedrock companies, which produced search engines or provided access to the Net. But Carpenter was persistent, and Kleiner “wanted to deepen our relationship with A.O.L.,” said Will Hearst, one of the firm’s partners. Eventually, Kleiner invested in iVillage because “it was something that A.O.L. had committed to.” With Kleiner’s cash and good name, iVillage won the attention of Habib Kairouz, the managing director of the investment firm Rho Management, who soon agreed to help recruit investors for a “private placement” that brought iVillage $20.5 million, and who later became a member of the company’s board of directors.\n\nKairouz, who was born in Lebanon, is thirty-three years old, and works out of offices on the forty-third floor of the General Motors Building, with unobstructed views north over Central Park. Kleiner’s investment, he told me, meant “I didn’t need to look into Candice’s background to see if she was a crook.” Even so, his firm spent a month scrutinizing the company, debriefing advertisers, assessing the underlying technology, and evaluating management. Kairouz was impressed with iVillage’s ability to attract and hold a large community of users—to “aggregate” an audience, in Net jargon. Audience was real estate, and whoever secured the most real estate first was bound to win. He wasn’t put off by the company’s reputation for ripping through cash. “We’re very strong believers that the Internet is a race, and you have to move very quickly to establish the brand and ramp up the traffic,” he told me.\n\nKairouz was concerned, however, over whether Carpenter had assembled a management team capable of building the company. “Candice came across as very aggressive, somebody who can get there, but not necessarily somebody who can get there by dotting the ‘i’s and crossing the ‘t’s every step of the way,” he said. “She needed strong lieutenants who pulled the reins every now and then—somebody to force people to stick to their budgets.” At the time, iVillage had no permanent chief financial officer, no chief technology officer, and—Levitan aside—no seasoned advertising executive. Carpenter agreed with Kairouz’s assessment and assured him she was already building such a team.\n\nBut recruiting did not go smoothly. In September, 1997, iVillage hired Joanne O’Rourke Hindman to become C.F.O. Four months later, Carpenter fired her. “I’m not sure where it failed,” Kairouz said. “You always have very good people joining organizations, but they don’t fit. She simply didn’t fit.”\n\nA succession of advertising executives came and went before Carpenter finally hired an executive she believed to have impeccable credentials: Steve Carter, the head of sales for NBC’s cable operations, who joined the company as the executive vice-president of sponsorships. After ten months, she fired him, too. “He just didn’t get his hands around the Internet,” Kairouz said. “And at the end of the day, what happened is we missed our numbers.”\n\nMeanwhile, costs kept going up. Large, commercial Web sites are expensive to create, and even more expensive to sustain. Once they are up and running, their content must be continually refreshed. Also, i Village struck costly deals with other major Web sites, search engines, and portals, paying them a fee to steer visitors to iVillage. The $20.5 million was already going quickly when Carpenter proposed another major shift in strategy.\n\nBy the summer of 1997, iVillage was operating four channels, including its flagship site, “Parent Soup.” Each channel was a distinct Web site and was linked only by common parentage. To brand a Web site, Carpenter knew, was an expensive proposition. To create compelling brand identities for four sites now seemed untenable. She knew also that women, who were finally coming on-line, made up more than seventy per cent of the company’s audience. iVillage, she resolved, would officially become a women’s site and link all its channels under a single umbrella brand, iVillage.com. At the time, this shift was considered risky, if not foolhardy. “Today,” Carpenter told me, “the women’s market on the Internet is considered one of the ground-zero places to be. I can’t tell you how not true this was a year and a half ago.” Similarly, advertising a Web site on television, now a common practice, was novel in 1997, when Carpenter began planning the company’s first on-air campaign. But this repositioning was expensive, and by the end of 1997 the company again was running low on cash. Carpenter needed another private placement, but hoped that this would be a “mezzanine” offering—that is, the last round of financing before going public.\n\nWhen it comes to raising money, an executive who can tell a good story has a huge advantage. Among Net investors, the word “story” is fast replacing the term “business plan,” as if hard numerical reality were being supplanted by art. Tom Mahoney, who at that time worked at Deutsche Bank, led the mezzanine round. Carpenter’s ability to pitch herself and her company was “mission critical,” he told me. “There were other women’s sites. Hearst owned HomeArts. There was women.com. There were definitely some competitors. But what set Candice’s company apart was Candice.” Investors placed orders for twice the equity that iVillage planned to sell. In February, 1998, the mezzanine round netted $31.5 million.\n\nThe next logical step was to go public. An I.P.O. typically lets a company raise more money than it could through private placements, and provides other benefits as well. Companies generally issue only a fraction of their total capital stock, but a rising price for those shares increases the entire net worth of the company, which allows it to make deals that closely held companies cannot afford. Finally, an I.P.O. is the carrot that allows Internet companies to attract talented employees with stock options rather than big salaries.\n\nIn bankers’ parlance, anyone who is holding stock at the offering price when a company goes public is in line for “free money,” since most new issues will rise in value at least temporarily. Banks compete ferociously to lead promising I.P.O.s, both because the leader gets the biggest share of the offering fees and because a successful offer is likely to lure other C.E.O.s who are intent on taking their companies public. This world has its own stars, the public-market equivalents of Kleiner, and one of the brightest is Mary Meeker, the celebrated research analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, whose job is to identify compelling new ventures and to support the stocks of companies her firm has already taken public, a list that includes A.O.L. and Netscape. Not surprisingly, Carpenter made an effort to cultivate Meeker, who became for a time an unofficial adviser to iVillage. Meeker urged Carpenter, for example, to seek an alliance with a big, off-line media company—in particular, NBC. Though six investment banks were invited to compete for leadership of the iVillage I.P.O. in a so-called bake-off, Meeker believed that Carpenter had all but committed the lead to Morgan Stanley.\n\nBut in June, iVillage at last hired a chief financial officer, Craig Monaghan. He had been the treasurer of Reader’s Digest, where he developed a close working relationship with bankers at Goldman Sachs, and he strongly recommended them to Carpenter. iVillage gave the lead to Goldman, and the second position to Credit Suisse First Boston. Meeker was furious. She and Carpenter engaged in a heated phone conversation—although both now seek to downplay the incident.\n\nOn August 10th, the bankers met to plan the iVillage offering. Participants doled out responsibilities—most important, the preparation of a prospectus and an S-1 registration to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the creation of the road show, a gruelling feature of every I.P.O., in which Carpenter would pitch the company to investors around the nation just before the offering began. Three weeks later, however, the market crashed, and “everything just stopped,” Monaghan said. “It was the biggest drought in I.P.O.s in ten years.”\n\nNow iVillage faced a crisis. Once again, it was almost out of cash, but in that hostile market, Monaghan believed, it would be mad to go public. Some board members wanted to take the gamble. The company was racing to secure Internet turf and the competition was intensifying: the Hearst Corporation, which had failed in an earlier attempt to acquire a stake in iVillage, was clearly planning to enter the women’s market. “To remain No.1,” Kairouz told me, “we knew that we had to spend. America Online spent a billion dollars to become what it is today.” The board voted to postpone the I.P.O. and arrange one more round of private financing. iVillage distributed additional equity, worth $32.1 million, to eager investors.\n\nAs the company grew, so did internal tensions, particularly between generations. Talented young employees were constantly going to Carpenter with their latest job offers and demanding more money. And every employee, it seemed, wanted to go out and start her own company. At first, Carpenter reacted with sympathy. “They saw their parents give and give and give and then in the end the corporation kind of screwed them anyway,” she told me. “So I think their feeling is they’re not going to repeat that.”\n\nFinally, Carpenter fired five young but high-ranking employees and replaced them with “grownups.” She told the magazine Fast Company, “These young people are smart, but in some ways that can be dangerous. They’re so sure they’re right. So we kicked some of them out. We felt like we were being held hostage by these twentysomethings.”\n\nWithin iVillage, the article caused a spike of hostility among the younger employees. Many staffers also began to resent the management style of Nancy Evans, who oversaw all content on the iVillage sites. “She freezes you out and you never even know why,” one former senior iVillage manager told me, echoing earlier complaints at Doubleday. Levitan, in particular, seemed to become disenchanted with Evans, and with his position in the company. The new focus on women and Carpenter’s efforts to hire another ad executive were pushing him toward the margins of iVillage.\n\nAround the time of the organizational meeting, iVillage held a retreat for about sixty managers at a resort in Connecticut. It was meant to build cohesion among the staff, but, instead, it seemed to exacerbate generational tensions. The Fast Company article had just come out. Carpenter left a day early, and the “kids” stayed up drinking, skinny-dipping, and playing all-night volleyball. The next morning, some overslept and missed the start of a series of games meant to build teamwork. An older executive angrily accused some young managers of not taking the games seriously. What most troubled those at the retreat, however, was the fact that Evans never showed up. For two weeks or so, she disappeared from view, with no explanation. Rumors spread that she was about to quit. Evans later explained to me that another media company had offered to buy iVillage, and she needed time to think about whether she could remain if the acquisition occurred. “It was a major fork in the road, with a big decision to make,” she said. iVillage turned down the offer.\n\nThat winter, the markets rebounded. On December 2nd, Carpenter convened a company-wide meeting at the Toy Center, nearby on Fifth Avenue, to announce that iVillage would at last file its public offering. She announced, too, a key alliance with NBC, which would provide iVillage with millions of dollars of prime-time advertising on shows like “Friends” and “ER,” in return for a combination of cash and equity. But she had other news as well: Robert Levitan was leaving. (Soon afterward, he launched an on-line gift-certificate company called Flooz.com.) When Carpenter invited Levitan onto the stage, two hundred people rose from their seats and, with cheers and applause, urged him to the podium. “I could feel the love in the room,” Levitan told me. “If you’re going to go, that’s the way to go.”\n\nA week later, on December 11th, iVillage filed its I.P.O. registration with the S.E.C. and entered a “quiet period”—the time between the filing date and the twenty-fifth day after the stock begins trading, during which employees are forbidden to promote the company or its stock. For iVillage, this period was hardly quiet. Earlier, Geraldine Laybourne, who had turned Nickelodeon into one of the top cable-TV brands, and who had run Disney’s cable operations, had announced the formation of a new women’s network, Oxygen Media, which would include a Web site and a cable-TV channel. Now the press was awarding her victory in the race to dominate the women’s “space” on the Internet. Citing three core cyber-properties she had acquired from A.O.L., and a partnership she had formed with Oprah Winfrey and Carsey-Werner, producers of “The Cosby Show” and “Roseanne,” Wired magazine in February declared that iVillage had been “surpassed overnight by an old media superstar.” Meanwhile, in January, Hearst at last acquired control of a women’s Web site—women.com—and merged it with its own women’s site, HomeArts, to create Women.com Networks, LLC.\n\nIn the midst of all this, a former iVillage executive named Todd Kenner filed a lawsuit that ended up in federal court, charging iVillage with fraud and breach of contract. Carpenter, he claimed, had promised him a small fortune in stock options to induce him to move to New York from Tennessee, then abruptly fired him and reneged on the promise. iVillage denied the allegations. In early March, just days before the I.P.O. took place, two other former executives—Joanne Hindman, the fired chief financial officer, and Steve Carter, the fired executive vice-president of sponsorships—made declarations in support of Kenner’s lawsuit, claiming that they, too, were owed stock options. iVillage has denied these claims, as well.\n\nDuring the road show for iVillage, in which Carpenter visited twenty-five cities in eleven days and made eighty presentations, she asked investors at each stop if they wanted her to address the lawsuit. According to Carpenter, none did. In fact, demand for the iVillage offering was so intense that allocating the I.P.O. shares became a ticklish matter. Early backers found themselves having to share the “free money” with new investors who had been invited to participate by Carpenter and by Goldman Sachs, which had long-standing clients to take care of. One of those early backers, Dana Callow, of Boston Millennia Partners, protested to Carpenter, although by last spring, when I spoke to him on the phone, he had become more philosophical. “You’ve got a deal that’s very hot, it’s thirty-eight times oversubscribed,” he said. The challenge was to allocate shares and not alienate loyal investors and customers. “Would I like to have done more? Yes,” he said. “On the other hand, the deal was managed well . . . and the outcome was achieved.”\n\nLate in the afternoon of Thursday, March 18th, after the markets closed, a committee of bankers and iVillage officials, including Carpenter and Kairouz, met in the Goldman Sachs conference room to set an offering price for the stock. Establishing this price is an art, in which several considerations come into play. The price must be high enough to raise lots of capital, but not so high that it risks an embarrassing slide on the first day of trading or fails to create the spread that delivers “free money” to inside investors. Originally, iVillage planned to go public at a price somewhere between twelve dollars and fourteen dollars a share, but in the light of the intense demand from investors, the committee set the final price at twenty-four dollars—cause for celebration. Members of the pricing committee and some two dozen iVillage employees ate cake and drank champagne in a Goldman conference room. At twenty-four dollars a share, iVillage would immediately make $91.6 million on the offering, and the banking syndicate would net $7.1 million. The timing was perfect: on the eve of the I.P.O., the Dow Jones industrial average soared to a new record.\n\nOn Friday morning, Robert Levitan sat in front of his computer at the Times Square offices of Flooz.com. “Instant” E-mail messages from his former colleagues at iVillage began bursting on the screen. They thanked him for hiring them, and for helping to build the company. “I was a little numb about the whole thing,” Levitan told me. (He would not disclose his stake in iVillage.) “You know, it was, like, pinch me, what have we done.” He took a subway downtown to iVillage, and was greeted by exuberant employees, who hugged him and kissed him.\n\nCarpenter and Evans had been invited to the Goldman Sachs offices at One New York Plaza to witness iVillage’s final steps toward becoming a publicly traded company. Guided by Lawrence Calcano, a Goldman managing director, they entered the firm’s vast trading floor. A hundred traders staffed the nasdaq “desk,” which now snapped with energy: The traders cracked jokes and teased the founders. “They were kind of cute, wild guys,” Carpenter said.\n\nThroughout the morning, the traders worked to establish a début price for the stock, a point of equilibrium between the price at which sellers were willing to sell and buyers willing to buy. Each trader fed his latest bid and offer prices to a senior trader, who was responsible for establishing an “orderly” market for the stock. At about noon, this trader believed that a consensus had been reached and declared a time-out—a customary fifteen-minute period during which traders make no more calls. The floor grew quiet. The time-out ended. The nasdaq desk at Goldman exploded into life again. Suddenly, a new symbol began moving across Goldman’s stock ticker: “ivil.” Carpenter and Evans held hands. “It’s like watching yourself from out of your body,” Carpenter said. “It is. It’s hard to explain.”\n\nEven harder to explain was the first number that followed the ivil symbol, the first price offered for the stock: $95.88. The trading floor roared again. Block after block of iVillage shares now marched across the Goldman ticker. “We were a little stunned,” Carpenter said. “We were a little disoriented, actually. It’s a very surreal thing to happen.” It was thrilling. It was sobering. She sought an analogy from her mountaineering past. “We were leaving the foothills and going up into the big icy mountains,” she said. From here on, she knew, “everything would just get harder.”\n\nBack at iVillage, employees had been watching their computer monitors, waiting for news of that first trade. “I’ll never forget when the first trade came out,” said Hillary Graves, vice-president of media. “My entire floor stood up and screamed.”\n\nCarpenter and Evans remained at Goldman for half an hour, then went back uptown to the iVillage offices. On each floor, they were greeted with cheers, hugs, and wild applause. Carpenter had promised employees that this day would come. Some now told her they had not believed her. “They were just delirious,” she said. “I mean, I was, like, peeling them off the ceiling. It was lovely.” Carpenter told me this over breakfast at the Hotel Carlyle, near her home, and as she spoke tears suddenly welled in her eyes. Her voice wobbled. “I have this tremendous sense of, um, of having delivered to all these people.” She dabbed her eyes with a Carlyle napkin. “It was a great feeling. You know, that all these people had believed in us, in our leadership, through thick and thin.”\n\nBut the best moment, she said, came when she opened the door to her apartment and was greeted by her five-year-old daughter, Michaela, wide-eyed and adoring. Twenty bouquets of flowers had arrived throughout the day. Michaela understood, maybe for the first time, that her mother’s long days at work had accomplished something huge.\n\nWhen the markets closed that day, iVillage stock was posted at $80.13 a share, meaning that the day traders who had placed overnight orders to buy the stock at its opening price of $95.88, expecting to be rich by dinnertime, were deeply disappointed. Not so the big investors and company associates who had been able to buy at the I.P.O. price. They immediately earned free money of fifty-six dollars per share, though how many decided to cash out immediately is unknown. Carpenter, Evans, and other senior executives were bound by agreements that required them to hold on to their stock for six months. At four o’clock that afternoon, when nasdaq trading closed, Candice Carpenter’s stake—including six hundred and ninety thousand and one shares of stock, and unexercised options to buy more—was worth over eighty million dollars.\n\nIn the six months since its I.P.O., iVillage has hired several seasoned executives and secured roughly thirty new sponsors. In what it called a breakthrough partnership with the milk industry, iVillage established a “behavior-modification program” of “weekly chats, E-mail reminders, and lively message boards” to encourage “the habit of drinking three glasses of milk per day.” Its acquisition, in August, of Lamaze Publishing gave it control of a company that operates several magazines for new and impending parents, a direct-mail program, and The Newborn Channel, which broadcasts instructional information to new mothers in more than eight hundred hospitals around the country. This winter, iVillage plans to spend about twenty-eight million dollars on broadcast advertising above and beyond promotions set to air on NBC as part of their corporate alliance.\n\nFor now, Oxygen Media is less of a threat than Wired had predicted. Its Web site, which seems much less polished, has yet to make the Media Metrix top fifty. Instead, iVillage’s toughest competitor is proving to be Hearst’s Women.com Networks, which last May filed its own I.P.O., with Morgan Stanley as its lead banker and Mary Meeker as its market champion. Around that time, it launched a prime-time advertising campaign and became, briefly, the leading women’s property on the Media Metrix top fifty. This did not please iVillage, which ran a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal on July 29th sniffing that Women.com had taken a shortcut to prominence by combining two lesser Web sites. “There’s a difference,” the ad’s headline stated, “between aggregating web sites and building the leading brand.” In July’s rankings, iVillage regained the lead.\n\nYet it remains unclear whether any of these sites will ever become a viable company. Given iVillage’s growth and spending plans, its I.P.O. cash will not last long, and investors eventually will demand a profit, or turn against the stock. Lately, the stock market has been hard on Net companies of all kinds. It has been brutal to iVillage. Initially, the furious demand drove the price up to a hundred and thirty dollars. Since then, the stock has been in a long, fairly steady decline, and in August it hit $25.50, just a dollar and a half above the offering price. On Friday, October 1st, it closed at $34. During that slide, a lot of small investors lost money, but so did the insiders, who were locked in until September 15th. On that date, Carpenter’s paper wealth was closer to forty million dollars than to eighty million. She contends, however, that such fluctuations do not trouble her. “This is the roller coaster,” she told me. “And that’s what I signed up to be on.” ♦"
