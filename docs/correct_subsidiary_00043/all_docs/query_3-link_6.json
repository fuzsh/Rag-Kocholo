        "text": "US media giant NBC Universal is to buy iVillage, the network of women's websites, for $600m (£340m).\n\nNBC Universal today revealed it would acquire iVillage, a New York-based business that was founded in 1995 and set up a British arm in 2000.\n\nThe network covers women's interest topics such as relationships, parenting, pregnancy, health, beauty and astrology.\n\nThe deal, which is to be completed in the second quarter of the year, is the latest attempt by established media companies to develop their web assets and make the internet integral to their business.\n\nRupert Murdoch's News Corporation spent a similar amount - $580m - on Intermix Media, the owner of online teenage network MySpace.com.\n\nViacom has bought an online games site, the iFilm short films site and is keen to invest in \"social networking\" websites.\n\nNBC Universal is majority owned by General Electric and was formed from the merger of the NBC television network and the Universal entertainment assets once owned by French group Vivendi.\n\n· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"
