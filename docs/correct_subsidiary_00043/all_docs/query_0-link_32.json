        "text": "2. What is Universal Studios? Universal Studios Inc. (is also know as Universal Pictures), is an American film studio. And it is one of Hollywood’s “Big Six” film studios. Universal Studios was founded in April 30, 1912 (as Universal Film Manufacturing Company). The founders were Carl Laemmle, Pat Powers, Mark Dintenfass, William Swanson, David Horsley, Charles Baumann, Adam Kessel and Jules Brulatour. The headquarters is at Universal City, California, U.S.\n\n3. Who owns them? (Parent Company) The Parent Company is NBC Universal, Inc. (Comcast Corporation). Even more the Subsidiaries are Universal Animation Studios, Focus Features, Illumination Entertainment, Working Title Films, Universal Studios Home, Entertainment and United International Pictures (50%).\n\n4. Who else do they own? Universal Studios owns Focus features as Universal Studios is the parent company to Focus Features.\n\n5. What else does the Parent Company own? NBC Universal also owns NBC, Universal Pictures, Universal Parks and Resorts, Focus Features, Telemundo, Telemundo Puerto Rico, USA Network, Syfy, Chiller, E!, CNBC, MSNBS, NBC.COM, iVillage, PictureBox Movies, Bravo, Esquire Network, Telemundo Television Studios, The Weather Company (partial), Hulu (32%). Furthermore they are subsidiaries.\n\n7. Connotations/Description of the Logo The world connotes everyone as that is what universal means and it fits in with the name, which is quite ironic. The typography of the Universal is bold, all capital letters and sans serif. Then \"UNIVERSAL\" in white with golden bordering rises upward as the sun pans down, and light glows on the continents.\n\n8. How has the logo changed over time and why? The logo has changed a lot from the original logo but they have the similar ideas of what type of logo their trying to present, the ideas are of the world being shown and the typography being bold and to stand out to the audience. But they adapted the logo over time from technology becoming better, which now they created a 3D effect on logo than having a 2D effect originally, that’s how the logo has changed over time."
