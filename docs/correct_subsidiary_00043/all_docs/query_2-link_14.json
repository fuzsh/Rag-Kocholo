        "text": "NBCUniversal's 2024 Upfront is one for the books. As you heard me say, NBCUniversal isn’t about one single thing. It’s about everything... the totality of our assets across content, audiences and technology... and the CONNECTIONS that form between them. At NBCUniversal, our number one goal is to drive media effectiveness for our marketing partners. And we know having a product show up in moments of consumer connection is THE path forward for brands. Through our technology like One Platform Total Audience, advertisers can find strategic audiences across linear AND digital, forging connections on one media plan. The results? They blew us away. Our partners saw +38% in-target cross-platform reach, +22% in search volume, and +38% in sales compared to a traditional plan. This is the future of advertising: leveraging television – both linear and digital – to find and deeply connect with strategic audiences, to achieve measurable impact across every layer of the funnel. At the end of the day, our content is built for YOU. Our audience segmentation is designed to make YOUR viewing experience curated and enjoyable and drive effectiveness for YOUR advertising investments. And our results are shared with YOU in a fully, transparent way – not another walled garden. We are bringing together the art and the science for our marketing partners like no one else. Because television isn’t just about one thing. It’s about everything. And it's built in partnership with you. Thank you, Mark Lazarus, Donna Langley DBE, Cesar Conde for joining me on stage and helping bring our story to life."
