        "text": "IVillage, which was acquired by NBC Universal in 2006, is a content-led online community for women, with expert features on health, lifestyle and entertainment.\n\nThe revamped site includes improved community message boards, allowing faster posting, search and navigation.\n\nProfile pages have been enhanced to give users the opportunity to upload photos and personalise their pages for the first time, and branded message boards that create new advertising platforms have also been included.\n\nAlexandra Burke, 2008's 'X Factor' winner has been enlisted to blog on beauty, while Shayne Ward, 2005's winner, will blog as an \"agony uncle\".\n\nFormer 'Blue Peter' presenter Katy Hill will blog about family and parenting issues and 'Britain’s Next Top Model' presenter Lisa Butcher will write about fashion.\n\nMike Skagerlind, senior vice president and general manager of iVillage, said the UK redesign follows a re-launch of its US site in September, which resulted in an increase of users and advertisers.\n\nIVillage has also signed a deal with advertising network Web TV Enterprise to stream its premium video-on-demand content on the re-launched site. It will feature daily updates from the US entertainment site E! Online, which selected Web TV Enterprise to sell ads around its video content.\n\nIVillage will also stream E! News, food recipes, gardening advice, health and beauty tips and daily horoscopes.\n\nEarlier this year, iVillage began broadcasting TV shows, including Channel 4’s ‘Trinny and Susannah: What they did next’ and CBNC’s finance show ‘Strictly Money’.\n\nIt said it is planning more TV deals for 2011."
