Good riddance! Maybe it will be enough room after all.\n\nI do hope though that if Shrek DOES stay that they update the queue and facade to not look so tacky and out of place right next to Hogsmeade.\n\nThis has me wondering.....the Studio Tour Entrance is right by Curious George. Do you think the entrance will be changed once Potter moves? I would think not, only because they recently added a bunch of new things to the studio tour entrance facilities and added that new bathroom.\n\nApr 24, 2013\n\n#8\n\nI can't wait till they finally break some ground for this construction.

First off, there's no space for a massive ride like Gringotts anywhere in the park. If we can't have diagon alley, I don't wanna see Gringotts.\n\nAlso, I'm still gonna be hoping that Flight of the Hippogriff will be included out doors. It has a relatively small foot print, and would add a ride capacity.\n\nIf they don't put in hippogriff as a coaster, I can see them still including Hagrid's hut in the corner next to Hogwarts and maybe have a meet and greet with a hippogriff animatronic.\n\nApr 13, 2013\n\n140\n\n132\n\nSoCal\n\nApr 24, 2013\n\n#15\n\nThis is great news. It's nice to see that USH can compete with USO on some levels. I just hope USH doesn't become %80 Potter.

I expect potter to be kinda hidden from the rest of the park kinda like the Gibson in now and doubt the there will be multiple ways to enter this new HP area. Will probably see a new divider in the park were curious George is at. That probably why they built the new plaza as to alleviate the traffic from creating a new barrier by Shrek. Either way im so excited to see what will come. I was kinda surprised Universal posted about the approval(on multi social media outlets) of the plan, that was out of left field.\n\nAllen The Actor\n\nAllen The Actor\n\nJan 10, 2013\n\n4,829\n\n2,374\n\nHill Valley, California\n\nApr 24, 2013\n\n#18\n\nThe new central park is definitely there to help alleviate the crowds. I'm curious what the back of Hogsmeade Village, facing Universal Plaza, will look like!\n\nReactions: BernardMesa\n\nFeb 2, 2013\n\n2,336\n\n768\n\nArizona.\n\nApr 24, 2013\n\n#19\n\nGibson Amphitheatre To Close In September As Part Of Universal Studios RevampBy THE DEADLINE TEAM | www.deadline.comI Wednesday April 24, 2013 @ 1:01pm PDTTags: Gibson Amphitheatre, Universal Studios\n\nTodayâs announcement that the Gibson Amphitheatre on the Universal CityWalk is going dark for good puts an end to a 40-year chapter in LA concert history. The former Universal Amphitheatre was rumored to be on the chopping block amid the flurry of redevelopment at Universal Studios that begins in the summer â the venueâs lease agreement is set to expire in September. But the 6,000-plus-seat hall has struggled to consistently book big-name acts amid competition from LA Liveâs Nokia Theatre, which opened in 2007, and subscription partner the Greek Theatre; the Gibsonâs 2013 schedule is heavy with international acts including Gloria Trevi, Il Volo and Eros Ramazzotti and Lila Downs. A handful of already booked post-September shows â including the 10th anniversary of the Brian Setzer Orchaestraâs annual Christmas Rocks gala â will be rerouted to other venues. Live Nation said its Southern California office will âassemble a very special lineup of shows as a fitting farewellâ to the Gibson.\n\nDoes that make it clear...."
