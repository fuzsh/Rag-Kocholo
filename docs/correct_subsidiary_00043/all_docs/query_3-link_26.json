        "text": "Inspired by the GE/NBC Universal Ecomagination Initiative, iVillage Will Offer Women Simple Ways to Help Protect the Environment\n\nGE-EcomaginationNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--With the launch of its new iGo Green channel this week, iVillage, the largest community of women online, will show women across the country just how easy it is to go green. From organic food to recycled fashion to eco-friendly home d√©cor, iGo Green will offer female-focused editorial, quick and simple ideas, tools and other features around living the green life.\n\nWith the new channel www.igogreen.ivillage.com, iVillage is doing its part to support GE's ecomagination, a company-wide movement committed to addressing the most pressing environmental challenges. NBC Universal, parent company of iVillage, will champion ecomagination with its \"Get On Board\" program, including a commitment to environmentally conscious film and TV production, improved energy efficiency and environmental awareness (see separate press release). \"Get On Board\" coincides with the release of the eco-topical comedy Evan Almighty from Universal Pictures, premiering June 22.\n\n\"iVillage has always provided women with unique tools and content to simplify their lives,\" said Deborah Fine, President of iVillage. \"With the passion of ecomagination upon us, we have an enormous opportunity to tailor the green message to women so they can make quick and easy contributions without sacrificing time or style.\"\n\niGo Green will show women how to do the planet right without changing their entire lifestyle:\n\nLittle changes, big difference: On the site, women will find hundreds of ideas for going green, from unplugging a cell phone charger to skipping bottled water in favor of tap. A basic 101 guide to green will cover the three R's (reduce, recycle, reuse), energy consumption at home, climate change, water conservation, toxins and more.\n\nThe green scene: Slide shows profiling movers and shakers in the Green movement, including fashion designers and entertainment personalities and a Green Moms blog powered by high profile, environmentally conscious moms, including Gay Browne, founder of Greenopia.\n\nWhere are you on the green curve? A BP-created tool will ask dozens of lifestyles questions, then show you on a scale how eco-minded you really are. Then, iVillage's Green Machine chooser tool will share easy ways to green-ify every aspect of your life. A carbon calculator on the site will determine how much carbon you're burning and what you would need to do to offset it (planting a tree might do the trick).\n\nG is for green...and glamorous of course. iGo Green will offer suggestions on the best all-natural beauty products (chemical-free and still stunning!), eco-friendly fashion (be the first to get yoga slip-ons made from 100% recycled rubber!) and endless choices on how to green-ify your home without sacrificing style.\n\nFood for thought: Tips on buying green, seasonal recipes, growing your own and more. And for moms, the best organic baby foods.\n\nHybrid hub: iVillage Connect, the site's social networking platform will feature several green groups, from Prius drivers to all-organic clothing so that users can upload video and photos and blog with friends.\n\nThe sustainable family: Overview for parents on how to teach kids of all ages about being green, why it's important, including easy steps for each age group (from preschoolers to high schoolers). Plus, environmentally friendly family vacations.\n\nThe iGo Green site will also feature iVillage's popular Stuff We Love franchise with weekly picks from Ideal Bite on eco-friendly beauty, style, home and parenting products; blogs with the latest green ideas and tips; Fast Facts provided by Green Order with important environmental statistics, a user-generated \"ticker\" that runs across the top of the site featuring daily go green efforts from users and a weekly newsletter and sweepstakes.
