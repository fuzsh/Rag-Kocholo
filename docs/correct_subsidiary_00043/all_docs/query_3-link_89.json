        "text": "My role is primarily that of a facilitator for the women of IVillage. I encourage personality development and support learning and skill acquisition through well defined methods and process. Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to see these women evolve into independent and confident individuals.\n\nTogether as a team we ensure quality production in adherence to promised standards and timelines.\n\nIVillage is a social organisation with a clear vision of supporting women in the rural areas so that they can be economically independent and get the chance to educate their children. Working in IVillage gives us immense opportunities to learn new skills and train new talent who have a passion to work in our sector. The biggest responsibility is being responsible towards the life of others and creating job opportunities for them.\n\nAs opposed to the corporate sector, IVillage has not only given me tremendous growth and learning but also given me the chance to give back to society. I am proud to be working here.\n\nI have been working with IVillage for 15 years now in training girls for different kinds of embroidery I am happy working here and my home is also nearby so I don’t have to go far away from home to work.\n\nIt gives me a sense of achievement when I see the ladies that we train become financially independent and capable to take care of themselves.\n\nIVillage is a platform for rural girls and women empowerment. We want them to be Socially Economically empowered, Self dependent and Successful.\n\nI am proud to be associated with IVilllage, through which we are trying to help them avail the best opportunities for development in their neighborhood and in the process make them self dependent, successful, aware of the world and most importantly, become Socially and Economically empowered.\n\nI have always been very passionate about art and design and seek opportunities to use my best creative skills. IVillage has provided me a platform not only to explore my creativity but also bring a little change in the society by uplifting the rural households.\n\nBeing a part of IVillage helps me to understand the traditional artforms and gives a chance to transform them with a modern contemporary twist.\n\nI have learnt and developed new skill sets that has helped me evolve not only as an individual but also as a great team member. Cheers to my journey at IVillage!\n\nI always had a knack for communicating ideas creatively and effectively, whether in the form of design or writing, and I wanted to put my skills to good use. I came across IVillage and instantly connected with their vision. Their drive towards uplifting the community has always inspired me, and I feel proud to be useful to their cause.\n\nI am working with IVillage since 15 years. It gives me pleasure to work here and a feeling of satisfaction when I train the girls. I am also in charge of the store at our production center. I am happy that not only am I able to contribute to my family income and take care of my family by myself, I also help other women do the same for themselves.\n\nIt has been an immensely rewarding experience to work at the grassroots level with rural women to see them break the shackles of patriarchy and evolve into empowered, socially and economically independent individuals is perhaps the biggest achievement.\n\nWith the team’s shared passion for social entrepreneurship, we truly live our motto of ‘Taking the village to the world’.\n\nI am delighted to work at IVillage as I am able to help to the rural women working here and provide them employment near their homes so they don’t have to go far away. In this way they can take care of their financial needs as well as their families. I have learnt many new things at IVillage and I am happy to be a part of it.\n\nI am happy to work here at IVillage in the handicraft section. I also train the new trainees. I have learnt a lot here and today I am able to help my family financially. I am happy to help the rural women become independent and earn for themselves.\n\nVeronique Dieu is the creator of SNC.

An expert in infant development, business and human relations, she loves being on the field. She has been actively involved with field work in Asia for 35 years across Thailand, Australia, Japan, China and India.\n\nWhen I came across IVillage through Arya Singh – her passion and vision to enable the village girls to become financially independent resonated with me highly. It pulled me in with the opportunity to volunteer as my capacity of a space planner for their exhibition and retail spaces. It is a great to see how they all give their 100% to make success of an idea, how so ever impossible it may sound due to manpower or budget constraints faced everyday by an NGO. They strive to find the way through or around, rather than dismissing an idea that they all value. Young at heart and mind – the IVillage team is a force to reckon with and ever ready to make “Impossible“ – “Possible”. I am proud to be associated with richly mentored girls who are being guided with a clear vision and mission!\n\nA corporate environment offers opportunity for self growth and development which is more often than not limited to oneself, at Village I get the opportunity to use my skill sets to make an economic and social impact in and for the rural households of Uttar Pradesh. I have been exposed to various forms of learning and development that is not limited to skill for economical endeavours and extends to a purist approach in some aspects of life. A rural household is fine working model of the income and opportunity divide that is prevalent in India, this model is always under the scanner at IVillage in an effort to balance the scales, placing it among some of the most sincere taskforces of India.\n\nI am proud to be associated with an organization that is driving change in the life of women from rural India by providing world class platform for skill development to earn livelihood with dignity.\n\nIVillage focuses on enhancing employment opportunities for rural women to make them part of India GDP growth and at the same time improve standard of living at their homes and larger community. IVillage has a strong belief that the development of women from rural India is a way to develop the nation at large in the long run.\n\nIVillage helps and fosters skilling and development for women to make them financially independent This is a cause that is very close to my heart and I look to help them with my time, guidance and making connections happen whenever I can.\n\nI am encouraged and inspired on how the team is connecting the village to the global market, generating employment for the rural population with a focus on women, by learning, unlearning and upskilling. In my view every drop counts, and if I can be one of these drops in this mega initiative, it’s for me giving back to the society.\n\nS.
