        "text": "Shares of iVillage, the latest profitless Net company to join the dot com club, soared more than 200 percent in the first day of trading on continuing strong demand for Internet-related stocks.\n\nIVillage (IVIL), which runs a network of Web sites for women, debuted at US$24 a share and surged to as high as $100 by midday trading. IVillage closed up $56 -- a gain of 233 percent -- at $80.\n\nIVillage raised $84 million from the IPO, which was underwritten by Goldman Sachs.\n\n\"It's not terribly surprising,\" said Ryan Jacobs, portfolio manager at The Internet Fund. \"It was a very highly anticipated deal.\"\n\nBut Jacobs still found it hard to justify the first-day premiums that Net stocks like iVillage have been generating lately. Other recent Net companies that have seen meteoric rises during first-day trading have watched their shares fizzle in the following days.\n\nIVillage, which runs Web sites and supplies content to America Online, plans to make money through advertising and e-commerce ventures. Most of its material is targeted at women, including chat features and sites offering career and parenting tips.\n\nThe company has had its share of controversy surrounding its business model and backroom record-keeping.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the company's former chief financial officer accused iVillage of inflating revenues to lure investors.\n\n\"Based on my experience at and knowledge of iVillage, I would not be comfortable today being the CFO taking this company public,\" former CFO Joanne Hindman said in an affidavit filed Friday in US District Court in Nashville, Tennessee. The affidavit was one of two filed by former iVillage executives in support of a lawsuit by a third former executive, Todd Kenner.\n\nIVillage has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe company also has a long trail of red ink.\n\nThrough the first nine months of 1998, iVillage spent more than $42 million against revenues of just $9 million. Through its first three years, iVillage has lost a jaw-dropping $65 million, largely on branding campaigns to beef up its online presence.\n\nMoreover, iVillage isn't the only company with a big network of online sites targeted to women.\n\nAmerican Online, a big investor in iVillage, has also bought a stake in one of its biggest competitors, Oxygen media, which also publishes online content targeted at women.\n\nDonald Trump and Silicon Valley's Billionaire Elegy\n\nVenture capitalists Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen claim the tech industry, California, and the country are doomed if we don’t embrace the former president.\n\nRealPage Says Rental Pricing Tech Is Misunderstood, but Landlords Aren’t So Sure\n\nThe software company has pushed back hard against claims that its algorithms helped make rent in the US too damn high. Property owners and managers aren't entirely convinced.\n\nApple, Nvidia, Anthropic Used Thousands of Swiped YouTube Videos to Train AI\n\nCreators claim their videos were used without their knowledge.\n\nOpenAI Slashes the Cost of Using Its AI With a ‘Mini’ Model\n\nWith competing models—including many free ones—flooding the market, OpenAI is announcing a cheaper way to use its AI.\n\nHow to Get Rich From Peeping Inside People’s Fridges\n\nForget the S&P 500. Look at the ice cream. This investor visits homes around the world to see where diets—and economies—will go next."
