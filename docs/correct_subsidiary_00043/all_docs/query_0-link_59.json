        "text": "NBCUniversal Television Group is an American and global television production/distribution company and a subsidiary of NBCUniversal.\n\nThe company is composed of six divisions: Universal Television (formerly Universal Media Studios and NBC Universal Television Studio), NBC Universal Television Stations, NBCUniversal Television Distribution, NBCUniversal International Television, Peacock Productions, and the recently-established Universal Cable Productions.[1]\n\nThe company was previously known as Revue Studios, NBC Studios, Universal Television, and MCA TV. The name was changed to NBC Universal Television on May 12, 2004 from the merger of NBC's production/distribution arm and Universal's television division to reflect the NBC Universal brand.\n\nThe previous name took syndication until September 20, 2004, which was also the date launch of the NBC Uni TV Distribution logo, even though the copyright to the NBC Universal TV shows are now credited to either NBC Studios, Inc., NBC Enterprises, Inc., Universal Network Television LLC, Universal Talk TV Productions, LLC, or otherwise NBC Universal, Inc. (all NBC Universal TV's alternate monikers).\n\nOn June 14, 2007, NBC Universal announced that NBC Universal Television Studio would be renamed, effective immediately, to Universal Media Studios. The parent company, NBC Universal, explained that the reason for the name change of NBC Universal Television was because \"the new name fully describes the company's mission to be the premier content provider for television and digital platforms, spanning all television dayparts and creative genres.\"[2] On September 12, 2011, NBCUniversal announced they will rename Universal Media Studios back to Universal Television.[3]\n\nDVD releases for most shows owned by the group are handled by Universal Studios Home Entertainment, while others are licensed to other companies such as Lionsgate Home Entertainment, Arts Alliance America and Shout! Factory.\n\nFor more details on this topic, see NBC Studios.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n2 Universal Television\n\n3 NBCUniversal Television Stations\n\n4 NBCUniversal Television Distribution\n\n5 NBCUniversal International Television\n\n5.1 American shows owned stateside by other companies\n\n6 References\n\nHistory\n\nMain article: Universal Television#History\n\nUniversal Television\n\nMain article: Universal Television\n\nUniversal Television (formerly NBC Productions, NBC Studios, Universal Network Television NBC Universal Television Studio, and Universal Media Studios) is the television production arm of NBCUniversal that produces network programs that was first established in 1962.\n\nNBCUniversal Television Stations\n\nNBCUniversal Television Stations is another production company that handles series that are aired on NBC owned stations.\n\nNBCUniversal Television Stations Division (TVSD) is an operation division of NBC Universal's owned and operated NBC stations and the following Telemundo Stations:\n\nKNBC, KVEA, and KWHY-TV, Los Angeles\n\nKNSD, San Diego\n\nKNTV and KSTS, San Jose - San Francisco\n\nKXAS-TV and KXTX-TV, Dallas - Fort Worth\n\nWCAU, Philadelphia\n\nWMAQ-TV and WSNS-TV, Chicago\n\nWNBC and WNJU, New York City\n\nWRC-TV, Washington, D.C.\n\nWTVJ and WSCV, Miami - Fort Lauderdale\n\nWVIT, New Haven - Hartford\n\nKBLR, Las Vegas\n\nKHRR, Tucson, Arizona\n\nKDEN, Denver\n\nKNSO, Fresno, California\n\nKTAZ, Phoenix\n\nKTMD, Galveston - Houston\n\nKVDA, San Antonio\n\nWKAQ-TV, San Juan\n\nWNEU, Merrimack, N.H. - Boston\n\nNBCUniversal Television Distribution\n\nMain article: NBCUniversal Television Distribution\n\nNBCUniversal Television Distribution (formerly NBC Enterprises and Universal Domestic Television among other distributor incarnations) is the television distribution arm of NBC Universal that distributes programs across the nation.\n\nNBCUniversal International Television\n\nNBCUniversal International Television or NBCUniversal International Television Distribution (formerly Universal Worldwide Television and MCA TV International) is the worldwide television production/distribution arm of NBCUniversal, syndicating NBCUni's programs across the globe.
