        "text": "NEW YORK — iVillage, the online destination for women acquired by NBC Universal in 2006, is kicking off a redesign and relaunch of its site to take a more modern approach, including the integration of more community functions.\n\nThe redesign, spearheaded by Jodi Kahn, executive vp of iVillage Networks, will roll out in phases, starting with the entertainment section Wednesday.\n\nThe site plans re-launches of other key categories of particular interest to women in the coming months — food, health, parenting & pregnancy, home, beauty & style and astrology. As far as the entertainment section’s relaunch goes, iVillage wants to be more topical and current. It said the section will be the only celebrity entertainment news site designed especially for women and it will also tap into NBC Uni’s content and talent.\n\n“The new site is where the iVillage woman can tell her true story, leaving in all the genuine details,” said Kahn. “It’s where she shares her life moments, from the day-to-day happenings to the major milestones.”\n\nLauren Zalaznick, president of NBC Universal Women & Lifestyle Entertainment Networks, predicted: “In an age when female consumers are substantially driving the economy and women are managing their lives online, the relaunched site will further cement our position as a leader in this important marketplace.”\n\nIVillage content is fed by a newly hired and expanded editorial team led by Angela Matusik, who recently joined from People.com."
