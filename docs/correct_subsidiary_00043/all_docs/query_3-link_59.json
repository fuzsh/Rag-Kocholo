        "text": "A historian once described the merger of two ailing railroads as \"two drunks helping one another home.\" Nowadays it's a pretty apt description of what is going on in Internet land. Trying to combine content and commerce can be an effective recipe for failure. Ivillage, a Web site for women, tried to change its business model in part by acquiring e-retailer Ibaby for a total $12.3 million in cash and stock. The problem: not enough eyeballs to make the commerce side profitable; Ivillage also discovered the headaches that come with taking and delivering orders. \"It was a diversion that was not going to get us to scale,\" admits Jay C. Hoag, an Ivillage board member and a partner at Technology Crossover Ventures. In July Ivillage sold Ibaby for a minimal profit--some equity and ad banners.\n\nHitching to the Internet has been perilous for some companies looking to diversify. Whittman-Hart, which earned $30 million on $481 million in revenue last year, had a solid business as a technology consultant to manufacturing, retail, health care (and some Internet) companies with $50 million to $500 million in sales. But the Web was hot. Whittman-Hart envied USWeb/CKS, which had a thriving business setting up e-commerce sites. Whittman-Hart grabbed it for $6.5 billion in stock, and renamed the combined entity Marchfirst.\n\nThen came the correction. Marchfirst insists that selling to new ventures accounts for only 8% of its revenues. Still, its stock has sunk from $48, when the deal closed on Mar. 1, to $11.\n\nWhat happens when you acquire a company for its technology--and then discover you don't really want the rest of the company? Hollywood Entertainment, which rents tapes, was interested in Reel.com for its software that sold videos to folks based on a history of their tastes and purchases. The $90 million deal in cash and stock two years ago got two thumbs up. But competition from Amazon.com and Buy.com proved overwhelming: Reel lost money on every sale, and burned $4 million in cash per month. Hollywood filed for a public offering of Reel shares--valued between $600 and $800 million--but retracted when the market soured. Hollywood ended up shuttering Reel in June, firing all 120 people.\n\nLast month Webvan bought Homegrocer for $550 million in stock. The combination hasn't solved Webvan's basic cost problem: how to increase the number of deliveries per hour. There are no economies when your drivers operate in disparate regions (Webvan in Chicago and Atlanta; Homegrocer on the West Coast). Webvan has $525 million in cash but is torching $125 million of it per quarter, estimates Jeetil Patel, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown. Upgrading Homegrocer's computer systems will only add more oxygen to the fire. Not good news in a very stingy capital market.\n\nNow, deals that don't stop the flow of red ink are doomed. In January golf equipment retailer Chipshot.com bought GolfServ, a site that licenses its handicap-tracking, tee-time booking and instruction services to more than 250 sites, for about $20 million in cash and stock. Great service, but GolfServ was more than a year away from profitability. The union proved to be something of a three-putt. Strapped for cash following the crash, Chipshot sold GolfServ back to its founders for $500,000 in cash in August.\n\n\"We've had seven offers since the divorce to take over other companies,\" says GolfServ President Kathryn Savarese. \"We've declined them all.\" At least somebody learned something."
