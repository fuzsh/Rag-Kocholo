        "text": "For the past few months, NBC Insider has given Olympic fans worldwide spectacular previews of what to expect when Team USA arrives in Paris to compete on a world stage. American athletes across 32 sports will look to bring home the gold when the 2024 Summer Olympics kick off in late July. If previous Olympics are any indication, fans should expect the United States gold medal collection to get even more impressive when the dust settles.\n\nWe love peeling back the curtain as much as anyone else, so today, we're examining the 2024 Paris Olympic Village (also known as the Athletes' Village), the newly built complex that will house thousands of men and women from around the world. Here's everything you need to know about the Olympic Village and how the 2024 version will impact the athletes themselves.\n\nRELATED: Everything to Know About the 2024 Olympics Opening Ceremony in Paris\n\nWhat does the Olympic Village look like?\n\nFor the past year, Olympic officials have worked around the clock to build the 2024 Olympic Village, which looks more like a sprawling upscale apartment complex that wouldn't look out of place in any major U.S. city. The Village is thoughtfully designed to allow the athletes to train, socialize, relax, and live in a safe complex that will anticipate their needs.\n\nMuch of the Village's recreation areas and green spaces are located on the banks of the Seine River, allowing even the most competitive Olympian ample opportunity to bask in the serenity of one of Paris' most famous bodies of water.\n\nIndividual rooms resemble no-nonsense flats and apartments of countless European cities — nothing too fancy. Notably, you won't find the latest TVs or video game consoles in the athletes' apartments, which fit two beds per room.\n\nThe Infamous Cardboard Beds\n\nSpeaking of beds — the much-discussed cardboard beds return to the Olympic Village after making their debut at the 2020 Tokyo Games. The furniture, designed by the brand Airweave, was chosen by the organizers for its sustainability, which is of chief concern for the French Games.\n\nOver 16,000 beds arrived in Paris and were placed in the athletes' rooms May 11, per Insider the Games, leading many, including TODAY's Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager to discuss how exactly the beds should be used by athletes.\n\nFor context, the beds dubbed \"anti-sex beds\" by many athletes, who were advised by the IOC to avoid intimate personal relations, for lack of a better word, amid the coronavirus pandemic. This is not the case for this year's Games, with the Olympic Village Director Laurent Michaud confirming in an interview with Sky News that the so-called \"intimacy ban\" has been lifted.\n\n\"It is very important that the conviviality here is something big,\" Michaud said.\n\nRELATED: Who's on Team USA? Here's a List of the Athletes Qualified for the 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nAthletes won't have to worry about being away from the action. According to Olympic officials, \"Aside from those training at their competition venues, 100% of the athletes will train within 20 minutes from the Village, and 60% of those will train within the Village itself. 85% of athletes will be accommodated less than 30 minutes away from their competition venue.\"\n\nShuttle buses and electric bikes are also available to travel around the Village.\n\nIt sounds like the Olympic Village will be the epicenter of all the nonstop action that the Summer Games are known for — a fact that we're sure the athletes themselves are happy about!\n\nRELATED: How Much Do Olympians Get Paid to Compete?
