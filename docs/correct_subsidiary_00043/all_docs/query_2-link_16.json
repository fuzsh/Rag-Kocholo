        "text": "If delivering 100 billion hours of content to 700 million people every year wasnât enough, NBCUniversal is simultaneously building the ultimate digital fan experience for the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\nFor fans, data-driven personalisation will enable them to follow their favourite events and athletes and consume content in their channels of choice.\n\nFor advertisers, LA28 provides an unmatched opportunity to reach new audiences. The Games are the latest enhancement to NBCUniveralâs product portfolio, which revolutionised the industry with a single, scaled advertising offering. Relying on digital tools for data visibility and productivity, a 1,500-person ad sales division works across departments to customise ad solutions and gain valuable insights into audience behaviour. The division generates $12 billion in annual revenue.\n\nThe change-maker behind the scenes of NBCUniversalâs revenue engine is Linda Yaccarino, Chairman of Global Advertising and Partnerships. One of the most powerful women in TV, according to Adweek, Linda was the first chief in network history to combine broadcast, cable, and digital assets into one unified organisation, dubbed the \"One Portfolio\" strategy. Linda is known for breaking down barriers for the next generation of female leaders, inspired by her strong-willed Italian American mother.\n\nHere are five ways Linda and the team at NBCUniversal use Salesforce Customer 360 to create a single view of their advertising customers, transform how sales and marketing work together, and lay the groundwork for an unrivalled experience for Team USA fans.\n\nToday, the Global Advertising and Partnerships division easily connects advertisers of all types with their target viewers. This requires sales teams to create customised ad packages across a large product portfolio â from NBC Sportsâ channels and NBC Newsâ channels to affiliate cable channels and the organizationâs Peacock streaming service.\n\nTo deliver this single, scaled advertising offering, NBCUniversal had to first unify disparate internal teams and improve visibility over clientsâ data. Leaders implemented a sales CRM solution to provide a 360-degree view of advertisersâ activity across the organisation. As a result, sales teams can now manage advertising spend and performance more effectively.\n\nNext, NBCUniversal app developers customised this integrated platform with low-code tools to improve productivity. This includes unifying sales and revenue management systems to efficiently capture sales estimates and actual revenue in local currencies, enhancing collaboration between sales and finance divisions.\n\nSalespeople will also soon be able to consolidate important account data â including account plans, close plans, opportunity strategy, and meeting notes â into a shared collaboration tool embedded in the CRM.\n\nâThis single source of trusted value and truth is the cornerstone of everything we do,\" said Yaccarino.\n\nNBCUniversal adopted Salesforceâs B2B marketing automation platform so that marketing and sales teams could work closely together to drive growth.\n\nThe unified platform lets the companyâs marketing team quickly create automated, personalised email campaigns for potential leads, based on interactions like page visits or email opens.\n\nIntelligent notifications let sales reps know to follow up once a lead hits a certain threshold of engagement. Sales reps can then personalise the next interaction using insights from an accountâs buying activity.\n\nPersonalised messages have improved open rates by 100%, which helps the company build a stronger sales pipeline and close more deals.\n\nâWith Salesforce, weâre building a unified information source to help us reimagine collaboration across our entire platform,\" said Yaccarino. \"This will enable NBCUniversal to continue delivering the highest level of transparency, insights, and results for our customers.â\n\nNBCUniversalâs partners also rely on data to make decisions. To serve them, NBCUniversal has adopted an AI-powered marketing intelligence platform that will allow both internal teams and the companyâs agency partners to easily track ad delivery and campaign performance, helping them to optimise campaigns across divisions and channels.\n\nThe company also plans to use a data analytics and visualisation tool to analyse data across different business systems and make insights more accessible to employees.\n\nHaving a greater understanding of how ads perform unites team members around common goals to optimise impressions for television and digital audiences through targeted or broad-reach advertising campaigns.\n\nTraditional sponsorships create brand recognition by slapping a company logo on a product or television screen. By deepening relationships with its advertising customers and viewership, NBCUniversal now has the ability to connect advertisers and fans through more authentic and personalised experiences.\n\nData gathered across multiple touchpoints can be used to customise digital experiences for Team USA fans so they can more easily follow their favourite events and athletes and consume content in their channels of choice.\n\nPersonalised content delivered across multiple platforms will help connect fans â including existing fans of the Olympics and a new, younger demographic â with the athletes who will be competing on behalf of the U.S.\n\nThis will help to create deeper engagement with fans in the lead-up to and during the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic games and allow advertisers to control their narratives."
