He will be based in Snap’s New York office, reporting to chief business officer Jeremi Gorman, who joined in 2018 after serving as Amazon’s head of ad sales.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nSnapchat Users Report Widespread Problems Sending Snaps, Stemming From Google Cloud Outage\n\nListen: Joshua Jackson on Tackling Race and Class in 'Little Fires Everywhere'\n\nNew WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar on His Vision for the Future of Media\n\nNaylor most recently served as SVP and head of advertising sales at Hulu. During his tenure, he expanded Hulu’s offerings for brands by introducing interactive ad units and alternate ad solutions, including industry firsts like “pause” and “binge” advertising units.\n\nWith Naylor’s exit, the Hulu ad-sales team will report into Rita Ferro, president of advertising sales for the Walt Disney Co. The Hulu and Disney ad sales groups will work closely entering into upfront negotiations, according to a company rep. Disney previously said it was “reinventing” both the May upfront showcase it holds for ABC, ESPN, Freeform, FX and Nat Geo, as well as an event it presents a few weeks earlier for Hulu.\n\nPrior to joining Hulu in 2014, Naylor served as EVP of digital media sales for NBCUniversal where he ran digital advertising sales for NBCU’s entertainment, news and sports digital properties. That came after the company acquired iVillage in 2006. He also earlier held sales management positions at Lycos and Wired Digital.\n\nAt Snap, now reporting to Naylor will be Luke Kallis, VP of U.S. advertiser solutions, Dominic Rioux, VP emerging advertising solutions, and Matt McGowan, GM for Canada. Continuing to report to Gorman are David Roter, who leads agency efforts as VP global agency partnerships, and Claire Valoti, VP International.\n\nIn 2019, Snap added 31 million Snapchat daily active users, to stand at 218 million as of the fourth quarter. The company posted Q4 2019 revenue of $561 million, up 44% year-over-year. Snap also said sales of Snapchat’s Commercials in video more than tripled year-over-year in the most recent quarter, while sales of Story Ads doubled.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, according to Snap, user engagement with ads has risen. In late March (vs. a month earlier), Snapchat says there was a 36% increase in install volume for app ads and a 19% increase in swipe-up rate overall.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney Plus in April 2020\n\nEverything Coming to Netflix in April\n\nHow Coronavirus Is Affecting Entertainment: All the Major Delays and Cancellations"
