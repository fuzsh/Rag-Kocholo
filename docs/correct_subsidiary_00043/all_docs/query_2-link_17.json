This role included work on two specific plans, LEED ND certification, and the project’s Environmental Impact Report. At 397-acres, Universal Studios is the largest working television and motion picture production studio in the world and is one of Southern California’s leading family tourist destinations. The projects are focused on the incremental growth and improvement of the complex driven by new attractions, growth and usage, and transit and mobility changes over time. As part of a long-term working relationship, RIOS continues to play an active role in the master plan. Projects have included new roadways, two pedestrian bridges, a tunnel, landscape and plaza improvements, and a child care facility."
