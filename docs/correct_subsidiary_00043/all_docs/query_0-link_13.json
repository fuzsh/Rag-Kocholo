        "text": "NBCUniversal Media, LLC is an American multinational media conglomerate owned by Comcast and headquartered at Rockefeller Plaza's Comcast Building in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It is one of two successor companies to MCA Inc., the other being Vivendi through its subsidiary Universal Music Group.\n\nNBCUniversal is primarily involved in the media and entertainment industry; among its most significant divisions are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), one of the United States' \"Big Three\" television networks, and the film studio Universal Pictures. It also has a significant presence in broadcasting through a portfolio of domestic and international properties, including terrestrial and pay television outlets. Via its Universal Parks & Resorts division, NBCUniversal is also the third-largest operator of amusement parks in the world.\n\nNBCUniversal was formed in 2004 with the merger of General Electric's NBC with Vivendi Universal's film and television subsidiary Vivendi Universal Entertainment, after GE had acquired 80% of the subsidiary, giving Vivendi a 20% share of the new company. In 2011, Comcast attained 51% and thereby the control of newly reformed NBCUniversal, by purchasing shares from GE, while GE bought out Vivendi. Since 2013, the company is wholly owned by Comcast, which bought GE's ownership stake.\n\nSubsidiaries[edit]\n\nMain article: List of assets owned by NBCUniversal\n\n[edit]\n\nOfficial website\n\nUniversal Networks International\n\nNBCUniversal's theme parks\n\nNBCUniversal's online store\n\niVillage.com\n\nNBC City Studios: Burbank, California\n\nNBCUniversal Broadcast Journalism Program"
