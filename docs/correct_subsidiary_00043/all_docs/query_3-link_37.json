        "text": "NBC News Digital houses NBCNews.com, MSNBC.com, Today.com, TheGrio.com, NBCLatino.com and NBCPolitics.com among other properties. It has been building out new partnerships with other NBCUniversal divisions like CNBC and parent company Comcast’s Xfinity after NBCUniversal acquired full ownership of its digital networks from MSN back in July, ending a 16-year tie-up. Now iVillage, an online community for women, will be joining its portfolio to sync better with like-minded sites like Today.com, create more high-value sales opportunities for clients, collaborate with the network’s on-air programs, and tap into the resources and technology of NBC News. With the iVillage network, NBC News Digital is estimated to reach an average of more than 62 million unique users a month. iVillage will be overseen by Vivian Schiller, SVP & Chief Digital Officer at NBC News, who leads NBC News Digital.\n\nIVillage was housed at the Digital Networks group run by Lauren Zalaznick. She continues to oversee NBCU’s digital properties Fandango and Daily Candy, and the move will not impact her title of Chairman, Entertainment & Digital Networks and Integrated Media, NBCUniversal."
