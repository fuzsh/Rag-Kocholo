        "text": "Less continues to be moreThe declines are less dramatic as comped against 2005 months already impacted by Clear Channel's Less is More initiative, but inventory levels are still falling. Harris Nesbitt analyst Lee Westerfield reports that radio commercial air time in the top 10 markets was down 8.8% year over year in February. Perhaps not all of that was by design. \"We see slack advertiser demand against NBC Olympics broadcasts and close-of-the-month price discounting as the explanation behind the surprisingly large commercial reduction, rather than resulting from supply-side commercial inventory reduction efforts like Less is More,\" said Westerfield, who estimates that radio advertising revenues were down 3-4% for the month. Already well past the first anniversary of LIM, Clear Channel reduced inventories more than the analyst expected from the already-reduced levels of February 2005. CC Radio's spot loads in the top 10 markets were down 8.6% for the month, but Westerfield expects to see them level off in the coming months. The only radio companies operating in multiple top 10 markets with bigger inventory declines in February were Emmis, down 11%, Radio One, whose spot loads were down 10.4%, and Susquehanna/Cumulus, which reduced 8.8%.\n\nQuiet steps toward dereg not going unnoticed\n\nRep. Fred Upton (R-MI) did not exactly make national headlines when he went public with his belief the local radio station ownership caps are too low in many of the larger markets. He said it should go from eight to 10 in many markets, and as high as 12 in the largest markets. However, it didn't go unnoticed in San Antonio, where the San Antonio Business Journal (SABJ) has a front row seat for the actions of Clear Channel Communications. And SABJ has made it clear that another group has taken note: the watchdogs who helped derail, at least temporarily, the dereg efforts of the FCC back in 2003.\n\nRBR observation: It remains to be seen what tack FCC Chairman Kevin Martin will take when he engages the Commission in the court-ordered redo of the 6/2/03 media ownership rulemaking, now that he is just days and/or weeks away from his first Republican majority. However, we can expect that every action will have an opposite reaction, but not necessarily an equal one. Not if changes are attempted quietly, that is. The watchdogs, who will no doubt be spurred on by Democratic Commissioners Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein, with a Capitol Hill chorus most likely featuring Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Rep. Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) in lead roles, will be howling just as loudly as they can in an attempt to recreate the circus atmosphere that accompanied Michael Powell's attempt at a rule rewrite. Stay tuned.\n\nCBS Radio's Integrated marketing group relaunches\n\nCBS Radio announced it has renamed its integrated marketing department the CBS Radio Altitude Group. Formerly known as Infinity Solutions and Beyond (ISB), the change reflects the division's expanded focus on creating multi-platform campaigns utilizing CBS Radio's broadcast and digital assets. The change is effective immediately. \"As the exclusive gateway designed to take advantage of the entire range of CBS Radio assets, we are able to connect our clients' brands to listeners with local relevance and dynamic engagement,\" said Rich Lobel, Executive Vice President of the Altitude Group. \"The group's positioning is about elevating ideas by taking them to new heights across multiple cross-channel touchpoints.\" In a related announcement, Stefan Willimann has joined the division as Vice President of Strategic Sales and Marketing. He will report to Lobel. Willimann joins CBS Radio from WorldNow, an Internet revenue solutions provider, where he was Vice President/Regional Director since 2004.\n\nWSJ sees issue with AM HD interference\n\nWell, we've certainly brought up the problem (6/9/04 RBR #112). Now The Wall Street Journal sees it as an issue, too (excerpts from a 3/2 story):\n\n\"Digital Signals Spark Static From AM Radio; Bill Harms of Elkridge, Md., likes to listen to Frank Sinatra crooning on Vegas Radio, which broadcasts at WTRI-AM 1520, a Washington-based station. But over the past year, he's had trouble tuning in to Vegas as he drives through certain neighborhoods. As he complained to WTRI owner Buddy Rizer in an email, ''there's a hiss, a hiss that did not exist in the past.'' A growing number of radio listeners are encountering similar interference -- hisses, whistles or static -- on their favorite AM stations. The problem for WTRI began about a year ago, when Bonneville International Corp.'s WTOP, the AM station at 1500, began using a digital signal that interfered with WTRI's analog signal in some broadcast areas. It's one of the unexpected consequences of the radio industry's transition to digital broadcasts.\n\n| Read More... |\n\nAgencies on AAAAs conferenceWhat did you take with you from the AAAAs conference last week?\n\nSaid Steve Grubbs, PHD CEO: Overall, for me, it was a very worthwhile trip. I got to hear some thoughts from some of my counterparts and some pretty insightful presentations from Yahoo and Mr. Gore. Most importantly for me was just connecting with people down there that I don't have the opportunity to see but once or twice a year. It's also good to see some of the people in the booths down there, some of which we have ongoing relationships and work with.\n\nJean Pool, EVP/Director of North American Operations Universal McCann, Chairman of Media Policy at the AAAAs, has been to 12 of the last 13 AAAAs conferences. She tells us this was one of the best. We asked if there was any reaction from her keynote speech, where she announced her initiative to get commercial audience data and bashed the problem of clutter (3/3/06 RBR #44).\n\nRBR observation: Want to know why the networks hardly show up at the AAAAs? This may be one of the reasons. The last thing they need is to be stuck on a panel session with a point blank question such as 'why keep commercial ratings secret?'\n\n| Read More |\n\nVerklin: \"We're not encumbered\n\nby creative fighting for turf\"\n\nMore from one of the most important panel sessions at the AAAAs last week: \"The Shape of the Modern Media Organization.\" One of the issues was the debate about re-bundling and creative control/ownership of media. Lately, some creative agencies have complained that the unbundling of media services over the past several years has led them to lose strategic ground. While media has been consolidated, creative has been unbundled. Is that a good thing? Said David Verklin, Carat Americas CEO: \"We have some advantages that my friends and colleagues up here don't have. We're not encumbered by creative agencies fighting for turf. I'm the commissioner of our baseball league. All of our teams have the ability to cooperate and work together a little bit easier than some other gentlemen up here who have to work with sister companies that don't want to collaborate. Should creative become re-bundled with media, actually under the media tent, considering how well media agencies have done after the initial unbundling?\n\nCharlie Rutman, MPG CEO: I'm a proponent of collaboration. Media and creative have had to collaborate, and still collaborate, since the beginning of time...what I'm hearing is more about control and proximity, as opposed to collaboration. So I'm a little confused as to why collaboration is being superseded by control and proximity. I don't see any client benefit in separating strategy and implementation. Interestingly, I have not heard any complaints from the creative people. The notion that the creative community is still thinking :30 television commercials is crazy. These guys are thinking digital, wireless and everything else.\"\n\nJack Klues, Publicis Media Chairman and CEO: \"None of us in our professional lives have ever said that the media and the message didn't have to be connected. I think all of us in our own ways have multiple models and our organizations are flexible enough to fit specific client needs with specific needs of an agency partner...but the notion that the answer to stronger connectivity between message and medium is the full-service agency model of 1980 doesn't make sense to me. The business has changed far too much. You're not going to find the businesses we're in somehow a department of some larger creative agency. This is a media business.\" More from the session tomorrow.\n\nNBC Uni snares\n\niVillage in 600M dealAs competition by mega media companies heats up to acquire prime real estate on the World Wide Web, NBC Universal is shelling out 600 million to buy iVillage. NBC Uni TV chief Jeff Zucker says the deal will allow the company to marry its on-air branded content with interactive functionality on the Internet site visited by millions of women. The company says every part of NBC Universal will be used to support and drive iVillage forward, from TV to film to home entertainment. With the addition of iVillage, NBC Uni says it expects to see its \"digital revenues\" rise to about 200 million this year and grow 20% annually going forward. \"Acquiring iVillage will enable us to bring our programming to a large and passionate online community. We look forward to building on the considerable brand strength iVillage has developed over the past 10 years and to giving our advertising clients new and exciting ways to reach a valuable demographic,\" said NBC Universal CEO Bob Wright in announcing the acquisition.\n\nHow will the synergy work? \"From the 'Today Show' to 'Project Runway' to 'The Biggest Loser' to all the health & medical and lifestyles segments we do every day on every one of our owned and operated television stations, we will now be able to create a deeper, richer experience around our content for consumers across all emerging platforms,\" said Zucker, CEO of the NBC Universal Television Group. Shareholders of iVillage, which is publicly traded on Nasdaq as \"IVIL,\" will receive 8.50 per share at closing, which is expected in Q2. That's a 6.5% premium to the closing price before the deal was announced. Upon completion of the transaction, the iVillage team will report directly to Beth Comstock, President NBC Universal Digital Media and Market Development, and continue to be based in New York.\n\nRBR observation: Lots of dot-coms fell by the wayside, but those that found their market niche and survived are very valuable today - - and very appealing to multi-platform media companies looking for more platforms. Thus, News Corporation bought Intermix Media (MySpace.com) for 580 million and Viacom bought Neopets for 160 million and iFilm for 49 million. Now NBC Uni is focusing on female consumers with this iVillage deal. No doubt the owners of some other successful Internet companies will also be thinking that the time is ripe to cash out."
