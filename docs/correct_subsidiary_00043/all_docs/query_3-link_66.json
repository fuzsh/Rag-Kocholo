        "text": "Victor F. Ganzi is a seasoned corporate executive whose career has spanned running one of the world's largest diversified media companies, as well as the day-to-day operations of what has become one of the world's largest law firms. The New York City native, educated as both a lawyer and a CPA specializing in taxation, has chaired and served on more than 25 public, private and non-profit boards during that time.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2008, Ganzi served as president and CEO of Hearst Corporation, where he grew the company into a more than $8 billion revenue entity, and was a key driver of acquisitions resulting in the addition or creation of more than 100 separate businesses. During Ganzi’s 18 years at Hearst, it had a portfolio of brands including\n\nA&E, The History Channel, Lifetime and ESPN, as well as various internet, magazine, newspaper, television broadcasting and global businesses with well-known brands such as Cosmopolitan, Esquire and Harper's Bazaar, among many others. Ganzi began his career at Hearst in 1990 as general counsel, before being appointed chief financial and legal officer in 1992. He took on the responsibilities of operating the Hearst Books/Business Publishing Group in 1995. He was elected executive vice president in 1997 and named chief operating officer in 1998.\n\nDuring Ganzi’s tenure at Hearst, he focused on expanding the company’s international operations, its business-to-business information and database activities, with particular emphasis on its global medical databases, and its internet activities. As part of his effort to diversify the company’s revenue base away from advertising, he focused his attention on growing its investments in various cable programming services, especially ESPN, and opened a brand new area of activity in financial information services by acquiring a 20% interest in Fitch Ratings.\n\nWith respect to internet activities, during Ganzi’s tenure, Hearst added websites, classified and display advertising and other related information sources to its newspapers, magazines and television stations. In addition, an investment approach to the internet was pursued whereby Hearst acquired minority interests in more than 50 internet start-up companies, including technology and content companies. These investments included iVillage, Women.com, Exodus Communications, Star Media, Netscape, E Ink, Broadcast.com, Sling Media, Local.com, Idilia, XM Satellite Radio, Pandora and Brightcove.\n\nShortly after September 11, 2001, Ganzi spearheaded the construction of a new Hearst corporate headquarters building in New York City. The project, which commenced in 2003 and was completed in 2006, resulted in an 870,000 square foot state-of-the-art building designed by world-famous architect, Lord Norman Foster. Many consider the building to be the most significant architectural structure built in New York in the last 50 years. Additionally, at completion, it was the most environmentally-friendly office building ever constructed in New York City, achieving Gold LEED certification.\n\nPrior to joining Hearst, Ganzi was the managing partner at Rogers & Wells (now part of Clifford Chance), one of the world’s largest international law firms, where he was responsible for day-to-day operations. Ganzi joined Rogers & Wells in 1973 and conducted a general corporate tax law practice with an emphasis on real estate, tax-exempt entities, including professional sports organizations, and corporate mergers and acquisitions, including extensive work in the communications, media, casino and financial services industries. Prior to Rogers & Wells, Ganzi practiced as a certified public accountant in taxation at a Big Four accounting firm in Denver.\n\nGanzi, a native of New York, graduated summa cum laude from Fordham University in 1968. He received a J.D. degree from Harvard Law School in 1971 and an L.L.M. in taxation from New York University in 1981.\n\nGanzi is a member of the board of directors of the PGA TOUR, Inc., the entity which operates the men’s professional golf tour in the United States. He served as its non-executive chairman and president from 2007 – 2016. He currently serves as non-executive chairman of the board of one public company, Willis Towers Watson. Ganzi also serves as a director of Advance Publications, Inc. and is a trustee of the Advance Long-Term Management Trust, both of which entities are involved in the management and control of the operating businesses and investments of the Newhouse family. In addition, Mr. Ganzi recently joined the board of directors of Aveanna Healthcare (formerly PSA Healthcare Intermediate Holding Inc.), a national company whose primary business is to provide pediatric home healthcare services to medically fragile children as well as to adults who are also medically fragile.\n\nHe currently serves as non-executive chairman of the board of Foster & Partners, one of the world’s largest architectural firms known for innovation, creativity and sustainability, designing some of the world’s most environmentally-friendly buildings ever constructed. Foster & Partners is headquartered in London and is currently designing projects in more than 50 cities around the globe.\n\nGanzi serves as a trustee on the boards of the Whitney Museum of American Art, Madison Square Boys & Girls Club, Partnership to End Addiction and The First Tee, all of which are publicly-supported charitable organizations.\n\nIn addition to his present membership on various boards, Ganzi formerly was a director of ESPN, Inc. for 18 years, a board member for the Associated Press, and a trustee of Fordham University. In addition, he served as non-executive chairman of the board of Hearst-Argyle Television, Inc., a publicly-traded company, was a board member of Wyeth, a large pharmaceutical and biotechnology company until it merged with Pfizer Inc. in October 2009, and served 10 years as a trustee on the board of the American Museum of Natural History. He was also a board member of another public company, Gentiva Health Services, Inc., until its sale in February of 2015. From 1982 until 2019, Ganzi served on the board of Palm Management Corporation, the entity that operates the various Palm Restaurants throughout the United States and was 50%-owned by his family for the past 93 years. During the period 2006 to 2008, Ganzi served as co-chair of the Partnership for New York City which is a network of business leaders dedicated to enhancing the economy of the five boroughs of New York City and maintaining the city's position as the global center of commerce, culture and innovation. From 1993 to 2014, Ganzi was a member of the board of directors of the New York City Economic Development Corporation and served as its non-executive chairman of the board from 2009 to 2014.\n\nGanzi resides with his wife, Patricia, in Bay Shore, New York. They have adult twin daughters and five grandchildren. Ganzi was born on February 14, 1947 in New York City."
