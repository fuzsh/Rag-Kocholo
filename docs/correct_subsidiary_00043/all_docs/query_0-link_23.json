        "text": "Peter Naylor, one-time head of digital ad sales at NBCUniversal, will take over the top ad sales role at Hulu, effective next week, the streaming-video company said Monday.\n\nNaylor is a veteran of the business, having worked his way through NBCU after the company acquired iVillage in 2006. He was most recently exec veep, ad sales, for NBC News Digital. Earlier in his tenure, he was exec veep of NBCU’s digital sales operation. He took his most recent position in the fall of 2012, as part of a restructuring made by Linda Yaccarino, NBCU’s president of ad sales, two months after she was named to that position. While Naylor had a direct line to the company’s top ad-sales exec, the move was viewed as one that left him with a narrower portfolio.\n\nNaylor is well-known in ad circles. He served the board of the Interactive Advertising Bureau for over 10 years and was chairman of the board in 2012. He similarly served on the board of directors of the Online Publishers’ Association, where he was treasurer from 2010 to 2013. He was a founding board member of 212, a New York interactive media trade association.\n\nIn a blog post announcing Naylor’s hire, Hulu Chief Executive Mike Hopkins said, “As we are coming off Hulu’s record breaking year, I see 2014 being even stronger—you are already above target for the quarter, and we’re not even halfway through it. Keep up the good work. Under Peter’s leadership, I’m confident that our advertising team will continue to excel. ”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nNaylor has early experience with Hulu, helping the streaming site identify some of its charter sponsors.\n\nHulu said Jim O’Donnell, interim head of sales, will continue to work as VP, West Coast Sales & Advertising Sales Operations, reporting to Naylor.\n\nJP Colaco, one of Hulu’s first employees, and its original head of ad sales, left the company in November.\n\nNaylor announced his hire on Twitter:"
