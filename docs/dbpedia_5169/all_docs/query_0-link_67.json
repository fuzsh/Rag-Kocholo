Après un exposé des éléments biographiques montrant comment Stumpf est parvenu à acquérir cette double compétence, nous examinons la grande variété des champs disciplinaires sur lesquels portèrent l’ensemble de ses recherches. Cela permettra de mieux saisir le sens de l’affirmation de Stumpf selon laquelle la philosophie devrait toujours être une entreprise menée en étroite collaboration avec la pratique scientifique et de montrer ainsi la place tout à fait singulière qu’il occupe au sein de l’histoire de la pensée allemande au tournant du vingtième siècle.",

        "text": "1 Introduction\n\n2This heterogeneous body of writing led to different interpretations of his personality. Early scholars argued that he brought a phenomenological attitude to experimental psychology, stemming from Brentano’s philosophy and fostering the development of the Gestalt theory [Spiegelberg 1960, 54]. Historians of psychology sometimes claim that Stumpf progressively abandoned philosophy in favor of experimental psychology [Sprung 2006, 15], while others (more properly) recognize his uninterrupted philosophical commitment [Ash 1995, 30]. In contrast to the tendency to consider him an orthodox follower of Brentano in philosophy [Schuhmann 1996, 128], [Schuhmann 2001, 71], recent interpretations argue for the originality of his thought [Fisette 2006].\n\n4In this essay I consider the relationship between philosophy and experimental sciences from the point of view of Stumpf’s epistemology. I first introduce Stumpf’s own comments concerning his double commitment as an experimentalist and a philosopher (§ 2). I then proceed to illustrate his classification of sciences (§ 3) and his definition of phenomenology and philosophy (§ 4). Finally, I discuss his views concerning the mutual relationship between philosophy and natural science (§ 5).\n\n2 A philosopher in the lab\n\n5In his Autobiography, written in 1924, Stumpf retrospectively considers his experimental work. It is worth quoting the passage at length:\n\nI was well aware, of course, that such absorption in all the details of a field of sensation stood in sharp contrast to the general conception of the mission of the philosopher, although Fechner had been a famous example of this type. When I considered the hopeless condition, as it appeared, perhaps, in Überweg’s review of recent philosophy—ever new systems without any connection with one another, each bent on originality, at least on a new terminology, none of them with any power of conviction—when I compared this with the evolution of physics, what a vast difference! Might it not be possible for a specialist in philosophy to work together with other specialists, at least in some particular field? If this were done by others in other fields, might there not result finally a beneficial relationship between philosophy and the single sciences?\n\nThus the time in Würzburg marks for me the beginning of a new line of work to which I have remained faithful to the present day, which, however, has made me an outsider to the great majority of my colleagues. My work of observation and experimentation has absorbed my time and strength even more than is the case with most experimental psychologists. Although I fully appreciate the saying of Aristotle that theory is the sweetest of all, I must confess that it was always a joy and a comfort to pass from theory to observation, from meditation to facts, from my writing-desk to the laboratory; and, thus, in the end, my writing-desk was neglected and has not produced a single textbook or compendium, which indeed ought to have been its first duty, even at the time when I was an instructor. However, I never intended to spend so much of my lifetime on acoustics and musical psychological studies as I did later on. I had counted on a few years. But it was, after all, not musical science but philosophy that always remained mistress of the house, who, it is true, granted most generously great privileges to her helpmate. [Stumpf 1924, 396-397]\n\n6This passage contains at least four important statements: Stumpf affirmed that the philosopher should also be a scientist, a specialist in some field (1); he confessed his particular bent to experimental activities as compared to armchair reflection (2); however, he admitted he sometimes exaggerated: experimental work had taken him longer than he had planned (3); finally, he declared that he had never really abandoned philosophy, which remained the “mistress of the house” throughout his whole career (4). I shall now comment on these issues, with respect to their importance for our present concerns.\n\n8(2) Despite his personal inclination for experimental practice, Stumpf was not merely a technical experimentalist, blind to theory. As the Director of the Institute in Berlin, he let his assistants teach the experimental approach, while he was in charge\n\n[...] of the theoretical meetings, in which psychological problems a propos of various recent treatises were discussed, and emphasized, in the spirit of Brentano; not only the need for psychological observation but also the necessity of logical thinking. I laid particular stress on these meetings because I regard the experimental method—at least of the external sort—as by no means the cure-all for psychology. [Stumpf 1924, 404]\n\nI have never endeavored to found a school in the strict sense; and have perceived it almost to be more pleasant and certainly more interesting, to have my students reach different conclusions rather than merely to have them corroborate my theorems. I derive all the more joy and gratitude from the loyalty of the young people who, in the same scientific spirit, but by their own independent plans, continue the work of research. [Stumpf 1924, 441]\n\n10Perhaps for this reason, the Berlin group respected him, as evidenced by the celebratory writing on Stumpf’s 75th birthday, a special issue of the Gestaltists’ official review, Psychologische Forschung [Wertheimer 1923].\n\n11(3) Stumpf undoubtedly invested much more time in experimental activities than he had intended. He originally meant to write four volumes of his Tonpsychologie. Only two volumes were ever published [Stumpf 1883, 1890], and the residual topics were dealt with in some other, less monumental, publications [Stumpf 1898, 1911a]. Stumpf probably understood that the whole project, in its complete form, would have required too much time. He was sometimes overwhelmed by the many duties of his intense academic life, especially in Berlin. No surprise then that he completed his major philosophical work, Erkenntnislehre [Stumpf 1939-1940], after his retirement, thus compensating for the (relative) lack of philosophical production. Commenting on his studies on vowel sounds in his Autobiography, he writes:\n\n[t]he experimental results fascinated me to such an extent that I could not give up the investigation until this important field of phenomenology had been satisfactorily cleared up. [Stumpf 1924, 414]\n\n12Once again, the attraction that experimental research exerted over him shows through in his words.\n\n13Occasionally, Stumpf’s work was rather dispersive. When he was asked to investigate the case of “kluge Hans”, a horse that was said to perform elementary calculations, he couldn’t resist the temptation [Stumpf 1907b].\n\nI fully realized the extraordinary difficulties involved; the excitement aroused in the city and even in foreign countries by the daily reports of the strange case in the newspapers; the curiosity of the crowds who sought admission; the peculiarities of Mr. von Osten; the unfavorable locality; etc. The irresistible desire to determine the facts induced me to undertake the investigation, and we finally succeeded in revealing the facts [...]. [Stumpf 1924, 407, emphasis added]\n\n14On other occasions he showed the same enthusiasm for the ascertainment of facts, despite fakes and mystifications, almost with a “detective” attitude, see [Stumpf 1904].\n\n3 Natural sciences, Geisteswissenschaften, and “neutral” sciences\n\n18In Stumpf’s view, the distinction between natural sciences and Geisteswissenschaften originates from the above mentioned dichotomy.\n\n11 Despite his use of the Kantian term Erscheinung, Stumpf does not think of a contraposition of pheno (...)\n\nNo matter how they are defined, the contraposition of the physical and the mental has always been the basis of the distinction between natural sciences and Geisteswissenschaften. [Stumpf 1906b, 10]\n\n19Accordingly, all natural sciences are rooted in phenomena, while Geisteswissenschaften stem from the study of mental functions.\n\nThe separation of natural sciences and mental sciences [Geisteswissenschaften] is based on the fundamental differences of sense data [Erscheinungen] and psychic functions, or on the respective contents of external (sensuous) and internal (psychological) perception. Phenomena and functions are directly presented in the closest connection, but they are essentially different. Observation of functions is the foundation of the mental sciences, however these latter are no more tied to their departure point than the natural sciences are. Just as the natural sciences proceed to the construction of the material outer world, so functions aim to understand the nature of psychic forces in general and the resulting actions and phenomena in terms of the inner life that alone is given to our observation. Psychology occupies the same place among the mental sciences as physics does among the natural sciences. [Stumpf 1924, 424]\n\n21Accordingly, natural sciences ultimately rest upon phenomena, but are the outcome of further elaboration; their objects are merely inferred from phenomena. In contrast, Geisteswissenschaften deal directly with mental functions, although they also include higher-order constructs. Psychology is the science of elementary mental functions, whereas the other Geisteswissenschaften deal with complex mental functions [Stumpf 1906b, 21]. In opposition to Husserl’s misunderstanding of psychology as a science of facts [Tatsachenwissenschaft] [Husserl 1911, 12-13], Stumpf claimed that psychology fundamentally aims to find the general laws of the psychical world, not merely to record mental occurrences [Stumpf 1939-1940, 194].\n\n4 Phenomenology and philosophy\n\n24In this sense, phenomenology formed the core of many of Stumpf’s own experimental activities:\n\nI have also devoted most of my time to phenomenological preparatory work, but my real aim has always been to understand functions. [Stumpf 1924, 424-425]\n\nThat’s for sure; it is neither metaphysics nor theory of knowledge, nor even the universal ideas of the values that keeps these very divergent areas of philosophical research together. Rather, this role is played by psychological research that those disciplines need in an equally strong manner. [Stumpf 1906b, 90]\n\n28It is true that some psychological research should be fruitfully pursued by means of experiments—“especially those that pertain not to psychology in a strict sense, but rather to phenomenology” [Stumpf 1906b, 90]. However, this seems to lose all contact with fundamental philosophical questions. Nevertheless, as discussed above, phenomenological research also contributes to philosophy and psychology as a whole provides the link connecting all the philosophical disciplines.\n\n29At the same time, psychology and philosophy still differ radically; for instance, while the inquiry into the origin of concepts is a psychological problem, the search for the origin of truth is purely philosophical [Stumpf 1891, 501], [Stumpf 1939-1940, (I), 6-7]. As Stumpf claimed in opposition to the Kantian account of space and time, form and matter, the categories and so on, philosophical ideas should always “pass the exam” of psychology. In fact, nothing can be “true from the point of view of the theory of knowledge [erkenntnistheoretisch]” and at the same time “psychologically false” [Stumpf 1891, 482].\n\n31In summary, natural sciences and Geisteswissenschaften need a preliminary “phenomenological” work, an experimental analysis of sensory data. This work is carried out by natural scientists and psychologists, who adopt an experimental approach, as Stumpf himself quite often did. Natural sciences and Geisteswissenschaften, including psychology, elaborate their materials and deduce laws concerning their own subject matters. On this basis, philosophy proceeds to a general reassessment of knowledge, aiming at the most universal objects and their unity. Internal coherence among the various philosophical disciplines is ultimately granted by psychology. This could suggest that Stumpf supports a close relationship of philosophy with Geisteswissenschaften. In the next section, I shall show that this is only partially true. Notwithstanding the close relationship between philosophy and psychology, Stumpf went so far as to give priority to the natural sciences over Geisteswissenschaften.\n\n5 Natural sciences and philosophy\n\n32As described above, Stumpf suggested that the philosopher is perfectly legitimate in carrying out experimental psychology, or experimental phenomenology, because such work is also fundamentally useful to ascertain philosophical truths. Moreover, he elaborates a more radical version of this approach. He does not simply concede that the philosopher is allowed to practice science; rather, he claims that the philosopher should do so. Stumpf counterattacked so to speak and charged his “armchair” colleagues with ignoring or misunderstanding important aspects of their discipline. In this, he did not merely propose a strong connection between philosophy and experimental psychology; rather he advocated a cooperation of philosophy with natural science in general.\n\n34Stumpf notes that philosophy has two main tasks: a theoretical and an ethical one. In the first place, philosophy should unify the most universal concepts, thus granting “a conclusion to our knowledge”; in the second place, philosophy should “elevate us [...] over the terrestrial atmosphere and the nothingness of everyday life”, enabling us to recognize our duties [Stumpf 1907a, 168]. There are two main ways of pursuing these goals: “philosophy of experience” [Erfahrungsphilosophie] and “a priori philosophy”. There is no doubt that Stumpf’s preference is for philosophy of experience, which moves from the outcomes of sciences and endeavors to maintain a close relationship with them. “The philosophy of experience”, he asserts, “grows out of single sciences and attempts to maintain the closest connection with them, to speak their language as far as possible, and to follow their methods [...]” [Stumpf 1907a, 169]. Rather than claiming for absolute systems, this kind of philosophy proceeds step by step and strives for relative conclusions. Even if it is provisional, any relative conclusion always represents an important result. In his late years, Stumpf still maintained this point:\n\nPhilosophy should get rid of the habit of appearing on the scene while claiming the need for a complete and self-contained system that can answer all questions. Its scientific character is proved by the fact that philosophy always leaves open many more questions than those it provides answers to. [Stumpf 1939-1940, (I), 123]\n\n35The philosophy of experience favors collective work, interactive discussion, and respect for the work of others. The execrable habit of starting every time from the very beginning, typical of many philosophers, should be finally overcome. Philosophy should take the best from scientific methodology and incorporate it into its praxis.\n\n37Remarkably, Stumpf has natural sciences in mind. It is true that Geisteswissenschaften may also assist the philosopher. Yet he warmly recommends a “comprehensive training in the field of the natural sciences” to all those who aim at “a satisfactory world view” [Stumpf 1907a, 179], rather than at an insight into specific philosophical disciplines like, e.g., philosophy of law, or aesthetics. Stumpf did not insinuate that Geisteswissenschaften are inferior to natural sciences in applying a rigorous methodology. Rather, the difference lies in the fact that while Geisteswissenschaften have a formal value in suggesting methodological rigor and precision to the philosopher, natural sciences, in addition, provide important material notions that are enormously valuable for our understanding of the world [Stumpf 1907a, 180-181]. In Stumpf’s view, scientific activity is far from being somehow opposed to philosophy; rather, familiarity with it promotes an attitude of strength and conveys material notions, which are the necessary ingredients for a renewed philosophy."
