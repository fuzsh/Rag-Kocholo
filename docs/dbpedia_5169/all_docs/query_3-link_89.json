Our art prints are produced on acid-free papers using archival inks to guarantee that they last a lifetime without fading or loss of color. All art prints include a 1\" white border around the image to allow for future framing and matting, if desired.\n\nCarl Stumpf (1848-1936), German psychologist and philosopher. Stumpf studied at Wurzburg and Gottingen, obtaining his doctorate at the latter in 1868. He worked in Gottingen, taking up a professorship at Wurzburg in 1873. His work included contributions on depth perception, with his major publication being on tone psychology ('Tonpsychologie', 1875). He proposed that tones, colours, and images are either sensory or imaginary, and coined the term phenomenology for the study of such characteristics. Stumpf held the chair of philosophy at the University of Berlin from 1894 to his retirement in 1921.\n\nScience Photo Library (SPL) is the leading source of science images and footage.
