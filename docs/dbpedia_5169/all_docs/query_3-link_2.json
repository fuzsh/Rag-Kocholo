        "text": "Carl Stumpf (born April 21, 1848, Wiesentheid, Lower Franconia, Bavaria [Germany]—died Dec. 25, 1936, Berlin) was a German philosopher and theoretical psychologist noted for his research on the psychology of music and tone.\n\nStumpf was influenced at the University of Würzburg by the philosopher Franz Brentano, founder of act psychology, or intentionalism. Appointed lecturer (Privatdozent) at the University of Göttingen in 1870, he wrote his first important work, Über den psychologischen Ursprung des Raumvorstellung (“The Psychological Origins of Space Perception”) three years later and soon thereafter was appointed professor at the University of Würzburg. In 1875 he began experiments for his Tonpsychologie, 2 vol. (1883–90; “Tone Psychology”), completed in the course of professorships at the Universities of Prague (1879), Halle (1884), and Munich (1889). This work was important not only for reporting the results of his experiments but also for revising concepts of psychophysics, which attempts to make quantitative measurements of physical stimuli and the sensations they produce."
