        "text": "Interesting day with a variety of events yesterday. Reflecting on the importance of attacking the process, not the people. Had a thought-provoking conversation with an intern about Nike's D2C business decline last quarter. While I may not have a definitive answer, I trust Nike’s iconic global brand to stay true to its essence amidst external opinions. Let's focus on the long-term vision rather than chasing trends. Currently leading our merchandise team, recognizing the need for more time and support for their exceptional work. Engaging our operational experts to enhance their experience in addressing challenges and improving internal processes. Encountered a remarkable sales leader recently; their experience and proactive approach were truly impressive. It's evident that finding exceptional talent and fostering a positive culture is a collective responsibility that starts at the leadership level, not just HR. #Leadership #Teamwork #CorporateCulture\n\nHow come you ended up doing something totally different. I get that question a lot, especially when I tell people about my leap of faith from working 18 years in a corporate environment to founding a Leadership and Cultural development agency. But for me, it's not that different from what I did at Nike. For me what I am doing now is not that different from what I did at Nike. I see this as coming full circle. As a manager, the personal and professional development of my team members was always the most important part of my job, and the piece I loved the most. At Nike, we had a Coaching for Excellence evaluation system that focused on creating team success and achieving business results. Interestingly, my rating on team performance was always higher than business results. My manager would jokingly ask if I promised my team a bonus because their feedback was always so positive about me as their manager. So, I took what I love - people - and what I am good at - talent development - and turned it into my business to create more impact. Now, together with my consultants, our work sits at the intersection of Talent, Culture, and Diversity & Inclusion Strategy. We are able to impact hundreds of talented individuals in the workplace across various organizations. And here's the full circle moment - Nike is one of my customers. #leadership #talentdevelopment #culture #diversityandinclusion #nike #coachingforexcellence #teambuilding #professionaldevelopment\n\nAlmost two years ago, I jumped into an exciting adventure by joining adidas. Back then, I had no idea about the challenges ahead, but looking back, I'm incredibly proud and grateful for the chance to lead an outstanding transformation program in the Supply Chain domain. I had the privilege to lead such a program with the most amazing, professional, and forward-thinking partners, Nicolas Moser and Jesper Pardieck supported by stakeholders that have brightened our way forwarded when needed. As I reflect on this journey, especially the past year, our achievements have been truly outstanding. We've discovered a potential that we believe will take us to even greater heights. By establishing and implementing a new operating model, we're gearing up for improved efficiency, agility, and integration in our work. We essentially started from scratch, building a united & global team with a common purpose. Our achievements involved creating entirely new teams in hub locations and expanding our service Global Business Services portfolio. Amidst inevitable changes, we embraced a people-centric approach, repurposing talent whenever possible. This journey, though undeniably challenging, required extreme resilience and unwavering dedication from everyone involved. Our success relied on the combined efforts of diverse teams spanning operations, HR, communications, PMOs, strategy and transitions. Undoubtedly, our ambitious plan required going the extra mile. This wasn't a solo mission but a collaborative effort. My sincere thanks & gratitude to every team player in this journey - your dedication set new transformation standards, proving that together, we can achieve anything. I'm excited to continue shaping the next chapters of this journey. #adidas #SupplyChainTransformation #SupplyChain #GlobalBusinessServices #Transformation #TeamCollaboration #GlobalTeam #TransformationSuccess #LeadershipJourney #StrategicPartnerships #OperationalExcellence #PeopleCentricApproach #TeamworkMakestheDreamWork\n\nNike’s Leadership Shake-Up: Paving the Way for Future Growth and Innovation Nike is making headlines again with strategic changes at the top. Tom Clarke, a 30-year veteran, has been promoted to Strategic Advisor to CEO John Donahoe. Clarke’s extensive experience, particularly as President of Innovation, will be invaluable as he collaborates with the executive team to drive key initiatives and long-term growth. In another major move, John Hoke, with three decades at Nike and former Chief Design Officer, has been appointed Advanced Innovation Lead. Hoke’s track record as Chief Innovation Officer since November underscores his critical role in propelling Nike’s innovation strategy forward. Additionally, Nike has brought back former senior executive Tom Peddie as Vice President of Marketplace Partners. These leadership changes come during a turbulent time for Nike, as the company faces market challenges. Recent weak quarterly earnings and a downgraded outlook caused a 20% drop in shares, erasing about $28 billion in shareholder value. This marks the most significant one-day percentage decline in Nike’s stock since it went public in 1980. #Nike #Leadership #Innovation #Growth #BusinessStrategy #MarketTrends #JohnDonahoe #TomClarke #JohnHoke #TomPeddie #CorporateNews #StrategicLeadership\n\nI just presented the findings of my personal side-project at adidas to the department leader. It is about creativity inside our teams. I had over +13 coffee chats with leaders and team members, and some more with external contacts that gave me a lot of input and perspective (including Shawna Eberle, Miloš Borovšak, Juliana Gómez Mazuera, Frances Vieras Blanc ✨ and Konstantin Mitgutsch - Thank you!). The outcome, for now, is a first and hypothetical model for cultivating a creative mindset in our department. It's based on three pillars: Trust, experimentation, and community. And the enablers that nourish it are curiosity, encouragement, embedment, and data. I look forward to further developing it, experimenting, and validating hypotheses! So, if you are curious or want to know more about the process, DM me! I'm always happy to share this passion of mine. #creativity #innovation #teamwork #mindset #research\n\nStop being like everyone else and be you, be different, be a black sheep. If you look at brands like apple or nike they took huge risks early on in the way they did things both from a visual identity and a business perspective. You could argue don't fix it if it ain't broke, but i would also argue no one innovated anything by following the pack. The risks, the differences in the way they structured their company, the way they challenged the status quo with their products and how they went to market are all really the reason we even noticed these top tier brands and the reason they've become so successful. It's easy to say well this is familiar to my customer. Maybe so, but familiarity gets lost and you don't want to get left behind. Think differently isn't just apples tagline, its challenging us all to be innovators and do what they and nike have done and branch out to be something unique and impactful. So consider being a black sheep and be proud of your differences and unwillingness to follow the herd.\n\nENJOY THE RIDE (another cycle has come to an end in my life) After 2 years with David Yurman, I am heading to my next adventure. In the last few weeks, I had a chance to reflect in all the things I have experienced in my professional life… from great moments such as: … leading the effort to enter a new country (Mexico) for David’s Bridal, building a new franchise model and setting the operations for launch … … helping Nike develop its 5–10-year manufacturing strategy to support future growth… … redesigning an end-to-end product development process for Old Navy to bring new products faster to market to meet new customer trends… … driving a digital, technology transformation for David Yurman to enhance personalization to better communicate and serve customers… But also, some of the challenging moments: … staying up for 48 hours straight in the basement floor of a client, preparing for a big presentation with CEO in my early consulting years … … coming to US with an “OK” English and having to master the language on the fly as I was trying to perform my job… … experiencing the uncertainties of a new job, new city, and new boss – having to re-adapt to the new realities and challenges that come with it… When I look back: what a journey!!! … how many learnings along the way … all helping define who I am. Great or challenging moments… embrace them… grow with them… but most importantly: ENJOY THE RIDE! I am looking forward to my next adventure… and new learnings… #management #leadership #retailing\n\n【U: TALK - Why do I constantly strive to challenge myself?】 Leaders’ growth journey behind the scenes! Success doesn't happen overnight. It's a journey of experimentation, growth, and the sheer will to change for the better. Just ask Cherry and Zenrick, our UNIQLO Global Flagship Store Manager and Area Manager who ascended to new heights. They started their journeys with a burning desire for more, overcoming multiple challenges along the way. As UNIQLO leaders, they made a real difference in the lives of others. But they didn't do it alone. With the unwavering support of their teams, they faced each challenge head-on and experimented to achieve their goals. Together, they fearlessly tackled every obstacle that came their way. #uniqlo #lifewear #powerofclothing #recruitment #uniqlohongkong #uniqlomacau #uniqlocareers #utalk #findthepowerthatchangesyou #earnyoursuccess #experimenttoachieve #empoweredtochangeforthebetter #businessleader #globalchallenge #rapidgrowth #changetheworld\n\nReflecting on some of the decisions I've made in the past, it dawned on me that I could've achieved many things much earlier if I hadn’t bogged myself down with unnecessary prerequisites. You know the ones: \"Maybe it's not the right time,\" \"What if it offends someone?\" or my personal favorite, \"Am I really ready?\" But here’s the kicker – growing older has taught me that the only true prerequisite for making a decision is genuinely wanting to do it. Think about it: all those times you hesitated, analyzed, and overthought a decision, what did it get you? Probably a whole lot of nothing. Imagine if Nike’s slogan was “Just Do It...but only if the conditions are perfect, and everyone approves, and you're 100% sure you're ready.” Ridiculous, right? The truth is, the moment you decide you want something, that's when you should go for it. The desire to act should be your green light, not the endless list of “what ifs” and “maybes.” So, if you're contemplating a decision right now and drowning in a sea of prerequisites, here’s a tip: screw them. Just want to do it, and then do it. Life’s too short to wait for perfect conditions that might never come. Make the choice, take the leap, and see where it takes you. #JustDoIt #NoPrerequisites #TakeTheLeap #DecisionMaking #mirandism #unapologetic #unapologeticdude\n\nThis was all over the news: Adidas CEO gave out his number to 60,000 employees. I get it! Very early in my career, I worked for a big tech company. As a workaholic, I was always working late. The company CEO had a habit of leaving his door half-open in the late evening hours. One evening, before I headed home I passed by that half-open door and said \"Good Night\" - I didn't want to be rude. He didn't know me but said \"Hello? Can you come back?\" and so I did. He invited me to join his late pizza he just ordered and then asked me about my work, my team, customer meetings, what I think works and what didn't. After I finished my pizza and thanked him for the late dinner and \"great talk\", he asked me: \"Did you notice I left the door open? Why doesn't anyone come in and talk to me like you did?\" He wasn't referring to his exec team, he was referring to employees like me. It was a lesson for me in leadership. That although he was the CEO he didn't know everything and he truly believed that even someone as junior as I was, could help; with a thought, an idea, sharing an insight, or a doubt. I didn't think less of him, I admired him for the ask, and for being open to learn from anyone. I trusted him for truly wanting what's best for our customers, the company, and for me as an employee. As leaders, we have blindspots - great leaders admit and address it. #leadershipstyle #leadershipinsights #vision #startingfromscratch ——————————————————— 👋 I’m Osnat (Os) Benari I wrote the book “Starting From Scratch - Manage Change Like Your Career Depends On It” and it’s packed with tips to help you build a resilient career."
