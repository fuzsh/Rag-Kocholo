        "meta_description": "We will show that Carl Stumpf's interpretation of the concept of probability is best understood as that of an objective Bayesian. First we analyse Stumpf's work in relation to that of his contemporary Johannes von Kries, and after that we will discuss various ways in which Stumpf's probability-concept has been construed. By showing that the construals of Stumpf's account by Hans Reichenbach, Richard von Mises and Andreas Kamlah are unfair - and at some points incorrect - we uncover the aspects that are essential to Stumpf's probability interpretation.",
