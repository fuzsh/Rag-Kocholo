LOL!)Pa was a typical farmer that loved his family and he too didn’t care for Nellie and her mother, but always tried to do the right thing–\n\nthere was even an episode where he tried to find a home (or homes) for a widows children after she passed away and had to make a decision that he didn’t want to when it involved keeping the widows kids together.\n\ni also love the episode where pa reinacted his proposal to caroline and they renewed their vows– the dress she wore(it belonged to a friend) was gorgeous."
