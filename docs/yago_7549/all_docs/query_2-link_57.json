        "text": "I will admit that when my sister and I began planning visits to all of the Laura Ingalls Wilder homesites, I was most excited to see the places I’d read about in Laura’s Little House books. That did not include Mansfield.\n\nAfter visiting? All I can say is that it is a very special place.\n\nWilder fans know from The First Four Years that Laura and Almanzo faced many hardships and tragedies in South Dakota after their marriage. They moved to Florida, but weren’t happy and moved back. After hearing good things about Missouri, Laura, Almanzo, and daughter Rose traveled to Mansfield in 1894. They brought the few possessions saved from the fire that destroyed their tree claim house, and $100 to buy land.\n\nThe family settled on a rocky ridge one mile east of Mansfield, and moved into a run-down, windowless log cabin. (They also lived in town for a period.) Laura and Almanzo worked together for years, as time and money and energy permitted, to create the lovely farm and 12-room house. They lived happily on Rocky Ridge Farm for the rest of their lives.\n\nIf you drive from Mansfield, you’ll approach the property just as the Wilders’ friends did.\n\nAlmanzo built the house with Laura’s wishes in mind. For example, all of the kitchen counters were designed to accommodate her five-foot height. It’s a delight to see examples of his carpentry skills. He also set up a clever pipe system that brought spring water inside, through the wood stove to warm, and into the kitchen sink.\n\nWhen Almanzo built the chimney, he included several stones exhibiting fossils.\n\nThe house interior looks as if Laura just stepped out for a moment. If you’ve read the 7th Chloe Ellefson mystery, Death on the Prairie, Chloe’s reaction to seeing the Wilders’ bedroom mirrors what I felt on my first visit. (Sadly, photos are not permitted inside.)\n\nI can show you the small back porch (to the left in the photo below) that was featured in a key scene.\n\nHere’s the view when you step into the porch and look to the left.\n\nWhen strolling the grounds, it’s easy to imagine Laura and Almanzo there.\n\nThey planted the orchard. I was sorely tempted to take a windfall apple home. (I didn’t.)\n\nThere is also a museum on the property. Pa’s fiddle, Mary’s nine-patch quilt, and hand-written drafts of Laura’s books are among the many treasures on display. (Sorry—again, no photos permitted.) The Wilder Home Association is currently constructing a new museum a short distance away, which will help restore the period landscape around the farmhouse.\n\nIn 1928 Rose gifted her parents with the Rock House, accessible from the farmhouse on a trail through the woods. Rose wanted to provide Laura and Almanzo with more modern conveniences. Laura began writing the Little House books here.\n\nThey missed the farmhouse, though, and moved back in 1936.\n\nThe area landscape today is much like it was in Laura’s time. It’s easy to see why she loved the region so much.\n\nLaura, Almanzo, and Rose are buried nearby in the Mansfield Cemetery.\n\nLaura’s writing career began in Missouri—not as a novelist, but as a regular contributor to the Missouri Ruralist. Her articles paint a pictures of the Wilders’ life in Missouri. You can read a collection in Laura Ingalls Wilder, Farm Journalist: Writing From The Ozarks.\n\nTo learn more about Laura’s homesites, I highly recommend Laura Ingalls Wilder Country by William Anderson.\n\nTo learn more about the Laura Ingalls Wilder Historic Home and Museum, visit their website.\n\nFor more information about Death on the Prairie, including links to other tour stops, photographs, maps, and much more, please visit my website.\n\nI hope you’ve enjoyed the armchair tour!\n\nAs I mentioned in my last post about De Smet, avid Laura Ingalls Wilder fans can easily spend more than a single day in the area.\n\nI suggest picking up a copy of the booklet “Explore De Smet,” a walking and driving guide to many of the sites mentioned in, or relevant to, the books set in South Dakota.\n\nIt’s fun to walk the streets and discover the locations of homes and businesses Laura mentioned in her books. In addition to the guide, interpretive signs help visitors get their historical bearings.\n\nYou can visit the Loftus Store. In The Long Winter, Cap Garland and Almanzo Wilder risked their lives to bring wheat back to the town’s starving residents, only to have storekeeper Loftus try to cheat his customers by asking an exorbitant price.\n\nAfter exploring the town, jump in your car to see sites in the area. The Big Slough, described in By The Shores of Silver Lake, is located just south of town. It’s much smaller than it was in Laura’s day, but worth a stop.\n\nI also wanted to see Silver Lake, but had a hard time finding it. Finally one of the Historic Homes guides gave me good directions. A lane into a small industrial area led to a vantage point where I could see the lake.\n\nOne of my favorite places in all of Laura Land is the Memorial Site, one mile southeast of De Smet.\n\nIn 1880 Charles Ingalls (Pa) filed a homestead claim for this land. The Memorial is in one corner of that original property.\n\nThe tiny cottonwood trees Charles planted for his family are still there, and now enormous. It is very special to walk among them.\n\nFor hands-on fun (especially with kids) you can also visit “The Ingalls Homestead: Laura’s Living Prairie” right up the hill.\n\nLaura married Almanzo Wilder in 1885. The site of their homestead is on private land, but a sign marks the spot.\n\nMany Laura fans also visit the De Smet Cemetery, as Chloe Ellefson does in Death on the Prairie:\n\nChloe drove next to the De Smet Cemetery, a peaceful place on a hilltop between the town, a remnant slough, and farmland. It didn’t take long to find the graves of Ma and Pa, Mary, Carrie, and Grace. Then – “Oh.” She stopped in front of a low stone that said simply, Baby son of A.J. Wilder.\n\n“Why?” she demanded softly. Why just note the father? Why was Laura’s name left off the stone? The omission was exasperating, perplexing, and terribly sad. Even sadder was the fact that Laura and Almanzo had evidently not named their son.\n\nBut…perhaps Laura named him in her heart.\n\nIf you visit, you’ll find stones for Laura’s parents and sisters nearby.\n\nWhen my sister and I toured De Smet for the first time we also wanted to see where Cap Garland was buried. Again, a guide at the Historic Homes gave us great directions (to a different cemetery), and described the stone so we could find it easily.\n\nThe guide also suggested we visit the area where Almanzo took Laura courting. We were running out of daylight—but that only made it easier to imagine the couple getting to know each other during buggy rides.\n\nIf you’d like to see more I highly recommend Discover Laura, the official blog of Laura Ingalls Wilder Historic Homes. It features a virtual tour of De Smet, family artifacts, and site news. (Here’s a post about Cap Garland and his family.)\n\nFor more information about Death on the Prairie, including links to other tour stops, photographs, maps, and much more, please visit my website.\n\nNext stop: Little House On The Prairie museum in Independence, Kansas!\n\nMy advice if you head to De Smet: plan to stay a couple of days. As Laura Ingalls Wilder fans know, By the Shores Of Silver Lake, The Long Winter, Little Town On the Prairie, and These Happy Golden Years were all set in and near De Smet. The First Four Years, published posthumously, also takes place here. And there is a lot for visitors to see.\n\nThe Laura Ingalls Wilder Memorial Society operates the Laura Ingalls Wilder Historic Homes. Start your visit here to purchase tour tickets, browse the gift shop, and see family artifacts.\n\nThe Society currently maintains more than 2,000 original artifacts pertaining to Laura and her family. Photos are not permitted in the exhibit area, but it contains some real treasures.\n\nThe first building on the Historic Homes tour is the Surveyors’ House, where the Ingalls family spent the winter of 1879-1880. When the family moves in, Laura is so excited that she runs ahead to explore.\n\nIt was a big house, a real house with two stories, and glass windows… The largeness of the empty house seemed to wait and listen. It seemed to know that Laura was there, but it had not made up its mind about her. …This would be by far the largest house she had ever lived in. (By The Shores Of Silver Lake)\n\nA guide told me that many visitors, remembering Laura’s delighted description, are surprised by how small the house feels by modern standards.\n\nLaura also wrote of finding three closed doors. The first (visible on the right in the photo below) led to a small bedroom. The middle led to a staircase. (For safety reasons visitors can’t climb to the second story, but an ingeniously placed mirror provides a good look.) The third door led to a stocked pantry. Laura was astonished by the bounty: A squeal of excitement came out of her mouth and startled the listening house.\n\nSilver Lake is one of my favorite books, and it was a treat to visit. How fortunate we are that the building was saved!\n\nThe newest building on the grounds is the First School of De Smet, which Laura and her younger sister Carrie attended. (Remember when Laura defends frail Carrie after Eliza Jane Wilder, teacher and Laura’s future sister-in-law, singles her out for punishment?)\n\nThe building is the newest addition, and when I last visited, was still being restored. Happily, visitors are permitted to watch the process. It’s fascinating to see the structure’s layers.\n\nGuests can also see a replica of the Brewster School, where Laura taught for the first time. In These Happy Golden Years Laura described some harrowing experiences–and her surprise when Almanzo Wilder arrives in his sleigh to take her home.\n\n(When I was writing Death on the Prairie, I wanted my main character Chloe Ellefson to reflect upon her own changing perspective—how rereading the books brought new understanding. As a child, Chloe was terrified to read of Mrs. Brewster threatening her husband with a knife; as an adult, she is better able to appreciate the challenges some women faced when isolated on the prairie.)\n\nThe final stop on the formal Homes tour is the Ingalls Home on Third Street. Charles Ingalls (Pa) built the house in 1887. Laura was married by that time, and so never lived in the home.\n\nSince I hadn’t read anything about the house before visiting De Smet, I wasn’t sure what to expect here. Neither was Chloe:\n\nInside, the group bunched up in the parlor where Ma and Pa had spent their evenings. “After Mary graduated from the school for the blind in Iowa,” Edna Jo added, “she lived here as well.”\n\nAll interesting, Chloe thought. But there was no point in looking for Laura in this house.\n\n“The night before Laura and Almanzo and Rose moved to Missouri, everyone gathered in this room,” Edna Jo continued. “After supper Laura asked Pa to get out his fiddle. He played almost until sunup. Laura didn’t know if she’d ever see her parents or sisters again. Pa told Laura that he wanted her to have his fiddle when he died.”\n\nChloe’s throat thickened. So much for not looking for Laura here.\n\n“When the Wilders drove away in their wagon, Laura broke down and wept,” Edna Jo said softly. “She told Almanzo that she didn’t think the Ingalls family would have survived if it hadn’t been for Pa’s fiddle.”\n\nThat scene took place in the front room on the left. Mary Ingalls’ bedroom is to the right.\n\nDeath on the Prairie readers may also recall a key scene that take place in the kitchen, in the back. During my first visit a guide told me that visitors often have emotional reactions to some of the displays there.\n\n# # #\n\nDe Smet, SD, is located about two hours west of Walnut Grove, MN. You may wish to stop at the Wheels Across The Prairie Museum in Tracy, MN on the way. In The Long Winter men struggled, and ultimately failed, to get a desperately needed train full of supplies from Tracy to De Smet.\n\nFor more information about Death on the Prairie, including links to other tour stops, photographs, maps, and much more, please visit my website.\n\nNext time, a glimpse of some of the other special places to visit in De Smet, South Dakota!\n\nA strong sense of place is an essential element of Laura Ingalls Wilder’s classic books. Thematically, the series is all about place—finding a place to call home.\n\nLaura excelled at evoking her settings for readers. Yes, I know her books were edited by her daughter Rose. But some of Laura’s original, unedited writing is rich with vivid detail. I suspect that her descriptive skills were honed after her sister Mary went blind.\n\nWhen I was a child growing up in suburban Baltimore, she brought the Big Woods and endless prairies to life in my imagination. These days I reread descriptive passages for pleasure and inspiration. Consider these examples:\n\nFar away the sun’s edge touched the rim of the earth. The sun was enormous and it was throbbing and pulsing with light. All around the sky’s edge ran a pale pink glow, and above the pink was yellow, and above that blue. Above the blue sky was no color at all. Purple shadows were gathering over the land, and the wind was mourning. (Little House On The Prairie)\n\nNow plums were ripening in the wild-plum thickets all along Plum Creek. Plum trees were low trees. They grew close together, with many little scraggly branches all strung with thin-skinned, juicy plums. Around them the air was sweet and sleepy, and wings hummed. (By The Banks Of Plum Creek)\n\nIt was so beautiful that they hardly breathed. The great round moon hung in the sky and its radiance poured over a silvery world. Far, far away in every direction stretched motionless flatness, softly shining as if it were made of soft light. In the midst lay the dark, smooth lake, and a glittering monolith stretched across it. Tall grass stood up in black lines from the snow drifted in the sloughs. (By The Shores Of Silver Lake)\n\nLaura fans often feel compelled to visit such places. Happily, due to the hard work of dedicated people in the communities Laura once called home, there are homesites to explore in Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, Kansas, and Missouri. (Not to mention her husband Almanzo’s home in New York.)\n\nI am in awe, actually, of how hard many people have worked to provide a special experience for those who come looking for Laura. One of my own favorite Laura stops is the Dugout Site in Walnut Grove, MN. When Garth Williams was hired to illustrate new editions of the books, he searched for–and found—a depression that marked the spot along Plum Creek where the Ingalls family lived.\n\nAs I’ve heard the story, the farm family which owned the property was surprised when Mr. Williams knocked on their door and explained his discovery. Since then, the family has made the site accessible to visitors.\n\nSomething similar happened at the Kansas homesite, which was identified much more recently. Laura fans owe these generous people a debt of gratitude.\n\nIt would be easier to fund a single, central Laura Ingalls Wilder museum, but that would never do. We want to experience the landscape for ourselves.\n\nThere is also something powerful about walking the ground where Laura and her family walked.\n\nWhen I began planning Death on the Prairie, the 6th Chloe Ellefson mystery, I knew I needed to get Chloe on the road. Chloe and her sister Kari had long dreamed of making the tour, and the need to authenticate a newly discovered quilt once owned by Laura spurs the sisters to visit the primary Laura homesites.\n\nFor those readers who savor armchair travel, I’ll be posting about each place in the coming weeks. If you’ve visited the sites, I hope you’ll share some memories!"
