        "text": "Nickname: Little Brownbraid\n\nBirthday: December 12, 1839\n\nBirthplace: Brookfield, Wisconsin\n\nParents: Henry Newton Quiner & Charlotte Tucker Quiner\n\nBrothers & Sisters: Joseph, Henry, Martha, Eliza, Thomas\n\nLikes: Games such as fox-and-geese, and poison-tag\n\nDislikes: Hand-me-down dresses and shoes\n\nCaroline Quiner, who grew up to be Laura's Ma, was born in a frame house in the little town of Brookfield, Wisconsin, near the banks of Lake Michigan. Caroline's parents were among the first pioneer families to settle in this region, which is now part of the densely populated Milwaukee metropolitan area. Caroline's father made a good living trading with the local Native Americans. But while on a trading voyage in 1844, he drowned when his schooner was lost during a fierce storm near the Mackinac Straights on Lake Michigan."
