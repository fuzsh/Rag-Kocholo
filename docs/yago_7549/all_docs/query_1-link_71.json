        "text": "“Ma was busy all day long, cooking good things for Christmas. She baked salt rising bread…” pg. 62\n\nThere is no quicker way into my heart then fresh baked bread. My husband used to make me dinner when we were courting and while it was typical University fare it was his fresh baked bread that won me over each time. Crunch to the crust and a soft interior…throw a sunbeam in there, rereading the Big Woods and I’m set. Years later this love turned into buying two loaves; one for dinner and one to eat on the back porch slowly while reading in said sunbeam with a glass of white wine.\n\nFor someone that finds proofing detailed I can’t imagine not having access to yeast for our dinner loaves. Since not having bread at the dinner table isn’t an option, clearly my ancestors, baking pioneers emerged using natural fermentation. Heat and time sufficed for the general store assistance. Instead they used long term warmth and natural bacteria.\n\nSalt rising bread has maintained popularity in the Appalachian states to this day. A modern generation of bakers are continuing this tradition. Susan Ray Brown at Rising Creek Bakery in Pennsylvania specializes in salt rising bread. Her website saltrisingbread.net is a fantastic source of history and recipes. I’ve been combing through her pages reading the stories she’s compiled as well as recipe variations. I’ll be trying a recipe this weekend while I’m pre-purchasing her book off Amazon. She shared the below recipe on her website that comes from a baker in Pennsylvania that has been baking salt rising bread for over 80 years. Look for her book this June at your local bookstore.\n\n“3 tsp. cornmeal, 1 tsp flour, 1/8 tsp baking soda, 1/2 cup scalded milk\n\nPour milk onto dry ingredients and stir. Keep warm overnight until foamy. After “raisin” has foamed and has a “rotten cheese” smell, in a medium sized bowl, add 2 cups of warm water to mixture, then enough flour (about 1 ½ cup) to make like a thin pancake batter. Stir and let rise again until becomes foamy. This usually takes about 2 hours. Next, add one cup of warm water for each loaf of bread you want to make, up to 6 loaves (e.g. six cups of water makes six loaves of bread). Add enough flour (20 cups for 6 loaves, or about one 5 pound bag of flour + 1/3 bag). Form into loaves; grease tops of loaves. Let rise in greased pans for several hours, maybe 2-6 hours. Bake at 300 F for 30 to 45 minutes, or until loaves sound hollow when tapped.”\n\nhttp://saltrisingbread.net/\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Salt-Rising-Bread-Heartfelt-Appalachian/dp/1943366039?ie=UTF8&keywords=salt%20rising%20bread&qid=1453773918&ref_=sr_1_1&s=books&sr=1-1\n\nLet’s look at a letter in the Wisconsin Historical Society Collection from Caroline Ingalls to her sister Martha. Caroline was newly married and living in Concord, Wisconsin. A few years after this letter Charles and Caroline would themselves move north to join Martha and her husband near Pepin where the setting for Little House in the Big Woods begins. Caroline, or Ma, writes of health, money, travel and starting over. Themes that would not only echo in the Little House series but still into our own modern lives.\n\nMy heart grew three sizes when I found this letter scanned and uploaded to the Wisconsin Historical Society. Such a powerful reminder of the capabilities of the internet and the ability for small museums or historical societies to reach out to the world. Historians would previously have to painstakingly visit state by state pouring over original documents versus my ability from Calgary, Alberta to virtually visit historical societies with ties to Laura. Eventually I would love to visit every museum, library and society but it’s wonderful to that I’m a Google search away for now. I’ve uploaded scans of the original letter and also included a typed version of the letter. Enjoy reading!\n\n“Concord, Sunday Oct 6th [1861]\n\nDear brother and sister,\n\nI was at home today and mother told me how long it had been since any of us had written to you and thinking that you must be very anxious to hear from home, I thought I would write immediately. I have not had time to write since we received your letter until now. Mother is quite well at present. Two of her fingers on her left hand she cannot use much. You asked me to describe the disease Ma had, but I don’t know as I can. They called it the Scarlet Dyptheria [scarlet fever]. She was of a scarlet red from head to foot and of a burning heat, and when she began to get better the skin came off all over her. She could peel it off in large pieces; all her finger nails came off and as I told you before she has not the full use of two of them yet. She suffered much. You cannot imagine nor I describe how much. But I feel truly thankful to kind providence for her restoration. Charlotte and Eliza had the same disease but very lightly, Louisa and Lafayette had it and were not expected to live but they too recovered and are well now. Louisa is a very pretty little girl. She talks considerable. Thomas is at home and just as good a boy as ever. He said last night he would give so much to see you. He would be so pleased to get a letter from you particularly for himself. Martha, you don’t know how proud I am of him. Charlotte came home with me today. She says, tell Martha she is going to write to her when Ma writes again. She is getting to be quite a help to Ma. And now about Charles and Caroline. We are well and enjoying ourselves. You will think I am healthy when I tell you how much I weigh. I weigh 138 pounds. Charles is well but he has worked very hard this summer and is about tired out now. We have got our hops picked and pressed. It took three weeks with 20 pickers to pick them. We have sold $250 worth and have about as many more to sell as we have sold; but we do not expect to get as much for the remainder, as the price is reduced. We wish you much joy with your baby. Oh how we wish we could see you all. You have chosen a very pretty name for your boy. Strive to bring him up to be an honor to his parents and his country, kiss him for me. I suppose you have heard before this that Nancy has another boy. They have named it John for the first name and I believe Carpenter for the second. She is bound to keep ahead of you I guess. Monday night. Father Ingalls folks have gone up to the head waters of the Baraboo River. They started last Tuesday. They felt very bad about leaving their place and it was too bad. They were too old to be moving; but Pa did his best to save it but he could not. Peter and Eliza have gone with them. I did not tell you of father’s health. He is not able to do much work and only that that is light. Dr. Chapman says he must not work. I must bring my letter to a close. Charles was too tired to write tonight so you must excuse him. He unites with me in sending our love to you all. Write soon. From your affectionate brother and sister,\n\nC.C. Ingalls\n\nCharles and Caroline, Martha, Charles”\n\nIngalls, Caroline Quiner. Letter to Martha Quiner Carpenter, Oct. 6, 1861, in: Letters to Charles and Martha Carpenter, 1861-1919 and 1975-1977, Wisconsin Historical Society manuscript collection Stout SC 142.

These early works were literal samp-cloths or examplars which were a recording of various stitch styles and patterns. “In an age when paper was scarce and books were scarcer, the logical way for a woman to remember an interesting pattern or stitch was to copy it on her own sampler”. (Grow and McGrail, 13) What started basically a cloth notepad to track all those amazing stitches you came across would slowly morph into an art into it’s own right. 16th century samplers began to display the stitcher’s name, narrow in dimension and repeat patterns. Finally as English settlers descended into the colonies 17th century samplers lost all reference value and displayed decorative motifs that previously were random at best. These narrow samplers could easily be used on households linens or clothing. The 18th century would see the slow transition between narrow to the square samplers we now traditional think of. Because of the time invested into creating these pieces between household chores and the ease of portability samplers were a wonderful way to remember family and friends as migration went from across the ocean to across the mountain ranges.\n\nAs America expanded from the shores of the east coast into new frontiers and as new cultures immigrated throughout the 18th century samplers began to cultivate a uniquely American style. Design elements widened to include pictorial, borders, architecture, darning, maps, mathematics, and alphabets. Educational materials creeping into samplers has created a misconception that these were used in female schools to teach young woman. How oh how could these delicate vessels learn to read? Given the hardship of an ocean crossing and raising a family in cold, hungry New England why does the idea persist of woman as illiterate witches? These woman were colonial rock stars. Children over the age of six could traditionally read prior to admittance to colonial schools and young woman, 12 or 13, working on samplers would have been reading for years. “A far more reasonable explanation for the existence of the alphabet sampler can be found in one of the practical functions of embroidery itself. A model for embroidered numbers and letters of the alphabet was an essential part of a young girl’s education-someday she would be a housewife who would have to embroider identification marks on valuable household linens. All articles of personal clothing-as well as sheets, pillow covers and towels-were carefully marked and numbered so that they could be counted and checked regularly. We can get some idea of how precious household linen was considered by looking at the care with which it was enumerated in old wills and household inventories; and we can get some idea of why it was so precious by reading a description of the labor that was necessary to produce a yard of linen cloth.” (Grow and McGrail, 25)\n\nThrough repeated design elements in samplers between settlements you can see communication and migrations patterns. The original telephone game involved silk thread and linen it turns out. Isolated communities’, due to religion or geography, samplers look vastly different then their urban counterparts who benefited from girl’s boarding schools and seminaries. Repetition could be traced through students in specific schools in New England returning home and teaching their own pupils or families stitches. Simply through studying these early American samplers an economic and social timeline emerges outside of the few remaining written correspondence preserved. From frontier colonists to established American families you can trace the emerging economic climate of the United States. As well as view which early communities favored isolation. “…because the Pennsylvania-Germans purposefully isolated themselves from other cultural influences, continuing to follow the older patterns and customs not only in sampler design, but in all aspects of folk decoration. The Jewish-American girls, unlike their Pennsylvania-German counterparts, were located primarily in urban areas. Their samplers were made in the prevailing style of the time and place” (Grow and McGrail, 39) 1840-1850 saw the slow decline of American design. Germany, Berlin specifically, began producing exacting designs patterns with increases in shading and increased threads used. It was only the nostalgia of the Centennial Exposition in 1876 that one saw the reproduction of earlier styles. Patriotic patterns also began circulating with holes already punched out on heavy paper for wool embroidery. I believe we can thus trace the original hipster to 1876. Early American styles were just so much cooler then the industrialized punched design…and that my friends is how Brooklyn was founded. The first “I liked it before it went mainstream” was said with a sigh following a flip of the bonnet and log cabin coffee shops sprang from the ether. -story of Brooklyn may be based on passing thoughts and not actual facts\n\nLaura Ingalls was born on February 7th, 1867 in Pepin, Wisconsin. In Little House in the Big Woods it’s Ma who remarks to Laura how much easier quiet Sundays are now compared to the story Pa tells of a Sunday misadventures involving a pig, a sled and a thrashing. “It was harder for little girls. Because they had to behave like little ladies all the time, not only on Sundays. Little girls could never slide downhill, like boys. Little girls had to sit in the house and stitch on samplers” pg. 96. Pa’s father, Lansford Ingalls, was born in Canada whose family was originally from England and settled with the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Ma’s mother, Charlotte Quiner, was born in Massachusetts in 1809 whose own mother emigrated from Scotland. The female history on both sides of the family would have had a long history into American samplers design and execution. What motifs would Caroline Ingalls remember as part of her childhood? How frequently were new designs shared with her family during childhood and by whom?\n\nAs for me, it’s going to be difficult to look at sampler now at an auction and not see the design, economics and industry behind each piece.\n\nResearch included in this blog included a amazing book I found tucked away at Powell’s Bookstore in Portland, Oregon.
