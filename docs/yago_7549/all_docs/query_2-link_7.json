        "text": "Seems as though all I ever saw of Pa was his face especially his eyes, his whiskers and his hair always standing on end. And too his hands on his violin. – Laura Ingalls Wilder, 1936\n\nCharles Philip Ingalls was born January 10, 1836, in Cuba Township (Allegheny County) New York, the third of ten children of Lansford Whiting Ingalls and Laura Louise Colby. He had older brother Peter (born 1833) and younger siblings Lydia (born 1838), Polly (born 1840), James (born 1842), Docia (born 1845), Hiram (born 1848), George (born 1851), and Ruby (born 1855). An older sibling died shortly after birth in 1835.\n\nBefore Charles was twelve years old, the Ingalls family moved to Kane County, Illinois, just west of Chicago. In the early 1850s, they moved to Concord Township (Jefferson County) Wisconsin; Lansford Ingalls bought 80 acres there in 1854. In 1857, Charles Ingalls purchased a portion of this property from his father. Charles’ land was just north of the Oconomowoc River; to the south lived the Holbrooks: Frederick, his wife Charlotte (widow of Henry N. Quiner), and her children Henry, Martha, Caroline, Eliza, and Thomas. Charlotte’s eldest son, Joseph, married in 1856 and lived several miles away.\n\nThere were three marriages between the Ingalls and Quiner families: Henry Quiner married Polly Ingalls in 1859, and Peter Ingalls married Eliza Quiner in 1861. Charles Ingalls and Caroline Quiner were married in Concord on February 1, 1860.\n\nLansford Ingalls lost his farm in Jefferson County, and it was sold at sheriff’s auction in January 1861. This probably influenced Charles Ingalls and other family members to sell their land there and move on. In the summer of 1860, Martha Quiner had married Charles Carpenter, and he and other friends from the Concord area had relocated to Pepin County, and they were encouraging others to consider joining them there.\n\nSeptember 1863, Charles Ingalls and his brother-in-law, Henry Quiner, paid $335 for 160 acres in Pepin County – the SW 27-25-15. Charles and Caroline settled on the south half of the quarter section, and Henry and Polly settled on the north side. Charles and Caroline Ingalls had two daughters born in Pepin County: Mary Amelia (born January 10, 1865) and Laura Elizabeth (born February 7, 1867).\n\nDaughter Carrie was born in Rutland Township (Montgomery County) Kansas on August 3, 1870. Son Charles Frederick was born November 1, 1875, in Walnut Grove (Redwood County) Minnesota; he died August 27, 1876, in South Troy (Wabasha County) Minnesota. Daughter Grace Pearl was born May 23, 1877, in Burr Oak (Winneshiek County) Iowa.\n\nIn 1937, Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote that her father was a “hunter and a trapper, a poet and a musician.” Charles Ingalls at various times was also a justice of the peace deputy sheriff, tax collector, farmer, storekeeper, timekeeper for the railroad, and carpenter. It is not know when or where Charles Ingalls learned to play the fiddle, but it was his stories, his songs and his memory that Wilder wanted to honor in the Little House books. Charles Ingalls’ wanderlust led the family from Wisconsin to Indian Territory, Minnesota, Iowa, and Dakota Territory. It was in Dakota that Charles Ingalls agreed to settle permanently, homesteading and making final proof on a quarter section, but ultimately settling down in the town of De Smet, in a house he built on Third Street in 1888.\n\nCharles Ingalls died in De Smet, South Dakota, on June 8, 1902, and was buried in the De Smet cemetery.
