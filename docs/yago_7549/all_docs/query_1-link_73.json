        "text": "The little house in the prairie … I recently watched it again on tv and many childhood memories came back … A few years ago I read her biography and wanted to write a blog about her.\n\nYouth\n\nLaura Elisabeth Ingalls Wilder was born on 7 February 1867 as the daughter of the American pioneers Caroline and Charles Ingalls. She traveled with her parents to Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa and South Dakota by wagon. Her father often built a house when they arrived at a new destination. Now there are replicas of those houses in those places.\n\nEventually the family stayed in De Smet (South Dakota). There, Almanzo Wilder and Laura Ingalls courted and she married him on August 25, 1885. On December 5, 1886 their daughter Rose was born. In August 1889 they had another son, who died after a few days. The Wilder family left for Florida. However, this stay was short, after a few months they returned to De Smet. In 1894 they left for Missouri for good. In Mansfield, Missouri is the house where she lived with her husband for the rest of her life.\n\nTheir daughter Rose became a writer. To what extent her mother has influenced her is not clear, but Laura later reclaimed her childhood memories. This eventually resulted in ten books (the series “The Little House”), which are strongly autobiographical. Laura is best known for the television series, the Little House in the prairie, based on her books. But to what extent did the series correspond to reality?\n\nThe tv show versus reality\n\nThe Ingalls family\n\nAs in the series, the Ingalls family consisted of father Charles, mother Caroline, daughters Mary, Laura, Carrie and Grace. There was a son, Freddy, but he died at a very young age. This also came back in the series. However, the characters Albert, Cassandra & James are made up.\n\nMary never married Adam Kendall\n\nAt the age of 14 Mary became seriously ill (probably meningitis) and she became blind. In 1881 the Dakota Territory paid for Mary’s education at the Iowa School for the Blind in Vinton (now known as the Iowa Braille and Visually Impaired School). She graduated in 1889 and went back to De Smet to live with her parents and therefore never married. Afterwards Mary lived with Grace and her husband in Keystone South Dakota until her death on October 17, 1928.\n\nNellie consists of a couple of girls\n\nThe character of Nellie in the books was probably created by combining the character of three different girls: Nellie Owens (she had a brother Willie and her parents run a local store in Walnut Grove), Genevieve Masters (pampered daughter of Laura’s teacher in Walnut Grove, Genny wore beautiful clothes and beautiful blond curls) and Stella Gilbert (she had her eyes on Almanzo).\n\nDid you know that…\n\n1)… Shannen Doherty, especially known for Beverly Hills 90210 and Charmed, had a permanent role in the Little House?\n\nShe played the niece of Almanzo, Jenny Wilder, who eventually comes to live with Laura & Almonzo. Her character never existed.\n\n2)… there were several brothers and sisters on the set of the series?\n\nMelissa Gilbert (Laura Ingalls) is the sister of Jonathon Gilbert (Willie Oleson). Matthew Laborteaux (Albert Ingalls) is the adopted brother of Patrick Laborteaux (Andrew Garvey). The role of Carrie was also played by twins Lindsay & Sidney Greenbush and the role of Grace by Wendi Turnbaugh & Brenda Turnbaugh.\n\n3)… behind the scenes Melissa Gilbert (Laura Ingalls) and Alison Arngrim (Nellie Oleson) were best friends?\n\n4)… in the movie, Little House: The Last Farewell (1984), the village of Walnut Grove really is blown up?\n\nMichael Landon could not accept that bulldozers would destroy the set, so he wrote a storyline where it would be blown up by the residents of Walnut Grove themselves. The Ingalls’ house did not explode at the time. This was eventually destroyed by a fire in 2003.\n\nTrue or false, as a child I enjoyed this series intensely and I now own all DVDs. So once in a while … I watch the DVD …\n\nLaura Ingalls Wilder, a biography\n\nby William Anderson\n\nHere is also a nice video about the series:"
