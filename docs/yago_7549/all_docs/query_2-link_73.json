        "text": "One of the stations is showing a Little House marathon this entire week.\n\nWhat was up with Katherine MacGregor? People bitch about Bonnie Franklin, but MacGregor takes scenery chewing to a different level. Did she think she was doing Noel Coward?\n\nThis was pre-new deal period. The kids not only survived, even the one that was disabled blind, they thrived. The kids were literate. Laura Ingals, one of his girls, wrote one of the most successful family/YA novels in American Literary History.\n\nThe novel was so successful that a century later, it was adapted for a TV series. Which is the only reason you know about it OP because you ain't well read, right?\n\nMa probably married Pa without realizing he was a poor financial risk, women married too young in those days and had little financial education, beyond being shown how to keep the household accounts.\n\nAnd once they were married, her only option other than staying was to leave and go back to her parents, knowing she could never marry again until he died because divorce was either illegal of impossible. So in those days, if the husband wanted to haul out to the Frontier and fuck up being a dirt farmer, she went if he'd take her. Some wives and children were left behind until Pa made his pile out west or gave it up, usually with no money sent to support them. No, women didnt have as lot of good options, if Pa wanted to abandon civilization.\n\nEven if Ma came from money, well, many families wouldnt help a daughter who married badly, and many husbands would refuse to accept \"help\" from his in-laws as he'd consider his manly pride to be more important than the welfare of his wife and kids. So in the 19th century it was common enough to see a woman from a well-to-do family being reduced to poverty by a husband who made bad financial decisions, and the wife staying because she didnt have any better options.\n\nI hope she at least got some good dick out if that marriage, because it didnt sound like she got anything else.\n\n\"There was really no such thing as a “middle class” at that time.\"\n\nThere was a large middle class in civilized areas during the 19th century , the professionals and clerks and shopkeepers and so on. There would be a fairly small middle class out in the frontier but it'd exist, there would be the doctors, shopkeepers and business owners, ministers, schoolteachers, and so on... basically anyone with a high school education and a job that didn't involve physical contact with dirt.\n\nWhat you didn't find out on the frontier was an upper class, you'd just have people who were the richest family in town, or the owner of the largest local employer. Those people thought they were upper class, but they weren't really wealthy or well-connected. They were just the richest person for hundreds of empty miles.\n\nPa was one of those dreamers who thought that moving would solve his problems. Every time he started to get ahead a bit, some disaster like a plague of locusts or a fire would happen. They didn’t have any support back then from government agencies and the same government was lying to people about how great the frontier was, so that they could wrest it from the Natives. Finally in Dakota, the family had some stability. I’m sure Ma was pissed at him a lot for dragging them from pillar to post.\n\nReading the Little House series as an adult is pretty eye-opening (I read it multiple times as a girl).\n\nTeaching in that era - Jesus. The new teacher who borrowed the bull whip so he could defend himself against the group of thugs, farmers' sons, who most likely murdered the instructor before him. And poor Laura, who was made to become a teacher, even though she hated it, to pay for Mary to go to the school for the blind.\n\nAnd, I think it was little Carrie, who was devastated when Mary left to go to school. Mary's one job was taking care of her, and I'm sure she was the mother figure in Carrie's life, so to have her leave suddenly would have been traumatic.\n\nIt seemed like Pa was allergic to people and always wanted to be on untamed land. All well and good if it's just you, but dragging a wife and kids into these dangerous places was crazy, though not uncommon then. It's just what you did. The one prop I'll give Pa is that he seemed to get Laura in a way her mother could not. I think they were very alike in some ways.\n\nIt's true, the kids of the rural poor rarely finished high school, if high school was available in their area at all. The teacher of the one-room schoolhouse may have had only a high school education themselves, and well, if the kids were going to be a farmer or a farmer's wife what was the point? They didn't need school to know how to plow and harvest, and quitting school to work full-time on the farm made you a grownup of a sort, and probably made life easier in the short term. A kid who just worked the farm could put his or her feet up at the end of a long work day, while a farm kid who stayed in school had to do their chores before and after school, pitch in with extra work when needed, and then sit down to homework while Pa put his feet up.\n\nGoing to college, of course, was incredibly difficult for a frontier kid. Even if they got a scholarship and didn't have to find a way to pay, there weren't any colleges out on the wild frontier, and travel was so expensive that it was a barrier to higher education. Hell, people could go decades without seeing the brothers and sisters and parents they left behind east of the Mississippi, because they couldn't afford the trip, or the time away from their business, ranch, or farm.\n\nR99 One of the things about homesteading was proof that you were going to be on the land permanently and to claim it you needed to plant apple or peach orchards within three years to show you were invested. This is where Johnny Appleseed came in. He was an advance man who would plant seeds on the edge of the frontier and sell saplings to new arrivals making land claims. Because it took ten plus years for the trees to bear fruit it proved that they were invested in being there. Of course the apples had nothing to do with what we eat today, they were used to make cider, which was needed because the water may not be drinkable without the alcoholic content of cider to make it so. Also, the cider press process would then provided Johnny with all the free seeds he needed to go forth and plant a new round of saplings further west.\n\nOp, that's how I felt after reading the books. I never watched the TV show, but I read all the books including Farmer's Boy about the childhood of Ingall's husband.\n\nMy feeling about Mr. Ingalls was that he was a charming man, singing and fiddle playing while chasing dreams that never worked out. Locusts, floods, illness and other calamities would cause them to move again and again. Ma and Pa Ingalls finally settled in a small town after giving up on farming. Laura was the big success in the family, basing her books on their pioneer life. Her early life was charming, the family parties when they still lived near kin. But, as many also stated on this thread, pioneer times were tough for many families, and death was a frequent event on their nomadic travels.\n\nMacGregor's performance reminded me of the mother on Malcolm In the Middle: A reminder that this is from the perspective of a child, and the yelling adults seem like ogres. I loved Mrs. Oleson's voice. She had that plaintive tone and was so self-righteous and self-pitying. I loved her character and I loved how accurately she portrayed an asshole. A fine counterpoint to dear Caroline, whom I also loved and thought was stunningly beautiful.\n\nAs for Pa: He tried. It looked like a shitty life. I don't think the show could have enjoyed the success it did if it had been more faithful to the books.\n\nR115, Almanzo came from a relatively well-off family but struck out to make his own way on the frontier. It went well enough until bad luck struck. He and Laura had diphtheria, their first home burned to the ground (for which he'd secretly gone into debt), crops failed, and then he had a stroke that left him partially paralyzed, making physical labor very hard. It took them decades to establish a stable living for themselves.\n\nAnyone interested in their real story (not including Pa's big dick) and the historical background should read Prairie Fires.\n\nR162 is right...Prairie Fires is a great read that shows the contrast between reality and the LH books. Pa was all over the place and kept investing time and money in places, only to end up abandoning them to move on to some other place. The family was poor, and the settlers were caught up in the government’s battle with the Native American population over land. They were constantly sick and had their crops destroyed by swarms of grasshoppers repeatedly (this was mentioned in the book, but it wasn’t a one-time thing and then, as now, the government was not very generous in bailing out the poor in a disaster). It was a hard life and the kids were along for the ride.\n\nThe Charles Ingalls family died out. Mary never married. Laura had her daughter Rose and her son that died within weeks of birth. Rose married and had a son that was either stillborn or died shortly after birth, and then never had other children. Carrie didn't get married until she was her in her 40s. She married an older widower with two kids, but never had her own. Charles Frederick died at about a year old. Grace married a much older man as well and never had kids.\n\nIf you read the original manuscript, \"Pioneer Girl\" it's clear that Laura did not have the best education and Rose did a lot of editing and rewriting to make the Little House series. I found the books to be so boring compared to the series. If they stuck to the books for the TV show, they never would have been renewed after the first season.\n\nAlmanzo was also loser who made very bad choices. Most girls marry their fathers, don't they? Even in an interview with Rose he said, \"my life has been mostly disappointments.\"\n\nThe one interesting thing in the Pioneer Girl book...Laura talks about an attempted rape when she was a teenager. She was apparently taking care of a sick neighbor with a seizure disorder. While she was sleeping, the neighbor's husband came into the bedroom and told Laura to keep quiet and lie still. She screamed and never went back.\n\nThe reason I preferred the books to the TV show was all the descriptions of food, people, environment, etc. They were expressive and did a good job at setting the scene. Even knowing how idealized they are now, I still appreciate the books for that reason.\n\nThe show seemed silly to me and even as a kid I felt a little bit like it was an oversimplification.\n\nR177, the right-wing libertarian stuff came later when Laura's books were successful, and I think mostly from her daughter.\n\nR190, Laura was quite pretty and obviously a good catch--she basically supported her family while Pa continued failing.\n\nR192, aren't American homes still horribly built? It's crazy to me that my parents huge home has one heating/cooling control for the whole house.\n\nR195, miscarriages, infant/child death, and women dying as a result of childbirth were commonplace until the medical advances of the 20th century.\n\nI know this is likely to be unpopular opinion, since we all have to rail at the SJWs, but I really like how they’ve been handling this reevaluate of the Little House books.\n\nNo one has insisted that she be canceled, just considered more fully. They did take her name off an award, which I honestly think is reasonable given that the World Fantasy Award did the same with Lovecraft.\n\nMedical care on the frontier ranged from basic to nonexistent. If there was a doctor in town, a farmer who needed medical care for one of his children could ride into town and hope his wife could keep the kid alive while he was gone, and he'd be gone for hours going to town and back and the doctor would come when he could make the trip. When the doctor arrived he had no antibiotics, oxygen, antivirals, he could set broken limbs or maybe remove an appendix on the kitchen table (without anesthetics) and give the patient a slug of laudanum to get them through, but that was about it, and the doctor needed paying in cash or eggs or firewood. There weren't any hospitals out on the frontier, if a person needed major surgery to remove a tumor or save their sight or whatever, that meant a trip to a \"city\" and debt the family would never be able to pay because there was no medical insurance, so it was routine for people to die or go disabled because the family couldn't afford treatment.\n\nThe country doctors were nearly as poor as the people they treated, for all their education and college degrees, and were probably owed money by every poor family in their territory. Which is why some of the medical schools that produced poor country doctors started admitting women towards the end of the 19th century (I read a biography of such a female country doctor), they couldn't get enough men to sign up for such a gruelling, comfortless, thankless lifestyle.\n\nThank you, Wikipedia, I mean R203.\n\nI read a couple of the books and then grew out of it--the detail was lovely. I felt I could see and touch the landscape, the food, etc. Ingalls was very gifted. I think she wrote too many books and got fucked up in later life, just like so many on DL. (minus the books)\n\nThank you, Wikipedia, I mean R203.\n\nI read a couple of the books and then grew out of it--the detail was lovely. I felt I could see and touch the landscape, the food, etc. Ingalls was very gifted. I think she wrote too many books and got fucked up in later life, just like so many on DL. (minus the books)\n\nIt really is funny to re-read the LH books as an adult. I never realized when I was a kid that the Ingalls' situation kept getting worse as the books went on. In Little House in the Big Woods, they are portrayed as halfway successful. They have a decent house, good crops, and plenty of food. Also, they are close to family.\n\nBut Pa Ingalls got tired of plowing around stumps and had to move out west. Then everything went to hell.\n\nI recently read Prarie Fires and Pioneer Girl. Each of them make it clear that the Ingalls were really destitute for most of the time during Laura's childhood. She really papered over Pa's failures in the books.\n\nIn her autobiography \"Prairie Tale\", Melissa Gilbert said Michael Landon, and many of the show's crew members, abused alcohol on the set of this show everyday. \"He was always a hard worker and hard drinker\", she writes, \"and he and the crew would regularly have a few drinks of alcohol on the set, which is probably part of why he might have developed pancreatic cancer at such a young age.\" Landon was known to smoke three to four packs of unfiltered cigarettes a day, as well as to notoriously step out on all his wives.\n\nThe proposal in Golden Years must be the coldest in literature.\n\n'Your hand is so small!' Almanzo said. 'How would you like an engagement ring?'\n\n'That would depend on who gave it to me', Laura answered.\n\n'And if it was me?'\n\n'Then it would depend on the ring.' Laura drew her hand away.\n\n[QUOTE] In The Long Winter, he's constantly going to the general store to eat, while his wife and children are starving.\n\nAlmanzo and his brother are described as eating about 30 pancakes each with molasses and bacon while the whole of De Smet (ugliest town name ever) is starving. They invite Pa to eat and instead of wrapping some up for his family, Pa wolfs down a stack of 12!\n\nAlmanzo comes across as quite selfish too. He forces a local homesteader to sell all his seed wheat so that Almanzo doesn't have to sell his. He keeps his in a secret compartment in the wall, but Pa realises it's there and helps himself to a few pails of grain.\n\n[QUOTE] And, I think it was little Carrie, who was devastated when Mary left to go to school. Mary's one job was taking care of her, and I'm sure she was the mother figure in Carrie's life, so to have her leave suddenly would have been traumatic.\n\nThe youngest was Grace, not Carrie. Carrie was ten when Mary left home.\n\nI got annoyed at Pa for taking Laura's teaching pay (about 80 dollars) and persuading her to spend it on an organ for Mary to play when she came home in vacations, when Laura had no use for an organ but loved horses and would have much preferred to buy a pony. After she married Almanzo, she went horse crazy.\n\nWhat did you expect a pioneer in those days in that location to do? Go to Yale Law School? It was a time like these times are becoming. A few extremely rich people and a whole lot of poor people. I'm sure he was making the most of the opportunities he was given. And he was a loving father and good husband, a good, honest man, whose family loved him, so how is that a loser?"
