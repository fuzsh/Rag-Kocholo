        "text": "From: https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/LCFC-7LQ\n\nDEATH: Obituary for Charles Philip Ingalls A Pioneer Gone.\n\nThe People of De Smet were pained Sunday afternoon to learn of the death of Mr. C.P. Ingalls, who died at 3 p.m. of that day after a lingering illness of several weeks. Heart trouble was the cause of his death. Funeral services were held at the Congregational Church Tuesday forenoon, largely attended by the many friends of the deceased and of the family. After the church services were concluded the masonic fraternity who were in attendance in body took charge of the funeral and the remains were placed in their last resting place with solemn funeral rite of that organization.\n\nDEATH: Chas. P. Ingalls was born in that state 60 years ago. His life was that of a pioneer from boyhood. At the age of 12 years he moved with his parents to Illinois, thence a few years later to Wisconsin and thence to Minnesota. It was while living in Wisconsin that he married the esteemable lady who is now his widow.\n\nDEATH: In 1879 he brought his family to De Smet. He was the first to build a dwelling in this locality; the house which now stands on the rear of the Bank of De Smet lot is the building. In his home were held the first religious services. He was prominent in the work of organizing the Congregational Church of this city which he was faithful and consistent member to his death DEATH: As a citizen he held high esteem, being honest and upright in his dealings and associations with his fellows. As a friend and neighbor he was always kind and courteous, and a faithful and loving husband and father.\n\nBIOGRAPHY: Charles Phillip Ingalls, known in Laura's books as \"Pa\", was born January 10, 1836, in Cuba, New York, to Landsford and Laura Ingalls (the Grandpa and Grandma of Little House in the Big Woods). He married Caroline Quiner on February 1, 1860, and had five children. Laura portrayed Pa as a man who wanted only the best for his family, but things never turned out the way he hoped.The family moved many times during Laura's childhood due to Pa's \"itching foot\" which always wanted to go west. Pa often referred to himself as a carpenter, though at various times he was a hunter, trapper, farmer, hotel manager, butcher, Justice of the Peace, and storekeeper as well.\n\nBIOGRAPHY: Pa died in De Smet, South Dakota, on June 8, 1902, but the charm of his stories and the music of his fiddle lives on in Laura's books and in the hearts of those who love them. BIOGRAPHY: Today, Pa's fiddle is on display in Mansfield, Missouri.\n\nModified\n\n27 August 2013 by brohde2747027\n\nDeath: Jun. 8, 1902 De Smet Kingsbury County South Dakota, USA\n\nLiterary Figure. Born the second of nine children of Landsford and Laura Ingalls in Cuba, New York, when he was 12 his family moved to Illinois, and then to Wisconsin. He married Caroline Lake Quiner in February of 1860 and with her, headed west in what would become a long string of moves which indulged his wanderlust, his dislike of large towns, and the prevailing job opportunities. The young family moved from Wisconsin, to Kansas, back to Wisconsin, to Minnesota, to Iowa, back to Minnesota, and finally to Dakota Territory in 1879 where, among other occupations, he was appointed Justice of the Peace of De Smet. The Ingalls' had five children; Mary, Laura, Carrie, Charles Frederick, and Grace. It was daughter Laura who immortalized her family in the popular ‘Little House' series of books. Ingalls died in his home at the age of 66 after an illness of several weeks led to heart failure.
