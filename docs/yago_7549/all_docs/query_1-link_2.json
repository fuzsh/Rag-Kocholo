        "text": "American schoolteacher (1839–1924\n\nCaroline Lake Ingalls ( ; née Quiner (later Holbrook); December 12, 1839 – April 20, 1924) was an American schoolteacher who was the mother of Laura Ingalls Wilder, author of the Little House books. She is depicted as the character \"Ma\" in the books and the television series.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nChildhood\n\n[edit]\n\nCaroline was born 15 miles west of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the Town of Brookfield, Waukesha County.[1] She was the fifth of seven children of Henry and Charlotte Quiner. Her brothers were Joseph, Henry, and Thomas, and her sisters were Martha, and Eliza. (The Quiners' first child, Martha Morse Quiner, died in 1836.)\n\nWhen Caroline was 5, her father died while serving as second mate on a ship that capsized and sank on Lake Michigan near the Straits of Mackinac. There were no survivors. In 1849, her mother married farmer Frederick Holbrook. They had one child together, Lottie Holbrook. Caroline evidently loved and respected her new father, and would later honor his memory by naming her son after him.[2] At the age of 16 1/2, Caroline started working as a teacher.\n\nMarriage\n\n[edit]\n\nOn February 1, 1860, she married Charles Phillip Ingalls in Concord, Wisconsin.[3] Together they had five children: Mary Amelia, Laura Elizabeth, Caroline Celestia (Carrie), Charles Frederick (Freddie), and Grace Pearl.[4][5]\n\nFreddie Ingalls\n\n[edit]\n\nCharles Frederick \"Freddie\" Ingalls was born on November 1, 1875, in Walnut Grove, Minnesota, and died August 27, 1876, in South Troy, Minnesota, of indeterminate causes.\n\nIn her autobiography Pioneer Girl,[6] Laura remembers that \"Little Brother was not well\" and that \"one terrible day, he straightened out his little body and was dead\". Wilder scholar William Anderson noted: \"Nearly forty years after Freddie's death, Ma mourned him, telling relatives how different everything would be 'if Freddie had lived'.\"[7]\n\nTravels and later years\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Ingalls family traveled by covered wagon from Wisconsin; Kansas (Indian Territory); Burr Oak, Iowa; and Minnesota. In 1879, they settled in De Smet in Dakota Territory.\n\nAfter arriving in De Smet, Caroline and the Ingalls family lived in the home of the local surveyor as well as a store in the downtown area, before homesteading just outside town on a farm by Silver Lake. When the Ingalls family sold the farm due to a persistent pattern of dry years, Charles built a home for them on Third Street in De Smet, known later as \"The House That Pa Built\".[8] Following her husband's death from heart disease in 1902 at age 66, Ingalls and her oldest daughter, Mary, rented one of the rooms for extra income. Following a long illness, Caroline Ingalls died on April 20, 1924, at the age of 84.\n\nIn the media\n\n[edit]\n\nThe fictional series The Caroline Years, an extension of the Little House series, by Maria D. Wilkes and Celia Wilkins, follows Caroline Holbrook from her fifth year to her late teens, up to her engagement to Charles. The first title in the series is Little House in Brookfield.[9]\n\nThe novel Caroline: Little House, Revisited by Sarah Miller follows the Ingalls family move from Pepin, Wisconsin to Kansas Territory from the viewpoint of Caroline.[10] The novel was authorized by the Little House Heritage Trust.\n\nCaroline Ingalls has been portrayed in the adaptations of Little House on the Prairie by:\n\nKaren Grassle in the television series Little House on the Prairie and its movie sequels\n\nLindsay Crouse in television films Beyond the Prairie: The True Story of Laura Ingalls Wilder\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nRobynne Elizabeth Miller (2015).
