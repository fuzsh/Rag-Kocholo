        "text": "When Laura married Almanzo Wilder and moved to Missouri, Carrie felt obligated to help the family afford to put her older sister Mary in the College for the Blind in Iowa. Carrie wanted to follow in the footsteps of her older sister, Laura, and be a school teacher. Carrie studied hard and passed her teacher’s examination and she did teach school for a short time, but it wasn’t really what she wanted to do.\n\nAt nineteen years of age, Carrie was an apprentice on the Leader staff, the town’s weekly newspaper. She learned all aspects of the newspaper business. The Leader was eventually combined with the De Smet News and she may have worked for the rival Kingsbury Independent. Carrie worked in the newspaper business for about five years in De Smet. She also clerked in stores, did substitute teaching and worked in the Post Office. At thirty-five years of age, Carrie went to Boulder, Colorado in search of a climate that would clear her sinus and asthma problems. No doubt, she worked in Colorado and moved on to Wyoming where she may have worked for a newspaper.\n\nDuring that time, Carrie became a landowner. The U.S. government opened various Indian lands to white settlers. Lucky white men and women would win the right to homestead in the Indian lands by lottery. Carrie decided to throw her name into the hat and she won. The homestead claim was near the town of Topbar north of Philip, South Dakota. She lived in a tiny tar-paper shanty which was typical of that day, living on the homestead for at least six months each year and the remainder of the time in De Smet.\n\nCarrie would eventually meet E. L. Senn who was known as the “Final Proof King of South Dakota.” It was reported that Senn owned as many as fifty-one newspapers in South Dakota. Fundamentally, Senn made his money because each homesteader had to file final proof sheets for five consecutive weeks. According to a government ruling, such newspapers were to be paid five dollars by the landholder for each final proof published, and any contestant to a settler’s right to the land must pay a publication fee. Carrie first worked for E.L. Senn in the town of Pedro, not too far from her claim. By the summer of 1909, Carrie was the manager working for Senn at the Pedro Bugle.\n\nPedro was the original camp of Chief Big Foot on the Cheyenne River. Big Foot and his band were driven out of their camp and eventually met their demise when they were slaughtered at Wounded Knee on December 29, 1890. Pedro once boasted a population of 300 and was a popular crossing on the Cheyenne River. Pedro is no longer on the map and is a real ghost town, occupied today by a few ranchers.\n\nAs Pedro began to fade, Carrie was transferred to the Roseland Review at Roseland, South Dakota in 1910. At this time, Carrie was 40 years of age, a seasoned newspaperwoman, and she had never been married. By now, E.L. Senn had settled in Deadwood, South Dakota, a mining town dominated by gamblers and prostitutes. Senn had discovered something else in the mining community; mines fell under the same legal regulations as homesteads. Mining claims had to be advertised and those contesting the ownership of mines had to publish legal challenges. It was fertile ground for more cash. Senn began acquiring newspapers in mining areas and he sent Carrie ahead to run them."
