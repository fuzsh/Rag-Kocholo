        "text": "Hello,\n\nI just spent about two and a half hours reading this whole thread. Wow. Just, wow!\n\nI've always wondered what was the real reason the Ingalls kept moving? In those days you were tied to the land. You couldn't apply online to Amazon then get an interview and move. If the resources on your land was depleted, you went to look for economic oppurtunity elsewhere, such as better land.\n\nI grew up with the tv show, then just read the books as an adult a few years ago. Still, I thought, well, the Great Plains were tough when they were first settled. The native grasslands were never farmed before. There was no resources to help the settlers establish their homesteads. I thought the mistake the Ingalls made was they just moved around a relatively small geographic area. If they would of went to Oregon or California, that's farm heaven, much milder climate, more natural resources than the Great Plains. I made excuses for them.\n\nBut reading the \"in between the lines stuff\", it's piecing together. The Ingalls family was definitely a few clowns short of a circus. They could fill an entire season of \"The Jerry Springer Show!\" All of the sneaking out in the middle of the night, leaving behind debts, Charles feeding his face in TLW while his family is starving. Ohhh, if I was Ma I would have busted his head with a iron skillet if I found out. Laura working like a team horse to send Mary to college. I can see going to a school for the blind to learn independant living skills, but seven years???? And Ma did seem a bit \"off.\" Needless to say, I got Pioneer Girl on order. Thanks for the tip. Yeah, if you're poor white trash, all the vineyards in California won't help you if you're sneaking off in the middle of the night to avoid bill collectors.\n\nI read later that Laura's relationship to her family was \"strained.\" I thought why, they were the \"perfect\" family. No wonder, in reality they were a bunch of freaks.\n\nThank God Michael Landon was perfect. Just kidding! <ducking>\n\nSerious though, if Landon knew the backstory to the books, or he and Ed Friendly were able to \"read in between the lines\" I can understand why Landon made the show with the \"perfect\" Ingalls family. How could he make a tv show last nine seasons with a bunch of dysfunctional nutcases? My childhood and adult work ethic was formed by \"Little House on the Prairie\". Well, thank you Michael, for what you did.\n\nI still like the history though. LIW is an incredibly strong person to survive the harsh life of a pioneer. Her family tried but they certainly are no saints. Still good children's book, as the darker stuff will go right over their heads. But as an adult, you just sit there and say \"wow!\"\n\nI know this thread has been dormant for ages so no one will likely see this, but as a LIW-phile, I had to chime in about the constant griping (here and on other forums that discuss LIW/the LHoTP books) about Pa eating pancakes with the Wilder brothers during the long winter. I have re-read the series (and Pioneer Girl as well) several times as an adult and I definitely have come to see that Charles Ingalls made many, many stupid decisions over the years that did not help his family at all, but the fact that so many people get angry over him eating with the Wilders in TLW and call his decision \"greedy\", \"selfish\", \"atrocious\", etc. kind of boggles my mind.\n\nHave all those people read the book more than once? It was obvious that Pa was the only member of the family that still had any kind of an appetite left after months of the same endless, boring diet, because he was not only sharing in the active chores that the others in the family were doing (grinding wheat, twisting hay), but was also struggling through the blizzards each morning and night to do the farm chores, and, on top of that, doing extremely demanding work dragging his poor horse through breaking snow hills to bring back enough hay to get them through to the next blizzard in between storms. Of course, the women in the family were also starving and would have been thrilled to see a steaming plate of pancakes and ham, but even if Pa had brought the food home (another issue, which I will address in a minute), I am completely certain that Ma and the girls would have either urged Pa to eat it all himself or would have given him the vast majority of the food, not because \"proper ladies wouldn't begrudge a man food\" (as someone said upthread), but because they a) knew he needed it more to keep up the very limited strength he had to haul hay and keep the farm animals alive and b) probably would not have been able to eat more than a mouthful or two themselves because the rich food, after a very scanty and limited diet and minimal physical exercise for months on end, would not have been easy to digest. As for Pa being \"greedy\" by then coming home and eating his full share of food there after eating heartily with the Wilders, I think it is mentioned several times in the book that any time anyone tried to give up extra food for Pa or didn't want to eat their fair share, he was very firm about making sure they ate their fair share. If he had offered extra food to the girls or to his wife, they would almost certainly have refused first because a) they felt, logically, that he deserved his fair share and if possible, the largest share of food given the extra physical work he had to face and b) Laura mentioned many times that even though they were, technically, starving, they didn't really feel hungry because they were so weak, listless, and bored of the same repetitive diet.\n\nAs for the people who keep mentioning how awful it was for Pa to not bring the extra food home to his family... how would that have worked, exactly?? If you went to visit a neighbour and that neighbour offered you a cup of tea and some cookies, would you pour the cup of tea into your thermos and wrap the cookies up in a napkin to take them home to your family? It would be considered extremely strange and rude to do so, because the food was offered to you as part of the social connection you are making with your neighbour, not as a take-home gift. The Wilders invited Pa to eat with them as part of their social visit - sharing a meal or offering food to visitors was a normal and polite social activity that they were able to luckily maintain even given the terrible weather circumstances, and so they were glad to extend that courtesy to Pa when he visited. If he had said \"No, thank you, I have to leave now and go home to my family, but I'll just take that food you offered me 'to go'\", that would not have been socially acceptable in any way. Even if you were to say \"Screw social conventions! His family was starving and he saw available food; he should have humbled his pride and asked for some to take home!\", that would not really have worked, either, because while the Wilders had enough pancakes/extra food to feed one extra person (Pa), it did not mean they had enough to send home for a family of six. Also, would they then be responsible to give out pancakes and ham to other starving families when they came to Royal's shop, too?\n\nPa was lucky that he was able to buy wheat from the Wilders even though Almanzo was determined not to sell it, and he was lucky that the brothers were hospitable enough to not get angry over him barging in to essentially steal the wheat they'd been hiding and offer him a visit and a meal instead. He took advantage of the meal, as anyone in his situation would, but he put providing for his family by convincing them to sell him the wheat first. If they had denied him the wheat that would essentially keep his family alive for a few more days, I don't think he would have then sat down and said, \"Oh, well, I guess I might as well eat some of your pancakes anyhow before I go home and tell Caroline that we're entirely out of food with no hope of getting anymore since the secret wheat stash turned out to be owned by a stingy teenager.\"\n\nOn 12/12/2017 at 3:37 AM, MakingBacon said:\n\nI highly recommend Prairie Fires by Caroline Fraser. It spends a little too much time on Rose Wilder Lane but I understand she was important in getting Laura’s books written and published. What’s interesting is that it reflects that the Ingalls family were never really able to raise themselves out of poverty. Laura did it but not until she was elderly. We learn so much more about Laura’s time in Mansfield before the books. It also made me realize how much I dislike Rose. I emphathize with her battle with depression but that’s as far as I go as to giving her any type of leeway. The book makes her seem like a thoroughly unlikeable person.\n\nI’ve just read this book. I found it interesting that the first thing Fraser does is mention that when Ma died, Laura had not seen her for twenty years (since Pa’s funeral) and later seems to think there is nothing in this. I totally disagree. Twenty years is a lifetime and had she really wanted to, Laura could easily have visited her Mother and Mary, I have always thought that something happened or was said at the time of Pa’s death and funeral. He did die quite young (in his 60s) and I’ve long wondered whether Ma (in her grief or otherwise) took it out on Laura, blaming her. After all, when Laura left home to marry, the Ingalls family lost their hard worker and money earner. They relied on Laura for all the help, be it financial or physical. It’s very telling that after she married, Pa had to sell the Homestead, just as they had turned it into a “real home”. We know Ma didn’t like Almanzo (“I do believe he wants to break your neck and I hope he breaks his own first”). When she first sees Laura with him beside her and stands “petrified”.....well of what? Easy....of the idea of her daughter, on who they rely so heavily, being carried off by some man instead of staying home forever, teaching, sewing, doing all the chores etc. I think once Laura had left they just couldn’t cope, hence the sale of the Homestead, and when Pa died (from heart complications, probably brought on by years of poor nutrition, (they lived on a horrendously imbalanced diet at times), exhausting work, poverty, failures etc, Ma had to face a future of coping with a blind daughter and managing alone. I always wondered if she said something to Laura along the lines of ‘If you hadn’t left and married that man, and had stayed here to help, Pa wouldn’t be dead now’. I can just hear her saying it. People say stuff in grief. But whatever happened, after that funeral, Laura never saw her Mother or Mary again. Speaks volumes!! As does the fact she didn’t attend their funerals.\n\nEdited December 18, 2017 by Dee03"
