        "text": "Did you know India’s vast railway network is also a treasure trove of mysterious tales and ghostly encounters? Here are five haunted railway stations in India that you must know.\n\nThis haunted station in Maharashtra is popular for its ghostly apparition of a weeping woman. According to the locals, they have encountered a distressed female spirit, believed to be the victim of a fatal accident at the station.\n\nThis station in Andhra Pradesh is said to be haunted by the restless spirit of CRPF constable Hari Singh. According to a 2015 report by The Hindu, Singh met a tragic end after being attacked by RPF personnel and TTEs on a train in 2013.\n\nThe Barog Railway Station is named after Colonel Barog, a British engineer who took his own life near Tunnel No 33 after facing humiliation for a construction miscalculation. Locals suggest that the colonel’s spirit still lingers, engaging in friendly conversations with unsuspecting visitors.\n\nThe Naini Railway Station in Uttar Pradesh is another haunted station in India. Residents report sightings of the spirits of political revolutionaries and freedom fighters who were once imprisoned and tortured in the nearby jail."
