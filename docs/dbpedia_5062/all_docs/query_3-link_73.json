        "text": "Hello I have booked an auto from ola on 6 aug2024 at 8.55 pm with a driver named M Raju CNR NUMBER IS 857119**** and automatic driver contact number is +91 9019* ***29, and the issue is auto broke down in a mid way in the middle of flyover and there was raining and auto was leaking also in the whole way and auto broke down in the mid way thrice and atlast it didn't start only and I had my bus booked and was waiting at the stop it was already 45 min of my ride still I was completed 30% of my way and I tried to book in ola but as I was in mid of flyover it couldn't possible and driver didn't try to do anything and then some other auto guy come who didn't had ola or online payment or anything even smart phone ,I had no choice but go take that auto but he was asking 250rs and my rider Raju from ola also demanded whole money that was shown in app even though he stopped mid way I didn't left with choice but have to pay him also and also to another driver ,it was too disappointment that ola didn't had proper customer support,as auto stopped the second time I tried for customer support but until my ride ends there was no option for that even now after rice they just took as a feedback no acknowledgement no resolution and no refund I paid triple the original amount and even missed my bus and bus money also gone ,it's a huge loss for me ,I hope ola support looks into the issue and provide the helpful support and resolution otherwise I didn't left with any other option than filing the official complaint or even in consumer court ,it was my safety issue what if that driver tried to kidnap or fraud me no proper support provided from you guys ,even I tried complaining in app it just took as feedback no acknowledgement,I except apology and resolution refund within 12 hours or else tomorrow I am gonna complaint in consumer court, thank you."
