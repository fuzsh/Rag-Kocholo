The double-decker flyover, located in Mira-Bhayander, is expected to usher in a huge improvement to the region's transport infrastructure. The inauguration was attended by MLA Pratap Sarnaik, MLA Geeta Jain, and Joint Metropolitan Commissioner Radhabinod Sharma. The double-decker flyover, which extends around one km and rises 5.5 metres above the current road level, is intended to relieve traffic congestion at key intersections such as Pleasant Park, Hatkesh, and Silver Park. The structure can withstand heavy traffic, including multi-axle vehicles, and it meets all applicable regulations. It has modern features including signage and lighting, and its design is influenced by the Metro Red Line, MMRDA said in their communique. This flyover is expected to reduce travel time by 8 to 10 minutes and improve vehicle flow, leading to lower fuel consumption and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, it will help preserve green spaces and reduce noise pollution, the MMRDA added. Construction Challenges and Technology Building this overpass necessitated the relocation of nearly 3 km of the Dahanu-Versova power generation line. The power line was raised 75 metres above ground, making it the second tallest in Maharashtra. To save construction time and prevent traffic interruptions, advanced technology was deployed, such as I-girder precast parts and the Tyre Straddle Carrier. This strategy enabled continuous traffic movement, which was critical considering that around 800 vehicles pass across this road per hour. Benefits and Impact The double-decker flyover combines road and metro infrastructure to save space and reduce traffic congestion. It also simplifies transfers between modes of transportation, improves city aesthetics, and permits future growth. The project was finished in two years, showcasing effective planning and sophisticated technology, the MMRDA noted in their media statement. Chief Minister Eknath Shinde emphasised the project's importance, noting that it will alleviate traffic congestion, save time and fuel, and speed growth in the Mumbai metropolitan area. Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee, Metropolitan Commissioner of MMRDA, lauded the project as a modern solution to Mumbai's transit demands, promising a faster, safer, and more convenient journey. The Metro Line-9 and its flyovers have also been recognised, with the World Safety Organisation Excellence Award for Workspace Occupational Health and Safety 2024 and the CIDC Vishwakarma Award for Metro Line 9 and its flyovers 2024.\n\n28 August,2024 07:36 PM IST | Mumbai | mid-day online correspondent\n\nPolice issues traffic restrictions for G.S.B.

Ganesh Chaturthi 2024 will be celebrated on September 7. The event, also known as Vinayak Chaturdashi, is distinguished by complex rituals, lively celebrations, and profound spiritual importance. Dates and Timings for Ganesh Chaturthi 2024 Ganesh Chaturthi falls on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the bright fortnight (Shukla Paksha) in the Hindu month of Bhadrapada. In 2024, the festival will begin on September 7 and last for ten days, culminating in Anant Chaturdashi on September 16th, when the statue of Lord Ganesha is submerged in water, signalling the end of the festivities. The most auspicious time to perform the Vinayak Chaturdashi Puja on September 7 is during the Madhyahna hour, which normally lasts from 11:00 AM to 1:30 PM. This period is seen to be auspicious since Lord Ganesha is said to have been born during it. The Significance of Ganesh Chaturthi Millions of Hindus cherish Ganesh Chaturthi. Lord Ganesha, the son of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, is known as the remover of obstacles (Vighnaharta) and the god of intelligence and intellect. Devotees seek his blessings before beginning on new endeavours, making this festival a time for success, peace, and prosperity. The festival's significance stems from its message of unity, cultural legacy, and dedication. It draws communities together to celebrate, overcoming social and economic barriers. The splendour of the event, especially in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, demonstrates a shared spirit of devotion and cultural pride. Rituals of Ganesh Chaturthi 1. Installation of Ganesha Idol (Pranapratishtha): The festivities begin with the placement of a clay idol of Lord Ganesha in houses, temples, and public pandals (temporary constructions). This ceremony, known as Pranapratishtha, includes evoking the deity's presence within the idol. Devotees then give prayers and rituals to bring the statue to life, symbolising Lord Ganesha's presence. 2. Pujas & Offerings: Throughout the 10-day festival, devotees conduct daily pujas (worship) with devotion and reverence. The ceremonies involve chanting Vedic hymns, reciting the Ganapati Atharvashirsha, and offering goods such as modaks (sweet dumplings), coconut, jaggery, durva grass, and red flowers, all of which are popular with Lord Ganesha. 3. Aarti and Bhajans: In the morning and evening, aartis (light rituals) are conducted to honour Lord Ganesha. Devotees demonstrate their devotion by singing bhajans and performing dances. The atmosphere is filled with the joyful sound of drums, cymbals, and chants of \"Ganpati Bappa Morya,\" which invoke Lord Ganesha's blessings and protection. 4. Visarjan (Immersion): On the final day, Anant Chaturdashi, Lord Ganesha's idol, is paraded in a spectacular procession and immersed (Visarjan) in a nearby body of water. This ceremony represents the cycle of creation and disintegration, with Lord Ganesha returning to his celestial dwelling and removing the impediments and misfortunes of his devotees.\n\n28 August,2024 05:10 PM IST | Mumbai | mid-day online correspondent\n\nMumbai Police issues traffic advisory for motorists in BKC from August 28 to 30\n\nMumbai Police on Wednesday have issued an advisory for motorists ahead of the Global Fintech Fest 2024 scheduled to be held at the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) from August 28 to August 30.

Anil Deshmukh's comments came amid outrage over the alleged Badlapur sexual assault case of two four-year-old girls at a school in Thane district and an attack on a police officer in Pune with a sickle, the news agency reported. \"Under Home Minister Devendra Fadnavis, there is no fear of police in the state. Police are being beaten up openly. There needs to be fear of police among criminals,\" Anil Deshmukh told PTI Video in an interview. The former state home minister demanded that the Centre approve the Maharashtra government's Shakti Law, which prescribes the death penalty for heinous crimes against women, at the earliest. Had this law been in place, crime against women would not have taken place, he claimed. \"They (BJP) have a government at the Centre. The Shakti law has been pending approval (Presidential assent) for the past three years. The law prescribes the strictest punishment, including death penalty, for perpetrators of crimes such as rape. The government, however, doesn't seem to be serious on women's issues at all,\" Anil Deshmukh alleged. Both the House of Maharashtra legislature had passed the Shakti Criminal Laws (Maharashtra Amendment) Bill, 2020, and the Special Court & Machinery for Implementation of Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law, 2020, three years ago when the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) was in power. The former state home minister alleged the state government was using the flagship Mukhyamantri Mazi Ladki Bahin Yojana, which provides a monthly stipend of Rs 1,500 to eligible women, for political mileage to win the upcoming assembly elections, predicting that the scheme would be discontinued. If the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition is voted to power, they would continue this scheme, he said. Anil Deshmukh, who served as home minister when the MVA government was in power, had last month alleged he was pressured by the then opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis to prepare an affidavit implicating the then CM Uddhav Thackeray, deputy CM Ajit Pawar, and ministers Aaditya Thackeray and Anil Parab. Anil Deshmukh had blamed Devendra Fadnavis for his arrest on charges of corruption and money laundering in the past. Anil Deshmukh is currently out on bail.
