        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nLocated on India’s western coast, Mumbai, originally known as Bombay, is a vibrant and busy city. Known as the ‘Financial Capital’ of India, Mumbai is famous for its fast pace of life, tall skyscrapers, lively street markets, and street food. It is home to more than 20 million people with a variety of cultures, traditions, and languages.\n\nThe city offers a fusion of modernity, culture, and history, as evidenced by its famous Marine Drive and other iconic sites such as the Gateway of India. Mumbai is the centre of India’s entertainment industry and home to Bollywood, the well-known Hindi film industry. It is a city that never sleeps and is renowned for its resilience.\n\nMumbai, a city with 20 million population, is continuously experiencing a rising urban population. Due to this, Mumbai faces substantial challenges. The city’s transport infrastructure is under immense pressure from the increasing number of residents and vehicles. The surge in urban population and vehicular traffic has led to congestion and strain on the existing transportation systems.\n\nCondition of Mumbai’s Public Transport\n\nGiven the poor condition of the roads and heavy congestion, public transport is considered the best way to navigate Mumbai. However, the city’s public transport system has struggled to keep up with its rapidly growing population. The overpopulation and rising need for public transport in Mumbai result in overcrowding and road congestion.\n\nMumbai operates over 3,000 trains daily and has a fleet of 12,800 buses. Despite having a good amount of public transport, Mumbai faced difficulties in accommodating its people in public transport. The heavy congestion on roads did not allow buses to reach the suburban areas of the city.\n\nTo address the rising need for public transport in suburban regions, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) initiated the construction of a monorail line. This project aims to expand and enhance Mumbai’s public transport network, providing a much-needed solution to the city’s transportation woes.\n\nKnow About Monorail\n\nThe monorail operates on a narrow, single track that can be positioned either above or beneath the railway cars. In systems where the rail is above the cars, wheeled axles run on the overhead rail. In systems where the rail is beneath the cars, guide wheels provide stabilisation. The lightweight structure of the monorail allows it to make sharp turns in congested areas of the city, making it highly suitable for densely populated areas like Mumbai. Monorails are highly preferred in urban cities because their tracks take up less space, making them a feasible solution for addressing the transportation needs of densely populated areas like Mumbai.\n\nThe Beginning of Mumbai Monorail\n\nThe Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) proposed a plan for the Mumbai monorail in 2005 to improve urban mobility. In September 2008, the Mumbai monorail was announced as a feeder service to connect Chembur, Wadala, and Sant Ghadge Maharaj Chowk. This initiative was undertaken for several reasons:\n\nReduce Congestion\n\nThe Mumbai Monorail project was initiated for the areas where the roads are narrow and congested. To reduce congestion on roads and avoid property loss for the people, the project was announced.\n\nImprove Connectivity\n\nDue to limited connectivity in the suburban areas of Mumbai, the project aimed to link the eastern suburban areas to South Mumbai. It also connects with the harbour line, central line, and western line, enhancing the overall transport network.\n\nEco-friendly Transportation\n\nCompared to metro rail systems, monorails cause less noise pollution and are environmentally friendly.\n\nTimely Travel\n\nThe Mumbai Monorail reduces the travel time, especially during the peak hours, and reduces the travel time between central and eastern suburban areas of Mumbai.\n\nKey Facts about the Mumbai Monorail\n\nModern Urban Transport\n\nWith its remarkable features, the Mumbai Monorail is an expansion of public transport to make it accessible to sub-urban areas of the city.
