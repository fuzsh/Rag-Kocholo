        "text": "From a two-hour chaos at Central Railway due to snapping of the overhead wires between Dombivli and Thakurli stations to the water stock in the city's seven lakes surging up to 90% capacity. Catch up with the latest updates of the city with this Mumbai News Roundup.\n\nIn a first for the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA), its upcoming 39-storey Goregaon project will feature a swimming pool and gym. The luxury addition comes as MHADA ventures into larger, high-end homes. The project includes 332 units, with 105 3BHK apartments for high-income groups and 227 2BHK units for middle-income groups. This marks a significant shift in MHADA's approach to affordable housing, blending affordability with premium amenities.\n\nMonday afternoon chaos struck Mumbai's Central Railway when overhead wires snapped between Dombivli and Thakurli stations. The two-hour disruption led to 54 train cancellations and over 100 delays, causing severe overcrowding at major stations. Passengers were forced to walk along tracks, while authorities implemented speed restrictions and track blocks for repairs. The issue was resolved by 5:10 PM.\n\nMumbai will see light to moderate rain today, with moderate rainfall expected citywide. Following weekend downpours, the water stock in the city's seven lakes has surged to 90% capacity, totalling 13.02 lakh million litres. This recovery from a three-year low has led the BMC to lift the 10% water cut, thanks to significant rain in the lakes' catchment areas.\n\nMumbai is tackling manhole cover thefts with a high-tech solution. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is re-launching its smart manhole cover project, featuring sensors to prevent theft and accidents. This comes after a rise in thefts, with 791 reported in 2023. Initial trials will take place in Sandhurst Road and Grant Road. The BMC aims to enhance public safety and manage the cityâ€™s infrastructure more effectively.\n\nThe Airoli-Katai Naka Project in Mumbai is set to advance as the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) plans to appoint a contractor this month. This 6.72-kilometre elevated corridor will connect Shil and Katai, offering a direct route between Navi Mumbai and the Kalyan-Dombivli region. Expected to cut travel time by up to 30 minutes and reduce distance to just 7 km, the project aims to ease traffic congestion and enhance regional connectivity. Completion is projected by 2027."
