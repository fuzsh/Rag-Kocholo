The basis of the festival is to present “mini galleries” in the form of linear wall space or floor space in the Koch Gallery in which artists present a collection of their work. The festival welcomes both new and experienced artists with a wide breadth of work. The medium used for by the artist is as unique as the artist themselves. This year there is glass art, paintings, jewelry, metal works, mixed media, print, upcycle art, sculpture, and pottery.\n\nSAF’s schedule is slightly different than the gallery’s regular monthly rotation. It consists of three (3) ‘rounds’ during the 9-week period. A round consists of multiple solo and/or group exhibitions.\n\nShow openings are July 5, July 26, and August 16 (5pm – 8pm) and run for three (3) weeks, after which another round is installed. The Gallery will also be open for First Friday Gallery Cruise on July 5, August 2 (5pm – 8pm).\n\nArtists’ Opening Schedule\n\nOpening July 5: Matthew Beursken, Brette Flora, Lali Groth, Gretchen Hancock, Jonathan Kuzma, Marc Pease, Deborah Rieschi, Pamela Wickard.

Over the years, Studio Ghibli has produced remarkable and artistically significant animations such as Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro and last year’s Academy Award winning The Boy and the Heron.\n\nThe founder of the Mukai Studio Ghibli Festival, Adam Foster, explains, “It started with the Anime Club, an after-school program at Mukai for kids 12-18, as a way for kids use anime to learn more about Japanese folklore.” Studio Ghibli’s founder, Hayao Miyasaki drew much of its material from Japanese folk tales. Foster adds, “Miyazaki’s movies have strong, well written, female leads and strong environmental messages. Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is a good example because it’s about a princess trying to convince warring tribes of men that the only way to survive environmental destruction is by learning to live in harmony with nature.”\n\nFriends of Mukai expresses their sincere thanks to Vashon Theater for making the Mukai Studio Ghibli Festival possible.\n\nMovies in the Mukai Ghibli Festival line-up include:\n\nNausicaa of the Valley of the Wind Tues, June 25th, 7pm Castle in the Sky Tues, July 9th, 7pm Spirited Away Tues, July 23rd, 7pm My Neighbor Totoro Tues, Aug 6th, 7pm Princess Mononoke Tues, Aug 20th, 7pm Check out Mukai’s website, www.mukaifarmandgarden.org for additional information about the shows.\n\nView Event →\n\nMaking Movies\n\nMaking Movies\n\nOpen Space for Arts & Community\n\nWednesday, July 24\n\nDoors 6:30 | Show 7:30\n\nTickets @ OpenSpaceVashon.com\n\nEn Español y En Inglés\n\n“Perhaps one of the most unique groups around today, Making Movies is sensual, smoky, and seductive.

This DIY firecracker of a front woman has performed around the US and beyond not only as a country artist, but as a lead guitar player for her all-girl punk rock band The Dolly Rottens, as well as a co-fronting Bassist and Singer for ‘Weird Western Cowboy Band’ Brent Amaker Deathsquad. Darci is also known for her involvement as a model and actress with the ZZTop crew from 2012-2015 on the \"Gang of Outlaws Tour\" as the sassy pistol packin’ vixen \"The Girl\".\n\nDarci delivers a true country performance of foot stompin' originals and classic country favorites drenched in hardcore twang. This isn’t Punk Country or a vanity act. This is a no non-sense, throwback, true country affair.\n\nA natural story teller, her songs highlight tales of her truth, youth, and lawless adventures, no matter how ‘wild, reckless & crazy’. Her smokey sweet lived-in voice reminiscent of the after taste of a shot of whiskey, has been compared to other leading ladies in the Country and Rock Genres such as Bonnie Raitt, Tammy Wynette, Patty Loveless, Miranda Lambert, and Courtney Love.\n\nRecognized for her devotion to Roots-Americana and renouncing the “pop country” sound, she is a 3 time nominee and 2017 Outlaw Female of The Year with Honky Tonk Hero Dale Watson's Ameripolitan Music Awards out of Austin Texas and Memphis Tennessee.\n\n\"If there was ever a personification of the ladies canonized in Hank Williams Jr.’s self-penned tune “Outlaw Women” from Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound, it would be Darci Carlson.”- Saving Country Music\n\nFrom smokey neon lit dive bars and honky tonks to starlit outdoor festival nights, Darci has had the pleasure of sharing the stage with National acts such as Shooter Jennings, Midland, Clint Black, Lonestar, The Steelwoods, Paul Cauthen, Ward Davis, The Supersuckers, Sunny Sweeny, Whiskey Meyers, Randy Rogers Band, Wayne 'The Train' Hankcock, Mickey and The Motorcars, Roger Clyne and The Peacemakers, Shane Smith and The Saints, and Nikki Lane to name a few.\n\nView Event →\n\nCami Maree\n\nCami Maree\n\nDig Deep Gardens\n\nSunday, July 28\n\n4pm\n\nDebra Heesch Presents: After seven years CAMI MAREE finally returns to Vashon Island - where it all began. She will be performing a solo show at Dig Deep Gardens Sunday, July 28th at 4pm.\n\nAfter an intense battle with cancer in 2023, the Alternative Soul Rocker is back to performing with an even greater fierceness and passion. Cami Maree creates music in the same way she lives life, with a relentless conviction that inspires others to rise above their circumstances to experience a life of purpose and freedom. Her beautifully haunting voice, profound lyrics, and intriguing melodies linger long after you've heard them. Cami Maree’s live performance captivates and stirs you to the depths of your being. Her most recent EP, SCARS embodies the idea that our Scars make us who we are, and we can fight them, or we can embrace them.\n\nCami Maree’s music career began at her church on Vashon Island. After some time of playing in church, and building up her originals, she played her first public show at the local farmer’s market in the spring of 2012. She quickly amassed a large local following by playing numerous shows and festivals around the Seattle area including Seattle’s famed venues The Crocodile, The Hard Rock Café, and The Triple Door.\n\nLeaving Washington state in June 2014, Cami Maree toured the country for five months, and settled in the Gainesville, Florida area. She continued to travel throughout Florida performing at a variety of venues for several years before relocating to the Colorado Springs area in late 2019. Cami Maree performed throughout Colorado over the next few years until a cancer diagnosis in 2023 derailed many of her musical aspirations. She stepped out of performing for a year to undergo extensive surgery and recovery. She had previously recorded songs for her EP Scars and was able to release the EP in August 2023, which took on a whole new meaning after her cancer diagnosis.\n\nCami Maree released her crowd-funded debut album Run Free in August 2013. She released her single Free in May 2021, followed by singles Power of the Blood and How Do We Wanna Go Out in the summer of 2022. In the winter of 2022, she released A Cami Maree Christmas. Her most recent EP titled Scars was released in August 2024 and she is currently working on the full album expected early 2025.\n\nView Event →\n\nFORMAN, PHARES, HOBBS (A special evening of great jazz!)\n\nFORMAN, PHARES, HOBBS\n\n(A special evening of great jazz!)\n\nVashon Center for the Arts\n\nSunday, July 28, at 7:30pm\n\nTickets $32-$35\n\nBassist and Vashon jazz ambassador Bruce Phares is joined on stage in Kay by jazz “red guitar” icon Bruce Forman and seasoned jazz drummer Gary Hobbs.\n\nBRUCE FORMAN, guitar:\n\nA hectic touring schedule; twenty-one recordings as a leader, countless sideman recordings including Ray Brown, Bobby Hutcherson, Roger Kellaway; soundtrack performances on three of Clint Eastwood’s distinguished films—most notably Academy Award-winning Million Dollar Baby; raconteur, arranger, acclaimed educator, in residence at USC’s Studio/Jazz Guitar Department, when does Bruce Forman rest?\n\nDeep immersion in American culture inspires Forman to contribute to the traditions that he draws from. Reunion! (the newest project) revisits the famed Poll Winners sessions with cohorts John Clayton and Jeff Hamilton, playing instruments owned by Barney Kessel, Ray Brown and Shelly Manne; Formanism (his trio project); original works like The Red Guitar; his high-rated podcast, GuitarWank; Cow Bop and the “road challenges” down historic byways like Route 66; JazzMasters Workshop; Junkyard Duo; GrumpsTV (a fifty episode YouTube variety show during the lockdown), the popular ‘first chorus of the day’ series on Instagram…these are only the latest answers to the endless question that underlies Bruce Forman’s creativity. His music and life reflect every step of his journey and demonstrate the awareness of an artist who is very much at home in the world and at the top of his form. Bruce Forman’s life and musical journey provide an American saga still in full swing. His Texas origins, early career in San Francisco and New York, and years on the road all contribute to the unique and highly personal vision that he demonstrates today.\n\nBRUCE PHARES, Bass:\n\nPhares is perhaps best known for his four-decade duet relationship with legendary pianist Overton Berry — along with his performances with other renowned jazz greats, including Dianne Schuur, Larry Coryell, Roland Hannah, Frank Wess, George Cables, Bruce Forman, Charlie Bird, Ernestine Anderson, and others. Bruce can be heard every first Saturday, jamming with his friends in the VCA Atrium as part of their Jam in the Atrium Free live music series.\n\nGARY HOBBS, drums:\n\nDrummer Gary Hobbs is a native of the Pacific Northwest and lives in Vancouver, WA.

It's been 4 years since Clinton has played in the Park, so we are really looking forward to him kicking things off!\n\nClinton Fearon is a composer, songwriter, singer and player of instruments since his early teens. Born in Jamaica, Clinton became the bassist, vocalist and lyricist of the mythic Gladiators at the age of 19. He spent 18 years with the band and signed several songs for The Gladiators, hits and classics like Chatty Chatty Mouth, Richman Poorman, On The Other Side, Can You Imagine How I Feel, Let Jah Be Praised, One Love, Untrue Girl, and more.\n\nClinton Fearon was also a session musician for different studio in Jamaica, including with producers Coxsone Dodd at Studio One and Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry’s at Black Ark, but also at Chanel One, Aquarius, Harry J, Randy’s, etc. In these studios, Clinton Fearon composed some everlasting bass lines for well-known artists like Yabby You, Jimmy Riley, Max Romeo, Junior Byles and many others.\n\nAfter leaving Jamaica in 1987, Clinton Fearon started a new career in Seattle. Him and some of the musicians of The Gladiators took advantage of the extra time remaining on their visa, at the end of the US tour, to start a band in the Northwest: The Defenders. The band built a nice following in the area until they split after five years. And finally, Clinton Fearon formed his own band in the mid-90s with local musicians in Seattle: Clinton Fearon and Boogie Brown Band.\n\nClinton Fearon recorded 14 albums under his own name since and he’s touring the world with this impressive repertoire, accompanied by a band or in solo acoustic.

With chiseled music and poetic lyrics, he opens reggae to a wider audience who simply loves his beautiful songs. https://www.clintonfearon.com\n\nOpening for each band this year is a fresh Vashon Events program, “New Voices,” an opportunity to hear the latest musical addition to the Vashon music scene.

Over the years, Studio Ghibli has produced remarkable and artistically significant animations such as Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro and last year’s Academy Award winning The Boy and the Heron.\n\nThe founder of the Mukai Studio Ghibli Festival, Adam Foster, explains, “It started with the Anime Club, an after-school program at Mukai for kids 12-18, as a way for kids use anime to learn more about Japanese folklore.” Studio Ghibli’s founder, Hayao Miyasaki drew much of its material from Japanese folk tales. Foster adds, “Miyazaki’s movies have strong, well written, female leads and strong environmental messages. Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is a good example because it’s about a princess trying to convince warring tribes of men that the only way to survive environmental destruction is by learning to live in harmony with nature.”\n\nFriends of Mukai expresses their sincere thanks to Vashon Theater for making the Mukai Studio Ghibli Festival possible.\n\nMovies in the Mukai Ghibli Festival line-up include:\n\nNausicaa of the Valley of the Wind Tues, June 25th, 7pm Castle in the Sky Tues, July 9th, 7pm Spirited Away Tues, July 23rd, 7pm My Neighbor Totoro Tues, Aug 6th, 7pm Princess Mononoke Tues, Aug 20th, 7pm Check out Mukai’s website, www.mukaifarmandgarden.org for additional information about the shows.\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Vashon Island Film Festival\n\nThe Vashon Island Film Festival\n\nAugust 8th-11th, 2024\n\nA program of the Vashon Film Institute, the Vashon Island Film Festival (“VIFF”) is held on picturesque Vashon Island, WA, every second week of August, celebrating independent film through curated screenings of notable and award-winning films from the preceding festival season.\n\nVFI presents, the nascent sub-division of the Vashon Film Institute (VFI), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, has announced NTMRKT at the Backlot, an open-air market during Vashon Summer Nights featuring local vendors selling art, antiques, vintage goods, collectibles, and other products. Patrons may also enjoy a beverage from the beer and wine garden while they shop, catch a silent film, or dance the night away with sets from local DJs. Admission to the NTMRKT is free, and will be held every First Friday, July through September, from 5pm-9pm.\n\nVendor applications for NTMRKT shall typically open three weeks before each event, and shall close the week prior (or once all space is reserved, whichever is soonest). Notwithstanding the foregoing, vendor applications for the inaugural event on July 5, 2024, are already open, and vendors are encouraged to apply quickly as reservations are secured on a first come, first serve basis.\n\n“Our goal is to expand VFI’s presence beyond the Vashon Island Film Festival(VIFF), both on the island and in and around the greater PacificNorthwest,” says VFI President Mark Mathias Sayre. “As NTMRKT is VFIpresents’ first formal program outside of VIFF, we look forward to introducing the community to local artists and vendors during its cherished First Fridays. And to host it at the Backlot at the Vashon Theatre is an exciting opportunity and a space we hope to be coordinating events at for years to come.”\n\nTo help staff the NTMRKT and VIFF, and to continue building a support infrastructure for the Vashon Theatre, VFI is also launching a new volunteer program, seeking willing members of the community to fill various positions on a rolling basis. Such positions shall include:\n\nSales Clerks, who shall be responsible for selling tickets at the box office and providing information to patrons about screenings; and\n\nTheatre Ambassadors, who shall introduce films, survey the technical quality of screenings, monitor for public disturbance, and clean the theater after use; and\n\nConcessions Attendants, who shall assist customers at the concessions stand (requires food worker card).\n\nFor positions that require permitting not already held by volunteers, VFI shall reimburse volunteers for the cost of obtaining them. Most volunteer positions work in shifts less than 3-4 hours, and volunteers shall be rewarded with one free movie pass to the Vashon Theatre for each shift worked. All volunteer positions are subject to interviews with VFI and Vashon Theatre personnel.\n\n“The Vashon Theatre is a cultural landmark on the island and a seminal arts institution in the region,” adds Sayre. “As such, VFI views it as the centerpiece of VIFF and as a vital partner for the institute’s various other programs. Helping to support their infrastructure is intricately linked to the success of our own organization, and we’re hoping to mirror volunteer programs at other incredible cinemas in the Pacific Northwest, such as The Grand Cinema in Tacoma.”\n\nIndividuals interested in volunteering may email VFI Event Coordinator Michelle Johnson (mljohnson2708@gmail.com) and CC vashonfilmfest@gmail.com for more information.\n\nMore info here: https://vashonislandfilmfestival.com/\n\nView Event →\n\nDogs & Drinks\n\nDogs & Drinks\n\nDig Deep Gardens\n\nThursdays\n\n5-8pm\n\n21+ only\n\nCome bring your best friend and let them learn to socialize with their own kind.

Each concert presents something new to experience!\n\nThird up in the concert series on August 15th is Adrian and Meredith! Rogue-folk music duo and band “Adrian and Meredith” have always marched to the beat of their own drum, unapologetic in the art they create. Since joining forces in 2015, they have put their own spin on Americana music, embodying the spirit of the human story through influences of punk, folk, polka, and swing. Their lively concerts inspire audiences to dance, clap, and stomp along.\n\nIn 2023, Adrian and Meredith toured over 100 shows across the USA, Canada, and Europe. They supported acts such as Steve'n'Seagulls, Shawn James, Jimbo Mathus, and Th'Legendary Shackshakers. They also performed at festivals like Blissfest, Wheatland Festival, and 30A Songwriters Festival. Additionally, they played prestigious venues including Performing Art Centers and Levitt Shell Pavilions nationwide. Now, six years after their debut, Adrian and Meredith are taking their fearless, blistering, Balkan-tinged Americana sound to new heights - a raucous yet intimate variety show. The new record draws in listeners with the duo's warmth, intensity and candidness - imparting an easy sense of joy and kinship in turbulent times.\n\n2024 promises more touring, music, and revelry as this duo continues marching to their own rhythm. They plan to release a series of new songs recorded at Dial Back Records in Oxford, MS with members of bands like Squirrel Nut Zippers, Punch Brothers, Mighty Poplar, and with Jimbo Mathus.\n\nTheir band has been described as “elements of klezmer, power pop, ska, New Orleans swing and a touch of blues rock just for good measure...with enthusiasm and oodles of charm...includes romantic joys and dramas, the vagaries of getting old and the theft of a keishka. Have fun with this one! (Paste Magazine)\"\n\nCome see what No Depression aptly calls “A barn-burner of Roots Rock Perfection!” https://adrianandmeredith.com/\n\nOpening for the Adrian & Meredith will be Vashon locals Shawn & Colette Jones. Colette Jones is a singer, songwriter, and musician from Washington State, formerly based in Nashville, TN.\n\nA lifelong daydreamer, she grew up enveloped in songs and stories. Her musical journey has taken her from playing power chords in a punk band to Travis Picking folk songs and singing old country ballads. She found her footing in Americana music, through which she could combine her interests in storytelling and performance. Since then she's had the pleasure of collaborating with many wonderful musicians on a variety of projects, as well as foraying into the world of musical theater.\n\nDuring a transformative tenure in Nashville, Colette polished up her catalog of original songs, and with the help of some of Music City's finest, etched them into two full-length studio albums. Her debut, Deluge, intertwines classic country and Americana sounds, while infused with an ethereal and bluegrass drive. The tracks unfold as tales of love and loss, addiction, heartache, and an overarching theme of “searching for a way home,” as Colette sings in the opening lines of the first track, \"Unfound.\" The album skillfully walks the line between blues-rock on tracks like \"Secret Life,\" and a rebellious “outlaw country” spirit as showcased on tracks such as \"Fever Dream\" and \"Train Song.\" The follow up, TBA, builds on these themes, with honky-tonk and cosmic country influences.

Everyone in this band has put in their ten-thousand hours and then some on song-craft and musicianship, and you can feel the pulse of life in their music–the wide embrace of love, the heavy clouds of grief, the resolute ache of longing and the sacred sounds of healing.

Over the years, Studio Ghibli has produced remarkable and artistically significant animations such as Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro and last year’s Academy Award winning The Boy and the Heron.\n\nThe founder of the Mukai Studio Ghibli Festival, Adam Foster, explains, “It started with the Anime Club, an after-school program at Mukai for kids 12-18, as a way for kids use anime to learn more about Japanese folklore.” Studio Ghibli’s founder, Hayao Miyasaki drew much of its material from Japanese folk tales. Foster adds, “Miyazaki’s movies have strong, well written, female leads and strong environmental messages. Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is a good example because it’s about a princess trying to convince warring tribes of men that the only way to survive environmental destruction is by learning to live in harmony with nature.”\n\nFriends of Mukai expresses their sincere thanks to Vashon Theater for making the Mukai Studio Ghibli Festival possible.\n\nMovies in the Mukai Ghibli Festival line-up include:\n\nNausicaa of the Valley of the Wind Tues, June 25th, 7pm Castle in the Sky Tues, July 9th, 7pm Spirited Away Tues, July 23rd, 7pm My Neighbor Totoro Tues, Aug 6th, 7pm Princess Mononoke Tues, Aug 20th, 7pm Check out Mukai’s website, www.mukaifarmandgarden.org for additional information about the shows.\n\nView Event →\n\nCosmic Charlie\n\nCosmic Charlie\n\nOpen Space for Arts & Community\n\nJuly 6\n\nDoors 6:30 | Show 7:30\n\nCosmic Charlie – Grateful Dead tribute.\n\n“Cosmic Charlie really is a great band – these guys do this music the way it should be done: having the conversation in their own voices.” -David Gans, Grateful Dead Hour\n\nCosmic Charlie was born in the musical Mecca of Athens, Georgia. From its summer 1999 inception, the band swiftly cemented its reputation as a band that puts a unique and personal twist on the Grateful Dead catalog. Cosmic Charlie is a Dead cover band for folks who are ambivalent about Dead cover bands.\n\nRather than mimicking the Dead exactly, Cosmic Charlie chooses to tap into the Dead’s energy and style as a foundation on which to build. The result is a healthy balance of creativity and tradition, where both the band and its audience are taken to that familiar edge with the sense that, music is actually being MADE here tonight.\n\nMoving and shaking even the most skeptical of Deadheads, Cosmic Charlie storms into a town and plays with an energy that eludes other bands, an energy that sometimes eluded the Dead themselves. Those precious moments during Dead jams when the synchronicity is there and all is right with the world – these are the moments that Cosmic Charlie relishes and feverishly welcomes with open arms. Cosmic Charlie’s audiences are eager to partake in these moments, and together with the band, they have indulged in many memorable evenings.\n\nMost nights, Cosmic Charlie walks onstage without a setlist, not even knowing what the first song will be. Any Dead tune can rear its head at any moment, and fan requests are always welcome. “INSPIRATION, MOVE ME BRIGHTLY” is Cosmic Charlie’s mantra, allowing the music to truly play the band.\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Banned\n\nThe Banned\n\nDig Deep Gardens\n\n19028 Vashon HWY. S.W\n\nSaturday, July 6th\n\n7:00pm\n\nChris Anderson and various friends, muckers, cronies, acquaintances, distant relatives, familiar strangers, and others will gather at the Dig July 6th at 7pm for an evening of merriment and distraction involving the playing of instruments and the uttering of words closely related to but not always on the key of the songs.…The show will involve both ‘original’ songs and covers….which are not usually decided upon until after we start. Please come on down and support Dig …..cool people, coop place. Pack of miscreants with instruments…..what could go wrong?\n\nView Event →\n\nSinner & The Saints\n\nSinner & The Saints\n\nDig Deep Gardens\n\nFriday, July 5th|\n\n7:00pm\n\nSinner and the Saints is a rock and roll band consisting of all current or former Vashon residents. Its members have all been in many different island groups, and they have shared the stage with each other in various combinations going back over 40 years. Playing everything from oldies and rock standards to innovative renditions of modern hits, their years of experience and depth of talent are a guarantee for a great show.\n\nThe Sinner of the group, Loren plays bass and sings. Equally comfortable on piano and guitar, you have likely seen this local musician on stage during his many years in the Vashon music scene. Raised in a musical family, Loren finds time to perform while raising a family and running his local business.\n\nGuitarist Jerry Todo is a highly skilled and accomplished player. Known for getting just the right sound, his amazing solos have been delighting audiences for years. A former Doily Brother, Jerry has also played the big stages. Picked out of 90 applicants, he toured as the guitarist for the Anne Murray band. He was also the long time musical partner of the late John Hjorten.\n\nGuitarist Scotty Johnson lives and breathes rock and roll. Also a long time member of the Doily Brothers, Scotty has played in many Seattle bands over the years. He currently plays with the Elements of Rock, and is sought after for his guitar and vocal skills. An oldies specialist, he often dedicates songs to his beloved late father, island sign painter Les Johnson.\n\nIt would be easier to list the bands that drummer Brett Bacchus has not played in than the ones he has. Simply put, Brett is Vashon's drummer. Another Doily Brother legend, Brett is truly the foundation of island rock.\n\nView Event →\n\n2024 SUMMER FARM DINNERS at Aeggy's Farm\n\n2024 SUMMER FARM DINNERS\n\nAeggy's Farm\n\n13609 SW 220th St\n\nBuy tickets here: https://aeggys.com/farm-dinners\n\nJuly 5th = ***SOLD OUT***\n\nNext one = July 30th!\n\nAfter that = August 6th & 13th\n\nChoose a seating time, arrive anytime within that hour.\n\nRain or shine, if it rains take it to go or you can eat under one of our covered areas.
