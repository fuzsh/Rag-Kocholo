        "text": "Your support matters\n\nWe give our heartfelt thanks to those who contributed to Phase One of the Lost Mural's art conservation: cleaning and preservation. This phase was successfully completed in August 2021. Visit our conservation page to learn more.\n\nWe also share our grateful appreciation with those who contributed to Phase Two of the Lost Mural's art conservation: infill and restoration. This phase was successfully completed in June, 2022. A photo from June, 2022 is attached showing the Lost Mural after its full restoration to its original dramatic colors as painted by Ben Zion Black in 1910!!\n\nFollowing the June 2022 reveal event, additional work was done to replicate the green tent borders and the blue and white sky based upon the historical slides and samples taken from the Lost Mural. These borders were completed in November 2022; only the bottom edging needs to be added when funds are secured. A photo from November 2022 is attached showing the Lost Mural with the entire Tent of the Tabernacle and the mural’s brilliant hues.\n\nFor Canadian Citizens\n\nThe Lost Mural Fund is proud to be partnering with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism (USCJ)-Canada so that Canadians can easily make tax-deductible contributions to the project.\n\nTo make a gift from Canada, please click here and complete the online donation form. When making your contribution, you will be able to select “Lost Mural” from a list of designated funds. You will receive a tax donation letter from USCJ-Canada and your gift will be fully tax-deductible on your Canadian tax return.
