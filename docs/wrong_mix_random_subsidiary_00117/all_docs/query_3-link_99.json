May his love and passion for Gordon’s continue to guide GFS in the years to come.\n\nDoug Schmucker, April 17, 2019\n\nTHANK YOU MR. GORDON- YOU TRANSFORMED COMMERCIAL FOOD SERVICE & DELIVERY.\n\nSIR, YOUR FORESIGHT IGNIGHTED THE COMPETITION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESTIGE PRODUCTS.\n\nBACKSTAGECATERED.COM, April 16, 2019\n\nMet him and his brothers at the Michigan show over 20 years ago, very nice person, as well as his brothers. Rest In Peace and may god look over your family.\n\nTom Volpi,Albinos Meats &Catering Ashtabula , Ohio, April 16, 2019\n\nPlease accept my condolences. I have a memory of seeing John and Nancy at a local diner, Real Food Cafe. My wife and I go to that customer for brunch after Sunday mass. I saw John and I went up to introduce myself and say “hello”. He and Nancy were both so kind and friendly to us. I remember feeling both a sense of pride that one of our leaders was supporting our customer and that he was just a nice, “regular” gent. Every time we eat at that place, I think about John when I pass that booth.\n\nJim Falling, April 16, 2019\n\nThe quiet giant in the industry. I had the pleasure of working and reporting to John SR for five years in Multi-Unit. I learned so much and found that he and Paul were perfect leaders together, John was the quieter, but make no mistake, John always had his finger on the pulse of GFS! RIP as you walk with The Master on the streets of Gold beside the Crystal Sea\n\nScott Shellenberger, April 15, 2019\n\nJust saw this and am so sad to hear of John’s passing. My Gordy thought the world of him and Paul. I send my deepest sympathy to Nancy and all the Gordon Family.\n\nTammy Wynn, April 15, 2019\n\nSo sorry for your loss. Prayers go out you to all. Just remember, the grieved are left behind but for John he is celebrating in heaven with God’s holy glory. Blessings and Peace.\n\nKimberley Black, Falmouth, MA, April 15, 2019\n\nMy restaurant is a 25 year GFS customer. We have grown from one to four through the blessings of GFS and the Gordon family. I did not know John well, but can only imagine his strong connection to his Faith as I’ve read the posts below.\n\nMy very first GFS show I was bussed to Grand Rapids. I was very new to the industry and scared to death. I sat with a very experienced operator who calmed me down and helped me navigate some tough problems we were facing.\n\nWhen we got to the Amway Grand, Paul Gordon got on our bus, shook hands with everyone, asked our names and wanted to know a little about our operations. When we left, he again boarded our our bus, called us each by our first name and asked each of us a very personal question about our businesses. He had actually LISTENED to us in that first encounter.\n\nPaul said GFS was looking for Customers for Life. 25 years later here I still am. I have heard the legendary stories of annual meetings and the working of the Gordon family Faith into their company and daily living.\n\nAmazing company, amazing people, God-inspired daily living. God Bless all of GFS through the seeds planted by these wonderful men.\n\nAnn Reichle, Angelina’s Pizza, April 15, 2019\n\nMay his soul rest in peace.\n\nDenise McDowell, April 15, 2019\n\nGod Bless John, a very nice man and a true servant leader.\n\nMatt Dellacqua, April 15, 2019\n\nSee you on the other side John!\n\nJust an average citizen, and shopper from time to time, always liked the staff, and food!\n\nKurt from Columbus, Ohio\n\nKurt J. Vatter, April 14, 2019\n\nA big heart and a laugh to match. Blessed to know both !!\n\nRol Jager, April 14, 2019\n\nFrom everyone at Harrys Grill on AMI Florida. Great company…great staff….it all starts at the top! Our prayers and condolences to this awesome family! Jan and Mark Labriola\n\nJan and Mark Labriola, April 14, 2019\n\nA few years back I was having lunch with one of the business professors that I had back when I was in college. During the conversation, my professor began telling about a wedding he attended a few weeks earlier. At the wedding, he said he saw an older gentleman sitting by himself, so he went over and started a conversation. My professor asked the gentleman where he worked and he said Gordon Food Service. My professor then asked him his name since he knew quite a few Hope College graduates working at GFS. The gentleman said his name was John Gordon Sr. As my professor was telling me this story, he also talked about he was struck with humility in his conveying he was simply an employee at Gordon Food Service and the passion that John conveyed about GFS to him as their conversation continued.\n\nThis story has always stuck with me and I wanted to share it as a tribute.\n\nPrayers to the entire family and may John rest in peace.\n\nDerek Torno, April 14, 2019\n\nOur prayers go out to the Gordon family.\n\nI can not say how much we appreciate all John and the Gordon family has done for us and how the family practiced servant leadership. We will miss him.\n\nDennis Goossens, April 14, 2019\n\nMy heart and prayers go out to everyone in the Gordon family. I never had the pleasure of meeting John but I have had the pleasure of working for Gordon Food Service for the past 12 years and I can honestly say that after being in the work force for over 45 years, “It is the best company I have ever worked for.”\n\nThe way they treat their employees, customers, vendors and community responsibility, should be a template for every business.\n\nGo with God John.\n\nTerrance Sherback, Gordon Food Service, Edmonton, AB Canada, April 14, 2019\n\nMay his Soul Rest In Peace.\n\nGreat man .\n\nDia Francis / Wyndham Garden Hotel – Romulus MI, April 13, 2019\n\nI worked at Gordon’s foodservice in the marketplace store right across the street from the old office for 6 years. He was so charming to the customers as well those that worked there. No matter how high or low in the rankings he humbly made EVERYONE feel special and important. Paul was exactly the same way. They both would walk in the store and it lit up the place . They were so humble and you could instantly notice they were servants of God. I ended up moving up to the corporate office. I didn’t see him so much there but will never forget how John and Paul treated everyone. So sad he passed but I know where he is along with his brother in heaven 😇😇\n\nJill Calton, April 13, 2019\n\nMy condolences to the entire Gordon family. John and his family built a wonderful company with integrity and compassion. He leaves a lasting legacy. My prayers are with all of you.\n\nJodi Mercer, ESG, April 13, 2019\n\nI feel so sad but, also, so blessed to have known John and the entire Gordon family. He always made me feel like family throughout my long career with such an amazing company.\n\nI remember working one of my last food shows, talking to John with the Cheese Guys about Limburger Cheese. I thought my mom was the only person that loved it…..he also loved it!!\n\nThe last time I talked to him, he called me from Florida after I retired, I hung up on him, then called him back when I found out it really was him. He wondered why I quit, and I told him I retired. So thankful I had that special opportunity to thank him for allowing me to work for Gordon family and treating me like family. What a great leader & friend.\n\nMy heart goes out to all the Gordon family.\n\nPat Thomas Howard, April 13, 2019\n\nFrom Famas pizza and pasta in Orlando, Fl Our sincerest condolences to the Gordon Family.\n\nMy thoughts are with you.\n\nChef Antonio Petrarca, April 13, 2019\n\nA truly great sailing buddy, who will truly be missed. However he will be among fellow sailors now. Up there in the ocean in the sky where the wind blows free and always from behind …. Sticky & Bugs\n\nSticky Armitage, April 12, 2019\n\nOne of my fondest memories is from when I had only been at GFS for a few years. I was standing in a long line at the post office. When I turned the corner I noticed John standing a few places behind me. Dressed in his bibs and deck shoes you would have never known who he really was. He greeted me by name and treated me like a long lost friend. What impressed me most was that he was just standing in line with a couple dozen others, waiting to buy stamps. Just a normal guy. Nothing pretentious, no flash, just John.\n\nWe will miss you Mr. Gordon.\n\nBe at peace.\n\nJames Coleman, April 12, 2019\n\nThis leaves everyone with a heavy heart. We became part of Gordon Food Service in 2000, when then Neptune Foodservice was acquired. We are all grateful to John and the family for having the courage and belief in the Neptune team to become part of the Gordon Food Service family. Rest in Peace knowing that your leadership has been well woven into the culture of this great organization.\n\nJoseph Lavoie, Fresh Start Foods, Vancouver, April 12, 2019\n\nWe all think about the legacy we will leave when we pass. John was not just a great leader, but he left the world a better place by living it with dignity and gracefulness. I did not know John but had the opportunity to shake his hands a few times. But I did know about his legacy. And I am sure it will continue with the family and company.\n\nAndrew Conger, April 12, 2019\n\nMy husband retired from GFS in 2009, we only had the opportunity to speak with John Gordon once, at one of the Christmas parties. Mr. Gordon was one of the most humble men I have ever had the privilege to meet.. I am so sorry for your loss, my prayers are with the family and others..\n\nMary Lewis, April 12, 2019\n\nSo Sorry for your loss! May God Bless and Keep your family at this time.\n\nDave LaForge Abbvie AP30, April 12, 2019\n\nJohn seemed to be a great servant leader.\n\nI never had the privilege to work directly with John, but he seemed to be a strong man in the sense that he was content to be Paul’s right hand man. Many companies/families are torn apart by the thought of one family member placing themselves under the leadership another. Most companies can’t make it past 2 generations because of family squabbles over everyone’s “rights”. Because of the kind hearts in the Gordon family they seem to be able to put their pride aside to do what is right to keep the company working at a high level. To me that is a great example of servant leadership. It has been a privilege to work at GFS for 28 years with Paul and John and then their kids leading the way.\n\nLarry Denslow, April 12, 2019\n\nWe will miss you very much! Thanks for all you did….\n\nStephanie Stickler, April 12, 2019\n\nOur sincerest condolences to the Gordon Family.\n\nMy thoughts are with you.\n\nBenoit Brousseau, Montreal, April 12, 2019\n\nGordon Family, You are in my prayers from The Mustard Seed Red Deer, I am the chef at the Mustard Seed Red Deer. Wow John Gordon has dedicated to serve the community wow! Bless his heart.\n\nCori Capner, The Chef from the Mustard Seed Red Deer, April 12, 2019\n\nYour laughter, joy, and legacy to our lives are the memories I will treasure most about you. Thank you for investing your life into our livelihood. Traveling with you and Nancy, along with the others, to BVI, celebrating your 86th on that trip, and the friendship you both extended were truly great memories, I will never forget. It’s your legacy that allows us to do what we do and we are forever grateful! I can’t wait to hear you laugh again when I get to the other side. You are in our hearts and you will be missed.\n\nJill Noffsinger-Day, April 12, 2019\n\nIt was the day after Paul Gordon’s funeral that my husband and I went on the Person of the Year trip to Alaska. We were really worried that the trip wasn’t going to be what we expected because of Paul’s passing. However the day after we arrived we went on our first excursion to a gold mine and when we got back to the hotel the driver asked us to stay on the bus for a minute. A few minutes later John Gordon and Dave Grey boarded the bus. John told us that he knew we were all thinking of Paul and he wanted this trip to be a great trip. He said that he wasn’t Paul and didn’t remember names like he did but he was going to make sure we all had a great time and he knew Paul wouldn’t want us to dwell his passing. We boarded a train the next day and he and Nancy sat up on the second floor and each couple went up to spend time with them while we traveled. It truly ended up being the best trip to date for me and it was awesome spending time with him. He will be missed.\n\nRenee’ Morgan, April 12, 2019\n\nI had a few encounters with John as a 14-year employee of Gordon Food Service. Warmth and compassion is the description I experienced in my encounters with John.\n\nDavid Tebussek, April 12, 2019\n\nTruly a great man and great leader, who’s life should be celebrated. Thoughts and prayers to the family\n\nTodd Sandquist, April 12, 2019\n\nMy deepest condolences to the Gordon family. Remembering John’s wonderful and gentle soul will forever remain in our hearts. May he rest in peace. May care and love provide comfort and peace to John family and loved ones.\n\nKim Majetic, April 12, 2019\n\nPlease accept my condolences on the passing of John. I did not have an opportunity to meet him, but for many years I have benefitted from his vision to provide excellent food service to his customers. I have been involved in Christian Camping in British Columbia for 35 years. GFS has supplied food and much more at the last two camps I have managed (Young Life’s RockRidge Canyon in Princeton and now Camp Homewood on Quadra Island). Quadra Island is a small island off the coast of Vancouver Island. It is a great blessing to have a world class partner to provide for the needs of our campers throughout the year. The GFS staff are great to work with, and our rep always gives a cheque to help financially disadvantaged children attend camp so we can share the gospel with them. I know all of these things are a representation of the values of John and the entire Gordon family. May God bless you in this time of grief, and may you be comforted by your faith in Jesus.\n\nPaul Bailey, April 12, 2019\n\nI’m so grateful for the years that I was with the company that he worked so hard with Paul and others to build. How wonderful that his goal in life was to serve God, his dear family, and the people he worked with. What a great legacy he has left for us all! I pray that God will give the family all the strength and hope they need during this difficult time.\n\nDeb Timinskis, April 12, 2019\n\nLife brings tears, smiles, and memories. The tears dry, the smile fades, but the memories live on forever. My thoughts and prayers to the Gordon family….\n\nGod Bless\n\nTommy Castillo (Miami Flagler), April 12, 2019\n\nI’m very grateful and blessed to work for an amazing company. I was fortunate enough to be chosen as person of the year and able to travel with John and Nancy. I will be forever grateful to be able to provide for my family because of the legacy John and Paul started so many years ago. My condolences to Nancy and the entire Gordon family. Thanks be to God for giving us this man who taught us compassion and the true meaning of kindness and giving.\n\nCarrie Winchel, April 12, 2019\n\nThank you for your leadership and faithfulness to God. Praying for peace and comfort for the family.\n\nMark Wetters, April 12, 2019\n\nI met John for the first time on a hunting retreat in Three Rivers, MI about 20 years ago. A humble man that made me feel like he had known me for years and I was part of his family. Well done John. You have been a humble and faithful servant to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. May you rest in Heavenly peace. Thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Gordon family.\n\nTodd & Trudy Hershberger, April 12, 2019\n\nGordon Food Service expanded their distribution business today with a new branch in Heaven. Thanks John for all you have done for the foodservice industry and the customers you served.\n\nTom Wessling, Intalere, April 12, 2019\n\nI have an un payable debt of gratitude to John.\n\nAs written, John was passionately committed to the needs and interest of his customers and employees. And being in John’s presence assured me of that.\n\nMy thoughts and prayers are with Nancy, John Jr., and Sue.\n\nMay John enjoy eternal peace and rest.\n\nTerry Diso, April 12, 2019\n\nMy heartfelt condolences to the Gordon Family. John left a legacy with all that he accomplished and gave, and to all he served. I am truly grateful to be a part of the Gordon Food Service Family. Rest in peace John. May you bask in the light of the Lord as your life is celebrated.\n\nMaria DeNicola, April 12, 2019\n\nOur thoughts and condolences to the entire Gordon Family. 26 years with GFS gave my family and I the opportunity to be touched by John Gordon personally in a deep way. John’s faith, servant leadership, mentoring guidance continues to bless our family to this day with the lessons that Paul and John taught us. The foundation that they laid and the examples of Stewardship they led with everyday touched us all and live on each day for us. Thank you John for all you taught us with your Servant Leadership.\n\nPaul and Judi Dow, April 12, 2019\n\nMy deepest condolences to the Gordon family. May God grant you the love and peace needed during this time of sorrow.\n\nAnonymous, April 12, 2019\n\nI had the Honor and pleasure of having John ride with me my first year on the job (yes I was a little nervous). It was just fascinating and almost unbelievable to me that John Gordon would come to Traverse City and jump in the car with me to visit customers. A true testament to a Great man of humility and honor. A life well lived. My heart goes out to the Gordon family.\n\nJerry Gregory, April 12, 2019\n\nThank you for all your support!\n\nLOVE ALL OF US AT CHAPMAN PARTNERSHIP\n\nAngel Cline Chapman Partnership North Center, April 12, 2019\n\nThis morning on my drive into the office the idea of the “ripple effect” came to mind as I thought about John Sr’s legacy. The amount of ripples he has enabled, some he may have witnessed firsthand, yet likely most he’ll never know. Thank you John Sr for everything you poured into this company, the people, and your life that caused so many blessing ripples for others.\n\nHeather Bradshaw, April 12, 2019\n\nCondolences to Gordon family, thoughts and prayers to you all.\n\nSylvain Galipeau, April 12, 2019\n\nI have always admired John’s humility, especially being such a successful man from such a successful family. I always enjoyed the funny videos such as the “WHAT’S UP” that he and Paul did and the one where they were in a rock band. I used to always look forward to seeing those at the Annual Meetings. John will be greatly missed.\n\nBuddy Brown, Springfield Sales Service, April 12, 2019\n\nCondolences to Gordon family, thoughts and prayers to you all…\n\nNeil Labrador, April 12, 2019\n\nI knew John Gordon by the Legacy he and his brother Paul created within GFS. I quickly understood it to be a multi generational approach to leading a good life and how to do business. When looking for the right succession plan for my family business I was blessed to be introduced to Gordon. Lynne and I instantly knew this was the place for my family and our employees for generations to come. Thank you John Gordon.\n\nHoward Halpern, April 11, 2019\n\nI had the opportunity to be interviewed by John and Paul along with my wife Sharon in October 1981. I loved that they thought enough of Sharon to give me an opportunity to serve alongside the Gordon Food Service family for 35 years. We were truly blessed to have John lead this amazing company all these years. A true servant and man of God. Well done, good and faithful servant. Prayers to the entire family.\n\nTom & Sharon Snivley, April 11, 2019\n\nSending prayers of peace and comfort to the entire Gordon Family during this time as we celebrate John’s life. What a legacy! I feel truly honored to have been able to see him around the office and see the joy he brought to many. God bless the Gordon Family.\n\nJess Gholston, April 11, 2019\n\nMy wife and I were very fortunate to spend time with John and Nancy on a trip to the Maritimes that they hosted. I will miss his laugh, his sense of humor and his kindness. I like to think of him and Paul in heaven together sharing stories and laughs with all the souls up there. God Bless you and thank you John.\n\nAlex Agbay, April 11, 2019\n\nMuch love and respect for the Gordon Family and the GFS Team during this time of John’s passing. In sorrow and in hope…\n\nJim Erickson, April 11, 2019\n\nIn Key West, Florida, GFS operates an outlet open to the general public. Without it, the local citizenry would simply not be able to afford quality food products. As tourists there in 2010, my wife and I loved shopping there and still smile whenever we see a GFS truck in our hometown of Calgary, Alberta.

On numerous occasions, I would come into the office Monday morning with a Sysco sugar packet stapled to my cubicle with a simple note: “Todd, we need to get this business” ( the sugar packet would have a restaurant’s name on it). John taught me so much early in my career, on how to build strong customer relationships, the importance of driving results, but also how to celebrate the wins! He would be the first person to send me a note congratulating me on acquiring a new customer or just to celebrate gaining the sugar packet business. Thank you for your incredible leadership and all the great memories. My condolences to the Gordon family.\n\nTodd Baker, April 10, 2019\n\nI read with great interest the many many tributes to this great man and I am in awe of his kindness and exemplary leadership so many people commented on.

My life is been enriched by knowing him and we have certainly lost a legend.\n\nI know where he now resides and I know I will see him again one day in the presence of our Lord and Savior.\n\nDan Cutting, April 10, 2019\n\nI am fortunate to be able to work with various members of the Gordon family on special projects. For many years that included John.

I can’t tell you how encouraging that was for my wife and I. It was like the whole company was wishing for me to overcome my injuries. I have won several awards at Gordon Food Service over my 20+ years with the company and that letter will always be the most prized possession I was given during my time here. I hold it very dear. I want John’s family to know how much I appreciate his being a wise, gracious, humble and generous leader within our company during his lifetime.\n\nMichael Kausch, April 10, 2019\n\nJohn you have left a great legacy behind for future generations of your family to follow.

Many of us were sitting on a tour bus in Fairbanks, Alaska in 2008 on a Gordon’s sponsored trip. John was supposed to be there with us the day before, but had to delay due, coincidentally, to Paul’s passing the previous week. To our delight and surprise, he climbs on the bus, humbly apologizes for “being late,” and begs for our understanding of everything he had going on – albeit unnecessarily. He gave a few words about his brother, and finished by reminding us that Paul could remember the names of everyone he met, but says “In my case, the good Lord did not bless me with that gift, so as I call out your name, come up to the front!” Everyone laughed! I’m not even sure he meant it to be funny, but John had a natural geniality that made him impossible not to like and want to be around. John was a humorous, humble leader, and I will miss seeing his smile and shaking his hand at our food shows.\n\nThey say a person dies twice. Once when they die, and the second time when someone speaks their name for the last time. I have a feeling the name John Gordon Sr. will be around for many years to come.

When I started here just out of high school, one of my jobs was to deliver the mail to employees in the 333 building. We all knew that John wanted his Wall Street Journal as soon as we had it.

I in return introduced myself and he promptly asked me if I had a relative by the name of Bud. I replied yes I did he’s my Great Uncle from up north. John said well that’s nice to know because Bud and I belong to the same hunting club. As years went by being able to say Hi at the annual meetings was special and I always reminded my wife Leslie that John used to hunt with my Dad’s Uncle Bud. Thanks John for your interest in each of us here at Gordon Foods.

I feel blessed to have seen him a few weeks ago.\n\nAlthough business was important, fun was important too. That’s why one of my favorite “legacies” from John and Paul are the funny Annual Meeting videos. I had a chance to view a few of them recently. My favorite video was GFS Rockband. Seeing John walk into Dan’s office wearing jeans, a T-shirt, and winter hat, saying things like “G-dizzle” and “OMG” while texting had me LOL’ing at my desk. It was great to see John have some fun – especially during the blooper reel 😂\n\nHeaven gained a great man this week.

My prayers go out to his friends and family.\n\nDanielle Desjarlais – GFS Home Office, April 9, 2019\n\nJohn Gordon leaves behind a legacy that has touched each and every person that had the privilege of working at Gordon Food Service.

Our sympathies to the Gordon Family.\n\nMike and Martha Zietse, April 9, 2019\n\nI had the opportunity early in my career to have John and Nancy stop into the store I ran. John took the time on his vacation to share with me his passion for the profit sharing plan and his sincere desire that I engage in it. I found it interesting that this was the item he chose to talk with me about. He was so passionate about helping his people. Because of this I felt it became part of my job to discuss with everyone that worked for me about his passion. I can only thank John and the Gordon Family for the influence that have all had on me, my family, and my life.\n\nI pray the family finds Peace in the fact that John won the “Race of Life!”\n\nJ.H., April 9, 2019>\n\nWell done, Well done good and faithful son comes to mind when I think of John.

He was the chief building inspector and always wanted to know just what was happening. He would just shake his head and wondered what his brother Paul would be thinking about this large building. He was a great role model to follow and Boy am I gonna miss him.

One of our last stops was the lobby, and as we were setting up, John Gordon was on his way out. He stopped to listen to us with a big smile on his face. It got me all teary-eyed, thinking what pride this man was probably feeling as he watched the employees working for the company he helped to build as they spread joy to the world.\n\nIt is an honor and a privilege to work for such a principled company with such solid cornerstone values that John Gordon helped formulate.\n\nChris Harrington, April 9, 2019\n\nWe have been business customers of GFS since 2005, and I can honestly say that after 14 yeras of business GFS is the only thing that has ran smoothly the entire time.

RIP sir.\n\nLibbey Qurshi, April 9, 2019\n\nI had the priviledge of spending a weekend with Nancy and John in Calgary in 2004 with the other Persons of the Year. This was truly a weekend to remember.

Since the TX Division moved from Glazier Foods (family owned since 1936) to be a part of GFS 4 years ago, I have heard and learned about the Gordon philosophy and culture, and was ever so elated to be a part of it. But I don’t think I really KNEW what it meant until this week. I’ve noticed a pattern these past few days that I can relate to some of my pastor’s sermons as of late, as we are focusing on the #simplegospel Book of Mark for the better part of a year. What we as coworkers have seen here while sharing stories with each other (teachings/reflections), engaging in group activities (community groups), and meeting new friends/family (following in faith and love) it really blows me away on how much more our company is than what people see on the outside as a purveyor/supplier/distributor. We have something so unique and special with our passion and love for not only our customers, but for each other. I’m truly blessed to have met you all, foremost, and am lucky enough to have been blessed by His grace to work at a company who shares these core values that not only separate us from our competitors, but shows that though faith and works, we can accomplish anything we put not only our minds to, but our hearts as well. Bless you all and thank you again for this amazing reward and opportunity to meet our fellow partners. This has truly been an unbelievable and humbling experience.\n\nMe: “What more could God do?”\n\nPaul: “Far more abundantly than you can ask, think, or imagine.” – Ephesians 3:20\n\nBrandon Scott, April 9, 2019/span>\n\nMy condolences to the Gordon family you are in my thoughts and prayers.\n\nJim Dixon, April 9, 2019\n\nMy thoughts and prayers to the entire Gordon family.

We laughed and he said that it wouldn’t have been the first time he had been hit. He was a true gentleman. Warm thoughts and prayers to his wife and the whole Gordon family.\n\nMarilyn Barton, April 9, 2019\n\nCompassionate, humble, and true.

We taught from books and had developing leaders talk about the importance of being a servant, but these people really needed to look no further than John Gordon as the quintessential servant leader. I will miss seeing him here on earth, but look forward to the time of our heavenly meeting. Praying that the Gordon family feel God’s peace and consolation at this time.\n\nKevin Jurek, Organizational Improvement Solutions, April 9, 2019\n\nTruly sorry for your loss.\n\nHenry Harrison, April 9, 2019\n\nI never had the opportunity to meet John but wished I had .

We clearly looked like campers as we gathered around a local restaurant table. John approached us with a warm greeting, saying hello to everyone and sharing of their traveling adventures.

He is one of the many reasons our company is so successful rest in peace\n\nTodd Clark, April 9, 2019\n\nIn my early days at GFS I always looked forward to the Annual Meeting in Grand Rapids. John and Paul had a great chemistry between them as they gave the company update, announced our profit sharing results, and congratulated the Gold Club and Persons of the Year recipients on stage. It was always unforgettable. They started an on-going tradition of humorous annual meeting videos that has been carried on thru today. I know John was a tough and firm business person but he was also a person of compassion and love for all. He will be missed here on this earth, but is in a better place now.\n\nEarl Biggs, April 9, 2019\n\nMy condolences to the Gordon family. What a wonderful example of true leadership. He lived those Cornerstone Values and set an example for all whom he came in contact with. I didn’t have the pleasure of knowing him on a personal level, but it certainly lit up my day to say hello to him in the hallway of the third floor. Eternal rest grant unto John, o Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him.\n\nKellie Rosekrans, Home Office, April 9, 2019\n\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to the Gordon Family.

Always nice to interact with and a humble man. GFS taught me a lot, about leadership through stewardship that I use today. Rest in peace John Gordon.\n\nScott Lindstrom, April 9, 2019\n\nWhile interviewing for my current position, in June of 2018, I was waiting in the lobby for the interview to start. Mr. Gordon had just come into the office and the receptionist introduced us. He inquired about the position for which I was interviewing and we spoke for appx 10 minutes. He talked about the culture of GFS and how the company has evolved. He also decided to share with me that GFS had to stay innovative and continue to grow. I got pulled back for my interview and I thought it was great that he took the time to visit with me. Quite frankly that would have been enough, however, when I started, more than a month later I again saw him in the lobby on my first and he remembered my name and referred back to our conversation. He challenged me to come in and be the person that contributes to the company.\n\nHe was a great man and a great leader.\n\nWilliam E.

I will forever picture him in a smiley face t-shirt, exclaiming “It’s on my Facebook….” 🙂 May your memories give you solace and may God bless you all at this sorrowful time. My sincere sympathy to the entire Gordon family.\n\nLynn Pomeroy, April 9, 2019\n\nIn high school while doing what seemed to be our normal family protocol of doing summer/winter break jobs here at GFS I was afraid to joke around with John as much as Paul since he would always intimidate me more being the young man I was. Washing his car, helping him move some items around in his house, walking by his office to visit my uncle, many conversations I had with him we would still have a laugh. He would still make fun of me or joke around every time if given the chance but his smile would eventually give it away which always made me feel like family. Being back with GFS again since starting my own family and the growth the company has seen I haven’t been able to see him as much. The many statements I’ve read so far reiterate how humble and Christ-centered his life was while on this earth. Truly an example to follow, my thoughts and prayers are with the family.\n\nBrandon Tuinstra, April 9, 2019\n\nWe would like to extend our Sincerest Sympathy to the Gordon Family.

May the road rise up to meet you, May the wind be always at your back, May the sun shine upon your face and the rains fall soft upon your fields, And until we meet again, May God hold you in the hollow of his hand.\n\nChef Charlie Klinefelter, April 9, 2019\n\nDear Gordon Family, John Sr is a wonderful man with a big smile and a bigger heart.

God bless and rest in peace.\n\nTodd Williams, April 9, 2019\n\nGive him eternal rest, O lord,\n\nAnd may your light shine on him forever.\n\nExecutive Chef, Brian Lehman Bakers of Milford, April 9, 2019\n\nI did only get to meet John one time, and I remember him giving a firm hand shake, his smile, and a “thank you for everything that you do at GFS”.\n\nRIP John, you will be missed.\n\nRick Reed, April 9, 2019\n\nMy condolences to the Gordon family!!
