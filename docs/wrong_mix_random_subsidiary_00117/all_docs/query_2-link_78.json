        "text": "Awarded a Bookstore Book Award by the University of Lethbridge Bookstore\n\n“The twelve chapters of this book take a comprehensive view of diversity in higher education teaching, learning, and assessment. … the author provides substantive and exhaustive bulleted lists in each chapter, a diverse set of highlighted good practice accounts, and a full chapter devoted to higher education teacher development. The book is easy to navigate, written in clear prose … . I would recommend this book highly to teachers and administrators in higher education across the disciplines.” (Joanne Maguire Robinson, Reflective Teaching, 2016)\n\n'This book does highlight the complexities of intercultural teaching and learning and expands the theoretical and practical possibilities. Educators will find most chapters in this book of interest, offering as they do some practical ideas for action, as well as theoretical propositions and sometimes discomforting challenges to our own beliefs and understandings about learning and teaching across cultures in higher education.' - Higher Education Research& Development\n\n'...offers food for thought and action.' - Studies in Higher Education"
