        "text": "There are more than 4,000 athletes in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS and NHL alone. Add all the other sports leagues, and there are thousands of athletes who are eligible for Golf Digest's Best Athlete Ranking. We expanded that list of 100 by contacting each team's communications staff in the four major sports leagues, along with the overall communications leader in other sports leagues. To fill in gaps, we worked with sports agents, sports agencies such as Octagon, Wasserman, Newport Sports Management, Excel, CAA, and Tandem Sports and Entertainment, as well as online search engines and research services of journalistic periodicals. We supplemented that with in-house research and GHIN.com. Some handicaps are estimates from players or representatives. This ranking was compiled in 2018.\n\nJUSTIN VERLANDER\n\n4.1 | Astros pitcher has played in the AT&T Pro-Am at Pebble Beach. He founded the Wins for Warriors Foundation in 2016 to support veterans and the military community and has invited more than 5,000 veteran family members to his suite for games.\n\nSTEPHEN CURRY\n\n0.0 | Golden State superstar competed in the Web.com Tour's Ellie Mae Classic the past two years, shooting 74-74 in 2017 and 71-86 this year. He's a golf fanatic, who partners with PGA Reach to provide scholarships to boys and girls with needs to increase their access to golf, his own golf clothing line with Under Armour and is the executive producer of the ABC miniature golf show, Holey Moley. He has one career ace, with a pitching wedge on the 142-yard third hole at the Ocean Course at Half Moon Bay in California.\n\nRead more about Stephen Curry →\n\nLINDSAY WHALEN\n\n18 | The retiring Minnesota Lynx guard and her husband, former golf pro Ben Greve, are members at Olympic Hills G.C. in Eden Prairie, Minn., where he was sectional-qualifying medalist July 23 to play at the U.S. Amateur at Pebble Beach. A favorite golf outing for Whalen was at Doral in 2013.\n\nDIANA TAURASI\n\n30 | The Phoenix Mercury and former UConn star laughs and calls her handicap an estimate. Golf \"was something that I always watched; I finally got out there,\" she told Golf Digest. \"In the offseason, I try to go at least once or twice a week. I go with my best bud, Todd Troxel—he's kind of my teacher and mentor on the golf course.\" Taurasi's golf highlight? \"Todd usually gives me two strokes, and we play skins on the back nine, and I beat him, and he's pretty much a par golfer, so that was huge for me. That was my highlight. That was probably his lowlight.\" Taurasi adds that she talks to UConn coach Geno Auriemma about golf \"all the time.\"\n\nTONY ROMO\n\n+0.4 | Former Cowboys QB retired to the TV booth and dabbles in pro golf. In March, he shot 77-82 during his PGA Tour debut at the Corales Puntacana Resort & Club Championship. In August, he got to the first stage of Web.com Tour qualifying. He won twice in the summer, including the American Century Championship. Plays at Dallas National G.C., Trinity Forest G.C. and the Four Seasons G. & Sports Club. Was a 3-handicap in our 2015 ranking.\n\nPEYTON MANNING\n\n3.5 | Manning is teaming up with Tiger Woods against Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady for a match to benefit COVID-19 relief on May 24 at Medalist Golf Club. \"Every day I go out thinking, This might be the day I'm gonna shoot a great score,\" Manning says. Peyton and his wife, Ashley, began the PeyBack Foundation in 1999 to promote the future success of disadvantaged youth by assisting programs that provide leadership and growth opportunities for children at risk.\n\nRead more about Peyton Manning→\n\nROBBIE GOULD\n\n3.9 | 49ers kicker plays Medinah C.C. every week in the offseason and each summer hosts the Robbie Gould Celebrity Golf Invitational, which has raised more than $2.6 million for Lurie Children's Hospital. He has been an eight-time participant in the American Century Championship and played in pro-am events on the PGA, Champions and LPGA tours.\n\nGOLDEN TATE\n\n7.6 | Lions WR tells Golf Digest: \"No matter how bad I play, I try to have fun. What do they say? 'A bad day on the course is still better than a good day at the office.' \"\n\nTOM BRADY\n\n8 | The six-time Super Bowl champion and now Tampa Bay Buccaneers QB could be a plus-handicap with a focus on just golf. He recently joined ultra-exclusive Seminole Golf Club, site of the TaylorMade charity game match. Brady will be in a match of his own alongside Phil Mickelson, against Tiger Woods and Peyton Manning, in late May, with proceeds from the match benefitting COVID-19. Pebble Beach is a favorite course, and its CEO, Bill Perocchi, is a favorite playing companion.\n\nJOSH ALLEN\n\n11 | Bills rookie QB played college football at the University of Wyoming and was drafted in the first round. \"The type of throws where I struggle are kind of the underneath patterns where I've got to tone down my arm a little bit. . . . It's like I'm 100 yards out, and I have a 4-iron.\"\n\nSAM DARNOLD\n\n30 | Former USC quarterback, selected by the Jets as the No. 3 overall pick in the NFL draft, says he has just started to pick up the game. He attended the U.S. Open this year at Shinnecock Hills.\n\nNICK SORKIN\n\n+3 | Now with the Worcester Railers of the ECHL, Sorkin qualified for the 2016 U.S. Amateur. Has had his only ace (when he was 18) and holds the course record of 63 at Lakewood C.C. in Maryland from its full 7,119 yards.\n\nDENNY HAMLIN\n\n3.3 | NASCAR veteran is a genuine golf nut. Home course is The Peninsula Club in North Carolina. Also has memberships at three other clubs in the state: River Run C.C., Trump National G.C. and Diamond Creek G.C.\n\nJULIAN GRESSEL\n\n1.2 | Atlanta United midfielder, the 2017 AT&T MLS Rookie of the Year, tweeted this in May: \"Played a round of golf today under par for the first time, and that at East Lake. Solid 69.\"\n\nCHRIS WONDOLOWSKI\n\n9.2 | Forward for San Jose and the U.S. national team, he took part in the Ellie Mae Classic Celebrity Shootout, along with teammates Chris Wehan, Magnus Eriksson and Nick Lima, and is part of the Common Goal Movement. As a national ambassador for the organization, he donates a portion of his salary to Street Soccer USA. He is also an advocate for Native American awareness and recognition, and is a member of the Kiowa tribe of Oklahoma.\n\nWAYNE ROONEY\n\n16 | Englishman plays for the MLS club D.C. United. In the spring, Rory McIlroy credited Rooney for getting his putting on track to win the Arnold Palmer Invitational: \"We were talking about triggers and how you start a putting stroke,\" McIlroy said. \"Rooney, before he hits a free-kick, or before he hits a penalty, he taps his toe on the ground before he actually starts his run-up.\"\n\nKELLY SLATER\n\n2.8 | \"When the waves are no good, we always say the golf course is six to eight feet and offshore,\" the 11-time World Surf League champion tells Golf Digest. He travels the world and takes advantage of the golf scene: favorite course is Kingsbarns in Scotland.\n\nRead more about Kelly Slater →\n\nVINCENT HANCOCK\n\n8.8 | Two-time Olympic gold-medalist in skeet shooting calls his sport \"golf with a shotgun,\" citing the pre-shot routines. Grew up playing golf after he was introduced to the sport by his grandfather at about age 3.\n\nMARK COCKERTON\n\n10.0 | NE Black Wolves lacrosse forward plays golf two to three times weekly, April to October in Canada, and plays golf for the competitive and social aspects. \"You're constantly competing against yourself since it is an individual sport, to shoot the best round possible.\"\n\nKYLE BUCHANAN\n\n10 | San Diego Seals lacrosse forward lives in Ontario. \"You never play as much as you'd like,\" he says, but he plays one to two times weekly during the summer.\n\nJOE KOVACS\n\n12 | The silver-medalist in the shot put at the Rio Olympics tells Golf Digest his handicap \"all depends on where I am in my training for the year. The heavier the lifting training is, the shorter my backswing.\""
