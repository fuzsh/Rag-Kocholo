No.: H39-618/2002E\n\nContents\n\nForeword\n\nAccessibility is among the five principles that are fundamental to Canada's health care system, as described in the Canada Health Act.\n\nBut what is accessibility? What is reasonable access? And when we say \"health care services\", what services are meant? Traditional medical care alone, or care from health professionals other than physicians?\n\nWhat groups of Canadians are not having their health care needs met? How best to try to serve them? What changes are necessary to health care policy, the delivery of health care services and the training of health professionals?\n\nThese and many other questions are explored by the authors of several papers prepared for the Health Care System Division of the Health Policy and Communications Branch of Health Canada, and by the participants of seminars and workshops sponsored by Health Canada.\n\nThe fact is that while Canada ranks among the top nations in the world in terms of the standards of health, this high standard is not shared equally by all sectors of Canadian society.\n\nThe use of health services in Canada is not generally affected by financial barriers such as income. \"Nevertheless,\" wrote the Federal, Provincial and Territorial Committee on Population Health in its second report on the health of Canadians, \"there appear to be persistent language and cultural barriers to the provision and/or the utilization of services in certain circumstances.\"\n\nHealth services-and the barriers to access of these services-function as determinants of health. When health systems fail to provide equitable care, or equitable access to care, they may worsen social disparities and be a factor in lowered health status.\n\nIn 1999, the Health Care System Division of Health Canada undertook an exploration of the issue of equity and responsiveness in terms of access to health care services in Canada. Abridged versions of papers and summary reports of seminars or workshops to date are presented in this publication, and a summary of the recommendations made to date follow.\n\nThis is but a beginning, however, much research and discussion are needed in the months ahead.\n\nOttawa, September 2001\n\nThe opinions expressed in this publication are those of the author and contributors and do not necessarily reflect the official views or policies of Health Canada.\n\nPermission is granted for non-commercial reproduction related to educational or clinical purposes.

Canada's system of universal health insurance has overcome financial barriers to access to health care for all citizens. Nevertheless, there are persistent and troubling, inequities in health status. Aboriginal people suffer from chronic diseases such as diabetes more than the general population; infant mortality rates are twice as high among First Nations communities; and Canadians with low literacy skills are more likely to suffer poor health. Immigrants and refugees encounter difficulties in accessing health services as do marginalized groups such as the poor and homeless.\n\nTo date, the focus of health policy and research in Canada has been on the removal of financial barriers to access, while other barriers to care have not been well explored. There is evidence of different patterns of health care use by certain populations and recognition that these populations face other, non-financial, barriers.\n\nThe underserved populations include Aboriginal people, people who do not speak either of Canada's official languages, people with alternate sexual orientation, immigrants, refugees, ethnically or racially diverse populations, people with disabilities, the homeless, sex trade workers, and people with low incomes.\n\nThe term \"reasonable access\" from the Canada Health Act has not been defined, and there is continuing debate about what services are \"medically necessary\". Factors such as language or cultural barriers or the inappropriateness of services are recognized as contributing to barriers to access to health care, but have not been subject to a comprehensive examination. Health care service utilization has been used as a measure of access, but this may be problematic in that differences in use may or may not indicate equitable access. The data does, however, show disparities in the use of preventive and screening programs by underserved groups. These disparities indicate that some barriers affect the access to health not simply to health services.\n\nThis paper is a review of research related to health service access for underserved groups. A major objective of the report is to propose a framework for describing, categorizing and analyzing the evidence related to underservice of various populations in Canada, with a view to providing a structure for addressing further research needs. The paper focuses on the effect of factors other than income.\n\nThe Underserved\n\nWhile it is acknowledged that certain populations in Canada are underserved, there is no consensus as to what this means. Three concepts are integral to the discussion of service provision to underserved groups: underservice, equity and access.\n\nUnderservice, in this paper, means there is an increased likelihood that individuals who belong to a certain population (and people can belong to more than one) may experience difficulties in obtaining needed care, receive less care or a lower standard of care, experience different treatment by health care providers, receive treatment that does not adequately meet their needs, or that they will be less satisfied with health care services than the general population.\n\nAn underserved population differs from an underserved region. The issue of service provision for underserved areas is largely one of supply and distribution of service and personnel, while the issues of undeserved populations pertain more to access.\n\nEquity in health means the fair and just distribution of resources. Not everyone receives the same service, or the same number of services, but the service provided is based on need.\n\nAccess is more than the availability of services; access assumes that services are provided in a way that is responsive to the needs of the health care system users, and is open to participation in the planning of those services by underserved groups.\n\nBarriers to access can be described in four categories: availability of services, financial barriers, non-financial barriers to presentation of health care needs, and barriers to equitable treatment.\n\nThe First Nations and Aboriginal peoples face serious problems. First Nations communities have problems related to availability of some services such as home care or mental health services, however, they may face fewer financial barriers to non-insured services because they are eligible to benefits through the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch. Aboriginal people living off-reserve have the same availability of services as other Canadians but face significant barriers to presentation of need for health care services as well as equitable treatment.\n\nImmigrant populations demonstrate diversity in both health status and access issues. Often, health issues for immigrant and visible minority populations are combined, though different factors may affect access. Generally, newcomers to Canada do not face difficulties with availability of services, but they do encounter barriers to presentation of need. Immigrants may not be familiar with the Canadian system and may not understand what their rights to service are, what the roles of providers are, or what expectations of them are. For many, this gap is exacerbated by a lack of fluency in either English or French. Immigrants have also been shown to underuse preventive services and may be at risk for misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. Refugees have another set of special needs. Both immigrant and visible minority clients may face barriers to equitable treatment.\n\nFour populations face barriers due to language: Aboriginal people, immigrants, people who use visual or sign language, and, depending on the location of residence, people who do not speak one of Canada's official languages. Historically, research has focused on general definitions of ethnicity, rather than the specific issue of ability to communicate in the language of the service providers. There is evidence that language itself, not ethnicity or socio-economic factors, may explain many differences in service utilization and health outcomes. Low literacy has been linked to lower health status and differences in access and utilization.\n\nPeople of alternate sexual orientation come from all sectors of society and, as a group, are not at any greater risk for decreased health status due to socio-economic factors. Nevertheless, their health needs and concerns may differ from those of the heterosexual population. For example, the \"coming out\" process has been identified as critical for which support is rarely available. The health system has played a role in pathologizing alternate sexual orientation. Research indicates that some individuals may hesitate to seek health care, fearing negative reactions to disclosure; confidentiality is also a key concern.\n\nPersons with disabilities come from all ethnic and cultural groups and they also face diverse barriers to access depending on the type of disability. Physical barriers may prevent the disabled from presenting for care, and a combination of socio-economic factors may present financial barriers. The attitudes of providers often present the greatest barriers.\n\nPopulations that are marginalized include the homeless, the mentally ill, street youth, injection drug users and sex trade workers. While these groups have diverse needs, they share similar issues in relation to access to care. Many have multiple risk factors. The homeless, for example, have problems with availability of services; many have no identification or a provincial health plan card, so are unable to access services to which they are entitled.\n\nIn spite of the variation in health status and the types of barriers experienced by the various underserved groups, there is a remarkable similarity in many of the concerns identified. Those who belong to more than one underserved group-for example, someone who is poor and female and living in an isolated area-may be described as facing a greater degree of difficulty.\n\nPotential Responses for Improving Access for Underserved Populations\n\nA number of different responses are required to address barriers to care for underserved populations. These responses can be described under three headings: Recruitment and Training, Program Design and Delivery, and, Policy and Structure.\n\nRecruitment includes both preservice and post- training initiatives. There are a number of programs that facilitate access to professional training for members of underserved groups. This strategy is of particular importance for Aboriginal communities. One example of a post-training initiative is the licensing of international medical graduates (IMGs). However, this has been a difficult and controversial area, and this response, in isolation, is not anticipated to have a significant impact on access needs.\n\nRecent studies have indicated that while a number of initiatives to address needs for cultural competence training for health professionals have been introduced, more attention to promoting social accountability of medical schools is required. This is one area that has the potential to improve access for a number of underserved groups. The development of alternate health roles is another strategy that has potential both to address access needs, and to facilitate the participation of members of underserved communities in the health care system.\n\nAcademic health centres and other educational institutions play an important role in educating health professionals. There is a potential for a greater role in promotion of diversity training, development of training of alternate health professionals, and promoting research with underserved communities. They could also be given more responsibility for service provision to underserved groups.\n\nProgram Design and Delivery initiatives include \"linking\" programs, population-specific health programs, and telemedicine applications. Linking programs include health interpretation and, community outreach and education programs. Interpretation programs are essential to ensure access to health care for language minorities, however few health jurisdictions have implemented policy requiring professional interpretation services. Community outreach and education programs have an important role in addressing barriers to initial access and in ensuring quality of care. However, they may not address underlying organizational barriers to access. Another response is provision of population specific services. Several innovative programs focusing on Aboriginal people, persons with disabilities, immigrants, or homeless and low-income populations have been developed.\n\nTelemedicine applications show promise in addressing access issues for rural and remote locations. First Nations communities are among those who may experience the most benefit. The National First Nations Telehealth Project is evaluating implementation of a number of telehealth projects now underway. Research related to telemedicine applications indicates good results for both diagnostic accuracy and patient/provider acceptance. However, few studies have addressed issues of cost effectiveness. The potential for telemedicine to address linguistic or cultural barriers or support persons with disabilities has not been well explored.\n\nIssues related to funding and provider payment models have a significant impact on underserved communities. The fee-for-service system has been of limited effectiveness in ensuring population coverage of preventive and screening programs; an area of identified concern for many underserved populations. Community health centres have often demonstrated greater ability to provide service to underserved populations. This is due both to their commitment to community accountability and to greater flexibility in hiring and program design. However, capitation payment systems may present additional access problems for underserved communities unless safeguards are built into the system.\n\nBarriers to organizational access, (the degree to which consumers are represented and participate in planning, research and administration) must be addressed. This includes development of policy related to cultural diversification, flexibility of program delivery models, and implementation of strategies to ensure the participation of underserved communities at the decision-making level.\n\nIn spite of the diversity of barriers experienced by underserved populations, many of the responses that are recommended to address these barriers are similar. Many of the strategies are anticipated to result in improved service provision for the general population and have already been identified as priorities through the health reform process.\n\nRapid changes in the health care delivery system risk creating additional difficulties in access to equitable care for underserved populations. Attention to access issues faced by underserved communities is therefore of particular importance at this time.\n\nSection 1: Introduction\n\nThe intent of this paper is to provide an overview and analysis of the issue of access to, and provision of, health services for underserved populations in Canada. For the purposes of this paper, \"underserved populations\" are understood to include Aboriginal people, official language minorities, those of alternative sexual orientations (gay, lesbian, bisexual, two-spirited, transgendered, and transsexual) immigrants, refugees, ethnically or racially diverse populations, persons with disabilities, the homeless, sex trade workers, and low income segments of the population.Footnote 1\n\nBackground\n\nCanada ranks well above other countries in most measures of population health. Canada's system of universal health insurance, considered one of the best in the world, has largely addressed financial barriers to access to health care for all citizens. However, persistent and troubling inequities in health status remain (Federal, Provincial and Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health, 1999). There is also evidence of different patterns of health care use by certain populations and non-financial barriers to access for certain underserved groups.\n\nIt is recognized that many factors influence health. These \"determinants\" of health include living and working conditions, the physical environment, health services, early childhood development, social support, personal health practices and coping skills, and biology and genetic endowment (Federal, Provincial and Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health, 1994). However, in addition to these factors, gender, culture, and membership in specific population groups also have significant effects on health status (Federal, Provincial and Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health, 1999).\n\nUnderstanding the determinants of health has helped explain why certain groups of people are healthier than others, and how the social and economic environment affects health. Initially, this directed attention to the relationship between income and health status, and income and health service utilization. Research on these topics has confirmed that in Canada, use of health services is not related to a person's income (Federal, Provincial and Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health, 1999).\n\nMore recently, we have come to understand that some populations experience more negative effects on their health due not only to lower economic status but also to social factors such as racism, loss of social status and social isolation. These psycho-social factors can exert a powerful influence on physical and mental health, likely a greater effect than material poverty alone. Societies with the greatest disparities have lower health status than societies of similar wealth but where disparities are less (Wilkinson, 1996; Lavis and Stoddart, 1999). This situation spurs us to investigate further the effect of these psycho-social factors on health and the impact of factors other than explicit financial barriers which may affect access to health services.\n\nThe purpose of a population health approach is to maintain and improve the health status of the population as a whole, reducing inequities in health status between groups. Reducing inequities in health status will be one the greatest challenges to achieving population health (Federal, Provincial and Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health, 1999). The recognition of the importance of societal factors in contributing to health and illness has increased awareness that there are limitations to the ability of health care to achieve a healthy population. However, there will always be a need for health services, both to treat the sick and injured, and to provide information and services which prevent disease and promote health. Health services themselves (and access barriers to them) function as important determinants of health. Health systems that fail to provide equitable care have the potential to exacerbate social disparities and contribute to lower health status. To date, the focus of health policy and research in Canada has been the removal of financial barriers to access; other barriers to care have not been well explored.\n\nScope and Limitations of the Report\n\nThis review identified a paucity of published research related to health service access for underserved groups, and a lack of clarity of concepts related to the topic. A major objective of this report will therefore be to propose a framework for describing, categorizing, and analyzing the evidence related to underservice of various populations in Canada, with a view to providing a structure for addressing further research needs.\n\nWhile recognizing the importance of research related to income and health service access, the paper will focus on the effect of factors other than income. The issue of workforce supply for rural and remote regions is the topic of a companion report and will not be addressed here. However, geographic barriers are not separate and distinct from other barriers to access, but inter-related. Those from underserved populations who happen to live in underserved geographic regions will likely face greater difficulties than those who live in better resourced regions (Ryan et al., 2000; Baker, 1993). The discussion will not be limited to provision of physician and hospital services, but will include other primary care and disease prevention/health promotion activities. Many of these programs and services, necessary components of a comprehensive population health approach, are provided by other health care professionals, or fall outside of the formal health care system.\n\nThe literature review draws on a number of sources. Key summary documents (Federal, Provincial and Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health, 1999; Health Canada, 1999; Kinnon, 1999; Ryan et al., 2000) were important in developing the overview of health status and needs. Also included in the scan was an Internet search of government documents, university research centre publications, key organizations, and reports and abstracts from Metropolis and the Women's Health Centres of Excellence. A data base search through Medline and Healthstar was undertaken, focusing on Canadian research related to Health Services Accessibility. This was supplemented by an expanded search related to key concepts, specific underserved groups, and identified barriers, and by a review of the bibliographies of key resources identified through the initial scan.\n\nTime constraints, and the number of different populations and domains of interest, did not allow for a se arch of additional databases, the opportunity to follow up on all resources, or to contact organizations or researchers directly. As the review found that much of the information on access barriers from the community perspective is found in the \"grey\" rather than the published literature, many more resources may be available than were identified through this initial scan. The number of populations addressed also limits the ability of this report to capture the complexity of the access issues facing each population, or the interaction between various types of underservice and issues such as gender, income, or place of residence.\n\nThe next section will provide a brief discussion of the context of provision of health services in Canada, particularly as it relates to the issues of supply and access, and will further discuss terms and concepts related to access to health care. Section 3 provides an overview of general research issues and methodological limitations related to research on non-financial barriers to access. Section 4 summarizes what is known about various types of underservice in Canada for a number of underserved populations. Finally, in Section 5, potential responses to issues of underservice are reviewed.\n\nSection 2: Context and Concepts\n\nContext of Health Service Provision\n\nAny health care system is an outgrowth of the political culture, the social and moral values and the economic imperatives of the society it services. One cannot make neat distinctions between the legal, ethical, clinical, political and economic factors which all play a role in shaping the country's health care system. (Canadian Bar Association Task Force on Health Care, 1994:1).\n\nCanada's system of universal health insurance grew out of a commitment to removing financial barriers to health care for all Canadians. The ongoing development of this system, and delivery of services, take place within a political system where responsibility for most health services falls under provincial/territorial jurisdiction, but is supported by the federal government, and directed by the principles of the Canada Health Act (CHA).\n\nCanada provides universal medical coverage to all its citizens under the terms of the Canada Health Act (1984). The Canada Health Act is based on five principles: universality, portability, accessibility, comprehensiveness, and public administration. It states that the \"primary objective of Canadian Health Policy is to protect, promote, and restore the physical and mental well-being of residents of Canada and to facilitate reasonable access to health services without financial or other barriers\". As a nation Canada is therefore committed both to health promotion and protection (keeping people healthy), and to restoring well-being (treating them when they are not healthy).\n\nHowever, because access is not defined, it is not clear what would be required to show access was reasonable. Most often access has been defined simply as the absence of explicit financial barriers. Universality requires that 100% of the residents of a province be entitled to insured services on uniform terms and conditions. Comprehensiveness is the requirement that the health insurance plan of a province cover all \"insured health services provided by hospitals, medical practitioners or dentists, and where the law of a province so permits, similar or additional services rendered by other health care practitioners.\" All services \"medically necessary for the purpose of maintaining health, preventing disease or diagnosing or treating injury, illness or disability\" are included; however, there has been continuing debate about what services are \"medically necessary\".\n\n\"Extended health services\", which include home care, nursing home and adult residential care, and ambulatory care service are also included in the Act. However, provinces are not required to provide these services, and some payment for accommodation in residential facilities may be required. At present, availability and coverage of extended health services varies markedly between provinces and territories.\n\nAt the time the language of the original legislation was developed (the Canada Health Act was based on two earlier pieces of legislation, the 1957 Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act and the 1966 Medical Care Act), it was expected that most care would be delivered in hospitals and by physicians. The restriction of insured services to \"medically necessary services\" provided by hospitals and physicians has skewed subsequent patterns of service delivery in Canada. It has reinforced the position of acute care and institutional services at the expense of community and preventive services, and defined care by who provides it, and where it takes place, rather than whether care is needed (Hurley et al., 1996). While a population health approach results in a focus on providing services in the community and treating sick people at home, this trend has the effect of \"off-loading\" expenses from the publicly funded system to third party payers or to individuals. Inequities in provision of non-insured services, which include dental services, vision correction, prescription drugs and counselling or mental health services, have been highlighted as an area of growing concern (Federal, Provincial and Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health, 1999). Canadians who do not have supplementary insurance coverage (through employee plans or social assistance programs, for example) may not be able to afford some services. Some services, such as health outreach or education programs provided outside of the formal health system, are not insured services and so do not fall under the scope of the Act. These initiatives form a crucial component of a comprehensive system that addresses the need to promote and protect, as well as restore, health.\n\nProvincial/Federal Authority\n\nThe \"Canadian Health System\" is not a federal health system; rather, it is a collection of provincial systems. Provinces and territories are responsible for the planning, administration and delivery of health services. However, there is a national plan in that all provincial and territorial plans are linked through adherence to national principles set at a federal level. Provincial and territorial plans must meet certain criteria to qualify for full transfer payments from the federal government. The federal government also retains responsibility for certain populations and health services; two of these are health care to registered First Nations and Inuit people, and to refugee claimants.\n\nProvision of Health Care to Aboriginal People in Canada\n\nThe term Aboriginal describes all indigenous peoples of Canada, and includes First Nations peoples (previously referred to as Indians) registered under the Indian Act (Registered Indians), North American Indians not registered under the Indian Act, Inuit and Metis. Aboriginal persons are covered for hospital and medical costs by provincial health insurance plans in the same way as other Canadians. However, registered Indians and Inuit (who are not divided into status or non-status categories) are also eligible for health programs administered by the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch of Health Canada.\n\nRelative responsibilities of the federal and provincial governments are poorly defined. Shared responsibility has been the source of confusion and ongoing debate since the British North America Act defined health care as a provincial responsibility and \"general care of Indians\" as a federal responsibility. Historically, the federal government has had a special responsibility for health care for A boriginal people. In 1979, the Indian Health Policy established a framework for delivery of Indian and Inuit health programs. This policy acknowledged the \"special relationship of Indian people to the federal government'\" and recognized the importance of socio-economic, cultural and spiritual development in addressing underlying causes of poor health.\n\nThe federal government and Aboriginal peoples disagree on health care as a treaty right. The position of the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) is that health is a treaty right, and an element of First Nations' inherent right to self-government. The AFN also maintains that provision of health services is an area of undefined federal fiduciary obligation. The federal government has agreed to provide health care to First Nations and Inuit people where this would not otherwise be available, which excludes off-reserve Aboriginal peoples from federal health services and programs. Additional services through Health Canada are provided through the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch, and are available only to Registered Aboriginals (not to non-registered Aboriginals or Metis). This has led to disparity in the type and extent of coverage of Aboriginal persons by status.\n\nIn 1986, the Health Transfer Program was initiated; the intent was to transfer control of federal Indian health services to First Nations people themselves. Transfer is to occur within the existing legal framework and funding base. As of March 1998, 74% of First Nations communities were involved at some level in the process of transfer, with 31% of these having signed transfer agreements (Health Canada, 1999). The health transfer process places the discussion of health services for First Nations peoples within a different context from that of other communities, and has important implications for the issue of access to health care.\n\nRefugee Claimants\n\nPrior to 1994, refugee claimantsFootnote 2 to Canada were not eligible for heath care coverage, although some provinces had made some arrangements for care. The Interim Federal Health Program, administered by Citizenship and Immigration Canada, is intended to ensure emergency and essential health services for needy refugee claimants and those refugees in Canada who are not yet covered by provincial health plans.\n\nRights to Access\n\nIn the discussion of access to health care by underserved populations, the human rights legislation of a country must also be considered. In Canada there have been few challenges to interpretation of access as simply the absence of explicit financial barriers to health care. Claims involving rights of access to health care are principally based on interpretations of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Canadian Human Rights Act, provincial human rights acts, and the Canada Health Act. A recent ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada found that absence of communication resulted in substandard care and determined that hospitals were required to provide interpreters for deaf patients (Eldridge v. British Columbia [Attorney General], 1997). There are also requirements that facilities be physically accessible to persons with disabilities.\n\nCultural Context\n\nThe establishment of Canada's system of universal health insurance was part of a larger commitment to social welfare programs. These programs grew out of a philosophy of mutual aid and a willingness to protect the less fortunate. The health system not only removes financial barriers, but also becomes part of the environment of social support.\n\n\"Underserved populations\" in Canada are a number of different constituencies which experience a range of potential problems with access. They may be served by different organizations and government departments, and may have different rights to access under the law. Even where issues of concern may be similar (e.g. discrimination or language access to health services) there may not be joint action, or consensus on the best solutions by the different constituencies. While the discussion of Aboriginal health services takes place within the context of the right to self determination of First Nations peoples, the issues facing immigrants and refugees are often seen as \"newcomer\" issues that will resolve with time. Similarly, issues of access of gay, lesbian and bisexual persons, or of persons with disabilities are also often seen as \"separate\" issues, and of concern to different stakeholders.\n\nThe Impact of Health Reform\n\nCanada's health system, like that of most countries, has undergone significant restructuring over the past several years, mainly in response to concerns about escalating health care costs. Actions taken to contain costs have resulted in concerns about equity, concerns that resource allocations should be made consistent with the needs of populations, and concerns that inequitable distribution of health care resources is resulting in geographically remote and socially disadvantaged groups having less access to appropriate care.\n\nMany provinces have undertaken commissions to review health care systems. A number of recurring themes have emerged from such reviews. These include: broadening the definition of health; shifting the emphasis from curing illness to health promotion and disease prevention and from institutional to community care; increasing opportunities for participation of consumers; regionalization; improved human resource planning (with an emphasis on alternative remuneration for physicians); increased coordination of services,; increased funding for health services research; and evidence based decision making (Mhartre and Debber, 1992; Hutchinson and Abelson, 1996; Closson and Catt, 1996).\n\nResponding to these issues may improve service to underserved populations, but the issue of access has not been addressed. Issues of concern to diverse and disadvantaged groups may in fact be lost in the restructuring process. For example, regionalization, (the devolution of care to smaller health authorities), has been proposed as a potential benefit to vulnerable populations. By moving decision making closer to the health care user, in theory, services should become more responsive to local needs. However, there are several challenges.\n\nUnderserved populations have not traditionally been adequately represented in decision making structures.\n\nData collection systems do not collect data in a way which assists in identifying or measuring needs of underserved groups.\n\nThere is an inadequate research base on non-financial access barriers, or needs of underserved groups, resulting in neglect of these issues in planning.\n\nTraditional funding patterns have resulted in\n\n\"access\" services being excluded from core funding.\n\nA cost containment emphasis results in reluctance to identify need for additional programs.\n\nEffects of health care restructuring have focused public concern and planning responses on what are perceived to be more pressing issues (e.g., waiting lists, hospital closures).\n\nA major emphasis in heath reform has been to ensure that health care costs can be maintained at sustainable levels. Adoption of a population health approach has focused attention to the need to shift the emphasis within current services towards prevention, shift funding within the system to more \"upstream\" services, and to address the underlying causes of ill health. In reality, however, many community-based programs focusing on disease prevention and health promotion have experienced the same financial cutbacks as acute care services. These programs, which provide services such as health interpretation or preventive health education, play a leading role in facilitating access for underserved gr ou ps.\n\nIt is not clear how emerging concerns about general health access (waiting lists, private clinics, early hospital discharge, or access to home care services) may affect populations who are already considered underserved. However, because membership in many such groups is correlated with lower economic status (and/or lower levels of social support), it is to be expected that these populations may bear a disproportionate burden of any decreased availability of service.\n\nDefining Access and Underservice\n\nWhile there is widespread recognition that certain populations within Canadian society are underserved, there is no consensus on what this means. Three concepts that are integral to the discussion of service provision to underserved groups are \"underservice\", \"equity\" and \"access\".\n\nDefining Underservice\n\nUnderservice is defined by various writers in different ways, and may be used to describe problems with service availability, service access, or the quality of treatment obtained. In this paper, underservice refers to an increased likelihood that individuals will, because of their membership in a certain population: experience difficulties in obtaining needed care; receive less, or a lower standard of care; experience differences in treatment by health personnel; receive treatment that does not adequately recognize their needs; or, be less satisfied with health care services.\n\nMany underserved populations share the characteristics of lower income and social disadvantage. The evidence for the effect of these determinants on health status has been the subject of extensive study and will not be the focus of discussion here. However, underserved populations cannot be defined by low income alone. Some underserved populations (e.g. the homeless) are not only poor, but of low social status. They may present with health conditions which are not as well managed by the formal health system (e.g. mental health disorders or substance use). They are at risk for decreased health status, and are likely to face non-financial barriers to health care access as well as discriminatory treatment within society as a whole and the health system. Members of other groups (such as visible minorities, gay, lesbian and bisexual) may face inequitable treatment by the health care system, even if they are not of low economic status. Not all members of underserved groups are poor or less educated, indicating the importance of other barriers that may be independent of socioeconomic factors.\n\nA person may share characteristics with one or several groups defined as underserved. People of lower socioeconomic status and who are underserved for some other reason are further jeopardized. The provision of basic insured services in Canada does not appear related to income, but there are \"persistent language and cultural barriers to the provision and/or the utilization of services in certain circumstances.\" (Federal, Provincial and Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health, 1999, p.145) The interaction between these factors may present further barriers to equitable care.\n\nUnderserved Populations and Underserved Regions\n\nAddressing inequities experienced by underserved populations is a fundamentally different issue than ensuring equitable distribution of the \"same\" resources across geographic regions. The issue of service provision for \"underserved areas\" is by and large an issue of supply and distribution of health personnel and services, while the issues facing underserved populations are more a problem of access. Underservice due to geographic location, and underservice due to membership in a specific population differ in a number of ways: the factors contributing to the problem of underservice, the actual problems of \"access\" which result, strategies for measuring need, the scope of effect of the access barriers, and potential solutions.\n\nDefining Equity\n\nEquity in health refers to the fair and just distribution of resources. The concept of equity differs from that of equality; the measure of health care equity is not that every one receives the same service, or the same number of services, but that the service provided is based on need. In Canada, equity is generally described as \"equal access (or equal service) for equal need\". It is recognized that those who are sicker, or face greater risk to health, should receive a greater intensity of service, and it follows that lower income groups should receive more services. While care in Canada is related to need, not income, the question has been raised as to how much more care those of lower health status should receive compared to those in better health. Some writers have suggested that while more services are provided to those at the lowest income level, the differential does not necessarily correspond with observed differences in health status (Roos et al., 1999). More research is needed in this area.\n\nSimply providing equal service for equal need may not be sufficient to achieve equity. This is best illustrated by example. If an institution is responsible for food service provision, equality is achieved if all consumers receive the same quantity and quality of food. However, if the menu is steak and some of the consumers are vegetarians, equal service is not equitable service, which most would agree would involve the provision of a quality vegetarian meal.\n\nDefining Access\n\nAccess is another concept that has received various interpretations by policy makers, researchers, and the general public (Birch and Abelson, 1993). The Oxford dictionary defines accessibility as \"capable of being used, entered or reached\", and as \"open to the influence of \". This implies that access is more than the availability of services. It assumes provision of services in a way that is both responsive to the needs of users and open to the participation in planning of services by underserved groups.\n\n\"Barriers to access\" can relate to client access (the degree to which individuals are able to secure needed services), and to organizational access (the extent to which consumers are represented and/or participate in the planning, development, delivery and administration of services (Doyle and Visano, 1987). With the exception of initiatives to transfer control and administration of health services to First Nations communities, and the Independent Living movement, discussion on access for underserved populations tends to focus on issues of client, rather than organizational access.\n\nIn the literature, access is variously defined as \"availability of service\", \"use of health care by individuals with a need for care\" (Waters, 2000), or \"equal quality of care received\". In regard to distribution of physician and hospital services, reasonable access is generally understood to mean equal access for equal need, and the absence of explicit financial barriers. The focus on explicit financial barriers to care, and by extension, on utilization of care related to income status, has resulted in neglect of other potential factors, which may impair access. It has been observed that \"lack of attention to other non-price factors that might be expected to influence the demand for and/or the supply of care appears to imply that service provision free at the point of delivery is a sufficient condition for \"reasonable access\" to services.\" (Birch et al., 1996, p.6.) However, there has been increasing awareness that \"accessibility\" must be defined more broadly than this. For example, the Panel on Health Goals for Ontario (1987) stated:\n\n\"All residents of Ontario have the right to high quality, accessible, appropriate and comprehensive health services independent of age, gender, level of functional ability, language, ethnocultural origin or geographical location. ... Accessibility should be understood to include psychological, social, emotional and economic aspects\" (p. 87).\n\nHistorically, the focus has been on providing equal access to treatment; the adoption of a population health approach, however, means we need to look at the importance of barriers to assessment (Culyer, 1991). If barriers reduce the likelihood that certain populations can be assessed and receive an accurate diagnosis, then provision of treatment on an equitable basis once a need is identified is insufficient.\n\nPhysician and hospital services are the core insured services in Canada, and the focus of measures of access and equity. The most common focal point for delivery of health services in Canada is the family physician. These primary care physicians also function in the important role as \"gatekeepers\" to other health services including specialist and hospital care. The population health approach suggests that while important, access to physicians or hospitals alone may not be an adequate measure of service access. Key preventive, continuing care, and education/support services are provided in the community and by other health professionals and organizations. Access to these services must also be considered in any comprehensive review of access.\n\nMooney et al. (1991) observe that in Canada, it is not clear whether the objective of equity relates to utilization or access. There is confusion then about whether equity is defined by receipt of care, or by opportunity to utilize care (access). In the discussion of equity and access, it is important to consider that the purpose of health policy is not to provide health services but to achieve the best possible health of the population. The ultimate goal then is access to health, not simply access to health services.\n\nEquitable access can then be defined as provision of health services in a way that provides an equal opportunity for all citizens to achieve maximum health. The following section outlines a framework for discussion of factors that may act as barriers to this goal.\n\nA Framework for Describing Access and Access Barriers\n\nThis section provides a framework for categorizing the various types of difficulties experienced by underserved populations in accessing health care services. These difficulties (or barriers) can be described in the following categories: availability of services; financial barriers; non-financial barriers to presentation of need; and, equitable quality of care.\n\nAvailability of Services\n\nOne aspect of access is availability of service. Individuals may not have \"access\" because:\n\na health service may be unavailable because it is not insured under medicare;\n\na health service may be funded, but long waiting lists mean it is not available when needed;\n\na service may not be available on an equitable basis due to geographic factors (provincial/territorial differences, or issues of rural/remote supply).\n\nThese three commonly used definitions of access are not the focus of this paper. No health system has the resources to provide an unlimited number of services, so services deemed as less necessary will be uninsured. \"De-insuring\" of services may not pose a challenge to equitable provision of services, as long as all are treated equally.\n\nThe issue of waiting lists for many medical procedures, (currently a common focus of the public discussion on access) may not result in inequitable access, as there is little evidence to date that members of \"underserved populations\" face longer waiting times than other patients. However, there is public recognition that \"private\" (i.e., fee-for-service) clinics to address waiting lists raises serious concerns about equitable access by introducing financial barriers to some insured services. Regional shortages of primary care physicians may also have an effect; research indicates that Canadians who do not have a regular family physician are less likely to receive primary or specialist care (Dunlop et al., 2000). If physician shortages have a disproportional effect on underserved populations, this would be considered an aspect of inequitable service.\n\nWhile the significant problem of health service provision to rural and remote areas is not the focus of this paper; it is important to recognize that both income and membership in an underserved group, interact in direct and indirect ways with geographic barriers. This can place vulnerable groups at even greater disadvantage.\n\nFinancial Barriers\n\nThe second category of access barriers relates to explicit financial barriers. In other words,\n\na service may be available, but there may be monetary costs associated with its use.\n\nThis category can be subdivided as follows: a) explicit financial barriers to insured health services, b) explicit financial barriers to uninsured services, and c) other financial costs associated with access.\n\nThere is increasing concern that universally insured services may be eroding. The growth of private clinics for some medical procedures in some provinces has also raised a high level of public concern that a two-tier level of medical care may be emerging. Clearly, people in lower income levels will have fewer options under this system; underserved populations are disproportionately represented among lower socioeconomic groups.\n\nWhile it is generally accepted that financial barriers to insured services have been removed in Canada, disparity is growing in access to non-insured services. Many Canadians with low or moderate incomes have limited or no access to health services such as eye care, dentistry, mental health counselling and prescription drugs (Federal, Provincial and Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health, 1999). Underserved groups may also face greater difficulties in meeting the indirect financial costs related to health care utilization. These costs include child care, transportation or unpaid time off work for medical appointments. Certain groups are more likely to face these barriers, and while it is not feasible to calculate such indirect costs of utilization, \"accessible\" services must address issues such as location and hours of operation.\n\nNon-Financial Barriers to Presentation of Need\n\nThe focus on income-related barriers to access has resulted in relative neglect of non-financial barriers to care, including barriers that prevent patients from achieving first contact with health care services (and thus presenting for assessment). Barriers in this category can prevent equitable access even if providers are committed to providing equitable service upon presentation of need.\n\nA service may be available, but linguistic barriers, inaccessible facilities or other barriers may result in a patient being unable to present for care.\n\nPotential users may not be aware that a service is available, rights to service, or how to access the service (information barriers).\n\nIndividuals may not request services because, even though they are aware of them, they are not aware of (or do not believe in) their importance (cultural or education barriers).\n\nAlthough services are available to all, practices related to delivery discourage utilization by certain populations.\n\nThis category of barriers has a significant impact on awareness of, and participation in, preventive and health promotion programs. Provision of preventive information is much broader in scope than that of physician care and includes information obtained through the media and community events. Langu age an d cultural barriers, as well as lower literacy, are correlated not only with decreased participation in preventive programs, but also with lack o f awareness of risk, lifestyle interventions, warning signs, and benefits of screening. Barriers to presentation of need tend to lead to a situation where utilization of services may be \"acute care driven\", rather than based on regular or preventive care.\n\nBarriers to Equitable Treatment\n\nEven if individuals present for care, they may encounter barriers to equitable treatment.\n\nCommunication/cultural barriers may result in misdiagnosis/inappropriate treatment.\n\nRights of confidentiality and informed consent may not be protected.\n\nService utilization may be discouraged or refused for certain populations.\n\nDifferent treatment may be prescribed based on group membership.\n\nProvider-patient interaction may differ based on group membership.\n\nPolicies may not recognize the needs of certain populations.\n\nProgram design may result in the needs of some groups being better served than others.\n\nThere may be less expertise related to health conditions of, or treatment efficacy for, some groups.\n\nEach is a potentially serious barrier to equitable access to care. Communication is an essential component of health care. One of the most dramatic forms of communication barriers has been found in situations where patients cannot speak the same language as their health care providers. Without adequate communication there is an increased risk of \"miscommunication, misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment, reduced patient comprehension and compliance, clinical inefficiency, decreased provider and patient satisfaction, malpractice injury, and death.\" (Office of Minority Health, 1999). Inadequate communication precludes the negotiation of informed consent and so results in risks to both patient and provider (Tang, 1999; Kaufert and Putsch, 1997; Stevens, 1993b). Cultural differences may also contribute to miscommunication.\n\nIt is also possible that members of underserved communities may be prescribed different treatment, depending on their membership in a specific population. Even if the technical level of care provided is \"equal\", attitudes and behaviour demonstrated by providers may result in lower quality of care. Such barriers may be described by community members as \"racism\", \"ethnocentrism\", \"homophobia\", or \"ableism\"; and by service providers as lack of \"cultural competence\". The issue of trust in the provider/client relationship has been explored in detail (Kaufert and O'Neil, 1998), as have issues of communication (Stewart, 1995). Poor communication and low trust have been linked to decreased patient satisfaction, lower levels of compliance, subsequent patterns of health service utilization and treatment outcomes. Therefore, discrimination in any form can be expected to result in poorer health outcomes.\n\nPolicies may not address the needs of certain clients, or may create conditions that result in lower quality of care. Absence of appropriate policy can have the same impact as inappropriate policy. For example, failure to require professional interpreters results in lack of protection for patient rights to informed consent.\n\nTwo additional aspects of access are more complex and difficult to address: the way services are structured and the knowledge base on which assessment and treatment is based. The way services are structured and the priority given to various types of services reflects both the historical development of the health system and the beliefs and preferences of current administrators and policy makers. Members of underserved groups have historically been underrepresented in these areas, so services do not necessarily reflect their needs, interests or priorities. Barriers arising from these inherent characteristics of service provision (often referred to as \"lack of appropriate services\") may result in programs and services not meeting the needs of certain populations. Such barriers can include such varied factors as:\n\n9-5 office hours;\n\nan environment which is experienced as intimidating or insensitive;\n\nroutine inclusion of practices which are not acceptable to the identified population ;\n\nphysically inaccessible facilities;\n\nlack of expertise related to specific experiences, beliefs, needs or preferences;\n\nlack of interpretation services;\n\nfailure to provide services which are an essential component of needed care from the clients perspective (e.g. areas for smudging ceremonies, culturally acceptable food).\n\nIt has also been documented that ethnic and language minorities have not been well represented in health research, ranging from population health surveys to clinical trials (Cotton, 1990; Frayne et al., 1996; Roberson, 1994; Anderson, 1993). While it is acknowledged that there may be significant differences between populations in risk of disease, prevalence of health conditions and response to treatment (Harrison, 1994; Seth et al., 1999), unless all populations are represented in research the knowledge base on which providers base treatment may not be complete.\n\nAs this framework indicates, there are a number of barriers to underserved populations receiving the care they require. Many individuals face barriers resulting from membership in more than one underserved population. Simply addressing the issue of poverty does not address all types of access barriers, namely geographic, linguistic, cultural, or barriers which result from prejudice or from discrimination against various groups, or their exclusion in the research and planning process.\n\nSection 3: Quantifying Populations and Needs\n\nResearch Related to Access of Underserved Populations\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn order to understand the significance of any problems in distribution of needed services and of access to them, it is necessary to be able to determine:\n\nthe size of the defined population at risk of impaired access;\n\nthe health status of the defined population;\n\nthe type and prevalence of difficulties in access experienced by this population.\n\nThe Metropolis Project (Health Canada, 1998), in the process of priorizing research domains related to health, identified a number of specific research issues related to the question of access. While this project focuses on immigrants and health, these research questions apply as well to other populations:\n\nwhether access to health services, of any kind, is less for immigrants (or underserved populations) than for native born (or the general population);\n\nif access is poorer, why this is so;\n\nwhat role racism or other forms of discrimination play;\n\nwhether culturally sensitive services are more effective in producing positive health outcomes; and\n\nwhat the rights of immigrants (underserved groups) to service should be.\n\nThe initial review of the literature undertaken for this paper identified little research undertaken in Canada on these questions of access, although significantly more is known about the health status of various populations. A review of the literature in the Atlantic region reached a similar conclusion (Sharif et al., 2000).\n\nA number of observations can be made from the initial review.\n\nThere is consensus from community level consultations and community-based surveys that many populations are less well served by the health system. This is attributed to \"language barriers\", \"cultural barriers\", lack of cultural sensitivity, or racism/ discrimination.\n\nLittle academic research has focused on issues of access, for any of the populations identified. The issue of access often emerges as a \"byproduct\" in the course of research on other topics (such as of health status) or is proposed as an explanation for various differences in utilization or health related behaviour.\n\nThe concept of \"access\" is poorly defined.\n\nAcademic research focusing on access often uses \"utilization\" as a measure of access. Limitations of this approach are discussed later in this section.\n\nThe concept of \"barriers\" remains conceptually imprecise, and is often discussed in general terms such as \"cultural barriers\".\n\n\"Membership\" in the underserved population to be studied is also poorly defined, which leads to difficulties in measuring populations.\n\nThere are few linkages made between access issues faced by various \"underserved populations\".\n\nThe absence of well defined terms and concepts, and current limitations in data collection significantly limit the usefulness of population health surveys or existing databases for studying issues of access.\n\nLack of conceptual clarity and a limited body of existing research means it is difficult to determine what types of access barriers are experienced by various populations, how prevalent they are, or what the impact of these barriers is on access to health services.\n\nApplicability of Research from Other Countries\n\nIn the absence of Canadian-based research, it is often useful to review research conducted in other countries. However, caution must be taken in generalizing this research to the Canadian context. For example, any research on access issues undertaken in countries without universal\n\nhealth insurance will be affected by the fact that many of the respondents face financial barriers to health care. Even though racial/ethnic/cultural differences are observed when factors such as insurance coverage are controlled for (Mayberry et al., 1999), caution is still required. This is because the \"social insurance\" form of Canadian universal health insurance operates from very different principles than that of private health insurance which is based on the principles of actuarial fairness (Stone, 1993). The cultural, historic and legislative context of service provision may also limit applicability of research. There may be important differences in population characteristics and rights of \"minority\" populations in other countries. For example, while Canada has a number of immigrants from Latin America, in many of the U.S. centres where research on \"Hispanic\" health needs takes place, Hispanics form a significant percentage of the population, and are gaining increased legal rights as well as service access. This situation is rarely experienced by minority groups in Canada.\n\nWhile it is not advised to apply evidence related to health inequities in the health system of one country to the system of another, the same limitation does not apply to examining findings on the effects of such inequities. For example, the effects of language barriers or low literacy on participation in preventive programs appear to be similar.\n\nMeasuring the Size of Underserved Populations\n\nFor all groups, difficulties were identified in determining the size of the populations. Difficulties in estimating the proportion of those with alternate sexual orientations are related to lack of research (particularly related to two-spirit, transgendered people, and gays and lesbians from Aboriginal and ethnic minority communities), lack of conceptual clarity, sampling limitations, \"invisibility\" of the population and reliance on self definition (Ryan et al., 2000).\n\nWhile there are clear definitions of Registered Indians, varying estimates of Aboriginal peoples are obtained depending on definitions used, and a recent change in census questions has resulted in increased numbers of those reporting Aboriginal heritage. These figures are also affected by an individual's willingness to be identified as Aboriginal.\n\nPopulation estimates of persons with disabilities are influenced by the definition of \"disability\" utilized.\n\nWhile precise figures of immigrants arriving in Canada are available by year, country of origin, a ge, gender and immigrant class, estimating populations of specific immigrant groups by province or city is not as straightforward, as total population may change due both to migration and to births/deaths within each group. In addition, available public access data (e.g. in the population health survey) often fails to differentiate between immigrants from various regions of the world in a meaningful way.\n\nMeasuring Access\n\nMuch published research that attempts to measure, rather than describe, access of underserved populations has used utilization as a measure of access. There are serious limitations in equating access with utilization as differences in utilization may or may not indicate problems with access. For example if a certain group (e.g. immigrants, or Aboriginal people) is found to have similar levels of utilization as the overall Canadian population, this could mean that the population:\n\nis of equivalent health status as the general population and uses health services similarly;\n\nis healthier than the general population but uses services more than are needed;\n\nis sicker than the population but due to access barriers uses services less ;\n\nhas different patterns of service utilization\n\n(e.g. uses fewer preventive, but more acute, services);\n\nis of lower health status than the general population but relies on resources outside of the health system\n\nDepending on the size and diversity of the population measured, reliance on measures of utilization also risk masking different patterns of use within the population. For example, some ethnic groups may utilize far more services, and some far fewer than the general population due to differences in access; with the result that the total \"immigrant\" or \"Aboriginal\" population has equivalent rates of utilization as the general population. Different types of access barriers may have differential effects on utilization.\n\nThere are a number of other limitations to using utilization data to measure access.\n\nOptimal utilization is unknown; we can only compare rates of utilization between groups.\n\nMuch utilization data is based on hospital activity; it does not give insight as to use of preventive and community-based services. This is of particular concern as the literature review indicates that the greatest barriers may be experienced in accessing preventive/health promotion programs.\n\nAccess to various services is achieved through different routes, indicating the effect of different factors. Although initial primary care contact is usually patient-initiated, much utilization is determined by physicians\n\n(e.g. return visits, prescriptions, specialist referral, hospital admission).\n\nUtilization is influenced by availability and accessibility of health care providers, which may differ between populations. Use of utilization data for planning purposes then risks perpetuating inequalities in existing allocation (Eyles and Birch, 1993), and may mask important problems in access.\n\nThere appear to be two reasons for the reliance on utilization data to estimate access. The Canadian literature on the utilization of health care across population groups in many ways reflects the philosophy and concerns of legislation underlying the medicare program; ensuring that Canadians of all income levels had equal access to (use of) care. The major focus of research has historically been on the relationship of income and health; access has been measured by examining the relationship between utilization and income. However, the use of utilization data to measure access can perhaps best be understood as \"measuring the information we have\". Until recently, little attention has been paid to the different types of information required for decision-making (Hutchinson and Abelson, 1996). Utilization data appears to be used because it is one of the few forms of data readily available, without careful consideration of what the data represents. So while members of underserved populations use the term \"access\" to describe availability, ease of contact, linguistic/cultural sensitivity, and satisfaction that equivalent quality care is received, many researchers define access simply as utilization.\n\nDefining Barriers\n\nIssues related both to health status and access to health services for members of underserved communities are complex and overlapping. Generally the literature does not clearly differentiate between a number of characteristics which have the potential to affect access to health services; instead, groups are compared based either on \"ethnicity\", or on Aboriginal or immigrant status.\n\nEthnicity\n\nThe concept of ethnicity to describe or explain barriers is problematic as the concept is rarely defined but is often based on the hypothesis that culturally based, traditional health beliefs act as a barrier to access and utilization of services. The focus on simply measuring differences between groups based on some measure of ethnicity, without adequately deconstructing the concept of ethnicity, poses a number of risks. A primary risk is the tendency to explain the \"access problem\" in terms of individual cultural incompetence, or even to blame minority communities for what is believed to be the impact of \"traditional beliefs\" or \"cultural\" behavioral patterns (Kaufert, 1990). As a result, researchers may conclude that minority patients are \"non-compliant\", mistrustful or fearful, (Orr et al., 1990) or \"reluctant\". Many stereotypes about ethnic differences fail to be confirmed by objective research.\n\nCultural Barriers\n\nThe concept of cultural barriers is linked to the concept of ethnicity. Discussion of access barriers experienced by or facing ethnic groups often fails to differentiate between:\n\ncultural beliefs which may result in different priorities, health practices, or confidence in prescribed treatment;\n\ninformation gaps as to what services are available, how they should be used, expectations of patients, or rationale for certain health practices and treatment options;\n\nlanguage / communication barriers ;\n\nracism or ethnocentrism within the health system and their effects on utilization patterns, treatment and outcomes;\n\ndifferences in need for, or effectiveness of, prescribed treatment due to differing risk for disease, prevalence of conditions, or metabolic differences within an ethnic group (Harrison, 1994; Seth et al., 1999).\n\nInterpretation of differences between groups may be ascribed to various \"causes\" depending on the definition of ethnicity, or \"barrier\" utilized. For example, those comparing different racial groups may ascribe differences to systemic racism; those who allocate subjects based on ethnic origin may focus on the likelihood that \"cultural beliefs\" may create barriers. When immigration status or time since arrival in the country is considered, the focus may be \"acculturation\" as a concept. Traditionally, language access as the focus of comparison has been ignored (Bowen and Kaufert, 2000).\n\nRecent research has begun to challenge the assumption that \"cultural beliefs\" or cultural differences are the cause of major barriers to access, pointing instead to communication barriers, systemic bias, and lack of flexibility in program delivery (Waldram, 1990; Jenkins et al., 1996; Naish et al., 1994; Perez-Stable et al.,\n\n1990). Because other populations such as gay, lesbian and bisexual people report similar difficulties in obtaining satisfactory care within the health care sys te m, we are alerted to the limitations of explanations of barriers framed in terms of \"ethnic\" or \"cultural\" differences.\n\nEthnic Identifiers\n\nIn Canada, little available data is linked to ethnic origin, and the topic remains controversial. The main argument against such linking is that \"ethnicity\" is not well defined, it does not take potentially confounding variables into account, and so may lead to incorrect conclusions. Differences attributed to \"ethnicity\" may be the result of income-related factors, or inability to communicate in an official language (Robinson, 1998; Bowen and Kaufert, 2000). If correlations are found they provide little insight into underlying causal mechanisms (O'Loughlin, 1999), and may contribute to a focus on \"cultural differences\" instead of systemic barriers. However, not including ethnic identifiers may limit the usefulness of routinely collected data to explore differences in access or disease prevalence, important aspects of research in a culturally diverse society. Linking could also allow monitoring of care to underserved groups, to determine whether there are differences in treatment based on ethnicity - a topic that appears not to have been researched in Canada. At present the potential risks of such linking appear to outweigh potential benefits, particularly given the lack of clear definitions. Caution must be taken in using identifiers.\n\nMeasuring Prevalence of Access Difficulties\n\nA review of published and unpublished Canadian literature found little research that attempted to measure the prevalence of difficulties with access experienced by a population. Although census and population health surveys do collect data on language and ethnicity, with the exception of measures of \"unmet need\", these data have not yet been used to develop preliminary estimates of the number of persons who face barriers to care, or what form these barriers may take.\n\nQuestions related to self-reported need for health care are often used in surveys. This method also brings a number of limitations. In addition to those inherent to the method (Eyles and Birch 1993), differences between cultural or ethnic groups in identifying and discussing health conditions; language difficulties, and distrust or fear of how results may be used, may affect the number of unmet needs identified (Anderson et al., 1993; Stevens, 1993a). Measuring differences in perceptions of unmet need relies on a shared conception of what a health need is, and expectations of what the health system should provide. It has been found that some immigrants from lower socio-economic levels learned in their country of origin to have low expectations of the health system; they were often unable to afford care, and were even subjected to abuse by the system (Bowen, 1999). These individuals are often found to be highly satisfied with Canadian services and report few unmet needs, even if faced by communication barriers, and lack of cultural competence of providers. This is the opposite pattern expected by researchers (Dunn and Dyck, 1998), in which people of lower income generally report a greater number of unmet needs.\n\nLimitations of Available Research\n\nCurrently much of the research related to needs, utilization and effects of interventions which is used for planning purposes relies on secondary analysis of large data sets collected for other purposes, such as claims data, or population health surveys. This approach is of limited usefulness at this time in assessing differences between underserved groups and the general population because the data necessary to undertake the analyses is not routinely collected.\n\nIn Canada, provincial claims systems record data on inpatient and outpatient service utilization patterns, diagnostic and service information, mortality and morbidity, codes and information on admission and discharge from health facilities. Some provincial health information systems record information on demographic characteristics of system users including age, gender and home address. However, (with the exception of codes that identify Aboriginal people with treaty status and designate Anglophone or Francophone patients) data on language use patterns, ethnic identity or community of origin are generally not available.\n\nPopulation health surveys also face a number of limitations in assessing health status and access for underserved populations. Most surveys exclude people who cannot communicate in English or French, a group at highest risk for access difficulties (Woloshin, 1997). First Nations communities are often undersampled or unsampled. In addition to these factors, smaller surveys may be of limited validity due to sample selection, and inability to control for other confounding variables. Communication barriers, variations in cultural views of health and illness, and concerns about the purpose of the survey and meaning of specific questions, frequently affect survey responses.\n\nCommunity needs assessments may provide more detailed information at a local level. Care is required in design in order to avoid the risk of undersampling due to language barriers, mobility, or small numbers of certain minority groups in some communities. Community consultations are a qualitative method often used to identify needs and perceptions of service. While useful to identify issues of concern and types of access difficulties experienced, the fact that selection of participants is often not random may preclude an estimate of the prevalence of concerns identified. However, the potential of qualitative, descriptive methods to assist in defining access, barriers, and developing strategies to measure them has not been adequately explored, and the results have not been effectively disseminated within the health system.\n\nSummary\n\nIn Canada, much of the research on access has focused on the variable of income. While there is general recognition that other factors such as \"language/cultural barriers\", \"lack of information\", or \"inappropriate services\" affect access, these concepts have not been critically examined in a comprehensive way.\n\nResearchers have identified that \"minorities\" have generally been excluded from general health research (Frayne et al., 1996; Cotton, 1990;). Kinnon, in a 1999 review of Canadian research on immigration and health, noted the lack of research related to health service provision for immigrants; most of the identified research focused on determinants of health. Ryan et al. (2000) highlighted the gaps in research, and the negative focus on much health research related to health and sexual orientation. A number of writers have noted the absence of research related to Aboriginal people, particularly living off reserve (Wigmore and McCue 1991; Shah and Farkas; 1985; Canadian Nurses Association, 1995), and related to persons with disabilities.\n\nEven when research is undertaken it may not focus on issues and approaches of importance to underserved communities themselves. Lack of representation of underserved communities among researchers and decision-makers appears to be contributing both to the paucity of research and the research focus itself. Clearly, more research is needed; however, research must utilize appropriate methodology. Greater attention needs to be given to clearly defining the populations and aspects of access to be measured, and to developing operational definitions and methods appropriate to the research questions and the characteristics of the communities studied. In addition, partnership with, and participation of, the populations affected are essential.\n\nSection 4: Underserved Populations In Canada\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs indicated in the Introduction, a number of diverse populations are identified as potentially underserved by the Canadian health system. These populations include Aboriginal people, official language minorities, those of alternative sexual orientations (gay, lesbian, bisexual, two-spirited, transgendered and transsexual) immigrants, refugees, ethnically and/or racially diverse populations, persons with disabilities, the homeless, sex trade workers, and low-income segments of the population. These categories of underservice are not exclusive. Individuals may belong to more than one underserved population and face additional access difficulties related to socio-economic status, gender, or residence in an underserved region.\n\nThis section provides an overview of the evidence for underservice for a number of these populations. This initial review focuses on \"separating out\" complex and often overlapping issues related to access, and identifying similarities and differences in the types of underservice experienced. Discussion of underservice will be described in the following categories.\n\nAboriginal peoples\n\nImmigrants and refugees\n\nVisible minorities\n\nLanguage minorities\n\nPersons of alternative sexual orientations\n\nPersons with disabilities\n\nMarginalized populations\n\nIn each section, key characteristics of each population, and what is known about the health status of each will be briefly summarized, utilizing previously compiled summary reports where available. Evidence for barriers to equitable care will be reviewed in the context of the framework proposed in Section Two. The focus of discussion will be the ways in which the organization and delivery of health services may contribute to inequity.\n\nAboriginal People\n\nDemographic background\n\nAccording to the 1996 census, approximately 3% (or 1.1 million) Canadians reported Aboriginal ancestry: two-thirds of these were North American Indian, a quarter Metis and about 5% Inuit. Over 600,000 of this number are Registered Indians (Indian and Northern Affairs, 1999). However, some provinces and territories have a higher percentage of Aboriginal people: in Manitoba and Saskatchewan they represent over 11% of the population; and approximately two-thirds of the population in the Northwest Territories, and over 20% of the population of the Yukon are Aboriginal (Statistics Canada, The Daily, January 13, 1998).\n\nThe Aboriginal population is diverse. There are 608 First Nations, comprising 52 Nations or cultural groups employing more than 50 languages. In terms of rights to services, Aboriginal peoples are categorized into four groups: Registered Indians, non-registered Indians, Inuit and Metis. Registered Indians also face differences in service access depending on whether they are living on or off reserve.\n\nMost Aboriginal people (70%) live outside reserves; however, less than half of the Registered Indian population live outside reserves (Indian and Northern Affairs, 1999). The Aboriginal population is highly mobile with frequent migration between urban areas and reserve communities. Three in 10 Aboriginal people live in census metropolitan areas and a quarter in other urban areas. From 1981 to 1991, the urban Aboriginal population grew by 62%, compared to 11% for other urban Canadians. Population growth in urban areas is due both to natural increases (birth rate) as well as net migration from rural areas.\n\nCanada's Aboriginal population is younger than the general population, with a median age of 25.5, compared to a median of 35.4 years for all Canadians. Thirty-five percent of the population is under the age of 15, and the number of Aboriginal youth (15-24) is expected to increase by 26% from 1996-2016. The 35-54 year group is expected to increase by 41% over the same time period (Statistics Canada, The Daily, January 13, 1998).\n\nHealth Status\n\nNumerous reports and statistics have consistently demonstrated a significant gap in health status between Aboriginal people and other Canadians. On almost every indicator, Aboriginal communities have lower health status (Health Canada, 1999; MacMillan et al, 1996). The Second Diagnostic on the Health of First Nations and Inuit People (Health Canada, 1999) summarizes the research in this area, recognizing that less research is available on off-reserve and non-registered Aboriginal people. A few of the issues highlighted in the report are:\n\nthe prevalence of self-reported, major chronic diseases such as diabetes is significantly higher in Aboriginal communities than in the general population;\n\nthere are higher levels of infectious disease;\n\ninjuries and poisonings are the leading cause of death in First Nations populations;\n\nalcohol and other substance abuse is considered to be a significant problem in Aboriginal communities;\n\nsuicide is two to seven times higher than in the general population;\n\ninfant mortality is 3.5 times higher for First Nations\n\nthe rate of pregnancy among young adolescent women (under age 15) are 18 times higher on reserves than for the general population;\n\nlife expectancy for registered Aboriginal people is seven years less than that for the overall Canadian population; and\n\nthree-quarters of Aboriginal women report experiencing family violence.\n\nMany Aboriginal people have been exposed to additional health risks. First Nations communities face higher risk of environmental contaminants due largely to a diet of fish and marine animals together with pollution of the environment in the North.\n\nAccess to Health Services\n\nA review of the literature indicates that Aboriginal peoples face significant difficulties in access in all four categories outlined in the conceptual framework. However, the actual issues faced vary significantly by both location of residence and by status.\n\nAvailability of Services\n\nMany First Nations people live in remote areas where there is limited access to health services funded by the province s. In these locations the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch of Health Canada is responsible for providing primary health services. Services provided may be through physicians (often provided on a visiting or rotating basis), nurses and Community Health Representatives. These services, which include prevention and health promotion, treatment, and emergency services are delivered out of health centres, or nursing or health stations, depending on the size of the community. Community Health Representatives are local Aboriginal workers, originally intended to provide translation and liaison functions. They now also function as educators, counselors and facilitators, although their role has not yet been fully developed (Allen, 1993; Lavallee et al., 1991). Special programs related to addictions, AIDS education and prevention, and environmental health, as well as some hospitals and residential treatment centres are also provided.\n\nDue to the isolation of many communities, provision of community health services may not be in the same form as those available to other citizens; some services may not be available at all. In some areas services delivered by the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch may be equivalent to, or better than services, in similarly remote non-Aboriginal communities. These services include emergency care/transportation, immunization programs, and prevention activities. Nevertheless, almost half of respondents in the First Nations and Inuit Regional Health Surveys believed that First Nations and Inuit people do not have the same level of services as the rest of Canada (Assembly of First Nations, 2000a).\n\nThe First Nations and Inuit Health Branch is not responsible for health care to \"non-registered Indians\", or for provision of services to Indians living off reserves. Aboriginal people living off reserve (including non-registered Aboriginal people and Metis), have the same availability of insured health services as other residents.\n\nFinancial barriers\n\nExperience with financial barriers to health services varies with status (registered or non-registered), and with third party payers for non-insured benefits, similar to other Canadians. Registered Indians and Inuit are eligible for Non-insured Health Benefits (NIHB), a program of the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch that provides supplementary benefits to eligible First Nations and Inuit to meet medical or dental needs not covered by provincial/territorial or third party health insurance plans. These benefits include dental, vision, and pharmacy, medical supplies, equipment and transportation, crisis intervention, mental health services and health premiums in Alberta and British Columbia. In some regions they may also cover traditional healing. The provision of supplementary benefits through NIHB means that Registered Indians (whether or not they live on reserve) and Inuit have greater access to many services than non-registered Aboriginal and Metis people (or other Canadians who lack third party insurance).\n\nCosts of NIHB have escalated over past years with the result that there is tension between the federal government and First Nations communities related to the drive to cap funds to this program. The Assembly of First Nations has claimed that per capita government spending on Aboriginals is lower than that spent on other Canadians, in spite of lower health status and higher health needs.\n\nAnother area of cost is related to lack of local services. Many Aboriginal people needing treatment may be required to travel hundreds, or even thousands, of kilometers for care. They may be required to spend weeks or months separated from their family and community, even for non-critical life events such as childbirth.\n\nNon-financial barriers to presentation of need\n\nAboriginal peoples may face significant barriers in this category, although experience varies by location of residence. First Nations people on reserve may experience fewer barriers to presentation of need due to availability of community-based services, and fewer language/cultural barriers to delivery of preventive/promotion services. Understanding how the system works and how and where to access services is an important problem for Aboriginal people who migrate to urban centres. Some are monolingual and face language barriers to initial access. Inuit peoples may face an even greater challenge as many speak neither English or French, and there are fewer urban Inuit organizations to assist in providing access services. To get some health services patients must show proof of registered status; Inuit families do not always know how to get this information or identification number (Canadian Nurses Association, 1995).\n\nJurisdictional confusion over responsibility for health service coverage presents difficulty for many Aboriginal people. A critical factor in initial access is the distrust and discomfort with health and social service systems experienced by many Aboriginal people, based on personal and historical experience. Lack of confidence in equitable treatment, intimidation and fear of discrimination may result in avoidance of certain types of services (Aboriginal Health and Wellness Centre of Winnipeg, 1997; Canadian Nurses Association, 1995).\n\nAboriginal populations have been found to have lower participation in preventive programs such as cervical screening and mammogram (Roos,1999; Calam et al., 1992; Hislop et al., 1996, Grunfeld, 1997; Deschamps et al., 1992; Clarke et al., 1998). Low literacy and socio-economic status, as well as limited availability of linguistically and culturally appropriate health promotion and disease prevention information, likely contribute to these lower rates.\n\nEquitable quality of care\n\nAboriginal peoples in Canada face significant barriers to appropriate and equitable treatment: in referring to the framework developed in Section Two, we find that difficulties are reported in all categories.\n\nCommunication with health providers remains an important barrier. With the exception of some hospitals in major centres, translation services for Aboriginal languages generally aren't available, and patients must depend on informal translation (Kaufert and O'Neil, 1998). A vast body of literature has highlighted the risks related to impaired communication. (Please see Section 4C, Language Minorities.)\n\nLack of respectful or compassionate treatment, as well as experience of overt racism and discrimination is commonly reported by Aboriginal people (Aboriginal Health and Wellness Centre of Winnipeg, 1997; Canadian Nurses Association, 1995). The assertion that many providers do not understand or appreciate Aboriginal culture, traditions or experience is supported by recent Canadian studies which found that many health professionals in training received limited exposure to cultural issues (Flores et al., 2000; Redwood-Campbell et al., 1999).\n\nMany (though not all) Aboriginal people have a different concept of health and healing than other Canadians. The use of a \"medical\" model and its emphasis on curative services and physical health does not reflect the First Nation understanding of health as balance between mind, body, spirit and emotion, and harmony between people and the environment (Favel-King, 1993). A number of Aboriginal people base health beliefs on a traditional holistic model, and may wish to incorporate traditional healing such as the Medicine Wheel, smudging or sweat lodges into treatment. However, there is a lack of awareness and availability of traditional healing and there may be specific regulations which forbid certain practices (such as smudging ceremonies in hospital). There is a need for the option of services based on traditional practices, and for Aboriginal peoples to be in control of design and administration of health services for their communities.\n\nHowever, the focus on \"cultural differences\" as a barrier to health access should be responded to with caution. There is clear ly a great deal of concern expressed by community members about how they are treated by the health care system., but it is less clear that \"cultural beliefs\" are truly the key source of access barriers. A focus on \"cultural differences\" risks attributing difficulties to the community rather than to how health services are delivered and the biases of providers. Characteristics that result from poverty or other factors may also be attributed to \"culture\".\n\nBarriers experienced in this category vary based on location of residence, and whether and at what stage health transfer is occurring in specific First Nations communities. Some preliminary evidence suggests that communities that have transferred, or are transferring, may be more satisfied with services (Assembly of First Nations, 2000a; Shibogoma Evaluation Committee, 1999). Certainly the intent of transfer is to make health services more appropriate and accountable to the community. However, Gregory et al. (1992) in their evaluation of one First Nations Community concluded that the policy does little to address underlying socio-economic conditions. Little information relating to evaluation of the transfer process is currently in the public domain. In addition, most health services to Aboriginal people are not provided on reserve. Many registered Aboriginal people migrate to off-reserve rural or urban areas, or are forced to travel to larger centres for treatment. Many Aboriginal people are not \"registered\" and less is known about the health status and needs of this group (Wigmore and McCue, 1991) due in part to the inability of current data collection systems to identify groups other than \"registered Indians\".\n\nImmigrants and Refugees/Visible Minorities/Language Minorities\n\nA number of issues related to \"ethnicity\" were summarized in previous sections. Many studies on immigrant health fail to differentiate between a number of characteristics that may contribute to access difficulties. Immigrants, for example, may or may not: bring health beliefs which differ from that of general Canadian population; be fluent in English or French; be a member of a visible minority group; or, belong to a population with increased risk for certain diseases. Often immigrant and visible minority health issues are combined, although there may be very different factors affecting access. This section discusses issues related to immigrant status, visible minority status, and official language fluency separately, in an attempt to help clarify the range of factors that may have a differential impact on various immigrant and non-immigrant ethnocultural groups.\n\n1. Immigrants and Refugees\n\nBackground\n\nIn 1996, 17% (approximately 5 million) of the Canadian population were born outside of Canada. However this figure masks a diversity which has significant implications for health needs and services. It includes all residents who are not Canadian born; newly arrived and those who have lived in Canada for decades, various classes of immigrants, (including refugees), fluent English/French speakers and those who speak neither official language, professionals and those with little formal education and from impoverished backgrounds. Immigrants come from all regions of the world and from many different ethnic or cultural groups.\n\nIn 1997, approximately 190,000 immigrants arrived in Canada. In the five year period, 1995-1999, the total was over one million (Citizenship and Immigration Canada, 2000). The majority settle in large urban centres, particularly Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, but there are many smaller newcomer populations is most cities and larger towns in Canada.\n\nThe shift in source countries of immigration is a factor in equitable delivery of health services. The majority of immigrants used to come from Europe, the British Commonwealth, and the USA; more recently, newcomers are from Asia, Africa and Latin America. Immigrants from these areas are far more likely to face both language barriers to care and cultural differences. Immigrants today are also more likely to be visible minorities and so may face a different reception upon arrival than European immigrants.\n\nHealth Status\n\nImmigrants recently arrived in Canada tend to be in better health than Canadian-born residents. Immigrants, particularly those from non-European countries, appear to have a longer life expectancy and more disability free years. This is attributed to the \"healthy immigrant effect\" (people who immigrate tend to be in better health), and to Canada's medical screening program (Chen, Ng, and Wilkins, 1996). However, the longer they live in Canada, the closer their health status resembles that of other Canadians.\n\nRecent immigrants are younger than the general population, better educated and less likely to suffer from chronic diseases or disabilities (Chen, Ng, and Wilkins, 1996). Many groups show lower rates of negative personal health practices such as smoking or alcohol use. However, some groups may have greater risk of infectious diseases such as hepatitis or tuberculosis due to exposure in country of origin. The average family income is higher among all immigrants than the Canadian born; however, recent immigrants are much more likely to be unemployed or have lower incomes, particularly if they are from visible minority populations. There is great diversity between immigrant groups and refugees tend to have higher health care needs than other immigrants.\n\nAccess to Health Services\n\nAvailability of services\n\nNewcomers to Canada generally do not face barriers related to availability of"
