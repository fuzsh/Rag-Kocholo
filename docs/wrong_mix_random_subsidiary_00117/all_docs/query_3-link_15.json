This time, I was joined by our Corporate Medical Director (CMD) team, which is part of our Advisory Services group. We all piled in a van for an unforgettable 5-hour road trip. This experience allowed me to reflect on what a great team we have and how lucky I am to be working with people who are making such a major impact on organizations across Canada. Part of the reward for me as a person and as a professional is to be able to work with a global organization of 73,000 caregivers. Having access to incredibly intelligent people and sharing ideas with fellow caregivers all over the world (in this case Cleveland) is one of the elements that sets our CMD team apart. They are agile, innovative and a true team of teams. Our CMDs are working with companies across 15 different sectors as a partner to corporate Canada, assisting leaders, protecting enterprise health, and enhancing population-based employee care. It’s this collaboration that makes our CMD team truly world class. This team has a bright future and I’m thrilled to see it continue to grow."
