The champion of the 1980 Olympic Games and the long-time captain of the USSR national team has died at the age of 70.\n\n​His son, Italian Men's National Team member and professional volleyball player at Lube, Ivan Zaytsev, announced his dad's passing on Instagram on June 12, 2023 saying - “Goodbye, dad ...have a good trip, rest now if you can.\"\n\nThe elder Zaytsev (a 2013 IVHF Inductee) paired with teammate Aleksandr Savin, a 2010 Volleyball Hall of Fame inductee, to form one of the most dominating setter-hitter pairs to ever play the game. Zaytsev was adept at delivering quick sets to his favorite hitter leading to dominating victories and international titles along the way. Zaytsev was also well-known as among the best blocking setters in the game.\n\n\"It is with profound sadness, the volleyball world bids farewell to a true legend and a cherished member of our Hall of Fame family,\" said George Mulry, IVHF Executive Director. \"Vyacheslav Zaytsev's exceptional talents and contributions to the sport of volleyball have left an indelible mark on the fabric of history. His enduring legacy will forever be enshrined within these hallowed walls, reminding us of the profound impact he had.\"\n\nMaking his debut in 1969 with Russian club Avtomobilist as a 17 year old schoolboy, Zaytsev quickly established himself as a leader and force on the court. In 1971 he won his first European Championship and by 1977 he had become captain of the national team for USSR.\n\nZaytsev was a key player for Avtomobilist and the Soviet National team throughout most of the 1970s and 1980s- 20 year span of international competition that includes two gold medals and two silver medals at the FIVB World Championship, two gold medal and a silver at the FIVB World Cup, and seven gold medals at the European Championships among many other accomplishments.\n\nZaytsev was considered one of the best setters in the world, being named the most valuable player of the 1981 FIVB World Cup, best defensive player of the 1977 FIVB World Cup and included in the list of annual 24 best players of the USSR 17 times.\n\nPerhaps Zaytsev’s biggest accomplishments, however, came at the Olympic Games. Representing the USSR in three Olympic Games, Zaytsev netted the gold medal at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow and led his team to the silver medal at the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games and again at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games.\n\nHe was one of the first Russian players to play professional club volleyball abroad and spent five seasons competing in Italy from 1987 to 1992. He played for Olio Venturi Spoleto the first two seasons with the team moving into the top Serie A1 division the second season. Zaytsev played in Serie A2 the next two seasons with Sanyo Agrigento and G.S. Citta di Casello before his final season with Citta di Castello returning to the top division. At the age of 40, Zaytsev played his last International match while playing for the Swiss club “Lugano” and quickly focused full-time on coaching.\n\nAs a coach, he adapted many of the volleyball techniques introducred by other coaches to retain the Russian pre-eminence in men’s volleyball competition. He coached the Russian Men’s National Team from 1996-1997 and led them to the bronze medal at the 1997 FIVB World League. He coached the Belogorie club to the silver medal in the Russian Championship five times and in 2007, he helped the Dynamo women’s club win the Russian Championship.\n\nZaytsev will be forever remembered for his long career, remarkable success, impeccable setting skills on the court and his inspirational leadership.\n\nCLICK THE VIDEO ABOVE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE CLASS OF 2023\n\n​HOLYOKE, Mass., May 22, 2023 - The International Volleyball Hall of Fame (IVHF) is proud to present its induction class of 2023, to be honored on October 21 in Holyoke.

A fully realized brand strategy will cast the Hall further forward, aligned with the surge in popularity of volleyball around the globe.\n\nAs the hall of fame for volleyball around the world, the organization will now officially be known as both the International Volleyball Hall of Fame and the IVHF. Utilizing the acronym of IVHF builds upon the prestige and equity of the existing brand, while leveling up the organization to meet other similar volleyball institutions, whose names have evolved in similar ways, bringing meaning and value to the unique but accessible name.\n\n​\n\nSteve Bishop, IVHF Board President commented: “As volleyball continues to grow domestically and internationally, it is important that the brand of the International Volleyball Hall of Fame clearly positions the organization for recognition in every continent and every discipline of the sport worldwide. This rebrand process allowed the IVHF to reflect on the history and mission of the organization while also looking forward to where we want to be strategically in the global volleyball family. This was an important project that will help to highlight the IVHF and honor this great sport well into the future.”\n\nThe Hall is on the cusp of major change highlighted by the creation of its International Media Advisory Group comprising media representatives, blog owners, and social media influencers from around the globe that will help create and share stories of volleyball history online and in the physical museum. With change and expansion, branded materials often need to be produced, making this an ideal time for this endeavor.\n\n“The IVHF is poised for expanded recognition nationally and globally due to the excellent leadership and contributions of its board of directors, advisors, and supporters,” said IVHF Executive Director George Mulry. “It is important we create the foundation for a strong brand that accurately represents our purpose, goals, and vision for the future. We’ve experienced incredible growth over the last decade and our brand new identity and logo will honor our roots while representing who we are today and where we are going tomorrow.\"\n\nThe tools and resources of the rebrand, including a corporate strategic review, were part of an in-kind donation from is+at, a prestigious strategic brand house out of New York City led by Heather Furman and Matthew Thornton that are both big supporters of international volleyball and the IVHF. The timing and offering of this donation was utilized by a special work group, the IVHF Marketing Committee, and the IVHF Board of Directors to create the final brand concepts and marks.\n\nThe new brand mark will be rolled out throughout the remainder of 2023 including transitioning the website to www.IVHF.org and will include new branding for the Induction Ceremony, to be held October 21, 2023 in Holyoke, Massachusetts.\n\nTickets are on sale for the 2023 Induction with the Class of 2023 to be announced on May 22.
