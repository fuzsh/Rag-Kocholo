UNITED STATES MILITARY ACADEMIES OVERVIEW WITNESSES LIEUTENANT GENERAL DARRYL A. WILLIAMS, SUPERINTENDENT, UNITED STATES MILITARY ACADEMY VICE ADMIRAL WALTER E. ``TED'' CARTER JR., SUPERINTENDENT, UNITED STATES NAVAL ACADEMY LIEUTENANT GENERAL JAY B. SILVERIA, SUPERINTENDENT, UNITED STATES AIR FORCE ACADEMY Opening Statement of Chairman Visclosky Mr. Visclosky. The Subcommittee on Defense will come to order. This morning the subcommittee will receive testimony and an update on the military service academies. We welcome our three witnesses; Lieutenant General Darryl Williams, Superintendent of West Point; Vice Admiral Ted Carter, Superintendent of the Naval Academy; and Lieutenant General Jay Silveria, Superintendent of the Air Force Academy. Gentlemen, thank you very much for appearing today. We appreciate you being able to share the current state of the military academies. Additionally, on behalf of all the members I want to thank you for changing the date of your testimony given the cancellation of votes yesterday. We do appreciate very much you staying over. Some of the topics for today's hearing that I hope we can hear more about include the mission structure and academics at each of the service academies and how our academies are reflecting the national defense strategy. A discussion of maintenance and restoration efforts of buildings and facilities at each location, West Point and the Naval Academy that have buildings over 100 years old and the Air Force Academy whose buildings are all roughly the same age as the institution. And some of the social issues each academy is dealing with, notably sexual assault and harassment and what way is forward. We also look forward to hearing what more we as members of Congress can do to help the service academies in the nomination process. With that, again, I thank you again for appearing before the committee today to discuss these issues, and now I would like to recognize my friend and distinguished ranking member, Mr. Calvert, for any comments he has. Opening Remarks of Mr. Calvert Mr. Calvert. Thank you, Chairman Visclosky, and welcome to our witnesses. I look forward to hearing from each of you. As you know, every Member of Congress has the ability to nominate promising young men and women to each of your academies. It is an honor to be accepted to your institutions. Each has a long and honorable history of graduates who go on to serve our country with distinction. I take my responsibility in the nominating process very seriously and convene a committee of retired service members to interview candidates and assist me in the selection process. One of my West Point appointees was First Lieutenant Todd Bryant. Todd was from Riverside, California, and was 23 when he was killed in action in the Iraq war. He had been there for about 2 months. Todd was married shortly before he shipped out and also interned in my office. He joked he would run for my seat one day. The loss of Todd is a reminder of the solemn duty we have in nominating young people to the academies and providing for them after they graduate and begin service in their respective branch. The young men and women who attend your institutions are by and large our future leaders. I look forward to hearing about the condition of your facilities, your curriculum to ensure we are training the next generation of officers to meet the national security challenges we face. I also understand we are going to hear from you about the recent report on sexual assaults. The young men and women at your academies are held to high standards, as they should be. I look forward to hearing from you about how you plan to address those concerns. Again, I appreciate your years of dedicated public service to our Nation, and I look forward to your testimony. I yield back. Mr. Visclosky. Thank you very much. Gentlemen, your full written testimonies will be placed in the record, and members have copies at their seats. My intention is to allow members multiple rounds for possible questions, and therefore, in the interest of time, I would strongly encourage each of you to keep your summarized statements to about 5 minutes. I would also strongly encourage you to be complete in your answers but very concise so members can have multiple questions per round. With that, we will begin with General Williams and move from left to right from your shoulders. Summary Statement of General Williams General Williams. Chairman Visclosky, Ranking Member Calvert, and distinguished members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the state of the United States Military Academy, and on behalf of the entire West Point team, thank you for your support to the academy and our programs. West Point continues to develop smart and thoughtful leaders of character who will fight and win in the crucible of ground combat, and we are prepared to lead in this complex age of persistent conflict. We expect our graduates to live honorably, lead honorably, and demonstrate excellence. To move the academy forward in concert with the Army's priorities, we have developed five priorities that focus our efforts and enable us to achieve our mission. Developing leaders of character, strengthening the culture of character, building our team of cadets, staff, faculty, and coaches, modernizing, securing, and reforming West Point, and strengthening our partnerships with the Army, Department of Defense, allies and partners, the civilian sector, academia, and of course, the American people. These efforts posture the academy to best support Army readiness and modernization and enable the long-term development of leaders with the high standards our Nation deserves from the profession of arms. While the vast majority of our cadets and graduates exemplify true leaders of character, recent survey results on sexual assault and sexual harassment remind us that our work will never truly be completed. I can assure you that we are determined, vigilant, and committed to addressing this problem and to meeting the American public's expectations for honorable service. We must eradicate sexual assault and sexual harassment at West Point. Critical to our success in achieving these efforts are the academy's three greatest strengths: The outstanding young men and women who comprise the corps of cadets, the dedicated and talented military and civilian professionals who make up our team of staff, faculty, and coaches, and most importantly, our Army values and the West Point ideals of duty, honor, and country. We are confident that we are on the right path to best support the Army and the national defense strategies by graduating the leaders of character who are comfortable with complexity and who are ready to deploy, fight, and win when and where required. Of course, we continue to measure our success in the thousands of West Point graduates who serve and lead with distinction in the Army, industry, and government throughout the Nation. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. I invite you to visit West Point to see firsthand our amazing cadets, staff, faculty, and coaches. I look forward to your questions. [The written statement of Lieutenant General Williams follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Visclosky. Thank you very much. Summary Statement of Admiral Carter Admiral Carter. Chairman Visclosky, Ranking Member Calvert, and distinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today on behalf of the United States Naval Academy. Our mission is to develop midshipmen morally, mentally, and physically and to imbue them with the highest ideals of duty, honor, and loyalty. I am pleased to report to you that the Naval Academy is succeeding in its mission and in no small part due to the support of Congress. This past summer, we graduated over 1,000 members of the class of 2018. Seventy-five percent were commissioned into the United States Navy as Ensigns where the vast majority will serve as surface warfare officers, submariners, aviators, Navy SEALs, and explosive ordnance disposal officers. Twenty-five percent were commissioned as Second Lieutenants in the Marine Corps. Feedback from the fleet as in past years is that the Naval Academy is producing junior officers with the skills necessary to successfully lead Sailors and Marines. Thanks to the dedicated admissions outreach efforts and your support, the Brigade consists of midshipmen from every state and every district in our union, increasingly representing the nation it has sworn to protect and defend. Moreover, the Brigade of Midshipmen is comprised of 28 percent female and 36 percent minority midshipmen. The Brigade is the most diverse it has been in the Naval Academy's 173-year history, and they are excelling with a record high 90 percent of the original class of 2019 on track to graduate this May. The Naval Academy's rigorous academic program ranks as one of the best undergraduate programs in the country due largely to an incredible faculty that continues to innovate their curricula to better prepare our future war fighters. This past summer, our two most recently added majors, nuclear engineering and cyber operations, were fully accredited, with cyber as one of only four accredited programs in the entire Nation. While I am proud of the accomplishments of our faculty, staff, coaches, and most importantly, the Brigade of Midshipmen, I do have concerns. Despite dedicated efforts by Naval Academy leadership and the Brigade, we continue to experience incidents of unwanted sexual contact within our ranks. I and the rest of my leadership team have actively sought out professional advice from the experts on the best strategies to reduce this scourge within our student body, and we have implemented initiatives to drive improvements. We must do better. I am also troubled with the current state of the Naval Academy's infrastructure. Stemming from highly pressurized budgets as a result of the 2013 sequestration, the Department of the Navy has taken risks by underfunding capital investments in installation operations in order to fund other critical war fighting readiness and modernization requirements. Fortunately, the Naval Academy has recently experienced increased levels of funding for infrastructure sustainment and modernization which are providing welcome relief. While I am concerned with the ability to maintain this national historic landmark, I am committed to ensuring that the safety, security, and quality of the working, learning, and living environment is sustained well into the future. Thank you for your time today. I am prepared to address your questions. [The written statement of Vice Admiral Carter follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Visclosky. Thank you very much. General Silveria, please. Summary Statement of General Silveria General Silveria. Chairman Visclosky, Ranking Member Calvert, and other distinguished members of the committee, thank you for this opportunity to provide updates on the current events, successes, and challenges at the United States Air Force Academy. I appreciate your interest in the military service academies, institutions I am confident all three superintendents here would agree play a vital role in reinforcing the strength and effectiveness of our services and in shaping the future of our military and the modern profession of arms. As superintendent of the Air Force Academy, I am here on behalf of our 4,281 cadets and 203 preparatory school cadet candidates as well as the faculty and staff that are developing them into the future leaders of our Air Force. I tell our cadets that they will soon graduate and stand beside me in uniform, and before long, they will replace me. It will be their responsibility to guide our Air Force and make it their own. We need our cadets to be more creative, innovative, and inquisitive than ever before. We need them to look at the application of air power differently and to broaden that consideration of capability with their rapidly advancing knowledge in space, cyber remotely piloted aircraft, and beyond. Through that lens, our service academies are an incredibly important investment in the future of our national security. In the more than 33 years I have had the privilege to wear this uniform since my graduation, our academy and our military have changed quite a bit, but our mission has not, and neither has our enduring dedication to our core values. My priority as superintendent, reinforce the dedication as we prepare agile leaders for a rapidly changing future. To that end, our priority must be to develop leaders of airmen who are innovative, who are rooted in a warrior ethos, and possess impeccable character. A culture of dignity and respect is foundational to the priorities I have just mentioned and everything we do at our academy. In this hearing, we will discuss areas of misconduct that demonstrate a severe lack of dignity and respect and have no place at our academies and in our military; sexual harassment and sexual assault. We are committed to addressing these issues head on to be an example for our Air Force, Department of Defense, and society. In short, we must do more. Our society is changing swiftly, and we must lead these developments. Our newest class at the academy included our highest percentage of women applicants, and we expect the class of 2023 to be even higher. This year we accepted the highest number of minorities into the class of 2022 in our history. We are not done on this front, and we will continually strive to improve these numbers so that our academy more closely reflects the society it serves and possesses the greatest strengths of the diversity of that society. In nearly every interaction I have with our cadets, I am struck by their ambition, their intellect, their drive to become outstanding leaders. They are participating in a program built on four pillars of academics, military training, athletics, and character development. This year we have two Rhodes Scholars. Our research programs continue to be among the top in the country. Our cadets fly airplanes, operate remotely piloted aircraft, they operate satellites, and they operate in cyberspace. Our military training program is a rigorous 47-month experience that prepares cadets to be leaders of airmen. Every one of our cadets is an athlete. One quarter compete against the best in the country in Division I athletics. Through character development, they are building a foundation of moral excellence that will guide them throughout their careers. I can tell you from my personal experience that modern combat is rapidly changing and will continue to be more complex. But one of the privileges of this role is that I get to see the future of our Air Force in our cadets. I encourage each of you to visit our academy, and I am confident that you will agree that these cadets are nothing short of incredible. They are up to this task, and it is our responsibility as leaders to ensure they are prepared to actively shape that future. The national security of our next generation depends on the investment we are making in these promising young leaders now. Thank you for the opportunity to speak today, and I look forward to your questions. [The written statement of Lieutenant General Silveria follows:] [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Visclosky. General, thank you very much. I want to thank each of your testimony and also for setting a wonderful precedent for all our future witnesses for the next 2 years. Before I turn to Mr. Calvert for any questions he may have, I will thank Mr. Womack because we are a collegial body, and it was Mr. Womack's suggestion that we hold this hearing today, and I thank him for that very good idea. With that, I will turn to Mr. Calvert. NATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGY Mr. Calvert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for giving me the opportunity to make a statement and ask a question. I would like to say a quick note on the issue of sexual harassment, sexual assault at the academies. I know several of my colleagues will be covering this topic in their questions, and I want to give them the opportunity to do that. I would just like to say that we hold our public institutions, especially the military, to higher standards. All cadets, especially female cadets, must be made to feel safe and free from any kind of harassment or assault. And I certainly appreciate all of you sharing your thoughts and action plans with both myself and Chairman Visclosky prior to these hearings. For the well being of our young people at the academies, we will hold you to your word, to continue to account for the problem and find solutions. However, the question I would like you to address is how the national defense strategy which calls for a shift away from counterinsurgency to focus more on China and Russia has impacted your training and education curriculum. As our adversaries become more adept at operating in the gray zone, cyber attacks, proxy wars, information warfare, how are we preparing our future leaders to fight and win in this new type of conflict? General Williams. Ranking Member, thank you very much for your question. The defense strategy, and the Secretary of Defense asked us to have a more lethal force, and my Army leadership has asked me to focus on readiness. So readiness is the number one priority of the United States Military Academy, and we do that through our leadership development strategy. We get at that through living honorably, leading honorably, and demonstrate excellence. So the cadets--my friends talked about the different pillars. Those same pillars exist at West Point. We have an academic pillar, a military pillar, a physical pillar, but the most importantly piece as was mentioned earlier was character, and so all four of those pillars work together. Our cadets in their curriculum are allowed to travel and see the environments they are potentially going to be in. We have an academic enrichment program where cadets can travel abroad and understand future environments, understand future allies that we are going to partner with. We also have a variety of languages that we speak, that we teach at West Point, whether that be from Portuguese to Russian where cadets are exposed firsthand to the environment they are going to be in. I would also say that cyber is a very important future aspect of this new environment, this multi domain operation battlefield that we are going to fight in, so we have a real strong effort in cyber operations. We have 25 cadets who will branch this year, both male and female cadets, into cyber operations. Admiral Carter. Sir I will echo some of the comments from my colleague from West Point in that we have international programs, and we are creating leaders of character that will make a difference for our Navy and Marine Corps. A couple of additional points. The academic curricula that we have at the Naval Academy is developed based on the needs of the fleet. Now, when we graduate our young men and women that go into the Navy at 75 percent, 25 percent in the Marine Corps, as you heard me say in my opening statement, they go into war- fighting roles. Roughly 95 percent of our graduates are in those war fighter roles. However, in this developing need, especially in the cyber sphere and intelligence, our number of commissioned officers have grown in that community. This year we will commission 49 Ensigns into the information warfare community, 24 of whom will be cryptologic warfare or cyber warriors. This is a shift based on the needs of the Navy, and it is also reflective of the curricula that we have at the Naval Academy. I mentioned the development of a cyber operations major, the development of a nuclear engineering major, operations research, an economics major that had been part of our liberal arts portion of our academy, now it is a STEM-based major. So with 25 different academic majors to offer, 20 of them are in the STEM field, and we feel that is the type of technological background and engineering background that our young men and women will need to lead, fight, and win in the future. General Silveria. Sir, thank you for the question and the opportunity. I will add that the Air Force Academy, similar to the other two academies, very robust in our international programs. We think that that cultural awareness as in the national defense strategy, the importance of partnerships and alliances, is crucial. And so we all have very robust international programs that can develop on that cultural awareness and the language awareness. I think for us in the area of technology advancement, we are consistently among the top research institutions in the country, and when you consider that we are an undergrad only institution, we recently had six cadets that were awarded patents for their work and one recently in the area of cyber. We focused a lot of our cadet for seniors in their curriculum in the area of research, so they have an experiential program. I point that out because that is where we get the innovative critical thinking skills to take on the national defense strategy and take on future conflicts that we are going to need. In the area of cyber and artificial intelligence, our cadets continue to do research and continue to stretch those technologies, but just as my colleagues have mentioned, we also this year have the highest number of cadets that are graduating into our space field, into our cyber field, and into our remotely piloted aircraft field than we have ever had in the past. That really shows the leading edge of technology and what we will need in modern combat. PATENTS Mr. Calvert. Thank you. Just a real quick follow up because you brought that up. When a student files a patent, does that accrue to the benefit of the student, or does that accrue to the benefit of the institution? General Silveria. Sir, the ones we have now are intellectual property that the cadets have earned. We had a cadet just earn one in the area of cyber, but it is his intellectual property. Mr. Visclosky. Ms. McCollum. SEXUAL ASSAULT Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to touch on-- because I think we are going to have another round of questions on the sexual assault. The report that just came out, and I looked at it again last night, and I have it in front of me, the Department of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, indicated nearly a 50 percent increase in unwanted sexual contact across the academies since 2016. So I am going to ask you a couple of questions, but I want to take a couple of words right out of the report. One thing that--and these are not your words, gentlemen. These are from-- I am trying to read and talk at the same time. This is from the executive summary of the report. It is from page 5. And the second to the last paragraph disturbs me with the choosing of the words of the Pentagon in this report. Fewer cadets and midshipmen chose, chose, to make sexual harassment complaints this year than last. Chose. That means they decided to do or not to do. This shouldn't be a choice. This should be something that is reported when it happens because when I read the word choose, that means someone still might be out there worried about a black mark, a stain on their record, not being taken seriously and that, but these were not your words, gentlemen. These were the words of the Pentagon. So I am going to follow up with why they chose that word because I find that very interesting, and words are very powerful. And when people write executive summaries, to drill down on this word again, they choose their words very carefully. The other thing that is in the report, and we talked about it a little bit, and sir, I am sorry I didn't get to hear directly from the Air Force. It was no one's fault. It was weather. But in our conversations, you touched on alcohol, and one of the things in the report says U.S. Military Academy. Alcohol is estimated to be involved in over half of the unwanted sexual contact events specifically. 52 percent events described by female cadets, 59 by male cadets. The Naval Academy. Alcohol is estimated to be involved in over half of the unwanted sexual contacts, specifically 72 percent of the described by female shipmen, 49 by male shipmen. The Air Force Academy. The same number, same thing again on alcohol, 65 percent described by female cadets. I think that is supposed to say doolies, or is that just first term. General Silveria. That is just the first term. Ms. McCollum. That is just the first term cadets and 62 percent by male cadets. So we did talk a little bit about cultural, character, and alcohol, and some of the training that is been going on. Seeing the alcohol numbers, especially the number for the Navy, I have to say is fairly alarming. And we discussed it briefly. So I am going to ask you to kind of tell us what tools that you need to put in your toolbox or what kind of things that you expect will be happening to address these alarming trends and reports that continue to have numbers that are fairly active, and you know, what are you going to do to address some of the root causes? We are seeing alcohol is definitely one of them for sexual contact and harassment in the academies. You know, I know that these are young adults. I know that this happens on our college campuses, but we all talked about the character and the future leaders that these people are going to be or have expressed an interest in become. Could you maybe just give us some thoughts on that? Thank you. Admiral Carter. Ma'am, I am the longest serving superintendent here on this panel, so I will go first. I would like to just briefly mention this key word that you hit on which is chose in the reporting part. For us at the Naval Academy, if we were to look at these surveys that have been going on for well over a decade. From 2005 to--excuse me, 2007 to 2015, our reporting had shown a steady increase which is something that we saw as a positive, that we would see more of our survivors coming forward. We cannot force them to report. It is a voluntary thing that they will report. Our job is to set the culture and the conditions so they feel very comfortable and safe in reporting without any retaliation or any other pressures. We have done a significant amount of work to try to ease that burden. We have moved the response coordinators and the victim counselors away from the dorm rooms or Bancroft Hall where all the midshipmen live so they can feel the sense that they can go somewhere to have that talk. They also know of other resources on the Naval Academy to help advise and assist them from our chaplains to a place that is called the Midshipmen Development Center for Mental Health. And this is really about getting people to make that report. As you know, there are two types of report, a restricted report where somebody files that report to get that type of service available to them where there is no names involved and then an unrestricted report. So these are the DOD rules that we operate within, and this is part of the challenge of holding people accountable. It is difficult to hold anybody accountable when a victim chooses not to participate in an investigation or move through the entire UCMJ process or file a report at all. As you also know, unwanted sexual contact is not always a physical assault. It is a wide range of that type of behavior. Ms. McCollum. I don't mean to be rude. I know the definitions well. Admiral Carter. Yes, ma'am. Ms. McCollum. My question is especially laying out the case for alcohol. Admiral Carter. Right. Ms. McCollum. What are you going to do? Admiral Carter. So alcohol for us at the Naval Academy I view as one of the principal root causes of the elements of sexual assault. As you mentioned, 72 percent of our unwanted sexual contacts had alcohol involved. We have been working on this for a year, more so than we ever have in the past. We stood up a task force that went after this directly. The senior class, the class of 2019, has also taken this on in developing a guardian angel program that is out in town with the midshipmen. For many of the other Members, you know the city of Annapolis and our Naval Academy are cojoined, so midshipmen walk directly into town. And getting after this is the most important part. We have gone after this with significant effort this year. We have seen a 49 percent reduction in alcohol related incidents in just this year with some of these programs. And of course, holding the Naval Academy midshipmen accountable for misuse and abuse of alcohol. So all of that is part of getting after that, to reduce alcohol use and misuse. That is part of the campaign to reduce the scourge. General Silveria. Ma'am, I will add from the Air Force Academy some specific steps that we have taken in the area of alcohol. Watching this last year, we also added some increased supervision, and we have also added very similar programs as Admiral Carter mentioned, the guardian angels where the cadets are responsible and also participating in the supervision. And then our AOCs, our commanders that are with the cadets--they are also--we have increased the supervision in areas where there is alcohol so that it is more visible. And then most directly, what we have initiated is an education program for all of our third classmen which is the second year. As they approach drinking age mostly in that year, we initiated an education program that is a lot more focused on the prevention aspect and the effects of alcohol on the prevention. So those are two specific things that we have done directly at the Air Force Academy recently. General Williams. Ma'am, we have 273 young men and women who had the courage to come forward and talk to me and say I was sexually abused in this space. We take that seriously. This is our family. These are our sons and daughters. And so with respect to alcohol, your specific question, we are doing a lot, but we have not done enough. On the 25th of this month, we are doing a stand down across our academy. There will be no classes. There will be no sports. The entire community will come together and revisit where we are. Right now my Commandant as I am here is reviewing all of our policies. We are reviewing how long we keep places where cadets can have access to alcohol. Is that too much? My sense is that it is, and so we are reviewing everything we are doing in this space. There are current policies and procedures, but they are not working, so we need to fix it, and we will. Starting on the 25th with a stand down, coaches, instructors, tactical officers, cadets will come together and talk about how we are going to go forward in this space. Ms. McCollum. Well, thank you. Mr. Chair, I think we need to request what the alcohol policies and disciplines are for all three academies. It should be the same across all three, in my opinion. And you know, what really are the consequences because all of you also mentioned you are collegiate athletic programs too, and we know that our colleges, some of them have taken drug and alcohol abuse very, very seriously for scholarships. So I would like to know what is happening in that realm. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Visclosky. Thank you. Mr. Womack is next, but if I could, if there is other members that have a question on this area, my suggestion is that we stay focused, and I would be happy to recognize people who have questions in the area. And Steve, if you do. Judge? STANDARD OF CONDUCT Mr. Carter of Texas. I am from a time when I went to school, men and women didn't live in the same dormitories. We had curfews at the school I went to. The studies show that the highest consumption of alcohol for any age group is college-aged kids. I don't think anybody will argue with that. In fact, binge drinking originates in colleges and universities. You each have an honor system which is something to be extremely proud of because part of our military is their honor. We as a general public couldn't pledge our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor because we don't--there is a whole lot of us in the civilian world that don't have a sacred honor, but you do. That is the standard, I think, we are trying to reach is that sacred honor. But I also know if anybody knows what the reporting from, pick one, the University of Texas at Austin or Texas Tech University in Lubbock, I went to both schools, what the reporting of sexual assault and sexual abuse and sexual violations are at civilian schools versus military schools. So the use of the word choose. I can understand the attitude should be everybody should be reporting all this stuff, and officers should be in charge. But out in the real world, I talked to my Army fellow, and I am talking about West Point now, but I assume you are all the same. You house by company level, right? Men and women are in the company, and you have commanders which we have people at the Captain level, basically, that oversee these people in the Army. But they are not there 24 hours a day. In fact, you don't want them there 24 hours a day. But when they are there, cadets are not going to behave because it is a military environment when the officer is there like they would behave whether the officer is not there. So you can't be laying it off on the Captain in charge of the company. He may be seeing perfect behavior while he is there because he is the man in charge or the woman in charge. So how do you get around the culture of the military because we would assume, like if I was in dorm, we had a--I won't use the term we had for the guy who checked on us as a freshman and sophomore, and we behaved when he was around, and we didn't behave when he was not around, and I will confess to that. How do we fix that in the military because you can't lay the blame on the officer. He won't see these things happening while he is there. They will happen while he is not there. So I guess that is confusing, but I just--there is so much goes on on college campuses right now, it is unbelievable. But yet we are holding you to a standard of honor, and how do we reach that? I don't know the answer. General Silveria. Sir, thank you. First, I would say that all three of us feel the same way, that we don't know the same kind of numbers as presented in the report that is referenced at other universities. I mean, no one else is taking the time to be as open and transparent and is surveying as specifically at other universities as we are, and we proudly do that, and we want to be open and transparent about it. But at the same time, the reason is because we hold ourselves to that higher standard that you mentioned. So we are not exactly sure what other universities see, but frankly, sir, we are going to continue to hold ourselves to the highest of standards because the Nation expects that, and you expect that of us. Our responsibility that we have to do more of is work on that culture of accountability. So that we all have leadership laboratories. The idea that that senior, that first classmen that is about to be a Lieutenant in the United States Air Force is responsible for what is going on in that space, in that company, in that squadron so we need to work on a culture of accountability. And I will give you one specific at the United States Air Force Academy that my responsibility, first and foremost, is the safety and security of these young men and women, my responsibility to you, the Nation, to their parents and to them. So we have installed thousands of closed circuit TV cameras throughout our dorms for safety and security. As we know, there have been a number of incidents at other universities, and we need to protect them. So that is one direct action that we have taken lately. Mr. Carter of Texas. Thank you. Admiral Carter. Sir, women have been at the Naval Academy since 1976 as they have been at all of our service academies. And from day one we are in Bancroft Hall where all the Brigade of Midshipmen live. We have been intermingled in other words meaning from one room to another, it could be a woman's room or a man's room. The culture of how we live inside Bancroft Hall today actually through this anonymous survey says that the problems of assault are not occurring inside Bancroft Hall. And I would like to think that we have created that culture in there that is similar to being on a Navy ship which is a very enclosed small space where you have men and women now working together. But this, to your point, keeping the eye on Midshipmen so they understand that their life and their daily work when they are in uniform which happens, you know, from very early in the morning until Taps at night, doesn't end. They are also Midshipmen when they are on liberty, they are on overseas travel, or doing summer training, and that has been a theme that we have to constantly work on because for us at the Naval Academy, that is where the majority of these unwanted sexual contact events have occurred. Mr. Carter of Texas. Thank you. General Williams. Congressman, there are two chains of command in the barracks, as you accurately depicted. It is the company commander who has returned, we send them to a college so they get a degree in organizational theory, and they practice the skills they learned, both practitioner from being a combat infantryman, and then they have the theoretical skills to use in action. My expectation is that when these company tactical officers, and there is also a great non-commissioned officer with these company TACs that the cadet chain of command take charge at night, and they hold each other accountable in that space until that Captain or Sergeant are there. So it is two chains of commands that own this. It is just not the TACs, as you accurately depicted. I expect the cadets to hold each other accountable--it is called stewardship. I expect them to own this along with their TACs, and if they have questions, that is what I expect out of our cadets. Mr. Visclosky. Mr. Ruppersberger. Mr. Ruppersberger. Just quickly, it is kind of more of a statement. I served on the Naval Academy board for at least 12 years, and I know that Mr. Womack is on the West Point board, and from the time I got on that board, this was always an issue. Every year the board would get--and I appreciate the openness to the board, but there would be an instance involving sexual harassment or sexual assault, and then we would get reports on our board meetings about what we were doing about it. I will say each superintendent tried to do the best, but I think Admiral Carter has been extremely aggressive, and it is not only about, you know, dealing with it after it happens, it is trying to set the culture before it even happens. And I think that culture--and you talked about Bancroft Hall where you have men and women, the whole--everyone lives in that that one hall, and there haven't been that many incidents there. So it is something we are going to continue to deal with. You have young, immature students that come in in their first year, and every college has them, but we are training our future leaders of tomorrow. We are the strongest country in the world, I believe. One of the reasons is because of our military academies, so we have to have honor, we have to have discipline, and I think part of it too is not just leadership, you doing it, but the people, the 4-year students that go through that have to create that culture and work with the freshmen, especially, as they come in. I don't need an answer. LIKELY TO REPORT Mr. Visclosky. If I could, just two quick points. I want to get to Mr. Womack. One, General Silveria, when we talked, you mentioned that for cadets who bring forth a complaint, you have a personal conversation with them after the fact, and I found it interesting that all of you have referred to culture. Of course, we have a societal culture. You indicated the act itself, obviously, is horrific, but it is jokes, it is the innuendo, it is the other stuff that I assume as you proceed, that is part of that education. Listen. We have got to respect each other. We can't do that any more. I appreciate you do that. A quick question, just kind of yes and no. In the conversations Mr. Calvert and I had with you before, it appears that the military academy, sophomore women and men, are more likely to report. In the Navy, sophomore women and men more likely. Air Force, sophomore and junior women more likely. Is there that bulge, and do the complaints recede in that junior and senior year from your experience? Just kind of yes or no. General Williams. For the sophomore year, the yearling year for West Point, yes. Yes, sir. There is more--that is--of the 4-year experience, the sophomores seem to be reporting more and be more at risk in the space, yes. Admiral Carter. Same at Navy. General Silveria. Sir, that is normally the case. In this year's survey at the Air Force Academy, we saw the increase in what was then the junior class that was taken when the survey was taken which is now our senior class, the class of 2019. So when the survey was taken, they were juniors, and that was where we saw the biggest increase. Mr. Visclosky. Mr. Womack. GENDER AND MINORITY INTEGRATION Mr. Womack. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding the hearing. As I have told my colleagues around this dais that I think because we have--all of us have vetting processes of some type to send our best and brightest young men and women to these academies, a very prestigious honor, that it deserves to have the superintendents of these institutions down here at least on an every other year basis so that we can have this interaction. And my question is more of a help us help you sort of question, and it is related primarily in part to the fact that we have had much more gender integration in the last several years, and there has been an increasing need to try to match the leadership of our institutions with the rank-and-file on the enlisted side, and I think we still have a ways to go to be able to make sure that we have got that proper mix. Now, that doesn't mean that everybody here, all these Members of Congress who have an bazillion other things going on, have to take time out to roam these halls of these high schools to try to figure out who these people are. But General Silveria, you said, and I know because of my relationship to West Point that this past year, class of 2022, we had I think the highest--I will get these mixed up, but either the highest percentage of African Americans in that class on one hand and maybe the second highest of females, and I may have those reversed, but very, very high percentages, and you had indicated the same. How are we doing, and what can we do better to make sure that we are filling the needs of our services from this gender and minority integration standpoint? And I will give each one of you a chance to respond. Admiral Carter. Sir, thank you for the question. The first thing I would tell you is in our application process, we are seeing a rise in female applications even though we are at the highest percentage we have ever been at 28 percent, and minority applications. As I mentioned, we are at 36 percent minorities at the Naval Academy today, and that happens because of our outreach. But there is no question it happens because of the work of you and your staffs who help us and direct us to those locations within your districts to where we can get into the high schools and have our midshipmen visit them which we do. We touched over 50,000 high schoolers and youths last year through our outreach program where we have midshipmen visit various high schools. But maybe more to the point is how well these cohorts are doing, whether it be through the women being at the Naval Academy or the minorities. I have to tell you, we are seeing amazing talent that gets to us. This past year, minorities graduated at a higher rate than their white counterparts for the first time in our 173-year-history. This year, women will graduate at 92.4 percent, the highest of any cohort of any group within the Naval Academy. With 28 percent of women being at the Naval Academy, they hold 37 percent of the brigade leadership positions, so these are leading indicators that all of these cohorts are not just surviving, they are thriving. And I would just say thank you to all the members for bringing this type of talent to our academy. General Silveria. Sir, thank you for the question. What I think that we need to do is that I think we as superintendents owe you better partnership with your staffs and better partnerships with your district staffs because I think we can do better in outreach and working together to expand that outreach to women and to minority populations. Since we cannot solve how many women and minorities are in our population in the final admissions decision, we have to do it, as you pointed out, in the outreach. And so we are all seeing increases. We saw, as you pointed out, the class of 2022, highest percentage of women applicants we had ever seen, 30 percent. And then this year for the class of 2023, over 31 percent. So we are seeing those numbers increase. But I think the answer to your question, sir, is that I think we owe you a better partnership to work together in your districts to find those areas. Some Members, Representative McCollum's district, I know we have 20 cadets from her district. Three of them are going to graduate this year, but there are districts within the House that are not represented near as well, so we need to do that better to partner with members. Mr. Womack. General Williams. General Williams. Thank you, Congressman. 21st century operational environments are complex and require diverse solution sets. And I believe at the United States Military Academy, our current--as you accurately depicted, 24.5 percent of our current population are women, 15.4 percent are African American which exceed our Army percentages in officers for the Army. I absolutely think this is critical, and like my partner from the Naval Academy, they are highly represented, more represented as well in terms of there are only 24.5 percent women at the academy, but they hold 33.6 percent of the chain of command responsibility, so they are integrated. We have also had the opportunity to graduate--11 of the 22 current female Rangers in the United States Army have come from the United States Military Academy. So gender integration is very important to how we are going to solve problems in the future battlefield. Mr. Womack. I will have other questions, but I yield back for the benefit of my colleagues. NUCLEAR ENGINEERING PROGRAM Mr. Kilmer. Thanks, Chairman. I am going to try to cover two topics, if I can, but I want to start with Admiral Carter. I am always amazed whenever I visit the Naval base in my neck of the woods just at the level of complexity, the high technology, not just on the submarines but on all of the platforms that we depend on next generation engineers to work on. I guess I wanted to get a sense from you how you feel the Naval Academy is positioned to recruit and train those next generation engineers. I also know or I have heard about the new nuclear engineering program, and I thought if you could take a second and talk about why you developed that program and how those graduates will further the mission into the future. Admiral Carter. Thank you, Congressman. As you point out, the STEM based academic program at the Naval Academy is what is required to go serve in our complex and technical Navy today. Our Chief of Naval Operations directs us to produce 65 percent of our graduates that go on to be Ensigns in the Navy to come from the STEM fields. We have been exceeding that for the last 5 years across all the Ensigns that graduate. Now, granted, the Naval Academy curriculum is liberal arts based, but it is a minor in engineering for everyone from English majors to Chinese majors to, of course, the mechanical engineers and now our new majors in nuclear engineering. I would submit that all of our graduates can be ready to go into the nuclear engineering field. It is the strength of the overall curriculum, but the need to have a detail and what we have developed over the last couple of years is not just classroom education but now immersive capstone experiential based learning programs. These are now turning into projects where midshipmen are doing research with faculty members and coming up with new ideas for how to do things. So we have seen some great success there. I think we are very poised to continue to serve on nuclear powered aircraft carriers and on nuclear powered submarines based on the curriculum that we have. Thank you. INTEREST IN SERVING Mr. Kilmer. Thank you. The other thing I wanted to just get a sense from any of you interested in weighing in on this is just getting a sense of what you are seeing in terms of differences between the past generations and the millenial generation. You know, if you are seeing any differences in terms of what makes millenials interested in serving our country, if you observed any differences in what drives a millenial to seek an education at one of the academies, and any differences in terms of how you teach and train millenials. General Silveria. Sir, it is a tough question, but thank you. I will give a couple of thoughts of what we see. I think what I see among the cadets that I spend time with is this remarkable interest in wanting to serve and wanting to make a difference. And some other indications are not just that these are 17-year-olds that are raising their right hand and showing up at the academies. I mean, we have seen highest numbers of community service hours in our local community that we have ever seen before. They are out and about, really truly wanting to make a difference. Recently we signed a cadet that is going to show up who happens to be a recruited athlete. And in one of those things out of a 17-year-old that you just always wonder what makes them say that is that this young man was considered to be playing at a number of other universities across the country, and he said it is not about the next 4 years, it is about the next 40 years. I want to serve. And so we see that again and again within this generation. Admiral Carter. Sir, I would just say as we are finishing the end of the millenial generation, we are actually now seeing the centennial generation that is in our ranks, and they are even slightly different. And I appreciate Jay's answer here, but this is a generation that values service. They value education. They have never not known anything but the high speed internet. So when you think about that, somebody that is coming into the Naval Academy, West Point, or the Air Force Academy, they are less affected by the events of 9/11 because they might have been only 1 or 2 years old, and they have never not had high speed internet, so they are used to answers at their fingertips. Their thirst for learning and the ability to multi-task is unlike anything we have ever seen. So regardless of how we want to talk about different generations, this new generation that is now coming into our ranks is exceptional, and it makes me very excited for the future. Mr. Kilmer. That is great. General Williams. Thank you, Congressman. I have had the opportunity to not only be a cadet at West Point, but I went back as a Captain. I was walking those halls at 3:00 in the morning watching my company. Then I came back as a Lieutenant Colonel, and now as a superintendent, and I am not so sure I could get in the United States Military Academy now. But they are fit, they are smart, they want to serve, and I have watched. I have seen changes as was mentioned in an earlier question about the demographic. I have watched the demographic. The complexion of what West Point looks like right now, it looks differently than when I entered there in 1979, 1980. And I think it is because these cadets want to be part of something bigger than themselves, and they want to win. Mr. Kilmer. Terrific. Thanks. Thank you, Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Visclosky. The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Diaz-Balart. COMMUNICATION WITH THE ACADEMIES Mr. Diaz-Balart. Chairman, thank you very much. A lot was said about the issue of abuse, and I think that is obviously something that all of us--and I frankly appreciate the fact that you all have shown great commitment to that, and so I appreciate that. Mr. Chairman, less than a question; really, kind of a comment. So we work really hard, and I have a person on my staff who works year-round to promote the academies, and she goes, and she actually goes into the high schools. And then at SouthCom, we have an academy day, and I will tell you that just for you all to know, the communication that my office has with the academies is phenomenal. I hear that from my folks all the time. The folks that--and we have usually again, you know, a hundred or more folks that come to academy day. But this is the comment I wanted to make. So I have had the privilege of having even some interns who have then have gone to the academies or folks that I have known, and it is an interesting thing to see. And so the transformation that occurs from--these are bright men and women because for them to get into the academy, they have to have-- frankly, they are pretty impressive human beings to start with, but I will just tell you. For you, it is not a surprise, but I will tell you that to me, it is still an amazing thing to see. When I speak to parents out there as we try to promote the academies, I tell them I don't do this to promote the academies. I do it to promote--to help these individuals and to help the country. But you have these fine, patriotic, good students going to the academies as kids, and when they come out of there, not only are they highly educated and proficient, but you can see the change, and you can see the change immediately in that first year. So I just wanted to--again, less of a question than a comment, just to let you know that some of us, again, and it is--there is no better--there are no better institutions of learning in the world, but it is beyond just learning. It is this character building that you all do. So as you heard from Mr. Womack as well, you know, what else can we do because obviously we heard about the effects of sequester that they have had to the academies, and so I am hoping that we have opportunities now to be able to be very, very helpful. I don't think that there is a better investment in taxpayer money for the future of our country, our military, and also, frankly, for these individuals than what you all do. So thank you for what you do. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Visclosky. Mr. Ruppersberger. LACK OF FUNDING Mr. Ruppersberger. Thank you all for being here. I am going to get into some budget issues. I am going to really ask a question of Admiral Carter at this point since I have been on that board, and we do have briefings, and what I have seen in the last maybe 3 or 4 years and probably of lot of it having to do with sequestration that your operating budget has stayed flat, and yet you continue to have more expenses. And sooner or later, something is going to hit, and it is not going to be positive. And it seems to me--and I am also co-chair of the Army Caucus with Judge Carter, so we deal with General Milley on budgeting issues as far as West Point is concerned. I am sorry I don't deal as much with the Air Force. But getting back to the issue. Could you let us know how the increased costs and lack of funding are affecting your ability to do your mission and train our future leaders of tomorrow? Now, I know when you are in the military, it is yes, sir, no, sir, no excuses, sir, and it is difficult for you sometimes to complain when this is--you get your number and that is it, but we are independent. Our job on the board and here is to make sure you get your resources. So let us know at this point where you are, how this lack of funding is affecting you, and how we need to improve it to make sure we continue the proficiency of these institutions. Then I am going to get to capital after this. Admiral Carter. Congressman, thanks for the question. As you know, at the Naval Academy, there are kind of two elements to this operating and maintenance budget. The first is what it costs for us to basically operate the Naval Academy, that is to pay for faculty, operate our training craft, and do travel and training for midshipmen. As you stated, we have been flat since really 2012, and sequestration made it difficult, so that is roughly about $141 million operating budget of which now today nearly 75 percent of that is to take care of our civilian faculty and staff, and that is a workforce of about 2,000 people, military and civilian, that take care of the 4,400 midshipmen. So these are tough decisions that had to be made, but we are operating at about $14 million below where we should be. Mr. Ruppersberger. Fourteen million? Admiral Carter. Fourteen million below, and that is to take care of the day-to-day business. We are, quite honestly, our own worst enemy. We have great success in our graduation rate and our reputation, but over time that will become problematic if we continue on that path. Mr. Ruppersberger. And unfortunately, sometimes your budget coming from the Pentagon or the Naval office, you are the last when you are looking for readiness and all of those issues. How has that impacted your ability to do your job? Admiral Carter. The impact has been less people and doing lab technician work certainly less--for example, our library. Our library has become somewhat stagnant. We barely have enough money to do magazine subscriptions and hold the type of quality library that we should have, but mostly it is in the hiring process, you know. We are limited by the number of people we can hire, and we are making it fit. We have added extra programs within that budget to include the cyber operations major which we knew was needed. The entire sexual assault, sexual harassment team that we have which is a clear priority has also been embedded in that budget. So although it has remained flat, we are still able to do our mission. We have still been successful, but it is going to have further impact down the road. If it is not---- Mr. Ruppersberger. Which is not a positive impact, and I assume the other academies have the same issue and the same problem? General Silveria. Sir, if I could just add one other piece. A lot of times we talk about infrastructure that perhaps that doesn't necessarily reflect one element which is our information technology, the IT infrastructure. For us to deliver higher education in the 21st century, we have had to make significant investment in our IT infrastructure, and we are still short. So a lot of times we do talk about the buildings, and that is important in facilities, but the IT infrastructure is how we deliver 21st century---- INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS Mr. Ruppersberger. That is very important. Now, I know at the Naval Academy, you know, around 2005 none of the academies knew anything about cyber, and I think that is when I was on that board, and as a result of at least the Naval Academy, I think, you worked with NSA, your leadership realized and you built a new building. And it is one of the quickest measures that you have put in place since you have been there, and I assume the same is going on with all three now. But I am going to get into the infrastructure issue real quick. Bancroft Hall as an example. How old is Bancroft Hall? Admiral Carter. So Bancroft Hall was built in 1903 as a four-wing dormitory, and it was finished in 1961. An eight-wing dormitory covers 33 acres. All 4,400 midshipmen live there and eat there. Mr. Ruppersberger. Well, on my role on the board, I have heard of all sorts of issues, health issues, fungi and you know, all those things, and you know, you have got to take care of that, and I understand that that is a big issue too, in a lot of the buildings, even though we have one new cyber building. Could you tell me a little bit about your infrastructure problems and how far you are down on that also? I know you have gotten a little money in the last couple years, but it is not enough. Could you explain that? Admiral Carter. Sir, to give you a snapshot quick summary, we had a flagship agreement with the Department of the Navy that funds us through the Naval Facilities Command budget, and that was to fund us for sustainment maintenance as well as restoration maintenance for the infrastructure. There is another pot of money that takes care of basically mowing the grass and trimming the trees as a historical site that is visited by over 2 million people a year just do look at the Naval Academy. But since sequestration, the reduction in those cost levels have gone down. Funding since sequestration has been down more than 40 percent. Mr. Ruppersberger. Forty percent. Admiral Carter. Forty percent. So sustainment was reduced from $36 million to $26 million, and recapitalization was reduced from $35 million to $15 million, and we have gotten some relief. The RM or recapitalization money is now at an every other year of $15 million, so it gives us some predictability. But if you were to ask me right now what do we need to be whole, to get the Naval Academy, even though I have about $180 million worth of work between new construction and recapitalization going on today, so there is some relief. But going forward, that budget line will have to be adjusted by about $35 million a year to make us okay going forward, and that is to include how we do maintenance on at least one wing in Bancroft Hall every year. Mr. Ruppersberger. Well, leadership is extremely important, and I think it is really important for this committee to be aware of these numbers and how it seems you are at the end of the line when it comes to money recently, and I think it is this committee's obligation to really look into these numbers at all three of the academies, whether it is operation or whether it is capital because if we don't have the leadership that is coming out of these academies, we don't take care of it, we are going to start to suffer. And you know the threats, the world threats we have, Russia, China and all of these other issues. Thank you. Mr. Visclosky. Mr. Womack. SUSTAINED PREDICTABLE FUNDING Mr. Womack. I would argue that if the institutions are so incredibly important that people around this dais would nominate their best and brightest young men and women to go there that they deserve to not be neglected from a recapitalization standpoint. I just wanted to give a quick moment for General Williams because of my relationship to the board there and what I know about a place called Camp Buckner, that if you have never been there, you need to go. I would argue that that is the place where the military component of what we are doing for these young men and women at West Point is actually taking place. Give us a quick depiction of Camp Buckner and why it needs attention? General Williams. Congressman, thank you. First, let me thank you for all of the support you provided us in the past. I work very closely with our Army leadership, and what we require is sustained predictable funding over the long haul. That is why Camp Buckner--I will tell you that our FSRM, our sustainment and renovation and maintenance has been very, very well. We have worked very closely with our Army leadership, and we feel pretty comfortable in our ability to maintain our facilities. The West Point military complex, Camp Buckner, is where we do our military training. So the sophomore group that we talked about earlier, our yearlings, spend their summer training there. It really is vital to the M in United States Military Academy. As I mentioned, the academic pillar, the physical pillar, but where the cadets do military things in the summer, after their first year as freshmen or plebes, this is their first introduction to how we do things in the military and move on towards the crucible of ground combat. It needs work. We have 410 structures on West Point. Most of those structures are Q3 and Q4, and many of those structures are out at Camp Buckner. It is Camp Buckner, but equally important is Camp Natural Bridge where we bring in real soldiers from the Army to come in and partner with the yearlings in that summer. So the infrastructure required out there needs some work at Camp Buckner. Mr. Visclosky. Mr. Aguilar and then Judge Carter. CYBER CURRICULUM Mr. Aguilar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to revisit on kind of the curriculum issue that Mr. Kilmer and Mr. Ruppersberger mentioned a little bit. Specifically, we have all read the open source documents on our threats assessment, and you spoke about cyber in your comments as well. But specifically related to that, what challenges do we have in growing and maintaining, you know, these programs? This is something that obviously didn't exist from a curriculum standpoint years ago. So how do we prepare for that? What types of research and extracurricular activities can individuals take related to the cyber field? Admiral Carter. So we started our journey into cyber curriculum dating back prior to 2010 as Congressman Ruppersberger alluded to. Today over that period of time, we have mandatory courses for our freshmen and our junior. We are one of the few, if not the only school in the country, that has that because we think everybody baseline, whether they are an aviator or Navy SEAL needs to have an understanding in this important domain. The academic major is only now in its fourth year. It was developed over time. As you can imagine, there are not a lot of Ph.D.S out there in our country that are educated in cyber, so we mostly recruit practitioners from places like the National Security Agency to come and teach at the Naval Academy. The desire to get into this field is remarkable. I mentioned we have 25 academic majors today. Last year's class graduated with 22 cyber operations majors. The sophomore class, the year they pick their majors this year, started at 110 cyber operations majors. Roughly one tenth of the whole class is in one major. It is the fifth most popular major at the Naval Academy, so our midshipmen get it. There are a tremendous amount of activities for them to do, whether they are a cyber operations major or not. The National Security Agency runs a contest every year, a war game, if you will, between the service academies to include Coast Guard and our Canadian friends, and it is a combination of Capture the Flag, moving data around, intruding our networks, and the cadets and midshipmen have to identify those and put patches on those. It is remarkable work, and sometimes we have been asked to go brief the Pentagon on what they have learned from those exercises. Our midshipmen are also involved in policy contests. NY University, New York University has one of the top in the country, and they go internationally, and they compete very, very well. So this is a big topic at the Naval Academy. And to end the conversation, thanks to the Members of Congress, in 2016, we received $120 million to build probably the last major academic building on our 338-acre campus, Hopper Hall. It is just about getting ready to be framed out and be operational in 2020. It will be where all the cyber operations education will happen, and embedded in this is a sensitive compartmented information facility where we can teach at the classified level, something we have never had at the Naval Academy. So this is the cyber field of dreams. This is the future, and we are attracting a lot of great talent from all over the country because they know that we have this capability to teach. General Silveria. Sir, I will add that we are also very much in this space in that our Cyber Innovation Center will be breaking ground on our new facility later this in year. We are also uniquely placed in Colorado Springs to have the ability to partner with the National Cybersecurity Center Air Force Space Command that is in Colorado Springs and U.S. Space Command that is standing up, so we benefit from that greatly in the area. I will also point out that you mentioned the research, and so we have one of the three cyber cities that are in the United States where cadets can hack into the cities and to function around in cyberspace, to hone their skills and practice their skills and work their research. But also, sir, it has to be also about getting into the high schools. There are so many cyber competitions now that go on around the United States, and that is really a growing element. We all went through the years as the robotics competitions continued to grow, and we seek out those want-to-be engineers. Well, now we have an opportunity as the cyber competitions are growing to get out and find those want-to-be cyber warriors because it is not just about computer science. It is an important element here. It is about teaching cadets that are ready to fight and defend in cyberspace which is very different, and so we are all taking that on up front and directly. Mr. Aguilar. Thank you. General. General Williams. It is important that we fight and win in this domain. The cyber domain is absolutely critical to the land domain, the air, our maritime brothers and sisters. We have 25 young men and women, they are hand selected, who are going to join the cyber ranks this summer. They will commission in a few months. The folks who are responsible, they come to West Point. They recruit these folks. They are our best cadets. They are physically fit, they are smart, they think critically. It is very important they have those skills in this space. We also have the opportunity--the Army has been very gracious to me. We have got the Army Cyber Institute which is right outside of our gate, and the cadets get to practice real- time the things they learn in the classroom with the Army cyber. We hold a big conference every year. Our cadets and cadre put that on here in Washington, DC. And then finally, I think the linkage to our Futures Command which just stood up is an opportunity to link all of these domains. As we think about multi domain operations, cyber is a critical part of those domains. Mr. Aguilar. Thank you. I appreciate the answer. Admiral Carter, just a quick followup. You mentioned the cyber competition including the Coast Guard and Canadians. Who won the last one? Admiral Carter. Sir, I am happy to report Navy has won 3 out of the last 4 years. General Silveria. But not the last one. Mr. Aguilar. You know what? In Washington he did just an amazing job with that answer, right? Thank you so much. If the Canadians win, you can expect to be called up for a hearing right afterwards. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Visclosky. Mr. Carter. REFURBISHING OF BUILDINGS Mr. Carter of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I represent Fort Hood, and for the last 4 or 5 years I have been refurbishing barracks and building new barracks at Fort Hood. Blessed by the support of this group and MILCON, we are getting that done, but I have had to go through some pretty horrible spaces where soldiers were living. And Admiral, I read your letter that you sent out. Admiral Carter. Yes, sir. Mr. Carter of Texas. It feels just like a flashback to all the bad things I have seen in our barracks at Fort Hood, the stachybotrys mold growing on the walls, and I am very familiar with that having been put out of my home for an whole year because of that mold. And it shocked me because Annapolis is one of the prime tourist areas in this area. Everybody that comes up here wants to go at least take a look at Annapolis because it is close to Washington. So I asked General Williams about how things were. Do they have those kinds of problems? He said to some extent, yes. I recognize the Air Force was created, your academy was created in my lifetime, but it is still got to be 50 years or something, I don't know. It is got to be a good while ago when it was. We have got to address that. We can't have that kind of working and living environment in our academies. It is just--it shouldn't happen. I am one that is going to be working on that because I think that is extremely important, and some of that stuff is a health issue, a real, legitimate health issue. But in looking at this, also, where you have a historical building and you are going to try fix it, holy cow. It costs a lot more money. Now, I don't know whether the Air Force would be designated historical yet, but I know the two schools that you have, everything there is historical buildings. Does that cost you more when you start going in to fix the types of things that you described in your letter? Does that enhance that? It is all an historical--everybody gets designations, and there are ways to get that waived, at least at the State level. And if you have to deal with that at the Federal level, then it doubles your cost. Maybe we can figure out a way to waive those--some of that materials replacement at the Federal level. Do you understand what I am talking about? Admiral Carter. Yes, sir, I completely do, and I would tell you that we are very respectful of the historic nature of many of our buildings, most of them built between 1900 and 1920, Bancroft Hall being, I would argue, the most important because it does house the Brigade of Midshipmen. There are challenges because you are not going to change the concrete structure of it. The roof is a challenge. I don't have the luxury of shutting down Bancroft Hall completely and gutting it because it is the only place we house midshipmen, so it is really important that we do it carefully, plan it. The ability to repair a wing or so a year is optimal. It should be on an every 30-year recapitalization or remodernization for its life, for it to sustain its life. The way we are funded right now, we don't have that type of money. I have $4 million right now that I am doing repairs to make sure that the rooms are safe, that there is no mold, and that we are reducing the amount of leaks that sometimes come through an aging roof. But this is part of the challenge, and we won't ever end it because of the nature of where we live, the humidity levels. So we understand that, but we are not planning on going anywhere, so we will continue to fight for it. General Silveria. Sir, at Air Force we are an historical registered site. Our challenge is that all of the facilities at Air Force were all built around the same time, late 1950s and early 1960s, so subsequently, they are all aging out at the same time, so we need that same support for the continued recapitalization. To delay sustainment and maintenance to repair such as dormitories only costs more later at those facilities. And just as Admiral Carter says, none of us have the space that we can afford to empty facilities and then remodel them. We have to do them in phases over years. So we have two main dormitories. Our Sijan Hall named after Lance Sijan is also something that next year, we will be looking to begin a multi-phase program because it houses 2,300 cadets. General Williams. Congressman, we are halfway through our nine barracks. We call it the Cadet Barracks Upgrade Program or CBUP. And then we have an academic building upgrade program which we are also executing at this time. Working very closely, we have a plan both interim and then mid term and then long term. With your great support over time, we will be able to execute that, so we are halfway through where our cadets live, revitalizing, updating all of the barracks area, and the academic buildings, That work is just beginning. Mr. Carter of Texas. You are all creating American heroes, the best of the best, and we owe it to you. I think we ought to seriously consider taking a look at setting aside funding for this capitalization and taking into mind that they have got to continue to operate while they do that, and that allows them to shut down completely. I don't know where we are on something like that, but I would sure like to talk about it. Mr. Visclosky. Judge, I want to follow up on your line of questioning later, and I would point out you make a very solid point, and I am very concerned about some of the academies' ability to plan that work, and I am very happy to have a hearing going to follow up on that. Ms. McCollum. CLIMATE CHANGE Ms. McCollum. Mr. Chair, I am not too far out of what you and Judge Carter were talking about. Admiral Carter, if I remember correctly from our conversation, the Air Force and the Army, West Point, they each have their own dedicated line item for the academies in the budget line, and the Navy is working to address to make sure you get a line yourself now. For the first time, we will see that in this budget. Am I remembering that conversation correctly? Admiral Carter. You are. Currently my up to 2019 budget goes through the Chief of Naval Personnel. They are our support sponsor for our budget line. Ms. McCollum. So I think that will help us do better oversight on that. We had a conversation about the size of the different facilities. Is the Navy facility 338 acres? Admiral Carter. Yes, ma'am. It is 338 acres. Ms. McCollum. And West Point is over 16,000 acres, and the Air Force Academy is over 18,000 acres? General Silveria. Actually, over 19. Ms. McCollum. Over 19. Well we will get that fixed on the internet. The reason why I bring this up is I am going to ask about climate change, and ground zero is the Naval Academy. So as you are talking about all your infrastructure needs, I think this committee needs to be mindful in talking to the Navy and the Pentagon about what they are going to do separate and above what needs to happen with the structures at Annapolis and how they are going to plan for and implement what needs to happen with climate change. If you would just take a minute because we will dig into this deeper and then have more discussions with you at a later date, but we need to talk about--let's use a Naval term sea level rise, if people are not comfortable with climate change on here. So just what are some of the things that you want to put on this committee's radar screen because that has to be separate. It cannot be competing with what needs to happen with the other facilities on campus. Admiral Carter. Thank you, ma'am. And it is an important issue for not just the Naval Academy but really many of our Naval installations that reside on the Chesapeake. We at the top of the Chesapeake see the significance. In the month of September, we had 16 nuisance floodings in the month alone, so this is a real issue for us. To give you an idea of how we are attacking this, we have a sea level rise---- Mr. Visclosky. I am sorry. I didn't hear that. What did you just say? Admiral Carter. Sixteen nuisance floodings in September, this past September alone. So we have a Sea Level Rise Advisory Committee. We have considered how other nations have dealt with sea level rise, especially the Scandinavian countries. We are looking through the science of where the sea level will be 50 years from now and 100 years from now when we are still going to be on the Severn River. Data shows us that the Naval Academy will see a one to one and a half foot rise by 2050 and 4.3 feet by 2100. There are certain sea walls that we are already planning to raise up to be ready for that. The strategy for how to deal with sea level rise is really pretty simple. You either block it, you move it, or you abandon it. And for the benefit of the committee here, the Naval Academy reclaimed about 55 acres from the Severn River to create our boundary fields in the 1950s. We would like to not give them back. So this is an important issue for us and one that will continue, and as Congresswoman McCollum pointed out, this is above and beyond the budgetary things that we have planned. So this is a concern for the Navy and the Naval Academy. Ms. McCollum. Thank you. Mr. Visclosky. Mr. Calvert. OVERRELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY Mr. Calvert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to discuss on the curriculum front. Admiral, when you were by the other day we were talking about overreliance on technology, the problems we have been having with ship collision. Part of the problem is navigational age, overreliance on technology, and the move away from maps, charts to determine where we are at. And it used to be that you go on a Navy ship, there was always navigational charts on the bridge. We moved away from that, moved away from celestial navigation being even taught at the Naval Academy. The same thing, I would--for the Air Force. If we didn't have GPS, I wonder, you know, how these planes are going to land nowadays. And even the Army and the Marine Corps using iPads instead of maps and charts. I understand they are going back to maps and charts in the field for obvious reasons. You never know when these things are just going to shut down, and this goes on throughout, I would expect, the military enterprise, that we have become so used to technology that we forget how we navigate, how we operate without those aids. Are we training these young people to be able to not rely on technology if things go wrong? Admiral Carter. Well, I will start off by saying when you come to the Naval Academy, the first thing you do in plebe summer is you learn how to sail. So there isn't a whole lot of technology involved when you are learning how to sail. You are learning the elements of the seas and the wind. That is a good baseline for how to transition to how to operate a Navy vessel. We have 18 yard patrol craft at the Naval Academy. They are basic trainers, and it is about seamanship and navigation. But at the end of the day, as you point out, we have to continue to remind our people that one of the most important things to do when you are operating on the seas is to look outside. You can't just look at an instrument or look at an electronic chart. You have to continue to look outside. I couldn't agree with you more. I personally in my 37 years of being in the Navy have experienced loss of connections to the GPS satellites, so it is a real thing. It does happen. We have taken a hard look at our curriculum and what we do in seamanship and navigation. We have not brought back a full celestial navigation course as I took in 1978, but we do touch on that so midshipmen understand the complexity, and the fleet has now brought it back as a standard requirement. So we continue to make sure that we are preparing these young men and women to go out and not just operate high tech equipment but be able to do the basics when all that stuff might not work as well as it should. Mr. Calvert. Thank you. General Silveria. Sir, for an Air Force Academy cadet, one of the very first things they do is fly in a glider and fly in a sail plane, so there is very little technology involved in a glider. And they are towed up to space, up to the airspace, and learn those basic principles of flight so from the very beginning. We have a very robust glider program that is one of the most unique in the world. Our cadets, our junior and senior cadets teach the first year cadets the soaring program. And we know consistently those cadets that are instructors in our glider program which speaks directly to your point, those instructors perform remarkably well in pilot training and beyond when they go out and join the force. And I will add, sir, that prior to being the superintendent at the academy, I was deployed to the Middle East and conducted at the operational level operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria and very much handled every day the training and the recognition that we always needed to know that at any moment, some element of our technology would not be available. And so the forces, all forces train that way operationally, and all forces function that way recognizing that at times, we may lose that technology. General Williams. And I wanted to mention Congressman, it is very important that they understand the tenacity and the grit and the determination required to win in that dimension. And so from day one of the as new cadets or plebes, they are on their feet a lot and they are walking. And they are walking up and down hills, and they don't have any technology with them. In their sophomore year, their yearling year, if you will, they get exposed to more of the military skills required of being a logistician or an infantryman or artilleryman. I will tell you as an artilleryman, that is one of the things we teach is that do not rely on the technology. You have to understand the charts and darts, if you will. What are the physics of how you make a round go from point A to point B? And not only in the summer as a practition, but also in the classroom. Our Department of Military Instruction does a great job of teaching the history. And they talk about leaders of past and the operational environments they had to dominate and win in the past. And these are the same immutable characteristics of our current operating environment, so it is important that they understand the toughness, the grit, and determination to fight and win in those environments. Mr. Calvert. Yeah. I just bring that up because I think the first thing our adversaries will do in case we get into a real war is you are not going to have the technology you think you are going to have, so I appreciate that. Thank you. Mr. Visclosky. I am going to turn to Ms. Kaptur in a moment. I would simply note that Mr. Ryan, who could not be with us today, has three questions for the record, and gentleman, if you could have those answered for us, I would appreciate it. Two of them deal with dietary habits and the food environment. I must tell you. I have a special interest too. As I describe my life when I am in Indiana, I eat happy food. When I am here with my wife, I eat healthy. Ms. Kaptur. MEDICAL PROFESSION Ms. Kaptur. Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, and I apologize for being late. I had another committee I was required to be at. We thank you for your service to our country and for shaping the next generation. I was very interested in your testimony. You used the word character, developing character. I would like to ask a whole lot of questions about that, but in my brief time, let me just say I am interested in each of the academies. How many of those who are being educated ultimately move into a medical profession, either as a doctor or a physician assistant? Do you have those numbers available, or do you have a sense of that? Admiral Carter. At the Naval Academy, it is roughly 12 of our thousand graduates go into the Naval medical corps which supports the Navy and the Marine Corps and the largest enlisted force of any rating for the United States Navy. Ms. Kaptur. Twelve of each? Admiral Carter. Twelve per year. Ms. Kaptur. Per year. General Williams. Ma'am, for West Point, we will graduate in this class, 20 will be doctors, medical doctors. It averages about 20 from year to year is our average. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. General Silveria. And ma'am, we are right between those two; typically to 15 to 18. Ms. Kaptur. Do you think that is too low a number? Admiral Carter. I will just answer for the Naval Academy. We take a look at this, and of course, we fill the requirements that are given to us by higher Navy through the Chief of Naval Personnel. It is one of the few communities that is not a direct war-fighting role that we do provide graduates, but we find that our graduates that go into the doctor roles from the Naval Academy have a very high retention rate and do very well. So I am happy that we provide some, and I think personally, this is my view, the number is about right. Ms. Kaptur. Well, I would ask this, if you could, to think about this question and provide for the record a reply. The U.S. military finished 2018 with the highest suicide rate among active duty personnel in at least 6 years. We lost 321, including the Admiral of the Fifth Fleet, whom we had met in Tampa not long ago. In our society, if we look at what is going on, with the mass murders from coast to coast, the majority of those who are perpetrating these crimes are young people who have severe mental issues that have not been sufficiently addressed. I have been struggling myself with what do we do as a country, and one of the facts that I have learned is that we are about 100,000 doctors short in our country of those who can diagnose either at the pediatric level or at the adult level, and we have time bombs just waiting to go off all over this country. So being 100,000 physicians short, I say to myself is there a way we can invent a program to produce more doctors who would have these skills? We learned from Special Forces that when they embedded behavioral specialists, not necessarily doctors but behavioral specialists in units, the suicide rate went down to the military average. The average isn't good, but in any case. So I thought to myself how do we produce doctors in this field? Could there be a combined public program that links to the private sector? I don't if the military could have a role in that, but my goodness. We need more people adequately qualified. I can guarantee you that at the veterans--when folks come home and they rotate out and they come to our clinics and so forth, we don't have enough personnel in our veterans hospitals and clinics to accommodate those who are demonstrating a much higher level of suicide than in past generations. So I wanted to ask you. Have you ever given any thought to this? Is there some way that we could fund additional students who could go on in the medical fields that our society so desperately needs? Even if we could create a program that would partly be funded by their service to the country both militarily and on the civilian side when they would rotate out, perhaps? Have you ever given any thought to this? Admiral Carter. Ma'am, the numbers of Naval Academy Ensigns that go into the medical corps is a very small percentage of the Navy doctors that are produced for the U.S. Navy and the Marine Corps. The great majority of them are produced through an Officer Candidate School program that is specifically designated to take those civilians that are already in medical school or have finished medical school and then transition in the Navy. It is also one of the few ranks where you can come in after being a full-fledged doctor in whatever your specialty is and come in at a mid grade level. So this is a Navy challenge more than a Naval Academy challenge. However, to your point, I would submit that as great as our young men and women are, they are not immune from these challenges. We have a Midshipmen Development Center which is specifically designed to help midshipmen with mental health, and our appointments are full. I have seen the appointment level triple over my 5 years as superintendent. And as much as that might sound like it may be not necessarily a good thing, what I would tell you is the stigma of going to see somebody and say I am having a bad day is not there at the Naval Academy. I think I could say on behalf of all of our programs here, it is a busy time when you are a midshipman or a cadet. There is not a lot of time to get away and just take a couple days off, so it is a tough program. The Midshipmen Development Center is a great need for us and helps build the resiliency of our midshipmen. General Silveria. Ma'am, I would like to add that as the Navy, as Admiral Carter mentioned, we are also responsive to the needs of the Air Force, but we are one source of the commissioned officers that come into the United States Air Force. So the Reserve Officer Training Corps as well as our OTS, our Officer Training School, they provide commissioned officers. In a similar way that the Navy does, commissioned officers have a way of getting into the United States Air Force through other universities. So our physicians, our cadets that graduate and go to medical school are one part of the entire picture for the rest of the Air Force, for those that are going into medical school. And similar to Navy, we all have programs that are very robust in cadet counseling, that are available to the cadets. There is very much a network of care that surrounds them where they can go if they just need to talk to somebody, if they just need to get away for a moment, to try to determine if they have--even to try to determine if they have a larger problem. So we have a counseling center. We have family life counselors. We have chaplains that are available, a consistent network of care that is around the cadets. Ms. Kaptur. General, have you ever had cadets who developed mental illness onsets in the academy? General Silveria. Yes, ma'am, we have. Over time, we have had cadets that have developed mental illness at the academy, and in addition to our counseling center, we have medical professionals that are mental health professionals that are able to provide the health and care of those cadets through the time. Ms. Kaptur. Is there any way each of you could estimate for the record because most of these illnesses onset in the late teens and 20s, what percentage of those who are admitted do develop these conditions, and what happens to them? Are they discharged, then? And if they are discharged, are they discharged to care, or are they just discharged to the street? General Silveria. Ma'am, I will continue to answer. I will have to get for the record the numbers of those that we have had, but we have a number of ways that we care for young men and women. We provide that care to them directly, and they have ways that they can take time away from the academy. We have an opportunity for them to take six months away or a year away so that they can go and heal and get the care that they need and then return to the academy. So that is one avenue that they have to receive the care. Ms. Kaptur. General, thank you. General Williams. Congresswoman, we have the same similar construct. The medical leave of absence if we find a cadet over their 4 years who develops some sort of mental health issue and need help, they can leave the academy. I am the one that authorizes the leave. And if they need to stay longer, they will stay longer so they can get that care. But like my teammates here, while they are at West Point, we have a host of professionals that can help them, whether it be our Center for Enhanced Performance, we are talking about resilience. How do you increase or ensure that mental and spiritual and physical resilience is maintained over our 47- month experience. We have lots of coaches. We have a Center for Enhanced Performance. We have a Cadet Professional Development Center. We have chaplains as others have mentioned. We have a military family life counselor, so there is a network of folks who are standing by to nurture and coach and make sure the cadets graduate in their 47-month experience. Ms. Kaptur. Have the academies experienced any suicides this year or in prior years? Admiral Carter. We have not had one this year. We have had, on occasion, suicides in past years. They are rare, but we have. And to answer your question for the record, I don't have the exact numbers of those that develop mental illness and the details of how we handled them, so I would like to provide that separately, ma'am. Ms. Kaptur. Thank you. General, did you wish to say something? General Silveria. Ma'am, I was going to say we have not had any suicides in the past few years. We have had cadets with suicide ideations that we provide care for and allow them to receive mental health support. General Williams. At West Point, we have had no suicides this year. We have had some in the past, ma'am. Ms. Kaptur. All right. Well, you know, I am not going to leave anybody who has a budget off the hook. We need doctors in this country. We have needed them for a long time. We have to figure out how to train them and get them out serving both in the military and in civilian society. I hope you give that some consideration as you plan your programming for next year, and I would love to hear from you for the record on that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Visclosky. Mr. Womack. Mr. Crist. SEA LEVEL R"
