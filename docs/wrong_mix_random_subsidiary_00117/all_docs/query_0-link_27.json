John always like to set goals and meet challenges. He participated in many walks in Canada and in Holland, and it was something that made him and his family proud. He loved to sing, John was known as the singing carpenter. John’s “haha” book, always made an appearance at happy hour, he loved telling jokes and making his family and friends laugh and smile. Gardening was something that made John feel at ease, being in his greenhouse was his true happy place. John “Big Foot” will be truly missed by everyone who knew him."
