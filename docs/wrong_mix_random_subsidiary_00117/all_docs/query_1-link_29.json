Mills and Provost Georgina Dopico have announced the appointment of Joan Kee as the Judy and Michael Steinhardt Director of the New York University Institute of Fine Arts (IFA), effective August 19, 2024.\n\nA respected scholar of modern and contemporary art of Asia and the United States, Kee is a professor of the history of art at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor and holds a law degree from Harvard and a PhD from the IFA.\n\nRead MORE about Joan Kee\n\nNational Endowment for the Humanities Awards $150K to the Conservation Center to Strengthen Fine Arts Conservation Education at NYU\n\nThe Division of Preservation and Access of the National Endowment for the Humanities has awarded $150,000 to the Conservation Center of the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, to support the project âPreserving Living Traditions: Strengthening Conservation Education at NYU.â In addition to these outright grant funds, the NEH will match up to $150,000 raised from third-party donations for a total of $450,000 in combined federal and third-party funding.\n\nNEH funds will aid the Conservation Center in training the next generation of art conservators. Over the next three years, the âPreserving Living Traditionsâ project will strengthen the conservation education program at NYU by providing graduate students with fellowship stipends, summer work placements, and instruction from the foremost leaders in the field. Specialized coursework at the Conservation Center and summer placements will focus on transferring conservation skills and knowledge at risk of loss as we expand the curriculum with pressing new fields of study.\n\nRead MORE about the Linda Noclhin professorship and fellowship\n\nâOur rigorous course of study trains students in technical, scientific, ethical, and scholarly skills to grapple with evolving challenges in the conservation of cultural heritage,â observes Michele Marincola, Co-Chair and Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Professor of Conservation. âSupport from the NEH affirms the leadership of the Conservation Center in research and teaching of the conservation of historic and artistic works. This grant will help graduate students gain essential but endangered skills within art conservation and prepare them for positions in museums, government institutions, and private businesses across the nation.â\n\n\"It is an honor to be a recipient of this NEH grant. It will support the training of our students in conservation techniques that will aid in preserving our communities' living traditions,\" remarked Christine Poggi, Judy and Michael Steinhardt Director of the Institute of Fine Arts. \"We are extremely grateful for the NEH's commitment to the Conservation Center ensuring a legacy of conservation professionals dedicated to the care and guardianship of humanities collections.\"\n\nAbout the Conservation Center of the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University\n\nThe Institute of Fine Arts is an international leader in research and graduate teaching, and committed to global engagement and advancing the fields of art history, archaeology, and the theory and practice of conservation. New York City, with its incomparable resources and vitality, provides a backdrop and extended campus for the Instituteâs activities. Founded in 1960, the Conservation Center is the oldest degree-granting graduate program in art conservation in the United States, combining training in art conservation with historical, archaeological, curatorial, and scientific studies. The Conservation Center offers a four-year, full-time program that leads to both a Master of Science in the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, and a Master of Arts in Art History.\n\nAbout the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)\n\nCreated in 1965 as an independent federal agency, the National Endowment for the Humanities supports research and learning in history, literature, philosophy, and other areas of the humanities by funding selected, peer-reviewed proposals from around the nation. Additional information about the National Endowment for the Humanities and its grant programs is available at: www.neh.gov\n\nFor more information please contact: Michele Marincola, Co-Chair and Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Professor of Conservation at michele.marincola@nyu.edu or Myong Jin, Grants Administrator, at myong.jin@nyu.edu.\n\nThe Institute Announces Gift to Endow a Valeria Napoleone Linda Nochlin Professorship and Fellowship in Modern and Contemporary Art\n\nChristine Poggi, Judy and Michael Steinhardt Director of the Institute of Fine Arts, is pleased to announce the establishment of the Valeria Napoleone Linda Nochlin Professorship and Fellowship in Modern and Contemporary Art, made possible by the visionary generosity of Valeria Napoleone, Trustee of the Institute of Fine Arts, and her husband, Gregorio Napoleone, Trustee of New York University.\n\nThis transformative gift was given in honor of Linda Nochlin who was undoubtedly the most influential art historian of her generation. Her writings raised new critical questions and forged feminist approaches to the study of art that continue to illuminate our understanding of the history and achievements of women artists from the past to the present day. Nochlin received her PhD from the Institute of Fine Arts in 1963 with a dissertation on Gustave Courbet, and she went on to become a highly esteemed scholar of modern and contemporary art. She taught at Vassar College, Yale University, and eventually returned to the Institute of Fine Arts, where she held the Lila Acheson Wallace Chair of Modern Art. A bold and original thinker, she wrote important studies of the work of Courbet, Gericault, Renoir, and Seurat, as well as of many contemporary feminist and realist artists, including Joan Mitchell, Kiki Smith, Louise Bourgeois, and Sarah Lucas. One of her most famous essays, âWhy Have There Been No Great Women Artists?â published in 1971 in ARTnews, galvanized a sea change in the way art historians conceived the notion of genius, bringing critical attention to the social structures that led to the absence of women from the highest ranks of artistic accomplishment. Her work continued to astonish, provoke, and challenge all of us in the years that followed. All of the students who had the privilege of studying with Nochlin affirm that she had a profound effect on their lives. Although she retired in 2013 after many years committed to the training of future scholars, her work continues to resonate through that of her students. Therefore, it is fitting that along with this new professorship the Napoleones have also endowed a PhD fellowship for students studying Modern and Contemporary art under the direction of the Valeria Napoleone Linda Nochlin Professor.\n\nDirector Poggi is also pleased to announce that the first incumbent of this newly established faculty position will be Catherine Quan Damman. At the Institute, Quan Damman currently offers courses and advises graduate students on topics in feminist and queer theoretical approaches to global modern and contemporary art. Her first book, Performance: A Deceptive History, is under advance contract with Princeton University Press. Her research has been supported by the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS), the Terra Foundation for American Art, the Getty Research Institute, and the Center for Advanced Studies in the Visual Arts (CASVA) at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. Previously, she taught at Wesleyan University and Columbia University. An active critic, her writing can be found in Artforum, Bookforum, BOMB, 4Columns, Frieze, and other publications. Quan Damman will begin her tenure-track position as the Valeria Napoleone Linda Nochlin Professor; Assistant Professor in Modern and Contemporary Art at the Institute of Fine Arts on September 1, 2025.\n\nRead MORE about the Linda Noclhin professorship and fellowship\n\nâWe are honored to endow a professorship and fellowship in Linda Nochlinâs name celebrating her vast contributions to the field of art history. Lindaâs pathbreaking work remains relevant today as the history of modern art continues to be rewritten with a focus on the achievements of women artists and issues of gender, sexuality, and race,â said Valeria and Gregorio Napoleone.\n\nChristine Poggi commented, âIn creating this faculty position and fellowship, the Napoleones have ensured the Instituteâs ability to attract students of the highest caliber who will contribute the expansion and vitality of feminist art history in the U.S. and across the globe guided by Catherine Quan Damman.â\n\nFor more than eight decades, the Institute of Fine Arts at NYU has carefully selected and trained students to succeed as specialists in their fields. The influence of the faculty on their development as scholars is integral to the realization of their goals. We are delighted that the Napoleones have made this extraordinary commitment in recognition of Nochlinâs legacy and lifetime passion for the arts and the work of women artists by establishing a professorship and fellowship at the Institute.\n\nAbout Valeria Napoleone\n\nValeria Napoleone has been an art collector and patron since the mid-1990s, focusing her collection exclusively on female artists. For almost thirty years, she has actively supported projects and initiatives directed at increasing recognition and validation of art practices by women artists through collaborations and partnerships with individuals and institutions in the contemporary art world.\n\nThe Institute Appoints New Faculty\n\nThe Institute of Fine Arts, NYU is pleased to announce the appointment of Lisa Conte and Anthony Meyer to the faculty. Lisa Conte will join the faculty as Assistant Professor of Paper Conservation at the Conservation Center of the Institute of Fine Arts beginning on September 1, 2024. Anthony Meyer has accepted the position of Assistant Professor at the Institute of Fine Arts and will begin on September 1, 2025.\n\nLisa Conte is a paper conservator specializing in modern and contemporary art on paper, with an additional focus on the material culture of traumatic events. She is currently the Visiting Associate Professor of Paper Conservation at New York Universityâs Institute of Fine Arts. Previously, Lisa led conservation efforts at the 9/11 Memorial & Museum (2017-2022) and held roles at The Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Whitney Museum of American Art. She received her MA in Art History, along with an Advanced Certificate in Conservation from New York University. Her research, employing both materials- and social history-based approaches, spans a diverse range of subjects, including the technical study of late 19th-century lithographic prints, Ãmile GilliÃ©ronâs watercolors of ancient Greek sculptures, and printed ephemera from periods of war and social unrest. Lisa has also notably contributed to the field of conservation ethics, with publications focusing on the care and handling of artifacts bearing World Trade Center dust and the archaeological remains of the original site. Her current research includes studying the technical aspects of Hedda Sterneâs collage work. Lisa is a fellow of the International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works.\n\nRead MORE about the new faculty appointments\n\nAnthony Meyer holds a PhD in Art History from the University of California, Los Angeles, with a focus in the Indigenous Americas from the ancestral through the early modern. His research, broadly speaking, explores the crossroads between Nahua art, language, and religion in the Mexica Empire (1325â1521 CE) and the transatlantic world of colonial New Spain. For his research, he has received support from the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts, Dumbarton Oaks, the Fulbright Association, the Huntington Library, the John Carter Brown Library, the Renaissance Society of America, the Society for Architectural Historians, and the Social Science Research Council.\n\nProfessor Christine Poggi, Judy and Michael Steinhardt Director of the Institute of Fine Arts, noted, âWe are delighted to appoint Lisa and Anthony to the Instituteâs faculty. Their broad range of experience and extensive research will allow for valuable contributions to the Instituteâs scholarly community. Our students will greatly benefit from their guidance and mentorship.â\n\nThe Institute of Fine Arts mourns the passing of Pope.L, acclaimed artist, beloved art teacher, and former member of our Board of Trustees.\n\nHe died unexpectedly on December 23, 2023, at his home in Chicago at the age of 68.\n\nPope.Lâs artistic practice traversed disciplinary boundaries to embrace performance, photography, painting, sculpture, theatre, and writing. He is perhaps best known for his provocative âcrawlsâ through the streets of New York and Lewiston, Maine in a business suit or Superman costume, enacting the precarious state of those who have been marginalized owing to race and economic circumstances. A version of this performance series, ironically titled Conquest, took place in 2019, with 140 volunteers crawling through the Washington Square area blindfolded while holding a flashlight. This and other works were included in a trio of complementary exhibitions in 2019. The Whitney Museum of American Art presented Choir, the Museum of Modern Art staged Member, and the Public Art Fund organized Conquest. Other well-known works include Eating the Wall Street Journal of 1991, in which the artist slowly ate the pages of the Journal while sitting on a toilet and swallowing milk (an emblem of whiteness) and ketchup (emblem of blood), and the project Black Factory begun in 2003, for which he solicited objects that contributors believe represent blackness. The assembled objects constituted an archive that included personal mementos but also revealed racist stereotypes. Most of his works directly addressed issues of racism, prejudice, class, and injustice, with unflinching actions and texts that involved audience participation and startled us into thinking. According to Professor Darby English, one of Pope.Lâs colleagues at the University of Chicago, âhe thought a lot about âa lack worth having,â and then created unceasingly out of that thinking.â\n\nRead More about Pope.L\n\nThe Institute of Fine Arts to present Maia Ruth Lee: Once we leave a place is it there\n\nThe Institute of Fine Arts is pleased to present Once we leave a place is it there, a solo exhibition featuring new work by artist Maia Ruth Lee (b.1983, Busan, South Korea). The Spring 2024 iteration marks the return to in-person exhibitions since the start of the pandemic and proudly continues the Instituteâs Great Hall Exhibition seriesâ commitment to celebrating the practices of exemplary women artists. The exhibition is especially animated by the goal of highlighting the practices and scholarship of women of color both within and beyond the field of art history. Public programming will prioritize academic and artistic dialogues on the topics of migration, diaspora, and decolonization.\n\nRead More anbout Maia Ruth Lee Launch Exhibition Website\n\nThe Institute of Fine Arts to present Magali Lara: Interior Landscapes\n\nDuke House Exhibition Series Spring 2024\n\nMagali Lara: Interior Landscapes\n\nOpening: Friday, February 16, 6:00pm\n\nOn View: February 16 to May 16, 2024\n\nPublic Programming: Wednesday, April 10, 6:00pm, A Conversation with Magali Lara and Dr. Madeline Murphy Turner\n\nThe Institute of Fine Arts announces the opening of its spring exhibition, Magali Lara: Interior Landscapes, on view in The James B. Duke House from February 16 to May 16, 2024. Encompassing work from the 1970s to the 1990s, the exhibition presents four major paintings by Magali Lara, one of Mexico's most important living artists, highlighting her interior landscapes as acts of reclamation and healing. Her early domestic spaces grapple with memories of her childhood and the misogyny that surrounded her, while her later abstract works confront her personal experiences with grief and, simultaneously, consider the relationship between humans and the natural environment. Through her work, Lara contests the traditional expectations of women in Mexican society and proposes new avenues for expressing desire and recuperation. The exhibition is curated by Angelina Medina, Giovanni Falcone, Katie Svensson, and Vivian Wu.\n\nRead MORE about the Duke House Exhibition Series\n\nThe Institute of Fine Arts Appoints Esther da Costa Meyer as the Kirk Varnedoe Visiting Professor for Spring 2024\n\nThe Institute of Fine Arts is pleased to announce that Esther da Costa Meyer will join the Institute in the 2024 spring semester as the Kirk Varnedoe Visiting Professor. The Varnedoe professorship was established in 2006 to honor the memory of Kirkâs dedication and innovation as a teacher, mentor, and scholar. Kirk vigorously maintained these roles at the Institute of Fine Arts as a beloved member of the faculty, at the Museum of Modern Art as a legendary curator, and then as a senior scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study. The Kirk Varnedoe Visiting Professorship and lecture have been endowed through the generosity of Kirkâs many friends, colleagues, and students who were inspired by his work.\n\nRead MORE about the Praska Professor appointments\n\nâIt is an honor to invite Esther to the Institute to work with our students and provide new insight on critical issues in the field of modern and contemporary architectureâ said Christine Poggi, Judy and Michael Steinhardt Director, Institute of Fine Arts. âIt is with great pleasure that can welcome her into our classrooms in the name of one of the most notable scholars of the 20th century.â\n\nEsther da Costa Meyer, Professor emerita in the Department of Art and Archaeology, Princeton University, and Visiting Professor at the Yale School of Architecture, has worked on both modern and contemporary architecture, and on issues of gender and design. Another focus of her research has been the architectural practices of the old colonial powers and the resilient cultures of resistance in colonized nations. Her book Dividing Paris: Urban Renewal and Social Inequality, 1852-1870 (Princeton University Press) was published in February 2022. Her curatorial work includes Frank Gehry: On Line, at the Princeton University Art Museum (2008); at the Jewish Museum in New York, she curated Pierre Chareau: Modern Architecture and Design (2016) and co-curated The Sassoons (2023). During the past five years, her teaching has focused on architectureâs complicity with climate change, and, more recently, the architecture of refugee camps around the world.\n\nThe Institute of Fine Arts Announces Two Judith Praska Visiting Professors in Conservation for 2023-24\n\nPamela Hatchfield and Jen Munch join the Conservation Center\n\nThe Conservation Center of the Institute of Fine Arts welcomed Pamela Hatchfield as the 2023â2024 Judith Praska Visiting Distinguished Professor in Conservation & Technical Studies and Jen Munch, a modern and contemporary paintings conservator, as the Spring 2024 Judith Praska Visiting Assistant Professor of Conservation.\n\nNow in its eleventh year, the Judith Praska Distinguished Visiting Professorship has brought nineteen scholars to the Institute since 2012.

He was one of the worldâs foremost experts on Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, Frank Lloyd Wright, Robert Venturi, and Frank Gehry, among others. He was also especially known for his work on the American influence on Russian modern architecture. His catalogue, Building a new New World: Amerikanism in Russian Architecture, received the 2023 exhibition catalogue award of the Society of Architectural Historians. Just this summer, he opened an exhibition titled Paris Moderne 1914-1945 (with architect Pascal Mory and fashion curator Catherine Ãrmen and co-wrote the exhibition catalogue with Guillemette Morel Journel) at the Power Station of Art in Shanghai, and another on the Brazilian architect Paulo Mendes da Rocha at the Casa da arquitectura, in Matosinhos, Portugal (with Vanessa Grossman).

Kessel to the faculty beginning on September 1, 2023. Emmelyn Butterfield-Rosen will join the faculty as Assistant Professor of Nineteenth-Century European Art and Erich J. Kessel as Assistant Professor of African American and Black Diaspora Arts.\n\nRead MORE aboutMatthew Hayes' appointment\n\nEmmelyn Butterfield-Rosen specializes in late nineteenth-century art and cultural history, primarily in Europe. A guiding preoccupation of her teaching and research is the intersection between the history of art and the histories of biology and psychology, with special reference to the history of sexuality. Other areas of particular interest include animal studies; concepts of genre and categories and hierarchies of biological kinds; cognitive linguistics; theories and representations of gesture and corporeal expression; interactions between the visual and performing arts; the history of dance and early film; the history of art history; and the history of art criticism.\n\nButterfield-Rosenâs first book, Modern Art & the Remaking of Human Disposition, was published in November 2021 by the University of Chicago Press. This book, which brings a new formal and conceptual framework to the study of turn-of-the-century modernism, was a finalist for the 2022 Modernist Studies Association First Book Prize, and received Honorable Mention with Distinction for a Single-Author Work from the Dedalus Foundation. From Modern Art & the Remaking of Human Disposition, Butterfield-Rosen is developing a second project that addresses how Darwinâs evolutionary biology, and his twin theories of Natural Selection and Sexual Selection, reshaped the trajectories of three key aesthetic concepts: design, hierarchy, and aesthetic judgement. Alongside her academic writing, Butterfield-Rosen publishes longform essays in Artforum magazine on exhibitions treating nineteenth-century art and its legacies, as well as historical exhibitions more generally.\n\nButterfield-Rosen received her BA in Art History (summa cum laude) from Columbia University, and her doctorate from the Department of Art & Archaeology at Princeton University, where her dissertation won the Jane Faggen Dissertation Prize. For the past six years, she taught in the Williams Graduate Program in the History of Art at the Clark Art Institute. She has been Associate Director of the Graduate Program since 2019.

He was 84 years old.\n\nDavid OâConnor earned his BA in 1959 from the University of Sydney, where he studied Neolithic and Bronze Age Cyprus, a Diploma in Egyptology from University College London in 1962, and a PhD in 1969 from the University of Cambridge with a dissertation on the art and material culture of ancient Nubia (upstream from Egypt). His interest in Nubia, Egypt, and the Eastern Mediterranean allowed him to enlarge the traditional focus on Egypt to encompass Nubiaâs distinctive non-literate cultural artefacts, often employing anthropological methods. His work led to more dynamic and complex models of cultural exchange in this region.\n\nAt the University of Pennsylvania, where he taught in the Department of Oriental Studies and served as Curator-in-Charge of the Egyptian Collection at the Penn Museum, OâConnor conducted research on both Nubia and Egypt, organized the Excavations at Abydos in Southern Egypt, and served as an inspiring teacher and mentor. He joined the faculty of the Institute of Fine Arts in 1995, where he enjoyed the impetus, driven by his students, to think more deeply about works of art and architecture. He retired in 2017. A selective list of his many publications includes Ancient Nubia: Egyptâs Rival in Africa (1993), and the edited volumes: Ancient Egyptian Kingship (with David P. Silverman, 1995); Ancient Egypt in Africa (with Andrew Reid, 2003); and Mysterious Lands: Encounters with Ancient Egypt (with Stephen Quirke, 2003). He authored a monograph on the earliest Egyptian settlement in Nubia, The Old Kingdom Town at Buhen (2014), and co-edited substantial books on Thutmosis III, Amenhotep III, and Ramesses III (with Eric Cline). He also published Abydos: Egyptâs First Pharaohs and the Cult of Osiris (2009). He was interested in a broad range of topics and artefacts, from the material culture of Nubia and Egypt, to their artistic worksâincluding lesser studied royal palacesâto Egyptian concepts and practices of sexuality.\n\nDavid OâConnorâs passing is a great loss to the greater community of archaeologists and scholars of Nubian and Egyptian antiquity, and to his many colleagues, students, and friends. We send our deepest condolences to his wife, GÃ¼lbÃ¼n OâConnor, his daughters Aisha and Katie, and his numerous grandchildren.\n\nChristine Poggi\n\nJudy and Michael Steinhardt Director\n\nThe Institute of Fine Arts, New York University\n\nConservation Center Receives $1M Grant from Mellon Foundation in Support of Time-Based Media Art Conservation Education\n\nThe Conservation Center of the Institute of Fine Arts, NYU, has ben awarded a $1 million grant from the Mellon Foundation for the four-year project Actualization of Time-based Media Art Conservation Education and Training.

Sullivan\n\nJonathan Brown was a pioneering art historian who brought the study of both Spanish and Viceregal Mexican art to wide public and academic attention with his teaching, voluminous writing and exhibition curating, from the 1960s until the present decade. He died at home in Princeton, New Jersey on January 17, 2022. Jonathan Brown was the son of Jean (Levy) Brown and Leonard Brown, well known collectors of Dada, Surrealist, Fluxus, and especially Abstract Expressionist art. He was born in Springfield, Massachusetts on July 15, 1939. As an undergraduate at Dartmouth College, he became interested in Spanish language and literature. His love of Spanish art was fostered by classes at the Universidad Complutense in Madrid, where he attended New York University’s junior year in Spain program in 1958-59. Brown received his PhD in art history in 1964 from Princeton where he taught in the Department of Art and Archaeology from 1965 to 1973. Jonathan Brown and Sandra Backer were married in 1966. Their house in Princeton, New Jersey, has been the family home for many years. Jonathan was recruited by NYU to be Director (1973-78) of the Institute of Fine Arts, the university’s graduate center for the study of art history and fine arts conservation. He remained at the Institute until his retirement in 2017, serving as the Caroll and Milton Petrie Professor of Fine Arts. Brown instructed several generations of advanced students in his field, many of whom went on to have prestigious careers as academics, museum curators and directors. His fundamental books and exhibition catalogues on the greatest figures of Spain’s “Golden Age,” including El Greco, Diego VelÃ¡zquez, Francisco de ZurbarÃ¡n, Jusepe de Ribera and BartolomÃ© Esteban Murillo, among others, earned him praise at home and abroad. Brown’s 1991 survey The Golden Age of Painting in Spain (expanded in 1998 and published as Painting in Spain 1500-1700) remains the standard volume on the subject.\n\nRead MORE about Jonathan Brown\n\nRichard E.

Stone\n\nThe Conservation Center and the University of Akron School of Polymer Science and Engineering to Produce Improved Lining Adhesives for Canvas Paintings\n\nResearch supported by the Getty Foundation through its Conserving Canvas Initiative\n\nThe Conservation Center of the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University and the University of Akron School of Polymer Science and Engineering have joined forces for a major research project to identify improved lining adhesives for the conservation of canvas paintings, from Old Masters to Modern and Contemporary artists. The research partnership addresses a critical need to develop a satisfactory replacement for the original formulation of Beva 371, the industry standard for lining adhesion for paintings conservation that is no longer supported by available commercial ingredients. Conservators and scientists will work together to fine-tune and optimize adhesion performance and tailor the strength of the new lining adhesive products to minimize risks to the many types of paintings on canvas. This multi-institutional, cross-disciplinary project will be overseen by Professor Michele D. Marincola, Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Professor of Conservation and Chair of the Conservation Center during the grant period, and Christopher McGlinchey, Senior Research Scholar at the Conservation Center and the Project Director for this exciting initiative.\n\nRead MORE about this joint initiative\n\nThe research is supported by a grant from the Getty Foundation as part of its Conserving Canvas initiative, which focuses on expanding knowledge and skills for the structural care of paintings on canvas. The project was developed in response to recommendations from leading experts in the field following a convening in 2019 of the international paintings conservation community, the Conserving Canvas Symposium organized by the Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage at Yale University and also made possible with Getty support.\n\nâThe Getty Foundationâs generous grant brings together two industrious institutions at the cutting edge of museum work and applied macromolecular chemistry,â remarked Professor Marincola. McGlinchey notes, âThe Linings Adhesive project has all the promise of fulfilling a crucial need in the conservation field. We aim as well to take advantage of the emerging trend of bespoke polymer structure, something perfectly suited for the demanding but limited scale that conservation materials comprise for the chemical industry. The award affirms the Conservation Center at NYU continues to lead the field of identifying the qualities of those carefully tailored conservation materials.â\n\nThe two-year project involves an expansion of personnel to include two postgraduate fellows: a Getty Conserving Canvas Research Fellow based at the Institute of Fine Arts, NYU, and a Getty Conserving Canvas Science Fellow based at The University of Akron. The Fellows will work under the direction of Professor Marincola, McGlinchey, NYUâs Clinical Professor Dianne Modestini, Ali Dhinojwala, Interim Director of the School of Polymer Science and Polymer Engineering, The University of Akron, and Professor Abraham Joy, The University of Akron.\n\nProfessor Dhinojwala observed, âWe are excited to collaborate with the IFA Conservation Center at New York University on this innovative project. Our goals are to develop new adhesive formulations for adhering paintings on canvas. We already have several key ideas on how to formulate the next generation of adhesives and are looking forward to working with a talented cross-disciplinary group of experts. The sharing of expertise amongst our two institutions and colleagues will result in innovative research that will have a significant impact on the future approach to the conservation of canvas paintings.â\n\nThe project begins with an expertsâ kick-off meeting conducted virtually in late September 2021. As research progresses, the team will hold two additional expert meetings in 2022 and 2023 in New York and Florence, Italy that will document, share, and archive the work of the program with the goal of disseminating and providing access to technical scholarship of adhesion science. There will also be a workshop for practicing conservators in the summer of 2023. Additional project team members include senior conservators from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art, The National Gallery of Art, and the Cleveland Museum of Art and adhesion scientists from Virginia Tech, Paris Tech, and TU Delftâs Adhesion Institute. Conservation scientists from SUNY Buffalo State College, Caâ Foscari University of Venice, and the University of Amsterdam will also participate. The program is also fortunate to be working with industrial partner CTS Conservation.\n\n\"Conservation has always been a core area of our grantmaking,â said Antoine Wilmering, Senior Program Officer at the Getty Foundation who oversees the Conserving Canvas Initiative. âThis project is an exciting and essential step forward in identifying a viable alternative to BEVA 371. The paintings conservation community worldwide will be eagerly awaiting the results.â\n\nNational Endowment for the Humanities Awards the Institute $150K in Support of Research on the Abydos Brewery and the Emergence of Kingship in Ancient Egypt\n\nThe Division of Archaeological and Ethnographic Field Research of the National Endowment for the Humanities has awarded NYUâs Institute of Fine Arts $150,000 to support the project âExcavation of Egyptâs first industrial-scale brewery, located at the ancient site of Abydos.â These funds will specifically support two field seasons of excavations at Abydos that aim to address the question of the relationship between beer production on such an enormous, truly industrial scale and the early development of Egyptian kingship and the state.\n\nRead MORE about Marica Vilcek\n\nBritish archaeologists excavated the brewery at Abydos in the early 20th century, but its importance was not understood at that time and the exact location was lost. The North Abydos Archaeology team, consisting of individuals from the Institute of Fine Arts (IFA) at New York University and from Princeton University, working in cooperation with the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, located and began excavating the brewery in 2018 and continued the investigation in 2020. The press release on this discovery can be accessed online.\n\nThe fieldwork over the next two years will focus on the further exploration of the royal brewery and the analysis of the evidence for the ritual use of beer in the nearby royal funerary temples, or âcultic enclosures.â Excavation work at the brewery will aim to define fully the scale of the facility and its total production capacity, and to investigate the details of the beer production process. In addition, the team will strive to refine the dating of the facility, which at present can only be assigned to a broad period, approximately 3200â2800 BCE. Study of the beer making process will be based in part on the paleobotanical analysis of preserved organic residues. Analysis of the ritual use of beer in royal contexts will involve the excavation of a series of large deposits of discarded ceramic beer jars found at the monumental cultic enclosures that Egyptâs early kings built not far from the brewery. Here too, paleobotanical analysis will be used to examine organic residues in the beer jars, to allow for comparison between the beer used in the royal monuments with what was produced in the nearby brewery. The investigation of the Abydos royal brewery provides important new evidence on how the control of staple resources, the ability to mobilize labor, and the administrative capability necessary to manage such a large-scale operation helped define the nature of early Egyptian kingship and the state.\n\nThe site of Abydos stretches over several square miles of the margins of the desert on the west bank of the Nile in southern Egypt and has an equally expansive history. It was the burial place of Egyptâs first kings and later became the primary cult place of the god Osiris, ruler of the land of the dead. For millennia the site was held to be one of Egyptâs most sacred and was a place of pilgrimage, where visitors could witness the great festival procession of Osiris, in which episodes of his myth were re-enacted in the sacred landscape. Later kings built their own temples at Abydos to associate themselves both with Osiris and with their royal ancestors buried at the site. Visitors to the site today can still walk through the magnificently decorated monuments of Seti I and his son Ramesses II.\n\nâIt is truly an honor to be one of the first projects awarded support under the NEHâs new Archaeological and Ethnographic Field Research grant programâ observes Matthew Adams, co-director for IFA of the Abydos project. âThis recognition from the NEH will be instrumental in maintaining the momentum of our work at Egyptâs first industrial-scale brewery.â\n\nChristine Poggi, Judy and Michael Steinhardt Director of the Institute of Fine Arts, remarked, âWe are delighted that the NEH has made this commitment to sustaining empirical field research at Abydos. We are sincerely grateful for this critical support that will aid in the further exploration and documentation of the discoveries being made at Abydosâs royal brewery.â\n\nThe Institute to Honor Marica Vilcek\n\nGreat Hall of the Historic Duke House to Be Renamed for Board Chair\n\nThe Institute of Fine Arts is renaming the Great Hall of the James B.

Berkley, Chairman of the Board of Trustees at NYU, said, âI'm thrilled to recognize Maricaâs incredible contributions to the Institute with the naming of the Marica Vilcek Great Hall at the Institute of Fine Arts. Maricaâs generosity, passion, and leadership have allowed the Institute to grow and thrive and we are honored to have her as such an important member of the Institute and the NYU community.â\n\nâAs a Board Member and Chair,â said Andrew Hamilton, President of New York University, âMarica has steadfastly supported the Instituteâs mission: excellence in scholarship, and development of the next generation of leadership in art history and curation, archaeology, and conservatorship. I cannot think of a more apt distinction than to name the Great Hall, the heart of the IFAâs long-time home, after Marica, who has so devotedly sustained the heart of IFAâs work.â\n\nChristine Poggi, the Judy and Michael Steinhardt Director of the Institute of Fine Arts, said, âIt is particularly fitting to have Marica Vilcekâs name grace our Great Hall because itâs emblematic of her role at the heart of the Institute. It is in this iconic space that we host so many of the Instituteâs events, gatherings, and exhibitions. Future events and celebrations in this hall will take on a new meaning as we recognize such a devoted patron of the arts and of the Institute.â\n\nMs. Vilcek was born in Bratislava, Slovakia (then Czechoslovakia), and earned advanced degrees in art history from Comenius University in Bratislava and Charles University in Prague. Upon graduation, she began her professional career in a curatorial position at the Department of Prints and Drawings of the Slovak National Gallery in Bratislava.\n\nIn 1965, Ms. Vilcek, with her husband Dr. Jan T. Vilcek, immigrated to the United States. Shortly after arriving in New York, Ms. Vilcek accepted a position at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, beginning a 32-year tenure at the institution. As the Metropolitan Museumâs associate curator in charge of the Accessions and Catalogue Department, Ms. Vilcek dedicated the majority of her time with the museum to collections management and was responsible for processing and cataloguing the museumâs new acquisitions. Ms. Vilcek authored the museumâs procedural manuals on accessioning and cataloguing, and advised scores of curators, administrators, students, and interns on collections management.\n\nMs. Vilcek has served as a consultant to nonprofit organizations including the Commission for Art Recovery of the World Jewish Congress, the Jewish Museum in New York City, and the Jordan National Gallery in Amman. She is Chair of the NYU Institute of Fine Arts Board of Trustees, and a board member of the New York Youth Symphony and the Foundation for a Civil Society. Ms. Vilcek also serves as an honorary trustee of The Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nIn 2005, Ms. Vilcek joined her husband, a biomedical scientist, in giving the New York University School of Medicine one of the largest gifts in its history. In recognition of their generosity, the school has named several programs, chairs, and facilities in their honor. In 2005, the Crohnâs and Colitis Foundation of America recognized Dr. and Ms. Vilcek as Humanitarians of the Year, and in 2011 they received the Outstanding New Yorker award given by the Center for an Urban Future in New York City. In 2012, Ms. Vilcek accepted, on behalf of the Vilcek Foundation, the Steven K. Fischel Distinguished Public Service Award from the American Immigration Council in Washington, DC.\n\nMs. Vilcek cofounded the Vilcek Foundation with her husband in 2000. The foundationâs primary mission is to recognize and celebrate the contributions of immigrants in the United States. The foundationâs dual focus on biomedical research and the arts derives from the coupleâs respective interests and careers. Since the foundationâs inception, Ms. Vilcek has played an integral role in the conceptualization and administration of its programs and exhibitions. She has also used her experience as an art historian and curator in the development of the Jan T. and Marica Vilcek Collection, a promised gift to the Vilcek Foundation, which includes an unparalleled group of American Modernist works, as well as significant examples of pre-Columbian art and Native American pottery.\n\nHank Willis Thomas will be the Inaugural Speaker of the Sam Wagstaff Photography Lecture Series\n\nHank Willis Thomas (Photo Credit: Andrea Blanch).\n\nThe Institute of Fine Arts is pleased to announce that Hank Willis Thomas will give the inaugural Sam Wagstaff Photography Lecture on Thursday, April 22, 2021, at 6:00 p.m. in conversation with New York-based artist Chris Berntsen.\n\nThis new lecture series honors the legacy of Samuel J. Wagstaff Jr. (November 4, 1921 âJanuary 14, 1987). Wagstaff attended the Institute of Fine Arts in the 1950s, studying Italian Renaissance Art under Richard Offner, and went on to become a notable American art curator, collector, and patron of the arts. Through his influential collecting, teaching, and curatorial work, Wagstaff promoted photography as a fine art medium. His groundbreaking collection was purchased by the J. Paul Getty Museum in 1984, constituting the cornerstone of its newly formed Department of Photographs. Sam Wagstaffâs devotion to the medium contributed to its rising status over the years. The Institue of Fine Arts is delighted to celebrate his achievements by naming our annual photography lecture in his honor.\n\nRead MORE about the Sam Wagstaff Photography Lecture\n\nâThe Sam Wagstaff Photography Lecture creates an important opportunity for the Institute community to discuss critical issues in the field of photography through the perspective of contemporary artists and historiansâ said Christine Poggi, Judy and Michael Steinhardt Director, Institute of Fine Arts. âIt is with great pleasure that we present this new series in the name of one of the great scholars of the 20th centuryâ\n\nHank Willis Thomas is a conceptual artist working primarily with themes related to perspective, identity, commodity, media, and popular culture.â His work is included in numerous public collections including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art, among others. Thomas is a recipient of the Gordon Parks Foundation Fellowship (2018), a Guggenheim Fellowship (2018), the AIMIA | AGO Photography Prize (2017), and the Soros Equality Fellowship (2017). Heisa former member of the New York City Public Design Commission.\n\nChris Berntsen is a New York based artist who uses photography to explore themes related to queerness, identity, and intimacy.

Courtesy the Artist and Corbett vs. Dempsey, Chicago.\n\nThe Institute of Fine Arts is pleased to announce its spring exhibition, Cauleen Smith, H-E-L-L-O:\n\nTo Do All At Once, presenting the 2014 film H-E-L-L-O by filmmaker and multimedia artist Cauleen Smith. The exhibition proudly continues the Great Hall Exhibition series’ commitment to celebrating the contributions of exemplary women artists and is the first in the series to take place online. Spanning and intertwining film, installation, and material objects, Smith’s practice expands on the experimental film and third world cinema traditions in order to explore the spaces of historical memory, collectivity, and compensatory possibility. In this way, Smith’s work emerges as a talismanic touchstone for contemporary activism and community building. In the artist’s words: “Future and past, you want to hold all of that. You want to celebrate, you want to protest, you want to do all at once.\n\nRead moreAbout Cauleen Smith's exhibition at the Institute\n\nWorldâs Oldest Industrial-Scale Brewery Identified at Abydos, Egypt, ca. 3000 BCE\n\nGeneral view of the south exterior of the enclosure of King Khasekhemwy (ca. 2750 BCE). A massive deposit of beer jars was found extending over nearly the entire excavated area. (Photo by Greg Maka for the North Abydos Project.)\n\nA team of American and Egyptian archaeologists excavating at the site of Abydos in southern Egypt has uncovered evidence for the worldâs oldest known industrial-scale beer production facility, an ancient complex with the capacity to produce enough beer to serve thousands of people in a single batch.\n\nThe archaeological team from the Institute of Fine Arts (IFA) at New York University and from Princeton University dated the brewery to the dawn of ancient Egyptian history, ca. 3000 BCE, the approximate time of the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt and the emergence of the pharaonic state, the era of King Narmer.\n\nRead more about the discovery at Abydos [opens in new window]\n\nNational Endowment for the Humanities Awards The Institute's Conservation Center $150K in Support of New Teaching Modalities in Conservation Education\n\nThe Division of Preservation and Access of the National Endowment for the Humanities has awarded NYUâs Institute of Fine Arts Conservation Center $150,000 to support the project âManaging Change: Developing New Teaching and Learning Modalities in Conservation Education.â In addition to these outright grant funds, the NEH will match up to $100,000 raised from third-party donations for a total of $350,000 in combined federal and third-party funding. These funds will enhance remote and in-person teaching of graduate-level art and artifact conservation through guest lectures, student fellowships, and summer work placements in US cultural institutions.\n\nIn response to the necessary transformation of teaching by the COVID-19 pandemic, the project will focus on developing new modalities for art conservation that will blend traditional instruction with remote learning technologies. The project will take place over three years and produce faculty/student-tested videos, images, and assessments of e-learning. The aim is to provide conservation students enrolled in the program and larger humanities communities with novel resources for teaching and learning.\n\nThe Institute Mourns the Loss of A Distinguished Alumna\n\nThe Institute of Fine Arts would like to recognize the passing of Frederick G. Schab who was a close friend and alum of the Institute. On May 14, Frederick died in Woodstock, NY at the age of 95. He was born in 1924 in Lucerne, where his father, William Schab, had founded a branch of his Viennese firm, Gilhofer und Ranschburg.Â The firm dealt in rare books, illuminated manuscripts and drawings. The family moved back to Vienna in 1926. In 1938, following annexation of Austria to Nazi Germany, the family fled to Switzerland. In 1939 they moved to New York where his father founded the William H. Schab Gallery.Â\n\nFrederick received his Bachelor of Arts degree at Columbia University and received his Master of Arts at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. He studied under the famous art historians, Richard Krautheimer, Walter Friedlander and Carl Lehmann. In the early 1950’s he joined his father’s gallery that dealt with European Master Prints and drawings as well as early printed books. Frederick and his father added to the collections of prints, drawings, and rare books at the National Gallery, the Cleveland Museum, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, The National Museum of Canada, the Getty Museum and many other museums and libraries around the world. Frederick was instrumental in the assembling the private collections of Lessing Rosenwald and Ian Woodner who then later donated their collections to the National Gallery in Washington. He also built the collection of the Arthur Ross Foundation now at the Yale University Art Museum.\n\nA Prominent Conservator Brings New Areas for Research and Teaching to the Conservation Center\n\nThe Institute of Fine Arts Conservation Center is pleased to welcome Lynda Zycherman as the 2021 Judith Praska Distinguished Visiting Professor in Conservation and Technical Studies.

Solow In Memoriam\n\nThe Institute of Fine Arts mourns the loss of Sheldon Henry Solow, who passed away on November 17, 2020 at the age of 92. Born in Brooklyn in 1928, Solow attended NYU, studying engineering and architecture, but left in 1949 to begin a career in real estate development. He eventually became one of New York Cityâs most influential builders, often choosing innovative architects to design elegant and distinctive towers. Among his most iconic skyscrapers is the Solow Building at 9 West 57th Street, designed in 1974 by Gordon Bunshaft. Solow also assembled a remarkable collection of Renaissance and Modern art, as well as Egyptian antiquities and African art. His collection comprises important paintings and sculptures by Sandro Botticelli, Henri Matisse, Joan MirÃ³, Franz Kline, Vincent Van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, Roy Lichtenstein, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Cy Twombly, among others.\n\nSheldon Solow was a generous, even visionary, benefactor to the Institute, whose many gifts ranged from student fellowships, to faculty positions, to the renovation of the faÃ§ade of the James B. Duke House, to two floors of the building at #3 East 78th Street for the construction of the Sheldon H. Solow Library and Study Center. Sheldon and his wife Mia Fonssagrives Solow, a sculptor and jewelry designer, joined the Instituteâs Council of Friends in 1973 (todayâs Connoisseurs Circle). Solow became a trustee of the Institute in 1985, and served as Chair of the Board of Trustees from 1992 to 2003. He established two professorships: the Sheldon H. Solow Professor in the History of Architecture (currently held by Jean-Louis Cohen), and the Rosalie Solow Professor of Modern Art in honor of his sister (currently held by Thomas Crow). During the financial crisis of 2009-2011, his generosity provided financial support to over 200 Institute students. As recently as last August, he made a gift to the Directorâs Discretionary Fund to assist students affected by the pandemic.

We have witnessed yet another brutal murder of an African American, George Floyd, following the recent killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and many others. This has caused enormous pain, suffering, and rage within the Black community, which is shared by all those who support justice, equality, freedom, and peace for everyone. At this time when the outbreak of the coronavirus has disproportionately affected people of color and other vulnerable groups, demonstrating the disastrous effects of systemic racism, we should be working together to create an egalitarian and just society. We stand in solidarity with all those who fight against racism and police brutality.\n\nRead the full statement\n\nTom Sokolowski (1950-2020)\n\nPhoto Courtesy Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers.\n\nThomas W.
