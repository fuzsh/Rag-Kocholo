        "text": "John Aldrich is a positive scientist—in both the scholastic and colloquial sense. A progeny of the Rochester school, Aldrich's research displays a commitment to the tenets of positive political theory. He derives internally consistent propositions and subjects those claims to empirical testing, all in an attempt to explain scientifically phenomena and institutions at the heart of democratic theory. As a mentor and builder of academic institutions, Aldrich has shown unswerving kindness, modesty, and a commitment to foster new generations of political scientists. He is a positive influence on his students, his colleagues, and the political science discipline at large.\n\nAldrich's scholarly contributions are remarkable both for the scope of the problems he has confronted and the ambitious nature of solutions he has proposed. These attributes are exemplified in his most well-known contribution to the field, Why Parties? (Reference Aldrich1995, Reference Aldrich2011), which builds—from the basic dilemmas of collective action, social choice, and progressive ambition—a logical framework for explaining the origins, evolution, and pervasive role of political parties in democratic competition. Why Parties? quickly and justly achieved seminal status. Yet this work is only one highlight of Aldrich's many significant contributions to an array of research areas, including political behavior, presidential elections, spatial modeling, legislative studies, survey methods, and quantitative analysis.\n\nAldrich is the Pfizer-Pratt University Professor of Political Science at Duke University. His academic career began at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, where he studied with John Kessel, a noted American politics scholar. Largely on Kessel's advice, Aldrich began his PhD studies at the University of Rochester in 1969. At Rochester, Aldrich entered into a vibrant intellectual community led by William Riker that would have a lasting influence on his career and his approach to social science research. While studying with the likes of Riker, Richard Fenno, and Richard Niemi, Aldrich joined a cohort of Rochester students that included Peter Aranson, Morris Fiorina, Richard McKelvey, Lynda Powell, David Rohde, and Kenneth Shepsle, each of whom would prove to have stellar careers of their own. As noted by Amadae and Bueno de Mesquita (Reference Amadae and Bueno de Mesquita1999, 280), “[t]his first generation of Rochester Ph.D. students, coming from a then unknown program, would be crucial in transforming the study of politics in the decades ahead.”\n\nAldrich's doctoral studies were interrupted, however, by his service in the Vietnam War (July 1970–January 1972). An infantryman with the 101st Airborne Division, Aldrich served as an assistant machine gun ammunition bearer, a position about which Aldrich has quipped, “I am sure that had I stayed longer, I would have been promoted to machine gun ammunition bearer.” On completion of his military service, Aldrich returned to Rochester and continued his studies under the direction of McKelvey, who had joined the faculty in the interim. Aldrich completed his PhD in 1975.\n\nWhile graduate training imbues all scholarly careers to some degree, the influence of the Rochester school on Aldrich's research has been significant and enduring. First and foremost, it oriented him toward a positive approach to social science research. In this view, empirical regularities, even causally identified regularities, are mere statistical curiosities when detached from theory. Formal theories, even if rigorous and internally consistent, are mere exercises in logic if they do not add to our understanding of observable phenomenon. The epistemological approach Aldrich learned at Rochester emphasized how the interaction of theory and empirical analysis leads to an accumulation of knowledge.\n\nSecond, Aldrich received extensive grounding in the “new institutional” rational choice perspective associated with the Rochester school. This approach emphasized the individual as the appropriate unit of analysis. However, the true focus of Aldrich's most important research is not on individuals per se, but on the government and political institutions that arise as a consequence of interactions between individuals and on how those institutions, in turn, structure and shape individuals' behaviors.\n\nFinally, Aldrich's career has been marked by commitments to interdisciplinary research and the guidance and mentoring of young scholars—both hallmarks of Riker's Rochester department. Just as early rational choice scholars borrowed heavily from influential works in economics, Aldrich's research often blurs the lines between political science, economics, history, psychology, and statistics. Moreover, throughout his career he has worked to mentor young scholars and build institutions to foster the intellectual development of the next generations of political science researchers. His students now work at top research institutions around the globe, and it is notable—if unsurprising—that in 2004 the first Duke University Graduate School Dean's Award for Excellence in Mentoring went to John Aldrich.\n\nIn 1974, Aldrich joined the faculty at Michigan State University and taught there until 1981. This was a period of significant scholarly output, including two books (Aldrich Reference Aldrich1980a; Abramson, Aldrich, and Rohde Reference Abramson, Aldrich and Rohde1980) and nine peer-reviewed articles, five of which appeared in the American Political Science Review (APSR) or the American Journal of Political Science (AJPS). This work was, in many ways, a continuance of his research interests at Rochester, emphasizing the advancement of political methodology and the nexus of rational choice models and political behavior. Aldrich's first book, Before the Convention: Strategies and Choices in Presidential Nomination Campaigns (Reference Aldrich1980a), built on early rational choice models and offered the first systematic study of the presidential primary process. It was also during this time that Aldrich began his long-lasting research partnership with colleagues Paul Abramson and David Rohde, which led to the publication of the first volume of the Change and Continuity series on American elections.\n\nAldrich spent the next six years at the University of Minnesota (1981–1987), where he continued his record as a regular contributor to leading journals in the areas of quantitative analysis, rational choice theories of political behavior, and spatial models of elections. However, during this time his interest in political behavior broadened beyond the theoretical boundaries of rational choice. Aldrich's interest in candidates' issue positions caused him to consider voters' ability (or inability) to utilize issues when constructing candidate appraisals. Thus, working with Eugene Borgida, Wendy Rahn, and John Sullivan, Aldrich heavily drew on social psychology, a literature that he has subsequently revisited.\n\nIn 1987, Aldrich moved to Duke University, where he would eventually serve as a chair of the department of political science (1992–1996; acting chair, 1990–1991, 1999–2000), and as the founding director and then co-director of both the Social Science Research Institute (2003–2009) and the Program for Advanced Research in the Social Sciences (2004–present). At Duke, he produced many of his most significant contributions to the study of political behavior, parties, spatial modeling, legislative studies, and more. Aldrich also continued his habit of building research partnerships with students and colleagues. This broadened the scope of his research in directions ranging from comparative politics to political communications. Given both the depth and breadth of Aldrich's contributions to so many areas of scholarly research, our survey below is necessarily incomplete, and we focus on only a subset of his published works.\n\nA Life in Political Science\n\nIn May 2013, Aldrich was awarded the University of Rochester's Distinguished Scholar Award, given in recognition of alumni whose careers in academia, industry, government, or the arts have exemplified the values of the university. Aldrich, undoubtedly, has done great honor to that university and to the political science graduate program envisioned a half a century ago by William Riker.\n\nAldrich's contributions to the political science discipline have been duly recognized. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2001) and received the John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship in 2012. In addition to the Eldersveld Award cited earlier, Aldrich also received the 2012 Frank Johnson Goodnow Award from the American Political Science Association for his career of service to the discipline. His scholarly work has earned APSA's Gladys Kammerer Award, the Heinz Eulau Award, the CQ Press Award, and the Pi Sigma Alpha Award. He has been co-editor of the American Journal of Political Science (1985–88), and he has served as vice president (1995–6) and president of the Southern Political Science Association (1998–99) as well as president of the Midwest Political Science Association (2004–2005). He has served as the secretary of APSA (1993–94) and chair of the APSA Task Force on Interdisciplinarity (2006–07). He has also been a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Social and Behavioral Sciences (1989–90) and at the Rockefeller Center in Bellagio, Italy (2002).\n\nThese recognitions reflect a career that has left a significant imprint on the discipline, contributing to some of the most important intellectual trends of the past four decades. His work has advanced formal modeling, data collection and analysis, and the marriage of the two. His research helped revive political parties—and political institutions more generally—as a focus of scientific inquiry. He has contributed to our understanding of the dynamic interactions between political elites and voters, and helped revive the thinking—if not always rational—of the voter as central player in American democracy. Even more, he has built bridges across disciplines, helped develop and maintain important intellectual institutions, and served as a mentor and a role model to young scholars from around the world. In 2013–2014, Aldrich will serve the discipline as president of the American Political Science Association. In this role, we expect that he will continue to have a positive influence on our discipline.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank Brendan Nyhan and David Rohde for providing commentary on an earlier draft of this paper.
