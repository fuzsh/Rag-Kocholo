We owe our children, the most vulnerable citizens in our society, a life free of violence and fear.” Nelson Mandela\n\nAs we enter the 2022/2023 season we wanted to provide some reminders regarding SafeSport training. The SafeSport training requirement became an annual training requirement beginning in 2018/2019 season. With that being the case many of our Adult coaches will have to retake the SafeSport Core course as that is required every four years. What is SafeSport ? It is the Olympic community's initiative to recognize, reduce and respond to misconduct in sport. The six primary types of misconduct are Bullying, Harassment, Hazing, Emotional misconduct, Physical Misconduct, and Sexual Misconduct (including child sex abuse). SafeSport Core is the first required course in the ongoing training curriculum. There will be refresher courses to follow each additional year. In the new SportsEngine Member Management System the course is easily accessible by clicking on the link on the eligibility requirements you receive when an applicable membership with the requirement is purchased. It can also be accessed by logging into your SportsEngine account at sportsengine.com and selecting Household on the left side menu, then your profile and view details on your membership.\n\nWho is required to take the Core Center for SafeSport Training?\n\nAny member who falls into the category of the required training (Club Director, Coach, Tourney Directors, Referee's, Organization Admins, team managers or chaperones, and other adult role that interacts with junior members).\n\nAny junior member turning 18 during the season. A 2021 Gateway Junior Players 18's membership should be purchased and that will have the SafeSport eligibility requirement. It will have also have the parental consent for taking the course if they are not yet 18 taking. Completing at beginning of season eliminates the having to be in a rush and tracking when they turn 18 and risk becoming ineligible during the season.\n\nWho is required to take the Refresher Courses :\n\nAny member who has taken the Core Center for SafeSport training and that has expired. Each year there will be a Refresher so if previous year completed Refresher 1 the next year would be Refresher 2 and so on. The core course will need to be retaken every four years.\n\nSafeSport Mandate:\n\nIn the last few years, there have been deeply troubling scandals surrounding inappropriate misconduct and youth athletes. The SafeSport mandate was initiated by the US Olympic Committee - and has been incrementally implemented over the last 3 years across all Olympic club sports (IE, USA Swimming, USA Hockey, etc.)\n\nTherefore, SafeSport has become a mandatory Certification for any and all adults involved with any USAV junior volleyball programming - this includes but is not limited to: Club Directors, Board Officers, Club Employees, Team Representatives, all Coaches, Chaperones, Managers, and volunteer adult/parent referees/scorekeepers. Beyond club personnel, all referees, scorekeepers, tournament directors, and site directors must also be SafeSport Certified. Certification will be renewed every year, after completion of an initial \"Core SafeSport\" course.\n\nA coach lacking a safesport certification will be unable to appear on a roster. Coaches who appear on the bench coaching without safesport certification may be subject to sanctioning, as is the team, club, and club director associated with that coach.\n\nIncreasing Contacts Per Hour -- Join USAV’s John Kessel in this free webinar on getting what motor learning scientists call “increasing opportunities to respond.” After getting the best feedback possible, the other biggest key to improving or changing skill is in getting actual gamelike touches on the volleyball – DOING and not watching. Listen in at your convenience 24/7 and start getting more learning going on in the same amount of time in your gym!\n\nRecipe for Club Growth - Joining USAV’s John Kessel are Jimmy Peden, Palmetto RVA commissioner and /director of Club South, Michael Fletcher, Club A5 and Eric Hodgson of Club Zia and a staff member of the Arizona RVA of USAV. Over 100 years of club volleyball growing experiences are shared in a best practices way.\n\nMeaningful Competition & the Competitive Cauldron - Join Jason Trepanier from Canada’s Ontario Volleyball Association, and John Kessel of USA Volleyball, in this free USAV webinar covering ideas in creating meaningful competition for all ages in both beach and indoor play. Also ideas and tips in developing a competitive cauldron for your team.\n\nTalent and the Secret Life of Teams -- Listen in on Terry Pettit’s insights into his volleyball book, by the same title of this webinar. Terry had to call in by cell phone and is a bit distant on the mic but he shares some great thoughts on a wide range of volleyball topics. Skip forward 4 minutes into the webinar, unless you want to hear me solving the tech problems of getting Terry to connect in. You can read much more about Terry and order his book at http://terrypettit.com/\n\nMotor Learning Theory - Dr. Carl McGown, founder of the Gold Medal Squared program, joins John Kessel of USA Volleyball to present this incredibly important free webinar. Carl has been part of every USA men’s Olympic team since 1984, and thus part of THREE gold and one bronze medals. His full bio can be seen by CLICKING HERE and more information on the Gold Medal Squared program can be found by CLICKING HERE.\n\nOn the Edge of Human Achievement – A fascinating webinar by US Olympic Committee High Performance Director Peter Vint. This special presentation on topics like the Checklist Manifesto, things learned from the Vancouver 2010 Games, deliberate practice, random vs. blocked training and so much more is a must listen to for coaches at all levels."
