        "text": "All the info above is for the Olympics, yet there is also the Paralympics which USA Volleyball serves as the NGB for. We see it as another discipline for those wanting to play this sport for a lifetime. Indeed, the NF for Nederland, NEVOBO, has over 3,000 members in their sitting volleyball area, but only 500 are disabled. The others just want to play the game sitting… I serve on the World ParaVolley Board of Directors and as their Development Director, growing the disabled versions of the game. We have a WPV SportKit DVD as a resource to help programs start all over the world. Our women are ranked #2 in the world and have won Bronze, Silver and Silver at the past three Paralympics. The men took 8th in 2004 and have not qualified since. These are the gaps we seek to replace with qualification. I will be serving as head of the Jury for the 2015 ParaPanAms in Toronto, which serve as the qualifier for the USA men – with Canada as our main opponent to defeat, as Brazil is already in due to being the host nation.\n\nI think this is one of the things people simply don’t understand…that by supporting/being a member of USA Volleyball, they are not only being part of one of the finest National Federations in the world, they are helping us grow the game for little kids (did you know 8 and under membership in USA Volleyball, insurance included, is FREE?), for the disabled, and for the diversity of our sport. For example we work and help fund Starlings USA for the economically disadvantaged, and on boys and men’s volleyball programming (for there is a 10:1 ratio of females to males in our sport scholastically and in USAV itself). Annually we give over 100K in grants to boys, diversity, starting college men’s programs, and other underserved areas. The attached flyer we give out often and has a lot of information about what USAV is about…and the way we seek to direct the sport.\n\nSo on to the top 5…USA Volleyball has a Board of Directors, which just met last month for a few days to determine those actually. For the past 8 years we have been following these three…1. Sustained Competitive Excellence 2. Growing the Game 3. Commercialize the Sport. So while still in draft form for the subtopics, we now have four that are once finalized, to be our new focus 1. SUSTAINED COMPETITIVE International, Olympic & Paralympic SUCCESS. 2. Participation, Program & Membership GROWTH. 3. RESOURCE Optimization. 4. Marketing & BRAND AFFINITY.\n\nThese top 4 as set by our board and thus the top four priorities for all USAV staff, means that I get to add one to round out your top five question – and that is to use and understand the science of motor skill learning. Given the limited amount of time for training for most programs, it is time to stop teaching the way we were taught and teach more efficiently. The game teaches the game (as beach players without any coaches knew for over half a century of playing, sans “coaches”), and we need to develop volleyball players, not athletes. Coaches are great mentors, but too many coaches practice for practice, and not performance, doing drills to look good on the weekdays, and not empowering players to perform in the competitions. IMPACT has been teaching this since I wrote the first edition in 1988. It is now in its 28th edition, always adding new research and other findings to update what is being taught. Coaches ask their players to change for the better every day – what is it in learning to be better that coaches are doing the same as they ask for of their players? The “secrets” first start in being a better teacher of motor skill (aka volleyball in our case), and knowing how to best help the players be better learners."
