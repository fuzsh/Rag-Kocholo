        "text": "1. Production technology of Tuberose Tuberose is a flower symbolicof wild pleasures or primordial passion.\n\n2. INTRODUCTION The common name derivesfromthe Latin tuberosa through French tubéreuse,meaning swollenor tuberousin reference to its root system. ScientificName : Polianthes tuberosa L. Family : Amaryllidaceae Common Name : Tuberose Chromosome number : 2n=30 Native. : Mexico Hindi Name : Rajanigandha Tuberose or Rajanigandha is a herbaceous, perennial, ornamental\n\n3. Morphology 1. Tuberose is a half-hardy, bulbous perennial plant and it propagates by bulb (25-30gm weight and 2-3cm diameter) and bulblets (1-1.5cm diameter). 2. Bulbs are made up of small scales and leaf bases 3. the stem is a condensed structure which remains concealed within scales. 4. Adventitious and shallows root mainly found in tuberose. 5. The leaves are long, narrow, linear,grass-like, light green, and arise in rosette. 6. Tuberose flowers basically funnel shaped and perianth part highly fragrant and waxy white flowers, about (20-25) mm long, single or double and borne in a spike. 7. Number of stamens are six, anthers dorsifixed in the middle, ovary 3 locular, ovules numerous and fruits type are capsule.\n\n4. Tuberose bulbs\n\n5. USES In India and Bangladesh they are widely used in making flower garlands which are offered to the gods or used as wedding ornaments. While once associated with funerals, it is now used in floral arrangements for other occasions. In Indonesia, tuberose flowers are also used in cooking. In Hawaii, they are one of the main flowers used in the construction of leis. Some others are plumerias, ginger, orchids, and pikake (jasmine).\n\n6. Tuberose Absolute Tuberose Absolute is an exquisite, highly fragrant floral oil that is most often used for perfumery and natural fragrancing work. TuberoseAbsoluteBenefitsandUses 1. Tuberose Absolute is used primarily in perfumery and natural fragrancing. 2. Muscular Spasm 3. Stress-induced Conditions 4. Physical Tension 5. Insomnia 6. Nervousness 7. Restlessness 8. Irritability 9. Anxiety 10. Depression\n\n7. Climate 1. The commercial cultivation of tuberose is mainly confined in warm humid areas with average temperature range from 20o to 35oC. 2. For its luxuriant growth, it requires high humidity and a temperature around 30oC. 3. Temperature above 400C reduces the spike length and quality of the flowers. 4. Very low temperature and frost also damage the plants and flowers. 5. Tuberose grows well in sunny situation. Soil 1. The tuberose grows in a wide range of soils. Loam and sandy loam soils having a pH range from 6.5 to 7.5 with good aeration and drainage are considered suitable for its cultivation. 2. The soil should be rich in organic matter and retain sufficient moisture for proper growth. 3. For cultivation in pots, a mixture of garden soil, FYM and leaf mould in the proportion of 2:1:1 should be used.\n\n8. Tuberoses are propagated by bulbs, bulblets and seeds. Multiplication by bulb- segments and in vitro micro propagation from scale stem-sections is also practiced Propagation by bulbs • Most common method practiced for the commercial multiplication of tuberoses is through propagation by bulbs. • The bulbs remain dormant during the winter months in places where the temperature is low. The dormancy of the bulbs can be successfully broken by dipping the bulbs in 4% Thiourea solution for one hour if early planting is desired. • The bulbs are separated from the clumps by rubbing off the loose scales and the long roots should also be removed. • In general, spindle -shaped bulbs free from diseases having diameter between 1.5 and 3.0 cm are suitable for planting. About 1.25 - 1.5 lakh bulbs (8 to 9 tons of bulbs) are required for planting one hectare. Propagation\n\n9. Propagationby bulbsegments Propagation through mature bulbs is expensive, therefore, multiplication of growing stock can be done by division of bulbs. • Large sized bulbs having 2.1 cm or more diameter are suitable for planting purpose. • If the bulbs are very large, they are cut into 2 to 3 vertical sections, each Each of these sections is treated with copper fungicide and planted vertically in a rooting medium with its tip just showing above the surface. • A moderately warm temperature should be maintained • New bulblets along with roots develop from the basal plate. • At this stage, bulblets are transferred to the ground.\n\n10.

Varieties: Therearethreetypesof tuberose 1. Single: With one whorl of corolla and are highly scented which are chiefly used for concrete extraction. Concrete content has been observed to be 0.08 to 0.11 per cent. Loose flowers are used for making floral ornaments Ex: Kalyani Single Shringar Prajwal Rajat Rekha Hyderabad Single Culcutta Single are main varieties. Arka Nirantara\n\n15. 1.ArkaNirantara: It is released by Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR), Bangalore. 2.Shringar: cross between ‘Single x Double’ and was released by Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR), Bangalore\n\n16. 3.Prajwal: This hybrid also develops through hybridization, cross between ‘Shringar’ x ‘Mexican Single’. 4.RajatRekha: In this variety develop through induce mutation (gamma ray). It is a single flowered variety released by National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI), Lucknow.\n\n17. 2.Semi-double: Bearing two to three whorls of petals, used for concrete extraction as well as cut flower.\n\n18. 3.Double: This group comprises of varieties with more than three whorls. They are mainly used for cut flower and bouquet purpose. Ex: Kalyani Double Swarn Rekha Hyderabad Double Culcutta Double Vaibhav & Suvasini. Pearl Double\n\n19. 1.SwarnaRekha: It is developed through induce mutation (gamma ray) and release from National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI), 2.Suvasini: It is double type flower with multi whorled variety and release from Indian Institute of Horticulture Research (IIHR), Bangalore.\n\n20. 3.PearlDouble: It is double type of tuberose but, main feather flower are reddish tinged.\n\n21. CulturalPractices 1. Siteselection: The site should be chosen, where the plants will get enough sunlight throughout their growing period. The soil should have sufficient moisture holding capacity but not water logging condition. This field should be away from shade condition 2. Landpreparation: The field should be worked deep to a good plough and properly manure. Well rotten cow dung or farmyard manure @ (50-60) tonnes/ha, should be incorporated with the soil about a month before planting. Care should be taken to make the land free from weeds. 3. Seedor bulbtreatment: Before sowing bulb should be treated with GA3 or Thiourea for breaking the dormancy and easily sprouting. Pre-plant bulb should be storage at (8-10) °C for one month will improve the plant growth, increase spike and flower yield.fAt first Bulbs totally cleaned after that treated with Bavistin (0.2%) for 30 minutes to reduce fungal infection.\n\n22. Spacing,Depthandtimeof sowing • For economic returns, bulbs are planted at an optimum spacing of • 30 x 20 cm or 20 x 20 cm or 30 x 30 cm • • 5.0 to 7.0 cm depth. About 45,000 - 55,000 bulbs are required for one acre planting of tuberose. • Tuberose is generally planted in January-March in the plains and in April-May in the hills. In southern parts of India, the bulb should be planted in the month of July-August. Earthlingup andStaking • Earthling up should be needed when plant height 20-25 cm and it done up to 10-15 cm high. • • Staking is done by bamboo stick or iron angles are done in beds and string or rope may be tied in three rows along the plant to avoid lodging of tuberose plants.\n\n23. NutrientManagement • Ideal fertilizer dose are FYM (20 tonnes/ha), a fertilizer dose of 120 kg N, 60 kg P2O5 and 80 kg K2O per hectare is recommended for tuberose production. • The dose should be apply half the N, the full dose of P and K has to be applied at the time of planting and the remaining half of N is apply two split dose such as 30 and 60 days after sowing. WaterManagement • The tuberose fields should be irrigated at interval of 10-15 days, if the weather is dry • . It has been suggested that during summer months (April to June) the crop should be irrigated at weekly interval • during winter at 10 days interval.\n\n24. WeedControl • pre-emergence application of Gramaxone at 3 lit/ha or Diaron at 3kg/ha and ATP+CIPC mixture 2.0+1.5 Kg/ha, effectively controlled weeds in tuberose field. Near about 70-80% reduction of weeds was noted by the application of these chemicals. Effectof Growthregulators • Foliar application of GA3 at 50 to 100 ppm thrice at 40, 55 and 60 days after planting is found to be beneficial. • Application of both together CCC at 5000 ppm and GA3 at 1000 ppm; so result induces early flowering, increased flower stalk, number of flower florets production and improves the quality of flowers.\n\n25. PestandDiseases 1.Diseases • Flower bud rot: Erwinia sp. The disease can be controlled by the spray of Streptomycin (0.01%). • Leaf blight: Botrylis elliptica. Application of ammoniacal copper at 2gal/l00 gal of water or Greeno (0.5%) for 15 days intervals.\n\n26. • Alternaria leaf spot: Alternaria Sp. The disease can be controlled by the spray of Bordeaux mixture (0.4%), Zineb (0.5%) • Stem rot: Sclerotium rolfsii. Application of fungicide such as brassicol at 1 % or Zineb (20%) at the rate of 25 kg/Ha.\n\n27. Pests • Grasshopper Application of insecticide such as; 0.1 % Roger or 0.1 % Malathion for fortnightly • Aphids: These pests may be controlled by spraying 0.1 % Malathion or dimethoate at 10-day interval.\n\n28. • Nematodes: Application of Thimet or Furadan at 25 kg/ha or carbofuran 3-5 kg/ha, neem cake 1.5 tonne/ha controls nematode infestation. • Red Spider Mites: Apply of Kelthane at 1.2% concentration is effective to control the mites.\n\n29. Harvesting • Flowering of tuberose starts 80 to 100 days after planting and flowering time is July onwards. . • Spikes are harvested at bud-burst stage preferably in the morning before sunrise or late in the evening by clipping with a sharp knife or secateurs that gives a clean cut • About 4-6 cm basal portion has to be left to allow the growth of bulb. • The lower portion of the cut spikes immediately after harvest, are to be immersed in water for prolonging life of spikes. • For loose flower purpose individual flowers are plucked early in the morning. Yield • At first year 4-5 lakhs/ha spikes production (cut flowers purpose) and 7-10 ton/ha flowers production (loose flowers purpose); • Second and third years 5-6 lakhs/ha spikes production (cut flowers purpose) and 10-13 ton/ha flowers production (loose flowers purpose). • 25-30 tonnes/ha of bulbs and bulblets may be harvested at the end of 3rd year.\n\n30. Post HarvestActivities Packing and Transport 1. For room decoration, long spikes are preferred and are sold in bundles. Each bundle contain 100 spikes. To avoid damage of the flowers and buds, the whole bundle should be wrapped in soft, white tissue paper or polythene. These bundles are packed in rectangular bamboo baskets lined with Hessian cloth. 2. For long distance transport, they are packed in square boxes or airy baskets but packing in cardboard boxes is more suitable which can be easily transported by rail, bus or by truck. 3. Loose flowers are packed in bamboo baskets holding about 10-15 kg flowers and the baskets are covered with muslin cloth and are transported to the nearby wholesale market where they are sold by weight.\n\n31. Vaselife 1. Immediately after harvest, the lower portion of the cut spikes should be immersed in water for prolonging the vase life of spikes. 2. Further, pulsing of spikes at low temperature (100C), for about four hours with the ends immersed in water, is helpful in prolonging life of spikes to be sent to distant markets.\n\n32. Holdingsolutions • A holding solution consisting of sucrose 2 % + Al2 (SO4 )3 300 ppm is best for increasing the post harvest life and quality of cut spikes of tuberose Extractionof OilandQualityControl • The flower oil is extracted by effleurage and solvent extraction with petroleum ether. • About 150 kg of flowers yield 1 kg of absolute of enfleurage which contains 11-15% of steam volatile oil. • Extraction of tuberose flowers with petroleum ether yield 0.08 – 0.14 per cent of concrete. • The concrete contains 3 – 5 per cent of a steam volatile oil. • This concrete in turn will yield about 5.50 kg of absolute. • One hectare of tuberose plantation may yield upto 12 kg of concrete."
