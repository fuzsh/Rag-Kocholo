This temple is one of Pancha Krishna Kshetram, Krishna Aranya Kshetram and Pancha Narayana Kshetram\n\nMoolavar : Sri Loganathan / Shayamala Meni perumal. The Moolavar is giving his seva in the standing posture facing east. Prathyaksham : Bhrigu Maharishi, Brahma devan, Uparisaravasu, Gowtha Marishi, Thirumangai Alwar.Thayaar:: Sri Loganaayaki. Utsavar Thayaar is Sri Aravinda valli. Utsavar:: Damodhara Narayanan. Mangalasasanam : Thirumangaialwar; Pushkarani: Raavana pushkarani.Vimanam: Utpala Vimaanam.\n\n.The temple is believed to have been built by the Medieval Cholas of the late 8th century AD, with later contributions from Vijayanagar kings and Madurai Nayaks. The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram,\n\nAs per the Legend, pleased with Sage Vasishta’s penance, Lord Krishna appeared before him in the form of a kid. While the sage was immersed in thoughts of the Lord, Kannan picked up the butter kept for puja, swallowed it in one go and gave Vashishta the run. With Vashishta giving him a chase, the kid ran fast until he came upon the rishis doing penance there. By this time, Vashishta too had reached the spot and realising his true avatar, the sage invoked his blessings to provide darshan in a standing posture at this place. Hence this place came to be called ‘Kannan Gudi.’\n\nAs per another Legend, Azhvar was carrying gold to Srirangam for the renovation work there. Tired and hungry, azhvar decided to rest for a while under the magizha maram. The tree fanned him with cool breeze, and so azhvar slept very well. when he woke up, he felt extreme hunger, and was fed by a man (Vishnu in disguise). As he was engrossed eating, he did not notice that the man had disappeared. Realising it was the Lord, azhvar worshipped Vishnu here as Loganatha Perumal. Because all of this happened under the magizha maram, azhvar blessed it to be fresh and blossoming forever.\n\nAs per another Legend, as it was night-time, he decided to rest for a while, and to prevent thieves from stealing the murti, he buried it under a tamarind tree, asking the tree to stay awake and guard the murti. Upon waking up the following morning, he noticed the tree still awake, and blessed the tree, naming it “uranga puli” (awake tamarind tree), and since then, it is believed that this tree – which is the temple’s sthala vriksham – does not sleep.\n\nAs per another Legend – Theeraa Vazhakku (the endless dispute) : However, the owner of the land came there and claimed ownership of the gold, as it was on his land. He even proved his ownership with title documents, and an argument ensued between him and azhvar. Azhvar finally told him that he would get the documents to prove it was his gold, from Srirangam the following day. But azhvar never returned here, and the dispute is not yet resolved!\n\nThere is another Legend : Ooraa Kinaru (the perpetually dry well) Azhvar was thirsty and asked some women who were drawing water from a well, for some water. But regarding him as a troublemaker (after the episode with the landowner), they refused, and so azhvar cursed that water would not spring forth in that well. It is believed that this well has been dry since then.\n\nUnlike in other divyadesams where Garuda is seen with folded hands, here he is seen with his hands across his chest. Another unique feature here is the similarity between the face of the moolavar and the utsavar idols of Goddess, which is not seen in any other divyadesam. During the temple’s annual festival, on one specific day, Vishnu here is anointed with vibhuti which is typically seen only in Saivite temples. It is regarded that this practice is to honour king Uparicharavasu.

He will ever be drowned in the thoughts of Lord Vishnu and would not do anything without prayer to the Lord. During his meditation none would call on him and he too would not grant audience to any. It so happened that during his puja time, Sage Durvasa known for his temperament came to see him but had to wait. As he could not meet the king for a long time, he entered his Kudil the meditating room and stood before him. The king was so deep in his prayers and did not recognize the presence of the sage before him. The angry sage shouted that the king would be born an elephant as he was proud of his Bhakti. The king woke up from his meditation and sought the pardon of the sage holding his feet. Durvasa took pity on him and said that even as an elephant he would still be a staunch Vishnu devotee and added that a crocodile would hold his leg while bathing in a tank and Perumal would rush to his rescue when he cried Aadhimoolame. The sage said that he would be relieved of the curse and attain salvation.\n\nA demon, Koohoo by name was residing in a tank and had the habit of pulling the legs of those coming for a bath and harassed them, which he did to Sage Agasthya too. The angry sage cursed him to become a crocodile. When begged for the relief, the sage told the demon that he would be relieved of the curse when he caught the legs of Gajendra. Lord Vishnu would rush there to rescue the elephant when His discuss would hit him and the curse would disappear.\n\nThe curses of two sages met in Kabila theertham east of the temple. When Gajendra cried Aadhimoolame for relief from the grip of the crocodile’s teeth, Lord rushed, cut the crocodile and protected Gajendra and granted salvation, thus goes the story.\n\n“Kabi” means monkey since Aanjaneyar was given the seva of Sriman Narayanan, this Sthalam is called as “Kabishthalam”.

Since then , Pongal is offered to the Lord during the night puja and this is called Munayadarayan Pongal.\n\nAs per Legend, this is the temple where the Lord graced Vibheeshana, brother of demon king Ravana, his walking beauty. After seeing the sleeping beauty of Vishnu as Lord Ranganatha at Srirangam, Vibheeshna wanted to see the walking beauty of the Lord, upon which he was directed by the Lord to his “Keezh(akku) Veedu’ (Eastern Gateway of the Lord).It is believed that Lord Vishnu displayed his ‘walking beauty’ to Vibheeshana here on the new moon day.

Among all the three, the deity here is believed to represent the youth form of the God and hence is also fondly referred to as ‘Mohana Ranga’ and ‘Jaganmohana Ranga’.\n\nAs per the Legend, following the boon by Brahmma that he could not be killed by any (existing) weapon, Vrithrasura created havoc among the rishis by constantly disturbing their penance. When the Saptha Rishis approached Shiva for a solution they were directed to Brahmma, as he was the one who had granted the boon of invincibility. On the grounds that he did not have the power to revoke the boon, Brahmma directed them to Vishnu who asked them to seek Indra for a solution to their issue.\n\nWhen they reached Indra Logam and narrated the challenges they were facing, Indra expressed surprise at him being able to find a solution when the Tri Murthies could not. But since Vishnu suggested that he solve the problem of the rishis, Indra approached Dhathichi Rishi, who had become arrogant due to the extraordinary powers of his Tapas and asked him to sacrifice his life for the sake of protecting the rishis. When he sacrificed his body, Indra created a new Vajraayudham from the back bone of the dead rishi. After performing the final rites for the rishi, Indra took the new weapon and killed the asura.\n\nHowever, Indra was afflicted with Brahmma Hathi Dosham for taking the life of a Tapaswi like Dhathichi Rishi. Vishnu asked him to bathe in the river and perform penance at Thakshaka Kshetram ( the historical name of this location) invoking the blessings of Ranganatha Swamy. He called upon Vishwakarma, the architect and installed the Saligrama idol of Lord Ranganatha in a sleeping posture as seen in Vaikuntam atop the hooded Serpant all carved on a single stone.

So he gave it to a local king called Dharma Varma if the king consecrated the Vimanam to face the south cardinal direction eternally, blessing him and Lanka. Hence it is that the deity (in a reclining posture) faces South, his body aligned to the east-west axis.\n\nAs per another legend, once River Ganga, Cauvery, Yamuna and Saraswathi had an argument as to who is great.. Yamuna and Saraswathi relented but Ganga and Cauvery went to Sri Narayanan.

The Lord Vishnu appeared before her in the form of holy Brahmin, and hearing her tale of woe asked her to take a bath in the lake. She had a dip and this time she became Narada again. Then, Narada could know this all. He prayed to Vishnu to forgive him. The Lord then declared ” Let this lake be known as “Mukti – Kasara” the lake of Salvation I command that all holy places in all the three worlds should stay on here.\n\nThe hugeness of this profoundly venerated sanctuary was specified in Kasi Khanda and Bhima Khanda of Brahmadaivartha Purana.

The individuals who scrub down here will wipe of every one of their transgressions all things considered, Karthika Margasira and Magha, and of all days, Saturday, and Sunday are most promising for the shower.\n\nI will remain here alongside my associate Lakshmi. It would be ideal if you introduce me in with every single Vedic custom”. Holy person Narada introduced the Lord here. He has come to be known as “Bhavanarayana” which means along these lines the God that presents salvation on those that think about his, at any rate figured they may not go there in all fragile living creature and blood.

This temple is one of the One of the Pancha Narayana Kshetrams. The other Narayana Temples in the region are Damodara Narayanan temple in Thiru Kannangudi , Yadava Narayanan in Kizhvelur and Varada Narayanan in Vadakalathur, & Sri Devanarayana Perumal Temple, Thevur.\n\nThe village Aavarani, was originally named Aabharanadhari after the Lord. It is an extension of Thirukkannangudi, one of the 108 Divya Desams. It is believed that Lord Rama on his return to Ayodhya from Sri Lanka, passed through here and on the request of Brigu Maharishi and VedaVyasa rested here in the form of Mahavishnu.\n\nLord Ananthapadmanabha Swamy, at Thiruvananthapuram, is 18 feet Lord, reclining on a five headed Anantha (Adhisesha).In lesser known Aavarani, Lord Vishnu is seen as Anantha Narayana, also known as Aabharanadhari, his gigantic 21 feet form reclining on a seven- headed Anantha. This Lord, even larger than Ananthapadmanabhaswamy . The only difference here, is that this temple is relatively unknown and one can spend minutes or even hours before the Lord, without any disruption.\n\nAs per the legend, Thirumangai Alwar, desirous of raising resources for the Srirangam temple,came to Nagapattinam to steal the Golden idol of Buddha at the Vihara . He collected somebanana stems from a place called Vazhakarai, stole the Golden idol, hid it among the banana stems during the day, and travelled over night towards Srirangam. The place where he hid the statue during day has come to be known as Porulvaithacheri (now called Poravacheri nearSikkal). He then visited Aavarani and worshipped the gigantic Ananthanarayana Perumal.Seeing the huge Lord, he adorned his body with Tulsi garlands which are said to have turned into different jewels. He then called him “Aabharanadhari Narayana”. Because of this, the place came to be known as Aabharanadhari.\n\nFrom here, he went to the Thirukannangudi Damodhara Narayana Perumal temple andworshipped the Ninraan and Irundhaan (Veetrirundha Perumal) forms of the Lord. In his mangala sasanam of the Thirukkanangudi temple, the stanza beginning with “Vangamamunneer”, according to Vaishnavaite scholars, describes the Ananthanarayana Perumal of Aavarani who is reclined on the Anantha (“sangamaarangai thadamalarundhi samameniyen”)and hence it is inferred that this sthalam must have been part of the Thirukkannangudi Divyadesam originally. Government records also mention Aavarani village as Thirukkannangudi Agaram which re emphasises the fact that Aavarani was a Brahmadeyam (tax free landprovided to Brahmin scholars) of Thirukkanangudi.\n\nThe gigantic form of Lord Ananthanarayana Perumal completely fills the sanctum. Recliningon seven hooded Adisesha, with a Marakkal (measuring utensil) as headrest, his head isplaced in the Southern direction and feet towards North. He has a right hand supporting hishead, and a left hand extended upto his knee. He wears a number of ornaments on his body true to the name of Aabharanadhari.

This temple is one of Pancha Krishna Kshetram, Krishna Aranya Kshetram and Pancha Narayana Kshetram\n\nMoolavar : Sri Loganathan / Shayamala Meni perumal. The Moolavar is giving his seva in the standing posture facing east. Prathyaksham : Bhrigu Maharishi, Brahma devan, Uparisaravasu, Gowtha Marishi, Thirumangai Alwar.Thayaar:: Sri Loganaayaki. Utsavar Thayaar is Sri Aravinda valli. Utsavar:: Damodhara Narayanan. Mangalasasanam : Thirumangaialwar; Pushkarani: Raavana pushkarani.Vimanam: Utpala Vimaanam.\n\n.The temple is believed to have been built by the Medieval Cholas of the late 8th century AD, with later contributions from Vijayanagar kings and Madurai Nayaks. The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram,\n\nAs per the Legend, pleased with Sage Vasishta’s penance, Lord Krishna appeared before him in the form of a kid. While the sage was immersed in thoughts of the Lord, Kannan picked up the butter kept for puja, swallowed it in one go and gave Vashishta the run. With Vashishta giving him a chase, the kid ran fast until he came upon the rishis doing penance there. By this time, Vashishta too had reached the spot and realising his true avatar, the sage invoked his blessings to provide darshan in a standing posture at this place. Hence this place came to be called ‘Kannan Gudi.’\n\nAs per another Legend, Azhvar was carrying gold to Srirangam for the renovation work there. Tired and hungry, azhvar decided to rest for a while under the magizha maram. The tree fanned him with cool breeze, and so azhvar slept very well. when he woke up, he felt extreme hunger, and was fed by a man (Vishnu in disguise). As he was engrossed eating, he did not notice that the man had disappeared. Realising it was the Lord, azhvar worshipped Vishnu here as Loganatha Perumal. Because all of this happened under the magizha maram, azhvar blessed it to be fresh and blossoming forever.\n\nAs per another Legend, as it was night-time, he decided to rest for a while, and to prevent thieves from stealing the murti, he buried it under a tamarind tree, asking the tree to stay awake and guard the murti. Upon waking up the following morning, he noticed the tree still awake, and blessed the tree, naming it “uranga puli” (awake tamarind tree), and since then, it is believed that this tree – which is the temple’s sthala vriksham – does not sleep.\n\nAs per another Legend – Theeraa Vazhakku (the endless dispute) : However, the owner of the land came there and claimed ownership of the gold, as it was on his land. He even proved his ownership with title documents, and an argument ensued between him and azhvar. Azhvar finally told him that he would get the documents to prove it was his gold, from Srirangam the following day. But azhvar never returned here, and the dispute is not yet resolved!\n\nThere is another Legend : Ooraa Kinaru (the perpetually dry well) Azhvar was thirsty and asked some women who were drawing water from a well, for some water. But regarding him as a troublemaker (after the episode with the landowner), they refused, and so azhvar cursed that water would not spring forth in that well. It is believed that this well has been dry since then.\n\nUnlike in other divyadesams where Garuda is seen with folded hands, here he is seen with his hands across his chest. Another unique feature here is the similarity between the face of the moolavar and the utsavar idols of Goddess, which is not seen in any other divyadesam. During the temple’s annual festival, on one specific day, Vishnu here is anointed with vibhuti which is typically seen only in Saivite temples. It is regarded that this practice is to honour king Uparicharavasu.

Lord Subramanya secured the spear at Sikkal just over 5kms from here and he completed the Samhara of the Asura at Tiruchendur. When he invoked the blessings of Brahmma seeking liberation from the dosham of killing, he was directed to go back to the same place where he undertook penance and present cows to the devotees.\n\nThus, Subramanya came back here and presented milk bearing cows to the Yadava devotees of Kizhvelur.

To redeem himself, he performed tapasya. Bhagavan Vishnu asked him to install five different murtis in five different places.The temples were built by the Hoysala ruler Vishnuvardhana with the blessings of Sri Ramanujacharya after he healed the king’s daughter from a disease.\n\nIn order of consecration,the temples are Nambi Narayana [Thondanur], Cheluvanarayana [Melukote], Veeranarayana [Gadag], Keerthi Narayana [Talakadu], Vijaya Narayana [Belur] in Karnataka.\n\n4.1 Sri Nambinarayana Swami Gudi, Thondanoor\n\nSri Nambinarayana Swami Gudi, HJ4R+RP7, Thondanoor, Karnataka 571434 Sri Nambinarayana swamy Temple is located at Thondanoor, Karnataka at a distance of 160 kms from Bangalore.\n\nThondanur or more familiarly known as ‘Kere Thonnur’ is an abhimana sthalam. There are 3 temples in thondanur, all close together – Sri Nambinarayana, Sri Parthasarathy and Sri Narasimha/Sri Ramanuja temples.There is Padma theertham or Ramanuja theertham near the temples. Acharya Sri Ramanujacharya took refuge here in the 11th Century when he fled from the King, Krimikanta Raja. It is from here that Sri Yathiraja continued propagating Sri Vishista Advaitha Siddantha.\n\nDuring that time, Thennur was ruled by a Jain King Bittideva. His daughter, possessed by a ghost (Brahma Rakshasa), was in an uncontrollable state. Many people including Jain priests, tried their hands but in vain. Thennur Nambi, took the king to Sri Ramanujacharya. Acharya asked the king’s daughter to take a dip at the nearby Lake (Pancha Apsara Thataka) and visit the Yoga Narasimha Temple at the hill top. Following Acharya’s instructions, King, took his daughter to the Yoga Narasimha Temple, where the priest placed a Narasimha Dandam (Stick held by Lord Narasimha in His right hand) on top of her head, which cured her completely.\n\nElated King, moved by the philosophy of Vishishtadvaitam, taught by Sri Ramanujacharya, embraced Vaishnavisam. Sri Ramanujacharya renamed him as Vishnu Vardana. Later on Vishnuvardana donated Srirangapatna village to Sri Ramanujacharya. Vishnu Vardhana had established many temples at the behest of Sri Ramanujacharya, who himself consecrated them. Famous among them are the Pancha Narayana temples at Karnataka. 1) Sri Nambi Narayana Temple – Thondanur/ Thennur.2) Sri Thiru Narayana Temple – Melkote.3) Sri Keerthi Narayana Temple – Thalakadu. 4) Sri Vijaya Narayana (Chenna keshava) – Belur. 5) Sri Veera Narayana – Gadag.\n\nThennur Nambi, was instrumental in building a dam (Kere) across the river at Thennur. Hence this place is called Kere Thennur. Thennur was considered as the second capital during Hoysala rule.Inspired by the devotion of Thennur Nambi, Lord Narayana is said to have manifested Himself at Thennur, hence the name, Sri Nambi Narayana. The idol of Sri Nambi Narayana is 18 feet tall holding Shanku in His right and Chakra in His left. Position of Shanku and Chakra appears to be interchanged.\n\nAccording to a temple inscription, Suragi Nagaiah, one of Vishnuvardhana’s generals, is credited with building the temple in the 12th century, to commemorate the king’s victory over the Cholas at Talakad. The absence of the Raja Gopura or entrance tower is a pointer to Hoysala style of temple building. The outer walls of the temple and the entire inner circumambulatory area display a solid base and a strong structure. Ramanujacharya, it is supposed, renovated the temple, made additions to it in the form the mantapas and also consecrated the idol.\n\nThe temple as it stands today, consists of a navaranga, a maharanga mantapa, an ardha mantapa, a sukanasi, a garbha griha and a massive paataalankana. The pillars in the navaranga are embellished with motifs of flowers and beads, besides the carvings of ashtadikpalakas. The vimana or tower of the shrine is built of mortar, in Dravidian style. While the maharanga mantapa looks grand in simplicity, held aloft by 50 pillars, the paataalankana with its 40 octagonal-faced pillars. is eye-catching. The 45-feet garuda sthambha, the characteristic feature of all Vishnu temples, lies in front of the paataalankana.\n\nThe garbha griha is adorned with a tall east-facing idol of Nambi Narayana, the presiding deity. With conch in the right hand and discus in the left hand, he stands resplendent in all finery. The processional deity is Lakshmi Narayana with his consorts Sri Devi and Bhoo Devi. One of the main festivals celebrated by the temple is the five-day brahmotsava between April-May every year\n\n4.2 Sri Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple, Melukote\n\nSri Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple, Pandavapura, Taluk, Melukote, Karnataka 571431 Sri Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple, is located at Melukote, Pandavapura, Taluk, Karnataka at a distance of 150 km from Bangalore and 50 km from Mysore. Melkote is the abode of Lord Sri Thiru Narayanan Swamy. .\n\nThe utsavamurthi, which is a metallic image, represents the deity who is called Shelvapillai, Cheluva Raya and Cheluvanarayana Swamy, whose original name appears to have been Ramapriya (meaning “Rama’s Favourite”). It is believed that this utsavamurthi belonged to and was worshipped by Lord Rama and the kings of the surya vamsa Dynasty for generations. Later the same deity was given to a king of Chandra vamsam (the dynasty of Lord Krishna) and was worshipped by Lord Krishna and many generations. So CheluvaNarayana is so unique that he was worshipped by both Rama and Krishna.\n\nAgain in KALIYUGA the Deity was worshiped by the great Srivaishnava Saint Sri Ramanujacharya well known as Yathiraja Sarvabhowma (king of Yathis ) who renovated the temple after the deity and hence the city became famous by the name of Ramanujacharya as Yathishaila (mountain of yathi).\n\nIt is built on rocky hills, known as Yadugiri, Yaadavagiri and Yadushailadweepa, overlooking the Cauvery valley. This shrine is very ancient, though the temple complex is just around 1000 years old.\n\nAs per the legend, Sri Ramanuja, the great Vaishnava Acharya, stayed in Melkote for 12 years, and gained many followers, including the Hoysala King, Vishnuvardhana. During this time, the processional idol of this temple had been lost for some time. Realizing that the idol was in the possession of the Muslim emperor in Delhi, Muhammed Shah, Sri Ramanuja decided to go there and get it back.\n\nMuhammed Shah was greatly impressed by the saint and granted him permission to take it back. So, the idol came back to Melkote. This temple has been revered and worshipped by several succeeding dynasties, the Hoysalas, the Vijayanagara kings and the Mysore Maharaja. They have all made contributions to the temple in terms of grants, jewels, funds for temple maintenance etc.\n\nThe temple is lined with carved pillars and features a dome-like top decorated with highly detailed sculptures. The presiding deity is Cheluvanarayana Swamy, also known as Unggasu Wiili or Cheluvapille Raya a form of Lord Vishnu.[3] Inscriptions indicate that the deity was also known as Ramapriya.\n\nThe utsavamurthi , a metal idol sculpture used for processions and certain religious rituals, represents the deity Cheluvanarayana Swamy. The temple has a beautiful gopura which consists of shrines of Ramanuja, idols of Alwars and Yadugiriamma in the temple.\n\nVairamudi Brahmotsava (Vairamudi Utsav) is an annual spiritual event and festival revered throughout South India. In the past it has attracted up to 400,000 devotees of Lord Cheluva Narayana (Tirunarayana). The main event is the procession of Lord Cheluvanarayana Swamy through the streets of Melkote, which are decorated in his honour. In the procession the Lord’s idol is carried on a golden garuda, along with idols representing his divine consorts Sridevi and Bhudevi. The procession takes place at night and continues until dawn. The festival is named for the legendary diamond studded crown, the Vaira Mudi which the Lord only wears during this procession. For the rest of the festival the Lord wears the Rajamudi, another crown studded with precious stones.\n\nTemple timings are 7am to 1:30pm and 4 pm to 8:30pm Temple Contact Telephone Number: 08236-2\n\n4.3 Keerthi Narayanaswami temple, Talakadu\n\nKeerthi Narayanaswami temple, 52HF+VV9, Unnamed Road, Talakadu, Karnataka 571122 Keerthi Narayanaswami temple is located in Talakadu, Karnataka at a distance of 50 Kms from Mysore and 130 Kms from Bangalore. It is one of the Pancha Narayana Temples in Karnataka.\n\nThis temple is usually under sand for most of the year due to the curse of Alamelamma on the Wodeyar dynasty of Mysore.It is located on the banks of the pious Kaveri river.\n\nInitially, there was a sannidhi of Sundaravalli Thayar, which was later replaced by the navaranga mandapam having a statue of Keerthi Narayana. In the sanctum at the Keerthinarayana temple, the nine-foot-tall image of Bhagwan with Shanka in upper left hand, Chakra in upper right hand, lotus in his lower left hand and mace in his lower right hand. and Gadha stands majestically on Garuda Peeta.\n\nIt has an intricately carved mandapas with the idols of Ramanujacharya, Vedhantha Desikar, Nammazhwar in Navaranga mandapa and the figure of Ugra Narasimha in Ardha mandapa. Garuda Kamba and few more inscriptions are the other attractions of this temple. Recently during the time of excavation, the archeologists have discovered some of the structures linked with this temple that belong to the earlier days of Hoysala.\n\nThis temple was constructed in Hoysala style of architecture and tower on Sanctum in Kadamba style of architecture. This temple was built in 12th century. It is established at the behest of Shri Ramanujacharya during 10th century and was constructed later in Hoysala style during the reign of the Hoysala ruler Vishnuvardhana. It is believed that the Hoysala ruler constructed this temple to represent their victory over Cholas during 12th century and it is the only Hoysala architecture found in Talakadu today.\n\nAs per History, the temple was built by Vishnuvardhana, King of the Hoysala Empire, Sri Keerthi Narayana Temple dates prior to Hoysala independence in the mid-12th century and reflect significant Western Chalukya influences. While King Vishnuvardhana and his descendants were Vaishnava by faith, records show that the Hoysalas maintained religious harmony by building a temple dedicated to Lord Vishunu. Most of the temples have secular features with broad themes depicted in their sculptures inside the temples with Marble flooring and pillars having differnt images.\n\nDuring incessant rains and subsidence of the soil the outer wall of the Garbhagriha of the temple collapsed. By the timely temporary support provided by ‘The Archeological survey of India’ the damage to the idols were prevented and restored slightly away from the original place. But the major portion of the temple is still covered under the sand. Earlier the sanctum had a place for worshipping Sundaravalli goddess to the south of the main idol. Since the whole of the idol was covered with sand, only the main idol was installed in the navaranga mantapa. The temple that is seen in present days is excavated from under the sand during 1911.\n\nThe Keethi narayana Temple is one of the earliest known temples built in the Hoysala style. The building material is Chloritic schist, more commonly known as soapstone. The temple does not stand on a jag a feature which became popular in later Hoysala temples.The temple is a unique chatuskuta construction built inside a 7foot tall stone wall enclosure with the entrance through a porch whose roof is supported by circular lathe-turned pillars.The towers are in Kadamba nagara style. On top of the vestibule is its own tower called sukanasi. The mantapa is open and square. There is a separate shrine of Bhairava inside the complex.\n\nNearby is the well-known Lakshminarayana temple. He here is seen having a balance and kundumani in His hands.

Narayana (Maha Vishnu), the Hindu god, is the main deity in the temple. With the statues of various gods and goddesses, the gopuram looks astounding indeed.\n\nKing Vishnuvardhana built some of the best specimens of Hoysala temple architecture during his reign. It is believed that at the behest of Sri Ramanujacharya, he built five temples dedicated to Narayana (Pancha Narayana Kshetras) — .Chennakeshava Temple at Belur, Cheluvanarayana Temple at Melkote, Nambinarayana Temple at Tondanur, Veeranarayana Temple at Gadag and Kirtinarayana Temple at Talakad.\n\nUnder King Vishnuvardhana, the northern extent of the empire was up to Lakkundi. . Built in 1117 AD, the temple is known more for the legends that are linked to it than the architectural significance. The temple has Chalukya, Hoysala and Vijayanagar influences. The entrance gateway is in Vijayanagar style. This leads to a garudastambha and the ranga mantapa, which are in Hoysala style. The inner mantapa, sanctum and the main tower are in Chalukya style.\n\nIn Garbhagudi Shri Veeranarayana statue carved In the dark blue shaded stone attracts everyone.

The main entrance is known as ‘mahadwara’ and the tower known as “gopura” resemble the Vijayanagara model while the ‘garuda stambha’ (literal meaning “eagle pillar”) and ‘ranga mantapa’ (“gathering hall”) are built in the Hoysala style.

The king had fought wars with the Western Chalukyas and had also defeated the Cholas. The temple was built after the land’s best architects and artists were recruited and engaged in producing new designs and styles that would be the hallmark of the complex.\n\nThe Chennakesava temple is a fine example of fine quality work of art in stone. There are more than 80 Madanika sculptures in the temple, dancing, hunting, standing under canopies of trees and so on. The 4 Madanika figures (striking elegant dancing poses) on the wonderfully engraved columns of Navaranga are unique creations of Hoysala workmanship. The Garbhagriha is stellar in shape and its zigzag walls make the figures of 24 forms of Vishnu look different at different times of the day due to light.\n\nThe temple was built by master craftsmen – Dasoja and Chavana, a father and son duo, hailing from Balliganve, a centre of Kalyana Chalukya art in Shimoga district. It is said that Shantaladevi, the accomplished queen of King Vishnuvardhana is the model for one of the sculptures in the Vavaranga – Darpana Sundari.

The temple’s scale is what distinguishes it from many other temples of the Hoysala period and it is considered to be one of the earliest creations of the dynasty. At its highest, the temple stands 37 metres tall. Its outer walls are adorned with finely done artwork, with dancing girls in various postures.\n\nThe pillars of the temple exhibit some of the best details and finishing of sculpture and art work in the entire complex. The Narasimha pillar is one of the most popular of these temple pillars. There are a total of 48 pillars, all uniquely carved and decorated. The four central pillars were hand chiselled by artisans and feature madanikas or celestial damsels.
