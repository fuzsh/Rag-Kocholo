It is one of the five important pilgrimage sites of Vaishnavism along the river Kaveri for devotees of Ranganatha. These five sacred sites are together known as Pancharanga Kshetrams in Southern India. Since Srirangapatna is the first temple starting from upstream, the deity is known as Adi Ranga (lit; “first Ranga”). the first temple on the banks of the Kaveri River from the upstream side; the Srirangam (island in Tiruchirappalli) in Tamil Nadu known as Kasthuri Rangam or Anthya Rangam (the last temple), Appalarangam or Koviladi at Tiurppernagar in Tamil Nadu, Parimala Ranganatha Perumal Temple at Tiruindalur in Mayiladuthurai or Mayuram and Vatarangam near Sirkazhi, also listed as Sri Renganatha Perumal Temple, Vadarengam, Tamil Nadu,\n\nThe main deity here is Lord Ranganatha who is a manifestation of Lord Vishnu. Idol of the Lord is in resting posture on a bed of serpent Aadi Sesha. Aadi Sesha is said to have seven heads and if often depicted with the Lord Vishnu. It is said that this is one of the biggest idols of Lord Vishnu in the reclining posture. Idol of Goddess Lakshmi by the side of Lord’s feet can also be seen. Goddess Ranganayaki is considered to be the principal goddess here. Other shrines inside the temple complex are Srinivasa, Ranganayaki, Rama, Narasimha, Sudarshana, Panchamukha Anjaneya and Gopalakrishna.\n\nThe beauty of the Lord’s idol and the architectural excellence of the temple captivate every devotee. It’s mesmerising carvings and structure is alluring. Although first built in 894 AD; this temple went through many renovations and expansions under varied reigns such as Hoysalas, Hyder Ali, Vijayanagar and Wodeyars Dynasty. Its architecture can be traced back to Vijayanagar as well as Hoysala style.\n\nThe entrance of the temple with four majestic pillars which have been beautifully crafted with 24 forms of Lord Vishnu is an example of Hoysala architectural style which gives importance to artistic side of any creation. It is said that as Hoysalas appreciated art and crafts as well as supported artisans in their creations. The exquisite works on the temple reflect the same style of architecture. Another example is the temple’s prakaram which has been painted with wide array of mythological stories. At the same time, one can also see influences of Vijayanagar style of architecture. Gopuram of the temple with intricate carvings reflect Vijayanagar style. Sri Ranganatha Swamy Temple also has magnificent walls, similar to those around forts. There is a navaranga mandapam, surrounding the sanctum sanctorum of the temple.\n\nSri ranganatha Swamy Temple was built in 894 AD. However, it underwent many structural changes during varied rulers belonging to Vijayanagar dynasty, Hoysalas, Mysore Wodeyars Kings and Hyder Ali. These kingdoms contributed to a large extent in the expansion of the temple. The current structure with its entrancing architecture is also a result of the changes during these reigns. This temple was built by the Vijayanagara Empire while later Hyder Ali and Hoysala rulers brought some changes to it. Even Mysore Maharajas contributed a lot for its expansion.\n\nThe Ranganathaswamy temple has huge engraved chariot of Sri Ranganathaswamy which is one of the mesmerizing sites to look for the details of inscription on it. Stunning view of the architectural carving along with merging with the mysticism makes it a perfect place to embrace this classical masterpiece.\n\nIt is believed that Cauvery River while on her way formed three islands namely Shivanasamudra, Srirangapatna and Srirangam. Devotees who visit three temples at these places on the same day are sure to attain moksha. Temple Timings are 7.30 am to 1 pm. 4 pm to 8 pm. Ancient Lakshmi Narashimhaswami Temple in Srirangapatna is nearby (100 yards) and one must have darshan in that temple as well.\n\n3.2 Madhya Ranga Shree Ranganathaswamy Temple, Shivanasamudra, Karnataka\n\nMadhya Ranga Shree Ranganathaswamy Temple, Shivanasamudra, Barachukki Falls Road, 75C9+5VF, Kollegal, Karnataka 571440 Ranganathaswamy Temple is located at , Shivanasamudra, Kollegal, Karnataka 70 kms from Mysore. Located on the banks of the Cauvery is the Ranganatha Swamy temple in Sathyagala, referred to as Madhay Rangam, a temple whose legend dates back to the Kretha Yugam.\n\nBelief is that one’s prayers will be fulfilled if one visits the three ancient Ranganathaswamy temples located on the banks of the Cauvery on the same day – Srirangapatna (Aadhi Rangam), Sathyagala (Madhya Rangam) and Srirangam (Anthya Rangam) on the same day. For long, the practice with the devotees has been to have Vishroopa Sevai at Srirangapatna at 730am, darshan at Sathyagala at 9am and the third darshan at Srirangam in the evening. Among all the three, the deity here is believed to represent the youth form of the God and hence is also fondly referred to as ‘Mohana Ranga’ and ‘Jaganmohana Ranga’.\n\nAs per the Legend, following the boon by Brahmma that he could not be killed by any (existing) weapon, Vrithrasura created havoc among the rishis by constantly disturbing their penance. When the Saptha Rishis approached Shiva for a solution they were directed to Brahmma, as he was the one who had granted the boon of invincibility. On the grounds that he did not have the power to revoke the boon, Brahmma directed them to Vishnu who asked them to seek Indra for a solution to their issue.\n\nWhen they reached Indra Logam and narrated the challenges they were facing, Indra expressed surprise at him being able to find a solution when the Tri Murthies could not. But since Vishnu suggested that he solve the problem of the rishis, Indra approached Dhathichi Rishi, who had become arrogant due to the extraordinary powers of his Tapas and asked him to sacrifice his life for the sake of protecting the rishis. When he sacrificed his body, Indra created a new Vajraayudham from the back bone of the dead rishi. After performing the final rites for the rishi, Indra took the new weapon and killed the asura.\n\nHowever, Indra was afflicted with Brahmma Hathi Dosham for taking the life of a Tapaswi like Dhathichi Rishi. Vishnu asked him to bathe in the river and perform penance at Thakshaka Kshetram ( the historical name of this location) invoking the blessings of Ranganatha Swamy. He called upon Vishwakarma, the architect and installed the Saligrama idol of Lord Ranganatha in a sleeping posture as seen in Vaikuntam atop the hooded Serpant all carved on a single stone. A unique feature is the presence of Garuda, the sworn enemy of Adisesha on this stone carving signifying the unity of the people in this region. Historically, the Vadakalaiyars and Thenkalaiyars have lived in harmony in this location.\n\nThe temple timings are : 730am-1230pm and from 430pm to 8pm.\n\nThere are three more temples in three other sides of the island. The ancient Sri Someshwara Temple is another famous temple here at Shivanasamudra. Adi guru Sri Shankaracharya is said to visited this place and has established a “Sri Chakra” in this place. Surprisingly, it is believed that the Someshwara Linga here is said to have been existing much before the Ranganantha Idol and that the Saptarshis were performing pooja and worshipping this Linga. The Shakthi Devathe temple of Vanadurga Devi is 1 km away from the Someshwara temple.

So he gave it to a local king called Dharma Varma if the king consecrated the Vimanam to face the south cardinal direction eternally, blessing him and Lanka. Hence it is that the deity (in a reclining posture) faces South, his body aligned to the east-west axis.\n\nAs per another legend, once River Ganga, Cauvery, Yamuna and Saraswathi had an argument as to who is great.. Yamuna and Saraswathi relented but Ganga and Cauvery went to Sri Narayanan.

Sri Renganatha Perumal Temple, Vadarengam, Tamil Nadu is listed as Pancha ranga Kshetram in place of Sarangapani temple in some references.\n\nThe temple has contributions from Medieval Cholas, Vijayanagar Empire and Madurai Nayaks. The rajagopuram has eleven tiers and has a height of 173 ft and is amongst 3 tallest Divya desam temples (Srirangam -236 feet & Sri villiputhur – 192 feet). The Potramarai tank, the temple tank, is located opposite to the western entrance of the temple.\n\nLord Vishnu gave darshan to sage Hema Rishi (who was Brigu rishi in the previous bith – to atone his sin was born as Hema rishi) , who performed penance in the bank of Potramarai tank\n\nThe Nalayira Divya Prabandham is a collection of 4,000 Tamil verses composed by the 12 Alvars in praise of Lord Vishnu and his many forms. Legend has it that Nathamuni (who was born in Veera Naarayanapuram (Veeranam) or present-day Kaattu Mannaar Koil) wanted to hear the complete works – which was not readily available. In search of the same, he came to Sarangapani temple and prayed to Lord Aravamudan .Immedietely a flash ran in his mind the last line of the II Paasurams said that it was written by Sadagopan of Thirukurukur. He thanked the god to remind him and headed straightly to Thirukkurukur. He started to chant the II Paasurams he got from Madhurakavi alwar without stopping for 12,000 times. Nammalwar appeared before Naadhamunigal and started to teach him all the 4000 paasurams and Naadhamunigal compiled the versus..\n\nOnce Therumazhisai Alwar came to have a dharsan of Aaraamudha perumal. He was very much impressed by his beauty and wanted to have a chat with him. So he prayed the Lord and after some times, the Lord Wanted to answer his prayer and hence he lifted his head from the sleeping posture and started to get up. But, Alwar didnt want to disturb his sleep and hence he requested perumal not to get up and to remain in the same posture so as to bless each devotee visiting him . The pose of Aara Amudhan is called as Uthra Sayanam.\n\nAnother heart rendering real story : Once there lived a great Sri Vishnu bhaktha named “Narayaswamy” in Thirukudanthai. He was very rich but had no children and so at one stage he devoted all his money and wealth to the Aara Amudhan’s temple. His neighbors asked him to adopt a son to render rites and rituals after his death, Narayanaswamy told them that, after his death, Lord Aaraamudhan would come in person to perform his rites. So happened after his death, a young man came from nowhere and performed his last rites. Till now on certain day of the year, all the things necessary for doing rites and rituals are kept in the Aaraamudhans sannadhi and the temple is closed, so that Aaraamudha perumal would performing the rituals for Narayanaswamy’s death.\n\nFive Vishnu temples are connected with Mahamaham festival which happens once in 12 years in Kumbakonam. They are Sarangapani Temple, Chakrapani Temple, Ramaswamy Temple, Rajagopalaswamy Temple and Varahaperumal Temple.\n\n3.7 Aadhi Thiruvarangam Perumal Koil,Thiruvarangam, Tamil Nadu – 29 feet Largest Ranganathar Idol\n\nAadhi Thiruvarangam Perumal Koil, Thiruvarangam Road, Thiruvarangam, Tamil Nadu 605802 Aadhi Thiruvarangam Perumal Koil, is located at Thiruvarangam, at distance of 28 kms from Tiruvannamalai & 16 kms from Tirukovilur. It is considered to be more ancient than Srirangam temple Hence the Lord is called: “Peria Perumal”. Believed to be existing from Thretha yugam. Reclining Anantha sayana perumal 15 feet in length. Can have a quite darshan unlike in Srirangam.Not known to many.\n\nMoolavar : Ranganatha Swamy, Thayar : Rangavalli Thayar. Theertham : Chandra Pushkarani, Thenpennai river. The temple has a 3 tier Rajagopuram.Lying in a sleeping posture from South to North, Lord Ranganatha has his head on the lap of Sri Devi-on his left, while his left leg is stretched towards Bhoo Devi seen at his feet. To his right is Garuda ever ready to be of service to the Lord.\n\nConstructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is believed to have been built by the Medieval Cholas, with later contributions from Vijayanagar kings. The temple covers an area of 5 acres and has a historical grain storage container. Ranganatha Perumal is believed to have appeared to king Mahabali and the Azhwars.\n\nAs per legend, evas, who lost the Vedic scriptures after being defeated by Asura Shomugan, approached Brahmma who in turn sought the help of Lord Narayana. Finding out the hide-out of the Asura under the sea, Lord Narayana took the form of Matsya and defeated the Asura and handed back the Vedic scriptures to Brahmma. It is believed that the Lord initiated the Vedic lessons to Brahmma in this Kshetram. One sees the Lord with his left thumb folded towards his fingers in a posture indicating this. Acceding to the prayers of the Devas, Lord Narayana is said to have directed his sculptor Vishwakarma to create an image of his similar to the one in Thiru Paarkadal.\n\nAs per another legend,. In Kretha Yugam, a king by name Suratha Keerthi lived a prosperous life but he had one unfulfilled wish. He did not have a child. As suggested by Sage Narada, he came, with his wife, to the place where Lord Ranganatha was sleeping under Adhiseshan and undertook penance. Answering his prayers, he was blessed with four children.\n\nAs per another legend,. Chandran, who showed love to only one of his 27 wives, was cursed by his other wives to lose his handsome looks. He came to Uthara Rangam, undertook penance in the temple tank to the South East of the temple and was liberated from his curse. Hence, the pushkarni here is called Chandran Pushkarani.\n\nThis is a Prarthana Sthalam for: Good Education (as the Lord initiated Brahmma with the Vedic lessons), Progeny(as the Lord granted the wishes of the King who prayed here) and One’s overall well being as Lord Ranganatha himself directed that an image of his be created at this place. The temple is open from 6.30am to 6 pm – open all the time.\n\n3.8 Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala – Anantha Sayanam\n\nSree Padmanabhaswamy Temple, West Nada, Fort, East Fort, Pazhavangadi, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala 695023 Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple, is located in the heart of Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala at a distance of 5 Kms from Airport it was established about 5000 years ago.. It is one of the 108 sacred Vishnu temples or Divya Desams in India.The 8th century Tamil poet Alvar Nammalvar sang the glories of Padmanabha. Srimad Bhagavatha says that Balarama visited this Temple, bathed in Padmatheertham and made several offerings.\n\nIt is dedicated to Lord Anantha, an avatar of Lord Vishnu. Thiruvananthapuram literally means “The land of Lord Anantha”. Vishnu Purana, Brahma Purana, Matsya Purana, Varaha Purana, Skanda Purana Padma Purana, Vayu Purana and Bhagavata Purana mention the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The Temple has been referred to in the Sangam period literature.\n\nThe Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple as per belief is located at a place that is considered as one of the seven Parasurama Kshetras. The temple stands close to the holy tank – Padma Theertham, which means ‘lotus spring.’\n\nIt is believed that Parasurama purified and venerated the idol of Sree Padmanabhaswamy in Dvapara Yuga. Parasurama entrusted ‘Kshethra karyam’ (Administration of the Temple) with seven Potti families – Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti, Neythasseri Potti and Sreekaryathu Potti. King Adithya Vikrama of Vanchi (Venad) was directed by Parasurama to do ‘Paripalanam’ (Protection) of the Temple. Parasurama gave the Tantram of the Temple to Tharananallur Namboothiripad. This legend is narrated in detail in the Kerala Mahathmyam which forms part of the Brahmanda Puranam.\n\nThe palm leaf records at the temple mention that sage Divakara Muni Vilwamangalam founded it. He performed rituals at Padmanabhaswamy Temple Kasaragod, also known as Ananthapura Lake Temple. And that temple is said to be the original seat (moolasthanam) of Anantha Padmanabhaswamy. As per the legends, Lord Vishnu appeared before sage Vilwamangalam as an orphan kid. The sage felt pity and allowed him to stay at the temple. He took his help in the daily activities of the temple. One day, Vilwamangalam acted harshly on the kid, who then, ran away towards the forest.\n\nBut, Vilwamangalam soon realized that the boy was Lord Vishnu himself. So, he went to find him. He followed him inside a cave, which led to present-day Thiruvananthapuram. The boy then disappeared into a mahua tree. The tree fell and took the shape of Lord Vishnu lying on the thousand hooded serpent – Adi Shesha. The size of Lord Vishnu in this Ananthasayanam posture extended up to 8 miles, and sage Vilwamangalam requested him to condense to a smaller size. Lord shrank, but still, the sage couldn’t see him completely. Trees obstructed his view, and he could see Lord Anantha in three parts – the face, the stomach area and the feet.\n\nThe doors of Shri Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Trivandrum show the large idol in the same way as the sage saw the lord. Later, during the 15th century, the roof of sanctum sanctorum was repaired, as mentioned in the palm leaf records. The Ottakkal Mandapam in the premises was built about the same time. And around the mid-17th century, King Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma ordered major renovations in the temple.\n\nThe sanctum sanctorum was reconstructed, and the old idol was replaced by a statue made of 12,008 shaligram stones and various herbs, collectively called katu-sharkara. By 1739, the work on the statue was completed. The king also built the stone corridor, the gate and the flagstaff.Then, in 1750, he dedicated his kingdom to the lord, in the Thrippadidanam ceremony. In 1758, the pillared outdoor hall – Karthika Mandapam, was built by king Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma. And in 1820, during the time of queen Gowri Parvathi Bayi, the large Anantha Shyana mural was drawn.\n\nthe Temple architecture is an amalgam of Kerala style and Dravidian style, and the temple features a 100-foot tall gopuram Inside, in the main shrine, an 18-foot idol of the principal deity lies on Adi Shesha, in the Ananthasayanam posture.It stands out for the detailed work in stone and bronze. The temple resembles Adi Kesava Perumal temple of Thiruvattar. Even the deities look similar, lying in a reclining posture. The magnificent seven-tier high gopuram, carved with elaborate designs, is the first structure you will notice. The large corridor inside is supported by beautifully carved stone pillars and sculptures of various Hindu deities. Beautiful murals also adorn the walls and ceilings in various parts of the temple.\n\nInside the sanctum, Sri Padmanabha reclines on Adi Shesha whose hoods form an umbrella over his head. The sanctum has three doors from which you can look at the reclining 18-foot idol of Lord Padmanabha. It is the richest temple in the world. The Padmanabhaswamy Temple trust, headed by the royal family of Travancore, looks after the assets.The treasure is a collection of valuable objects accumulated over several thousands of years. It includes coins, statues, ornaments and many other precious artefacts, donated by rulers and traders from around the world. And as per the estimates, the value is in several thousand crores.\n\nIt is regarded as a Maha-kshetram (Great Temple) because of its architectural magnificence, historical importance, spiritual significance, and several other reasons. Inside the main shrine, the 18-foot katu-sharkara idol of Lord Padmanabha (an incarnation of Lord Vishnu) rests on the serpent Adi Shesha (also known as Anantha Shesha). The idol is made up of 12,008 shaligrams, and can be viewed through the three doors of the sanctum.\n\nThrough the first door, you can see the face and upper body of the deity. The right hand rests over a Shiva Lingam. The idol is surrounded by Lakshmi Devi (the Goddess of Prosperity) and Bhu Devi (the Goddess of Earth). And the presence of Shiva within the sanctum sanctorum adds to the sanctity of this Maha-kshetram dedicated to Vishnu. You’ll find images of Lord Shiva adorning the walls in many other parts of the temple.\n\nThe second door of the shrine provides a glimpse of Lord Brahma, on a lotus flower, emerging from the navel of the deity. And from the third door, you can see the feet of Lord Padmanabha. Along with the shrine of Lord Padmanabha, the temple complex has shrines for several other deities : Narasimha,, Parthasarathi, Ganesha, Lord Rama, accompanied by Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman, and Sastha (the God of teaching) among others.The temple premises also have a separate Thiruvambadi Sree Krishnaswamy Temple. It has got a standalone flag-staff and its own rites and rituals.\n\nOttakkal Mandapam: is a single stone platform in front of the sanctum sanctorum of Lord Padmanabha. It is a twenty square feet platform built with granite, which is two-and-a-half feet thick. One must ascend the platform to have a darshan of the lord. Ottakkal Mandapam is also used to perform Abhishekams (bathing ceremony) to Sree Padmanabhaswamy.\n\nAbhisravana Mandapam is a stone structure present within the temple complex which is in front of Ottakkal Mandapam, and it is used during special poojas during various festivals in the temple. Devotees also use this mandapam to meditate and pray to the lord. Kulasekhara Mandapam is another architectural marvel built with stone. The structure is supported by 28 pillars, each adorned with carved figures. The pillars produce distinct musical notes when you tap them. This mandapam is also known as Aayiramkaal Mandapam or Sapthaswara Mandapam.\n\nDhwaja Stambham is the 80 feet high flag-staff near the eastern corridor made of teak wood and covered with gold foils. The top of the flag-staff has a figure of Garuda Swamy, the sacred bird used by the lord as his vehicle. The figure is in a kneeling posture. Temple pond: is a sacred pond on the eastern side of the temple. It is one of the many sacred water bodies in the state and among the oldest ponds in the city. Eight of the mandapams within the temple complex are in the Padmatheertham pond.\n\nSreebalippura is a magnificent rectangular corridor built of stone. As per the records, 4000 artisans, 6000 labourers and 100 elephants worked tirelessly to build this stone corridor which surrounds the main shrines of the temple. It is supported by 365 and a quarter monolith pillars. It is through Sreebalippura that the special Sreebali procession is taken through, during the Alpasi and Painkuni festivals.\n\nGopuram: Padmanabhaswamy Temple has nine entrances, indicating the nine orifices of the human body. And there’s a seven-storey high gopuram built on the eastern entrance. This 100-foot-high entrance tower is constructed in Pandyan style popular among the temples in South India. The 10 incarnations of Lord Vishnu are depicted on this gopuram, and on the top, you’ll see seven golden domes.\n\nMural paintings: The temple walls, including the outer walls of the shrines of Sree Padmanabha and Sree Krishna, have many murals. And the Ananthasayanam mural on the backside of the main sanctum is said to be the largest among the temple murals in Kerala. It is 18 feet long. Temple clock tower – Methan Mani, near the temple entrance, is another spot you shouldn’t miss during your visit. It is a beautiful antique clock situated exactly opposite to the entrance of Padmanabhaswamy Temple.\n\nWhile visiting the temple, you need to follow the dress code.Darshan timings : 3.15 AM to 4.15 AM. 6.30 AM and 7 AM, 8.30 AM and 10 AM, and between 10.30 AM and 11.10 AM.

Sun’s rays fall directly on the Lord for a week in the month of Puratasi and Panguni Parasuraman is said to have undertaken penance at this place . Chaitanya Maha Prabhu visited the temple in 1510AD. Sage Vashista is said to have stayed here for several years\n\nMoolavar :Adi Kesava Perumal, Thaayar: Maragada Valli Thaayar; Utsavar : Adi Kesavan.The temple is surrounded on three sides by rivers (Kothai,Parali and Thamirabarani). Paraliyar takes a turn in this place and it is called vattaru and when the temple of Adikeasav Perumal was created it came to be known as Thriuvattaru.\n\nThe idol of Adikesava and Sree Padmanabha are installed in such a way that they face each other. The lord is lying on his snake couch and has to be viewed through three doors. We could see Lord Shiva near the Lord Adikesava Perumal inside the sannidhi. In this temple status of Lord Vishnu is made up of Kaduku (mustard), chippi (lime powder) and sarkara (jaggery). Sculptures and mural paintings of this temple are amazing. Really we have to appreciate the sculptors those who designed the temple.\n\nAs per legend , Lord Brahma performed a Yagna without Saraswathi and as a result of Saraswathi’s anger, two asuras by name Kesan and Kesi emerged out of the Yaga agni.They caused all troubles to Sages and Devas. They came to Lord Vishnu for protection. Lord killed Kesan and used Kesi as a pillow for his bed. The demon’s wife, to avenge the Lord, called Rivers Ganga and Tambiraparani to help her.They came in spate to wash off the Lord. Mother Earth simply raised the ground level where Perumal was reclining. Both Rivers went round the Lord, prayed to Him and continued to flow round as two garlands. This event is mentioned in Nammalvar’s Mangalasasanam hymn. As Perumal destroyed demon Kesan, He is named Kesava Perumal. Kesi tried his best to escape from the Lord with his 12 hands. Lord put 12 Rudrakshas in his hand and foiled his escape bid. 12 Shiva temples came into being through these Rudrakshas around Tiruvattaru. During Shivrathri, devotees run to cover all the 12 Siva temples and end the prayer with Lord Shiva at the feet of Adikesava Perumal. The practice continues even today.\n\nHistorical facts and scriptures say that,during 1740 the men of the Nawab of Arcot looted this temple and the golden utsavar. As it was so heavy to carry,he kept the idol along with rubbish in a lumber room so it can be taken later. Every day, the idol would rise and come on top of the debris. During that time, the Nawab’s wife became seriously ill which could not be cured by anyone. Adi Kesava Perumal appeared in the dreams of the temple priest and asked him to go to the Nawab and inform him that if the idol was returned, his wife would be cured. The Nawab repented for his acts and returned the idol and his wife was cured. The grateful Nawab gifted a silver plate and a cap to Perumal and even today this is used at the time of Seeveli everyday.He also provided funds for conducting annual puja,Thiru Alla Pooja.\n\n3.10 Sri Anandha Narayana Perumal Temple, Abaranadari, Tamil Nadu\n\nSri Anandha Narayana Perumal Temple, Abaranadari, Tamil Nadu 611104 Sri Anandha Narayana Perumal Temple is located in Abaranadari, Tamil Nadu at a distance of 25 Kms from Tiruvarur and 10 kms from Nagapattinam. This temple is one of the One of the Pancha Narayana Kshetrams. The other Narayana Temples in the region are Damodara Narayanan temple in Thiru Kannangudi , Yadava Narayanan in Kizhvelur and Varada Narayanan in Vadakalathur, & Sri Devanarayana Perumal Temple, Thevur.\n\nThe village Aavarani, was originally named Aabharanadhari after the Lord. It is an extension of Thirukkannangudi, one of the 108 Divya Desams. It is believed that Lord Rama on his return to Ayodhya from Sri Lanka, passed through here and on the request of Brigu Maharishi and VedaVyasa rested here in the form of Mahavishnu.\n\nLord Ananthapadmanabha Swamy, at Thiruvananthapuram, is 18 feet Lord, reclining on a five headed Anantha (Adhisesha) .In lesser known Aavarani, Lord Vishnu is seen as Anantha Narayana, also known as Aabharanadhari, his gigantic 21 feet form reclining on a seven- headed Anantha. This Lord, even larger than Ananthapadmanabhaswamy . The only difference here, is that this temple is relatively unknown and one can spend minutes or even hours before the Lord, without any disruption.\n\nAs per the legend, Thirumangai Alwar, desirous of raising resources for the Srirangam temple,came to Nagapattinam to steal the Golden idol of Buddha at the Vihara . He collected somebanana stems from a place called Vazhakarai, stole the Golden idol, hid it among the banana stems during the day, and travelled over night towards Srirangam. The place where he hid the statue during day has come to be known as Porulvaithacheri (now called Poravacheri nearSikkal). He then visited Aavarani and worshipped the gigantic Ananthanarayana Perumal.Seeing the huge Lord, he adorned his body with Tulsi garlands which are said to have turned into different jewels. He then called him “Aabharanadhari Narayana”. Because of this, the place came to be known as Aabharanadhari.\n\nFrom here, he went to the Thirukannangudi Damodhara Narayana Perumal temple andworshipped the Ninraan and Irundhaan (Veetrirundha Perumal) forms of the Lord. In his mangala sasanam of the Thirukkanangudi temple, the stanza beginning with “Vangamamunneer”, according to Vaishnavaite scholars, describes the Ananthanarayana Perumal of Aavarani who is reclined on the Anantha (“sangamaarangai thadamalarundhi samameniyen”)and hence it is inferred that this sthalam must have been part of the Thirukkannangudi Divyadesam originally. Government records also mention Aavarani village as Thirukkannangudi Agaram which re emphasises the fact that Aavarani was a Brahmadeyam (tax free landprovided to Brahmin scholars) of Thirukkanangudi.\n\nThe gigantic form of Lord Ananthanarayana Perumal completely fills the sanctum. Recliningon seven hooded Adisesha, with a Marakkal (measuring utensil) as headrest, his head isplaced in the Southern direction and feet towards North. He has a right hand supporting hishead, and a left hand extended upto his knee. He wears a number of ornaments on his body true to the name of Aabharanadhari. On his head, he wears a crown, kundalams in his ears,katakas on his arms, a beautiful Nalankilar Haram on his broad chest, sacred thread, and anklets on his feet. Brahma raising from his navel, and Sridevi and Bhudevi found by his side,are also wearing ornaments. Apart from them, Sage Bhrigu and Veda Vyasa are found at thehead and foot of the Lord respectively as he gave vision to them at this site.\n\nOn entering the temple, one can see the Pakshiraja Garudalwar facing the Lord. He is seenwith snakes as ornaments on his body. He is flanked by a beautiful Hanuman, known as Padma Hanuman. Goddess Alankaravalli is found in a separate shrine . The temple well isvery special as the water is said to be extremely sweet. The temple tank is called Anantha pushkarani and bathing here and chanting Achutha, Anantha, Govindha thrice, ridsone of all problems and turns them towards liberation.

It is a cave-temple dedicated to God Ranganatha and Goddess Ranganayaki Thayar. The temple is a Pallava period structure, and was reconstructed and patronized by Krishnapa Nayakkar of Senji Nayak dynasty..\n\nThe temple is on the hill and can be reached through 160 steep steps neatly paved. A mandapa called oonjal mandapa is at the beginning of the steps with 4 pillars, of which one is original and three are of in concrete. At the start of the steps, the office is on the right and Ranganathar’s foot print ( Conch and Chakra are on both sides ) and 5 Hanumans as bas-reliefs on the left boulder. At the top of the hill is the 5 tier Rajagopuram. Sri Varadharajar temple is just after the Rajagopuram. Since this temple is not a constructed one, so the usual architecture norms cannot be applied to this temple. A Garuda thoon / Deepasthambham, balipeedam and Dwajasthambam are on the east side. Nagars are under a peepal tree.\n\nThis massive figure of the Lord is 20 feet long and 9 feet wide and looks remarkable both in terms of architecture and divine grace. This temple has its own place in history too as it was this Lord who was worshipped with devotion by Raja Desing, the heroic ruler of the nearby Senji fort.\n\nA panel in the rear wall depicts the Gandharvas and Brahma, in which Brahma is born from the navel of Vishnu. Besides Garuda, the demons Madhu and Kaitabha who were killed by Vishnu are depicted. Goddess Bhoomidevi graces the feet of the lord while Prahlada sits near his knee. Pallava cave temples, cut from rock, dating to the time of Mahendravarman or Narisimhavarman (580-688 AD), exist in Melacceri as Maddileshvara temple and at Singavaram as Ranganatha temple. As per the Mandagapattu inscription, the Pallava king, Mahendravarman I established the tradition of the Ranganatha temple.\n\nProbably the name “Singavaram” might be derived from another Pallava king, Mamalla who was either Narasimha or Simhavishnu. The Dwarapalas in this temple follow Pallava iconography. Durga with 4 hands holding the Shankha, Chakra, and two arms resting on her thigh and waist, stands on the head of Mahishasura. The Sthalapurana of the temple associates it with the legend of Prahlada, born to the demon-king Hiranyakashipu.\n\nIn a later legend, Nayaks of Gingee Krishnappa Nayakkar kept a flower garden dedicated to Lord Varadaraja Perumal. But Perumal in the form of a boar (Varaha) destroys the garden. Krishnappa Nayakar chases the animal but could not kill it. The boar goes to Singavaram, bores himself into a cave, then reveals his propria persona to the nayak. Bewildered, the nayak invokes the blessings of the Singavaram god; who then directs him to build a temple with the help of an ascetic. The ascetic attempts to kill the nayak, but the nayak kills the ascetic instead and his dead body becomes gold, using which the temple of Ranganatha inside the Gingee fort was built, and the Singavaram temple was built (refurbished).\n\nVishnu as Ranganathar is keeping his head on the south side and legs are on the north side in Bhoga sayana on Adhiseshan whose 5 headed hood is above his head and Ranganathar’s face is looking up. Brahma is seated on a Lotus flower which emanates from Vishnu’s naval. Ranganathar’s left hand is in kataka mudra and the right hand is stretched out, like patting Adhiseshan. On the right side of Brahma a flying gana holds a weapon and a sword is shown on the right. On the left of Brahma is the Garuda. His left hand is raised in suchi mudra and his right hand is on his waist. His wings are shown behind his body.\n\nDuring 1323 CE Ulugh Khan’s invasion at Srirangam, Sri Ranganathar was brought to this temple. Gopanna, a Vijayanagara official who had taken this temple’s Urchavar during Muslims invasion to Tirumala. Subsequently brought back to Singavaram and reinstated in 1371AD.

The temple is one of the oldest one built by the Pallavas with a close resemblance to the Rock Temple of Mahabalipuram . Thirumayam dates back the 7th Century AD.\n\nMoolavar : Sri Sathya Giri Nathan / “Sathya Moorthy”. He is found in Nindra (Standing) pose facing the East. Prathyaksham : To all Sathya Devar and Devadhais. The perumal gives his seva in 2 different thirukkolam.

Sthala Viruksham: (Tree) Palaa Maram (Jackfruit tree) Vimanam: Sathya giri Vimaanam.\n\nAs per the Legend, Adisheshan protects this temple. Once when the Asuras tried to rob the Lord, Adiseshan let open poisonous air to kill the Asuras. As a reference to this , one can worship Adiseshan being depicted in the same form here at this temple letting out poisonous air, which is an unique feature of Thirumayam Divyadesam.\n\nAs per another Legend, Once all the three Deities wanted to test the power and her dedication of Athiri Muni’s wife Anusuya. They all came to her place . When Anusuya was to offer them food, the Adhidhis told them that they would take food only if she serves with nudity. As expected Anusuya was not shocked, she made all the Deities to become children and served them food. By seeing this, frightened the Goddesses of all three Deities came down to Anusuya’s place and requested her to give back their Consorts. Anusuya then by spinkling the holy water from Athiri Muni’s Kamandalam, all the Deities turned back to their roopas.\n\nPleased Deities asked Anusya to ask for a boon. Anusuya requested that all the Three Deities should born as her children. The boon was granted and Anusuya was blessed with three children named Sage Durvasar, Hamsam of Lord Shiva, Datthatreyar, Hamsam of Lord Maha Vishnu and Chandhran, Hamsam of Lord Brahma Devar. Later Chandhran underwent a penance and got the boon that as he does in Surya Mandalam Lord Maha Vishnu would also reside in Chandhra Mandalam. All these three children were taught with vedas and mantras and were sent to do tapas by their father,Athiri rishi.\n\nDurvasa Rishi went to Kailash and Dattatreyar went to the foot of the Himalayas to do the tapas and the Chandran came to this Sathya giri kshetram to do the tapas towards Sriman Narayanan. Almighty gave his prathyaksham as satisfied by his tapas and asked his wish. Chandra Bhagwan requested that since he stays in Surya Mandalam his stay should be also in Chandra Mandalam. The Almighty accepted request and stayed in Chandra Mandalam also.\n\nA granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower and is behind a fort built during the 15th century after which , there is a big Mandapam with lots of stone carved pillars with beautiful paintings. Separate sannadhi for Sri Kannan, Sri Aandal, Chakrathalwar and Narasimhar are found. After crossing this Mandapam another big mandapam by named “Maha Mandapam” is found in which the Garudan facing along the Moolaver Sannadhi is found. Having Aadhiseshan as the bed, the perumal gives his Kidantha Kola seva with two Thirukkaram (hands) as same as the Ranganathar found in Sri Rangam.\n\nThis temple is similar to the temple in Mahabalipuram with lots of stone carved Sculptures and paintings and the perumal is found inside the mountain and it serves as the umbrella for him. Another temple by named “Keeyai Kovil” is found where a temple for Lord Shiva is found. The name of him is “Sathya gireeswarar”. It is said that Mahendra pallavan had constructed this temple for both Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva without having any difference between Saivism and Vaishnavism.\n\nThe Almighty in Sanctum Sanctorums in His Two Different Blessing Postures -Sathyagirinathan in His Standing Posture and having Mahalakshmi on His Chest. He is also blessing in His 24 Feet Gigantic Sayana Posture in the Sanctum sanctorum in the rock cut cave.

The Almighty worshipped by Chandra Bhagwan is on the southern side of Sathyagiri Theertham. The temple is maintained and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India as a protected monument. The temple follows the Tenkalai tradition of worship.Temple timings : 7 am to noon and 4-8 pm\n\n3.13 Budhanilkantha Narayan Temple, Kathmandu , Nepal\n\nBudhanilkantha Narayan Temple, P8P5+Q78, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal Budhanilkantha Narayan Temple is located approximately 10 kilometers from the center of Kathmandu at the base of the Shivapuri Hill, is the largest and most beautiful stone carving in all of Nepal. It is also the most enigmatic and an open air temple dedicated to large reclining statue of Lord Mahavishnu. It is also known as the Narayanthan Temple,\n\nThough the temple is named Budhanilkantha, its name does not come from the Buddha; Budhanilkantha instead has a Sanskrit origin that means ‘Old Blue Throat’, a title of Lord Shiva after the Lord drank poison to save the world. The statue symbolizes Lord Vishnu, who is regarded as one of the ‘Trimurtis’, along with Brahma and Shiva.\n\nBhagavata Purana, Vishnu Purana and the epics Ramayana and Mahabharata refer to Samudra manthan, which is directly related to the origin of Gosaikunda. According to legend the spring that feeds the pond in the Budanilkantha temple is connected to Gosaikunda which makes it to have a direct connection to the water source from Lord Shiva. This is the reason why its name is dedicated to Lord Shiva even though the statue is dedicated to Lord Vishnu since the water pond on which the statue lies, has its source to Gosaikunda dedicated to Lord Shiva which was the result of him drinking the poison and storing it in his throat resulting in him having blue throat.\n\nThis temple is regarded as a sacred place for Hindus but is equally well venerated by Buddhists (who consider the murti to be Buddha). It is considered as a sign of religious harmony that has existed in the region since ancient times\n\nCarved from a single block of black basalt stone , the Budhanilkantha statue is 5 meters in length and it lies in a reclining position inside a recessed tank of water (representing the cosmic sea) that is 13 meters in length. Called the Sleeping Vishnu, or Jalakshayan Narayan, the statue depicts the deity reclining on the twisting coils of the cosmic serpent Shesha (Shesha is the eternal, multi-headed king of the serpent deities known as Nagas, and also is the servant of Vishnu). Vishnu’s legs are crossed and the eleven heads of Shesha cradle his head. Vishnu’s four hands hold objects that are symbols of his divine qualities: a chakra or disc (representing the mind), a conch-shell (the four elements), a lotus flower (the moving universe) and the club (primeval knowledge). The statue is believed to be more than 1400 years old.\n\nTwo old stories offer differing explanations of the origin of the Budhanilkantha statue. One says that the statue was sculpted and brought (by devotees or forced labor) to its current location in Kathmandu during the reign of the seventh-century monarch Vishnugupta, who controlled the Kathmandu valley under the Licchavi king Bhimarjunadev. An alternate legend relates that in times past a farmer and his wife occupied a farm in an (unspecified) area and while cultivating the land they struck the Deity. Immediately afterwards blood began to flow from the ground and thus the lost deity of Budhanilkantha was recovered and placed in its rightful position.\n\nThe monarchs did not visit Budanilkantha because of the prophecy but visited here instead. A legend states that King Pratap Malla (1641–1674) had a prophetic vision. In the vision it was claimed that the king was cursed. If he would visit then they would die prematurely. This vision resulted in him believing that the kings of Nepal would die if they visited the Budhanilkantha Temple. Royal family members including the Nepalese monarchs after King Pratap Malla never visited the Temple in fear of the prophecy Temple timings : 5 am – 7.30 pm\n\n3.14 Sri Ranganatha Perumal, Devadhanam, Tamil Nadu\n\nSri Ranganatha Perumal, Devadhanam,108 Dhivyadesam temple Devadhanam to Thachur cross road 6Kms Anna nagar to Thanchur Cross Road, 18Kms, via, Ponneri, Tamil Nadu 601203 Sri Ranganatha Perumal, is located in Devadhanam, Tamil Nadu at a distance of 35 Kms from Chennai close to Minjur. The Presiding Deity is in a reclined posture and built by a Chalukya King around 1000 years ago\n\nThis area was gifted (danam) to Devas by Indhra and so is called Devadanam. This is an abhimana sthalam (temple built out of love), Now, this is being called Uthara rangam (North Srirangam) of Thondai nadu.\n\nThe Moolavar of this particular Temple is a replica of the Moolavar of Srirangam Perumal Temple and hence this Temple is called as Vada Srirangam. The Main Deity is around 18 feet long- 5 ft high. The special feature of this temple is that the Lord appears in ‘sudhai vadivam’ (not made of stone).- is seen sleeping on the Divine Serpent bed with 3 folds formed by the 5 headed Adiseshan with the right hand of the Lord placed beneath his head and the left hand stretched forward. A snake hill is found on the western side of this Temple and it is firmly believed that this Serpent God protects the area in general.\n\nAll the accessories of Sri Ranganathar including his jewels and ornaments have been carved wonderfully making the whole Murthy look as if it is made of a single stone. The face, hands, fingers and especially the nostrils of the God are beautifully carved in such a way that one can’t take his eyes away from the Lord while standing in front of the sanctum. Abishegam is not performed to the Lord here and only Thailakkaappu is applied. Lord Brahma is seen emerged from God’s navel and sitting on His Lotus. God is seen with Sri Devi and Bhu Devi near his feet. Sage Thumburu and Sri Anjaneyar are seen praying the Lord.\n\nUnusually, Sri Ranganathar is resting his head on a ‘Padi’ (படி) which is used to measure the grains. ‘Padi’ serves the Lord as a pillow on which his right hand is placed. It is said that the temple enjoyed huge acres of lands as its property those days and hence the Lord is having the ‘Padi’ as his pillow, which he will measure to feed the world.\n\nThe Consort is called as Ranganayaki Thaayar. A Chakkrathalwar Sannathi is also found on the rear of the Temple. Other deities of the temple are Garuda near Dwajasthambha, Ranganayaki, Aandaal, Chakkarathaazhwar. Kouthugar, Hanuman and Thumburu Maharishi.\n\nAs soon as one enters the tower gate of the temple, one can see a balipeedam, dwajasthambam and Garuda shrine. The protector of this temple is Lord Nagaraja, who can be seen at the south-east of the temple. It is believed that if one lights a ghee lamp for seven Saturdays continuously, their wishes will be fulfilled. If one is afflicted with Nagadosham, it can be absolved by coming round the deity Nagaraja. Temple Timings: 7 AM to 11 AM and 4-30 PM to 7 PM.

Ramar always in the standing posture in all temples. Sayana Kolam (sleeping posture) is very rare. The deity is about 18 feet, sleeping on Adhi Sesha and Goddess Seetha in sitting posture. The face of Lord Rama is as beautiful as Lord Ranganatha. After Tirupullani in Ramanathapuram district closely linked with the Ramayana epic, this is rather the only temple where Lord Sri Rama graces devotees in His reclining posture.\n\nAs per the history, the king who ruled the Gingee. Venkatapathy Nayakkar’s sister renovated or constructed the temple. It was named as Venkatammal Pettai in her honour. Now the name stands as Venkattampettai.\n\nLord Sri Rama appears in His reclining form on Adisesha. Mother Sita is at His feet. Ramar has two hands and have no counch and chakra as lord assumes human form.Lord keeps his head in a stone as he was in the exile in the forest.Lakshmana, avatar of Adhisesha always with Lord exists here in the form of 7 head Adhi seshsa.LordAnjeneya as bhaktha at his feet As per legend, a farmer was tilling his soil. The plough stuck at a place and the bulls could not go further. Digging the ground, he found the idol of Lord Ananthasayana Rama. The idol was brought to the temple with the help of the villagers.\n\nAs per a Legend, from the day Mother Sita was abducted by Ravana till She was rescued after a long war, Lord Sri Rama had no rest both physically and mentally. During His return from Lanka with Mother Sita, brother Sri Lakshmana and the Great Sri Anjaneya, He relaxed in this place after completing the Shiva Puja in Ramewaram. Seeing Lord tired, Lakshmana took His earlier original Adisesha form and became the bed for Lord to relax. Mother Sita softly massaged His feet. Bharata was counting every minute for Sri Rama’s return and was determined to fall in fire if Lord’s arrival schedule time expires. Though in rest, Sri Rama felt Bharatha’s feelings, asked Sri Anjaneya to inform Bharata of His Home Coming. Hanuman flew faster than wind and saved Bharatha.\n\nAs per another Legend, when Dwapara Yuga ended and Kaliyuga began , with the change of time, peace was disturbed and war and adharma had emerged. At this time, a sage by name Sadamarshana travelled from the north to the south in search of peace. He came to the Pancha Krishna Aranyam forest in the present Thirukovilur area of South India As the place was peaceful surrounded by natural beauty, he sat there and performed severe penance praying to Lord Vishnu,\n\nWith the devotion of the sage who was engaged in penance for a long time, Lord Vishnu appeared before the sage and asked the Maharshi to ask for a boon. The Maharshi said, that he wanted to see the avatars Lord have taken for the benefit of the world The Maharshi was happy when Rama Avataram came and said, For the sake of human beings, you were born on earth as Rama and suffered so much. How many battles have you waged and slaughtered the Asuras? To get rid of all that fatigue, you should rest here and bless the devotees,”\n\nAccordingly Lakshmana took the form of Adisesha and spread a mattress and held an umbrella to serve Perumal, Sita in the form of Sridevi caressing the feet of Lord and Perumal graced the devotees in reclining posture. He then granted the next incarnation to the Maharshi. He appeared as Krishna with Govardhanagiri The Maharshi requested Lord to appear as Jaganmohana Balagopalakrishnan who enchanted the whole universe with their flute and instilled devotional ecstasy. Perumal granted darshan to him in a sitting posture as he prayed for the people of the world. Lord Vishnu graces the devotees as Venugopala with His consorts Bama and Rukmini, as Vaikunta Vaasa Perumal in a sitting form and as Ananthasayana Rama sleeping on Ananthan in reclining posture. Devotees who worship these three forms together will attain all the wealth and salvation\n\nThis Temple has many special features.

Otherwise Continue\n\n3.1 Venugopalaswamy Temple, Movva, Andhra Pradesh\n\nVenugopalaswamy Temple, 6WG7+2RJ, Movva, Andhra Pradesh 521135 Famous Venugopalaswamy Temple is located at Movva, Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh at a distance of 55 Kms from Vijayawada and is the birthplace of the legendary poet and composer Kshetrayya.\n\nAs per the Legend,, once when Krishna was dancing, a bead from his anklet( Muvva) fell upon the earth at this place. He ordered Narada to search for the missing Muvva who whoever could not locate it. When he did severe penance, Vishnu himself appeared at that place in a blinding light, following which he made the murthy of him, and got it installed by Indra himself.\n\nThe Muvva that fell down, was reborn as Moudgalya Rishi,who became a devotee of Krishna. On doing penace to him, he appeared in a Swayambhu sand sculpture form, and the temple was built before dawn. As Vishnu descended here due to Rishi Moudagalya’s penance he was called as Muvva Venu Gopala Swamy, and the village came to be known as Movva. The temple is quite a charming place, with a sculpture of Kshetrayya, and beautiful paintings depicting the life of Krishna, set amidst green paddy fields and coconut groves.\n\nMahakavi Kshetrayya was a 17th century composer, whose real name was Varadayya, and was a devotee of Venugopala Swamy there.Though born in a Brahmin family, Varadayya never showed much interest in learning, and was more attracted towards music and dance. He also learnt Kuchipudi from an acharya. He was attracted towards a Devadasi called Mohanangi, who was known for her intellect and wisdom. She put a condition that she would accept his love, if he were able to compose 4 poems in praise of Venugopala Swamy and impress her. In order to fulfill her condition, Varadayya began to master the language, and as he composed the poems, he came to realize that only Gopala was the Supreme Lord, and gained enlightenment.\n\nAnother version states that Varadayya was an illiterate cowherd, who was taught the Gopala Mantra by a Rishi, and became a great scholar and poet, somewhat like Kalidasa. As he began to tour all the main temples down South, singing the glory of Krishna, as well as describing about those temples, he was called as Kshetragna or Kshetrayya( the one who travels). Along with Tyagayya and Annamayya, Kshetrayya is regarded as one of the 3 great composers and poets in Telugu. He composed around 4000 padams and keertanas, mostly on his Ishta Devata, Venugopala Swamy.\n\nThe padam format perfected by Kshetrayya is used to date. Most of his padams are sung in Kuchipudi, Bharatanatyam recitals. One unique feature is that the anupallavi is sung first, followed by the pallavi, and they center around theme of longing for Krishna. His compositions had Sringara as the main theme, expressing the madhurabhakti, where the relationship between the couple is a metaphor for the Jeeva( usually the Nayaki) to unite with the Divine. He used the signature of Muvva Gopala for his compositions.\n\nHis work has been a major influence in Telugu poetry, dance and music, on par with Annamayya, Tyagayya. Intimately connected with the devadasis of South temples, who interpreted his work through music and dance for a long time. With it’s Venugopala Swamy temple, and it’s association with Mahakavi Kshetrayya, and the picturesque surroundings around it, Movva is one of those places worth a visit, tucked off the beaten track.\n\nThere are separate shrines for Sri Venugopala Swamy and Godadevi in this temple. The temple has the Dasavatarams carved too, and the deity is flanked by his consorts Rukmini, Satyabhama.\n\nFestivals Celebrated : Sri Krishna Janmashtami, Deepavali, Sravana Masam, Dasara, Vaikunta Ekadasi, Vasanthotsavam,Dhanurmasam Timings to visit 05:30 AM – 01:00 PM | 04:00 PM – 08:00 PM\n\nNear by Temples : Mopidevi Sri Subramanya swamy Temple – 20km Hamsaladeevi Sri Venugopala Swamy Temple – 47km, Vijayawada Sri Kanakadurga Temple – 54km, Mangalagiri Panakala Swamy Temple – 66km.\n\n3.2 Thiruvarppu Sri Krishna Temple Kottayam, Kerala\n\nThiruvarppu Sreekrishna Swami Temple, Thiruvarpu, Kerala 686020 Thiruvarppu Sree Krishna Temple is located at Thiruvarpu, Kerala at a distance of 7 kms from Kottayam on the shores of Meenachil River. (Varppu is the cast used by smiths to make bell metal vessels). It is one of the famous temples of Krishna in Kerala which is at least 1500 years old. There are several legends of recovering the idol of Lord Krishna with 4 hands which was kept in an Uruli (Flat vessel made of bell metal).\n\nAs per one legend, when the Pandavas lived in the forest, Lord Krishna gave them his statue with four hands so that they can daily worship it. When Pandavas finished their sojourn in the forest and wanted to go back, the people of that area, requested for that idol. This was worshipped by the people of Cherthalai. But after some time due to reasons beyond their control, they were not able to continue their worship. So they simply dropped the idol in the sea.\n\nAfter a long time a sage was travelling by a boat in these parts. Suddenly his boat became immobile. When some one got in to the sea to find out the reason, the sea dried at that spot and they were able to recover this idol. The sage took the idol with him. Though he wanted to go west, the boat travelled to the east via Kunnam and Pallikkara and reached the present spot of the temple. The sage got down there along with the idol and found that a temple of Dharma Sastha was without any idol and hence he consecrated the idol in that temple.\n\nAs per another legend, the above sage got down from the boat along with the idol but due to inclement weather he was unable to proceed any further. Hence he kept the idol in an Uruli, which he found near the tank and went away. Later when he came back, he found that the idol had got fixed to the Uruli. That Uruli belonged to an individual called Kunnan Kari Menon. As soon as he heard about this incident, he gave the land for temple construction and completed the temple with the help of a saint called Madappurathu Samiyar. Even today special Pushpanjali ( offering of flowers) is done on behalf of the Asram of Madappurathu Samiyar in this temple.\n\nAs per another legend, the Pandavas deposited the idol they were worshipping along with their Akshaya Pathra in the sea, before leaving for their Agnatha Vasa. Some fishermen fishing in the Vembanad back waters at a place near Vechur (called Mangalathu Vila) recovered only the idol but not the vessel. They built a temple in a place called Chara Mangalam and consecrated the idol there. Soon various calamities occurred in their village and hence,they returned the idol to the backwaters. This time the idol fell directly into the original vessel itself. It was then that the divine person referred to earlier recovered the idol as also the vessel.\n\nHis boat travelled via Kunnam and Palikkara and was not able to travel further due to dense aquatic plants. The people of the area swam in to the water and made way for the boat to reach the shores. The idol in the vessel was kept in the shore temporarily in a structure called Valiya Madam. Later the idol was shifted to the present temple.\n\nThe architectural style of the shrine resembles the typical architecture of the temples found in Kerala. The Lord faces west along with his four hands. A peculiarity of this temple is that, the priest is given an axe as well as the key to open the door in the early morning. People believe that this God cannot tolerate hunger and so if there is any delay in opening the door with the key, the priest is permitted to break open the door with an axe.\n\nAnother peculiarity of this temple is that even during eclipse, the temple is not closed. People believe that this God would become hungry. This temple has a very peculiar drum made of bell metal. It is said that Lord Krishna announced the killing of Kamsa, playing on this drum. Another peculiar celebration of this temple is Pullattu Pooja,.\n\n3.3 Bhalka Tirth Temple, Somnath, Gujarat\n\nBhalka Tirth Temple, tirth temple, Bhalka, Veraval, Somnath, Gujarat 362265 Bhalka Tirth Temple is located in Bhalka, Somnath, Gujarat at a distance of 190 Kms from Rajgot and 90 Kms from Junagadh, Gujarat. Bhalka is part of the Lord Krishna circuit (Mathura, Vrindavan, Barsana, Govardhan, Kurukshetra and Dwarka). It is located just 4 KM from Somnath Temple, a Jyotirlinga, situated in Veraval, Gujarat,\n\nBhalka Teerth is one of the most magnificent temples of Somnath city. The temple at Bhalka Teerth is known as Mahaprabhuji’s Bethak, and a tulsi tree has been planted in Lord Krishna’s honour. Banyan trees dot the courtyard of the spectacular Krishna temple that is built in sandstone. Inside the shrine is an unusual idol of Shri Krishna in a semi-reclining position. The temple also contains a beautiful tribhangi idol of Lord Krishna playing his flute.\n\nAs per the Legend, the Kurukshetra war resulted in the death of all the hundred sons of Gandhari. On the night before Duryodhana’s death, Krishna visited Gandhari to offer his condolences. Gandhari felt that Krishna knowingly did not put an end to the war, and in a fit of rage and sorrow, Gandhari cursed that Krishna, along with everyone else from the Yadu dynasty, would perish after 36 years. Krishna himself knew and wanted this to happen as he felt that the Yadavas had become very haughty and arrogant (adharmi), so he ended Gandhari’s speech by saying “tathastu” (so be it).\n\nAfter 36 years passed, a fight broke out between the Yadavas, at a festival, who killed each other. His elder brother, Balarama, left his body through Yoga. Krishna retired into the forest and started meditating under a tree.\n\nThe Mahabharata also narrates the story of a hunter who becomes an instrument for Krishna’s departure from the world. The hunter Jara mistook Krishna’s partly visible left foot for that of a deer, and shot an arrow, mortally wounding him. After Jara realised his mistake, while still bleeding, Krishna told Jara, “O Jara, you were Vali in your previous birth, killed by myself as Rama in Treta Yuga. Here you had a chance to even it and since all acts in this world are done as desired by me, you need not worry for this”. Then Krishna, with his physical body ascended back to his eternal abode, Goloka and this event marks departure of Krishna from the earth.\n\nAccording to Puranic sources,[a] Krishna’s disappearance marks the end of Dvapara Yuga and the start of Kali Yuga, which is dated to 17/18 February 3102 BCE.
