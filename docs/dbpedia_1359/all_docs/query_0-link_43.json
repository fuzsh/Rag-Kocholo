Even when I was searching for Elegant seat covers for a friend's Manza last year, Car Shringar was one (or the only one) authorized seller of Elegant products as per their website.\n\nDistinguished - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Jun 2006\n\nLocation: Speed-brkr City\n\nPosts: 15,979\n\nThanked: 16,251 Times\n\nRe: Seat Covers: Imperial INC (Bangalore)\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by McLaren Rulez\n\nDo these guys or anyone else in Bangalore do fabric seat covers?

I have Elegant seat covers in my Storme, 5 years now.\n\nYou can check the designs on their website Elegantauto.in. Many accessories shops here have samples. If you select a design, you could even ask the accessories shops in Mys to get it for you ( they are manufactured in their Uttrakhand factory. Only the fitting is here).\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Nov 2004\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 129\n\nThanked: 241 Times\n\nRe: Seat Covers: Imperial INC (Bangalore)\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by cool_dube\n\nHello all,\n\nI need to get good quality steering cover (leather) for 2 of my cars.

One question though, how to they fit the seat covers?many makers glue it to the seat or put a stitching in the seat to hold the seat cover. I am strictly against any sort of damage or alteration to the OEM seats.\n\nLast edited by adutta2k : 4th November 2018 at 16:14.\n\nDistinguished - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2013\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 1,817\n\nThanked: 5,573 Times\n\nRe: Seat Covers: Imperial INC (Bangalore)\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by drive2eternity\n\nThe quailty to price ratio has left me impressed.

My TUV seat covers still look great and apart from some very minute fraying at the edge of the driver seat, everything else is fabulous. Even the steering grip feels very good and its been almost 3 years.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by adutta2k\n\nstrictly against any sort of damage or alteration to the OEM seats.\n\nI would suggest you stay away from imperial in that case. Please check this post for more details of the process. They strip away the OEM cover and only then \"suit up\" your seats. They dont use anything to piece or damage the seats as the covers are all tight fit and only need minimal stitching/pinching from the outside. Would suggest you talk to shiva, go there and take a look at how it's done before you invest.\n\nDisclaimer: not in any way associated with Imperial leathers."
