        "text": "Pushpaka Vimana (transl. The Flower Chariot) is a 1987 Indian comedy film written and directed by Singeetam Srinivasa Rao, who co-produced it with Kannada actor Shringar Nagaraj. The film, which has no dialogue, stars Kamal Haasan, Amala and Tinnu Anand with Sameer Khakhar, K. S. Ramesh, Loknath, Pratap K. Pothen, P. L. Narayana, Farida Jalal and Ramya in supporting roles. It revolves around an unemployed graduate who encounters a drunk millionaire unconscious and takes over his lifestyle after keeping him prisoner. However, he does not realise the dangers he has brought upon himself because a hired hitman believes him to be his target.\n\nRao's desire to make a dialogue-less film came when he was working as an assistant director in a film where a character had to emote fear without dialogue in a scene. Once the idea for Pushpaka Vimana materialised, Rao wrote the screenplay within two weeks. The film was the only one produced by Nagaraj. Due to the lack of dialogue, Rao was able to cast actors from different parts of India. Cinematography was handled by B. C. Gowrishankar, editing by D. Vasu, art direction by Thota Tharani and the background score was composed by L. Vaidyanathan. The film was shot in Bangalore."
