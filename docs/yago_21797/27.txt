The French singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg , who died in 1991 , contained multitudes. He wrote and performed melodic ditties in a variety of subgenres, with lyrics full of provocative wordplay. His contrary nature and his alcoholism fueled bad behavior, like when he drunkenly propositioned Whitney Houston on French television.

His first film as a director, “ Je T’Aime Moi Non Plus ” in 1976, debuts in New York in a new restoration this week. It shares its title — roughly translated to “I Love You, Me Neither” — with one of Gainsbourg’s most famous (if not best) hits. Its premise is a tad out of left field, even for him.

Set in a near-desert region dressed to look like a De Chirico vision of the American West, it features Joe Dallesandro — fairly fresh off his long stint as a Warhol Factory hunk — as Krassky (nicknamed Krass), a garbage hauler who tools around with his lover Padovan, a lunk who likes to carry an empty plastic bag around with him.

Gainsbourg, like Prince after him, came from music to filmmaking with a strong cinematic sense. Save for some silly whip-panning in a sequence leading up to an auto accident, he doesn’t put a foot wrong. His style is languorous, though, and while the movie is peppered with raw humor, he’s serious to a fault in depicting his couple’s predicament. The picture, praised at the time of its French release by no less a titan than François Truffaut , is not for everybody. But it’s genuinely, eccentrically Gainsbourgian.
