        "text": "No. 2 is the second studio album by Serge Gainsbourg, originally released in 1959. It features Gainsbourg backed by the Alain Goraguer Orchestra. Definitely a mutant jazz-pop album with a strong chansonnier feel and a touch of French literature. The album cover is a reference to French author and musician Boris Vian.\n\nAnother side of Serge Gainsbourg permeates this 1963 film soundtrack about \"a stripper lost in the nocturnal world\" of Paris, according to director Jacques Poitrenaud, who cast Nico in the lead role (after her appearance in La Dolce Vita and just prior to the single she cut with Jimmy Page for Andrew Loog Oldham). Created by Gainsbourg with arranger and longstanding collaborator Alain Gourager, the music is fittingly the cool jazz of dingy nightclubs and seedy bordellos, with Gainsbourg on piano, and there's the sultry title track, delivered breathlessly by Juliette Greco. Another lost gem for all serious Gainsbourg fans."
