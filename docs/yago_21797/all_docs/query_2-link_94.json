        "text": "Last year I inaugurated a brand new tradition here at Lemuria Press, a glorious presentation of video clips featuring my artistic hero and personal Jesus, Serge Gainsbourg.\n\nYou see, I don't really believe in the son-of-God Jesus (or God himself, for that matter), but reverence is important in life, and it's good to have heroes to look up to. Sometimes those heroes are drunken geniuses bent on a decades-long streak of self-destruction from cigarettes and alcohol, but no one is perfect (particularly, it must be said, if they are French).\n\nSo, once again and in the spirit of the holiday season I present a handful of awesome clips featuring my favorite Tainted Saint, Mr. Serge Gainsbourg.\n\nFirst up I give you the title track from Gainsbourg's undisputed masterpiece, Histoire de Melody Nelson. In case your relatives had the poor foresight not to purchase this for you for Christmas, head on over to Amazon.com and pick it up yourself with some of that mad Jesus money they gave you instead. Here's why:\n\nThat song has played on my iPod more than 100 times, and will be the lead track on the CD I'll have handed out at my funeral. Melody Nelson is about a middle-aged French guy who accidentally hits a 14-year-old English girl with his Rolls Royce. He takes her unconscious body back to his place and nurses her back to health after which they fall in love, have sex, and live happily ever after (until Melody dies in a plane crash headed back to England). Gainsbourg is not going to win any humanitarian awards, but Histoire de Melody Nelson is probably the greatest concept album ever recorded. You owe it to yourself to pick it up. While listening, have a cigarette on me. It's not good for you, but neither is shacking up with 14-year-olds, so I suggest just going with the flow.\n\nNow, if you've never heard of him you might think 'what a dick.\" And, honestly, you'd pretty much be correct in that assessment. Even Serge himself thought so, and here's a great tune he whipped out for a shitty movie that proves it. The song is called \"Requiem pour un Con,\" which roughly translates to \"requiem for an asshole.\" It's one of my favorites, and it's too bad the movie only used a verse or so and the clip is so short. Still, it's got all the brilliance of Gainsbourg wrapped up into one brief clip:\n\nTimeless. Gainsbourg's best music was recorded 30–40 years ago, but it sounds like it could have been recorded yesterday. I am utterly entranced by it, and own more than 180 of his songs. Actually, thanks to some wonderful gifts from my friends and family this Christmas, I added 30 new songs I've never heard before. It's going to be a good music listening month for me.\n\nGainsbourg was always on the cutting edge of music. He started as a cabaret pianist in the tradition of his father, and released a couple albums of straight up (but utterly brilliant) songs in the old French chanson style. Shortly thereafter, Serge discovered jazz, then rock, then reggae, and even had a fairly regrettable dalliance with early rap at the very end of his career. In the 60s, rock-and-roll swept France thanks mostly to the Beatles, and a new form of music called ye-ye developed, often using English and American rhythms and even lyrics mixed in with a distinctly French character. Not one to be daunted, Gainsbourg jumped into this new music, writing top hits for a number of young ingenues including France Gall, Brigitte Bardot, and others. Here's a song from that era, appropriately titled \"Chez les Ye-Ye.\"\n\nAnd here's one of his famous collaborations with Brigitte Bardot. What strikes me about this one is that it sounds like it could have been released last week. Dig the sweet sci-fi costumes!\n\nGainsbourg and Bardot hooked up for a while, but his most famous love was Jane Birkin, the English actress who played Melody Nelson and who sang along on the first clip of this Christmas post. The two created a lot of great music together, but perhaps one of their best creations was their daughter, Charlotte Gainsbourg, who is currently a huge film star in France and who's had some success in movies that have played in America (most recently in Michel Gondry's phantasmagoric The Science of Sleep. Charlotte looks almost exactly like a combination of Serge and Jane, which of course she is. Serge drank himself to death in the 80s (but not before telling Whitney Houston \"I want to fuck you\" on live TV), but Jane is carrying on his tradition. Her newest album, 5:55, is like a collision ground of Erik Mona influences. The music is by French supergroup Air, and the lyrics are by British pop-god Jarvis Cocker. The result is my pick for the best album of 2007. Here's Serge's daughter in the title track of that album, \"5:55\":\n\nAnd that's it for this year's Serge Gainsbourg Christmas spectacular. I'm off to listen to my 200+ song Gainsbourg collection. Perhaps I'll finish by the first day of 2008.\n\nOne thing's for sure. On New Year's Eve, I'll be raising a glass to my Tainted Saint, Mr. Serge Gainsbourg.\n\nBravo!\n\nPost A Comment | 4 Comments | Share | Flag | Link\n\nI LOVE the Bardot song.\n\nReply | Thread | Link\n\nCool. Bardot is great.\n\nAs a reward for your good taste, here are four more Gainsbourg/Bardot collaborations from that same album:\n\nInitials B.B./Docteur Jeckyl\n\nBonnie and Clyde\n\nComic Strip\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\nEdited at 2007-12-26 08:00 am (UTC)\n\nReply | Parent | Thread | Link\n\nI think Shane McGowan is to me as Serge Gainsbourg is to you. The beauty of the Pogues is I don't have to translate from mumbled French ;)\n\nReply | Thread | Link\n\nI love the idea of a Christmas Gainsbourg spectacular (although it's well past Christmas now).\n\nSo now that it rapidly approaches 2008, did you finish? :)\n\nReply | Thread | Link"
