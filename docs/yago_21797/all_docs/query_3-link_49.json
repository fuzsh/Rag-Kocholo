        "text": "In 1969, Serge Gainsbourg released what would become one of his most famous songs: Je t'aime, moi non plus (“I love you, me neither”), complete with breathy, orgasm-simulation vocal from his then wife, Jane Birkin.\n\nSeven years later, in 1976, the music returned, accompanied by a film of the same name. It was Gainsbourg’s feature debut, a love letter to nihilism that was to tackle a whole new taboo: anal sex!\n\nBirkin plays gamine truck stop diner waitress Johnny, whose chance encounter with a gay couple, Krassky (Joe Dallesandro) and Padovan (Hugues Quester), leads to a surprising turn of events when Krassky, despite realizing that his first impressions were wrong and Johnny is a girl, decides to spark up a relationship with her anyway.\n\nJe t'aime, moi non plus may be misogynistic, deliberately shocking, and iconoclastic, but, like most of Gainsbourg's works, it is also full of poetry.\n\nShown with At the Beach (La Plage) by Keren Ben Rafael"
