        "text": "\"Je t'aime moi non plus\" synopsis\n\nKlaski, a Polish man who makes a living collecting trash with a truck, and Padovan, an Italian. The two had a strong bond that was more than just work colleagues. One day, at a cafe and bar, the two meet Johnny, a boyish girl with a short haircut that could be mistaken for a boy. Although she rebels against her hard-drinking and power-harassed husband, she works with nowhere else to go. That night, Klasky and Johnny hit it off at a dance party. However, Klasky was actually gay. Still, the two are attracted to each other, and their bodies overlap...\n\nIndex\n\nDeactivation of nationality\n\nGender invalidation\n\nThe end of chaos and jealousy\n\nDeactivation of nationality\n\n\"The location could be America, France, Italy, or anywhere else. A surreal and non-comic relationship in a black and white world. Two unusual people live a fleeting, abnormal love.\" (Scenario by Serge Gainsbourg) Explanation*)\n\nA yellow truck drives through a rural landscape. On the front of the truck is a plate of an American vintage blonde woman. The passengers are Klasky and Patvan. gay couple. A crow suddenly swooped into view and covered the windshield in blood. “Ominous,” one man mutters. The man gets out of the car and throws the crow's carcass into the air. Da-da-da-da-da-da-da! ! ! . Imitation of gunshot sounds. A man randomly shoots dead crows that have been washed ashore.\n\nWhen ``Je t'aime moi non plus'' is released, François Truffaut sends an passionate Arrival to radio listeners. \"You don't have to watch my movie. Go see Serge's movie!\"\n\n\"Je t'aime moi non plus\" trailer\n\n``Je t'aime moi non plus'' does not belong anywhere in French cinema. Willy Krant, who has worked as the cameraman for historical masterpieces such as Jean-Luc Godard's `` Mandes and Women '' (66) and Jerzy Skolimowski's `` Departure '' (67), is the cameraman for this film. , his style carefully avoids any influence from the Nouvelle Vague. Rather, his style is closer to the look of American New Cinema that the short film ``Bonnie and Clyde,'' starring Serge Gainsbourg and Brigitte Bardot, evoked. However, the roughness of American New Cinema is sophisticated in the Gainsbourg style, and the screen is clothed in elegant colors.\n\nAlso, the fact that Joe D'Alessandro, known for Andy Warhol's underground films, has been selected as the lead role suggests a connection with the New York underground, but according to lead actress Jane Birkin, Serge Gainsbourg was Andy Warhol's -He didn't even know Warhol's films existed.\n\nAs the beautiful melody of Serge Gainsbourg 's classic `` The Ballad of Johnny Jane '' repeats, a Polish and Italian gay couple, unsure of where they came from or where they are going, meet the heroine played by Jane Birkin. . A truck transporting urban garbage. This is the city's garbage dump. According to the heroine, life in the countryside is ``so boring it's the best''. The back of the American-style diner where Jane Birkin works is a brothel, and a rock band acts as a striptease act. ``Je t'aime moi non plus'' nullifies the attributes of nationality in advance due to its stage and setting."
