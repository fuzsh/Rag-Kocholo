        "text": "THE young Serge Gainsbourg is sauntering through Occupied Paris when he pauses before an anti-Semitic poster. In a moment its hideously caricatured Jewish face jumps off the wall to chase him down the street.\n\nThis scene, some five minutes into Joann Sfar’s “Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life,” signals that the movie, opening Wednesday at Film Forum, won’t be your standard biopic. But then Mr. Gainsbourg, who died in 1991, is not your standard biopic subject.\n\nHe is best remembered in the United States, if at all, for “Je T’Aime ... Moi Non Plus,” recorded in 1969 with his girlfriend, the British actress Jane Birkin. But in France he is a towering culture hero whose American equivalent is impossible to conjure: a chain-smoking, alcohol-fueled singer-songwriter with the musical importance of Bob Dylan, the literary reach of Leonard Cohen, a chain of romantic conquests to rival Warren Beatty’s and the smutty, provocative persona of Howard Stern.\n\nThe movie, which won a César (the French equivalent of an Oscar) for best first film, touches on all these facets, taking Mr. Gainsbourg from his encounter with the Nazi poster through the 1980s, by which time he has made love to several famous and beautiful women, had a heart attack, incited several controversies and fathered two children (the actress Charlotte and the musician Lulu). These events are accompanied by his increasingly eclectic pop songs and punctuated by regular visits from the Mug, a sinister-looking alter ego who offers assistance, advice and now and then a little shove in the wrong direction."
