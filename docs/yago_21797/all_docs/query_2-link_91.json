        "text": "Lucien Gainsbourg, alias LULU GAINSBOURG, was born on January 5, 1986. Son of Serge Gainsbourg and Bambou (model and singer) and brother of Charlotte Gainsbourg (famous actress and singer), Lulu became famous very quickly. Lulu started piano when he was five years old, and started going to the Music Conservatory of Paris at the age of eight. Aged 15, Lulu recorded a duet with his mother Bambou of a song called “Ne Dis Rien” (written, composed, and sung by his father Serge Gainsbourg). Aged 16, Lulu made his first steps as an actor in the movie La Bande Du Drugstore (aka Dandy in English), released in February 2002.\n\nAfter spending one year in London, Lulu came back to Paris to participate in a tribute concert to Serge Gainsbourg, where he played a Beethoven piece (June 2007). In January 2009, Lulu composed a song for Marc Lavoine, a French singer and actor. He also participated on his sister’s second album (in collaboration with Beck). Since the fall 2007, he has been studying film scoring and contemporary writing and production at Berklee College of Music in order to follow in his father’s footsteps."
