In 1969, Serge Gainsbourg released what would become one of his most famous songs: Je t'aime, moi non plus (“I love you, me neither”), complete with breathy, orgasm-simulation vocal from his then wife, Jane Birkin.

Seven years later, in 1976, the music returned, accompanied by a film of the same name. It was Gainsbourg’s feature debut, a love letter to nihilism that was to tackle a whole new taboo: anal sex!

Birkin plays gamine truck stop diner waitress Johnny, whose chance encounter with a gay couple, Krassky (Joe Dallesandro) and Padovan (Hugues Quester), leads to a surprising turn of events when Krassky, despite realizing that his first impressions were wrong and Johnny is a girl, decides to spark up a relationship with her anyway.

Je t'aime, moi non plus may be misogynistic, deliberately shocking, and iconoclastic, but, like most of Gainsbourg's works, it is also full of poetry.
