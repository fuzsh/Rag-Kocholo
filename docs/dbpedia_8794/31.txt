History

Violet Light is one of the few un-fought Light Monsters. After the Prism Lights were freed by Steven, Violet Light ended up in the Strawberry Fields. It runs up to the Gems and starts speaking to Steven. Instead of putting up a fight, the Gems merely absorb it into the Light Prism, much to Steven's displeasure.
