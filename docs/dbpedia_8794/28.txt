Today on my way from Madison, WI, USA to Minneapolis, MN, USA on highway I94 I saw sky light up with violet color. Timestamp on my picture is at 6:48 PM. It's very strange. I do not think it was northern lights, too soon to hop on alien story. I know this could be due to some lights, but it was so bright and spread across such a large area, its stuck in my head. I am attaching pictures. Not very good quality as I was driving.

Let me know if you guys have any guesses.
