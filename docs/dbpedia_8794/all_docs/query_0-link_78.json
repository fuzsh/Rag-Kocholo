        "text": "Street lights are an essential aspect of urban landscapes, providing safety and visibility during the night. We are all familiar with the common yellow, white, and sometimes green or blue street lights that line our city streets.

Cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and New York have experimented with purple illumination in specific neighborhoods and cultural districts. The aim is to create a unique sense of identity and promote tourism in these areas.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates: The UAE is known for its lavish and extravagant architectural designs.
