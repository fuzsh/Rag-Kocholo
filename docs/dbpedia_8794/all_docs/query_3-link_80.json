        "text": "How to use the cleansing power of the Violet Flame to transform your life\n\nI am writing this short article to all the spiritual seekers out there that are looking for new options on how to overcome life’s challenges, tools for clearing mind and spirit or just reconnecting with the Creator. I would like to share how meditating on the violet flame may be an option for you!\n\nI discovered the teachings of the ascended masters back in the late eighties at a time when I felt that the explanations I was getting from my faith were incomplete. I searched for many years until one day my boss lend me a book he found at an airport bookstore and wanted me to check it out. This book was called The Human Aura by Elizabeth Clare Prophet and the masters Kuthumi and Djwal Kul. The experience of reading this book was magical and electrifying; it opened the doors to teachings I never knew exist, so when I saw a little white card inside the book asking for feedback I knew I had to fill it and mail it. To my surprise, a couple of weeks later I received information from The Summit Lighthouse that introduced me to the masters, their teaching and …the violet flame.\n\n(I never returned that book to my boss, I went and bought a new one and gave it to him. I always have this first book in a place I can see it as a reminder of where my quest began.)\n\nWhat is the Violet Flame?\n\nThe violet flame is one of the aspects of the Holy Spirit[i]. This fire is an invisible source of energy that helps clean our body, mind and soul from any accumulated negative energy. It also serves as a way to reconnect our awareness with God.\n\nWhy a flame?\n\nA flame is the visible, gaseous part of a fire and it is not easy to describe in simple terms other than we can see it, we can feel it and that its benefits to mankind are many.[ii] On the other hand a flame can also be destructive if we lose control of it. The violet flame is an invisible spiritual fire energy that acts in the physical world for purification.[iii]\n\nThe concept of a flame or fire is part of the spiritual teachings in many world religions. For example, in the Judeo-Christian scriptures, God is often described in the Bible as fire. Remember when God showed Himself to Moses in a bush as a flame of fire[iv], or when Paul wrote in his letter to the Thessalonians telling them that they will have relief when Jesus is revealed from heaven in a flame of fire?[v]\n\nWe could also say that there is something intrinsically divine when we visualize a flame in quiet meditation, it brings thoughts of light, peace and purification. Therefore, as we explore more how the Holy Spirit extends its presence through the violet flame, we get to understand how God reaches out to us with this gift for the purification of the soul.\n\nIs it new?\n\nThe online article “The Secret of the Violet Fame” states that the use of the violet flame is not new. Through history “Saints and adepts of East and West have long used the spiritual energy of the violet flame to accelerate their spiritual development. Some experienced the secret flame itself, and some knew of it as the power of God’s mercy to change hearts and the world around them.”[vi] The article adds that the term of violet flame/violet fire was not widely known or openly used until the 1930s when the teaching was given to Guy Ballard, also known as the author Godfre Ray King, and later continued to be taught through the messengers Mark L. Prophet and Elizabeth Clare Prophet.\n\nIs there any science in the concept of the Violet Flame?\n\nFor those who are scientific minded like me, some context on how the violet flame works is always helpful. Think of this flame as a manifestation of light and part of the different degrees of vibration that exist within the light spectrum:\n\n“In our physical world, the violet light is the shortest wavelength of light and therefore, the highest frequency in the physical spectrum. Since frequency is directly proportional to energy, the violet light also has the most energy! That means, it has the greatest ability to change matter at the atomic level.”[vii]\n\nHence, this flame works at the atomic level removing negative energy within our body:\n\n“When you call for the violet flame, it sets up a polarity between the nucleus of the atom and the white fire core of the flame. The nucleus, being from matter, assumes the negative pole and the white fire core of the violet flame, being Spirit, assumes the positive pole. This interaction sets up an oscillation, a vibration that dislodges the density.\n\nOn contact with the violet flame, this dense substance is cleansed, purified, and restored to its native purity. The electrons begin to move freely again and raise our whole vibration and our energy level.”[viii]\n\nWhy should we use the Violet Flame Meditation?\n\nThe ascended master Saint Germain sponsors this teaching on the use of the science of the violet flame. His goal is to bring enlightenment, soul liberation and healing to mankind.[ix]\n\nHe teaches that when we use violet flame decrees we command the flow of energy to move from spirit to matter and engage this energy within our body. During this process we also reestablish our connection with God.[x]\n\nThe violet flame meditation incorporates devotional prayers, violet flame decrees, hymns, invocations and visualizations, that when practiced daily it can help us to get the following benefits[xi]:\n\nConnection with God\n\nRevitalization of the body\n\nHealing of emotional and physical problems\n\nImprovement in relationships\n\nThe change negative energy into positive energy\n\nMeditation:\n\nLet’s close our eyes and feel the warmth of the violet fire surrounding our body, cleaning and dissolving as we meditate using the following YouTube video. Feel the company of this Holy Brother, Saint Germain, as he holds our hand:\n\nViolet Flame Meditation: https://youtu.be/3mVOKzv2eYQ\n\nFor more information also check:\n\n· Violet Flame web page: https://www.violetflame.com/\n\n· Violet Flame booklet: Violet Flame to Heal Body, Mind & Soul by Elizabeth Clare Prophet\n\n· Summit Lighthouse, the website with the teachings of the ascended masters through the messengers Mark L.
