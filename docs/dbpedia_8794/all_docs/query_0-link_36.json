Depending on the temperature during production, the hue of cobalt phosphate varies from more reddish to more violet. This cobalt violet is the clearest available, transparent light violet. It is similar to our discontinued Cobalt Violet (#45820), but the pigment is slightly more granular.\n\nThe pigment is suitable for watercolor, but should be used immediately after mixing the paint. Cobalt violet also works well in tempera and in almost all acrylic dispersions, except Dispersion K 9 (#75367). We do not recommend this cobalt violet for oil paints due to its extremely slow drying.\n\nDownloads\n\nDetails 45821e.pdf\n\nChemical description: Pigment Violet 14, C.I. 77360\n\nLightfastness - thinned: 8 (1 is bad, 8 is best)\n\nLightfastness - medium: 8 (1 is bad, 8 is best)\n\nLightfastness - concentrated: 8 (1 is bad, 8 is best)\n\nColorIndex: PV 14.77360\n\nOpacity: transparent\n\nSuitability: Acrylics, Tempera, Watercolor / Gouache\n\nColors: Violet\n\nForms: powder\n\nSolubility in water: practically insoluble\n\nFor which application / techniques is Cobalt Violet, light suitable?\n\nCobalt Violet, light is suitable for Acrylics, Tempera, Watercolor / Gouache\n\nWhat color has Cobalt Violet, light?\n\nCobalt Violet, light has the color Violet.\n\nWhat Colorindex has Cobalt Violet, light?\n\nCobalt Violet, light has the Colorindex PV 14.77360.\n\nHow lightfast is Cobalt Violet, light?\n\nCobalt Violet, light has the lightfastness thinned = 8, medium = 8, concentrated = 8 (1 is bad, 8 is best).\n\nQuestions about Cobalt Violet, light?\n\nCustomers who bought this product also bought"
