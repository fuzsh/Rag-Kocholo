        "text": "Driving around the county, you may be seeing purple street lights. If so, do they mean Halloween is approaching? Are they in honor of the Ravens? Does this have something to do with COVID??\n\nNone of the above!\n\nBGE, states that due to a manufacturer defect, some LED street lights may have a malfunction causing the lights to gradually turn purple or blue.\n\nYou can help BGE replace these by reporting these lights as an outage at:\n\nhttps://bge.streetlightoutages.com/public/default.html\n\nTo report problems with existing streetlights, please call BGE directly at 1-800-685-0123 or use BGE's online reporting form."
