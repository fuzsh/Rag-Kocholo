        "text": "In Denver when it comes to improving indoor quality in homes, the team at Brothers Plumbing, Heating & Electric can help you see the light. Denver commercial ultraviolet light eliminates airborne particles and germs passing through the lamp, by breaking them down using high energy light waves. This makes sure they don’t survive in your duct system and move into your home’s air. The shortwave lights, like those found in hospitals, pharmacies, and professional kitchens have been used for nearly 50 years.\n\nLong Lasting Ultra Violet Lights in Denver\n\nOur ultra violet lamps in Denver have long lives and are simple and easy to replace when the time comes. Brothers Plumbing, Heating & Electric offers outstanding service on all bands, makes and models of Denver residential ultraviolet lights. We can install any brand of your choice, but we always recommend the Dynamic brand!\n\nWhen You Need a Denver Ultra Violet Light Replacement"
