The Violet Glow in Velvet Skies\n7. Somewhere Beyond Time\n8. Far Across the Coastal Plain\n9. The Hills of Appalachia (reprise)\n\nEvan Hirsh has been releasing music as Violet Light on soundcloud since 2016, but mainly for personal enjoyment and without any official release. over 3 years ago now I contacted Evan about making a compilation of my favorites, but it took some time to unearth the originals. Finally we&#39;re here and I think it was worth the wait.\r\n\r\nEvan is a geologist and spent much of the last few years in the Sonoran desert. You can pick up on this from the titles and gentle field recordings, conjuring scenes of sweeping sands at dusk. The minimal, low-volume drones capture the peaceful majesty and fading light.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy it!",
