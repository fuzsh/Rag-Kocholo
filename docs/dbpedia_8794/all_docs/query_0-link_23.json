        "text": "Some Milwaukee drivers have noticed that streetlights along the interstate have recently taken on a distinctive purple hue.\n\nIt's not on purpose — a technical issue caused the 3-year-old LED lights to change colors.\n\nThe state Department of Transportation installed a batch of LED lights in 2018 as part of a wide-scale conversion of Milwaukee's streetlights led by the Department of Public Works in an effort to save energy costs.\n\nIn March, hundreds of the lights — mostly in the southeast region — began changing color from white to purple because of a technical glitch in the bulb.\n\nMichael Pyritz, regional communications manager for the DOT's southeast region, said the manufacturer who supplied the lights, American Electric Lighting, will be replacing the lights and compensating the department.\n\n\"We are not going to a purple-hued street lighting plan,\" Pyritz said. \"I didn't imagine that anybody was going to become that attached to them.\"\n\nThe replacement lights will again be bright white to \"safely light our interstate system,\" he said.\n\nPyritz said the department estimates around 300 lights have changed color.\n\nPyritz told the Journal Sentinel in September that the department will need an additional 10 weeks to replace the lights, meaning crews will have to battle December weather in order to replace the lights.\n\n\"It is a lot of fixtures. There is also time built in to allow for inclement weather conditions,\" wrote Pyritz in an email.\n\nMany communities around the country are experiencing the purple light effect, including Eau Claire and cities in Kansas, South Carolina, Illinois and Florida.\n\nDuke Energy, which installed the lights in some other regions, said there are likely thousands of LED lights installed throughout the country that will turn purple.\n\nReporter Grace McDermott contributed to this article."
