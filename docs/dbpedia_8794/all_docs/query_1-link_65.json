In 2016, the SunWise Program was integrated into the programs run by the National Environmental Education Foundation (NEEF). NEEF’s SunWise program is a free environmental and health education program to teach K-8 children about sun safety, UV radiation, and stratospheric ozone.\n\nSun Safety\n\nThis webpage lists historical information about the SunWise program, as well as links to additional sun safety resources.\n\nUV Index\n\nThis webpage shows frequently asked questions about the UV Index and provides maps of current and predicted UV levels in the United States.\n\nSunWise\n\nNational Environmental Education Foundation (NEEF)\n\nThis webpage provides links to resources and information related to sun protection and safety measures.\n\nU.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service\n\nThe National Weather Services’ UV Index predicts the next day's UV radiation levels on a 1 to 11+ scale. This information helps people plan how to protect themselves from the sun.\n\nCurrent UV Index Forecast (updated daily)\n\nThis webpage provides daily UV Index data in both map and text form for major cities in the United States.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO)\n\nThe United States and Canada adopted the WHO revised UV Index guidelines and applied them to their current UV Indices in 2004.\n\nGlobal Solar UV Index: A Practical Guide (PDF) (18 pp, 412 K, About PDF)\n\nThis guide details global solar UV Index issues, sun protection messages and educational concepts.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\n\nThe FDA sets rules for the product labeling and advertising of sunscreens. The FDA ensures that the sun Protection Factor (SPF) for sunscreen is clearly written on its label and that consumers can easily understand the labelling and instructions."
