You may be looking for another Light Monster.\n\nThe Violet Light (title presumed from dialogue, not official) is one of the Lights released by the Light Prism in Attack the Light.\n\nAppearance\n\nViolet Light has a simple and blocky appearance, having a rectangular body and being magenta with squared shape white glowing eyes.\n\nHistory\n\nViolet Light is one of the few un-fought Light Monsters. After the Prism Lights were freed by Steven, Violet Light ended up in the Strawberry Fields. It runs up to the Gems and starts speaking to Steven. Instead of putting up a fight, the Gems merely absorb it into the Light Prism, much to Steven's displeasure.\n\nLight Army"
