        "text": "”Violet”, and “Purple” are the terms most artists apply to the true, scientific, secondary color, “Blue”.\n\nFor example, get someone with a color densitometer to plot the exact location of Dioxazine Purple on a color wheel. You will see that it plots very near the “Blue spoke” of the color wheel–and MUCH closer to that location than any colors having “Blue-someting-or-other” in their names.:D\n\nWell, actually…..here’s a plot that I did of several of my paints, using a color densitometer (I used to do this for a vocation.):\n\n[IMG]http://s3.amazonaws.com/wetcanvas-hdc/Community/images/10-May-2015/13079-LTF_Circle_W_Colors_Callouts.jpg[/IMG]\n\nMagenta is a primary color, and it represents equal reflectance of Red, and Blue light, while it absorbs Green. (The white light spectrum includes equal reflectance of Red, Green, and Blue light.)\n\nBut, the naming of colors is just pure semantics. Blue is a secondary color that exhibits specific characteristics, and attributes. It makes no difference whether one prefers to call it, “Blue”, “Purple”, or “Violet”–it will behave as scientific Blue. And, it will continue to behave as such, even should you prefer to call it, “George”, or “Frank”. And, merely calling a color, “Blue” does not automatically mean that it will behave in the manner of Blue. Calling a horse a chicken, does not endow it with the characteristic that allows it to lay eggs.;)"
