        "text": "A History of the Violet Flame\n\nThe violet flame was known and used in ancient times during the advanced civilizations of Atlantis and Lemuria. It was used by priests and priestesses of the sacred fire and by divine alchemists in the secret chambers of the temples. Many studied the violet flame in the temples of Atlantis and the knew the efficacy of this flame in healing the body and changing world conditions.\n\nAfter the sinking of these continents through cataclysm, which was the result of mankind’s misuse of divine energy, the violet flame was only revealed to mankind in the etheric retreats of the heaven-world. Advanced souls could journey to the retreats in soul travel during sleep and receive instruction on the violet flame in the way of initiation. Jesus, for example, learned of the violet flame and imparted that knowledge to his disciple John the Beloved. Today, these retreats still exist on the etheric plane of earth and we can visit them in our etheric bodies. (see below.)\n\nWhat changed, however, was that right around the 1930s, the recently ascended master Saint Germain, whose final lifetime was that of the “wonderman of Europe,” pledged his spiritual attainment as collateral for mankind to receive an outer conscious awareness of the violet flame. Saint Germain chose to sponsor the revelation of this divine energy to mankind that we might experiment with the alchemy of self-transformation through the sacred fire. Thus began the activities of the I AM Movement and the many releases of teachings on the violet transmuting flame. Teachings on the violet flame continued through the Bridge to Freedom dispensation, as well as through The Summit Lighthouse.\n\nToday, there are at least a million souls, who either on inner or outer levels, are fully aware of the violet flame or have the equivalent of the violet flame, even though they do not have a name for it. Some call it the violet light. They see that light, they are attracted to it, and they attract it to their auras.\n\nEtheric Retreats that Focus the Violet Flame\n\nVisit these violet flame retreats on the etheric plane in your soul consciousness while you sleep at night. You can learn more about etheric soul travel here.\n\nRetreat of the Violet Flame Archangels\n\nRetreat of the Elohim of the Violet Flame\n\nRetreat of the Cave of Symbols\n\nRetreat of the Maltese Cross\n\nRetreat of Divine Mercy\n\nRetreat for Justice and Opportunity\n\nRetreat of the Violet Flame Cathedral"
