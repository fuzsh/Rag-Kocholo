        "text": "The Many Meanings of Violet / Purple\n\nThe Meanings of Violet, or what is also referred to as Purple are closely linked with our subconscious thoughts of royalty and spirituality. Remember that the meanings of violet or any other color are cultural and psychological. It’s not an exact science but interesting all the same.\n\nA pure Violet or Purple hue is a Secondary Color. It’s a blending of a warm Red and cool Blue on the Basic Color Wheel.\n\nBecause it’s a mixture of two colors, violet containing more Red will be warmer, brighter and more intense. It will tend to create color meanings more closely associated with Red. And of course the meanings of violet containing more Blue will naturally have more of the cool, calming color symbolism of Blue.\n\nViolet / Purple is the hardest color for the eye to discriminate. That’s because it has the shortest wavelength in the light spectrum.The next shortest wavelength is Ultraviolet which is invisible to the naked eye. Even people who work with color daily and are finely tuned to their nuances find it difficult to tell Red / Violet from Blue / Violet at times.\n\nMen are generally more attracted to darker, rich Violets which lean toward Blue. On the other hand, when red or lots of white is added to Violet / Purple to create Lavender or Mauve Pastel, the effect is ultra-feminine. The meanings of violet can be quite different depending on whether they lean toward blue or red.\n\nIn my paint swatches above you can see how Violet, a Secondary Color can be varied by adding more Blue or more Red. Each one of these swatches is still called Violet or Purple even though they’ve been altered quite a bit.\n\nBecause the subconscious meanings of violet can be polar opposites depending upon the strength of either the Red or Blue. You may want to clearly emphasize either the cool side or warm side of this hue. In other words, stress the cool with more blue or warm with more red. The ambiguous middle can create a sense of unrest or unease when it’s the dominant color.\n\nWhen choosing color schemes be careful. Too much Purple / Violet can be overpowering and cause a moody sense of disquiet.\n\nPositive Meanings of Violet / Purple\n\nSpirituality, Faith\n\nMagic, Mysticism\n\nCeremony, Ritual\n\nUnconscious, Subconscious\n\nCreativity, Inspiration\n\nImagination, Awareness\n\nPassion, Sensitivity\n\nCalming, Contemplative\n\nBravery, Courage\n\nWealth, Opulence\n\nLuxury, Nobility\n\nAristocracy, Royalty\n\nNegative Meanings of Violet / Purple\n\nConceit, Pomposity\n\nDeath, Mourning\n\nCruelty, Arrogance\n\nInstability, Indulgence\n\nEccentricity, Immaturity\n\nSelf-Involvement, Entitlement\n\nMeanings of Violet / Purple in Other Cultures\n\nIn Western and some Eastern cultures Violet is associated with mourning rituals.\n\nIn Christianity Violet is associated with Advent and Lent.\n\nIn North America pale purple along with yellow are considered Easter colors.\n\nIn some Native American tribes, purple represents wisdom, healing or gratitude.\n\nIn Japan Violet signifies wealth and power.\n\nIn Tibet amethyst is considered sacred to Buddha.\n\nIn the Ukrainian tradition of egg dyeing, purple dye signifies faith, patience and trust.\n\nIn Iran purple is an omen of the future depending on the color of the sun during an eclipse.\n\nIn Thailand widows wear purple to mourn their husband’s death.\n\nIn Egypt purple represents virtue and faith.\n\nIn the English speaking world, Violet is often used as a girl’s name.\n\nMeanings of Violet / Purple in English Phrases\n\nBeing ‘Purple with Rage’ is commonly used to describe people who are uncontrollably angry.\n\n‘Purple Speech’ refers to profanity and raunchy language.\n\n‘Purple Haze’ refers to a state of drug-induced confusion or euphoria.
