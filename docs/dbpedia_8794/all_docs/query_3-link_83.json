        "text": "What is a Wood’s lamp examination?\n\nA Wood’s lamp examination is a simple test that can identify certain conditions on your skin, scalp and hair. It’s often used to help diagnose fungal, bacterial and parasitic infections.\n\nThe lamp uses long-wave ultraviolet (UV) light to make certain cells show color or appear fluorescent.\n\nThe tool, developed by American physicist Robert Wood, is also called:\n\nBlacklight test.\n\nUltraviolet light test.\n\nWood’s light test.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nWhat can a Wood’s lamp diagnose?\n\nWood’s lamp examination can help healthcare providers diagnose several disorders, including:\n\nAbnormal pigmentation, such as melasma and vitiligo.\n\nBacterial infection, including Pseudomonas and Corynebacterium.\n\nCorneal abrasion.\n\nPorphyria.\n\nScabies and head lice.\n\nSkin fungus infections, including ringworm, tinea capitis (scalp ringworm) or tinea versicolor (yeast infection on the skin).\n\nSkin imperfections such as acne, aging skin and milia.\n\nWho performs this exam?\n\nSkin doctors called dermatologists often use Wood’s lamp. But other healthcare professionals also may perform the test, including primary care providers and nurses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat else can Wood’s light detect?\n\nThe tool also is used for nonmedical purposes. For example:\n\nBanks can use the tool to detect counterfeit money.\n\nBouncers can check hand stamps for people re-entering a bar or club.\n\nImmigration officers can check passports to make sure they’re real.\n\nLaw-enforcement officers can check crime scenes for urine or semen.\n\nMuseums, jewelers and scientists can examine paintings, sculptures, minerals and gems.\n\nHow does a Wood’s lamp work?\n\nA Wood’s lamp emits black light, which is ultraviolet and can’t be seen by the naked human eye. It also emits a tiny bit of light on the violet spectrum, which can be seen by the naked human eye.\n\nWhen the UV light shines on skin or another surface, some cells appear differently. Certain colors indicate healthy skin. Other colors, or a glowing appearance, might reveal unhealthy cells, such as fungus or bacteria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow do I prepare for a Wood’s light exam?\n\nBefore a Wood’s lamp examination, your skin should be clean but not recently washed. Don’t apply makeup, deodorant, creams or other products to your skin or scalp before the test. Those products can affect the results.\n\nWhat can I expect during the blacklight test?\n\nA Wood’s lamp doesn’t emit any heat and the test is painless. Your healthcare provider will take the following steps to conduct a Wood’s light examination:\n\nMake the room completely dark. This may involve turning off overhead lights, closing window shades or using a black drape over your skin.\n\nTurn on the Wood’s lamp, which will glow a bit.\n\nWait about a minute to let the lamp warm up and let their eyes adjust to the darkness.\n\nPut on safety goggles or glasses.\n\nHold the lamp about 5 inches away from you to look at your skin for a few seconds.\n\nTurn off the lamp, then turn on the lights in the room.\n\nDiscuss the results with you.\n\nWhat are the risks of a Wood’s light exam?\n\nA UV light test is safe and doesn’t cause any skin damage. Very rarely, in people with extreme light sensitivity, the lamp can cause a temporary rash.\n\nHowever, the lamp can cause damage to your eyes, particularly with repeat exposure. Your healthcare provider may ask you to close your eyes or wear protective goggles during the exam.\n\nWhen should I know the results of a Wood’s light test?\n\nYour healthcare provider will discuss the results with you immediately after the test. To make a specific diagnosis, they also might consider your health history, symptoms and other test results.\n\nWhat do Wood’s lamp colors mean?\n\nNormal, healthy human skin under UV light looks bluish. Other colors on relatively healthy skin might be:\n\nWhite: Areas of thick skin (or possibly lint from clothing).\n\nYellow: Oily skin.\n\nPurple: Dry or dehydrated skin.\n\nIf your skin shows another color or glows (fluorescent or luminescent), it might reveal an infection or other condition. For example:\n\nBright blue-white might indicate hypopigmentation or depigmentation (too little pigment).\n\nBrown might identify hyperpigmentation (too much pigment).\n\nBlue-green might reveal certain fungal infections.\n\nCoral pink may suggest a bacterial infection.\n\nPink-red might mean porphyria.\n\nWhite or gray spots on your scalp can indicate head lice.\n\nYellow or orange can help identify certain yeast.\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nWood’s lamp examination is a simple, painless, risk-free test that can identify certain conditions on your skin, scalp and hair. The UV light test, along with your health history and symptoms, can help diagnose infections and other issues. The test takes only a few minutes and results are available immediately."
