        "text": "Violet is the color of imagination and spirituality. It stimulates the imagination and inspires high ideals. It is a reflective color, which allows us to get in touch with our more profound thoughts.\n\nViolet contains the energy and strength of red color and the spirituality and integrity of blue. It combines body and mind and creates a balance between our physical and mental energy. Helps people who are looking for the meaning of life and spiritual fulfillment.\n\nIn terms of color, violet represents the future, imagination, dreams. Spiritually soothes the emotions, increases our psychic ability, spiritual enlightenment, but holds firmly to the ground. It promotes harmony of emotions that contribute to mental equilibrium and stability and balance of the mind, a connection between the spiritual and the physical world, between thinking and action.\n\nThe violet color promotes sensitivity and compassion. It is sensitive to all the different forms of pollution: noise pollution, visual pollution. This sensitivity allows the susceptibility to diseases and allergies. It can stimulate and worsen depression.\n\nIt encourages creative engagement and inspiration and originality through its creative endeavors. Is unique, individual, and independent.\n\nIt combines wisdom and power with sensitivity and humility. It is ambitious and self-confident. The violet color is mainly associated with the nobility, creating an impression of luxury, wealth, and extravagance.\n\nPositive features of violet are: oddities, creativity, resourcefulness, selflessness, mystery, fantasy, future.\n\nNegative characteristics of violet are immaturity, impracticability, cynicism, indifference, arrogance.\n\nIt is very popular with less cultural people who are not under the influence of more cultural civilization. In civilized and sophisticated cultures, it is not that much popular.\n\nWith Buddhists, in addition to yellow and orange, it is also famous for clothing.\n\nPurple is the color of Hinduism and feminism (symbolizing the right of women to power and equality with men).\n\nPurple symbolizes the situation of the bishops.\n\nIt is the color of penitence and fasting before Easter and Christmas.\n\nViolet connects the physical world (red) with the spiritual world, the sky (blue) in the magical world of mystery (purple), where completely different rules apply.\n\nUsually, kings, rulers, and priests were dressed in scarlet-violet. This expensive dye could only be afforded by wealthy, due to it was produced in tiny amounts out of sea-snails (Murex). So purple (scarlet) has always been associated with nobility and spiritual power.\n\nSmall children were often wrapped in violet textiles since this would bring prosperity and success to a child.\n\nIn Brazil, it is the color of mourning."
