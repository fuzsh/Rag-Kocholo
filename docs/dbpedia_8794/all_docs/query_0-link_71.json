        "text": "In your evening travels, have you come across any street lights in the Boston area that are blue or purple? It’s not meant to be that way. They’re not some kind of upgrade or an energy-saving invention like I assumed. A listener in Saugus called today and said she heard they heard using these special lights is to help prevent crime. So I looked it up.\n\nNone of these theories are true. And no, the blue or purple lights are not used to determine if you’ve had the vaccine or not. (Seriously, some wackos said that too.)\n\nAs you see from this TV report, the problem isn’t unique to the Boston area. Or even Massachusetts. The problem is all over. An effort to save energy by converting to LED light has sort of backfired. Turns out that blue or purple color… it’s a manufacturing defect.\n\nIt’s not the lights that are actually defective. LED lights normally have a blue / violet color. It’s the covering that has worn off and needs to be replaced. The coating is supposed to turn that blue’ish or purple’ish light to a bright white so you can see better. Any streetlights you see that are blue in color should actually be reported so they can be fixed. Where have you seen lots of them?
