        "text": "Ghostbusters/Ghostbusters II\n\nUS (1984/1989) Dir. Ivan Reitman\n\nA two-for-the-price-of-one review now courtesy of BBC 1 here in the UK who screened the first two films of the Ghosbusters franchise during the Christmas break. I have seen them before but not for many years (at least 30 plus), and with little else going on, this was my cue to take a trip down memory lane.\n\nIn the first film, parapsychology professors Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Ackroyd) and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) are researching psychic phenomena whilst dabbling in the supernatural in their spare time. Fired by the university dean after causing a stir with a ghost at the New York Public Library, the trio start their own paranormal investigation business Ghostbusters.\n\nBusiness is slow until cellist Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) finds her fridge has become a gateway to another dimension where a dog like creature calls out to Zuul. Dana calls upon Ghostbusters to help her, with Venkman leaping at the job hoping to get lucky. In the mean time, supernatural occurrences begin to increase in New York which means hiring a fourth member Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), whilst the problems with Zuul are about to get very serious.\n\nOriginally conceived by Dan Ackroyd as a vehicle for him and his Blues Brothers partner John Belushi, Ghostbusters would have adopted a Doctor Who formula with the duo travelling through time and space to vanquish ghosts. Belushi died in 1982 and the cost of bringing the script to life would have been too much so, Ackroyd rewrote the script with Harold Ramis, setting it on terra firma in New York, and the rest as they say…\n\nWe can clearly see Belushi would have played the Venkman character by dint of his wise cracking propensity and immature behaviour, but it is fair to say Bill Murray did make the role his own. It is interesting to note how well the gags flow so well and feel natural in Murray’s hands, as opposed to the 2016 all-female reboot where everything felt forced. And with everyone trying to be funny in that film, there were no anchors like Spengler or receptionist Janine (Annie Potts) here.\n\nDana would end up more than a potential love interest for Venkman when she is possessed by Zuul, and referring to herself as the Gatekeeper. Meanwhile, Dana’s nerdy neighbour Louis (Rick Moranis) is possessed by the Keymaster Vinz Clortho, and he needs to unite with Zuul to summon a demon named Gozer, who will then unleash the apocalypse on the world.\n\nMade for a comparatively measly $25 million, the larger special effects haven’t aged so well, with some valiant attempts at per-CGI overlays and blending. The devil dogs were a mix of puppets, stop-motion animation, and the above-mentioned pre-CGI and were admittedly cromulent at best in 1984. However, the stuff that does work well, like Slimer the greedy ghost and the giant Stay Puft marshmallow man negates any serious need for complaint on this front.\n\nQuotable, influential, and now iconic, Ghostbusters was an instant classic, helped also by the ridiculously catchy sing-a-long theme song by Ray Parker Jr. It inevitably became a franchise, starting with an animated TV series in 1985, before a film sequel arrived in 1989. Set five years after the first film, New York is so safe from supernatural attacks that Ghostbusters no longer exists – only via Ray and Winston’s personal appearances to unappreciative youngsters who want He-Man instead.\n\nVenkman has a psychic TV talk show whilst Spengler conducts experiments on human emotions. Dana is now divorced with a baby, Oscar, and restores art at a museum. One day, something tries to abduct Oscar whilst Dana has strange feelings about a portrait of Vigo the Carpathian, a 16th century magician and tyrant. She calls Ray and Spengler but not Venkman although he tags along anyway. Then a slimy pink substance appears that seems to react to negative human energy, heralding the return of Ghostbusters.\n\nUnfortunately, despite the best efforts of writers Ackroyd and Ramis to achieve their objective of discussing the consequences of negative energy in large cities, the story was in essence a retread of the first film – Dana gets in trouble, the team are called, the team cause trouble, the team are jailed (in this case sectioned), the team are released and save the day.\n\nYou’ll forgive my cynicism which is something the script doesn’t have in exploring its central themes. The opening act with the team as a now irrelevant force in the public eye is as far as it gets; logic later is defenestrated when a judge and later the mayor seems to have forgotten what the team did for New York and dismisses their very correct theories. Five years might not be a long time but this is one instance where history shouldn’t repeat itself.\n\nSpiritual possession of a baby might seem edgy – Vigo needs a baby’s body to break free from the painting – but as a family film, this was never going to eat into The Exorcist’s infamy. Also succumbing to evil is Janosz Poha (Peter MacNicol), Dana’s annoying boss at the museum enslaved by Vigo to do his bidding, pretty much rehashing Louis’s role from the first film. Incidentally, Louis is now part of the team in this film.\n\nHowever short this sequel falls against its predecessor, it is still more enjoyable than the two most recent efforts – the 2016 version tries way too hard whilst 2021’s canon offspring Ghostbusters: Afterlife doesn’t try hard enough. 2024 sees the next chapter Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, and I for one can barely contain my apathy.\n\nThankfully, we still have the original 1984 Ghostbusters to refer to whenever we need a little bit of supernatural silliness in our lives, budget-hindered effects and all. Milking a hit is sadly inevitable but not always wise no matter how much potential there is; others are best left alone. QED. At least the theme song still rocks after 40 years!"
