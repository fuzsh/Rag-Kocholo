        "text": "Ghostbusters (1984) is my all-time favorite movie. There’s no other movie I watched so often and loved so much in my youth that I still watch so often and love so much now. Once I grew up and could appreciate all the adult humor I missed as a kid, I loved it even more. I love it more each time I watch it and I’ve been watching it for almost forty years! By the same token, I’ve never been more insulted by a movie than Ghostbusters: Afterlife. It was a lazy remake of the first film which drove its plot by desecrating the integrity of the original film and characters (especially Egon!). Given Ghostbusters: Afterlife was written by Gil Kenan and Jason Reitman and directed by Jason Reitman and Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is written by Gil Kenan and Jason Reitman and directed by Gil Kenan, I was unsure if I’d subject myself to the crushing disappointment and raging anger I was sure would follow. But Ernie Hudson, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Annie Potts are back and they’ve been my heroes my whole life. So I went. I saw it. Was it any good? Can creativity bloom amidst nostalgia? This is that story.\n\nNote, SPOILERS will follow but MAJOR SPOILERS will be clearly marked again.\n\nOn October 30th last year Hannah texted me to ask, “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire drops in March – how likely are we to attend this film?” I told her, “Huh, well, to be honest, I didn’t even know the new one had a release date. And ummmmm, I think my life will be happier if I don’t go (obvs.) but there is a small chance nostalgia will get the best of me (thus leading to more cinematic regrets). So let’s put the odds at…35%.” (Yes, phrasing it that way was a nod to Groundhog Day.) Hannah suggested, “What if we went together to do our own Mystery Science Theatre 3000 viewing? I’m morbidly curious.” I said, “Hahaha, that could be fun. I think I’ll have to see a trailer or two before I can commit. The last one made me so angry XD. But I do love Carrie Coon and McKenna Grace so we’ll see…”\n\nClearly it wasn’t a hard “no” but the lingering aftertaste of HOW TERRIBLE Ghostbusters: Afterlife was kept me hesitant. Then trailers started to pop up. I had to admit, they made me laugh. But people can cut a great trailer from a shitty movie so I was still unsure.\n\nCome the end of January, I tried to write my way through my angst. In my piece about the Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire trailer, I put the reasons I would see this film in conversation with the reasons I wouldn’t. The reasons I wanted to see it were:\n\nPatton Oswalt!!! I’ve loved him since The King of Queens!\n\nCarrie Coon is a magnificent actor.\n\nWho doesn’t enjoy Paul Rudd? I do!\n\nMckenna Grace is one of the most accomplished young actors around.\n\nKumail Nanjiani has been hilarious in everything I’ve seen him in.\n\nErnie Hudson, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, and Annie Potts are back in uniform!\n\nAnd, you know, my lifelong love of the Ghostbusters which eclipses my love of most fictional universes.\n\nAnd the reasons I didn’t want to see it were:\n\nGhostbusters: Afterlife\n\nGhostbusters: Afterlife\n\nGHOSTBUSTERS: Fucking AFTERLIFE\n\nGhostbusters: Afterlife\n\nWhat was ultimately frustrating (or helpful?) was my realization that there was no choice. I’ve loved the Ghostbusters my whole life. Ernie Hudson, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Annie Potts were back. They were supposedly central to the film and not just cameos this time. Plus, my anger around Ghostbusters: Afterlife eventually burned off and I just nothing the film now. It’s not worthy of even my hate, you know? And Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire couldn’t be worse than Afterlife so I decided I couldn’t pass it up.\n\nOn Saturday, February 24th Hannah texted, “So……I know it’s going to suck…..but can we go see Ghostbusters together?” I said, “I was actually just thinking of texting you about this the other night! Let’s go. As disappointing as it probably will be, with Patton Oswalt in it and the original cast back in fully fleshed out roles and the fact that the trailer made me laugh a couple times…I’m in.” Hannah said, “I love this plan. I’m excited to be a part of it. And we have to go together because even if we hate it – we can hate it together!” I agreed :).\n\nI will say I felt ripped off with Patton Oswalt. He was only in one scene! Kumail Nanjiani didn’t disappoint though! He was the funniest character in the whole movie! I laughed more at his lines than I laughed at the rest of the movie put together (which is saying something about the writing and the use of the original cast because this film has Bill Murray in it). And McKenna Grace’s performance as Phoebe Spengler (the only praiseworthy (and brilliantly so) thing about Ghostbusters: Afterlife) continues to steal the show.\n\nBy way of the li’l summary, Phoebe’s mom Callie Spengler (Carrie Coon), Egon’s daughter, is now living in New York City with her two children Phoebe (McKenna Grace) and the kid from Stranger Things Trevor (Finn Wolfhard). Callie has been dating Gary Grooberson (Paul Rudd), Phoebe’s old science teacher, for the two years since the last film and they are all working as Ghostbusters, with Jeanine Melnitz (Annie Potts) serving as their liaison with Winston. Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), now a wealthy philanthropist, has reopened the Firehouse and is funding their ghostbusting as he runs a larger paranormal research center, where the girl from the last movie Lucky (Celeste O’Connor) is interning for the summer and working beside some guy with glasses Lars Pinfield (James Acaster). Phoebe’s friend Podcast (Logan Kim) is spending the summer working with Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) at his occult bookstore. Oh, and Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) is doing…stuff, too. Things get nuts when Kumail Nanjiani Nadeem Razmaadi (Kumail Nanjiani) sells Ray an old orb that belonged to his grandmother. The orb buries the PKE meter’s needle and Ray, Phoebe, and Podcast are soon off to see the folklorist Spence Olchin Patton Oswalt Dr. Hurbert Wartzki (Patton Oswalt) who recognizes the orb from legends which claim it contains an ancient evil (god? demigod? sorcerer? being? uh…) named Garraka. (As the strikethroughs show, sadly most of the new characters aren’t developed memorably. Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh.)\n\nLegend tells that Garraka kills with fear itself, known as “the Death Chill.”\n\nBut it never kills anyone (or even seems to) with fear, just icicles and freezing people.\n\nOh, also after the opening action set piece where Phoebe, Callie, Gary, and Trevor zip the Ecto-1 through Manhattan to catch the Sewer Dragon of Hell’s Kitchen, Walter Peck (William Atherton), who is now inexplicably the mayor of New York City, yells at them for endangering a minor (Phoebe’s sixteen-years-old). When he finds out they aren’t paying her, he says its “a child labor issue” and permanently benches her until she’s an adult and no one looks into getting her working papers (for some reason). This conflict – Phoebe being upset because she’s forced out of a job she loves while the rest of her family tries to tell her it’s only a couple years – drives much of the movie.\n\nMy big problem with this film is lazy writing. In that way, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire actually reminds me a lot of Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens. It is has SO MUCH potential. These new characters are begging to be fleshed out and claim their spot in the Ghostbusters world and I wish, wish, wish we got to see them in the spotlight! But the film largely forsakes that (hence my being unable to remember any new character’s name including Trevor and Lucky who were in the last movie) for nostalgia-baiting.\n\nWhy continue to develop Phoebe, Nadeem, and Gary as original character when we can have a scene where Peter talks to Nadeem with a colander on his head? That was in the first movie! Why give time over to fleshing out Callie and all the other characters whose names I couldn’t remember when we can have nostalgia-bait scenes with Ray, Jeanine, Winston, and Peter which (and this pains me to say) really don’t advance or affect the plot at all? Familiarity, callbacks, and Easter eggs don’t equate good writing. It doesn’t stop there either.\n\nWhile Garraka isn’t Vigo the Carpathian and the orb isn’t a painting, he is a creature trapped in an object who possesses others to get what he needs just like in Ghostbusters II. We see the containment unit blow up just like it did in Ghostbusters (1984). Slimer is there just to slime Trevor like he did Peter in Ghostbusters. And Walter Peck (who a random person in a crowd calls “dickless” just Peter did in the first movie) closes down the Firehouse and impounds their equipment which we saw in Ghostbusters (the last act) and Ghostbusters II (the first act). Also, there is NO REASON Peck’s in the movie outside of hoping old fans think, “He was in the first movie!” He has no impact on the plot whatsoever. The locks he places on the Firehouse are picked by Phoebe in seconds and the gear he impounds is irrelevant because Winston’s crew has built more – new tech, that looks and works exactly like the old tech.\n\nThe only characters with arcs who have an essential impact on the plot are Phoebe, Gary, and Nadeem. And that’s good! I want more Phoebe! But their development still remains scattered, feeling forgotten by the writers until it isn’t, in a movie that’s never sure what it wants to be. Is it a comedy? There are jokes. Is it a story about a family coming together? A handful of scenes would imply it is. Is it a horror film? Well there are jump scares. It’s not terrible…but it’s also not consistently good. It just sort of is.\n\nOkay, so the next paragraph will have SIGNIFICANT SPOILERS FOR THE FINAL SCENE OF THE FILM so if you’d like to avoid that, skip down below the picture of Ray and Nadeem and you can read the rest of the piece without fear. If you’ve seen it or don’t mind spoilers, well then read on :D.\\\n\nIn the final scene, as the whole cast – original and new – exit the Firehouse in their Ghostbusters uniforms to a cheering crowd thanking them for saving the world as Ray Parker Jr.’s “Ghostbusters” plays (exactly like Ghostbusters (1984) (◔_◔)), Phoebe calls Gary “Dad.” As soon as the credits started to roll I turned to Hannah and said, “That’s what the movie should’ve been about.” There are scenes of Gary talking with Callie about what his role is with the kids now. Is he their friend? Is he a parent? Is he mom’s boyfriend? Callie encourages him to go all in, to parent, and warns him it’s hard. We see Gary and Phoebe struggle with this, too. But instead of being the emotional core of the movie it was lost amidst the nonsense and I forgot about it until Phoebe calls Gary, “Dad.” And I felt something there! It was the only moment which made me emotional at all. And I thought how much bigger and more beautiful the payoff could’ve been if Gil Kenan and Jason Reitman had the faith in the characters they created to let them be the stars of their own movie.\n\nI did love Winston running the show. And, as Hannah observed, Ray was always “the heart of the Ghostbusters” so to see him settle into the mentor role with Phoebe and Podcast felt right. Just like I wrote in my piece on Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, there is something revolutionary in a culture so obsessed with and fearful of aging, to have Ernie Hudson (who’s seventy-eight-years-old), Bill Murray (seventy-three), and Dan Aykroyd and Annie Potts (both seventy-one) suiting up and bustin’ ghosts as heroes in this movie. I love that!\n\nBut that wasn’t enough to make a great film. Or even a good one. It was…a film. I didn’t hate it. I’d watch it again, probably. But it just sort of was. All the courage, all the vision, all the heart which made Ghostbusters such a hit forty years ago was missing because the whole damn thing was nostalgia-baiting as opposed to trying to do something interesting or new (or even consistently funny). Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire – like so many movies and shows anymore, frustratingly – was dependent on my wanting to see something I’ve seen before, slightly repackaged. Which I didn’t. I don’t. I have Ghostbusters (1984) at home for that.\n\nJeff was right, all those years ago when we were talking about Ghostbusters: Afterlife. Nostalgia IS going to kill us. At least it’s going to kill creativity. I struggle with who wants to see such vapid “stories” with such beloved characters. Though I have to admit, judging by the numbers legacy sequels often do at the box office, I am seemingly in the minority here.\n\nI’m not sorry I went to see Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. I owed it to four-year-old me. To be fair, I owed it to forty-one-year-old me, too. Though I am sorry the original cast was primarily there to nostalgia-bait. I’m sorry Phoebe, Nadeem, and Gary weren’t allowed to hold the spotlight and the rest of the new cast weren’t developed in any real way. Maybe those days are done for the Ghostbusters…and maybe all our existing franchises? I don’t know.\n\nBut I think, now that I’ve posted this piece, I’m going to go rewatch Babylon or Barbie or Poor Things or Past Lives.\n\nPsssst, hey, if you still feel like to you need to explore the contrived ridiculousness of Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire a liiiiiiiittle bit more, here’s Ryan George’s Pitch Meeting for the film!"
