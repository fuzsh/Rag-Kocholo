        "text": "★★★★ out of 5 -- Rated: PG-13 -- Run time: 1 hour, 55 minutes\n\nIt’s hard to believe that the first “Ghostbusters” film was released 40 years ago, way back in 1984. Since it was a major box office smash, the studio, of course, wanted a sequel, and five years later we were served the less-than-stellar ”Ghostbusters II.”\n\nFast forward to 2016 and the simple truth that Hollywood loves to resurrect old ideas (pun intended) -- and we get a reboot featuring female ghostbusters Kate McKinnon, Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones. Despite all that talent, the film wasn’t a critical -- or audience -- favorite and landed with a thud.\n\nThe franchise appeared to be dead and buried until 2021 when original director Ivan Reitman teamed up with his son, Jason (who directed and also co-wrote the script with Gil Kenan), to make “Ghostbusters: Afterlife.”\n\nThe film introduced new characters -- mainly the children of ghostbuster Egon Spengler (played in the first two films by Harold Ramis) as well as their mom (Carrie Coon) and a science teacher played by the always likable Paul Rudd. But in a masterstroke that the fans loved, they also brought back original stars Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts -- and through the magic of visual effects, even the late Ramis.\n\nIt proved to be a very satisfying and often touching movie -- that the studio deemed worthy of a sequel.\n\nFor “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,” Jason Reitman and Kenan once again co-wrote the script, but Kenan took over directing.\n\nThe plot has to do with the Spengler family operating the original ghostbusting business in New York City and dealing with personal and professional issues, including a powerful, long-imprisoned evil spirit that escapes.\n\nThe story features a LOT of characters, both returning and new. McKenna Grace (“Gifted”) and Finn Wolfhard (“Stranger Things”) are back as the two Spangler children -- Phoebe and Trevor.\n\nGrace does a lot of the heavy lifting as the daughter who rebels after being disciplined and winds up befriending a fellow teen -- a ghost named Melody wonderfully played by Geena Davis look-a-like Emily Alyn Lind from “The Babysitter” films on Netflix. There’s an excellent dynamic between the two young ladies that becomes more complex as the movie progresses.\n\nOne of the real highlights of the cast is comedian/actor Kumail Nanjiani (“The Big Sick”) as a fast-talking slacker whose sale of a ghost-containing orb owned by his grandmother sets off a major series of events. Nanjiani successfully walks a fine line between being a dishonest con man and a guy who might step up to the plate. He winds up stealing every scene he is in.\n\nFellow comedian/actor Patton Oswalt also gets kudos for his performance as an eccentric expert in ancient languages.\n\nOriginal ghostbusters Aykroyd and Hudson are back with sizeable roles, while Murray shows up briefly an hour into the movie, and then returns for the big final scene, naturally delivering a couple of devasting lines.\n\n“Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire” contains much more drama than comedy, with a spirit villain that’s pretty scary. (The movie is rated PG-13)\n\nThe movie thankfully does not go overboard on the special effects, something that could easily have happened. The film is far more emotional than I expected and does a wonderful job of tying multiple story points together at the end for a very satisfying conclusion."
