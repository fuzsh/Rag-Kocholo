        "text": "This week on the show, we’re catching up on all that we weren’t able to chat about the last couple weeks with the 300th episode celebration! On the Afterlife front, Jason Reitman confirms November in theaters date, Ernie Hudson has seen the movie, Annie Potts calls the experience of making the movie “trippy,” and the onslaught of Mini-Puft merch has begun including blind bags, Christmas ornaments, and walkie talkies! The Buffalo Ghostbusters are raising funds for Hook and Ladder No. 8 to get them a new not-so-subtle sign. Randy Edelman’s fantastic Ghostbusters II score is coming in June (now confirmed) and we have the track listings for the vinyl release. All that and a whole lot more on the show!\n\nThis week on the show: Bill, Dan, Ernie, Annie and Sigourney are back and it’s official! Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair had the exclusive scoop last week that the “OGBs” are returning for Jason Reitman’s Ghostbusters Afterlife, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, and Sigourney Weaver are all in! And the article included a great story about how Bill made the journalist wear a proton pack for an extended period of time. You better believe Troy and Chris are going to pour over every detail of the article: what can be gleaned about the tone on set? Why do we think it was not accompanied by a photo? And what do the boys think this means for the strategy of the film moving forward? All that plus the winner of our inflatable Ecto contest, a Ghostbusters-themed lightsaber, and another ridiculous bootleg available online! Join us!\n\nThis week on the show, has it really been this long? Boy, we should really treat this year as a new “pilot” so to speak, so that you know who these two dopes are that talk for hours and hours and why you should listen to them. And sure, since we’ve been on hiatus for the holidays we should probably talk about the QuickBooks ads starring Annie Potts reprising her role as Janine, some of the most recent Ghostbusters Afterlife news and murmurings, remembering SFX artist Tim Lawrence and comedian Buck Henry, and just what exactly was that awesome Atom View technology that Sony Electronics was showing off at CES? Troy explains why it made him geek out (aside from the Ecto being refurbished and on display in front of the Vegas crowd). Bonus, just what was Troy’s ridiculous bootleg gift from his parents for Christmas? Help us figure out one of the signatures this week on the show!\n\nThis week on the show, it's the calm before the storm. This weekend is the International Toy Fair in New York, plus a whole bunch of news is on the horizon. So Troy and Chris take this opportunity to talk nerdy about Dana Barrett's apartment and how it may have fared after the interdimensional crossrip that occurred there. Are you legal required to tell a potential tenant that a building had a 50-foot marshmallow man climb it and two of its previous occupants were possessed by demonic dogs?\n\nThis week on the show, we're joined by psychology professor and author of the Geek Handbook, Alex Langley. Alex joins us to chat a little about the in-world psychology of Ghostbusters (ie. the phrase \"I ain't afraid of no ghosts\" and how humor helps disarm stressful situations, why the hell do crowds gather around the hellmouth where the world might be ending?), then chats a little about the general social media response to the new Ghostbusters, the very polarized views, and introduces Troy and Chris to the concept of \"weaponized nostalgia.\" We also talk with Alex a bit about the benefits and the detriments of having these extended adolescences, purchasing toys and playing dress up as adults. This is one you won't want to miss. Stick around afterward for the latest news including a Ghostbusters Day roundup, (sort of) results of the Loot Crate contest, Jimmy Kimmel guests both old and new in celebration of the new movie and Ghostbusters Day, Ivan Reitman on the KROQ Kevin & Bean show talking about Ghostbusters old and new, featurettes give us a better idea of the new Ghostbusters characters (and a taste of Fall Out Boy's new theme), new LEGO Dimensions packs announced including a Ghostbusters (2016) story, that plus a whole lot more on another jam-packed episode!"
