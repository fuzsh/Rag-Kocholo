        "text": "One memory from my ’80s childhood has always stuck with me; I was in the garage hanging out with a friend, in mid-conversation with a copy of a book adaptation of 1984’s Ghostbusters in my hand when, I looked up to find a loose neighborhood dog standing at the end of the driveway, snarling in my direction with all of its fury. Instinctively, I threw said book in its direction prior to bolting for the back door before it had a chance to maim either one of us.\n\nThat’s just one of many personal Ghostbusters-related stories I can recall. When originally conceived by series creators Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, I doubt they had in mind a franchise consisting of merchandise that ended up in the hands of just about every kid in the decade it was released (nor do I think envisioned said kids using it to fend off stray dogs as frightening as the two “terror dogs” featured in their own film, though I could be wrong).\n\nDirected by Ivan Reitman, the film follows three New York City-based parapsychologists – Dr. Ray Stantz (Aykroyd), Dr. Egon Spengler (Ramis), and Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray, in a role originally intended for John Belushi before his untimely death) – who go into business together catching ghosts and becoming local heroes in the process.\n\nOnce business starts really picking up, they’re able to hire both a receptionist named Janine (Annie Potts), and a fourth member, Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson). And the group is further expanded by a love interest for Venkman, Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) and her quirky neighbor Louis Tully (Rick Moranis). From then on, all the pieces to the puzzle seemingly fit together flawlessly on screen before our eyes.\n\nReleased the same day as a another massive ’80s hit, Gremlins, Ghostbusters was a bona fide blockbuster, with each of said films eventually reaching iconic status (ironically, I remember my family getting both movies on VHS at the same time, and still have both copies to this very day – one of which now actually signed by a cast member, which I’ll get to shortly) and becoming required viewing in just about every suburban household at the time.\n\nNot long after the film’s release came the animated series The Real Ghostbusters in 1986, and a media franchise of toys, video games, lunchboxes, and nearly anything else one can think of, was officially spawned. An inevitable sequel, simply titled Ghostbusters II, finally appeared in 1989, and while not always looked back on with fondness, the second entry served as another rite of passage of sorts for me when going to see it in the theater, becoming the first film I ever watched completely independently/solo, thanks to the cinema being so full it was impossible to find more than one seat at a time.\n\nAfter a number of years laying dormant, the series was finally revived in 2016 with an unfortunate reboot that would’ve been best left on the shelf than actually produced. Thankfully, a “proper” sequel finally appeared in the form of 2021’s Ghostbusters: Afterlife, which saw the continuation of original characters (and many returning cast members) and even their ancestors. Another admirable follow-up, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, haunted theaters as recently as just this past March.\n\nIn 2015, my wife Brooke and I were lucky enough to meet Dr. Stantz himself, Dan Aykroyd, where I had him sign that very VHS tape that sat on top of my family’s entertainment center all those years prior (see photo). While a great moment nonetheless, I only wish I had asked all the questions I would later think of after-the-fact (naturally!).\n\nThe author (left) with Ghostbusters actor and writer/co-creator Dan Aykroyd in Orlando, FL on 3/21/15 (Photo by Brooke Striewski).\n\nAnd then of course there’s the coinciding song that no Ghostbusters conversation is truly complete without. Written and recorded by Ray Parker, Jr., the song was released the same time as the film, and its star-studded music video was also directed by Reitman. In 2022, the family and I got our second, firsthand ghost “encounter” when we saw Parker live at Epcot that October, receiving his biggest reaction of course at the intro to his biggest hit to date.\n\nRay Parker, Jr. performing “Ghostbusters” at Epcot in Orlando, FL on 10/21/22 (Photo by Brooke Striewski).\n\nFour decades later, we’re still here talking about the franchise with a fondness that few other film series can actually rival. It was a moment of time when American cinema and art was truly at a peak not seen before, or since its release. I will gladly remain stuck in that era of time for the remainder of my days rather than entertain ninety percent of what Hollywood tries passing as “entertainment” these days.\n\nA signed copy by Dan Aykroyd of the original Ghostbusters on VHS from the author’s collection."
