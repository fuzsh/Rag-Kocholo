        "text": "Legacy Ghostbusters star Annie Potts says Janine Melnitz will finally answer the call and suit up in Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire.\n\n“It’s a desperate situation, so it’s all hands on deck,” Potts said in an interview with Empire Magazine featuring Janine and the O.G. Ghostbusters on the cover in full gear. “It turns out Janine is quite capable – as most women tend to be when given the chance.”\n\nPotts’ Janine was introduced as the no-nonsense secretary of the famous Firehouse headquarters in 1984’s Ghostbusters and subsequently reprised the role in 1989’s Ghostbusters II and 2021’s Ghostbusters: Afterlife. The decision to put Janine into action as a Ghostbuster was a surprise for Potts as the idea was created by director Gil Kenan just a few short weeks after Frozen Empire began production.\n\n“I have to say I did [get a kick out of it],” Potts added. “Janine has served long and well, and I felt like she was finally getting her stripes, you know? She’s clearly stayed in touch with the guys [between Ghostbusters II and Frozen Empire], and she’s really been the keeper of the flame at the Firehouse. The Ghostbusters are kind of superheroes, so it’s very nice to finally be seen in that way, too.”\n\nWhat is Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire about?\n\nPicking up where Afterlife left off, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire sees the Spengler family and the legacy Ghostbusters team join forces against a new supernatural force that threatens a second Ice Age around the world. Actors Carrie Coon, Mckenna Grace, Finn Wolfhard, and Paul Rudd reprise their roles from 2021’s Afterlife. Additionally, original Ghostbusters stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, and Annie Potts return to their iconic characters as well as the surprise return of William Atherton as Walter Peck from the original 1984 movie. Newcomers to the franchise include Kumail Nanjiani, Patton Oswalt, and James Acaster.\n\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire hits cinemas on March 22nd."
