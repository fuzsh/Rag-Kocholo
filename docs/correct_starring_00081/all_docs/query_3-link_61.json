        "text": "'Young Sheldon' is ending on May 16 after seven seasons\n\nAnnie Potts wasn't ready to say goodbye to Young Sheldon.\n\nIn a recent interview with Variety, the TV legend said she and the cast felt \"totally ambushed\" by CBS' decision to end the hit comedy after seven seasons.\n\n\"If a show is starting to drag or lag or have a lack of stories or whatever, then you kind of see it coming,\" Potts, 71, said of the show's cancellation. \"We were totally ambushed by this. I was, anyway.\"\n\nPotts' costar Iain Armitage, who plays the titular young Sheldon Cooper, added that he wasn't entirely ready to say goodbye to the series either.\n\nRelated: Young Sheldon's Annie Potts Gets Emotional About Saying Goodbye to Costars She Watched Grow Up (Exclusive)\n\n\"I totally get what Annie means,\" Armitage, 15, said. \"It’s also just hard in a really weird way that I can only really see if I step back and try and take a global view ... I definitely think we could have done a lot more.\"\n\nPotts also called the cancellation \"such a stupid business move,\" citing not only its continued ratings success but its popularity on Netflix and TikTok.\n\nPEOPLE has reached out to CBS for comment.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nYoung Sheldon is the prequel to CBS' The Big Bang Theory, which signed off in 2019. The series chronicles Sheldon's time growing up in Texas before moving to California to attend grad school at the age of 14. Given the character is 14 in season 7, the time felt right for the show to come to an end, according to executive producer Steve Holland.\n\nIn February, he told Deadline and other outlets that The Big Bang Theory timeline played a role in the decision for the prequel to end with its seventh season.\n\n\"There are certain things we know happen in Sheldon’s life at 14,” Holland said. “We started talking about the future of show, and what it looked like. This is the right time for this story to come to an end, knowing that at 14, he goes off to Cal Tech. It felt like the right time to end it strong while it was on top.”\n\nRelated: Iain Armitage Honors Young Sheldon's Final Day of Filming and Looks Back at His First Day on Set\n\nStill, for Potts, who plays Sheldon's grandmother, Meemaw, the show's ending is bittersweet in no small part because she's loved watching her young costars — Armitage and Raegan Revord, 16, who plays Sheldon's twin sister Missy — grow up.\n\nDuring an interview with PEOPLE in February, Potts became emotional while talking about saying goodbye to the young cast.\n\n“I'm going to cry right now,” she said. “I love the children, and it's been a privilege to watch them grow up. [Iain is] so grown up, and when we started, he and Reagan would get on my lap and kiss me and play with my fingernails and my ears. They were tiny, and all day long, they just say, he would say — and they still do — ‘I love you. I love you, Miss Annie.’ \"\n\nWhile Young Sheldon is ending, The Big Bang Theory universe is poised to continue with a spinoff centered on Sheldon's big brother Georgie (Montana Jordan) and his wife Mandy (Emily Osment).\n\nYoung Sheldon's series finale will air May 16 at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
