        "text": "Although the highly-anticipated Ghostbusters: Afterlife, the follow-up film to Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II, has been hit by yet another delay by Sony Pictures, one star has offered their thoughts on the recent release date rescheduling.\n\nTaking to Instagram, returning Ghostbusters star Annie Potts, who is set to return as Janine Melnitz, has promised that while the sequel has been hit with another significant delay, “it’ll be worth the wait.”\n\n“Though I’m sad the premiere is delayed, I am however thrilled they are insisting we all need to experience it TOGETHER back in a good ol’ fashion movie theatre. I miss those days,” Potts said. “It’ll be worth the wait, I promise! So let’s get vaccinated and stay masked so we can get back to going out and doing the things we love!”\n\nGhostbusters: Afterlife will now be releasing in theatres on November 11th, 2021 after being delayed from its June 11th, 2021 date as a result of the continuing closure of movie theatres across the world due to the ongoing global health crisis.\n\nSEE ALSO: Take a look at Ghostbusters: Afterlife’s new Slimer-like ghost Muncher\n\nAlthough fans of the Ghostbusters franchise are going to have to wait slightly longer for the sequel, star Ernie Hudson, who is set to reprise his role as Winston Zeddemore, has previously claimed that Ghostbusters: Afterlife is the sequel “fans have been hoping for” and will completely tie into the first two Ghostbusters movies.\n\nFrom writer and director Jason Reitman, Ghostbusters: Afterlife is the next chapter in the Ghostbusters universe and follows a single mother and her two children who arrive in a small town and begin to discover their connection to the original Ghostbusters and the secret legacy their grandfather left behind."
