        "text": "There’s something strange in the first trailer for the forthcoming sequel to Ghostbusters: Afterlife.\n\nSony released the footage Wednesday and revealed the title as Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, which promises a major presence for the franchise’s iconic firehouse and is set for theatrical release on March 29, 2024. Gil Kenan directs the follow-up to Jason Reitman‘s 2021 movie, Afterlife, which helped give the series new life.\n\nPaul Rudd, Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, Carrie Coon, Logan Kim and Celeste O’Connor reprise their roles from the previous film. Joining them are franchise newcomers Kumail Nanjiani, Patton Oswalt, James Acaster and Emily Alyn Lind.\n\n“For the first time in New York history, people froze to death in the middle of July,” Oswalt explains in the trailer about the so-called death chill. This leads Rudd to ask, “Like, literally scared to death?”\n\nKenan (A Boy Called Christmas) directed the Afterlife sequel from a script he co-wrote with Reitman. Jason Blumenfeld and Reitman produce the film, while Kenan and JoAnn Perritano serve as executive producers.\n\nThis new project is the first in the franchise without the involvement of Ivan Reitman, who died in February 2022. The filmmaker directed the original Ghostbusters that became a sensation upon its 1984 release, along with its sequel, and produced the later movies in the franchise, including Afterlife, which was helmed by his son.\n\nSony teased the Afterlife sequel at CinemaCon with footage showing Grace, Wolfhard, Rudd and Coon wearing Ghostbusters uniforms and residing together at the firehouse in New York City.\n\nOriginal franchise stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson appeared in Afterlife. Earlier this year, Hudson teased that they would all be back, as would Annie Potts, their co-star in the initial film and 1989’s Ghostbusters II."
