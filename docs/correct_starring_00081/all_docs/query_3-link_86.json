        "text": "Ghostbusters: Afterlife – review\n\nGhostbusters and I go back a long way. One of my five all-time favourite film franchises along with Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Back to the Future and Planet of the Apes, it’s a franchise I’ve adored since before I remember adoring any franchise. The first cartoon I remember being mesmerised by is The Real Ghostbusters. One of my earliest memories is being on a plane to Majorca for a family holiday and playing with Ghostbusters action figures on the tray table in front of me when I was barely three years old. One of the first toys I remember owning is a Stay Puft Marshmallow Man toy, followed by the Ecto-1, an Egon action figure and a whole lot more Ghostbusters toys, including the firehouse, which I remember getting from my granny on a very exciting Christmas morning. And as I got older, my love of the franchise only grew as I matured and my appreciation and understanding of the first two films and their tear-inducingly hilarious humour increased. To this day, I take indescribable delight in watching both Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II, and laugh out loud and feel a colossal amount of excitement every time I see them and experience their uproarious comedy and awesome action, and spend time with their tremendously charming, irresistibly lovable and impeccably performed characters. They may have been released over three decades ago, but they never get old. They are the very definition of timeless and they bring me more joy than I could ever convey in words. Suffice it to say then, I was very excited when it was announced almost three years ago that we would finally be getting a follow-up to Ghostbusters I and II, and now that it has at long last arrived, I am beyond elated to declare that I really couldn’t be any happier with what writer/director Jason Reitman has delivered!\n\nThe son of the man who helmed the first two Ghostbusters films has crafted a story for the franchise’s latest film that pays loving and heart-warming homage to the two eighties classics that preceded it while simultaneously moving the story that started in 1984 forward in fascinating, affecting and delightful new ways towards a tremendously moving, thrilling and satisfying climax and conclusion that utterly electrified me, elated me, uplifted me, caused an extremely large lump to form in my throat and overall gave me goosebumps in a way that I don’t think any movie ever has before, and ultimately Reitman provides what feels like an incredibly fitting ending for the saga that his father first brought to life on the big screen 37 years ago. And in the process of doing all of the above, Reitman perfectly and delightfully maintains the tone, visuals and iconic sound effects of the first two Ghostbusters films, while composer Rob Simonsen reuses the iconic musical motifs and themes of the first two films in his score for this film to great effect, and, consequently, Afterlife very much feels, looks and sounds like it takes place in the same universe as its eighties predecessors, and like a true and proper sequel to Ivan Reitman’s beloved 1984 and 1989 supernatural comedy classics, right from its terrifically chilling opening moments.\n\nBut of course, story, tone, visuals and score aside, with the likes of this movie, The Force Awakens and other sequels to beloved decades old films that feature a new generation of characters, there is always the concern that the new characters won’t be likable or well-cast, however, just like the aforementioned The Force Awakens, Ghostbusters: Afterlife and the actresses and actors it brings into the franchise absolutely nail all of the new characters that are introduced here.\n\nFormer flashback Captain Marvel McKenna Grace very effectively and believably conveys her character Phoebe’s impressive intelligence while simultaneously endowing her with a delightfully and endearingly dry wit that makes her immensely likable and extremely easy to warm to and invest in, and, as a result, the character very much feels like she’s her grandfather’s granddaughter, which I loved (incidentally, if you don’t know who her grandfather is, I’m not going to tell you, you’re just going to have to watch the movie!); Finn Wolfhard does an excellent job of making Phoebe’s brother, Trevor, come across as a very relatably awkward teen while also making him seem wonderfully well-meaning and endearingly down-to-earth; Logan Kim delivers a delightfully witty and wacky performance as Phoebe’s classmate, Podcast, that makes the character an absolute blast to watch whenever he’s onscreen; Celeste O’Connor endows Trevor’s co-worker Lucky Domingo with a fantastically feisty and facetious personality that makes her a very fun character; and Carrie Coon very effectively conveys the whirlwind of emotions that Phoebe and Trevor’s mother, Callie, experiences as the film unfolds while making the character come across as endearingly down-to-earth too, and Coon also has great and incredibly cute onscreen chemistry with Paul Rudd, who delivers a typically charming and funny performance as Phoebe’s teacher, Gary Grooberson.\n\nUndoubtedly though, if you’re a massive Ghostbusters fan like me, the returning original Ghostbusters characters are the characters that you’ll be most anxious, interested and excited to see in Afterlife, and their roles and the performances of the individuals who portray them in this movie are utterly joy-inducing! I won’t give away the parts they play in the story here, but I will say that Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson slip seamlessly back into the exceedingly renowned and revered roles of Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz and Winston Zeddemore, respectively, with comedy god Murray once again effortlessly endowing Venkman – who is one of my five all-time favourite film characters along with Han Solo, Indiana Jones, Marty McFly and Doctor Emmet L. “Doc” Brown – with a lovably razor-sharp wit and spouting a plethora of absolutely uproarious and perfectly-timed and -delivered lines, Akyroyd once again effortlessly making Ray lovably enthusiastic and warm-hearted, and Hudson once again effortlessly making Winston come across as a lovably down-to-earth and loyal everyman, and I was smiling from ear to ear like a kid on Christmas morning during every last second of Peter, Ray and Winston’s screen-time. Their roles in this film are the stuff that dreams are made of! And they’re not the only familiar faces who pop up either. It’s no secret that Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts return as Dana and Janine, respectively, in Afterlife too, and, like the OG Ghostbusters, Weaver and Potts slip seamlessly back into their roles, which are also definite highlights of Afterlife. And, while, heartbreakingly, we lost the amazing Harold Ramis back in 2014, still without giving anything specific away, Reitman found an extremely clever and enormously moving way to make Egon a very important part of Afterlife, and the manner in which the character is incorporated into the movie’s plot made me both indescribably happy and tear up.\n\nOh, and if you want even more Ghostbusters goodness, make sure you stay in your seat until the very end of Afterlife’s closing credits because they contain two additional scenes, one of which is an absolutely brilliant full circle moment for both the franchise as a whole and one character in particular, and both of which combined are the icing on top of the icing on top of the icing on the top of the icing on a cake that was already extremely well iced to begin with!\n\nThere genuinely isn’t anything about this film that I can fault. I absolutely, really and truly, wholeheartedly adored every last nanosecond of it! Featuring an utterly spellbinding, hugely affecting and remarkably beautiful narrative; a tone, exceptionally excellent visuals and a stellar score that line up impressively and delightfully perfectly with those of its eighties predecessors; and a plethora of exceptionally well-written, irresistibly endearing and impeccably performed new and old characters, Ghostbusters: Afterlife feels like it was written and directed by a true Ghostbusters fan who has a genuine and strong emotional attachment to and an enormous amount of love and affection for the first two Ghostbusters films for other true Ghostbusters fans who have genuine and strong emotional attachments to and an enormous amount of love and affection for the first two Ghostbusters films, and as one of those individuals, I for one couldn’t be more pleased with this gift and am tremendously grateful for it. So I want to take this opportunity to express my sincerest and most heartfelt thanks to Jason Reitman, Ivan Reitman, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, Annie Potts, McKenna Grace, Finn Wolfhard, Logan Kim, Celeste O’Connor, Carrie Coon, Paul Rudd, Rob Simonsen and everyone else who was involved in making this movie a reality, as well as to the late, great Harold Ramis for being instrumental in creating Ghostbusters in the first place and gifting the world such a magnificent character in the form of Egon Spengler, who is honoured so beautifully, lovingly, touchingly and respectfully in this film, which is a film I’ve been waiting for my whole life, and to say that it most definitely did not disappoint would be the most colossal of colossal understatements. Pure and utter perfection. Go see it at once!\n\nRating: 10/10.\n\nI don’t know if there are plans to make any more Ghostbusters movies after this, and if there aren’t, I’m completely fine with that because this movie is the perfect conclusion for both the story that started with the original Ghostbusters movie and continued with Ghostbusters II and the characters involved, but what I do know is, Sony Pictures, if you are considering producing another Ghostbusters movie, there should only be one answer to the question of to make it, who ya gonna call? – Jason Reitman!\n\nFollow @davesimpson1 on Twitter for notifications about new posts."
