(R) Ghostbuster 1984 poster distributed by Columbia Pictures

Any day now, there could be another remake of the classic 1984 film Ghostbusters. We wouldn't mind seeing Annie Potts reprise her role as Janine Melnitz. See what we did there?

In the '80s, supernatural comedy films weren't a far-fetched production idea, especially since the decade is known for its futuristic style. Ghostbusters became a cultural hit, as people worldwide still dress in versions of the suits worn in the film for Halloween. It revolves around a trio of professors who were fired when they explained their encounter with a ghost at Columbia University. As their credibility was questioned, the group formed a team called "Ghostbusters" with the sole purpose to capture and contain ghosts.

Annie Potts' character was a receptionist with a New York accent that the actress trademarked based on a friend from NYC. If another remake were to happen, it wouldn't be the first time Potts reprised her role; in fact, it seems like she's been Janine for every Ghostbusters movie there is.

Potts and her character could be seen in Ghostbusters II (1989) and could be heard as the voice of Melnitz in the video game that came out the same year. Yet, the actress was on a ghost-busting roll, which didn't stop there. There was another Ghostbusters video game released in 2009; you guessed it, Annie was involved.

Potts appeared in the 2016 Ghostbusters remake but under the role of "desk clerk." In this day and age, remakes are in more than ever, so guess what was released in 2021? Another "buster" with a slight twist. In Ghostbusters: Afterlife, a mom and her two children relocate to a small town where they discover connections between the original Ghostbuster and the secret legacy their grandfather left behind.

There's only one trusted person to play Janine Melnitz, so it made sense to connect with Potts for this Ghostbusters movie, too!
