        "text": "This is the year that Sundance maestro Robert Redford visits other people’s festivals in addition to his own. He went to Cannes in May with J.C. Chandor’s survival drama “All is Lost,” in which he gives a virtuosic solo performance. It was the first time a Sundance filmmaker asked Redford to star in a film. Then Redford schlepped to Telluride and New York. (Here’s our career profile.)\n\nNow the Santa Barbara International Film Festival will honor the actor/director/ producer–who nabbed a Best Actor nomination from the Golden Globes and a win from the New York Film Critics Circle –with the American Riviera Award.\n\nSBIFF established the American Riviera Award to recognize an actor who has had a strong influence on American Cinema. Past recipients include Quentin Tarantino (2013), Martin Scorsese (2012), Annette Bening (2011), Sandra Bullock (2010), Mickey Rourke (2009), Tommy Lee Jones (2008), Forrest Whitaker (2007), Philip Seymour Hoffman (2006), Kevin Bacon (2005) and Diane Lane (2004).\n\nRedford has pursued many things over his long career, from acting, producing and directing to ardent support of political causes, especially conservation and the environment. Redford’s enduring legacy will include establishing the Sundance Institute to nurture independents via filmmaker workshops and January’s Sundance Film festival. The Santa Barbara Fest runs Thursday, January 30 through Sunday, February 9, 2014. Redford will be feted on Friday, February 7, 2014 at the Arlington Theatre."
