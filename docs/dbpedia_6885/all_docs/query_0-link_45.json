        "text": "Ah, the Golden Globes. How I love that Hollywood Foreign Press Association - not corrupt at all!\n\nAll kidding aside (how can I not love the HFPA when it named Sally Kirkland Best Actress in 1987?), I am pumped for this year’s ceremony, in part because the awards season remains so unsettled. There isn’t a true shoo-in to be found among the acting races here, with only Best Animated Feature and Best Foreign Language Film sporting anything in the way of overwhelming favorites.\n\nThat said, my gut says Aaron Sorkin - a nine-time Globe nominee at this point - will see his film, The Trial of the Chicago 7, make the healthiest splash of the night. Mank, the nominations leader, is close behind - and I expect David Fincher to grab the Best Director prize - with Nomadland and perhaps even Promising Young Woman, both Director/Screenplay contenders, having at least some fighting chance up in Best Drama Picture.\n\nOddly enough, I fear Nomadland is liable to find itself shut out here. Frances McDormand could of course triumph but she isn’t exactly a HFPA favorite, having lost for both Fargo and Olive Kittredge. Given the overall affection for Promising Young Woman, I’m going with Carey Mulligan for the Best Drama Actress win. Likewise, considering the Drama Picture nomination for The Father and lukewarm reception for Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, I’ve got Anthony Hopkins taking the Best Drama Actor prize over Chadwick Boseman - though expect the latter to still triumph at the Oscars (after a SAG win)\n\nThe Musical/Comedy categories are an absolute wasteland this year (hi, Music) but might be more competitive and exciting than you’d think. Most seem convinced a Borat sweep is on the horizon and, while I’m inclined to agree both Maria Bakalova and Sacha Baron Cohen will emerge triumphant in their respective categories, I suspect a Hamilton upset may come to fruition for the top prize. Hell, even Lin-Manuel Miranda may block Cohen from scoring two trophies. Oh, and I still don’t think Bakalova makes the Oscar cut, even if it’s tough to picture her losing here.\n\nThe Supporting categories are also tough to forecast.\n\nSans Helena Zengel, a newcomer whose film wasn’t otherwise much embraced, I can see a case for any of the Best Supporting Actress nominees winning. Jodie Foster is a HFPA favorite whose film scored a surprise Drama Actor nom; Glenn Close remains spectacularly overdue for that Oscar and the Globes played a key role in bolstering her campaign for The Wife; and Amanda Seyfried graces the night’s nominations leader and sure seemed like the favorite here and elsewhere until that startling SAG snub.\n\nIn the end, given the love for The Father and her flawless track record with the Globes (thus far, at least), my money has to be on Olivia Colman - but she’s a soft front-runner.\n\nLikewise, I see Cohen as a very modest favorite in Best Supporting Actor, likely to only triumph if his film is taking the top prize. I fear it may not be Daniel Kaluuya or Leslie Odom, Jr., whose films missed in Drama Picture, who is Cohen’s greatest threat but rather surprise nominee Jared Leto, who inexplicably also surfaced at SAG and whose film (also inexplicably) has made several of the Oscar shortlists. Don’t be blindsided if he pulls this out.\n\nElsewhere, I do see Soul and Minari as the crystal-clear favorites in Animated Feature and Foreign Language Film. Expect Odom, Jr. to triumph in Best Original Song for his One Night in Miami tune, though Diane Warren cannot be entirely counted out for her The Life Ahead composition. Had Sophia Loren made the Drama Actress cut, I might be predicting her. Last but hardly least, Best Original Score looks like a jump ball between the two Trent Reznor-Atticus Ross contenders, with the trio of other nominees likely trailing far behind.\n\nBelow are my full rankings in each category. Who do you have winning?\n\nBest Motion Picture - Drama\n\nThe Trial of the Chicago 7\n\nMank\n\nNomadland\n\nPromising Young Woman\n\nThe Father\n\nBest Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy\n\nHamilton\n\nBorat Subsequent Moviefilm\n\nThe Prom\n\nPalm Springs\n\nMusic\n\nBest Director\n\nDavid Fincher, Mank\n\nChloe Zhao, Nomadland\n\nRegina King, One Night in Miami\n\nAaron Sorkin, The Trial of the Chicago 7\n\nEmerald Fennell, Promising Young Woman\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nAaron Sorkin, The Trial of the Chicago 7\n\nFlorian Zeller and Christopher Hampton, The Father\n\nEmerald Fennell, Promising Young Woman\n\nJack Fincher, Mank\n\nChloe Zhao, Nomadland\n\nBest Actress - Drama\n\nCarey Mulligan, Promising Young Woman\n\nFrances McDormand, Nomadland\n\nVanessa Kirby, Pieces of a Woman\n\nViola Davis, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom\n\nAndra Day, The United States vs. Billie Holiday\n\nBest Actor - Drama\n\nAnthony Hopkins, The Father\n\nChadwick Boseman, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom\n\nGary Oldman, Mank\n\nRiz Ahmed, Sound of Metal\n\nTahar Rahim, The Mauritanian\n\nBest Actress - Musical/Comedy\n\nMaria Bakalova, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer, French Exit\n\nKate Hudson, Music\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy, Emma\n\nRosamund Pike, I Care a Lot\n\nBest Actor - Musical/Comedy\n\nSacha Baron Cohen, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda, Hamilton\n\nAndy Samberg, Palm Springs\n\nJames Corden, The Prom\n\nDev Patel, The Personal History of David Copperfield\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nOlivia Colman, The Father\n\nAmanda Seyfried, Mank\n\nGlenn Close, Hillbilly Elegy\n\nJodie Foster, The Mauritanian\n\nHelena Zengel, News of the World\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nSacha Baron Cohen, The Trial of the Chicago 7\n\nJared Leto, The Little Things\n\nDaniel Kaluuya, Judas and the Black Messiah\n\nLeslie Odom, Jr., One Night in Miami\n\nBill Murray, On the Rocks\n\nBest Animated Feature\n\nSoul\n\nOver the Moon\n\nWolfwalkers\n\nOnward\n\nThe Croods: A New Age\n\nBest Foreign Language Film\n\nMinari\n\nAnother Round\n\nThe Life Ahead\n\nLa Llorona\n\nTwo of Us\n\nBest Original Score\n\nTrent Reznor and Atticus Ross, Mank\n\nTrent Reznor, Atticus Ross and Jon Batiste, Soul\n\nLudwig Goransson, Tenet\n\nJames Newton Howard, News of the World\n\nAlexandre Desplat, The Midnight Sky\n\nBest Original Song\n\n“Speak Now,” One Night in Miami\n\n“lo si (Seen),” The Life Ahead\n\n“Hear My Voice,” The Trial of the Chicago 7\n\n“Fight for You,” Judas and the Black Messiah\n\n“Tigress & Tweed,” The United States vs. Billie Holiday\n\nAt last!\n\nI haven’t made a set of awards season predictions since my stab at Oscar nominations back in September - a list that included the likes of C’mon, C’mon, The Humans and Respect, none of which ultimately scored qualifying runs for this cycle.\n\nI’m going to continue holding off on the Oscars until the Globes and SAG have had their say. With these nominations on the horizon next week, you know what time it is…TIME FOR PREDICTIONS!!\n\nFirst off, I feel reasonably confident these precursors will look at least a tad different from what the critics’ awards have thus far offered up.\n\nMank, for instance, didn’t exactly catch fire among the critics but expect the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to shower it with at least a modest showing of love. The HFPA may also be more inclined to embrace the likes of News of the World and especially Borat Subsequent Moviefilm and The Prom, the latter two taking advantage of the ghost towns that are this year’s Comedy/Musical categories. Likewise, over at SAG, the likes of Amy Adams and Glenn Close, headlining a film decidedly not adored by the critics, are liable to surface.\n\nThe likes of Paul Raci and Youn Yuh-jung have proven fierce contenders with the critics but are hardly shoo-ins with these voting bodies. And then there’s Maria Bakalova, who’s charged out of the starting gates as something of a Supporting Actress front-runner but will be contending in Lead at the Globes - and is no guarantee at SAG (or BAFTA after that).\n\nPictures like The Personal History of David Copperfield and Wild Mountain Thyme, neither of which have much in the way of momentum, may also take advantage of the barren nature of the Comedy/Musical lineups at the Globes - only to still have no prayer on Oscar noms morning.\n\nThere are also late-breaking contenders, like Judas and the Black Messiah and Malcolm and Marie, hoping to make a splash. The former’s Daniel Kaluuya appears destined for that second Oscar nom but it remains a question mark how much it’ll be embraced in other categories. And then there’s the latter film’s Zendaya and John David Washington, who’ve generated heaps of chatter for their robust turns but will need to overcome crowded categories and Malcolm and Marie’s otherwise mixed reviews.\n\nEven in a more slender season as this, these are tough races to forecast - and it’s easy to picture the Globes and SAG producing very different quintets in the acting fields, ultimately leaving it to BAFTA to provide some clarity.\n\nAnyway, here’s what I’m thinking goes down next week. Who do you have scoring GG/SAG glory?\n\nGolden Globes:\n\nBest Motion Picture - Drama\n\nNomadland\n\nDa 5 Bloods\n\nMa Rainey’s Black Bottom\n\nThe Trial of the Chicago 7\n\nMank\n\n—\n\nOne Night in Miami\n\nPromising Young Woman\n\nJudas and the Black Messiah\n\nNews of the World\n\nThe Father\n\nBest Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy\n\nThe Prom\n\nBorat Subsequent Moviefilm\n\nHamilton\n\nEmma\n\nThe Personal History of David Copperfield\n\n—\n\nWild Mountain Thyme\n\nPalm Springs\n\nThe King of Staten Island\n\nOn the Rocks\n\nEnola Holmes\n\nBest Director\n\nChloe Zhao, Nomadland\n\nSpike Lee, Da 5 Bloods\n\nDavid Fincher, Mank\n\nLee Isaac Chung, Minari\n\nRegina King, One Night in Miami\n\n—\n\nPaul Greengrass, News of the World\n\nAaron Sorkin, The Trial of the Chicago 7\n\nEmerald Fennell, Promising Young Woman\n\nGeorge C.

that maybe, just maybe, Joaquin Phoenix isn’t the only Joker nominee emerging triumphant at the Golden Globes.\n\nWith a Best Director nom for Todd Phillips, it’s painfully plausible that Best Picture and Best Original Score wins also come to fruition. Hell, even Phillips himself could perhaps prevail, leading to a Joker sweep. My head says this remains an unlikely scenario - and that it is Parasite that actually makes the most significant splash on the big night - but I am feeling a tad queasy.\n\nJoker fears aside, I suspect the Hollywood Foreign Press Association will be inclined to spread the love among this year’s awards season contenders. The Irishman, Marriage Story and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood should pick up a prize or two each but a commanding sweep from any of them seems like a stretch.\n\nThere are several legit barn burners in the acting races - Taron Egerton vs. Eddie Murphy is all but a coin flip, as is Scarlett Johansson vs. Renee Zellweger. And don’t you dare think anyone is a lock. Laura Dern and Brad Pitt, for instance, may be the front-runners in their respective categories but are hardly shoo-ins for victory. It’s plausible to imagine an upset like Margot Robbie or even, looking at the race in Best Screenplay, Anthony McCarten for The Two Popes.\n\nAll that said, here are my two cents on how the Globes will probably go down, from most to least likely to triumph…\n\nBest Motion Picture - Drama\n\nThe Irishman\n\nJoker\n\nMarriage Story\n\n1917\n\nThe Two Popes\n\nBest Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nJojo Rabbit\n\nKnives Out\n\nRocketman\n\nDolemite Is My Name\n\nBest Director\n\nBong Joon-ho, Parasite\n\nQuentin Tarantino, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nMartin Scorsese, The Irishman\n\nTodd Phillips, Joker\n\nSam Mendes, 1917\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nBong Joon-ho, Parasite\n\nQuentin Tarantino, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nAnthony McCarten, The Two Popes\n\nNoah Baumbach, Marriage Story\n\nSteven Zaillian, The Irishman\n\nBest Actress - Drama\n\nRenee Zellweger, Judy\n\nScarlett Johansson, Marriage Story\n\nSaoirse Ronan, Little Women\n\nCharlize Theron, Bombshell\n\nCynthia Erivo, Harriet\n\nBest Actor - Drama\n\nJoaquin Phoenix, Joker\n\nAdam Driver, Marriage Story\n\nAntonio Banderas, Pain and Glory\n\nJonathan Pryce, The Two Popes\n\nChristian Bale, Ford v Ferrari\n\nBest Actress - Musical/Comedy\n\nAwkwafina, The Farewell\n\nAna de Armas, Knives Out\n\nBeanie Feldstein, Booksmart\n\nEmma Thompson, Late Night\n\nCate Blanchett, Where’d You Go, Bernadette\n\nBest Actor - Musical/Comedy\n\nTaron Egerton, Rocketman\n\nEddie Murphy, Dolemite Is My Name\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nRoman Griffin Davis, Jojo Rabbit\n\nDaniel Craig, Knives Out\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nLaura Dern, Marriage Story\n\nJennifer Lopez, Hustlers\n\nMargot Robbie, Bombshell\n\nKathy Bates, Richard Jewell\n\nAnnette Bening, The Report\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nBrad Pitt, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nJoe Pesci, The Irishman\n\nAl Pacino, The Irishman\n\nAnthony Hopkins, The Two Popes\n\nTom Hanks, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\n\nBest Animated Feature\n\nFrozen II\n\nMissing Link\n\nToy Story 4\n\nThe Lion King\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World\n\nBest Foreign Language Film\n\nParasite\n\nThe Farewell\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire\n\nPain and Glory\n\nLes Miserables\n\nBest Original Score\n\nThomas Newman, 1917\n\nHildur Guðnadóttir, Joker\n\nAlexandre Desplat, Little Women\n\nRandy Newman, Marriage Story\n\nDaniel Pemberton, Motherless Brooklyn\n\nBest Original Song\n\n“I’m Gonna Love Me Again,” Rocketman\n\n“Into the Unknown,” Frozen II\n\n“Spirit,” The Lion King\n\n“Stand Up,” Harriet\n\n“Beautiful Ghosts,” Cats\n\nIt’s the most wonderful time of the year!\n\nYes, I sure do love the Golden Globes and SAG Awards - what human being, after all, wouldn’t be enamored with precursors that once gave Jodie Foster, Shirley MacLaine and Sigourney Weaver a Best Actress three-way tie or awards that bestowed recognition upon not only Nathan Lane but Hank Azaria too for The Birdcage?\n\nEspecially in a season this chaotic, expect no shortage of jaw-droppers, both on nominations morning and awards night.\n\nAt the Globes, beyond the expected showering of nominations on The Irishman and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, prepare for heaps of affection toward the likes of Jojo Rabbit and Joker too - even if they don’t make as heavy a splash later on with the Oscars. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association is liable to go gaga for the starry Little Women and generally goes bananas for a movie musical…even if it isn’t a good one (hello, Best Picture nominees The Phantom of the Opera and The Producers). Hence, even if Cats is a stinker, it could still make a nice showing here.\n\nDon’t be surprised if the SAG nominations look considerably different than what the Globes serve up.\n\nI’m keeping an especially close eye on Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress, where it’s so easy to see veterans like Alan Alda, John Lithgow and Maggie Smith emerge at SAG after Globe snubs.\n\nSpeaking of Dame Maggie, the SAG Awards used to eat up Downton Abbey in a huge way when it competed for television prizes, including three victories in the top Best Drama Ensemble category. If this at all translates to the film awards, it is completely plausible the film earns a Film Ensemble nom here. Keep an eye out too for real stunners like Elisabeth Moss (Her Smell) and Mary Kay Place (Diane), who could perhaps flabbergast awards season followers on a Sarah Silverman (I Smile Back)-level.\n\nOh, and Helen Mirren, GG/SAG/BAFTA nominee for Hitchcock, could easily land at either or both of these for The Good Liar.\n\nHappy predicting! :)\n\nGolden Globes:\n\nBest Motion Picture -

Truth be told, I don't feel terribly confident about most of these - the exceptions being Best Director, Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song, with the only true shoo-in of the evening landing in that middle category, for the unstoppable Coco.\n\nMy hunch is next Sunday will prove a strong evening for both The Shape of Water and Lady Bird, knocking the likes of The Post, Three Billboards and Get Out down a few rungs. It is hardly inconceivable, however, to think the Hollywood Foreign Press Association could fall for The Post and/or even go with Get Out in Musical/Comedy Picture, despite that one missing in both Director and Screenplay.\n\nWill Oscar front-runner Gary Oldman's past jabs at the Globes damage his chances here? I suspect so but then again, the HFPA sure does like to try predicting the Oscar winners (and Oldman will remain the Oscar front-runner, albeit a softer one, even if he does lose here).\n\nBoth Lead Actress categories are legit jump balls here, ditto Supporting Actress, where Allison Janney hopes to put a dent in Laurie Metcalf's front-runner status. And speaking of tough categories to forecast, there's Best Screenplay, where Globe favorite Aaron Sorkin could totally score another Steve Jobs-level upset with Molly's Game.\n\nOh, and don't you dare underestimate that dark horse Christopher Plummer down in Supporting Actor, especially with Oscar front-runner Willem Dafoe's film evidently not much resonating with the HFPA.\n\nAll that said, check out my predictions below, ranked from most to least likely to prevail.
