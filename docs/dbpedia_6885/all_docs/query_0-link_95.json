        "text": "Bohemian Rhapsody and Green Book took the top honours at the Golden Globes tonight.\n\nNow that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association has awarded their winners, we're getting a clearer view of the impending Oscar race. Bohemian Rhapsody took the top prize of the night, winning Best Motion Picture Drama. Green Book won in the comedy category, and both films now look to be sure-fire bets for a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars.\n\nWhile many predicted that Bradley Cooper would take the prize for his performance in A Star is Born, Rami Malek came out on top, winning for his portrayal of Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody. Christian Bale won Best Actor in a comedy for his shocking transformation as Dick Cheney in Vice. Glenn Close surprised with her win in the underseen film The Wife, while Olivia Colman won in the comedy category for playing a misbehaving queen in The Favourite.\n\nSee the full list of film winners at the Golden Globes below.\n\nBest Picture (Drama)\n\nBlack Panther\n\nBlacKkKlansman\n\nBohemian Rhapsody\n\nIf Beale Street Could Talk\n\nA Star Is Born\n\nBest Picture (Comedy or Musical)\n\nCrazy Rich Asians\n\nThe Favourite\n\nGreen Book\n\nMary Poppins Returns\n\nVice\n\nBest Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture (Drama)\n\nBradley Cooper, A Star Is Born\n\nWillem Dafoe, At Eternity’s Gate\n\nLucas Hedges, Boy Erased\n\nRami Malek, Bohemian Rhapsody\n\nJohn David Washington, BlacKkKlansman\n\nBest Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture (Drama)\n\nGlenn Close, The Wife\n\nLady Gaga, A Star Is Born\n\nNicole Kidman, Destroyer\n\nMelissa McCarthy, Can You Ever Forgive Me?\n\nRosamund Pike, A Private War\n\nBest Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy)\n\nChristian Bale, Vice\n\nLin Manuel Miranda, Mary Poppins Returns\n\nViggo Mortensen, Green Book\n\nRobert Redford, The Old Man & the Gun\n\nJohn C.
