        "text": "DUBAI: Robert Redford has a brand new accolade to add to his growing list of awards. The 18th edition of the Marrakech Film Festival honored iconic actor, producer and director on Friday.\n\nThe 83-year-old collected the Etoile d’Or—the career tribute award— for his outstanding contributions to the film industry.\n\nRedford, who made his foray into acting with a starring role in Broadway’s “Sunday in New York,” is best known for his portrayal of a skilled conman named Johnny Hooker in the 1973 comedy-crime drama “The Sting,” which went on to win seven Oscar awards.\n\nHe would go on to make his directorial debut in 1980, with the film “Ordinary People,” which earned him the Directors Guild of America Award, a Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Director.\n\nNotably, Redford is the founder of the Sundance Film Festival, an annual cinematic festival that takes place each January in Utah’s Salt Lake City.\n\nHe was honored alongside Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra, French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier and Moroccan actress Mouna Fettou, who served as the host of the annual film festival in 2006."
