        "text": "Rather than try to predict who the elusive Hollywood Foreign Press Association will honour at the 72nd Golden Globes ceremony, I decided it would be less embarrassing more fun to pretend to be a member of the HFPA and fill out my own ballot.\n\nHere’s how I would vote, if I could …\n\nThe one prediction I will allow myself is this: Hostesses Amy Poehler and Tina Fey will kill it. They’ve done it twice already, so this is not a bold prediction. But not only is this their swan song, Poehler and Fey both have projects to plug. Poehler’s Parks and Recreation (neither she nor the series are nominated in the TV comedy categories tonight) starts its farewell season on Tuesday; Fey’s Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt premières on Netflix on March 6; Fey and Poehler star in the comedy Sisters, due in theatres in Dec. 2015.\n\nThe Golden Globes are on NBC/CTV starting at 8 p.m. You can print your ballot via PopSugar and follow along on Twitter, where I will be live-tweeting and taking part in the Montreal Gazette‘s live blog. Get ready for whatever the hell this means:\n\nWinners of the Golden Globes are selected by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), a group of about 90 reporters who cover Hollywood and the entertainment industry for non-U.S., international publications. They’re often believed to be a precursor to the Academy Awards, but I disagree: the Golden Globes honour the best in film *and* television. Among the other differences: the Golden Globes are kind of a fancy dinner party, whereas the Academy Awards are more of a show and ceremony. The Golden Globes split categories for film and film acting into dramas and comedies; the Academy Awards honour technical, technological and behind-the-scenes teams, but the Golden Globes only honour talent you can see (and screenwriters, where adapted and original screenplays vie for one award – the Oscars give out an award for adapted and original screenplays separately, though I refer you to this great Grantland piece about some of the trouble with that).\n\nThe Golden Globes are fun to watch regardless of the many, many controversies surrounding the HFPA and their alleged less-than-kosher nominating criteria. This year should be no different with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler returning to host. Rather than try to predict who will take home Globes on Sunday, Jan. 12, I thought I would pretend to be a member of the HFPA and cast a ballot for my favourite nominees that I deem most deserving.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAziz Ansari, Olivia Wilde and Zoe Saldana announced the Golden Globe nominees this morning and while there were only a few surprises, the few omissions were startling.\n\nFirst, Lee Daniels’ The Butler received no nominations. Oprah Winfrey was overlooked in the best supporting actress – motion picture category in favour of Sally Hawkins in Blue Jasmine, June Squibb in Nebraska and expected nominees Julia Roberts (August: Osage County), Lupita Nyong’o (12 Years a Slave) and Jennifer Lawrence (American Hustle).\n\nForest Whitaker will also have to sit this one out. His work in The Butler wasn’t recognized in the best actor – motion picture drama category. Instead, the nominees were Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Idris Elba (Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom), Tom Hanks (Captain Phillips), Matthew McConaughey (Dallas Buyers Club) and Robert Redford (All is Lost).\n\nThe Butler director Lee Daniels could not crack the top 5 in that category. Instead, it will be Alfonso Cuaron (Gravity), Paul Greengrass (Captain Phillips), Steve McQueen (12 Years a Slave), Alexander Payne (Nebraska) or David O. Russell (American Hustle) who will be taking home the award on Jan. 12, 2014.\n\nContinue reading →"
