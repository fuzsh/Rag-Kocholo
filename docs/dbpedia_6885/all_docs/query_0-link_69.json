        "text": "The Lady Gaga-led remake of “A Star is Born” and the Dick Cheney biopic “Vice\" are among the films and television shows looking for gold on Sunday night.\n\nThe 76th annual Golden Globe Awards ceremony will be broadcast live on NBC on Sunday, Jan. 6, at 8 p.m. from Beverly Hills. “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” actor Andy Samberg and “Killing Eve” actress Sandra Oh will co-host the three-hour ceremony.\n\nFor years, the Golden Globes have been seen as a harbinger of the more prestigious Academy Awards.\n\nFor example, the two groups agreed on the choices for best actor (Gary Oldman), actress (Frances McDormand) and director (Guillermo del Toro) last year. However, the Golden Globes honored \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" (drama) and \"Ladybird\" (comedy) as best films in those categories, while the Oscar for best picture went to \"The Shape of Water.\"\n\nAcademy Award nominations will be announced on Jan. 22 and the Oscars bestowed on Feb. 24.\n\nThe Hollywood Foreign Press Association bestows its Golden Globe awards to the best in motion pictures and television. Winners are chosen by about 90 journalists and photographers from 55 countries.\n\nThis year, “Vice” earned six nominations, narrowly edging out the remake of “A Star is Born,” “Green Book” and “The Favourite,” all which scored five nods.\n\nUp for best picture, comedy, alongside “Vice” are “The Favourite,” “Green Book,” “Mary Poppins Returns” and “Crazy Rich Asians.” In the best picture, drama, category, the nominees are “A Star Is Born,” 'Black Panther,\" “BlacKkKlansman,” “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “If Beale Street Could Talk.”\n\nIn television categories, “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story” led the field with four nominations, including acting nods for Penelope Cruz and Darren Criss. Following behind with three nominations were “The Americans,” “Barry,\" “Homecoming,” “The Kominsky Method,\" ”The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” “Sharp Objects” and “A Very English Scandal.”\n\nThe Golden Globes will also include the bestowing of the prestigious Cecil B. DeMille Award to actor Jeff Bridges (“Crazy Heart,” “The Big Leblowski”).\n\nThere are 13 film categories and 11 for television awarded at the Golden Globes. The nominees are:\n\nMotion pictures\n\nBest Motion Picture – Drama\n\n\"Black Panther\"\n\n“BlackKklansman\"\n\n”Bohemian Rhapsody\"\n\n“If Beale Street Could Talk\"\n\n”A Star Is Born\"\n\nBest Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\n\n“Crazy Rich Asians”\n\n“The Favorite\"\n\n”Green Book\"\n\n“Mary Poppins\"\n\n”Vice\"\n\nBest Motion Picture – Animated\n\n\"Incredibles 2\"\n\n“Isle of Dogs\"\n\n”Mirai\"\n\n“Ralph Breaks the Internet\"\n\n”Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\"\n\nBest Motion Picture – Foreign Language\n\n\"Capernaum\"\n\n“Girl\"\n\n”Never Look Away\"\n\n“Roma\"\n\n”Shoplifters\"\n\nBest Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama\n\nGlenn Close (\"The Wife\")\n\nLady Gaga (“A Star Is Born”)\n\nNicole Kidman (“Destroyer”)\n\nMelissa McCarthy (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?”)\n\nRosamund Pike (“A Private War”)\n\nBest Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama\n\nBradley Cooper (\"A Star Is Born\")\n\nWillem Dafoe (“At Eternity’s Gate”)\n\nLucas Hedges (“Boy Erased”)\n\nRami Malek (“Bohemian Rhapsody”)\n\nJohn David Washington (“BlacKkKlansman”)\n\nBest Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\n\nEmily Blunt (\"Mary Poppins Returns\")\n\nOlivia Colman (“The Favourite”)\n\nElsie Fisher (“Eighth Grade”)\n\nCharlize Theron (“Tully”)\n\nConstance Wu (“Crazy Rich Asians”)\n\nBest Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\n\nChristian Bale (\"Vice\")\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda (“Mary Poppins Returns”)\n\nViggo Mortensen (“Green Book”)\n\nRobert Redford (“The Old Man & the Gun”)\n\nJohn C.
