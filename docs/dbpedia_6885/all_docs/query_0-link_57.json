        "text": "Five days after a devastating earthquake struck Los Angeles, the folks in Hollywood did exactly what was expected of them: they put on their best clothes and went to an awards party.\n\nThe 51st annual Golden Globes presentations on Saturday night, an annual rite that is often predictive of the Academy Awards, was gripped this year by the impact of last Monday morning's earthquake. Some expected guests, like Kirstie Alley and Arsenio Hall, canceled because their homes were severely damaged. Others, like Debra Winger and Tim Robbins, chose not to fly in from New York.
