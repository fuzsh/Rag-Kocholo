See how the ceremony has changed.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Golden Globes were first held in 1944 by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a band of writers that came together in 1943.\n\nThe first ceremony was held at 20th Century Fox. It then moved around for two decades until finding its permanent home, the Beverly Hills Hilton, in 1961.\n\nThe award ceremony became more glamorous as time went on. By the 20th Golden Globes, the stage looked more like the one we see today.\n\nThe 2024 Golden Globes will be held on January 7 and will air on CBS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of Hollywood's best and brightest of the time attended the awards. In 1952, Barbara Stanwyck chatted with fellow screen icon Gilbert Roland.\n\nRoland was nominated the following year for his part in \"The Bad and The Beautiful.\"\n\nStanwyck wouldn't receive a Golden Globe nomination until 1966, and she was given the Cecil B. DeMille Award, a lifetime achievement award, in 1986.\n\nThe Golden Globes' lifetime achievement award is called the Cecil B. DeMille Award. Below is the man himself talking to French actor Corinne Calvet in 1952, the first year the honor was awarded.\n\nDeMille is known for directing and producing some of the most famous films of all time, including \"The Ten Commandments,\" \"Cleopatra,\" and \"The Greatest Show on Earth.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Golden Globes are known as the \"fun\" awards show because alcohol is famously served at every table.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, over 7,500 glasses of champagne are normally consumed over the course of the night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd since the attendees are seated at tables, not in rows, there are more opportunities for mingling.\n\nIt leads to iconic table-mates like Judy Garland and Marlon Brando, who sat next to each other at the 1955 awards.\n\nThey both took home statues that night: she for best actress in \"A Star is Born\" and he for best actor in \"On the Waterfront.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShirley MacLaine embodied old Hollywood glamour at the 1955 awards.\n\nMacLaine is part of a Hollywood dynasty — her brother is Warren Beatty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven future royalty appeared, like Grace Kelly.\n\nKelly won the now-discontinued award for world film favorite (female) in 1956.\n\nShe retired from acting that same year when she married Prince Rainier III of Monaco and became the Princess Consort of Monaco.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou never know which celebrities might end up sitting together.\n\nIn 2024, this would be the equivalent of DeuxMoi sitting with George and Amal Clooney ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElizabeth Taylor, her third husband, Mike Todd, and her future fourth husband, Eddie Fisher, rubbed elbows at the 1958 awards.\n\nThe 1958 awards were held in February. Todd died one month later in a plane crash.\n\nWhile grieving, Taylor and Fisher, one of Todd's best friends, began an affair, leading to the divorce of Hollywood golden couple Fisher and Debbie Reynolds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJayne Mansfield and Mickey Hargitay also attended in 1958.\n\nThese two have a famous daughter of their own, Mariska Hargitay, who is best known as Olivia Benson of \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarilyn Monroe looked every bit the '60s starlet at the 1962 awards.\n\nThat same year, she won her fourth and final Golden Globe, for world film favorite (female). Previously, Monroe won the best young box office personality in 1951 and the world film favorite (female) in 1953. She died just five months later, in August 1962.\n\nLast year, Ana de Armas was nominated for best actress in a motion picture (drama) for playing Monroe in \"Blonde.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother iconic old Hollywood duo seen at the awards was Dean Martin and John Wayne.\n\nWayne held Martin's drink as the singer/actor presented a Golden Globe during the show.\n\nAccording to Getty Images, Dean quickly got back his drink after making the presentation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJulie Andrews is a Golden Globes queen. One of the most iconic moments in award-show history was when she famously shaded Jack Warner, the man who didn't cast her in \"My Fair Lady.\"\n\nThis was one of the biggest conflicts in Hollywood history.\n\nWhen the stage musical \"My Fair Lady\" was made into a movie, Jack Warner, head of Warner Bros. studios, decided to cast Audrey Hepburn as the lead, even though Andrews had played the role on Broadway and in London.\n\nThis snub proved to be a blessing, as it freed up Andrews for what might be her most iconic role of all time: Mary Poppins.\n\nWhen Andrews won her Golden Globe in 1965, she thanked \"the man who made all this possible in the first place, Mr. Jack Warner.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's also a big night for couples. Just ask Mark Hamill and his wife, Marilou York.\n\nThe \"Star Wars\" star and his wife have been married for more than 40 years.\n\nOr Sonny and Cher.\n\nThe duo's show, \"The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour,\" was nominated for best television series musical or comedy in both 1973 and 1974.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNatalie Wood and Robert Redford caught up at the 1966 ceremony.\n\nWood and Redford met in high school and starred in a few movies together, such as 1966's \"This Property Is Condemned,\" according to an appearance by Redford on Turner Classic Movies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome stars take their parents. It helps if your dad is a living legend like Henry Fonda, seen here with his daughter, Jane.\n\nThis father-daughter duo would team up two years later to film Henry's last on-screen role, 1981's \"On Golden Pond.\"\n\nJane was awarded the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Golden Globes can be kid-friendly, too. Here's a 15-year-old Michael Jackson with his father.\n\nThe Jackson 5's album \"Skywriter\" was released in 1973.\n\nBut usually, it's a night filled with love between A-listers like Doris Day and Rock Hudson.\n\nHudson and Day were both chosen as the \"world's favorite performers\" multiple times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristopher Reeve attended the 36th annual Golden Globe Awards with his partner, Gae Exton.\n\nWe'll see if anyone makes a red-carpet debut on Sunday.\n\nIt's also interesting to look back at some of the most iconic actors of all time when they were just starting out. Back in 1968, Dustin Hoffman won the now-defunct award for new star of the year.\n\nHoffman won for his breakthrough performance in \"The Graduate\" over 50 years ago when he was 30 years old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarbra Streisand won her first Golden Globe for her performance in \"Funny Girl\" in 1969.\n\nAt 27 years old, it was her first Golden Globe nomination and win.\n\nNow, Streisand is one of a few people to have received an EGOT — an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Award — though not all of them were competitive awards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nHollywood Movies\n\nAdvertisement"
