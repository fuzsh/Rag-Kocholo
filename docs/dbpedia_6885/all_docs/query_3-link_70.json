        "text": "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — “American Hustle” left a messy Golden Globes as the big winner on Sunday, capturing three major awards, including best comedy. But voters stayed true to form and spread their love around, handing best drama to an otherwise ignored “12 Years a Slave” and best director to Alfonso Cuarón, for “Gravity.”\n\nThe two female stars of “American Hustle,” Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence, both picked up acting awards. Ms. Lawrence beat out Lupita Nyong’o of “12 Years a Slave,” who was viewed as the leading contender, in the supporting actress category. “I don’t know why I’m so scared,” said a shaking Ms. Lawrence.\n\nNot long afterward, Ms. Adams captured the best actress prize.\n\n“Dallas Buyers Club” received two acting prizes, for Jared Leto as supporting actor and for the heavily campaigned Matthew McConaughey as best actor in a drama. Woody Allen’s “Blue Jasmine” won a best actress award for Cate Blanchett, and Mr. Allen took home the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award, though he was predictably absent from the ceremony.\n\nGlobes voters even found room for Leonardo DiCaprio — even if they had to stretch.\n\n“I never would have guessed that I would have won for best actor in a comedy,” said Mr. DiCaprio, who won best actor for his performance in the rather grim “The Wolf of Wall Street.”"
