        "text": "“Vice” led the nominations for the 2019 Golden Globe Awards with six nominations, including best actor, best actress and best director nods, though the film about former Vice President Dick Cheney did not pick up a nomination for best picture. “Green Book,” “The Favourite” and “A Star is Born” tied with five nominations, while “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story” led in the TV categories, with four nominations.\n\nThe Hollywood Foreign Press Association announced the nominations for the 2019 Golden Globe Awards on Thursday morning. Terry Crews, Danai Gurira, Leslie Mann and Christian Slater joined HFPA President Meher Tatna, executive producer Barry Adelman and Isan Elba, daughter of Idris Elba and this year’s Golden Globe ambassador, to make the announcement.\n\nTatna announced that the Globes will have a new award that will “recognize the highest level of achievement in [television],” similar to the Globes’ Cecil B. DeMille Award. She said that honorees will be selected based on their accomplishments and influence on the television industry.\n\nThe nominations announcement kicked off with a minor hiccup when she said that Christian Slater would be announcing the first awards. Slater prematurely took the stage and said, “I heard my name and I jumped up!” before sitting back down. He returned to announce the first nominations.\n\nNBC announced on Wednesday that “Killing Eve” star Sandra Oh and “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” star Andy Samberg will co-host the 76th Annual Golden Globe Awards. The Golden Globes are set to air live on January 6 on NBC at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT from the Beverly Hilton.\n\nThe Golden Globes kick off the race to the Oscars.
