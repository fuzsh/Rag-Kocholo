        "text": "Robert Redford, who says he retired from acting after The Old Man & The Gun, received a Golden Globe Award nomination Thursday for the film shot in Cincinnati, Northern Kentucky and Southwestern Ohio in 2017.\n\nHe was nominated for best actor in a motion picture – musical or comedy along with Lin-Manuel Miranda (Mary Poppins Returns), Christian Bale (Vice), Viggo Mortensen (Green Book) and John C. Reilly (Stan & Ollie).\n\nRedford, 82, has won four Golden Globes acting awards in his illustrious career – but none in nearly 40 years – and never won an Oscar for acting.\n\nHe was the \"Most Promising Newcomer\" male actor in 1965 for Inside Daisy Clover, and won three World Film Favorite male actor awards (1977, 1978, 1981). Redford also has best director awards for Ordinary People from the Golden Globes and Academy Awards in 1981, and honorary career achievement awards from the Golden Globes (1994) and Academy Awards (2002).\n\nIn the film – released in September and based on a New York magazine article – Redford plays real-life bank robber Forrest Tucker, who escaped from San Quentin at the age of 70. Director David Lowery started filming here in April 2017 with Redford, Casey Affleck, Sissy Spacek, Danny Glover, Elisabeth Moss, Tiki Sumpter and singer Tom Waits.\n\nVice, the movie about former Vice President Dick Cheney, led all films with six nominations, including best picture musical or comedy. A Star Is Born, Green Book and The Favourite each received five nominations.\n\nOther best picture musical or comedy nominations went to Mary Poppins Returns, The Favourite, Green Book and Crazy Rich Asians.\n\nUp for best drama picture are A Star Is Born, Black Panther, BlacKKKlansman, Bohemian Rhapsody and If Beale Street Could Talk."
