        "text": "Industry\n\nActors and Environmentalism\n\nRod Steiger, Golden Globe winner for his role as a tough-talking Sheriff in In the Heat of the Night, was also known for his sarcasm in private life. “Actors sense that the wealth and adoration they enjoy for practically doing nothing is undeserved”, he said in a conversation with the HFPA.\n\nFilm\n\nRobert Redford Onscreen\n\nA legend turns 85. Robert Redford, born in Santa Monica when it was still a sleepy little beach town, found his voice as an actor and director early on, buoyed by the politics of the 1960s and 70s and by making smart choices throughout his career.\n\nGolden Globe Awards\n\nRobert Redford\n\nHe has been a movie star for so long that it never occurred to us that one day he might stop acting. So, it came as sort of a shock earlier this year when 82-year-old Robert Redford revealed that The Old Man & the Gun would be his last film as an actor, after a glorious career spanning 60 years.\n\nInterviews\n\nRobert Redford on “The Old Man & the Gun”\n\nRobert Redford is part of the history of Hollywood, that much is beyond dispute. In his way the 83 year old actor, producer and director has also made a mark on Golden Globe history with five wins in four categories – although curiously none of them Best Actor (bonus points for best guesses: trivia answer here).\n\nMusic\n\nOn Music: Robert Redford, a True Believer, Not Quite Saying Goodbye\n\nThe OId Man and the Gun was announced as Robert Redford’s last movie as an actor. “I will stay in the business as a director and producer,” he assured us, adding that he never said, “This is my last movie.\n\nFestivals\n\nRedford Opens Sundance With Nod to Women, Journalism And Truth\n\nSundance 2018 officially got underway with that time-honored ritual: the opening day press conference with founder and figurehead Robert Redford was joined on stage by Sundance Festival programmer John Cooper and Sundance Institute director Keri Putnam. Some of the proceedings were familiar to anyone who has trekked up Heber Pass to attend the festival before.\n\nFestivals\n\nVenice Celebrates Jane Fonda and Robert Redford, ‘the Best of Hollywood’\n\nThe Palazzo del Cinema crowd gave what seemed an interminable standing ovation to Robert Redford and Jane Fonda, as they were called onto the stage by Festival Director Alberto Barbera to receive the Golden Lion. It was the first time in the festival’s history that the career prize was given to two filmmakers at the same time, and never could it have been more appropriate."
