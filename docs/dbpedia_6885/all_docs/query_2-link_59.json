        "text": "Best party of the year! Best chance to see a tipsy acceptance speech! \"Best friends!\" says Andy Samberg of his co-host, Sandra Oh, in a promo for Sunday night's Golden Globes broadcast on NBC.\n\n\"We just met,\" replies Oh, cutting through the hype.\n\nThat's the best thing about the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's annual extravaganza. Unlike high-stakes, anxiety-laced award shows like the Oscars and Emmys, the stars have fun at the Globes.\n\nIt's an irreverent evening that covers both movies and television, skips the technical categories, and has an open bar for the assembled VIPs. The unexpected actually happens here. And that usually makes for great live TV.\n\nMore: Golden Globes 2019: Who got nominated? Here's the full list\n\nIn anticipation of what could occur, we've scoped out 10 possible shockers, er, surprises, er, things we'd like to see besides Idris Elba appearing as a presenter (he's already confirmed and ready to induce swoons).\n\n1. 'A Star Is Born' clean sweep\n\nThe latest reboot of the boy gets girl, girl gets fame, boy can't cope saga is up for five awards. Judging from the early predictions, it could score a landslide. A five-for-five outcome would make it the instant Academy Awards front-runner. And the man behind the massive hit, Bradley Cooper, would become the new king of Hollywood.\n\n2. 'Black Panther' roars back\n\nWhy, exactly, does the best motion picture drama category contains two musicals, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"A Star Is Born\"? Well, the Globes are wacky that way. It would be nice if the statuette went to the Marvel film that opened way back in February. Remember how it brought socio-political depth, impeccable style and flawless action to the superhero genre? Wakanda forever and, hopefully, this Sunday at the Beverly Hilton, too.\n\n3. Glenn defeats Gaga\n\nAn acting newcomer with a superstar singing career and worldwide fan base seems like a shoo-in for foreign press accolades. But even Lady Gaga's charisma in \"A Star Is Born\" can't compete with the subtle, wounded, defiant performance of Glenn Close in \"The Wife.\" Close packs a lifetime of repressed anger into a single scene as she watches her famous author husband accept his Nobel Prize. We're in awe of her brilliance. Make her best actress in a drama already.\n\n4. Rami rocks the odds\n\nOf the three relative newbies in the running for best actor in a motion picture drama, Rami Malek has a better shot than either Lucas Hedges (\"Boy Erased\") or John David Washington (\"BlacKkKlansman\") of toppling the likely winner Bradley Cooper, who got all grungy as a hard-living country singer in \"A Star Is Born.\" Brad's not bad, but channeling Freddy Mercury in \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" could make Malek the champion, my friends.\n\n5. A win for a crazy rich crowd-pleaser\n\nThe best movie musical or comedy prize could go to laugh riot \"Vice\" (if by laughs you mean a tragic history of misguided U.S. policies that led to the Iraq War). But while \"Vice\" has the most nods this year with six, \"Vice\" lags behind \"Crazy Rich Asians\" in terms of box office power (it earned $174 million domestically, about $23 million so far for \"Vice\"). Plus, \"Crazy Rich Asians\" has had meaningful impact on the industry's inclusivity; it's the first big Hollywood film with a majority Asian cast since 1993's \"Joy Luck Club.\" Besides, where would you rather go, to Araminta's fabulous $40 million wedding or to Dick Cheney's undisclosed location?\n\n6. Let's hear it for the old man\n\nIn 1966, the now-defunct most promising newcomer award at the Globes went to a handsome guy named Robert Redford for \"Inside Daisy Clover.\" Until this year, Redford has competed only one other time at the Globes for his acting (for 2013's \"All Is Lost\"). Despite a career packed with directing and lifetime achievement prizes, he's never nabbed an Oscar, an Emmy, or a G.G. for his acting. What better time to gift the 82-year-old legend than now, especially given his poignant charm as a senior-citizen bank robber in \"The Old Man & The Gun\"?\n\n7. Spike Lee nabs best director\n\n\"BlacKkKlansman\" represents Lee at his provocative best, combining humor and outrage in the based-on-real-life story of an African-American cop who infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan. It would be a wow moment to see him rewarded for spreading the message that racism persists and must be confronted.\n\n8. 'Pose' makes history\n\nRyan Murphy's FX drama broke barriers by casting five transgender women of color as cast regulars. Then it became the first series with a mostly trans cast to receive Globes nominations. A win here would be as spectacular as the 1980s New York City ballroom culture portrayed in the series.\n\n9. Jeff Bridges abides\n\nThe veteran star of \"The Big Lebowski,\" \"Crazy Heart\" and \"The Fabulous Baker Boys\" will be honored with the Cecil B. DeMille award for lifetime achievement. Also, Carol Burnett will pick up the first-ever lifetime achievement award for TV. While Burnett is bound to be graciously coherent, we're rooting for a mystical miasma of rambling from Bridges, who continues at age 69 to embody the laid-back groove of the Dude in \"Lebowski.\"\n\n10. Kristen Bell finally gets her due\n\nIf University of Michigan alum Darren Criss wins for best actor in a limited series or TV movie for FX's â€œThe Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story,\" we will applaud warmly. But if Kristen Bell gets best actress in a TV musical or comedy for NBC's \"The Good Place,\" we'll be forking ecstatic. It would be the first big-time award for the metro Detroit native, who's been \"Frozen\" out of the winner's circle for too long. Get it?\n\n'2019 Golden Globe Awards'\n\n8 p.m. Sun.\n\nNBC\n\nContact Detroit Free Press pop culture critic Julie Hinds: 313-222-6427 or jhinds@freepress.com."
