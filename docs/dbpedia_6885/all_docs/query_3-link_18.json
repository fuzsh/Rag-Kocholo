        "text": "Jane Fonda and Robert Redford will be honored with Golden Lions for Lifetime Achievement at the 74th Venice International Film Festival on Sept. 1 at the Palazzo del Cinema.\n\nAfter the awards ceremony, the festival will screen the world premiere of Netflix film Our Souls at Night by Ritesh Batra, starring Fonda and Redford and produced by Redford and his company Wildwood Enterprises, organizers said Monday.\n\nOur Souls at Night is a Colorado-set film about two neighbors who meet after decades of living in the same small town with very little contact.\n\nActress and producer Fonda also has an honorary Palme d’Or, as well as two Academy Awards (for best actress in 1971 for Klute and in 1978 for Coming Home), three Golden Globes and an AFI Life Achievement Award.\n\nNoted environmentalist, actor, director and producer Redford, in addition to founding the Sundance Institute, has won a Directors Guild of America Award, a Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for best director for his feature film directorial debut Ordinary People. He has also won six Golden Globes and in 2012 won the Venice Film Festival’s Open Prize and Vittorio Veneto Award for The Company You Keep.\n\nThe 74th Venice International Film Festival takes place Aug. 30-Sept. 9."
