        "text": "Robert Redford is part of the history of Hollywood, that much is beyond dispute. In his way the 83 year old actor, producer and director has also made a mark on Golden Globe history with five wins in four categories – although curiously none of them Best Actor (bonus points for best guesses: trivia answer here). After a career spanning six decades which has also seen him establish the Sundance Institute and the most important festival in the US, Redford has announced his retirement from acting (although he has subsequently appeared to retract the finality of that decision). Whether it is his last on-screen appearance or not, his role in David Lowery’s The Old Man and the Gun is reason to celebrate the continuing work of one of Hollywood’s greats. The HFPA’ Paz Mata asked him why he was attracted to this particular misfit."
