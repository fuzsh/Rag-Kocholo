They will join Todd Haynes, the previously announced Director Tribute recipient. The affair is set for November 30 at Cipriani Wall Street in NYC.\n\n“We are thrilled to recognize the careers and achievements of such lauded industry veterans as Robert Redford, Helen Mirren, and Steve Golin as part of our 25th anniversary celebrations,” said Joana Vicente, Executive Director of IFP and the Made in NY Media Center. “To celebrate these individuals who have contributed so much to the independent film community and to the entertainment world at large — and in such a landmark year for the Gothams — is truly an honor.”\n\nMirren’s and Redford’s accomplishments are well-known — most recently starring in Woman In Gold, Eye In The Sky and Trumbo and A Walk In The Woods and Truth, respectively — as are Golin’s within the music, film and TV businesses. His upcoming films as co-producer include Spotlight and The Revenant, and he’s exec producer on HBO’s True Detective and USA Network’s Mr. Robot."
