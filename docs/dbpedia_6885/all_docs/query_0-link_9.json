        "text": "From lighting to set choice to casting, artful and meticulous directors are the reason we have epic films such as The Godfather, Titanic and It Happened One Night that stand the test of time.\n\nBest Director at the Academy Awards is a field that has celebrated some of the most iconic people in film, including the Coen brothers, Ang Lee and Steven Spielberg. But it is not without controversy: over 95 Oscars ceremonies, only eight women have been nominated, and just three have won, the first in 2009.\n\nHere, a rundown of every Best Director Oscar winner since the inception of the Academy Awards in 1929.\n\n2024: Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer\n\nOppenheimer won big at the 2024 Oscars, including in the Best Director category, where Christopher Nolan picked up his first award.\n\n2023: Daniel Kwan & Daniel Scheinert, Everything Everywhere All at Once\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once and its directors Kwan and Scheinert took home seven awards during the 2023 ceremony, the most of any film that year.\n\n2022: Jane Campion, Power of the Dog\n\nBecoming the third woman in Academy Awards history to win Best Director, Jane Campion snagged the Oscar for her modern-day Western at the 2022 ceremony.\n\nCampion also made history when she was nominated, as she became the first woman to be nominated twice for Best Director — her first nod was in 1993 for The Piano. Though she didn't win then, she did take home the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for that film.\n\n2021: Chloé Zhao, Nomadland\n\nIn another history-making win, not only was Zhao the second woman to ever win in the category, but she was the first Asian woman to take an Oscar for directing.\n\n2020: Bong Joon Ho, Parasite\n\n\"Once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,\" said South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho when he accepted the Golden Globe for best motion picture, foreign language in 2020.\n\nAt the Oscars that same year, he gave another touching speech, thanking and acknowledging his fellow nominees — Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Sam Mendes and Todd Phillips — for their inspiration.\n\n2019: Alfonso Cuarón, Roma\n\nThis touching film, inspired by Cuarón's own upbringing, was a black-and-white picture that highlighted the class differences in Mexican culture.\n\n2018: Guillermo Del Toro, The Shape of Water\n\nGoing into the 90th Academy Awards in 2018, Del Toro's The Shape of Water had a staggering 13 nominations and snagged four trophies, for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Score and Best Production Design.\n\n2017: Damien Chazelle, La La Land\n\nAny man who can get Ryan Gosling to break out in those dance moves certainly deserves to be awarded! Chazelle's La La Land was a big hit when it came out, and at the Academy Awards in 2017, it also won Best Cinematography, Best Original Song and Best Production Design in addition to Best Actress for Emma Stone.\n\n2016: Alejandro González Iñárritu, The Revenant\n\nIñarritu took home the prestigious award for the second year in a row. Not only was this the film that got Leonardo DiCaprio his long-awaited Oscar, but The Revenant, which was based on the true story of explorer Hugh Glass, also won the award for Best Cinematography.\n\n2015: Alejandro González Iñárritu, Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\n\nStarring powerhouses such as Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Zach Galifianakis, it's no wonder Birdman was a hit.

This allowed the CGI team to mimic a Bengal tiger's real mannerisms without putting a young Suraj Sharma, who played Pi Patel, in danger.\n\n\"We didn't want our actor to get eaten,\" visual effects supervisor Bill Westenhofer told the New York Times. \"It set our bar high for CGI. We couldn't cheat at all. It pushed the artists to go and deliver something that's never been done before, something as photo-real as anyone has ever done with an animal.\" For their efforts, the team also walked away with the Academy Award for Best Achievement in Visual Effects, Best Cinematography and Best Original Score, in addition to Best Director.\n\n2012: Michel Hazanavicius, The Artist\n\nSure, Hazanavicius, Bérénice Bejo, Jean Dujardin and John Goodman delivered some incredible work, but the real star of this film was Uggie, the adorable Jack Russell Terrier who was their four-legged collaborator.\n\nIn addition to Best Director, The Artist also won Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Costume Design and Best Original Score.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up forPEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up to date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n2011: Tom Hooper, The King's Speech\n\nAnother film that had critics and audiences buzzing, The King's Speech had a staggering 12 nominations in 2011, and took two additional trophies on top of Hooper's win for Best Director: Colin Firth was named Best Actor and David Seidler won for Best Original Screenplay.\n\n2010: Kathryn Bigelow, The Hurt Locker\n\nKathryn Bigelow made Academy Awards history when she became the first woman to win Best Director with her gripping thriller in 2010.
