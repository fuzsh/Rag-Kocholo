        "text": "Multiple Oscar-winning feature (including best film) from 1974, The Sting is a light, witty crime drama where character development is almost as important as plot lines (but hardly surprising considering director George Roy Hill secured Paul Newman and Robert Redford as leads).\n\nTwo bit conman Johnny Hooker (Redford) joins forces with fellow-grifter Henry Gondorff (Newman) to swindle crime boss Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw). Gondorff is in it for the money, Redford revenge for the killing of partner and friend, Luther Coleman (Robert Earl Jones). A fabulously complicated long-con scheme evolves incorporating any number of other con artists as Lonnegan and corrupt local Chicago police are targeted.\n\nThe stakes are high in Hill’s enjoyable 1930s-set caper with Newman and Redford oozing charm, making it (according to critics) one of the most popular Oscar-winning films of all-time.\n\nRating: 72%\n\nDirector: George Roy Hill (Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid, Slap Shot)\n\nWriter: David S. Ward (Sleepless in Seattle, Steelyard Blues)\n\nMain cast: Robert Redford (Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid, The Natural), Paul Newman (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Hud), Robert Shaw (Jaws, A Man For All Seasons)\n\nA gripping account of investigative journalism as two reporters uncover the details of Watergate, struggling initially to even convince colleagues at The Washington Post.\n\nDogged and determined, Bob Woodward (Robert Redford – The Sting, Truth) picks up a seemingly minor story of a break-in at the offices of the Democrats in the Watergate building. As the story escalates, he’s paired with the more experienced Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman – The Graduate, Rainman). Procedural investigations, cloak and dagger meetings along with cajoling of sources reveal a conspiracy beyond the wildest dreams of the two reporters and executive editor of the newspaper, Ben Bradlee (Jason Robards – Julia, Magnolia).\n\nBy underplaying the outcome and focussing on the two reporters, director Alan J. Pakula (Sophie’s Choice, Klute) creates a thrilling detective story and purist observation of old-fashioned journalism in pre-internet days. An intelligent and effective telling of the reveal.\n\nNominated for 8 Oscars in 1977 including best film, director, supporting actress (Jane Alexander), won 4 – best supporting actor (Robards), adapted screenplay (William Goldman), art direction, sound.\n\nRating: 78%\n\nPerfect accompaniment to miniseries Gaslit\n\nBased loosely on a true story, Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) heads a group of outlaws – the Hole-in-the-Wall-Gang – in early 1900s Wyoming. But the boys rob one train too many – with Union Pacific railroad boss, EH Harriman, paying a posse to remain on their trail until Butch and marksman Sundance (Robert Redford) are both killed. The two avoid capture but, recognising their days are numbered if they stay, head to Bolivia with Sundance’s girlfriend, Etta Place (Katharine Ross) to seek their fortunes.\n\nDirected by George Roy Hill, Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid, with the iconic song Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head and its pairing of Newman and Redford, has gone down in the annals of Hollywood history. Yet it’s not very good! The chemistry between the two leads carry what is a lighweight adventure yarn that develops into a slow, ponderous narrative. It looks good (cinematographer Conrad L. Hall) but with an almost slapstick, vaudevillian period in South America, the film just trails off into disinterest.\n\nNominated for 7 Oscars in 1970 including best film, director, sound – won 4 for original screenplay, cinematography, soundtrack, song.\n\nRating: 50%\n\nDirector: George Roy Hill (The Sting, Thoroughly Modern Millie)\n\nWriter: William Goldman (All the President’s Men, The Princess Bride)\n\nMain cast: Paul Newman (Hud, Cat of a Hot Tin Roof), Robert Redford (The Sting, The Natural), Katharine Ross (The Graduate, The Stepford Wives)\n\nCaptain America continues to struggle to adapt to the 21st century as S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised with the assassination of Operations Chief, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). But the Cap and Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are not convinced that everything at HQ is as it should be as CEO Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) looks to launch the latest airborne weaponry.\n\nEssentially an earthbound adventure yarn with the fractured Avengers still licking their post-New York wounds as the spectre of Hydra rears its ugly head. And it becomes something considerably more personal for Captain America (Chris Evans) when the identity of the fabled Winter Soldier is revealed.\n\nNominated for the 2015 best visual effects Oscar.\n\nRating: 59%\n\nDirector: Anthony Russo (You, Me and Dupree, Welcome to Collinwood), Joe Russo (You, Me and Dupree, Welcome to Collinwood)\n\nWriter: Christopher Markus (Captain America: the First Avenger, Pain & Gain), Stephen McFeely (Captain America: the First Avenger, Pain & Gain)\n\nMain cast: Chris Evans (The Avengers, The Red Sea Diving Resort), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow, Lost in Translation), Samuel L. Jackson (The Avengers, Pulp Fiction)\n\nDirected by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, it’s a welcome sombre note to the Marvel proceedings, particularly after the wall-to-wall battles of last year’s Avengers: Infinity War.\n\nAfter the defeat by Thanos (Josh Brolin) and destruction of half the world’s population, the surviving Avengers are (mostly) unsurprisingly resigned and introspective – even Iron Man himself (Robert Downey Jnr) has settled into an idyllic familial rural lifestyle. But the sudden ‘spitting out’ of Ant Man (a very funny Paul Rudd) from the quantum realm changes everything.\n\nIt’s a fittingly gargantuan and fabulously grandiose conclusion of 21 Marvel films – but with its humour, pathos and not too much reliance on excessive battles, the result is Avengers: Endgame is suitably one of the best.\n\nNominated or 1 Oscar in 2020 (visual effects).\n\nRating: 62%\n\nDirector: Anthony Russo (Captain America: Civil War, Captain America: The Winter Soldier)), Joe Russo (Captain America: Civil War, Captain America: The Winter Soldier)\n\nWriter: Christopher Markus (Captain America: Civil War, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe), Stephen McFeely (Captain America: Civil War, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe)\n\nMain cast: Robert Downey Jnr (Iron Man, Sherlock Holmes), Paul Rudd (Ant-Man, The Catcher Was a Spy), Chris Evans (Captain America: Civil War, Gifted)\n\nA David and Goliath true story as award-winning news program producer Mary Mapes falls foul of the corporate might of CBS in the search of the truth.\n\nCate Blanchett, as usual, is commanding and resolute as Mapes in this intelligent, driven drama. Whilst occasionally slipping into soap-box political statements about the nature of high-end journalism and moral responsibility, debut helmer James Vanderbilt (writer of Zodiac and White House Down) handles the material well.\n\nRating: 70%\n\nDirector: James Vanderbilt\n\nWriter: James Vanderbilt (Zodiac, White House Down) – based on the book by Mary Mapes\n\nMain cast: Cate Blanchett (Blue Jasmine, The Aviator), Robert Redford (All the President’s Men, Avengers: Endgame), Topher Grace (Traffic, Interstellar)"
