        "text": "NEW YORK — Adam McKay's Dick Cheney biopic \"Vice\" seized control of the 76th annual Golden Globe Awards with a leading six nominations, narrowly edging Bradley Cooper's tear-jerking revival \"A Star Is Born,\" the interracial road-trip drama \"Green Book\" and the period romp \"The Favourite.\"\n\n\"Vice\" topped all contenders Thursday, in nominations announced at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif., including best picture, comedy and best actor nominations for Christian Bale's nearly unrecognizable performance as the former vice president. It also earned nominations for Amy Adams' Lynne Cheney, Sam Rockwell's George W. Bush and both the screenplay and direction by McKay, the veteran comedy filmmaker who once skewered politicians as a \"Saturday Night Live\" writer.\n\nFor even the often-quirky selections of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a collection of 88 mostly less-known freelance film journalists, the strong support for \"Vice\" (which arrives in theaters on Dec. 25) was a surprise. Even its categorization of the film — a highly critical portrait of Cheney as a power-hungry, behind-the-scenes tyrant — as a comedy raised some eyebrows, just as Globes recent comedy selections \"Get Out\" and \"The Martian\" did.\n\nBut it was far from a runaway win for \"Vice\" since the press association typically spread its awards around. Oscar front-runners \"A Star Is Born,\" ''Green Book\" and \"The Favourite\" trailed close behind with five nominations each.\n\nOn the television side, awards were even more widely dispersed among the likes of \"The Americans,\" ''Barry,\" ''Homecoming,\" ''The Kominsky Method\" and \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\" Leading all small-screen nominees was the FX anthology series \"The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story\" with four nods. For the first time, FX bested heavyweights like HBO, Netflix and Amazon with a network-best 10 nods, even though its \"Atlanta\" was overlooked entirely.\n\nLocally, Pittsburgh's Billy Porter is nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Series, Drama for his work on FX's \"Pose.\"\n\nCuriously, the Hollywood Foreign Press doesn't consider foreign-language films for best film, so Alfonso Cuaron's acclaimed Netflix drama \"Roma\" was left out of the Globes' top category. It was still nominated for best screenplay, best director and best foreign language film.\n\nJoining \"A Star Is Born\" in the best picture, drama category was Ryan Coogler's superhero sensation \"Black Panther,\" Spike Lee's urgent white nationalist drama \"BlacKkKlansman,\" the Freddie Mercury biopic \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and Barry Jenkins' James Baldwin adaption \"If Beale Street Could Talk.\"\n\nAll earned nods in other categories, too, including Rami Malek's prosthetic tooth-aided performance as Mercury and the leading turn by John David Washington (son of Denzel) in \"BlacKkKlansman.\" The nod for \"Black Panther\" marked Marvel Studios' first best picture nomination at the Globes, a feat it is hoping to repeat at the Academy Awards.\n\nWhile Sam Elliott's supporting performance in \"A Star Is Born\" was unexpectedly overlooked, the Warner Bros. hit (which elected to compete on the more hefty drama side of the Globes despite its many songs) earned the expected nods for Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, as both actor and director.\n\nUp for best picture comedy alongside \"Vice\" are Yorgas Lanthimos' wild palace power struggle \"The Favourite,\" Peter Farrelly's divisive crowd-pleaser \"Green Book,\" the upcoming Disney sequel \"Mary Poppins Returns\" and the rom-com hit \"Crazy Rich Asians.\"\n\nThe Oscar path for both \"Green Book\" and \"The Favourite\" appeared to be solidified, with nods for all of the leads for each: Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali for \"Green Book\"; and Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone for \"The Favourite.\"\n\nWhile some critics have taken issue with \"Green Book\" for relying on outdated racial tropes, its once flagging Oscar campaign has lately received a boost with both better ticket sales and accruing awards love. Farrelly, best-known for broader comedies with his brother, Bobby, like \"There's Something About Mary,\" also received a best director nod for his dramatic turn.\n\nPerformers like Constance Wu (\"Crazy Rich Asians\"), Regina King (\"Beale Street\"), Ali and Washington, insured a somewhat diverse field of nominees. Spike Lee was nominated for \"BlacKkKlansman,\" the second time as best director by the Globes, 30 years after being nominated for \"Do the Right Thing.\"\n\nBut the Globes also didn't nominate any of the year's acclaimed female filmmakers for best director, and none of the 10 best picture nominees were helmed by a woman. At the previous Globes, presenter Natalie Portman pointedly introduced the \"all-male\" directing nominees.\n\nDamien Chazelle's Neil Armstrong biopic \"First Man,\" which has seen its awards hope wane in recent weeks, failed to liftoff, scoring neither a best film nod, nor one for Ryan Gosling's leading performance. (It did land nominations for Claire Foy and its score.) The news was worse for Steve McQueen's heist thriller \"Widows,\" which was shut out entirely.\n\nAlso left out, to gasps heard across social media, was Ethan Hawke's performance as an anguished pastor in \"First Reformed\" and Pawel Pawlikowski's Polish stunner \"Cold War,\" his follow-up to the Oscar-winning \"Ida.\" (The nominees for best foreign language film alongside \"Roma\" were \"Capernaum,\" ''Girl,\" ''Never Look Away\" and \"Shoplifters.\")\n\nBut the Globes also handed nominations to some up-and-comers, including Lucas Hedges (\"Boy Erased\"), Timothee Chalamet (\"Beautiful Boy\") and Elsie Fisher, the 15-year-old star of the coming-of-age tale \"Eighth Grade.\"\n\nAnd it also made room for one old favorite: Robert Redford, in what he has said may (or may not) be his final acting performance, received his 10th Globe nomination for \"The Old Man & the Gun.\" He was given the group's Cecil B. DeMille achievement award in 1994.\n\nThe nominees for best animated film were: \"Incredibles 2,\" ''Isle of Dogs,\" ''Mirai,\" ''Ralph Breaks the Internet\" and \"Spider-Man."
