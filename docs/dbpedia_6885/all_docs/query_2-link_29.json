Redfordʼs work in such classics as BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, THE STING, THE WAY WE WERE, OUT OF AFRICA has been widely lauded and recognized. But it is his directing that has earned him his greatest acclaim. Redford won a Directors Guild of America Award, a Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Director for his directorial debut on the emotionally shattering family drama, ORDINARY PEOPLE. He earned dual Oscar nominations for Best Picture and Best Director in 1994 for helming QUIZ SHOW and two Golden Globe nominations (Best Picture and Best Director) for THE HORSE WHISPERER in 1998.\n\nIn 1981, Redford founded the Sundance Institute, a global, nonprofit cultural organization dedicated to nurturing artistic expression in film and theater, and to supporting intercultural dialogue between artists and audiences. The non-for-profit Sundance Institute is internationally recognized for its annual Sundance Film Festival as well as its artistic development programs, which include the Screenwriting, Directing, Theatre, Music Composition and Producing Labs.\n\nOver a career spanning more than half a century, Robert Redford has come to personify the artist as both steward and generator of culture. Mr. Redford is a veritable cinematic icon and civic leader, to whom Levantine Entertainment is honored to present its Levantine Cinema Arts Award."
