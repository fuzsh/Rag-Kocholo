        "text": "A couple of glamour guys, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matthew McConaughey, and two very respected actresses, Cate Blanchett and Amy Adams, won big acting awards at the 71st annual Golden Globe Awards held at the Beverly Hilton on Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile, “American Hustle” and “12 Years a Slave” were named best comedy or musical and best drama respectively, leaving the Oscar race as wide open as it was before the ceremony.\n\n“All right, all right, all right. It’s a surprise,” said McConaughey upon accepting the award for best actor in a motion picture drama for his role in “Dallas Buyers Club,” in which he plays a small-time rodeo rider in the 1980s who contracts AIDS. It was in fact somewhat of a surprise since he beat out Robert Redford and Tom Hanks. The actor then gave a spirited acceptance speech, acknowledging his Hollywood icon competition.\n\n“I never would’ve guessed I would’ve won best actor in a comedy,” said DiCaprio, who was named best actor in a comedy or musical for playing a debauched trader in Martin Scorsese’s “The Wolf Of Wall Street.” It was the second Globe win for the superstar, who previously won in the drama category for “The Aviator.” It will be interesting to see if he makes the cut in the best-actor category when Oscar nominations come out Thursday. Most experts consider him on the cusp.\n\n“American Hustle” won three awards. Earlier, Robert Downey Jr. offered a racy and funny monologue before giving the best actress in a musical or comedy to Amy Adams for her role as a con artist in the film. “I always cry when I’m not supposed to,” said the popular actress. When the music rose to try to get her off stage, she sweetly said, “You can’t play me off before I recognize my daughter,” who is 2 ½ years old.\n\nCate Blanchett won as best actress in a drama for her Blanche Dubois-like role in “Blue Jasmine.” “That crept up on me. I had a few vodkas,” joked the Australian actress upon taking the stage. “It’s been an extraordinary year for film roles for women,” she added, then praising the film’s director and writer, Woody Allen.\n\nEarlier, Emma Stone presented the Cecil B. DeMille Award to Allen. Known for shunning Hollywood, the great filmmaker, of course, wasn’t there. They showed clips of his movies in a tribute, and then Diane Keaton, who was the first of many actresses to win an Oscar for a role in his movies, accepted the award for him. She gave a lovely speech that included a funny quote from the director, a reference to their 45-year friendship, a song and about a seven-second bleeped-out part.\n\nAlways a looser affair, with stars seated around tables, alcohol available and less at stake, there were, however, some genuine emotional moments from winners and a number of bleep-out moments.\n\nThe best drama award was the only one for “12 Years a Slave,” while another film expected to possibly win big, “Gravity,” only took home one when Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron was named best movie director for his dazzling outer-space drama.\n\n“This is for my cast and crew,” said the filmmaker holding up the award, “because of my thick accent, they did what they thought I told them to do.”\n\nThe ceremony, which aired live on NBC, was hosted by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. The two were backed after drawing raves for last year’s show, which drew an audience of about 20 million.\n\n“Good evening to all the women and gay men watching at home,” Poehler cracked in the opening slew of jokes, which, while amusing, didn’t have any real fall-down moments. Still, they kept the proceedings relatively lively with some loopy skits.\n\nOn the television side, former “Saturday Night Life” star Andy Samberg won best actor in a TV comedy for “Brooklyn Nine-Nine.” He got the award from new late-night host and fellow “SNL” alum Seth Meyers. The new Fox comedy was named the best TV comedy, probably not as trendy a pick as last year’s winner, HBO’s “Girls,” but a good choice.\n\nBryan Cranston won his first Globe after five best actor in a TV drama nominations for playing teacher-turned meth dealer on AMC’s acclaimed “Breaking Bad,” which ended its run last fall. “Oh my gosh, such a lovely way to say goodbye to the show,” said Cranston. The show also won best TV drama, which was accepted by the show’s creator Vince Gilligan, who called up series co-star Aaron Paul to give a signature line from the show: “Yeah, bitch.”\n\nPaul, surprisingly, lost out to Jon Voight for Showtime’s “Ray Donovan.” “I’m as nervous as everyone else,” said the Oscar-winning actor, 75. “I’m thinking of my family,” he added, perhaps a reference to his estranged daughter, Angelina Jolie.\n\nPoehler was getting a massage from U2’s Bono when she won best TV comedy actress from her role in “Parks & Recreation.” “This is so clichéd, but you get nervous,” said the obviously thrilled actress.\n\nRobin Wright got her first Globe win as the dark Claire Underwood in Netflix’s “House of Cards.” “Thank you Hollywood Foreign Press,” she said upon accepting the award for best actress in a TV drama. “You guys are a gaggle of characters.”\n\nSandra Bullock and Tom Hanks gave out the first award of the evening, best supporting actress in a film, which went to last year’s best-actress Oscar and Globe winner Jennifer Lawrence in “American Hustle.” The young actress was shaking over her win and thanked her director, David O. Russell.\n\nJared Leto in “Dallas Buyers Club” took home the best supporting actress in a motion picture and joked about body waxing for his role as a gay man dying of AIDS.\n\nVeteran star Jacqueline Bisset — still looking glamorous — was in tears and rambling after winning the best supporting actress in a TV miniseries or movie for his role in Starz’s period drama “Dancing on the Edge.” Almost five decades ago the HFPA gave her the most-promising newcomer award. “Forgiveness is the best beauty treatment,” the actress said after talking about the ups and downs in her career.\n\nNot surprisingly, since it was an Emmy winner, HBO’s “Behind The Candelabra,” the biopic of Liberace, took home best miniseries or TV movie. Michael Douglas won best actor award for that category for playing the famed entertainer. He thanked his co-star and co-nominee Matt Damon — who got referenced a lot during the telecast. “The only reason you’re not here,” said Douglas pointing to Damon, “is I had more sequins.”\n\nEmma Thompson came out with a drink and her high heels off to present best screenplay to Spike Jonze for “Her,” the film about a man in love with his computer operating system. He thanked his competitor David O’ Russell, who was up for his script for “American Hustle,” for his help on “Her.”\n\n“Mad Man’s” Elisabeth Moss was named best actress in miniseries or TV movie for her role as a detective in Jane Campion’s mystery “Top Of The Lake.”\n\nDisney’s “Frozen” — which has proven staying power at the box office — was named best animated film, while the Italian movie “The Great Beauty” won best foreign language film.\n\nMagnetic Zeros’ frontman Alexander Ebert won for best movie score for “All Is Lost,” and “Ordinary Love” with lyrics by Bono from “Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom” won best song.\n\nFor those reading the Globes tea leaves to forecast the Oscars, forget it. The 85-or-so members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association are bound to get something the same, especially since they divide up the six major categories into dramas and comedies (often quite arbitrarily). All five comedies this year — “Her,” “Inside Llewyn Davis,” “American Hustle,” “The Wolf Of Wall Street” and “Nebraska” — have laughs but they tackle serious subjects.\n\nPast years have shown that Academy Award and Globe winners coincide in the 60-70 percentage range in most categories, which is what most people will do in an Oscar pool. Of course, with so few members in HFPA, as compared to the more than 6,000 in the Academy, a couple of votes here and there can make a difference in any race.\n\nAnd as for the organization’s critical judgment, that has always been suspect. They do seem to have predilection for some odd choices, but in recent years nothing as embarrassing as in the group’s early days when its integrity was in question. (Fey and Poehler made a mild jibe about it before introducing HFPA’s president). It has, indeed, cleaned itself up a lot, although studios do still pay their member special attention.\n\nIt does, occasionally, make ahead-of-the-curve choices in television, but for the most part the ceremony is what it is — a night for Hollywood to strut and shine, celebrate its own and push its films. A Globe win might help a film in its Oscar campaign, though some — like 2010 comedy winner “The Hangover” — may not even get a nomination. By the way, Academy Award nominations will be revealed Thursday morning."
