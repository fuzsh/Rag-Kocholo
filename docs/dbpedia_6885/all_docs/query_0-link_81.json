        "text": "The searing epic “12 Years a Slave” and the con-artist caper “American Hustle” lead the 71st annual Golden Globes with seven nominations each.\n\nThe nominations, announced Thursday morning by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, suggested “American Hustle” and “12 Years a Slave” may be this year’s Oscar favorites. Hailed by critics as the movies’ most unblinking portrait of slavery, “12 Years a Slave” verified its front-runner status with nominations including best film drama, Chiwetel Ejiofor for best actor in a drama and Steve McQueen for best director.\n\n“American Hustle” dominated on the Globes’ other category side: comedy or musical. The fictionalized story of the FBI’s Abscam investigation in the late 1970s earned nominations for best movie comedy, Christian Bale for best actor in a comedy, Jennifer Lawrence for best supporting actress in a comedy and David O. Russell for best director.\n\nSeveral nominees have Austin ties. “Dallas Buyers Club” star Matthew McConaughey earned a nomination for best actor in a drama for his performance of Rob Woodroof, a heterosexual Dallas man who started a black market drug and supplement ring for people with HIV. Sandra Bullock earned a nomination as a stranded scientist in space in “Gravity,” and French actress Julie Delpy received a nomination for best actress in a drama for her stirring performance in Austin director Richard Linklater’s “Before Midnight,” a moving examination of the difficulties of love, which Delpy co-wrote.\n\nAlso in the mix are Alexander Payne’s father-son road trip “Nebraska,” with five nominations, including best actor for Bruce Dern. The space odyssey “Gravity” earned four nominations, as did the Somali pirate thriller “Captain Phillips.”\n\nThis year’s comedy competition could be the strongest field ever for the Globes. Aside from “American Hustle,” the group includes Martin Scorsese’s “The Wolf of Wall Street,” Alexander Payne’s “Nebraska,” Spike Jonze’s “Her” and the Coen brothers’ “Inside Llewyn Davis.”\n\nThe last film of 2013 to screen, Scorsese’s three-hour financial industry extravaganza had been one of the biggest question marks this awards season. Along with the best picture nomination, it earned one for Leonardo DiCaprio’s leading performance.\n\nAlong with “12 Years a Slave,” the dramatic best picture category was rounded out by “Captain Phillips,” ”Gravity,” ”Philomena” and “Rush.”\n\nMost notably shutout was “Lee Daniels’ The Butler,” the Civil Rights history told through a long-serving White House butler played by Forest Whitaker.\n\nThis year’s ceremony on Jan. 12 will again be hosted by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.\n\nLast year’s telecast saw a bump in viewership to 19.7 million.\n\nThe past two years, one of the Globes’ best-picture winners went on to top the Academy Awards. Last year, the Globes awarded Ben Affleck’s “Argo” best picture for drama. The year before that, the silent film ode “The Artist” won best picture for a comedy.\n\nThe nominees are as follows:\n\nMotion Pictures\n\n— Picture, Drama: “12 Years a Slave,” ”Captain Phillips,” ”Gravity,” ”Philomena,” ”Rush.”\n\n— Picture, Musical or Comedy: “American Hustle,” ”Her,” ”Inside Llewyn Davis,” ”Nebraska,” ”The Wolf of Wall Street.”\n\n— Actor, Drama: Chiwetel Ejiofor, “12 Years a Slave”; Idris Elba, “Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom”; Tom Hanks, “Captain Phillips”; Matthew McConaughey, “Dallas Buyers Club”; Robert Redford, “All Is Lost.”\n\n— Actress, Drama: Cate Blanchett, “Blue Jasmine”; Sandra Bullock, “Gravity”; Judi Dench, “Philomena”; Emma Thompson, “Saving Mr. Banks”; Kate Winslet, “Labor Day.”\n\n— Director: Alfonso Curon, “Gravity”; Paul Greengrass, “Captain Phillips”; Steve McQueen, “12 Years a Slave”; Alexander Payne, “Nebraska”; David O.
