        "text": "Just an hour or so ago the Hollywood Foreign Press Association announce their nominations for the 71st annual Golden Globes, celebrating the year of 2013 in film and television. I have always loved the Golden Globes not because I take them seriously but because they put on an incredibly fun telecast, with stars dressed to the nines and booze flowing heavily at the tables. In the past the HFPA has been all about celebrating celebrity and having as many big stars attend their ceremony as possible. Perhaps this year is a bit different. Their proclivities still remain clear: celebrating European entities where possible (more on that later), making their own rules, and the aforementioned star factor. Yet looking at this year’s crop of nominees, even if some of it is still silly (by definition alone separating films between Drama and Comedy makes certain publicity teams have to make calls about which category to submit into), it still reads a bit more serious than in years past. Remember, this is the organization that nominated The Tourist and Salmon Fishing in the Yemen for their Best Picture Comedy/Musical category.\n\nThey have also selected their television nominees, and these are as robust and strange as ever, clearly favoring the new and the young. The HFPA relishes the opportunity to be the first organization to nominate a particular show or actor.\n\nThe nominees are…\n\nFILM\n\nBest motion picture, drama\n\n12 Years a Slave\n\nCaptain Phillips\n\nGravity\n\nPhilomena\n\nRush\n\nBest Actor in a motion picture, drama\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor,,12 years a Slave\n\nIdris Elba, Mandela\n\nTom Hanks, Captain Phillips\n\nMatthew McConaughey, Dallas Buyers Club\n\nRobert Redford, All is Lost\n\nBest Actress in a motion picture, drama\n\nCate Blanchett, Blue Jasmine\n\nSandra Bullock, Gravity\n\nJudi Dench, Philomena\n\nEmma Thompson, Saving Mr. Banks\n\nKate Winslet, Labor Day\n\nBest Director – motion picture\n\nAlfonso Cuaron, Gravity\n\nPaul Greengrass, Captain Phillips\n\nSteve McQueen, 12 Years a Slave\n\nAlexander Payne, Nebraska\n\nDavid O.

The short answer? Not at all. Historically, although many of the same films and individuals end up being nominated for both the Golden Globe and the Oscar, there is no direct correlation in the same way that there would be with the Guilds. These are not peers or a prestigious academy selecting these nominees but a group of foreign journalists who decide to put on a big show. That being said, the long answer is a tad more complicated. I surmise that by simply receiving a Golden Globe nomination, particularly if it seemed that you were leaving the conversation a little bit or a film was close to being forgotten, it puts your name back on people’s lips. The Golden Globes may not be taken seriously by pundits or film fans, but the Hollywood inner circles (publicists, studios, etc.) take them very seriously and any ink for your film or star is a very good thing. On the flip side, as I discussed earlier, the HFPA has their own likes and dislikes just in the same way that the Academy tends to favor certain types of films and actors with certain narratives. So how does this all shake out?\n\nThe Best Picture, drama category is rather fascinating and it features two surprising nominations: Philomena and Rush. Both are quality films that few were predicting, but looking back their European influence and flavor points to them being in the HFPA’s wheelhouse. The films that I expected to take their places, Saving Mr. Banks and Lee Daniels’ The Butler (completely shut out here) are American stories. I still expect Saving Mr. Banks to show up to play at the Oscars (particularly because they love stories that celebrate Hollywood), but the nominations are still weeks away.\n\nA few of the other big surprises include: Idris Elba (which I predicted last night, but was admittedly a lark at the time), the lack of Martin Scorsese in Best Director (the HFPA have favored him in the past), the lack of Monsters University in the animated category (a silly choice, if you ask me), and Hayao Miyazaki’s The Wind Rises receiving a nomination for best foreign film but not best animated film. The foreign category here works very differently than the Oscars; any film not in English is eligible, whereas the Oscars only have one film per country submitted as their entry. Many of the foreign nominees here will not even be eligible for the Oscars. The biggest concern here is for Scorsese. As I mentioned yesterday with my SAG piece The Wolf of Wall Street hit late in the game, but the HFPA clearly saw the film and opted to nominate other directors. This category sticks harder in terms of potential Oscar prospects, but the rumor mill suggested that the HFPA wasn’t in love with the shocking excess of The Wolf of Wall Street (the lack of a screenplay nomination suggests this as well, although the Globes do not separate into original and adapted as others do) so we’ll see how this all plays out. Her continues to make a strong showing and can perhaps snag a Best Picture nomination when all is said and done. At this point I’d argue that it is the front runner for Original Screenplay.\n\nThe supporting categories (not separated into drama/comedy like the others) have a few surprising notes that go in direct opposition of how the HFPA usually operates. Instead of nominating Oprah, Jonah Hill, and Tom Hanks (already nominated for Captain Phillips, regardless), all big stars, they went for more under the radar choices: Sally Hawkins, Barkhad Abdi, and Daniel Brühl. To my mind these 3 all gave strong performances, but I would not be surprised to see them ultimately miss out on Oscar nominations. Only time will tell.\n\nOtherwise, many of the expected nominees came to pass. Both 12 Years a Slave and American Hustle put in very strong showings. One could argue that American Hustle is not a comedy, as is the case with almost every film in that category (at least Inside Llewyn Davis has a legitimate argument as a musical), but submitting in that category was clearly a smart move as it racked up a robust 7 nominations. I’d wager that it is full steam ahead for this film right to Oscar night.\n\nI can nary make heads or tails of the score and song nominations. Original song, in particular, always has some strange populist choices from the Globes, but I think it is clear Let it Go from Frozen is the one to beat.\n\nOn a personal note, it thrills me to see Greta Gerwig, Julie Delpy, and Oscar Isaac recognized here, and they all benefit from the category separation. That being said their Oscar prospects are next to none.\n\nRemember, the Oscars will not announce their nominations for more than a month. Time can change many things. Isn’t awards season truly bizarre?\n\nTELEVISION\n\nBest TV series, drama\n\nBreaking Bad\n\nDownton Abbey\n\nThe Good Wife\n\nHouse of Cards\n\nMasters of Sex\n\nBest Actress in a TV series, drama\n\nJulianna Margulies, The Good Wife\n\nTatiana Maslany, Orphan Black\n\nTaylor Schilling, Orange is the New Black\n\nKerry Washington, Scandal\n\nRobin Wright, House of Cards\n\nBest Actor in a TV series, drama\n\nBryan Cranston, Breaking Bad\n\nLiev Schreiber, Ray Donovan\n\nMichael Sheen, Masters of Sex\n\nKevin Spacey, House of Cards\n\nJames Spader, The Blacklist\n\nBest TV Series, Comedy\n\nThe Big Bang Theory\n\nBrooklyn Nine-Nine\n\nGirls\n\nModern Family\n\nParks and Recreation\n\nBest Actress in a TV Series, Comedy\n\nZooey Deschanel, New Girl\n\nEdie Falco, Nurse Jackie\n\nLena Dunham, Girls\n\nJulia Louis Dreyfus, Veep\n\nAmy Poehler, Parks and Recreation\n\nBest Actor, TV Series Comedy\n\nJason Bateman, Arrested Development\n\nDon Cheadle, House of Lies\n\nMichael J.

They’re also pretty cool. Many, myself included, were hoping that Tatiana Maslany and Monica Potter would receive Emmy nominations this year. Leave it to the HFPA to honor their great work. These nominees also clearly prove that the Globes love to honor shiny, brand new things: James Spader, Michael J. Fox, Brooklyn Nine Nine, Masters of Sex, etc. These shows haven’t even completed a full first season and they have received nominations here. Cool? Perhaps. A sing of things to come? We’ll see.\n\nThe Globes were not afraid to show their love to Netflix, with House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, and Arrested Development all receiving nominations. This is a cool new world we live in, and the definition of television is ever changing.\n\nAlso of note is the way the HFPA handle their supporting television nominations, making for some very weird categories with some truly oddball matchups. In what world is Janet McTeer’s work in The White Queen equatable or comparable to Sofia Vergara’s broad comedy on Modern Family? Not one I live on.\n\nFinally, perhaps my favorite bit here is the love for The Good Wife. This show has had a stellar 2013, and it pleases me that the HFPA recognized and honored this. By the same token, Homeland and Mad Men were completely shut out. Not everybody can be invited to the ball.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? How do you think this will affect the Oscar race? Are there any films or tv shows you wish were nominated? Chime in below.\n\nSource"
