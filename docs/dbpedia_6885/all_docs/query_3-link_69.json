        "text": "Robert Redford\n\nRobert Redford, founder and president of the Sundance Institute, addresses reporters during the opening news conference of the 2014 Sundance Film Festival on Thursday, Jan. 16, 2014, in Park City, Utah.\n\n(Chris Pizzello | Invision | AP)\n\nRobert Redford has never won an Oscar for acting.\n\nThat's right, the Academy Awards have never recognized the 77-year-old star for any of his performances, including in \"Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid,\" \"The Sting\" and \"All the President's Men.\" When he braved the waters for \"All is Lost\" last year, nearly everyone thought he'd at least get nominated.\n\nRedford is the only actor in \"All is Lost,\" playing a shipwreck survivor who fights to stay alive during a solo voyage in the Indian Ocean. There's little speaking in it, unlike Tom Hanks' similarly-themed 2000 movie \"Cast Away.\"\n\nBut no, the nominees for best actor in a motion picture this year are Christian Bale, \"American Hustle\"; Bruce Dern, \"Nebraska\"; Leonardo DiCaprio, \"The Wolf of Wall Street\"; Chiwetel Ejiofor, \"12 Years a Slave\"; and Matthew McConaughey, \"Dallas Buyers Club.\" Redford, who was nominated for \"All is Lost\" at the Golden Globes, was snubbed.\n\n\"Let me speak frankly about how I feel about it. I don't want that to get in the way of why we're here,\" he said Thursday at a press conference for the 2014 Sundance Film Festival.\n\n\"I've been part of the Hollywood film industry for much of my career. I'm very happy about it. Hollywood is what it is. It's a business,\" Redford continued. \"There's a lot of campaigning going on and it can be very political... Would it have been wonderful to be nominated? Of course. I'm not disturbed by it or upset by it.\"\n\nOf course Redford isn't worried about it. He's Robert Redford. And he's still won an Oscar for directing 1980's \"Ordinary People,\" plus a nomination for best actor in 1973's \"The Sting.\"\n\nBale, Dern, DiCaprio, Ejiofor and McConaughey are certainly worthy of consideration, but why did they get nods over the screen legend?\n\nAccording to E! News, Redford might have been overlooked because the film didn't get enough exposure.\n\n\"In our case, we suffered from little to no distribution. I don't know what they were afraid of. They didn't want to spend money or they were incapable,\" the actor explained. \"We had no campaign to cross over into the mainstream.\"\n\n\"All is Lost\" distributor Roadside Attractions, partially owned by Lionsgate, didn't give the film a nationwide release in theaters. Despite being produced by Jamesville-DeWitt High School graduate Justin Nappi under his company Treehouse Pictures, Central New York moviegoers barely got a chance to see it when it briefly screened at Manlius Art Cinema last year.\n\nRedford instead focused his energy and enthusiasm on the Sundance Film Festival, which runs through Jan. 26 in Park City, Utah.\n\n\"I'm fine!\" he said with a smile."
