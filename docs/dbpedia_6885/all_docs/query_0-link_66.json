        "text": "The searing historical epic “12 Years a Slave” and the con-artist caper “American Hustle” led the 71st annual Golden Globes with seven nominations each.\n\nThe nominations announced Thursday morning in Beverly Hills, Calif., by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association suggested “American Hustle” and “12 Years a Slave” — one farcical and outlandish, the other grimly accurate — may be this year’s Oscar favorites.\n\nHailed by critics as the movies’ most unblinking portrait of slavery, “12 Years a Slave” verified its front-runner status with nominations including best film drama, Chiwetel Ejiofor for best actor in a drama, Steve McQueen for best director and Michael Fassbender and Lupita Nyong’o for their supporting roles.\n\n“American Hustle” dominated the Globes’ other category side: comedy or musical. The fictionalized story of the FBI’s Abscam investigation in the late 1970s earned nominations for best movie comedy and David O. Russell for best director. Much of its starry cast received nominations, including lead actors Christian Bale and Amy Adams, as well as last year’s Oscar darling, Jennifer Lawrence for best supporting actress.\n\nAlso in the mix are Alexander Payne’s father-son road trip “Nebraska,” with five nominations, including best actor for Bruce Dern. The space odyssey “Gravity” earned four nominations, as did the Somali pirate thriller “Captain Phillips,” starring Tom Hanks as the kidnapped cargo ship captain.\n\nAlfonso Cuaron’s innovative 3-D spectacle “Gravity,” for which star Sandra Bullock received a best actress nomination, should be a bigger Oscar heavyweight at the Academy Awards, which honor technical categories that the Globes don’t. With more than $630 million in worldwide box office earnings, “Gravity” also figures to be the populist favorite.\n\nThis year’s comedy competition — usually a mixed bag compared to the dramatic categories — could be the strongest field ever for the Globes. Aside from “American Hustle,” the group includes Martin Scorsese’s “The Wolf of Wall Street,” Alexander Payne’s “Nebraska,” Spike Jonze’s “Her” and the Coen brothers’ “Inside Llewyn Davis.”\n\nThe soulful futuristic romance “Her” and ’60s Greenwich Village folk tale “Inside Llewyn Davis” both reaped three nominations, including nods for its stars: newcomer Oscar Isaac for “Llewyn Davis” and Joaquin Phoenix for “Her.”\n\nThe last film of 2013 to screen, Scorsese’s three-hour financial industry extravaganza had been one of the biggest question marks this awards season. After being snubbed Wednesday by the Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations, it earned a nomination for Leonardo DiCaprio’s performance as an out-of-control Wall Street trader, along with the best picture nomination.\n\nThe 77-year-old Dern rounds out best actor in a comedy for his performance as a taciturn Montana man who believes he’s won a sweepstakes. He’s joined on the dramatic best actor side by another 77-year-old veteran, Robert Redford. The actor, who has never won an acting Oscar, was nominated by the Globes for his nearly unspoken performance as a man shipwrecked in the Indian Ocean in “All Is Lost.”\n\nIn the dramatic best picture category, “12 Years a Slave” was joined by “Captain Phillips,” “Gravity,” “Philomena” and “Rush.” Most notably shutout was “Lee Daniels’ The Butler,” the Civil Rights history told through a long-serving White House butler played by Forest Whitaker.\n\n(The Best Animated Feature category includes a nomination for “Frozen,” written and co-directed by Rhode Island’s Jennifer Lee. The competition include “The Croods” and “Despicable Me 2.”)\n\nThe awards ceremony on Jan. 12 will again be hosted by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, who led last year’s broadcast to 19.7 million viewers, a significant bump for the Globes. They often serve as a preamble to the more prestigious Oscars, which will be held March 2.\n\nThis year’s Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award will be given to Woody Allen, who, long an a absentee from award shows, isn’t expected to attend. His latest film, “Blue Jasmine,” a portrait of a bitter, fallen socialite played by Cate Blanchett, won nominations Thursday for Blanchett and Sally Hawkins.\n\nThe last two years, one of the Globes’ best-picture winners went on to top the Academy Awards. Last year, the Globes awarded Ben Affleck’s “Argo” best picture for drama. The year before that, the silent film ode “The Artist” won best picture for a comedy.\n\nThough the Globes are often known for idiosyncratic choices (last year “Salmon Fishing in the Yemen” received three nominations), their 2013 picks contained few oddities.\n\nDisney’s making-of “Mary Poppins” tale “Saving Mr. Banks,” a possible Oscar contender, fared poorly Thursday, earning only a nomination for Emma Thompson’s lead performance as “Poppins” author P.L. Travers. While the Texas HIV drama “Dallas Buyers Club” was rewarded with expected nominations for Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto, it failed to land any others.\n\nMcConaughey, Redford and Ejiofor are joined in best actor by Tom Hanks for “Captain Phillips” and Idris Elba, who plays the late Nelson Mandela in “Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.”\n\nA film that could have easily been a theatrical release, Steven Soderbergh’s Liberace drama “Behind the Candelabra,” topped the Globes’ television nominations. The HBO film helped lead the cable network to a leading nine nominations.\n\nNominees for the 71st annual Golden Globe Awards, announced Thursday in Beverly Hills, Calif., by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association:\n\nMotion Pictures\n\n*Picture, Drama: “12 Years a Slave,” “Captain Phillips,” “Gravity,” “Philomena,” “Rush.”\n\n*Picture, Musical or Comedy: “American Hustle,” “Her,” “Inside Llewyn Davis,” “Nebraska,” “The Wolf of Wall Street.”\n\n*Actor, Drama: Chiwetel Ejiofor, “12 Years a Slave”; Idris Elba, “Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom”; Tom Hanks, “Captain Phillips”; Matthew McConaughey, “Dallas Buyers Club”; Robert Redford, “All Is Lost.”\n\n*Actress, Drama: Cate Blanchett, “Blue Jasmine”; Sandra Bullock, “Gravity”; Judi Dench, “Philomena”; Emma Thompson, “Saving Mr. Banks”; Kate Winslet, “Labor Day.”\n\n*Director: Alfonso Curon, “Gravity”; Paul Greengrass, “Captain Phillips”; Steve McQueen, “12 Years a Slave”; Alexander Payne, “Nebraska”; David O.
