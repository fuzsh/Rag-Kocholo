        "text": "The winners of the HFPA's 71st Annual Golden Globe Awards, the precursor to the Academy Awards, have been announced tonight at a ceremony held at The Beverly Hilton hotel, hosted by the incredibly talented Tina Fey & Amy Poehler, back from last year. Our list below will be updated with all film-related winners as they're revealed during the ceremony's live broadcast. The nominees were wild as usual, so it should be fun to see who ends up winning, and which films the HFPA fell in love with more than others. Here's to hoping they go for Her, 12 Years a Slave or Gravity. Find out who took home Globes! List below.\n\nThe 71st Annual Golden Globe Awards are held at the Beverly Hilton hosted by Tina Fey & Amy Poehler. Full list of film only (no TV - sorry!) Globe winners can be seen below.

DEMILLE LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT\n\nWoody Allen\n\nWhat do you think of the 2014 winners? How is the show with returning hosts Tina Fey & Amy Poehler? Are these an early indicator of any Oscars, or not? What favorite movies from 2013 are you rooting for?\n\nThoughts: If it weren't for Steve McQueen's 12 Years a Slave pulling out a last minute win for Best Drama (hooray! congrats!), I would've declared most of these Golden Globe winners blasphemy! Not really, but there were some odd picks. I enjoy American Hustle, but it's not that great and didn't really need to win so many awards. That said, I am very very happy that Spike Jonze's Her won for Best Screenplay, Alex Ebert's All is Lost score is beautiful, and Alfonso Cuarón winning Best Director is wonderful, but I would've preferred any other Best Actor, any other Best Foreign Language Film, and was really rooting for Lupita Nyong'o for Best Supporting Actress and Blue is the Warmest Color. But you can't always get everything with the HFPA. Oh well. Let's hope this awards momentum for 12 Years a Slave carries over to the Oscars."
