        "text": "Robert Redford\n\nRedford at the 53rd Academy Awards 4 Nominations / 2 Wins Role Actor, Director, Producer Born August 18, 1936 Santa Monica, California, USA\n\nRobert Redford is an American actor, film director, producer, businessman, environmentalist, philanthropist, and founder of the Sundance Film Festival. After television guest appearances on various series and while still largely an unknown, Redford made his screen debut in War Hunt (1962). He then went on to star in Inside Daisy Clover (1965) which won him the Best Newcomer Golden Globe award. After this initial success, Redford became concerned about his blond male stereotype image and turned down roles in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) and The Graduate (1967). Redford found the property he was looking for in George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), scripted by William Goldman, in which he was paired for the first time with Paul Newman. The film was a huge success and made him a major bankable star, cementing his screen image as an intelligent, reliable, sometimes sardonic good guy. Other notable films he appeared include; The Candidate (1972), The Way We Were (1973), The Sting (1973), The Great Gatsby (1974), Three Days of the Condor (1975), All the President's Men (1976), The Electric Horseman (1979), Brubaker (1980), The Natural (1984), Out of Africa (1985), Havana (1990), Up Close & Personal (1996), The Horse Whisperer (1998), among many others. He began directing in 1980 starting with Academy Award winning Ordinary People. Other notable films he directed include; The Milagro Beanfield War (1988), A River Runs Through It (1992), and Quiz Show (1994).\n\nWins[]\n\n53rd Academy Awards, 1980\n\nBest Director — Ordinary People\n\nSpecial and Honorary Awards[]\n\n74th Academy Awards, 2001\n\nHonorary Award for his work as an actor, director, producer, creator of Sundance, inspiration to independent and innovative filmmakers everywhere.\n\nNominations[]\n\n46th Academy Awards, 1973\n\nBest Actor — The Sting\n\n53rd Academy Awards, 1980\n\nBest Director — Ordinary People"
