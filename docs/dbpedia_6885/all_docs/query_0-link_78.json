        "text": "Since 1951, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) has bestowed awards upon its picks for the best in television and film. For many of those years, a Golden Globe win signaled potential Oscar gold. Since the awards show's inception, the Golden Globes accurately selected 43 of 65 possible Oscar wins for Best Picture.\n\nSince awards for Best Picture are given for both Drama and Musical/Comedies, they have two chances this year to get it right, even if they don't always do. Last year's \"Green Book\" is the most recent example of both the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the HFPA agreeing on a Best Picture, so in celebration of the upcoming awards season, let's take a look back at all the times they agreed on the big award.\n\n1 of 44\n\n1951, \"An American in Paris\"\n\nSilver Screen Collection/Getty Images\n\nGene Kelly and director Vincente Minnelli's adaptation of George Gershwin's classic composition was the first Golden Globe recipient for Best Picture, Musical or Comedy. While that inaugural award was the only Globe it received, the Academy was much kinder, giving \"An American in Paris\" six Oscars — although to be fair, none of the awards outside of Best Picture were for categories the Golden Globes recognized yet.\n\n2 of 44\n\n1952, \"The Greatest Show on Earth\"\n\nHulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nCircus life under the big-top world was displayed in full Technicolor in \"The Greatest Show on Earth,\" a drama that not only featured the talents of Charlton Heston and Betty Hutton but also the full complement of people, animals, equipment and tents of the real Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey's Circus. While it shared Golden Globe and Oscar Best Picture wins, it is believed by many to be the worst winner in a year when far better films like \"High Noon\" and \"Singin' in the Rain\" were released.\n\n3 of 44\n\n1954, \"On the Waterfront\"\n\nJohn Springer Collection/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nDirector Elia Kazan had a number of great films during his clouded career in Hollywood but none as great as 1954's \"On the Waterfront.\" Starring a powerful cast including Marlon Brando, Rod Steiger, Lee J. Cobb and Eva Marie Saint, the film won three Golden Globes and eight Oscars.\n\n4 of 44\n\n1956, \"Around the World in 80 Days\"\n\nUnited Artists/Getty Images\n\nAnother dark horse that could, \"Around the World in 80 Days,\" boasting a huge cast of cameos, including Frank Sinatra, Noel Coward and Buster Keaton, surprised everyone when it took home three Golden Globes and five Oscars over expected winners \"The Ten Commandments\" and \"The King and I.\"\n\n5 of 44\n\n1957, \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\"\n\nColumbia Pictures/Getty Images\n\nDirector David Lean's prison camp drama \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" offers a fictionalized take on the building of the Burma Highway in 1942-43. Starring Sir Alec Guinness and William Holden, this epic war film won three of four Golden Globes and went on to win seven of eight Oscars.\n\n6 of 44\n\n1959, \"Ben-Hur\"\n\nSilver Screen Collection/Getty Images\n\nBased on the 1880 novel of the same name, director William Wyler's 1959 version remains the most popular of seven different adaptations of a Jewish prince who loses everything only to win a greater prize of humility and dignity. Starring Charlton Heston as Judah Ben-Hur and featuring a dazzling chariot race pulled off long before the days of CGI, \"Ben-Hur\" snagged three Golden Globes and a staggering 11 of 12 Oscars.\n\n7 of 44\n\n1960, \"The Apartment\"\n\nUnited Artists/Getty Images\n\nDirector Billy Wilder scored a big hit with his small romantic comedy, starring Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine in a tale of shared space and mistaken identities. \"The Apartment\" won three Golden Globes and five Oscars, although the Best Picture award is the only one shared between the two.\n\n8 of 44\n\n1962, \"Lawrence of Arabia\"\n\nSilver Screen Collection/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nBased on the life of World War I adventurer T.E. Lawrence, \"Lawrence of Arabia\" was David Lean's next big epic and certainly delivered in every category that his previous epic managed to. The film nearly swept the Golden Globes with six of seven and went on to win seven of 10 Oscars. A notable loss between the two? Peter O'Toole, who failed to win Best Actor at both events.\n\n9 of 44\n\n1963, \"Tom Jones\"\n\nUnited Artists/Getty Images\n\nThe whole world loved \"Tom Jones\" in 1963, and not just the singer! The historical drama, starring Albert Finney as a lovelorn bastard who grew up under the dutiful eye of a kind nobleman, was a surprise hit in 1963, and it carried on into awards season with three Golden Globes and four Oscars.\n\n10 of 44\n\n1964, \"My Fair Lady\"\n\nWarner Brothers/Getty Images\n\nDirector George Cukor's classic film of class and phonetics might be out of place by today's standards, but in 1964 the education of Eliza Doolittle by Henry Higgins was a smash hit critically and financially. \"My Fair Lady\" won three Golden Globes and eight Oscars, but the real crime was that Audrey Hepburn not only failed to win but was not nominated (except for a Golden Globe).\n\n11 of 44\n\n1965, \"The Sound of Music\"\n\nBettmann / Getty Images\n\nThe hills were alive with the sound of awards for this 1965 musical starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. Originally only meant for roadshow performances, fans couldn't get enough of \"The Sound of Music,\" making it a hit that eventually led to two Golden Globes and five Oscars, only sharing awards for Best Picture.\n\n12 of 44\n\n1966, \"A Man for All Seasons\"\n\nColumbia Pictures/Getty Images\n\nThis biographical drama, depicting the final years of Sir Thomas More, received a number of accolades, including the Vatican listing it as one of the greatest movies of all time. \"A Man for All Seasons\" won four Golden Globes and six Oscars, sharing wins in four categories including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Screenplay.\n\n13 of 44\n\n1967, \"In the Heat of the Night\"\n\nMondadori Portfolio via Getty Images\n\nDirector Norman Jewison's adaptation of John Ball's 1965 novel is as incendiary as it is cool, featuring solid performances from Sidney Poitier as Virgil Tibbs, a black policeman from the North faced with a Southern-fried sheriff in the form of Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger) while on the trail of a murderer. \"In the Heat of the Night\" struck a big chord with audiences and critics alike, winning three Golden Globes and five Oscars, sharing three.\n\n14 of 44\n\n1968, \"Oliver!\"\n\nChris Ware/Keystone Features/Getty Images\n\nWhen it came to director Carol Reed's adaptation of the musical adaptation of Charles Dickens' \"Oliver Twist,\" audiences absolutely wanted more. Featuring a number of showstopping numbers and brilliant performances from Oliver Reed and Ron Moody, \"Oliver!\" won two Golden Globes and six Oscars, matching two.\n\n15 of 44\n\n1971, \"The French Connection\"\n\nSilver Screen Collection/Getty Images\n\nGene Hackman's turn as hard-boiled Popeye Doyle broke the mold for film detectives, ushering in a darker era in cop movies. Based on the nonfiction 1969 novel, director William Friedkin's \"The French Connection\" cleaned up during awards season winning three Golden Globes and five Oscars, with three wins in complete agreement.\n\n16 of 44\n\n1972, \"The Godfather\"\n\nSilver Screen Collection/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nAn American crime drama to beat all competition, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo's \"The Godfather\" was not only epic but also intimate, showing the life and times of a mafia family, starring Marlon Brando and up-and-coming actor Al Pacino as a father and son tasked with similar responsibilities, to put it mildly. When awards season arrived, the film got an offer it couldn't refuse with three Golden Globes and three Oscars, sharing only two.\n\n17 of 44\n\n1975, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\"\n\nUnited Artists/Getty Images\n\nMilos Forman's adaptation of Ken Kesey's 1962 novel is a showcase for actor Jack Nicholson as conman Randle McMurphy, who thought he could escape hard labor by playing crazy and taking it easy in a mental institution. Although Nicholson is absolutely the star, Louise Fletcher's turn as the evil Nurse Ratched is a star-making turn equally deserving of attention. Both the Academy and HFPA agreed, giving \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" a clean sweep of six Golden Globes and five Oscars.\n\n18 of 44\n\n1976, \"Rocky\"\n\nMichael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nEveryone loves an underdog, and Rocky Balboa was certainly no exception. Audiences fell in love with \"Rocky,\" a story of a so-called bum with a heart of gold getting a chance at stardom all while meeting the girl of his dreams. \"Rocky\" won only one Golden Globe and three Oscars, but in winning Best Picture at both ceremonies, it's easy to say that Balboa ended up the real champ in 1976.\n\n19 of 44\n\n1979, \"Kramer vs. Kramer\"\n\nColumbia Pictures/Getty Images\n\nDivorce is a hard subject to crack in real life, as it was with director Robert Benton's somber depiction of a family falling apart. Starring Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep as a couple playing tug of war over their child, \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" is at once charming and heartbreaking. Critics and audiences agreed, and when awards season came around, the film won four Globes and five Oscars, sharing four.\n\n20 of 44\n\n1980, \"Ordinary People\"\n\nSunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nRobert Redford was no stranger to Golden Globe or Oscar wins, but it's all the more remarkable that his latest shared victory was for his directorial debut. \"Ordinary People,\" a story about the disintegration of an upper-middle class family, was quite the darling at both awards shows, picking up a combined nine awards.\n\n21 of 44\n\n1983, \"Terms of Endearment\"\n\nParamount Pictures/Getty Images\n\nLike \"Ordinary People,\" Paramount found similar pay dirt in awards gold for \"Terms of Endearment\" with four Golden Globe wins that later led to another five Oscar wins. The only category that wasn't matched win for win was that of Best Director, where the Globes passed on James L. Brooks, but this would later be rectified when Brooks received his Oscar.\n\n22 of 44\n\n1984, \"Amadeus\"\n\nOrion/Getty Images\n\nThe Golden Globes didn't have to predict that \"Amadeus\" would be a huge winner. The period drama about the life and rivalries of the giggly composer received a record 53 award nominations, winning 40 of them. Of those, four were Golden Globes and five were Oscars.\n\n23 of 44\n\n1985, \"Out of Africa\"\n\nHemdale/Getty Images\n\nA romantic drama set among the Kenyan plains, \"Out of Africa\" won three Golden Globes that later turned into five Oscars, matching all categories except that of Best Supporting Actor for Klaus Maria Brandauer, who failed to convert his Globes win into an Oscar. Conversely, while director Sydney Pollack found himself snubbed by the HFPA, he was recognized for his work on the film with his own Oscar.\n\n24 of 44\n\n1986, \"Platoon\"\n\nRoland Neveu/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nOliver Stone's magnum opus \"Platoon\" exploded onto screens as a harrowing tale of the darkest side of war. Separated from an era of war films as tales of heroism, Stone crafted a film that accurately conveyed the ambiguous nature of war with a stellar cast including Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen and Tom Berenger. At the Globes, \"Platoon\" scored three wins, along with four Oscars, sharing Best Picture and Director honors.\n\n25 of 44\n\n1987, \"The Last Emperor\"\n\nStanley Bielecki Movie Collection/Getty Images\n\nBernardo Bertolucci's epic biography of the life and times of China's last dynastic emperor, Pu Yi, was a critical darling in 1987, and it showed. One of the rare films to sweep all Oscars it was nominated for, \"The Last Emperor\" also achieved four of five Golden Globe awards, the only loss being for John Lone, whose adult portrayal of Pu Yi failed to garner an Academy nomination.\n\n26 of 44\n\n1988, \"Rain Man\"\n\nMondadori Portfolio via Getty Images\n\nBarry Levinson had a critical hit on his hands that shed light on autism with this comedy-drama, featuring star turns from Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise as brothers from seemingly different worlds. \"Rain Man\" won Best Picture and Best Actor honors, later repeated by the Academy, with additional Oscars for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.\n\n27 of 44\n\n1989, \"Driving Miss Daisy\"\n\nJack Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nMorgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy bring to life an unlikely friendship in a unique examination of race relations in the South during its most turbulent time. \"Driving Miss Daisy\" won all three Golden Globes it was nominated for: Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Actress. All three honors were repeated during the Oscars, with an additional win for Best Makeup.\n\n28 of 44\n\n1990, \"Dances with Wolves\"\n\nTig Productions/Getty Images\n\nKevin Costner tried on a directing hat for the first time with \"Dances with Wolves,\" and boy did it ever fit. The epic Western, about a Union soldier who travels to the West and bonds with a local native tribe was a smash hit, winning three Globes and seven Oscars. Interestingly enough, while Costner won both Best Director trophies, he wasn't able to do the same with his on-screen performance, despite being nominated by both the HFPA and Academy.\n\n29 of 44\n\n1993, \"Schindler's List\"\n\nJ. Merritt/FilmMagic/Getty Images\n\nSteven Spielberg, after a number of box-office hits, finally hit awards gold with the somber tale of Oskar Schindler, a German factory owner who risked everything to save Jewish refugees by employing them in his shops. \"Schindler's List\" took home three out of six Golden Globes and seven of 12 Oscars.\n\n30 of 44\n\n1994, \"Forrest Gump\"\n\nMEGA/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images\n\nTom Hanks rode his portrayal of the slow-witted yet kindhearted Forrest Gump all the way to awards gold. For his efforts, the film was awarded three Globes and five Oscars, with shared wins for Best Picture, Best Director and, of course, Best Actor.\n\n31 of 44\n\n1996, \"The English Patient\"\n\nEric Robert/Sygma/Sygma via Getty Images\n\nThis star-crossed tale of doomed lovers over the backdrop of WWII Italy was destined to be a hit with filmgoers and critics. While \"The English Patient\" took home only two Golden Globes, for Best Picture and Best Original Score, it received nine of 12 Oscars it was nominated for.\n\n32 of 44\n\n1997, \"Titanic\"\n\n20th Century-Fox/Getty Images\n\nFor a film predicted to be a massive failure, few expected director James Cameron to end up as \"King of the World\" when \"Titanic\" broke box-office records and won major accolades, including five Golden Globes and later a whopping 11 of 15 Oscar nominations. Everyone seemed to do well award-wise with the exception of Leonardo DiCaprio, who would have to wait until 2015's \"The Revenant,\" where he would finally win both an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his performance.\n\n33 of 44\n\n1998, \"Shakespeare in Love\"\n\nRobin Platzer/Twin Images/Getty Images\n\nNot many were happy that \"Shakespeare in Love\" upset critical darling \"Saving Private Ryan\" during award season, but it managed to do so with Best Picture wins at both the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards. (\"Saving Private Ryan\" did win Best Picture Drama at the Globes.) The film, about an imaginary love affair between Shakespeare and Viola De Lesseps, took home three Globes and seven Oscars.\n\n34 of 44\n\n1999, \"American Beauty\"\n\nDreamWorks SKG/Getty Images\n\nWhat started as a play for writer Alan Ball in the wake of the Amy Fisher scandal of 1992 went on to become an unlikely champion during awards season. \"American Beauty,\" after a heavily publicized campaign, won three of six Golden Globes, later matching that amount, plus an additional two, at the Academy Awards. Shared Globes and Oscars included Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay and Best Director.\n\n35 of 44\n\n2000, \"Gladiator\"\n\nUniversal/Getty Images\n\nHarkening back to the days of epic Hollywood productions of Rome, \"Gladiator\" struck a chord with both audiences and critics in 2000 and found itself handsomely rewarded with awards gold. While \"Gladiator\" took home only two Globes, it won five Oscars. The only award shared between the two was for Best Picture.\n\n36 of 44\n\n2001, \"A Beautiful Mind\"\n\nUniversal/Getty Images\n\nGlobe and Oscar voters were of the same mind when they gave \"A Beautiful Mind\" Best Picture honors in 2001. For star Russell Crowe, it was his second straight appearance in a Best Picture film and the third in a row in which he would be nominated by both the Academy and the HFPA. Whereas he won Oscar gold for \"Gladiator,\" he would be snubbed for his performance as John Forbes Nash Jr. one year later, while receiving a nice consolation, a Golden Globe.\n\n37 of 44\n\n2002, \"Chicago\"\n\nKevin Winter/ImageDirect/Getty Images\n\nGlobe and Oscar voters felt \"All that Jazz\" when they gave the film adaptation of the classic Broadway musical \"Chicago\" top awards in 2002. Featuring a cast that included Richard Gere, Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah, \"Chicago\" was the first musical to win both an Oscar and a Golden Globe since 1968's \"Oliver!\"\n\n38 of 44\n\n2003, \"The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King\"\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nThe denouement to the groundbreaking \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, Peter Jackson was finally rewarded for his good works with both a Golden Globe and an Oscar. While some don't consider \"Return of the King\" to be the strongest of the series, one can argue that the awards came as a result of the entire trilogy, not just the one film.\n\n39 of 44\n\n2008, \"Slumdog Millionaire\"\n\nFergus McDonald/ Getty Images\n\nA true underdog in a tradition of feel-good movies, \"Slumdog Millionaire\" is the first to feature an all-Indian cast. Oscar and Globes voters loved this story of a poor Indian Muslim who found fame and fortune as a contestant on India's version of the once-popular \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" quiz show.\n\n40 of 44\n\n2011, \"The Artist\"\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nThis ode to old, old Hollywood was more than enough to strike a chord with both Golden Globe and Oscar voters. \"The Artist\" focuses on the relationship of an older silent film star and a rising young actress as silent cinema falls out of fashion and is replaced by the \"talkies.\" Of note, this is the first film since 1960's \"The Apartment\" to be shot in 100 percent black and white to win both an Oscar and a Golden Globe. (1993's \"Schindler's List\" had color sequences.)\n\n41 of 44\n\n2012, \"Argo\"\n\nDave M. Benett/WireImage/Gety Images\n\nDirected by Ben Affleck and written by Chris Terrio, \"Argo\" is adapted from U.S. Central Intelligence Agency operative Tony Mendez's book \"The Master of Disguise\" and Joshuah Bearman's 2007 Wired article \"The Great Escape: How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from Tehran.\"\n\n42 of 44\n\n2013, \"12 Years a Slave\"\n\nMichael Tran/FilmMagic/Getty Images\n\nAnother example of the Academy and the Globes agreeing, this adaptation directed by Steve McQueen of the 1853 slave narrative memoir \"Twelve Years a Slave\" by Solomon Northup, a New York State-born free African-American man who was kidnapped, found its share of controversy but also introduced audiences to Lupita Nyong'o, who also won both a Globe and Oscar for her performance.\n\n43 of 44\n\n2017, \"Moonlight\"\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nWith two shots to get it right, the Oscars and the Golden Globes were in prime position to sync up again with strong contenders \"La La Land\" and \"Moonlight.\" \"La La Land\" won the Golden Globe for Best Musical or Comedy, while \"Moonlight\" took home the Golden Globe for Best Drama. When the two went against each other for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, it was \"Moonlight\" that took home the top honor, but not without the presenters accidentally announcing \"La La Land\" first in a mix-up of envelopes that will go down as one of the Oscars more embarrassing moments. Maybe the presenters had the Golden Globes on their minds.\n\n44 of 44\n\n2019, \"Green Book\"\n\nA controversial choice to be sure, 2018's \"Green Book\" managed to outrun productions like Spike Lee's searing \"BlacKKKlansman\" and Marvel Studios' monumental \"Black Panther\" to snag the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, a feat that would be replicated at the Oscars to the chagrin of many who felt that of the three films that featured African-American leads (and stories), \"Green Book\" felt like the most inauthentic and, dare we say it, safe choice."
