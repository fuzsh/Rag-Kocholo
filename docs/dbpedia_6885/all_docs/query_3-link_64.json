        "text": "ROBERT REDFORD AWARD FOR ENGAGED ARTISTS honors a performer who has distinguished themselves not only in exemplary quality, skill and innovation of their craft, but also in their public commitment to social responsibility. Robert Redford received the inaugural award named in his honor in 2010. SDA is proud to honor Forest Whitaker — actor, philanthropist, social activist, and UNESCO Special Envoy for Peace and Reconciliation, with the Robert Redford Award. Whitaker is most known for his performance in The Last King of Scotland, for which he received an Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role. In 2012, he founded Whitaker Peace & Development Initiative (WPDI), which aims to promote the values of peace, reconciliation, and social development within communities impacted by conflict and violence. Whitaker received an honorary doctorate at USC in 2018.\n\nALUMNI SERVICE AWARD recognizes an alumnus/a who displays an extraordinary and unwavering commitment to the advancement of the School and the field of Dramatic Arts. SDA is honored to give this inaugural Alumni Service Award to Michele Dedeaux Engemann. Philanthropist, actor, and businesswoman, Engemann earned her Bachelor of Arts in Theatre from USC. She has continued her love for theatre education through her work with Nine O’Clock Players and as an active volunteer at the Pasadena Playhouse. Since graduation, Engemann has been an unflagging supporter and champion for the School of Dramatic Arts across USC and beyond. She was instrumental in the creation of SDA as an independent school at USC, and currently serves as a Trustee of the University.\n\nBROADWAY SPOTLIGHT AWARD recognizes an exemplary actor with a consistent and outstanding stage career (graduated after 2000). Donald Webber, Jr., who received his BFA in Acting in 2008, is one of only a few actors to have played both Hamilton and Burr in the renowned musical Hamilton — on Broadway and in Puerto Rico, opposite Lin Manuel Miranda. Other Broadway credits include Jersey Boys, Motown: The Musical and Holler If Ya Hear Me.\n\nPRODUCTION INNOVATION AWARD recognizes a standout talent in the field of production (design/lighting/costume/stage management/technical direction). Greg Holford is the recipient of the Production Innovation Award. Holford is an award-winning Creative Director and Show Director. He has successfully created and directed themed experiences and spectaculars all over the world for more than 35 years. Holford earned his Bachelor of Arts in Drama in 1980 and his MFA in Directing in 1982."
