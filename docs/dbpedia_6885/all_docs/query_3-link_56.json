        "text": "UPDATED with more info: It was a series of group efforts as the 76th annual Golden Globes were announced this morning, with several movies and TV series seeing multiple noms especially in the acting categories as the layout of awards season begins to emerge.\n\nAnnapurna’s Dick Cheney movie Vice led the way among all films Thursday with six nominations, followed with five apiece by Fox Searchlight’s The Favourite, Universal’s Green Book and Warner Bros’ A Star Is Born. Each got key acting noms along the way: Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Sam Rockwell for Vice; Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz for Favourite; Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali for Green Book; and Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga for Star Is Born.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nAll those pics are up for Best Motion Picture awards in drama or musical/comedy, repping a diverse list of titles from Marvel/Disney’s tentpole Black Panther (which also scored an Original Score and Original Song nod, though not Best Director for Ryan Coogler) to Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman (noms for Lee and stars John David Washington and Adam Driver), Warner Bros’ Crazy Rich Asians, Disney’s Mary Poppins Returns (Emily Blunt and Lin-Manuel Miranda noted), Fox’s musical biopic Bohemian Rhapsody and Annapurna’s Barry Jenkins pic If Beale Street Could Talk.\n\nBeale Street and Vice gave Annapurna, which has been going through some restructuring this past year, the most noms for a studio (10) along with Fox Searchlight, the award-season regular which won the Best Picture Oscar last year with The Shape of Water.\n\nOn the TV side, FX Networks topped the outlet list thanks to its The Assassination of Gianni Versace with four. Also in the mix is reigning Globes comedy series champ The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, back again in that category along with nods for Rachel Brosnahan and Alex Bornstein.\n\nThe Handmaid’s Tale‘s Elisabeth Moss and Yvonne Strahovski picked up acting noms too but not a series nom; that drama category includes surprises like Amazon’s ITV import Bodyguard with Richard Madden and Homecoming, along with BBC America’s Killing Eve, FX’s Pose and also its The Americans, which bid farewell this season and landed acting mentions for both leads Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys. Rhys is the reigning drama actor Emmy champ.\n\nHBO and Amazon Prime Video followed in total TV noms with nine, thanks to Sharp Objects and Barry for the former and Mrs. Maisel and A Very English Scandal for the latter (noms for the series, Hugh Grant and Ben Whishaw).\n\nAs per the recent trend, the broadcast networks were mostly left behind, with NBC’s This Is Us shut out altogether. The Good Place, just renewed for a fourth season, repped the nets with a comedy series nom and an acting nom for Kristen Bell. Amid the reboots, Debra Messing for Will & Grace and Candice Bergen (her 12th Globe nom) for Murphy Brown join Bell in the comedy acting category.\n\nThursday’s noms come ahead of the awards ceremony January 6 on NBC that will be co-hosted by Sandra Oh and Andy Samberg.\n\nCheck out the noms list below and stick with Deadline throughout the day for more news, commentary, analysis and reactions.\n\nThe 2019 Golden Globe Nominees\n\nMOTION PICTURES\n\nBest Motion Picture – Drama\n\nBlack Panther\n\nMarvel Studios; Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures\n\nBlacKkKlansman\n\nQC Entertainment / Blumhouse / Monkeypaw / 40 Acres and a Mule; Focus Features\n\nBohemian Rhapsody\n\nTwentieth Century Fox / Regency Enterprises; Twentieth Century Fox\n\nIf Beale Street Could Talk\n\nAnnapurna Pictures / Plan B Entertainment / We Pastel; Annapurna Pictures\n\nA Star Is Born\n\nWarner Bros.
