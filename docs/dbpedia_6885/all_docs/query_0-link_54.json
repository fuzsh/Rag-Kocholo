        "text": "You may be doing a dry January, but I assure you Hollywood isn’t. Sunday brings the Golden Globes, awards season’s tipsiest ceremony, a night so crazy that they hand out trophies for film and TV. While they’re a pivotal step in the Oscars race, the Globes are also good for a few completely unpredictable choices each year … which is of course what makes them so fun to try to predict. Below, you’ll find Nate Jones (movies) and Jen Chaney (TV) make their best guesses at who the Hollywood Foreign Press Association will pile their celestial honors upon this year.\n\nFilm\n\nBest Motion Picture, Drama\n\nBlacKkKlansman\n\nBohemian Rhapsody\n\nIf Beale Street Could Talk\n\nA Star Is Born\n\nBlack Panther\n\nA Star Is Born and Bohemian Rhapsody both decided that running in the more prestigious Globes category was worth the risk, and both were rewarded with prime nominations. A Star Is Born seems an easy choice here, as it’s got everything the Globes usually go for — an actor reinventing himself as a director, a singer reinventing herself as an actress, heck, there’s even a musical element. The Globes leaving Sam Elliott off the Supporting Actor ballot could suggest that the HFPA is slightly cooler on ASIB than everyone assumes, but I think Bradley Cooper’s film has the star power to pull through.\n\nShould win: A Star Is Born\n\nWill win: A Star Is Born\n\nBest Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture, Drama\n\nBradley Cooper, A Star Is Born\n\nWillem Dafoe, At Eternity’s Gate\n\nLucas Hedges, Boy Erased\n\nRami Malek, Bohemian Rhapsody\n\nJohn David Washington, BlacKkKlansman\n\nThis race looks like it will come down to Cooper versus Malek, who give two very different performances as two very different rock stars. (Though what I wouldn’t give to hear Jackson Maine sing “Fat Bottomed Girls” …) Each has been nominated twice before at the Globes without a win, and while I still think Cooper is the Oscar front-runner, a win for Rami Malek’s false teeth just feels like the kind of crazy little thing the Golden Globes would do.\n\nShould win: Bradley Cooper, A Star Is Born\n\nWill win: Rami Malek, Bohemian Rhapsody\n\nBest Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture, Drama\n\nGlenn Close, The Wife\n\nLady Gaga, A Star Is Born\n\nNicole Kidman, Destroyer\n\nMelissa McCarthy, Can You Ever Forgive Me?\n\nRosamund Pike, A Private War\n\nThe Globes gave Gaga a trophy back when she was just one of Ryan Murphy’s repertory players, and I don’t think they’ll be able to resist the temptation to do so again now that she’s headlining a major Oscar contender.\n\nShould win: Lady Gaga, A Star Is Born\n\nWill win: Lady Gaga, A Star Is Born\n\nBest Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy\n\nCrazy Rich Asians\n\nThe Favourite\n\nGreen Book\n\nMary Poppins Returns\n\nVice\n\nThe Globes fell absolutely head over heels for both Green Book and Vice, giving them basically every nomination they were eligible for, and a few I swear they weren’t. (Did Sam Rockwell really spend two hours fine-tuning his SNL reel, or did I just hallucinate it?) Each is among the more polarizing of this year’s awards field, and I’m looking forward to seeing Film Twitter going insane with rage when one of them inevitably takes home the win here. I think the HFPA will ultimately ride with Green Book, whose nominations in Director and Screenplay felt even more out-of-nowhere than Vice’s did. They could also avoid the whole mess by giving this to The Favourite, which wouldn’t piss anyone off. But where’s the fun in that?\n\nShould win: The Favourite\n\nWill win: Green Book\n\nBest Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy\n\nChristian Bale, Vice\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda, Mary Poppins Returns\n\nViggo Mortensen, Green Book\n\nRobert Redford, The Old Man & the Gun\n\nJohn C. Reilly, Stan & Ollie\n\nAnother Vice–Green Book face-off, and what a pair of faces they are! In one corner you have Viggo Mortensen, jaw agape, preparing to ingest an entire pizza pie; in the other, you have Christian Bale, snarling his way through prosthetics that make him look like a 60-year-old man from Wyoming. In a battle of two very big performances, I think the HFPA will likely go for the most striking transformation, and that’s Bale.\n\nShould win: Robert Redford, The Old Man & the Gun\n\nWill win: Christian Bale, Vice\n\nBest Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy\n\nEmily Blunt, Mary Poppins Returns\n\nOlivia Colman, The Favourite\n\nElsie Fisher, Eighth Grade\n\nCharlize Theron, Tully\n\nConstance Wu, Crazy Rich Asians\n\nIn the musical/comedy category, a tie goes to the actual musical. Blunt it is.\n\nShould win: Olivia Colman, The Favourite\n\nWill win: Emily Blunt, Mary Poppins Returns\n\nBest Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture\n\nMahershala Ali, Green Book\n\nTimothée Chalamet, Beautiful Boy\n\nAdam Driver, BlacKkKlansman\n\nRichard E. Grant, Can You Ever Forgive Me?\n\nSam Rockwell, Vice\n\nThe Globes neglected to honor Ali the year he took home the Oscar for Moonlight, going instead with Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s psychotic turn in Nocturnal Animals. Making it up to him this year for a movie Globes voters loved seems like a no-brainer.\n\nShould win: Richard E. Grant, Can You Ever Forgive Me?\n\nWill win: Mahershala Ali, Green Book\n\nBest Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture\n\nAmy Adams, Vice\n\nClaire Foy, First Man\n\nRegina King, If Beale Street Could Talk\n\nEmma Stone, The Favourite\n\nRachel Weisz, The Favourite\n\nIf you figure that the Favourite actresses will split their vote, and First Man isn’t winning anything, this one comes down to Adams versus King, both of whom are also competing against each other in Best Actress in a Limited Series. Adams is close to a shoe-in for Sharp Objects there, and while I could see voters spreading the wealth around, I think their love for the actress, and Vice, will power her to a win here, too.\n\nShould win: Regina King, If Beale Street Could Talk\n\nWill win: Amy Adams, Vice\n\nBest Director, Motion Picture\n\nBradley Cooper, A Star Is Born\n\nAlfonso Cuarón, Roma\n\nPeter Farrelly, Green Book\n\nSpike Lee, BlacKkKlansman\n\nAdam McKay, Vice\n\nCuarón has been vacuuming up Best Director honors all season long, and with Roma ineligible in Best Drama, the incentive to honor him here is even stronger.\n\nShould win: Alfonso Cuarón, Roma\n\nWill win: Alfonso Cuarón, Roma\n\nBest Screenplay, Motion Picture\n\nAlfonso Cuarón, Roma\n\nDeborah Davis and Tony McNamara, The Favourite\n\nBarry Jenkins, If Beale Street Could Talk\n\nAdam McKay, Vice\n\nPeter Farrelly, Nick Vallelonga, Brian Currie, Green Book\n\nIf Olivia Colman doesn’t take home Best Actress in a Comedy, Screenplay seems a likely spot to reward The Favourite’s barbed wit. But keep an eye out here for Vice, the 2018 screenplay that certainly has the most writing.\n\nShould win: Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, The Favourite\n\nWill win: Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, The Favourite\n\nBest Original Song, Motion Picture\n\n“All the Stars,” Black Panther\n\n“Girl in the Movies,” Dumplin’\n\n“Requiem for a Private War,” A Private War\n\n“Revelation,” Boy Erased\n\n“Shallow,” A Star Is Born\n\nThe other day I found myself singing, “In the show-how, show-how-er / in the shawa-shawa-shower.” Anyway, it’s gonna be “Shallow.”\n\nShould win: “Shallow,” A Star Is Born\n\nWill win: “Shallow,” A Star Is Born\n\nBest Original Score, Motion Picture\n\nMarco Beltrami, A Quiet Place\n\nAlexandre Desplat, Isle of Dogs\n\nLudwig Göransson, Black Panther\n\nJustin Hurwitz, First Man\n\nMarc Shaiman, Mary Poppins Returns\n\nMary Poppins feels like it’s lost a bit of momentum recently, which could provide an opportunity for First Man to eke out a win here. But you won’t catch me betting against a musical in Best Score.\n\nShould win: I’m writing in Nicholas Britell, whose Beale Street score somehow missed the cut at the Globes.\n\nWill win: Marc Shaiman, Mary Poppins Returns\n\nBest Motion Picture, Animated\n\nIncredibles 2\n\nIsle of Dogs\n\nMirai\n\nRalph Breaks the Internet\n\nSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\n\nPixar has only gone home empty-handed in the Globes’ animation category once, in 2011, when Cars 2 lost to Adventures of Tintin. I think this is the year another of the studio’s sequels loses to another groundbreaking comics adaptation.\n\nShould win: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\n\nWill win: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\n\nBest Motion Picture, Foreign Language\n\nCapernaum\n\nGirl\n\nNever Look Away\n\nRoma\n\nShoplifters\n\nIn some precursors, voters have chosen to treat Best Foreign-Language Film as a sort of runner-up award, giving it to Paweł Pawlikowski’s black-and-white romance Cold War after rewarding Roma higher up the ballot. But Cold War didn’t make it in at the Globes, and given the ceremony’s relative lack of craft categories for Alfonso Cuarón’s film to compete in, I don’t see anything standing in Roma’s way here.\n\nShould win: Roma\n\nWill win: Roma\n\nTV\n\nBest Television Series, Drama\n\nThe Americans\n\nBodyguard\n\nHomecoming\n\nKilling Eve\n\nPose\n\nIn most of its TV categories, especially the big ones, Golden Globe voters tend to lock into the newest, buzziest shows. That’s why, even though The Americans deserves to win in this category, it won’t. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association has never nominated it before, so its inclusion counts as the group’s way of making up for that error. But the FX spy series may seem too much like “old news” to actually win.\n\nAll four of the other nominees are coming off of their first seasons, but I think the choice will come down to two: Killing Eve, the British spy thriller that happens to stars Globes co-host Sandra Oh, or Homecoming, the Amazon psychological thriller that happens to star Julia Roberts in her television-series debut. Yes, that’s the same Julia Roberts who has nine Golden Globe nominations to her credit and three wins for her film work. The HFPA kinda likes her, and I suspect its members may appreciate Homecoming’s ’70s conspiracy vibe enough to give it the edge.\n\nShould win: The Americans\n\nWill win: Homecoming\n\nBest Television Series, Comedy\n\nBarry\n\nThe Good Place\n\nThe Kominsky Method\n\nKidding\n\nThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\nThe last time the Golden Globes gave the best comedy award to the same series two years in a row was in 2010 and 2011, when Glee scooped up back-to-back wins. The rarity of consecutive victories doesn’t rule out the possibility that the Globe will once again go to The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, last year’s victor. But I think that makes it less likely.\n\nAs for which one out of the other four nominees has the best chance, honestly, this is pure guesswork. As much as the HFPA loves Jim Carrey, I’m not sure the dark and quirky Kidding will win over enough voters. On the dark and quirky front, I suspect Barry has a better chance of winning. Meanwhile, The Kominsky Method has a couple of things that work in its favor: celebrated Hollywood veterans (Michael Douglas and Alan Arkin) as its stars and the fact that if it is announced as the winner, 70 percent of viewers will go, “What the hell is The Kominsky Method?” Only at the Golden Globes is that an advantage, one that I refer to as the Mozart in the Jungle Rule.\n\nAnd yet, something — God? A demon who looks like Ted Danson? — is telling me that The Good Place is going to win this thing. The series isn’t new, but it’s taken a while for it to develop a fervent following, so it still has some fresh shine on it. Plus, the Golden Globes has been kind to another Mike Schur-produced series, Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Also, if The Good Place wins, Twitter will explode. I realize social-media response has nothing to do with how awards should be decided, but this is the Golden Globes and normal standards simply don’t apply here.\n\nShould win: Barry or The Good Place\n\nWill win: The Good Place\n\nBest Limited Series or Motion Picture Made for Television\n\nThe Assassination of Gianni Versace\n\nEscape at Dannemora\n\nSharp Objects\n\nA Very English Scandal\n\nThe Alienist\n\nHBO has won in this category more than any other network, which seemingly gives Sharp Objects an advantage. The Assassination of Gianni Versace won the Emmy for Outstanding Limited Series, which seemingly gives that entry an advantage. (The Emmys and the Globes don’t always align in this category, but they frequently do.) Escape at Dannemora may be top of mind since it just finished its run, plus it boasts movie-star talent in front of and behind the camera, both advantages as well. Still, I am betting on A Very English Scandal, the BBC mini-series about the relationship between MP Jeremy Thorpe (Hugh Grant) and his persistent ex-lover (Ben Whishaw), to potentially sway the crucial U.K.-based and European bloc of members of the HFPA.\n\nShould win: Sharp Objects\n\nWill win: A Very English Scandal\n\nBest Actor in a Television Series, Drama\n\nJason Bateman, Ozark\n\nStephan James, Homecoming\n\nBilly Porter, Pose\n\nRichard Madden, Bodyguard\n\nMatthew Rhys, The Americans\n\nThe consensus among Gold Derby’s Golden Globe predictors, including myself, is that this will either go to James, who’s had a breakout year thanks to his performances in both Homecoming and If Beale Street Could Talk, or Matthew Rhys, who won the Emmy in this category for his superb portrayal of Philip Jennings on The Americans. (I’ll also say it’s possible that Billy Porter, who infused Pose with so much spirit and pathos, could pull off an upset.) While the Globes usually trend toward whatever’s new, sometimes they give a trophy to an actor who’s clearly long overdue, much like they did with Jon Hamm in 2015. I guess what I’m saying is that Matthew Rhys will be this year’s Jon Hamm.\n\nShould win: Matthew Rhys, The Americans\n\nWill win: Matthew Rhys, The Americans\n\nBest Actress in a Television Series, Drama\n\nCaitriona Balfe, Outlander\n\nElisabeth Moss, The Handmaid’s Tale\n\nSandra Oh, Killing Eve\n\nJulia Roberts, Homecoming\n\nKeri Russell, The Americans\n\nLike her Americans co-star, does Keri Russell also deserve a long-overdue Globe? Yes. Will she get one? Mmmm, not sure. I don’t see Moss winning again or Balfe winning for a first time. Like the Best Drama category, I think this comes down to Killing Eve and Oh versus Homecoming and Roberts. Both women give terrific, award-worthy performances. But it’s harder for me to imagine the HFPA overlooking Roberts.\n\nShould win: Keri Russell, The Americans\n\nWill win: Julia Roberts, Homecoming\n\nBest Actor in a Television Series, Musical or Comedy\n\nJim Carrey, Kidding\n\nSacha Baron Cohen, Who Is America?\n\nMichael Douglas, The Kominsky Method\n\nDonald Glover, Atlanta\n\nBill Hader, Barry\n\nIf Michael Douglas were not in the mix, I’d say the trophy here would either go to Jim Carrey, a favorite of the HFPA, or Bill Hader, who already won the Emmy for Barry. But Douglas, a 12-time Globes nominee, five-time winner, and previous recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award is in the mix, and my best guess is that voters will lean his way.\n\nShould win: Bill Hader, Barry\n\nWill win: Michael Douglas, The Kominsky Method\n\nBest Actress in a Television Series, Musical or Comedy\n\nKristen Bell, The Good Place\n\nCandice Bergen, Murphy Brown\n\nAlison Brie, GLOW\n\nRachel Brosnahan, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\nDebra Messing, Will & Grace\n\nRachel Brosnahan, last year’s winner, is fantastic in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. But, unlike at the Emmys, there are rarely back-to-back wins in this category. (Fun fact: Julia Louis-Dreyfus has been nominated five times for Veep but has never won — not even once!) For that reason, I doubt Brosnahan will win. Instead, I’m looking at either Alison Brie, who goes from big to subtle and funny to dramatic in GLOW, or Kristen Bell, who strikes me as a strong contender, especially if the voters opt not to reward The Good Place for Best Comedy.\n\nShould win: Honestly, it’s a three-way tie between Brosnahan, Bell, and Brie.\n\nWill win: Kristen Bell, The Good Place\n\nBest Actor in a Limited Series or Movie Made for Television\n\nAntonio Banderas, Genius: Picasso\n\nDaniel Brühl, The Alienist\n\nDarren Criss, The Assassination of Gianni Versace\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch, Patrick Melrose\n\nHugh Grant, A Very English Scandal\n\nDarren Criss’s performance as Andrew Cunanan in The Assassination of Gianni Versace was a breakout moment for the actor. It won him an Emmy, and there’s a good chance it could win him a Golden Globe, too. But he faces some tough competition, particularly from Hugh Grant, who does some of the best work of his career as the smug, duplicitous Jeremy Thorpe in A Very English Scandal. I’m betting that the HFPA will find Grant too hard to resist.\n\nShould win: Hugh Grant, A Very English Scandal\n\nWill win: Hugh Grant, A Very English Scandal\n\nBest Actress in a Limited Series or Movie Made for Television\n\nAmy Adams, Sharp Objects\n\nPatricia Arquette, Escape at Dannemora\n\nConnie Britton, Dirty John\n\nLaura Dern, The Tale\n\nRegina King, Seven Seconds\n\nWow, is this a competitive category. As strong as all the contenders are, though, I think it will come down to three nominees: the fantastic Regina King in Seven Seconds; Patricia Arquette, who physically transforms into Tilly Mitchell in Escape at Dannemora; and Amy Adams, whose damaged Camille dominates Sharp Objects. All three of these women have been nominated at the Globes before, but Adams has the most nods to her credit — counting her two this year for Sharp Objects and Vice, she has nine — as well as two wins. In other words, the HFPA likes her, and with a selection committee this small (there are roughly 90 members of the Foreign Press Association), a track record of being liked matters.\n\nShould win: Amy Adams, Sharp Objects\n\nWill win: Amy Adams, Sharp Objects\n\nBest Supporting Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Limited Series, or Motion Picture Made for Television\n\nAlan Arkin, The Kominsky Method\n\nKieran Culkin, Succession\n\nÉdgar Ramírez, The Assassination of Gianni Versace\n\nBen Whishaw, A Very English Scandal\n\nHenry Winkler, Barry\n\nThis is a tough call. Both Winkler and Arkin are industry veterans — a potential plus with the HFPA. A wave of support for The Assassination of Gianni Versace could push Ramírez into the winner’s column, and let’s not overlook Kieran Culkin, the best smarmy entitled richie on TV last year. But I keep getting stuck on Ben Whishaw, who is heartbreaking and maddening in equal measure in A Very English Scandal. I think that mini-series could wind up doing a mini-version of the Limited Series sweep Big Little Lies pulled off last year.\n\nShould win: Ben Whishaw or Henry Winkler\n\nWill win: Ben Whishaw, A Very English Scandal\n\nBest Supporting Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Limited Series, or Motion Picture Made for Television\n\nAlex Borstein, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\nPatricia Clarkson, Sharp Objects\n\nPenélope Cruz, The Assassination of Gianni Versace\n\nThandie Newton, Westworld\n\nYvonne Strahovski, The Handmaid’s Tale\n\nWhile all the women in this category are deserving, the two front-runners seem to be Alex Borstein, nominated for Mrs. Maisel for the first time this year, and Patricia Clarkson, the passive-aggressive mommie worstest in Sharp Objects. I can imagine either of these ladies winning, so it’s ultimately going to come down to whether the HFPA love for Mrs. Maisel is stronger than its love for Sharp Objects. (I also wouldn’t rule out the possibility of an upset, perhaps by Cruz.) But my hypothesis is that Clarkson will prevail.\n\nShould win: Patricia Clarkson, Sharp Objects\n\nWill win: Patricia Clarkson, Sharp Objects"
