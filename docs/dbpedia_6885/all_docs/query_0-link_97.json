        "text": "The Golden Globes—Hollywood’s annual Oscar-adjacent celebration of the beginning of awards season—announced their nominees Thursday morning with a predictable showering of love on films like A Star Is Born, The Favourite, Green Book, and Vice. The television nominations held a few more surprises as the members of the 90-odd Hollywood Foreign Press Association did their best to hack through the thicket of peak TV. But in both mediums, the Globes’ ultimate consideration has always been superstardom, and most categories were thus laden with famous names and blockbuster hits.\n\nThe Globes divide awards into “comedy or musical” and drama, but a couple of ostensible musicals (A Star Is Born and Bohemian Rhapsody) competed as dramas, while some of the leading comedies (Vice, Green Book, and The Favourite) are centered on dark and dramatic themes. Either way, most of the expected Oscar contenders were featured in one category or another, with the biggest snubs being acclaimed indie dramas like First Reformed, box-office disappointments like First Man, and Steve McQueen’s heist thriller Widows.\n\nIn television, the Globes largely fêted streaming television and cable heavyweights like FX and HBO. Top nominees included the final season of The Americans, the Ryan Murphy shows American Crime Story and Pose, Netflix’s recent hits Bodyguard and The Kominsky Method, and Amazon’s Homecoming and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. The Globes often suffer from “shiny new toy” syndrome, lavishing nominations on new shows and forgetting past winners. Just as important is spotlighting big stars who can attend the January 6 ceremony, which will air on NBC at 8 p.m. EST and be hosted by Sandra Oh and Andy Samberg.\n\nIn that regard, the TV categories were just as glitzy as the film ones. Julia Roberts, Jim Carrey, Michael Douglas, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Candice Bergen were among the television nominees, further proof that whatever wall once existed between the two mediums has all but vanished. Still, at the Globes, the movie awards are the main event, attempting to function as a preview for the coming Oscars (in television, the prime award remains the summer’s Emmy trophy).\n\nThe big contenders, then, include Adam McKay’s Dick Cheney biopic Vice, which topped the field with six nominations despite still being embargoed for reviews; Bradley Cooper’s A Star Is Born, which has been a box-office sensation and cemented its Oscar-front-runner status here; the dark royal comedy The Favourite, which nabbed acting nominations for all three of its female stars; and the crowd-pleasing race-relations comedy Green Book. Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman, a surprise summer hit, also had a good showing with four nominations, as did Disney’s upcoming Mary Poppins Returns.\n\nAlfonso Cuarón’s Roma, Netflix’s big awards player this year, was confined to the Foreign-Language Film category but also secured Best Director and Screenplay nominations. If Beale Street Could Talk, Barry Jenkins’s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Moonlight, was nominated for Best Picture and Best Screenplay, while Regina King was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the film—altogether a strong impression for a film that takes a subtler approach than some of the Globes’ big favorites. Perhaps the most baffling snub was of Sam Elliott, the dynamite supporting actor of A Star Is Born, who has been tipped for Oscar success. But the Globes have never synced up every category to the Academy Awards, and many other looming precursors—guild nominations, critics’ awards—will soon offer their own predictions.\n\nThe full list of nominees:\n\nBest Picture, Drama\n\nBlack Panther\n\nBlacKkKlansman\n\nBohemian Rhapsody\n\nIf Beale Street Could Talk\n\nA Star Is Born\n\nBest Actor, Drama\n\nBradley Cooper, A Star Is Born\n\nWillem Dafoe, At Eternity’s Gate\n\nLucas Hedges, Boy Erased\n\nRami Malek, Bohemian Rhapsody\n\nJohn David Washington, BlacKkKlansman\n\nBest Actress, Drama\n\nGlenn Close, The Wife\n\nLady Gaga, A Star Is Born\n\nNicole Kidman, Destroyer\n\nMelissa McCarthy, Can You Ever Forgive Me?\n\nRosamund Pike, A Private War\n\nBest Picture, Musical or Comedy\n\nCrazy Rich Asians\n\nThe Favourite\n\nGreen Book\n\nMary Poppins Returns\n\nVice\n\nBest Actor, Musical or Comedy\n\nChristian Bale, Vice\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda, Mary Poppins Returns\n\nViggo Mortensen, Green Book\n\nRobert Redford, The Old Man & the Gun\n\nJohn C.
