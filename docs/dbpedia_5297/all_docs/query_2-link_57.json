        "text": "The Regent School of Law Moot Court Board began in 1993 and has continued for several years under the direction of Professor Michael Hernandez. The Board began with only eight members, but they had a goal to present opportunities to help Regent Law School students to develop skills to be successful advocates in the legal profession.\n\nThe Moot Court Board included this mission in its Constitution, which it adopted in 1994. Since that time, the Moot Court Board has expanded to up to 12 members and includes positions for up to 16 associates. The Moot Court Board works within the Regent Law School community by hosting the annual Regent Cup Competition in the fall for second and third-year law school students, and the annual 1L Moot Court Competition in the spring. The Moot Court Board also assists Regent students in the development of oral and written advocacy skills through participation in various external regional and national competitions."
