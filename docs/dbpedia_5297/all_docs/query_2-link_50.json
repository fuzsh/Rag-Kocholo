        "text": "This article provides the first history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a legal entity. It makes two contributions. First, this history recasts the story of the so-called first disestablishment, revealing that it was longer and more contentious than is often assumed. Disestablishment produced a body of corporate law encoded with strong theological assumptions. Because corporate law was the primary mechanism for regulating churches, this created problems for groups like Roman Catholics and Latter-day Saints who did not share the law's theological commitments. Far from being settled in the early 1830s, the first disestablishment continued to spawn bitter legal battles into the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Second, this article reveals legal personality as one of the key points of conflict between the Latter-day Saints and American society. This is a useful corrective to accounts that emphasize polygamy and theocracy as the points of legal contention. An understanding of the history of the church as a legal entity supplements these stories by revealing how the hard-fought legal battles of the late nineteenth century can be seen as an extension of the process of legal disestablishment that began during the American Revolution.\n\n3 Doctrine & Covenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 20:1 (2013) (hereinafter D&C). The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints accepts three volumes of scripture in addition to the Bible: The Book of Mormon, the Pearl of Great Price, and the Doctrine & Covenants. The latter is a collection of “revelations” published by Joseph Smith and his successors. In the modern edition, each revelation is designated as a numbered “section” with verses. The revelations in the D&C can have very complicated textual histories as they were often revised by Smith and his successors over a period of several years. Unless otherwise noted, all references are to section and verse numbers in the 2013 edition published by the LDS Church.\n\n6 “Reform” refers to the Calvinist as opposed to the Lutheran and Anglican wings of the Protestant Reformation. In its various permutations, it was arguably the dominant theological tradition in the early Republic. As one historian has remarked, “A substantial part of the history of theology in early America was an extended debate, stretching over more than two centuries, about the meaning and the truth of Calvinism.” E. Brooks Holifield, Theology in America: Christian Thought from the Age of the Puritans to the Civil War 10 (2003). Among other differences, the Reformed tradition tended to emphasize a congregational approach to ecclesiology at the expense of hierarchical authority. The most extreme version of this approach to church government emerged among New England Puritans: “The heart of the church theory was the church covenant. Regenerate men, the theory ran, acquire a liberty to observe God's commanding will, and when a company of them are met together and can satisfy each other that they are men of faith, they covenant together, and out of their compact create a church. Therefore each society is an autonomous unit, and no bishops and archbishops, no synods and assemblies, have any power, either from the Bible or from nature, to dictate to an independent and holy congregation.” Perry Miller, The New England Mind: The Seventeenth Century 435 (1983). Many of the particulars of Puritan ecclesiology were controversial within the Reformed tradition, but their emphasis on lay control and hostility to ecclesiastical hierarchy was typical.\n\n26 The so-called Duke's Laws promulgated immediately after the English takeover of New Amsterdam required local parishes to elect overseers who could then choose any ordained Protestant minister for the local church, who was paid from taxes collected by the local courts. This system was later codified in the 1693 Ministry Act, which decreed that in each parish “there shall be called, inducted, and established, a good sufficient Protestant Ministry.” Quoted in Mensch, supra note 4, at 444. The dispute over whether there was a single established church in the colony centered on whether this law, which was silent on the question, required that the minister be Anglican.\n\n31 See, e.g., David Keith Stott, Organizing the Church as a Religious Association in 1830, in Sustaining the Law: Joseph Smith's Legal Encounters 113–39 (Gordon A. Madsen, Jeffrey N. Walker, & John W. Welch eds., 2014); H. Michael Marquardt, An Appraisal of Manchester as Location for the Organization of the Church, Sunstone, Feb. 1992, at 49. Despite extensive searches by multiple researchers, no certificate filed with the county clerk to organize as a religious corporation, as required by the 1813 New York law, has ever been located in New York for Joseph Smith's Church of Christ. See Larry C. Porter, A Study of the Origins of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the States of New York and Pennsylvania, 1816–1833 155–60 (2000) (recounting an exhaustive archival search for the document). According to Marquardt, no legal organization was attempted in New York and the alleged incorporation was a later invention designed to fool creditors in Ohio. However, Marquardt, who is not a lawyer, fails to explain how an earlier incorporation would have frustrated collection efforts against the LDS Church or its officers in Ohio. Nor does his article point to any legal proceedings in Ohio in which the New York incorporation was invoked to shield Latter-day Saint debtors, although there were numerous collection actions brought against Joseph Smith in the wake of the failure of the Kirtland Safety Society.\n\n34 See JSP, H1:364 (“<We> made known also to the <those> members who had already been baptized, that we had received commandment to organize the Church: and according to accordingly <we> met to [sic] together, <(being about 30 <six> in number) besides a number who were beleiving[sic]—met with us> on Tuesday the Sixth day of Aprile in the year of our A.D. A thousand & One thousand, Eight hundred and thirty . . . .”). In this passage from the JSP transcriptions, the angle brackets indicate interlinear insertions in the original document, and I reproduce the original strikeouts.\n\n36 David Keith Stott suggests that rather than trying to incorporate Smith and his associates were deliberately creating an unincorporated association. However, it is anachronistic to imagine that an unincorporated association was a particular legal status that would have been aimed at in the April 6, 1830, meeting. Unincorporated association was simply the default legal treatment for any religious group. Thus the nascent Mormon movement was already an unincorporated association prior to April 6, 1830. Stott reads subsequent references to being organized under New York law as referring to the deliberate invoking of unincorporated association as a distinct legal status, but all of the sources he cites that discuss unincorporated association in this way are from the second half of the nineteenth century, when ideas of corporate law were far more developed. The concept was not used this way in New York in the 1820s and 1830s.\n\n37 David Whitmer, Mormonism, Kansas City Journal, June 5, 1881, at 1. It is worth noting that Whitmer was hostile to the retroactive alteration of earlier sources. A close early supporter of Joseph Smith, he objected to the increasing institutionalization of the Mormon movement and later broke with Joseph Smith in part over this issue. He was also scathing in his criticisms of retroactive editing of Smith's revelations. Nevertheless, in later reminiscences he insisted that a legal incorporation occurred on April 6, 1830. He was also the scribe who recorded the earliest extant copy of D&C 20, containing the “agreeable to the laws of our country” language. See JSP, MRB:3–391.\n\n45 The seminal scholarly studies are D. Michael Quinn, Early Mormonism and the Magic World View (rev. 2d ed. 1998); Bushman, Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism, supra note 2. While I use the term “folk magic” in the text, the term is deeply problematic as it lacks any clear meaning and has generally been used as a derogatory term for disfavored spiritual practices. See generally Randall G. Styers, Making Magic: Religion, Magic, and Science in the Modern World (2004). I choose to use the term because in the context of Joseph Smith's use of legal formalities, it is precisely the elite disdain and hostility conveyed by the term “magic” that is important. Other writers on Mormon history, however, have used alternative terms such as “cunning-folk traditions.” See Jonathan A. Stapley, The Power of Godliness: Mormon Liturgy and Cosmology 105 (2018); See also Samuel Morris Brown, Joseph Smith's Translation: The Words and Worlds of Early Mormonism 25 (2020) (discussing the terminological difficulties with “magic” in the Mormon context).\n\n47 See 1813 N.Y. Laws 114. Compare The Witchcraft Act 1735, 9 Geo. 2 c. 5, §IV (“[I]f any Person shall…use any kind of Witchcraft, Sorcery, Inchantment, or Conjuration, or undertake to tell Fortunes, or pretend, from his or her Skill or Knowledge in any occult or crafty Science, to discover where or in what manner any Goods or Chattels, supposed to have been stolen or lost, may be found, every Person, so offending, being thereof lawfully convicted on Indictment or Information in that part of Great Britain called England, or on Indictment or Libel in that part of Great Britain called Scotland, shall, for every such Offence, suffer Imprisonment by the Space of one whole Year without Bail or Mainprize”). See also Christine A. Corcos, The Scrying Game: The First Amendment, the Rise of Spiritualism, and the State Prohibition and Regulation of the Crafty Sciences, 1848–1944, 38 Whittier Law Review 59, 72–76 (2017) (discussing the regulation of “crafty sciences” in the early Republic); L. Arthur Wilder, Legal Status of Seers and Necromancers, 21 Case & Comment 445 (1914) (discussing the legal regulation of folk magic in the United States).\n\n52 Tellingly, on June 9, 1830, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdry issued written licenses “signifying & proveing that [the holder] is a Priest of this Church of Christ established & regularly Organized in these last days AD 1830 on the 6th. day of April.” JSP, D1:146–48. See generally Donald Q. Cannon, Licensing in the Early Church, 22 BYU Studies Quarterly 96 (1982). These seem to be the documents referred to by the Palmyra Reflector. Three licenses from the June 1830 conference survive. They belong to Joseph Smith, Sr., John Whitmer, and Christian Whitmer. Each references a different office. John Whitmer is “an Apostle of Jesus Christ, an Elder of this Church of Christ,” Christian Whitmer is “a Teacher,” and Joseph Smith Sr. is a “priest.” It is possible that the designation of a “priest” was done in part so that licenses would use the title contained in the New York tax statute. Other licenses issued at the June 1830 conference do not survive, but surviving documents suggest that a license as a “priest” was issued to Hyrum Smith, Joseph Smith's brother, who at the time had been assessed for taxes on a shop that he was renting. It is possible that he was the person who applied for tax exemption. E-mail from Mark Staker, Historical Department, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to Nathan B. Oman, William & Mary Law School (August 28, 2019) (copy in the author's possession). Unfortunately, other than the notice in the Palmyra Reflector, no other documents regarding this petition seem to have survived.\n\n59 Years after Smith's death, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, now known as the Community of Christ, unsuccessfully brought suit to quiet title to the temple in an effort to establish itself as the legitimate successor to Smith's church. In the end, the court, after adopting a proposed finding of fact by the Reorganized Church's counsel as obitur dicta, denied relief on the grounds that the plaintiff was not in possession of the property. Eventually, the Reorganized Church quieted title by adverse possession. For many years, the leaders of the Reorganized Church claimed that the court in the Kirtland Temple Suit had declared the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to be the legitimate successor to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints founded by Joseph Smith, Jr., although ultimately the Ohio court made no such holding. The litigation is recounted in detail in Loving, supra note 53. While the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints did not participate in the litigation over the Kirtland Temple, members of the LDS Church eventually became aware of the Reorganized Church's legal claims and produced their own rebuttal. See Paul E. Reimann, The Reorganized Church and the Civil Courts (1961).\n\n64 This business partnership found its way into Latter-day Saints scripture in a way that would have lasting effects on the movement. During his time in Kirtland, Smith received a number of revelations relating to the affairs of the United Firm. See D&C 78, D&C 82, D&C 92, D&C 104. See also Mark Lyman Staker, Hearken, O Ye People: The Historical Setting of Joseph Smith's Ohio Revelations 230–37 (2010) (discussing the context for some of these revelations). When these revelations were subsequently published, however, they were edited. The term “United Firm” was replaced with the term “united order,” and references to the Firm's “mercantile and publishing establishments” were changed to “the affairs of the storehouse of the poor.” See Parkin, supra note 62, at 37–53. Thus, what began as a series of revelations about a business partnership became a set of texts about a more cosmic and utopian scheme. Drawing on these texts a generation later, Brigham Young would use the term “united orders” for Latter-day Saints cooperatives aimed at establishing the autarky of the Great Basin Zion against the integrating force of American capitalism after the Civil War. See Leonard Arrington, Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of the Latter-Day Saints, 1830–1900 at 323–52 (1958) (recounting Brigham Young's efforts to create the “United Order of Enoch” in Utah territory). From there, the term “united order” has passed into Mormon thought and language as a shorthand reference to an ideal community marked by righteousness, economic egalitarianism, and cooperation for the common good. What began as a religiously directed business firm became central to Mormonism's utopian imagination.\n\n69 In 1816, Ohio passed “An act to prohibit the issuing and circulating of unauthorized bank paper.” Act of Jan. 27, 1816, ch. 355, 1815 Ohio Laws 904. Section 9 of the law provided that “all bonds, bills, notes, or contracts” of unincorporated banks “are hereby declared null and void.” Id. at § 9. However, sections 11 and section 12 of the act went on to declare that “every stockholder” and “the persons who were interested in such bank” were “jointly and severally answerable, in their individual capacity, for the whole amount of the bonds, bills, notes, and contracts of such bank.” See id. at §§ 11–12. The contradiction between these two sections left the enforceability of the Kirtland Safety Society notes in doubt. The uncertainty was further exacerbated by the fact that the validity of the 1816 law was itself open to doubt. In 1824, the Ohio legislature passed a further law that declared, “no action shall be brought upon any notes, or bills hereafter issued by any bank . . . unless such bank. . . . Shall be incorporated and authorized by the laws of this state to issue such bills and notes.” See Act of Jan. 28, 1824, §23, 1823 Ohio Laws 1422; See also Hill et. al., supra note 65, at 437–41 (discussing the effect of legal uncertainty on the value of Kirtland Safety Society paper).\n\n86 Act of Feb. 6, 1835, 1834 Ill. Laws 559, 559 (“An Act concerning Religious Societies”). Earlier scholars have suggested that during his life-time Joseph Smith and his associates were unaware of the restrictions on the ability of church corporations to own more than five acres (later increased to ten acres) under Illinois law. See Dallin H. Oaks & Joseph I. Bentley, Joseph Smith and Legal Process: In the Wake of the Steamboat Nauvoo, 1976 Brigham Young University Law Review 735–82, at 776 (1976) (“There is no evidence that Joseph Smith or other Church leaders were ever aware of this 10-acre limitation on Church ownership of land.”). However, Oaks and Bentley wrote prior to the discovery of the proposed incorporation by special statute. If one assumes that this statute was deliberately drafted, then it suggests that as early as 1840, Joseph Smith and his associates were likely aware of the mortmain provision in the Illinois general incorporation statute.\n\n98 See, e.g., Incorporation of Churches and Religious Societies, ch. 73, 1903 Utah Laws 62, 62 (allowing a “bishop, president, trustee in trust, [or] president of stake” to organize as a corporation sole). See also text accompanying infra notes 147–49. In the succession crisis after the murder of Joseph Smith in 1844, the office of trustee-in-trust proved important. At the time of his death, there were a half dozen or more different theories about who was to succeed him as leader of the LDS Church. See generally D. Michael Quinn, The Mormon Succession Crisis of 1844, 16 BYU Studies 187 (1976). Ultimately, Brigham Young and the Quorum of the Twelve persuaded the bulk of the Latter-day Saints to accept their claim to carry forward Smith's work. However, while Young and the Twelve succeeded in defeating the claims of Smith's counselor, Sidney Rigdon, at a conference in August 1844, it was not until December 27, 1847, that the First Presidency, the senior governing council of the LDS Church, was formally reorganized. See Ronald W. Walker, Six Days in August: Brigham Young and the Succession Crisis of 1844, in A Firm Foundation: Church Organization and Administration 161 (David J. Whittaker & Arnold K. Garr eds., 2011); Quinn, supra. While Brigham Young was signing letters as “Prest. of the Church of L.D.S.” as early as December 1844, his precise ecclesiastical authority beyond his undoubted title as president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, a secondary governing council, remained ambiguous for over three years. See id. at 216. However, the office of trustee-in-trust allowed Young and the Quorum of the Twelve to gain control of LDS Church assets without resolving the question of their precise ecclesiastical authority. Likely based on the certificate of incorporation filed by Joseph Smith, at his death many Latter-day Saints, including his widow, Emma Smith, assumed that only the president of the LDS Church could act as trustee-in-trust. Young and his associates, however, rejected this position, and they succeeded in having a series of loyal, lesser church officials appointed to this office. Brigham Young thus used the office of trustee-in-trust to control LDS Church assets prior to settling the precise nature of the succession to the First Presidency.\n\n117 Id. § 3. The 1878 statute was silent on many issues and there was never any case law construing it. Still, one may speculate about the legal risks in Richards's proposal. First, relatively complex corporate formalities had to be maintained, or the wards and stakes may have risked losing their corporate existence. Second, the acquisition and transfer of property required that the complex internal governance procedures of the corporations be followed, lest the transfers be subject to later challenges. Third, upon the death or release of ward or stake officers serving as corporate trustees, relatively complex legal formalities had to be observed to replace them. Finally, because the corporations were self-governing entities, the LDS Church hierarchy risked losing control over LDS Church property if enough local congregants wished to go their own way. All of these factors likely contributed to John Taylor's hesitancy in forming such corporations in the early 1880s, and his insistence that the governing board of trustees be as large as possible under then existing Utah law, likely reflected concern about concentrating power over LDS Church property in the hands of local leaders. See Franklin S. Richards, “Reminiscences,” Church History Library, Salt Lake City, Utah (discussing Taylor's response to the proposal). Records of these local corporations housed in the LDS Church archives reveal relatively complex minutes and procedures, and efforts by LDS Church headquarters to assist with the legal formalities by producing preprinted articles of incorporations for use by wards and stakes. See, e.g., By-Laws of the Corporation of the Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, residing in the Panguitch second ecclesiastical Ward of the Panguitch Stake of Zion, Church History Library, Salt Lake City, Utah (a preprinted set of by-laws for ward corporation).\n\n163 In 2019, the Corporation of the President was merged into the Corporation of the Presiding Bishop, which has been renamed The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. See Human Resources Department, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, “Further Changes to Emphasize the Correct Name of the Church of Jesus Christ,” June 19, 2019 (e-mail in the author's possession). Thus, for the first time since 1862, there is a legal entity bearing that name. However, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a legal matter remains a corporation sole, meaning that as of 2019 it has but a single member, church president Russell M. Nelson who became the incumbent of the corporations after the merger. This odd structure is a legacy of Mormonism's effort to find a legal structure less infected with Reform ecclesiology than that which was on offer in the legal world in which it was born."
