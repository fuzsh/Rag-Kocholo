        "text": "Entrepreneurial Leaders Are the Future\n\nSeventy percent of Babson graduate school alumni see themselves as entrepreneurs and 46% of those who see themselves as entrepreneurs have never owned or operated a business. That’s because entrepreneurial leaders do more than just start businesses. They lead change from within large organizations. They make communities around the world better by tackling global social issues. They see problems as opportunities, and they know how to take action to solve them.\n\nThe world is in constant social, civic, and economic flux. And, Babson’s approach to entrepreneurial leadership and hands-on entrepreneurship degrees is more essential than ever. Because where others see pure chaos, entrepreneurial leaders see creative potential. Regardless of your professional goals, the mindset you develop in Babson’s graduate programs will shape the way we all work tomorrow.\n\nThere’s No Place Like Babson\n\nMany stateside graduate schools center their curriculum on traditional business pursuits. But, at Babson, home to the top-rated MBA in entrepreneurship, “business as usual” has no business here. Join a group of global and diverse leaders united in the belief that through entrepreneurial leadership, we can change the world, and the way it works.\n\n2,668 graduate students\n\n25 student organizations\n\n50+ countries represented by the student body\n\n100% faculty taught courses\n\n44,000+ alumni across 128 countries\n\nTop-Ranked Programs to Take Your Career to the Next Level\n\nTake the same courses from the same top-ranked faculty, no matter when or where you choose to study. Babson’s full-time and part-time programs both offer the same high-caliber degrees with formats designed to fit your lifestyle and goals. Find the program that’s best for you.\n\nWhere Ambition Becomes Action\n\nLearning at Babson extends far beyond the classroom. That’s because at Babson, we know experience is the best teacher. You’ll use the skills and knowledge you gain in the classroom to develop theories of your own and put them to the test.\n\nFrom consulting for real companies, such as Fidelity or Puma, or pitching your business idea to investors for the chance to win $20,000 as part of the annual B.E.T.A. Challenge, you have opportunities to get real-world experience, allowing you to graduate with not only a degree, but a loaded resume and an expanded network of top entrepreneurs from around the world.\n\nConnections in Every Corner of the World\n\nWhen you complete a business graduate program at Babson, you join a group of peers whose stories might be different, but whose goals—and the drive to make them a reality—resemble your own. Learning from individuals with unique backgrounds and perspectives inspire new ways of working and making an impact locally and globally.\n\nPlus, you don’t have to wait until graduation to tap into the network of more than 44,000 entrepreneurial leaders. Babson graduates are breaking down economic and social barriers across 128 countries and serve as valuable connections to you throughout your time at Babson and beyond.\n\nJoin a Top Organization—Or Start Your Own\n\nWhile 75% of respondents’ first career activity was working in a corporate setting, or for someone other than themselves, that percentage shifts as Babson alumni move forward in their careers. Many alumni eventually start new ventures, shift to franchise ownership, and launch non-profit organizations later in their careers.\n\nHere are just some of the businesses alumni founded, as well as ones graduates work for after graduation."
