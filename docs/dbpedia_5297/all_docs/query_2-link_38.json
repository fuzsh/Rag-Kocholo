        "text": "Think New Mexico is beyond excited to welcome Katie Gutierrez to the staff as our first Tax, Budget & Economic Development Reform Director!\n\nKatie is from San Antonito, New Mexico, where her family has been farming for generations. A PhD candidate in Economics at the University of New Mexico, she studies the impact of taxes and policy changes on people’s health and wellbeing, with a focus on social justice and reducing health disparities. Katie is a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy Research Scholar alumna, a UNM Center for Social Policy alumna, and a former organizer with the United Graduate workers of UNM. She most recently was a Visiting Professor of Economics at Williams College. ... See MoreSee Less\n\nWe are delighted to welcome our final summer 2024 Leadership Intern, Ayvret van Waveren!\n\nAyvret was born in Santa Fe, NM and has always considered it home. Growing up, he spent 10 years in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and 8 years in Muscat, Oman. He graduated from The American International School of Muscat, where he earned the Political Science Student of the Year Award. Ayvret is now a rising senior at Amherst College, studying Political Science with a concentration in Economics. He is currently writing his thesis, \"New Mexico at a Crossroads,\" which analyzes major issues affecting the state, including the struggling economy, high violent crime rate, and underperforming schools, and explores potential policy solutions to address those issues. Ayvret previously interned at the First Judicial District Attorney's Office in Santa Fe and with New Mexico Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth. After earning his undergraduate degree, Ayvret intends to go to law school and then pursue a career in law and New Mexico politics and policy. ...

Legislators made it clear that they expected semester-long stand-alone courses, she advised, and the state board did not have authority to deviate from that directive.\n\n...\n\n“Integrated means lost, and that is the key,” Scheinman said. “If you integrate the topic as a part of other classes, the teacher has no real incentive to be familiar with the material and it won’t matter too much. A student can still get an 80%, based on their knowledge of other things.”\n\nScheinman framed the issue in economic terms. District can spend the money now to help students learn about how to manage their finances or students can pay the price later, when that lack of knowledge comes back to hurt them, he said.\n\nSome students, too, have backed the concept. Newport High School student Andrea Merino Comejo told lawmakers this year that taking a financial literacy class gave her a practical leg up. She said she learned “how to manage my money, how to build credit with a card [and] it has trained me how to buy a car from a private party. I can already see how it is getting me ready for my future finance decisions as an adult.”\n\n...
