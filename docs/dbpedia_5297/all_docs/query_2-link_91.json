        "text": "When you study abroad, you participate in an immersive and intensive learning experience. At a classroom in Oxford, you might read about the impact of globalization on society and the workplace. But in Oman and UAE, you'll visit small- and medium-sized enterprises as well as multinational corporations. You'll study how the Islamic legal tradition shapes a trillion-dollar financial industry. You'll receive an introduction to Arabian Gulf societies while trying new foods and learning new customs. (And you'll even have time for the beach.)\n\nWhat if we told you this trip might just help you find an internship in Dubai? It’s happened before.\n\nWith the development of a robust non-renewable energy economy in the 1970s, the Arabian Gulf countries of Oman and UAE undertook substantial modernization programs. The city of Muscat, in Oman, enjoyed sustained growth while preserving its unique heritage of Ibadi Islam and traditional cultural practices. Dubai, in UAE, became a pillar of global capital and trade while emerging as a major tourist destination. Another UAE city, Abu Dhabi, is a commanding presence among the Emirates in both wealth and stature, thanks to its petroleum assets.\n\nEach of these cities offers you a different perspective on how global flows of culture and capital work to create, transform, or preserve contemporary Middle Eastern societies.\n\nA number of Miami graduates who went on this program in previous years have reported to us that when they later did interviews for jobs, law school, etc., this trip made their resumes stand out. Interviewers were impressed that these students had explored the world beyond the well-trod paths of Europe.\n\nOur itinerary is still being finalized; but based on previous trips, our program will likely include visits to\n\nbusinesses of various sizes: traditional souqs (markets), modern malls, luxury hotels, tech start-ups, Sohar Port and Free Trade Zone, Nakheel Properties (developer of the \"Palm\" and \"World\" Islands in Dubai), Oman Oil, Occidental Petroleum, and Total (a Fortune 500 Global petroleum company).\n\nsustainability institutions:Masdar City (the global capital of renewable energy research) and MEDRC Water Research (a UN initiative investigating solutions to water scarcity).\n\nconventional and Islamic banks: Bank Muscat and Emirates Islamic Bank\n\ngovernment offices and embassies: the U.S. Embassy in Oman, Dubai's office for Foreign Direct Investment, and Omran (the tourism and investment fund of Oman).\n\na major journalism outlet: Al-Arabiyya News.\n\nreligious sites:Shaykh Zayed Grand Mosque (UAE), Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque (Oman), and Al Amana Centre (the oldest Protestant mission in Oman).\n\nIn addition, you'll have opportunities to ride camels and bash dunes, camp overnight in the desert with experienced Bedouin guides, and hike and swim through the streams and caves of Wadi Shab.\n\nGiven the nature of the region, totals vary from year-to-year. For 2023, the program fee is $5900. The program fee covers housing, ground transportation, program activities, most meals, and air travel to and from the United States. The program fee does include additional air travel within the US, such as your travel to the US airport from which the group will depart together for the Middle East.\n\nStandard Miami rates for in-state and out-of-state tuition apply for the winter term.\n\nIn addition to an experience that will change your view of the Middle East and the world? You'll receive 6 credit hours of Global Miami Plan credit (fulfilling the requirement which would otherwise take 9 credit hours on Miami’s campuses), and 6 credit hours of 300-level religion coursework.\n\nWe also recommend working with your advisors within your major to discuss the possibility of credit toward your major. We are prepared to speak with your advisors about how to facilitate this option.\n\nDid we already mention this? Students who did this trip in previous years later found, when applying for jobs or graduate programs, that their having studied abroad in the Middle East, rather than Europe, helped them stand out from other candidates."
