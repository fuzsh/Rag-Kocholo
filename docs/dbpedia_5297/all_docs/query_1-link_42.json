        "text": "Harvard Divinity School awarded 149 degrees during the 2023 Commencement Diploma Awarding Ceremony on May 25, 2023. The student speaker was MTS candidate Breana Norris.\n\nThis event took place on May 25, 2023.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nSPEAKER 1: Harvard Divinity School.\n\nSPEAKER 2: Diploma Awarding Ceremony Harvard Divinity School, May 25, 2023.\n\n[BAGPIPES PLAYING]\n\n[CHEERING]\n\n[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]\n\n[CHEERING, APPLAUSE, WHISTLING]\n\nDAVID HEMPTON: You may be seated. [CHUCKLES]\n\nI just want to take a moment to say how wonderful it is to hear the bagpipes played really well.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]\n\nLittle known fact, I grew up in a family of bagpipers, so that noise is very familiar, sometimes to familiar. So, dear graduates, faculty, families, guests, staff, friends, welcome to the campus green. How wonderful to have you all here with us for this Harvard Divinity School Diploma Awarding Ceremony.\n\nI'd just to take a moment to say thank you to parents, families, and friends on behalf of our students for your crucial support throughout our graduate studies here. We celebrate with you today as well. And ask our graduates, if you would please to rise up, and to express your thanks. Turn around and express your thanks to your parents and families and friends. Thank you.\n\n[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]\n\nSo I'm delighted to announce that the student speaker this year, selected by competition, is Breana Norris, who is receiving her MTS from HDS today. Breana--\n\nAUDIENCE: Let's go!\n\nDAVID HEMPTON: --over to you.\n\n[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]\n\n[INAUDIBLE]\n\nCongratulations.\n\nBREANA NORRIS: Thank you. Good afternoon.\n\nAUDIENCE: That's my roommate!\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nBREANA NORRIS: I am. Good afternoon, everyone.\n\nAUDIENCE: Good afternoon.\n\nBREANA NORRIS: Good afternoon. You guys look good.\n\n[CHATTER]\n\nAUDIENCE: You, too.\n\nBREANA NORRIS: Thank you. Seeking words for this momentous occasion has been a daunting task. There have been many iterations of this address over the centuries. Words to mark every tangle of history our university has seen.\n\nFortunately, I come from a legacy that is equally persistent. Like our university, my family's history in this nation goes back to the beginning. From rural Alabama and Texas, to Los Angeles, the city I call home, the Norris' and the Heflins--\n\n[CHEERING]\n\n--the Parkers and the Smiths have endured. Standing at the unlikely intersection of these parallel histories, I sought words for this moment, a means of tethering ourselves to this time. It was then I remembered my grandmother, who knows exactly what it feels like to fumble for a foothold in time.\n\nMy grandmother has dementia. She knows vividly what we can all feel at times, bombarded by moments, caught up in the spins of news cycles, our attention fragmented, struggling to make sense of the world around us. Today, I invite us all to follow her example.\n\nFor whenever she's overwhelmed or lost and confused, we can always bring her back to us with love. Our love for her grounds her in any moment, at any place in time, regardless of the chaos of the world around or within. Love grounds us. Love surpasses understanding.\n\nThe late Bell Hooks reminds us that if you lead with love, you cannot go wrong. In life and in her scholarship, she brought emotion and heart into the clinical halls of the academy. And I'll seek to follow her example today as well.\n\nHere, on this joyous day of celebration with our loved ones, I can think of no more fitting a message for the occasion. If you all will indulge me, I have a story to share about how I found this principle of love best embodied in a friend I made here at HDS. I arrived here in September of 2020, the heart of the pandemic.\n\nIt was the time of weekly COVID tests in Northwest labs and eking out connections in the private messages of Zoom. It was a time when I was forced to ask, what is Harvard? Prestige with no people, immense buildings, crumbling cemeteries, the lengthy syllabi of my classes, a Cambridge without community could not be Harvard.\n\nThe following year, a new era of in personhood was ushered in. And the community we built together breathed life into this city and the Harvard experience. What each and every one of you did during this time, how we reached for each other, the conversations in commons, the knitting clubs, the kayaking trips, it was in this sea of newness that I met Vandan and began a friendship that would changed my life.\n\nAUDIENCE: Aw!\n\nBREANA NORRIS: Vandan was a visiting Hindu monastic student here on exchange from India for one year as part of a new program at HDS. We had a morning class together. And he quickly discovered I was always hungry, stomach audibly growling because I skipped breakfast to arrive on time.\n\nOver our year together, we bonded over many similarities, like struggling to feel comfortable in our own skin. Vandan wore his sadhak, the robes of a person in training to become a monk. In one conversation, he said everyone back home had dressed like him, so he didn't feel his difference until he got here.\n\nMissing my own colorful city and family back home, I shared with him how my very skin could make me feel out of place in classrooms and on campus. In addition to our similarities, we had a fair share of differences that cannot be overstated. Vandan was strictly vegetarian. I'm an omnivore with no food allergies.\n\n[CHUCKLING]\n\nKayaking on the Charles is my favorite activity. And I only learned he couldn't swim after we were in the boat together.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nI'm Christian, he was Hindu. I was his first Black friend. He was my first monastic one. At the end of our year together, like we are all here to do today, we bid farewell. But this goodbye was different.\n\nTo ascend in his tradition, Vandan would enter a period of renunciation, taking vows that meant cutting off contact with the outside world, his family, and his new American friend. Only in his 20s, Vandan knew exactly what the rest of his life would look on. On this point, we could not have been more different.\n\nI want to read a selection from the card that he wrote me to say goodbye. \"Thanks so much for everything, for a warm and welcoming attitude that made me feel at home and made my Harvard time worthwhile. I'm so very grateful and thankful for your friendship, and you'll be missed.\n\nBreana, keep me in your prayers as I seek to pursue an ambitious path of monasticism and renunciation. I'll pray for you. Take care, my dear friend. Good memories are a pleasant way to keep the person alive and with you. Thanks for those. Farewell, Breana.\"\n\nOur friendship is the most unique one I've had at HDS and in life. I believe it could only have happened at a place like Harvard Divinity School, at this moment in its history, a moment of open doors and people with open hearts. The lesson I learned from Vandan is love, a love that goes beyond a shared worldview or corner of the world, love beyond networking, love beyond self-centered interest.\n\nPeople here at Harvard, maybe subconsciously, are taught to constantly network, to expect great things from the great people we meet and befriend, maybe even to anticipate how they can benefit us later. Amongst our university's esteemed future doctors and lawyers, politicians and business people, educators, engineers, and dentists, we, at the Divinity School, are often saddled with a discomfort in the ambiguity of our degree. Sometimes stumped when people ask, what's next?\n\nGrounded in love, I find that these questions change. Not what will you do after here, but how will you do it? Not what will you do after here, but why? Not what, but with whom by your side?\n\nOnce I knew our separation was coming, I tried to just enjoy getting to know Vandan, to cherish each and every memory we made in this moment where we left our vastly different corners of the world to share this Cambridge zip code for four seasons. Though I may never see him again in this life, I know that this is not the end for the bonds of our experiences will live on, just as our love will live on. Just as my love will live on for my grandmother, even when she no longer recognizes my face.\n\nLove grounds us. Love surpasses understanding. On this joyous day, surrounded by your loved ones, I hope and pray this is the love that will propel you forward, through your certainties and your uncertainties for the rest of our lives. I may not know all of you. We may not see eye to eye.\n\nYou might have a lunch reservation you're actively waiting for, I'm almost done. But I can still love you. It is custom on occasions like this to take a text. This one is not from my tradition but Vandan's. He inscribed it on the back of the card.\n\n\"In the joy of others lies our own.\" So whether today is goodbye or just goodbye for now, I pray that you go forward grounded in love and share your joy with others. Congratulations Class of 2023.\n\n[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]\n\nKATIE CAPONERA: Thank you, Breana, for your moving words. I'd like us all to take a moment now to remember a classmate, who should be graduating today with us-- with you all. Judith Giller Leinwohl, who died this past August. Judith was a treasured friend and a shining light to so many in this class and in classes before her.\n\nAnd as such, as she should be graduating today, we have a seat reserved for her amongst our graduates. I'd like us to all take a moment of silence to hold Judith in our minds and in our hearts. May her memory be a blessing.\n\nDAVID HEMPTON: This morning in Tercentenary Theater, 149 degrees were conferred on the Graduating Class of 2023 of the Divinity School, as well as 11 degrees for Graduates of the Committee on the Study of Religion through the Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. The conferral is inclusive of degrees earned in November, March, and May. And the Divinity School degrees were comprised of the following-- 19 Masters of Theological Studies, 49 Masters of Divinity, 7 Masters of Religion and Public Life, 1 Master of Theology, and 2 Doctors of Theology.\n\nSo, today, we have the opportunity, in a more intimate setting, to celebrate these degrees and the individual attainments that they represent. Each graduate will be presented by associate Dean for Enrollment and Student Services, Tim Whelsky. And as each person comes forward to receive their degree, if the graduate has indicated a desire for us to do so, a brief statement about their plans will be read by Katie Caponera, our Director of Student Life. So we will award diplomas by degree beginning now with the MTS candidates.\n\n[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]\n\nTIMOTHY WHELSKY: Thank you, all. So as the Dean mentioned, we have a tradition here of reading the personal statements from each graduate if they've chosen to provide one. So as Katie and I read them, we invite you to hoot and holler and clap as loud as you'd like. But just for the flow, it's probably going to be a little better if you wait for me to read the name and for Katie to read the statement, and then you can go at it.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nSo now I'd like to present the Graduates for the Degree of Master of Theological Studies. Please stand.\n\n[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]\n\n[SERENE MUSIC]\n\nIshani Agarwal.\n\nKATIE CAPONERA: Ishani studied religion, literature, and culture at the intersection of medieval religion and art history.
