        "text": "The University of Akron School of Law welcomed 131 members of the 2023 J.D. entering class during Orientation Week, Aug. 15-18, and at a well-attended early-evening welcome reception for the students and their families on Sept. 8.\n\nThe centerpiece of the event was the administration of the Oath of Professionalism by J. Philip Calabrese, United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. In his brief remarks, Judge Calabrese said that he was not aware of any other law school that holds an event such as this, and that was indicative of the special place that is The University of Akron School of Law.\n\nThe incoming class of 2023 includes 127 first-year J.D. students and four two-year international J.D. students. Of these, the 83 starting in the fall joined 41 who started in January and seven who started in May. Five of the incoming J.D. students came via the 3+3 program, through which they will earn both a bachelor’s and J.D. degree in six years. The class also includes one L.L.M. student and six pursuing a Master of Studies in Law.\n\nThe 131 students range in age from 20 to 52 with an average age is 27. The class is almost equally split between men and women. Twenty-one are from outside Ohio—from the states of California, Florida, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, D.C. and West Virginia and the nations of Jamaica, Zimbabwe, Ghana and Oman. They attended 60 different undergraduate colleges. The vast majority are the first in their families to attend law school.\n\nAmong the class are mothers and fathers, business owners, animal shelter volunteers and an Eagle Scout. There are Division 1, 2 and 3 college athletes, including swimmers, football, baseball and basketball players, an equestrian, a volleyball player, track and field stars and golfers! Several have served or are currently serving in the military or National Guard. Career backgrounds teachers, engineers, police officers, paralegals, college professors, coaches, food service and factory workers, swim coaches, bailiffs, patient coordinators, retail sales associates and creative writers. Many are the first in their families to graduate from high school and college and a vast majority are the first in their families to attend law school."
