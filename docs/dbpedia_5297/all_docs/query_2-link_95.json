It seems to me Larkspur as an organization and mission strives for many of the same things we strive for in palliative care; personalized care that is focused on one’s individual goals and values. Like palliative care, Larkspur promotes a true celebration of life in a way that is truly unique. As a culture, we are all very good at celebrating birth, the inception of life, but unfortunately, as a whole, we tend not to be as comfortable ushering in death and being intentional on what we want at the end of our lives. I believe that organizations like Larkspur can help move the needle.”\n\nAmanda Rosenberger (Director)\n\nAmanda is an Aquatic Ecologist and Conservation Biologist. Her research interests are in the ecology and conservation of freshwater biota, including fish, mussels, and crayfish, with an emphasis on the role of ecological processes in shaping organisms’ distributions, population characteristics, and community structure.

It all began in the winter of 1985, when he opened the doors of his parish to individuals seeking sanctuary in the church parking lot. This simple act of kindness marked the beginning of Room In The Inn. In December 1986, four congregations committed to sheltering people experiencing homeless through March 1987. By the end of that winter, 31 congregations had joined. Now, Room In The Inn has nearly 200 congregations from a wide variety of traditions and over 7,000 volunteers who shelter almost 1,500 men and women from November 1 through March 31 each season."
