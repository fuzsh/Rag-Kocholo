Although his career was in financial services, Kirkland has kept an abiding interest in energy policy ever since studying for his MPP at HKS in 2003. Concerned about climate change and at the inadequacy of the US policy response, Kirkland intends to focus on the role of federally funded energy research as a tool to abate GHG emissions.
