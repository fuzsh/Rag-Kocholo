        "text": "Impact of Faculty Research on Policy, Practice and Media\n\nFall 2022\n\nOur accounting faculty are devoted to providing TCU students an outstanding education. We also strive to make two contributions with our research. First, we advance the body of knowledge in accounting and related areas by publishing our work in top academic journals. The best-known ranking of accounting departments’ research ranks us at the 90th percentile among departments across the globe that likewise engage in scholarly research. In the same ranking of nearly 700 universities, we rank 100 places higher than the average rank of accounting departments at universities identified as peers by TCU’s leadership.\n\nBeyond publishing in top academic journals, we also aim to impact and inform the practice and teaching of accounting and business with our research. Following, we:\n\nProvide examples of how our faculty have impacted business policy or practice\n\nNote cases in which the media have shown interest in our work\n\nDescribe how we have contributed to accounting education beyond TCU’s campus by writing textbooks.\n\nWe also provide examples of some of our accounting faculty's current projects.\n\nResearch Projects\n\nAnne Albrecht\n\nPaper Title: Do Auditors Recognize the Dark Side of Executives’ Accounting Competence?\n\nJournal: The Accounting Review\n\nDate Published: January 2018\n\nAuthors: Anne Albrecht (TCU), Elaine Mauldin and Nathan J. Newton\n\nRelevant to: Media\n\nHow relevant: This paper has been extensively cited by the media, including The Wall Street Journal, CFO Journal, Accounting Today, CPA Practice Advisor and other outlets.\n\nCurrent Project or Working Paper: Auditors’ Going-Concern Opinions when GAAP Losses do not Capture Core Earnings\n\nAuthors: Anne Albrecht (TCU), Jeff Chen (TCU) and Karen Nelson (TCU)\n\nBrief summary: Research has focused on auditors’ assessments of going-concern using GAAP financial distress signals. Yet, the increasing prevalence of alternative earnings measures (e.g., pro forma earnings) suggests that GAAP earnings may not capture core earnings. This paper examines firms with GAAP losses but core earnings profits (i.e., “switches”). Results show that switches are informative of future loss reversals and that auditors effectively incorporate this information into their going concern assessments, as evidenced by a lower likelihood of auditor going concern opinions for switch firms. This paper was presented to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), indicating that it is already informing policy.\n\nJeff Chen\n\nCurrent Project or Working Paper: Information Transparency and Investment in Follow-on Innovation\n\nAuthors: J. Chen (TCU), Y. Kim, L. Yang and J. Zhang\n\nBrief Summary: In this study, we focus on the perspective of firms that make investments in follow-on innovation, showing that transparency on the part of cited firms reduces uncertainty and helps citing firms make more informed decisions. From the cited firms’ point of view, however, knowledge spillovers to rivals may deteriorate their competitive position. Firms that own predecessor knowledge may thus have an incentive to be opaque. Although these tactical disclosure decisions are beyond the scope of our investigation, proprietary costs of disclosures suggest that information transparency may not be achievable without strong pro-transparency public policies. It is debatable, however, whether information transparency facilitates or hampers economic growth if a pro-transparency public policy decreases overall innovative activity in the society despite its positive effect on knowledge spillover.\n\nShana Clor-Proell\n\nPaper Title: Response by the Financial Reporting Policy Committee of the Financial Accounting and Reporting Section of the American Accounting Association to the FASB Invitation to Comment on Identifiable Intangible Assets and Subsequent Accounting for Goodwill\n\nJournal: Accounting Horizons\n\nDate Published: 2022\n\nAuthors: Clor-Proell, S.M.

The blog post is available here.\n\nKai Gu\n\nCurrent Project or Working Paper: Accounting Conservatism and Debt Contracting: The Roles of Liquidation Value and Information Search\n\nAuthors: Kai Gu (TCU)\n\nBrief summary: This paper examines the role of accounting conservatism in debt contracting by focusing on liquidation value and information search. I identify situations where 1) accounting conservatism will increase or decrease the cost of debt, and 2) conservative accounting, as opposed to aggressive accounting, will be socially optimal. I also examine whether an interim accounting report will enhance or impair social welfare and find that the degree of accounting conservatism is better endogenously chosen than exogenously set. Such finding speaks to whether standard setters should view conservatism as a useful quality of accounting information.\n\nIn-Mu Haw\n\nPaper Title: Market Consequences of Earnings Management in Response to Security Regulations in China\n\nJournal: Contemporary Accounting Research\n\nDate Published: Spring 2005\n\nAuthors: In-Mu Haw (TCU), Daqing Qi, Donghui Wu and Woody Wu\n\nRelevant to: Policy\n\nHow relevant: This paper was presented at the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC, which is equivalent to US SEC) and the implications of the findings were discussed with the senior regulators at CSRC.\n\nPaper Title: Ultimate Ownership, Income Management, and Legal and Extra-Legal Institutions\n\nJournal: Journal of Accounting Research\n\nDate Published: May 2004\n\nAuthors: In-Mu Haw (TCU), Bingbing Hu, Lee-Seok Hwang and Woody Wu\n\nRelevant to: Policy\n\nHow relevant: This paper was presented at the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC, which is equivalent to US SEC) and the implications of the finding were discussed with the senior regulators at CSRC.\n\nPaper Title: Audit Qualification and Timing of Earnings Announcements: Evidence from China\n\nJournal: Auditing: A Journal of Practice and Theory\n\nDate Published: September 2003\n\nAuthors: In-Mu Haw (TCU), Kyungjoo Park, Daqing Qi and Woody Wu\n\nRelevant to: Policy\n\nHow relevant: This paper was presented at the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC, which is equivalent to US SEC) and the implications of the finding were discussed with the senior regulators at CSRC.\n\nPatrick Hopkins\n\nCurrent Project or Working Paper: Tax Indemnification and Unrecognized Tax Benefits in Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nAuthors: Patrick Hopkins (TCU)\n\nBrief summary: Tax indemnification transfers the risk of potential tax settlements from a taxpayer to an external party. Current accounting standards require firms to reflect unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) even when the underlying tax position is indemnified. In light of this standard, practitioners suggest that financial statement disclosures regarding tax indemnification are necessary to allow users to assess tax risk adequately. However, this paper documents that acquirers rarely disclose tax indemnification arrangements obtained from merger and acquisition (M&A) contracts. Furthermore, evidence suggests that tax indemnification significantly moderates the positive association between UTBs and future tax cash outflows. On average, investors do not consider this moderation when valuing UTBs, except when acquirers disclose M&A-related UTBs. Because of the expanding use of tax indemnification outside of the M&A setting, the findings suggest that changes to accounting practices may be necessary to allow financial statement users to adequately assess various income tax accounts when tax indemnification is present.\n\nSteve Lim\n\nPaper Title: The Information Content of Disaggregated Accounting Profitability: Operating Activities Versus Financing Activities\n\nJournal: Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting\n\nDate Published: 2014\n\nAuthors: Steve Lim (TCU)\n\nRelevant to: Policy\n\nHow relevant: FASB project manager contacted Professor Lim regarding this paper and indicated that the paper would be used in FASB’s Financial Statement Presentation project.\n\nPaper Title: Intangible Capital and Capital Structure\n\nJournal: Journal of Banking & Finance\n\nDate Published: 2020\n\nAuthors: Steve Lim (TCU), Antonio Macias and Thomas Moeller (TCU)\n\nRelevant to: Practice\n\nHow relevant: Editor of a leading applied finance journal contacted the authors regarding preparing a version of the paper for his journal, describing the paper as “clearly relevant to business practitioners.”\n\nStephen Lusch\n\nPaper Title: Are Declining Effective Tax Rates Indicative of Tax Avoidance: Insight from Effective Tax Rate Reconciliations\n\nJournal: Journal of Accounting and Economics\n\nDate Published: 2020\n\nAuthors: Katharine Drake, Russ Hamilton and Stephen Lusch (TCU)\n\nRelevant to: Media\n\nHow relevant: Numerous media stories focus on low corporate tax rates and/or declining corporate tax rates.

Paper reports evidence consistent with a decline in earnings management via the tax accounts after the disclosure of a tax-related CAM by the company's auditor. The paper has been cited by the PCAOB in their white paper on critical audit matters; thus, it is already informing policy.\n\nKaren Nelson\n\nPaper Title: The Relation Between Auditors Fees for Non-Audit Services and Earnings Management\n\nJournal: The Accounting Review\n\nDate Published: 2002\n\nAuthors: Marilyn Johnson, Ron Kasznik and Karen Nelson (TCU)\n\nRelevant to: Policy, Practice, Media\n\nHow relevant: This paper was covered extensively in the financial press, including The Wall Street Journal, Business Week, and MIT Sloan Management Review, among other outlets.

We find a dramatic increase in the disclosure of both qualitative and quantitative infographics in 10-K filings over time and substantial cross-sectional variation in firms’ choices regarding picture types, data content, and the placement of infographics within 10-Ks. We provide evidence on factors determining firms’ use of infographics, and explore the persistence with which they are disclosed over time. Finally, we investigate capital market outcomes associated with the use of infographics. Overall, we find that infographics have become a key element of corporate financial disclosure.\n\nElizabeth Plummer\n\nPaper Title: Trends of Prescription Drug Manufacturer Rebates in Commercial Health Insurance Plans, 2015-2019.\n\nJournal: JAMA Health Forum\n\nDate Published: May 2022\n\nAuthors: Plummer, E.

Both pre-federal mandate and post-federal mandate, nurse aide and nursing staff shortages were more prevalent for nursing homes in states without vaccination mandates (28%-30% of nursing homes report shortages) than states with vaccination mandates (17%-19% of nursing homes report shortages). Shortages changed little for either group after the federal mandate. Over this same period, staff vaccination rates for nursing homes in mandate states were relatively unchanged (94%-95%), while rates for nursing homes in non-mandate states increased from 81% to 85.6%. In non-mandate states, staffing shortages were lower for nursing homes with higher staff vaccination rates, while in mandate states, there was no association between staffing shortages and vaccination rates. For both groups, staffing shortages were more likely for nursing homes located in rural, white, and less affluent communities.\n\nWinnie Wen\n\nCurrent Project or Working Paper: The Role of Audit Risk Disclosure in Financial Reporting Precision and the Quality of Audited Financial Reports\n\nAuthors: M. Deng and W. Weng (TCU)\n\nBrief summary: Regulators in various jurisdictions have adopted new standards that require auditors to disclose audit risks of material misstatements in audit reports. As of June 1, 2017, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) requires auditors to communicate in the auditor’s report any critical audit matters (CAMs) that are meaningful to investors and other financial statement users if the CAMS required especially challenging, subjective, or complex auditor judgment. Our study finds that audit risk disclosure requirements may discourage some companies from improving financial reporting precision. As such, we find an unintended consequence of the recent audit regulation.\n\nTextbooks\n\nShana Clor-Proell\n\nPhillips, F., S.M. Clor-Proell, R. Libby, and P. Libby. 2021.
