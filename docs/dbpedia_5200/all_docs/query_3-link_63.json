        "text": "Air quality can play a significant role in your health and wellbeing, but those effects aren’t just limited to your lungs. The air that you breathe as well as the air around you can also affect the health and appearance of your skin, not to mention other factors like stress and sleep. The healthier your skin, the better it will look and age.\n\nWe know that it’s a fairly simple task to control the air quality in your home or business with a modern HEPA air purifier, but what about the air outside?\n\nHow We Ranked Each State for Skin Friendliness\n\nAir quality: The skin is a living, breathing organ—drawing in moisture, vitamins, and toxins in the air. That’s why we weighted air quality highest for our best states to age in ranking (60 percent). States with the worst air quality ranked poorly for helping people look younger longer because it harms the body both inside and out.\n\nStress: The phrase, “you’re giving me gray hairs” exists for a reason. Stress ages you by exhausting the mind and body, as well as opening the door for microorganisms to attack, by weakening your immune system. The calmer and more relaxed you are, the better you’ll look and feel; you won’t have the dark circles, stress breakouts, and frown lines of a chronically stressed out person. We weighted stress levels by 20 percent in this study to account for this major aging contributor.\n\nSleep: We’ve all heard the term, “beauty sleep.” That’s because cells regenerate while we sleep and help us look and feel better. Sleeping not only helps cognitive function, but the health of your dermis too. We weighted sleep 15 percent in this piece to account for its importance in maintaining your health and a youthful appearance.\n\nHumidity: Water has been called “the elixir of life.” Many beauty experts tout the power of staying hydrated. Thus, states with more humidity were ranked higher for their anti-aging powers. This was the least consequential of our ranking data, weighted just five percent. It also helps to drink a lot of water.\n\nMap of Best and Worst States for Youthful Skin\n\nEvery state offers a variety of pros and cons that can affect your skin. This can include natural factors like humidity or man-made hazards like air pollution. We collected data on those factors from every state and ranked them with a color scale:"
