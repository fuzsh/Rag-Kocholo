        "meta_description": "Abstract Extreme wet-bulb temperatures (Tw) are often used as indicators of heat stress. However, humid heat extremes are fundamentally compound events, and a given Tw can be generated by various combinations of temperature and humidity. Differentiating between extreme humid heat driven by temperature versus humidity is essential to identifying these extremes’ physical drivers and preparing for their distinct impacts. Here we explore the variety of combinations of temperature and humidity contributing to humid heat experienced across the globe. In addition to using traditional metrics, we derive a novel thermodynamic state variable named “stickiness.” Analogous to the oceanographic variable “spice” (which quantifies the relative contributions of temperature and salinity to a given water density), stickiness quantifies the relative contributions of temperature and specific humidity to a given Tw. Consistent across metrics, we find that high magnitudes of Tw tend to occur in the presence of anomalously high moisture, with temperature anomalies of secondary importance. This widespread humidity dependence is consistent with the nonlinear relationship between temperature and specific humidity as prescribed by the Clausius–Clapeyron relationship. Nonetheless, there is a range of stickiness observed at moderate-to-high Tw thresholds. Stickiness allows a more objective evaluation of spatial and temporal variability in the temperature versus humidity dependence of humid heat than traditional variables. In regions with high temporal variability in stickiness, predictive skill for humid heat-related impacts may improve by considering fluctuations in atmospheric humidity in addition to dry-bulb temperature. Significance Statement Extreme humid heat increases the risk of heat stress through its influence over humans’ ability to cool down by sweating. Understanding whether humid heat extremes are generated more due to elevated temperature or humidity is important for identifying factors that may increase local risk, preparing for associated impacts, and developing targeted adaptation measures. Here we explore combinations of temperature and humidity across the globe using traditional metrics and by deriving a new variable called “stickiness.” We find that extreme humid heat at dangerous thresholds occurs primarily due to elevated humidity, but that stickiness allows for thorough analysis of the drivers of humid heat at lower thresholds, including identification of regions prone to low- or high-stickiness extremes.",

        "text": "a. Exploration of temperature and humidity combinations through traditional variables\n\nOur four case study regions experience varying intensities of humid heat and distinct mechanisms which bring about local humid heat extremes. First, these regions exhibit contrasting distributions in temperature, humidity, and Tw (Fig. 2). Each of the four regions has a unimodal temperature distribution. This is also true for Tw, specific humidity, and relative humidity in all regions except for the Persian Gulf, which has a bimodal distribution in these three variables. The areas surrounding the Persian Gulf are very dry throughout the Northern Hemisphere summer, but the advection of marine air through strong sea breezes and synoptic scale meteorological conditions increases local humidity and under certain conditions can drive Tw into dangerous thresholds (Ivanovich et al. 2022; Raymond et al. 2021; Pal and Eltahir 2016; Xue and Eltahir 2015). We note that removing the requirement that all stations in the Persian Gulf region exhibit a 99th-percentile Tw above 28°C increases the spread of these distributions in specific humidity, relative humidity, and Tw (not shown), but that the bimodal distributions is retained for all thresholds tested between 25° and 30°C. Further, this bimodality is consistent across the individual station locations selected for this region, and an example using a station in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, is plotted in Fig. S5 for reference.\n\nTo visualize the full record of daily-scale station data within each region, we plot the dry and wet-bulb temperature at the hour of recorded daily maximum Tw against a variety of co-occurring humidity metrics: specific humidity, relative humidity, and saturation deficit. We find that locally extreme dry-bulb temperatures can occur at a range of specific humidities, although consistently low relative humidities (Figs. 3a,c). In NW South Asia, elevated temperatures are associated with changes in specific humidity which in combination generate a relatively small range in Tw compared to the other three regions. This indicates a tendency for compensatory effects, whereby temperatures vary more than specific humidity and variations in specific humidity tend to partially offset those in temperature, possibly indicative of the simultaneous cooling and moistening effect of evaporation of soil moisture or surface water. In the U.S. Midwest, high temperatures are associated with high specific humidities, suggesting a larger potential for elevated temperature and specific humidity to co-occur, with both factors contributing to extreme Tw. The most extreme Tw days in SE Australia occur at moderately high temperatures (roughly 35°C) when the air is virtually saturated (Fig. S6). A bimodal distribution is again evident in the Persian Gulf, with the majority of days at high temperatures and high specific humidities, which contrasts with a smaller cluster of extreme temperature dry days. In all four regions, the highest recorded Tw are associated with the highest recorded specific humidity conditions (Fig. 3b). Further, the distribution of conditions in each region shows that increases from locally moderate to extreme Tw cross few temperature isotherms, suggesting that extreme humid heat conditions tend to be humidity dependent.\n\nWe also observe that the most extreme temperatures are associated with a small range of very low relative humidities in three of the regions. The relative humidities that occur with extreme Tw apparently differ more widely than those that occur with extreme temperatures. In the Persian Gulf, NW South Asia, and SE Australia, increasing temperatures are closely associated with decreasing relative humidities, hewing fairly closely to lines of constant Tw (Fig. 3c). At locally high Tw thresholds, the distributions in NW South Asia and SE Australia cross many temperature isotherms (Fig. 3d), indicating that extreme temperatures are not a necessary component to generating humid heat extremes in these regions. The associated relative humidities also vary substantially, though still within the upper half of the local distribution (Fig. 3d). The bimodal structures in the relationships between relative humidity and both temperature and Tw are again clear in the Persian Gulf, delineating between days that are hotter and drier versus cooler and moister. NW South Asia experiences most summer days in a high relative humidity environment, while the relative humidity and Tw conditions in the U.S. Midwest are lower and more consistent than the other three regions.\n\nWhile extreme Tw can exhibit a slightly larger range in saturation deficit than extreme dry-bulb temperatures, this difference is not as pronounced as for relative humidity. The highest recorded temperatures in each region are associated with the highest recorded saturation deficits (Fig. 3e). Further, changes in temperature are compensated by changes in saturation deficit which keep Tw at a roughly constant intensity. Extreme Tw in the Persian Gulf, SE Australia, and the U.S. Midwest are limited to those days very close to saturation (Fig. 3f). In NW South Asia, in contrast, extreme Tw span a range of saturation deficits and cross many dry-bulb temperature contours. The Tw in the U.S. Midwest and SE Australia tend to be lower with small ranges in saturation deficits, suggesting both that temperature and specific humidity tend to fluctuate jointly in these regions, and that an absence of very high temperatures may limit how large saturation deficits can be. In each panel of Fig. 3, the strong relationship between certain heat and humidity metrics is evident. Particularly, relative humidity and saturation deficit depend strongly on temperature, which is reflected in the same correlation sign between these variables in the four case study regions. Conversely, while retaining some dependence on temperature, Tw is much more sensitive to specific humidity than to the other two humidity variables, sharing a consistent increase with specific humidity that is not observed with relative humidity or saturation deficit.\n\nOverall, we conclude that while high dry-bulb temperatures can occur at a range of moisture levels, the occurrence of extreme humid heat is much more limited to a narrow range of anomalous humidity (most clearly when measured by specific humidity). However, there are a small fraction of days associated with highly elevated dry-bulb temperatures in the presence of moderate humidity that together causes extreme Tw. The various combinations of these standard variables, in multiple plots made from long-term station records in each region, allows us to draw these conclusions with some confidence and nuance. However, extending this analysis to a global scale by recreating these plots for all station locations would be intractable. The lack of a global benchmark for meaningfully comparing disparate temperature and humidity combinations adds another complication. We could thus hope for a more direct route to these conclusions, and especially one that allows us to compare the humidity or temperature dependence of humid heat in locations around the world more straightforwardly and objectively. Toward this end, we use the following section to explore the use of stickiness, whose derivation was outlined above.\n\nb. Stickiness derivation results and analysis\n\nAbove we derived a thermodynamic state variable, stickiness, which varies most with fluctuations in dry-bulb temperature and specific humidity and is least correlated with Tw. Our methods generate a consistent and globally applicable scale with which to compare the temperature versus specific humidity contributions toward a given intensity of Tw.\n\nWhile the derivation above constrains the units of stickiness to be degrees Celsius, the location of the intercept (0°C) is arbitrary and constructed here so that the mean value over all stations’ historical records is 0°C. With this choice, we also observe that a large fraction of conditions observed on Earth occur around 0°C (Fig. 4). The mean conditions in the four case study regions are also close to this zero value, while their 99th-percentile Tw conditions are all at positive stickiness. This supports the conclusion reached by previously published literature that extreme humid heat tends to be humidity dependent (e.g., Raymond et al. 2020; Lutsko 2021). This pattern is also supported by our physical understanding of the relationship between temperature and specific humidity. Due to the Clausius–Clapeyron relationship, higher dry-bulb temperatures are associated with the ability for air to experience exponentially higher specific humidity before reaching saturation. This allows the potential magnitude of local specific humidity variations to increase nonlinearly with temperature, suggesting that the contributions of humidity fluctuations to extreme humid heat may be greater than those of dry-bulb temperature fluctuations. Similarly, it implies certain seasonal and geographic patterns of stickiness as explored in later sections. As the climate continues to warm, higher latitudes will likely see greater variability in specific humidity along with that in temperature (Lutsko 2021) and occasional high-stickiness conditions may progress further poleward. Additionally, comparing the stickiness contours in Fig. 4 with the relative humidity and saturation deficit contours in Fig. 3, stickiness does not exhibit the same nonlinearities at extreme temperatures. Stickiness may thus be a useful diagnostic at very high and low temperatures.\n\nStickiness is a single variable that measures the spatial variability of global humid heat temperature versus humidity dependence. During the hour of recorded daily maximum Tw for all days in each station record, high stickiness is found commonly in coastal regions (Figs. 5a and 6a). Regions with monsoon climates also exhibit higher stickiness in rainy seasons than in dry seasons. For example, South Asia tends to experience higher stickiness during the June–August (JJA) season than the December–February (DJF) season. The lowest values of stickiness under both mean and extreme conditions are at high elevation, including the regions near the Andes Mountains, the Tibetan Plateau, and the Rocky Mountains. Summer patterns in stickiness for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres (when local Tw are more intense) are distinct. Namely, mean stickiness conditions in the Southern Hemisphere are not nearly as high as those in the Northern Hemisphere, consistent with the observation that there is higher mean specific humidity in the Northern Hemisphere compared to the Southern Hemisphere (Dai 2006). Further, high stickiness under mean Tw extends to much higher latitudes on the eastern coast of North America and Asia during JJA than do those in the Southern Hemisphere during DJF (Figs. 5a and 6a), but these stickiness values decrease rapidly toward the west into the interior of each continent. Additionally, a higher fraction of tropical Northern Hemisphere stations exhibit positive stickiness under mean conditions during DJF than do tropical Southern Hemisphere stations during JJA. The highest temporal standard deviation in stickiness tends to occur in semiarid coastal regions (Figs. S14a and S15a). These include southeastern Australia, South Africa, and the Sahel, each of which experiences large interannual climate variability including strong influences of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. Stickiness also exhibits high variability in extreme humid heat hotspots, where the mean values are also large.\n\nStickiness is higher during extreme Tw events than during mean conditions at most stations around the globe during the local summer season. In fact, many stations have never reached a locally extreme Tw under low-stickiness conditions, and this is particularly true in regions where the 99th-percentile Tw threshold is sufficiently high to impact human health, such as the Persian Gulf, South Asia, the Sahel, and the Amazon basin (Fig. S16). Around the globe, stickiness is constrained to positive values during high intensity humid heat days, while there is a larger range of stickiness during more moderate humid heat conditions (Fig. S17). At the same time, some regions do maintain their overall temperature dependence (low stickiness) even on locally extreme Tw days. These stations include those located in the western United States, the Sahara, Iran, and Chile and are primarily in continental-interior locations which have no pathway for advection of warm and humid air from a surrounding water body or region of high soil moisture. However, for a subset of near-coastal stations—for example, in Alaska and on the Scandinavian coast—the low stickiness may be a consequence of the cool sea surface temperatures offshore, and could change as those temperatures warm. While nearly all stations exhibit an increase in stickiness on extreme Tw days in the JJA season, there are some decreases in stickiness on extreme Tw days in the Northern Hemisphere during DJF, when Tw is relatively low. We note that there is not an equivalently large landmass below 40°S harboring cold, dry air (such as northern North America or Eurasia) that could compare for the Southern Hemisphere in JJA. Spatial patterns in the standard deviation of stickiness are similar for extreme Tw conditions as under mean conditions in both seasons, but the magnitude is generally lower during extreme events (Figs. S14b and S15b).\n\nThe patterns described above are not directly observable by plotting the global dry-bulb temperature, specific humidity, or relative humidity associated with mean and extreme humid heat events (Figs. 7 and 8). All stations show both higher specific humidity and dry-bulb temperature on extreme humid heat days than during average humid heat conditions, regardless of season. Some regions do exhibit decreases in local relative humidity on these extreme humid heat days, such as Alaska, northern Europe, and southeast China. However, these three locations all experience increases in stickiness during extreme humid heat days compared to mean conditions (Fig. S20). These extreme days associated with decreased relative humidity but increased stickiness may result from the disparity between the exponential increase in saturation vapor pressure and the linear increase in stickiness associated with elevated temperatures (Fig. 4). Such events could be caused by flow from the continents’ dry interior or strong transient high pressure systems that could increase local dry-bulb temperatures without concomitantly increasing moisture sufficiently to maintain relative humidity (Zscheischler and Seneviratne 2017). In contrast, during DJF seasonally high-humid heat events, regions such as the western United States, central Europe, Eurasia, and eastern China exhibit decreases in relative humidity while experiencing strong decreases in stickiness. The seasonal differences in the relationship between relative humidity and stickiness reflect the distinct seasonal climatologies in the Northern Hemisphere, as baseline dry-bulb temperatures are much higher in the summer than the winter.\n\nThe spatial patterns in the difference in stickiness during mean versus extreme humid heat days are most similar to those of specific humidity, with the largest differences in regions such as the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of California in JJA and the southeastern United States, the Sahel, and Australia in DJF (Figs. 7a and 8a). This similarity in spatial patterns between stickiness and specific humidity is again consistent with the Clausius–Clapeyron relationship. The nonlinear relationship between temperature and specific humidity suggests that at moderate-to-high temperatures, specific humidity fluctuations may be more critical than dry-bulb temperature fluctuations to the achievement of extreme Tw values. Spatial patterns in specific humidity changes have thus been shown to drive those of humid heat (Lutsko 2021), which is reflected in global stickiness patterns. The key difference in the spatial pattern of these two variables is that while all stations exhibit higher specific humidity during extreme Tw days than during average conditions, this is not the case for stickiness (particularly in high northern latitudes during boreal winter). The magnitude of specific humidity increases are comparable across much of each summer hemisphere, and can even increase with latitude in regions such as the United States in JJA and Australia in DJF, indicating the large intraseasonal variability at these latitudes.\n\nReturning to the four case study regions and exploring the temporal variations in the relationships between stickiness and humid heat further highlights the dependency of extreme Tw on anomalous specific humidity (high stickiness). In each region, the highest recorded Tw occur at the highest stickiness values, following along the saturation curve (Fig. 9). However, there is a large range in stickiness at locally defined moderate levels of humid heat, particularly in the Persian Gulf and NW South Asia. At a threshold of 27°C, these two regions experience a range of stickiness from about −1° to 5°C. The larger range in stickiness associated with moderately high Tw thresholds within these two individual regions is consistent with the increased spatial variability in global stickiness at moderately high Tw intensities (Fig. 10). We note that 4640 HadISD stations have experienced Tw thresholds between 25° and 26°C in their historical records, with a range of both negative and positive co-occurring stickiness conditions. In contrast, only 1982 stations have previously recorded Tw conditions between 29° and 30°C, and the co-occurring stickiness is consistently higher, with an average stickiness across stations of 5.2°C. In SE Australia and the U.S. Midwest, low Tw conditions are associated with relatively low dry-bulb temperatures and increased stickiness. In these midlatitude (rather than subtropical) regions, jet stream variability may influence local temperature and moisture conditions and drive these patterns (He et al. 2023). It is also possible that vegetation cover within these regions helps supply moisture during the summer months, preventing severely low specific humidity levels even as dry-bulb temperatures drop. The distinct summers of 2011 and 2012 in the U.S. Midwest are examples illustrating the range of stickiness at moderate Tw thresholds in this region. The hot and dry summer of 2012 was widely reported on due to the experience of flash droughts (e.g., Mallya et al. 2013; Otkin et al. 2016). While the preceding summer only experienced moderate dry-bulb temperatures, observed Tw values throughout the region were actually higher than in 2012 (Fig. S21). Stickiness can help to characterize the contrasting conditions that dominated these summers—both in the bulk of the distribution and in the tails, as well as distinguishing primarily temperature-driven versus primarily humidity-driven differences—without resorting to combinations of other temperature and humidity variables.\n\nAs discussed in the introduction, existing approaches to quantifying the temperature and humidity contributions to Tw extremes tend to be defined on scales that are specific to a given location and depend on the typical ranges in these variables that occur there. Stickiness aims to be more broadly relevant and allow greater ease of comparison between climates. Stickiness is arguably still most valuable in a relative sense, however, in that its variations are systematically different at different Tw values as shown above. In particular, very high Tw tends to only occur concurrently with high stickiness, while stickiness varies more widely at lower Tw. Stickiness provides the greatest insights into the physical drivers of extreme humid heat when evaluating it at similar Tw values (i.e., along a vertical line in Fig. 9). Comparisons across very different regions and seasons reveal stickiness’ inherent sensitivity to baseline temperature, since the Clausius–Clapeyron relationship dictates that the latent heat of a parcel increases faster than its dry enthalpy with temperature. This also implies that in general under climate change, latent heat will contribute ever more to the total moist static energy and related Tw (Matthews 2018; Lutsko 2021), increasing the fraction of global extreme events with high stickiness.\n\nHowever, in contrast to existing approaches, the utility of stickiness as a diagnostic is not relative in the sense of depending on the range of variability within a given climate. It need only be defined once, rather than many times for different locations, and comparing two stickiness values occurring at the same Tw is meaningful even if the two observations were taken from different locations with different ranges of seasonal or subseasonal variation. We conclude that, while no single diagnostic meets all possible needs, stickiness may be a useful addition to existing variables for analyses of the contributions of temperature and humidity to variations in Tw or other measures of humid heat."
