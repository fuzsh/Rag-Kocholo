        "text": "I've met a few people who've argued vehemently that leos can be kept just fine without humid hides. One person even stated that humid hides don't stay warm enough, negatively effect growth, color, health, etc., and can cause respiratory infections and eye problems.\n\nNow I know the vast majority of people agree leos need humid hides, and that they prevent things like shedding issues and eye problems (I had a link from a vet stating this, but I'm afraid I've lost it).\n\nI'm genuinely curious what y'all think. This is just to be a discussion - not an argument. What I do know about leos (which, in the grand scheme of things, isn't much) would lead me to believe that it's simply not a good idea to not have it. The one person who argued against their use also said that they check their geckos daily and remove any stuck shed immediately - which would lead me to believe that it's probably not working as \"great\" as they claim. However, as we all know, there are many different ways to do things. So, what does everyone else think on the matter? Yes? No? Possibly?\n\n~Maggot\n\nYou know I'm only an amateur at this but if I were to wrap my mind around the issue I'd say the humid hide makes sense - that it's ok to have... You've stated a number of times, and have stated very well, requirements for proper care: a minimum number of hides (3), ground temps air temps, enclosure requirements such as size, substrate, supplementing, diet, ect ect ect... Lets say for the sake of argument all are met well with no mistakes\n\nNow humid hide vs no humid hide - is the humid hide placed properly near the warm/hot end? What is holding humidity in the hide? Moss, paper towel or something else? I read recently that the humidity from the moss could potentially cause respiratory issues (problem that the use of moss is the central issue), it convinced me to go back to lining it with paper towel as I originally had. . . Getting back to the issue is the humid hide being checked and cleaned regularly? If you clean the cage and ignore the hide that's like cleaning your home but with the intent to ignore cleaning 1 room... How long would you let the area fester before you clean it? And how humid is the area, is it being soaked or sprayed until being damp? What kind of water? Tap or other? I use purified water... Most cities have chlorine and other chemicals in tap water - it's argued to pose no threat to humans... But what is the danger of having these chemicals evaporated into an enclosure and being breathed in again and again by your pet gecko?\n\nIf your hide is soaked causing heavy humidity - causing labored breathing, if it isn't cleaned regularly with possible filth or dirt of some kind settling in, the possibility of chemicals in the humid air, unattended untreated by you the owner, with improper substrate as well - then yeah it can pose a threat\n\nIf you use paper towel cleaned as regularly as you clean the tank, dampened not soaked, just a few sprays makes enough humidity it doesnt need to feel like florida after a rain storm, use bottled or purified water of some sort, kept attended as well as the rest of the enclosure is, ect. Just monitor it... I think it would be fine, if its too much the LG will get up and walk right out\n\n- that's just my opinion -\n\nMaggot who told you this? People who house their geckos in tubs or people who live in states in which the humidity remains moderate or high for most part of the year?\n\nThe one person who argued against their use also said that they check their geckos daily and remove any stuck shed immediately - which would lead me to believe that it's probably not working as \"great\" as they claim.\n\nThis speaks for itself. First off all you should NOT be pulling off their shed or even needing to in the first place. What a way to make a gecko comfortable, pulling at his skin, having to soak, picking at their eyes.....:roll:\n\nIt amazes me how some people find excuses for poor husbandry. If you provide optimal husbandry, your gecko will not spend more time than necessary in the humidity hide. The humidity hide should also be cleaned at least once a week. It not only aids in shedding, but hydration as well. Our job is to provide as many options as possible, including varied humidity levels to choose from.\n\nNot the URI!:roll: If it's that easy for them to develop a URI we would have heard of many cases from owners who own leos and live in states with moderate or high humidity. The majority of these people do not bother to use a dehumidifier.\n\nI know deep inside you know the truth.\n\nMaggot who told you this?

First off all you should NOT be pulling off their shed or even needing to in the first place. What a way to make a gecko comfortable, pulling at his skin, having to soak, picking at their eyes.....:roll:\n\nThis person said they live in Colorado, where humidity is very low. I died a little inside. They appeared to be a business, so I'm going to assume they're breeders who keep them in tubs. They said when the gecko sheds, they just put in a wet paper towel. I believe the other person is a breeder as well, though I don't recall where they are located.\n\nNot the URI!:roll: If it's that easy for them to develop a URI we would have heard of many cases from owners who own leos and live in states with moderate or high humidity. The majority of these people do not bother to use a dehumidifier.\n\nI asked them if they had any literature regarding instances of humid hides causing RIs, but I haven't heard back yet. Obviously a gecko (or any other reptile, really) that spends all their time in extremely humid environments can develop RIs. Only time I've ever heard of this being an issue is when the entire enclosure is kept too humid (well, actually, I've never heard of high humidity causing an RI, since high humidity is usually something that needs to be intentionally achieved; the most common cause of RIs I've seen is temps being too low). Whether the humid hide would be a threat would ultimately depend on if the gecko would just leave if that became an issue.\n\nI know deep inside you know the truth.\n\nI know what I believe deep down inside to be the truth, but like I said, I'm really not that knowledgeable or experienced in the grand scheme of things, so I wanted to know what others who are more both things thought no the matter.\n\n~Maggot\n\nWhat alternative is there, though? If there is no humid hide, the moisture has to come from somewhere. You can't watch your gecko 24/7 for signs of a coming shed. He/she is not going to wait for you to throw in paper towels or to soak him/her every time they need to shed. It is a personal act, not something the gecko wants to share with you. Soaking after a bad shed is definitely not ideal either. What else might you do? Making the entire tank humid seems like a bad idea, as does creating a humid section within the tank. If not in a hide of some sort, wouldn't that section dry up?\n\nEven if some alternative seems to be working just fine, there may be some issues (dehydration, perhaps) that are not readily apparent.\n\nWhat alternative is there, though?

The one just puts in wet paper towel when the geckos begin shedding and then removes what doesn't come off on its own. The other one says they don't provide any method of humidity unless bad sheds occur (which they say does happen, and in that case, they just put in wet paper towel inside a hide). The other breeding place says to either just put in wet paper towels or spray the entire enclosure until the paper towel is wet (if they are kept on paper towels).\n\n2 out of the 3 openly stated that this method has resulted in poor sheds, so I'm not sure why they feel this is a good idea, but I guess those are the methods they employ. I have to wonder if anyone uses them with actual success?\n\n~Maggot\n\nPeople picture Afghanistan and neighboring countries to be all sand, so in turn people buy sand as substrate most areas are hard soil, rock, pebbles, and clay ( and yes sand )... People also picture desert and when they do they picture DRY... Humidity levels are not zero... I've been to the UAE and neighboring nations... Chance of rain in Dubai UAE is zero however humidity levels there around this time probably are averaging at 40-50%, in a single day it could jump from 30 to 90% and still there is zero chance of rain... Afghanistan during this time may be experiencing humidity levels from the high teens to 70 %. With zero chance of rain... The sun eats it all up, but like heat, moisture can be held in the ground which in turn supports insect life as well as small animals. . .\n\nYou can't mimick that climate... You can only accommodate to certain aspects... So making a humid but wet environment is not right because it shouldn't be wet ... Making a dry environment and attempting to keep levels humid enough - you can't ...\n\nIn the month of August Kabul Afghanistan averaged a temp of 39 oC/102 oF averaged a humidity level of 82% (in a desert atmosphere).\n\nSo LG experience humidity ... That's not the question... What you have to ask yourself is how can you recreate or accommodate that and sooner or later make a choice.\n\nWell I know of three people who believe in the no humid hide method. The one just puts in wet paper towel when the geckos begin shedding and then removes what doesn't come off on its own.

I have to wonder if anyone uses them with actual success?\n\n~Maggot\n\nGiven all of these people state that correction for poor shed comes from increasing the moisture levels, I would much rather be proactive and provide the moist hide from the get go.\n\nI agree with Lizzy, and Joey. why would you want to leave it out? but yeah, if someone is blaming their humid hides for RIs, maybe they're not changing the substrate in the hide? I think the idea is that Leos, like BPs, do fine in a nice dry environment and then go find a damp burrow when they're in shed.\n\nI've never heard this for BPs (if you mean ball pythons). Everyone I know (and I know some very experienced keepers/breeders) agrees that they need to be kept at 50-60% humidity all the time. I can't say I've ever heard any of them suggest a humid hide, but I'm sure they wouldn't be against the idea of at least allowing the option.\n\n~Maggot\n\nOH, sorry for any confusion - I'm not suggesting a humid hide for BPs. I'm only saying in the wild they're going to solve the same problem as Leos by finding a damp burrow.\n\nif you don't boost your BP's humidity via misting when they're blue, 50-60% is often not enough for them to shed normally, either.\n\nmisting is largely ineffective in a setup like what you use to house Leos, so the humid hide is the common-sense fix.\n\nYou're right about bumping humidity. I misspoke. By \"all the time\" I meant never letting their enclosure get any drier than 50-60% (which is why many don't like the idea of housing BPs in aquariums). What I've seen suggested for shedding time is about 70%, give or take.\n\nI'm curious if humid hides can actually result in RIs though. Has anyone heard of such a thing actually happening?\n\n~Maggot"
