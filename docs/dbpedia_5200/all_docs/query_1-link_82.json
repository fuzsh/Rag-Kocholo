        "text": "DoF Punk says:\n\nA friend of mine's boyfriend is shipping off to serve in Afghanistan.\n\nShe thought it'd be great to get him a DSLR for Christmas as he leaves soon after. She asked for my advice.\n\nI immediately thought of the D200 plus an 18-200 VR mainly because both have weather sealing (the 18-200 to a much lesser extent i realise) that will protect it against the desert conditions and the humidity.\n\nCan anyone recommend another camera? or other lenses?\n\nMaybe dare i say something Canon?\n\nI know my 17-55mm is nicely sealed and i've had it rained on with no problem... but i was hoping for a little more range... any thing to compliment it with? for a novice?\n\n5:17PM, 2 December 2007 PDT\n\nwayxe says:\n\nIt depends on what other gear he has to carry. I would not hesitate to take my D300 and 18 to 200mm into the field. However, if I was wearing body armor and carrying 70 lbs of fire power I think I would rather have a good light weight point and shoot. It might be a good idea to ask him rather then surprise hm. Whatever he gets, I wish him a safe return.\n\nages ago\n\nLebronPhoto says:\n\nIs this guy in the military? When I served in the Middle East, I hesitated to bring an SLR with me. I ended up bringing a high end point and shoot. I had enough to carry with kevlar vest, LBE , weapon and other equipment. I was able to keep the point and shoot in one of my pockets and it didn't get in the way of my Soldiering. I would not recommend an SLR for a Soldier serving in a combat zone, trying to keep himself and his fellow Soldiers alive.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nLebronPhoto edited this topic ages ago.\n\nIn Memoriam: Hughes Léglise-Bataille says:\n\nThe D200 + 17-55 f/2.8 is a great combination for rough conditions, I've used it a lot for photojournalism (incl. under heavy rain, water canon, tear gas, and quite a bit of shocks) and it never failed me. Be sure to have a UV filter to protect the lens however, and maybe an extra lens hood (they're easy to break and hard to get), as well as an extra battery. However, it's a heavy tool, and as others mentioned, it would probably get in the way if you're not just taking photos ! And 55mm (83mm equivalent with the D200) might not be enough in terms of zoom. Also, I'm not sure it's the best option if your friend is new to photography anyway. A good P&S might be a better option ? Lighter, smaller, easier to use, less intrusive, and also cheaper ! Anyway, good luck to your friend and as part of the rpesent, maybe you could buy him a Pro Flickr account so he can share the photos ;-)\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nIn Memoriam: Hughes Léglise-Bataille edited this topic ages ago.\n\nDoF Punk says:\n\nHey thanks to Everyone,\n\nThe 18-200 isn't an option anymore because i completely forgot about the time i took it to Shanghai in August when it was about 38-41 degrees Celcius and the rubber grip on the focus and focal rings actually melted off...\n\nNikon Shanghai had the replaced for a grand total of 50 cents... but i don't think the Northern Alliance are going to have a Nikon dealer anywhere near Kabul.\n\n@ Lebron, my mate is in the cavalry so the storage won't be a big issue, but he'll more than likely use it for leisure time anyway. I sincerely doubt anyone rational would carry a SLR into a hot zone... except the photojournalist of course. HA!\n\nI don't mean to patronise, but i have alot of respect for people who've served, coming from a military family.\n\n@ Hugo and everyone else for the well wishes.\n\nages ago"
