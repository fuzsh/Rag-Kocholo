Data from environmental pollution monitoring data during the transition period of March, April and May has been analyzed. The calculation model for РМ10 is obtained depending on three factors: wind speed, humidity and air temperature. The dust concentration was described using the theory of stationary random functions. For the maximum daily concentration of РМ10 in Kabul, estimates of the parameters of the distribution functions were determined, a density function and an integrated distribution function were obtained as well. It is shown that, according to Chi-square and Kolmogorov-Smirnov criteria, the best distribution law of maximum daily concentration of dust is the normal law.",
