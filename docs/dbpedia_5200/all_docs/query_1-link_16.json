Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Kabul is essentially constant during the summer, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 22, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Summer in Kabul\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Summer in KabulJunJulAug0%0%10%10%20%20%30%30%40%40%50%50%60%60%70%70%80%80%90%90%100%100%SpringFallJul 310%Jul 310%Jun 10%Jun 10%Aug 310%Aug 310%Jul 10%Jul 10%drydry\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Kabul is decreasing during the summer, decreasing from 8.8 miles per hour to 7.5 miles per hour over the course of the season.\n\nFor reference, on June 29, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 9.0 miles per hour, while on November 20, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 4.9 miles per hour.\n\nThe highest daily average wind speed during the summer is 9.0 miles per hour on June 29.\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Summer in Kabul\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Summer in KabulJunJulAug0 mph0 mph2 mph2 mph4 mph4 mph6 mph6 mph8 mph8 mph10 mph10 mph12 mph12 mph14 mph14 mphSpringFallJun 299.0 mphJun 299.0 mphJun 18.8 mphJun 18.8 mphAug 317.5 mphAug 317.5 mphAug 18.3 mphAug 18.3 mphNowNow\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Kabul throughout the summer is predominantly from the north, with a peak proportion of 72% on July 12.\n\nWind Direction in the Summer in Kabul\n\nWind Direction in the Summer in KabulJunJulAug0%100%20%80%40%60%60%40%80%20%100%0%SpringFallNowNowwestnortheastsouth\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Kabul typically lasts for 8.1 months (248 days), from around March 15 to around November 18, rarely starting before February 23 or after April 7, and rarely ending before November 1 or after December 6.\n\nThe summer in Kabul is reliably fully within the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in the Summer in Kabul\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in the Summer in Kabulgrowing seasongrowing seasongrowing seasonJunJulAug0%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%SpringFall100%Jul 17100%Jul 17NowNowcoldcoolcomfortablewarmhotsweltering\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Kabul are very rapidly increasing during the summer, increasing by 2,530Â°F, from 1,000Â°F to 3,530Â°F, over the course of the season.\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Summer in Kabul\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Summer in KabulJunJulAug1,000Â°F1,000Â°F1,500Â°F1,500Â°F2,000Â°F2,000Â°F2,500Â°F2,500Â°F3,000Â°F3,000Â°F3,500Â°F3,500Â°FSpringFallJun 11,000Â°FJun 11,000Â°FAug 313,530Â°FAug 313,530Â°FJul 11,794Â°FJul 11,794Â°FAug 12,707Â°FAug 12,707Â°FNowNow\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Kabul is gradually decreasing during the summer, falling by 0.9 kWh, from 8.5 kWh to 7.6 kWh, over the course of the season.\n\nThe highest average daily incident shortwave solar energy during the summer is 8.9 kWh on June 30.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Summer in Kabul\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Summer in KabulJunJulAug0 kWh0 kWh1 kWh1 kWh2 kWh2 kWh3 kWh3 kWh4 kWh4 kWh5 kWh5 kWh6 kWh6 kWh7 kWh7 kWh8 kWh8 kWh9 kWh9 kWh10 kWh10 kWhSpringFallJun 308.9 kWhJun 308.9 kWhJun 18.5 kWhJun 18.5 kWhAug 317.6 kWhAug 317.6 kWhAug 18.3 kWhAug 18.3 kWhNowNow\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Kabul are 34.528 deg latitude, 69.172 deg longitude, and 5,899 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Kabul contains very significant variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 1,371 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 5,971 feet. Within 10 miles contains very significant variations in elevation (3,780 feet). Within 50 miles also contains extreme variations in elevation (13,261 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Kabul is covered by artificial surfaces (90%), within 10 miles by cropland (33%) and grassland (31%), and within 50 miles by grassland (67%) and cropland (13%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Kabul, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Kabul.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Kabul according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Kabul is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Kabul and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nKabul International Airport (OAKB, 98%, 3.5 mi, northeast, -23 ft elevation change)\n\nForward Operating Base Shank (OASH, 2.1%, 43 mi, south, 715 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Kabul and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
