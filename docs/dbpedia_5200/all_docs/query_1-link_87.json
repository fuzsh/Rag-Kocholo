        "text": "Shahid Reports\n\nFrom Pakistan\n\nBy Shahid Khan\n\nI am back in Pakistan after more than a year, and this time I have arrived in a city gripped by heat, dust and a humidity level equal to a sauna.\n\nThe promise of the coming monsoons is evident in my morning walks where clouds have gathered on the horizon during the night, but like a spoilsport, the sea breeze clears them out by midday when the sun beats down mercilessly, elevating temperatures into the high 90’s.\n\nThose who can afford to, huddle in dark air-conditioned rooms until the power goes out. Like many in his neighborhood, my father has a diesel generator that responds to these situations, but most residents of the city have nothing but electric fans or the breeze.\n\nIf the monsoons do come, (there is no guarantee) Karachiites will get some relief. Problems caused by the heavy rains, such as flooded neighborhoods and falling power lines and the like, will be ignored because rain is the most beautiful thing for them. People will walk around in the rain without umbrellas, smiling and spouting poetry about such weather.\n\nBut storm clouds of another kind are already dumping their load on Pakistan. A civil war is being fought in Swat and Waziristan against well-armed and well-financed religious extremists who want to impose their fanatical version of Islam on the rest of the country. Two million Pakistani civilians have fled their homes to escape the fighting and the government and private agencies are ill equipped to provide the food and shelter they require.\n\nOther parts of the country are also feeling the effects of the “war”. One week into my trip, the newspapers have reported thirty-one deaths in Karachi caused by rivals of two local political parties which operate like gangs in the poorer neighborhoods of the city. Taliban terrorists have also increased the number and intensity of their attacks in Peshawer and other frontier towns. On Friday last week, a well-known and respected moderate Islamic cleric, who had openly supported the Pakistani army’s actions in Swat and denounced the Taliban’s version of Islam, was assassinated in his seminary outside the country’s cultural capital Lahore, causing national outrage and calls for a national day of mourning.\n\nConspiracies Abound\n\nWhat does all this mean for the future of Pakistan and how are these events viewed and interpreted by the country’s citizens?\n\nWhat I have been struck by is the number of theories and contradicting conspiracies that are voiced by all kinds of people who should know better. One friend sat on the couch in my father’s house, drink in hand, and said all the power outages in Karachi are being caused by the United States because the US wants to destabilize Pakistan. When asked how that would benefit the United States, she had no answer.\n\nOthers have told me that the US and the current Pakistani leadership are working hand in hand and still supporting some of the Taliban. Again, the purposes of these conspiracies remain unknown.\n\nThey ask why the leadership of the Taliban remains at large when just a few weeks ago these same people were sitting in conference rooms negotiating peace deals; and, why is it possible for Baitullah Mehsud’s spokesman to call a BBC correspondent and speak to him for half an hour without being taken out by a drone?\n\nThere is deep skepticism in the country that the final outcome of this civil war will be decisive or, even if it is, that the result will be to their liking. All political leaders are viewed as self-serving and without any long term commitment to the welfare of the country. It seems like the people have been betrayed too many times and their view of the future is jaded and depressing.\n\nWhat most Pakistani are unwilling to assume is their own responsibility in the mistakes of the past—finger pointing and blaming outside forces is easier—which brings me to my own theory of why Pakistan finds itself in its present difficulties.\n\nReliance on Others\n\nFrom the early days of its creation, Pakistan has looked to others for its security and welfare—compromising its sovereignty and independence but benefiting in the short term from these alliances.\n\nIn its first two decades, Pakistan was known as the United States “most allied ally,” primarily against the Soviet alliance with India and a listening post against China. After a disastrous war with India in 1965 when the US stood by and let Pakistan suffer a humiliating defeat, relations with China flourished, as the two countries sought to put pressure on their common enemy, India.\n\nIn the meantime, Pakistan went through its first civil war, ending in the loss of East Pakistan and the creation of Bangladesh. After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Pakistan once again became a strategic partner of the US and provided a conduit for intelligence and arms in support of the Jihad against godless communists and their puppets in Kabul.\n\nAt this time, Saudi Arabia, with its pockets full of petrodollars, became a player in Pakistani politics. In the social sphere, Saudi Arabia started bankrolling fundamentalist madrassahs with the full support of the military dictator Zia-ul-Haq. With the defeat of the Soviets, Pakistan once again became an international pariah and languished in this state, surviving on the largesse of Arab states which continued to spread extremist Islamic practices in the country. Then came September 11, 2001 and we know the rest.\n\nWith this checkered history in the short span of sixty years, is it any wonder that Pakistan is a fractured and divided country?\n\nSome Good News\n\nThe good news, though, is that the Taliban’s actions seem to be self-defeating.\n\nMore and more Pakistanis are becoming aware of the nature of the threat to their everyday lives, not only from suicide bombers, but also the way they might be forced to live—no music, no women in the streets, no girls schools, no shaving of beards—basically no art and no culture as we know it, with arbitrary justice meted out by brutal and uncivilized extremists.\n\nAnd, there are some glimmers of hope. In a few locales in the FATA tribal areas, “Lashkars” (militias) formed by village elders are fighting to rid themselves of the Taliban in their areas. Although they might be supported by Pakistani army funding and arms, at least they are making their stand for control of their own lives.\n\nLeaders of the major political parties stand united, (at least in public) in their vocal opposition to religious extremism. The army is making progress against the militants, though they as yet lack the support of a populace united against what policy makers in Washington call an “existential” threat.\n\nWhile Richard Holbrooke and Hillary Clinton spout off about how Pakistanis have come to realize that they must fight for their country’s very existence as a modern state, the reality is that Pakistanis are yet to be fully convinced of this fact. Most still view their leaders as US puppets and that makes them untrustworthy. They decry the ineffectiveness of the government in dealing with the suffering of millions displaced by a war on their own citizens, which they perceive to have been started at the behest of Washington.\n\nThe US and its partners could go a long way towards shifting negative perceptions of the west and weakening the position of the extremists by stepping in forcefully with massive amounts of humanitarian aid at this time. A quick humanitarian response by the international community to earthquake victims several years ago resulted in a big up-tick in favorable opinions of the US and the west.\n\nIn addition, the United States and its partners should be pressing the Saudis and other Arab states to identify and shut down sources of financing to the Taliban. Religious leaders in Pakistan must continue to speak out against extremism and, most importantly, Pakistanis must overcome their reliance on outside forces, and take charge of their own country to combat the internal forces that threaten to undermine its existence as a functioning state.\n\nWithout these actions, Pakistan is likely to remain a country at war with itself and the outside world.\n\n(Pakistani native Shahid Khan and his wife Lee live in North Randolph.
