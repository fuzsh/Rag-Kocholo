        "text": "Groundwater resources is an important natural resource in Afghanistan especially in Kabul city, the capital city of Afghanistan. Groundwater resources in Kabul Basin are important for all of the drinking, domestics, industrial and agricultural water use. Additionally, the dramatic increase of the population in Kabul City in recent years causes a significant decrease in groundwater resources of Kabul Basin. This study was undertaken in order to predict groundwater level fluctuation in central Kabul basin. The groundwater distribution and the fluctuation were investigated with the details. Groundwater distribution was examined by groundwater level (above sea level) and groundwater depth (below land surface). The monitored groundwater level data for the period from 2006 â€• 2015 was used. The observation wells were categorized into 21 groups according to their locations. As a result, the groundwater level in west part of central Kabul basin was found to be lower than the other areas. The groundwater levels in groups of wells in the southern and eastern parts of the basin were higher and consistent, whereas the groundwater levels in the western part of the basin were lower and inconsistent due to the fact that groups of wells in the southern and the eastern parts of the basin are located near the rivers, and wells on the western part of the basin are far from the rivers. It can be presumed that the groundwater flows from suburb to urban areas, on the western part of the central Kabul basin. Groundwater level fluctuations were examined using 65 wells data. All wells were classified into the following two types; (1) water level was fluctuated proportional to the rainfall variations, found mostly in groups of wells in the southern and eastern parts of the basin, and (2) water level gradually decreased with the fluctuation during the study period, as seen in some wells located in the western part of the basin. In order to evaluate the impacts of climate change on groundwater in Kabul basin, the groundwater level fluctuations were simulated using four selected observation wells by using GLTM. Precipitation data and evapotranspiration data calculated by Penman-Montheith method were used as inputs to the simulation model. The Evolution Strategy was applied to determine the model parameters. The future climate data for the period 2020-2099, include the average temperature, rainfall, and evapotranspiration data, were used for projecting the future groundwater level fluctuation. The impact of climate change was projected under RCPs scenarios included the four different radiative pathways; RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5. Although the decrement of annual rainfall is predicted as small, the simulation model predicted a remarkable decrement in groundwater level. The results indicate that the decline of groundwater level in central Kabul basin is not only by the impact of rainfall, but also by overuse of groundwater by human. The overuse of groundwater in the Central Kabul Basin is the key driver of groundwater level decline at the present as well as in the future."
