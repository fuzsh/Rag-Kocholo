        "text": "It is believed that this bust depicts Flavius Josephus, the famous first-century Jewish historian who was born approximately four years after Jesus was condemned to die. In his autobiography, Josephus tells us:\n\nI was born to Matthias in the first year of the reign of Caius Caesar [more commonly known as Caligula]. I have three sons: Hyrcanus, the eldest, was born in the fourth year of the reign of Vespasian, as was Justus born in the seventh, and Agrippa in the ninth.\n\nSince Caligula ruled Rome between 37â€“41, in the first century, Josephus was born in 37 A.D. His histories have been significant primary sources for scholars, historians and general readers ever since they were initially published."
