        "text": "Josephus was born in Jerusalem (Judaea) in about AD 37. Josephus commanded Jewish forces against the Romans in Galilee. However, after surrendering to the Romans he was immediately released and granted permission to stay and observe the rest of the war.\n\nAt the siege of Jerusalem, Josephus pleaded with the Jewish forces to surrender to the Romans.\n\nAfter the war Josephus went to live in Rome where he was given a pension and granted Roman citizenship. Josephus now became a historian and in his book, The Jewish War he was extremely critical of the Zealots who resisted Roman rule. Other books that he wrote on Jewish history were also very pro-Roman.\n\nJosephus died in about AD 95."
