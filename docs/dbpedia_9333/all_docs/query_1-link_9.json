        "text": "Titus Flavius Josephus, born in Jerusalem in 37 CE, was a Jewish Roman historian whose works are considered a major source for early Jewish history, particularly with regard to the Jewish Roman Wars in the first century CE.\n\nJosephus fought against the Romans and led the Jewish forces in Galilee during the first Jewish-Roman War (66-73 CE). He surrendered in 67 CE to Vespasianâs army. In captivity, Josephus told Vespasian that Jewish Messianic prophecies had made reference to Vespasian becoming Emperor of Rome. Josephus was kept as an interpreter and granted freedom after Vespasian became emperor two years later in 69 CE. In gratitude Josephus adopted the emperorâs family name Flavius.\n\nFlavius Josephus defected to the Roman side and was granted Roman citizenship. He became an advisor and translator for Vespasianâs son Titus during the Siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Given his strategic position, Josephusâ writings provide important eye witness accounts of events in Jerusalem during the first century CE. However, the imperial patronage of Josephusâ work means that doubts are cast as to the extent to which he produced impartial histories and speculation is raised as to the degree to which his accounts were the imaginings of the victor."
