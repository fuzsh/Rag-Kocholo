        "text": "It was about time for Chris Carrabba (from Dashboard Confessional and Further Seems Forever) to come up with a new project. Twin Forks is the name of the band and the genre is somewhere between neo-folk and indie rock with some bluegrass flavour.\n\nTwin Forks' first song was released a month ago and now they are back with a new one - \"Something We Just Know\". I'm completely in love with it and really excited for this band now. I hope they are writing a full length and we would be able to hear it during the summer, it would be the perfect soundtrack! As always Chris' lyrics are just brilliant.\n\n\"Some may use their judgement, some will use their wisdom. Me I, use my gut, and my gut, my gut. My gut don't lie to me, my gut don't lie to me.\n\nIt's something we just know, we feel it in our bones. We don't need to be told, it's something we just know. It's something we just know.\""
