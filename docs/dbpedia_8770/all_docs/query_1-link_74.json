        "text": "While 2020 was a rough year for most, Dashboard Confessional singer Chris Carrabba added recovery from a motorcycle accident to things he had to overcome. But after a trying year, the singer has put some of his emotions into his music, kicking off promotion for his new record with the heartfelt new song, \"Here's to Moving On.\"\n\nOn his social media, the vocalist simply stated, \"Last year was kind of a rough year. I wrote a song about it. It's called 'Here's To Moving On.'\"\n\nElaborating more in a trailer for the upcoming album, All the Truth That I Can Tell, below, Carrabba says of the new song, \"To be honest, I wasn't sure I'd ever find a way to put this into words. But through the highs and lows and everything in between I've come to discover that the truth is something that is constantly evolving. I've found the beauty in accepting that you can't always be in control of where life will take you, that not everything is meant to last forever. The beauty is in listening, growing and loving relentlessly with your whole heart. The beauty is in moving on.\"\n\nGet a closer look at the lyrics and hear the song in the player below:\n\nDashboard Confessional, \"Here's to Moving On\" Lyrics\n\nI feel like I find something new\n\nTo remind me of you all the time\n\nA picture a hair band a song\n\nOr this cork from this bottle of wine\n\nThe click of the thermostat kicking off\n\nJust when it’s getting too warm\n\nThe drop in the pressure the\n\nSmell in the air, when it’s starting to storm\n\n-And I hate\n\nTo admit\n\nThat it’s true\n\nBut I like\n\nThat it hurts\n\nWhen I do\n\nHere’s to fighting less\n\nHere’s to living more\n\nHere’s to feeling alive again\n\nHere’s to picking yourself off the floor\n\nHere’s to waking up\n\nHere’s to sleeping well for once\n\nHere’s to knowing the things\n\nThat you wish you could change\n\nHere’s to saying you’re fine when you’re not\n\nHere’s to being right\n\nHere’s to being wrong\n\nHere’s to letting go\n\nHere’s to moving on\n\nI stand in one place and just listen\n\nAnd let myself feel how it sounds\n\nA little bit hollow, a little bit hopeful\n\nA little bit down\n\nThis house isn’t empty, exactly,\n\n-It’s settling down for the night\n\nIt;s creaking and cracking\n\nAnd it seems familiar\n\nBut doesn’t feel right\n\n-All that time\n\nThat it takes\n\nTo let go\n\nHow could I\n\nBe the last\n\nOne to know\n\nHere’s to fighting less\n\nHere’s to living more\n\nHere’s to feeling alive again\n\nHere’s to picking yourself off the floor\n\nHere’s to waking up\n\nHere’s to sleeping well for once\n\nHere’s to knowing the things\n\nThat you wish you could change\n\nHere’s to saying you’re fine when you’re not\n\nHere’s to being right\n\nHere’s to being wrong\n\nHere’s to letting go\n\nHere’s to moving on\n\nI’m getting up slowly\n\nI’m still a bit spent\n\nI’m still a bit tired\n\nI feel a bit better this morning\n\nThan I’ve felt in quite a long time\n\nIt’s funny I thought for a bit there\n\nI’d never be able to deal\n\nBut I make some coffee\n\nAnd I take a shower\n\nAnd I start to heal\n\n-And I hate\n\nTo admit\n\nThat I can\n\nBut I like\n\nHow it feels\n\nThat I am\n\nSo here’s to fighting less\n\nHere’s to living more\n\nHere’s to feeling alive again\n\nHere’s to picking yourself off the floor\n\nHere’s to waking up\n\nHere’s to sleeping well for once\n\nHere’s to knowing the things\n\nThat you wish you could change\n\nHere’s to saying you’re fine when you’re not\n\nHere’s to being right\n\nHere’s to being wrong\n\nHere’s to letting go\n\nHere’s to moving on\n\nDashboard Confessional, \"Here's to Moving On\"\n\nIf you like what you heard, \"Here's to Moving On\" is available at this location.
