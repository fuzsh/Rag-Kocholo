        "text": "Artist: Dashboard Confessional\n\nAlbum: Alter The Ending\n\nGenre: Mature Pop Rock\n\nLabel: Interscope\n\nChris Carabba has been making waves as the heart-on-his-sleeve singer-songwriter-mastermind behind Dashboard Confessional since the release of A Swiss Army Romance in 2000. Before that, he was amongst the emo pioneers with his work in then relatively unknown Further Seems Forever. Personally, I’ve been following Carabba and his work throughout his entire career and having said that, I cannot begin to explain the timidness I had toward listening to the group’s new album Alter The Ending.\n\nI try to always stay current with the changing trends in music. Even if it’s not my style, I’ve always done my best to make myself try and see what people find enjoyable about as many genres of music as I could, but I must admit I’ve always heavily favored the earlier work of Dashboard Confessional. It’s not even the expansion of sound over the past few records that has created the sour taste in my mouth, but simply the overall quality of songwriting. Following the completely hit and miss Dusk and Summer, I was in a stage of turmoil with my Dashboard love, but I decided to fight my notions and put the record on to see what Carabba and crew have to offer this time.\n\nWithin the first minutes of the opener, “Get Me Right,” it’s obvious that something has changed in the world of Chris Carabba since the last time we heard from him. There’s this since of maturity in every lick that comes through the speakers both lyrically and musically. The subject matter, especially on the opener and the following, “Until Morning,” is no longer girl-centric, but it seems Carabba has finally fully embraced his adult life and is writing to that affect. I was instantly back into everything I’d ever loved about Dashboard: the guitar work wasn’t overly difficult, but seemed perfect for each poetic line that Carabba conveyed and all at once I knew I was in for something I didn’t expect.\n\nI listened on and cringed as the mainstream track gone wrong, “Belle of the Boulevard” rolled by. Not once since its release have I been into the track, it jsut feels way too generic for a musician of this caliber. Luckily, the pounding drums and belting vocals of the title track pulled me back into the record. There’s something about the Carabba’s vocals that are simply timeless on this and every DC release. Even now in his 30’s he sounds like the voice of the youth and that’s one attribute seems to be going nowhere in the foreseeable future.\n\nWhile most of the album does a fairly decent job of steering clear of “woe is me” love songs, Carabba hits the nail on the head with the moving “Even Now.” This simple song reverberates the emotions of nearly anyone whose gone through a break up or emotional rough patch with a loved one in the past 50 years. For some reason, even now, a decade later, DC has the ability to make everyone feel the same way about love and life with just an acoustic guitar, some words, and the occasional drum line. It’s engaging and deep without going into cliche territory and in this day and age, that’s really saying something in terms of acoustic ballads. Though Dashboard did lay the blueprints for most the emerging acoustic acts, that doesn’t give them any “get out of jail” passes for progression.\n\nOutside of the expected, Dashboard steps out of the box on tracks like “No Motion” to add new elements [in this case a thick synth line] to their sound. The writing works perfectly with most these attempts [though the folk heavy “I Know You” feels a bit flat] and leaves you please with the results, just not floored.\n\nThough Alter The Ending shows Chris Carabba finding his footing after slipping into a bit of a creative funk on the last release, it’s still not Dashboard’s A-game. I feel like these last two records both showcase a band unsure of its footing and that’s fine because development is key, but its depressing to still be getting albums with handfuls of “meh” tracks this deep into a career. Dashboard did take a smart marketing move by recording the entire album acoustically for a bonus disc for those willing to purchase the deluxe edition [which most die hard fans will], but its simply not enough to wow me. I love you DC, but I’m not sure things will ever be as great as they once were.\n\nScore: 7/10"
