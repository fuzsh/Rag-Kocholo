        "text": "Notes from the music beat … When Chris Carrabba adopted the name Dashboard Confessional to record “The Swiss Army Romance” in 2000, he had no idea he was starting a new band. At the time, the Florida musician considered it just a solo side project from his regular group, Further Seems Forever. “I was very happy in Further Seems Forever,” recalls Carrabba, 35, who’s currently on tour celebrating the 10th anniversary of “The Swiss Army Romance.” “But the content of that band was complicated songs, which can be great. But I had turned my back on a simpler way of writing music that still appealed to me quite a bit, and I was missing that. “So I began writing very stripped-down, nearly naked songs, and that became ‘The Swiss Army Romance.’ I had no real interest in releasing it, but then a friend convinced me to release it and do one tour, that I’d really enjoy that challenge of going out by myself — and he was right.” Carrabba wound up leaving Further Seems Forever after that band’s next album, “The Moon is Down,” and devoting himself entirely to Dashboard Confessional, which evolved into a full band with a more full-blown electric approach and five more albums since. But neither Carrabba nor his fans forgot where things started, and he says they were instrumental in convincing him to revisit that inaugural album this year. “Over the course of the last year or so people kept asking me what I was going to do to commemorate this anniversary, and it got me thinking about it,” Carrabba says. “It’s worthy of celebrating, I think. It changed my life. “I didn’t want to overdo it, but I thought it would be a very nice thing to go out and play the songs in the order they appear on the record. I did it one time before, when I made the demo for a record into a Dictaphone. Other than that I’ve never played them all together like this.” Even as he blasts through the past, however, Carrabba is thinking about the future and Dashboard’s follow-up to 2009’s “Alter the Ending.” “I write all the time,” he explains. “I’m in constant pursuit of that one (song) that will change the course of how I write, which happens every time I make a record. I write songs as a hobby, not as a profession. It’s a great extension of my hobby that I get to have a profession with it. So I wait for that new thing that gets you excited. “I feel like I might have found that the other day, in fact; if I’m right I guess we’ve started. It’s too early to say, but I write quickly, so who knows … ” Dashboard Confessional brings its ‘Swiss Army Romance’ 10th Anniversary Tour to town Friday, Dec. 17, at the Crofoot Ballroom, 1 S. Saginaw St., Pontiac. Doors open at 7 p.m. Tickets are $28. Call 248-758-9770 or visit www.thecrofoot.com. Twiztid After 13 years and eight studio albums, the Warren hip-hop duo Twiztid still looks for “other challenges,” according to the group’s Monoxide. This year’s came in the form of Twiztid’s latest album, “Heartbroken & Homicidal,” which marks the first time he handled production duties for an entire album. “It was an interesting procession, extremely trying,” says Monoxide, real name Paul Methric, who founded Twiztid with partner Jamie Madrox (ne Spaniolo) after a stint in the group House of Krazees. “It’s hard enough just writing the songs, just writing the words and the lyrics. On top of that to throw the production into it, it was really tough, but I loved it. It was a good challenge.” “Heartbroken” sports a more rock-flavored sound for the duo, with Stefanie Eulinberg from Kid Rock’s Twisted Brown Trucker band playing drums and singing on three tracks. “It shows people a different side of us,” says Monoxide, who was assisted by Eric Davie on the project. “Some like it, some don’t. But that’s with everything. You can’t please everybody.” The album did debut at No. 29 on the Billboard 200 chart, Twiztid’s second highest bow after 2009’s “W.I.C.K.E.D.” Meanwhile, Monoxide and Jamie Madrox are confident their 2011 effort, tentatively titled “Dismembered” and ready to record in the new year, will be more instantly appealing to fans of Twiztid’s established horrorcore brand of hip-hop. “It will be the most evil thing the industry’s ever heard,” Monoxide promises. “It will be the most evil thing to ever be released. We’re coming for that spot as hard as we can, so watch out for it.” Twiztid, Just Blaze, AJAX and MicLordz and Sauce Funky perform Friday, Dec. 17, at Clutch Cargo’s, 65 E. Huron St. Pontiac. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. Tickets are $18 in advance, $20 at the door. Call 248-333-2362 or visit www.clutchcargos.com. Jay Siegel & The Tokens The Tokens’ Jay Siegel is 71 years old these days — a long cry from the 22-year-old who sang the piercing falsetto on the group’s chart-topping 1961 hit “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.” But Siegel proudly notes that he hasn’t lost anything over the years. “Fortunately for me I’m able to still sing the songs in the same key and hit the high notes — and I’m knocking on wood I’ll be able to keep doing it,” says Siegel, who joined the group in 1965 when it was still known as the Linc-Tones, co-founded by Neil Sedaka two years earlier at Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn. Siegel, who’s fronted The Tokens since Sedaka’s departure in 1957, says there’s no great secret to his fountain of vocal youth, either. “The only explanation is I tried this job I have as my job,” he explains. “After work I go home. I try to live a normal life. I don’t hang out at the bars and clubs and party and all those things, and I don’t abuse my body. “I guess the business keeps you young. I have a real young attitude. I don’t feel my chronological age; in my head I’m 21, and my voice is about 19 years old, so that’s good.” The Tokens, whose lineup now includes John “Jay” Traynor from Jay & the Americans, did have several other charting hits — including “Tonight I Fell In Love,” “I Hear Trumpets Blow” and “Portrait of Love,” but it’s “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” that everyone remembers. And Siegel says there’s nothing wrong with that. “It’s a marvelous feeling,” says Siegel, who sang on Robert John’s hit 1972 remake of “The Lion” and has also produced songs such as Tony Orlando & Dawn’s “Tie a Yellow Ribbon” and the Chiffons’ “He’s So Fine.” “The record came out at the end of 1961. It remained on the charts three months into 1962, was a No. 1 record in 36 countries. When ‘The Lion King’ movie came out, it became an international hit all over again. We now have audiences of 5-year-old kids who know the song. That’s a wonderful thing. And if that’s what brings people out to see us, then we can sing our other songs for them and let them see what else we’ve got.” Jay Siegel & The Tokens perform with Charlie Thomas’ Drifters, Jimmy Beaumont & the Skylyners, Eugne Pitt & the Jive Five and more in Doo Wop Yule Pop at 7:30 p.m. Friday, Dec. 17, at the Fox Theatre, 2211 Woodward Ave. Tickets are $23.50-75.

But he’ll pop up as the musical guest on this weekend’s edition of NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” — with a historic twist. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Eminem will be joined by fellow rapper Lil Wayne for the latter’s first televised performance since being released from Rikers Island prison on Nov. 4 after serving eight months on a weapons possession charge. The two are expected to recreate “No Love,” their collaboration from Eminem’s latest album “Recovery.” Eminem is nominated for 10 Grammy Awards for the chart-topping set. “Saturday Night Live” airs at 11:30 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 18, on WDIV, Channel 4 in Detroit. Actor Jeff Bridges is this week’s host. Sounds and Spirits Twenty-one area bands — including the Hard Lessons, American Mars, Gorevette and Johnny Headband — will take part in this year’s 9th Annual Detroit Sounds and Spirits Olde-Fashioned Holiday Spectacular. As in previous years, the groups will play their takes on holiday favorites as well as original material. Launched in 2002 by Dave Feeny, owner of Tempermill Studios in Ferndale and a member of American Mars and Blanche, Sounds and Spirits has raised more than $17,000 for Detroit’s Coalition on Temporary Shelter (COTS), which provides emergency shelter for those in need. Surprise guests and celebrity emcees have been part of the event’s history, and Feeny promises this year’s show won’t be any different — although he’d likely say that no matter what. Sounds and Spirits takes place Thursday, Dec. 23, at the Magic Stick, 4142 Woodward Ave., Detroit. Doors open at 8 p.m. Tickets are $15. Call 313-833-9700 or visit\n\nwww.majesticdetroit.com\n\n. Insane Clown Posse Nothing seems more appropriate for a holiday warm-up than Insane Clown Posse. Well, maybe not, but the hip-hop duo has a gift for its juggalos with a homecoming show on Thursday, Dec. 23, at Detroit’s Saint Andrews Hall. Besides continuing to promote its latest release, “Bang! Pow! Boom!” ICP will also be pushing its first-ever Super Slam’s Super Live Toy Drive, which is collecting new toys and winter clothing for children. Fans contributing items will receive “Holiday Heat,” an exclusive CD featuring 15 tracks from artists on ICP’s Psychopathic Records label. Donations can be made at the show or mailed to P.O. Box 620, Farmington, MI 48332. The drive continues until Jan. 31. Saint Andrews Hall is at 431 E. Congress St. Doors open at 7 p.m. Tickets are $47.20 and $62.95; the latter includes a Big Ballas Xmas Party downstairs in the Shelter is $62.95. Call 313-961-8137 or visit www.livenation.com. Mayer Hawthorne Mayer Hawthorne hasn’t been on stage in Detroit for a while. But he’s certainly been around town. The Ann Arbor-raised R&B singer (real name Andrew Mayer Cohen and a former member of the hip-hop group Now On) recorded much of his second album in Detroit, in the bedroom studio of an apartment he rented in downtown Detroit. “It was off Third Street, pretty close to downtown,” says Hawthorne, 31. “I wanted to be right in the heart of it. I wanted to make sure that I captured that essence of that Detroit soul, so it’s still very rooted in that.” That said, Hawthorne adds that fans can also expect to hear “a lot of my other influences coming through on this record. You’re going to hear more of my affinity for Steely Dan and the Beatles and the Byrds and the Hollies and the Doobie Brothers — probably some Public Enemy and N.W.A., too. “It just happens kind of naturally. It’s not something I kind of really have to plan or orchestrate. I was making rock music and hip-hop long before I was making soul music, so those influences automatically come out in everything I do.” The new album, which Hawthorne plans to release in 2011, will also feature guest appearances by Snoop Dogg and Motown guitarist Dennis Coffey; Hawthorne returned the favor to the latter by recording a track for Coffey’s forthcoming album. And unlike his critically lauded 2009 debut “A Strange Arrangement,” which spawned the hit single “Just Ain’t Gonna Work Out,” Hawthorne’s next release will be put out to accompanying expectations. But he says he’s not feeling the pressure. “I played a couple of the (new) songs for my close friends recently,” he says, “and the reaction, which I thought was hysterical, was that, ‘We didn’t think you’d be able to beat “A Strange Arrangement.” ‘ Even my closest friends didn’t think I’d be able to top it. They were reluctant to admit they thought the new material was better. So I’m feeling good about it. “It’s definitely my favorite material I’ve recorded to date. If everybody likes it as much as ‘A Strange Arrangement,’ then fantastic. If not, that’s OK, too.” Mayer Hawthorne, Macpodz and 14kt perform Thursday, Dec. 23, at the Majestic Theatre, 4140 Woodward Ave., Detroit. Doors open at 8 p.m. Tickets are $15 in advance, $17 at the door. Call 3130833-9700 or visit www.majesticdetroit.com. Gary Graff writes about music for The Oakland Press.
