        "text": "Following the tour behind his sixth Dashboard Confessional album, 2009’s Alter the Ending, singer-songwriter Chris Carrabba, one of the key figures from last decade’s emo movement, found himself feeling severely limited by the prospect of creating more indie rock. He craved a new challenge.\n\n“After all of those records, finally it seemed like the parameters of what a Dashboard song could be, which at one point was very broad, had suddenly become very narrow,” he shared during a phone interview last month. Three years into solo work, he has returned to the road with a new band, Twin Forks, which stops Monday at the Troubadour in West Hollywood and Wednesday at Detroit Bar in Costa Mesa.\n\nCarrabba initially shifted gears in 2010, deeply diving into his earliest influences, including Leonard Cohen and Paul Simon. The 38-year-old, who also once fronted rock band Further Seems Forever, strengthened his guitar chops, taking time to learn Travis picking as he began to explore a more bluegrass, toe-tappin’ style. “Once I had done that, the songs were more storyteller in nature,” he says.\n\nHe released an album of remakes the next year, Covered in the Flood, featuring cuts originally by R.E.M., Big Star and the Replacements. While touring behind that effort, he appeared at last year’s Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival in San Francisco, enlisting two longtime collaborators, bassist Jonathan Clark and drummer Ben Homola, for the gig. That set became the defining moment for Carrabba’s fresh direction.\n\n“My friend, who is a promoter, booked me on that,” he recalls, “and I think she had something in mind for me, given the stuff I had told her I was working on but wasn’t comfortable playing yet. She kind of demanded that I get up there with a band and thought I’d find what I was looking for. She was right.”\n\nAs the audience response grew more positive, the guitarist felt confident enough to launch into a boot-stompin’ cover of Talking Heads’ “And She Was,” and soon after that “illuminating” flash in time, as he describes it, a master plan soon unfolded.\n\nYet, though he and his new musical mates had spent lots of time in a Florida studio writing for other artists, Carrabba says they had resisted calling themselves a band; each player was far too busy, wrapped up in other endeavors.\n\n“I think we spent more time convincing ourselves that whatever magic we were noticing was not there,” he admits with a laugh, but “by the time we walked off the stage at that bluegrass festival, we were a band and we knew it.”\n\nNot long after making Twin Forks official, mandolin player Suzie Zeldin was added and the group recorded its debut EP, a five-song self-titled set that dropped Sept. 17. Carrabba says that, like any new band, this one is starting from the beginning, and though he has reached amphitheater and arena status with his other groups, it’s been exciting to return to smaller-capacity clubs for his outfit’s current trek.\n\n“We’re a small band, so there’s no skipping steps here,” he says, “and really, I have no desire to. We’re always going to have to end up talking about our other bands – Dashboard, the Narrative, Bad Books – and we’re always going to have people show up who know that’s part of our lineage. But this is a Twin Forks show. We deserve a chance to prove that this band is its own thing, with its own identity, and it’s just as good.”\n\nWith such a minimal amount of recorded output to perform live, Twin Forks adds numerous covers each night, drawing from 20-30 selections they have rehearsed. Within that repertoire are Hank Williams’ “I Saw the Light,” “Texas Love Song” by Slaid Cleaves, “She’s Electric” by Oasis, Fleetwood Mac’s “Second Hand News,” Pavement’s “Cut Your Hair,” and “El Scorcho” by Weezer, just to name a few.\n\nOf course, there are occasionally countrified versions of Dashboard Confessional and Further Seems Forever tracks, but Carrabba shies away from those aces in the hole.\n\n“It’s nice to have that in your pocket,” he admits. “You have to resist the temptation to play them, but we’ve done a few on some nights, or done a Bad Books song. We’ll do ‘You Wouldn’t Have to Ask,’ which is one of my favorite songs. I mean, rules are meant to be broken. We’ll walk in without planning one of those songs, and walk out sometimes having played one.”\n\nTwin Forks is scheduled to tour almost nonstop until the end of the year and will issue its first full-length title on Canada’s Dine Alone Records in early 2014. The new project, Carrabba insists, has instilled in him a great deal more artistic freedom. Apart from rarely playing the same set twice, the former member of Interscrope Records’ roster says he’s enjoying working at the independent level again.\n\n“The general camaraderie is so fun,” he says of his latest venture. “It’s going to sound weird to say this, but I enjoy the willingness that people have to do what they say they’re going to do – that’s amazing. (Dine Alone) is just a great place with honest people that are genuinely huge music fans, working in a small company with a giant ability to get stuff done.”\n\nIt reminds him of his formative days at L.A.’s Vagrant Records, “when these bands that had all grown up together at the label helped each other out. We were given direction and we were guided with real sensibility. Here, I’m finding that, too. And though I consider myself relatively seasoned, I’m still learning great things from these guys.”"
