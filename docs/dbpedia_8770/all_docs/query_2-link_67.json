        "text": "The album begins with ‘Burning Heart’, one of the highlights of the entire album; it is stripped back to the core with just Carrabba’s voice and the melody of an acoustic guitar.\n\nAt no point does the tone change, if you are aware of his previous discography, the first listen is full of anticipation, like you are waiting for the loud instrumental to kick in and for the lyrics to take a different direction - but that never comes. You have to listen again to truly experience burning heart the way it was intended. The lyrics are emotionally raw and this is the case for most of the album, the lack of clashing guitar riffs and drums allow his sheer talent in songwriting to shine.\n\nThe pace continues to be slow and emotive until the third track, the ‘Better of Me’ which shifts back towards the sound we expect. The introduction of the thudding drums and louder tone of Carrabba’s voice paired with the lyrics detailing ‘a series of battle scars’ makes it feel like an attempt at surviving rather than nostalgic poignancy.\n\nThe rest of the album shifts between these two feelings, yet it ends with a track sharing the name of the album, ‘All The Truth That I Can Tell’. It feels intentional that it ends with that his voice seems slightly louder than the acoustic melody, the lyrics appear to document his experience existing backstage ‘Back here I sing it too/And when they're done/I strum some chords.’, before he then enters the light of the stage, ‘I take the stage and I/ Collapse in fractured rhyme/ Surrounded by a crowd of friends.’\n\nAcoustic albums are not for everyone and Dashboard Confessional would have known that. To open and end an album so different from his discography with this knowledge and with such emotional vulnerability is what makes All The Truth That I Can Tell one of his best works and a true act of complete bravery."
