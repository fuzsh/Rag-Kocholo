        "text": "An all-ages concert this Friday will feature a solo acoustic performance by Dashboard Confessionals frontman Chris Carrabba.\n\nCarrabba had an interest in singing from a young age, and began playing guitar in his teens. He was involved with a variety of bands, including serving as the original vocalist for the indie/emo group Further Seems Forever. While with that group, Carrabba began a solo side project that would become Dashboard Confessionals, releasing the albums ‘The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most’ and ‘So Impossible.’ Later on, others would join the band, and their third release ‘A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar’ reached number 2 on the Billboard charts.\n\nAs the name of the group suggests, the lyrics of Dashboard Confessionals’ music is often of an intimate, soul-bearing nature, and they are given a deep emotional weight by Carrabba’s soaring vocals.\n\nAlso performing that evening are indie-punk group The Front Bottoms and singer Madi Diaz.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWHEN: 7 p.m. Friday\n\nWHERE: Chameleon Club, 223 N. Water St., Lancaster\n\nCOST: $28, $25\n\nINFO: 717-393-7133 or www.chameleonclub.net"
