They won the MTV2 award at 2002's MTV Video Music AwardsShrek 2 and Spider-Man 2. for their song \"Screaming Infidelities\" and appeared on motion picture soundtracks such as\n\nDashboard Confessional was started in 1999, as a side project from Carrabba's venture with Florida rock band Further Seems Forever. The name Dashboard Confessional is derived from one of his songs, \"The Sharp Hint of New Tears,\" which contains the line \"On the way home/This car hears my confessions.\" Contrary to popular belief, the name Dashboard Confessional refers only to Carrabba, as he originally intended it to be only a solo project. Addressing this misunderstanding, he challenged: \"What rulebook says it has to be called your name if you're one guy?\"[1] But Carrabba often brought along friends to play live shows with him, and in 2002 he decided to make the current line-up a permanent one.\n\nThe current line-up includes Carrabba (vocals, guitar), John Lefler (guitar), Scott Shoenbeck (bass), and Mike Marsh (drums). Both John Lefler and Mike Marsh provide background vocals. Violinist Susan Sherouse often performs and records with the group. As of 2006, they have released four EPs and five full-length albums, three of which have been certified gold by the RIAA.\n\nIn May of 2005, Dashboard Confessional entered the studio to record their fifth album with Daniel Lanois. Lanois has co-produced the landmark albums So (Peter Gabriel), The Joshua Tree (U2) and produced Bob Dylan's Grammy award winning masterpiece Time Out of Mind (Album of the Year, 1997). \"Don't Wait\" was the first single released from Dashboard Confessional's latest album Dusk and Summer, which was released on June 27, 2006. The album was leaked on torrent websites on June 14, 2006. Following the release of Dusk and Summer, Dashboard Confessional went on a summer tour of the U.S. with special guests Say Anything and Ben Lee.\n\n(source wikipedia.org)\n\nOh and chris isn't bad either\n\nChris Carrabba-Lead Singer\n\nJohn lefler-Guitar\n\nScott Shoenbeck-bass\n\nand Mike Marsh- drums\n\n(source hollywoodsbest.net and dashboardconfessional.com)"
