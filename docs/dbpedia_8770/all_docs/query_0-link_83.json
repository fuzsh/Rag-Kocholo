        "text": "When it comes to punk, emo, and hardcore, Vagrant Records is one of the most important record labels in existence, having put out dozens of seminal albums within those genres. In celebration of the label's 25th anniversary, they recently launched the Vagrant Records: 25 Years on the Streets podcast, which sees host Matt Pryor of The Get Up Kids having in-depth conversations about the culture with Matt Skiba (Alkaline Trio), Mark Hoppus (Blink-182), Trever Keith (Face to Face), as well as members of Thrice, The Hold Steady, and Manchester Orchestra, to form a holistic picture of the label from fans, friends, and peers.\n\nWe sat down with Pryor and Dashboard Confessional's Chris Carrabba to discuss their upcoming episode of the podcast, what makes Vagrant such an artist-friendly label, and their respective relationships with the \"emo\" label over the years. You can listen to and download Vagrant Records: 25 Years on the Streets here."
