        "text": "As a longtime fan of Dashboard Confessional, and one who isn’t a 16-year-old girl, I’ve heard my share of ignorant comments, often followed by a prolonged groan:\n\n“Dashboard? That’s that whiny tattooed guy, isn’t it? Ugghh.”\n\n“That guy’s such a wimp. Let’s go cry ourselves to sleep. Ugghh.”\n\n“That emo gasbag! Ugghh.”\n\nWhat do all of these comments have in common, aside from being completely half-witted and irrelevant? They all focus on Dashboard’s frontman, Chris Carrabba. When people think of Dashboard Confessional, they picture Chris. With his doe-eyed good looks and fancy tattoo sleeves, Carrabba tends to steal the show—and there’s no question that Dashboard Confessional would be nothing without him. I would submit, however, that Chris’s teen-heart-melting presence tends to overshadow the people behind him—people who definitely deserve some limelight, especially Dashboard’s drummer, Mike Marsh.\n\nSay what you want about Dashboard’s “emo” (whatever that means) roots and Chris Carrabba’s shrill ruminations on relationships. But please, never—NEVER, dear OBR readers—question the skill or professionalism of one of my favorite drummers, Mike Marsh. I would contend he remains one of the most underrated and underappreciated drummers in all of rock music. As a drummer myself, I think I have at least a little prerequisite to tell you how good he is. I apologize in advance if I start “nerding out” about drum stuff that no one understands.\n\nLet us begin with one of the first Dashboard songs I ever heard, “As Lovers Go.” It begins with the drum part, unaccompanied at first by guitars or vocals. As a young, naïve drummer, I was blown away: a jazz-style pattern in this music? More than a simple straight eighth-note beat on the ride cymbal? Don’t even get me started on the ghost notes on the snare or the hi-hat work in the pre-choruses. This stuff was revolutionary to 14-year-old me, and it remains just as impressive now as it was back then.\n\nGo back even further, to the first Dashboard album I ever owned—2001’s The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most. Songs like “Saints and Sailors” and “Again I Go Unnoticed” wouldn’t be nearly as effective without the solid drum tracks bolstering them. In fact, the latter track has a purely acoustic rendering on The Swiss Army Romance album, and it falls miles short of Places’s version, if you ask me. Marsh’s quick drumming in the song drives the track along with energy and muscle.\n\nIn later Dashboard albums—2006’s Dusk and Summer and onward—Marsh has developed a wonderful minimalist style, letting his simple but solid beats and consistently high-quality drum sounds speak for themselves. Take mega-hit “Stolen” as an example; yeah, yeah, it’s a radio pop song, essentially, but I don’t care. Listen to that drum track! The way Marsh rations the bass drum during the verses, and only introduces the hi-hat afterwards, shows an incredible patience and musicality.\n\nThe minimalism continues: Dashboard’s most recent album, Alter the Ending, features Marsh’s tasteful percussion throughout. “Everybody Learns from Disaster” demonstrates Marsh maintaining a simple four-on-the-floor beat with the bass drum while playing some nice hi-hat parts over top of it. If you’re a real geek, check out the snare roll that takes Marsh out of the first chorus into the next verse. The beautiful little maneuver happens at the one-minute mark in the song. Perfection!\n\nAlright, I’ll stop. There are plenty more examples—I could go on and on. If you don’t feel like listening to these songs, all one really needs to do is check out Dashboard’s performance of “Hands Down” on Letterman to see the power and energy Marsh contributes to the band. Ignore Chris’s silly haircut. Why, look, a convenient link!\n\nDon’t dismiss Dashboard’s other members, either—I bet you didn’t know that talented bassist Scott Schoenbeck was a longtime member of legendary 90’s emo group The Promise Ring. Dashboard guitarist John Lefler is irreplaceable, and has a burgeoning solo career to showcase his musical prowess. And of course, our friend Chris deserves plenty of credit for his own guitar and songwriting skills. The point? Keep those silly comments to yourselves, Dashboard hecklers, and give some credit where credit is due! Especially to the talented and underappreciated Mike Marsh.\n\n~ J.M."
