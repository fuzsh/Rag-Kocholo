        "text": "PREVIEW\n\nDashboard Confessional (solo)\n\nWhere: Showbox SoDo, 1700 First Ave. S, Seattle\n\nWhen: 6 p.m. (doors) Sunday; Augustana and John Ralston open\n\nTickets: $24.99 advance, $29 door; ALL AGES\n\nInformation: (206) 628-3151, showboxonline.com\n\nBy Alan Sculley\n\nFor Kitsap A&amp;E\n\nSing-along time is back in full force for Chris Carrabba of Dashboard Confessional.\n\nAfter five years in which he devoted most of his time to plugged-in, full-band shows as the frontman of Dashboard Confessional, Carrabba this fall has returned to the way it all started. He's touring solo acoustic â€“ under, of course, the Dashboard Confessional name he has used since 2000.\n\nThat's when Carrabba emerged from a stint in the punkish band Further Seems Forever (and a job as an elementary school teacher) to tour solo acoustic. As if the solo format wasn't novel enough, Carrabba took the unusual and risky approach of opening mainly for loud and raucous punk bands to try to start building an audience.\n\nBut a funny thing happened. Rather than getting a cold shoulder from fans amped up for some hyper electric rock and roll, Carrabba struck a most resounding chord with his soul-baring songs, which were mostly about romance and the devastation of heartbreak.\n\nBefore long, his shows were being greeted with a crowd singing along to his songs at the top of their lungs. Often, the crowds were so loud, it was hard to hear Carrabba himself.\n\nThis, to say the least, was not the kind of response Carrabba ever expected.\n\n\"It was a shock,\" Carrabba said, looking back on those early shows. \"I mean, there were nights when I was stopped. I mean, there's this thing that happens where I'll stop at certain places in order to let the crowd just ring out. But I only discovered that trick by stopping out of sheer surprise. I was startled and I'd stop playing. They'd continue singing a line and I'd be like 'Oh my God, what's the chord I've got to play next?'\n\n\"What soon became shocking was that it was not unique,\" Carrabba said in a recent phone interview prior to a show in Las Vegas. \"Everywhere I went I was finding this, and I couldn't believe it. And you know, you'd think I wouldn't be surprised by it any more, but they get me every night somehow.\"\n\nAs Carrabba's comments suggest, he's finding on his current solo acoustic tour that little has changed when it comes to crowd participation at his shows. He's not complaining either, and noted that crowds have been plenty vocal, too, when he plays in an electric format with the three musicians (guitarist John Lefler, bassist Scot Schoenbeck and drummer Mike Marsh) who joined him to turn Dashboard Confessional into a full band prior to the 2003 CD, \"A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar.\"\n\nThe new tour coincides with the release of \"The Shade Of Poison Trees,\" a CD that takes Carrabba and Dashboard Confessional back closer to their acoustic roots. It offers a mix of solo and full-band songs, but all built around acoustic instrumentation.\n\nThe more spare setting nicely suits Carrabba's yearning vocals, and with songs like \"Where There's Gold ...\" and \"Keep Watch for The Mines\" (both solo acoustic) and \"Thick As Thieves\" and \"I Light My Own Fires Now\" (with the band) he has written some of his most compelling melodies.\n\nThe tie-in between the solo tour and \"The Shade Of Poison Tress\" CD, though, was not as calculated as it might seem.\n\nIt turns out that the seeds for this acoustic episode were sewn during the process that led to the \"Dusk And Summer\" CD. Before doing the CD with producer Don Gilmore, Carrabba did a recording session with famed producer Daniel Lanois. It was a fairly free-form session that gave Carrabba room to experiment. It was also solo acoustic.\n\n\"I think it was in hindsight an important discovery that he (Lanois) helped lead me to, where I remembered what the source was,\" Carrabba said.\n\nCarrabba said he started thinking about doing an acoustic album while touring with the band to support \"Dusk And Summer.\" But the swiftness in which the project came to life was notable.\n\n\"I got home from that tour around December and I took January kind of off,\" he said. \"February rolled around and I sat around for 10 days and wrote 12 songs, actually one was a carryover, so 11 songs. Then I walked into the studio for 10 more days with my band and my producer (Gilmore) and we just went through the process of recording it, playing it into microphones, not trying to make it anything it wasn't. God, what a breeze.\"\n\nThen Carrabba and his Dashboard bandmates did something really unusual. They set the finished \"The Shade Of Poison Trees\" on the shelf and didn't tell anyone about it. It wasn't until the current solo tour was starting to sneak up on Carrabba that his wheels started turning and he approached his long-time label, Vagrant Records, about releasing the CD.\n\n\"I got to thinking about this tour and it occurred to me, wait a second, I could sing these songs on this tour,\" Carrabba said. \"It's the right place for it. Although there's a band on this record, it does fit the spirit of it.\""
