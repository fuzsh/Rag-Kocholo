        "text": "Taylor Swift has written song after song that would be good to listen to on a first date. She once named her favorite first date song. Notably, the tune is in a style that Swift has never dabbled in herself.\n\nTaylor Swift loves a 1st date song that’s emo\n\nDuring a 2015 interview with Rolling Stone, Swift named some of the songs that inspired her. Her list included Carly Simon’s “You’re So Vain,” a predecessor to her many breakup songs, Faith Hill’s “This Kiss,” a predecessor to her country-pop crossover hits, and Ed Sheeran’s “Lego House,” a predecessor to the folk love songs from her albums Folklore and Evermore. One of the rock songs on the list was “Hands Down” by Dashboard Confessional.\n\n“My high school experience was marked by memories of house-party singalongs of ‘Hands Down’ and driving around with my best friend screaming the words to it,...\n\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Rolling Stone may receive an affiliate commission.\n\nCounting Crows will spend most of their summer on the road with Dashboard Confessional during their 2023 Banshee Season tour.\n\nCounting Crows will stop in 56 cities across North America, with Frank Turner joining as a special guest on select dates, and Dashboard Confessional serving as support for all but seven shows,\n\n“One of the best things about a life in rock and roll is that we spend it traveling the world playing music.\n\nCounting Crows have mapped out a massive 56-date North American tour with special guests Dashboard Confessional and Frank Turner.\n\nThe “Banshee Season Tour” kicks off on June 13th and runs through the end of September, culminating with a finale at Red Rocks Amphitheater in Morrison, Colorado. Check out the complete tour itinerary below.\n\nTickets go on sale Friday, March 17th at 10:00 a.m. local time via Ticketmaster, with a Live Nation pre-sale occurring one day earlier on Thursday, March 16th (use access code Opener).\n\nOnce tickets are on sale, you can also find them at StubHub, where orders are 100% guaranteed through Stubhub’s FanProtect program. Stubhub is a secondary market ticketing platform, and prices may be higher or lower than face value, depending on demand.\n\n“One of the best things about a life in rock and roll is that we spend it traveling the world playing music,” said Counting...\n\nLollapalooza 2022’s penultimate day wrapped-up with headliners Willow and J. Cole. Day Three also included Chicago-bred Lil Durk and South Korean K-pop group Tomorrow x Together, two acts that were recently added to the lineup, rounding out Saturday’s festivities in Chicago’s Grant Park.\n\nAlexander 23 Brings His Music Back Home\n\n“I’m from Chicago,” said Alexander Glantz, who performs as Alexander 23 and has become a go-to industry collaborator. “So this is extra special for me.” Funny, Glantz’s harmlessly generic pop-rock didn’t feel that special. Glantz was...\n\nIn celebration of today’s release of the new Paramore album, After Laughter, we’re paying homage to the beloved music videos that perfectly captured our 2000s angst and went down as legends.\n\nPrepare to bask in the dejection:\n\nParamore: “Misery Business”\n\nWe could never look as good as Hayley Williams with fiery red hair, but we sure could try.\n\nMy Chemical Romance: “I’m Not Okay (I Promise)”\n\nWe lived for the band’s misfit antics in their movie trailer-inspired masterpiece. But what did Gerard Way just want to do?! The suspense haunts us to this day.\n\nTaking Back Sunday...\n\nNo matter how many amazing things she does for the world, Taylor Swift can’t seem to escape Twitter trolls and media morons.\n\nThe 25-year-old “Shake It Off” songstress recently addressed false reports that she and her gal pal Lorde are locked in a fight. Taylor tweeted, “Media, when you say ‘Lorde & Taylor are fighting’-by fighting do you mean ‘FaceTiming constantly from Us to Nz and LOLing at you?’ Thnx bye.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Lorde reinforced the notion that she and Swifty are on great terms, tweeting, “Sisters are doin' it for themselves @taylorswift13.” Over the weekend Taylor helped her high school Bff celebrate her birthday by inviting Chris Carrabba of Dashboard Confessional to come and sing “Hands Down” at her party!\n\nAfter Taylor Swift surprised her Bff Abigail with an intimate birthday sing-along with Dashboard Confessional's Chris Carrabba, we realized how much Swift's lyrics overlapped with Carrabba's. The passionate drama, the bitter revenge, the hopeless romance: Tay and Chris have a lot in common. Imagine Taylor Swift, in middle school, blasting Swiss Army Romance from the passenger seat, later teaching herself the chords to \"Hands Down\" on her acoustic guitar. No wonder her words seem so influenced by those dashboard confessionals. Can you tell the different between Swift- and Carrabba-penned lyrics? ...\n\nGood friends bake cakes for their friends' birthdays. Taylor Swift, on the other hand, commissioned her Bff Abigail's favorite band — well, just the lead singer, Chris Carrabba of Dashboard Confessional — to surprise her at her birthday bash. Face it: Taylor Swift is a really good, really rich friend. (And Chris Carrabba looks truly amazing for having starred in every single one of my middle-school dreams.)...\n\nWhen Taylor Swift's longtime best friend, Abigail, celebrated her 25th birthday, the pop star pulled out all the stops to make it a special night. Both Taylor and Abigail took to Instagram to share sweet videos from the fun party, which included a surprise appearance by Chris Carrabba, the lead singer of Dashboard Confessional - Abigail's favorite band. In the clips, the best friends can be seen belting out the song \"Hands Down\" alongside Chris, with the whole party joining in and singing along. On Instagram, Abigail wrote, \"Dude. Still crying. I died. There's no way. @ChrisCarraba sang me a birthday song.\" She added, \"Thank you @taylorswift & all of my incredible friends & family for making my 25th birthday the most magically memorable night I've ever had.\" Paramore's Hayley Williams and model Lily Aldridge were also at the star-studded bash, and the group sported fun props to snap pictures in a photo booth.\n\nLeah\n\nTonight, we got some incredibly shocking news. It's so painful and awful it's hard to type. See, Leah ... doesn't wear waterproof mascara. Oh, and also, there was that thing where Corey asked her if she cheated on him and she did .... haha whoops. Right before their wedding, she hopped on the bone train to Sex Town with her ex-boyfriend, Robbie.\n\n\"We were fighting really bad and you weren't being affectionate at all. I was drunk ... \" she says, avoiding Corey's sad, crazy eyes. \"Was your ring on your finger, or did you take it off for the night?\" When Leah admits she wore it during her indiscretion, you can hear Corey's heart download a bunch of Dashboard Confessional and then shatter.\n\nLeah doesn't expect him to forgive her again. (She cheated before, too.) \"You deserve someone who can appreciate everything that you do,\" she says, which shouldn't be hard considering...\n\nOur friends at To Write Love On Her Arms, the non-profit organization addressing depression and suicide prevention, have always been known for its ties to the music community. Their latest Heavy and Light event at the House of Blues Orlando on Jan. 7 featured David Bazan, William Fitzsimmons, Chris Carrabba of Dashboard Confessional, Noah and Abby Gunderson of The Courage, and Mariah McManus. The artists joined together for an encore, performing a lovely cover of Bob Dylan’s “I Shall Be Released.” Enjoy. ...\n\nMaturity changes people’s music tastes. Around the tender teenage years, you get the love struck teens who prefer to remain loyal ‘N Sync fans or those who drift the way of Dashboard Confessional. This transition takes place in the 90s, but the same goes for the 21st Century youngins who stick with Bieber and those who move to Daughtry. If you take the darker and at times, more distributed route, the hidden Bieber or ‘N Sync fan within you will still expose itself every so often. You shouldn’t be embarrassed by this disclosure, but if you are well passed the midlife crisis age, maybe you should listen to Selena Gomez...\n\nThe headline of this post might look silly, readers, but it’s fast becoming a seriously existential question for me. That’s because I’m currently playing through Mass Effect 2, possibly the kinkiest videogame since Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball. To an outsider, the Mass Effect series might seem like another space-marine game — galaxy in peril, aliens with funny heads, an endless amount of rocket launcher ammunition. But the genius of the series is the character interaction: You decide every line of dialogue your character speaks. You can even flirt with several members of your crew… and, ultimately, consummate...\n\nCue up the Dashboard Confessional because ladies and gentlemen, we have our first look at Andrew Garfield as your neighbor web-slinger.\n\nHollywood Reporter’s Heat Vision posted the photo and obviously, we can tell that director Marc Webb and his design team decided to take the Spidey suit in a new direction. I think it looks good and it’s designed in such way that it’ll safely distance its self from the Raimi Spider Man trilogy. Also, it seems that Garfield has slimmed down to play Peter Parker. Sure, he could use a sandwich or two or four, but we have to remember Garfield is playing a meek high school student.\n\nOf course, the fine folks over at Tumblr decided to Photoshop the first official image and replace Garfield with fan favorite Donald Glover (“Community”):\n\n(Via This Is The Internet)\n\nIf that wasn’t enough for you, Entertainment...\n\nWe continue our examination of the new business book Practically Radical with author William C. Taylor's discussion of Threadless. How does a clothes company run by the customer manage to exceed expectations?\n\nIn an era of huge dislocations and scarce resources, fewer and fewer companies are in a position to hire lots of new people or devote big budgets to new projects as a way of moving forward. But most companies are surrounded by customers, suppliers, fans, advocates, and interested parties of all kinds who are passionate about what they do, bursting with ideas, and eager to be more involved. Why not invite them to demonstrate their creativity to you, share their best ideas with you, and collaborate to solve your toughest problems or deliver on your most promising opportunities? That's one of the great mind-flips for leaders today: The performance of your organization can draw on talented \"players\" who...\n\nSlowly but sure, Wiz Khalifa places himself among sought-after rappers in the music game. Gaining attention from Hip-Hop community since his first mixtape five years ago, he gradually built strong fans base. In just a year, he was declared Rolling Stone's \"Artist to Watch\", and then moved to win the title of MTV's Hottest Breakthrough Mc of 2010.\n\nNow in the middle of preparing his next studio installment, Khalifa scored big with his lead single \"Black and Yellow\". The Stargate-produced song climbed to No. 5 and 10 on Billboard Hot Rap and R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts respectively. Also, the Gold-certified track rose to No. 11 on Hot 100, marking his highest-charting single.\n\n\"It's going crazy right now, radio and the video's heating it up and I'm just real happy to have that crossover success - it's looking like we're having that crossover success that people were sketchy and didn't know if I was gonna...\n\nAlong with Christmas and New Year's, the new December tradition appears to be the release of a gigantic 3-D science fiction blockbuster. Last year, \"Avatar\" stormed its way into cineplexes, and today (Friday, December 17) sees the release of \"Tron: Legacy,\" a pricey bit of sci-fi escapism that is a spiritual sequel to the 1982 cult classic \"Tron.\" Costing hundreds of millions of dollars and headed up by a first-time director, \"Tron: Legacy\" is a big gamble but has the potential to be especially huge. With a hot cast that includes Garrett Hedlund, Olivia Wilde and Oscar winner Jeff Bridges, \"Tron: Legacy\" has some of the most head-splitting eye candy you'll see on the big screen all year, so that alone should draw plenty of curious people into the warm bosom of their local movie theater in between packing for holiday travel and doing that last-minute Christmas shopping. (Of course, \"Black Swan\" opens wide this week,...\n\nLil Wayne, Motley Crue, Taking Back Sunday and more have a date with the Meadowlands in the summer of 2011. Those artists, plus the Gaslight Anthem, Wiz Khalifa, Bruno Mars, Lmfao, Chiddy Bang, Dashboard Confessional and others are on tap for The Bamboozle music festival, running April 29-May 1 in East Rutherford, N.J. A Day to Remember, Boys Life Girls, New Found Glory, Circa Survive, Streetlight Manifesto and Rx bandits are among the previously announced artists. Additionally, organizers have announced a new DJ stage for the three-day event. This is among the first appearance announcement for Weezy, who spent the majority..."
