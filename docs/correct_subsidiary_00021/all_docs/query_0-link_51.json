        "text": "eferreyra\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nHi, question:\n\nWich of the several clients (latest version) for informix should i use to connect to Informix from .Net (.Net Provider) ?\n\nIs free download ? Have the link ?\n\nI know there is some Informix CSDK (3.70 latest ?) and there is some ibm data packages or something like, etc.\n\nOur production environment has Informix 3.50 CSDK but the installer mess up with 32/64 bits version, and doesnt add well the config sections in the machine.config of the several frameworks 2/4 and in 32/64 bits version of each one, also doesnt integrate in visual studio 2010, in short, after run the installer there is a mess that need manual changes over several places to make it work in Windows 7 64 bits (Dev machines) and Server 2008 64 bits (Prod Servers).\n\nThanks as always.\n\nArt Kagel\n\nunread,\n\nto eferreyra, inform...@iiug.org\n\nThe IBM Data Server Driver for .NET has better support for .NET features and better performance than the one in the Informix CSDK, however, it does not support any Informix specific data types. Also, since it is actually a DRDA protocol driver for DB2 you will have to define a DBSERVERALIAS using the drsoctcp protocol to use with this driver.\n\nThe CSDK driver is preferable is you use any Informix specific data types that DB2 does not support.\n\nTo find the driver and a PDF file describing the differences between the two .NET drivers, go to this link:\n\nhttps://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/preLogin.do?lang=en_US&source=swg-informixfpd\n\nYou will have to login with an IBM ID (you can register there if you don't have one) Click the button for \"IBM Informix Free Product Download\" and then \"Continue\". Fill out the contact form and \"Submit\". Scroll down to the documentation section and look for \"IBM Data Server .NET Provider for Informix Dynamic Server and IBM Informix .NET Provider\" you will see a link to download the document describing the differences between the two drivers and also a programmers guide for the IBM .NET Provider. Further down is the section to download the IBM Data Server Driver.\n\nArt\n\nArt S.
