        "text": "Running Data Platforms Like Products\n\nRunning Data Platforms Like ProductsVMware Tanzu\n\nApplications need data, but the legacy approach of n-tiered application architecture doesn’t solve for today’s challenges. Developers aren’t empowered to build and iterate their code quickly without lengthy review processes from other teams. New data sources cannot be quickly adopted into application development cycles, and developers are not able to control their own requirements when it comes to data platforms. Part of the challenge here is the existing relationship between two groups: developers and DBAs. Developers are trying to go faster, automating build/test/release cycles with CI/CD, and thrive on the autonomy provided by microservices architectures. DBAs are stewards of data protection, governance, and security. Both of these groups are critically important to running data platforms, but many organizations deal with high friction between these teams. As a result, applications get to market more slowly, and it takes longer for customers to see value. What if we changed the orientation between developers and DBAs? What if developers consumed data products from data teams? In this session, Pivotal’s Dormain Drewitz and Solstice’s Mike Koleno will speak about: - Product mindset and how balanced teams can reduce internal friction - Creating data as a product to align with cloud-native application architectures, like microservices and serverless - Getting started bringing lean principles into your data organization - Balancing data usability with data protection, governance, and security Presenter : Dormain Drewitz, Pivotal & Mike Koleno, Solstice\n\nDevops Online Training.pdf\n\nDevops Online Training.pdfSpiritsoftsTraining\n\nPhone:+91 970 442 9989 (WhatsApp Also) Email: info@spiritsofts.com DevOps is a set of practices and methodologies that emphasize collaboration and communication between development and operations teams to enable continuous delivery and faster deployment of software applications.

Speaker: Roy Millard The SWWE Regional Network were very pleased to welcome back to Bristol Roy Millard, of APM’s Assurance Interest Group on 9 July 2024, to talk about project reviews and hopefully answer all your questions. Roy outlined his extensive career and his experience in setting up the APM’s Assurance Specific Interest Group, as they were known then. Using Mentimeter, he asked a number of questions of the audience about their experience of project reviews and what they wanted to know. Roy discussed what a project review was and examined a number of definitions, including APM’s Bok: “Project reviews take place throughout the project life cycle to check the likely or actual achievement of the objectives specified in the project management plan” Why do we do project reviews? Different stakeholders will have different views about this, but usually it is about providing confidence that the project will deliver the expected outputs and benefits, that it is under control. There are many types of project reviews, including peer reviews, internal audit, National Audit Office, IPA, etc. Roy discussed the principles behind the Three Lines of Defence Model:, First line looks at management controls, policies, procedures, Second line at compliance, such as Gate reviews, QA, to check that controls are being followed, and third Line is independent external reviews for the organisations Board, such as Internal Audit or NAO audit. Factors which affect project reviews include the scope, level of independence, customer of the review, team composition and time. Project Audits are a special type of project review. They are generally more independent, formal with clear processes and audit trails, with a greater emphasis on compliance. Project reviews are generally more flexible and informal, but should be evidence based and have some level of independence. Roy looked at 2 examples of where reviews went wrong, London Underground Sub-Surface Upgrade signalling contract, and London’s Garden Bridge. The former had poor 3 lines of defence, no internal audit and weak procurement skills, the latter was a Boris Johnson vanity project with no proper governance due to Johnson’s pressure and interference. Roy discussed the principles of assurance reviews from APM’s Guide to Integrated Assurance (Free to Members), which include: independence, accountability, risk based, and impact, etc Human factors are important in project reviews. The skills and knowledge of the review team, building trust with the project team to avoid defensiveness, body language, and team dynamics, which can only be assessed face to face, active listening, flexibility and objectively.
