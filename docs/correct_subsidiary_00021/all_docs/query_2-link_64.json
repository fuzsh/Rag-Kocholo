        "text": "Importing from IBM Informix using Zoho Databridge\n\nZoho Analytics allows you to import data stored in the IBM Informix database using the Zoho Databridge. You can also automate the import process to synchronize the data from your local /hosted Informix database into Zoho Analytics in a periodic interval. Report loading time will be faster as the data is stored in Zoho Analytics.\n\nYou can either import the data into Zoho Analytics or connect directly with the IBM informix database server.\n\nData Import: Data in the Informix database will be imported and stored in Zoho Analytics. You can setup periodic schedules to fetch the latest data automatically from your Informix database. Report loading time will be faster as the data is stored in Zoho Analytics.\n\nLive Connect: In this mode, data will not be stored in Zoho Analytics. Instead, Zoho Analytics will generate appropriate queries that will connect the required data live from Informix database to Zoho Analytics and show you the report. In this case the loading time will directly depend on the performance of the Informix database. The Live Connect option is exclusively available for all paid plans and trials.\n\nData Import\n\nHow do I install Zoho Databridge?\n\nHow do I import data from the Informix database using Zoho Databridge?\n\nHow long does it take for the data to be imported into Zoho Analytics?\n\nHow can I edit the Import setup?\n\nHow can I schedule import from Informix database?\n\nWill I be notified on import failures?\n\nImport from Informix database that is hosted in the cloud has failed.

Can I import data from the Informix which are hosted in various networks/private cloud?\n\nYes, you can import from various databases that are hosted in different networks by installing multiple Databridges. You need to install various Databridges for each network. To link all the Databridge installations to your account, use the same installation key available in the Download dialog.\n\n12. Will foreign keys defined between my tables in Informix database be linked in Zoho Analytics as well?\n\nYes. In case you have linked two or more tables in your database using foreign keys, they will be linked automatically using a Look-up column in Zoho Analytics as well. You can also create lookup columns manually using the Lookup feature available in Zoho Analytics. Learn more.\n\n13. Can I change the data type of the columns imported in Zoho Analytics?\n\nYes, you can change the data type of the columns imported into Zoho Analytics. However, it is necessary that the data type of your column is compatible with the data type of the column in your Derby database for successful data synchronizations. It is always recommended that you change the data type in both your Derby database as well as your Zoho Analytics Workspace.\n\n14. Can I import tables from the same database into multiple workspaces in Zoho Analytics?\n\nYes, you can import tables from the same database source to multiple workspaces in Zoho Analytics.

How is Live Connect different from Data Import?\n\nTabulated below are the differences between the Data Import feature and the Live Connect feature.\n\nData ImportLive ConnectData in IBM Informix database will be imported and stored in Zoho Analytics.Data from IBM Informix Database will be fetched live using appropriate reporting queries, whenever you create or access a report in Zoho Analytics.Filtered data set can be imported from IBM Informix Database using customized queries.Custom Query feature is not available in IBM Informix Database Live Connect. However, you can create Views in the source database and connect the same with Zoho Analytics.Multiple data sources (apart from IBM Informix Database) can be imported into the same workspace, and they can be blended for reporting & analysis purposes.Cannot import data from any other data source in to the same workspace in which Live Connect from IBM Informix Database is setup.Changes made to the columns such as addition/deletion will be synchronized automatically.Any changes such as column addition/deletion/renaming will not be reflected. You will have to manually map the data using the Sync Design option.\n\nWhen importing multiple tables, the foreign keys defined between the tables in the IBM Informix Database database will not be linked in Zoho Analytics. However, you can manually link the tables in Zoho Analytics using the Lookup column feature.\n\nLookup relationship will be automatically created for tables that are linked via foreign keys in the IBM Informix Database database. You can also manually link the tables in Zoho Analytics using Lookup column feature.Users can create query tables.Users cannot create query tables.Report loading time will be fast as the data is stored in Zoho Analytics.Report loading time directly depends on the server response time and the amount of data in IBM Informix Database.\n\n4. How long does it take for me to visualize my data in Zoho Analytics?\n\nAs there is no data import process involved, the loading time depends upon the amount of data stored in your IBM Informix database, and also the response time of your IBM Informix database.\n\n5. Will the reports/dashboards query hit my database server every time I open it, or can it be cached in Zoho Analytics?\n\n(or) Can I store a cache of my data points in Zoho Analytics to get quick access to my views?\n\nZoho Analytics allows you to create a cache for the reports in your live connect database to reduce the query fetching time.\n\nTo enable cache for your Live Connect workspace, please follow the below steps:\n\nFrom your Workspace Explorer, click the Settings tab from the side menubar.\n\nIn the General - Workspace Settings page that opens, choose Yes for Enable Cache for this Workspace.\n\nIn the Cache Refresh Interval in Minutes field, specify the duration to refresh the report.\n\nClick Save & Close.\n\nA cache for the reports will be created for the Workspace.\n\n6. Can I connect Views created in the IBM Informix database (apart from Tables) to Zoho Analytics?\n\nYes, you can connect with both Views and Tables created in the IBM Informix database to Zoho Analytics.\n\n7. Will foreign keys defined between my tables in the IBM Informix database be linked in Zoho Analytics as well?\n\nYes. In case you have linked two or more tables in your IBM Informix database using foreign keys, they will be linked automatically using a Look-up column in Zoho Analytics as well.\n\nNote: The lookups created/modified in the added (linked with Zoho Analytics) tables will not be reflected in Zoho Analytics (even with Sync Design option). You need to manually create the lookup in Zoho Analytics. However, the lookup information will be created in Zoho Analytics when new tables are linked.\n\n8. I got an alert message, \"This view cannot be accessed due to some changes made in the table\" while accessing my tables/reports in Zoho Analytics. What should I do?\n\nThis alert message will be displayed when Zoho Analytics is not able to access the information from the IBM Informix database. This could be because the tables/columns that you are trying to access in Zoho Analytics are deleted or renamed in the IBM Informix database.\n\nIn this case, we recommend you to remap the table/column. Refer to this presentation to know how to remap a table.\n\n9. What is a Mismatch?\n\nWhen you have created reports in Zoho Analytics over the tables or columns which no longer have a direct mapping in the IBM Informix database, it will be listed as a mismatch.\n\nSo, ensure that the tables/columns in Zoho Analytics workspace and IBM Informix database match. The tables/columns that do not match will be listed in the Mismatch tab of the Local Database Connection Settings page.\n\n10. When do Mismatches occur and how to resolve them?\n\n11. Can I connect new columns added in my IBM Informix database to Zoho Analytics?\n\nYes, you can connect the new columns that are added in your IBM Informix database to Zoho Analytics from the Local Database Connection Settings page.\n\n12. Can I change the data type of the columns in Zoho Analytics?\n\nNo, you cannot change the data type of the columns in Zoho Analytics while using the Live Connect option.\n\n13. Can I create Query Tables over the IBM Informix data?\n\nNo, you will not be able to create Query Tables if you have setup the workspace using the Live Connect option. This is because this option does not fetch and store the data locally in Zoho Analytics. If you wish to create Query Tables, you can create the required query as a view in the data source (IBM Informix database, in this case) and connect the same with Zoho Analytics.\n\n14. What happens when I delete or rename the database in the IBM Informix database?\n\nWhen you delete or rename a database in the IBM Informix database, Zoho Analytics loses connectivity with the IBM Informix database. After that, a warning message as shown below, will be displayed. This error message will also be displayed if there are any connectivity issues, or if your IBM Informix database credentials have expired.\n\n15. How do I remove the Informix Live Connection with Zoho Analytics setup?\n\nYou have to delete the workspace in Zoho Analytics to remove the connection setup. To delete the workspace,\n\nLog in to Zoho Analytics\n\nClick the More Actions icon that appears on mouse hover adjacent to the workspace name that you want to delete.\n\nClick the Delete Workspace option.\n\n16. What are the limitations of using the IBM Informix database Live Connect?\n\nGiven below are a few shortcomings that one might face while using the IBM Informix database Live Connect option."
