        "text": "Most managers are not techies, and will not undersatand numbers. They will\n\nunderstand that the Informix db is so fragile and arcane no-one will try\n\nmodifying it to do what it needs to do, so it remains a huge hog in the water,\n\ndefecating downstream. Moreover, Microsoft (of whom I am no friend) is in a\n\nmuch better poisiton than whoever makes Informix, to develop it to do the\n\nthings that will be needed in the future, and it has been doing those things.\n\nFianlly, it is far easier to find good SQLS DBAs when needed than to find\n\nInformix DBAs, which creates a dangerous vulnerability for your company.\n\nMost likely, for your company -as most - your data are the company jewels,\n\nworthy of protection.\n\nPhil\n\nDate sent: Wed, 01 May 2002 11:39:06 -0400\n\nFrom: “Phillips, Rob via sql-server-l”\n\nWell, we have a Informix server that is our main DB. The lease is up on\n\nthat server this fall and we have been pushing to move off of informix and\n\nonto SQL2000. We have a few SQL2000 server which have been holding data for\n\nour newer applications whereas the informix box holds data for the legacy\n\napps and we have to migrate data between the two different platforms.\n\nManagement is reluctant to switch off of informix because we’ve never had\n\nany problems with it. From the techie standpoint, we don’t have problems\n\nwith it because nobody really knows it well and we are reluctant to make any\n\nchanges to it. Plus it is a huge pain in the but to make changes to it vs\n\nmaking changes to SQL. So we have run some performance tests against the\n\ntwo boxes and found that the SQL box running on a Single P4 processor to be\n\nmuch faster than the Informix box running dual 333mhz RISC chips. (RS6000\n\nrunning AIX)\n\nWe would like to have our own performance numbers, as well as some third\n\nparty performance comparisons, stability, manageability comparisons. And\n\nsome pros and cons of each to show to management so we can hopefully make\n\nthe switch."
