        "text": "Informix is making another global move.\n\nThe Menlo Park, California-based database software maker and Siemens AG today announced they've formed a worldwide business division in Munich intended to help them push into new markets and expand service.\n\nThrough the new division, the companies will work together to develop products and marketing plans targeting telecommunications, government, enterprise resource planning (ERP), and other industries. The new division builds upon the companies' 16-year relationship, which has resulted in 80,000 worldwide installations.\n\nWith the new division, Informix continues riding the wave of its recent comeback, which includes a new business plan and rebounding profits. In October, Informix marked a higher-than-expected third-quarter profit and a 23-percent increase in revenues.\n\nThrough the new unit, teams in the United States, Ireland, and Germany will work together to provide early availability of products. For companies like Informix and Sybase, getting products to market fast is critical to compete with Oracle, Microsoft, and IBM.\n\nThe division's internal business development teams will also identify new customer requirements and both sales organizations' efforts will be coordinated to serve client needs.\n\nInformix's revenue for the third quarter ended September 30 reached $185.2 million, compared to $150.2 million a year ago. In October, the company also reported that its software license revenue grew 24 percent in the most recent quarter compared with the same period last year."
