        "text": "SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) serves as an analytical data engine employed in decision support and business analytics, offering high-level semantic data models for business reports and client applications like Power BI, Excel, Reporting Services reports, and various data visualization tools. When coupled with the CData ADO.NET Provider for IBM Informix, you gain the capability to generate cubes from IBM Informix data, facilitating more profound and efficient data analysis.\n\nIn this article, we will guide you through the process of developing and deploying a multi-dimensional model of IBM Informix data by creating an Analysis Services project in Visual Studio. To proceed, ensure that you have an accessible SSAS instance and have installed the ADO.NET Provider.\n\nCreating a Data Source for IBM Informix\n\nStart by creating a new Analysis Service Multidimensional and Data Mining Project in Visual Studio. Next, create a Data Source for IBM Informix data in the project.\n\nIn the Solution Explorer, right-click Data Source and select New Data Source.\n\nOpt to create a data source based on an existing or new connection and click New.\n\nIn the Connection Manager, select CData ADO.NET Provider for IBM Informix, enter the necessary connection properties, and click Next.\n\nSet the following properties to connect to IBM Informix\n\nServer: Set this to the name of the server running IBM Informix.\n\nPort: Set this to the port the IBM Informix server is listening on.\n\nDatabase: Set this to the name of the IBM Informix database.\n\nUser: Set this to the username of a user allowed to access the database.\n\nPassword: Set this to the password of a user allowed to access the database.\n\nWhen you configure the connection, you may also want to set the Max Rows connection property. This will limit the number of rows returned, which is especially helpful for improving performance when designing reports and visualizations.\n\nSet the impersonation method to Inherit and click Next.\n\nName the data source (CData IBM Informix Source) and click Finish.\n\nCreating a Data Source View\n\nAfter you create the data source, create the data source view.\n\nIn the Solution Explorer, right-click Data Source Views and select New Data Source View.\n\nSelect the data source you just created (CData IBM Informix Source) and click Next.\n\nChoose a foreign key match pattern that matches your underlying data source and click Next.\n\nSelect IBM Informix tables to add to the view and click Next.\n\nName the view and click Finish\n\nBased on the foreign key match scheme, relationships in the underlying data will be automatically detected. You can view (and edit) these relationships by double clicking Data Source View.\n\nNote that adding a secondary data source to the Data Source View is not supported. When working with multiple data sources, SSAS requires both sources to support remote queries via OpenRowset which is unavailable in the ADO.NET Provider.\n\nCreating a Cube for IBM Informix\n\nThe last step before you can process the project and deploy IBM Informix data to SSAS is creating the cubes.\n\nIn the Solution Explorer, right-click Cubes and select New Cube\n\nSelect \"Use existing tables\" and click Next.\n\nSelect the tables that will be used for measure group tables and click Next.\n\nSelect the measures you want to include in the cube and click Next.\n\nSelect the dimensions to be created, based on the available tables, and click Next.\n\nReview all of your selections and click Finish.\n\nProcess the Project\n\nWith the data source, data source view, and cube created, you are ready to deploy the cube to SSAS. To configure the target server and database, right-click the project and select properties. Navigate to deployment and configure the Server and Database properties in the Target section.\n\nAfter configuring the target server and database, right-click the project and select Process. You may need to build and deploy the project as a part of this step. Once the project is built and deployed, click Run in the Process Database wizard."
