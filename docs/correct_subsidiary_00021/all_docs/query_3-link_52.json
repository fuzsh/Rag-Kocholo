        "text": "Copy data from and to IBM Informix using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics\n\nAPPLIES TO: Azure Data Factory Azure Synapse Analytics\n\nThis article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from an IBM Informix data store. It builds on the copy activity overview article that presents a general overview of copy activity.\n\nSupported capabilities\n\nThis Informix connector is supported for the following capabilities:\n\nSupported capabilities IR Copy activity (source/sink) â¡ Lookup activity â¡\n\nâ Azure integration runtime â¡ Self-hosted integration runtime\n\nFor a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks by the copy activity, see the Supported data stores table.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nTo use this Informix connector, you need to:\n\nSet up a Self-hosted Integration Runtime. See Self-hosted Integration Runtime article for details.\n\nDownload the 64-bit Client SDK for Informix to create an ODBC connection for the data store on the Integration Runtime machine. For SDK download and setup, refer this article for details, or contact IBM support team for driver installation guidance.\n\nGetting started\n\nTo perform the Copy activity with a pipeline, you can use one of the following tools or SDKs:\n\nThe Copy Data tool\n\nThe Azure portal\n\nThe .NET SDK\n\nThe Python SDK\n\nAzure PowerShell\n\nThe REST API\n\nThe Azure Resource Manager template\n\nCreate a linked service to Informix using UI\n\nUse the following steps to create a linked service to Informix in the Azure portal UI.\n\nBrowse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:\n\nSearch for Informix and select the Informix connector.\n\nConfigure the service details, test the connection, and create the new linked service.\n\nConnector configuration details\n\nThe following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Informix connector.\n\nLinked service properties\n\nThe following properties are supported for Informix linked service:\n\nProperty Description Required type The type property must be set to: Informix Yes connectionString The ODBC connection string excluding the credential portion. You can specify the connection string or use the system DSN (Data Source Name) you set up on the Integration Runtime machine (you need still specify the credential portion in linked service accordingly).\n\nYou can also put a password in Azure Key Vault and pull the password configuration out of the connection string. Refer to Store credentials in Azure Key Vault with more details. Yes authenticationType Type of authentication used to connect to the Informix data store.\n\nAllowed values are: Basic and Anonymous. Yes userName Specify user name if you are using Basic authentication. No password Specify password for the user account you specified for the userName. Mark this field as a SecureString to store it securely, or reference a secret stored in Azure Key Vault. No credential The access credential portion of the connection string specified in driver-specific property-value format. Mark this field as a SecureString. No connectVia The Integration Runtime to be used to connect to the data store. A Self-hosted Integration Runtime is required as mentioned in Prerequisites. Yes\n\nExample:\n\n{ \"name\": \"InformixLinkedService\", \"properties\": { \"type\": \"Informix\", \"typeProperties\": { \"connectionString\": \"<Informix connection string or DSN>\", \"authenticationType\": \"Basic\", \"userName\": \"<username>\", \"password\": { \"type\": \"SecureString\", \"value\": \"<password>\" } }, \"connectVia\": { \"referenceName\": \"<name of Integration Runtime>\", \"type\": \"IntegrationRuntimeReference\" } } }\n\nDataset properties\n\nFor a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the datasets article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Informix dataset.\n\nTo copy data from Informix, the following properties are supported:\n\nProperty Description Required type The type property of the dataset must be set to: InformixTable Yes tableName Name of the table in the Informix. No for source (if \"query\" in activity source is specified);\n\nYes for sink\n\nExample\n\n{ \"name\": \"InformixDataset\", \"properties\": { \"type\": \"InformixTable\", \"linkedServiceName\": { \"referenceName\": \"<Informix linked service name>\", \"type\": \"LinkedServiceReference\" }, \"typeProperties\": { \"tableName\": \"<table name>\" } } }\n\nCopy activity properties\n\nFor a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the Pipelines article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Informix source.\n\nInformix as source\n\nTo copy data from Informix, the following properties are supported in the copy activity source section:\n\nProperty Description Required type The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: InformixSource Yes query Use the custom query to read data. For example: \"SELECT * FROM MyTable\". No (if \"tableName\" in dataset is specified)\n\nExample:\n\n\"activities\":[ { \"name\": \"CopyFromInformix\", \"type\": \"Copy\", \"inputs\": [ { \"referenceName\": \"<Informix input dataset name>\", \"type\": \"DatasetReference\" } ], \"outputs\": [ { \"referenceName\": \"<output dataset name>\", \"type\": \"DatasetReference\" } ], \"typeProperties\": { \"source\": { \"type\": \"InformixSource\", \"query\": \"SELECT * FROM MyTable\" }, \"sink\": { \"type\": \"<sink type>\" } } } ]\n\nInformix as sink\n\nTo copy data to Informix, the following properties are supported in the copy activity sink section:\n\nProperty Description Required type The type property of the copy activity sink must be set to: InformixSink Yes writeBatchTimeout Wait time for the batch insert operation to complete before it times out.\n\nAllowed values are: timespan. Example: \"00:30:00\" (30 minutes). No writeBatchSize Inserts data into the SQL table when the buffer size reaches writeBatchSize.\n\nAllowed values are: integer (number of rows). No (default is 0 - auto detected) preCopyScript Specify a SQL query for Copy Activity to execute before writing data into data store in each run. You can use this property to clean up the pre-loaded data. No maxConcurrentConnections The upper limit of concurrent connections established to the data store during the activity run. Specify a value only when you want to limit concurrent connections. No\n\nExample:\n\n\"activities\":[ { \"name\": \"CopyToInformix\", \"type\": \"Copy\", \"inputs\": [ { \"referenceName\": \"<input dataset name>\", \"type\": \"DatasetReference\" } ], \"outputs\": [ { \"referenceName\": \"<Informix output dataset name>\", \"type\": \"DatasetReference\" } ], \"typeProperties\": { \"source\": { \"type\": \"<source type>\" }, \"sink\": { \"type\": \"InformixSink\" } } } ]\n\nLookup activity properties\n\nTo learn details about the properties, check Lookup activity."
