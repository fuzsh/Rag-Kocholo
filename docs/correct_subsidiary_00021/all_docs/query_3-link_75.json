        "text": "How Informix can fit Your Database Needs\n\nIBM Systems Magazine Article - Ken Milberg (March 2018)\n\nWhen most people hear that an IBM database is being evaluated, they naturally think of Db2. While that may be a natural reflex of sorts, IBM has expanded its database offerings over the years with Informix, Netezza and Cloudant—the first of which will be discussed in this article.\n\nInformix is perhaps best known best for being used in high transaction OLTP application environments. In recent years it has been enhanced to support the largest of data warehouse workloads. In 2017, IBM and HCL technologies agreed to a 15-year partnership to co-develop and support the product.\n\nWhy use Informix and what does it do for you?\n\nHow has it evolved and what is it today?\n\nRead the complete article on IBM Systems Magazine ...\n\nComparing IBM Informix and Oracle Database for High Availability and Data Replication\n\nITG  International Technology Group\n\nExecutive Brief January 2014\n\nInternational Technology Group (ITG), established in 1983, is an independent research and management consulting firm specializing in information technology (IT) investment strategy, cost/benefit metrics, infrastructure studies, deployment tactics, business alignment and financial analysis.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe capabilities of Informix 12 provide clear-cut value as an alternative to Oracle database and RAC in distributed as well as centralized deployments. They also however have broader implications.\n\nGrowth in conventional data volumes and the emerging world of Big Data are making replication an increasingly critical feature of the IT landscape. At the same time, pressures to accelerate collection, interpretation and delivery of information are placing new stress on database and date warehouse infrastructures.\n\nThese trends make integrated database and replication architecture  which is unique to Informix  increasingly attractive. Organizations may accelerate data management and movement process while minimizing use of server resources and network bandwidth, reducing administrative complexities, maintaining availability and operating transparently across diverse hardware and software bases.\n\nOrganizations with longstanding Oracle commitments may argue that Oracle is their database standard. However, as far as costs are concerned, \"sole source\" procurements seldom represent a best practice in the IT world. Informix 12 offers an opportunity for great cost-effectiveness.\n\nCosts are not the only issue. Legacy data structures leave organizations ill equipped to deal with the challenges of data growth and sophistications, as well as real-time delivery of information. Even where these challenges can be met with new add-ons and overlays, software stacks will grow increasingly complex and inefficient, and costs will escalate.\n\nWhere database infrastructure must meet the challenge of the future, Informix is an obvious candidate.\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nAdvancing Internet of Things Opportunity\n\nIndustry and commerce are entering a new era of computing marked by the expansion of cloud computing, analytics, mobile technologies, and the emergence of the Internet of Things. Evolving beyond just another buzzword, the Internet of Things has become a real structure; billions of connected devices are driving demand for new services, fast development of applications, and real-time access to information.\n\nThe huge influx of data from this sensor-driven world creates opportunities for growth and new revenue streams for businesses that manufacture, distribute, resell, manage, or service physical products. Many organizations are already developing plans and experimenting with solutions to take action based on data from gateways and edge devices.\n\nOrganizations such as IBM are forging new frontiers in this area. IBM® Informix® database software in particular seamlessly harnesses SQL data and NoSQL and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data on a single data management platform. Informix enables organizations to perform real-time analytics using time-stamped and location-based data. The strength of the combined NoSQL and SQL capability, and the ability to embed the database into gateways and edge devices for local analytics, supports informed decision making, provides cost-effective operational efficiency, and encourages innovation. In this way, Informix offers an intelligent, well-suited database for the Internet of Things.\n\nRead more ...\n\nInformix - Internet of Things\n\nHarnessing data captured from the Internet of Things to deliver revolutionary new services\n\nHildebrand is helping a new wave of clients who have tried – and failed – to tackle the big data challenge of sensor data using traditional relational databases. “Informix differs from conventional technology, meaning that we don’t have to queue up large backlogs for analysis, and we can run ad-hoc analysis without reprocessing all the data,” says Josh Cooper, CEO.\n\nThe need\n\nWith intelligent sensors capturing data on every aspect of life, how can businesses process and understand all this data to unlock new insights, exceed customer expectations, and gain competitive edge?\n\nThe solution\n\nThe Hildebrand Smart platform – built on IBM® Informix® and using Hildebrand’s unique machine learning extensions – captures, processes and analyzes big data in real time for actionable insights.\n\nThe benefit\n\nInsight at the speed-of-thought across all data sources unlocks the potential to transform every aspect of daily life, and supports fast development of innovative data-driven web and mobile applications.\n\nHildebrand IOT Data deliver revolutionary new services (2014-04)"
