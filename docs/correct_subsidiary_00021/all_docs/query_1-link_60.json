IBM REM Report PAGE 2 Marketing is about decision making IBM’s low-end server business has been shrinking for a while in 2013. IBM sold the server business to Lenovo for $2.3 bn. The deal covered IBM’s System x, BladeCenter and Flex System blade servers and switches, x86-based Flex integrated systems, NeXtScale and iDataPlex servers and associated software, blade networking and maintenance operations. WHY IBM SOLD IS SERVER BUSINESS? http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2632515 Shrinking Sales in low end server business. Big Blue's new business priorities in its 2015 road map are cloud computing, Smarter Planet, business analytics, and growth markets. Moreover, between 2010 and 2013, the company spent roughly $12 billion in acquisitions, buying mainly software companies in the cloud space.\n\n4. IBM REM Report PAGE 3 International Business Machines has made cloud computing one of the cornerstones of its ongoing transformation. The company has acquired many companies over the past few years in an effort to build out its cloud-computing business, including cloud infrastructure company SoftLayer in 2013 and a slew of cloud-software companies. IBM competes in the infrastructure-as-service market, the platform-as-a-service market, and the software- as-a-service market, and its vast services business helps clients move to and manage cloud infrastructure. IBM During the 1980s and early 1990s, IBM was thrown into turmoil by back-to-back revolutions. The PC revolution placed computers directly in the hands of millions of people. And then, the client/server revolution sought to link all of those PCs (the \"clients\") with larger computers that labored in the background (the \"servers\" that served data and applications to client machines). Both revolutions transformed the way customers viewed, used and bought technology. And both fundamentally rocked IBM. Businesses' purchasing decisions were put in the hands of individuals and departments - not the places where IBM had long-standing customer relationships. Piece-part technologies took precedence over integrated solutions. The focus was on the desktop and personal productivity, not on business applications across the enterprise. By 1993, the company's annual net losses reached a record $8 billion. Cost management and streamlining became a chief concern. And IBM considered splitting its divisions into separate independent businesses. Source https://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/history/decade_1990.html Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. arrived as IBM's chairman and CEO on April 1, 1993. For the first time in the company's history IBM had found a leader from outside its ranks. Gerstner brought with him a customer-oriented sensibility and the strategic-thinking expertise that he had honed through years as a management consultant at McKinsey &Co. Soon after he arrived, he had to take dramatic action to stabilize the company. These steps included rebuilding IBM's product line, continuing to shrink the workforce and making significant cost reductions. Despite mounting pressure to split IBM into separate, independent companies, Gerstner decided to keep the company together. He recognized that one of IBM's enduring strengths was its ability to provide integrated solutions for customers - someone to represent more than piece parts or components. Splitting the company would have destroyed a unique IBM advantage. With the rise of the Internet and network computing the company experienced another dramatic shift in the industry. But this time IBM was better prepared. All the hard work IBM had done to catch up in the client/server field served the company well in the network computing era. Once again, customers were focused on integrated business solutions - a key IBM strength that combined the company's expertise in solutions, services, products and technologies.\n\n5. IBM REM Report PAGE 4 That year, IBM acquired Lotus Development Corp., and the next year acquired Tivoli Systems Inc. Services became the fastest growing segment of the company, with growth at more than 20 percent per year.

IBM REM Report PAGE 7 Customer Segmentation HOW IBM IS TARGETING THE CUSTOMERS:\n\n9. IBM REM Report PAGE 8 Frontrunners are gaining competitive advantage through hybrid cloud and are managing their environment in an integrated, comprehensive fashion for high visibility and control (e.g., through a single dashboard). Challengers are on the journey toward competitive advantage, but haven’t fully achieved unified management of their hybrid cloud environment. Chasers are not yet using hybrid cloud to drive competitive advantage and are in the early stages of gaining integrated control over their hybrid environment. IBM Cloud is designed for the enterprise and is well suited for the emerging hybrid cloud era – an era that is already upon us, with Gartner predicting that nearly half of large enterprises will have hybrid cloud deployments by the end of 2017. By seamlessly marrying a company’s systems of record with new and emerging systems of engagement, IBM is able to help clients mine data as the new natural resource while protecting privacy and security; quickly integrate existing and new services and data to drive new innovations; and easily control, manage and secure where data and apps reside. With SoftLayer as the foundation for IBM’s expansive cloud portfolio, IBM is continuing to collaborate with clients around the world and across industries to deliver new services, enter new markets and create new opportunities for growth. Positioning IBM IS GETTING ITS CLOUD POSITIONING RIGHT - AT LAST! In a recent cloud briefing with Linda Bernardi, IBM Chief Innovation Officer, Cloud & Internet of Things, a newly aligned overall cloud architecture and integrated services offerings emerged. The core building blocks now include: • the fluid integration of legacy and cloud resources through open stack and IBM Hybrid Cloud technology; • an enterprises-focused platform and open ecosystem for cloud data and services; • data analytics offerings, including machine learning; • an end-to-end architecture. Obviously, large enterprises in particular will not base their complete IT infrastructure on public cloud offerings. However, they might deploy SaaS offerings from different vendors besides having their internal IT. Thus, there is strong need for an integration of IT service offerings coming from different sources. Here, IBM's experience and hybrid approach to cloud computing can excel. This also addresses customer requirements for a two-speed IT: stable systems in the backend and agile customer-facing systems. Secondly, with Bluemix IBM has built a strong platform for developers to develop new SaaS apps and applications and deploy them in a cost-effective way on IBM's infrastructure. However, IBM's approach to build an ecosystem goes beyond the pure developer ecosystem. IBM is also engaging in cross-customer integration of business processes, digital transformation and disruptive offerings.\n\n10. IBM REM Report PAGE 9 While IBM remains a solution provider for the enterprise, it wants to encourage its enterprise customers to create and manage business services that can finally address consumers. IBM wants to become the enabler for the orchestration of such ecosystems. This includes the integration of cloud platforms & services, cloud applications as well as on-premise IT from different vendors plus IBM's own assets. With a focus on data analytics, IBM made it clear that it sticks to its core strength: storing, managing and analyzing large amounts of data. Part of this is the emergence of Watson analytics, advanced machine learning and the SyNAPSE project, where it may even develop more advanced analytics technologies. It is very likely that IBM will leave its competitors behind with its engagement in brain-like artificial and semiconductor-instrumented synapse-based computing. Finally, part of IBM's strength is that enterprises need a redefined architecture to address the requirements for systems-of-record data differently than the requirements for systems-of- engagement data. On the one hand, IBM can put its Soft Layer offering for well-managed and cost-effective basic computing resources on the table; and on the other hand, IBM brings in an integrated mix of partner SaaS offerings (based on Blue mix) as well as highly sophisticated data analytics offerings in a hybrid cloud world. Bottom line: Clearly, cloud computing has a disruptive potential for IT technology and IT departments. It took some time to adjust the broad IBM technology and services spectrum to this new IT world. However, focusing on IBM's core strength, this aligned cloud strategy will enable enterprises to benefit from the total customer focus. https://www.pac-online.com/ibm-getting-its-cloud-positioning-right-last IBM B2B Presence in Cloud https://www-01.ibm.com/software/commerce/b2b/b2b-integration/cloud-services/ BM® B2B Cloud Services enable you to connect, collaborate, build, and manage your partner communities.

IBM Products\n\n12. IBM REM Report PAGE 11 Strengths: IBM is a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant reports for CRM services, Digital Marketing Agencies (for IBM Interactive,) Business Intelligence and Multi-Channel Marketing Optimization (for Unica.) Its solutions routinely top the lists for data, technology and e-commerce, so it would be foolish to count it out even if it's catching up on the integration of them. Plus, IBM's huge global reach makes it an extremely viable player in the field. Weaknesses: With its heavy focus on commerce, IBM still has one foot firmly planted on the traditional marketing side, which means it is taking longer to integrate the offerings on the digital side. This means that while it could potentially have the most comprehensive marketing, sales, and commerce solution in a few years, it is currently lagging behind. The other marketing clouds have multi-channel automation at the core of their service, but while IBM has built its hub around Unica it “doesn't address the full breadth of digital engagement,” says Gartner analyst Jake Sorofman.

The new pricing scheme will let application providers who offer their software as a service pay for IBM software, including WebSphere Application Server and IBM DB2, on a monthly basis as they use it Also, IBM has chosen 20 of its most popular products and will let its customers mix and match the use of them in order to meet their monthly revenue commitment. For example, if a customer\n\n14. IBM REM Report PAGE 13 signs up to pay for $10,000 worth of software, the customer can use $7,000 worth of WebSphere and $3,000 worth of DB2, or any other combination that adds up to $10,000 IBM is also offering new financing options for companies that are building clouds, either for enterprises to use internally or for public consumption. Those customers have asked IBM for help spreading out their capital investment payments.

IBM REM Report PAGE 15 IBM – BRAND How did IBM become such a respected voice in its field? To uphold the reputation of a more-than-130-year-old company, it has to produce authoritative content. Because the company is a technical one, it has to ensure that the content is technically authoritative. And because the company is trusted by millions, it has to make sure that the content is at expert level. IBM delivers on all fronts. It’s a huge company, so it has a lot of different blogs.
