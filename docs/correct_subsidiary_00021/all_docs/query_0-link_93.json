Each poilicy has its own rules.\n\nEnhanced:??Lifecycle policy Enhanced provides defect and non-defect product technical support for a minimum of five years from the date the product release was made generally available by IBM.?? Following a product???s announced End of Support date (EOS) there is the option to get support extensions for at least an additional three years for an extra charge set by IBM (enhanced ???5+3??? support).\n\nStandard:??Lifecycle policy Standard provides defect and non-defect product technical support for a minimum of three years from the date the product release was made generally available by IBM.?? Following a product???s announced End of Support date (EOS) there is the option to get support extensions for at least an additional two years for an extra charge set by IBM (Standard ???3+2??? support).\n\nInformix 12.10 (Enterprise, Workgroup, Express) has an \"Enhanced Policy\".\n\nInformix 12.10.xx was released on 2013-03-26 and the end of support date (EOS) has not been annnouced yet. The EOM (End of market) has not been announced yet.\n\nIBM supports at least the last 2 major releases of all of its products and can also support more if it does not decide on an EOS for a particular version.\n\nSo when version 15 comes out, it can decide to do an EOS for version 12.10.\n\nWe advise all of our customers to prepare to migrate to the last version available as soon as possible since the migration cycles can be long (depend on the customers procedures) and need to planified depending on the customers and the way they function.\n\nFor your own information, version 14.10 was released on 2019-03-14 and has the same policy as version 12.10.\n\n-- Cordialement, Regards, Khaled Bentebal Directeur G??n??ral - ConsultiX T??l: 33 (0) 1 39 12 18 00 Mobile: 33 (0) 6 07 78 41 97 Email: khaled.bentebal@consult-ix.fr Site Web: www.consult-ix.fr\n\nHi Amit,\n\nAll of the IBM products have a Product Lifecycle and have a policy type (Standard, Enhanced, etc).
