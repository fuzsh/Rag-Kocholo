        "text": "1985\n\nInformix Corporation launches Informix 4GL. It quickly becomes one of the most popular development languages with VARs and large enterprises in the ‘open systems’ movement of the eighties and nineties.\n\nLate 80’s\n\nThe arrival of client/server computing towards the end of the eighties puts pressure on Informix to enhance the user interface from its alphanumeric foundation to the more friendly and intuitive MS Windows environment.\n\n1998\n\nAfter several abortive attempts, Informix finally signs an agreement in May 1998 with Four Js Development Tools to deliver Business Development Suite – a graphical user interface implementation of Informix 4GL busily gathering momentum in the market place. Business Development Suite with its 99% Informix 4GL compatibility hits an instant chord with users. Informix renames it ‘Informix Dynamic 4GL’ (D4GL) and sells it under this moniker for the next 3 years.\n\n1999\n\nIn early 1999, other databases are added by popular demand.\n\n2001\n\nThis relationship is broadened in December 2001 to a distribution agreement with IBM after their acquisition of Informix in July. Dynamic 4GL is discontinued in favour of Four Js own brand – Business Development Suite.\n\n2003\n\nIn October 2003, Four Js announce the arrival of Genero – its next generation, object-based technology crafted with an XML oriented user interface capable of rendering one business logic faithfully across heterogeneous graphical clients.\n\n2004\n\nIn April 2004, IBM announces the distribution of Genero as its natural successor to Business Development Suite and Dynamic 4GL.\n\n2011\n\nMarch 29, 2011, Four Js and IBM announce an OEM agreement between to create IBM Informix Genero. Four Js and IBM agree to work together on a joint roadmap to ensure that Genero may benefit from the latest features of Informix Dynamic Server.\n\n2015\n\nJuly 9, 2015, Four Js and IBM announce that IBM will provide support for IBM Informix Genero through to September 30, 2016 and new Genero licenses will be available from Four Js from September 1, 2015."
