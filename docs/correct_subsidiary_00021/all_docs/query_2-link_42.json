        "text": "Stelo’s vendor-agnostic data replication and migration technology is a responsive, agile solution that supports IBM Informix, a log-based reader. Informix can handle vast amounts of data, but extracting that data for downstream processing can burden already highly loaded production systems.\n\nStelo is the most resilient, robust, and efficient solution for offloading source data into other applications and can keep up with the high-volume online transaction processing (OLTP) requirements. Easily replicate millions of transactions per hour and transfer data sets over 1TB.\n\nWe can bridge all source and destination types for every user, so you can move data from Informix to anywhere. Stelo is a cost-efficient, low-impact, real-time data replication software for connecting data systems. Experience enterprise power without the enterprise cost.\n\nThe short answer is yes.\n\nStelo takes full advantage of open standards such as DRDA, SQL, ODBC, and JDBC to maximize compatibility and interoperability within an enterprise network. We are an active member of The Open Group software industry consortium, which was responsible for the adoption of DRDA as an industry standard for database interoperability.\n\nCurrently, Stelo supports over thirty ODBC databases and our Kafka interface can also be used to communicate with cloud-based streaming services such as Azure Event Hubs for Kafka, the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Streaming service, Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka, and IBM Event Streams. Stelo can also populate Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLSg2) and similar NoSQL data repositories.\n\nStelo continues to use our open standards approach to ensure that we meet emerging replication requirements. We are continually adding support for new technologies while supporting legacy systems. Stelo is designed to grow with your organization rather than lock you in to any specific database platforms.\n\nIBM Db2 databases can generate large datasets, but Stelo can handle large-scale data replication with sub-second latency. A single instance can support multiple sources and destinations without additional licensing. The Stelo model is independent of the number of cores of either the source or destination—so you only pay for the capacity required to support the transaction volume. This cost-efficient method merges source data flows into one stream, and then it is applied to any number of subscribing destinations. Stelo delivers enterprise-level performance without enterprise-level cost.\n\nYes, Stelo uses only standard IBM i commands and APIs to interact with the journal receiver and will not interfere with other applications. We have numerous customers using Stelo’s software with high availability (HA) products such as Vision Solutions MIMIX, IBM DataMirror, IBM Infosphere CDC, Trader's QUICK-EDD, and MaxAVA HA. The main issue customers have is deciding if they want to use *AFTER only imaging; this decision forces Stelo’s software to be exposed to reorganization."
