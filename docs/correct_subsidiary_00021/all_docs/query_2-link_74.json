        "text": "This SAM application monitor template assesses the performance of an IBM Informix database by retrieving performance data from the built-in System Monitoring Interface (SMI) tables located in the sysmasterdatabase.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nInstall IBM Informix 11.70 on the target server, and install an IBM Informix ODBC driver on the SolarWinds Platform. The driver can be found in the IBM Informix Client SDK on the IBM site. Your database should be accessible by using the olsoctcp protocol.\n\nBy default, all components use the following ODBC connection string:\n\n>Driver={IBM INFORMIX ODBC DRIVER};Host=${IP};Server=ol_informix1170;Service=ol_informix1170;Protocol=olsoctcp;Database=sysmaster;Uid=${USER};Pwd=${PASSWORD};\n\nAdjust this string to suit your environment by updating the Server and Service fields.\n\nCredentials\n\nDatabase user name and password.\n\nMinimum permissions\n\nCreate an OS user (for example: monuser) and add this user into “Informix” group. This is default Informix installation user group. The following highlighted instructions can be found at: http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/idshelp/v115/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.igul.doc%2Fids_in_005x.htm.\n\nCreate the group informix and user informix\n\nTypically the installation application creates these required objects, but you may need to create them before installing. The Mac OS X installation application automatically creates group and user informix in all circumstances, so this task does not apply to Mac computers.\n\nYou need to create the objects before you run the installation application in the following situations:\n\nYou want to specify a particular identifier (ID) number.\n\nThe group informix exists on the system; however, the user informix does not. In this case, you need to create the user only.\n\nIf you plan to install IBM Informix products using RPM Package Manager and user informix and group informix do not exist on the target computer, you must create these objects on the operating system before performing the RPM-based installation.\n\nTo create the group informix and user informix:\n\nCreate the group informix by using the groupadd utility followed by the name of the group, in this format: groupadd n informix\n\nwhere n is an unused identifier (ID) greater than 100. On AIX®, use the mkgroup command instead of groupadd.\n\nCreate the user informix by using the useradd utility followed by the group (informix) and user name (informix) in this format:\n\nuseradd -u n -g informix informix\n\nwhere n is an unused identifier (ID) greater than 100.\n\nOnly add users to the group informix if the users need administrative access to the database server.\n\nCreate a password for user informix by running the passwd utility.\n\nLogin as a DBA (informix user) to “sysmaster” database on your Informix instance (For example: ol_informix1170).\n\nUnder DBA user, create stored procedures described in the “For IBM Informix installed on Linux” section below and grant execute permissions on these procedures to the “monuser” by using the following SQL query: GRANT EXECUTE ON procedure_name TO monuser;\n\nEdit /etc/sqlhosts and /etc/services. This step is described in the “For IBM Informix installed on Linux” below.\n\nCorrect the Server and Service properties in the ODBC connection string. Adjust the “Platform to run polling job on” option as needed.\n\nFor IBM Informix installed on Windows\n\nThe following commands should be executed on the IBM Informix server before using this template. These commands will create all the necessary stored procedures for monitoring your server from SAM:\n\n--Page Reads /sec CREATE PROCEDURE APM_P_READS () RETURNING DECIMAL(8,2); DEFINE x,y,res DECIMAL(8,2); SELECT value INTO x FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'pagreads'; SYSTEM \"timeout 10\"; SELECT value INTO y FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'pagreads'; LET res = (y - x) / 10; RETURN res; END PROCEDURE; --Page Writes /sec CREATE PROCEDURE APM_P_WRITES () RETURNING DECIMAL(8,2); DEFINE x,y,res DECIMAL(8,2); SELECT value INTO x FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'pagwrites'; SYSTEM \"timeout 10\"; SELECT value INTO y FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'pagwrites'; LET res = (y - x) / 10; RETURN res; END PROCEDURE; --Committed Transactions /sec CREATE PROCEDURE APM_TR_COM () RETURNING DECIMAL(8,2); DEFINE x,y,res DECIMAL(8,2); SELECT value INTO x FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'iscommits'; SYSTEM \"timeout 10\"; SELECT value INTO y FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'iscommits'; LET res = (y - x) / 10; RETURN res; END PROCEDURE; --Rolled back Transactions /sec CREATE PROCEDURE APM_TR_ROL () RETURNING DECIMAL(8,2); DEFINE x,y,res DECIMAL(8,2); SELECT value INTO x FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'isrollbacks'; SYSTEM \"timeout 10\"; SELECT value INTO y FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'isrollbacks'; LET res = (y - x) / 10; RETURN res; END PROCEDURE; --Latch Request Waits /sec CREATE PROCEDURE APM_LATCH_WAIT () RETURNING DECIMAL(8,2); DEFINE x,y,res DECIMAL(8,2); SELECT value INTO x FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'latchwts'; SYSTEM \"timeout 10\"; SELECT value INTO y FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'latchwts'; LET res = (y - x) / 10; RETURN res; END PROCEDURE; --Lock Requests /sec CREATE PROCEDURE APM_L_REQ () RETURNING DECIMAL(8,2); DEFINE x,y,res DECIMAL(8,2); SELECT value INTO x FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'lockreqs'; SYSTEM \"timeout 10\"; SELECT value INTO y FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'lockreqs'; LET res = (y - x) / 10; RETURN res; END PROCEDURE; --Lock Waits /sec CREATE PROCEDURE APM_L_WAIT () RETURNING DECIMAL(8,2); DEFINE x,y,res DECIMAL(8,2); SELECT value INTO x FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'lockwts'; SYSTEM \"timeout 10\"; SELECT value INTO y FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'lockwts'; LET res = (y - x) / 10; RETURN res; END PROCEDURE; --Deadlocks /sec CREATE PROCEDURE APM_DEADL () RETURNING DECIMAL(8,2); DEFINE x,y,res DECIMAL(8,2); SELECT value INTO x FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'deadlks'; SYSTEM \"timeout 10\"; SELECT value INTO y FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'deadlks'; LET res = (y - x) / 10; RETURN res; END PROCEDURE; --Sequential Scans /sec CREATE PROCEDURE APM_SEQ_S () RETURNING DECIMAL(8,2); DEFINE x,y,res DECIMAL(8,2); SELECT value INTO x FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'seqscans'; SYSTEM \"timeout 10\"; SELECT value INTO y FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'seqscans'; LET res = (y - x) / 10; RETURN res; END PROCEDURE; --Sorts /sec CREATE PROCEDURE APM_SORTS () RETURNING DECIMAL(8,2); DEFINE x,y,res DECIMAL(8,2); SELECT value INTO x FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'totalsorts'; SYSTEM \"timeout 10\"; SELECT value INTO y FROM sysprofile WHERE name = 'totalsorts'; LET res = (y - x) / 10; RETURN res; END PROCEDURE; --Number of Network Connections /sec CREATE PROCEDURE APM_CONNECT () RETURNING DECIMAL(8,2); DEFINE x,y,res DECIMAL(8,2); SELECT ng_connects INTO x FROM sysnetglobal; SYSTEM \"timeout 10\"; SELECT ng_connects INTO y FROM sysnetglobal; LET res = (y - x) / 10; RETURN res; END PROCEDURE;\n\nOn the IBM Informix server, open the setnet32 utility found in the IBM Informix folder.

The read and write cache rates can vary dramatically depending upon the applications and the type and size of the data being operated on. In general, both the read cache rate and write cache rate should be in the 80 to 90th percentile. If these rates are consistently lower than 80%, you should consider increasing the value of the Buffersparameter in your Informix configuration file to achieve higher read and write cache rates. Low read and write cache rates indicate IDS is doing a lot more disk reads and writes than it should, which will greatly slow down overall database engine performance.\n\nWrite Cache Hit %\n\nThis monitor returns the percentage of write cache rate. The read and write cache rates can vary dramatically depending upon the applications and the type and size of the data being operated on. In general, both the read cache rate and write cache rate should be in the 80 to 90th percentile. If these rates are consistently lower than 80%, you should consider increasing the value of the Buffersparameter in your Informix configuration file to achieve higher read and write cache rates. Low read and write cache rates indicate IDS is doing a lot more disk reads and writes than it should, which will greatly slow down overall database engine performance.\n\nPage Reads /sec\n\nThis monitor returns the number of physical database page reads issued. This value should be as low as possible. Higher values may indicate indexing or memory constraints.\n\nPage Writes /sec\n\nThis monitor returns the number of physical database page writes issued. This value should be as low as possible. Higher values may indicate indexing or memory constraints.\n\nCommitted Transactions/sec\n\nThis monitor returns the number of committed transactions rate, per second.\n\nRolled Back Transactions/sec\n\nThis monitor returns the number of rolled back transactions rate, per second.\n\nLatch Request Waits/sec\n\nA latch was the first method that was used in Informix products to protect shared memory resources from being accessed by multiple users at one time. This monitor returns the number of events, per second, when a thread had to wait for a latch.\n\nBuffer Waits Ratio\n\nThis monitor returns the buffer waits ratio using the following formula: BR = (bufwaits/(pagreads + bufwrits)) * 100.\n\nIf this value is below seven, everything is considered fine. If this value is between seven and ten, you can expect some sluggishness in response times. If this value is greater than ten, it is likely that system responses are very slow.\n\nSuggested resolutions:\n\nIncrease the value of the Buffers parameter if the number of unused buffers is zero, and/or if viewing onstat -P over time, you see a small number of partnums trading large percentages of the buffer cache back and forth.\n\nIncrease the value of the LRUS and Cleaners parameters significantly. (The Cleaners parameter should always be greater than or equal to the value of the LRUSparameter for the best LRU flush performance.\n\nAvoid 32 & 64. A known bug may still remain with Informix that causes very poor LRU contention at those values.\n\nLock Requests/sec\n\nA lock is used to reserve access to a database object. This monitor returns the rate of events, per second, that sessions requested a lock.\n\nLock Waits /sec\n\nA lock is used to reserve access to a database object. This monitor returns the rate of events, per second, when sessions had to wait for a lock.\n\nDeadlocks/sec\n\nA deadlock occurs when two users hold locks and each user wants to acquire a lock that the other user owns. Informix uses the lock table to detect deadlocks automatically and stop them before they occur. This monitor returns the deadlocks rate, per second. This value should be as low as possible.\n\nSequential Scans/sec\n\nThis monitor returns the sequential scans rate, per second. This value should be as low as possible. If the value of this monitor is constantly high and continues to increase, it may indicate some performance problems, especially if your system is in an OLTP environment. You should investigate further to determine the root cause of excessive sequential scans.\n\nSequential access to tables can impact performance since the database engine needs to scan entire tables to pick up rows that satisfy the query's conditions.\n\nIf a table is small (a few hundred rows), the database engine can scan tables that reside in memory. When the next scan occurs, table data can be retrieved directly from memory. However, if the tables are large (over 100,000 rows), sequential scans may negatively impact performance.\n\nFor tables with a large number of sequential scans, it is recommended to add indexes to thr table or use program directives to force the internal query optimizer to choose indexes for accessing data in this table, rather than sequential scans.\n\nSorts/sec\n\nThis monitor returns the sorts rate, per second.\n\nNumber of Databases\n\nThis monitor returns the number of databases presented in this instance.\n\nNumber of DBspaces\n\nThis monitor returns the number of database spaces presented in this instance.\n\nNumber of Network Connections/sec\n\nThis monitor returns the cutwork connections rate, per second.\n\nLocks Overflow\n\nThis monitor returns the number of times IDS attempted to exceed the maximum number of locks. If this number is non-zero, you may need to increase the value of the Locksparameter in the configuration file.\n\nDatadbs available space (MB)\n\nThis monitor returns the available space, in MB, for database space - datadbs. This value should be as high as possible. You can change which dbspace to monitor by correcting the name in this line of your SQL query: and name = 'datadbs'"
