        "text": "I/O: Input/output. Refers to the transmission of data into or out of a processor’s memory. This would include communication lines and peripherals such as disk drives. This would not include internal transfers within the processor, such as from one level of cache to another, or the loading of instructions from memory into the processor for execution.\n\ni486: Better known as the 486.\n\nIAA: Insurance Application Architecture. An architecture designed by IBM in conjunction with some major European insurance companies. Defines application specific features (data models, function models, communications interface, etc) for the European insurance industry.\n\nIAB: Internet Architecture Board. The technical group that provides high-level guidance to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).\n\nIAD: See Internet Addiction Disorder.\n\nIAF: See Item Access Facility.\n\nIAFC: See Item Access Facility.\n\nIAG: IBM Application Generator. Once rumored as the new name for CSP1. In fact, CSP was replaced by VisualAge Generator.\n\nIAX: Image processing software.\n\nIBA: Integrated Banking Applications. Applications software from Hogan Systems to which IBM had exclusive marketing rights. Early 1994 the rights were transferred back to Hogan.\n\nIBF: See Internal Battery Feature.\n\nIBM: International Business Machines.\n\nIBM/COMPLETE: Short-lived IBM packaging of hardware, software, and services (introduced in February 1993) which aimed to provide a solution to a specific problem. The novelty was in the pricing; the customer and IBM sat down and worked out the anticipated business benefit in cash terms. The customer didn’t pay for the products in the package – the price was based on the business benefit, and the customer paid only when that benefit was delivered. First offerings were storage and batch window management.\n\nIBM_Planetwide: Name of the Web search robot IBM used to use to build search engines, back in the days when it was in that business.\n\nIBM COBOL: The current mainframe COBOL compilers. IBM COBOL for VSE/ESA has remained constant in name, but IBM COBOL for MVS and VM keeps getting a new name as the operating systems get new names. IBM COBOL for z/OS & z/VM being the current incarnation.\n\nIBM Firewall: Renamed to SecureWay Firewall.\n\nIBMLink: An on-line service for customers that was built around product-related information systems previously used solely by IBM staff. Justified within IBM, and even offered free in some countries, as a way to reduce the time spent by IBM staff answering customer marketing and technical questions. And often the justification within organizations for getting a communications link to IBM. Key areas included a complete set of announcement letters (going as far back as 1983), education and publications catalog, and a software service database, including both bug reports and general technical Q&A. Hardware and software configurators were also added over the years. In some countries, it could also be used as an e-mail system, both to/from IBM and, if you knew how, with other customers. Unveiled in the late 1980s as a z/VM3270-based system, gradually converted to a Web-based system in the late 1990s. Then, at the turn of the century, things got confusing for a short time. ibmlink.com was suddenly occupied by some weird Yahoo! style portal with very little content, succeeding solely in confusing people looking for the real IBMLink (at ibmlink.ibm.com). Thankfully, it suffered an early death.\n\nIBM Payment: See Payment.\n\nIBM PC: See PC.\n\nIBS/MIGRATOR: Source code translator from z/OS and VSE/ESA COBOL, CICS, batch, JCL and SQL to the iSeries 400. There is also a subset called IBS/MIGRATOR-JCL. From IBS Conversions, Inc. Announced February 1993, but IBM stopped marketing it May 1996.\n\nIBSDM: Integrated Business System Development Method. IBM development methodology (also known as SDM). Was available in the obsolete Developmate product.\n\nIBU: Independent Business Unit. IBMspeak for a small unit within an organization that acts as an autonomous unit.\n\nIC/1: Info Center/1. APL system providing an Information Center environment. Incorporates ADRS II, APLDI II, FPS II. Replaced September 1990 by the IC/E (Info Center/Enhanced) feature of AS1. Version 4.2 was supposed to be the last release of AS to include IC/E. Instead, it was IBM’s last release of the product. It was sold to ASTRAC in 1999, who seems committed to long term IC/E (or ICE as they like to call it) support and enhancement.\n\nIC/E: Info Center/Enhanced. See IC/1.\n\nIC1: Industrial Computer.\n\nIC2: See Information Center.\n\nIC-3: Internal Coupling Channel.\n\nIC4: See Internal Channel link.\n\nIC5: Integrated Circuit. A circuit board on a chip. IBM was arguably the first computer company in the world to use ICs, on the System/360 CPU. Only a few transistors and associated components, but it was a first.\n\nICA: Integrated Communication Adapter. A communication adapter that is integrated into a host processor. Very appealing when it was first introduced in small mainframes like the 4331, as it meant external communications was suddenly very affordable because you did not have to buy an FEP. Severely limited, in terms of number of ports, and could not be expanded, forcing the purchase of an FEP.\n\nI-CASE: Integrated CASE1.\n\nICB1: See Inventory Control Block.\n\nICB2: See Integrated Cluster Bus link.\n\nICB-3: Internal Cluster Bus-3. See also Integrated Cluster Bus link.\n\nICC: IBM Credit Corporation. For many years, IBM’s in-house leasing operation. Closely allied to IBM sales and marketing operations, and was able to offer highly competitive services – flexible leases, bundled services, discounts, etc. Renamed IBM Global Financing.\n\nICCF: Interactive Computing and Control Facility. VSE’s interactive facility. An ISPF/PDF wannabe. Little-liked; most VSE users preferred to use z/VM’s CMS1 despite the fact that CMS may require them to install z/VM.\n\nICE1: Interconnect Communication Element. Originally introduced on top-end ES/9000s, the part of the CEC which controls data movement between expanded storage, the channel subsystem, and the SCE – the big thick pipe into the heart of the machine. With the initial releases of the ES/9000 it was little more than a very fast switch which takes over some of the SCE’s work, and provided increased parallelism and contention relief.\n\nICE2: Info Center/Enhanced as ASTRAC likes to abbreviate it. See IC/1.\n\nIceberg: Long rumored and much-hyped DASD subsystem from Storage Technology Corp, consisting of an array of up to 64 disks, complete with its own controller. To the mainframe, Iceberg looks like a 3990 controller. Formal announcement was in January 1992, but shipment dates kept slipping, and the first customer beta site went live mid 1993. Volume shipments started at the beginning of 1994. As from June 1996 IBM took over marketing of Iceberg under the soubriquet RAMAC Virtual Array Storage.\n\nICETOOL: Utility included with DFSORT and introduced March 1991. Provides existing DFSORT functionality in an easier statement format, along with new capabilities. One operation in ICETOOL replaces several in standard DFSORT.\n\nICF1: Inter-systems Communications Function. Software on the iSeries 400 providing support for user communications programs. Supports LU6.2, SNA Upline to CICS/IMS1, BSC, async. Key to the use of iSeries 400 in a network.\n\nICF2: Integrated Catalog Facility. Replaced the CVOL and VSAMcatalogs as the standard z/OS place to store attributes of data sets. It has not, however, replaced the VTOC. Part of DFSMSdfp.\n\nICF3: Integrity Control Facility. See DBICF, DB2ICF.\n\nICF4: See Integrated Cryptographic Feature.\n\nICF5: Interactive CATIA Facility.\n\nICHEINTY: A macro1 providing a direct interface to the RACF database, to locate or update a profile.\n\nICHRIN03: The RACF started procedures table.\n\nICKDSF: Device Support Facility. Free IBM utility program for z/OS, z/VM and VSE/ESA, used for formatting DASD and for other media maintenance processing. Like EREP, ordering varies by operating system. DSF is an element of z/OS, but is a separately licensed product for z/VM.\n\nICMF: Integrated Coupling Migration Facility link. One of five types of CF channels to connect a CF to an LPAR.\n\nICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol. The protocol used to provide reports of problems and incorrect datagram destinations in the Internet Protocol (IP1) layer.\n\nIcon1: A symbol or representation. Anything or anybody uncritically admired according to the dictionary. Usually used with the first meaning to refer to the symbols used in the user interfaces for PCs in which little pictures are used in preference to words (e.g., a picture of a folder is used to represent a subdirectory). There is little benefit to the user in this approach since the pictures are usually completely unfathomable; however, the vendor benefits, because it provides an excuse for not publishing local language versions of software, which would be necessary if words rather than icons were used.\n\nIcon2: A public domain multi-platform programming language written and supported at the University of Arizona by Ralph Griswold, based on his experience as prime author of the SNOBOL series of languages at Bell Labs. The compiler, interpreter and run-time system are all written in C, and the language syntax is based on the C language. But there the similarity ends, as what can take years to write in C can often be done in a week in Icon. Since development of the language is done on Unix, new releases appear there first, but a group of dedicated followers quickly port each new release to their favorite platform. Unfortunately, the z/OS implementer is no longer given the time by his vendor employer, so the z/OS implementation, complete with ISPF services, has not been updated for some years, but still works nicely, though is not currently available.\n\nICP: Interconnect Controller Program. The software that runs (on) the 3172 Interconnect Controller.\n\nICPF: ImagePlus Capture Facility/2. LAN-based client/server extension to ImagePlus for high-volume document capture and indexing. Withdrawn September 1997.\n\nICPI: Individual Computer Products International. Company set up by IBM Europe in June 1992, as a fully-owned subsidiary to sell the Ambra AT clones. ICPI didn’t use the IBM name for its products, on its letterhead, or in its marketing – a strange approach, since the only worthwhile selling feature of the ho-hum range of products was that it was sold by an IBM company. To no-one’s great surprise – apart from IBM’s – ICPI went belly-up in February 1994. Ambra fared little better, and was gone worldwide by July 1994.\n\nICRF: See Integrated CRyptographic Feature.\n\nICS: IBM Cabling System. See Cabling System.\n\nICSF: Integrated Cryptographic Service Facility. Software used to drive the Integrated Cryptographic Feature. Part of z/OS.\n\nICSS: IBM Continuous Speech Series. See VTAF.\n\nICU1: Interactive Chart Utility. The dialog (user) interface to part of GDDM.\n\nICU2: International Components for Unicode. Option 39 of OS/400. A C and C++ library providing Unicode support and internationalization utilities for writing global applications in ILE programming languages.\n\nIDAPI: Integrated Database Application Programming Interface. API developed by Borland and IBM to help coordinate communication between databases.\n\nIDCAMS: Access Method Services. Multi-purpose batch VSAM utility program under z/OS and VSE/ESA. Most IDCAMS statements are also TSO commands, though the abbreviation rules vary slightly.\n\nIDDU: Interactive Data Definition Utility. System/36 facility carried across to the iSeries 400.\n\nIDE: Integrated Drive Electronics. An interface standard that has remained extremely popular for hard disk drives on workstations, despite competition, most notably from SCSI. Internal CD-ROM and CD-RW drives also use it. Technically, current technology is EIDE, but most people still call it IDE.\n\nIDL: Interface Definition Language. A formal language designed for specifying object interfaces and parameters in a language-neutral format. Various different IDLs exist; COM, CORBA, and RPC all have their own. CORBA IDL has been accepted as an international standard by ISO.\n\nIDLC: Integrated Data Link Control. IBM’s implementation of the ITU-T Q.922 standard or link access procedure extended. It is a full duplex high-level data link control protocol. IDLC can support point-to-point workstation connections over a full duplexWAN.\n\nIDNX: Integrated Digital Network Exchange. The 973x family of network management workstations cum multiplexers, based on PS/2, and produced by IBM in conjunction with Network Equipment Technologies Inc. Main use is for bandwidth management of T1 lines and other wide-area backbone networks. Withdrawn December 1997.\n\nIDP: Interchange Document Profile. Effectively the DIAheader containing details of the document (author, subject, data, addressee, etc).\n\nIDRC: Improved Data Recording Capability. IBMspeak for the enhancements to the 3480 (July 1989) which increased capacity up to fivefold and tape subsystem performance by up to 70%. Works by compressing the data in the tape control unit before writing it to the cartridge, and decompressing it when it’s read back by the program. This technique has the advantage over traditional software compression of not using CPU cycles for the compression. However, it has the disadvantage of transferring the uncompressed data across the channel, which quite possibly uses as many CPU cycles as would software compression. IDRC is standard on the 3490 and late 3480s, and is available as an upgrade on old 3480s. Not available for Magstar.\n\nIDS: Intrusion Detection System. Both a generic term and product name for several security products that detect, prevent and react to unauthorized network activity, especially from hackers. For example, IDS is the new name for Cisco NetRanger.\n\nIDS1: Image Distribution System. A defunct product for linking 8815 Scanmasters via a mainframe. As obsolete as the Scanmaster itself.\n\nIDS2: See Intelligent Decision Server.\n\nIDTF: Interactive Display Text Facility. Obsolete software which enabled use of the 8775 display in conjunction with the obsolete DPCX/8100 and DOSF.\n\nIDU: Interactive Database Utilities. System/38 facility. Incorporates SEU, SDA, DFU. Obsolete, though the utilities themselves (DFU, etc.) are now a part of ADTS in iSeries 400.\n\nIE1: Microsoft Internet Explorer. Free Web browser. Widely used.\n\nIE2: Information Exchange. Store and retrieve EDI mailbox service provided on the IBM INS network. Supports ANSI and EDIFACT EDI standards. Obsolete.\n\nIEBCOMPR: z/OS Compare Datasets utility does a logical compare of datasets. Replaced by SuperC in ISPF/PDF.\n\nIEBCOPY: z/OS Library Copy utility for copying members of a partitioned dataset (PDS), unloading a PDS into a sequential dataset and back again. Unloading is especially useful for copying a PDS to tape.\n\nIEBGENER: z/OS Sequential Copy/Generate Dataset utility. Replaced by ICEGENER in DFSORT and several non-IBM products. In fact, about the slowest way to copy anything anywhere.\n\nIEBPTPCH: z/OS Print-Punch utility for producing a hard copy of datasets and library members. Replaced by ISPF/PDF’s hard copy capabilities.\n\nIEBUPDTE: z/OS Update Dataset utility. Can only be used for PDS members and sequential datasets with fixed length records no greater than 80 bytes in length. The ISPF/PDF Editor is on-line and much more flexible, so IEBUPDATE is rarely seen in anything written in the last 20 years.\n\nIEC: International Electrotechnical Commission. International standards body.\n\nI-EDI: Interactive-EDI.\n\nIEEE: Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers. American professional body with substantial impact on standards for communications. IEEE’s 802 committee has set standards for LANs which include IBM’s token passing scheme and the Ethernet-like CSMA/CD system. See 802.1/2, 802.3, 802.4, 802.5, 802.3z.\n\nIEFBR14: The z/OS Do Nothing utility. Believe it or not, today it is the most popular of all the original IBM utilities. And it is much more complex than most people will lead you to believe. More than just a one line Assembler program that branches to the return address passed it by z/OS in register (GPR) 14, it also, wait for it, clears register 15 to set a zero return code. And hear, all these years, you had been told it was so simple, just one line of code. All kidding aside, it is quite useful, most frequently to write JCLDD2 statements to preallocate or delete a file or something similar, unrelated to the running of any program. Since the basis of JCL is a job step, which requires an EXEC statement, IEFBR14 is the perfect thing to execute: a program that does nothing. It can also be useful when testing DD statements when you do not wish to run the program they will be used for. You have to wonder if the author of IEFBR14 gets a monthly royalty cheque based on frequency of use.\n\nIEHDASDR: Obsolete z/OS dump/restore package superseded by DFSMSdss.\n\nIEHLIST: z/OS List System Data utility for listing a VTOC or the directory of a PDS1. ISPF/PDF is more widely used for this purpose nowadays.\n\nIEHMOVE: z/OS Move System Data utility for moving or copying logical collections of operating system data. Replaced by DFSMSdss. Can be downright dangerous in an SMS1-managed environment.\n\nIER: Internal/Instruction Execution Rate. A measure of computer performance based on the time taken to perform a single machine operation. Not a great deal of use except for comparing two processors with identical repertoires of machine instructions.\n\nIERS: IBM Security Services Internet Emergency Response Service. March 2001, It became the Managed Security Services group within IBM Business Continuity and Recovery Services.\n\nIESG: Internet Engineering Steering Group. The executive committee of the IETF, which oversees the work of the individual IETF working groups.\n\nIETF: Internet Engineering Task Force. An open community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers concerned with the evolution of the Internet architecture and the smooth operation of the Internet. It controls the Request for Comment (RFC) process which can lead to Internet standards.\n\nIFL: See Integrated Facility for Linux.\n\nI format: Information format. A format used for information transfer.\n\nIFP: IMS FastPath1.\n\nI frame: Information frame. A frame in I format used for numbered information transfer.\n\nIFS1: Interactive File Sharing. Obsolete system that allowed a few VSAM files to be shared under z/VM.\n\nIFS2: Installable File System. The part of OS/2 which manages the file management system (e.g., HPFS).\n\nIFS3: Integrated File System. Feature on the iSeries 400, first announced in June 1995, which allows data structures other than native iSeries 400 ones (e.g., PC files) to be stored in a consistent fashion on the iSeries 400.\n\nIGES: Initial Graphics Exchange Specification. NIST standard for transferring engineering data between CAD/CAM systems. Available for AIX, SGI IRIX, SunOS and Windows NT. Withdrawn from z/OS and z/VM August 1997.\n\nIHF: Image Handling Facility. Utility for handling images to be incorporated into compound documents. Runs in z/VM CMS and z/OS TSO environments. Withdrawn July 1995.\n\nIHMP: IBM Hub Management Program. For managing a small LAN of 8250 hubs. Available for AIX, PC-DOS workstations and for Windows as the Intelligent Hub Manager for Windows. The PC-DOS implementation was announced February 1994 and replaced August 1995 by Nways Manager for Windows. IHMP/6000 is the IBM AIX NetView Hub Management Program/6000. Announced May 1994 and replaced April 1995 by Intelligent Hub Manager for AIX. See Intelligent Hub Manager for information on the Windows version of IHMP, as well as the replacement for IHMP/6000.\n\nIIA: Information Interchange Architecture. An architecture (announced mid 1990) supporting advanced functions for IBM office products. Part of SAA. It’s a functional superset of ODA incorporating SGML, MO:DCA, GOCA, IOCA and FOCA. Announced March 1990.\n\nIIN: IBM Information Network. See IN.\n\nIIOP: Internet Inter-ORB Protocol. A OMG standard for CORBA-based object internetworking across IP-based networks that is supported by all compliant ORBs. IIOP is the TCP/IP implementation of GIOP; ORBs using IIOP and IORs are able to interoperate. RMI can now operate on top of IIOP as well as JRMP, allowing RMI and CORBA to interoperate. IIOP is also required by EJB. IIOP is supported by z/OSCICS TS, AIX1, TPF, WebSphere Application Server and ENOVIA.\n\nIIS1: Microsoft Internet Information Services. It runs the Web applications on a Web site. Beginning with Windows 2000 Server, IIS is no longer a separate product, but a part of the Windows Server operating systems.\n\nIIS2: Interactive Instruction System. An obsolete IBM CBT mainframe product; replaced by CBT products running on personal computers.\n\nIISR: Integrated Information Storage and Retrieval. z/OS and z/VM software (announced July 1991) for managing and archiving information from multiple sources. Data is system independent, may be of any type (text, image, etc), and is stored in the format in which it was created in the CDF repository. IISR supports indexing, storage, and retrieval. Withdrawn September 1993.\n\nIKE: Internet Key Exchange. Infrastructure that permits encryption keys to be automatically and securely created, distributed, and refreshed according to the protocol requirements of IPSec. Used to provide VPN support in AIX1.\n\nIKJEFT01: TSO/E terminal monitor program. Can be used to invoke TSO commands in batch jobs.\n\niKP: Internet Keyed Payment. A family of secure payment protocols that enable secure credit card payments over the Internet. The work on iKP led to the development of SET.\n\nILC: Initial License Charge. A charge made when a product is first licensed. IBM abandoned the practice when it realized that ILCs are a major disincentive to the acquisition of a product.\n\nILE: Integrated Language Environment. Programming architecture cum paradigm for the iSeries 400. Introduced in April 1993 primarily as a way of providing decent C support (the first AS/400 C compiler worked by emulating an RPG program). Subsequently, ILEs have been added for C++, RPG, COBOL, and CL/400.\n\nILM: IBM License Manager\n\nILM Management Tool: IBM License Manager Management Tool. Used on z/OS to change license certificate values, enable/disable priced optional features, discontinue products, change the serial number or model type of the machine to which a product is licensed, and increase/decrease a defined capacity (the portion of the machine on which you want to run a product).\n\nIM: See Instant Messaging, or Intelligent Miner.\n\nIMA: Inventory Maintenance Assistance. AS/400 utility which maintains details of the system configuration in order to facilitate the ordering and installation of new hardware and software from IBM. Obsolete.\n\nImagEdit: PC-DOS and early Windows (pre-3.0) program for processing images. Withdrawn March 1991.\n\nImagePlus: IBM Content Manager ImagePlus for z/OS (CMIP) and Content Manager ImagePlus Workstation Program (IWPM). High volume document imaging and folder management middleware, integrated with MQSeries Workflow and Content Manager OnDemand. Includes a Folder Application Facility (FAF), Object Distribution Manager (IODM) and APIs for integration with CICS, IMS, Windows and OS/2 applications. z/OS Object Access Method (OAM) manages the storage of images. It even recognizes hand printing via OCR. IWPM provides the Windows and OS/2 desktop component for both CMIP and Content Manager for iSeries 400.\n\nImage processing: See Transaction image processing, ImagePlus, ImagEdit, ImageSystem.\n\nImageSystem: Transaction image processing system developed by Image Business Systems (IBS) and sold by IBM. Comprises PC RT or RS/6000 acting as a server on a TRN, and PCs as workstations. The Sybase RDBMS is a pre-requisite on the server. Obsolete.\n\nIMAP: Internet Mail Access Protocol.\n\nIMD: Interactive Map Definition. Obsolete DPPX product used to define screen and printer layouts.\n\nIML: Initial Microcode (sometimes Machine) Load. The first step in starting up a mainframe, during which the firmware is automatically copied into the machine.\n\nIMLC: Indexed Monthly License Charge. IBM software pricing based on number of MSUs. See also MLC, GMLC, FMLC.\n\nIMLG: IBM Mail LAN Gateway/2.\n\nImpactwriter: See 6252.\n\nIMPL: Initial MicroProgram Load. Same as IML.\n\nIMS/AO: See IMS Automation Option.\n\nIMS/DB: See IMS DB.\n\nIMS/DC: Original name for IMS TM.\n\nIMS/ESA: Information Management System/Extended System Architecture. Renamed to simply IMS.\n\nIMS/ETO: See ETO.\n\nIMS/Fastpath: See FastPath1.\n\nIMS/FF: IMS Full Function.\n\nIMS/TM: See IMS TM.\n\nIMS/VS: Information Management System/Virtual Storage. Renamed first to IMS/ESA, then simply IMS1.\n\nIMS1: Information Management System. Composed of two systems: a Database Manager (IMS DB) and a Transaction Manager (IMS TM).\n\nIMS2: Internet Management Specification. A standard for managing Internet applications which SunSoft and IBM’s Tivoli started to draw up early 1996. IMS defines a standard interface for configuring, monitoring, and controlling access to the Internet.\n\nIMSADF II: Information Management System Application Development Facility Two. Announced November 1977, an application generator for applications that use IMS DB and IMS TM. Just because no one has written a new application with it lately does not mean that the need for IMSADF II has disappeared. Y2K focused attention on it, selling a lot of copies IBM IMS/ESA ADF Tool Pak for MVS, announced September 1996, and withdrawn September 2001. But many organizations also used Y2K as an excuse to rid themselves of IMSADF II completely.\n\nIMSAO: See IMS Automation Option.\n\nIMSASAP II: Information Management System Monitor Summary and Systems Analysis Program Two. Performance analysis and tuning aid for IMS DB and IMS TM. Replaced by IMS Performance Analyzer November 1997.\n\nIMS Automation Option: z/OSNetView application, announced August 1991, which controls multiple local or remote IMS TM regions from a single point. Can be used to automate such functions as start-up, shut-down, and recovery. Replaced by AOC/MVS IMS Auto Feature.\n\nIMS Client Server: Windows and OS/2 software which provides a client graphical user interface to IMS applications from an OS/2 or Windows workstation. Announced as an OS/2 product September 1991, with Windows support announced in October 1993 and VisualAge in July 1994. When first announced, the product was known as IMS Client Server/2, then renamed IBM IMS Client Server for Windows, despite the fact it still supported OS/2. See also IMS CS Toolkit.\n\nIMS COMPRESS: See IMS COMPRESSION.\n\nIMS COMPRESSION: Implementation of eserver zSeries 900 hardware data compression to support IMS DB databases. Announced June 1994 as IMS COMPRESS. Renamed August 1995 IMS COMPRESSION-Extended.\n\nIMS Connect: A separately priced facility for IMS TM that provides access from TCP/IP connections.\n\nIMS CS/2: See IMS Client Server.\n\nIMS CS Toolkit: IMS Client/Server Toolkit. Set of utilities and application generators written by MultiSoft and sold by IBM. Allows GUI front-ends to be put on IMS 3270 applications. An add-on to IMS Client Server. IBM support ended February 1996.\n\nIMS Database Manager: See IMS DB.\n\nIMS DataPropagator: See DataPropagator.\n\nIMS DB: Information Management System Database Manager. IBM’s venerable (introduced in 1968) large system hierarchical DBMS. In casual conversation, either IMS1 DB or IMS TM may be referred to simply as IMS without anyone complaining. Following the introduction of DB2, it was assumed, both inside and outside IBM, that IMS DB would die a slow death as DB2’s performance improved to approach that of IMS DB. But, it never happened, mainly because of the number of major IMS-based applications at large organizations worldwide. Once IBM realized this, a major effort was made to keep both IMS DB and IMS TM up to date with the latest trends, such as Web enablement, though nobody proposed making it into a relational DBMS. See also HALDB.\n\nIMS External Subsystem Attach Facility: See ESAF.\n\nIMS PA: See IMS Performance Analyzer.\n\nIMSPARS: IMS Performance Analysis Reporting System. Replaced by IMS Performance Analyzer November 1997.\n\nIMS Performance Analyzer: IMS TM and IMS DB resource and performance management, and database availability. Part of the Database Performance Management Tools which are, in turn, part of the IBM Data Management Tools.\n\nIMS TM: Information Management System Transaction Manager. A very powerful and facility-rich TP monitor available under z/OS, mainly to support applications using the IMS DB database system, but also supporting VSAM and DB2. For a long time, it looked as if IMS/DC (IMS TM’s original name) would be relegated to a minor role, and that CICS was to become the only serious IBM offering in the TP monitor field. However, IBM has now renamed IMS/DC as IMS TM, which signaled a major effort on IBM’s part to keep it up to date with the latest trends, such as Web enablement, following the realization that DB2 was not going to put IMS DB and IMS TM out of business.\n\nIMS Transaction Manager: See IMS TM.\n\nIMS Workload Router: See WLR.\n\nIN: Information Network. IBM’s worldwide VANS. Began in 1978 as a remote time-sharing service, and grew until it comprised a backbone of very high-speed trunks offering dial-up access across the world. Widely used for EDI.

Withdrawn December 1997 after IBM began offering all z/OS unlicensed manuals available on their Web site, initially with a Web-based BookManager GUI.\n\nInformation/System: A collection of IBM technical data wrapped in software that could help find the relevant piece for the problem at hand in a customer mainframe site. z/OS version replaced by Info/Man December 1994. The z/VM version was withdrawn August 1996. The VSE/ESA version was withdrawn October 1990.\n\nInformation Catalog: Part of DB2 Warehouse Manager. A common repository for metadata about the objects within the data warehouse that can help users find, understand and access available data through the Information Catalog Manager. Information Catalog can be populated through metadata interchange with the DB2 Warehouse Center and other tools including QMF, Lotus1-2-3, Brio, Business Objects, Cognos, Excel, Hyperion.\n\nInformation Center: Information Center. A focal point within an organization for supporting end users. It started life as an IBM marketing ploy for selling lots of mainframe hardware via the DP department to support professional users on PCs. It evolved to try and support end-users on any platforms they happen to have. But the whole concept is ancient history now.\n\nInformation Center for iSeries: Online documentation available on a CD-ROM shipped with OS/400. Provides the starting point for finding iSeries 400 technical information. Also available on the Web.\n\nInformation Management System: see IMS1\n\nInformation Technology Association of America: See ITAA.\n\nInformation Technology Industry Council: See ITI.\n\nInformation Warehouse: IBMspeak for the notion (announced September 1991) of a framework for accessing data wherever it exists within the enterprise. Part of the idea is to minimize the number of access methods users have to learn to get at their data – ultimately it should come down to SQL and not much else. Not as simple as it seems, since IBM expects the notion to cover data held in DB2 databases, VSAM files, OS/2 and DOS files, DEC databases, Sybase or Oracle under Unix, and so on. The key enabler is DRDA. Other components of the Information Warehouse include products, standards, and tools. Also known as the Data Warehouse. The spec was published in March 1993. See also DataHub.\n\nInformix: Database and language software for the Unix environment. In the early 1990s it was sold by IBM for the pSeries.\n\ninfoSage: An IBM on-line news delivery service announced in February 1996. Provided subscribers with news stories ranging from news and business information to entertainment and sports. Information was tailored to suit individual needs with a choice in the method of delivery – via a personalized Web page on the IBM infoSage Web site, or Internet e-mail. Stopped accepting subscriptions November 27, 1996. According to then IBM Chairman of the Board Lou Gerstner, because it was competing with IBM’s own customers. See also infoMarket.\n\nInfoWindow: Host terminals. Support a variety of hosts, including eserverzSeries 900 and iSeries 400. Although a few models of the 3153 are still available to satisfy customers who are already committed to the InfoWindow family, the InfoWindow and InfoWindow II workstation families are essentially obsolete. Other models, all withdrawn, include InfoWindow: 3471347234763477 4055 (touch screen); InfoWindow II: 3481348234833486348734883489.

The key entry unit is used to enter DEA cryptographic keys into the TCM using a special cable (also tamper-proof). ICRF supports up to 1,000 IMS FastPath transactions per second, and a single ICRF can support up to seven PR/SM partitions. ICRF supports the DES, which means that IBM will be heavily restricted as to the people it can sell it to (DES devices are munitions and hence are subject to US government export restrictions).\n\nIntegrated Facility for Linux: Introduced on the System/390 G5, this optional eserver zSeries 900 facility adds dedicated Linux processing capability to an existing system without increasing the system’s size from a software charges point of view.\n\nIntegrated File System: See IFS3.\n\nIntegrated Netfinity Server: An Intel processor and PC memory packaged as a motherboard that fits inside an AS/400, allowing it to run Windows Server operating systems and the applications that run on them.

Between them, Intel and Microsoft own the PC standard. In the mid 1980s IBM bought a large lump of Intel (reportedly to ensure continuity of supplies of PC chips), but sold out most of its interest after a couple of years – in hindsight, not one of IBM’s better decisions. IBM established an agreement with Intel in the early 1980s which allowed IBM to clone Intel chips (but not to make more than 20% of its own requirements). Mid 1993, this cozy arrangement was beginning to look strained when IBM announced that it was developing clean room versions of the 486 and Pentium, which it would be using itself and also selling in the merchant semiconductor market in head-on competition with Intel. But, these days, Intel Inside is as important a slogan for most IBM PCs as it is for its competitors. See also Cyrix.\n\nIntelligent Decision Server: LAN-based information analysis software designed for setting up decision-support applications at the ground-level of an enterprise. Initially only available for OS/2 but Windows added soon after. Announced October 1996. Withdrawn February 2000.\n\nIntelligent Hub Manager: Software to manage LANs built with 8250 and 8260hubs.

X.400 mechanism used to convey messages from one person to another, and allowing the data to be correctly interpreted at the destination. Available on IBM EDI1 systems.\n\nIP Multicast: The ability to send and receive IP packets simultaneously sent to multiple IP addresses. This is not referring to e-mail sent to a distribution list, but to a broadcast model for things like audio/video. Huge savings are possible by sending a single packet to all listeners, rather than the same packet repeatedly to each listener. The downside is that listeners who miss or receive corrupted packets cannot request a retransmission. Not to mention the fact that it is a real-time, rather than an on-demand, approach. Issues surrounding listeners joining and leaving during the broadcast have been resolved, however. IP Multicast is supported fairly broadly, including z/VM.\n\nIPO: Installation Productivity Option. IBM’s first successful attempt at packaging system software to simplify installation and update. The name disappeared about the time its acronym became popular in the financial world (Initial Public Offering).\n\nIP PrintWay: Internet Protocol PrintWay.

ISAM datasets cannot reside on SMS-managed volumes in z/OS.\n\nISAPI: The Microsoft equivalent of NSAPI. An interface provided on Microsoft HTTP servers which allows other processes to be invoked by the browser client as an alternative to CGI. This has some performance advantages but is not supported by all HTTP servers.\n\nISC1: Inter-System Communication. A general form of mainframe communication and resource-sharing between host applications using the LU6 protocols. Under VTAM, ISC is a facility used with CICS and/or IMS TM for shipping transactions to another CICS or IMS TM system for execution. Uses LU6.1 under IMS and CICS and LU6.2 under CICS.
