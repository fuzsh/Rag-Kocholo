        "text": "Highlights: Did You Know There Are Three Informix Products??\n\nWelcome to the International Informix Users Group (IIUG) Insider! Designed for IIUG members and Informix user group leaders, this publication contains timely and relevant information for the IBM Informix community.\n\nEditorial\n\nIn my June editorial I expressed my concern about the future of Informix. As I said Informix is NOT dead. There is a road map for Informix v15. It has been delayed more than once. The current date is 2024 Q1.\n\nWe have yet to see if this date will be met and what will version 15 include. Will there be new innovations? Will Informix continue to lead technologically?\n\nNo one is going to kill Informix. IBM and HCL are happy with their revenues and many customers still depend on the product.\n\nIBM is happy with Informix but it seems they are unhappy with the Informix user community. We feel as if they want to get rid of the IIUG. Probably because we have demands, we are telling the truth to our users, we want more. So, after 22 years of supporting the IIUG we have no budget. At the TechXchange conference there will be no Informix sessions. IBM does not want the IIUG to have a technical event in 2023.\n\nWe are unable to reach IBM management, except Scott Pickett. Letters from IBM top level executives addressing the Informix user community no longer happen.\n\nI believe that an active user community is essential for any product.\n\nYour posts mean you care. But we need more.\n\nThey say that hope is the last thing you lose.\n\nI am still hoping.\n\nGary Ben-Israel\n\nIIUG Insider Editor\n\nIIUG Board of Directors\n\ngary@iiug.org\n\nHighlights\n\nDid You Know There Are Three Informix Products?\n\nIn addition to IBM Informix, HCL Software, the company that IBM contracted with six years ago to maintain the Informix code, and its subsidiary were given the right to produce their own branches from that code. That has resulted in two other “Informix” RDBMS: HCL Informix and HCL OneDB. So, what are the differences, if any, between these three products? Here is the true skinny:\n\nFirst and foremost any software written for any of the three, using any of their CSDK versions, will execute correctly and work just fine against any of the others as long as it does not require access to a feature that is not supported. So, what are the feature differences? Here it is in a nutshell:\n\nTaking IBM Informix Enterprise Edition v14.10.FC10 (the current release) as the starting point:\n\nThere are no “Editions” of either HCL Informix or OneDB. Both are at the same level for basic features and resources as IBM Informix Enterprise Edition. (OK, there is a “trial” version you can download free and use for testing purposes only, similar to IDS Developer Edition.)\n\nLicensing is different from IBM’s licenses. If you are interested in switching you should contact HCL or speak to an HCL partner. Depending on your current IBM licensing your HCL license may be more or less.\n\nHCL Informix v14.10.10 is identical to IDS v14.10.FC10 in every way except the branding and licensing.\n\nThe current release of OneDB (v 2.01) is feature equivalent to IDS v14.10.FC6 so a handful of changes in .FC7 through .FC10 are not included. However, HCL has pledged that the next release of OneDB (v 3.0) and all future releases will be maintained to include all features in IDS releases starting with the next major IDS release.\n\nOneDB v2.01 includes several features that are not included in IDS. Those include:\n\nSupport for the REST API v2 (IDS supports REST API v1)\n\nSupport for custom REST API calls dedicated to handling Timeseries data (IDS only supports the standard REST API calls and has no specific support for timeseries)\n\nSupport for Kubernetes, Helm Charts, and Docker packaging systems making OneDB easier to use on public Cloud systems like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc. and in on-prem systems using those systems for release control\n\nAll of the cNext features that will ultimately be included in the next release of IBM Informix will also be included in OneDB v3.0\n\nHCL intends to continue to support all three “Informix” engines.\n\nArt Kagel\n\nInformix Corner\n\nLatest Releases of IBM Informix, What’s New and What’s Coming…\n\nThe development team is hard at work and focused on the IBM Informix vNext release but we are also pushing forward with other releases that have occurred in the last few weeks.\n\nA new version of the Informix service for Cloud Pak for Data 4.7.0 was released at the end of June. This new release contains the 14.10.FC10 Informix server and we continue to release hand in hand with the Cloud Pak for Data major releases and plan interim releases as needed. With 4.7.0 release, the Informix service continues to improve the integration with the overall infrastructure and has worked to simplify the service deployment using the cpd-cli tool. Reduction of the service footprint has been a main theme for Informix and the overall Cloud Pak for Data releases.\n\nFor more information on what’s new in Cloud Pak for Data 4.7.0, check here.\n\nWe are also happy to announce the release of IBM Informix 12.10.xC16 just this week. The 12.10 fixpack releases continue to focus on delivering high quality defect fixes for customer reported issues and the fix list for xC16 is in the final stages of publishing. Also In the 12.10.xC16 fix pack, the JRE version was upgraded to IBM Java 8 as the IBM Java 7 had reached the end of its support date. For more info on this please check out the What’s new doc here and also the JRE/Java Plans for Informix article published in this newsletter as well.\n\nGoing back to vnext to conclude, look out for more information about the upcoming beta program being planned to start in Q4, 2023 for vnext. Scott Pickett spickett@us.ibm.com is collecting the info for clients that are interested in participating and more info will be published regarding the beta soon!\n\nKaren Qualley\n\nHCL\n\nIBM Product Announcement Letters are Available\n\nThe product announcement letters are available at IBM Documentation. Search for Informix 12.10 and select Announcement letters. See the announcement for the following information:\n\nDetailed product description\n\nProduct-positioning statement\n\nPackaging and ordering details\n\nInternational compatibility information\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nHP-UX Itanium End of Support\n\nHP is ending support for the Itanium processor and the HP-UX operating system. The fix-pack 12.10.xC15W1 is the last fix-pack update for Informix on the HP-UX platform across all releases.\n\nThis End of Support includes Client SDK 4.10.xC15 on HP-UX.\n\nEnd of Support for IBM Java 7\n\nIBM Informix 12.10, Client SDK 4.10 and Informix Warehouse Accelerator 12.10 version prior to xC16 included IBM Java 7 with the Installer. IBM Java 7 has reached the end of its service in 2022, and as a result there are no more maintenance releases for Java 7 (https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/java-sdk-lifecycle-dates). Because of this, and the open vulnerabilities which will not be addressed (https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/java-sdk-security-vulnerabilities) we are moving to IBM Java 8, which is the version included in IBM Informix 14.10.\n\nMinimum OS Levels for Java 8\n\nJava 8 minimum OS Levels are newer than the original 12.10 OS minimums. The 12.10.16 OS Level minimum will now match that of Java 8, where IBM Java 8 is available. Please refer to Informix system requirement document at https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/informix-server-system-requirements.\n\nBeyond Java 8\n\nIBM Java 8 will continue to be supported with maintenance releases at least until April of 2025 (see java-sdk-lifecycle-dates above). On or before that EOS date we plan to stop shipping Java with Informix 14.10 and allow customers to provide their own Java. We will announce changes to the required Java level in future releases.\n\nSince IBM can no longer provide security fixes for JAVA 7, and Java 8 will reach end of support date in 2025, IBM will no longer bundle Java with future release of Informix. Customers will have to download and install a supported Java version from their own vendor:\n\nInformix 12.10.xC16 will have Java 8 bundled; any later fix packs on Version 12 will not have JAVA bundled, but will support Java 8.\n\nInformix 14.10.xC10 has Java 8 bundled presently, later fix packs on Version 14 will not have JAVA bundled, but will support at least Java 11.\n\nInformix Vnext will not have Java bundled, but will be requiring Java 17.\n\nPLATFORMS WITHDRAWN FROM SERVICE:\n\nThe following platforms are being discontinued due to lack of support for Java 8 (and no longer supported by vendor):\n\nPlatform: Linux Intel\n\nPlatform: Linux – IBM POWER (Big Endian)\n\nHardware: IBM POWER (System p, System i, POWER Blades)\n\nNote: The following codes are used in this table:\n\nF = 64-bit\n\nRHEL: Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n\nPlatform: Linux – IBM Z\n\nHardware: IBM eServer z Systems\n\nNote: The following codes are used in this table:\n\nF = 64-bit\n\nRHEL: Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n\nPlatform: Windows\n\nHardware: Intel x86, x64 (AMD AMD64, Intel EM64T)\n\nNote: The following codes are used in this table:\n\nT = 32-bit on Windows platforms\n\nF = 64 bit on x64 (AMD AMD64, Intel EM64T)\n\nOperating System Version\n\nInformix 12.10\n\nWindows 2012 R2\n\n12.10.TC16\n\n12.10.FC16\n\nWindows 2012\n\n12.10.TC16\n\n12.10.FC16\n\nPlatform: Mac OS X\n\nHardware: Intel EM64T\n\nNote: The following code is used in this table:\n\nF = 64-bit\n\nOperating System Version\n\nInformix 14.10\n\nInformix 12.10\n\nMac OS X 10.10 “Yosemite”\n\n12.10.FC16\n\nThis is a slight exception to the JAVA issue in that presently it is an Apple unsupported version of MAC OS X and this O/S has been withdrawn from service and support by Apple (no security updates since 2015). Therefore, 12.10.FC15 is the last version of Informix available for any MAC OS X platform and it is no longer on a supported O/S. We may at a future date withdraw all binaries available for this platform as a result. There are presently no plans for further development on MAC OS X at this time.\n\nPLATFORMS WITH JAVA SUPPORT LEVEL CHANGES:\n\nOther platforms below, support level changes in italic indicating a minimum of a Java 8 support level and other requirements unless otherwise noted:\n\nThe minimum OS level for Java 8 has raised the 12.10 Minimum OS level. These minimum OS levels are not necessarily supported by vendor, so newer versions would be needed for support.\n\nhttps://www.ibm.com/docs/en/sdk-java-technology/8?topic=installing-supported-environments\n\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/pages/informix-server-system-requirements\n\nThe following platforms highlighted in italic have upgraded minimum versions for JAVA 8.\n\nPlatform: IBM AIX\n\nPlatform: Linux Intel\n\nPlatform: Linux – IBM POWER (Big Endian)\n\nHardware: IBM POWER (System p, System i, POWER Blades)\n\nNote: The following codes are used in this table:\n\nF = 64-bit\n\nRHEL: Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n\nPlatform: Linux – IBM POWER (Little Endian)\n\nHardware: IBM POWER8® for ppc64le\n\nNote: The following codes are used in this table:\n\nF = 64-bit\n\nRHEL: Red Hat Enterprise Linux for PPCle64 Linux, the P7 hardware/OS is not supported by Java 8.

Most of the times those processes are running a slow query.\n\nSometimes it’s hard to know if the query is using the best query plan or not. A DBA can reproduce the query, but it it was prepared without values or if the statistics were changed after it started there is no guarantee that the query plan seen by the DBA is the same as the running query.\n\nWe have “onstat -g pqs” which sometimes can give us a clue, but it’s mostly cryptic and undocumented. If a user has X-Windows he can try xtree, but it’s a bit strange for todays standards.\n\nWe also have SQLTRACE, but if it was not set when the query was launched it will not capture the info (and besides, due to the circular nature of the buffer it may not be there at the time we need it).\n\nA simple pseudo-table in sysmaster could probably implement this with ease.\n\nIt could also be extended to support the “last” query plan making it easy to get the query plan in any tool\n\nVotes: 105 (+0)\n\nCreated: December 24, 2018\n\nStatus: Future consideration\n\nInformix should be able to change owner on tables and any other objects\n\nIf user=informix creates all database and all tables, then programmer creates table but user=informix cannot change it.
