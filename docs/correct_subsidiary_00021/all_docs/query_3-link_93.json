        "text": "Relational database management systems help companies in almost every industry harness and tap into the power of the information they gather, store, manage and analyze for business operations. One of the most powerful RDBMS options available today is Informix by IBM, a brand with a proven track record of stability and innovation.\n\nSEE: Database administrator (TechRepublic Premium)\n\nIn this review of IBM Informix, we’ll discuss its key features, pros and cons, and how much it costs. We’ll also cover some of the top alternatives to IBM Informix.\n\nJump to:\n\nWhat is IBM Informix?\n\nKey Informix features\n\nIBM Informix price breakdown\n\nIBM Informix competitors\n\nWhat is IBM Informix?\n\nInformix is a robust RDBMS acquired by IBM from Informix Corporation in 2001. It is a secure embeddable database that facilitates the use of Internet of Things and online transaction processing applications with high transaction rates supporting non-SQL data types. Informix works well for companies of all sizes.\n\nSEE: Best data preparation software (TechRepublic)\n\nInformix can handle traditional relational, object-relational and dimensional databases. Its data replication features allow you to synchronize data among heterogeneous servers and distribute SQL statements and files between servers.\n\nInformix consists of several related products:\n\nInformix Server\n\nInformix Client Software Development Kit: A client SDK for writing applications with the included ODBC, JDBC, .NET, ESQL/C, Object Interface for C++ or OLE/DB APIs.\n\nIBM OpenAdmin Tool: A web application for administering and analyzing the performance of Informix database servers.\n\nInformix DataBlade Developers Kit: Tools to develop and package DataBlade modules. These are software packages that extend the functionality of the database server.\n\nInformix 4GL: Programming language.\n\nInformix JDBC Driver\n\nIBM Informix Genero: Allows you to convert 4GL applications into more modern and rapid development environments.\n\nThe Informix database server uses a Virtual-Table Interface, a DataBlade API, access-method-specific SQL extensions and API libraries to facilitate the development of user-defined access methods.\n\nThe free developer edition can be found here, while the main Informix product download page can be found here.\n\nKey Informix features\n\nRuns on UNIX, Linux, macOS and Windows\n\nMultiple versions to meet various needs\n\nLanguage support for SQL, SPL, C, C++, .NET, Java and PHP\n\nCloud and data warehousing tools\n\nAbility to write applications with the JSON query language or IBM Data Studio\n\nMongoDB community drivers from MongoDB or the REST API\n\nExcellent scalability with easy integration and self-service customizations\n\nRedundancy management via duplicate servers/clusters for load balancing and high availability\n\nScheduler to run common administrative tasks and set alerts\n\nSecurity features to encrypt data, secure connections, control user privileges and audit data security\n\nPerformance tuning via memory management, fragmentation, parallelization and query optimization operations\n\nVirtual appliance for use in existing virtual environments\n\nEnterprise hypervisor edition optimized for cloud virtualization environments\n\nArray of educational training and services\n\nIBM Informix price breakdown\n\nAlthough the basic developer version of Informix is free, the non-cloud versions of Informix require interested buyers to contact IBM for pricing. The cloud version has a cost structure based on environmental size:\n\nIBM Informix on Cloud Small plan\n\nThe Small plan for IBM Informix on Cloud is $1,250 and is best for operations that focus on development, customization and functional testing.\n\nOther details of this plan:\n\nPrivate 2 x 2.0 GHz Cores\n\n8GB RAM\n\n1x100GB (SAN), 1×500 GB (SAN); 100GB at 500 IOPS\n\n1 Gbps Network\n\nIBM Informix on Cloud Medium plan\n\nThe Medium plan for IBM Informix on Cloud is $2,250 and also works well for operations that focus on development, customization and functional testing.\n\nOther details of this plan:\n\nPrivate 4 x 2.0 GHz Cores\n\n16GB RAM\n\n1x100GB (SAN), 1x1TB (SAN); 100GB at 1200 IOPS\n\n1 Gbps Network\n\nIBM Informix on Cloud Large plan\n\nThe Large plan for IBM Informix on Cloud is $4,000. It works best for operations that focus on production and/or pre-production.\n\nOther details of this plan:\n\nPrivate 8 x 2.0 GHz Cores\n\n32GB RAM\n\n1x100GB (SAN), 1x2TB (SAN); 100GB at 1600 IOPS\n\n1 Gbps Network\n\nIBM Informix on Cloud Extra Large plan\n\nThe Extra Large plan for IBM Informix on Cloud is $8,000. It is primarily suited for production operations.\n\nOther details of this plan:\n\nBare metal server 12 x 2.4 GHz Xeon Cores\n\n128GB RAM\n\n2x800GB SSD configured with RAID 1 (~800GB)\n\n6×1.2TB SSD configured with RAID 10 (~3.5TB)\n\n10 Gbps Redundant Network\n\nIBM Informix competitors\n\nIBM Informix competitors in the RDBMS space include Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MariaDB, MySQL, IBM DB2 and MongoDB. While open source solutions are commonly used, Microsoft SQL Server and MongoDB are IBM Informix’s most equivalent competitors in this space.\n\nDetractors of IBM Informix have described a lack of development resources, impacted efficiency with remote databases and poor public integration with open source software. Many of these same companies also struggle to find data professionals with previous Informix experience and skills.\n\nThat being said, most customer reviews illustrate a favorable view of Informix. It seems Informix appeals to a niche audience with its highly specific product offerings, whereas general database needs may be more sufficiently met by other competitors."
