        "text": "Matthias Funke\n\nMatthias Funke\n\nVice President, Portfolio Management, IBM Corporate Strategy\n\nPublished Apr 24, 2017\n\nOn April 18th, IBM's Daniel Hernandez, VP Offering Management for IBM's Analytics business unit, announced the new partnership between IBM and HCL to jointly develop and market the Informix family of products:\n\nI, as well as many of my colleagues, have been looking forward to this moment, as it bears a great opportunity for the Informix product, the people involved in developing and selling it, but most importantly todays and future clients.\n\nAs the responsible Offering Management Executive for Informix, allow me to further elaborate on the\n\nNature of this partnership agreement:\n\nThis is a strategic IP licensing agreement that will enable HCL to access and evolve the Informix source code. It is not a sale of the source code, nor the product, nor existing software or support contracts. The partnership agreement covers the next 15 years.\n\nIt is a joint investment by both companies to accelerate the development of Informix and expand it's routes to market, leverage HCLs industry-oriented product- and IT services capability that will help position Informix in domains where it's great strength' like time series functionality as well as embedded, light-weight, and 'hands-off' administration are important. Think IoT devices, Gateways or Automotive. Go here to learn more about HCLs product & platform business unit:\n\nDevelopment and support personnel will move to HCL and is subject to further growth to deliver on the goals above. Offering Management, Marketing, Sales as well as Accelerated Value Program support (AVP) will continue with IBM but gets complemented and thus expanded on the HCL side.\n\nNothing changes for existing IBM customers. Their software license and support agreements remain unchanged.\n\nNow, why is this good for you?\n\nFocus: New as well as existing Informix clients will enjoy a stronger market presence of Informix, and a commitment by IBM and HCL as expressed in a roadmap and joint go to market campaigns.\n\nTime to market: The Informix product will enjoy accelerated delivery of new product capabilities to help Informix to win in the market. It will mean an expansion of Informix core capabilities as well as cloud-based offerings to help Informix clients in their journey to cloud.\n\nConfidence: For new clients to invest in a mature, battle-tested, yet future-proof technology. And reassurance for existing Informix clients who might have worried about the future of Informix and their investments to date.\n\nFeel free to comment or reach out in private to clarify your questions.\n\nMatthias Funke"
