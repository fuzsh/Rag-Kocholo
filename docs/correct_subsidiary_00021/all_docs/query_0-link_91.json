It used to be less of a big deal because it was bundled with the engine. Now it no longer is, and the only stuff available on Passport Advantage is 4.10 and older or the Windows versions of 4.50. When I try to download via the iiug.org link, it gets about two click in before webroot declares that I'm being redirected to a phishing site.\n\nI should just be able to get it through PA like everything else, or via FixCentral if that fails.\n\n------------------------------\n\nTOM GIRSCH\n\n------------------------------\n\n#Informix Original Message:\n\nSent: Thu June 24, 2021 02:17 PM\n\nFrom: TOM GIRSCH\n\nSubject: Client SDK Download\n\nWhy do IBM and HCL keep hiding the CSDK download?
