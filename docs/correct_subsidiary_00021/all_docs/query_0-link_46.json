IBM HISTORY The company which became IBM was founded in 1896 as the Tabulating Machine Company by Herman Hollerith, in Broome County, New York , where it still maintains very limited operations. It was incorporated as Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation on June 16, 1911, and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1916 by George Winthrop Fairchild. CTR's Canadian and later South American subsidiary was named International Business Machines in 1917, and the entire company took this name in 1924 when Thomas J. Watson took control of it. The beginning of IBM’s involvement in IT services can be traced back at least to 1989 when Eastman Kodak Company and IBM completed an agreement by which IBM designed, built and managed a new state-of-the-art data center for Kodak in Rochester, New York. Also in 1986, IBM introduced Business Recovery Services, an offering that enables a business to continue operations in the event of an unplanned outage or disaster. In 2002, IBM Global Services acquired the management consulting and technology services arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers\n\n6. Since 1999, IBM has made 83 acquisitions.

IBM INDIA\n\n9. IBM INDIA History Pre-liberalization IBM commenced business in India in the 1930s and set up manufacturing there in 1951 The business operated successfully until the mid-1970s, when India’s Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) required foreign owned companies to reduce their equity ownership to (in IBM’s case) 26%. IBM was unwilling to take that course of action and in 1978, the company ceased its operations but still continued to conduct business in India as an off-shore entity only, through a small Liaison Office. Post-liberalization India was liberalized in 1991, relaxing FDI norms. IBM re-entered the Indian shores in 1992 with a Tata joint-venture, named Tata Information Systems Ltd. Its business interest in India was still focused on product sales. In 1997, IBM Global Services was set-up. India Research Lab was set-up in the IIT Delhi campus in 1998. In 1999, IBM bought out Tata's stake in the company and IBM India became a fully owned subsidiary of IBM Corporation.\n\n10.
