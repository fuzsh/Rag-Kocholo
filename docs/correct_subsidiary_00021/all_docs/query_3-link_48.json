        "text": "Many organizations draw attention to their library of connectors. After all, data connectivity is a core capability needed for applications to maximize their business value. However, it is essential to understand exactly what you are getting when evaluating connectivity. Some vendors are happy to offer connectors that implement basic proof-of-concept level connectivity. These connectors may highlight the possibilities of working with IBM Informix, but often only provide a fraction of capability. Finding real value from these connectors usually requires additional IT or development resources.\n\nUnlike these POC-quality connectors, every CData IBM Informix driver offers full-featured IBM Informix data connectivity. The CData IBM Informix drivers support extensive IBM Informix integration, providing access to all of the IBM Informix data and meta-data needed by enterprise integration or analytics projects. Each driver contains a powerful embedded SQL engine that offers applications easy and high-performance access to all IBM Informix data. In addition, our drivers offer robust authentication and security capabilities, allowing users to connect securely across a wide range of enterprise configurations. Compare drivers and connectors to read more about some of the benefits of CData's driver connectivity.\n\nUsing the CData IBM Informix drivers and connectors, IBM Informix can be easily integrated with almost any application. Any software or technology that can integrate with a database or connect with standards-based drivers like ODBC, JDBC, ADO.NET, etc., can use our drivers for live IBM Informix data connectivity. Explore some of the more popular IBM Informix data integrations online.\n\nAdditionally, since IBM Informix supported by CData Connect Cloud, we enable all kinds of new IBM Informix cloud integrations.\n\nIBM Informix data integration is typically enabled with CData Sync, a robust any-to-any data pipeline solution that is easy to set up, runs everywhere, and offers comprehensive enterprise-class features for data engineering. CData Sync makes it easy to replicate IBM Informix data any database or data warehouse, and maintain parity between systems with automated incremental IBM Informix replication. In addition, our IBM Informix drivers and connectors can be easily embedded into a wide range of data integration tools to augment existing solutions."
