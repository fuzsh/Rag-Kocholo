        "text": "Through a combination of software solutions and streamlining systems, IBM has helped the Bank of China's London operations cut their paper requirements from 50 pounds per day to roughly 2.5 pounds per day.\n\nAt the same time, IBM was able to improve the efficiency of how the bank's employees conducted their financial transactions.\n\nIBM helped the bank achieve this success with a combination of its Informix and Centric iSolutions sofware programs; the paper reductions were implemented by cutting down on the roughly 3,000 messages that the Bank of China sent between branches every day; each of which needed to be manually printed and distributed.\n\nBy swapping out paper messages with electronic communications, employees are able to monitor the messages as they're sent and received, improving the reliability and efficiency of the system.\n\n\"The improved access to information has been key in helping us meet compliance regulations and reduce costs,\" Stephen Hinds, COO of Bank of China's London branch and subsidiary, said in a statement. \"IBM and Centric iSolutions have been instrumental in helping us stay ahead to more efficiently manage an increasing number of interbank transactions and monitor business process activity across multiple departments.\"\n\nIBM has of course been dramatically expanding the type of business operations it focuses on, adapting its business along with the overall shift of IT as a stand-alone department in a company to IT as a core facilitator of every part of a business. In recent months, the company has partnered with Schneider Electric on building energy efficiency, expanded its water management projects around the globe, and of course continued its work in greening traditional IT areas, such as with its LEED-certified data center in North Carolina.\n\nAll this has added up to big successes for IBM; the company was proudly touting its recent quarterly financials, which show a company generating over $9 billion in profit in 2010, a more than 10 percent growth over the previous year."
