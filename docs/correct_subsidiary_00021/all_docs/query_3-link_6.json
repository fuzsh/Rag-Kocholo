In some cases the answers are expanded and refined from earlier today:\n\nTLS? What does that TLA stand for?\n\nTLS = Transport Layer Security. We're supporting updated TLS version with v14.10\n\nRight now the page number of a partition is a 32 bit number in the page header. If no limit, where does this go? Or will you be changing the format of the page header to more than 24 bytes?\n\nTo quote Eliza from My Fair Lady -- \"Just you wait!!\" All will be explained when v.15 is released. :)\n\nDeploying on Linux Mint, a superset of Ubuntu\n\nThanks for the insight\n\nthe grid of supported environments that Carlton discussed showed RHEL 8.4, 8.5. Wondering about compatibility with later releases, as 8.9 is the current 8.x release, and 9.3 is also available.\n\nI have been testing with Rhel 9 at times. The grid shown is preliminary. We are still evaluating platforms based on compiler support and other criteria\n\nWhat about Infromix 15 and Solaris. What version of Solaris supported?\n\nTBD; we are currently looking into it and have ongoing discussions. We will update as things get more concrete.\n\nWill be there also a HCL Informix 15 Version and if so, will be there any difference to IBM Informix 15?\n\nVersioning and release information shared here is specific to IBM Informix only. IBM Informix has the largest customer base and partner community. We do not control or have insight into what HCL / Actian might do with their derivative ports of Informix.\n\nThe Informix Family is happy and sad to announce the retirement of Barrie Shaw after many (MANY!) dedicated years of Informix service.\n\nWe will miss you Barrie, wishing you a happy retirement!\n\nNo ubuntu ?\n\nSimilar to Solaris, this is TBD as well. We will update as things get more concrete, thanks.\n\nIs OneDB similar to Informix ?\n\nThis is best covered in a conversation than here. Please contact your IBM representative or reach out to us on the Product Management team. Thanks\n\nCan we go directly from 12.x to 15.x ?\n\nIn theory, yes. That functionality is coming in Beta 3 which we'll start testing soon. You will probably encounter O/S support issues when trying to migrate to V. 15. O/S versions supported for v.12 will undoubtedly NOT be supported for V.15 requiring something other than a direct, in-place migration.\n\nI heard that Oracle has left and is not developing on the OpenVMS platform. Is there an Informix release on the VMS and how possible is it to be ported to the Open VMS?\n\nPlease contact your local IBM representative oor the IBM Product Management team\n\nMany vendors are developing columnar databases. What can you say about [that?]\n\nThe columnar database functionality is the bedrock of the Informix Warehouse Accelerator (IWA) or Advanced Enterprise Edition which was released in Informix v.11.7 in 2011. It is the in-memory analytics engine for Informix. It is still available today. It is sometimes referred to by its IBM nickname \"Informix Blu.\"\n\nAs regards IWA, how many actual \"production implementations\" are there?\n\nThat is difficult to answer, we don't always know what customers are using.\n\n------------------------------\n\nCarlton Doe\n\nOriginal Message:\n\nSent: Thu March 28, 2024 01:45 PM\n\nFrom: Carlton Doe\n\nSubject: IBM Informix: What's new and what's upcoming Webinar\n\nHi everyone,\n\nYou can watch the on-demand recording here and download the slides here.\n\nPlease share your questions below.\n\n------------------------------\n\nCarlton Doe\n\nOriginal Message:\n\nSent: Mon February 19, 2024 11:32 AM\n\nFrom: Carlton Doe\n\nSubject: IBM Informix: What's new and what's upcoming Webinar\n\nSummary\n\nThe IBM Informix database serves as the foundation for thousands of applications and billions of devices worldwide. IBM is fully intent on investing in the future of IBM Informix with the next major release planned for launch in the first half of 2024. With the next major release of IBM Informix, IBM plans to redefine data scalability, enhance engine capabilities, and refine database administration to ultimately boost database performance.\n\nHear from the IBM Informix Product Management team and IIUG about new capabilities in IBM Informix v14.10 and why you should upgrade to access better performance, scalability, operational efficiencies, and watsonx AI integrations in the upcoming major release, Informix v15.\n\nLearn new capabilities in IBM Informix v14.10 and why you should upgrade\n\nLearn new capabilities in the upcoming major release - Informix v15\n\nLearn about integration with watsonx.data for AI\n\nPlease join us in this on-demand webinar.
