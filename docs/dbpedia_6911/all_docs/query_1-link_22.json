The girl is snubbed by the local children because of her grandmother's reputation and her own unkempt appearance, but she gets her revenge by playing pranks on them. At a May Day picnic, Fanchon initially frightens and then intrigues Landry Barbeau, the son of a wealthy merchant. After Fanchon saves Landry's brother, Didier, from mistreatment and rescues Landry himself from drowning, the young man tells his parents that he loves Fanchon and ends his engagement to the priggish Madelon. Although she longs for love, Fanchon proudly tells Landry she will not marry him unless his father asks her. While Landry is away for a year, Old Fadette dies and Fanchon is left alone. When he returns and develops a serious fever, his parents invite Fanchon to visit. Her presence leads to Landry's recovery, and his father begs Fanchon to marry his son.",
