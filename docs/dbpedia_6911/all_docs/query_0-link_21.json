        "text": "Mary Pickford (1892–1979) was a Canadian-American motion picture actress, producer, and writer. During the silent film era she became one of the first great celebrities of the cinema and a popular icon known to the public as \"America's Sweetheart\".[1]\n\nPickford was born Gladys Louise Smith in Toronto and began acting on stage in 1900. She started her film career in the United States in 1909.[2] Initially with the Biograph film company, she moved to the Independent Motion Picture Company (IMP) in 1911, then briefly to the Majestic Film Company later that same year, followed by a return to Biograph in 1912.[3] After appearing in over 150 short films during her years with these studios she began working in features with Zukor's Famous Players Film Company, a studio which eventually became part of Paramount Pictures. By 1916 Pickford's popularity had climbed to the point that she was awarded a contract that made her a partner with Zukor and allowed her to produce her own films.[4] In 1919 Pickford teamed with D.W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks to create United Artists, an organization designed to distribute their own films.[5] Following the release of Secrets (1933) Pickford retired from acting in motion pictures. However, she remained active as a producer for several years afterwards.[6] She sold her stock in United Artists in 1956.[7]\n\nPickford won two Academy Awards in her lifetime. The first was in 1929 when she won the award for Best Actress for her performance in Coquette.[8] The second was in 1975 when she was presented with an Honorary Academy Award \"in recognition of her unique contributions to the film industry and the development of film as an artistic medium\".[8] As of 2009 two of Pickford's films have been added to the National Film Registry: Tess of the Storm Country (1914) and The Poor Little Rich Girl (1917).[9] For her work in motion pictures Pickford received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6280 Hollywood Boulevard.[10]\n\nUnless otherwise referenced, the information presented here is derived from the web site of the American Film Institute, the filmography prepared by Library of Congress historian Christel Schmidt, and the books Mary Pickford Rediscovered by Kevin Brownlow, Mary Pickford: From Here to Hollywood by Scott Eyman, and Pickford: The Woman Who Made Hollywood by Eileen Whitfield.\n\nShort films\n\n[edit]\n\nBiograph (1909)\n\n[edit]\n\nMary Pickford began working for the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company in April 1909 and remained with the company until the end of 1910.[12][13] During this period Pickford made 43 films released in 1909, plus a 44th film that was not released. Most of these films are one-reelers while the remaining films are split-reelers (i.e. one of two films released on the same reel).\n\nRelease date Title Credited as Director Notes Writer Producer Actress Role May 24, 1909 Two Memories Yes Marion's sister D.W.

Pickford historian Christel Schmidt has confirmed that the actress does not appear in these films.[39] The Internet Movie Database lists Pickford as appearing in the Biograph shorts entitled Mrs. Jones Entertains (January 9, 1909),[40] The Fascinating Mrs. Francis (January 21, 1909)[41] and The Deception (March 22, 1909).[42] However, Pickford did not begin with Biograph until the end of April 1909.[43] Mary Pickford is credited with appearing in the movie Pictureland in 1911, but a recently discovered copy shows that she is not in the film. The stars are Isabel Rae and King Baggot and the film was likely directed by Thomas Ince.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nTimeline of Mary Pickford\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nMain sources\n\nBrownlow, Kevin (1999).
