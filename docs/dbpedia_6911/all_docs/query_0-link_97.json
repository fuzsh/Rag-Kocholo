        "text": "Poems and other creative writing tidbits dedicated to silent stars is not unusual but this little piece in a 1922 issue of Motion Picture Magazine is a bit different because the author of these poems was Doris Kenyon, a popular star herself.\n\nIf you want to see Doris in action, I recommend A Girl’s Folly, which is all about a country girl running off to Fort Lee, New Jersey to become a movie star. (It’s the header image.) But today, our focus is on Kenyon’s poetry chops.\n\nHAROLD LLOYD\n\nArpeggios on a piano;\n\nPuck full of cocktails;\n\nA frog sitting on a lily pad,\n\nWinking at a dragonfly;\n\nThe school dunce graduating\n\nWith honors.\n\nCONSTANCE TALMADGE\n\nFrosting on a birthday cake;\n\nA butterfly alight on a back-comb;\n\nA Stutz roadster on an open-road;\n\nPink lemonade and popcorn at a circus;\n\nThe click of jeweled heels on a polished dance-floor;\n\nThe willow shining her finger-tips in a silvery stream ;\n\nEyes full of tinkling songs ;\n\nAnd a blase debutante at a Russian opera.\n\nRICHARD BARTHELMESS\n\nMuted strings on a violin;\n\nEros dressed in overalls;\n\nScent of new-mown hay under a summer shower;\n\nIdeals and ideas woven into a May basket ;\n\nA country lane carpeted with apple blossom petals;\n\nTobacco jar and slippers by a fireplace;\n\nSummer vows kept down the years;\n\nAnd pictures in a camp fire.\n\nMARY PICKFORD\n\nSilent prayer falling softly on the night;\n\nWisteria hanging over an arbor of dreams;\n\nFairy spray from the wave of success;\n\nThe vesper song of the hermit thrush;\n\nWater-Iilies shining in the dusk;\n\nLotus-bud hands clasped over the head of a child;\n\nDebussy’s notes painted by Romney’s brush;\n\nAnd the reflection of a humming-bird’s wing\n\nOn a star.\n\nRODOLPH VALENTINO\n\nA smoldering volcano;\n\nThe hot breath of a bull at bay;\n\nA gondola melting into the sunset;\n\nA Spanish love-song with\n\nAn accompaniment of clashing swords;\n\nA heart-shaped valentine bought by every girl;\n\nThe drooping eyes of the camel\n\nReflecting nothing, yet revealing all;\n\nA muezzin’s daybreak call from a minaret;\n\nAnd a sword of steel in a velvet sheath.\n\nMADGE KENNEDY\n\nSome drops of perfume spilled on a miniature;\n\nThe graciousness of a queen with\n\nThe understanding of a hand-maiden;\n\nA Salvation Army lassie with a Fifth Avenue style;\n\nMadame Récamier serving tea at the Ritz;\n\nCandles burning at the altar at twilight;\n\nArbutus on a gleaming hillside;\n\nAll dreams we dream at dusk;\n\nWhich is itself a dream;\n\nAnd the genius of simplicity.\n\nWhile the other stars should be pretty familiar to most silent fans (and if they aren’t, you have yourself a nice little list of big names to check out and enjoy) Madge Kennedy is a little more obscure. While her later work in supporting talkie roles is easy to come by, the only film that seems to be available to the public is The Danger Game. (It was released recently on DVD by Milestone as part of their Fort Lee filmmaking set The Champion.)\n\nAs for the poetry, I am afraid I am a terrible judge of it so you will have to make that call yourself. I have certainly never heard of Valentino being compared to a camel before, that’s for sure.\n\n☙❦❧\n\nLike what you’re reading? Please consider sponsoring me on Patreon.
