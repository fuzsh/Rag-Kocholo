The Barnardsville location was Yademos, the Charles Pfizer estate, whose Japanese gardens were spotlighted in the August 1908 American Home and Gardens. The Plaiinfield location was the Golestan Japanese Gardens, on the estate of P. D.

A big United States cruiser off in the distance adds to the illusion on the naval side.\"\n\nLong before production began, the 16 January 1915 Moving Picture World had reported that Hollywood-based Jesse L. Lasky said that theatrical producer David Belasco might \"come west to supervise the filming\" of Madame Butterfly, which Belasco had originally created as a one-act play, called Madame Butterfly: A Tragedy of Japan, in 1900. However, in an article in the 13 November 1915 Moving Picture World, Belasco made it clear that Daniel Frohman's current Famous Players' version of Madame Butterfly was different than his original, and therefore did not violate the agreement he had made with Lasky's Feature Play Company in 1914. Belasco said, \"In dramatizing the story I naturally invented and introduced dramatic situations and a succession of scenes that did not occur in [John Luther Long's novel], and these are my property.\" What may have brought forth this statement was a deal between Lasky and Frohman that called for Frohman to make certain alterations in his Madame Butterfly. That would explain the two different endings in the film: Reviews-summaries in the 6 November 1915 Motion Picture News and 13 November 1915 Moving Picture World presented an ending in which \"Cho-Cho-San commits ritual suicide with a sword and then dies in the arms of \"Lieutenant Pinkerton\"; but in the 20 November 1915 Motion Picture News review, the Japanese woman \"seeks oblivion in the still waters of a Japanese lake.\" This latter ending, in which Cho Cho San drowns herself, is the one viewed by the AFI Catalog in 2021. Neither ending can be found in John Luther Long's original 1898 short story, which concluded with a less tragic Cho Cho San taking her baby and disappearing from her mountain cabin before Adelaide Pinkerton showed up to claim it. Belasco, in 1900, apparently added the violent confrontation that resulted in her ritual suicide, and that scene in turn ended up in Giacomo Puccini's opera, Madame Butterfly, which had its premiere in Milan on 17 Feb 1904.\n\nSome sources, including Variety and the Moving Picture World, listed Frank Dekum as Frank Bekum.\n\nMadame Butterly opened at the Strand Theatre in New York City on 14 November 1915, a Sunday, with an \"innumerable throng\" of fans crowding the theater all day, according to the 20 November 1915 Motion Picture News. The official release came the following day, Monday, 15 November 1915.\n\nParamount remade Madame Butterfly in 1932 (see entry) with Sylvia Sidney.\n\nAccording to the Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Database, this film is extant.\n\nLess\n\nIn Nagasaki, Japan, the maiden Geisha Cho Cho San is told by a soothsayer that a stranger from a foreign land will come into her life, and \"Woe unto you if you take him to your heart.\" Nonetheless, when she meets a dashing American naval officer, Lieutenant Pinkerton, at the opera, she succumbs to his entreaties, and marries him in a traditional ceremony.
