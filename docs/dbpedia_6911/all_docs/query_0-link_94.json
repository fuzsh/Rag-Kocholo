        "text": "I was nominated yet again for another Sunshine Blogger Award, this time by the lovely Taking Up Room. Thanks a lot!\n\nHere are the rules:\n\nDisplay the award’s official logo somewhere on your blog.\n\nThank the person who nominated you.\n\nProvide a link to your nominator’s blog.\n\nAnswer your nominator’s questions.\n\nNominate up to 11 bloggers.\n\nAsk your nominees 11 questions.\n\nNotify your nominees by commenting on at least one of their blog posts\n\nSo here are my answers to Taking Up Room’s questions…\n\nWhich movie of 2024 has been your favorite so far? Your least favorite?\n\nIt’s definitely Lisa Frankenstein so far. It combines a genre I’m not enthusiastic about (romantic comedy) with a genre I adore (horror) to great effect.\n\nTeenage outcast Lisa crosses paths with the reanimated corpse of a composer from the Victorian era, hiding him in her bedroom. The two form a close bond as Lisa gathers newer, better functioning body parts for her monster admirer– and the way she does it involves lots of revenge on the adults and classmates who have tormented her.\n\nThe film has some of the sanitized visuals and CG bloodletting I don’t care for with modern movies, but Kathryn Newton and Cole Sprouse are adorably insane as the romantic leads and I loved the main character’s strange coming of age journey. I also find it extremely appealing as a silent movie fan since Lisa Frankenstein pays a lot of homage to German expressionism, GW Pabst (the protagonist’s favorite director), and George Melies.\n\nThe worst I’ve seen is The Idea of You, a disposable Amazon original I watched with one of my sisters. I have already admitted rom-coms aren’t my thing, but I can still appreciate the best of them. However, the film is basically Harry Styles x OC fanfic and it runs out of steam quickly. I was also let down by the horror film Longlegs, which suffered from thin characters and a story that grew less interesting as it went.\n\nDo you like superhero movies or are you over them?\n\nOver them– at least the Marvel style ones. I do count a few superhero movies among my favorites, even some of the MCU ones at that. But the eternal need for higher stakes (save the city! No, the world! No, the galaxy! No, the universe! No, THE MULTIVERSE!!), the tiresome Joss Whedon style dialogue, the rampant bathos, and the inability to just let things end are all factors in me being over the MCU. I haven’t enjoyed any of the newer DC films either, with the exception of the 2019 Joker movie (and even that one has diminished for me on rewatch).\n\nPlus, no superhero movie will ever top The Return of Captain Invincible, a low-budget ’80s musical with tunes penned by the folks that gave us The Rocky Horror Picture Show and starring Alan Arkin as an alcoholic caped crusader accused of communist sympathies during the Red Scare and Christopher Lee as a racist supervillain decked out in BDSM leather.\n\nYou have the chance to visit any movie studio or any movie production at the height of the studio era. Which studio or movie do you pick and why?\n\nI’m guessing by height of the studio era, we’re talking the ’30s and ’40s? I’d probably pick King Kong. The amount of creativity going on in that movie is insane, and it would be super cool to witness firsthand all the work that went into creating it.\n\nWhat do you like best about your favorite film genre?\n\nI’m not sure I have a single favorite film genre, but I do enjoy horror a great deal. The best horror offers up a way to examine the darker parts of humanity– the cruel, the irrational, the absolutely awful– in a creative, even sublime way.\n\nWho are your favorite film critics?\n\nTim Brayton has been my favorite movie critic for years. He has a thorough knowledge of film history and the ability to give rigorous, scholarly analysis without coming off too dry. His sense of humor and selective use of the occasional swear word make him so much fun to read. My favorite thing he ever did is his complete analysis and history of Disney’s animated canon, but he regularly reviews classic and contemporary films. I don’t agree with every take he has, but he always teaches me new ways to look at cinema.\n\nOther movie critics I enjoy are Russell Merritt (okay, he was more of a historian, but critical analysis is a huge component of his work), Imogen Smith, Farran Smith Nehme, and David Bordwell.\n\nAre there any movies you regret reviewing?\n\nI’ve never regretted reviewing anything, though I have deleted a lot of my older, pre-2020s posts on this blog simply because I think my writing has improved immeasurably.\n\nHave you ever changed your opinion of a movie and if so, which movie was it?\n\nThere have been a few movies I changed my mind about on rewatch. Some I’ve discussed on this blog are George Cukor’s Romeo and Juliet and Hitchcock’s Dial M for Murder. I’ve also warmed up to Spartacus, Frenzy, Diaboliques, and Monsieur Verdoux.\n\nThe most dramatic shift in opinion for me was my view of the Star Wars prequels. I used to intensely dislike them, but I think a combination of the existence of the soulless Disney sequels and a closer study of the prequels themselves has made me appreciate them more. I still think the original trilogy hangs together better and I find the CG visuals gaudy, but there’s a lot of ambition on display and the political elements are a lot more interesting to me now than when I was younger. Warts and all, I enjoy them.\n\nWhat are some of the other things you like doing besides blogging?\n\nI read a lot and try to read widely. Recently, I finished Cloud Atlas, an astonishing work. I also enjoy baking, taking walks, and writing fiction. I play video games every now and then, though only older titles from the ’90s and early 2000s.\n\nAre there any movies that you think might make good video games? If you have any interest in video games, that is.\n\nNot any movie specifically, but a dating simulator involving the Universal Horror monsters would be hilariously awesome.\n\nIf you could write about any celeb or other film-related topic, what or who do you write about?\n\nI feel like I could do a whole series on films about the silent era and how many of them are just less than satisfactory in capturing the feel of that era, be it the nickelodeon days, the transitional period of the 1910s, or the artistic heights of the ’20s. I think the endeavor would give me a headache though, even if more recent films on the subject are far more respectful than what was put out in the immediate aftermath of the talkie revolution.\n\nWho do you most enjoy seeing movies with?\n\nIt depends on the movie. I enjoy watching action movies with my dad, who tends to make amusing commentary. I watch horror movies, cult fare, and so-bad-it’s-good films with one of my friends who’s also into that. My sisters are fun to watch just about anything with, especially comedies.\n\nI nominate:\n\nClassic Film and TV Corner\n\nHamlette’s Soliloquy\n\nCritica Retro\n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1. What is the best theatrical experience you have ever had?\n\n2. Any opinions on the future of movie theaters?\n\n3. Is there a universally despised movie you think isn’t so bad?\n\n4. Name a movie you enjoy from a genre you don’t usually like.\n\n5. What do you think your best post to date is?\n\n6. What is your favorite film from 1939?\n\n7. What are some classic film related books you would recommend?\n\n8. What movie has the best cinematography you’ve ever seen?\n\n9. Name an underrated filmmaker/performer/creative in the industry you always champion.\n\n10. Favorite movie soundtrack?\n\n11. What movie are you itching to write about but haven’t yet?\n\nWith its charismatic villain protagonist, political intrigue, and dark humor, Richard III is my favorite Shakespeare play, so it tickles my heart that a 1912 adaptation of it may have been America’s first feature film. I say “may have” because when it comes to film history, hard “firsts” are notoriously difficult to determine. So much of the silent era has become lost to the ravages of nitrate decomposition, but luckily Richard III has been preserved in excellent condition. The print was acquired by film projectionist William Buffum in 1960 and he rewound the film annually in order to prevent the materials from sticking together. It was only when he finally donated the materials to the American Film Institute that he learned of its historical significance.\n\nThe centerpiece of the production is thespian Frederick Warde, who plays the titular role. While forgotten today, he was a prominent stage tragedian in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. As film historian Tracey Goessel put it in her biography of Douglas Fairbanks Sr. (who Warde helped get started as an actor), Warde was a second-tier stage star– not in the same league as a Bernhardt and sneered at by “sophisticated” critics, but popular with a mass audience eager for refined entertainment. English by birth, Warde extensively toured the United States, bringing Shakespeare to the general public outside of the major cultural centers like New York City and Chicago.\n\nMany stage actors viewed motion pictures with disdain, but Warde was enthused by the new technology and sensed its potential as an art form. He would appear in multiple films in the 1910s and a few in the 1920s. Two of his Shakespearean roles were committed to celluloid: first Richard III in this 1912 film and then King Lear in 1917.\n\nAs with contemporary historical feature films like Sarah Bernhardt’s Queen Elizabeth or Helen Gardner’s Cleopatra, Warde’s Richard III was advertised as a major event, brimming with star power and spectacle. While the film industry was still dominated by shorts, features would quickly overtake the market because of the critical and commercial success of work like Richard III. Though Shakespeare’s language is at a decided disadvantage in the realm of silent cinema, reviewers were bowled over by the way motion pictures could expand the insular world of the stage, accommodating touches like large parades of extras on horseback and a full-scale boat on the water during the climax. Here was an epic sense of scope no proscenium could ever hope to capture.\n\nSo how does this Richard III play today? For most, it will only serve as a curio, but I think it’s one of the stronger early film features. It’s certainly hangs together better than even a slightly later feature like DW Griffith’s Judith of Bethulia, if only because the story has enough depth to justify its length. However, it isn’t friendly to non-Shakespeare fans. As with many early film adaptations of popular stage and literary works, Warde’s Richard III assumes its audience is familiar with the source material. Intertitles are mostly descriptive of what we’re about to see, occasionally sprinkling in some lines from Shakespeare’s text.\n\nThough the throughline is simple enough (the ambitious Richard, Duke of Glocuester kills off his relatives and other inconvenient people so he can become King of England, only for his tyrannical behavior to undo him in the end), Richard III is a doozy of a play for anyone to adapt. As popular as it’s remained for almost five hundred years, the actual plot is suffused with dense historical context that can be super confusing to follow if you aren’t familiar with the chronology of England’s Wars of the Roses, which were a series of late medieval civil wars that lasted over three decades. And technically, the play is also part of a larger series of Shakespeare’s history plays about that conflict, preceded by the three-part Henry VI dramas.\n\nHenry VI Part One starts with the funeral of warrior-king Henry V and focuses on the bloodshed following the loss of French territories he conquered during his brief life. The subsequent plays show how his heir, the gentle and religiously devout Henry VI, is unable to control the backstabbing nobles in his court, all vying for power. Eventually, Henry loses his crown to the York faction, led by the soon-to-be Edward IV and his younger brothers George and Richard (soon-to-be Richard III). These three plays have no protagonist, instead working as an ensemble piece with only the titular Henry VI and his conniving Queen Margaret playing major roles in all of them. Part Three is where we finally meet Richard, who quickly steals the show before getting his own play.\n\nThe Henry VI plays were popular in Shakespeare’s day, but they fell out of favor over the years and are seldom performed now. Therefore, Richard III is often performed as a standalone piece and heavily cut down to make it friendlier to audiences unfamiliar with the earlier plays. Later dramatists like Colley Cibber cobbled pieces of Henry VI Part Three into revised versions of Richard III, starting productions with Richard’s murder of Henry VI so audiences could quickly get a sense of what brings the Yorkists to power. Warde’s adaptation does the same, showing the arrest of Henry VI after Edward IV deposes him and then Richard’s grisly assassination of the former monarch in his cell.\n\nThis opening sequence is a marvel in terms of early cinematic technique. When you watch a great amount of films from the 1900s and early 1910s, you may think the film will present us with a static shot of Richard killing Henry before cutting to Edward’s coronation. However, this film does something clever, something that highlights the play’s themes and creates the illusion that the characters are inhabiting a greater world and not just a cramped indoor set. (Okay, it still looks like a cramped indoor set with the bricks painted onto the walls– but you get my meaning!)\n\nRight as Richard pulls his sword out of the king’s body and assesses his latest kill, he crosses the room. Then, the movie cuts to a balcony. Entering from the right, Richard jubilantly leans over the edge and hails Edward IV’s triumphant procession as it passes, as though he wasn’t just putting holes in someone only seconds ago. What a creative illustration of not only Richard’s two-facedness, but the entire Yorkist regime. After all, Henry’s death is not just in Richard’s interest. The old king must be out of the way to legitimize Edward’s rule as well.\n\nWhen you read the Henry VI trilogy before diving into Richard III, it becomes hard to see most of Richard’s victims as 100% guileless. A few are innocents (particularly his young nephews, who he has smothered to clear his way to the crown), but many of them are also ambitious, greedy, and unfaithful. Like many standalone Richard III adaptations, the 1912 film sidesteps this moral gray area, making Richard’s victims equally hapless since the majority of the audience won’t know any better, the Henry VI trilogy being so underseen.\n\nThis Richard III is a one-man show, with Warde stealing each and every moment with his gleeful wickedness and cunning. His joy in manipulation comes through in small gestures, like a sly smirk to the fourth wall as he woos the initially disdainful Anne Neville with false declarations of love to get her to marry him. However, he can be sinister as well. Later on, Anne’s poisoning at Richard’s hands– an act not shown in Shakespeare’s play– is dramatized in one of the film’s strongest scenes. Richard looms over the unconscious Anne as she lays in their unhappy marriage bed, ordering a physician to administer poison to her. The moody lighting casting Richard and his confederate in near-shadow is remarkable.\n\nNot every scene is so eloquently presented. The famous nightmare sequence in which the ghosts Richard’s victims come back to haunt him the night before his final battle with Richmond is done without much imagination in terms of blocking. The double-exposed ghosts just stand off to the side of the sleeping Richard and point at him in one mostly indistinguishable mass. No matter. The film has enough striking moments to compensate.\n\nMilestone films are not necessarily great films and that notion certainly applies here. It is not what I’d call a gateway silent film for the uninitiated, but those fascinated by early cinema and Shakespeare as I am will find it hits the spot. A transitional step between the more tableau-oriented early narrative film and the more sophisticated style of the 1910s, it’s a feast for any lover of cinematic history.\n\nSources:\n\nAmerican Cinema of the 1910s: Themes and Variations, edited by Charlie Keil and Ben Singer\n\nThe First King of Hollywood: The Life of Douglas Fairbanks by Tracey Goessel\n\n“Richard III (1912) – AFI Catalog Spotlight,” on the American Film Institute website\n\nShakespeare on Silent Film: A strange eventful history by Robert Hamilton Ball\n\n“Warde, Frederick B.” on the Thanhouser website\n\nFun fact about me: I read the entire Bible when I was 13 years old. I can’t say it was for any reason beyond a blend of pretentious bibliophilic flexing and boredom.\n\nGrowing up in a Catholic household, our Bible included the apocryphal/deuterocanonical books, which are texts considered sacred by some Christian denominations and not others. Among these works is the Book of Judith, the tale of one badass Jewish widow’s quest to save her people from Assyrian invaders. Her home city of Bethulia beseiged, the titular character dresses in her best clothes, marches over to the enemy’s camp, and bats her eyes at Holofernes, the Assyrian general. He falls for her charms and hopes to bed her. Instead, she gets him drunk, chops off his head while he’s passed out, and throws the whole Assyrian camp into confusion, allowing her people to repel their enemies.\n\nTeenage me was OBSESSED with the Book of Judith. It was up there with Final Fantasy X and all my favorite anime series as far as awesome went for my awkward, nerdy self. I re-read it dozens of times. I still love it and I’m hardly the only one. With its intense drama and heady blend of seduction and slaying, the Book of Judith has been catnip for creators throughout the centuries. Painters have reimagined the beheading of Holofernes over and over, sometimes with strong-armed and determined Judiths and other times with sexy, smirking ones. Dramatists and poets have retold the story as well, among them cinematic pioneer DW Griffith.\n\nJudith of Bethulia is significant in Griffith’s oevure because it was final film for the Biograph company. He had been with Biograph since 1908, churning out popular and influential short films. However, as the 1910s dawned, he grew interested in more complex narratives. He started creating longer shorts like his two-part adaptation of Enoch Arden or the half-hour long The Battle at Elderbrush Gulch. Biograph did not share Griffith’s ambitions, contented with the short films that still dominated the market. This would not be the case for long, as features were becoming more common by the early 1910s. Italian epics like Quo Vadis and Cabiria impressed audiences with their detail and scale. Griffith longed to make such an epic of his own and basically defied the Biograph studio bosses to make the four-reel Judith of Bethulia.\n\nIt’s easy to mock the Biograph company for their inability to see features as anything but a mere fad, yet they were not the only ones reluctant about longer films. Exhibitors were also wary, fearing a single major feature on the bill would destroy the diversity of the usual multi-short program. Variety was seen as key to the moviegoing experience, since film was often perceived as closer to vaudeville than the “legitimate theater.” The naysayers underestimated how features could be sold as an elevated breed of entertainment. As Eileen Bowser pointed out in her study of this transitional period, “Attending a movie theater where only short films were shown was an everyday affair, but attending a feature was a special event.” That is, a feature film could be an evening’s entertainment, much like a stage production.\n\nWith the need for more complicated narratives to fill out the runtime of these features, filmmakers turned to the stage for stories. For his first feature, Griffith chose Thomas Aldrich’s stage adaptation Judith of Bethulia as his subject. The play held personal significance for him since during his theatrical period, he worked in the theater company of none other than Nance O’Neil, a tragedienne christened “the American Bernhardt.” Among O’Neil’s major roles was the lead in Judith. Perhaps choosing Judith as a subject– beyond its potential for battle scenes and historical detail– was Griffith’s way of challenging the theater snobs with the growing power of cinema.\n\nJudith‘s production was a challenge for all involved. Extras were responsible for their own costumes and false beards, and often had to play multiple roles to create the illusion of teeming armies and massive crowds. Sweet’s flimsy costume couldn’t protect her legs when she was riding a horse. The non-imposing Henry B. Walthall was chosen to play the ferocious Holofernes, necessitating cameraman Billy Bitzer to arrange careful camera set-ups to achieve the desired effect. According to Griffith biographer Richard Schickel, the cast and crew bore everything with grace because they were excited to be part of such an epic production.\n\nFilming was completed in 1913, but Biograph– alarmed by the hefty $36,000 price tag and Griffith’s insubordination– delayed release for a year. By that point, Griffith had left the company for more artistically fulfilling pastures, taking much of his personnel with him. As Sweet said in an interview for the 1980 Kevin Brownlow documentary Hollywood, the actors and crew’s loyalty was to Griffith, not Biograph. In the end, Biograph would barely outlast Griffith’s departure. By 1916, the company was no longer producing new material and they would close shop in 1918. Coasting off old successes, Biograph would re-release Judith with unused footage and additional intertitles in 1917, rechristening the production with the suggestive title Her Condoned Sin.\n\nApart from the interesting context, how is the actual film? To be honest, handsome but underwhelming.\n\nWhen I first saw it early in my cinephilia, I didn’t have much to compare it to in terms of pre-1915 feature films. Having since seen Cabiria and Griffith’s other early features from the 1913-1914 period, it doesn’t stack up as well. I can make a few allowances for it considering this was the first attempt at a feature for Griffith, but I do have issues with the film beyond technical quibbling.\n\nOkay, some good things first. One element that sticks out about Judith is Griffith’s attempt to make Bethulia more than just a movie set plunked in the San Fernando Valley. The opening twenty minutes feature plenty of little scenes showing the townspeople going about their lives. These are not faceless pawns, but likable, vulnerable human beings about to be put in harm’s way by a foreign army. Several subplots are established in these early moments: the most prominent of these minor characters are a young mother with an infant (Lillian Gish) and a pair of young lovers (Mae Marsh and Bobby Harron). While Griffith could not replicate the exact scale of the Italian epics, he wanted to still make the conflict feel grand in scope by creating the illusion of a vibrant community in peril. Not exactly a breakthrough for Griffith– he did much the same in The Battle at Elderbrush Gulch— but still a point in the movie’s favor.\n\nBlanche Sweet is also very good in the lead role. It’s crazy to think she was still in her teens when taking on such a mature part. She exudes the necessary zeal and courage… though the writing undercuts her work just a bit, but more on that later.\n\nThe battle sequences are less impressive. They’re overstuffed and messy. It’s impossible to tell what’s going on or who is who. The most emotion one gets from the fight scenes are reaction shots from Judith, teeming with rage and anxiety as she prays for victory. These are my favorite scenes of Judith’s, because they show the ferocity and passion simmering beneath her placid piety. This is the biblical Judith, the one you don’t mess with lest you end up inches shorter.\n\nUnfortunately, this warrior side of Judith evaporates once she goes on her mission to slay Holofernes as the character’s motivation becomes muddied beyond belief. Taking cues from 19th century dramatists who saw the biblical Judith as a heartless monster that needed “womanizing” to be viable onstage, Griffith tries to make Judith more complicated by having her romantically tempted by Holofernes. While I personally don’t care for this idea, it could be done well– if you give Judith credible reasons for wanting some Assyrian hunk or make Holofernes himself a more nuanced character. Griffith doesn’t do either.\n\nLet’s examine how Griffith establishes his heroine’s characterization. Judith is a devout Jew and a maternal figure for her people. Her love of them is so fierce that she risks her life by going into enemy territory to seduce and kill the enemy leader. So far, so good.\n\nBut wait! When Judith meets Holofernes and he gives her free stuff (a tent, a eunuch to wait on her every need), he “becomes noble in her eyes.”\n\nNoble? Giving hot women tents and a eunuch in a towel suddenly makes you “noble”? In what universe?\n\nIt would be one thing if Holofernes actually did something actually noble like, I don’t know, show mercy, even if only to a single person, suggesting some capacity for compassion. Or if he showed any remorse for his ruthless actions against Bethulia’s population. Or if he handed out kittens to an orphanage. I don’t know. I’m not an expert in the realm of romance, but surely a religiously devout woman who’s seen babies starving due to Holofernes’ orders wouldn’t have her head turned by a free tent.\n\nWe get a lot of scenes of Judith wringing her hands over this incredible dilemma, intercut with Holofernes no longer able to pay attention to his mini-court of sexy dancers. There isn’t much chemistry between Sweet and Wathall, and Judith has no legitimate reason to “love” Holofernes, so much of the movie just drags. It’s true Griffith favored the broad strokes of melodrama even in his artier work, but here, there’s nothing compelling about any of the drama, even in the realm of potboiler passion. The feature never justifies its length, coming off as a two-reeler stretched to the breaking point.\n\nPart of me fears I’m being too harsh. This was an early attempt at a feature film. That it’s an awkward effort is to be expected. To quote Richard Schickel, Judith represents “a noble ambition, not a fully realized one.” Or maybe I’m just too much of a Judith fangirl to be satisfied.\n\nMy meh view of the film tends to be shared by modern film geeks, but in its day, critics were impressed by Judith of Bethulia. It was a milestone in American feature filmmaking and contemporary audience response reflects that. One anecdote in particular always sticks out to me when I think about this film. Griffith’s old colleague Nance O’Neil came by when the cast and crew were filming interior scenes in Judith’s house. Blanche Sweet was about to do her big mourning scene in sackcloth and ashes. Griffith offered to show O’Neil what moviemaking was like and before the cameras started rolling, he whispered to Sweet, “Show her.” That is, show her the movies are as legitimate a form of art as the theater.\n\nJudith of Bethulia was a major part of the collective effort of Edwardian era filmmakers to prove that and then some. While everyone involved would move onto greener pastures, it was a necessary transitional film and it remains an influential one, even if I prefer my Judith adaptations without Judith/Holofernes love stories in them.\n\nSources:\n\nAdventures with DW Griffith by Karl Brown\n\nDW Griffith: An American Life by Richard Schickel\n\nHollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film (dir. Kevin Brownlow and David, Gil, 1980)\n\n“Judith of Bethulia,” https://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/J/JudithOfBethulia1914.html\n\nThe Transformation of Cinema, 1907-1915 by Eileen Bowser\n\nThis post is for the Third Marathon Stars blogathon, hosted by The Wonderful World of Cinema, In the Good Old Days of Classic Hollywood, and Musings of a Classic Film Addict.\n\nAnna May Wong was one of the first Asian-American movie stars. Born Liu Tsong Wong in 1905 to a San Francisco family of second-generation Chinese immigrants, she was an avid film fan as a child. Dreaming of stardom, she secured her first job as an extra in the 1919 Alla Nazimova film The Red Lantern. By the early 1920s, her name was known to film fans due to her distinctive screen presence and youthful beauty, but due to the racist attitudes of the time, Wong’s stardom was often stunted. Due to concerns about miscegenation, she could only kiss her leading man if he was the same race as she. Major roles she was perfect for often went to white actresses by default, even if the character in question was Asian. And often times the roles she did land were either small or stereotypical.\n\nWong has experienced something of a re-evaluation recently– she’s become the first Asian-American on US currency and several books, both fiction and non-fiction, have been published about her in the last few years– but she still isn’t universally known, even among classic film fans. When two fellow classic film fans I know in real life saw me reading a biography about her, they told me they’d never even heard her name. Some critics continue to disparage her as a “dragon lady” who took demeaning roles for a paycheck. Others see her as a trailblazer who fought as hard as she could for better onscreen representation of Chinese and Chinese-descended characters at a time when Hollywood felt no compulsion to offer such.\n\nI’d been aware of Wong for years, though I never knew much about her life or work outside of a few key silent films. She often appears in movie magazines of the 1920s, presented as a madcap flapper in the latest fashions. For this marathon, I read biographical material on Wong while I went through my selected five films to give extra context to her work.\n\nOkay, I do have a confession to make. The maximum number of films you’re allowed to have seen with your selected star is three. When I signed up, I could only come up with three films I knew I had seen with Wong: The Toll of the Sea, The Thief of Bagdad, and Shanghai Express. I felt this blogathon would be a great opportunity to see some Wong pictures that had been on my watchlist for a while now, like Piccadilly and Daughter of Shanghai. It wasn’t until I combed through Wong’s IMDB page weeks later– after watching three of the five prescribed films and reading an entire biography– that I realized she was also in the 1924 Peter Pan, Mr. Wu, and Old San Francisco, three movies I vaguely recall watching as a college undergrad. And by vaguely recall, I mean I only know I saw two out of three of them because they’re logged on my IMDB account. As for Peter Pan, apparently she was Tiger Lily in that (I don’t recall a thing about her performance there), but all I remember from that film was that Ernest Torrance was Captain Hook and that the Darlings’ dog Nana looked like a Cthulu-esque abomination.\n\nAhem. Anyway, even if I don’t meet the hard letter of the “3 films max” rule, I still say I fit the spirit. I can recall exactly three performances of Anna May Wong’s, no more than that. I may as well have had those other films erased from my memory, except for…\n\nWith that out of the way, here are the films I actually remembering seeing with Wong before the blogathon, as well as a brief overview of her life and career threaded throughout:\n\nThe Toll of the Sea was not Wong’s big break as a movie star (that would belong to the anthology film Bits of Life, where she played opposite Lon Chaney), but it is the film that cemented her fame. The second Technicolor feature film, the movie’s story is nothing special, just a retelling of the Madame Butterfly story set in China instead of Japan. If anything elevates it above being a mere historical curiosity, it’s Wong’s tender performance as a seduced and abandoned young woman.\n\nWong was still in her teens when she made this film, so her performance is not as polished as her later work. However, she is still sensitive and touching, emphasizing the tragedy of Lotus Blossom’s situation as a woman shunned by her own culture for pursuing a relationship with a white man and similarly rejected by the white Americans for her ethnicity. Wong’s girlishly humorous moments in the first half of the movie only throw the constant grief and pain of the latter part into harsher relief. (At the time, Wong’s crying scenes were considered noteworthy both among critics and in Hollywood. As it turned out, Wong was one of a select number of actors who could cry on cue.) In the end, Wong walks away with the film, an impressive feat considering how young she was.\n\nUnfortunately, a leading role in one hit film did not mean Wong was suddenly going to be headlining tons of movies. Throughout the 1920s, her Hollywood career largely saw her in supporting parts, many of them steeped in orientalist stereotyping. The Thief of Bagdad is considered among her more memorable roles in this period, even if it’s a relatively minor one in the context of such a grand fantasy epic and is still stereotypical in nature. Wong plays a beautiful Mongolian slave girl in the Bagdad palace. While she is supposed to serve the princess, she conspires with the ambitious Mongolian prince (Sojin) to overthrow the Bagdad royals. It’s not much of a part and a lesser actress would have been overtaken by the character’s crazy costume and hairpieces, but Wong lends a playful sensual dimension to the role, particularly in a sequence where Fairbanks’ thief has a knife at her back. Wong’s response oscillates between fear and flirtation, using erotic charm to get herself out of the situation, not realizing Fairbanks has already left the room.\n\nThroughout the mid-1920s, Wong continued to act, though the roles weren’t getting any better. In the late 1920s, Wong grew weary of the situation and leapt across the Atlantic to seek better opportunities in Europe. Black Americans like Josephine Baker and Paul Robeson had done the same, finding less racial barriers abroad. Like Robeson, Wong mostly worked in England after a brief stint in Germany. When the talkie revolution swept through the movie industry, Wong worked on her vocal delivery and was able to make the transition with little trouble. In the early 1930s, more famous than ever due to her European journey, Wong decided to give Hollywood another go. She landed a contract with Paramount.\n\nOne of the better roles she got during this period was the prostitute Hui-Fei in Josef von Sternberg’s 1932 potboiler Shanghai Express. Having rewatched the film recently, I have two conclusions: 1) this movie is absolutely style over substance and 2) Wong walks away with the entire thing. The actual main storyline about Marlene Dietrich’s Shanghai Lily and her devotion to the stuffy nitwit doctor played by Clive Brook is melodramatic boilerplate only elevated to classic status by Dietrich’s charisma and the smoky, glamorous atmosphere of Von Sternberg’s direction.\n\nOf all the characters, Wong’s is the only one who measures up to Dietrich in any way. The two women play off one another well due to a shared sense of cynicism towards a world that looks down on them as “fallen women.” However, just as Lily’s self-sacrificial love for Dr. Harvey reveals nobility beneath her “bad girl” persona, Hui-Fei displays similar hidden depths. She has her own sense of honor and obligation, viewing the Eurasian rebel leader Henry Chang played by Warner Oland as a menace to her country (“The government has offered a price of 20,000 for his capture – alive or dead. It will be a great day for China when that price is paid.”) and ultimately killing him after he rapes her. When Lily thanks her– Chang was going to force Lily to become his mistress in exchange for her beloved’s life– Hui-Fei makes it clear she didn’t kill Chang for Lily’s sake, but for her own.\n\nUnfortunately, Hollywood continued to be stingy with good roles for Wong. The greatest heartbreak of her career was being rejected for the role of O-lan in MGM’s The Good Earth, an adaptation of the Pearl Buck novel of the same name. The tale of the hard lives of Chinese farmers, this was a film that largely treated the Chinese with sympathy, yet the major roles were claimed by white actors. Wong was refused the part because her leading man would be Paul Muni (a Jewish actor who initially quipped “I’m about as Chinese as Herbert Hoover” when offered the role) and the Production Code forbade actors of different races from kissing on-screen. Luise Rainer got the role instead.\n\nWong largely worked in B-pictures as the decade wore on. In the late 1930s, she visited China, a longtime dream of hers. However, she was shocked when her reception in China was rather cool, sometimes even hostile. Chinese critics felt Wong was a disgrace, taking on stereotypical and sexualized roles that made Chinese womanhood appear loose and wicked. Wong understood the criticism– she shared it herself– but it still stung, especially since she often fought for better representation of Chinese and Chinese-American characters in Hollywood projects.\n\nDuring World War II, Wong appeared in propaganda films showing the Chinese in a heroic light and did all she could to support the war effort, but her stardom was on the wane. When her Paramount contract lapsed, it was not renewed and she was stuck making films for poverty row studios. Still, Wong worked hard and donated her salary to organizations like United China Relief.\n\nIn the immediate postwar period, Wong stopped working in the movies for a few years. She converted her home into a series of apartments for rent. She returned to film in 1949, appearing in a small role in the movie Impact. Throughout the 1950s, she worked in television. This work was initially promising: Wong got the lead in her own series, The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong, the first TV program to feature an Asian-American protagonist. A mystery show, it lasted only ten episodes before cancellation. Like much early television, the program is now lost. For the rest of the decade, she had to settle for supporting parts.\n\nWong was unfortunately an alcoholic in her later life and this contributed to her early death of a heart attack at age 56. What makes her ultimate end so tragic is that she may have been on the verge of a comeback. She was offered the role of Madame Liang in the film version of Flower Drum Song, but had to decline due to her poor health.\n\nMy general impression of Wong from the above three films and my reading about her life is that she was a beautiful actress with great presence too often under-served by the material she was given. For my five films, I tried to select films from a variety of genres, as well as from different phases of her career in order to get a fuller picture of her talents and screen image.\n\nDaughter of Shanghai (dir. Robert Florey, 1937)\n\nWhen antiques dealer Mr. Lang (John Patterson) refuses to aid a human smuggling ring, he and his daughter Lan Ying Lin (Wong) end up kidnapped by the villains. They shoot Lang dead, but Lan Ying Lin manages to escape. Swearing justice for her father’s death, she goes undercover to track down the smugglers’ leader, disguising herself as a dancer to infiltrate a dive on a Central American island. She crosses paths with Kim Lee (Philip Ahn), a G-man also on the trail of the criminal gang. The two become reluctant allies, all the while never suspecting the ringleader– and the one who most wants to see them dead– might be someone they know and trust…\n\nBy the late 1930s, Wong was mostly relegated to B-movies. While lacking the clout of A-pictures, some of my favorite movies from the classic period are B-productions as they often had more freedom to experiment or portray things you wouldn’t see in a more expensive movie that needed to be “safe” in order to return the hefty investment. Daughter of Shanghai is one of the most enjoyable B-movies you’re likely to find, not just for its delightfully pulpy narrative but also for its progressive depiction of Asian-Americans as heroes.\n\nWong plays a true badass in this movie. She’s smart, she’s independent, and she doesn’t take anyone’s crap. Wong herself was reportedly delighted with the role, happy to play a Chinese-American who wasn’t treacherous or shady, but openly noble and brave. She makes a great team with Philip Ahn’s G-man, and it’s also great to see her allowed to have a romantic relationship with another character that doesn’t end in misery and/or death.\n\nThe film itself is a delightful ride with all the pulp trimmings: near-death situations, last-minute escapes, dangerous traveling conditions, fistfights. The story is almost paced like a condensed movie serial and it’s never dull. Robert Florey was in the director’s chair, so there’s style to burn. Interestingly, though this film was made while the Production Code was in full force, it often has the feel of a pre-code melodrama due to its emphasis on seduction and potent danger.\n\nThere’s no denying this film is a low budget affair. Shot in a month, it’s hardly a Von Sternberg arthouse object. I don’t care. This movie is a hell of a lot of fun and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great evening watch when they want to be entertained but don’t have two hours to burn. There are lengthy, expensive Netflix series which don’t have the entertainment value this thing does.\n\nDaughter of the Dragon (dir. Lloyd Corrigan, 1931)\n\nExotic dancer Princess Ling Moy (Wong) discovers her long-lost father is none other than the notorious Fu Manchu (Warner Oland). Before they have time to do any normal father-daughter bonding activities, he is mortally wounded while killing his nemesis, Sir John Petrie, who he wrongly believes was responsible for the death of his family during the Boxer Rebellion. As he lies dying, Fu Manchu makes Ling Moy promise to kill the rest of the Petrie clan as revenge for their own slaughtered loved ones. Ling Moy swears to fulfill her father’s last request, but her quest for revenge will be complicated by her burgeoning romantic feelings for Petrie’s son Ronald (Bramwell Fletcher) and the efforts of Chinese detective Ah Kee (Sessue Hayakawa).\n\nDaughter of the Dragon was Wong’s first movie under her Paramount contract. In terms of Asian representation, Daughter of the Dragon is the polar opposite of Daughter of Shanghai. This earlier film is far more negative, depicting Ling Moy as a seductress out to snap up clueless white men and murder/mutilate any love rivals without mercy. I cannot imagine Wong was too happy with this film, considering her dismay at the continued Hollywood-approved stereotyping of Chinese people as wicked deceivers.\n\nAdmittedly, the film does have camp value, not unlike the similarly orientalist The Mask of Fu Manchu with Boris Karloff. The production is dripping with over the top Chinese-inspired design and Ling Moy’s costumes are eye-catching. It’s clear the film’s main purpose is not exploration of character or theme, but providing the audience with vicarious thrills and chills as our “heroes” (I cannot put enough quotes around that word, since the so-called good guys are universally boring and mostly passive– also I do not get why Ling Moy is so into Ronald, he’s about as sexy as soggy fish and chips) evade gruesome yet creative death traps. This is certainly a case where the bad guys steal the show, simply because they have so much more drive and seem to be having so much more fun.\n\nThe best I can say about Daughter of the Dragon is that it never drags and Wong never phones it in, though the material is undeniably beneath her. Wong is able to give her character fleeting glimmers of melancholy. You get the sense Ling Moy’s wanted a father figure all her life and once she’s given one, she dedicates herself to pleasing him to fill that void– even if pleasing him means committing multiple murders. This makes Ling Moy a bit more human than she likely was on paper, but it’s not enough to really combat the nonsense in the script or to magically make the movie good. I can’t say I recommend it, but it has its moments in a so bad it’s funny kind of way.\n\nLady from Chungking (dir. William Nigh, 1942)\n\nKwan Mei (Wong) is the leader of a band of Chinese freedom fighters. Surrounded by the occupying Japanese on all sides, they bide their time in a peasant village. One day, a pair of American pilots are shot down near the village and captured by the Japanese. Seeing potential allies, Kwan Mei plans to rescue them as well as gather information about the plans of the invaders. Learning the Japanese leader General Kaimura (Hans Huber) has a taste for refined women, Kwan Mei poses as an aristocrat sympathetic to the occupiers in order to seduce any big plans out of him. Will she succeed?\n\nDuring World War II, Wong was ardent about supporting the war effort, particularly through sending aid to the Chinese through organizations like United China Relief, participating in USO entertainments, and of course appearing in Allied propaganda. However, these films were for Producers Releasing Corporation, a poverty row studio. This effectively marked the beginning of the end of her movie career. The silver lining is that Wong got to play heroic figures.\n\nWhile it’s no Casablanca, Lady from Chungking is a solid programmer, though nothing especially memorable. The comic relief is unbearably corny, such as when one of the American pilots narrates a baseball game in his sleep, much to Kwan Mei’s confusion. Characters are mostly underdeveloped and the story moves swiftly, which works for the movie’s adventure/thriller elements but less so for the interesting tensions that are left unexplored. General Kamimura is a fervent classist, sneering at the Chinese peasants and only taking an interested in aristocratic women as his bedmates. He loses all interest in Mae Clarke’s Russian opportunist when she reveals she is not a noblewoman in exile, but all but jumps onto Kwan Mei when she passes herself as a Chinese aristocrat. Playing on the general’s fantasies and sense of cultural superiority, Kwan Mei is able to charm information out of him, but this sexual entanglement also puts her at odds with her own people, who begin to wonder if Kwan Mei’s loyalty can be cancelled out by the luxury of being a Japanese officer’s mistress.\n\nNone of this goes anywhere interesting, but at only an hour, the film never overstays its welcome and Wong commands the screen easily. She cuts a noble figure and even gets an inspirational speech at the end. Her character is not a damsel needing to be rescued by the brave Americans, but an active heroine in her own right, as are the other Chinese characters. Plus, it’s always great to see Mae Clarke, another actress who deserved a better career than what she ultimately received.\n\nWhen Were You Born (dir. William McGann, 1938)\n\nAstrology expert Mei Lee Ling (Wong) finds herself flocked to during an ocean liner trip to San Francisco. Passengers react to her character readings and predictions with amazement and skepticism, but no one expects her most sensational prediction to come true: that one of the passengers will be dead within two days. When the very man turns up dead in that time frame, Mei is approached by the police. They suspect her, but instead she offers her aid in sniffing out the real culprit by using her knowledge of astrological signs.\n\nWhen Were You Born was intended to be the start of a mystery film series starring Anna May Wong as a Zodiac expert who solves crimes by analyzing suspects based on their astrological sign. This would not come to be as the film didn’t make much of an impact. As much as I have come to love Wong during this marathon, I can see why the series never panned out, because this movie milks its gimmick dry before the slim runtime even ticks down. Much of the film is just Wong explaining everyone’s Zodiac sign and then telling the cops why this or that person did or didn’t do this or that crime because of that sign. The only things that held my interest was Wong’s lovely wardrobe and poised manner.\n\nI don’t really have too much to say about this film. The camerawork is rote, the characters are one-dimensional, and it doesn’t help that I’m not that fond of mysteries as a genre. However, perusing reviews, I noticed that people who are into astrology tend to think this is a cute trifle, so your mileage will definitely vary.\n\nPiccadilly (dir. E.A. Dupont, 1929)\n\nLondon nightclub owner Valentine Wilmot (Jameson Thomas) has a bit of a dilemma. His biggest draw is the dance team Mabel and Vic. The problem is that Vic has been harassing Mabel (Gilda Gray) to extend their partnership into the romantic realm, despite her constant rebuffs and entanglement with Wilmot. Called out for his unprofessional conduct, Vic quits before he can be fired. Mabel tries to go solo but Vic was the more popular of the two, meaning Wilmot needs a new act to reel customers back in. Enter Shosho (Wong), a young scullery maid with dreams of dancing. Her eastern-inspired act is a hit, cementing Mabel’s fall from grace. When it looks as though Shosho has a grip on Wilmot’s affections as well, Mabel becomes desperate. However, she finds Shosho is unwilling to give up her hard-earned fame and romance.\n\nModern consensus is that Piccadilly features Anna May Wong’s finest performance. Her final silent film, it is a great showcase for how technically dazzling late-period silents were. Though the top-billed star is Gilda Gray, the film is Wong’s show all the way.\n\nOn paper, the plot of Piccadilly is basic backstage melodrama: an older woman (and by “older,” I mean just past the impossibly ancient age of 25– Gilda Gray was in her late twenties when filming this, though she was made to look a bit older) with a waning showbiz career contends with a hot young thing looking to take her place in the limelight. However, the characters are given more depth than you’d expect and there are no clear-cut heroes or villains. Mabel’s career is threatened by ageist attitudes and the fickle tastes of her public while Shosho is up against rampant racism. Both women are sympathetic, and both are capable of pettiness and cruelty.\n\nShosho’s situation is handled with great delicacy. A less inspired movie would have made her a simple femme fatale, but Piccadilly emphasizes that Shosho is not a cold-hearted villainess but a young woman from a lower class background who craves luxury and excitement. Her introduction is one of the most brilliant quick-sketches of a character I’ve ever seen. Shosho dances slowly and sensually atop a table, mesmerizing her fellow scullery workers. When the camera lingers on her legs, we see her tattered stockings. This shot is not merely erotic, but also a keen insight into how dance is a brief escape from Shosho’s dreary everyday life. For a moment, she can transcend being a dishwasher. When she finally makes it big as a dancer and rapturously reads the positive reviews in the newspaper, Wong makes Shosho’s girlish delight so palpable that it’s impossible not to empathize with her.\n\nOf course, Shosho is not a saint. As evidenced by her interactions with Mabel, she can be catty. She also strings along her boyfriend Jim (King Hou Chang), expecting him to be content with taking a backseat while she pursues a relationship with another man. Though she does seem genuinely fond of him, she certainly takes his loyalty for granted and is not above emasculating him, such as when she demands he model her skimpy dancer’s costume for Wilmont.\n\nShosho’s youthful beauty and appeal to the white British audience’s taste for the “exotic” is able to propel her to fame, but her ethnicity still provides roadblocks. Shosho and Wilmot share a mutual attraction, but dare not make their romance public. The two see a racially mixed couple shamed at a bar, a foretaste of what could happen to them should they take a chance on their relationship. Shosho’s dismayed reaction to the fiasco shows her interest in Wilmont is not merely that of a gold-digger.\n\nOverall, Piccadilly is a fantastic film, almost a proto-noir with its shadowy aesthetic and complicated morality. The ironic ending is particularly a punch to the gut. If you’ve never seen a silent film before or if you’ve only seen silent comedy and want to dip your toes into silent drama, this is a great gateway title. But even more so, it’s a great gateway to Wong’s dramatic skills.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAfter this marathon, I came away with greater respect for Wong, both as an actress and as a person. Hollywood truly did this woman dirty. She could handle drama and comedy with ease. She had a lovely speaking voice. She had great command of her body and an expressive face. Top all that with her undeniable beauty and it’s a crime she was not offered the same opportunities as white actresses of similar caliber.\n\nOf the five movies I marathoned, my favorite was probably Daughter of Shanghai due to Wong playing a badass who doesn’t have to die tragically and just the overall pulpy vibe of the film. Piccadilly is a close second with its noirish intrigue and complicated characters. Lady from Chungking is pretty good for what it is, while When Were You Born is forgettable and Daughter of the Dragon is a tough sell unless you’re looking for something to give the MST3K treatment.\n\nDespite the limits the film industry imposed upon her, Wong took nothing lying down. I admire her for her steadfastness in fighting for better, less demeaning roles, even if she did not win every battle. She was often the high point of many a film and deserves her rediscovery.\n\nSources:\n\nAnna May Wong: From Laundryman’s Daughter to Hollywood Legend by Graham Russell Gao Hodges\n\nBackwards and in Heels: The past, present, and future of women working in film by Alicia Malone\n\nPiccadilly audio commentary by Farran Smith Nehme\n\nThis post is for the 10th Annual Buster Keaton Blogathon hosted by Silentology. Go over to her blog for more Buster goodness.\n\nGenerally, no one has ever called Buster Keaton’s time at MGM the high point of his career. Depending on your opinion of his Columbia shorts, you may or may not rank it the worst, with the exception of a few films that range from pretty great (The Cameraman) to lowkey charming (The Passionate Plumber and Speak Easily). But then there’s also Free and Easy and What? No Beer!, two movies I consider absolutely painful to sit through.\n\nSpite Marriage is hardly the worst of the MGM Keaton films, but its reputation has often been contested. His final silent feature, it represented a turning point for the star and not just in it being a farewell to the medium that cemented his fame. His creative control, maintained in The Cameraman due to the on-location shooting in New York City giving him some distance from the studio bigwigs, began to waver in earnest once the filming was situated closer to home. You can see that loss in quite a few places: the encroaching dimwittedness of the “Elmer” character as opposed to the awkward but resourceful underdogs Keaton tended to play, the cringe-inducing verbal humor (here limited to intertitles since this is a silent film after all), and a complicated plot encumbered by too many cooks hovering over the soup pot. And yet, the film also features some of the most iconic Keaton sequences of all time. It also has one of his most memorable leading ladies. It’s hard to overlook that.\n\nSpite Marriage‘s plot lacks the more natural, elegant construction of Keaton’s independent features. It is essentially a film of two tenuously connected halves. The first half is romantic farce, rooted in misunderstandings and petty behavior. Elmer (Buster Keaton), a lowly pants-presser, pines after stage star Trilby Drew (Dorothy Sebastian). Essentially a benign stalker, he “borrows” fine clothes from his well-to-do customers to follow Trilby at all her social outings, watching her from afar. He regularly attends her current hit play, a Civil War melodrama titled Carolina. The play is a mawkish thing in which a southern belle is forced to offer her virtue to a sleazy Union officer in exchange for the life of her Confederate sweetheart. However, Elmer treats it like the highest art, applauding every moment (at least, every one of Trilby’s moments– he sits out when the audience applauds the show’s hero) and memorizing all the dialogue.\n\nOnstage, Trilby is noble and tenderhearted, a demure angel in white crinoline. In real life, she’s cold, calculating, and spiteful. Her leading man and offstage lover Lionel Benmore (Edward Earle) ditches her for a society woman, leaving Trilby in a rage. Having taken note of the smitten Elmer for some time now and believing he’s a millionaire, she proposes marriage to him to get back at her former beau. Elmer naturally accepts without hesitation. When Trilby eventually realizes she’s married a “nobody” with no money and no prospects (a realization that occurs offscreen for some reason), her agent arranges a quick divorce, leaving Elmer stunned and disillusioned.\n\nWhile not typical of a Keaton film, the basics of this part of the story are pretty solid. Had you not told me this was a silent Buster Keaton vehicle, I’d think this could be a 1930s screwball comedy. The seeds are certainly there: the conflict between the haves and have-nots, belligerent sexual tension, farcical tropes. Unfortunately, the movie doesn’t much milk the dynamic between Elmer and Trilby as much as it could have. You’d think Elmer would have to make more effort to hide the fact that he isn’t rolling in money, but this never happens. There’s no suspense, a quality not out of place in Keaton’s other classics, where tension heightens the comedy.\n\nThat’s not to say there’s nothing of value in the first half– far from it. The scene where Keaton stands in for a minor actor in Carolina is a hoot, with Elmer consistently undermining the drama of the onstage action. And then there’s the glorious “drunk bride” sequence, an iconic piece of Keatonian comedy if ever there was one. Trilby gets hammered when she sees her ex at a club, and then collapses when she and Elmer return to their hotel room after the disastrous event. Ever the gentleman, Elmer tries to maneuver Trilby into the bed so she can sleep the booze off, but physics conspire against him.\n\nThis scene is so classic that Keaton reused it in live shows with his third wife Eleanor in the 1940s and 1950s, and William Wyler would do his own variation of it with Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday. This makes it all the more shocking that MGM wanted the scene cut, finding it in poor taste. Given the situation, it’s easy to imagine a less innocent version of this sequence, particularly the moment when Elmer tries getting Trilby out of her clothes but can’t quite manage it. However, there is nothing perverse in that act, as it’s clear Elmer just wants his bride to nestle into a cozy slumber. The moment he’s satisfied with her position, he chastely kisses her forehead and leaves for his separate sleeping quarters. It’s a total inversion of the scene Elmer was asked to enact onstage, where he played a villainous figure that plants a lecherous kiss on Trilby’s character as she lies unconscious in his arms.\n\nOn a related note, Dorothy Sebastian deserves to be commended, not just for the physical ability she shows in this scene alongside Buster, but for her delightfully nasty performance in general. I know some people don’t like this character at all. Personally, I love the bitchiness. It’s refreshing. Keaton’s leading women have a bit more variety to them than critics claim, with some colder than others, but none have as explosive a personality as Trilby. Her goals reach beyond waiting for Elmer to prove himself and as with the best Keaton leading ladies, she is allowed to be a comic partner and not just a romantic goal to be won. The two have stellar chemistry as well, likely a by-product of the offscreen affair between the two actors.\n\nAfter the highlight of the entire film comes the second half, what I like to call The Navigator Remix, as it also involves Buster and his leading lady stranded alone at sea. After Trilby leaves Elmer, he gets kidnapped by rum-runners in a rather contrived sequence of events. Briefly shanghaied by the criminals, Elmer falls off the ship when a yacht happens to be passing by. Elmer is rescued and gratefully accepts a post on the yacht, only to discover Trilby and Lionel are among the passengers. A fire breaks out in the boiler room and in the mad scuffle, everyone but Elmer and Trilby abandons ship. Elmer valiantly puts out the fire, unaware of the evacuation, and Trilby is passed out.\n\nWhen the two reunite, Elmer is embittered and treats Trilby coldly, at one point even removing himself from her embrace out of heartbroken resentment. Dramatically, this is a fascinating moment because it’s rare to see Buster this hurt and vulnerable onscreen, let alone angry. The savage fight in Battling Butler is his fiercest moment in a film, but here, the anger is simmering and sour. As with the despairing sink to the sand in The Cameraman, this scene shows how good a dramatic actor Keaton was when given the opportunity.\n\nThe two are not left alone for long, as the rum-runners return and board the ship. Elmer tries to hide Trilby, but she is soon discovered by the captain and his interest in this unexpected guest is less than savory. Ultimately, it’s up to Elmer to rescue Trilby from the bad guys. Once again, what marvels about this climax is how angry Elmer gets. And here, the comparisons to Battling Butler are even more apt, as Elmer gets savage as he engages in fisticuffs with the villain. These dramatic flourishes are striking in what is otherwise a very silly farce. Keaton’s heroics here are also a great contrast to how shrimpy MGM chose to portray him in subsequent films. Much like The Cameraman, Spite Marriage offers up an alternate vision for the kinds of scenarios MGM could have put Keaton in, instead of the stagey farces and leaden Jimmy Durante team-ups they ultimately offered up.\n\nSpite Marriage would prove a hit, with exhibitors reporting mirthful audiences and MGM satisfied with the box office intake. Today, Spite Marriage is easy to criticize and I’ve always felt it was a case of a movie with its parts being better than the whole. The narrative feels very disjointed and the overly broad pre-recorded soundtrack accompanying the film is annoying as hell in spots. However, the movie has a lot to recommend it. Sebastian is a unique leading lady for Buster and a lot of the humor still works in the classic Keaton mode.\n\nAlso, Buster is super sexy in that captain’s hat.\n\nLike DAMN. Instantly the greatest movie of all time. Citizen Kane what? Jeanne Dielmann who?\n\nSources:\n\nBuster Keaton: A Filmmaker’s Life by James Curtis\n\nBuster Keaton: The Persistence of Comedy by Imogen Sara Smith"
