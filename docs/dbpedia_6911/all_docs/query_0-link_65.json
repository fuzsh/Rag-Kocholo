        "text": "When embarking on my research project about Mary Pickford, a trailblazer in the early years of Hollywood cinema, I began by scouring the internet and USC library sites for scholarly articles. In doing so, I found a comprehensive information index on her life, career, and achievements. This foundational research phase was illuminating and laid the groundwork for the eventual website I would create. When researching potential websites I could utilize to build my site, I eventually landed on GoDaddy. My choice of website was perfect for the assignment format due to its flexible user interface. GoDaddy’s intuitive website builder offered a seamless experience of well-structured content.\n\nOnce I settled on the construction of my project, I used a combination of primary and secondary sources. Some of these references included videos, photographs, and articles to articulate the extent of Mary Pickford’s accomplishments. The structure of my website mirrors the chronological trajectory of Mary Pickford's life. I aimed to immerse the audience while simultaneously having them grow alongside her. Photos are offered as glimpses into the life of “The Girl with Golden Curls,” and the literature I expanded on provided context to the imagery. Pickford was one of the most expressive and magnificent actresses in the silent era. So, I knew I needed to include her image and spectacular presence on video.\n\nMy website opens with Pickford’s childhood rather than depicting the middle of her career. This choice was intentional in order to illuminate the charismatic nature of her upbringing. She was a self-starter who scratched her way to the top of the business, where space was deemed limited for women. Mary Pickford came from almost nothing, but through wit and determination, she raised herself in life. I was inspired by the humble beginnings, humor, wit, and talent that made her a global superstar by age 21. Furthermore, Pickford's co-founding of United Artists in 1919 was an unprecedented business proposition and a true inspiration to women everywhere. As an aspiring producer myself, Mary's professional life was primarily why I decided to dedicate my project to her.\n\nPickford was also a role model of the \"New Womanhood\" movement, setting the stage for women to participate in modern society. On this website, my central argument revolves around her prevalence as a female trailblazer. Her importance in pushing the envelope for women in business is particularly poignant, and I look up to Mary as a burgeoning woman in film.\n\nFurthermore, Pickford's impact on women’s voting rights was immense. By inviting the board of judges to her estate and sweet-talking them, she proved one woman could change the world. I chose Pickford for her contributions to HERstory (history).\n\nThe chronology of my research project depicts Mary Pickford’s setting the standard for empowered women on screen and multifaceted, business-minded women. Throughout my research project, I gained an appreciation for Pickford's contributions to entertainment and her role in empowering women on screen. Her ability to negotiate and advocate for her interests transcended the “norm.” Mary Pickford's life story also made me appreciate the evolving role of women in society during her time. She was a trailblazer who defied traditional gender roles and expectations, demonstrating that women could be decisive, independent, and successful in their professional and personal lives.\n\nMary Pickford: The Muse of the Movies (2008), Secrets (1933), Kiki (1931), Coquette (1929), Taming of the Shrew (1929), The Gaucho (1928), My Best Girl (1927), Sparrows (1926), Little Annie Rooney (1925), Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall (1924), Rosita (1923), Tess of the Storm Country (1922), The Love Light (1921), Through the Back Door (1921), Little Lord Fauntleroy (1921), Suds (1920), Pollyanna (1920), Heart O' the Hills (1919), Daddy-Long-Legs (1919), The Hoodlum (1919), Captain Kidd, Jr. (1919), M’liss (1918), How Could You, Jean?
