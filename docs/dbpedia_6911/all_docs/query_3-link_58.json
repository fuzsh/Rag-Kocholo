        "text": ".\n\n.\n\nThe actress Mary Pickford was born as Gladys Marie Smith in Toronto. Because her parents already worked for the stage it was only a question of time till Mary Pickford would seize this occupation too. Her parents introduced her at an early age and when Mary Pickford was six years old she stood for the first time on the stage.\n\nWhen Mary Pickford made her film debut in 1908 this was the beginning of an unique career and she became the first American Sweetheart.\n\nHer first movie was \"Mrs. Jones Entertains\" (08), and already in the following year she appeared in incredible 51 movies - a great deal of work which shouldn't hardly change in the next few years.\n\nOne of her directors was the great D.W. Griffiths, who engaged her in many of his early productions. For the Biograph Company she appeared among others in the movies \"The Lonely Villa\" (09), \"The Way of Man\" (09), \"Tender Hearts\" (09), \"The Indian Runner's Romance\" (09), \"The Little Darling\" (09), \"In Old Kentucky\" (09), \"The Awakening\" (09), \"The Call\" (10), \"His Last Dollar\" (10), \"A Romance of the Western Hills\" (10), \"In the Border States\" (10), \"Ramona\" (10), \"May and December\" (10), \"The Sorrows and the Unfaithful\" (10) and \"Sunshine Sue\" (10).\n\nMary Pickford left Biograph in 1911 and worked for Carl Laemmle and his IMP Film Company. There she acted in \"The Italian Barber\" (11), \"The Stampede\" (11), \"The Mirror\" (11), \"Little Red Riding Hood\" (11) and \"Her Darkest Hour\" (11). After that she returned to Biograph.\n\nThe year 1912 was the last year in which Mary Pickford played in a great number of movies, so in \"The Female of the Species\" (12), \"A Beast at Bay\" (12), \"Lena and the Geese\" (12), \"An Indian Summer\" (12), \"The Inner Circle\" (12), \"Friends\" (12), The New York Hat\" (12) and \"The Informer\" (12). Afterwards she went to Adolph Zukor and made only a few movies a year, besides it she also wrote and produced movies.\n\nTo her other well-known movies of the 10's belong \"Fate\" (13), \"Caprice\" (13), \"A Good Little Devil\" (14), \"Tess of the Storm Country\" (14), \"Cinderella\" (14), \"Little Pal\" (15), \"Madame Butterfly\" (15), \"Broken Hearts\" (15), \"The Eternal Grind\" (16), \"The Pride of the Clan\" (17), \"The Poor Little Rich Girl\" (17), \"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\" (17), \"Stella Maris\" (18), \"Captain Kidd, Jr.\" (19) and \"The Hoodlum\" (19).\n\nMary Pickford was co-founder of United Artists in 1919 together with the actors Douglas Fairbanks and Charles Chaplin as well as director D.W. Griffith. United Artists was a counterpart to the big studios and produced independent movies. United Artists was responsible for many important movies in the next sixty years before it was taken over by M-G-M.\n\nLikewise in 1920 Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks got married and they became the most famous Hollywood couple. Their home \"Pickfair Mansion\" was the central issue for the filmworld of the 20's and they influenced the social life in Hollywood.\n\nMary Pickford demonstrated a sure instinct in her function for United Artists which movies will work and which not. She proved that she not only was a great actress but also a very successful businesswoman. She also belonged to the 36 foundation members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts ans Sciences in 1928 which since then awards the Oscars for the best film workers each year.\n\nTo her merits belong also that she engaged the famous director Ernst Lubitsch from Germany for the movie \"Rosita\" (23). As a result Lubitsch continued his career in America very successful and had an important influence on the development of cinema.\n\nMary Pickford appeared only rarely on the screen during the 20's, among others in \"Pollyanna\" (20), \"The Nut\" (21), \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\" (21), \"Little Annie Rooney\" (25), \"Sparrows\" (26), \"The Taming of the Shrew\" (29) and finally \"Coquette\" (29), for which she got an Oscar as the best actress in a leading role.\n\nWith the development of the sound film she retired from the film business after the talkies \"Kiki\" (31) and \"Secrets\" (33).\n\nShe got an Honorary Award in 1976.\n\nMary Pickford was married in first marriage with actor Owen Moore, in second marriage with the famous film hero Douglas Fairbanks and in third marriage with the actor Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers.\n\nOther movies with Mary Pickford:\n\nThe Fascinating Mrs. Francis (09) The Deception (09) The Drive for Life (09) Two Memories (09) His Duty (09) What Drink Did (09) The Violin Maker of Cremona (09) The Son's Return (09) Her First Biscuits (09) The Faded Lilies (09) The Peachbasket Hat (09) The Mexican Sweethearts (09) The Necklase (09) The Country Doctor (09) The Cardinal's Conspiracy (09) The Renunciation (09) Sweet and Twenty (09) The Slave (09) A Strange Meeting (09) They Would Elope (09) His Wife's Visitor (09) The Seventh Day (09) Oh, Uncle!
