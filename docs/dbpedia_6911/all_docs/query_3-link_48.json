        "text": "Mary Pickford\n\nAmerica's Sweetheart\n\nFrom Toronto to Hollywood\n\nBorn in Toronto, Mary Pickford’s many achievements both on-and off-screen were instrumental in developing filmmaking as an art form and the film industry at large. She was a trailblazer as an actress, producer, philanthropist, and business woman.\n\nFrom a young age, Mary was the breadwinner for the Pickford Family and her early experiences on the stage and in film led her to advocate for herself and her fellow actors. She was one of the first actresses to negotiate her own contracts and the distribution rights of her films. Mary was also influential as a founding member of both United Artists and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS).\n\nThis exhibition highlights Mary’s work in silent and sound films, her familial and romantic relationships, and her leadership role for women in the industry. We invite you to rediscover Mary through this vibrant collection of films, photographs and objects.\n\n\"I was forced to live far beyond my years when I was just a child, now I have reversed the order and I intend to remain young indefinitely.”\n\nMary Pickford\n\nMary Pickford in Sparrows (1926)\n\nMary Pickford on location for Tess of the Storm Country (1922)\n\nMary Pickford in Fanchon The Cricket (1914)\n\nFilmography\n\n© 2023 Mary Pickford Foundation.
