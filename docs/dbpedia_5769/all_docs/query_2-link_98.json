        "text": "How early can you spot a star? I don’t mean are you the next great A&R guy, the one who finds this eras Kurt Cobain dropping cover versions on YouTube (yeah, right), I mean how early on is it actually there in the individual.\n\nIt’s hard to pinpoint because we don’t get to see the artist in most cases till they’re some way down the road of their development. For instance, we know Michael Jackson had it from age five, but did Elton John, Beyonce or Ed Sheeran? I doubt it, but I have no idea, and if they didn’t when was the moment that it changed for them? When the talent was so overwhelmingly obvious that even your Saturday night reality show spectator could spot it.\n\nWatching the Amy documentary, which is largely made up of previously unseen private footage of her life gives you the opportunity to see her before it happened.\n\nIn the early part of the film we see her messing around in her kitchen with some friends as 14 year old, and it occurred to me that she seemed just like most of the girls I knew when I was a similar age. It was just a snapshot but there was nothing on the surface that was exceptional or extraordinary about her.\n\nThe friends begin singing Happy Birthday to one of the girls. There’s probably not a song in human history that has been sung more tunelessly more often. Think about it. I bet you can’t name one that beats it. The scene played out similarly in her kitchen, until she decided to take over the last couple of lines of the song (which she delivered in the style of Marilyn Monroe’s famous performance to JFK). You can tell she can sing, but beyond that there is nothing that is certain as to where she may end up.\n\nShe’s just a kid in a tatty white T Shirt and pyjama bottoms after all. There’s no reason why a white girl in Southgate with a Cockney accent should sound like Ella Fitzgerald or Billie Holiday, but we all know that’s where the story is headed.\n\nAdele like Amy was born and brought up in North London — in Tottenham no less, more well known for it’s Grime MC’s than it’s Soul Singers. Much the same as Amy, Adele has one of those voices that make your head turn and your eyes widen (like Simon Cowell to anyone who can carry a tune in the Room Auditions), though opting instead to channel the likes of Aretha Franklin and Rosetta Tharpe.\n\nShe recently said that if it hadn’t been for Amy’s first album Frank, she wouldn’t have begun writing songs on the guitar, and probably wouldn’t be making music. What?! Let’s just back up for a second. That’s a chasm sized sliding doors moment in 21st Century music.\n\nListening back to that first Amy album with fresh ears it sounds even better now than when it was released. She (and producer Salaam Remi) managed to fuse contemporary beats with her Jazz influences in spectacular fashion, a combination that shouldn’t really work, yet does. Though the album was well received critically it was never a monster seller in the way the second album was.\n\nOn Adele’s first album 19, she doesn’t sound quite like the Adele that we know today. She’s still feeling her way around, trying to figure out exactly what kind of artist she wants to be. There are some songs where you can hear her Cockney accent coming through (which she has abandoned on the albums since then), a presumably conscience decision at the time due to the success of the likes Kate Nash and her single Foundations, as well as Lily Allen and her middle class Damon Albarn style Mockney. Nevertheless, the album still went to number 1 in the charts, because that’s what Adele does very well. Goes to number 1.\n\nThe real head to head, where both ladies reach their peak performance powers, is the sophomore albums.\n\nBack to Black v 21.\n\nThey are the UK’s number 1 & 2 biggest selling albums of the 21st Century, but with 20th Century type numbers. It’s like Messi scoring at a rate of nearly a goal per game in an era when that isn’t supposed to happen anymore.\n\nBack to Black has sold 3.5 million copies in the UK and 12 million worldwide, whilst 21 has to date sold just under 5 million copies in the UK and 30 million worldwide. 30 million! That’s fucking crazy. It’s up there with all those 70s & 80s albums, the likes of Rumours, Bat Out Of Hell and Thriller that every household owns a copy of regardless of if anyone’s ever listened to it or not. There’s a line in Wayne’s World 2 where Wayne says, ‘Everybody in the world has Frampton Comes Alive. If you lived in the suburbs you were issued it. It came in the mail with samples of Tide.’ 21 is the 21st Century equivalent.\n\nA key component that both the albums and artists possess is that women absolutely LOVE them. Love in a crazy way where if you say anything less than complimentary about either of them within the earshot of a woman, there is a good chance she will completely lose her shit.\n\nForget Moneyball. There has to be a business in Balladball. Analysing the relationship between songs that speak of relationship heartbreak and women parting with twelve quid for a CD album.\n\nAdele obviously has this market completely cornered. She is the Nicholas Sparks of recorded music. Every song is another chapter in the rocky road of doomed relationships. Someone Like You is just a ridiculously good record, the opening piano chords followed by the first few lines she sings instantly make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, promoting you to look around to see if anyone’s been chopping up onions.\n\nIt would have been an enormous single worldwide regardless, but her performance of it at the Brits completely put the song and the album over the top, her tears at the end sealing the deal. The only shame is we have to suffer James Corden introducing it whenever watching the clip in his webuyanycar.com gentle tone. I suppose we should be thankful he didn’t try to crowbar in some sort of karaoke duet.\n\nAll of the singles that followed were equally astonishing in both their catchiness and quality. It was like Bale’s last season at Spurs. Every track was a thirty yard shot into the top corner, where at some point you had to say ‘ok, enough already.’\n\nAdele’s appeal is easy to understand. She’s not a Diva like Mariah or Whitney. She has a personality that makes people believe that if they happened to bump into her they could end up being good friends with her. (Men feel the same way about Glamour models v Fashion models, substituting ‘friends’ for ‘could sleep with.’)\n\nThe Amy attraction is less obvious on the surface. By the time Black To Black came out she was very difficult to relate to — unless you ingested copious amounts of alcohol and class A drugs, as well as enjoying relationships with men in need of a good lengthy bath. It didn’t seem to matter, as the songs and her voice cut through whatever impression we had of her at the time.\n\nThere had been a sizeable enough gap from her first album where the music was in danger of being forgotten and totally devoured by just her celebrity. Rehab, the first single from Back To Black addressed the elephant in the room with both attitude and humour. Yes she was a bit fucked up, but she was conscious enough of it to wrap up the whole situation up into a three minute killer song, which made us think that she must actually be ok, otherwise how did she come up with it in the first place?!\n\nTo accompany the new sound Amy undertook a massive shift in her image from first to second album. Tattoos now adorned much of her visible flesh, a beehive hairstyle sat resplendent atop her head (almost doubling her height), as she strutted her stick thin figure around in tiny figure hugging Wilma Flintstone short ragged dresses. It was a look that was half Betty Boop half Marilyn Manson. Her music around that time invaded nightclubs in a way that Adele’s has never managed. Back To Back and Valerie in particular were the cue for every girl in the place to stampede towards the dance floor and lose their collective shit with their friends to a record they’d probably heard 3000 times beforehand. Whilst they all loudly sang along, Smirnoff Ice held aloft, you’d still be able to hear Amy’s vocal cutting through over the raucous rabble.\n\nBeyond the two iconic albums and the great songs that they’ve written I always come back to the voices. It’s baffling to me that they both emanate from North London in the same period of time. You’d bet every pound in your pockets it’s an American female, most likely black, if you heard them before seeing them. It makes about as much sense as Switzerland producing Hingis and Federer. Both are vintage bottles of red, Adele with the full-bodied smoothness of a good Merlot, Amy the rasp and sass of a classic Shiraz. To choose one would be difficult without knowing the meal that it would be accompanying, but if we’re stood at the bar still waiting for our table I think today I’d opt for the Shiraz.\n\nThis article appears on www.iconjungle.co.uk"
