        "text": "If a music legend dies before their time and a biopic isn't made in their honour, did they ever really exist at all? According to Hollywood, probably not.\n\nLike Elvis, Freddie Mercury and Judy Garland, Amy Winehouse will be the latest icon immortalised on screen in a new biopic called Black to Black, which has officially kicked off production.\n\nWinehouse rose to fame in the early aughts for her distinctive, soulful voice that led her from buzzy North London one-to-watch to Grammy-winning superstar with inimitable songs like 2006's “Rehab” and “Back to Black”. A fixture in the tabloids as much as the charts, Winehouse publicly struggled with drug and alcohol abuse, the latter tragically cutting her life short at the age of 27 in 2011.\n\nSome version of a cinematic retelling of Winehouse's life has been in the works more or less since her death, though none of them have made it off the ground until now. Officially greenlit in July 2022, the film, named after Winehouse's number one single of the same name, is now swiftly moving forward.\n\nHere's everything we know about the film.\n\nWho will star in Back to Black?\n\nIt's been revealed that Industry star Marisa Abela will don the emblematic Amy Winehouse bouffant in Back to Black in an announcement by Focus Features on Twitter. Studio Canal, who'll distribute the film in Europe, similarly uploaded the announcement and first-look image of Abela, saying “One of music’s greatest artists, Amy Winehouse, comes to the big screen in Sam Taylor-Johnson’s Back to Black. With cameras rolling from next week, we’re thrilled to release this first look at rising star Marisa Abela as Amy.”\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe first-look image shows Abela decked in gold hoops, lip piercing, heavy eye-makeup, a mountain of brown, bee-hived hair and a hint of tattoo – a full look that's become synonymous with the late singer.\n\nAbela is known to fans for her breakout role in Industry, one of the most critically acclaimed shows of the past few years that has drummed up well-earned buzz for its cast of fresh, young stars. She stars as Yasmin in the series about the cutthroat world of investment banking which is about to film its third season. Fans have praised Abela's casting, as like Winehouse, she is of Jewish descent. She confirmed the casting on Instagram after the announcement, posing next to a mural of Winehouse and showing off more of the singer's iconic look.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAt the directing helm will be Sam Taylor-Johnson in her second musical biopic following 2008's Nowhere Boy, which was about a young John Lennon and starred her now-husband Aaron Taylor Johnson. Taylor-Johnson has been attached since 2022, saying in a statement: “My connection to Amy began when I left college and was hanging out in the creatively diverse London borough of Camden”, the singer's home borough in London where she lived and tragically died.\n\n“I first saw her perform at a talent show at Ronnie Scott’s Jazz Club in Soho and it was immediately obvious she wasn’t just ’talent’… she was genius. As a filmmaker you can’t really ask for more\", she said, adding the weight of responsibility she feels to get Amy's story right.\n\nWhat will Back To Black be about?\n\nTaylor-Johnson's last foray into musical biopic told the story of John Lennon before The Beatles, focusing on his upbringing in Liverpool. For Back to Black, it seems like she's telling the story of Amy Winehouse as the public knew her.\n\nIn a statement, she said, “I feel excited and humbled to have this opportunity to realise Amy’s beautifully unique and tragic story to cinema accompanied by the most important part of her legacy – her music”. The sentiment has been echoed by producer Alison Owens, who said, “Amy Winehouse is the greatest musical talent of the 21st century so far. But like so many female icons, the tragedy of her death has seemed to obscure the triumph of her talent…the fun of the noughties, the craziness of Camden, her youth and brilliance – we want to reclaim that for her, with this film.”\n\nThe film is being made with the full support of the Winehouse estate, who openly criticised a documentary, Amy, made in 2015 and multiple rumoured biopics since. They've said, “We are thrilled that STUDIOCANAL, Focus Features and Monumental are making this movie celebrating our daughter Amy’s extraordinary music legacy and showcasing her talent in the way that it deserves.”\n\nWhen Amy was released, the singer's dad Mitch Winehouse complained that it was misleading, especially in regards to his relationship with his daughter and her upbringing. The documentary utilised archival footage as well as interviews with friends and family. The family then released their own rebuttal documentary, Reclaiming Amy, in 2021. It's unclear what elements Back to Black will focus its lens on, but with support from the Winehouse estate, it looks likely it won't be particularly accusatory to anyone in the family.\n\nWhen will Back to Black be released?\n\nWith production only just starting, it's likely the film won't hit our screens until the end of the year at the earliest, but most likely sometime in 2024."
