        "text": "On this day, 3 July 2005, English singer/songwriter Amy Winehouse played Cardiff’s St David’s Hall.\n\nWinehouse's debut album, Frank, was released on 20 October 2003. Produced mainly by Salaam Remi, many songs were influenced by jazz and, apart from two covers, Winehouse co-wrote every song.\n\nThe album received critical acclaim with compliments given to the \"cool, critical gaze\" in its lyrics.\n\nWinehouse's voice was compared with those of Sarah Vaughan and Macy Gray, among others.\n\nAdele has credited Winehouse's success in making her and fellow British singer Duffy's journey to the United States \"a bit smoother.\"\n\nLady Gaga credited Winehouse with paving the way for her rise to the top of the charts, explaining that Winehouse made it easier for unconventional women to have mainstream pop success.\n\nRaphael Saadiq, Anthony Hamilton and John Legend said \"Amy Winehouse was produced by people who wanted to create a marketing coup. The positive side is that it reacquainted an audience with this music and played an introductory role for others. This reinvigorated the genre by overcoming the vintage aspect.\"\n\nOther artists that have credited Winehouse as an influence and/or for paving the way for them include Bruno Mars, Tove Lo, Jessie J, Emeli Sandé, Paloma Faith, Lana Del Rey, Sam Smith, Florence Welch and Billie Eilish."
