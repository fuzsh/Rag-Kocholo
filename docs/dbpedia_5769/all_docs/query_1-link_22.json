        "text": "Last night I went out to see Back to Black. It's a film that explores the life and times of British singer, Amy Winehouse. Amy lived quite an incredible life. As the movie points out, Amy Winehouse's life was filled with Judaism, her grandmother's love, smoking, drinking, sex, and eventually crack with the guy she eventually married. Amy says she has to LIVE her songs, and she is right. Amy Winehouse lived her songs into an early grave and died of alcohol poisoning at the age of 27 in 2011.\n\nWho Was Amy Winehouse?\n\nAmy Winehouse was a British jazz/soul singer who brought 60's fashion and vocals to the early oughts. She got famous faster than anyone would have predicted and was originally signed to Simon Fuller's record label at the age of 19. She had a real \"piss off, you wankers\" attitude and didn’t take shit off of anybody save her boyfriend Blake… sometimes. You've heard her music before or else you were born sometime after 2015. If so:\n\n\"Hi little one! Thank you so much for reading my work! Remember to share with your friends!\"\n\nWinehouse went from being an average, occasionally drunk nobody with a great voice, to a famous rockstar-level drunk in a very short time. She sang all your favorites: Rehab, You Know I'm No Good, Back to Black, and several other songs. Throughout much of her short time on the planet, Amy Winehouse made great music.\n\nI feel she deserves to be world-famous. She won a gang of awards in England, then she won a gang of awards in America including the Grammy they never want to give Beyoncé. Signed by Darcus Beese, Amy worked with everyone from Salaam Remi, Mark Ronson, and teamed up with Ghostface Killah of the Wu-Tang Clan.\n\n(Save for Mark Ronson, these are all Black people which will be important later)\n\nAmy Winehouse is a legendary vocalist and she deserved to have a movie made about her life. Her songs were intricate, deep, and sexy. She brought the jazz style back to pop culture and did it her way. I can see why people think she is so incredible.\n\nUnfortunately, Amy Winehouse was also a drunken, drug-fueled, bulimia nervosa wreck of a woman who was destined to join The 27 Club, “going to rehab” be damned. The 27 Club is where all artists go when they die at 27. Speaking of favorites, Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Michel Basquiat, and blues legend Robert Johnson have all managed to join. It's not cool to be in this club unless you’re super goth.\n\nHow Was Back to Black?\n\nWhew... This movie is sad. We knew it would be going in. It does a great job showing what Amy Winehouse was like... I assume. I never met her. I'd only heard of her on the Austin alternative pop station when they perked my ears up by mentioning she worked with the Wu-Tang Clan.\n\nUnlike most biopics where the character starts off all naive and nice while learning their craft, Back to Black starts off with Amy running down the street. From that moment I thought Amy actress Marisa Abela was too athletic to be playing Amy Winehouse. Amy’s whole appeal was having a big voice coming from a painfully waifish body. I thought Marisa she did a great job carrying this movie. I knew enough about Amy Winehouse to know any film about her would be sad and went to see this anyway.\n\nWe move from the scene of her running to showing her hanging out with her Grandmother (Nan) at one of her family's parties. Amy's 18 and already has a great reputation as a singer. As she observes Nan's old picture from the 50s and 60s, she goes out to the rest of the party and starts singing. Her dad joins in and everyone is excited.\n\nThat's as nice as her story is gonna be.\n\nAmy is already drinking and smoking a little too much. Everyone tells her she’s going too hard! She tells those people they are wrong and need to mind their own business.\n\nBack to Black is essentially an alcoholic’s journey to fame and fortune. Amy doesn’t care about money and says she “doesn’t want to be a Spice Girl.” Amy thinks fame is for losers. Amy mouths off to label execs. Amy smokes when she drinks and is always doing one. Amy drinks until she blacks out. Amy busts her head during one of the “fits” she has. Amy Winehouse is already a big drinker, but once she meets Blake at a pub, it’s about to get a lot worse.\n\nThey fall in love. Like many relationships, theirs is toxic. I can't understand why anything they do is flirtatious. Blake hates Amy’s fame but likes doing lines of coke at Amy’s house. Blake says he likes drugs but not weed and is cool with Amy’s drinking because drinks a lot too. They get into a fight at a club, and then Amy is pushing a woman and punching Blake in the belly outside of a bar. Blake breaks it off. Amy writes Back to Black. All of this is so damn sad and hard to watch.\n\nThe music scenes are fantastic though. A highlight in this film. I got to a point where I didn’t want to see anymore of her drama but watched and waited to how they'd bring in the next Amy track. That’s the most fun part of Amy Winehouse’s rather depressing life. As portrayed in this movie.\n\nAs always, the question remains if you should watch this movie. I'd say yes if you're a fan of Amy Winehouse and want to see what her life was like. I'm sure this film is killing it in England right now. If you don't know or care about her, don't waste your time. Unless you enjoy sad biopics then you could watch this feel bad if you like.\n\nNow let’s get to that whole thing about Amy Winehouse owing everything in her life to Black people."
