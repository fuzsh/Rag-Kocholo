        "text": "Topline\n\nNearly ten years to the day after British R&B icon Amy Winehouse died at age 27, her work is back on the Billboard charts, thanks to a vinyl-driven surge of some of her greatest hits.\n\nKey Facts\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nThe album didn’t appear on this week’s top 100 albums chart from the U.K.-based Official Charts Company. But Winehouse’s final album released before her death, Back to Black, surged 46 spots on the chart from last week, landing at No. 7.\n\nKey Background\n\nWinehouse became an acclaimed artist during the 2000s, known for a deep singing voice that lent itself well to the soul, jazz and R&B music that she performed. A signature beehive hairdo added to Winehouse’s status as an unmistakable artist. In 2008, Winehouse won the “Best New Artist” award at the Grammys, while taking home four other awards at that year’s ceremonies for her Back to Black album and the song widely considered her biggest hit, Rehab. The trove of major awards marked what many view as the peak of her career. But for the next few years, Winehouse struggled publicly with drug and alcohol abuse, resulting in hospitalizations and repeated arrests. On July 23, 2011, Winehouse was found dead inside her London apartment. Multiple investigations have concluded that Winehouse died of alcohol poisoning, with a coroner's report after her death revealing that Winehouse had a blood alcohol content of 0.416%—more than five times the legal limit to drive.\n\nTangent\n\nWinehouse is one of several legendary musicians over the years who have died at the age of 27, leading Winehouse to be considered a member of the melancholy “27 Club.” Other famed musicians like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Kurt Cobain also died at the age of 27.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nUnreleased Winehouse recordings have reportedly been discovered since her death—music the late singer’s father would like to see released, according to the BBC.\n\nTop 10 Dance/electronic Albums (chart Dated July 31)\n\n1. Fallen Embers by ILLENIUM\n\n2. Remixes by Amy Winehouse\n\n3. The Fame by Lady Gaga\n\n4. Demon Days by Gorillaz\n\n5. Chromatica by Lady Gaga\n\n6. Random Access Memories by Daft Punk\n\n7. Collage (EP) by The Chainsmokers\n\n8. Marshmello: Fortnite Extended Set by Marshmello\n\n9. Golden Hour by Kygo\n\n10. Memories . . . Do Not Open by The Chainsmokers\n\nFurther Reading\n\nAmy Winehouse, British Soul Singer With a Troubled Life, Dies at 27 (The New York Times)"
