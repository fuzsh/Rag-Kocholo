        "text": "If Amy Winehouse had continued to release more incredible songs just like those on Back To Black, she could've become a mega force in the music industry.\n\nSadly we'll never know, but a new lead single from the third album could easily have given Amy her first UK #1 and the album would no doubt have had extraordinary sales that only the likes of Adele and Ed Sheeran can achieve.\n\n0\n\nIf the 'drugs hadn't taken over', it's possible Amy Winehouse would not have become Amy Winehouse. Frank was ok, but nothing really special in a sea of female artists at the time. Maybe it would have come about even without her well publicised substance abuse, but it was during this period that she created Black To Black, which has some incredible songs on it, and cultivated her beehive sporting, 60's channeling image that propelled her to international fame (or notoriety, depending on how you look at it).\n\nImpossible to say how she might have progressed.\n\n0\n\nIt's natural for some to see artists who died young through rose tinted spectacles. She was just one of many singers of her time. The rapid changes in what appeals to the youth of today, would mean she would eventually become just one of many. So much competition these days.\n\n0\n\nI love her, I remember hearing” in my bed “from frank on a late night radio show and was stoped in my tracks , the voice was out of this world and the music just moved me , she would have been bigger than Adele and ed if drugs didnt get her , best song of hers I love and play the most is “half time “ from lioness , my second most played song on my phone\n\n0\n\nIt's natural for some to see artists who died young through rose tinted spectacles. She was just one of many singers of her time. The rapid changes in what appeals to the youth of today, would mean she would eventually become just one of many. So much competition these days.\n\nI think you underestimate the influence she had on others though. Maybe this was partly hastened by her early demise but Amy was an important influence even in her lifetime on Adele, Lana Del Rey, Gaga, Sam Smith. Florence etc. To me she wasn’t just one of the many singers of her time.\n\n0\n\nIt's natural for some to see artists who died young through rose tinted spectacles.

Choices are so subjective and it isn't wise to pigeonhole singers.\n\nI'm sure many contemporary singers have all sorts of influences.\n\nAmy said her influence was Sarah Vaughan. Amy was nine when she died.\n\nAdele has mentioned Dusty Springfield as her influence and she was 10/11 when Dusty died. But it’s the 60s Blue-eyed Soul/R&B that Adele is referencing, music recorded well before Adele or Amy were born. Amy was definitely more influenced by Sarah Vaughan and was more jazzy than Adele.\n\nAmy’s importance comes from being retro in style and she opened a window to let in some inspired jazz, soul and R&B that helped others be successful after her. That’s just not true of every good contemporary singer.\n\n0\n\nIt's natural for some to see artists who died young through rose tinted spectacles. She was just one of many singers of her time.

Having been confessional I could see Amy being redeemed or saved to extent the religious metaphor and she might have gone more soulful in her music. And yeah she might have been swept up as just one of a number of artists doing similar music. Comparisons to Adele would have persisted and there might have been some rivalry there which would have boosted Amy’s sales a little. I’m guessing she would have worked with Mark Ronson...would she have been the main singer on Uptown Funk?\n\n0\n\nIt's natural for some to see artists who died young through rose tinted spectacles.

Amy was for much of the time a novelty, if it wasn't for her personal life she'd not have been in the papers so often to get noticed by young people, they're a very fickle demographic when it comes to music. Jazz influenced performers, like Georgie Fame and Diana Krall had been doing it for decades.\n\n1"
