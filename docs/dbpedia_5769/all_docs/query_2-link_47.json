        "text": "Updated 6/3/2024\n\nBy Camille van Niekerk\n\nA few weeks ago, I came across this video of Alicia Keys and Billie Eilish performing “Ocean Eyes.\"\n\nMany commenters have already noted that Alicia does not sound her best on this song.\n\nBut why?\n\nAlicia Keys is a professional vocalist - can’t she sing anything?\n\nKnowing how to sing is the goal.\n\nAnd within that, it's important to know how to choose a good song to fit your individual voice.\n\nAlicia Keys is incredible within her style, just as Billie is incredible within hers.\n\nYou truly can’t compare them, nor should you ever have to!\n\nThey have unique voices with different strengths, and they’ve both found their wheelhouse.\n\nDo you know which songs and styles are a good fit for your voice?\n\nLet's unpack this.\n\nSing and Find Out\n\nIf you’re taking beginner singing lessons, here’s one way to figure out if a song is a good fit with your voice:\n\n1. Choose a song you like.\n\n2. Sing along with the original artist to learn the melody.\n\n3. Check to make sure you’re singing the correct pitches with Smule (or another karaoke app with pitch analysis).\n\n4. Record yourself and listen back.\n\nIf you were able to match the pitch, general tone and style of the original, that song is a good fit for you!\n\nWe like to call this the 'sing and find out' strategy.\n\nSimply sing tunes you enjoy, then figure out if they are technically a good fit for you after the fact.\n\nThis is a great approach if you are just trying to have some fun and aren't too concerned if a particular song is causing strain.\n\nSinging is about joy!\n\nSometimes it's best to keep the analysis for another day.\n\nThe other approach to finding songs that fit your singing abilities is to understand some technical aspects first, then find songs that fit those aspects.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nYou can increase your chances of picking a good song easily by choosing a singer whose voice type (soprano, mezzo, alto, tenor, baritone or bass) is similar to yours.\n\nDetermine Your Vocal Range\n\nHow do we determine your vocal range?\n\nIt's easy, all you'll need is a keyboard or a tuner app.\n\nFirst, we’re looking for your lowest comfortable note.\n\nSing as low as you comfortably can and write down that note.\n\nThen, your highest comfortable note.\n\nSing as high as you comfortably can and write down that note.\n\nOnce you have those notes, you have your vocal range.\n\nCompare your range to a vocal range chart (like the one above) and you'll know what your vocal range is called.\n\nThere you have it!\n\nOur friends at Singing Carrots have a great vocal range finder tool that's worth a try.\n\nOnce you know your range, Google other singers who have the same range as you and start learning their songs.\n\nWhere’s The Break?\n\nIn addition to your current singable range, take note of where your passaggio is.\n\nYour passaggio is the pitch or range in which your voice transitions from one register to the next.\n\nLike your head voice vs chest voice.\n\nFor most singers, this will present itself as a “crack”, “yodel”, or “break.”\n\nLocating your passaggio will help you realistically choose songs based on your desired tone and register.\n\nFor example, let's say a melody contains a low G3 and a high D5.\n\nThis may be within your overall range, but that’s not the only consideration.\n\nYou also need to know how those pitches sound, and whether you can recreate a similar sound.\n\nA particular singer might singing that D5 with a strong “mixed” coordination, so it sounds more like chest voice.\n\nMany singers can easily sing a D5, but they may only be comfortable singing that pitch in head voice, which naturally has a lighter, brighter tone than chest or mixed voice.\n\nAll this is to say, the actial notes themselves are only one consideration to determine if a song is right for you.\n\nI can’t belt that high note. Am I doomed?\n\nA song requiring a high belt (in either chest or mixed voice) is very challenging.\n\nBeginning singers can easily hurt themselves trying to push for those high notes.\n\nIf you’re in this boat, you have a few options:\n\n1. Search for a lower karaoke track (as long as you can hit the low notes in the new, lower key)\n\n2. Use different register than the original (for example, use head voice instead of belting and make it a stylistic choice)\n\n3. Put this song on the shelf (for now) and choose an easier one!\n\nOnce you’ve developed mixed coordination, you won’t need to work around your passaggio quite as much.\n\nBut for someone taking beginner vocal lessons, it’s stressful to constantly be crossing that register break,\n\nIf you want to avoid shifting between registers until you’ve built your “mixed” coordination, choose songs with a smaller range so you can sing the entire melody within one vocal register.\n\n\"Tonal Models\"\n\nAnother great approach is to identify artists you already know you can sing along with easily.\n\nThose singers can serve as tonal models for you, as you develop your tone and style.\n\nYou may struggle to think of singers you sound like.\n\nBut keep that question in mind as you listen to different artists.\n\nTake note of those that feel like a more natural fit than others.\n\nListen for singers with -\n\n(1) a similar range to yours\n\n(2) a tone quality that’s easy for you to recreate\n\nLook through their song lists when searching for new songs to learn.\n\nExplore similar artists on Spotify/Pandora.\n\nOne-Octave Songs\n\nBelow is a great list of songs that only span one octave.\n\nSo they are perfect songs to learn when just starting out with singing lessons.\n\nAnd if they aren't exactly in your key, shift them higher or lower so they fit into your proper register.\n\nChange the key as needed to suit your voice by looking for an existing track on YouTube (search “higher”, “lower”, “male key”, etc) or purchasing a customized karaoke track at Karaoke Version.\n\nNOTE - A few songs on this list technically span a ninth (or an octave plus one whole-step), but they will still be doable for most beginning singers.\n\n“Ain’t no sunshine” (Bill Withers)\n\n“All Star” (Smash Mouth)\n\n“All the small things” (Blink 182)\n\n“Angel from Montgomery” (Bonnie Raitt)\n\n“Bad Moon Rising” (Credence Clearwater Revival)\n\n“Bubbly” (Colbie Caillat)\n\n“Chasing Cars” (Snow Patrol)\n\n“Da Doo Run Run” (The Crystals)\n\n“Drops of Jupiter” (Train)\n\n“Eight Days a Week” (The Beatles)\n\n“Fields of Gold” (Sting)\n\n“Girls just wanna have fun” (Greg Laswell cover, originally by Cyndi Lauper)\n\n“Happy” (Pharrell Williams)\n\n“Heart of Gold” (Neil Young)\n\n“Hey Jude” (The Beatles)\n\n“Hotel California” (Eagles)\n\n“I can see clearly now” (Johnny Nash)\n\n“I guess I just feel like” (John Mayer)\n\n“I love rock n roll” (Joan Jett)\n\n“I will follow you into the dark” (Death Cab for Cutie)\n\n“I’m Yours” (Jason Mraz)\n\n“I’ve just seen a face” (The Beatles)\n\n“If I ever leave this world alive” (Flogging Molly)\n\n“Let Her Go” (Passenger)\n\n“Let it go” (James Bay)\n\n“Losing my religion” (R.E.M.)\n\n“Love yourself” (Justin Bieber)\n\n“Make you feel my love” (Bob Dylan)\n\n“Mamma Mia” (ABBA)\n\n“Mr. Brightside” (The Killers)\n\n“Riptide” (Vance Joy)\n\n“Say my name” (Destiny’s Child)\n\n“Shotgun” (George Ezra)\n\n“Should I stay or should I go” (The Clash)\n\n“Sittin on the dock of the bay” (Otis Redding)\n\n“Take it on the run” (REO Speedwagon)\n\n“Take me home, country roads” (John Denver)\n\n“The Middle” (Jimmy Eat World)\n\n“This is the life” (Amy Macdonald)\n\n“Wagon Wheel” (Darius Rucker)\n\n“Walk the line” (Johnny Cash)\n\n“Wind of Change” (Scorpions)\n\n“You belong to me” (Carla Bruni)\n\n“You know I’m no good” (Amy Winehouse)\n\n“Your heart is as black as night” (Melodie Gardot)\n\nFor song suggestions within your range, visit SingingCarrots.com.\n\nLove For Low Voices\n\nMany beginning singers struggle with the high notes they hear from singers like Adam Levine, Ariana Grande, and Brendon Urie.\n\nThese singers, in addition to having years of training and well-developed mixed coordination, have naturally higher ranges.\n\nSee below for some fantastic lower-voiced singers, if you are an alto, baritone, or bass.\n\nAlso, check out our post on the best karaoke songs for low voices.\n\nLower-voiced female singers:\n\nAllison Moyet\n\nAmy Winehouse\n\nAnnie Lennox\n\nDiana Krall\n\nDua Lipa\n\nEtta James\n\nFiona Apple\n\nGrace Jones\n\nHelen Shapiro\n\nJanis Joplin\n\nJoan Jett\n\nKaren Carpenter\n\nLalah Hathaway\n\nLana Del Rey\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nNina Simone\n\nPeggy Lee\n\nShakira\n\nShania Twain\n\nStevie Nicks\n\nToni Braxton\n\nTracy Chapman\n\nLower-voiced male singers:\n\nAnthony Kiedis (Red Hot Chili Peppers)\n\nBarry White\n\nBeck\n\nBing Crosby\n\nBruce Springsteen\n\nCat Stevens\n\nDarius Rucker\n\nDavid Bowie\n\nDean Martin\n\nEddie Vedder\n\nElvis Presley\n\nFrank Sinatra\n\nGeorge Ezra\n\nJames Blake\n\nJohn Fogerty (Creedence Clearwater Revival)\n\nJohn Legend\n\nJohn Lennon\n\nJohn Mayer\n\nJohnny Cash\n\nLuther Vandross\n\nMatt Berninger (The National)\n\nMichael Buble’\n\nMick Jagger\n\nRandy Travis\n\nRingo Starr\n\nSerj Tankian\n\nAnd finally, if you’re a higher-voiced female singer who doesn’t belt, see below for some sopranos who use a lot of head voice in their sound:\n\nAlison Krauss\n\nAshanti\n\nAurora\n\nBillie Eilish\n\nBirdy\n\nBjörk\n\nBlossom Dearie\n\nEllie Goulding\n\nIngrid Michaelson\n\nJoan Baez\n\nKate Bush\n\nLily Allen\n\nRegina Spektor\n\nTori Amos\n\nFinding your “wheelhouse” takes time and a lot of experimentation.\n\nListen to music from different genres and eras, and find the styles that help you sound and feel your best when you sing.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow do I know which song suits my voice?\n\nExperiment with different songs and see which ones feel comfortable and natural to sing.
