Just a few words to describe a talen ted artist whose life was tragically ended due to\n\nalcohol poisoning. Amy Winehouse w as most known for her unique style of mus ic with a complex voice some\n\ndescribed as deep, expressive vocals and her eclect ic mix of musical genres, including soul rhythm and blue s, and\n\njazz.\n\nB. Amy W inehouse has a ded i cation to her music that drew me to her in mi ddle school and she became an\n\ninfluential part of my young life as I was grow ing up. She helped show me to be confident in myself and the way I\n\nchose to live my life as she lived he rs. (PERSONAL CONNECTION)\n\nC. The music we listen to is just as expressive as the clothes we wear and the way we car ry ourselves.\n\nD. T oday I would like to in troduce you all to the beautiful life of Amy W inehouse and how early life has influenced\n\nwhere she took her hold of her music, nex t I will describe her success based on her awa rds she has received as a\n\nyoung woman, and finally I will inform you all on the outstand ing foundation that has grown out of her life that her\n\nfamily has created to carry he r legacy , called the Amy W inehouse Foundation.\n\n(TRANSITION: First I would like to take you a ll back to Amy’ s early life.)\n\nBODY\n\nA. Amy’ s early life has cre ated a big part of the musical in fluences she brought into her own music.\n\n1. Being born into a Jewish family , Amy did not dedicate herself in the Jew ish schools and religion which\n\nlead her to rebel. She was kick ed out of two Jewish schools. Wh i ch lead to many of her famous songs f rom\n\nthe rebellion.\n\n2. Many of Amy’ s maternal uncles were professional jazz musicians. Amy's paternal grandmother , was a\n\nsinger and dated the English jazz saxophon ist Ronnie Scott. She and Amy's parents influenced Amy's interest\n\nin jazz. Her father , Mitch, often sang Frank Sinatra songs to her, and whenever she got chas tised at school.\n\n3. After toying around with her brother’ s guitar, Amy bought her own when she was 14 and began writing\n\nmusic a year later . Soon after , she began working for a living, in addition to singing with loca l group the\n\nBolsha Band, leading her to be seen by a man ager and within the next few years she released her first album.\n\n(TRANSITION: Next I will talk about the grea t successes that Amy worked for in her talented life .)\n\nB. Her unique style of music brought a lot of a ttention from around the world to her music, lead ing her to high amounts of\n\nsuccess in the music industry .\n\n1. W inehouse's debut album, Frank, was released on 20 Octob er 2003. The albu m entered the upper levels of the\n\nUK album chart in 2004 when it was nominated fo r Brit A wards in the categories o f \"British Female Solo Art ist\"\n\nand \"British Urban Act.\" It went on to achi eve platinum sales.\n\n2. Her follow-up album, Back to Black (2006), led to five 2008 Grammy A wards, tying the then record for the\n\nmost wins by a female artist in a single nigh t, and made her the first British woman to win five Gra mmys,\n\nincluding Best New Art ist, Record of the Y ear and Song of the Y ea r.\n\n3. W inehouse also later won Best C ontemporary Song again, this time for \"Rehab\"; and in 2008, Best Song\n\nMusically and L yr ically for \"Love Is a Losing Game.\" And also won the 2007 Brit A ward for Best British Female\n\nArtist, having been nominated for Best Br itish Album, with Back to Black.\n\n(TRANSITION: Finally , I would like to talk about how her Foundation has helped many lives.)\n\nC. After her tragic death, July 23, 201 1 her family started the great Amy Winehouse F oundation in honor of her memory .\n\n1. W ith an unfortunate amoun t of drug influence in her death, Amy W inehouse’ s family are using her tragic death\n\nto help other young and troubled teens fight ag ainst their drug and alcohol addiction.\n\n2. Her family uses what happened to suppo rt young girls and boys with, music therapy , resilience programs and\n\nmany more programs to help prevent another trag ic death like Amy’ s.\n\n3. This foundat ion has helped over thousands all over the UK and are starting to branch outside to the US and\n\nmore places in Europe in hopes to continue posi tive lives.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nA. In conclusion, even though Amy W inehouse lived for a short term, she was able to acco mplish such great\n\nachievements which has inspired many young artists to thrive as much as she did."
