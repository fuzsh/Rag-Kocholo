The singer was initially a jazz vocalist, but her music blossomed into an eclectic mix of jazz, pop, soul, and R&B. Her first two albums, Frank (2003) and Back To Black (2006), were critically acclaimed hits that made her an international award-winning star.\n\nFresh. Urban. Now. Those are the three words that best describe new artist Elyscia. Fresh off being on American Idol (2022) and will be on “The Voice” 2024 (Team Reba)! This attractive and talented songstress has been belting out tunes for most of her life. Her captivating voice has opened doors to sing background for R&B greats like Jennifer Hudson and Regina Belle, providing new platforms to showcase her exceptional musical skills. A Baltimore-based vocalist and songwriter, Elyscia is now taking her music worldwide with the release of her blazing debut single, “Nobody Else” on the One Vision Music, LLC, label.\n\n::concert, Keystone Korner Baltimore::In-person, Live-streamed, Indoor"
