I was 19 and she 21. My first impression of her was that she was unlike anyone I had ever met before. She was casually cool, with a north London accent and heaps of confidence. We met in a bar in the West End and ended up gallivanting round Soho – the Raymond Revuebar for Gay Bingo followed by too many drinks at the Shadow Lounge, where she was politely asked to leave for being too rowdy.\n\nOur friendship developed from there and there was mutual respect from the get-go. I can’t stress enough how normal we were as a group of young adults living in London, although perhaps looking back on it, that was just our normal. I suppose it was a bit strange that one of us had a team of people working for them and would be whisked away for weeks at a time to write and record. Her irreverent attitude made her intriguing but also normalised the situation. In the early days, we were totally unaffected by her success – she just happened to be an award-winning artist.\n\nI had worked in the industry since I was 16, when I assisted a fashion designer in my hometown of Fairford, Gloucestershire. By the time I met Amy, I had assisted two stylists and had started to work with some of the local bands in Camden. It was towards the end of 2006 that Amy asked me to work with her as her stylist. It was typical of Amy to want to create a family within her working environment, and I knew that I had been chosen perhaps more for my loyalty than my talent.\n\nI had a slightly bumpy start in the role at Jools Holland’s Hootenanny show where Amy’s self-described “Shirley Bassey” dress slipped down as the tit tape came unstuck, unable to resist the weight of the double dose of “chicken fillets” that she’d stuffed into the strapless M&S bra.\n\nThe audience got a little more than they or Paul Weller, who she was duetting with, had bargained for, to the horror of her team and to my intense dismay. Amy took it all in her stride. She shimmied about a bit while rearranging her bosom like an absolute pro. Fortunately for me, the show was pre-recorded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough her look had started to develop during her early years in Camden, largely influenced by the characters living there – the rockabillies, punks, ska and indie kids – it was in 2007 at the BRIT Awards when she made her debut as the Amy Winehouse that is so recognisable today.\n\nIt was one of the few times she had allowed some time before the event to do a fitting. Even then, Amy had insisted on cooking first, something that with her was always quite an event and involved a fair amount of red wine – terrifying when in the same vicinity as a fitting full of loaned designer pieces.\n\nTwo hours after my arrival, and some rather flavourless meatballs later, I finally managed to get her to pay attention for 15 minutes to the clothes I’d brought. We had dresses from Preen, Moschino and Armani, which she planned to change into before, during and after her performance.\n\nThis was an exciting prospect as it would score us some much-needed brownie points with the designers I was desperately trying to persuade to move us up the hierarchical list of loanees. The acid yellow Preen dress was pulled in as a wildcard, which was something I always did, something that pushed Amy slightly out of her comfort zone. I wanted to steer her away from a carbon-copy rockabilly look and encourage her to modernise it slightly, drawing inspiration from her multitude of musical references.\n\nOf course, no matter what I put her in, Amy was very much the architect of her ultimate appearance. It didn’t matter how armed I was with the correct underwear, tit tape, sewing kit, safety pins etc; she would always add the Amy edge, the imperfection of the look that ultimately was the ingredient that made her unique.\n\nClothes were often strewn all over the place and hung on door frames.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer Jeffrey’s Place house had a stained ceiling that always looked like it was threatening to cave in at any moment. It was constantly being redecorated as Amy would often change her mind about a wall colour or discover some new kitsch vintage wallpaper she liked. Action Man wallpaper adorned the stairwell, while the spare room was covered in a repeating pattern of creepy Thunderbird puppets, and the living room featured bamboo paper not dissimilar to the paper decorating Del Boy’s council flat in Only Fools and Horses.\n\nThe furniture was all mismatched but the whole place had a retro feel to it and it contained a Smeg fridge to which she would fix notes and pictures. When Amy was tidy she was a “take Polaroids of your shoes and stick them on the front of their box” kind of girl, but more often than not she was incredibly messy — never unclean — just very untidy. Clothes were often strewn all over the place and hung on door frames. Whatever activity she was engaged in, perhaps listening to records or writing notes, she left the objects exactly where they were when she moved on to the next one.\n\nThe year 2007 was a significant one for Amy. She had become internationally recognised, which for any musician is the ultimate achievement, but ironically it was also a contributing factor to her decline. She’d scooped up various awards and accolades, we’d shot the Back To Black music video in March and worked with David LaChapelle on the Tears Dry On Their Own video in May.\n\nI was booked to work with her on the European tour towards the end of the year. Amy was also seeing Blake Fielder-Civil again and, knowing how toxic this pairing had the potential to become, everyone in her inner circle was nervous and the atmosphere changed quite noticeably.\n\nI’m going to keep this brief and be as diplomatic as I can: Amy was no angel, and with a multitude of different issues brewing, she teetered on the edge of delinquency and frequently pushed the boundaries as far she could. Blake, on the other hand, brazenly pole-vaulted over them, and due to the type of person Amy was – “I don’t care if you don’t love me, I will lie down in the road, pull my heart out and show it to you” – she had already shackled herself to his ankles before anyone knew what was going on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Amy’s personal life became more chaotic, she became far more appealing to the paparazzi.\n\nAt this time, despite being her neighbour, I saw her only a few times a week briefly. By July 2008, we’d haphazardly made it through a BRIT Awards performance in February at which she held my hand right up until the last minute. In June, she performed at Glastonbury. She’d been buoyantly bouncing around backstage, chatting to Jay-Z, Beyonce and Jack White while I had practically gone purple with exasperation trying to get her into her dress only a few minutes before she was due onstage.\n\nGetting clean was a long and gruelling process with several heartbreaking relapses.\n\nIt took three of us to hoist her into the corseted, beaded Luella dress, which I sewed her into. Topped off with some cocktail umbrellas in her hair, she tottered off to give the band the usual hugs, kisses and words of encouragement. Sadly, what started reasonably well ended with a member of the audience grabbing her hair and receiving a thump in the face in return, which became the main focus of the performance afterwards. Amy’s violence towards others became a running theme in the press for a while as people tried to taunt her to get a reaction.\n\nWhen you are a kid and you become aware of drugs, you never imagine yourself becoming friends with an addict, let alone working with them, but I did. It has given me a much deeper understanding of addiction and the link to mental health. Addiction starts as a coping mechanism and progresses to alienation from loved ones, isolation from reality and then to self-destruction, which serves to deepen the initial wound that started you off in the first place.\n\nMiraculously, and against all odds, in January 2008, Amy had decided to get clean, thanks to the determination of her security team, her parents, her inner circle of loyal friends, and mainly, herself. However, getting clean was a long and gruelling process with several heartbreaking relapses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe night of the Grammy Awards in February 2008, Amy had just completed a reassuring stint of sobriety in hospital. That night was one of the most special and unforgettable nights we got to share with her and something that those who love her will treasure forever.\n\nIt was such a comfort that we got to see her reach such a monumental point in her career, while apparently healthy and happy. She was on top form. I had pulled in a Dolce & Gabbana dress that now resides in the Grammy Museum and a Tina Kalivas skirt, which we teamed with a basic bandeau top, which was very in keeping with Amy’s MO. I remember being asked to paint a bra on her topless shoulder tattoo, which depicted a pair of bare breasts. This I did using her Rimmel eyeliner, and we laughed backstage about how ridiculous it was. It was an easy but naive mistake to presume we were over the worst and that it would be plain sailing from here on in.\n\nDuring the eight weeks leading up to the show, Amy had been quite volatile.\n\nHowever, Amy’s fame had become something that was increasingly hard for everyone to navigate. Her small inner circle had dwindled owing to people’s understandable inability to cope with the situation, while her workforce had increased, with four new security guards working in shifts to ensure there was always one there 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It became harder and harder for people to be around her and she became more isolated. Without the anaesthetising self-medication of narcotics, the new reality of a heavily restricted life lived in the glare of publicity was starkly clear to Amy. Alcohol abuse continued to be a problem.\n\nIn 2010, I encouraged her to consider a Fred Perry collaboration. It was something that might get the creative juices flowing again. She was immeasurably excited about this on first introduction, and she immediately started making notes of what she wanted – linen mac coat, cashmere socks, Fred Perry wreath gold earrings. It was truly a beautiful thing to see her so engaged after a prolonged state of apathy.\n\nWe had about eight weeks to design and complete 11 dresses for her final European tour that ended before it had begun. And while I love them, as they are a culmination of five years of working together, I am at the same time reviled by them as they represent so much loss. During the eight weeks leading up to the show in Belgrade, Amy had been quite volatile. Weeks of sobriety and hope were interspersed with relapses of binge-drinking and despair. Her mental health had taken a nosedive and she was struggling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wrote her reassuring letters, bought her books she might find interesting and tried to make her healthy food, such as scrambled eggs and avocado for breakfast, which she loved. When she was doing well, she could be found cycling on her exercise bike, down in her studio bashing away at her drums or chatting away on the phone to friends. While the good days gave me hope of a more positive trajectory, the bad days were difficult.\n\nThe Belgrade show in June was the last time I worked with her. By this time, I had moved out [of her place] and lived in a house around the corner. The lack of sleep caused by her nocturnal behaviour was affecting my mental health and I felt like I wasn’t particularly useful in that state. The moment I told her, she cried, and I have felt dreadful about my decision ever since, even though I popped in most days to see her. Clearly, she felt I was abandoning her; it was awful.\n\nThe day of the show she was in her hotel room, which we often used as a dressing-room if she didn’t want to go to the venue too early. I noticed that she had been drinking, but I had no idea how much at that point. Thirty minutes before she was due onstage, I gave her water, begged her tour manager not to put her on stage and wiped off the smeared make-up she’d applied.\n\nShe managed to sober up marginally.Once at the venue, she put on her dress and proceeded to drink another glass of wine. At that moment I knew it was all over. That show should not have happened.\n\nA month later, I was about to head to the Secret Garden Party festival to meet a group of friends. Before I left, I popped over to Amy’s to drop off several possible outfits for her to wear to a wedding the following day.\n\nWhen I arrived, she was sound asleep, so I laid out the dresses on the sofa with shoes and accessories alongside, together with a note explaining the choice of outfits, where I was off to and that I’d see her when I got back on Sunday.\n\nWhen I arrived at the festival, Amy called me and we chatted briefly but, although she sounded in good spirits, she had clearly been drinking. We parted with the usual “love you, mamma”. It was the last time I spoke to her. The following day I had an anxiety attack and told my boyfriend I wanted to go home – something didn’t feel right. An hour later, a friend took me aside and said “Amy Winehouse is dead”. The words made no sense to me; I simply could not accept them.\n\nI travelled home completely numbed. We were taken to her home on Camden Square one last time to be around her. The outfits I had left for her to wear to the wedding were completely untouched. I went onto autopilot, helping prepare for the funeral, calling in a dress for Amy. It was not how I’d ever imagined our last show would be. I settled on a leopard print Dolce Gabbana dress, which I hope did her proud.\n\nToday I think about the sloppy kisses, the bummed cigarettes and the mouthful of hair I’d get when she hugged me, the nasally sound of her voice as she called my name and the saccharine smell of her perfume. She has left behind a big beehive-embellished hole in my heart and a legacy that will outlive us all.\n\nThis is an edited extract from Amy Winehouse: Beyond Black by Naomi Parry published by Thames & Hudson $60.00 on October 28.\n\nLoading"
