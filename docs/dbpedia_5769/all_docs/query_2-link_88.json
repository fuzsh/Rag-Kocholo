My weekly 'Belting Mouse' mail shows you how to. It gets you on track with stories and insights from my life as a singer and that of my students.\n\nFor 'little mice' who are tired of squeaking and want to start belting...\n\nAnd find out why you're closer to being a great singer than you think\n\nI teach singing online\n\nI make you a better singer already in the first hour\n\nNow that you have your song - how can you sing it better?\n\nWell, you can probably use some vocal technique, and there's nothing like an easy song to practice new technique with. There are even shorter range songs.\n\nWhere to start? I made a course that hunts for the vocal exercises that work best for you.\n\nRelated Posts"
