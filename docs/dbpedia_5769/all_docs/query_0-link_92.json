        "text": "AT just 27, British soul singer Amy Winehouse was found dead in her London apartment Saturday. The death is listed as unexplained.\n\nIn the end, Winehouse was better known for her brushes with the law and drug addiction than she was for her talent, and she was talented. She had a wonderful voice and a great musical style.\n\nWinehouse had the ability to bring soul music back to the mainstream, and for a while, she did. But she had been a non-factor in pop music for several years.\n\nThe last time she made news for her music was in 2008, when she dominated the Grammy Awards, winning five of six awards for which she was nominated, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year (for Rehab) and Best New Artist.\n\nShe dropped the Album of the Year category to Herbie Hancockâ€™s Joni Mitchell tribute album.\n\nAfter that, it was downhill for Winehouse, who never released a follow-up to her 2006 breakthrough album, Back to Black.â€ That album, which was energised by producer Mark Ronsonâ€™s throwback, Motown-style soul, established Winehouse as a bluesy, brassy diva with a dark bad girl streak.\n\nRehab, her most famous hit, found her playfully thumbing her nose at the help she needed to overcome her obvious demons, while You Know Iâ€™m No Good found her regretfully admitting that she was deeply disturbed.\n\nWithin a matter of a few months, her drug addled tabloid lifestyle would take centre stage. Her fans watched as she was arrested for assault, warned and featured doing drugs in a home video.\n\nHer spiral continued until 2008, when she was hospitalised with lung disease and covered in nicotine patches in order to break her from the worst of her addictions. We hoped she would recover.\n\nWe hoped to see another album just as good as Back to Black, but more importantly, we wanted to see her beat her addiction and survive. We wanted Winehouse to divorce Blake Feder-Civil and become a success story.\n\nShortly after her hospitalisation, Winehouse did divorce Blake Feder-Civil and the news stopped. There were no more tabloids pictures of a disoriented, bloody or beaten Winehouse. Was she getting better? Creating another album? We hoped.\n\nNews arrived in June. Winehouse underwent a brief stint in rehab to prepare her for an upcoming comeback tour. She even performed an impromptu concert in London at the 100 Club. She was sober. She talked to the fans, and everyone cheered. It looked like the old Amy was back.\n\nShe appeared well prepared for her concert in Belgrade. She was not. It was a disgrace. The singer stumbled, muttered and forgot the lyrics to her own songs. She went home.\n\nWe wondered what happened between the 100 Club and Belgrade. The tour spent about a day in limbo before the remaining dates were cancelled.\n\nWe, again, hoped Winehouse would recover; that this was just a brief bump on her road to becoming drug free.\n\nUnfortunately, that bump in the road turned out to be a mountain, and Winehouse was too sick to climb it.\n\nWould she have been able to make the comeback her fans and even her detractors hoped for? Now we will never know.\n\nBut even if her life and subsequent death are being romanticised, it is clear Winehouse is another in a long line of musicians who were gone too soon. It may not have been surprising, but it doesnâ€™t make it any less of a shame."
