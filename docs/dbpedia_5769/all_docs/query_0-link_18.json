        "text": "On Saturday, the music community lost one of its most talented singers.\n\nAmy Winehouse, the petite British songstress with the beehive hairdo, was found dead inside her home in London. She was 27.\n\nThe news was shocking but not all that surprising. Her documented struggles with heroin addiction and failed rehab stints made it painstakingly obvious that Winehouse was in need of serious help.\n\nHanging out with troubled tabloid regular Pete Doherty didn't exactly make things better.\n\nYet it seemed like her problems and constant appearance in tabloid headlines generated more chatter and discussion than her music.\n\nSadly, it felt like it was only a matter of time before the inevitable happened. And that is the most heartbreaking part of Winehouse's sudden departure.\n\nThe start of Winehouse's publicized downward spiral coincided with the release and success of her 2006 album \"Back to Black,\" which included the radio hit \"Rehab\" (the title even more ironic now than it was five years ago).\n\n\"Back to Black\" put Winehouse's raspy, seductive pipes on display and in turn helped usher in the retro soul movement, carried on by Sharon Jones, Duffy and Adele — all three of whom are incredible singers in their own right.\n\nIt felt like her fans were constantly rooting for her to clean up her act and straighten herself out once and for all. But the comeback never came.\n\nLike others in the \"27 Club\" — Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Robert Johnson and Kurt Cobain — Winehouse died too young and too soon, leaving us with only a glimpse of the greatness she was capable of.\n\nSo take a few minutes to look past the headlines and the paparazzi photos and appreciate Winehouse's talent."
