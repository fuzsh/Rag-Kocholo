        "text": "claire\n\nshe was amazing :) i really did enjoy it a lot! weldone amy x\n\nbilly\n\namazing fab\n\njames\n\nWas absolutely crap, left after first song to go see Panic. Get a grip girl!\n\nsam richards\n\nAmy, was amazing! Would love to see her again!\n\nLee\n\nmurdered the cupid song, rest of the set was ok, but not brilliant, get off the drugs and she could be brilliant!!\n\nEl Duderino\n\nY'all shoulda seen Beth Rowley in the Futures. Pure class, something that someone else 'ahem' seems to be lacking....\n\nDave H\n\nAmy is what can only described as a Legend! Shebelted out an amazing performance at T and lookd liked she enjoyed it. I thought dshe was amazing!\n\nSparkei\n\nExcellent performance. So pleased Amy made it to T this year. Well done Amy we love ya x\n\ngregor\n\nshe was rubbish. i threw my trainers at her. shoulda thought that one through, as bare feet and the prodigy don't mix.\n\njust-whatever-eh\n\nHeard both her & the Zutons versions of Valerie live. Her's was much, much worse than theirs.\n\nsophierobo'\n\nheyyy , ilovethissong \" lovesophie+megss\n\nPaul\n\nShe was amazing. Way better than Glastonbury. Shes getting better as the festival season gets on. Cant wait to see her a V!! she will be awesome\n\nlauren\n\ncome on hen get a wee grip of yourself you are so talented but so messed up its unbeleivible , people were not amused wi \"this song is dedicated to blake \" get him to bolt he is no good 4 u\n\nsandra\n\ncut her some slack, guys. the girls having a few problems! i met her after her set and she was lovely - not drunk at all. her set was just amazing and im so glad shes pulled herself together since glasto. you go girl!\n\nlauren\n\nleft after her second song,wast of a slot on the main stage and the crowd sang louder than her,the drugs have wasted her talent !! and to dedicate every song to BLAKE get a grip hen\n\nM\n\nAmy was amazing regardless of her lifestyle there is no denying that she is extremely talented people who didnt like it are idiots!!!!!\n\nLJC\n\nOMG she was rubbish left after 5 minutes what a waste of a slot on the main stage!\n\nfrancesca\n\nShe is a great singer but she barley talked to the fans. She needs to get off the drugs and she will be amazing again .. but i diddent really want 2 see her at titp so i went 2 panic insted\n\nIrma\n\nAs always Amy was great and unique\n\nMike\n\nAmy Winehouse was incredible at the weekend! all my mates dont like her purely because of her lifestyle, but her music (lyrics in particular) are simply brilliant!! right up there with my favourite performances this weekend! Well done Amy :D\n\nKT\n\nSorry, but she was the worst performer there, did have talent, but not any more. Lost cause.\n\nRyan\n\nNot bad but has to sort herself out\n\nReetPateet\n\nShes a joke, watched 5 minutes and left. Yes she has great voice but the rest of her is a joke! Sh brought hee haw to the party\n\ncolin\n\nShe was fantastic. My major highlight of the weekend. Closely followed by Primal Scream. She is the best talent around just now and it was a privelage to see and hear her : )\n\nAb\n\nLove Amy Winehouse BUT she was pretty crap, was well disappointed!\n\nBig Shons\n\nI was there and she was awesome. End of teh day she will not be here long with her lifestyle and all of us who saw her should feel honoured that one day we can we can say that we saw her live !\n\ndebbie\n\nooo my god she gets paid for that have the people they where in a better state than her cant belive we let our childern see the likes of that what msg is that to send out she need to take a good look at her self thank god for her back up singers and the crowed our a would not of made out one word of any soung she sang booooooooooooooo\n\nJoe\n\nAmy Winehouse is probably the most talented female singer of her time. Yes, she does have a drug addiction and I hope that she gets off them. Its great to see her in shape and singing live. Best singer everrrr!! Love u amy. X\n\nBash\n\nShe looked fab and i was impressed she turned up but the singing was shoddy to say the least!! Hope she gets better soon and starts putting on a better live performance!!\n\nLucy\n\nAn anti climax I think is the best way to descride her live performance at T in the Park.You wait full of anticipation and she was an average Karaoke Queen with one too many stimulants.\n\nLIZ\n\nWORST PERFORMANCE OF W'END\n\nbecca\n\nAmy is an amzing singer. yes she has let drugs take control but she just needs a little support and clearly her fans are not showing her it.\n\nredracer\n\nsorry about the spelling of junkie, but winehouse is still a disgrace. there are plenty of other female talents around who do not need drugs to write perform etc. she manages to get more coverage than these purely down to her way of life, rather than any talent which she may (or may not) have.\n\nJenni\n\none word FAB!!!Great to see her back and in better shape :)wonderful set and a joy to hear her live!!!\n\nweeshug\n\nthought she done ok,all the crowd went mental\n\nRob\n\nWithout a doubt Amy Winehouse was the worst act of the whole weekend, a serious disappointment, everyone else was awesome\n\nCarly\n\nGive the girl a break everyone, clearly by getting herself tpgether enough to manage a full performance she is making inroads to getting back on the straight and narrow. Might not be to everyones taste but she needs support now not negative comments. I still think you rock Amy good luck chick and well done! x\n\nStevie Mac\n\nWas 20 meters from the stage, she was average - that was all !\n\nDavid\n\nGenius is a word that has been used to abstraction to describe anyone who can put a few quid in their bank accounts.This girl truely deserves the title. I, for one, am privilaged to have seen her and heard her in my lifetime.Drugs? So what? If they made me sing and write songs like that I'd take them too.All I can add is to wish this beautiful singer all the best.Truely the finest artist of my generation.\n\nchris\n\nshe's fab!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nBryan\n\nAmazing! Great performance! I love how she defied all her critics are turned up to all the festivals and gave outstanding performances! to those who say they can't undertstand what she's saying, that isn't because she's drunk, it's her style! it's how singers of that genre sing! sultry and slurry jazz and blues kind of voice! it's what makes her stand out from the rest! love you Amy! x\n\nFinbar\n\nher talent is lost in the truelly crap performance......same!\n\nDave F\n\nOk, yes Amy has got talent and yes, she has allowed the drugs to take control of her life. what baffles me about this whole situation is the scared girl inside dosen't need to be scared anymore, you are more than able to take control whilst staying clean, you just needs the right role models, most of the people she mixes with are all doing the same. If i had a chance to talk to Amy i would tell her \"For your own good, break away from the pack and stand alone, do this for yourself, make your Dad, Mum & all of your fans proud by showing us the real you\". or one day Kurt Cobain will come back and haunt us. which would be absolutely tradegy. Love yourself more Amy...we do.\n\nEll\n\nI really like amy winehouse, think shes got an amazing voice but i have to say that she was struggling at T in the park as u can tell by the video, and its a terrible shame.\n\ngazz\n\nloved the giggle at 28.36 - some advice tho Amy - dump the Blake - he's not worth it\n\nH\n\namy is fab amazing brilliant hope she gets well soon\n\nSnuffy\n\nAmy you rock my world......\n\nToiletDuck\n\nBring on the Zutons!\n\nAdelle\n\nIf Ye Cannae Stand her Dont Bother Looking At Her Performances Or Commenting Its Simple Eh!!!\n\nD\n\nAnother average performance where you cannot quite tell if she is wanting to be there or not. Not sure why she gets some much coverage.\n\nharas\n\nwell done amy better than glasto great show\n\nnicola dickson\n\namy was amazing!\n\nxxEvexx\n\nSaw her live at Titp an all i can say is she looked petrified most of the time, but hey we didnt expect her to show up so theres something!!!!\n\nLA\n\nLast year she didn't show - this year it's great she did. Way to go Amy. Now, if you could only cut out all the nasty stuff in your life. All the best Amy.\n\nsharkey guy\n\nthis chrisalex should shut up who cares if her performance is not perfect shes my fav solo artist at the moment and way better than kate nash\n\nnik\n\ni'm sure this must be a case of the emperors new clothes!rubbish\n\nTerry\n\nBetter than Glasto and what a vioce, mime ? no chance true class act\n\nLouise\n\nAmy is nothing without the superb backing from the musicians in her group.\n\nSANDY\n\nI just adore her,great to see her performing\n\nLee\n\nWhat a waste of such talent. Amy your great but the drugs are not.\n\nJohn Ireland\n\nAmy is Janis Joplin meets Billie Holiday. No greater compliment. Just ditch the drugs and the husband and you can be the greatest jazz/blues singer that Britain has ever produced.\n\nbeast of balado\n\nshe looked in great shape, and sung an amazing gig. she has the most amazing voice\n\nJill\n\nHow many Stars do take drugs that we dont know about? At least Amy upfront and not hiding anything....\n\nJonny\n\nShe's proper rock and roll, not knowing whether she'll show up and all the antics.At least she's got some character.Long live Winehouse\n\nMarc\n\nWhat an amazing genuine rock star.\n\nchris rodgers\n\nWhy does the face she does drugs have to come into this?It was a good performance as always\n\nTC\n\nAll I ever hear is how great her live sets are.....then I see them! She is awful live now and she never used to be. It's true....the drugs don't work!\n\nEd\n\nI can barely make out the lyrics? She sounds like she is drunk!\n\nNicola\n\nAgree she is very talented; absolutely love her album. However, this was not a good performance. So disappointed.\n\nnicky G\n\nCome on Amy dont waste your life and your wonderful talent . we are here with you xx\n\npeter kolo\n\nwhat a joke how does she get away with a performance like that\n\ntommy jhonson\n\nwhat a disgrace mumbled her way through the set could hardly keep in time with the music.Its funny how everything sounds amazing when u have had 3 cases of tennants\n\nGouranga\n\nShame to waste such a talent. She should give up her bad habits and get her life together. She's hot. Good at her bit. Wish the lady well. Gouranga\n\ntam\n\nlove wino...she always suprises us with each gig. :)\n\namy\n\namyyy\n\njimmy\n\nthe drugs dont work listen to the verve amy\n\nDerek\n\nAmy Winehouse is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\npete\n\nwhy would you take the time to write about her if you 'cant stick her' ? shes totally wicked (drugs or no drugs)\n\nChrisAlex\n\nWhat a waste. Such a great sound and voice but her lifestyle is ruining her live stuff and I think it's fair to say she may well come to a tragic end at this rate. I saw a report from Glasto in which some young girl fans were raving about her gig, even tho she mostly staggered about, mumbled most her set and got a bit punchy. Not cool. Some role model.\n\nNicola chandler\n\nOK XXXX NIC\n\n~T~\n\nLooks like I'll have to suffer this to be in with a shout for REM and Kings of Leon. Can't stick her.\n\nJK\n\nI absolutely love la Winehouse, OK shes on drugs but you can't deny shes got the most amazing talent..."
