        "text": "Ten years ago on Friday, the world lost a rare talent: Amy Winehouse.\n\nWinehouse’s bodyguard discovered her body in her London apartment. The 27-year-old jazz singer died of alcohol poisoning.\n\nPart of Winehouse’s early appeal was that she and her music were unique.\n\nWinehouse was unassuming and didn’t speak with a posh accent.\n\nWhen her album, “Back to Black,” came out in 2006, it garnered all kinds of awards and broke records.\n\nRelated: ‘Homeland and life’: The chant to Cuba’s anti-government protests\n\nThe World’s host Marco Werman saw her perform live once, after “Back to Black” came out.\n\n“She looked fragile when she stepped out on stage, didn’t connect with the audience, did not smile like a star. … She fidgeted and played nervously with her fingers. But when she opened her mouth to sing, the confidence was all there.”\n\nMarco Werman, host, The World\n\n“She looked fragile when she stepped out on stage, didn’t connect with the audience, did not smile like a star,” he said. “She fidgeted and played nervously with her fingers. But when she opened her mouth to sing, the confidence was all there.”\n\nOne clip he listens to over and over is Winehouse’s rendition of “Valerie.”\n\nRelated: ‘I can speak the language of rhyme:’ Dakota Camacho on Guam family and hip hop\n\nBut fame and celebrity suddenly became overwhelming.\n\nPlenty has been said about her substance abuse, romantic ups and downs and the mind-bending pressures of show business that she faced.\n\nBut today, we remember Winehouse through her music.\n\nClick on the audio player above to hear more of our tribute to the late star."
