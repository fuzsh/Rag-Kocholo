        "text": "Are there any?\n\nThere's nobody who sounds exactly like Amy. But there are a number of British vocalists who have a soulful or bluesy approach to their singing. Beverly Knight, Joss Stone, Adele. But my favourite British soul/blues singer out of the lot is soul diva Maggie Bell, who was doing it before any of that lot were even born, and arguably better.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klYe_rZ_DoY&feature=related\n\n0\n\nI agree, no one out there like Amy. A few artists i would recommend though around her genre would be Norah Jones and if you like quirkyness, then Paloma Faith as well.\n\n0\n\nNaya Rivera's done pretty good covers of Valerie and Back to Black on Glee. Obviously Amy's are better, but Naya has an amazing voice.\n\n0\n\nI haven't seen much of Amy but I watched the youtube of her duet with Tony Bennett and my first thought was 'Billie Holiday'...........and that's a pretty high bar !\n\n0\n\nA little known artist over here, but getting a lot of attention down under is Kimbra, who I would put in a similar genre to Amy. Example here:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bF6QipA3iQ\n\n0"
