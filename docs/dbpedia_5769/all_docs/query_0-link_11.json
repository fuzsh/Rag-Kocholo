        "text": "News stories of Amy Winehouse’s untimely death often described her as a blue-eyed soul singer, a phrase long disdained by music writers. The shorthand reference for white artists “singing black” has been so indiscriminately applied – from Michael Bolton to Rick Astley – it’s been stripped of its intended meaning, which was always a dubious one in any case, given soul’s track record of melding musical influences and personnel. Yet in one sense, the refloating of the discredited term had accidental value. It prompted the recognition that Amy, steeped in blues, jazz and R&B, was a kind of throwback to the original purveyors of soul in the UK in the mid-1960s – when the term had some faint currency – in an often-ignored chapter of the domestic music scene.\n\nThe story of British rock’s emergent years is usually told via the “rediscovery” of American blues by the likes of Alexis Korner, The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds and The Animals, or of The Beatles’ absorption of the lighter, teen-influencing early rock’n’rollers. From there, the narrative generally moves swiftly on to psychedelia and supergroups, with soul just thought of as a Tamla Motown-centred sideline.\n\nFor many young British singers in bands of that period, however, blues and rock’n’roll amounted to expressive cul-de-sacs, the average beat or pop band had little call for a distinctive vocalist, and the lingering jazz movement was the domain of the instrumentalist. It was only American soul, which uniquely blended the melodic, the gutsy and the danceable, that enabled singers to reclaim centre stage.\n\nIf UK soul has never properly received its dues, though, it’s not entirely surprising. Emerging from the jazz clubs, it eludes firm definition, performers and their backing bands flip-flopping across the genres, readily slipping blues or jazz classics like Stormy Monday or Summertime into their repertoires. Cover versions of what became soul standards – In The Midnight Hour, Knock On Wood – proliferated, and the cloned, hand-me-down feel was underscored by a number of American soul artists who, unable to make it big Stateside and finding more receptive audiences in British cities, took up residence here.\n\nThe hedonistic quality of a lot of UK soul, with its emphasis on good times and poppy danceability, also contributed to its underground status, and it was adopted by young mods who relished its working class unpretentiousness and its stylishness. No one listens to soul for lyrical insight, but the absence of the testifying ingredient that sanctified the offerings of the likes of Otis Redding and Aretha Franklin somehow lowered British soul’s image in the eyes of purists.\n\nYet today, if you listen to the best of this music with an unprejudiced ear, all you hear is talent bursting through the speakers. As Duke Ellington said, there’s no such thing as genres, only good and bad music, and at its best, this stuff still packs a punch.\n\nAnd for all its earnestness and eclecticism, as singers strove for “authenticity”, in its angular quality, its mod beats with brass, reeds and organs often to the fore, there is often a distinctly British feel to the sound. And of UK soul’s imported stars, sometimes sniffily regarded as second-division talents at the time, it is hard to listen now to PP Arnold, Jimmy James and Herbie Goins and not feel that they could easily have been snapped up by a savvy American label to find success.\n\nUK’s soul’s heyday was short lived though, and its peak was centred around 1965-1966. By the late ’60s many top American soulsters were touring the UK and their music was more readily obtainable in this country on vinyl. The sounds they were producing were also becoming heavier and funkier, and next to them, the lighter beats favoured by British musicians made them seem like flyweights. The failure of UK soul to evolve into anything – its exponents drifting off into crossover fields, cabaret, or joining other bands in other genres – is another reason for its low critical profile.\n\nYet few of these artists lost the soul thread entirely, and many carried on with live performances – just what their fans liked best anyway, since it was often argued that the raucous energy of their gigs was somehow lost in the studio. Happily, many of the names below can still be seen today, tonsils still gloriously intact. Catch them while you can. The following is a far from definitive sampling of names from an often-overlooked epoch in Britain’s musical heritage.\n\nGEORGIE FAME\n\nOne of the most underrated voices in American soul was that of the rotund, prodigiously gifted Billy Stewart. When he toured the UK, domestic soulmen on the same bill watched in awe, hoping some of the vocal magic might rub off. You’d think, then, that when Georgie Fame recorded one of Stewart’s best songs Sitting In The Park in 1966, he was leaving a big hostage to fortune.\n\nBut listen to the two tracks today: Stewart’s cut is a grand affair, featuring his trademark falsetto, a brilliant talent glorying in his mellifluousness. Fame can’t – doesn’t even try to – compete on range, and yet he’s the one who gets to the heart of the song. He sings, “Sitting here on the bench/ With my back against the fence” and you really see him there, the callow youth awaiting his girl; Stewart, you sense, wouldn’t risk getting his suit dusty.\n\nFame and his Blue Flames were at the coal face of 60s Brit soul. During their residency at London’s Flamingo Club from 1962, the band were a major draw for UK-based American servicemen, and black GIs, moved by Fame’s soulful sincerity, gifted him with hard-to-get vinyl from back home. His sets grew to mix R&B, blues, jazz, Motown and ska, and the album, Rhythm & Blues At The Flamingo, released in 1964, captured the intensity of these all-nighters. A single, Yeh, Yeh, even booted The Beatles off the No 1 spot the same year.\n\nIn 1965, Fame was the only white act on the bill in the first Motown Revue to visit Britain – a ploy to lift slow ticket sales. But it seems fitting for other reasons. Motown was the lighter shade of soul and Fame was no Southern shouter. His mild, gently swinging style, the purring organ and the placing of sax and keyboards ahead of guitars in the mix gave his material a jazzier, more rounded sound than the edgy angularity of most beat music, though the fake American inflections in his delivery sound dated now.\n\nAfter the big-selling album of 1966, Sweet Thing (its title track sourced from Motown), and a cover of Bobby Hebb’s Sunny, Fame moved on to more commercial pastures, losing the interest of his original core fans.\n\nHERBIE GOINS\n\nIt’s worth remembering that while the prevalence of cover versions in 60s Brit soul may seem unimaginative to us, at the time these numbers were unfamiliar to UK audiences and the US versions were only played by hip club DJs. And when they sounded as good as when delivered by Herbie Goins And The Nightimers, it must have been hard to care that they weren’t originals.\n\nGoins, a Florida-born, New York-raised ex-US serviceman, had added a dash of uptown vocal class to Alexis Korner’s Blues Incorporated before joining The Nightimers in 1964. Their recorded legacy amounts to a single album and a couple of singles made for Parlophone at Abbey Road, under Beatles engineer and, later, Pink Floyd producer Norman Smith (who, as Hurricane Smith, would release a handful of category-defying pop-soul singles in the early 70s, notably the exquisite Babe, What Would You Say).\n\nHerbie Goins and the Nightimers majored in percussion-heavy dancers, their biggest track being the snake-hipped groover No 1 In Your Heart, first cut by the minor Motown group The Monitors. Goins had a rich, authoritative-sounding tenor voice which was well up to meeting the smoother crooning requirements of such as the Mann- Weil penned Good, Good Lovin’, but despite drawing criticism back home for entangling himself with “blue-eyed soul”, he completely endorsed the British scene. Cruisin’, which pointed to his jazz leanings, was written by John McLaughlin, who had a spell in the line-up – as did Linda Lewis, another British soul favourite. A classic example of an underground soul act, The Nightimers never broke through at chart level, and Goins eventually moved to Italy, where he still performs.\n\nLONG JOHN BALDRY\n\nListening to Long John Baldry recordings today, it’s not always easy to appreciate that his standing was once so high that when he derided The Small Faces hit Sha La La La Lee, Steve Marriott, who idolised him, was devastated. Back then, Baldry saw himself primarily as a bluesman, performing with Blues Incorporated and Cyril Davies’ All Stars, the latter becoming Long John Baldry & The Hoochie Coochie Men on Davies’s untimely death in 1964.\n\nBaldry certainly was a talented vocalist, his range spanning from Jimmy Witherspoon-style swing and Bobby Bland-esque balladry to gutbucket blues and overwrought soul in the style of The Righteous Brothers. The trouble is, to modern ears there’s an excess of ham, and he sounds like he’s enjoying it all a bit too much, whereas the X factor in a soul vocal is that the singer sounds like they are experiencing pain as well as ecstasy.\n\nNevertheless, his 1966 album Looking At Long John handsomely showcased his versatility, and included a good version of Ray Pollard’s big beat ballad The Drifter. The popular view is that Baldry sold out when he joined Pye and cut Let The Heartaches Begin – blue-eyed soul at its most camp – but at least it gave him the hit he craved. Other numbers like Long And Lonely Nights, Stay With Me Baby and Since I Lost You Baby were satisfying essays in the kind of big-orchestrated, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink productions the label favoured for its white soul performers at the time.\n\nIt was mostly downhill from there, though, long resident in Canada, he’d got back to his blues roots towards the end. His last album, Remembering Leadbelly, released in 2001, was one of the best things he ever did. Still, it was sad to see him playing small venues in the UK to stonily unappreciative audiences. When he died in 2005, the most interesting thing about him for obituarists was his role in fostering Rod Stewart’s career as a member of The Hoochie Coochie Men, and for his later band Bluesology having featured a young Reg Dwight (Elton John) in its ranks.\n\nDUSTY SPRINGFIELD\n\nJust like today, Britain wasn’t short of high-profile female soloists in the mid-60s. There was Marianne Faithfull and Sandie Shaw, with their joyous girl pop; Cilla Black, the Mersey foghorn; and Petula Clark, pure as a mountain stream, her material marred by off-the-peg production values. Dusty, though, had a sophistication vaguely comparable to Dionne Warwick, mixing breathy transatlantic intimacy with English cool.\n\nHer early solo singles, I Only Want To Be With You, which chugged into the UK Top 5 in 1963, and Stay Awhile, imitated the sound of American girl groups, and were some of the best approximations of the Phil Spector Wall Of Sound achieved in a British studio at that time. All her mid-60s albums contained a fix of soul covers, favouring the more uptown, Brill Building-style material, including I Just Don’t Know What To Do With Myself, It Was Easier To Hurt Him, and most gorgeously of all, Some Of Your Lovin’. All sounded great, and her covers of Maxine Brown’s Oh No Not My Baby and Baby Washington’s That’s How Heartaches Are Made had the extra bonus of alerting the unaware to the matchless originals.\n\nDusty cut the biggest-selling British soul album of the 60s, but the irony is, Dusty In Memphis was recorded in the US for Atlantic and was produced by Jerry Wexler, Tom Dowd and Arif Mardin in 1968. It features some of the deep South’s best session musicians, and the vocal backing of The Sweet Inspirations. Resisting the temptation to strive for a grittier style which was alien to her, the result is pure Dusty. Listen to Son Of A Preacher Man if you need to measure her talent. Where Aretha delivered the song with typically preachy fervency, loud and demanding, Dusty sang it in close-up, uncovering an earthy sensuality in the lyric absent from the earlier gospelish treatment.\n\nGENO WASHINGTON\n\nGeno Washington didn’t woo and charm an audience so much as belt it into submission, with a relentless assault of noisy, high-tempo stompers. On the live albums that are the chief legacy of his peak years, his voice sounds like it had been smelted in a blast-iron furnace – there’s no attempt at modulation. But if subtlety was a stranger at a Geno gig, he stirred near-adoration in his crowds for his breathless energy and enthusiasm.\n\nAn Indiana-born serviceman who’d stayed on in Britain after his US Army dispatch, he was soon unofficially crowned Britain’s No 1 soul man. Even now, listening to Hand Clappin’ Foot Stompin’ Funky-Butt… Live! it’s easy to understand how such fervour was generated. The musicians in Washington’s Ram Jam band were as effective as their leader in keeping up the rollicking pace. The sense of building momentum is irresistible, songs screeching to an abrupt halt, and the rhythm scarcely breaking stride as the band cranks up for another motor-mouthed, high-speed hip shaker, urged on by delirious fans. This album was such a smash in 1966 that it stayed in the Top 10 of the UK album charts for 10 months, and the follow up, Hipsters, Flipsters, Finger-Poppin Daddies!, also troubled the Top 10 a year later.\n\nAs a singles artist Geno was less successful, even though in the studio he showed greater sensitivity. Michael, a cover of a gem by the CODs, was inexplicably ignored, and the self-penned I’ve Been Hurt By Love are classy productions, oozing the sensibility of the genuine soul man that Washington, for all his crowd-pleasing antics, has remained to this day. He has recently released a 2-CD live album, It’s Geno Time, on Secret (SECDD 036)\n\nCHRIS FARLOWE\n\nSome only know Chris Farlowe for his solo chart-topper Out Of Time. They’ve not even scratched the surface. Farlowe was a major league talent, and could still stampede a herd of elephants with that roaring bull of a voice. But while he and his band The Thunderbirds accrued a hot reputation in the clubs around the same time as Georgie Fame, they had difficulty capturing the dynamics in the studio and major recognition proved elusive. Even 1964’s Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, a stoned-out mod take on Billy Boy Arnold’s I Wish You Would with a killer keyboard riff, failed. Farlowe’s delivery on a pounding B-side version of Hound Dog owed more to Big Mama Thornton than Elvis Presley.\n\nThe next single Buzz With The Fuzz showed that The Thunderbirds could also be quite jazzy, but the record was pulled once EMI wised up to Farlowe’s reference to “rolling up a joint”. Many argue that the singer’s Stormy Monday Blues is the pre-eminent British blues recording of all time. Farlowe released it as Little Joe Cook for the Sue label, with Albert Lee on guitar, and fooled many people into thinking he was a little-known black bluesman.\n\nJoining Andrew Loog Oldham’s Immediate in 1966, Farlowe’s first EP for the label included Mr Pitiful and In The Midnight Hour, regulation covers for the time but which epitomised Farlowe’s easy absorption of the gutsier Stax stylists.\n\nOut Of Time and Ride On Baby were poppier, but defined his wheezy, gruffly menacing style. These tracks were Jagger/ Richards cast-offs, and boasted Mick in the producer’s seat. So did many of the tracks laid down for Farlowe’s Immediate albums 14 Things To Think About and The Art Of Chris Farlowe, which embraced everything from covers of beat ballads (It Was Easier To Hurt Her) to Northern soul (Looking For You), and the musicianship and orchestrations were excellent (listen, for instance, to the rollicking Tom Jones-flavoured Headlines). One track from The Art Of also included the Farlowe-written North South East West, on which Tina Turner and the Ikettes sang backing.\n\nFarlowe would have stints with jazz and hard rockers Colosseum and Atomic Rooster respectively, returning to his bluesy roots in recent years. But record-wise, he has never sounded more soulful than during the Immediate period, and this material must count as one of the definitive bodies of work in the genre.\n\nJIMMY JAMES\n\nIf you were looking for a singer on the club scene of the mid-60s who most equated, in look and timbre, to the archetypal image of the classic American soul singer, you couldn’t have gone far wrong with Jimmy James, even though he was Jamaican. However, his band The Vagabonds adhered to a very British blueprint – riffing saxes, Hammond organ and a driving rhythm section. The histrionics which, unlike with Geno Washington, were absent from James as a stage presence, were supplied by another band member, Count Prince Miller, later to enjoy a lengthy reggae career.\n\nThe result was an outfit which enjoyed a huge following in London clubs such as The Marquee, but despite having Peter Meaden, the mentor of The Who, as its manager, landed practically zero record-selling success. James had scored a hit in his homeland with the sweet mid-tempo romancer Come To Me Softly, and he released a stack of singles after arriving in Britain with The Vagabonds in 1964. The yearning cover of Barrett Strong’s This Heart Of Mine is a classic example of James’s warm, plaintive style, but the only minor chart success would come with a gorgeous reading of Neil Diamond’s Red Red Wine, backed by a B-side classy enough for a release in its own right, Who Could Be Loving You.\n\nDisillusioned with their lack of success, The Vagabonds split in 1970, but James reformed them in the mid-70s with a new line-up, and scored a long chart success in 1976 with two disco-orientated numbers, I’ll Go Where The Music Takes Me and Now Is The Time. The singer, with yet another manifestation of The Vagabonds, remains a presence on the live scene, usually at weekenders or on nostalgia package dates.\n\nPP ARNOLD\n\nMany American performers – Marv Johnson, Donnie Elbert, and Inez and Charlie Foxx among them – travelled to Britain after their records cut a dash on the club scene, but none so embraced the distinctly British mod/beat element in the soul sound of the period than PP Arnold. The fact that she dated Steve Marriott has sealed her place in the mod hierarchy. Pint-sized but big-voiced, Pat Arnold was born in Los Angeles. She was an Ikette and supported The Rolling Stones on a UK tour in 1966 and was rapidly signed to Andrew Oldham’s label, where she was dubbed “The First Lady of Immediate.”\n\nHer style dovetailed perfectly with that of the company’s. On her most widely played track If You Think You’re Groovy, written for her by Marriott and Ronnie Lane, she cuts loose over against a typically rollicking Small Faces’ arrangement, complete with parpy horns and rubbery bass. Inexplicably, it didn’t even make the Top 40. Perhaps Arnold didn’t sound girly enough, even though she sometimes affected the slightly off-key vibrato favoured by many British female vocalists of the time (Dusty Springfield, Sandie Shaw).\n\nShe also embraced the mood for folksy stylings, notably on Cat Stevens’ The First Cut Is The Deepest (No 18). In contrast, Everything’s Gonna Be Alright, her first single for Immediate in 1967, and If You See What I Mean, are bouncing Mod heaven, but she could also shriek like a pedigree Southern soulstress, her self-penned Treat Me Like A Lady perhaps a personal taste indicator. Her other hit was a version of Chip Taylor’s Angel Of The Morning, which stalled at No 29 when the label hit distribution troubles.\n\nHer most sensitive performance? Try Life Is But Nothing, given the Spector treatment when Immediate labelmate Chris Farlowe recorded it, but which she pared back to wistful acoustic basics. The production values on these recordings show that, at their best, British studios could produce soul music that stood on its own merits without looking over its shoulder to Stax, Atlantic or Motown. Arnold is still performing, looking and sounding amazing.\n\nCLIFF BENNETT\n\nAlmost any British town or city seems to have made some sort of contribution to the 60s soul scene. From Liverpool, The Chants were an all-black teenage vocal group favouring doo-wop stylings, though one of its members, Eddie Amoo, would enjoy more prominence a decade on with The Real Thing. Another Liverpudlian, Kenny Lynch, cut some great 45s, including the collectable Movin’ Away, but found more fame as a comedian. In Birmingham, The Spencer Davis Group were bluesier and rockier, but had a couple of hits courtesy of their fruitful liaison with Jamaican singer Jackie Edwards, Keep On Running and Somebody Help Me. Like the Chants, lead singer Stevie Winwood was another precocious talent – only 18 in 1966 – and his Ray Charles-flavoured vocals and occasional scorching Hammond solos added to the soulful cocktail. Bournemouth gave us the extrovert singer and keyboardist Zoot Money. His Big Roll Band were never great “hit parade” contenders (Big Time Operator, reaching no 25 in 1966, was their biggest seller), but they were dynamic favourites on the club scene.\n\nThen there was Slough, from whence came Cliff Bennett who, as frontman of his band The Rebel Rousers, specialised in jauntier, straight-up R&B and soul. The Rebel Rousers were a typical example of the eager, energetic, but not always entirely convincing way young British musicians were increasingly adopting soul inflections. One Way Love was their first hit, in 1964, with appealing, squawky saxes and “spooky” falsettos accompanying Bennett’s always spry, throaty vocals.\n\nBy this time, they were within the Brian Epstein management stable, but their biggest coup was securing Paul McCartney to produce their cover of his Got To Get You Into My Life, registering their biggest success in 1966. The band were unable to follow this up, and Bennett And The Rebel Rousers would part company in 1968, the singer pursuing a harder rock career.\n\nSHARON TANDY\n\nSome artists are remarkable for epitomising their time, others by standing apart from it, and Sharon Tandy definitely falls into the latter category, which perhaps explains her\n\nfailure to register with the wider British\n\npublic. Still, if Kiki Dee was the first British\n\nwhite soul singer to be signed by Motown in\n\n1970, Tandy, some four years earlier, had\n\nthe honour of becoming the first white artist\n\nto record for Stax, sounding utterly at home\n\nin the company of Booker T and the MGs\n\non One Way Street and I Can’t Get Over It.\n\nAs if that wasn’t enough, while in\n\nEngland and signed to Atlantic UK she also\n\nhad the Fleur de Lys as her backing band.\n\nThis fruitful union yielding one of the all-time\n\ngreat mod tracks, Hold On. While it’s\n\nBryn Haworth’s blazing guitar solo that\n\ngarners most attention, Tandy’s breathy\n\nvocal is surely one of the most memorable\n\nand timeless in rock history. Its flipside,\n\nDaughter Of The Sun, was similarly\n\narresting, proving that Tandy was a natural\n\nrisk taker. In truth these two tracks were\n\nmore what would later be dubbed freakbeat\n\nthan soul, but Hurry Hurry Choo Choo\n\nstraddled the two genres, and Tandy and the\n\nband delivered something of the tightness\n\nthat was the hallmark of Stax itself.\n\nEven when recording in the more\n\nconventional, heavily orchestrated “blue-eyed”\n\nidiom (Perhaps Not Forever, Stay\n\nWith Me), Tandy sounded totally\n\nunconventional and edgy.\n\nHow did she never become a star? Born\n\nin Johannesburg, she’d arrived in the UK in\n\n1964, but her sojourn was to be all-too\n\nshort-lived. She returned to South Africa in\n\n1970 leaving a small, but fascinating legacy\n\nof music that sounds so fresh it could have\n\nbeen recorded yesterday.\n\nJOHNNY JOHNSON & THE BANDWAGON\n\nSoul-lite or, as its bitterest critics called it,\n\n“bubblegum pop” was another offshoot of\n\nthe genre which, predictably, found it easier\n\nto score on the singles charts. The\n\nFoundations (Baby, Now That I’ve Found\n\nYou) were a fine example, majoring on soft\n\nharmonies, while The Flirtations (Nothing\n\nBut A Heartache) were effectively a British\n\ngirl group manqué of The Supremes.\n\nAlso at the lighter-than-air end was\n\nJohnny Johnson & The Bandwagon, and\n\nAmerican line up remembered almost\n\nexclusively for Breakin’ Down the Walls of\n\nHeartache. Thanks to its crisp, snare-drum\n\npropelled beat and Johnson’s rough-edged,\n\nDavid Ruffinesque lead vocal, it reached\n\nNo 4 in the UK in 1968. The success of the\n\nsingle in this country – it was ignored in the\n\nUS – prompted a nationwide tour by the\n\nquartet, taking in venues like the Twisted\n\nWheel, where the reception was such that\n\nJohnson took up residence here.\n\nBlame It (On the Pony Express) and\n\nSweet Inspiration were other singles in the\n\nsame catchy vein. The problem was that this\n\nsound quickly became mechanical, and\n\nJohnson’s voice lacked depth. Still, the\n\nsummery essence of these tunes remains\n\nwarmly evocative of their era.\n\nSTEVE MARRIOTT\n\nIt’s been claimed that Steve Marriott was\n\nBritain’s greatest ever soul singer. That’s\n\nhard to stand up when you hear the hard-to-\n\nforgive, curiously whinnying cover of I\n\nCan’t Stand The Rain he recorded with\n\nHumble Pie. Marriott was probably too\n\nladdish, in any case, to be a true soul man.\n\nWhat is undeniable is that he was the\n\nprogenitor of an English hybrid that took\n\nwings during the relatively short lifespan of\n\nThe Small Faces and ended with that\n\nband’s demise in 1969.\n\nIf Chris Farlowe occupied the stage like a\n\nbarrel-chested nightclub bouncer, and the\n\nlooming Long John Baldry swayed softly like\n\na poplar tree in the breeze in time to the\n\nmusic, Marriott was a tiny cockney sparrow\n\nwith doll-like features. That appearance left\n\nyou unprepared for the sinewy, throaty power\n\nof the little East End boy’s voice.\n\nThe Small Faces were essentially a pop-rock\n\nband though, and with Marriott a few\n\nyears younger than Farlowe, Fame and\n\nBaldry, they symbolised a newly experimental\n\nera of British psychedelia, their sound\n\ngradually shedding the American roots\n\nheritage that Marriott’s early idols loyally\n\nadhered to. So it’s the band’s early Decca\n\nrecordings that are of most interest here –\n\nthey have a basic, startling menace, of\n\nwhich the most elemental force is Marriott’s\n\nvoice. Listen to the lacerating nastiness of his\n\ntake on Timi Yuro’s What’s A Matter Baby,\n\nthe B-side to the hardly less malevolent\n\nWhatcha Gonna Do About It. Their only No\n\n1 single, All Or Nothing, mod soul’s greatest\n\nanthem, also belonged to this period – as did\n\nits impressive flip, Understanding."
