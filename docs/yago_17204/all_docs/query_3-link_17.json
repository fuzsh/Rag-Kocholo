Impacted by historical changes in politics and the economy in the 1990s, Korea realized major societal developments in the early 2000s, contributing to its industrial and cultural globalization, including that of Korean cinema. This series of events created opportunities for a new generation of directors to expand boundaries in filmmaking and explore new types of storytelling and artistic visions suitable for the nationâs new cultural freedom and values. A leading director of this new generation is Park Chan-wook (b. 1963)ââwho put Korean cinema on the mapâ ( The New York Times , 2017). Park majored in philosophy in college where he encountered Alfred Hitchcockâs Vertigo (1958) and decided to become a director. When his fifth feature film, Oldboy (2003), became an international sensation, it introduced a new type of Korean horror film, creating a new cinematic language with an exceptional artistic sensibility that was supported by a production budget and practice marked- ly influenced by Hollywood blockbusters. As a result, new kinds of narratives emerged, breaking away from the general plotlines that reigned supreme in traditional Korean horror films (mostly from the 1960s) that centered on female ghosts taking vengeance, often generated by family drama. This series, bookended by two works of Park Chan-wook ( Oldboy and Thirst ), highlights the first decade of the 21st century to examine the complexities of Korean genre films, and their aesthetics and narratives in the context of a country amidst a changing world at the dawn of a new millennium. Presented in part by a grant from the Korea Foundation, the series also in- troduces viewers to the filmmakers who pioneered the global establishment of Korean horror films whose storylines span from domestic issues to war, serial killing, colonial trauma, and foreign intervention.\n\nFilms in this series contain graphic content; viewer discretion is strongly advised.\n\nProgrammed and notes by Hyesung ii\n\n8\n\nOLDBOY, 2003, image courtesy of NEON\n\nKOREAN HORROR\n\n9\n\nOldboy\n\nSat, Oct 1 | 7:30pm | TMT\n\nDae-su, a middle-aged drunkard and white- collar worker, has neither ambition nor purpose in life. One rainy night, Dae-suâs life takes a horrific turn: he is abducted and imprisoned in a windowless room for 15 years without explanation. After his release, he must find the reason for his captivity and seek redemp- tion. Oldboy , the second film in The Vengeance Trilogy of director Park Chan-wook, captivated international audiences upon its release. This film explosively explores the brutal extremes of the complex, visceral human instinct through the sophisticated lenses of storytelling, stun- ning visual compositions, and a meticulously curated soundtrack that often contradicts the brutal violence presented in its scenes.\n\nDIRECTOR: Park Chan-wook.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Park Chan-wook.\n\nCAST: Choi Min-sik, Yoo Ji-tae, Kang Hye-jeong. 2003. 120 min. South Korea. Color. Scope. Korean. Rated R. DCP.\n\nNew remastered 4k DCP, courtesy of NEON.\n\nR-Point\n\nSat, Oct 8 | 3pm | TMT\n\nKong Su-chang's directorial debut feature, R-Point , is a wartime horror film set in the early 1970s during the Vietnam War. A unit of Korean soldiers is dispatched to investigate the disappearance of an entire military squad in the desolate region known as R-Point. Terrifying events unfold as the horrific history of R-Point haunts the dispatch unit. Kongâs honest and insightful depiction of Korean soldiers in the Vietnam War is rather compli- catedâthey are perpetrators of violent war crimes, but also victims of the war driven by imperialism. Horror triggered by global trauma is an unsettling theme explored in R-Point .\n\nDIRECTOR: Kong Su-chang.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Kong Su-chang, Pil Yeong-woo.\n\nCAST: Kam Woo-seong, Lee Sun-kyun, Son Byung-ho.\n\n2004. 107 min.

The film begins with a US military doctor (the late Scott Wilson) ordering his assistant to illegally dump toxic chemicals down a drain that leads to the Han River. Sev- eral years later, a mutated monster emerges from the river to wreak havoc on Seoul. When the monster abducts his daughter, Gang-du and his squabbling family band together to rescue her. Equal parts creature feature, dysfunctional family comedy, and political satire, The Host is a monumental work.\n\nDIRECTOR: Bong Joon-ho.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Bong Joon-ho, Ha Won-jun, Baek Chul-hyun. CAST: Song Kang-ho, Byun Hee-bong, Park Hae-il, Bae Doona. 2006. 120 min. South Korea. Color. Korean. Rated R. 35mm.\n\nBedevilled\n\nSat, Oct 22 | 3pm | TMT\n\nLongtime assistant director to Kim Ki-duk, Jang Cheol-soo's debut feature Bedevilled is a horror thriller set in Moo-do, a remote island of nine residents, where Bok-nam (Seo Young-hee from The Chaser ) is treated like a slave by her husband and the rest of the Moo-do residents. Tired of the relentless torture and abuse, Bok-nam plans an escape with her daughter, which ends in tragedy, leaving her in absolute despair. Driven by brutal rage, Bok-nam must seek revenge on those who have been âunkindâ to her.\n\nDIRECTOR: Jang Cheol-soo.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Choi Kwang-young.\n\nCAST: Seo Young-hee, Ji Sung-won, Park Jeong-hak, Bae Seong-woo. 2010. 115 min.

Joong-ho, a corrupt ex-cop turned heartless pimp, finds himself in debt when two of his girls mysteriously disappear. Suspicious of the last patron of the missing women, Joong-ho hatches a plan to âbaitâ the customer with another woman, Mi-jin. Amidst its dizzying suspense, terrifying bloody violence, and breathless chase scenes, The Chaser imagines what justice looks like under a socio-political system that is neither prac- tical nor sympathetic to victims of violence, corruption, and modernization.\n\nDIRECTOR: Na Hong-jin.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Na Hong-jin, Hong Won-chan, Lee Shinho.\n\nCAST: Kim Yoon-seok, Ha Jung-woo, Seo Yeong-hee.\n\n2008. 123 min. South Korea. Color. Scope. Korean. 35mm.\n\nEpitaph\n\nEpitaph , directed by brothers Jung Sik and Jung Bum-shik, is a horror film composed of three bizarre stories that unfold at the inter- section of love, death, and obsession. At Ansaeng, a hospital located in Kyung-sung during Japanese colonial rule in 1942, a series of inexplicable incidents occursâan intern becomes obsessed with the corpse of a young woman; a girl, the sole survivor of a horrific accident, is terrorized by ghosts; and two doctors are terrified by serial murders targeting Japanese soldiers. Visually stunning with mesmerizing art direction and arrest- ing shot compositions, Epitaph is a strangely beautiful, atypical entry in the horror genre.\n\nDIRECTOR: Jung Sik, Jung Bum-shik.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Jung Sik, Jung Bum-shik.\n\nCAST: Kim Bo-kyung, Kim Tae-woo, Jin Goo.\n\n2007. 98 min.

Soo-hyun (Lee) is a top secret agent who loses his fiancé to a horrific murder by a psychopathic killer (Choi). Determined to seek vengeance, Soo-hyun begins an obsessive hunt for the killer. Hardcore, violent scenes are masterly balanced with stylish cinema- tography and chilling chemistry between two brilliant actors, Choi and Lee.\n\nDIRECTOR: Kim Jee-woon.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Kim Jee-woon, Park Hoon-jung.\n\nCAST: Choi Min-sik, Lee Byung-hun.\n\n2010. 144 min. South Korea. Color. Korean. 35mm.\n\nThirst\n\nSat, Oct 29 | 7:30pm | TMT\n\nLee Chang-dong, acclaimed director of Burning (2018) and Secret Sunshine (2007), has said of Park Chan-wook's Thirst that it \"could be the most unique vampire film ever made, equipped with overflowing cinematic imagination.\" Park Chan-wook redefines the vampire genre with a quirky sense of humor and keen insight on the dark territories surrounding the human condition. Song Kang-ho plays a moral priest who acciden- tally turns into a vampire after volunteering for a medical experiment and is faced with the dilemmas of his new existence. In Thirst , Song showcases his exceptional mastery over satire, contributing brilliant and ironic tonality throughout the film.\n\nDIRECTOR: Park Chan-wook.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Park Chan-wook, Jeong Seo-kyeong.\n\nCAST: Song Kang-ho, Kim Ok-bin, Kim Hae-sook, Shin Ha-kyun. 2009. 133 min.

Bells are tolling. Candles are lit.\n\nâMaleficarumâ is the Latin word for witchcraft, which tragically became entangled with religious prosecution and abuse. This series reclaims the word back from the fanatics to use its might to resurrect and protect the psychotronic spirit that blossomed within Mexican horror cinema during its evolution in the latter part of the 20th century. These films have historically been considered outcasts. While audiences enjoyed these delirious tales and box offices gorged on the receipts, the majority of film historians and critics openly denounced the recycled plot lines, genre mashups, and financial straightjackets under which they had to operate. Meanwhile, a peculiar flavor of cinema developed, one wearing a luchador mask, suspending vampire bats with clearly visible nylon thread, and lavishly displaying outlandish facial makeup that ventured beyond the absurd. In this cinematic ecosystem, bizarre filmic flora bloomed into a mystical space within the Mexican cinematic consciousness which revels in unhinged entertainment value, imagination that defies limitations, operatic emotions, a recurrent fear of the feminine, and a constant acknowledgement of the occult. Through the decades, many of these films have enjoyed cruel cycles of euphoric popularity on television, followed by long, quiet hibernation. The time has come to liberate monsters, lusty vampires, witches, deranged scientists, doll people, ghosts, and an Aztec living head from their extended slumber. Hear these sisters and brothers of the night awake. Their existence honors the sheer bravado and passion of the actors and filmmakers who created them. We salute all the institutions, media companies, festivals, historians, and devoted fans, from Mexico and abroad, who have protected the legacy of these films against oblivion. Still today some jewels remain inaccessible, while others are scattered into a limbo of unsupervised transfers and neglect. Join us in a ritual ceremony of resurrection, from the unlit corners of vaults and archives to the mythical canvas of the museumâs screen, where these films will once again face the light beam of the projector and deliver their Mexquisite dark gospel into your souls.\n\nFilms in this series contain graphic content; viewer discretion is strongly advised.\n\nProgrammed and notes by Abraham Castillo Flores, Guest Programmer Series generously supported by Televisa Foundation-Univision.\n\n22\n\nEl vampiro with Cronos\n\nThu, Oct 6 | 7:30pm | TMT\n\nEl vampiro (The Vampire)\n\nA young woman returns to her hometown only to find that it is threatened by vampires led by the ominous Count Karol de Lavud, who is keen to take over her familyâs property and steal her soul. This lauded tale of blood- lust stands as the cinematic bridge between the Hammer Film Productions and Universal Pictures cinematic interpretations, cementing the horror credentials of actor-producer Abel Salazar, debuting Spanish film actor Germán Robles, and helmer Fernando Méndez.\n\nDIRECTOR: Fernando Méndez.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Ramón Obón.\n\nCAST: Germán Robles, Abel Salazar, Ariadne Welter, Carmen Montejo.\n\n1957. 83 min. Mexico. B&W. Spanish. DCP.\n\nCourtesy of Alameda Films.\n\nCronos\n\nAn antiques dealer discovers an ancient device that opens the doors to immortality and awakens the user to an uncontrollable bloodlust. Going against the conventions and expectations of a film industry that belittled the wonders of national fantasy and horror, Guillermo del Toro proved everyone wrong with his feature film debut which announced to the world the arrival of a new talented horror director who would eventually flourish into a genre patron saint.\n\nDIRECTOR: Guillermo del Toro.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Guillermo del Toro.\n\nCAST: Federico Luppi, Claudio Brook, Ron Perlman, Tamara Xanath. 1993. 94 min.

She communicates with ancient and omnipotent spirits through prayer and a magic mirror. Sara craves to avenge the death of her god- daughter and former wife of her employer. A delirious mélange of Rebecca , The Hands of Orlac , and Eyes Without a Face fused by the dark arts and gothic, romantic toxicity, this film is an unmissable yarn of physical and astral retribution.\n\nDIRECTOR: Chano Urueta.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Alfredo Ruanova, Carlos Enrique Taboada.

Courtesy of Televisa Foundation - Univision Foundation.\n\nThis mercurial and lysergic adventure, which takes place in two different timelines and a crimson-colored netherworld, confirms that being a righteous enforcer for the Spanish Inquisition is dreadful. In his 25th film, Santo faces the spirit of a female devil worshiper who tried to kill his bloodline back in 1670. Now, in 1970, she possesses his fiancée. Watch out for Luciferian worship, witch burnings, heroic luchador Blue Demon under Satanic control, and stock footage of open-heart surgery.\n\n28\n\nLa maldición de la Llorona with Veneno para las hadas\n\nSat, Oct 8 | 7:30pm | TMT\n\nLa maldición de la Llorona (The Curse of the Crying Woman)\n\nThe legend of La Llorona, Mexico's founding fright mother, goes full gothic. Selma, a fiendish witch, manipulates young Amelia into performing a dark ritual to reawaken the withered corpse of Doña Marina, her foremother, better known as La Llorona. An eerie tale of cursed bloodlines and the tempting powers of evil that showcases to full effect the talents of actresses Rita Macedo and Rosita Arenas who, coincidentally, were both pregnant at the time of the shoot.\n\nDIRECTOR: Rafael Baledón.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Fernando Galiana, Rafael Baledón.

So begins an extravagant, genre-bending tale where sci-fi, western, musical, and horror tropes mutate into a zany experience that only Mexican cinema could concoct. As a robot servant repairs the ship, the cosmonauts deal with the ever-growing attention of a singing cowboy and the violent urges of their extraterrestrial prisoners.\n\nDIRECTOR: Rogelio A.

Meanwhile their neighbor Count Sigfrido von Frankenhausen drains the blood of young maidens with the help of his perverse house- keeper. An intoxicating gothic tale swamped in sadistic glee, where Frankenhausen falls prey to erotic urges whilst scientists encourage grave robbing for experimentation that promises to save humankind from the furriest vampire in Mexican horror film history.\n\nDIRECTOR: Miguel Morayta.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Miguel Morayta.\n\nCAST: Begoña Palacios, Carlos Agostí, Erna Martha Bauman, Bertha Moss.\n\n1962. 95 min.

Dandridge performed with her sister Vivian on the Chitlinâ Circuit throughout the South before age 10, settling into regular schooling when her mother moved the family to Hollywood in 1930. Dee joined the American Negro Theatre as an apprentice in 1941 while studying for her undergradu- ate degree at Hunter College in New York City. Each broke into cinemaâDandridge in 1935, Dee in 1946âin small roles, race films and all-Black cast productions, working steadily and rising to household name status by the late 1950s. Over careers spanning decadesâthree for Dandridge and seven for Deeâeach performer appeared in over three dozen films and was nominated for an Academy Award. Dandridge, given her earlier start, can claim far more âfirsts,â as the first Black woman to grace the cover of Life magazine in 1954 and the first Black woman to be nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award, for Carmen Jones that same year. Dandridge constantly fought to defend her offscreen image, which tabloids mercilessly targeted throughout her career which was cut short in 1965 when she died under mysterious circumstances. Deeâs career achievementsâwhich include an Oscar nomination for Actress in a Supporting Role for American Gangster (2007) when Dee was in her mid-80sâexpand beyond Hollywood. She also made her markâwith her husband, filmmaker, actor, and frequent co-star Ossie Davisâas a Civil Rights activist; the couple were named together to the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame in 1989. By exploring the careers of Dee and Dandridge, we hope to paint a portrait of the opportunities for Black women actors in âclassicâ Hollywood. Born in the second year of the second decade of the 20th century, both women experienced the advantages and frustrations of incremental civil rights advancements for Black Americans in their lives and careers, and charted pioneering paths that have cemented their status as icons.\n\nPresented in conjunction with Regeneration: Black Cinema 1898â1971, on view through April 9, 2023 .\n\nProgrammed and notes by K.J.

Based on the 1955 Philco Television Playhouse teleplay âA Man Is Ten Feet Tall,â the chemistry that emanates from Sidney Poitier and John Cassavetesâs friendship is certainly the filmâs most memorable relationship. But as the wife of Poitierâs dynamic, uninhibited stevedore, Dee also shines as a friend and partner and holds the filmâs emotional center during the tragic third act.\n\nDIRECTOR: Martin Ritt.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Robert Alan Aurthur.\n\nCAST: John Cassavetes, Sidney Poitier, Jack Warden, Ruby Dee.\n\n1957. 85 min.

Handy, the self-dubbed Father of the Blues, Paramount assembled an all-star Black cast, including the singular Nat King Cole as Handy, Ruby Dee as his pious sweetheart, and Eartha Kitt as a worldly nightclub singer. Now in her mid-30s and a veteran screen performer, Dee might not win the audienceâs favor as her character initially dissuades Handy from composing and performing popular music, but her talent for providing a film's moral compass allows her own journey to acceptance of Handy's first love to guide the narrative's dramatic arc.\n\nDIRECTOR: Allen Reisner.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Robert Smith, Ted Sherdeman.\n\nCAST: Nat King Cole, Eartha Kitt, Cab Calloway, Ruby Dee.\n\n1958. 93 min.

Presiding over the school is principal Harry Belafonte, making his own cinematic debut. Adapted from an award-winning story by West Indies-raised writer Mary Elizabeth Vroman (the first Black woman to join the Screen Writers Guild thanks to this film adaptation), Bright Road is a bucolic, bittersweet coming-of-age film filled with song and heart.\n\nDIRECTOR: Gerald Mayer.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Emmet Lavery.\n\nCAST: Dorothy Dandridge, Philip Hepburn, Harry Belafonte, Barbara Ann Sanders.\n\n1953. 69 min.

Cast to portray himself in this filmed version of his life while simultaneously boasting his best year to date with the Brooklyn Dodgers, Robinson exudes a calm, confident resolution onscreen, shared by Deeâs Rae as his endlessly supportive partner. In another stroke of realism, Dee was the exact same age as Rae during filming: both were born in 1922.\n\nDIRECTOR: Alfred E.

Updating the operaâs story to World War II-era North Carolina, Carmen Jones tells how parachute factory vixen Dandridge (singing voice provided by Marilyn Horne) seduces young private Harry Belafonte (singing by LeVern Hutcherson) into an affair with tragic results. Preminger supported his leading duo with an all-African American cast including Pearl Bailey, Brock Peters, and Diahann Carroll, though itâs Dandridgeâs striking figure that appeared on the Saul Bass-designed posters for the film.\n\nDIRECTOR: Otto Preminger.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Harry Kleiner.\n\nCAST: Dorothy Dandridge, Harry Belafonte, Pearl Bailey, Olga James. 1954. 108 min.

Incorporating documentary footage from Kingâs funeral and drawing on screenwriter and star Ruby Deeâs deep famil- iarity both with her hometown of Cleveland and off-screen civil rights causes, this searing indictment of the state of America for its Black residents is deftly directed by formerly black- listed filmmaking legend Jules Dassin.\n\nDIRECTOR: Jules Dassin.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Jules Dassin, Ruby Dee, Julian Mayfield.\n\nCAST: Raymond St. Jacques, Ruby Dee, Roscoe Lee Browne, Julian Mayfield.\n\n1968. 104 min.

While the bond between Poitierâs Buck and Belafonteâs Preacher receives the most screen time, itâs Deeâs grounded performance as Buckâs wife that provides the affecting core of this deft and captivating piece.\n\nDIRECTOR: Sidney Poitier.\n\nWRITTEN BY: Ernest Kinoy.\n\nSTORY BY: Ernest Kinoy, Drake Walker.\n\nCAST: Sidney Poitier, Harry Belafonte, Ruby Dee, Cameron Mitchell. 1972. 102 min.

Directed by The Wild One âs László Benedek and shot on location in England and Spain, Moment of Danger is a noir-tinged road movie that finds Dandridge giving one of her most modulated performances.

In Chinatown, to be exact, where there were five movie theaters, all showing Chinese films from Hong Kong. The characters may have been Chinese rather than Chinese American, but growing up and seeing faces like mine projected, larger than life, helped to nurture a multifaceted self-image. I eventually discovered art houses showing Hollywood classics like The Good Earth (1937) and The Mask of Fu Manchu (1932). Rather than an offense to my identity, these cinematic (mis)representations of the Chinese struck me as a curiosity for further study, and would lead to the creation of my Hollywood Chinese documentary, book, exhibitions, and now, this film series. Here, Iâve programmed films from cinemaâs first 100 years to both critique and celebrate Hollywoodâs depictions of the Chinese, as well as spotlight groundbreaking Chinese and Chinese American artists who have navigated an industry often ignorant of race. There are studio blockbusters curated alongside forgotten gemsâsome films are extraordinary, others downright abhorrent. Movies immerse audiences in real time, and by experiencing these films in a contemporary setting, I hope we might gain insight to what was then, and what is now. As Bruce Lee suggested, âBe water.â\n\nAdvisory: Some films in this series include racist stereotypes and tropes, including yellowface and offensive slurs.\n\nHollywood Chinese: The First 100 Years continues in the November Oscar® Sundays series (see pg. 110â115).

Scenes ranging from the first feature film made by Chinese Americans in 1917 to breakout Oscar wins are interwoven with interviews of Chinese and Chinese American artists who reveal stories of working in Hollywood. White actors, such as Luise Rainer and Christopher Lee, recall their yellowface performances to explain the now-controversial practice. Hollywood Chinese , produced and directed by series Guest Programmer Arthur Dong, is a fitting roadmap to embark on the upcoming film series: â[T]his is a subject at once rich and complex, encompassing social history and racial politics no less than film history. It's a challenge to make sense of material that includes Bruce Lee, Ang Lee, and Christopher Lee (he starred in five Fu Manchu pictures). But Hollywood Chinese ...manages to do it.
