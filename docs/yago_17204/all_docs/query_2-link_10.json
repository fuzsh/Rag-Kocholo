        "text": "In the face of misfortune, a troubled wife and mother turns to Christianity for succor...and then to spiritualism...AND THEN TO SATANISM.\n\nHonestly, this meditation on the protagonist's desperation and the similarities between religious dogma and \"crackpot\" rituals would have been movie enough for me, but in the third act it takes a hard left turn directly into \"The Monkey's Paw.\" I didn't really mind, as the last act was certainly more colorful and fast-paced than what had come before, but it was pretty jarring!\n\nProduced in Mexico, I can highly recommend this hugely atmospheric 60s supernatural chiller by the gifted director, Benito 'Santo contra los Zombies' Alazraki. Spirited into vivid life by a strong cast of fine actors, and superbly photographed, this sporadically preachy, splendidly spooky riff on The Monkey's Paw features a tall, youthful looking, René Cardona Jr. While I'm familiar with his works as a zesty genre director, I never realised just how much of a virile actor he was, René had that quiet Stiglitz alpha power! Prone to melodramatic excess, and a little static at times, the crepuscular, somewhat protracted, spook-slathered seance remains a delight for avid fans of vintage ectoplasmic eeriness, aesthetically composed by ace cameraman, Enrique Wallace.\n\n11/33 Hooptober Movies\n\n2/6 6 films before 1966\n\n1/1 1 film from a Mexican director\n\nThis had a low budget made for tv movie feel but it made the best use of it it could. The acting wasn't too over the top and even the dub was good. The story itself was a little on the boring side mainly since it was announced at the beginning of the film. I didn't feel much for the characters because the main character Mary especially heeded no warnings or common sense and just plowed through making the wrong decision every step of the way until the inevitable bad conclusion.\n\nSome of the effects weren't half bad and there was a couple eerie scenes but for the most part this was forgettable."
