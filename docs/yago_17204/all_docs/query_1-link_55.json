        "text": "‘My cousin Paco’s brain is very docile.’\n\nA vampire plans to conquer America using Frankenstein’s Monster. However, the creature needs a new brain, and the bloodsucker sets his sights on the one belonging to a slow-witted postal worker…\n\nMexican horror spoof from director Benito Alazraki starring comedy actors Manuel ‘Loco’ Valdés and José ‘Ojón’ Jasso. Roberto G. Rivera, Quintín Bulnes and Alberto ‘Chiquilín’ Villanueva play it straight as the three most famous monsters in film land.\n\nAfter getting fired from his last job, Agapito (Valdés) finds work with his cousin Paco (José Jasso) at an express delivery service. Two crates have just arrived from Rome for the owner of the local wax museum, Señor La Valle (Antonio Bravo). These supposedly contain wax figures but are actually the real thing: the bodies of Frankenstein’s Monster (Villanueva) and The Vampire (Bulnes). Also newly arrived in town is Doctor Chon Chon (Rivera), who has been tracking the monsters and plans to destroy them with the aid of brilliant research scientist Dr Sofia (Nora Veryán).\n\nValdés and Jasso deliver the crates to Bravo’s museum, only for the contents to be hijacked by Veryán and her hired men. Unfortunately, Rivera is indisposed at the time due to his little problem with lycanthropy, and Bulnes turns Veryán and her assistant into slaves using his hypnotic powers. Planning to take over America, he needs the help of the semi-comatose Villanueva, but the creature is unreliable and hard to control. Deciding that the monster needs a more compliant brain, the Vampire has Veryán invite Valdés to the castle as a prospective donor.\n\nIf the above story summary rings a few bells, that’s no surprise. This is little more than an unlicensed remake of Universal’s ‘Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein’ (1948), which starred Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr, reprising their iconic Dracula and Wolf Man characters in the last gasp of the studio’s classic monster cycle. It also mines much the same vein of humour, with physical gags, misunderstandings, scaredy-cat antics and some dreadful mugging to the camera by the dreadfully overacting Valdés. The script stops short of cribbing actual jokes, but there’s no comic invention to take their place and a weary air of ‘seen it all before’ soon settles in to stay.\n\nTo be fair to the cast, they are trying (insert joke here!), and those playing it straight just about escape with their dignity intact. Martha Elena Cervantes is an appealing heroine as Bravo’s naive secretary, and Rivera is admirably straight-faced as the unwilling werewolf. Bulnes certainly has the physique to play an undead creature that lives only on blood, but the actor has little screen presence and is neither sexy nor threatening. Despite his supernatural powers, when faced with our hapless heroes at the end, he simply runs away, which is kind of funny, I suppose, if incredibly lame.\n\nThe lack of budget isn’t that much of a drawback, although the sets are clearly a little on the small side. It’s more of an issue that director Alazraki makes no effort to create any atmosphere from these shadowy interiors beyond inserting stock footage of lightning bolts to make the characters jump occasionally. Of course, conjuring chills isn’t a priority in this type of project, but it might have helped ground the story and sell the humour. The monster makeups also suffer from a noticeable lack of resources. Seldom has Dr Frankenstein birthed a more underwhelming creature, and although it could be argued that Jack Pierce’s iconic makeup was under a jealously guarded copyright at this point, the producers of the film certainly didn’t seem to be over-worried about upsetting Universal Studios. Bulnes’ Vampire gets the usual cape, dinner jacket and silly teeth combo, but it’s Rivera’s lycanthrope that really gets the short end of the stick: a rubber mask with tufts of fur stuck to it, some fangs and a bad wig. It’s hideously cheap.\n\nSpecial mention must also go to actor Joaquín García Vargas, playing private detective Hercules Borolas, who Rivera initially hires to search for the stolen crates. It’s almost as if he looked at how Valdés and Jasso were overacting and decided it was a contest to see who could go the furthest over the top. In fact, you have to wonder whether the three of them needed medical assistance with their facial muscles after the shoot was over.\n\nPerhaps the only point worth discussing here is the Mexican horror film industry’s curious aversion to using the name ‘Dracula’. After all, ‘Frankenstein’ was regularly bandied about without due care and attention, but the name of Bram Stoker’s undead Count was apparently off-limits. From ‘El Vampiro’ (1957) onwards, any bloodsucking nobleman who appeared got another aristocratic title despite clearly being based on the familiar Lugosi template. Could it be that producers were still mindful of the legal reach of the Stoker Estate 40 years after his widow brought a successful action against F W Murnau’s silent classic ‘Nosferatu/Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens’ (1922)? Given that this film is such a flagrant copy of a well-known product from a major studio powerhouse like Universal, it’s a little hard to credit such a concern, but it seems likely that some kind of legal reason was involved.\n\nRivera began his film career shortly after the end of World War Two, mainly appearing in uncredited roles for almost ten years. Occasional billing included a small role as a henchman in Rene Cardona’s first attempt to bring legendary wrestler Santo to the big screen in ‘El Enmascarado de Plata/The Silver-Masked Man’ (1954), which, famously, did not feature the great man himself. More important supporting assignments followed, including roles in ‘El secreto de Pancho Villa’ (1957), one of the trio of films featuring masked crimefighter La Sombra Vengadora, and ‘Invisible Man in Mexico/El hombre que logró ser invisible’ (1958). He first worked with Alazraki and Valdés in comedy-western ‘Las hermanas Karambazo’ (1960). The director promoted him to a far more significant role in ‘Pistolas invencibles’ (1960), after which the two were frequent collaborators. He also worked regularly for Cardona, appearing as Dr Kur in ‘Santo and Dracula’s Treasure/Santo en El tesoro de Drácula’ (1969). He worked as an occasional scriptwriter throughout his career and switched to directing in 1973. By the time he passed in 2016, he was long retired but had amassed more than 80 credits during over 40 years in the industry.\n\nIf you’re burning to see a Mexican rip-off of ‘Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein’ (1948), then I guess this one’s for you.\n\n‘I shall create into life the most perfect human being that the world has yet known.’\n\nTwo years after leaving for college, scientist Frankenstein is ready to embark on his daring experiment to create life. Although he is successful, his creation has the appearance of a monster. The academic flees, returning to his home town where he plans to marry his fiancée Elizabeth. However, the creature is not far behind…\n\nThe first cinematic adaptation of Mary Shelley’s famous novel, this 12-minute silent picture was produced by the Thomas Edison Company in New York. Director J Searle Dawley also wrote the screenplay, which is presented on a small number of sets with a minimal cast, but still manages to make its’ mark over a century later.\n\nAcademic Frankenstein (Augustus Phillips) departs from home to travel to college, leaving his intended bride Elizabeth (Mary Fuller). Two years pass before the night when he is finally ready to conduct his ambitious experiment: the creation of life. The intention is to create beauty and perfection, but the results are far from it. Phillips is repelled by the monster (Charles Ogle) when it enters his bedchamber and escapes the city to return home. He tries to bury his memories and marry Fuller, but Ogle’s creature is not so easily dismissed.\n\nObviously, the film’s place in the history of horror, and cinema itself, is impossible to deny. It’s the first baby steps of a genuine cultural phenomenon that has encompassed hundreds of movies, television shows, stage adaptations, comic books, further literary adaptations and appearances in every conceivable corner and medium of the entertainment world. The themes and incidents of the story have also been the inspiration and basis of more rip-offs, homages and knowing references than perhaps any other character in literary history. The mad or misguided scientist was born with Frankenstein.\n\nThat’s a heavy legacy for any first film to shoulder, especially one of a vintage of more than 100 years. The surprise is that it holds up so well within that limitation. Credit here must go to writer-director Dawley, particularly for his screenplay. Boiling down a novel of almost 75,000 words into just 12 minutes of screentime is no laughing matter, but he sensibly distils the action into three swift acts: the setup, the creation and rejection of the creature and the wrap-up at Frankenstein’s home. It’s an elementary summary of the tale, but it’s not as if Dawley had much wiggle room, given the short runtime. More significantly, he does come up with a couple of nice, creative touches which are pretty original.\n\nThe most immediately striking element of Dawley’s film is the creation sequence. Rather than having the creature assembled from various spare parts looted from local boneyards, this monster is grown inside a cauldron. During the process, the creature rapidly takes on muscle, bulk and form, added during frequent cutaways to the watching Phillips. This is very different from the usual approach where the scientist endows the life force into an inanimate body via various fizzing electrical devices or a convenient lightning storm. The approach may have been due to the limitations of what Dawley had to work with, but it’s undeniably a little gruesome and quite effective if you make allowances. It also serves as a vague precursor to the kind of body horror that is a staple of the genre today.\n\nThe other interesting spin on the material is foreshadowed by one of the intertitles before the creation sequence, which states: ‘Instead of a perfect being, the evil in Frankenstein’s mind creates a monster.’ This statement suggests a much closer link between man and monster than the mere application of electric current. Publicity material issued at the time presented a very literal reading of the following events. These culminate when Ogle literally vanishes into thin air because ‘The creation of an evil mind is overcome by love and disappears’. To modern eyes, this suggests that the monster represents his creator’s twisted psyche, that it’s birthed and sustained by his unhealthy obsession with forbidden knowledge. After all, one of the film’s final shots has the creature only visible in a mirror as his creator’s reflection. There is nothing shown of any scientific method because Frankenstein is literally ‘playing god’, creating a man in his own image, which proves to be far from divine. He is trespassing on the Lord’s domain, but, unlike the ‘hero’ of Shelley’s novel, he faces no real consequences for his hubris.\n\nOf course, Dawley’s film has all the limitations of cinema produced in its era. The acting is over-demonstrative for the most part, and the camera remains fixed in one place in a single shot for each scene. However, Ogle does attempt to infuse his creature with some pathos, and his clutching hands do recall the pathetic gestures employed by Boris Karloff in his iconic portrayal. Also, it’s tempting to believe that ‘mirror shot’ may have inspired German writer-director Paul Wegener’s landmark horror entry ‘The Student of Prague/Der Student von Prag’ (1913), produced just a couple of years later. After all, the creature’s status as the scientist’s doppelganger or Mr Hyde to his Dr Jekyll is heavily implied.\n\nThe film was thought lost for many decades, but a print was preserved by a Wisconsin film collector. Although acquired in the 1950s, it was only 20 years later when he realised its extreme rarity and the film was restored and preserved for all time. Generally, the output of the Edison Studios is not highly regarded, but Dawley was a prolific director, making more than 200 short films for the company before this Shelley adaptation. He did try to convince Edison to produce more extended subjects, but the famous inventor dismissed the suggestion, believing that audiences would not have the inclination to watch or the attention span required. Frustrated with that lack of vision, Dawley spent time with Adolf Zukor’s Famous Players Film Company, where he directed further literary adaptations such as ‘Tess of the d’Urbervilles (1913) and ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ (1918). One of the founding members of the Motion Picture Directors Association, he directed his last feature in 1923 before becoming involved with the emerging technology used in sound films. In later life, he worked on the Arizona Republican newspaper, writing a regular column called ‘Sweet Arts of Sweethearts’, which covered the ‘courtship, betrothal and wedding customs’ of various cultures around the world.\n\nEssential viewing for those interested in the history of film horror.\n\n‘I have managed to replace it with a very sophisticated watchmaking machinery which makes the vital organs operate continuously and without interruption.’\n\nProfessor Frankenstein is sent to prison after being caught lifting corpses from the local cemetery but breaks jail with the help of an ex-cell mate. He resumes his experiments and fits his creature with an electronic brain that will accept mental commands. Unfortunately, his new criminal associate has his own ideas about how to use the Professor’s work…\n\nThe Mexican film industry had received a massive shot in the arm from the runaway success of Abel Salazar’s ‘El Vampiro’ (1957), which kickstarted a domestic craze for screen horrors. But whereas that movie had been a very traditional take on ‘Dracula’ patterned closely on the 1931 film with Bela Lugosi, here director Rafael Baledón chooses to ignore Mary Shelley’s novel and put his own spin on the Frankenstein mythos, albeit heavily inspired by various themes and story threads from the classic Universal monster series.\n\nThings go distinctly pear-shaped for dedicated scientist Professor Frankenstein (Andres Soler) when he gets his collar felt by the agents of Johnny Law. Shame he was indulging in some quiet grave robbing at the time. Life in jail means sharing a cell with killer Jaime Rojas (Joaquín Cordero). We never really find out what the old boy had been banged up for, but apparently, he’s in for a long stretch. Not so with Cordero. Despite the belief of Inspector Santos (Armando Calvo) that he’s guilty of multiple murders, the miscreant has only pulled a term for assault and is due for an early release. Once out, Cordero links up with old partner Gastón (David Reynoso) to pull a quick jewellery heist before Reynoso returns the favour by helping him break Soler out of jail.\n\nBack at the old homestead, Soler’s secret lab is not only intact, but his last experiment is still lying frozen on the slab. Disfigured assistant, Eric (Carlos Ancira) is still on the payroll, but Soler decides to expand his workforce by taking on Cordero. Bad decision. Soler’s creature is soon up and about, even if he bears an unfortunate resemblance to a medium-sized actor with a crate over his head. Presumably, this is to house his electronic brain which can receive orders via a radio transmitter. Unfortunately, a supply of fresh blood is required to make him tick (literally!), and Cordero is prepared to meet the demand with the aid of Ancira. Soler thinks it’s coming from a condemned man, but instead, our gruesome twosome are killing young women. For some reason, they are taking the blood from the necks of their victims and, inevitably, the press label the rampage as ‘Vampire Murders.’\n\nIf all that wasn’t enough to be going along with, Soler decides to give his creature a name, Orlak, and a human face. The face of Cordero. Why he picks that face, in particular, makes absolutely no sense and his motivation for doing it is never explained. Perhaps he was just trying to accommodate Baledón and his co-scriptwriters Alfredo Ruanova and Carlos Enrique Taboada. It doesn’t even make sense from Cordero’s point of view. It’s plain that he’s going to use Orlak to wreak bloody revenge on those who put him behind bars, but is a lumbering creature who looks exactly like him really his best option? Of course, Cordero always makes sure he has an iron-clad alibi for every murder but why draw attention to himself in the first place? Calvo and his officers are already looking for any excuse to grab him again.\n\nTo be fair, though, Cordero is a borderline psychotic and chronic narcissist who enjoys baiting Calvo, especially when one of his unshakeable alibis turns out to be pretty dark-haired Elvira (Irma Dorantes). She just happens to be the daughter of Judge Dávalos (Antonio Raxel) who is further down his kill list. Later on, Soler gives Orlak a human brain so he can control him via telepathy, enhanced by wearing a pair of specs with a built-in antenna. Other victims include Cordero’s ex-girlfriend Estella (Rosa de Castilla) and her new beau Victor (Julian de Meriche), and Reynoso ends up on the short end too.\n\nIf this all sounds like a lot of fun, then it is, although it does lack the style or flair to rise to the next level. Cordero is excellent as the scheming sociopath, but his performance as Orlak never really engages audience sympathy. Yes, the monster gets a good payoff but, by then, we’re too used to seeing him as a robotic killing machine. A few quieter moments with him would have gone a long way. On the bright side, the pace is swift; the cast plays it straight, there’s plenty of action and the scenes between the arrogant Cordero and his official nemesis crackle with mutual loathing. And it always good to spend time with a scientist who doesn’t keep his lab up to code and doesn’t care if visitors stumble into machinery and get instantly electrocuted.\n\nBaledón was very active in Mexican fantastical cinema and laid some of the foundations for the monster-wrester mash-ups of later years. He was the man behind the megaphone when ex-grappler Fernando Osés starred in a series of three films as masked avenger La sombra vengadora, beginning in 1956. A quick trip to the ‘Swamp of the Lost Souls’ (1957) followed, and he also took on ‘El hombre y el monstruo/The Man and the Monster’ (1959). After his go-round with Frankenstein, he delivered a spooky version of the La Llorona legend, ‘The Curse of the Crying Woman’ (1964) and visited the ‘Museo del horror/The Museum of Horror’ (1964). These are only a handful of his total credits as he worked in many other genres; making comedies, westerns, dramas and mysteries. He was almost as active on the other side of the camera, amassing nearly 100 acting credits in total, often in leading roles.\n\nCordero racked up over 200 roles in a screen career that lasted an impressive 67 years and he will be forever remembered for playing the villain in El Santo’s debut film ‘Santo vs. The Evil Brain’ (1961) and for appearing in its immediate sequel. He also starred in back to back science-fiction films ‘El monstruo de los volcanes’ (1963) and ‘The Terrible Giant of the Snows’ (1963) for director Jaime Salvador before grabbing a ticket for ‘Museo del horror/The Museum of Horror’ (1964) for Baledón. He also showed strongly in the title role of ‘Dr. Satán’ (1966) and its bizarre sequel ‘Dr. Satán vs Black Magic’ (1968). Reynoso should also be familiar to cult cinema enthusiasts, mainly due to his role as the Blue Demon’s policeman sidekick in a couple of the wrestler’s late 1960s outings, as well as for appearances in ‘La invasión de los vampiros’ (1963) and ‘Adventure at the Centre of the Earth’ (1965). Of course, he was in ‘Museo del horror/The Museum of Horror’ (1964) too, because who wasn’t?\n\nThere’s nothing startlingly original about this variation on the Frankenstein story. Still, it is a quick and fun monster rally with a few ridiculous elements that only make it more enjoyable.\n\n‘In fact, we found the victim of an equally brutal murder in the park this morning. Ah, this is excellent tea!’\n\nDr Frankenstein creates a monster from cadavers but rejects his creation. It goes on the rampage but eventually befriends the scientist’s daughter and her blind grandfather. Unfortunately, Frankenstein is obsessed with destroying the creature and the local population are only too happy to join in…\n\nBefore Marvel became the global cinematic juggernaut it is today, their early steps into TV and film were pretty random, and betrayed a total lack of strategy or planning. Witness this early 1980s Japanese Anime feature based on their comic book series ‘The Monster of Frankenstein.’ This is a strange beast indeed; a very serious adaptation that embraces adult themes, dramatic tragedy and a fair amount of of gore. It’s certainly not for young children, and took three years before being released in the US in a dubbed version.\n\nOf course, Mary Shelley’s original novel has been brought to the screen in countless incarnations, most of them bearing only a passing resemblance to the source material. To some extent that’s the case here, but the results are at least true to the spirit of the novel, with Frankenstein the scientist the definite villain of the piece and the monster a misunderstood and tragic figure. The film’s cleverest move is to give Frankenstein a young daughter and turn the blind hermit familiar from ‘The Bride of Frankenstein’ (1935) into the scientist’s father and former mentor. This allows for an emotional core to proceedings, which centre on the creature’s arrival in the scientist’s hometown and a chain of unfortunate events and misunderstandings that inevitably lead to a bleak, and surprisingly hard-hitting, finish.\n\nCertainly, the film’s greatest strength is the storytelling. I’m not familiar with the original comic book series so I have no idea how closely it’s been adapted here, but it’s skilfully and economically done with some fresh and interesting choices. Also, without the limitations of an actor in a costume, the production delivers a truly giant and impressive creature.\n\nInformation on the technical crew behind this enterprise seems somewhat limited but Toyoo Ashida was in charge of animation. He was a veteran of Japanese TV and has credits stretching right back to the early 1970s. Of course the technique on display doesn’t rival the achievements of more modern artists working for Studio Ghibli for example, but it still delivers with a style appropriate to its comic book roots, and the young heroine will seem familiar to those who follow more recent achievements in the genre.\n\nAn interesting variation on the Frankenstein legend, including some smart narrative choices. If you’re a fan of the story, or Japanese Anime in general, you should really check this out.\n\n‘Sometimes you frighten me, Victor, with your strange ideas about things…’\n\nA young medical student leaves Geneva for university in Ingoldstadt. Unfortunately, he actually attends some lectures, and is inspired to meddle in things that man must leave alone. The results of his experiments is a creature sown together from corpses stolen from the local graveyard. One stormy night he brings it to life…\n\nHighly faithful adaptation of Mary Shelley’s immortal 1818 novel, which seems to have debuted on television, rather than on the big screen. Whether it was made for that medium in the first place is open to debate, but it’s more likely that it was a project that failed to find cinema distribution. Why? Well, it’s probably the most bloodless and scare-free version of the story ever presented. Given the obvious reverence for the source material, that might well have been intentional, but it was never likely to set the box office alight as a result. In fact, the film attempts to crowbar the entire novel into its 90 minutes, with the inevitable result that the plot seems rushed and characters are unsympathetic because they have no time to develop. It may have been cut down from a much longer version, of course, but that seems unlikely as there are no gaps in narrative logic or obvious continuity problems.\n\nThis was an Irish-Swedish co-production, directed, written and produced by Calvin Floyd. He was a filmmaker who has only 4 dramatic pictures to his name, of which this was the third. There’s a heavy Swedish presence in the cast, although this includes only one of the principals, Per Oscarsson who plays the rather unintimidating creature. Elsewhere, our title character is Leon Vitali, a man with few subsequent acting credits, due to his role as Stanley Kubrick’s Personal Assistant, and casting director on ‘Full Metal Jacket’ (1982) and ‘Eyes Wide Shut’ (1996). The most familiar faces in the cast are Nicholas Clay, who played Lancelot in John Boorman’s rather silly ‘Excalibur’ (1981), and Stacy Dorning, who is remembered for her appearances in a couple of UK TV shows based on Anna Sewell’s novel ‘Black Beauty.’\n\nThe real problem with the picture is the lack of drama. Keynote scenes such as the creation of the creature are resolutely unspectacular, and the murder of Frankenstein’s young brother in the woods almost plays as an afterthought, rather than an important plot development. The creature makeup is also terribly underwhelming, so much so in fact that it stretches credibility when women faint at the sight of him and men take up burning torches to drive him away. In fact, the horror is downplayed throughout and, although that’s admirable in a way, it does rob the story of its edge and blunt the nature of the tragedy.\n\nTo its credit, there is mention of Victor’s early experiments in the vein of the alchemists, and it’s a welcome change to see him portrayed as such a young man. Sure, Vitali pouts at times like a petulant child, but it’s a far more authentic take on the character in that respect than the many other screen versions, where he is inevitably portrayed as middle-aged or older.\n\nThe film turned up recently as ‘Director’s Commentary: Terror of Frankenstein’ (2015), a spoof version, where a new and entirely fictional story unfolds in a rushed commentary supposedly recorded by the original filmmakers that plays over the old footage. Veteran Clu Gualger (the Sheriff on ‘The Virginian’ in the 1960s) was the voice of the director, Zack Norman (‘Romancing the Stone’ (1981)) the screenwriter and, rather brilliantly, Leon Vitali returned to play ‘himself.’ All very post-modern, and, it has to be said, a far more interesting idea than anything that ended up in the original film.\n\nDespite its highly laudable attempts at fidelity to the novel, it’s really not surprising that this version of Mary Shelley’s classic has slipped through the cracks over the years. Not the worst adaptation you will ever see, but far from the best.\n\n‘Their passion… is what makes them strong, stronger perhaps than their nuclear weapons.’\n\nAliens from the planet Ummo plan to take over the earth by releasing ancient monsters to scare mankind into submission. But some of their party are finding it hard to keep their minds on the job and the monsters prove harder to control than anticipated…\n\nMichael Rennie came to our planet once before as an alien in the classic ‘The Day the Earth Stood Still’ (1951) but this time around his intentions are far from peaceful. The planet Ummo is dying and his people need a new home. The answer: destroy the human race and take the Earth. The plan: well, errm… to revive Dracula, the Wolf Man, Frankenstein’s Monster and the Mummy! This will scare the population into submission… or something. It’s a pretty sophisticated strategy from beings that have travelled 8 light years to get here, even if I do seem to remember hearing about rather a similar scheme once before… ‘Plan 9’, wasn’t it?\n\nThis monster mash is mostly a homage/rip off of ‘House of Frankenstein’ (1944), even down to the discovery of ‘Dracula’ as a skeleton in a fairground act. Rennie is assisted by various Euro beauties including Karin Dor, just two years after she met James Bond and even less time since she starred in Hitchcock’s ‘Topaz’ (1969)! Also, to be pedantic (and despite one of the film’s titles), this isn’t Dracula, after all (it’s Count de Meirhoff) or Frankenstein, it’s Farancksollen (or something equally unpronounceable beginning with an ‘F’). Whether the film makers ran into some kind of legal trouble when this Spanish horror was released in the States is unrecorded but the ‘Assignment Terror’ title card is completely mismatched with the rest of the credits so it would seem likely.\n\nSadly, the film is a complete hodgepodge of odd scenes that just don’t hang together as a coherent story at all. Some of the aliens go to Egypt for a couple of minutes to get the Mummy. The local police inspector starts an affair with the magistrate’s daughter. The Wolf Man scares a couple leaving a party. Rennie’s troops start fancying each other so he keeps them in line by strapping them to a chair and playing loud noises at them. Frankenstein’s monster (sorry, Farancksollen’s monster) fights with the Wolf Man but never even meets Dracula (sorry, Count de Meirhoff), who does almost nothing at all anyway.\n\nThis was Rennie’s last movie, and he looks very ill, so the obvious assumption is that he died during production, leaving the filmmakers to salvage what they could from the footage they’d managed to shoot. Not so. Rennie was still alive more than a year after the film’s original release, although he may have been too ill to do as much filming as was needed. Whatever the reason, there are lots of repeated close ups of his eyes.\n\nPerhaps of most interest is that all the monsters were played (where possible) by Euro horror star Paul Naschy, who also originated the story and co-produced (under his real name of Jacinto Molina). Naschy was best known for playing werewolf Waldemar Daninsky in a loose series of pictures that weren’t directly related beyond some of the same story elements. No extended universe for him! This was the 3rd of Daninsky’s 12 film appearances. Naschy was still at it with the yak’s hair over 30 years later in ‘Tomb of the Werewolf’ (2004) for U.S. director Fred Olen Ray. He was over 70 years old at the time.\n\nThe follow up to this feature was ‘The Werewolf Vs. The Vampire Woman’ (1971) and it’s nowhere near this bad. It’s probable that the production simply ran out of money in the middle of filming… it would explain a lot."
