Por ello, cada década se hace un refrito de la denominación “Nuevo Cine Mexicano.” El esfuerzos de los realizadores y técnicos que trabajan en esta arte-oficio-mercancía es milagroso. Milagroso y trágico. Las películas son reflejo de las posibilidades expresivas de sus directores, y también de las tantas limitaciones del sistema para contribuir cultural y artísticamente al medio y al país. Durante los últimos años, los directores mexicanos que más filman son quienes se imponen como productores, es decir, los capitalistas más hábiles. Aquellos que ganan espacios políticos en un esquema en el que los presupuestos privados y gubernamentales se otorgan de forma caprichosa, sin tomar en cuenta a los cineastas que tienen una voz más personal e interesante. Las películas que se realizan son tan importantes como las que se han dejado de hacer, las cuales, tienen un espacio pendiente en nuestras pantallas. Abundan las películas que tratan, podría decirse que obcecadamente, de deshacerse de una mirada política o crítica de la realidad mexicana, y con eso dejan clara esa posición política, simplista, frívola y neoliberal, que no deja nada, más que algunos pesos, bastante pocos por cierto, en manos de exhibidores que justifican un espacio cada vez más escaso para el cine mexicano en las pantallas del país. El cine no escapa de ser parte de la red del dominio mediático que ejerce el imperio capitalista sobre las mentes de los que habitamos en este mundo. Sólo en raras y valiosas oportunidades los autores del cine mexicano, logramos rebelarnos contra este y mostrar nuestra idiosincrasia y un propósito humano. Desafortunadamente, con un sistema que premia la banalidad por encima de todo, siempre quedan fuera los que más tienen que decir. Únicamente en Page viii → casos excepcionales, colados, podemos observar la mirada bella de nuestra perspectiva original y compartir el placer de la empatía y de la reflexión en las pantallas del mundo que vivimos. La reflexión de Frederick Luis Aldama, en este libro, penetra en el universo de la proyección del mexicano cinematográfico con una mirada aguda. Mas allá de la crítica y las valoraciones objetivas y subjetivas de las películas realizadas al inicio del milenio, Aldama nos pone a la vista caminos por explorar para la realización de un cine nacional más identificado con su pueblo y congruente con su historia. In spite of everything, especially the neoliberal capitalist catastrophe, Mexican cinema lives on. Thanks to this survival, in each decade we witness a rehash of a so-called new Mexican cinema. The efforts of the moviemakers and technicians that work in this art-profession-commodity are miraculous. Miraculous and tragic. Films reflect the expressive possibilities of filmmakers, but they also reflect the many obstacles that the system places on the cultural and artistic contribution that can be made to the medium and the country. In the last few years, the Mexican directors that make more films are also the ones that become producers, that is, the most skilled capitalists, those that gain political spaces within a system in which budgets from private and official sources are furnished in a whimsical way, without taking into account those filmmakers that have a more personal and interesting voice. The films that are made are as important as those that are not made and that have left a blank space on our screens. There are a large number of films that try, one can say obstinately, to omit a political or critical vision of Mexican reality, and in their place they exhibit a political, simplistic, frivolous, and neoliberal position that generates nothing but some pesos, quite a few by the way, for the exhibitors who provide an ever shrinking space for Mexican cinema on screens all over the country.\n\nCinema does not escape being part and parcel of the media network that capitalist power exerts on the minds of all those who inhabit the planet. Only in rare but valuable occasions do we authors of Mexican cinema manage to rebel against this power, showing what is unique in us, as well as the human purpose generally. Unfortunately, in a system that rewards banality above all, those who have the most to say are always left out. As if sneaked in, only in exceptional cases can we experience the beautiful vision of our original perspective and share Page ix → the pleasure of our empathy and reflection on the screens of the world in which we live. Frederick Luis Aldama's sharp eye in this book penetrates into the universe of Mexican cinematography. Beyond the criticism and the objective and subjective evaluations of films made since the beginning of this millennium, Aldama puts in our view those roads that should be explored in order to make a national cinema more identified with its people and more coherent with its history. Carlos Salcés is a filmmaker living in Mexico City. Page x →\n\nPage xi →\n\nPreface and Acknowledgments I wrote this book after years of teaching contemporary Mexican cinema, and by “contemporary” I really mean contemporary: Mexican films made mostly in the first decade of the twenty-first century. This focus required me to grow the course in organic syncopation with films newly scripted, shot, spliced, or released. There is something strongly compelling and kinetic about working with the new, and I hope this book conveys the same urgency. My interest in contemporary Mexican cinema, or Mex-ciné, focuses on three key areas: the industry as an industry, the constructedness of films, and viewers’ reception of the finished works. The first area comprises issues of production, distribution, and exhibition histories, as well as conventions of Mexican film storytelling within global cinematic traditions and prototypical patterns. The second encompasses ingredients or elements such as lens type, camera placement, lighting, scene composition, actor/character look and type, costuming, motion, and editing. All films are made according to recipes, algorithms, or blueprints made up of such ingredients, and I find that the tools and concepts of film theory help me understand how the elements of such blueprints work individually and collectively. Moreover, the concept of the blueprint here aims to capture not only all the ingredients that make up the film—from technical devices and structures used to plots, events, and character dialogue and action—but also to convey the sense that all these elements that make up a film are not the result of a single entity. While a filmmaker may have a greater and lesser degree of willfulness involved in the way the elements cohere, the total product is the result of many skilled people: from producers to cinematographers and editors, from light engineers to costume and sound designers, from set and location designers to casting agents and actors, and many many more. Of course, the ways in which directors—along with the many involved Page xii → in the filmmaking process—orchestrate lighting, editing, sound, camera position, and the like when drawing up these blueprints also work to guide their ideal audiences’ thoughts, emotions, and interpretations. This leads to my third interest, the consideration of the cognitive and emotive faculties involved in making and consuming such blueprints. Useful tools in this regard include advances in the cognitive and social neurosciences that deepen our understanding of human memory, emotion, perception, thought, and language. I am especially interested in the way this knowledge helps us to understand the choices made in creating Mex-ciné blueprints, to assess their effectiveness, and to see how this improved understanding can shed light on other aspects of the filmmaking and consuming experience. I am interested, that is, in the mental faculties directors use to imagine and then (through their choices of actors, sounds, lenses, edits, styles, and genres) make a film that will in turn be processed visually and aurally by the ideal audience in ways that trigger specific thoughts and feelings. Here neuroscience and cognitive science have much to teach us about the workings of our faculties of counterfactual thinking, memory, perception, and emotion. My approach, then, centers on the means that directors use to imagine and then make a film with the goal of triggering specific thoughts and feelings in viewers when they process the film visually and aurally. Findings from cognitive science and neuroscience provide ancillary tools for understanding this process globally, as a unitary whole resulting from the use of our faculties of causal inference, memory, perception, and emotion. With paths carved by the likes of David Bordwell and Noël Carroll, who long ago began cutting against various psychoanalytic flora and fauna of earlier decades, and with new technologies available for research in the brain sciences (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI], which allows research on active brains, such as those of subjects watching film sequences), I move with cautious confidence forward in my analysis of Mexican films. I mention this last point with a certain caution because there is a tendency in current cognitive, neurophysiological, and evolutionary psychological approaches to film analysis to conflate the perceptual, emotive, and cognitive processes of living, breathing directors and audiences with the fictional constructs in the blueprint. As I've written elsewhere, film (like literature, comics, video games, etc.) is not real life, and filmic characters are not the same ontological beast as real events and people.\n\nYes, research showing how human emotions and cognition work can help explain how we make and consume films, but we ought not extrapolate the findings to fictional constructs as if they were real, autonomous beings. Page xiii → Characters in cinema are realized by actors carefully directed to act in ways that may elicit “preordained” feelings and thoughts in audiences. In fictional cinema (but not nonfiction films), any theory of mind (the intersubject attribution of intentions or other mental states based on, say, others’ facial expressions, body language, or movements) results from a carefully calibrated representation. Such attributions are scripted events in fictional cinema, an occurrence that takes place at a precise moment and in a specific way as part of a previously willed series of related events that form the script. Fiction in any of its guises and means of expression is a materialization of a goal (an end or purpose) previously conceived by a human brain. In other words, fiction results from intention; it is a mental construct first and a material result later. But fiction is not only that. It is not a mirror reflection of reality, not a copy or an imitation (or a simulacrum) of anything in the real world. Fiction is only and exclusively an invented reality. Indeed, in a world made of lawlike processes and structures stretching from the inorganic, through the organic, to the social, humans create fictions by using their knowledge of causality and their capacities for imagining different effects or causal results by mentally projecting outcomes. Mario Vargas Llosa and other writers have termed this activity a form of deicide, a replacement of God, for to create fiction is to create something new, an addition to the world, not its replica. Admittedly, the building blocks of fiction, no matter how fantastic and strange, are always taken from the real world, but the result is nonetheless a new world where the criteria of true or false do not apply, for in this new (invented, fictional) world, “anything goes” as long as its creator (its author) wishes it so. As a result of this carefully maintained distinction between reality and fiction, I restrict my use of scientific findings to the real world, the one inhabited by directors, scriptwriters, editors, cinematographers, and audiences, and I try to avoid the categorical (and ontological) mistake of conflating fictional events and characters with reallife events and people. On a popular view of the matter, in any event, a scientific theory is true only if the entities and events it posits exist. In a cinematic work of fiction, all events and entities are constructs; everything is posited as a product of the imagination, an imaginary narrative or story. Far from being an imitation or a reflection of the world, fiction in all its guises brings to the world a radically and qualitatively (and ontologically) new reality. This book aims to make visible the twenty-first-century Mexican film industry, its blueprints, and the cognitive and emotive faculties involved in making and consuming its corpus. It aims to enrich our understanding of the Page xiv → way contemporary Mexican directors use specific technical devices, structures, and characterizations in making films—from script to image to reel images—in ways that guide the perceptual, emotive, and cognitive faculties of their ideal audiences. It aims to enrich our understanding of the historical contexts and industry in which these films are made and consumed. A final point. In the academy, this “making visible” impulse tends to shy away from evaluative criticism. My book does not share that tendency. To analyze the variety of Mexican filmic blueprints is to consider whether they succeed on their own terms. Some do; some do not. I would consider it a job half done if I were to do no more than unpack blueprints; consider issues of production, distribution, and exhibition; and tease out the emotive and cognitive processes involved in the making and consuming. Sleuthing out how a given film is made and how it generates thoughts and feelings in audiences should include evaluative criticism, for at every step in any creative work, the author (or director or composer, and so on) must choose between alternatives, and such choices presuppose valuation and therefore values. To show those acts of valuation and to comment on those values is not only a proper but a necessary part of filmic analysis. Whether we want to admit it or not, for a myriad of reasons, some Mexican films are simply better made than others. Off the cuff, I think of Alfonso Arau's hacked-up and clichéd magical realist structure used in both Como agua para chocolate/Like Water for Chocolate (1992) and Zapata: El sueño del héroe (2003; Zapata: The dream of a hero) and the overreliance on pop-star actors and corny computer-generated (CG) scenery to carry the weak story in Alejandro Gamboa's El Tigre de Santa Julia (2002; The Tiger of Santa Julia). And while some are well done, they might not appeal to one's particular taste. I'm not a big fan of Arturo\n\nRipstein's theatrically staged historical melodramas, no matter how skillfully they are done. I appreciate his craft in choosing lenses, arranging composition, and directing camera movements to convey the loneliness and hollowness of his characters, but the genre just doesn't do it for me. Like any of us, then, I have my personal likes and dislikes. As I intend to demonstrate, however, there is taste and there is taste—that is, knowing why the blueprint fails. I will thus seek to deploy this latter sort of taste, assessing films not according to my merely personal taste—chocolate more than vanilla, say—but according to the way a given director assembles his or her filmic blueprints and goals to produce a coherent composition that achieves a unity of affect. That is to say, I have no problem following an interpretive path in and Page xv → through a given film that leads to understanding why it doesn't work, why we should give it a thumbs down. This is, after all, what we all do one way or another anyway when we watch films. In this sense, then, I hope this book will act not only as a guide to contemporary Mexican films but also as a how-to guide for understanding why some of these products do or do not succeed—and the reasons can be myriad yet still identifiable and verifiable. Unabashedly, this is a book of meditation, interpretation, theory, and critical evaluation of contemporary Mexican films. I have written Mex-Ciné in the form of a book-length essay, a format I have found to be more conducive to offering important critical insight into the industry, the creative process, and the consumption and reception of contemporary Mexican film within a global cinema-making context. Subheadings will indicate different moments in the ebb and flow of the discussion, interpretation, analysis, and critical evaluation of the films. They will, for example, signal moves among discussions and analyses of the deep neurophysiological processes involved in making and consuming films, of the auditory and visual ingredients used in making film blueprints, and of issues of distribution and exhibition, as well as trends and conventions of the industry. In this way, I hope both to provide a guide to contemporary Mexican films and to sketch a theoretical approach for analyzing any and all films, any and all forms of storytelling that involve the visual and aural in motion-photographic form. This book was made possible with support from the Ohio State University's Department of English and its College of Arts and Humanities. I would especially like to thank Associate Dean Dr. Sebastian Knowles for help in securing support for my project. I would also like to thank my acquiring editor at the University of Michigan Press, Tom Dwyer, for seeing the value of this project in an earlier, less integrated incarnation. I am grateful to the director, screenwriter, and former director of Mexico City's FIDECINE (Fondo de Inversión y Estímulos al Cine), Victor Ugalde, for taking the time to discuss the Mexican film industry today and yesterday. I wish to thank all my thoughtful students of Mexican cinema. I send out big abrazos to Robert Reyes and Christopher Gonzalez, PhDs at the University of California, Berkeley, and Ohio State University, who keep me on my toes and my mind dizzy with insights and ideas. And a special thanks to Samuel Saldívar at Michigan State University for bringing my attention to the audio bridge function in Mex-ciné and for plumping up the filmography. Page xvi →\n\nPage 1 →\n\nLights, Camera, Action With a few nods to earlier moments in Mexico's film history, the discussions in the following pages focus entirely on the twenty-first century. In many ways (and journalists have been quick to notice this), the first decade of this century marks a massive rebirthing moment in the making of Mexican films. Some argue that this moment involves not only increased production and distribution but also the emancipation of form and content. With respect to content, such emancipation shows up not just in films that run counter to Catholic ideology, such as Carlos Carrera's El crimen del padre Amaro/The Crime of Padre Amaro (2002), but also in the nascent rise of a queer art-house and mainstream Mex-ciné, as exemplified by Rene Bueno's bubblegum 7 mujeres, 1 homosexual y Carlos (2004; Seven women, one homosexual, and Carlos); Julián Hernández's black-and-white queer odysseys set in Mexico City and rooted in indigenous culture, El cielo dividido/Broken Sky (2006), Rabioso sol, rabioso cielo/Raging Sun, Raging Sky (2008), and A Thousand Clouds of Peace (2002); and Leopoldo Laborde's Buñuelinfluenced Sin destino (2002; Without destiny). There are many reasons for this rebirth, and Mexico is not alone in experiencing such a renaissance. Both Argentina and Brazil have enjoyed a filmmaking boom in the twenty-first century, as have other Latin American countries. A report in the February 23, 2009, issue of Variety reads, “Powered by government funding and coproduction, pic productions and investment tripled over the past decade in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil—to 267 films made with $358.3 million in financing.”1 This boom resulted partly from shifts in the way films have been funded, as well as from pressure on various governments to loosen hitherto tight restrictions on the kinds of films they allowed to be made and exhibited. I will discuss this boom at greater length later on, but for now it suffices Page 2 → to note that by the mid-1990s the state-funded Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografía (IMCINE, established in 1983), which sponsored the production and distribution of Mexican films, had trimmed its funding of filmmaking from an already slim dozen or so films a year to only five. Under the directorship of Ignacio Durán (1988–94), IMCINE had moved increasingly toward privatization, and it continued to demolish its protections for the industry's workers, from directors, cinematographers, and costume and set designers to carpenters and janitors, leading to a violent standoff between workers and higher-ups in 2003, under the Vicente Fox administration. Filmgoers and filmmakers attending the seventh Morelia International Film Festival, in October 2009, were more than agitated when the director of the El Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes (Conaculta) declared that the Calderón administration was supportive of the Mexican film industry, claiming that it had doubled the budget for IMCINE.2 Despite this tension between the state and the film industry in Mexico, directors have managed not merely to maintain, but even to increase film production. During 2000, for instance, only a handful of films were made. A decade later and we see over a hundred films made. (For a better sense of this upswing trend, see the filmography at the end of this book.) Similarly increasing is the number of films in genres and storytelling forms atypical for Mexican cinema, including animations (e.g., Juan Manuel and Figueroa Vega, La prepa/The High School [2006]; Ricardo Arnaiz, The Legend of Nahuala [2007], and Gabriel and Rodolfo Riva Palacio Alatriste's Una película de huevos y un polo/ A Movie About Eggs and a Chicken [2006] and Otra película de huevos y un pollo/Another Movie About Eggs and a Chicken [2009]), science fiction (e.g., Carlos Salcés's Zurdo [2003] and Alex Rivera's Sleep Dealer [2009]), and fantasy or horror (e.g., Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth [2006]; Andres Navia's La llorona/The Wailer [2005], and Rigoberto Castaneda's KM31: Kilometre 31 [2006]). In sum, the twenty-first century's first decade saw the Mex-ciné film industry begin to rise from its own ashes, producing films for audiences both at home and abroad. Of course, this and any other justification for my focus are on another level rather arbitrary. To study Mexican cinema of this particular period is to carve a scholarly slice out of reality. My slice does not include Mexicans who make other kinds of cultural objects for consumption, such as literature, sculpture, comic books, and the like. It does not include Mexican American (Chicano) directors working in the United States. It does not include films by Mexican directors from periods before 1999. It does include films from today's Mexican directors making films by\n\nand about Mexicans. It does include Page 3 → Mexican directors who live part- or full-time in other countries but continue to make films set in Mexico. (e.g., Alfonso Cuarón lives full-time in Italy, Guillermo del Toro lives fulltime in the United States, and González Iñárritu splits his time between Los Angeles and Mexico City). It does include Mexican directors who make films set in other countries. More specifically, I delimit my territory by asking several questions. 1. What is a Mexican film? What, for that matter, are the ingredients that make up an essential Mexicanness, or mexicanidad? Should we buy the definitions offered by Octavio Paz, José Vasconcelos, José Gaos and his disciple Luis Villoro, and Sam Ramos, who variously turn psychological categories into ontological ones, such as an ostensible Mexican fixation on death and an inferiority complex as a bastard (hijo de la chingada) race?3 2. Does Mexican cinema differ from, say, that of the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Cuba, France, Germany, Britain, or India, and if so, how does it differ? 3. What qualifies a film to be Mexican? Are we to include in the Mexican cinematic canon Alfonso Cuarón's adaptation of Great Expectations or Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy because the directors are Mexican? Do we include films that star Mexican actors and are set in Mexico but are directed by Spaniards (Luis Buñuel), Britons (Alex Cox), or North Americans (Cary Joji Fukunaga)? 4. How do Mexican audiences differ from, say, audiences in other Latin American countries, North America, and Europe? Do Mexicans respond differently to Mexican films than do U.S. filmgoers? 5. Do some Mexican films have, built into their blueprints, specific cultural and historical information that draws lines between audiences: Mexican mainstream versus Mexican art-house audiences, for example, or non-Mexican mainstream versus non-Mexican art-house audiences? If so, how do we identify the type of ideal audience for any given film? And is it a zero-sum game, that is, does a film aimed at the mainstream necessarily mean it cannot use an art-house style or content, and vice versa? 6. At what point do Mexican films operate on a deeper level of narrative prototypicality? Does a film lose its ideal audience when it includes a high degree of cultural specificity yet follows story structures that are universally recognizable as comic, heroic, or tragic? 7. Do some Mexican movies appeal to non-Mexican audiences more than others do? If so, how and what kind of audience—mainstream or art-house? Page 4 → These are the kinds of questions I ask when slicing reality to identify this entity called contemporary Mexican cinema. I acknowledge the artificiality of these questions. After all, I am cutting a slice out of a much larger pie, one that is global in scope. This is a scholarly slice—and we will learn much about what constitutes this slice—but a slice always seen as a part of a larger, planetary whole. This is why, even as I carve out my particular piece, I pay attention not just to the way Mexican cinema is always idiosyncratic and particular (a specific expression of faculties used to imagine and create an aesthetic form in time and place) but also to the way it is a particularized expression of our universal capacity to think, feel, and symbolically represent our experiences in our one world.\n\nOther Ways to Slice I am by no means the first to characterize Mexican cinema. Other scholars writing in both Spanish and English have been doing this for quite some time. Each of these scholars has used specific criteria for defining the contours of Mexican cinema, and, although the criteria differ, they often overlap. I'm including a sample (available to English-reading audiences) of like-minded approaches to sketch the lay of the scholarly land. Some scholars try to construct the genre of Mexican cinema around Mexican film archives and contemporary canons. Paulo Antonio Paranaguá, for example, seeks to archive the Mexican cinema of yesterday; in his edited volume Mexican Cinema,4 he offers a series of critical film histories of early Mexican cinema, from the early\n\nsound cinema to the studio system and the ever-popular genre comedia ranchera. The archivist Rogelio Agrasánchez Jr. examines the distribution, exhibition, and reception of Mexican films across the northern border in Mexican Movies in the United States: A History of the Films, Theaters, and Audiences, 1920–1960.5 By 1951 there were 683 screens (100 in Texas alone) in 443 U.S. cities playing Spanishlanguage films. Agrasánchez discusses how these establishments included venues designed as theaters, as well as those converted to the purpose, with some devoted exclusively to Spanish-language entertainment and others integrating Mexican films into their programs with varying frequencies; how Spanish-language films in the United States fostered both ethnic pride (in most cases, a sense of mexicanidad) and “Americanization”; and how many theaters offered hybrid programs, with Mexican films sharing their screens with Hollywood features. Doyle Greene's Mexploitation Cinema Page 5 → attends to the way shifts in the industry and Mexican filmgoing culture generated a flood of luchador (masked wrestler) films with no aesthetic pretense.6 Jason Wood's The Faber Book of Mexican Cinema and Talking Movies: Contemporary World Filmmakers in Interview,7 as well as Jethro Soutar's Gael García Bernal and the Latin American New Wave,8 focus on today's Mexican film industry and canon in various ways. Soutar writes, for instance, that “recounting the tale of Gael García Bernal introduces and encourages the telling of the Latin American New Wave…. It also charts the course of the twenty-first century's first major film movement and puts it in its historical and cultural context.”9 In Splendors of Latin Cinema, R. Hernandez-Rodriguez engages the film traditions that make up the cinema of Latin America generally and Mexico specifically. For Hernandez-Rodriguez, this is especially important today with the “emergence of a new, exciting, more sophisticated cinema.”10 And Paul Julian Smith's regular contributions to film journals, as well as his book-length study of Amores perros, focus on contemporary Mexican cinema. In the prologue to his book Amores Perros he states, “A place of extreme contrasts, Mexico City is also a prize location for a cinema of extremes.”11 Some scholars who pursue a Mexican film archive see it as tied directly to political or historical contexts. These scholars tend to link periods of Mexican filmmaking to the policies of particular administrations and their cycles of six-year (sexenio) terms, as well as to trade and tax policies and nation-state agendas generally. In Magical Reels, John King uses a big brush to paint a portrait of the way in which historical, economic, and political shifts controlled the ebb and flow of Mexican films made from the 1940s through the 1980s.12 In Mexican Cinema: Reflections of a Society, 1896–2004, Carl J. Mora reconstructs, for instance, how the 1990s North American Trade Agreement (NAFTA) trade and tax policies pulled the rug out from under Mexican filmmakers by declaring state-funded support to be an unfair trade practice.13 For Mora, this dammed the flow of monetary support for Mexican filmmakers from such state-funded mainstays as IMCINE, the National Film School, the Center for Cinematic Preparation, and Estudios Churubusco Azteca, a film studio and lab that the RKO studio built in the 1940s. In “Developing History/Historicizing Development in Mexican Nuevo Cine Manifestoes around ‘la Crisis,’” Scott L. Baugh links Mexican film with a sociopolitical epoch in his analysis of the 1960s Nuevo Cine Group's manifesto.14 In “The French New Wave,” Timothy Dugdale links Mexican film to a given sociopolitical Page 6 → moment in his analysis of Y tu mamá también, interpreting, for instance, the movement of Julio and Tenoch from city to countryside as representative of “the larger existential crisis of national ‘development’ in a globalised economy.”15 According to Dugdale, when the Oaxacan countryside “resists development” and “confounds the fetish of development,”16 at the same time its presence infiltrates and destroys the lives of the two friends. Other scholars focus on representations in Mexican cinema that reflect (critically or otherwise) the social, political, and national issues of Mexico. Such scholarship clusters around issues like modernity, the legacy of the Mexican Revolution, indigeneity, masculinity, and patriarchy, as well as the U.S.-Mexico border, as does Andrea Noble (e.g., in Mexican National Cinema).17 Sergio de la Mora questions essentialist notions of a macho and patriarchal mexicanidad by attending to the queer and feminist representations in Mexico's so-called Golden Age films. In Cinemachismo de la Mora argues that the highly sexualized and macho identities circulated during the Golden Age (1940s–50s) both inform a national cultural identity and offer a parodic critique of an essentialist\n\nmexicanidad.18 Miriam Haddu explores how Carlos Salinas de Gortari's six-year term opened doors (wittingly or not) for Mexican directors to represent “the concerns, issues, politics, hopes, and fears of the Mexican people in an era of transition.”19 According to Haddu, films such as Cuarón's Sólo con tu pareja (1991), Jorge Fons's Rojo amanecer (1989), Gabriel Retes's El bulto (1991), and Luis Estrada's La ley de Herodes (1999) reflect a Mexican film industry searching for a “visual identity and for the country's reassertion of a sense of hybrid national and postcolonial identity.”20 In Women Filmmakers in Mexico, Elissa J. Rashkin attends to more feminist-oriented films created by Mexican women directors. For Rashkin, Mexicana filmmakers critically engage with a patriarchal-based mexicanidad by making films that demand “the transformation of the existing nation into one which not only permits but actually emerges from the diverse subject positions of its constituent populations—women, religious minorities, social and sexual dissidents, indigenous peoples, the urban poor.”21 (In one way or another, this scholarship aims to identify otro cinema that challenges stereotypes and clears, as Rashkin nicely sums up of her own goals, “a space of collective identification.”22) In Cinema of Solitude, Charles Ramírez Berg traces a shift in national identity. He argues that contemporary Mexican cinema moved away from an identity based on a sense of mexicanidad as being in crisis and caught between “Old World roots and New World locations.”23 Armed with this new vision, Page 7 → directors no longer represent virginal women as being out of time and place or indios as being pure repositories of a past frozen in time; rather, they put complex women at center stage and complicate the representation of indios.24 Scholars have also analyzed and critiqued representational trends. In Latino Images Charles Ramírez Berg, for instance, points to a tradition in Mexican (and Mexico-based) cinema that dates back to Serge Eisenstein (¡Que Viva México!), followed by Emilio “El Indio” Fernández and Gabriel Figueroa, wherein the image of the indio mirrors Mexico's (postrevolution) official administrative policies: culturally affirming the presence of indios while instituting economic, education, and health care policies that have led to their annihilation.25 In Mexico City in Contemporary Mexican Cinema, David William Foster looks at fourteen Mexican films and how they create an opposition between the urban (Mexico City) and the rural. While many Mexican films set in rural areas implicitly critique a fragmented and alienating Mexico City, Foster contends that these films simultaneously reinforce representations of the rural as primitive.26 In a like vein, Emily Hind sets into high critical relief the ongoing urban versus rural (provincia) thematic in Mexican films. Many Mexican films set their stories in the rural provinces, where transgression of social, gender, and racial hierarchies takes place. For Hind the rural functions as a space that “facilitates social freedom.”27 For instance, in her reading of María Novaro'sLola (1989), Hind locates much of the violence and stifling gender and generational hierarchies in Mexico City and considers provincia to be the place of gender and generational empowerment and emancipation. Like Berg, Hind tempers her affirmative reading of the representation of provincia, carefully analyzing how it functions to romanticize the countryside and its people. While Mexican films do sometimes portray the countryside as a place to escape from class- and gender-inflected struggles, it also functions as a place for Mexican, middle-class, urban characters (and filmgoing audiences) to experience a transgressive thrill. Among scholars of Mexican and Latin American cinema generally, some seek to identify the uniqueness of a given film tradition marked by cultural, historical, and national particularities. For example, Freya Schiwy identifies “a cultural politics of decolonization” at work in Quechua, Zapotec, and Moxeña film productions. 28 She considers how indigenous filmmaking (funded by the multiethnic Organization of Indigenous Audiovisual Communicators in Bolivia) stands against mainstream and art-house films, such as those by Alejandro González Iñárritu, Hector Babenco, and Walter Salles. Such scholars Page 8 → approach “indigenous” film production (making and worldview) as important repositories of cultural memory and knowledge.\n\nSome scholars seek to trouble claims of a unique content informing Mexican cinema. These scholars go against the grain of earlier scholarship, which sought to identify a Mexicanness in opposition to the U.S. mainstream film industry and instead look for common ground. For instance, Laura Podalsky complicates our understanding of the way Mexican films do or do not create a mexicanidad. She thus demonstrates that, while at first blush González Iñárritu's Amores perros may appear to convey a contemporary Mexicanness, a closer inspection reveals how it expresses a U.S.-identified neoliberal ideology; resting on an ideology less Mexican revolutionary than U.S. imperialist, the film does little to disrupt and disturb audiences comfortably ensconced in a middle-class complacency.29 In a book focused on a single director, Alejandro González Iñárritu, Celestino Deleyto and María del Mar Azcona “interrogate the validity of the concept of Mexican national cinema and explore the extent to which the texts originate from and illuminate the extremely porous nature of that concept.”30 Along with examining González Iñárritu, they mention Alfonso Cuarón and Guillermo del Toro as directors who redefine the concept of mexicanidad in their films, all of which appeal to “local spectators,” as well as an “international audience.”31 A number of scholars who locate Mexican films within the global explore the circuits of production and distribution of Mexican films as a particularized expression of world cinema. For instance, Paul Julian Smith traces the global economic links formed between Mexico and Spain both in production (Altavista and Anhelo, respectively) and in the casting of Spanish actors and actresses in Mexican films.32 In Screening World Cinema, Catherine Grant and Annette Kuhn discuss the importance of identifying Mexican cinema, or “Third World cinema” more generally, not according to geopolitical boundaries but rather in terms of a continuum between mainstream and experimental alternative film.33\n\nPage 9 →\n\nThe Nuts and Bolts of Mexican Film Like all cinematic narrative, Mexican films are first and foremost built of movement: of objects and characters within the frame, of the camera focus and angle, and in the juxtaposition of shots. More precisely, it is a doublestructured ordering of movement (within the frame and in its composition) that allows Mexican filmmakers to reorganize the building blocks of reality (and experience within this reality) in an infinite number of ways to engage viewers. Such devices are used to create meaning and stir emotion in us, sometimes harshly so, as with sonic blasts or radically surprising image juxtapositions. Like all film narrative, Mexican films operate according to a double chronology: the time of the thing told (story events, characters, and so on) and the time of the telling (devices used to arrange and rearrange elements of the story so as to stretch or shrink story time and story space). Another way to think of this is to consider how a director uses elements and structures to modify the chronology of the represented world in ways that trigger thoughts, feelings, moods, and possibly new perspectives on the world in his or her audiences. In this sense, then, Mexican films that do engage audiences do so less at the level of the story than at the level of the manner in which the story is filmed. The camera-narrator (or discourse level) determines the order in which the audience receives the narrative events, characters, and so on contained within the story. The typical manipulation of temporal order arises in flashback (looking back, or analepsis), flash-forward (anticipation, or prolepsis), and combinations of the two, as in a flashforward within an extended flashback and vice versa. Of course all this pushes against the narrative's natural movement forward in time. This is why Seymour Chatman argues that true description (which entails a pause in the temporal flow of the narrative) is Page 10 → not possible in a storytelling medium such as film, which necessarily reels forward in time.1 In this sense, films cannot describe. They show and present. However, not all is lost. The double-structured ordering, together with filmic devices, allows directors to manipulate their stories in ways that project an illusion of slowing down or speeding up time (and expanding or shrinking space) in a physical medium that is by technological necessity always moving forward in time, illusions Alejandro González Iñárritu uses in Amores perros and Carlos Reygadas employs in Japón and his follow-up films. The combination of both the story (content) and the way this content is presented visually and aurally by way of editing, lensing, sound recording and mixing, and the like gives a film its distinctive audiovisual style. Some directors, such as Reygadas, play with this expectation of forward movement by repeatedly reprinting a frame so that it plays out over time. This gives the effect of separating that particular image from the rest of the moving images and the illusion that we are viewing a photographic still. This is just an illusion, however. The film hasn't stopped moving forward in time. Of course today we can hit the pause button and impose a static image on this necessarily forward moving series of images. But this is physically imposed after the fact, not an inherent possibility in the technology of the forward-moving media. Mexican film directors recognize that this storytelling medium operates at its most fundamental level on the possibilities offered by this double chronology. They also know that it is not the same as a ballet or theater production, a painting, a comic book, or a novel. This is not to say that directors don't employ techniques from these other aesthetic forms. They do. Arturo Ripstein uses his camera in a way that makes his motion photography feel staged and theatrically mannered. And at certain moments in Amar te duele (2002; Loving you hurts) Fernando Sariñana cuts in sequences that move the story forward through comic-book panel grids and graphics. Different media use different (albeit sometimes overlapping) devices and structures. Thus, directors realize that, for instance, the use of a voice-over to present an omniscient third-person narrator or a narrator who is also a character in the story offers only a pale imitation of such narrators in novels or short stories. They are aware that\n\nthe careful direction of a character's intentional movement within a scene can lead us to infer an interiority of mind, and that this is not the same movement we see choreographed in ballet. They understand that in film a series of reels of stitched-together stills necessarily moves the images forward sequentially and temporally without pause. They understand that the final, edited product will be run across a light in a cinema to project the illusion of a three-dimensional storyworld space. Page 11 → In Cinematic Storytelling Jennifer Van Sijll succinctly states, “A well-crafted film uses everything to contribute to story.”2 In fact one might argue that the stories generally are finite in number and rather typical in plot features (e.g., epic, tragic, or comic). Indeed, a viewer's interest is captured not so much by the story per se as by the way the story is told. This includes the director's decisions about camera placement, lighting, composition, motion, editing, and sound to shape and give texture and rhythm to the story's plot, actions, and characters. Of course, whether the film is a romance, epic, tragedy, or comedy, or any hybrid combination of these, it helps to have a good script, but this means not just one that tells a good tale but also one that is written for the medium of film, with its palette of audiovisual techniques clearly in mind. We experience any given Mexican film as a gestalt of story and form. When the script suffers, so, too, does the film; similarly, when the form suffers, so, too, does the story. A lack of coherence in the use of film devices and structure damages the film as a whole. Likewise, however good the director, a bad cinematographer, one lacking imagination and skill, can seriously harm the film; however good the director and the cinematographer, a bad editor can similarly wreak havoc. Whereas these three entities play key roles in the making of any film, the screenwriter can be deeply involved in the process or completely separate from it. In either case, however, the script provides a constant reference for the director, cinematographer, and editor; even when they don't adhere to it, the script is there, and we can say, no, they did not follow the script but instead decided to do something different. For a case in point, consider the very public and angry breakup between screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga and director González Iñárritu over artistic differences and script interpretation, a team otherwise intricately entangled in the making of Amores perros, 21 Grams, and Babel.\n\nAnatomies While infinite in their combination, the devices, structures, and concepts key to a film's blueprint may be organized according to a sort of periodic table.\n\nScreen Direction In one of the ten vignettes that make up the omnibus film Revolución (2010), we can see director Rodrigo García's extensive use of screen direction. (In the United States, García is known for directing episodes of the HBO series Page 12 → Six Feet Under and In Treatment, as well as the feature films Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her and Mother and Child.) Included in Revolución is García's short film7th Street and Alvarado. The film shows us how a careful use of movement within the shot and across sequences creates meaning and conflict. In one scene, pedestrians are going about their daily activities in a present-day Latino barrio of Los Angeles, moving mostly from screen left to screen right. Superimposed in the foreground appear exhausted men and women of the Mexican Revolution. They are walking systematically from the right to the left of the screen. Quite apart from other issues of time and space (the movement of the people and horses happens in its own space, floating in front of a present with its own spatial markers) and of the way an audience might create meaning from this juxtaposition, we can see how the blueprint works to create a tension between movement along the horizontal of the screen: conventionally, protagonists enter and move through the screen from left to right, while antagonists usually enter from the right and move toward the left. (Some argue that eyes move more comfortably from left to right for a variety of reasons, especially in countries where reading follows this directionality.)\n\nIn the careful orchestration of simultaneous movement and countermovement, García introduces two elements that, according to cinematographic convention and viewing expectation, should reflect some type of conflict between antagonist and protagonist. This doesn't happen here. García's two opposing movements—all in slow motion—create a sense of simultaneous, though discomfiting, flow. We are never told this, but we know and feel García's message: history lives with us, uncomfortably.\n\nFrame Composition To give the sense of distinct times to the activities of today's East Los Angeles denizens beneath the superimposed times of the early-twentieth-century revolutionaries and people weary from battle, García chooses distinct shapes (buildings, animals, people); slow pans; medium-long shots; natural lighting; and luscious blue, green, yellow, red, and brown colors (shot on rich color stock). He also slows the motion speed and creates counterdirectional movement that never collides. He uses a specific technique of movement direction to convey a message about history's inescapable presence in our lives and, as well, to elicit empathetic feelings (e.g., for the hardships of those who fought for freedoms enjoyed today) and an overall somber, sobering mood. Other directors, such as Patricia Riggen, prefer to play it safer, using Page 13 → framing composition (shape, lighting, color, motion) to make the viewing experience absolutely comfortable and comforting. We see this in her feature film La misma luna/Under the Same Moon (2007) and in her short film Lindo y querido (Beautiful and beloved), also in Revolución. In the latter film, concerning a dead father's repatriation to Mexico for burial, she uses conventional framing composition to convey the meaning of the story. The scenes shot in the United States depict a militaristic nationalism (U.S. flags, coffins with military jets, decals, and the like). Vibrant colors and traditional music fill the scenes in Mexico, depicting a community of people who share stories that value history and the many people who make history. It ends with a series of shots—a medium close-up of a daughter holding the dirt where her father is buried and then a pan out and fade—that show the community gathered together. “All we need is another revolution; that's what your grandfather would say,” one octogenarian tells the daughter as the film fades out to its end.\n\nEditing Mexican filmmakers use editing either to hide a film's constructedness in representing, reframing, and reorganizing reality or to call attention to the constructedness of this (re)presentation of reality. In this respect, most directors resemble Patricia Riggen, who, as she does in her previously mentioned vignette and her La misma luna, uses conventions of editing to create the illusion of reality unfolding before our eyes. Others, such as Julián Hernández, Page 14 → use a self-reflexive montage approach in their editing. And a few, including Alfonso Cuarón and Fernando Sariñana, occasionally employ both techniques across their oeuvre. In all cases, however, editing involves purposefully constructing scenes by assembling shots in specific ways meant to guide viewers to the ideal audience's cognitive and emotive response. This is not news. In 1926 Russian director Vsevolod Pudovkin identified editing as “one of the most significant instruments of effect possessed by the film technician and, therefore, by the scenarist also.”3 Given the clarity and precision of Pudovkin's observation, let me quote him at length here. The significance of editing, he continues, is that it “builds the scenes from separate pieces, of which each concentrates the attention of the spectator only on that element important to the action. The sequence of these pieces must not be uncontrolled, but must correspond to the natural transference of attention of an imaginary observer (who, in the end, is represented by the spectator).”4 Conversely, he remarks, “If the editing be merely an uncontrolled combination of the various pieces, the spectator will understand (apprehend) nothing from it; but if it be co-orientated according to a definitely selected course of events or conceptual line, either agitated or calm, it will either excite or soothe the spectator.”5 For Pudovkin, then, careful editing is not simply splicing together shots but rather a tool the director uses for the “‘psychological guidance’ of the spectator.”6 Skilled Mexican filmmakers are intuitively aware that the art of cinema is the art of movement: (a) within the story frame there is movement in the form of shifts in states of mind and emotion, as well as physical action and\n\nmotion speed and direction; and (b) at the level of the storytelling device and structure there is movement created by the edits, camera motion, and camera lensing. One of Pudovkin's contemporaries, Viktor Shklovsky, declared this, too, early in the history of film. A year before Pudovkin penned the words just quoted, Shklovsky wrote that “the primary raw material of cinema is not the filmed object but a certain method of filming it.”7 More recently, Colin McGinn has run home the foundational points made by Pudovkin and Shklovsky, stating that “movie art is largely the science of converting feeling into action, making movement the bearer of emotion.”8 More specifically, Mexican filmmakers use editing (along with other elements I mention later) to convert feeling into action and make movement the bearer of emotion in ways that conform on a basic level to perceptual and psychological laws. Even the movement created by sharply juxtaposing images—the montage in Hernández, for instance, or even more radically that of the old-schooler Alejandro Jodorowsky—is usually not so radical as to be Page 15 → perceptually and psychologically intolerable and incomprehensible. If there were no sense to the montage—self-reflexive or not in aim—then we would simply lose interest; we would go elsewhere to fulfill our perceptual and psychological needs. Fernando Eimbcke is a director who uses editing both to seamlessly present his storyworlds and to stretch time. We see this in his movie Temporada de patos/Duck Season (2004); his more behaviorist films, such as Lake Tahoe (2008); and his vignette La bienvenida (The welcoming) in Revolución. In the ten-minute vignette, for instance, which depicts twenty-four hours in the life of Armancio (Ansberto Flores López), a series of shots that average ten to twenty seconds separated by fades tells us nothing of his motivations but much about his life: after feeding his newborn, Armancio practices his tuba by a kerosene lamp. Fade in: daylight. He washes himself from a bucket of water and leaves the infant with a grandmother figure; dressed in a clean white shirt and black pants, he walks with tuba in hand to join the town's band. In all, the film's composition conveys the sense that he takes his tuba playing seriously. Eimbcke's use of long takes, along with a series of well-timed fades, works to create a pace and rhythm that conveys the passage of time (day to night, then night to day, and then morning to afternoon). The pacing captures the tempo of life for the villagers of San Felipe Otlaltepec, and does so without sentimentality. The band awaits the arrival of some dignitaries. Cuts between shots of band members doing other things while waiting, such as reading the paper and combing their hair, are crafted with a precision of psychological guidance in mind. We sense the disappointment when the dignitaries fail to arrive, but they are not incensed by it. The camera, editing, lighting, and natural sounds convey a sense of a tempered response to the letdown. The cows moo, horses whinny, and Armancio continues to practice his tuba. Life goes on. Carlos Reygadas uses editing to stretch and shrink time in his short film Este es mi reino (This is my kingdom), yet another segment of Revolución. The latter effect is especially pronounced in the construction of scenes that lead to the film's denouement. The quick succession of shots creates a mosaic effect that intensifies the action within the sequence. It creates frenetic energy and a sense of chaos. A few minutes into the film, Reygadas introduces a series of sudden jump cuts to depict kids jumping on a random wrecked car in a field, people burping, a man dedicating a poem to consciousness and ancestral roots, grown-ups throwing a bench at a car window, and a man peeing, among other actions. Reygadas introduces to these feverish sequences a Page 16 → cacophony of tuba and drum noises within the diegesis. Speaking in Spanish, a figure announces, “It's dangerous here. The police never come and never have been here”; at the same time, a woman declares in English, “They don't need disorder; they need you to tell them.” But the audience already feels this. The images and sounds chosen convey a story wherein the countryside is anything but inert and knowable. Of course, Reygadas's rather open-ended blueprint leaves many gaps to fill. This is a Reygadas trademark. All his filmic blueprints lack a sense of motivation on the part of the character (behaviorist), and his editing and other elements only very loosely guide the audience's meaning-making processes. Mexican film directors are keenly aware of the way visual images can be cut to match one another or not. In the case of Reygadas's Kingdom, the film's effect of devolving into pandemonium is reinforced by images that do not match in terms of content, graphics, shape, motion, size, and color. The sounds of the tuba and drum function as\n\nan audio bridge that allows the audience to mentally glue together disparate images. That said, even this audio bridge is cacophonous. That is, Reygadas and similar directors (say, his disciple Amat Escalante) want to make audiences feel uncomfortable, even deeply uncomfortable. For the most part, however, Reygadas and Escalante are exceptions. Most Mexican film directors (even of the arthouse variety) use visual match cuts and audio bridges to create the illusion of action taking place seamlessly. These directors want us to derive our meaning and feeling from elsewhere in the blueprint, carefully controlling and directing matters to ensure that we do so.\n\nCamera Viewers typically do not notice a director's choice of medium (e.g., film vs. digital video), camera (e.g., 35 mm vs. 16 mm or Steadicam vs. handheld), camera movement (tracking and pan shots, say, or fixed vs. moving), and lens (conventional vs. wide-angle or telephoto). But these constitute important ingredients in directing audiences’ meaning-making and feeling processes. In his short film Padre Nicolas Hung (yet another segment of Revolución), Amat Escalante uses several kinds of camera movement and lensing to convey meaning in a story that has almost no dialogue. We do have a vague sense of the because that gives a vague indication of the plot: two children riding a donkey come across a priest hanging by his feet from a tree, with the burned carcass of a horse nearby. The boy tells the priest that “they” came to the farm Page 17 → and took all the grown-ups. The rest of the film's meaning is carried largely by the technical elements of the editing, camera movement, sound, and lensing. We get the deep sense of the characters’ alienation and feelings of being lost and forsaken as the children and the priest travel through an arid landscape. The editing conveys shifts in time and place—they come across water and eventually a city—and the use of different lenses intensifies different moments of their journey. As they come close to dying from dehydration but continue to walk, Escalante uses a telephoto lens, its shallow depth of field compressing space; we see them walking toward us but seemingly not moving. Their motion is slowed to a near total stasis even though we know they are moving forward. Suspense is heightened. Will they make it, or will they die in the desert? In the last series of shots, Escalante uses a wide-angle lens to speed up the motion within the frame. In this sequence, the priest is walking and the boy is carrying the little girl slumped on his back as they come to a freeway at the outskirts of a city. The wide-angle lens's depth of focus allows us to see simultaneously the outline of the city buildings, the children in the foreground, and the priest in the middle ground. Body language conveys how each character reacts to this moment. For the final shot, Escalante uses a long shot to show them walking into a McDonald's restaurant. The careful use of lens and mise-en-scène intensifies the experience of isolation and alienation: first, with the journey across the desert; and, second, with their diminutive status, a fragile state within a city of freeways and imperialist golden arches.\n\nLighting Like all their peers, Mexican film directors know that lighting can convey meaning; its consistent use in a given film can help generate an overall mood. In Padre Nicolas Hung, Escalante operates as we might expect him to do. In the desert scenes he uses a wide aperture, allowing more light to enter the lens (overexposure) to intensify our sense of the brittle and dry landscape. The cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (the director of photography, or DP, for González Iñárritu's films) used the technique of bleach bypass on the film negative to desaturate certain hues (e.g., in skin tones) and enhance other hues, such as reds and blues, to give Amores perros an imperfect look and (because light contrasts and shadows diminish) to compress foreground, middle ground, and background, adding to a sense of chaos and urgency. (He uses this technique in 21 Grams, too, as well as in the story thread in Babel focused on Mexico.) Page 18 → For Sin nombre/Without a Name (2009), Cary Fukunaga's DP, Adriano Goldman, chose to use just the lights\n\nfound in working railroads; he used reflectors (bounce boards) to deflect and bounce the available light off objects and throw it toward the actors. Both Fukunaga and Goldman understand how light and shadow can intensify our sense of the anxiety and danger characters experience while awaiting the right moment to climb atop boxcars for an imperiled journey north to the United States. The move from a crane shot to a long shot on the ground, the foreboding sound of guards’ whistles and the noise of the train's engine, and jolting movement—all intensify these emotions. These elements also mark this moment as pivotal in the story, for it is the beginning of Sayra's (Paulina Gaitan) dangerous journey through Mexico to the United States.\n\nLocations As I suggested with Escalante's short film, shot mostly in the desert, location, too, can convey meaning and emotion (short in duration) and mood (long in duration). And, although an audience might not know this, the choice of location is often so determinative of a film's meaning and mood that a director will sometimes create (via physical sets or special effects) an artificial location or find another natural location that better conveys the sense of place than the actual place does. The sequences in Sin nombre that the script and film identify as occurring in Honduras (Remedios) and Chiapas (Tapachula, southern Mexico) were actually shot in and around Mexico City. While cost and danger (Tapachula's train yard is infamously perilous) were motivations for filming in Mexico City, Fukunaga's location team did not find just any place to film. They worked to discover locations that would look like Remedios and Tapachula. (The final sequence is a crane shot of Sayra walking across a parking lot at a Sam's Club and Wal-Mart. This is portrayed as the United States in the film, but it was actually filmed in Mexico City.) Location is one thing, but the objects and people within the location must cohere with it. Fukunaga had his professional Mexican actors work hard to learn the working-class accents of these regions. In this case we can see how the careful planning of location and elements associated with that location (whether genuine or ersatz), including the regional accent of characters, work together to take viewers to places they may never have been and pull them into a coherent story that leads them to invest emotionally in its characters and their journey. Some directors, such as Alfonso Cuarón, use carefully chosen objects tied Page 19 → to a location to evoke an interface with other times and spaces. While Children of Men (2006) is set in the near future (2027), the objects Cuarón chooses to fill his locations—from homes of the wealthy to refugee camps—create a palimpsest of time and space: the audience is directed to overlay the locations in the film with those of Abu Ghraib, for instance.\n\nImplied Director The elements that make up a blueprint generate in us an image of a grand conductor, a master of ceremonies of film devices. These add up to our sense of an implied director's worldview. In Narration in the Fiction Film, David Bordwell declares that we are well served by talking about film as “the organization of a set of cues for the construction of a story. To this we might add the useful concept of the implied director or implied creator.”9 The concept has prompted a great deal of debate, but I consider the implied director to be a useful notion. When we go to the movies, we do get a sense of an entity orchestrating all the parts to make the whole. Of course we feel this presence to a greater or lesser degree. Many, though not all, of the bubblegum (sweet and easily chewed, but with no sustenance) and refrito (refried and rehashed) films I talk about later only weakly suggest the presence of an implied director—though the same can be said about some of those we might classify as art-house films. Nonetheless, many Mexican films evoke this presence powerfully. In Fukunaga's Sin nombre, for instance, we grow a strong sense of an intention behind the story's internal coherence and overall audiovisual aesthetic. When we watch a Mexican film (or any film, for that matter), our minds give shape to this implied director, an entity who uses the devices of lighting, lenses, locations, and the like in ways that not only shape the story but\n\nconvey a worldview, an evaluative stance regarding the world and its machinations. If the implied director takes shape in viewers’ minds and does so in ways that are important to the viewing experience, then it is useful to take the phenomenon into account. Doing so does not require going to a Mexican filmmaker's biography; rather, we must assess how each blueprint generates this entity and what kind of worldview it projects. And this can lead to rather shocking and surprising results. If we attend carefully to Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth, we see that below the surface of its pagan, mystical, and mythologically informed fairy tale the blueprint itself indicates an implied director with a spiritualist worldview. Page 20 → It is not especially surprising that the implied director we build in our minds would end the film with the young, innocent Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), who is not totally of our world. Del Toro and his DP, Guillermo Navarro, use wide angles and lighting evocative of auras to present Ofelia in a Christ-like manner. The end comes. Ofelia does die on the human plane of existence but is resurrected as a queen of the underworld with light streaming from behind her. She passes across to an otherworldly spiritual realm, yet a realm as material as her everyday human reality. We grow a sense of an implied director who considers the solution to the violence and murder of the Spanish Civil War to be solved not by human hand but through a faith that life will be better in an ethereal otherworld. Location matters, of course. We build this worldview of the implied director “del Toro” because he locates Pan's Labyrinth in Spain during a particularly brutal moment in that nation's history. As all the ingredients of the blueprint begin to add up—location, lensing, lighting, choice of actors, historical moment, and so on—we develop a strong sense of the implied director's Jungian-Catholic spiritualist worldview. And as I'll detail at length later in the book, Alfonso Cuarón's filmic blueprint for Children of Men does not so much present a new worldview, as its art-house gloss might have us think, as it does an age-old tried and trite spiritualism. In Reygadas's films Japón (2002), Batalla en el cielo/Battle in Heaven (2005), and Luz silenciosa/Silent Light (2008), and the short film Kingdom, the implied director, “Reygadas,” denies the audience any sense of interiority to the characters. Reygadas has perfected a behaviorist cinema. He uses the camera only to show characters’ actions without giving the audience any clue about the mind-set behind such actions. In Japón, for example, an unnamed, middle-aged protagonist (the nonprofessional actor Alejandro Ferretis) has, for no apparent reason, gerontophilic sex with his very aged landlady, Ascen (the nonprofessional Magdalena Flores). For no apparent reason, the villagers begin to take down her house stone by stone. In Batalla en el cielo, nothing explains why Ana (Anapola Mushkadiz), a wealthy young woman, would have sex with her overweight chauffeur, Marcos (Marcos Hernández), or why he suddenly kills her. And in the film Luz silenciosa, which follows the story of a Mennonite family—an isolated Germanic cultural and linguistic minority living in Chihuahua—and includes exceptionally long tracking shots (the opening one lasts five minutes, following as the night turns to morning), the audience has absolutely no idea why the father, Johan (Cornelio Wall Fehr), behaves as he does (e.g., his near totally mute or speechless affair with Marianne, played by Maria Pankratz) or why his wife, Esther (Miriam Toews), Page 21 → slips into a coma following a heart attack and then suddenly breathes life once again. The implied director here carefully controls the elements of the blueprint in ways that require a huge amount of filling in gaps—so much so that we can fill in almost any kind of meaning. This gap-filling work might try the patience of a regular filmgoing crowd, but art-house and mainstream critics have applauded Reygadas's trademark style. Tatiana Lipkes considers his film Japón an “exploration of the lie hidden behind reality” (my translation).10 José Teodoro considers Batalla en el cielo to be a “labyrinth of metaphors and confrontational imagery punctuated with incongruous sexual matches and cryptic rehearsals of Mexican social, political, and religious rituals.”11 And Luz silenciosa picked up five Golden Ariels (Mexico's equivalent of an Academy Award), including those for best director and best screenplay. The degree and kind of work that a film's blueprint asks us to do lead us to create a mental image of an implied director. Some filmmakers, including Reygadas and Amat Escalante (among other world-cinema directors such as David Lynch, Werner Herzog, Andrei Tarkovsky, and Lars von Trier), create film blueprints with huge gaps to be filled, or not, as the viewer prefers. In the case of Reygadas, we can see how he prompts viewers to posit an implied director “Reygadas” with a behaviorist, blank-slate worldview. The implied director concept as generated from the film-watching experience can reveal much about the way in\n\nwhich filmic blueprint elements function as more than cognitive and emotive guides for the audience. Specifically, it can reveal much about the unstated ideology of a film. I don't want to throw intention out with the bathwater here. Echoing Marx's remarks about work, we can say that the intention behind the construction of a particular table to be a particular size, height, and so on is crucial for the outcome; it determines whether we end up with a round table, a square table, or what have you. And this sort of background intention is perhaps more important in cinema than in many other spheres. Cinema is such a complex activity, with so many involved, that it is difficult to pinpoint a single creator. You can attribute a film to an individual, calling it, say, “a film by Alfonso Cuarón” or “by del Toro,” and so on, but these names are mere synecdoches for a collective entity: the implied director. Whether the film is Mexican or something else, viewers see only the final product, and the general impression created by this final product and the resulting judgments are what generate the concept of the implied director or implied filmmaker. The implied director, then, is always present. Page 22 →\n\nToolbox in Action When we view De la calle/Streeters (2001), we infer an implied director we likely call “Gerardo Tort,” who orchestrates all the devices—jump cuts, bleached-out film stock, natural lighting and shadows, extradiegetic ominous and suspenseful music—to portray a coherent world of Mexico City's street kids. The implied director uses all the devices in the toolbox to unsentimentally bring the despair and destruction of contemporary youth to an assaultive immediacy. There is no attempt at embellishment and no infusion of pseudo-religious hope. The implied director creates a storyworld wherein rare exceptions exist: Rufino (Luis Fernando Peña) and Xóchitl (Maya Zapata), who imagine other ways of existing and who make plans to escape. They dream of leaving the sewers, alleys, and streets of Mexico City for Vera Cruz, where Rufino plans to work in the dockyards. The implied director uses all the previously mentioned tools to create compelling antagonists—more the rule than the exception, such as Rufino's supposed best friend, Cero (Armando Hernández). Through carefully choreographed acting, Hernández conveys a sociopathic psychology grown and directed toward the single purpose of survival. Stool pigeon to a corrupt cop (and rapist), Cero betrays his friends, Rufino and Xóchitl. Cero's cold-blooded actions lead to Xóchitl's rape and the murder of Rufino. In a present filled with hostility and violence, there is no future. There is no possibility of developing a causal or counterfactual system that would lead to their sense of possibility in the future. The careful writing of Cero's character and choreographing of body movement and facial expression convey powerfully the sense of his already living as dead in the world. Finally, Tort's careful choice of lighting, time of day (night), sound score, editing, camera angle, and actor expression and movement work together to intensify the ideal audience's experience of this tragic story. All this is achieved through a careful integration of form and story to create a film that holds at bay shallow, clichéd responses on the part of the ideal audience. It resists slips into the sentimentality so easily wrought in films about oppressed and exploited children.\n\nPage 23 →\n\nHecho a Mano…Hecho por Homo sapiens While each is unique in his or her film-story expression, Mexican filmmakers are all feeling, thinking, and imagining human beings who share a deep and long evolutionary history with other filmmakers and audiences—human beings in our totality—the world over. We have learned to know ourselves as a single species, each one of whose members is endowed with more or less the same cognitive (intellectual and emotive) capacities, needing to satisfy the same basic (social, affective, intellectual, and biological) needs, and constantly seeking ways to realize new goals. As Alison Gopnik nicely sums it up, “Our ability to represent the causal structure of the world and the mind and to imagine and create possible new worlds and minds is one powerful engine of human change. But our ability to revise and transform those representations, to observe and experiment, and to learn from those observations and experiments gives us an even more powerful engine of change.”1 Mexican filmmakers are human, and therefore they are biologically social and socially biological parts of nature. They are the biological part of nature that is capable of knowing and changing the world thanks to its social activity, and they are (inseparably) the social part of nature that develops its activity in a social, associative manner that, in turn, realizes changes in us as social and biological individuals and in our society, both in part and as a whole. Indeed, it is now a quite well established fact that nature and nurture are distinct categories only at the epistemological level. At the ontological level they are part of one inseparable whole. This explains why there are so many biologically based cultural universals. For instance, while the specific everyday experiences of any given Mexican filmmaker might differ from another's, and the expression of those experiences might differ, too, both will feel pain, grief, happiness, anger, and sadness in neurobiologically the same way as do Page 24 → all the rest of us on the planet. For example, just because a macho man does not cry does not mean that he lacks the neurobiological capacity for sadness. Mexican filmmakers share a cognitive and emotive architecture that pertains to the species as a whole. At the same time, because each filmmaker is an individual with his or her own unique set of experiences in the world, each will express this cognitive and emotive universal endowment in a unique way. In infancy humans initiate a bodily exploratory learning that can, in a surprisingly short time, establish the foundations for that specifically human activity we identify as work: the transformation of image and imagination into something else, whether a drawing, a table, a novel, or a film. This ability rests on the development of several foundational capacities for planning and knowing causal and counterfactual links that exist within the natural and social worlds: once we recognize regularities in these worlds, we can make projections about what will happen, as in “A will be followed by B” (causality), and thus suppositions about what would have happened if things had been otherwise (counterfactuality), as in “If A had not happened, B would not have happened.” As our abilities to formulate or perceive relations of causality emerge, we automatically come to possess the capacity to perceive and formulate counterfactual hypotheses, arguments, and thoughts. These basic, innate mental mechanisms (causal, counterfactual, and probabilistic reasoning) firmly anchor our knowledge of the world. And, like people everywhere doing whatever sort of work, Mexican directors use them in making films. The aesthetic products that make up Mex-ciné are simply an extended, highly particularized formulation of counterfactuals and possibilities. They are stories representing chains of possible events, actions, and settings, which form the basis of all Mexican filmmakers’ imagining and planning. This use of causal, counterfactual, and probabilistic mechanisms in mapping and modifying our natural and social environments (the knowledge that a ball falls if dropped, say, or that a smile or a cry will change the action of another) comes to play centrally in a Mexican film director's sense of him- or herself as different from others and to ground his or her own capacities and abilities to make an object—a film—that adds something new to the world. While Mexican filmmakers share with the rest of humanity these evolved mechanisms and capacities for reason, emotion, imagination, perception, and the like, they choose to train this basic and shared equipment in\n\ndirected ways, namely, for imagining, crafting, and realizing unique, idiosyncratic products we shuffle under the umbrella “Mexican film,” or Mex-ciné. This Mexican filmmaking activity is simply one of many manifestations Page 25 → of what we do as humans generally. Our survival and evolution as a species spring from our day-to-day social, cooperative work in our purposeful and productive transformation of nature (which is both us and not us), a nature that, in turn, transforms us. This work fundamentally involves our capacity to imagine, to have an image in our minds first and foremost before acting, before setting out to choose (or create) the tools we will need to express this image in material form. In a capitalist socioeconomic planetary system, where the disparity between the haves and have-nots increases daily, work is turned into labor; that is, the creative and transformative powers of work become estranged, alienated, or barren. Work creates use-values (concrete, determinate products) and is qualitatively determined (an expenditure of human labor in a particular form and with a definite aim). But private ownership of the means of social production turns work into labor; it turns human, social creativity into profit for owners who hire and command workers and rule society. Labor creates exchange-value (the social relation between one commodity and any other commodity) and is measured only quantitatively (as the expenditure of simple human labor without consideration of skill or expertise acquired through training). Treated as labor, the different kinds of activity resulting in different kinds of commodities are reduced to a single common denominator, their identity as human labor in general. As for value, it represents the social average time required to produce a specific commodity. Mexican filmmakers working in a global capitalist socioeconomic system one way or another face this absolute opposition between work and labor. (For more on these issues, see Karl Marx's Capital, especially his discussion of work in chapter 7 of volume 1.) Yet Mexican filmmakers do work, not labor; they create something new in the world. Indeed, all that goes into making Mexican films—from the pen that drafts the script to the cameras, lenses, and lights that capture the shots—is simply a particularized manifestation of this uniquely universal human capacity. That is to say, at base, Mexican filmmakers are human. They are natural, biological beings who exist as social entities. They are part of nature, and through their social activity (filmmaking and otherwise) they reorganize everything and anything within nature to satisfy their natural, biological, and social needs. They metabolize the world out there in their reorganization of nature according to the laws (causal relations) operating in nature that we as a species began discovering and using to our advantage as early as the Paleolithic era, and perhaps before. Our accumulated knowledge of the inner workings of nature and society Page 26 → allows Mexican filmmakers to make choices and use devices in creating their individual, idiosyncratic, and particularized blueprints. Throughout this practical (transformative and productive) experience, Mexican filmmakers perform their work, imagining how to reorganize the building blocks of reality, whether Mexico City (Amores perros), Tapachula (Sin nombre), Quintana Roo (Sin dejar huella), Acapulco (Drama/Mex), or the Oaxacan coast (Y tu mamá también), and then using the techniques available to film in idiosyncratic ways to tell stories that engage us and in some cases even ask us to look once again at reality from a new angle of perception, emotion, and cognition. As social and biological subjects, then, Mexican filmmakers share with everyone else in the human species an evolution through self-generation, or autopoiesis. They are like all the rest of us, always already a part of nature, but a very peculiar one. Mexican filmmakers are both biological individuals and social creatures, born in a social environment where their senses and neurobiological equipment were trained and educated by parents, caregivers, extended family members, and others who attended to their needs in infancy and childhood. It is their Mexican social environment and existence (shaped first by family within a larger social tissue) that triggered and molded the functioning of all the faculties inscribed in their DNA, such as their capacities for thought, work, and language. We are all protagonists in this odyssey. And Mexican filmmakers choose to create filmic narratives that mark interesting moments in this journey: blueprints of human attachment (social) and the physical (natural world) that allow the filmgoer to consider new possibilities and prepare for new ways of being in the world the future might\n\ndemand. In this odyssey, which begins even before we are born, the senses undergo an education. Like most animals on earth, we have eyes, but ours are part of a highly complex perceptual system that is part of an astronomically more complex organ, the human brain. In addition we are the only part of nature that studies and knows (some of) the laws governing nature as a whole. So we have eyes and brains and an increasingly precise knowledge of the functioning of that segment of nature that we call biology and optics. Thanks to this knowledge, we have, for instance, given our eyes new possibilities, new functions, and new aesthetic and other needs in the wake of the invention of ever more powerful instruments, such as wide-angle and telephoto lenses, not to speak of recent three-dimensional (3D) and CG technology. Through our knowledge of nature—specifically, the part of nature studied by optics—we have given our eyes the capacity to see things far beyond that which biology itself allowed them. We have improved on biology. Page 27 → Mexican filmmakers work to make (Greek, poiein) stories to move audiences to feel and think in specifically directed ways. And, as was already mentioned, they can use any number of devices and technologies, genres and styles, to tell a near-limitless number of stories, as many as the human imagination can serve up. Like all of us, Mexican filmmakers, as they have lived their social lives, have learned to appreciate and reject all sorts of things, especially those most directly related to health, the preservation of their lives, the reproduction of the species, and the entertainment of individuals and groups. As a result they have also learned to ascribe a positive or a negative value to a series of things offered to the appreciation of their senses, which they accept or reject as beautiful or ugly, attractive or repulsive, tasty or disgusting. Through their social practice and social transformation of nature, they have learned to appreciate and enjoy, rejecting or accepting a certain number of things and events that today we include under the umbrella of “aesthetics,” conceived in a large, expansive way. This social activity we call aesthetics has its own forms of meaning and its own value orientations, ones distinct from other, more or less similar and related social practices, such as those known under the designations of “morality,” “manners,” “customs,” “personal hygiene,” “discriminating taste in food and wine,” “fashion,” “ceremony,” and “ritual.” In all these cases, what is attractive or repulsive, accepted or rejected, concerns seeing, tasting, smelling, hearing, and touching. Born and raised by families in Mexico, Mexican filmmakers acquire tastes that involve their total sensory system and its particularized education within a Mexican cultural, social, political, and historical context.\n\nDirector, Blueprint, and Audience Redux Mexican filmmaking should enjoy total aesthetic freedom in artistic matters. The prevailing rule should be that there must be no (other) rule, nothing telling Mexican filmmakers what they should do or not do or how they should do it or not do it. Invention and creativity must take place without hindrance, without moral or political precepts. What I identify as the aesthetic at work in Mex-ciné is at the same time a cognitive and emotional inclination or disposition and a specific social relation involving sensory systems and an embodied goal or intention. It is a special form of relating to our fellow humans through certain kinds of products of our work and a special form of relating to nature. Any given Mexican film's recipe or blueprint—the particular way a sequenced Page 28 → presentation of images portrays and builds characterizations and plots—is a set of instructions the filmmaker established with a view toward the consumption of his or her work by audiences. Such blueprints are thus realizations of the intentions or goals sought by the filmmakers. They further bring to bear, of course, the cognitive and emotional attitudes and talents of the filmmakers and, at the receiving end, their audiences.\n\nEarlier I briefly discussed how specific devices, structures, and concepts work in several filmic blueprints. To this I must more fully add the dimension of the mind/brain. This approach to Mexican films keeps centrally in mind that it is the director who disciplines his or her emotion and cognitive systems in the skillful creating of the blueprint (imagination plus the purposeful use of technique) to engage an ideal audience, which the director assumes shares basic sensory, emotive, and cognitive faculties. Such an approach, then, must include a sense of the way devices, tools, structures, and concepts interface with the mind/brain. Both making and viewing films involve capacities of the mind/brain, so that we must know a little about the operations of human minds/brains with respect to the creation and consumption of films if we are to determine whether a particular film adequately fulfills the intentions behind it. As I already mentioned, we can and should use advances in other fields to understand Mexican films better. That said, I would like to offer a proviso. In the study of the brain, and more generally neural mechanisms and their functions in human beings, the research applies to real human beings. So when talking about neuroscience as applied to Mex-ciné, I am talking about the neurological mechanisms only of real filmmakers and audiences. Put simply, while we are not typically aware of the fact (unless, say, a mic boom accidentally falls into the frame, as sometimes happens), for most scenes, including even the most intimate lovemaking scenes, there are usually dozens of people in the room besides the director, the DP, lighting techs, and so on. From director to DP to actors, the scene is constructed by real people in such a way as to direct a real audience's perceptual, emotive, and cognitive systems, but the scene is always and for all eternity a fictional construct. The findings of neuroscience apply to these filmmakers (and audiences), but not to the fictional lovers. So, while we experience any given Mexican film as a simulacrum of the real, it is carefully constructed to come off as such. Real people might play the roles of characters, but these entities are always and for all eternity ontologically fictional. As Kristin Thompson reminds us, “However much they may Page 29 → strike us as being like ‘real people,’ we can always trace that impression back to a set of specific, character-creating devices.”2 We can learn a lot from advances in cognitive science and neurobiology about the way filmic blueprints are put together and to what end. Yadin Dudai's continued work in neurocinematics reveals, for instance, that “brief shots (less than a few seconds) with more than four visual items will not be effective because they contain superfluous visual information.”3 That is, the number of visual items that we can “chunk” (process as wholes) included in such shots would exceed the capacity of our “visuospatial sketchpad[s].”4 If a filmmaker were to add information to such shots, he or she might consider using the audio channel, where “the phonological loop is not saturated.”5 We can learn much from neuroscience and physics (especially optics and acoustics) about the complex function of perception, which involves many regions of the brain, but it is not the same thing to view a film of a car chase and to experience a car chase outside the theater, where I realize that I have to move (or even jump) out of the way to avoid being run over. Our perceptual experience at the movies is a fact-fiction copresence. You feel as if you should get out of the way but know that you do not really have to move. Here, too, we have, on the one hand, an actual object and, on the other, a representation of that object, namely, the filmic representation of the object. The perception of the object differs from the perception of an image of the object. No matter how mimetic the images are, they are not reality; they are representations of reality. This is our minds/brains making distinctions between our perception concerning reality and the perception concerning an image of reality. A filmic image never gives us a straightforward perception. It is always a representation. Ira Konigsberg writes that “the images are an illusion and the viewing experience is…controlled.”6 A film is always a selection—and this even in the most mimetic, 3D images. Film narrative is a chunk of reality selected by the director, who reimagines and reorganizes it through the skillful use of device and structure. Directors decide what stories to tell and how to tell them, constantly choosing the fragments of reality that will appear onscreen because of the aesthetic choices they make. That is, they choose the images that will allow audiences to fill in the gaps both in the storytelling and among the images, namely, the illusory or fictional images they present. The choice of a deep focus or crane shot; of tracking or push-in/pull-out camera movement; of light or dark illumination; of circular, right-to-left, or left-to-right movement within the frame; of smash cuts, dissolves, or intercut editing techniques—all these in one way or another guide our attention in an Page 30 → immediate and controlled manner and, taken as a whole, allow us to generate meaning from a film's compositional interrelationships. The\n\npleasure this produces is why we're willing to cough up the cash to see a film. In La zona (2007) we see Rodrigo Plá's careful use of selecting in and selecting out information, as well as camera movement, to guide our attention and generate meaning. The film opens with one take that follows the movement of Alejandro (Daniel Tovar) as he drives an SUV. The camera follows the car as it slowly moves from right to left. The DP, Emiliano Villanueva, then has the camera pan up to an aerial shot of a gated community and follows a butterfly as it flies out of view (zapped, actually, by the electrified perimeter fence), which seems to be that of a surveillance camera, leaving a scene of concrete walls and barbed wire. At the film's end (eighty minutes later), this sequence recurs, though without the extradiegetic sound. Now the film includes only the diegetic sounds of birds, people moving boxes, and a kid blowing a whistle. From inside the car, we see the butterfly cross the windshield. Again the camera follows the car, but this time not in one take; instead several shots show the car entering from the right and then moving across the screen to the left. As Alejandro leaves the gated community, suddenly we see the car moving from left to right for the first time. To the extent that the previously mentioned convention of reserving left-to-right movement for protagonists is at work here, the car becomes a sort of moral compass. As the car enters the cemetery where he will bury Miguel (Alan Chávez), Alejandro enters the frame from left to right. The camera then frames him carrying Miguel's body from the left to the right of the screen.\n\nMind the Blueprint Blueprints provide the algorithms for the purposive use of devices, concepts, and coherent structures to make something to be consumed and perhaps even replicated postconsumption; blueprints show the components of a structure, but they don't indicate the way and order in which the structure is to be made. For film blueprints by or about Mexicans to work, they must contain relevant instructions but omit information that the filmmaker assumes will be filled in by his or her ideal audience. This implies a social relation wherein the filmmaker learns to create effective blueprints and the audiences learn to follow them (and how, when, and where to fill in the gaps) within constraints specific to the motion-photographic storytelling medium of film. The blueprint cues the audience to “grasp the narrative in certain ways,” as David Bordwell Page 31 → nicely sums up the matter in Poetics of Cinema.7 This active, purposeful engagement with a film requires our constant use of induction, deduction, and abduction (inferring certain sorts of causes from effects) precisely because we have to follow choices made and paths taken according to options predetermined by the film's blueprint. Keep in mind that even effective blueprints do not necessarily move all viewers in the same way. Bordwell states that “like all humans, filmmakers can't anticipate, let alone determine, all the effects that may arise from their endeavors,” so that “the viewer has a freedom to seize upon certain cues and not others, pull them into a range of projects, and use the film in ways that couldn't be foreseen by the filmmakers.”8 Determining how a blueprint can work differently for different audiences does not require much fieldwork in theaters. You can simply look at trailers for the same film targeting different audiences. Consider, for example, the U.S., Mexican, and European film trailers for El crimen del padre Amaro, which detect, distill, and reproduce entirely different meanings and moods. The U.S. trailer distills and reproduces only the sensations generated by witnessing a taboo romance; the shots selected establish Amaro (Gael García Bernal) as a priest (seen giving the holy sacrament of reconciliation, sitting in a confessional booth and saying “Tell me your sins”), who gives in to the temptation of the young and beautiful Amelia (seen disrobing and touching), as well as the tragic outcome: Ana Claudia Talancón as Amelia crying in deep anguish and the villagers throwing stones. The choral music (“Gloria” performed by the Mexfilm Orchestra and used as a leitmotiv in the film) functions as an extradiegetic audio bridge that glues together the disparate images. Drawn from a blueprint with a much wider scope, this distillation leads viewers to apprehend the film as concerning only two people and the test of their love and the love of God. In the Spanish (international) trailer, however, the distillation conveys a film that is hip (it uses an upbeat, pop-rock score as its extradiegetic audio bridge) and is about more than just two individuals. The images used include not only ones of Amaro, Amelia, and the church and its priests but also ones that convey corrupt political and religious institutions: narcotics traffic, the church, and building a hospital with laundered money. It ends with the biblical quotation “Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.” This distillation apprehends the film in a certain way and, in turn, shows how it is supposed to guide the audience's manner of apprehending it: as\n\na story that cuts through layers of our social tissue and in which all are involved. Same blueprint, different decodings, distillations, Page 32 → and reconstructions. The latter trailer, however, appears to more accurately reflect the blueprint and more successfully step into the shoes of the film's ideal audience.\n\nGap Filling Mexican film blueprints cue audiences to fill in gaps of action, behavior, time, and place. Just as the map is not the territory, so, too, is the blueprint not the real world. This does not mean we leave the real world behind. As we encounter the blueprint, we cross-check with the real world (e.g., with natural laws) to fill gaps through the processes of abduction, deduction, and induction. And as the filmic blueprint unfolds, we continue to modify the way we fill in the gaps of characters, time, and place. Kristin Thompson proposes that films “evoke background constructions that relate to 1) our relevant knowledge of the real world, 2) aesthetic conventions, and 3) and the practical purposes for which the film is made.”9 The more we watch the films of a director who uses similar techniques in all his or her films—the multiple films of Reygadas, for instance—the more we develop a competence in filling the gaps in that director's films. This describes the process by which critics ground their judgments when making remarks similar to the following one from "
