[End Page 83] [Begin Page 85]\n\nA camera and sometimes a tripod are the basic elements of over a hundred filmmakers, who have come to express their problems and those of Mexico with total freedom.\n\nThey are experimenting and are, in many cases, true masters.\n\nPrelude\n\nIndependent cinema in Mexico hardly existed before 1953, when a group, encouraged by Carlos Velo and Manuel Barbachano, produced the film Raíces [Roots], which was directed by Benito Alazraki.\n\nInspired by their success, in 1956 they filmed Torero [Bullfighter], which was directed by Carlos Velo.\n\nBy 1958, Giovanni Korporaal, a Dutchman residing in Mexico, filmed\n\nEl brazo fuerte [The Strong Arm], a political film which is a denunciation of caciquismo.\n\nSergio Véjar made his film Volantín [The Kite] in 1961. [End Page 85] [Begin Page 87]\n\nTHE S.T.P.C.'s I EXPERIMENTAL CINEMA COMPETITION 1965\n\nEverything seemed to suggest that a cinematographic movement, which would come to renew the already and forever starved Mexican cinema, was being conceived in Mexico: the I Experimental Cinema Competition was to be held, organized by the Section of Technicians and Manual Workers of the S.T.P.C.\n\nThe success was surprising, the audience and critics voiced warm praise and people talked familiarly of La fórmula secreta [The Secret Formula], Viento distante [Distant Wind], Tajimara, Un alma pura [A Pure Soul], Amelia, En este pueblo no hay ladrones [In This Town There Are No Thieves], and also of Juan José Gurrola, Alberto Isaac, Manuel Michel, Salomón Laiter, Ícaro Cisneros, Rubén Gámez and Juan Guerrero, among others.\n\nHowever, that sweet panorama disappeared as certain numbers of these makers entered the film industry, into which the majority became absorbed and were thus limited; other filmmakers were never heard of again.\n\nTHE S.T.P.C.'S II EXPERIMENTAL CINEMA COMPETITION\n\nIn 1967 the second competition of experimental cinema was held, organized again by the S.T.P.C.\n\nFor dubious reasons it was declared that no prizes were to be given, arguing that the quality had been below that of the first competition.\n\nThis action, and the fact that there were no further competitions, meant this attempt at renovation was tendentiously crushed, thus provoking logical frustration on the part of new filmmakers and indeed maintaining the stagnation of Mexican cinema.\n\nIt should be said that all the above-mentioned films were made in 35mm.
