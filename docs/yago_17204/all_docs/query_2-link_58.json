        "text": "Hasta el viento tiene miedo (1968)\n\nDirector: Carlos Enrique Taboada\n\nAs punishment, a group of girls must spend their vacations at the boarding school where they study. However, the ghost of a former student of the institution, Claudia, will begin to torment them.\n\nAlso the Director and a teacher, who hide a dark secret. In 2007 a remake of the film was made, which was also \"scary\"... But how bad it was.\n\nEl vampiro (1957)\n\nDirector: Fernando Méndez\n\nImpossible to leave out of the list this film starring Germán Robles (the Mexican Bela Lugosi). The plot of this horror film focuses on Martha, a woman who, on her trip to visit a sick aunt, comes across a box from Hungary.\n\nThis will be just the beginning of a nightmare starring real vampires (nothing like those of the forgettable Twilight saga).\n\nMás negro que la noche (1975)\n\nDirector: Carlos Enrique Taboada\n\nOfelia inherits an old house from her Aunt Susana (whom she hasn't seen for many years). The only condition that she asks for in her will is that she take care of Becker, a black cat that the old lady loved very much.\n\nThus, the girl and her three friends come to live in the mansion. Things get complicated when Becker turns up dead.\n\nEl escapulario (1968)\n\nDirector: Servando González\n\nA dying woman calls for the village priest and in her confession she declares that she has a miraculous scapular that protects the life of everyone who wears it. Supernatural phenomena in the middle of the revolutionary scene.\n\nEl libro de piedra (1968)\n\nDirector: Carlos Enrique Taboada\n\nJulia is hired by a father to serve as his daughter's new governess. As the days go by, the teacher realizes that the girl has very strange behaviors, the result of her friendship with Hugo, an imaginary boy\n\nLa llorona (1933)\n\nDirector: Ramón Peón\n\nThe most popular legend in Mexico could not be left out of this count of Mexican horror movies. There have been many films that have tried to adapt this story, however, the best version is this one, which takes place in three different times, ranging from the 17th to the 20th century, where a woman seeks revenge for death. of their children.\n\nVeneno para las hadas (1984)\n\nDirector: Carlos Enrique Taboada\n\nThe director's tetralogy closes with this film, Veneno para las hadas, about a relationship between two girls. One of them wants to be a witch and begins to perform spells that at first glance seem innocent.\n\nLittle by little, children's games begin to transform into true nightmares, reaching tragic consequences.\n\nSanta Sangre (1989)\n\nDirector: Alejandro Jodorowsky\n\nA man finds himself in a psychiatric hospital haunted by his past: a childhood in a circus, where his mother was the priestess of a sect known as Santa Sangre. One day, his father cuts off his wife's arms, bordered by fanaticism.\n\nNow this boy is turned into a man, who is reunited with his mother to be used to commit murder. We could question whether its genre is horror, however, we are convinced that many scenes you will not be able to get them out of your head for a long time.\n\nCronos (1993)\n\nDirector: Guillermo del Toro\n\nDelete\n\nA medieval alchemist invents a golden artifact inside which is an insect that feeds on blood, but also has the power to offer eternal youth.\n\nThis is how he begins a hunt that goes from 1535 to the 90s, in order to find this \"elixir of life\".\n\nLa tía Alejandra (1979)\n\nDirector: Arturo Ripstein\n\nAn infallible in the list with the best Mexican horror movies. An old woman goes to live in her nephew's house, where her wife and her young children also live.\n\nThings take a radical turn and take unexpected directions when Aunt Alejandra decides to teach the children witchcraft.\n\nAlucarda, la hija de las tinieblas (1977)\n\nAlucarda, la hija de las tinieblas (1977)\n\nDirector: Juan López Moctezuma\n\nParanormal and demonic situations are the common denominator in this film, which is inspired by the texts of the Marquis de Sade.\n\nThe story focuses on the life of Alucarda, a young woman who has lived her entire life in a convent, and Justine, whose realities are transformed when a group of gypsies crosses her path.\n\nEspiritismo (1962)\n\nDirector: Benito Alazraki\n\nMaría participates in a Ouija session in which she is warned of various misfortunes that her family will suffer. Things happen, which leads the woman to abandon herself in the world of the occult. Desperate, she decides to sell her soul to the devil, without imagining that the worst is yet to come.\n\nSobrenatural (1996)\n\nDirector: Daniel Gruener\n\nLuego de que Dolores (Susana Zabaleta) es testigo de un asesinato dentro del edificio donde vive, comienza a tener pesadillas recurrentes. Su esposo intenta tranquilizarla, sin embargo, los sueños son cada vez más vívidos.\n\nPor ello, decide acudir a una poderosa bruja, que le advierte que un peligro inminente está cada vez más cerca. Un filme del estilo de El bebé de Rosemary (con las debidas comparaciones, claro está).\n\nSomos lo que hay (2010)\n\nDirector: Jorge Michel Grau\n\nAfter the death of the father, a family will decide to continue with the rituals they had when the patriarch was alive: eating human flesh, while a dispute will begin to see who will take the place of leader of the dynasty.\n\nThe film was well received at festivals, to the extent that, in 2013, the story was taken up again to make a remake (not fortunate) in Hollywood.\n\nVUELVEN (2017)\n\nDir. Issa López.\n\nAfter achieving success with a couple of comedies within the national cinematography, Issa returned a couple of years ago with a horror film about a group of children who must not only survive their reality, but also an entourage of terrifying ghosts . It is worth mentioning that the film was praised by Stephen King himself.\n\nLa noche de los mil gatos (1972)\n\nDir. René Cardona Jr.\n\nHugo (Hugo Stiglitz) is a millionaire serial killer who seduces women to kill them and feed the hundreds of cats he keeps in a well with their meat. Things change when a girl manages to escape her clutches\n\nSanto contra las Momias de Guanajuato (1970)\n\nDirector: Federico Curiel\n\nAn old enemy of Santo decides to take revenge through the famous mummies, which come to life to terrorize the city. This is where the fighter enters the scene.\n\nAlthough he has many detractors, in much of his filmography, Santo must face enemies such as werewolves, vampire women, among many others. It is not terror as such, but the films are endowed with a certain mystery."
