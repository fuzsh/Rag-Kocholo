        "text": "What 16 personality type is Arturo Ripstein?\n\nArturo Ripstein, as an INTJ, tends to have the ability to grasp the broad picture, and confidence, they tend to start profitable firms. When making big life decisions, people of this kind are confident in their analytical ability. INTJs often enjoy working with complex problems that require innovative solutions. They make decisions based on strategy rather than chance, comparable to chess players. If the odd ones have left, expect these people to rush to the door. Others may dismiss them as dull and commonplace, yet they genuinely have an outstanding combination of wit and sarcasm. Masterminds may not be everyone's cup of tea, but they know how to charm. They would rather be accurate than popular. They know what they want and who they want to be with. It is more vital for them to maintain a small but significant group than a few superficial relationships. They don't mind dining at the same table as people from diverse backgrounds as long as there is mutual respect.\n\nWhich Enneagram Type is Arturo Ripstein?\n\nArturo Ripstein is an Enneagram Four personality type with a Five wing or 4w5. They are more introverted than the other 2-influenced types who also enjoy being alone. They have unique artistic interests that draw them towards avant-garde and eccentric arts as they represent deviance from what most people see on usually overrated mainstream platforms. However, their fifth wing may drive them to make a grand gesture to stand out among the crowd, or else they may feel unappreciated at all."
