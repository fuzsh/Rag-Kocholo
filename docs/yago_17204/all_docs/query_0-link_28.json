Written in Spanish, by a French author, and published in Paris, it was well-received. The title (Deceits of this world) relates to a well-established genre wherein literature and morality were intertwined. Loubayssin’s Spanish is impeccable. He writes with irony and wit. Also, it is delicately erotic, a feature that cannot be found in its Spanish counterparts, due to the repressive censorship in Spain at that time. The careful preparation of this virtually unknown text and the in-depth introduction make this a valuable contribution to Golden Age Hispanic studies. In Spanish.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nDe Weese, Pamela\n\n2013 0-7734-4521-8 340 pages\n\nLuis Goytisolo’s prize winning novel, Statue with Doves, first published in 1992, constitutes a reflection on the challenges of representing reality, especially given the sometimes arbitrary and random nature of what any given individual can come to know about himself and the world in his or her lifetime. And yet, what can be known, when considered as a cumulative, collective enterprise, with its varied context over time, may yield a more transcendent view for the individual, as it confirms our personal experiences, or causes us to challenge our questionable assumptions. The novel juxtaposes the perspectives of two real authors, separated by space and time, and yet connected by their quest to find a point of departure from which to apprehend what they can recognize to be true, and to represent it by whatever means available to them through their arsenal of observations, research, words, and thought. Within the frame of this novel, both consider the roles of genre, the narrator, and the reader as they reconsider the limits and possibilities of representation against the norms of their respective times.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nRobb, Anthony J.\n\n2010 0-7734-3833-5 224 pages\n\nThis book analyzes along thematic and stylistic lines, all the erotic poetry of the Costa Rican-Mexican avant-garde writer, Eunice Odio. To date, it is the only monographic study that specifically examines Odian erotic discourse through a confluence of closely imbricated parameters: Spanish American vanguard, feminine discourse and erotic literary theory. This book contains seven color photographs and six black and white photographs.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nAltisent, Marta E.\n\n2006 0-7734-5868-9 488 pages\n\nAs a liberating mode that challenged and transformed the traditional values of Spain in the 1970s, the wave of erotic fiction anticipated the cultural and political turnover that followed Franco’s death in 1975. However, this fictional mode did not always run parallel to the assimilation of democratic values; rather, it often served to expose the internal contradictions Spaniards faced in the private sphere as they embraced more egalitarian attitudes. High and low erotic genres became the imaginary/liberatory arena in which gender, sexual, social and cultural differences could be played out, subverted, reappropriated, and renegotiated without substantial political consequences, often disengaging desire from the commitment to progressive attitudes toward change.\n\nThis monograph does not try to encompass or rigidly define the vast realm of erotic fiction. Instead, it systematically evaluates the development of sexual and sentimental themes through a close historical and contextual study of more than 40 novels and short stories, which are linked by a number of love paradigms (adolescent love, jealousy, adultery, homosexual desire, women’s epistolary writing, etc.) and archetypes (don Juan, vampires). The book also delineates the role that these themes play in a type of fiction that exhibits elements of the Bildungsroman, the picaresque, the pastoral novel, the generational chronicle, the psychological novel, and tales of the fantastic.\n\nAn understanding of the symbolism, visual style, characters, motifs, and practices of sexual desire is key to a greater understanding of the social, religious, and existential themes present in the Spanish collective imaginary. This, in turn, allows for a revealing analysis of the evolution of eroticism vis-à-vis the democratic coming-of-age of contemporary Spain.\n\nPrice: $279.95\n\nRodríguez del Pino, Salvador\n\n1999 0-7734-8274-1 296 pages\n\nThis anthology features recent Mexican theater by several of the best contemporary playwrights, showcasing the eclecticism that characterizes recent theater. The volume includes brief biographies and interviews with each playwright.\n\nPrice: $199.95\n\nComprone, Raphael\n\n2008 0-7734-5016-5 304 pages\n\nThis study provides insights into the Latin American literary tradition by analyzing the diverse views of eminent and lesser known writers. The author’s use of critical theory—psychoanalysis, phenomenology, Bakhtin, Marx, postmodernism, and post-structuralism—enables scholars to link the study of world literature and contemporary trends in literary theory.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nNimetz, Michael\n\n1995 0-7734-8978-9 68 pages\n\nLeopoldo Alas (Clarín)'s A Hoax/Superchería, while modest in scope compared to his massive La Regenta, contains the density and rich complexity of a work of far greater length. It displays many elements of fin-de-siècle neuroticism -- sexual ambivalence and timidity, world-weariness, spiritualism, and the fragmented image of the female as mother, religious icon, and carnal threat. A Hoax might have been written yesterday, so astute is its psychological portrait of an intellectual's angst and alienation from the world at large and from the sources of his own affective being. It is also one of the most poetic short novels in Spanish, reverberating in the mind long after the actual text has been read.\n\nPrice: $79.95\n\nMatz, Maria R.\n\n2012 0-7734-2922-0 280 pages\n\nIn the films of Pedro Almodóvar one experiences a vivid representation of Spanish life. His films are discussed here in lieu of gender relations, power dynamics, Spanish cultural identity, and inter-textually with other directors such as Alfred Hitchcock. The essays are written in both English and Spanish. They try to bring together a broad variety of interpretations to his popular films. Many articles deal with issues of gender and representations of cultural iconography from Catholicism on love and death.\n\nThrough a variety of authors and angles, as well as in two languages, this volume opens new perspectives on the films of Pedro Almodóvar. This work portrays how Almodóvar reaches into Spanish history and utilizes social changes that followed the fall of Franco to form his aesthetic creations. The book links the transformations of Spanish society and that of the evolution, if not the maturity of the filmmaker as he observes a society that is finally free to be and become what it desires. Each chapter reveals how the audience can witness the auteur’s maturation at the same pace as that of the Spanish society. Just like Almodóvar’s films, often criticized for their complex plots, today’s Spain is a complex mosaics that is constantly evolving and adjusting to the world that surrounds it. If many questions about what defines and inspires the filmmaker’s personal vision of the world still remain, one thing is for sure: the Almodóvar phenomenon has established an international image of Spain that is open and yet traditional, vibrant, and dynamic.\n\nPrice: $199.95\n\nBoschetto-Sandoval, Sandra M.\n\n2004 0-7734-6395-X 240 pages\n\nThis thematic study is the only in-depth investigation into the fictional and testimonial literature of Amanda Labarca Hubertson, Chilean educator, reformer, and promoter of women’s rights. These imaginary writings include such little-known works as her semi-autobiographical novel, En tierras extrañas (1915), the short novel, La lámpara maravillosa (1921), the collection of short stories entitled “Cuentos a mi señor,” the testimonial Meditaciones and Meditaciones breves (1928-1931), and the “marginal” journal fragments, Desvelos en el alba (1945). A preliminary chapter also addresses the controversy surrounding her published literary thesis, La novela castellana de hoi [sic, 1906]. The study corrects some interpretive errors regarding earlier scholarship on Labarca’s perceived feminist writings by examining the sexual (gendered) complexities that imprint themselves in Labarca’s fictional work and literary criticism. While she may be criticized for omitting any materialist analysis of power, in her literature Labarca attempted to effect change in the social order by pointing out its contradictions. Paradoxically, a close reading of Labarca’s dangerously contradictory and yet amorous inner landscape recovers not only her desire to feminize patriarchal culture. It also uncovers a “more true self” struggling between “dispersion and continuity,” as she claimed throughout her extensive life and career.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nBartelt, Guillermo\n\n2022 1-4955-0992-3 166 pages\n\nUsing discourse analysis with a focus on literary style, Dr. Guillermo Bartelt offers an examination and discussion of N. Scott Momaday's literary works. \"The examination of literary style presents a unique opportunity for the interdisciplinary exploration of the intersection of language and culture.\" In the course of his discussion, Bartelt shows that, \"instead of deliberate obfuscation, of which Momaday has often been accused in the critical literature...[there is] a conscious decision on his part to offer an enhanced ability to present a native perspective.\"\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nCallan, Richard J.\n\n2003 0-7734-6673-8 188 pages\n\nThis monograph documents for the first time in publication the Guatemalan Nobel recipient’s intentional substratum of Hindu mythology. El Alhajadito is the dream of the god Vishnu creating our illusory world. The Asian identity of characters and incidents lies veiled in metaphorical language, but with knowledge of Hinduism the design emerges and the reader can perceive the Indian connection necessary for a cohesive understanding of this unusual work. Asian deities and beliefs then come to life in Asturias’s colorful metaphors, reflecting his conviction that mythology is the ancient literary means for expressing the doubts, desires, and conflicts of human experience. This monograph joins the few studies extant about this novel, and broadens the field that has only focused so far on the language. Indologists and others attracted to the religion of India will find their field unexpectedly serving as the basis of a novel epitomizing literary creativity.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nGiovenco, Sydney N.\n\n2006 0-7734-5764-X 168 pages\n\nÍndice para Hora de España I-XXII is the index for the twenty-three issues of Hora de España, a literary journal that circulated in Spain between January 1937 and October 1938. The Index is composed of two main parts: the Introduction and the Index. The Introduction includes an historical note about the journal and its founders, followed by seven major topics: Contributors to the Journal; Poetry; Poems by Miguel de Unamuno (1864-1936); Spanish American Writers; Book Reviews; European Writers; and Art and Theater. The Index has three hundred and forty-five entries (114 contributing writers). It has an alphabetical listing of authors who wrote for the journal; it contains analytical synopses of as many articles as were written in its twenty-three issues – briefs (containing information on the journal), poems, and articles written by the editorial staff are included. In 2005, a Foreword and a Commendatory Preface by Roma Hoff were included. A bibliography completes the Index.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nRuston, Sharon\n\n1999 0-7734-7999-6 276 pages\n\nThis collection of essays examines the preoccupation of Romantic writers and Romantic critics with the presence of ghosts in the text. Contributors refer to theories of intertextuality influence and allusion, authorial presence and absence, and anatomy literature. They confront the ‘spectres' of both artistic and critical precursors in new readings of Romantic texts. The volume also widens the field of critical work on the Romantics' haunting of later writers, demonstrating that romantic influence has reached across geographical and historical boundaries, examining the work of Henry James, William Rossetti, and the Dutch poet Willem Kloos. Contains illustrations by William Blake.\n\nPrice: $199.95\n\nPallady, Stephen\n\n1991 0-88946-227-5 183 pages\n\nStresses the various types of irony in the poetic works of José de Espronceda, whom many literary commentators regard as one of the most outstanding figures in nineteenth-century Spanish literature because he so completely represents all aspects of Romanticism. Explores Espronceda's poems, particularly the longer narrative ones, and the prominent role played by irony - a main feature of the literary temperament of the Romantic Generation.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nRamblado-Minero, María Cinta\n\n2002 0-7734-6864-1 232 pages\n\nThis book is the first to look at all Allende’s fictional narratives to date, from The House of the Spirits to Portrait in Sepia, from the point of view of autobiography studies, and the re-creation of self-identity that takes place throughout her works.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nRacz, Gregary J.\n\n2002 0-7734-6904-4 196 pages\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nOsorio, José Jesús\n\n2006 0-7734-5802-6 244 pages\n\nThis book focuses on the cultural and political conditions of Colombia in relationship with their most notorious poet in its history. The relationship between José Asunción Silva, the cultural institutions and the social and political environment at the end of the 19th century in Bogotá is the main interest of this book. The Colombian nation underwent great political and social changes at the end of the century. Silva lived in a narrow-minded society that achieved a short but very important period of peace. Critics from different perspectives, in many cases contradictious, bother Silva because of his novelty characteristics. Nonetheless, they do not take into consideration the sensible intellectual that cares about the social situation, the city and the country. Journal articles and chronics about the city written by Silva denote the conditions of the relationship established by the poet with the politicians, groups of writers and the city as generator of culture.\n\nThis book analyzes the poetic works of Silva, which deals with the topic of childhood, the poetry book Intimidades, and his first poem “The first communion”, written when he was ten years old. The reconstruction of Silva’s childhood by some of his friends is also analyzed. This late reconstruction of his infancy just serves to create an impression of a weird, uneasy being that does not fit according to Bogotá’s society of the epoch.\n\nLiterary anthologies such as Parnaso colombiano, La lira nueva y the Estudio preliminar written by Jose Maria Rivas Groot are also analyzed. The revolutionary ideas of Silva cause uneasiness and discrimination against him because they are far from the traditional norms imposed by the culture of the time. Silva does not accept that a poet has to be regulated by the catholic preceptors. This book considers that relationship of Silva with the letrados of the Regeneration group was uncomfortable.\n\nSilva was interested in the societal chronic and he thought journalism was an idoneous medium to express his ideas about the society and particularly the literature and culture in general. Silva creates turmoil for the way he carries himself, way of dressing, and gestures, which did not correspond with a man of the time. It is observed that Silva’s isolation did not happen due to the idiosyncrasy of his great talent but because of local circumstances created by critics who did not always carry them with honesty and fairness.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nCallan, Richard J.\n\n2000 0-7734-7687-3 184 pages\n\nThis is the first comprehensive study of the novel El obsceno pájaro de la noche from the perspective of Jung’s analytical psychology. Callan explores how Donoso utilized Jung’s material to create his own literary version of that psychology. The novel is a structure of carefully connected multi-level images which originate in the disturbed psyche of the protagonist and are shown to depict the Jungian concept of Individuation. Callan demonstrates that the imagery derives from alchemy’s prima materia, Mercurius, solutio. Sulphur/quicksilver, retort, Sol/Luna, and more, together with alchemical references to mythology – all is original criticism on the novel. The documentation also includes substantive material from the Hebrew Cabala and the Hindu Upanishads, parallel fields referred to by Jung and incorporated by Donoso.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nShen, Leah\n\n2022 1-4955-1029-8 484 pages\n\nFrom the Introduction: \"The project investigates a poetics of creative kong (emptiness) by studying the philosophical origins of the notion of emptiness in Indian Buddhism as well as its development in China from ancient times through the 17th century. I argue for the philosophical and religious significance of kong in the Chinese context as being open-minded, non-obsessive, and creative. The poetics and aesthetics of kong owes a significant debt to Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism. The senses of kong enabled the writers and artists of the late Ming and early Qing to link with the immanent vividness of the world, and to evoke their creativity in literary and artistic practices when they tried to establish a close relationship to nature, instead of interfering with it.\" (pg. 2)\n\n(Hardcover with color illustrations)\n\nPrice: $279.95\n\nLópez, Iraida\n\n2001 0-7734-7375-0 256 pages\n\nThis study focuses on the dieverse fiews on identity and cultural location inscribed in Latino/a autobiographical writings. Identities go beyond ethnic and national identity to become pluridimensional and postmodern. It contains close readings of seven Cuban-American, Puerto Rican, and Chicano/a contemporary autobiographies: Gustavo Pérez Firmat, Piri Thomas, Luis J. Rodríguez, Nicholasa Mohr, Gloria Anzaldúa, Norma Elia Cantú, and Judith Ortiz Cofer, in addition to a number of autobiographical essays.

The influence he received is discussed within the ideology and goals of the three degrees of Freemasonry: The Entered Neophyte, the Fellow Craft, and the Master MAson. The connections are presented on the basis of the maxim of Freemasonry: Freedom, Equality, and Fraternity.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nRomán-Lagunas, Jorge\n\n1994 0-7734-9082-5 364 pages\n\nThese essays are from the Primer Congreso Internacional de Literatura Centroamericana, held in Granada (Nicaragua) 24-26 February, 1993, under the auspices of the Instituto Nicaragüense de Cultura, and Florida State University. They cover many aspects of Central American literature, including indigenous cultures, colonial literature, examinations of fiction in Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, and feminist voices. Writers examined include Rigoberta Menchú, Rubén Darío, Ernesto Cardenal, Pablo Antonio Cuadra, Gioconda Belli, Roberto Sosa, Carmen Naranjo, Mario Roberto Morales, and more. In Spanish.\n\nPrice: $239.95\n\nSobejano-Moran, Antonio\n\n1993 0-7734-9298-4 129 pages\n\nThis study examines the cardinal points of Goytisolo's masterpiece, the tetralogy Antagonía, and explores his experimentation with multiple techniques. Following a postmodernist/poststructuralist approach, it focuses upon the metaphorical meaning of the labyrinthine structure. It analyzes the therapeutic qualities that the narrators-protagonists find in their experiences as writers, and also the roles played by various readers, be these real or fictitious. The study also examines Goytisolo's deft articulation of straightforward exposition with parody and his trenchant criticism of Catalan society.In Spanish. La emergencia de Luis Goytisolo como uno de los más destacados novelistas españoles de la actualidad se revela con la publicación de su tetralogía Antagonía, considera por muchos críticos como uno de los experimentos narrativos más importantes en la literatura española del siglo veinte. Antonio Sobejano-Morán estudia los puntos cardinales de la obra maestra de Luis Goytisolo y explora las múltiples técnicas narrativas que utiliza el autor. Partiendo de un enfoque postmodernista/poststructuralista, Sobejano se centra en el significado metafórico presente en la estructura laberíntica de la tetralogía. Acto seguido analiza, por un lado, las cualidades terapéuticas que los narradores-protagonistas encuentran en su experiencia como escritores, y, por otro lado, los papeles que juegan los diversos lectores, sean estos reales o ficticios. El estudio de Sobejano también analiza el uso de recursos como la ironía y la parodia con los que el autor realiza una incisiva crítica de la sociedad catalana.\n\nPrice: $139.95\n\nEstévez, Angel Luis\n\n2005 0-7734-6071-3 180 pages\n\nIn this study, the author suggests that the fantastic Dominican short story of the twentieth century does not fit into the model of the traditional fantastic. He explains the differences between the Marvelous Real and Magic Realism, and how the Fantastic differs from both of these modes of writing. His theoretical approach is principally based on the works of Tzvetan Todorov, Amaryll Beatrice Chanady, Rosemary Jackson, and Jaime Alazraki. The main analysis includes the works of four Dominican writers: Juan Bosch, Virgilio Díaz Grullón, José Alcántara Almánzar, and Diógenes Valdez. The analysis of fourteen short stories by these authors reveals that, in fact, the fantastic modality practiced today in the Dominican Republic, and elsewhere in Spanish America, does not fit into the model of conventional fantastic short story writing. The author’s analysis centers upon the intention with which these authors have written their stories and argues that the modern Dominican fantastic is no longer used to terrify the reader - hence its distinctiveness - but rather the fantastic is used as a vehicle to express the writers’ concern about the social, psychological, and political issues of their time.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nGonzález, Ester Gimbernat\n\n2002 0-7734-7023-9 252 pages\n\nPrice: $199.95\n\nArdavín, Carlos X.\n\n2006 0-7734-5790-9 372 pages\n\nThis book is an analysis of how several contemporary Spanish writers (Francisco Umbral, Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, Manuel Vicent and Félix de Azúa) view Spain’s transition to democracy in their novels. These authors and their texts offer alternative narratives of the transition that disrupt and contradict the complacent and monological version elaborated by post-Francoist historiography; a version that is, fundamentally, a mythical narrative construction. How does fiction contradict the myth of the democratic restoration? By using – and abusing – memory. In these novels, memory is used as an epistemic instrument to investigate the recent and unresolved political past of Spain, and rebuild a solid collective and personal identity.\n\nTaken together, the novels of this study suggest that there is a gap between memory and history, a sharp opposition between what the author refers to as a politics of forgetting promoted by the historians and politicians, and a poetics of memory fostered by the fiction writers, which establishes a dialogue with the transition’s history in order to apprehend its complexity through imagination.\n\nA more extensive and profound knowledge of Spanish literature related to the issue of the political transition will serve to understand this complex event (the transition to democracy), and the origins and developments of post-Franco’s Spanish culture and society.\n\nPrice: $239.95\n\nGathercole, Patricia M.\n\n1997 0-7734-8539-2 164 pages\n\nThis volume shows in more detail than ever before the fascinating portrayals of the landscape of nature on French codices from the Middle Ages. The illuminations, the text, and the folio borders often constitute a work of high quality. From an early stylized portrayal of natural phenomena, this work moves on to a more realistic portrayal as reality rather than tradition and authority prevail, showing the gradual development of early landscape painting. As well as benefiting the medieval scholar, this volume will also delight those who love the outdoors, and may serve in addition as a guide for the visitor to museums and galleries. It will be of interest to historians for its representation of the background for historical events, and to the literary scholar. It discusses subjects such as the painting of trees, mountains, flowers, seas, etc. The Arthurian manuscripts disclose a distinct beauty of scenery in their pictorial representations. Calendars associated with prayer books are especially valuable. With many photographs.\n\nPrice: $139.95\n\nGarza, Efraín E.\n\n2006 0-7734-5818-2 208 pages\n\nThis study reevaluates Gustavo Adolfo Béquer as a precursor of French Symbolism in Spain. Considering that French Symbolism flourished around 1885, this study invites Hispanics to reconsider currently accepted notions that presence of Symbolism in Hispanic writing came after 1870 and only from foreign literatures. This work explores current research indicating that some features in Béquer’s prose anticipate French Symbolism, being substantially identical to the movement without Béquer actually coming in contact with French writers.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nHall, John Mitchell\n\n2002 0-7734-6970-2 180 pages\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nWill, Frederic\n\n1993 0-7734-3038-5 212 pages\n\nThe first section of the book deals with the births of language and literature from consciousness, and the formation of literary history. Explores Husserl's mapping of the origins of language, and subsequent language theories in Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, and Heidegger. Section Two traces privileged Homeric shelters such as the bowers off the battle-line in the Iliad and hidden islands like Ogygia in the Odyssey. It tracks that same language-sheltering into several Biblical wombs -- Sarai's, Mary's or Jonah's whale's, and turns from these to language shelters constructed by Sappho for her passion, Saint Paul for inner salvation, and by the creator of the Bhagavad Gita. The final section looks at the intimate intermeshing of literature and music with the Zeitsgeist, and finally, locates the impulse to literature and all art in the pulse of biology.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nWyszynski, Matthew A.\n\n2009 0-7734-4704-0 184 pages\n\nTamayo y Baus’ (1829-1898) The Right Track (1862) is a product of the swirling social context of nineteenth-century Spain. This comedy is typical of the alta comedia [high comedy]: it is a didactic work that hopes to offer the bourgeois a model of virtue. As a genre, the high comedy supplanted the symbolism and declamation of romantic drama with a “realistic” portrayal of the moral dilemmas faced by the growing middle class. The climax and resolution of The Right Track unequivocally support the return advocated by Tamayo to virtue and to what he understood to be traditional Spanish values.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nLisboa, Maria Manuel\n\n1996 0-7734-8828-6 248 pages\n\nThis study examines the author's potentially radical understanding of an interaction between the sexes in the course of which a series of social conventions uncontested in 19th-century Brazil are brought into question. The first two chapters are devoted to an exposition of accepted critical interpretations of Machado's position regarding the notoriously difficult gender relations in his novels. The rest of the book offers an alternative interpretation of the nine novels from a feminist theoretical perspective which situates his writing as a radical revision of contemporary received wisdom on sexual roles, and as profoundly interventionistic in the sexual politics debate. It offers a detailed analysis of patterns of male and female discourse, the institutions of marriage and motherhood, widowhood, and relationships of solidarity between women. It develops themes toward an entirely new reading of these novels as constituting a body of writing participant in and sympathetic with the then-embryonic women's movement in Brazil.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nRogal, Samuel J.\n\n2014 0-7734-0083-4 180 pages\n\nThe principal purpose of the book concerns bringing into the public sphere knowledge of and insight into the relationships between the writer of popular short fiction and the magazine illustrator, whose work assisted readers in constructing a visualization of the story in popular American magazines of the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nPitruzzello, Rosy Maria\n\n2022 1-4955-0937-0 110 pages\n\nFrom the author's Abstract: \"This study of comparative literature focuses its attention on a selection of literary works written by two Sicilian female writers who lived between the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, maria Messina and Elvira Mancuso.\n\n\"...this book analyzes and describes the literary and existential voices of the two pro-femininst writers through their heroines and characters, who fought against or humbly accepted and surrendered to the patriarchal restrictions and chauvininst society they belonged to.

The poems in question are undoubtedly Yeats’ most critically evaluated and frequently anthologized poetic works, and are certainly among the most significant poems of the modernist era. This work will bring all this preceding scholarship together in a single source, as well as formulate what then ought to be a resulting interpretation of those richly complex (sometimes impenetrably so) and symbolic poems.\n\nPrice: $199.95\n\nBreining, Daniel\n\n2007 0-7734-5355-5 140 pages\n\nThe purpose of this annotated bibliography is to bring together under one title a diverse collection of works along with critical commentary that deal with the first centuries of colonial Mexican theater and drama. Shortly after the fall of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlán in 1521, the Spanish conquerors deemed it necessary to instruct the large indigenous populations and to quickly convert them to Catholicism. This task fell principally on the newly arrived religious orders, the first being the Franciscans who set foot in New Spain in 1523. Because of the linguistic barriers encountered by the clerics, there was a need to exemplify the Christian faith that did not rely so heavily on simple verbal instruction. Theater and dramatic performances proved to be the ideal format. The majority of the plays in this collection were written starting with the third decade of the sixteenth century and then concluding with pieces coming towards the end of the 1600s. Studies that center on these plays are mostly modern works stemming from the late 1800s and continue up to the publication of this bibliography. In addition to these dramatic works, the reader will find the more important and prevalent pre-Hispanic plays along with studies focusing on this native genre and the far reaching importance of theatrical performance to the Indian population of central Mexico prior to the arrival of the European. Along with native dramatic works propagating indigenous religious beliefs and the Christian plays of conversion, there are many ancillary studies that deal with performance practices and theatrical sites. One part of this category is the inclusion of works concerning the architectural properties of performance locales, and especially the open air chapel, which the early religious orders depended upon heavily and used extensively in central New Spain for conversional and didactic dramas. This annotated bibliography concludes with an extensive index allowing quick access to its contents further assisting the investigator in additional research.\n\nPrice: $139.95\n\nRobertson, G.

Leading painters of the day, like Nardo di Cione and Lorenzo Monaco, filled manuscripts and decorated altars with richly ornamented pictures that related directly to liturgical passages recited – and theological positions embraced – by members of the institution. In a city marked by wealthy and sophisticated ecclesiastical communities, the one at Santa Maria degli Angeli had few peers.\n\nDependent on the benefices of a powerful network of patronage, the monks in Santa Mara degli Angeli counted among their staunchest allies families associated with the most important political alliances in Florence, and by 1378 the monastery was considered by many to be closely linked to the city’s most potent families. Monks executed a variety of tasks and obligations which took place throughout the year. Among these was a lengthy and solemn procession, held on specific feast days, that took the community to every altar and altarpiece in the monastic complex. The route they took and the images they saw caused each participant to see his collection of images in sequence, and thus encouraged him to consider the altarpieces in his environment both individually and collectively. The culmination of this procession came to be the extraordinary high altarpiece produced by Lorenzo Monaco in 1413, the Coronation of the Virgin, which summarized both the entire program of monastic imagery in Santa Maria degli Angeli and the importance of individual patronage in Europe’s most progressive and potent city-state. This work examines and explains the appearance, function, and uses of painting in one of the day’s most important cultural centers.\n\nBecause of the size of the book and the large number of photographs, this book is priced at $399.95.\n\nPrice: $399.95\n\nFinnegan, Nuala\n\n2000 0-7734-7732-2 196 pages\n\nOne of the most unfathomable aspects of Castellanos’s work is the parade of female deformities within it, a record of the pain of women’s oppression in its diverse and varying forms, and the female body as a site of shame, disease, disfigurement and pain.

Based on the princeps edition (1801) and preceded by a lengthy introductory study, this critical annonated edition documents key aspects of Spain's controversial Age of Reason, particularly the uncertain shifts in ideas, and the peculiarities of Montengón's idiosyncratic philosophical system. Ramos-García's extensive archival research convincingly provides an expanded corpus of hundreds of endnotes - depicting historical and literary allusions - as well as identifying, correcting and translating numerous Latin epigraphs into the Spanish language. This is one of the most comprehensive assessments of a lesser-known Montengon work.

The analysis explains essentials illustrated in the poem for achieving nirvana and avoiding repeated reincarnation. For example, sakti is the feminine energy which creates mind, the body, and the world, three illusions of the feminine force who is in essence silent nirvana but sound and turmoil when, as maya, she creates the world (samsara). Sakti, personified in woman, appears to be the link in Paz's well-known triad of sexual love, the alien but fascinating \"other,\" and language, subjects in numerous poems, essays, and in \"Blanco.\" This yogic poem stresses that sakti's creation of mind as manifested in language (sound) must be withdrawn from phenomena, spiritualized, and directed to its nirvanic origin of silence. This book should appeal to those interested in Latin American literature, Asian thought, and the Eastern content in much of Paz's writings.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nChristie, C.

He also expressed a philosophical point of view which places man in a specific relationship with other men and with the universe as a whole. The novels show his attempt to integrate his socio-political and philosophical ideals. This study fills a gap in the critical bibliography of Sender - a gap which has been identified by a series of critics. This full appreciation of the writer's early works, seen as a whole, and the treatment they received after 1936 is essential to our understanding of a writer who is considered one of the most popular and important Spanish novelists of the twentieth century.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nDamian, Carol\n\n2005 0-7734-6217-1 164 pages\n\nThis volume traces in text and photographs the life and work of Peruvian folk artist Nicario Jiménez Quispe. One of Latin America's most renowned and original practitioners of this art form, Jiménez combines peasant traditions of his birthplace high in Peru's Central Andes with a keen eye and searching mind to create unique works of social and political as well as aesthetic impact. Jiménez expresses himself artistically through the creation of retablos, wooden boxes with colorful, complex and moving three-dimensional scenes portraying a variety of subjects that range from the daily lives and rituals of the Andean peasant to the political and social violence that has swept his home country of Peru over the past two decades. In some of his more recent work, Jiménez has also focused on social, political and cultural phenomena in North America with retablos that depict the human rights struggle in the United States and the plight of Hispanic immigrant who travel to El Norte. Examples of Jiménez's works may be found in the permanent collections of The Smithsonian Institution, the International Folklore Museum in Santa Fe, the Folk Art Museum in San Francisco and the Museum of Man in San Diego. In addition to illustrations of Jimenez's most important works, this volume contains interviews with the artist and essays by historians, art historians and anthropologists specializing in Latin America that describe his fascinating life's journey from Andean peasant to successful artist as well as evaluating the significance of his art.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nJaniga-Perkins, Constance G.\n\n2007 0-7734-5380-6 136 pages\n\nThis critical study examines various readings of Ramón Pané’s Relación acerca de las antigüedades de los indios (c. 1498), telling the story of the multiple layered readings of the 1974 version of the text put together by José Juan Arrom.

Chacel’s background in sculpture and painting gives this trilogy its unique perspective, while her experiences as a woman in the male dominated art world influence the structure of the novels.\n\nThe book gives an overview of the cultural context of the Generation of 1927, which illustrates the limitations confronted by a woman wishing to develop her artistic vocation. This is followed by a thorough review of the inter-relations between literature and the visual arts, as a preamble to the analysis of the uses of painting and sculpture in the novels.\n\nThe author studies the ways in which painting and sculpture become an integral part of the narrative at various levels, from the most superficial mention of a painting by Velázquez to the most complex coding of themes in the statue of Ariadne. There are some allusions to well-known paintings which are merely decorative in the narrative; but some iconographical elements become important tools in character development. The work of art can also introduce in the narrative encoded themes related to gender and vocation, becoming an important hermeneutic tool. This analysis of the various uses of visual arts in La Escuela de Platón reveals that the ekphrastic impulse is at the core of Chacel’s narrative.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nGuzmán, Lila Wells\n\n1993 0-7734-9360-3 488 pages\n\nGaldós's Episodes nacionales are the epic of modern Spain, describing the major events of 19th-century Spanish history from 1805 to 1870.

There is no other available edition of this novel. It is of particular interest not only because of its aesthetic qualities but also because it addresses issues of interest both for the period it was written and contemporary audiences. Among these topics are slavery, basic rights of the individual in society, nationalism, and women's issues. Another challenge for critics is the classification of the author, within the Latin American or Spanish canon, because she spent much of her life in Europe. Gómez de Avellaneda is currently attracting the attention of many scholars, and her novel Sab is considered basic reading for courses in Latin American literature in general and on women writers specifically.\n\nPrice: $199.95\n\nBird-Soto, Nancy\n\n2009 0-7734-4887-X 156 pages\n\nThis study analyzes the literary importance of the collection of stories entitled Sara la obrera (y otros cuentos) (1895) by Puerto Rican author Ana Roqué.

The narrative strategies used by Montero are placed in the context of the changing socio-political situation of women since the death of Franco. The study traces a trajectory from predominantly mimetic testimonial novels to an increased awareness of the possibilities of fantasy and the fantastic for identity politics, related to contemporary debates around the categories of equality and difference within Spanish feminism, using a multi-disciplinary approach. While particular attention is paid to sexuality and popular culture, the study also examines how the problematic relationship between feminist and postmodernist theorizing of identity and subjectivity is negotiated through Montero’s creative practice.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nHorne, Philip\n\n1996 0-7734-8745-X 220 pages\n\nSelene is quintessential court theater, written by a courtier, performed before courtiers, and depicting events at a fictitious court. This volume proposes that after 1546, when he entered the service of the Duke of Ferrara as Secretary, Giraldi the playwright had more practical and pressing concerns than the pursuit of literary fame. Charged with the organization of dramatic entertainment, his prime obligation was to devise lively theatrical spectacles for the enjoyment and edification of his peers at court, and he used the theater as an instrument of moral and religious persuasion and as a vehicle for dynastic propaganda. In 1546 Giampaolo Manfrone had been convicted of two assassination attempts against Duke Ercole; it was politically apt, therefore, that Giraldi's choice of plot for the cautionary drama Selene should have been the downfall of a power-hungry noble intent upon murdering his sovereign. The introduction discusses personal experiences and cultural influences at work in Selene. Chapter I examines Giraldi's exposé of court life written for the guidance of an aspiring young courtier and based on his knowledge of the Ferrarese court. Chapter II illustrates his close rapport, as dramatist, with the Duke. Chapter III sets the play in the context of the burgeoning contemporary literature concerning the excellence of women. The Notes to the play comment on its ideological content, resolve syntactical problems, and clarify the movements of the actors on stage. The Glossary lists all word-forms found in the text not represented in modern Italian.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nFriedman, Mary Lusky\n\n2004 0-7734-6419-0 150 pages\n\nJosé Donoso (1924-1996), the most celebrated fiction writer Chile has produced, created over a span of some fifty years, a large and remarkably various body of work. His ten novels, nine novellas and four volumes of tales take up many of the social and political questions of his day. Although each work probes a different social issue, each contains as well Donoso’s lifelong meditation on the nature of the self. “José Donoso’s Conjuring of the Self” explores this central theme in Donoso’s writings.\n\nThis study explores in rigorous detail José Donoso’s most important theme – the perils of establishing a self. Concentrating on the Chilean’s late writings -- The Garden Next Door, Curfew, “Taratuta,” Conjeturas sobre la memoria de mi tribu and Donde van a morir los elefantes, the author infers from these little studied narratives Donoso’s idiosyncratic views about selfhood. Donoso, who conceived of individual identity as compact of social role and intrapsychic form, fuses his social vision with psychoanalysis. The author points out that what permits Donoso to combine with seeming naturalness these two incongruent sets of ideas about the self is his stark ambivalence toward selfhood, understood in either way. Psychoanalytic theorist Melanie Klein, whose theories were in vogue in Chile as Donoso came of age, gives primacy to ambivalence, and the author is the first to suggest that Klein may have influenced Donoso. As the author traces Kleinian tendencies in Donoso’s work, she reveals how they inform a paradigmatic storyline that inheres in most Donosan texts. The author’s special access to the voluminous personal notes Donoso made as he wrote Curfew gives her special insight into the creative process of one of Latin America’s most brilliant novelists.\n\nPrice: $139.95\n\nAndré, María Claudia\n\n2006 0-7734-5620-1 244 pages\n\nThis anthology features a collection of translated plays by Argentine actress and playwright Susana Torres Molina.

He also wrote a considerable amount of prose which, despite the fact that it is beautifully poetic, is virtually unknown and untranslated. The Soul-Giver is a prose poem, a tale of deep love exploring male-female relationships in an atmosphere of mysticism, science fiction, and a hint of magical realism, anticipating some modern ideas in psychology. In his prose, Nervo was the forerunner of Latin American science fiction and one of the forerunners of magical realism.

Her theoretical approach is based on the Kafkian notion of “minor” literature, developed by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari (1986). The body of her analysis includes the works of the Puerto Rican authors Ana Lydia Vega and Carmen Lugo Filippi, the Dominican authors Aurora Arias and Ligia Minaya, and the Cuban authors Sonia Rivera-Valdés, Odette Alonso, Jacqueline Herranz Brooks, Manelic Ferret, Ena Lucía Portela, and Karla Suárez Rodríguez. The author concludes that through humor, parody, satire, the open treatment of themes traditionally considered taboo, variety of styles and the unrestricted use of a language that seizes the popular, the vulgar and the ordinary to represent the feminine universe, among other subversive strategies, these authors have created a voice of their own, different from the dominant male discourse. With their production the Hispanic Caribbean has an alternative to the phallocentric literature and has made significant gains toward the expansion of the canon.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nCabrera, Eduardo\n\n2009 0-7734-4869-1 212 pages\n\nThis work examines the hermeneutic work of theater directors as artists, a rarely considered aspect of contemporary theater in Argentina.

This historical and contemporary approach re-situates Juan Manuel studies in a European context and proves that the work was not produced in isolation, but influenced by theories that were debated and discussed in the universities all over the continent. Attention to the entire text as an articulation of a rhetoric of power relocates the text in the Spanish canon, not just as a collection of exemplary tales and proverbs, but as a tightly constructed and reasoned rhetoric of power. The investigations into the historical context of author and text expand scholarship on ideological notions as held by Juan Manuel about the role of nobility in society, the secularization of power, the clergy (especially the mendicant orders) in general and the Church specifically. Models are provided for readings of medieval texts as products of a concern with memory, expanding the ramifications of the ‘didactic’ label that is so often hung on medieval texts. Likewise, the study provides models of analysis for the production of authority, and the relation between form and meaning in the construction of a medieval text.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nShaughnessy, Lorna\n\n1995 0-7734-9012-4 312 pages\n\nThe study assesses the degree of thematic unity present in the complete poetic works of Pedro Salinas. The principal thematic thrust of his work is best captured by his own phrase la reconquista de la entereza del hombre. This quest for 'entereza', or wholeness, has emotional, ontological and linguistic resonances, and is evident in Salinas's poetic expression, as he subverts inherited semantic order built on Cartesian models. Accordingly, the categories of human experience traditionally regarded as antithetical are absorbed in his all-encompassing vision. Chapter titles point up the erosion of distinctions between such categories as abstract and concrete reality, the metaphysical and the physical, absence and presence, and the processes of accumulation and elimination. The critical emphasis given this poet's pre-1936 love poetry has overshadowed his public voice, and the predominantly social concerns of his later work. Whether as a theme or a linguistic aspiration the concept of 'entereza' represents an important unifying factor in his extensive and varied works.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nCoscio, Elizabeth A.\n\n2006 0-7734-5582-5 256 pages\n\nThe fiery Spanish liberal journalist Félix Mexía authored two dramas not previously analyzed: No hay union con los tiranos morirá quien lo pretenda o sea la muerte de Riego y España entre cadenas and La Fayette en Monte Vernon. Their analysis provides an understanding of Mexía’s political exile in the United States, employing the context of their historical setting. The application of new Romantic theory to his works published during his American exile due to censorship reveals his hidden political allegory.\n\nPolitical allegory mediated the return, not only to a chaotic nineteenth-century political period in Spain, but also to an idealized Spanish medieval felicity and to the heroic Greek and Roman Age by way of the American Revolution. Readers here have traditionally ignored the allegory by remaining on the historical surface of both plays. Mexía dedicated the first dramatic work as a historical tragedy to Guadalupe Victoria, the first president of Mexico, to elevate the martyr’s death of his Spanish hero, the revolutionary Rafael de Reigo y Nuñez, by detailing the final moments of Riego’s imprisonment. Writing La Fayette en Monte Vernon in the republican tradition of a Greco-Roman epic, Mexía refigured the Spanish guerilla fighter Francisco Javier Espoz y Mina as the patriot farmer George Washington. These dedications resulted from his denunciation of specific Spanish laws that shut down patriotic societies, disbanded the revolutionary national militia, and imprisoned popular heroes like Riego.\n\nWhile Benito Pérez Galdós used Mexía as a fictional fanatical caricature of a whole generation of liberals in El terror de 1824 of the Episodios nacionales, Mexía himself anticipated that usage of his persona fifty years earlier in the nineteenth century by entering his own performances as a fictional friend to his historical protagonist heroes, Riego in one drama and La Fayette in the other drama. Both dramas feature a romantic first: an allegorized female as a political constitution. These readings make public Mexía’s political issues mediated through allegorical syntagmatic historical correspondences, referencing back to his own particular exile identity in neoclassic political discourse, thus qualifying the two dramas as part of a transnational revolutionary utopist genre, but not Romantic theatre.\n\nPrice: $199.95\n\nDugo, Carmen Caro\n\n1995 0-7734-9015-9 284 pages\n\nThe study examines the strong degree to which contemporary Spanish playwright Antonio Buero Vallejo is influenced by Cervantes, in particular by the Don Quixote myth. Buero attaches great relevance to the power of madness and dreams, and makes use of what he regards as one of Cervantes' greatest achievements: the fusion of fantasy and reality.\n\nPrice: $199.95\n\nSchlig, Michael\n\n2004 0-7734-6190-6 180 pages\n\nMirrors that appear as motifs in the visual arts and literature abound throughout the history of all cultures of the world. Given its universality, the mirror often has served has a metaphor for introspection, self-contemplation and even autobiography, and has symbolized the structuring of works of fiction and drama. This study specifically examines the figurative mirrors that not only call attention to some aspect of the content of the work in which they appear, but also to the aesthetics with which that content is expressed. As such, it follows in the tradition of works such as M.H. Abrams's landmark study of the transition from Neoclassicism to Romanticism in England The Mirror and the Lamp and Marguerite Iknayan's The Concave Mirror: From Imitation to Expression in French Esthetic Theory: 1800–1830, but differs in that it seeks to incorporate theoretical and historical considerations of visual representation to the study of the mirror analogy in writing. Most importantly, and to the best of my knowledge, no such study exists that examines the mirror metaphor of representation in the literary tradition of Spain.\n\nWhile the mirror metaphor is such a commonplace throughout the centuries of artistic and literary aesthetics, surprisingly little more than the two above-mentioned studies exist that explore the motivations underlying use of the mirror analogy. This study incorporates contemporary theories of semiotics and reader response along with more eclectic and traditional approaches to aesthetics in order to address the theoretical implications raised by the appearance of the metaphor in evolving contexts (i.e., across artistic movements and periods). In light of this, the theoretical and comparative considerations throughout the study could also be of interest to scholars and students of French, English and comparative literatures in spite of the focus on the Spanish tradition.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nCourteau, Joanna\n\n1995 0-7734-9055-8 150 pages\n\nRosalía de Castro is today recognized as one of the outstanding writers of Spanish romanticism and as a pivotal figure in the Galician Nationalist Movement of the 19th century. This volume examines her contribution to the preservation and restoration of Galician language and culture by means of her poetry written in Galician and Castilian. It develops a theory of textuality based on the poem Negra Sombra. Strict philological analysis is combined with a deconstructive reading to the contexts in which the image of sombra is embedded throughout de Castro's poetry. This formulation of a poetic metatheory grounded in a poem written in Galician attests to the advanced level of development of the Galician language and its capacity to illuminate metapoetic discourse through the image of negra sombra.\n\nPrice: $139.95\n\nGonzalez-Moreno, Fernando\n\n2017 1-4955-0569-3 312 pages\n\nOne of main aims of Poe's narrative and poetry is to create powerful and suggesting pictures in the mind of the reader. Even more, Poe offers us an incredible visual richness, experimenting through all the main aesthetic categories, such as the Beautiful, the Sublime, the Picturesque, the Natural, the Artificial, the Grotesque, the Arabesque ... Elements that make is of his work an invitation for painters and artists to illustrate them, to transform them in powerful and suggesting pictures, such as the author that conceived them.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nCondé, Lisa Pauline\n\n1993 0-7734-9254-2 232 pages\n\nThis new annotated edition of the great Spanish writer Galdós' first staged play, Realidad, marks the centary of its début in 1892. The compromise to which the new dramatist was subjected in the creative process is traced through the text by reference to the four sets of manuscripts conserved in the Casa-Museo in Las Palmas. Much of the confusion and apparent contradiction found in the published text of this ambitious play is thus clarified, and its latent dimensions revealed.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nCondé, Lisa Pauline\n\n2000 0-7734-7525-7 208 pages\n\nIn this play, Galdós’s concept of ‘la mujer nueva’ is incarnated in his new heroine, Isidora, whose willpower or ‘womanpower’ he acknowledged as having been directly inspired by his leading lady, Maria Guerrero. For the feminist, the triumphant Isidora of Voluntad is one of Galdós’s more satisfying heroines, as traditional binary oppositions are broken down and the new woman is allowed to spread her wings and take control.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nCondé, Lisa Pauline\n\n1996 0-7734-8862-6 150 pages\n\nThis new annotated edition of Galdós's second staged play, La loca de la casa (1893), is the second in the series The Theatre of Galdós launched in 1992 to mark the centenary of this great writer's turn to the stage. All manuscripts, adaptaciones and reviews available in the Casa-Museo in Las Palmas and the Biblioteca Nacional in Madrid have been consulted in order to provide as informed an edition as possible. Issues of class and gender are of particular interest in La loca de la casa, where social classes clash and then fuse as the power of motherhood is exploited and arguably abused.\n\nPrice: $139.95\n\nTorres, Sixto E.\n\n1993 0-7734-9356-5 408 pages\n\nThis collection provides scholars and researchers unique access to valuable, but heretofore unpublished work by one of Spain's most talented contemporary playwrights of the Franco and post-Franco eras. Of particular importance is the inclusion of El Enemigo, a psychological drama written in 1943 to which many of the elements of his more mature theatre may be traced. The remaining plays written between 1982 and 1991 are crucial in helping us gain greater insight and appreciation for the development of his theatre during the first full decade of Democratic Spain. The prefatory study and introduction provide a solid framework, and the volume contains the most extensive critical bibliography on his theatre to date.\n\nPrice: $259.95\n\nBayó Belenguer, Susana\n\n2001 0-7734-7404-8 360 pages\n\nManuel Vázquez Montalbán is one of Spain’s more prolific, prominent, and controversial contemporary writers. His articles, poems, short stories, and novels have been acclaimed for their insightful view of a society which is recognized as a model for the transformation of opposing ideologies into a working relationship. His best know collection is the Carvalho series, stories about a private detective whose wit and irony reveal a state of affairs that many might wish hidden. Barcelona is an ideal setting for that conflict of the classes, political ideals which is at the heart of the author’s chronicle of the post-Civil War years and the Transition.\n\nPrice: $239.95\n\nToruño, Rhina\n\n1996 0-7734-4258-8 228 pages\n\nTopic headings include: Marco Teorico; Datos biograficos de Elena Garro; Felipe Angeles - El juicio de la revolucion Mexicana; Y matarazo no llamo - Diversos analisis de interpretacion de esa novela, considerada como un reflejo de la conciencia social de Mexico en la decada de los; Reencuintro de personajes - metaficcion e intertextualidad se dan cita; Conclusiones finales.

To accomplish this main objective, the volume offers a series of in-depth academic interviews with representatives of five generations of Chilean writers. These authors are: Volodia Teitelboim( b. 1916), Jorge Edwards (b. 1931), Poli Délano (b. 1936), Antonio Skármeta (b. 1940), Jaime Collyer (b. 1955), Ramón Díaz Eterovic (b. 1956), Alberto Fuguet (b. 1964), Andrea Jeftanovic (b. 1970), Alejandra Costamagna (b. 1970), Nona Fernández (b. 1971), and Roberto Fuentes (b. 1973). The writers presented in this work are the leaders of their literary generations and have acquired, or are acquiring, prominence in Chile and Latin America. Therefore, their novels, volumes of short stories, and essays are worthy of attention by an extensive reading community as these are the focal point of study in diverse academic centers in Latin America, the United States and Europe.

A brief biographical background focuses in particular on his relationships with women. The work proceeds with a story by story analysis of the female characters in Alarcón's largest collection, Cuentos amatorios, including his two best known stories, \"El clavo\" and \"La Comendadora\". It also covers stories from Historietas nacionales, and Narraciones inverosímiles. Chapter six examines three narratives that he excluded from his Obras completas. Their exclusion is based on the greater Romantic independence and subjectivity the young author allowed his female characters.\n\nPrice: $139.95"
