I am particularly appreciative of the early guidance provided by Vivian Sobchack, Teshome Gabriel, Peter Wollen, and James Goodwin, all of whom inspired my project with their insights and encouragement. A special note of gratitude goes to Vivian who helped shape the structure of the project at its foundational stages with her tireless editing and timely feedback. She has consistently offered the kind of professional support and personal care so essential to the advancement of my academic career. I would also like to thank Nick Browne and David E. James, important influences from UCLA and USC respectively. Richard Porton, Leonard Quart, David Gerstner, Philip Gentile, and Scott Dixon McDowell deserve recognition for their enthusiastic encouragement of my earlier academic endeavors, encouragement that helped propel me toward a doctoral degree in the first place. I am indebted to all of the archivists and librarians who assisted me throughout my research, in particular Rose-Marie Haynes at the Library of Congress (Washington, DC), Flavia Morabito at the Cineteca of the Scuola Nazionale di Cinema (Rome), and Ron Magliozzi and Charles Silver at the Film Study Center of the Museum of Modern Art (Queens, NY). Barbara Hall and her incredible staff at the Margaret Herrick Library (Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences) have been especially helpful during these past seven years, as have the many professionals at the UCLA Arts Library Special Collections, the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, and the National Archives and Records Administration at College Park, Maryland. The courteous staff at the UCLA Film and Television Archive enabled me to view many otherwise unavailable films in welcoming settings, and to them I owe a large debt of gratitude.

The expression “omnibus film” has been around for decades, and is still commonly used by producers and reviewers to refer to any multi-director feature in which several selfcontained episodes are presented to the viewer one after the other. But the term has also been deployed by critics with less concern for definitional specificity in their reviews of single-director episode films. Throughout this book I shall use the term to denote feature-length motion pictures showcasing the contributions of two or more directors (or, more accurately, two or more teams of filmmakers, including screenwriters, cinematographers, and other creative artists responsible for the content and form of their individual episodes). By calling omnibus films a kind of “transauthorial cinema,” I entertain the idea that cinematic authorship – a much-debated concept in film studies – is not only prone to change or revision but also subject to a kind of textual flux and inter-episodic flow which result from several authordirectors’ segments being combined as autonomous yet connected units in a single motion picture. Meaning “across,” “between,” and “through,” the prefix trans- tells us that an omnibus film is a motion picture containing both movement and borders, permeable though the latter might be. In fact, the permeability of those internal divisions is what facilitates transit from one episode to another, not only during the actual viewing of a film but also after that experience is officially over, when spectators have the opportunity to reflect back on a motion picture’s formal properties, narrative structure, and thematic motifs as a whole while “moving” themselves, mentally, back and forth across the boundaries separating the individual segments. As I will explain toward the end of this book, being “moved” (emotionally) is a form of spectatorial engagement that carries ethical implications, particularly when one is confronted with human rightsthemed omnibus films, such as If You Were Me (Yŏsŏtgae ŭi sisŏn, 2003), Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n4\n\no mnibus f il m s\n\nStories on Human Rights (2008), and Then and Now: Beyond Borders and Differences (2011), the last film an NGO-commissioned work whose title alone reminds us that the prefix trans- can take us “beyond” the aforementioned meanings to showcase similarities as well as differences in a given authorial assemblage (which, in the case of Then and Now, includes an international roster of filmmaking talent: Tata Amaral, from Brazil; Fanny Ardant, from France; Hüseyin Karabey, from Turkey; Masbedo, from Italy; Idrissa Ouédraogo, from Burkina Faso; Jafar Panahi, from Iran; and Robert Wilson, from the United States). Unlike other subcategories of episodic cinema (such as the anthology film and the compilation film), the omnibus film thus brings together not only two or more discrete episodes or narrative sketches but also two or more filmmakers who, in certain cases, may serve as national representatives, contributing short works to a larger whole that encompasses a range of directorial styles, performative modes, aesthetic sensibilities, and possibly genres. Consider, for example, Most People Live in China (Folk flest bor i Kina, 2002), a film that, despite its title, was produced in Norway as an opportunity to explore party politics following the country’s parliamentary elections in September 2001. The contributing directors of this omnibus production range across a variety of different professional backgrounds, and include well-known leaders in the Norwegian film and television industries, such as Hans Peter Moland and Thomas Robsahm, as well as individuals with little prior experience, such as debut director Arild Frölich and film school graduate Sara Johnson. Another, more telling example of transauthorship is The Wind Rose (Die Windrose, 1957), a five-episode omnibus film commissioned by the International Democratic Women’s Federation, supervised by Joris Ivens and Alberto Cavalcanti, and shot in five different countries (Brazil, China, France, Italy, and Russia) by filmmakers hailing from those countries (Alex Viany, Wu Kuo Yin, Yanick Bellon, Gillo Pontecorvo, and Sergei Gerassimov, respectively). Consider as well Paris, je t’aime (2006): Over the course of this omnibus film’s two-hour running time, spectators are not only confronted with a host of stories and characters but are also witness to a wide spectrum of cinematographic techniques, from the undercranking of German director Tom Tykwer’s hyperkinetic tale of a blind man’s (Melchior Belson) relationship with his actress girlfriend (Natalie Portman) to the single-shot long take of Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón’s “Parc Monceau” which steadily tracks the movement and conversation of a father (Nick Nolte) and his daughter (Ludivine Sagnier) as they walk down an avenue in the City of Lights’s 17th arrondissement. Significantly, film critic Mick LaSalle, in his review of the eighteenNot for distribution or resale.

As I hope to show, however, there is a fullness to the omnibus film viewing experience, despite the form’s propensity to spread narrative thin, across a range of scenarios that might have few overt connections to one another. As LaSalle states, viewers of Paris, je t’aime get “the sense of having seen a panorama of human experience, of having witnessed a moment of time in all its true fullness” – something alluded to in the “bulging” titles of certain omnibus films, such as O. Henry’s FULL House (1952), ENORMOUS Changes at the Last Minute (1983), and ALL the Invisible Children (2005).2\n\nMinding the Gap As someone who has studied, taught, and written about film criticism, history, and theory for over a decade, I find it remarkable that few scholars have attempted to conceptualize and contextualize omnibus films, which number in the hundreds and span the breadth of motion-picture history. This omission is made even more extraordinary by the continued production and proliferation of internationally distributed, multi-director motion pictures over the past ten years alone. Besides filling a gap in film history, recuperating heretofore overlooked motion pictures, this study seeks to make a theoretical intervention in questions related to authorship, genre, and nationhood while expanding the critical language through which to analyze episodic cinema. Prior to this book, the most sustained treatment of episode films could be found in Michael Steven Sinclair’s PhD dissertation, Molti-Story Cinema: The Episode Film in the Italian Cinema. Completed in 2004, Sinclair’s wide-ranging, in-depth study of il film ad episodi focuses primarily on single-director productions, such as Roberto Rossellini’s Paisà (1945), Pier Paolo Pasolini’s The Decameron (Il Decameron, 1971), and Michelangelo Antonioni’s Beyond the Clouds (Al di là delle nuvole, 1995). Because of this, as well as its emphasis on a single national film culture, Sinclair’s work differs considerably from my own study. Moreover, Not for distribution or resale.

Despite the differences between our studies, I feel compelled to tease out the implications of Sinclair’s statement that “filmmakers who often utilized or contributed to the episode film form clearly must have had aesthetic and/or ideological reasons for doing so.”3 I also hope to build upon Mark Betz’s trailblazing work on omnibus films, included as a lengthy section in his recent publication Beyond the Subtitle: Remapping European Art Cinema. Betz’s book contains a chapter entitled “Exquisite Corpses: Art Cinema, Film Criticism, and the Omnibus Film” as well as an accompanying filmography that is exceptionally thorough.4 Though principally limited to European multi-director films of the 1950s and 1960s, Betz’s study provides an admirable and necessary first step in shaping broader considerations of the genre. His preliminary questions about the status of episode films in general, as well as his long list of omnibus productions, have helped to sketch some of the terrain that I shall map out in a more thematically comprehensive, historically grounded, and transculturally adventurous manner. Of the major film theorists and historians – those whose combined writings constitute the canon of cinema studies – only Siegfried Kracauer offers more than a fleeting glimpse of what he describes as films that are themselves “collection[s] of independent little movies.” Unfortunately, the eleven pages in Theory of Film that Kracauer devotes to works that are either “monadic” (meaning: resistive to further division, as with a short subject, or composed of numerous cellular units) or simply “porous” (that is, “full of gaps into which environmental life may stream”) add little to our understanding of episodic cinema’s various permutations. While his mobilization of concepts such as “permeability,” “self-containment,” and “framing” point toward a more supple exploration, his brief mention of omnibus-style pictures is brusquely dismissive: In order . . . to profit by this – effective and cinematic – story form, the film industry has fallen on the device of assembling, anthology fashion, several short units under a common heading . . . Le Plaisir and Encore are nothing but mechanical packages of self-sufficient episodes. True, all the episodes are adapted from Maupassant and Maugham respectively, but this does not confer on either package a semblance of unity.5\n\nNot for distribution or resale.

But they have frequently been used by non-academic reviewers as opportunities to rethink or call into question some of the fundamental principles within film studies. Again, for the sake of clarification: an episode film is a featurelength motion picture composed of two or more autonomous segments that might share thematic and/or stylistic elements. As will be discussed more thoroughly in subsequent chapters, critics have often mobilized various terms interchangeably in their discussions and analyses of episode films, regardless of the number of directors involved. For example, in his 1953 review of the seven-episode Italian anthology Times Gone By (Altri tempi, 1952), Parker Tyler describes director Alessandro Blasetti’s unusual amalgam of marquee stars (including Gina Lollobrigida, Vittorio De Sica, and Aldo Fabrizi) and genre elements (such as courtroom comedy, vacation romance, and literary adaptation) as a charmingly conceived “potpourri.”6 An anonymous critic at Cue magazine uses the words “omnibus,” “collection,” “compilation,” and “skit, sketch, comic and dramatic compote” in his assessment of the same film.7 Though the reviewer feels that Times Gone By, like most episode films, offers “something for everybody” (including “sweet romance, slapstick, strong drama, bedroom farce, satire, melody”), one senses in the critic’s spasmodic search for terminological certainty an underlying uncertainty about what constitutes the various phrases and concepts that are freely substituted one for the other. Compounding the difficulties involved in categorizing it, the film itself includes a dialogue-free intermission between the fifth and sixth episodes entitled “Potpourri of Songs,” in which a young man courts a female companion to the tunes of “Un Peu d’amour,” “Valse bleue,” and “Baciami, Baciami.” Unlike the lyrical interlude that comes two-thirds of the way through another single-director episode film, The Little Theater of Jean Renoir (Le Petit Théâtre de Jean Renoir, 1969), a tribute to the belle époque titled “When Love Dies” and sung by Jeanne Moreau, the intermission in Blasetti’s film betrays its own discursiveness, its own internal episodicity. As a “potpourri” or combination of incongruous things, the film gestures toward the offscreen presence of the eleven screenwriters who were responsible for much of this categorical uncertainty. Just as Renoir’s Little Theater – a trio of sketches written, produced, and directed for television by the famous French septuagenarian – is rooted in various traditions (opera, literature, theater, and popular music) and is what Stanley Kauffmann once called a “bundle of reminiscences,”8 so too does Times Not for distribution or resale.

The frame narrative (or wraparound story) of Times Gone By involves a busybody bookseller, played by Aldo Fabrizi, who leafs through a volume of tales, each of which is set at the turn of the century. Every page he turns generates a new episode, launching the spectator back in time to bygone days of the man’s youth. Though the reviewer Ruth Waterbury, writing for the L.A. Examiner, feels that the episodes comprising Times Gone By “are infinitely better tied together than the various collections of Maugham stories that England sent over here” (a reference to the films Quartet [1948], Trio [1950], and Encore [1952]),9 this bibliophilic link between the bookseller and the otherwise disparate fragments that make up his nostalgic reminiscences only further complicates our quest to set definitional parameters on a meta-genre that is equally beholden to, among other things, vaudevillian and literary sources, thus collapsing distinctions between presentation and representation, between stage and page. Waterbury even uses the term “novella” to describe each of the short stories within Times Gone By, once again illustrating the cross-media maneuvers necessary to gain an understanding of films that are unique in the history of cinema yet redolent of other types of cultural production. Another episodic work released in 1952, the Franco-Italian coproduction Adorable Creatures (Adorables créatures), besides being referred to as a “vulgar film” and a “nasty anthology” by several French critics at the time of its theatrical release, generated comparisons with earlier forms of popular entertainment. Certain writers pointed out the ways in which Adorable Creatures – as a collection of four disparate tales sutured together by the sardonic, offscreen commentary of narrator Claude Dauphin – borrowed from vaudeville, the music hall, and the grandes revues.10 Other critics opted for a description of the film as a “cavalcade.”11 In groping for suitable, yet suggestive, metaphors for anthology, omnibus, portmanteau, and sketch films, in attempting to bring epistemological clarity to these overlapping categories of cultural production, critics have been forced to create neologisms and portmanteau words along the way. The episodes in such films have been called everything from “cinemanecdotes” to “dramettes.” Kauffmann, writing about The Little Theater of Jean Renoir in an article for The New Republic, refers to its three episodes as “playlets,” a term that had occasionally been deployed in earlier critical language to denote short narratives that, if not stagebound, nevertheless evince a strong theatrical disposition, something to which the title of Renoir’s swansong directly alludes.12 Not for distribution or resale.

Though I shall do much the same thing in subsequent sections, the first two chapters concern themselves primarily with two modes of address – the presentational and the representational – whose distinct characteristics in the context of cinematic narration are often consolidated via the episode film’s ontological bivalency and regulated variety. After sketching out some of the forerunners of episodic cinema, such as vaudeville, music hall, burlesque, and revue as well as the short-story cycle, I ruminate on the “episoding conventions” that are at once unique to this form of storytelling yet reminiscent of other types of cultural production. This sets the stage for my eventual discussion of Quartet, Trio, and Encore in Chapter 6, three adaptations of W. Somerset Maugham’s literary work that foreground the commensurability between episodic storytelling and the physical circumscription of objects within collections. This emphasis on the episode film’s status as a collection as well as its cross-media connections (as a variety-based form of entertainment sometimes blessed with a literary pedigree) thus lays conceptual groundwork for the rest of the book’s chapters, including my analysis of what is perhaps the single most significant example of this meta-genre in the Englishspeaking world: the aforementioned British adaptation of Maugham’s tales, Quartet. Besides spawning two sequels (Trio and Encore), this otherwise unassuming omnibus film – directed by Ken Annakin, Arthur Crabtree, Harold French, and Ralph Smart, and featuring the author himself as a prolocutor presiding over the cinematic retelling of four of his stories – was largely responsible for unleashing a spate of similar multistory films from both sides of the Atlantic. As a work which foregrounds the processes and performative trademarks of storytelling, Quartet is at once representative and exceptional in the history of episodic cinema. Ostensibly a “conservative” collection of adapted stories bearing little resemblance to their pricklier originals, the film nevertheless reveals the polyvocal and dialogic appeals of cinematic episodicity through the combined presence of a book (whose pages are turned to reveal new episodes) and an author (who directs his comments to the camera and injects an air of authenticity into the proceedings). Before delving into that and other important case studies, however, it will be useful to lay out some of the pertinent terminological and critical coordinates of this endeavor, broadly contextualizing various patterns and movements of episodic cinema at its embryonic stages, vis-à-vis the fin de siècle fascination with vaudeville and Not for distribution or resale.

While there are numerous instances of categorical overlap or contingency, as when particular films display structural characteristics identified with more than one group, the subtle distinctions between these often conflated terms can be confronted once we recognize that their etymological foundations are the seeds from which new definitions might grow – definitions, I might add, that do not always coincide with those circulating in common parlance. The first question to be addressed is rudimentary yet necessary: What is an episode? The straightforward, unequivocal nature of that question masks what is in fact a host of ambiguities. It is not for lack of use that the term “episode” remains ambiguous, for it crosses periods, cultures, and disciplines, popping up in the vocabulary of novelists, playwrights, poets, and filmmakers.13 An Episode of Napoleon’s War with Spain (Episodio della guerra Napoleonica in Spagna, 1909) is one of the first films to feature the word in its title. This Italian one-reeler was released the same year as D. W. Griffith’s Pippa Passes which, besides being the first truly episodic film (one composed of separate stories), has the distinction of being the inspiration for the New York Times’s first film review. There have been Austrian, Canadian, Danish, and Norwegian feature-length films simply titled Episode. Besides those non-episodic works, there have even been a few anthology, omnibus, portmanteau, and sketch films that call direct attention to their episodicity, including the Canadian production Mania: Episodes in Terror (1986) and the South Korean production Action Episodes (Hwalgŭk daesa, 1971). This latter film not only self-reflexively alludes to its own internal multiplicity but also links that supposedly “small” narrative unit to an outsized form of masculinity (indeed, all three stories comprising this action film are about men thrust into difficult situations, from Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n­\n\n“ b e ginnings witho ut e n ds ” 11\n\nhunting an enemy and tracking down a cache of gold bars to seducing the president’s wife and sacrificing one’s life for the nation), thus highlighting the miniature/gigantic dialectic so intrinsic to this meta-genre. Often imprecisely spoken of as a digressive subdivision in a continuous composition, an episode is referred to in this book as an individual, coherent story, vignette, or sustained narrative event in itself. The term grows from the Greek epeisodion, meaning “coming in beside” as well as “parenthetic story.” It is precisely these not-strictly metaphoric parentheses – ­typographical trademarks rendered as narrative “frames” bracketing episodes – that provide the skeleton on which to hang the skin of the episodic film, thus imparting a palpable sense of the sequential, the segmented, and the sequestered. These narratological attributes, which fall under the general heading of seriality, are indelibly stamped on all episode films, regardless of the number of directors involved, and significantly shift these films’ syntactical alignments from a mode of continuous engagement with a single subject to a more fluctuating set of spectatorial appeals. From this working definition, we can assume not only that the term “episodic” refers to any text composed of a series of separate, loosely connected (or unconnected) stories following one after the other, but also that serially organized films featuring discretely demarcated narrative zones differ significantly from chronologically scrambled, spatially fragmented, often non-linear ensemble films employing what might be called a “braided” storytelling structure in which multiple plot lines dovetail and diverge.14 D. W. Griffith’s Intolerance (1916) is the earliest example of this last type of film, with more recent, less historically expansive examples including Edward Yang’s The Terrorizer (Kongbu fenzi, 1986), Cameron Crowe’s Singles (1992), Robert Altman’s Short Cuts (1993), Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction (1994), Wong Kar-wai’s Fallen Angels (Duoluo tianshi, 1995), Goran Paskaljevic’s Cabaret Balkan (Bure Baruta, 1998), P. T. Anderson’s Magnolia (1999), Michael Haneke’s Code Unknown (Code inconnu, 2000), and Barbara Albert’s Free Radicals (Böse Zellen, 2003).15 Though fascinating from a narratological standpoint, and crucial to developing a comprehensive understanding of multi-story cinema, the “braided” film (distinguished by its dense interweaving of narrative threads) will not be investigated in this book, simply because, given my immediate interest in episodicity and seriality, these films do not fall squarely within my critical playing field. That is, they do not adhere as strictly to what social theorist Erving Goffman calls the “episoding conventions” of both everyday life and cultural productions such as musical revues, stage plays and paintings (which, like representative omnibus films Quartet and Boccaccio ’70 [1962], often rely on act curtains and/or external frames to designate boundaries). Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n12\n\no mnibus f il m s\n\nNor will I devote pages to what might be called picaresque films, such as Alfred Hitchcock’s The 39 Steps (1935), Alain Tanner’s Messidor (1979), and Agnes Varda’s Vagabond (1985). I do not dispute the fact that these cinematic descendants of Cervantes’s Don Quixote comprise a quasiepisodic variety whose overriding narrative trajectory is shaped by a protagonist’s pit-stop-peppered land journey. One need only consider Peter Jackson’s mammoth “road movie” The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001). Writing about this film, David Denby states, It’s in the DNA of quest movies, I suppose, to be episodic: Frodo and his companions rush to get somewhere or other until they run into a fearsome obstacle or firebreathing danger, which they overcome, escaping at the last second, and the quest then moves onto new turf, where the group faces new perils and thrills.16\n\nSimilarly, Hitchcock saw his 1935 British production The 39 Steps as “a film of episodes,” stating in his interview with François Truffaut, “As soon as we were through with one episode, I remember saying, ‘Here we need a good short story.’ I made sure the content of every scene was very solid, so that each one would be a little film in itself” [emphasis added].17 Hitchcock’s remarks notwithstanding, while each stopover in the road movie or picaresque offers new, offbeat characters for the deracinated protagonist to interact with as well as different dramatic goals to be surmounted, the fluidity of the form as well as the steady, forward march of the diegesis cannot be completely reconciled within the framework of narrative seriality, and thus falls outside the purview of this book. The focus of this book, then, is on feature-length films that are individually composed of two or more tales, vignettes, or segments that have been contributed by different filmmakers. Thus, while I foreground seriality as a fundamental element, film serials and series will not be discussed, given the different experiential relationships such texts engender. Whereas an audience typically watches a feature-length episode film in a single sitting, a serial requires a much longer mode of engagement, one that might be spread out over several days or weeks. Moreover, unlike most episode films, the serial adheres to one particular plot line or narrative arc, however splintered it may be by cliff-hangers – open-ended climaxes that, according to William C. Cline, make the serial “vastly more like life than any other type of storytelling.” Despite their structural differences, therefore, I should like to retain Cline’s notion that “life is episodic, without clear-cut beginnings and endings – except for the initial beginning and the ultimate end.”18 Perhaps one reason that omnibus films and other subcategories of episodic cinema are so often marked as “other” is that they are too uncannily or uncomfortably familiar to viewers whose Not for distribution or resale.

Like a serial, a film series features the same character or group of characters throughout. Examples include MGM’s “Thin Man” and “Andy Hardy” series of the 1930s and 1940s, and, more recently, George Lucas’s six-film Star Wars franchise (which has done more to popularize the term “episode” than any other cultural production in history). Yet the series is different from the serial insofar as it consists of a succession of usually feature-length films, each one whole and complete in itself. There have been, in recent years, “omnibus film series,” such as “Momentous Events: Russia in the 1990s” and “2000 As Seen By . . .” The former project, initiated during a period of political transition and social as well as industrial transformation in the former Soviet Union, is made up of sixty-minute contributions from a half-dozen directors: Peter Bogdanovich, Federico Fellini, Jean-Luc Godard, Werner Herzog, Nobuhiko Ohbayashi, and Ken Russell. The latter project consists of eight feature-length films directed by some of the world’s brightest talents (Miguel Albaladejo, Alain Berliner, Laurent Cantent, Ildiko Enyedi, Hal Hartley, Walter Salles, Abderrahmane Sissako, and Tsai Ming-liang), each concerning the anxiety that accompanies the arrival of the new millennium in places as far-flung as Mali, Hungary, and Taiwan. Such apprehension about future “momentous events” relates to the way that spectators might experience a degree of unease in their viewing of multi-episode films, which are in many ways about impending narratives that habitually shift the viewer from one setting to another in a serial fashion. Having hinted that seriality is one of the overriding characteristics of episode films, I wish to begin unpacking this meta-genre’s puzzling particularities. The terms “anthology,” “omnibus,” “portmanteau,” and “sketch” (along with near synonyms “compendium,” “compilation,” “composite,” “novella,” and “package”) are frequently employed arbitrarily and interchangeably, a trend I hope to at least partially reverse. According to Merriam-Webster’s, “anthology” is defined as a collection of selected literary pieces (such as poems, short stories, or plays), works of visual art, or music. Spawning this definition is the etymological root of the word – a Latin and Greek fusion (anthos + logia) meaning “flower-gathering.” The term therefore insinuates the utopian ideal of bringing together disparate yet similar items into a kind of fragrant bouquet. Though often utilized in literary studies to denote a collection of several authors’ works (as in, for example, The Norton Anthology of English Literature), “anthology” will be shaded with a slightly different meaning in this book. Harking back to its original definition (“flower-gathering”), Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n14\n\no mnibus f il m s\n\nmy use of the term speaks to the nature of a more “personal” mode of accumulation and display, the centripetal drive to unite elements and the centrifugal splitting of the self specific to single-director episode films. It might be helpful, then, to think of the omnibus as a collective (made up of many directors) and the anthology as a collection (made up of many stories yet helmed by a single director). Such delineations might be unnecessary or even confusing, especially since omnibus films, when subjected to the materialist metaphors that I will employ throughout this book, can be seen as assemblies of narrative “objects” (rather than people) arranged in ways that emulate other types of collection. Still, my decision to distinguish omnibus from anthology films strictly on the basis of directorial computation, though seemingly arbitrary, offers a practical means of counterposing distinct modes of authorship without falling back on vague terminology.19 The editors of The Film Studies Dictionary, an otherwise useful resource for terminological clarity, partially collapse distinctions between “anthology” and “compilation.” They state that an anthology is a feature-length film comprised of excerpts from other, longer films or of complete short films or independent episodes. That’s Entertainment [sic] (1974), which contains scenes from approximately one hundred classic MGM musicals, is an example of the former, while Bodybags (1993), featuring two horror tales directed by John Carpenter and one by Tobe Hooper, and Paris vu par . . . (1965), containing six episodes each focusing on a different section of Paris and each made by a different French New Wave director, are instances of the latter type.20\n\nA compilation, according to the editors, is a “film made largely or entirely from footage from other films or visual media. Unlike collage films, compilation films tend to be documentaries rather than experimental or avantgarde films, and to be structured rhetorically, to explain or persuade, rather than lyrically.”21 In an effort to distinguish the compilation from the omnibus and anthology, however, we need only return to MerriamWebster’s, which says that a compilation is a book or document composed of materials gathered from other books or documents. It is based on the Latin compilare, meaning “to plunder.” After the term “compilation film” was first coined by Jay Leyda in his book Films Beget Films (1964), only the most politically charged documentaries were thought to embody this newly defined genre.22 Today, however, everything from Esther Shub’s trilogy [Fall of the Romanov Dynasty (1927), The Great Road (1927), and The Russia of Nicholas II and Leo Tolstoy (1928)] to the seemingly frivolous Footlight Varieties (1951), The Great Chase (1963), The Bugs Bunny/ Road Runner Movie (1979), and Mondocartoon (1989) fall under the compilation banner.

For personal use only.\n\n­\n\n“ b e ginnings witho ut e n ds ” 15\n\nAs an episodic subgenre in which various scenes or truncated footage from earlier productions are strung together to create a new work, the compilation film is a kind of anthology of “greatest hits.” One of the most famous examples of a compendium of highlights confiscated from previously released films is That’s Entertainment! (1974). Because the people behind the making of this and other compilation films are inheritors, rather than producers, of texts, the vintage clips (over which a narrational voiceover is often poured like cement) synthesize into an object not unlike a Duchampian “readymade.” Moreover, the recycled, compiled clips represent, in their new narrative habitat, what are supposed to be the most attractive commodities available, serialized in such a way as to invoke a cinematic mode of “window shopping.” Of course, window shopping, as Anne Friedberg has established, is itself an ocular experience broken into episodic moments.23 If, as Friedberg and other scholars have argued, window shopping epitomizes the twentieth (and now twenty-first) century’s version of flânerie, its instrumentality as a metaphor for narrative consumption depends as much on the exigencies of social mobility, mercantilic display, object commodification, and personal longing as on the phenomenology of embodied spectatorship in general. After all, part of the function of That’s Entertainment! as a cinematic “showroom” is to plant seeds of desire in viewers to seek out and consume the original films. Despite their emphasis on the above themes, not to mention the fact that compilation films ultimately objectify desire and replace the context of origin or production with the context of the collection, I have decided not to include such works as Gaslight Follies (1945), Road to Hollywood (1947), Variety Time (1948), Down Memory Lane (1949), Make Mine Laughs (1949), and That’s Entertainment! in my study of episode films. Certainly, however, this group of films, largely neglected, deserves a separate study of its own. The term “portmanteau” – often indiscriminately used in place of both “anthology” and “omnibus” by American, French, and British film critics – brings to mind two additional definitions: the first denotes any hybrid neologism emerging from the compression of sounds and meanings of two different words (for example, “chortle” is a portmanteau word in which “chuckle” and “snort” merge);24 the second refers to a large leather suitcase that opens into two hinged compartments folding out symmetrically. My use of the word “portmanteau,” fluctuating between these two pragmatic definitions, departs significantly from standard parlance to embrace only those episode films that are broken into two, relatively equal halves (regardless of the number of directors involved). Examples of this rare breed – the two-story “point and counterpoint” film – include Not for distribution or resale.

The portmanteau film, because of its binarized structure, invites a sustained critique of narrative symmetry, perspectival disjuncture, and thematic reverberation – an invitation that I have taken up elsewhere.25 Writing about the portmanteau film Face to Face at the time of its original theatrical release, a writer for New Yorker magazine, John McCarten, linked it to earlier forerunners of cinematic episodicity, including Quartet, Trio, and Encore, all of which he refers to as “amalgam pictures.”26 Derived from the French amalgame (itself beholden to the medieval Latin term amalgama, meaning a mollifying poultice or plaster that is softened), the word “amalgam” suggests a union or conjunction that is “complete” and “intimate,” according to the Oxford English Dictionary. Though McCarten’s neologistic expression was used to denote the intimate bonds linking the individual episodes in a group of British films (which I refer to, in Chapters 5 and 6, as “consensus pictures”), “amalgam picture” might more evocatively be deployed as a cinematic metaphor for midcentury nation building and consciousness-raising in the United States. This is directly thematized in the postwar omnibus film It’s a Big Country (1951), a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production (overseen by studio head Dore Schary and producer Robert Sisk) that was subtitled “An American Anthology” at the time of its original release. Regardless of whether it is called an “anthology” or an “amalgam,” this episodic picture about cultural, ethnic, and racial diversity in the United States (based on multiple short stories in a 1947 collection entitled Americans One and All) deserves recognition for its scale and the ambition of its makers, including the seven directors who contributed individuals segments.27 Described by Sisk as a film designed to increase moviegoers’ understanding of “the melting pot that is America [through] contemporary stories of the different kinds of people in this country,” It’s a Big Country represents the potential in omnibus productions to explore issues of nationhood, citizenship, and cultural diversity in a unique – in a uniquely amalgamated – way.28 Finally, the word “sketch” is deployed throughout this book in particular generic and national contexts.

Writing for the online fanzine Korean Grindhouse, one reviewer refers to the individual contributions of Japanese director Naomi Kawase (“Koma”), Korean director Hong Sang-soo (“Lost in the Mountains”), and Filipino director Lav Diaz (“Butterflies Have No Memories”) as “discarded sketches”; by which he means, “[T]hey come across as both unfinished and unwanted.” Referring to Kawase’s episode in particular, the reviewer states that “Koma” seems as though the filmmaker is testing out ideas for a bigger film, more than making an actual short movie. Characters are underdeveloped, and the story – about a young man who comes to pay his respects to his grandfather’s former employer only to find himself seduced by a crazy woman who may be misinterpreting him as her spirit bridegroom – is skeletal and would require more fleshing out to be compelling.29\n\nOnce again, a prejudice against omnibus films makes itself felt in this passage, evincing a widely held belief that “heaviness” rather than “lightness” should be celebrated and sought out in art cinema, a cinema of presumed “depth” rather than “shallowness.” Admitting to his readers that omnibus films often succeed in giving “a quick taste of a few artists,” the Korean Grindhouse blogger ends his review by stating that the motion picture left him “looking for a meal elsewhere,” searching for “another menu” offering more filling/fulfilling experiences than that provided by the three sketches in Visitors. In denoting a short, often satirical play or scene in a variety show or revue, “sketch” seems particularly applicable as a description of the narrative segments comprising quickly produced, cheaply shot, histrionic comedies such as Dynamite Chicken (1971), Groove Tube (1972), Kentucky Fried Movie (1977), and Amazon Women on the Moon (1987), as well as their Italian forerunners of the 1960s such as The Dolls (Le bambole, 1965), High Infidelity (Alta infedeltà, 1965), The Complexes (I complessi, 1965), and other representative works featuring excessively encoded stereotypes related to femininity and masculinity. Whereas the first three of the American films are solo-directed efforts (by Ernest Pintoff, Ken Shapiro, and John Landis, respectively), Amazon Women on the Moon is a multidirector production featuring the contributions of five directors (Joe Dante, Carl Gottlieb, Peter Horton, John Landis, and Robert K. Weiss). The film’s twenty-one individual sketches last anywhere from just a few seconds to several minutes, emulating the experience of a television viewer switching channels. These and other comedy sketch films (including the Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n18\n\no mnibus f il m s\n\nwidely panned 2013 release Movie 43), despite their seemingly contemporary concern with scatological humor, hark back to the variety acts of vaudeville thanks to their often self-conscious staging of comic business as well as their presentational bearing. Though the term also brings to mind a brief or informal literary composition, a tentative or preliminary experiment confined to the page, it is this presentational, rather than strictly representational, quality that makes sketch films – as unique cultural expressions of comical corporeality – all the more fascinating from the vantage of film phenomenology. In France, episode films are generally called films à sketches (though the term films collectifs is also habitually used).30 In Germany, anthology, omnibus, portmanteau, and sketch films fall under the catchall category Episodenfilm. Italian cinephiles have a wider lexicon from which to draw, referring to this type of cinematic praxis as il film antologico, il film ad episodi, il film collettivo, and il film di repertorio, among other terms. And, while English-speaking critics had used the conjoined term “episode film” since the theatrical release of D. W. Griffith’s Home, Sweet Home (1914), it was not until the late 1940s and early 1950s that the terms “omnibus film,” “anthology film,” and “sketch film” first entered common parlance in the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and other American dailies.31 The term “portmanteau film” was likewise first used by British critics around that time. Today these words are habitually substituted for one another and are accepted as synonyms for the overarching term “episode film.” In a way, the transdefinitional collapse of meaning that might result from the mishmash of these signifiers is akin to the transauthorial mixing of filmmakers’ voices in a multi-director episode film, a polyvocal cultural form that is “postmodern” in its decenteredness and which continues to elude many critics’ grasp. Let us now consider the word “omnibus.” According to Michael Quinion, the term first appeared in 1820s France as part of voiture omnibus, a “carriage for everyone” (the Latin omnis means “all”).32 More specifically, the word dates back to 1825, when a Frenchman by the name of M. Baudry applied it to his firm’s vehicles which transported sundry passengers “between Nantes and a nearby bathing place.” As detailed in the Oxford English Dictionary, the omnibus was thus distinct from earlier modes of transport, such as the caroche (a more luxurious carriage or coach designed for nobles or the upper classes). And, because it offered cheaper fares and larger seating areas, the omnibus became a favored means of getting from one end of the city to the other, not just in Paris but in London as well where (in the late 1800s) the term began popping up in English conversations and newsletters covering political matters, Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n­\n\n“ b e ginnings witho ut e n ds ” 19\n\nsuch as the passing of “omnibus bills” (measures that contained several different proposals). Eventually, “omnibus” blossomed into the more abstract connotation of a miscellaneous collection, gaining “the sense of a large number of distinct items or objects lumped together solely for convenience.”33 Yet it was not until the Daily Telegraph proclaimed January 1, 1929 to be “a day of what the publishers call ‘omnibus books’, meaning works which carry many and varied passengers,” that the term came to designate printed collections of writings on a related subject.34 Throughout this book, I draw upon the word’s indelible mobility and inclusiveness to refer to multi-director episode films produced over the past century. It’s a Big Country, Love in the City (L’amore in città, 1953), Love and the Frenchwoman (La Française et l’amour, 1960), Far from Vietnam (Loin du Vietnam, 1967), Germany in Autumn (Deutschland im Herbst, 1978), In Our Time (Guang yin de gu shi, 1982), New York Stories (1989), All the Invisible Children (2005), Zagreb Stories (Zagrebacke price, 2009), Tales from the Golden Age (Amintiri din epoca de aur, 2009), and 60 Seconds of Solitude in Year Zero (2011) are just a few of the many transauthorial motion pictures that can be likened to a vehicle carrying numerous passengers, an open vessel of mass transportation whose social symbolism is historically linked to a felicitous transition from traditionalism to modernism (to postmodernism) and connotes the coalescing of disparate demographic groups as well as geographic spaces. Think of the omnibus film, then, as a collective carriage transporting not one but several directors as well as production crews, screenwriters, and actors (not to mention audience members) over a textual terrain that is necessarily “bumpy,” or pockmarked by narrative fissures. Though the history of episode films dates back to the second decade of the twentieth century, the expression “omnibus film” was not used by critics and reviewers until the late 1940s and early 1950s, in response to a series of British, French, and Italian motion pictures theatrically released during that period. In a 1953 Theatre Arts article penned by Parker Tyler, the esteemed American critic deployed the term in his assessment of the Franco-Italian coproduction The Seven Deadly Sins (Les sept péchés capitaux, 1952), an “omnibus film” (in his words) that strings together the work of seven prominent directors: Eduardo De Filippo (“Avarice and Anger”), Jean Dréville (“Sloth”), Yves Allégret (“Lust”), Roberto Rossellini (“Envy”), Carlo Rim (“Gluttony”), Claude AutantLara (“Pride”), and Georges Lacombe (“The Eighth Sin”).35 That same year, after encountering such internationally distributed works as The Story of Three Loves (1953) and Encore, an anonymous Australian reviewer at the Sydney Morning Herald accurately proclaimed, “The ‘omnibus’ Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n20\n\no mnibus f il m s\n\nfilm habit seems to be growing.”36 This prognosis came three years after Bosley Crowther, a film critic at the New York Times, had suggested that multi-director pictures like Quartet and Ways of Love (1950) were part of a fashionable new trend in European filmmaking – a trend that was beginning to spread to America with the theatrical releases of the MGM production It’s a Big Country, which showcases the work of seven directors (Clarence Brown, Don Hartman, John Sturges, Richard Thorpe, Charles Vidor, Don Weis, and William A. Wellman), and the Twentieth CenturyFox production O. Henry’s Full House (1952), which showcases the work of five directors (Henry Hathaway, Howard Hawks, Henry King, Henry Koster, and Jean Negulesco).37 In an even earlier report about the financial problems plaguing British film producers during the postwar era, published in the New York Times on March 13, 1949, C. A. Lejeune made passing reference to Train of Events (1949), calling it an “omnibus picture” (one of the first times that the term was used in the newspaper).38 Significantly, this episodic feature, combining the short films of three directors (Sidney Cole, Charles Crichton, and Basil Dearden), is set within a means of transit – a night train traveling from Euston to Liverpool – that is itself split into separate yet connected sections or “compartments” (the cars of a locomotive destined to crash at the end of the film). Produced by Michael Balcon at Ealing Studios, Train of Events was neither the first nor the most important omnibus film to have graced movie theater screens by the time the term itself had gained traction in critical discourse, having been predated by such American and British works as If I Had a Million (1932), Forever and a Day (1943), Dead of Night (1945), and On Our Merry Way (1948). But its title alone serves to highlight how this transauthorial genre – like a train – chains together several groups of people and incidents, both internally (or diegetically) and externally (or extradiegetically), all of which are contained within a mobile yet stationary frame that, from the “outside,” appears linear and unbroken. But, as I hope to illustrate, the omnibus film is a genre of cinematic fragments whose ability to connote wholeness or completeness is as much the result of critical interventions in the form as it is the product of culture industries and companies aiming to attract a broad demographic of diverse audiences from different backgrounds and with divergent tastes. Words therefore matter, especially when it comes to addressing what an omnibus film is, how it functions, and why a title like “Train of Events” serves an important role in prepping the audience for the episodes that follow. As we shall see, part of the omnibus film’s dysfunctional status as a “failed” narrative can be attributed to spectatorial preconceptions about the nature of cinematic art which is problematically assumed by Not for distribution or resale.

This is particularly apparent in the commentary surrounding the 2005 film Tickets, an omnibus feature whose title, rendered in plural, connotes the value – the “bang for one’s buck” – associated with episodic cinema (wherein audiences are presented with two or more stories for the price of one). Like those in Train of Events, the separate yet interlocking episodes of this multinational coproduction are set on the cars of a speeding train. That setting, as a kind of “moving target,” becomes an operative means of unpacking the omnibus film’s horizontal depth, metaphorically suggested by the size, shape, and structure of the vehicle itself.\n\nHorizontal Depth and Paratextual Proliferations, from Tickets to Tube Tales “Each story is different, each story is separate – but together they do make a picture.” Director Ken Loach, speaking to fellow filmmakers Ermanno Olmi and Abbas Kiarostami during the production of Tickets (2005)\n\nA Medusa Films release of a Fandango/Sixteen Films coproduction (in association with the United Kingdom’s Film Council), Tickets is a decidedly mixed type of cultural artifact. As such, it is an appropriate “vehicle” through which to initiate a book about that most motley and unruly of meta-genres, the omnibus film. Produced by Carlo Crest-Dina, Babak Karimi, Rebecca O’Brien, and Domenico Procacci, this cross-cultural experiment in directorial collaboration brings together “a gaggle of great auteurs” – Ermanno Olmi, Abbas Kiarostami, and Ken Loach – whose distinct yet connected stories, according to Donald Clarke (a critic at the Irish Times), are “surprisingly cohesive” despite the occasionally “teethjarring . . . messy splices” required to link up the lives of disparate travelers.39 Among the train’s passengers are an elderly biochemist from Rome, the haughty widow of an Italian general, and a trio of young football fans from Glasgow who argue with a family of Albanian immigrants over a stolen train ticket. Unlike many episode films of the youth-oriented 1960s, such as the Yugoslavian production Raindrops, Water, Warriors (Kapi, vode, ratnici, 1962), which showcases the work of three young, first-time directors (Zivojin Pavlovic, Marko Babac and Kokan Rakonjac, all of whom were members of the Kino Klub in Belgrade), Tickets unites the short films of seasoned auteurs whose reputations precede them.

Besides building momentum across the narrative breaches that separate the episodes, Tickets also builds connections across cultures, among characters from vastly different national backgrounds. This is one of the constituent features of omnibus narrativity: its capacity to forge ties between distinct social groups and discrete spaces that nevertheless retain their autonomy owing to their sequential arrangement (one after the other). As I will elaborate throughout this book, the gap-filled structure of the omnibus film makes it possible for audiences to fill in missing information and perceive connections between seemingly disparate people, a maneuver that has aesthetic as well as ethical implications. Because of the combined length and brevity of the form, as a feature-length motion picture composed of several shorts, the omnibus film paradoxically facilitates the spectatorial act of “crossing over” by withholding information, by sketching in only a few details, by allotting open spaces in which viewers might dwell (if only momentarily) as active participants. Indeed, the omnibus film’s inter-episodic juxtapositions reveal a perverse logic at play in this most contradictory of genres, with sometimes “unseemly” connections being forged and with the very concept of depth being altered in the process. Depth, traditionally conceived of as a kind of vertical plunging into profundity or “geological” search for meaning below the surface, is thus made horizontal or “geographical” in the context of omnibus features. Though the act of extracting hermeneutic significance through sustained engagement (with a single group of people or a solitary protagonist) is one way of acknowledging the relative depth of a cultural production, this attempt to dig below the surface of texts is offset by a new model of profundity in films such as Tickets. What this and other omnibus productions do is move beyond the temporal–historical markers of vertical depth to point toward the spatial–textual coordinates specific to what I call horizontal depth, which extends signification across an array of narrative environments or social milieus, segmentally organized and transtextually linked. In the case of Tickets, those spaces would seem to be limited to the cars of the train where most of the action is set. As in the 2006 production Paris, je t’aime, Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n­\n\n“ b e ginnings witho ut e n ds ” 23\n\nhowever, which ostensibly confines each of the contributing filmmakers to a given arrondissement of the French capital, spatial limitations can be overcome through a variety of means; whether by extending the touristic gaze so that a more panoramic vision brings together distinct districts, compartments, and people, or through the interjection of cinematic devices (such as flashbacks and voiceover commentary) that strengthen identificatory links with characters whose lives are “bigger” than their narrative settings. In transiting from one setting to another, the viewer of Tickets or Paris, je t’aime not only engages in a kind of intersubjective cosmopolitanism, increasing his or her capacity to see similarities among the text’s visible differences, but also metaphorically enacts, at the “local” level, the kind of border-crossing movement inscribed in transnational flows. Indeed, as I shall explain in the final two chapters of this book (devoted to allegorical narratives, political participation, and supranational initiatives designed to heighten regional cooperation), the omnibus film is the most “trans” of all transpositional cultural forms, collapsing transmedial, translinguistic, transgeneric, translocal, and transnational modes in the space of a single feature that unites multiple voices and visions, making it transauthorial as well. It is telling that Loach, one of the three contributors to Tickets, adopts the term “horizontal” when elaborating his belief that individuals “have much more in common with people in the same position in other countries than they do with those at the top of their own society.” In a recent interview, the British filmmaker stresses that one of his goals in participating in this multi-director production was to “encourage people to see their loyalties horizontally across national boundaries,” a comment that underlines the transnational valences of much episodic cinema. This is something that occurs in Loach’s episode which, as John Hill points out, concerns “three working-class Celtic fans on board a train for Rome [who] assist a family of Albanian immigrants before they themselves are helped (to escape the police) by Italian football supporters.”41 The “horizontal identification” that he stages in and around the space of a single train compartment (including the platform area and the station), though hinging on a form of cross-cultural kinship that is born from a shared sense of social marginalization, extends beyond the physical confines of the speeding train and becomes a rhetorical solicitation to all spectators. Audiences are thus asked to make parallel attempts to mentally join up disparate communities as part of a cosmopolitan hermeneutics that is sensitive to the textual similarities among separately shot short films. In this way, Tickets is not unlike another multi-director film, ID Swiss Not for distribution or resale.

The metaphorical camaraderie discernible as a theme within Tickets finds its literal partner in the solidarity expressed offscreen by the three directors. For their part, and based on information provided in a supplemental documentary included on Facet Video’s North American DVD release of Tickets, Olmi, Kiarostami, and Loach all seemed to have sensed the difficulties involved in linking up their distinct worldviews, artistic temperaments, and thematic preoccupations as soon as they began shooting the film. But, as self-designated “friends,” they endeavored to smooth out potential problems during the preproduction stages. As detailed in that behind-the-scenes documentary, entitled Ticket x 3, the three directors worked together to hash out the basic ideas for their stories. Though Kiarostami came up with the original concept of having a trilogy of tales told by a trio of filmmakers, and told producers Carlo Cresto-Dina and Babak Karimi that the directors with whom he would like to work were Olmi and Loach, each of the three played a vital role in determining the structure of the film as well as the trajectory of its train-bound narrative.43 Significantly, in an early scene of the documentary, Olmi uses the word “game” to describe his notion of their collaboration, equating the act of making an omnibus film to an “exquisite corpse”-type activity. “Let’s start with three colors . . . red, black, and white,” the Italian director tells his gathered guests (including multiple translators, two for each of the other filmmakers), elaborating that one person could select a color as the inspiration for a scenario that would lead to another color-inspired segment. Amid the cacophony of voices, the torrent of translated speech in this moment of transauthorial brainstorming, Loach softly yet assertively responds that he cannot “start with a colour” as the conceptual or Not for distribution or resale.

Other facts about the making of Tickets are included in this nearly one-hour documentary which comes to an end with a scene of the three directors deciding how to edit a key scene – an exterior shot showing the immigrant family boarding the intercity train to Rome. Even without this information, though, spectators would likely detect thematic reverberations throughout the text, with the theme of compassion emerging in each episode and the subject of theft worming its way through the proceedings (in the second episode, a cell phone is taken, whereas a ticket is stolen in the third episode). As I will argue throughout this book, however, paratextual elements, including posters, film titles, supplemental features, directors’ commentary tracks, and even DVD and Blu-ray disc menus, play a part in our hermeneutic unpacking of omnibus narratives. As Jonathan Gray asserts in his recently published study of media paratextuality, meanings are “constructed outside of what we have often considered to be the text itself.”45 Therefore, it behooves us to consider those situationally proxemic textual manifestations, or what Gray refers to as “proliferations” (such as promotional material and DVD “bonus tracks”), in our pursuit of an appropriately discursive interpretative framework for film analysis. To take one example of the way in which media “peripherals” or “proliferations” inform the meaning-making process, we need only turn to the chapter menu for the region 2 DVD release of Tube Tales (1999). As with Tickets, much of the onscreen drama in this multi-director film unfolds within the space of a crowded train; only this time mass transit takes the form of an underground vehicle, the titular subway system spread out like a vascular network under the Greater London area. The brainchild of producer Richard Jobson, who “was interested in making a film about London” (because, in his words, “it’s never been captured on film properly”),46 Tube Tales is the result of a competition publicized in Time Out magazine in 1998. Inviting readers to send in stories related to actual experiences (their own or others’) in the London Underground, Jobson and the fledgling film company Sky Pictures (a division of the British Sky Broadcasting group) eventually selected nine scenarios from over three thousand submissions. Those ideas were then handed over to nine directors, some of whom are better known for their work in front of the camera: Gaby Dellal, Stephen Hopkins, Bob Hoskins, Menhaj Huda, Armando Iannucci, Amy Jenkins, Jude Law, Charles McDougall, and Ewan McGregor.

Significantly, the chapters are accompanied by titles (“The Professor,” “The Widow,” and “The Celtic Fans”) that are not provided in the film itself (and were not decided on by the three filmmakers).\n\nFigure 1.4 One of the three menu screens for the region 2 DVD release of Tube Tales (1999).

For personal use only.\n\n28\n\no mnibus f il m s\n\nrelease of Tickets (in which a mere four chapters provide access points to the first scenes in each segment, in addition to the opening credits), the designers of the Tube Tales DVD menus opted for a more elaborate approach to paratextual suggestiveness. Theirs is a graphical approximation of a subway map, spreading the disk’s ten chapters (one for each of the episodes plus one for the entire film’s opening credits) across three screens representing separate “zones.” The film’s combined sense of fragmentation and unity is conveyed in these menu designs, which show a red Tube line extending horizontally, from left to right, across several subway stops (four on the first two screens, two on the last screen) so as to suggest both episodicity and linearity. Those stops become narrative entryways for the spectator whose agency is enhanced by way of a paratextual extension of the selection process that is such an important feature of the text itself (with several episodes pivoting on the theme of choice). That is, the home video-viewing audience is granted a degree of choice when confronted with this “map” of the film’s narrative, arranged in such a way as to draw attention to the episodes’ titles and numerical designations as well as to presumably representative screen shots used as visual accompaniment to those titles and numbers. Those frame enlargements from the episodes – each a medium close-up or closeup shot of the main character(s) – belie producer Richard Jobson’s argument that London is “the most international city in the world.” Stating in an interview that there is “a huge mixture of races here, and the only place you really see those people is on the Tube,” Jobson’s intention to highlight heretofore overlooked areas of the city’s demographically diverse population is certainly admirable. But the finished omnibus production, as represented by the DVD’s chapter menu, encapsulates a somewhat limited view of cultural and racial heterogeneity, despite the presence of ethnic minorities in the fourth episode (Mehaj Huda’s “Grasshopper”) and the ninth episode (Charles McDougall’s “Steal Away”). Equally telling are the film’s embedded paratexts, the individual episode titles interspersed throughout Tube Tales and rendered as (or inscribed upon) material objects. The title of Perkins’s episode, “Mr. Cool,” appears as a logo on the black jacket worn by a motorcyclist who enters a commercial building through revolving doors. Though he is of little importance to this short segment, concerning the attempts by two business executives to woo a young woman on her way home from work, this mysterious figure – the first to be shown in the film – bears the director’s name on his back (in addition to the episode’s title) and is thus significant as an authorial inscription or placeholder fleetingly witnessed.

The other images chosen as title breaks in Tube Tales serve an “entryway” function, insofar as they visually announce something about to come in the ensuing narratives (as the stacks of money do at the beginning of director Charles McDougall’s “Steal Away”), or use material ephemera (such as a newspaper, a ticket stub, a french fry, and a cigarette pack) to connote the ephemeral nature of cinematic episodicity. Two of the episodes’ titles are presented as “environmental text,” words spray-painted and plastered on the walls of a public space that, like the omnibus film, Not for distribution or resale.

Tellingly, the episode that most clearly revolves around London’s socially marginalized people – director Menhaj Huda’s “Grasshopper” – begins with an image of a discarded Tube ticket, a piece of everyday economic transaction that litters the station but is overlooked by most of the travelers who step on it. This object, not unlike a movie theater ticket stub, is a momentary possession, one that enters a person’s life (much like an episode in an omnibus film) only to be tossed away and quickly forgotten. That action, captured in the opening seconds of “Grasshopper,” assumes deeper meaning in the context of a story about a paranoid drug courier hopping from compartment to compartment (to get away from his juvenile mates) and who is eventually stopped by police. Rather than bust the young man for his illegal dealings, however, the authorities ask him to produce his seemingly unimportant Tube ticket, a material metaphor or marker of a transaction that ensures adherence to the law. Trains and their associated metaphors of enclosure, segmented linearity, and mobility proliferate within the omnibus filmography. Besides the aforementioned examples, films such as It’s a Big Country, Golden Arrow (a.k.a. The Gay Adventure, 1949, released 1953), The Year 01 (L’An 01, 1973), Africa Dreaming (1997), Tales of the Unusual (Yo ni mo kimyo na monogatari, 2000), and Queer Boys and Girls on the SHINKANSEN (2004) begin and/or end with episodes either set at a train station (a place of arrival and departure) or taking place inside a train compartment. The four-episode Italian film Of Wayward Love (L’amore difficile, 1962) does not begin with a train sequence but its final segment, directed by Nino Manfredi, is set in a crowded compartment where a soldier (Manfredi) heading for Sicily encounters a grieving widow (Fulvia Franco). Dressed from head to toe in black, with a veil failing to cover her face completely, the woman makes contact with the soldier sitting beside her, first with her eyes, then with her knees, and finally – once all of the other passengers have departed – with the rest of her body. An improbable sexual encounter, this, but one whose combined brevity and intensity – brought to a precipitous end once she, too, gets off the train and leaves the man in a state of expectation – conjure qualitative aspects of cinematic episodicity that I will attend to throughout this book. Finally, because trains are also linked to deadlines and timetables, they lend material solidity to a theme that might otherwise “melt” into air. Time, that sometimes palpably felt yet slippery component of cinematic narrativity, is “spatialized” via the train-like compartmentalizing of storytelling unique to episode films, especially one like Tickets in which the impending end of a journey lends urgency to the various characters’ efforts to reclaim lost objects. Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n­\n\n“ b e ginnings witho ut e n ds ” 31\n\nInsofar as Tickets concerns travel across literal and figurative, real and imaginary spaces, it is significant that the film provides opportunities for critics to make their own “departures,” their own spirited excursions out of the text into adjacent territories. Prompted by an early scene in the film’s first episode, Judy Meewezen does just that, making the intertextual leap from Tickets to The Tree of Wooden Clogs (L’Albero degli zoccoli, 1978), another, more highly praised Olmi-directed film that shares much in common with the Italian auteur’s fleeting, thirty-minute narrative aboard the train. For Meewezen, the sight of the aging professor gazing forlornly out of the train window – his thoughts gravitating toward the image of “a dark-haired rich girl playing Chopin in a far-off decade” – recalls a scene from Olmi’s Palme d’Or-winning tale of a destitute peasant who, at one point, “peers into a room where a bourgeois boy plays Bach on the piano.”48 Though “the consistent rhythms of the train and the uniformly enclosed space bind the narratives together well,”49 as a multi-episode film featuring the contributions of three directors (each famous for developing his own unique style or artistic vision over a lengthy career) Tickets is nevertheless a “broken” text. Watching it, the spectator might feel compelled to fill in the gaps, not only in terms of imagining more elaborate backstories for the characters who briefly populate the narrative but also by linking each episode to a larger authorial corpus, as Meewezen does with Olmi’s contribution. And yet, despite the intertextually playful activity that this and similarly episodic motion pictures generate, several reviewers responded negatively to Tickets, which, “like most ‘omnibus’ films, doesn’t really gel.” According to one critic, the film’s three episodes “are only tenuously connected,” regardless of their shared setting, and they vary wildly in terms of their emotional textures and tonalities (with Olmi’s story being “inconsequential,” Kiarostami’s a “livelier” improvement over the first, and Loach’s curtain-closer a “deeply moving” reminder of the British filmmaker’s skill with young actors).50 Donald Clarke, one of the relatively few critics to argue for the film’s tonal consistency, nevertheless wraps up his review of Tickets with disparaging comments about the omnibus form in general, saying that there is “always a suggestion of compromise in such projects” and that, regardless of how enjoyable much of the film is, “you wouldn’t really call it a proper film.”51\n\nNot a Proper Film: the Omnibus Film’s “Defects” and Detractors If Tickets is not a “proper film,” then just what kind of film is it? To return to Clarke’s dismissive account of the omnibus film’s failings as Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n32\n\no mnibus f il m s\n\nan aesthetic and cultural form, it is significant that he refers to Tickets “as a sort of taster menu, designed to drag you back to future work from its distinguished directors.”52 That is, whatever artistic merits the film and its individual episodes might have are overshadowed by the text’s usefulness as a springboard that encourages leaps back into the comforting familiarity of a more “properly” emplotted narrative, one that steers clear of episodicity and adheres to a linear path upon which a single group of characters sets out. According to this “logic,” when one watches an omnibus film such as Tickets, one should be less concerned with sorting out the intratextual echoes and thematic reverberations across the conjoined episodes than with making intertextual connections between elements in a given segment and the larger body of feature-length films attributed to that segment’s director. One of the omnibus film’s supposed defects – its failure to conform to conventional narrative formulas – is thus tied to a fundamental misperception about the form, or rather a critical failure that has resulted in a further foreclosure of inquiry. For far too long, and in far too many casually dismissive journalistic reviews, critics have failed to appreciate the omnibus film’s intratextual complexities as a structure that is paradoxically unified by its flaunted narrative faultlines, its visible gaps that can be imaginatively inhabited or attended to by active audiences. Examples of this kind of critical response are plentiful and can be traced back to André Bazin’s statement, in 1948, that “the film composed of sketches” is “a bastard and phony type of film if ever there was one.”53 Likewise, in his harsh condemnation of the omnibus film genre as “an idiot quasi-genre that was momentarily hot potatoes in the New Waveyness of the 1960s, as everybody from Godard to Pasolini to Marcel Ophüls was happily commissioned to make crazy shorts that were then packaged together into congenitally ramshackle features,” the Village Voice critic Michael Atkinson provides a representative voice of dissent that, ironically, harmonizes with the general tenor of anti-episodic bias in the popular press. That bias has become particularly exacerbated in the past few years, with the theatrical releases of what are generally recognized as artistic “failures,” such as Four Rooms (1995) and Eros (2004) , the latter an “omni-bust” consisting of short films by Michelangelo Antonioni, Steven Soderbergh, and Wong Kar-wai that Atkinson was reviewing when he made the above pronouncement.54 At the time of its release, Four Rooms – a pet project by four young directors (Allison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino) – momentarily became the focus of highbrow cultural authorities and “serious” film critics who dismissed the work, not only as Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n­\n\n“ b e ginnings witho ut e n ds ” 33 a failed experiment in narrative form but also as an omen of things to come in the “self-indulgent” world of studio-bankrolled, independent filmmaking. Beginning with its dismal premiere at the Toronto Film Festival, Four Rooms received a thrashing not unlike the hotel rooms themselves, none more so than the most “successful” of the four episodes – Robert Rodriguez’s “The Misbehavers.” In this third sequence of Four Rooms, two precocious tykes left alone by their parents proceed to lay waste to hotel property. In manic bursts of Tex Avery-style comedy-violence, they deface the furniture and make weird memorandums on the walls of this once magnificent, now decaying landmark of old Los Angeles: an architectural signifier of the classic Hollywood studio system that gave way to American independents. The wanton vandalism on display in Four Rooms can therefore be read as a mise en abyme of the film itself, which assaulted conventional narrative logic while foiling audience expectations. Moreover, the wrecked room connects to the abuse heaped on Tarantino and company, hip young filmmakers who, like the boisterous, destructive kids, let loose their unchecked imaginations in a space of social deviance. The result was not so much a kind of hostility toward hostelry but, rather, a skepticism toward all things episodic. Because so many people seemed to loathe Four Rooms, the omnibus format itself became the target of some damning reviews in the months and years that followed, a trend that has not changed even after the 2007 release of Rodriguez’s and Tarantino’s double-barreled cult hit Grindhouse. Not all discourse is damning, however. In his contemporaneous review of the 1989 transauthorial trifecta, New York Stories (a work enchaining the short films of Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and Woody Allen), Peter Rainer, a film critic for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, admits that he has “always been a fan of multi-episode anthology movies.” Saying that such films are the “equivalent of short-story collections,” Rainer reminds his readers that “if you don’t like a particular piece, don’t fret, it’ll soon be over.” For him, “the short-story format seems to bring out an acuteness and a prankishness in directors that are sometimes muffled in their feature-length forays,” an idea that he elaborates in his analysis of Woody Allen’s contribution to this film, a comically inflected sketch entitled “Oedipus Wrecks.” “He’s more of an artist here in this dinky toss-off of a sketch than he is in something like Another Woman (1988),” Rainer writes, concluding that “the irresponsibility of the material brings out [Allen’s] truest comic instincts.”55 Besides Rainer, Vincent Canby is one of the few contemporary critics to subtly extol the virtues of episodic cinema. In 1989, the year of New York Stories’ theatrical release, Canby admitted that audiences Not for distribution or resale.

The same people who will willingly sit through a double feature appear to resent, rather than appreciate, being asked to adjust their sights to three, four or five beginnings, middles and ends within one film . . . It’s as if they suspected they were being cheated by being asked to do more work.56\n\nWhile Canby is convincing in his argument that audiences of anthology and omnibus films get more bang for their box-office buck (something that the aforementioned Grindhouse foregrounds by offering up two mini-features linked by fake movie trailers, each directed by a different filmmaker), he does not specify what kind of “work” is involved in our spectatorial engagement with them. Nor does he provide more than a passing reference to the qualitative “worth” of such works whose success or failure is based on unclear criteria or on aesthetic standards found in traditional narratives. And, unfortunately, his relatively balanced appraisal of episodic cinema’s merits and shortcomings has been lost on many contemporary reviewers, especially those who write for a twentyfirst-century online audience. A generally excellent source for reviews of the latest releases of East Asian films, the website lovehkfilm.com nevertheless puts forth a standard (dismissive) line of argument when its reviewer of the Hong Kong production A Decade of Love (Sup fun chung ching, 2008) calls this multidirector effort “predictably uneven.”57 According to this reviewer, the film – a commemoration of the former British crown colony’s 1997 handover, ten years after the fact – is “predictably a mixed bag,” and its aesthetic deficiencies can be partly attributed to “the omnibus format.” “[N]ot a lot can be done in each ten-minute short film,” the reviewer claims, “so any negatives are expected and even excusable.”58 At another website devoted to East Asian cinema, the three-director action film Triangle (Tie saam gok, 2007) is given a generally positive review (with the writer calling it “the most entertaining film out of Hong Kong in years”) though yet another swipe at the omnibus format wipes away any goodwill directed toward it. For all of its “great cinematography” and “thrilling atmosphere,” and despite its “fantastic soundtrack by Guy Zerafa,” this multi-director work is “actually quite inconsistent” and thus “a strange viewing experience.”59 As these examples suggest, variations and synonyms of the word “predictable” frequently spring up in the critical commentary surrounding omnibus films, as do the terms “inconsistent,” “uneven,” “mixed bag,” and “hit-and-miss.”60 Of the many scathing comments written by Andrew Sarris about the French-language “propaganda” film Far from Vietnam (in his 1967 review for Village Voice), one sentence stands out for its relevance Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n­\n\n“ b e ginnings witho ut e n ds ” 35\n\nto the current discussion. After beginning his denunciation with the words “Zero as art,” Sarris writes that he has not seen “such a patchwork quilt since Mondo Cane.”61 The latter film, released in 1962, would have been familiar to most of Sarris’s readers, given its notoriety as a globetrotting “shockumentary” showcasing unusual customs and rituals in such farflung places as the Trobriand archipelago (east of New Guinea), Nocera Terinese (a village in the Calabria region of southern Italy), and Raiputh (a fishing community on the Malay coast). Besides launching a litany of “mondo” knockoffs (including Mondo Macabro [1965], Mondo Freudo [1966], and Mondo Topless [1966]), this notorious production, written and directed by Paolo Cavara, Franco Prosperi, and Gualtiero Jacopetti, also helped to popularize the episodic structure, even if very few of the anthology and omnibus films released during that decade were as “patchwork” as it is. With over two dozen autonomous vignettes detailing everything from car cemeteries in California to tapioca eaters on the island of Tabar (part of the Bismark archipelago), Mondo Cane is, indeed, a “mixed bag,” and Sarris’s reference to it in his Far From Vietnam critique reinforces the general consensus that most episodic works are a hodgepodge, a misshapen jumble, a mess. Similarly, in his New Yorker review of the “diffuse and whimsical” film The Red Violin (Le Violon rouge, 1999), David Denby argues that director Françoise Girard “has fallen into the troubles typical of the cranky and deservedly marginal form he has chosen: the omnibus film.”62 Ironically, “cranky” is a fitting description of most film critics who find the lack of a single and sustained narrative in The Red Violin and other solo-directed and multi-director episodic works so unappealing. Another critic writing about The Red Violin, Andy Klein, states, “Anthology films are an odd-duck genre: While there once was a time – long ago – when books of short stories were published with nearly the frequency of novels, their cinematic equivalent has never amounted to even 1 percent of the fictional films released.”63 True though this last statement may be, one ought not mistake paucity for inferiority; nor should one neglect to a"
