The old Shinano Province 信濃国 / Shinshū 信州 Shinshu

... now 長野県 Nagano Prefecture.

- quote -

Shinano bordered on

1 Kōzuke, 2 Musashi, 3 Kai, 4 Suruga, 5 Tōtōmi, 6 Mikawa, 7 Mino, 8 Hida, 9 Etchu and 10 Echigo.

The ancient capital was located near modern-day 松本 Matsumoto, which became an important city of the province.

- Historical record

In 713, the road that traverses Mino and Shinano provinces was widened to accommodate increasing numbers of travelers through the Kiso District of modern Nagano Prefecture.

In the Sengoku period,

Shinano Province was often split among fiefs and castle towns developed, including 小諸 Komoro, 伊那 Ina, and 上田 Ueda. Shinano was one of the major centers of Takeda Shingen's power during his wars with Uesugi Kenshin and others.

Suwa Taisha Shrine was designated as the chief Shinto shrine (ichinomiya) for the province.

In 1871, during the Meiji period,

with the abolition of the han system and the establishment of prefectures (Haihan Chiken) after the Meiji Restoration, Shinano Province was administratively separated in 1871 into Nagano and Chikuma prefectures. These two tentative governmental and territorial units were reconfigured together again in 1876. This became the modern prefecture of Nagano, which remains substantially unchanged from that time.

- quote -

The Hokkoku Kaido Road is the generic name of the main roads in Hokuriku region in the Edo period.

There were actually three main roads running through this region;

the 北陸道 Hokuriku-do Highway, which went to the west from Naoetsu (present Niigata Pref.),

the 北国西街道 Hokkoku Nishi Kaido (West Road), which linked Seba (present Shiojiri City) on the Nakasendo Road and Tanbajima (present Nagano City), and the

the 北国脇往還 Hokkoku Waki Okan (Byroad of the Hokkoku Highway).

At the present, this byroad is often referred to as the Hokkoku Kaido Road.

The road with a total length of 140 km crossed the whole area of Shinshu region and linked Oiwake (present Karuizawa) on the Nakasendo Highway and Takada (present Joetsu City) on the Hokuriku Highway.

This road connecting the Pacific side and the Northern coastal side of the country played an important role as the gold route that carried the gold mined at Sado Gold Mine and the sankin kotai (the system of “alternate attendance”) route of the feudal lords including that of Maeda clan, who were given the fiefs in the Hokuriku region.

It was also used for carrying commodities from the Hokuriku region to the Kanto region.

The road was sometimes called “Zenkoji Kaido,” 善光寺街道 because it was used by the pilgrims visiting Zenkoji Temple in Nagano City. At the present, Route 18 traces about the same route as the Edo period Hokkoku Kaido.
