The area was part of the holdings of Komoro Domain during the Edo period. The modern town of Komoro was established on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the municipalities system. The town of Komoro annexed villages of Kawanabe, Kitaoi and Osato (all from Kitasaku District) on February 1, 1954. The city of Komoro was established on April 1, 1954 after absorbing the villages of Minamioi and Mioka (both from Kitasaku District). On April 1, 1959 parts of the town of Tobu (now part of the city of Tomi) was merged into Komoro and the city has been unchanged since.\n\nEducation\n\nKomoro has six public elementary schools and two public middle schools operated by the city government.
