        "text": "Nirasaki-shuku was an important point for transportation that was separated into Saku Okan (between Nirasaki-shuku and Iwamurada-shuku) and Sunshin Okan (Sunpu-Shinano Highway), and flourished as a post station bustling with pedestrian and horse traffic. The area around Kamanashi River landing, where goods were unloaded, was especially crowded with land transport services (chuma) using horses. Nirasaki-shuku was also affected by flooding of the Kamanashi River. There is a trace of an old embankment in an alley on the Kamanashi River side on the old Koshu-kaido Road, which can still be seen today. There are some side roads meandering along the river next to houses, and all of the side roads run toward the area of Shirahige-jinja Shrine, where Suijin (the god of water) remains as a place name. The town was divided into long and thin areas to avoid the house-frontage tax, and these districts remain to the present. Most of the properties on the present street running off of the old Koshu-kaido Road and Saku Okan Road are small and inexpensive. These have attracted young people wishing to start businesses. This was a hub for people, goods, and information filled with the spirit of business, a spirit that has been passed down to the present day and is continually being renewed. It still serves as a post station.\n\nDistance : 3km / Required Time : 1.5h / walk\n\nStarting point : Nirasaki Station\n\nGoal point : Nirasaki Station\n\nCOURSE MAP\n\nStarting point\n\nGoal point\n\nParking lot\n\nToilet"
