Shinano was one of the major centers of Takeda Shingen's power during his wars with Uesugi Kenshin and others.\n\nSuwa Taisha Shrine was designated as the chief Shinto shrine (ichinomiya) for the province.\n\nIn 1871, during the Meiji period,\n\nwith the abolition of the han system and the establishment of prefectures (Haihan Chiken) after the Meiji Restoration, Shinano Province was administratively separated in 1871 into Nagano and Chikuma prefectures. These two tentative governmental and territorial units were reconfigured together again in 1876. This became the modern prefecture of Nagano, which remains substantially unchanged from that time.\n\n- - - More in the WIKIPEDIA !\n\n. Suwa Taisha 諏訪大社 Great Suwa Shrine .\n\n.
