This happens most of the time.\n\nCould this be due to the road incline? or is it some precautionary feature.\n\nI ask this because my RX8's rear wheel was curbed and I am wondering if I should get an alignment.\n\nObviously a crown in the center of the road will push it to the right, but it has been common practice that the car will drift to the right by itself for right side of the road drivers. That way, if you fall alseep at the wheel, the car will drift away from oncoming traffic.\n\nLast edited by NavyDood; 07-29-2004 at 12:31 PM.\n\nMy car has a \"right drift issue\". I have had mine aligned twice - once by the dealer, once by a tire/suspension shop for $90 thank you very much. The independent shop said it was WAY out of line. It drove fine for about 50 miles. Then I took it on a highway trip and it drifted right on both sides of the highway and going in both directions. I think there's something wrong with the steering geometry/design. I don't know. I'm paranoid about it.\n\nI had a similar issue with my FD, only at WOT the drift became more of a hard pulling type deal. I tried the simple issues first and sure enough tire pressure was low in the rear wheel on the side of the car that was pulling. Filled the tire and the issue was gone. Point is, start with the easiest things before going nuts.\n\ngoing nuts and bolts\n\nTire pressure, good thought...I tried that, I tried putting an extra lb. in the right front....still doing lane changes. I'd take it to the dealer, but The mechanics here in St. Louis are on strike and have been for about six weeks. I guess they'll go back to work when the electric company tell enough of them that they're turning off their lights!"
