        "text": "Léonie van den Haak posted:\n\nThe Nakasendō (中山道 Central Mountain Route), also called the Kisokaidō (木曾街道), was one of the five routes of the Edo period, and one of the two that connected Edo (modern-day Tokyo) to Kyoto in Japan. There were 69 stations (staging-posts) between Edo and Kyoto, crossing through Musashi, Kōzuke, Shinano, Mino and Ōmi provinces. In addition to Tokyo and Kyoto, the Nakasendō runs through the modern-day prefectures of Saitama, Gunma, Nagano, Gifu and Shiga, with a total distance of approximately 534 km (332 mi).\n\nUnlike the coastal Tōkaidō, the Nakasendō traveled inland, hence its name, which can be translated as \"中 = central; 山 = mountain; 道 = route\" (as opposed to the Tōkaidō, which roughly meant \"eastern sea route\"). Because it was such a well-developed road, many famous persons, including the haiku master Matsuo Bashō, traveled the road. Many people preferred traveling along the Nakasendō because it did not require travelers to ford any rivers.\n\nAlthough there has been much modern development along the Nakasendō, a few stretches remain in its original form, while others have been restored in more recent decades. The most well-known section lies in the Kiso Valley, between Tsumago-juku in Nagano Prefecture and Magome-juku in Gifu Prefecture. The area was first made famous by the early 20th-century writer Shimazaki Tōson, who chronicled the effects of the Meiji Restoration on the valley in his landmark novel Before the Dawn. This eight-kilometer section of the Nakasendō can still be travelled along comfortably by foot, and both Tsumago-juku and Magome-juku have preserved and restored the traditional architecture. The walk between the historical post towns requires two to three hours to walk, with forests, restored paving and fine views of waterfalls along the way.\n\nAlthough much of the Nakasendō no longer exists in its historic form, its route is now roughly followed by modern roads. In order, they are:\n\nNational Route 17: Tokyo to Takasaki (Gunma Prefecture)\n\nNational Route 18: Takasaki to Karuizawa (Nagano Prefecture)\n\nNational Route 142: Saku to Shimosuwa (Nagano Prefecture)\n\nNational Route 20: Shimosuwa to Shiojiri (Nagano Prefecture)\n\nNational Route 19: Shiojiri to Ena (Gifu Prefecture)\n\nNational Route 21: Mitake (Gifu Prefecture) to Maibara (Shiga Prefecture)\n\nNational Route 8: Maibara to Kusatsu (Shiga Prefecture)\n\nNational Route 1: Kusatsu to Kyoto"
