        "text": "The Memorial Hall was built by the Western-style house building company America-ya in the Taisho period; Nozawa Genjiro purchased the building from Konoe Fumimaro in 1926. In 1932, Ichimura Kesazo, who was a political scientist and had friendly relations with Konoe, bought the building; it was relocated and reconstructed in Minamihara the next year. After that, the building was restored and reconstructed in the current location at the east end of Amamiya Pond in 1997 and was donated to the town by the Ichimura family. Many materials of Ichimura Kesazo, who contributed to development of Minamihara as an area of villas, and his wife Ichimura Kiyoji, who became an honorary townsperson, are displayed here, as well as materials concerning Amemiya Keijiro and Konoe Fumimaro. Ichimura Memorial Hall was designated as a cultural property of Karuizawa Town (Designation No. 19) on May 24, 2016.\n\nThe regional exchange facility was built in front of Naka-karuizawa Station on the Shinano Railway by the town and opened on April 1, 2013. The regional exchange facility is Kutsukake Terrace, named after the former name of the area. Kutsukake was the name of one of the post towns on the former Nakasendo just like Karuizawa. Here you will find the Tourist Information Center, a library and \"challenge shops\", witch are used by entrepreneurs who wish to open shops in the area.\n\nIt was a junction of the Nakasendo and the Hokkoku Kaido during the Edo period. Turning to the left is the Nakasendo towards Kyoto and turning to the right is the Hokkoku Kaido towards Niigata. Seven stone works made in the Edo period still exist: a signpost built in 1679, an all-night light, the Shinratei Bansho monument engraved with his comic tanka, a Kosodate (child-raising) Jizo statue, a Seishi Bosatsu (guardian deity of year of the horse) statue, a Batou Kannon statue and a Kaikoku (pilgrimage) tower.\n\nThe Houjuin is a title but the actual detailed title is Nyoihouju. Ju used in both the titles means a precious stone that generates all sorts of treasures as you pray and also saves you from pain and sickness. Ju symbolizes the infinite blessings of the Buddha and the Buddhist Scriptures. The temple name originated from the expression of the Buddha's oath that eliminates the sins of people and fulfills their prayers.\n\nIn 1861, Princess Kazu traveled along the Nakasendo and stopped at Otai-juku on her way to her marriage to the Shogunate family for reconciliation between the Imperial Court and the Shogunate. At that time, a boy waiter received a doll from Princess Kazu as a reward; the doll is still well preserved today. (Closed to the public.)\n\nBakery CafÃ© Kokorade is located near the Nakasendo. From the terrace, a vast lettuce field and a panoramic view of Mt. Asama can be seen. The popular products are Danish bread baked with rich butter and salt bread. You can buy and enjoy bread with free coffee at the spacious cafeteria. Feel free to come and shop with children since there is a kidâs space in the shop. Please try Kokoradean inspired by the Nakasendo.\n\nHours: 8:00 - 18:00ã(Opening hours may change depending on the season.)\n\n458-2, Oaza Maseguchi, Miyota-cho, Kitasaku County, Nagano\n\n0267-41-0383\n\nThe Otai-juku Festival is held on August 16 every year.\n\nPrincess Kazu is said to have stopped at the Otai-juku Honjin on her way to her marriage to Tokugawa Iemochi and gave a boy waiter a doll in the shape of a child.\n\nThe festival reproduces this scene with a girl who plays Princess Kazu and the bestowed doll in a sedan chair litter carried by attendants; processions of people wearing clothes reminiscent of those days walk together inside the post town premises. In addition to the procession of Princess Kazu, events such as a bazaar and catching fish by hand will be held on the festival day.\n\nDate: August 16 every year\n\nHours: From noon to 6 in the evening every year, the procession of Princess Kazu starts at 1 p.m. and events including a bazaar and catching fish by hand start from 6 p.m.\n\nMiyota Town, Industry and Economy Division, Commerce, Industry and Tourism Department, 0267-32-3111\n\nThis temple was the family temple of Sengoku Hidehisa, who was a lord of Komoro Domain, and of Naito Masakuni, who was a lord of Iwamurada Domain. The moss-covered five-ring pagoda has a historical atmosphere over 400 years old. The grave and poem monument of Yoshizawa Takaaki, who was a Japanese classical scholar in the mid Edo period, are here. The seated statue of Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata) as the principal image of this temple is designated as a prefectural treasure.\n\nPeople including the elderly and local residents can gather at ease. The traditional culture of Iwamurada-juku on the Nakasendo is handed down here. It opened as a challenge shop in 2014 for young entrepreneurs operating eating and drinking businesses to showcase their skills. An artwork called, \"Kisodochu Iwamurada\", which is the 23rd picture of the 69 post towns of the Nakasendo drawn by Keisai Eisen, is used as their symbol.\n\nIt is on the precincts of Kotakuzan Shinnyuin Shoen-ji Temple that is a branch temple of Chionin Temple of the Jodo sect and transferred and enshrined the Senior First Rank Inari Daimyojin in 1787. It was greatly worshiped when sericulture was a thriving business. Currently, it is famous since it is said that youâll find what you lost if you offer abura-age, which is a piece of deep-fried tofu.\n\nOriginally, this waterfall was on the precincts of Taki Daimyojin Shrine and a great amount of spring water from the base of the big keyaki tree relieved the thirst of travelers who came and went on the Nakasendo. The amount of spring water decreased and it became unavailable for drinking water, but an arbor was built there and used as a resting place. The hall of Fudoson (Acala) enshrined near Otaki was moved to the new hall above the waterfall.\n\nIt is the old main shrine on the precincts of Hachiman Shrine. The main shrine was newly built in 1783, which is when the old main shrine was moved to the current location. Both the building and the wooden tag commemorating the foundation of the temple are designated as important national cultural properties. This shrine is thought to have originally been Koma Shrine that deifies the Migrant Origins of the Koma clan who settled around here and started cattle breeding. The shrine was rebuilt by Shigeno (Toutoumi no kami) Mitsushige who was the lord of Mochizuki Castle in 1491.\n\nOn the precincts are the main shrine, worship hall, Kourasha, Mizugakimon gate and Zuijinmon gate. In the Gakuden (building to store votive tablets) is the Sangaku (votive tablet with a math puzzle) offered in 1780 that is considered the oldest Sangaku in the prefecture. Since there are descriptions relating to Japanese mathematics on the Sangaku, it is a precious historical material that swows mathematics in the Edo period.\n\nThe Furusato Exchange Center promotes cultural activities of local residents and contributes to enhancing cultural education. This facility is also used as a gallery for private exhibitions and group presentations. Please feel free to use this facility as a resting place when visiting Ashita-shuku on the Nakasendo.\n\nHours 9:00 - 21:30\n\nClosed December 29 - January 3\n\nTateshinamachi Town Office, Social Education Department, Social Education Human Rights Policy Section\n\nPhone: 0267-56-2311/Extension 252\n\nLined pine trees still stand along the road for approximately 2 km from a point 1 km to the west of Ashita-shuku to Kasatori Pass. The view of 150 - 300 year old Japanese umbrella pine trees is magnificent. They were planted circa 1604 and a record remains that says supplemental planting was done in 1845. The subsequent investigation found that 229 trees still existed in 1924 and 127 existed in 1974, when they were designated as a natural treasure of Nagano Prefecture; 64 trees existed as of April 2014.\n\nThe official name of this temple is Enichizan Shugakuin Tsugane-ji Temple and this temple was listed as one of the five famous Shinano Tendai sect temples in the Edo period. This temple belongs to the Tendai sect and is said to have been founded by the monk Gyoki in AD 702. After that, the monks Saicho and Ennin established the Tendai Dangisho as a temple to educate scholar monks. Since then, the temple has been a local place of academic learning in the Shinano region and a bearer of cultural and academic exchange with the Kyoto, Kanto and Tokai regions, continuing to the present day.\n\nThis place was used as a honjin and ton-ya through the Edo period. The eldest daughter of Sanada Nobushige (Yukimura) lived here after her marriage with the fourth head of the family who ran this honjin. The main hall, used for honored guests including daimyos, and the front gate (Yakuimon), constructed at the end of the Edo period, still exist. The main hall is thought to have been built in the late 17th century and is the oldest remaining honjin on the Nakasendo. (Since this is private property, it is closed to the public.)\n\nFrom the mid 17th century, the Kamanari-ya was a sake and soy sauce brewery and also used as a post town. The main building has an eye-catching wing wall integrated with an independent small roof called hon-udatsu and the overwhelming open space from the floor to the ceiling inside the building shows thick pillars and dynamic beam assembly. The building is thought to have been built before 1731 and is believed to be the oldest merchant house in the prefecture. (Since this is private property, it is closed to the public.)\n\nThis is the only inn still in business at Nagakubo-juku. Nagakubo-juku is an L-shaped post town located at a point where Tate-machi Town and Yoko-machi Town intersect. The building of Hamadaya Inn is a wooden three-story hatago style building that is very rare as a building in post towns. Spending a comfortable time and taking your mind off everyday life at this inn is refreshing. Offers delicious and homeâmade dishes.

The main building has an eye-catching wing wall integrated with a small independent roof called hon-udatsu and the overwhelming open space and construction inside the building shows thick pillars and dynamic beam assembly. Although the exact period of the construction is unknown, it is thought to have been built before 1731 and is believed the oldest merchant house in the prefecture since there was no trace of replacing the talisman made in 1731. (Since this is private property and being used as a residence, it is closed to the public.)\n\nNagawa Town, Wada Branch Office of Education Board, Cultural Property Section\n\nPhone: 0268-41-6123\n\nIt is located at the Edo side of Nagakubo-juku and the building was probably built between the late Edo and early Meiji periods. Horses were thought to also have been reared here in addition to crop cultivation. The layout of a farming house in the old days can be seen on the first floor; tools used for sericulture and materials about the history of the post town are exhibited on the second floor.\n\nAdmission fee: Free\n\nPhone: 0268-68-3023\n\nThe building was built as an inn in the early Meiji period but failed to open because of reduced traffic on the Nakasendo due to transportation changes. The building is a large two-story building with a characteristic architectural feature where the second floor overhangs the first floor called dashigeta-zukuri. It is open to the public as a resting place for visitors to Nagakubo-juku and also exhibits historical and ethnological materials relating to post towns.\n\nHours: 9:00 - 16:00\n\nAdmission fee: Free\n\nClosed: Every Monday (or on the following day if it falls on a national holiday) and during the winter from December 1 - March 31\n\nNagawa Town, Wada Branch Office of Education Board, Cultural Property Section\n\nPhone: 0268-41-6123\n\nThis place was used as a honjin and ton-ya through the Edo period. Suhe, who was the eldest daughter of Sanada Nobushige (Yukimura), lived here after her marriage with the fourth head of the family who ran this honjin. The main hall used for honored guests including daimyos and court nobles and the front gate (Yakuimon) constructed at the end of the Edo period still exist. Judging from the tall skirted sliding screen, the transom structure and the design details seen in the shoin-zukuri style, the main hall was probably built in the late 17th century and is the oldest remaining honjin on the Nakasendo. (Since this is private property and used as a residence, it is closed to the public.)\n\nNagawa Town, Wada Branch Office of Education Board, Cultural Property Section\n\nPhone: 0268-41-6123\n\nAnnual Festival of Matsuo Shrine as the main place to worship the local shinto deity of Nagakubo. In modern days, Michiyuki, which is the marching of Shishimai (lion dance) all around the post town is held every three years. The dance is performed by dancers dressed as two male lions and one female lion.
