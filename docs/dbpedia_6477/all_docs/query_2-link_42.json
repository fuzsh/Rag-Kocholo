        "text": "An Inn for Experiencing Traditional Culture\n\nEverything that surrounds us in our daily lives is born from the hands of our ancestors and has been handed down through the generations.The warmth of handcrafted living gives us a mysterious sense of peace and comfort.It might be because we can feel the craftsmanâs thought as they carefully crafted each item by using handmade products and imagining the life of the person who used to use them.At Tsutaya, a traditional cultural experience inn, you can immerse yourself into the lifestyle by participating in activities such as weaving, indigo dyeing, chopping wood, cooking rice in a kamado, and more.Life was harsh for those who lived back then, with difficulties and challenges that would change from season to season.We hope that through the experiences at Tsutaya, you will touch upon some of the thoughts and feelings of the people of ancient times.\n\nTsutaya, the traditional culture experience inn, is a private, wholly restored, old house that is available for rent. We have renovated the house to preserve as much of its original atmosphere as possible, so that once you step into the house, you will feel the way of life as it was 110 years ago. Enjoy the experience, read to your heart's content, or simply lie back and enjoy the natural breeze.\n\nExperience the Ancient Lifestyle through Handicrafts\n\nLife at the time, when the Tsutaya building was built, was not as comfortable as it is today. However, even in such circumstances, people sought various measures to make their lives as comfortable as possible.\n\nIn hot summers, people removed fixtures to create breezes, blocked sunlight with reed screens and bamboo blinds, and cooled themselves with the sound of wind chimes. Instead of refrigerators, vegetables were cooled with river water, and the abundant food was dried or pickled in salt for preservation. You can find the ingenuity of ancient people's lifestyles everywhere in Tsutayaâs buildings and experiences. Please come and experience them firsthand.\n\nAccommodation in a historic building\n\nRenovated 110-year-old kimono shop building\n\nThe bath and washrooms have been comfortably renovated while preserving the appearance of the building as it was when it was built. The main pillar, which has a discernible presence in the center of the room, supports the weight of the entire house and allows for a large, spacious room. The thick beams that run along the ceiling are etched with 110 years of history. The openwork carvings on the beams, the braids in the fittings and furniture, and the paintings on the fusuma sliding doors are all beautiful and intricate decorations. This is not only practical in terms of ventilation and lighting, but also allows visitors to experience the lifestyle of the people of that time, who incorporated and enjoyed the beauty of handcrafted work into their daily lives.\n\nA place rich in nature\n\nYou can enjoy the magnificence of nature and the seasonal flowers\n\nUchiyama Gorge, where Tsutaya is located, is lined with unique rocks and boulders such as Hime-Iwa, Napoleon-Iwa, and Rousoku-Iwa, which can be seen from the national highway. In autumn, the contrast between the oddly shaped rocks and colored leaves is even more beautiful, and the sunset is spectacular. Nearby is Enjoji Temple, famous for its hydrangeas, and the Cosmos Road, a 9-km stretch along the national highway where cosmos bloom in profusion, making it a popular tourist spot.\n\nAssociation with Shibusawa Eiichi\n\nThe poem \"Seiten wo Tsuke\" was composed at Uchiyama\n\nSaku Uchiyama has a strong connection with Eiichi Shibusawa. The young Shibusawa often visited Saku for his family's indigo ball business, and had business dealings with many navy blue dealers and cultural figures. On a cliff just outside the inn, there is a stone monument inscribed with the words \"Seiten wo Tsuke,\" which became the title of a major TV drama. The poem is about Shibusawa's spirit and ambition to open up the beautiful but steep Uchiyama Pass, which he crossed on his way to Saku, by comparing it to a tough business road.\n\nLimited to one group per day\n\nLuxurious time spent with your loved ones\n\nThe 110-year-old building is available for private use, so you can spend your time at your leisure as if you were at home. You can lie down on the floor and enjoy chatting until late at night without worrying about anyone else. If you wish, our staff will be happy to show you how to use the tools, how to enjoy the old house, or tell you stories about the old days. This is an inn where you can enjoy your own one-of-a-kind experience.\n\nThe charm of Tsutaya lies in the experience that can only be had here, using equipment and tools as they were used in the olden days. With your own hands and gradually completing each task, you will feel a small but definite sense of accomplishment that is hard to experience in today's life. These various experiences will make your stay in an old private house even more memorable."
