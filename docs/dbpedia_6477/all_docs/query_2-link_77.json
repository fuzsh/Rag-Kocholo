        "text": "Even if you have never actually seen such a scene, somehow it still resonates with you. That is the power of music, isn’t it?\n\nThis piece first appeared in 1946, shortly after the war. It is said to have been composed for a one-time radio broadcast between Tokyo and Ito, Shizuoka Prefecture, as part of an extremely rare radio relay program that was planned at the time. The song was completed the day before the broadcast.\n\nThe story goes that KATOU Shougo, a native of a fishing port town in Shizuoka Prefecture, was asked to write the lyrics on short notice and wrote the lyrics in 30 minutes, which were then received by composer KAINUMA Minoru, who was inspired by the tangerine fields he saw from the train window on the way to Ito station.\n\nThe gentle melody and lyrics will bring tears to your eyes.\n\nIt has been selected as one of “100 Best Japanese Songs”.\n\nI am a Japanese advertising creator. I was born in Tokyo in 1964, the year of the first Tokyo Olympics Games. When I was a kid, I listened to a lot of wonderful “children's songs=douyo-shouka” and made my kids listen to them a lot. I want people around the world to listen to this music. I hope you enjoyed it.\n\nThis website contains affiliate links, which means I may earn a commission if you purchase something through one of my links."
