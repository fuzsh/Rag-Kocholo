        "text": "After 13 months and 3,900km, Justin Barbour has finished a monstrous journey from Hudson Bay in northeastern Canada to Cape Pine, the southernmost point on the island of Newfoundland.\n\n“What a rip in the wilderness,” Barbour wrote on his social media. “It was a journey that just kept on going. Canoe, snowshoe, bike, and hike through one of the planet’s last great wild areas.”\n\nBetter kit, better skills\n\nThis was a journey six years in the making. In 2018, Barbour’s first attempt to cross Labrador from east to west ended when an early winter bogged him down. He vowed to return better kitted out and with more winter experience.\n\n“I want to experience a full year in the northern wilderness,” he told us in May 2023, just before setting off. “To experience the four seasons as the indigenous people of the area have. I felt good physically and mentally in 2018. I had enough summer experience, but my winter skills in the subarctic cold weren’t there yet.”\n\nThe skills are there now. During the 13-month journey, Barbour canoed 1,150km, snowshoed 700km, backpacked/packrafted 550km, and cycled 1,500km.\n\nThe final leg of his journey involved hiking and packrafting south through Newfoundland with his dog Saku. It also featured a close encounter with a black bear. “Close call for Saku with bear and cubs,” Barbour wrote, with roughly 240km to go to Cape Pine.\n\nBarbour arrived at Cape Pine on July 22 after 372 days spent almost entirely in the wilderness."
