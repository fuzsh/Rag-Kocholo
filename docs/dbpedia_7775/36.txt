The site of Tel Qasile was Philistine city built at the mouth of the Yarkon River in modern Tel Aviv. A series of Philistine temples were found here, built on top of each other over the years. Most notable in the design are the columns and the large stone threshold. The temple and much of the city was finally destroyed by fire sometime around the 10th century.
