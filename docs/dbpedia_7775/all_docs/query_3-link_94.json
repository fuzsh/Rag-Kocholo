        "text": "On Tuesday morning I was invited to join fellow GWF member Eran at a small ceremony at the Ten Mills [El Hadar Mill] site on the Yarkon River [Nahr el Auja]. The following is a translation [with some agreed additions & deletions] of Eran's 'Facebook' post describing this event.\n\n(Note: any mistakes are mine)\n\nTen Mills: 1917-2023\n\nby Eran Tearosh\n\nI was present this morning (18.7.2023) at an exciting event on the banks of the Yarkon [Auja River] - the flow of that river's water was returned back to its original course, which had previously fed the El Hadar Mill, better known as 'Esser Tahanot' [Ten Mills]. Some claim that the site is the largest mill facility that existed in the Land of Israel! In an impressive undertaking, the northern part of the mills complex was the project of the Tel Aviv Municipality's Ganei Yehoshua Park, with the assistance of the Fund for Open Areas [part of 'Israel Land Administration'] while the actual field work was carried out by Yehoshua Dray – an archaeologist specialising in the restoration and reconstruction of ancient technologies.\n\nDuring the First World War, at the end of 1917, the El Hadar Mill and the Hadra Bridge next to it, played a particularly important role. In fact, the use of the mill ceased during the war, when the Ottomans damaged it and the bridge, to prevent the passage of General Allenby's forces over them. The bridge was soon restored and played an important role during 1918, but the mill building was never operational again.\n\nOn November 24, 1917, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles [NZMR] Brigade crossed the Yarkon [Nahr el Auja] by the bar near the mouth of the river, and in a short time took control of Sheikh Munis (the southern part of the Ramat Aviv ridge) and Khurbet Hadra (probably the hill in the Revivim neighbourhood, north of the Hadra Bridge. Today at the top of the hill is the 'Pagoda Park'). Following them, several companies of infantry from the 4th and 6th Battalions, Essex Regiment, 161st Infantry Brigade, crossed the river at Jerisha [Seven Mills] and captured Sheikh Munis and Khurbet Hadra, as well as El-Hadar Mill and the Hadra Bridge. The New Zealanders were thinly deployed a little north of the infantry. During the night, the Ottomans concentrated a considerable force [drawn from their 3rd and 7th Divisions] and counter-attacked the British and New Zealand forces north of the river - first at Khurbet Hadra and later Sheikh Munis – and during the morning hours of November 25th, the EEF were forced to retreat back to the southern bank, suffering many casualties. Only at this point did a British artillery unit [Somerset Battery, 18th Brigade, RHA] arrive in the area and help the machine gunners cover the retreat. During the excavation of the mill, a British artillery shell was discovered, still embedded in the wall of the building; (see photo).\n\nA month later, on the night of December 20-21, 1917, Allenby's forces crossed the Yarkon [Nahr el Auja] River once again. This time the task was assigned to the British 52nd (Lowland) Division and the force participating was many times greater than it had been in November. This successful crossing of the Yarkon River is nothing short of a military nonpareil, worthy of a separate article (and maybe even a booklet!). The most important and main characteristic of its success was that it was carried out secretly and silently, crossing the river at three points. To divert the Ottomans' attention from what was happening, two open attacks were carried out east of the successful crossing points, and the largest and most important of these was at Ten Mills, where the Ottomans held a small bridgehead south of the river. The very next day [22nd], the bridge at Hadra was roughly repaired by the British army engineers [410th Company, RE] and played a central role in the EEF activity north of the Yarkon River until the late summer of 1918.\n\nHowever, the El Hadra Mill was not restored and did not resume operation again. The mill was slowly covered by vegetation and silt, until it was recently rediscovered. In order to allow the work of excavating the site, a temporary dam was erected which channelled the natural flow of water into a by-pass channel. This morning, the Tel Aviv mayor breached that temporary dam. The river water then began to flow back to the mill building and once more through the arches (where the paddle wheels, which turned the mill stones, were previously located), in a way similar to that in which the water had flowed at this place for so many generations until the First World War.\n\nA huge thanks to those involved in the work and a special thanks to my friend Yehoshua Dray, who adds another amazing project to the not-so-short list of his achievements.\n\n… … … … … ... ... ... ... ... ...\n\nA description of the mill and its mechanism\n\nThe inflow is via six arches\n\nThe out-flow is via channels which slope downwards to increase the force of the water turning the paddles operating the mill stones\n\nLooking down towards the outflow\n\nLooking up back towards the inflow\n\nThe shell which we think is almost certainly from the Somerset Battery, RHA\n\nFor a short video clip go to:- https://www.facebook.com/ganeiyehoshua/videos/3545790199081683/?extid=CL-UNK-UNK-UNK-AN_GK0T-GK1C&mibextid=36u7dV\n\nMy thanks to Eran for the opportunity to attend this fascinating event - Michael\n\nFrom https://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/_transcript/2013/D17572/a5979.htm\n\nMitchell Library, State Library of New South WalesWalter James Urquhart diary and orders, 24 October-6 December 1917\n\nMLMSS 3050/Item 1 [Transcriber’s note:\n\nWalter James Urquhart was born in 1894 in Brisbane, Queensland.

It relates to the Turkish attack on Wilhelma. I'll relate to the rest in a minute.\n\nSteve – Thanks. I already looked into quite a few NZ sources, including the 3 regimental histories. Lt.-Col. Powles's 'The New Zealanders in Sinai and Palestine' doesn't add a thing regarding the artillery. Same thing with Terry Kinloch's book 'Devils on Horses'.\n\n___________________________________\n\nThe discussion was about the artillery during the first crossing of the Auja River, trying to determine whether the shell that can still be seen in the Mill's wall is of the Somerset Battery, or perhaps one of the batteries of the 54th Division. Of course, this is an opportunity to have a closer look at the wider aspect of the artillery during this action. Michael – We've been doing the work parallelly… The record you found is great and it does add a few details to the general picture, but mostly on the artillery.\n\nYou asked about the following, but bear in mind that this relates to the afternoon hours of November 25th, after things calmed down a bit. So far, I haven't found details of artillery locations on November 24th. From what I found so far, the 54th Division's R.F.A. Brigade involved on November 24th was CCCLXX (270) Brigade:\n\nOP at Z 30. – I guess that O.P. stands for Observation Point. Z 30. Is Bulfin Hill (Today within Bnei-Brak)\n\nHowitzer Batty 4.2 and 'B' Batty 18 pdrs., 270th RFA Bde, F 25 c – The location is a little east of Bulfin Hill.\n\n2nd Field Batty J 6 c. [which battery is this?] – The location is a little south of Bulfin Hill. I don't know which Battery this is.\n\n6-inch Hows J 2 c – location is a bit north of Sarona. Somewhere near Arlozorov St.\n\n13 pdr battery 750 yds south of Summeil. [which battery is this? Somerset???] This is map ref J 1 c, or J 7 a – You're right on the location. It's not the Somerset Battery – they had 18-pounders and belonged to the ANZAC Division, not 54th.\n\nLH Bde 13 pdrs. in support vicinity of Point 275. Map ref J 10 d – You're pointing at Dahr Selmeh (Point 279). That's the high ridge in today's Givataim. I took the Society to that place during one of the Field-Tours a few years ago. I don't know if this Battery belonged to the 54th Div. or to the ANZAC Div.\n\nInverness Batty will on arrival be placed in reserve in H18 – Center of today's Tel-Aviv. This battery belonged to the ANZAC Div.\n\nAs to understanding the different 54th Division's batteries – I found it very confusing. Maybe this link can help a bit: https://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/cclxx-cclxxi-cclxxii-howitzer-and-cclxxiii-brigades-of-the-royal-field-artillery-54th-divisional-artillery/\n\nAnother option is to go to Wikipedia. As I wrote – very confusing.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nI found several references to the CCLXX (270) Brigade R.F.A. Following are a few sources:\n\nIn the BOH (Falls & Becke), Vol. 2, Part I, pages 214-215 relate to November 24th:\n\n\"The heavy artillery could not be brought up in time, but the 270th Brigade R.F.A. (less one battery) of the 54th Division was temporarily transferred to the A. & N.Z. Mounted Division.\" An interesting remark states that the 3rd Light Armoured Motor Battery (LAMB) was involved in the capture of Hadra Bridge – Probably by fire from the left (South) bank.\n\nPages 215-217 relate to November 25th:\n\n\"… and his (Turk) pursuit was checked by the fire of the Somerset Battery…\" (page 216). A few lines down we find: \"In this case also the artillery did good service in checking the Turkish pursuit, particularly the Somerset Battery, the commander of which, Major M. Clowes, remained on the right bank observing for his battery until the last moment, and had to swim across\". At the bottom of page 216 we find: \"The 270th Brigade R.F.A. was moved to bivouac after the crossing, and arrived on the scene of action the following day too late to be of much service, the whole artillery defence thus resting upon a single horse-artillery battery\" (meaning the Somerset Battery).\n\nOn the Wikipedia page of the1st Suffolk Artillery Volunteers Corps, I found the following:\n\n\"Nahr el Auja\n\nDuring the night of 23/24 November, the pursuing ANZAC Mounted Division was ordered to seize a bridgehead across the Nahr el Auja supported by A and C/270 Btys. The two batteries moved up rapidly and began bombarding the bridge while the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade forded the river and attacked from the far side 'in a most spectacular charge over a little hill behind the bridge. It was a capital battle' in the words of an officer at 270 Bde HQ. The Turks counter-attacked the following day and 270 Bde was recalled from its bivouacs to re-occupy its positions of the previous day, which A and C/270 managed in 70 minutes from the first alarm. From an observation point known as Z30, effective fire was brought down on the Turks. Thereafter, 270 Bde became the basis of an artillery group positioned to support ANZAC Mtd Division along the river\".\n\nNotes there relate to Lt-Col J.D. Sainsbury's book, The Hertfordshire Batteries, Royal Field Artillery: An Illustrated History 1908–1920, pages 69-70. I don't have this book, so if someone has it – please (Can buy it for 10£, but shipping fees are 15£ more… Ouch).\n\nNext is Alan Smith's Allenby's Gunners. From this book, I couldn't really find anything significant. There are several references to the Somerset Battery, but nothing that helps us.\n\nThe 54th Division creates a challenge for research, as a Divisional History was never published. However, most of the Division's battalions are mentioned in their Regimental Histories, which is not great, but better than nothing. The exception to this is the Essex Regiment, as four of its Territorial battalions (4th, 5th, 6th and 7th) formed The Essex Territorial Infantry Brigade – The 161st Brigade of the 54th Division, which published, as a part of the series of the Essex Regiment Histories, a book of their own, by John Burrows. A chapter is dedicated to The Combat of the 'Auja (Starting p. 254). As far as the artillery is concerned, this is what I found there, first the general description:\n\nP. 254, referring to November 24th: \"The 270th Brigade, R.F.A., were disposed on the south bank to give support to the Anzacs\".\n\nP. 255: \"The situation seemed so quiescent that the 270th Brigade, R.F.A, were informed that they bivouac\".\n\nP. 255, referring to November 25th: \"The 270th Brigade, R.F.A., were also ordered into action, but before they were able to unlimber the enemy (8 a.m.) attacked Kh. Hadra with a force estimated between 4,000 and 5,000…\". A few lines down: \"The Aucklanders escaped being cut off by galloping over the sea ford under the cover of the machine guns of their Brigade and the fire of the Somerset Battery\"\n\nAfter the general description, each battalion wrote its own part. First the 4th Essex:\n\nP. 257, referring to November 24th: \"About 3 p.m., after a few short bursts of shell-fire from the horse artillery, the Anzacs galloped across the ford…\". A few lines down: \"The artillery withdrew to Sarona\".\n\nP. 258, referring to November 25th: \"The artillery were recalled to support the infantry, although short of ammunition, and commenced to shell Kh. Hadra. An artillery observation post was established with \"A\" Company, 1/4th Essex, on a hill known as Z30, and that company was then pushed up to the Mill and Bridge. A counter-attack was decided upon with artillery support\". Further down the page: \"For some unexplained reason, communication by flag signal between the two battalions and with the artillery broke down\".\n\nStrangely, the 6th Essex, even though giving a much more detailed account, almost doesn't mention the artillery:\n\nP. 262, referring to November 25th: \"Then large numbers of the enemy were observed approaching from the north-east and it gave us a certain amount of pleasure to see the Field Artillery shelling them and dropping their 18-pounder shells right among the masses of Turks who were coming over high ground on our front well out of rifle fire\".\n\nEran\n\nEdited 23 July , 2023 by Eran Tearosh"
