        "text": "Cornelius, a Roman centurion, was the first Gentile convert to the faith. He was stationed at Caesarea on the Mediterranean coast at the time when the apostle Peter was actively working in the spread of the Gospel.\n\nA centurion in the Roman army normally had charge of 100 men (= to an Army captain). A regular cohort was one tenth of a legion and had a paper strength of 600 men. An auxiliary cohort was usually comprised of 1,000 men. Cornelius was of the Italian cohort. There is inscriptional evidence for the “Italian cohort” from Syria (See Bruce, 215).\n\nWhen Paul set sail from Caesarea for Rome he was accompanied by a centurion of the Augustan cohort named Julius (Acts 27:1). All of the centurions mentioned in the New Testament make favorable impressions. This was not true of soldiers generally (Luke 3: 14). Note these examples:\n\nThe centurion at Capernaum (Matthew 8:5-13; Luke 7:2-10).\n\nThe centurion at the crucifixion of Jesus (Luke 23:47).\n\nF. F. Bruce (The Book of Acts, NICNT) cites Polybius (History vi.24) saying,\n\n“Centurions are required not to be bold and adventurous so much as good leaders, of steady and prudent mind not prone to take the offensive or start fighting wantonly, but able when overwhelmed and hard-pressed to stand fast and die at their post.”\n\nThere is a wonderful performance in the early second century A.D. hippodrome at Jerash, Jordan. The RACE show (Roman Army Chariot Experience) shows actors dressed as Roman soldiers performing various activities of the early soldiers. Our photo shows a Roman centurion from that show.\n\nOnly one of the Gospel accounts of the ministry of Jesus records a visit by Jesus to the town of Nain. Strangely it is Luke who wrote two volumes (Luke and Acts of the Apostles) to a man known as Theophilus (Luke 1:3; Acts 1:1).\n\nJohn, who was a personal eyewitness to the ministry of Jesus, included only seven miraculous signs of Jesus in his gospel. He exaggerated for the sake of emphasis, “Now there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written” (John 21:25 ESV). In addition to the resurrection of Jesus, John included the account of the resurrection of Lazarus in John 11.\n\nI find it intriguing that Luke mentions this account of the resurrection of a young man as his mother was on the way to bury him. Luke was a physician who became what we might call the primary physician of the apostle Paul (Colossians 4:14; 2 Timothy 4:11; see also the “We” sections of Acts where Luke is traveling with Paul.\n\nScholars have written about the medical language of Luke used in his two volumes.\n\nOn our visit to Israel earlier this year I stopped to make a new photo of the town of Nain on the north side of the the Hill of Moreh.\n\nThe New Testament site of Antipatris was known as Aphek in Old Testament times. It is the place where the Philistines were encamped when they took the ark of the covenant from the Israelites who had camped at nearby Ebenezer (1 Samuel 4:1).\n\nAntipatris was built by Herod the Great and named in honor of his father Antipater.\n\nBecause Aphek/Antipatris sat on a major south-north and west-east routes, it was dominated by many nations. The dominant feature of the site today is the Turkish fort. Inside are the excavated ruins of buildings from Canaanite to Herodian/Roman times.\n\nAphek/Antipatris is known by the modern name Ras el-Ain because it is located at the source of the Yarkon River which flows a few miles into the Mediterranean.\n\nWhen a plot was raised against Paul while he was in the Fortress of Antonia in Jerusalem, he was sent by night to Antipatris. The next day he was escorted to Caesarea Maritima. Luke records the event,\n\nSo the soldiers, according to their instructions, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris. And on the next day they returned to the barracks, letting the horsemen go on with him. When they had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him. (Acts 23:31-33 ESV)\n\nFrom Jerusalem to Antipatris is about 30 miles. From there to Caesarea Maritima is an additional 27 miles.\n\nPaul would remain in custody at Caesarea Maritima for two years. We probably realize that the wheels of power often turn slowly.\n\nThe map below is used courtesy of BibleMapper blog.\n\nThe expression used as our title may seen strange to modern man, but it was clearly understood in biblical times. Notice two biblical verses:\n\nBut they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid, for the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken. (Micah 4:4 ESV)\n\nIn that day, declares the LORD of hosts, every one of you will invite his neighbor to come under his vine and under his fig tree. (Zechariah 3:10 ESV)\n\nCommenting on Zechariah 3:10, Hailey says,\n\nUnder one’s vine and fig tree was a symbol of peace enjoyed in the midst of safety and security (1 Kings 4;24-25; Isaiah 36:16), promised by Jehovah through Micah in the kingdom of the Messiah (4:4).” (Hailey, Homer. A Commentary on the Minor Prophets. Baker, 1972, p. 337).\n\nThe biblical record explains that Sennacherib, king of Assyria, was the dominant power in the region.For he had dominion over all the region west of the Euphrates from Tiphsah to Gaza, over all the kings west of the Euphrates. And he had peace on all sides around him. And Judah and Israel lived in safety, from Dan even to Beersheba, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, all the days of Solomon. (1 Kings 4:24-25 ESV)\n\nSennacherib, king of Assyria, urged the people of Judea,\n\nDo not listen to Hezekiah. For thus says the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me and come out to me. Then each one of you will eat of his own vine, and each one of his own fig tree, and each one of you will drink the water of his own cistern, until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. (Isaiah 36:16-17 ESV)\n\nWe still see examples of people living under their own vine and fig trees in the Bible Lands today.\n\nWe might compare this to the modern expression, “We have a good job and have been able to buy a house and have enough to pay for the groceries.”\n\nA Request: This blog is sent to you at no charge.

The Valley of Lebonah is where the remnant of the tribe of Benjamin caught the daughters of Shiloh (Judges 21:16-25).\n\nThe biblical text provides detailed information about the location of this event.\n\nSo they said, “Behold, there is the yearly feast of the LORD at Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, on the east of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.” (Judges 21:19 ESV).\n\nOur photo today was made from the hill on the west side of the valley of Lebonah. In the distance you will see Tel Shiloh on top of the natural hill.\n\nThe apostle Paul was of the tribe of Benjamin (Philippians 3:5).\n\nThe tabernacle stood at Shiloh for 300 years. Archaeological excavations are now being conducted by the Associates for Biblical Research under the direction of Dr. Scott Stripling. For more details on the next season of excavation see here.\n\nAphrodisias, located in southwest Turkey, was an ancient city of Caria in Asia Minor. It is not mentioned in the Bible, but is close to the cities of Laodicea, Hierapolis and Colossae. Robert F. Tannenbaum, an ancient historian, describes the location of the city this way:\n\nA quiet, fertile valley folded into the Mediterranean hills, clear streams, tall poplars, ancient ruins more than 1,400 years old—a picture of pastoral quiet. (Biblical Archaeology Review, Sept/Oct 1986)\n\nThe map above is cropped from the set of BibleMapper maps now available at\n\nhttps://biblemapper.com/blog//. Aphrodisias is clearly marked.\n\nThe site has been excavated since 1966, beginning under the direction of Kenan Erim of New York University. Marble was readily available at a nearby quarry and the excavation has brought to light a multitude of marble inscriptions and statues from the Roman period including a statue of the Emperor Domitian. Buildings include a theater, an agora, a bath, temples, and a well-preserved stadium.\n\nLouw-Nida describes a stadium as an “open, oval area (frequently including a racetrack) around which was built an enclosed series of tiers of seats for those who came to watch the spectacles – arena, stadium.” When Paul spoke of running the race in 1 Corinthians 9:24, he used the Greek term stadion. The term was also used as a measure of distance and is found in John 6:19. It was about one-eighth of a Roman mile. Most large Greek and Roman cities had a stadium. The figure of the stadium is in mind in Hebrews 12:1-2, where a host of witnesses watch as we run the race.\n\nTherefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,\n\n2 looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.\n\n(Hebrews 12:1-2 ESV)\n\nThe stadium at Aphrodisias is the best preserved I have seen and I wanted to share with you the photo I made in 2012. Picture yourself in the stadium.\n\nDamascus Gate is the main one of three gates on the north side of the Old City wall in Jerusalem. The gate we see was built over a gate from the early second century when the city was rebuilt by the Romans, and likely over the earlier gate from New Testament times.\n\nThe gate is called Damascus because this formerly was the way one would depart Jerusalem to head for the city of Damascus. Paul may have used an earlier gate when he made his way to Damascus to locate and bind followers of Christ and bring them to Jerusalem for trial (Acts 9, 22, 26).\n\nA monarch with his foot on the neck of a subdued enemy is a common motif in the ancient near east. An illustration such as this helps us visualize certain Biblical texts.\n\nHere I wish to use an illustration from the Roman world shortly after New Testament times. In the statue below we see the Emperor Hadrian (A.D. 117-138) with his foot on the neck of a subdued enemy.\n\nThis statue is displayed in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum. It is made of marble and is said to have come from Hierapitna, Crete.\n\nThe photo below is a closeup of the captive with the Emperor’s foot on his neck.\n\nIn the New Testament, Peter quotes Psalm 110:1 to show that Jesus is now seated on the throne of David at the right hand of God (Acts 2:35).\n\nThe apostle Paul understood this. He said of Jesus,\n\nFor he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. (1 Corinthians 15:25 ESV)\n\nThe last enemy is death (1 Corinthians 15:26).\n\nThe illustrations here and in other posts are suitable for use in PowerPoint presentations for sermons and Bible classes. We only ask that you leave our credit line intact so others will know how to reach our material.\n\nFor examples from the Old Testament see here.\n\nSurely a greater percentage of tourists who have visited ancient Corinth have stopped at the Corinth Canal for a photograph. The canal was constructed between 1881 and 1893. A much smaller number probably recall that there was an ancient paved road, called the diolkos, on which smaller boats could be dragged across the isthmus.\n\nPettigrew (Corinthian Matters) says that Strabo uses the term diolkos of the narrow land strip, rather than a physical road.\n\nInterestingly, the modern use of the term “diolkos“ is one of the great misnomers of modern scholarship. Strabo uses the word in a geographic sense to describe a land strip visible from Acrocorinth and equivalent to the narrowest part of the Isthmus. No one in antiquity associated the term with the physical road.\n\nThe cargo of larger ships was unloaded and carried across the isthmus and reloaded. Ships that could be dragged across the land bridge avoided the 200 mile journey around the Peloponnesus. Nero abandoned his attempts to dig a canal across the isthmus in A.D. 67. Josephus records that 6,000 of the strongest men involved in the Galilean revolt were sent to Nero, “to dig through the Isthmus [of Corinth]” (JW. 3.540).\n\nThe diolkos was in use during the time Paul was at Corinth. The commercial benefit to Corinth, as well as to the port cities of Lechaion and Cenchrea, was significant.\n\nAnd he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. (Acts 18:11 ESV)\n\nI like these photos because because they remind me of the ministry of the Apostle Paul at Corinth (approximately A.D. 51-53).\n\nA Google Map showing this region may be seen here."
