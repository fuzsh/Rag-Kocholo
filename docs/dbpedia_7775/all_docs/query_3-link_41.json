        "text": "The hostel’s design concept comes from its location at the Tel Aviv Port, right on the mouth of the Yarkon River. This inspired the choice of colorful containers anchored in port before heading out to sea. As an alternative to expensive luxury hotels, the SPOT provides low-cost accommodation with the added value of content and community. There is a bar-restaurant, reception, games area, stage and movie room, and in the accommodation area there are 86 capsule rooms in varying sizes, as well as a tent area and many laid-back chill-out corners. The rooms are decorated in pleasant and quiet tones to create a calm environment in a small space. The public areas are brightly colored, with different textures, various kinds of flooring, and graphic elements on top of the containers. The colorful and bold design produce a vibrant and young character appealing to a diverse crowd from different parts of the world."
