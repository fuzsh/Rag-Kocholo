        "text": "Second part. A look around Tel Aviv and the area around the airport, then off we go. At the end of the first part, our AI friend had taken off and here he is heading off over the city towards the coast\n\nAnd this is the view back to the airport from the edge of the city where he's flying\n\nFrom Wiki - \"Tel Aviv-Yafo (Hebrew: תֵּל־אָבִיב-יָפוֹ, romanized: Tēl-ʾĀvīv-Yāfō [tel aˈviv ˈjafo]; Arabic: تَلّ أَبِيب – يَافَا, romanized: Tall ʾAbīb-Yāfā), often referred to as just Tel Aviv, is the most populous city in the Gush Dan metropolitan area of Israel. Located on the Israeli Mediterranean coastline and with a population of 460,613, it is the economic and technological center of the country.\n\nTel Aviv is located around 32°5′N 34°48′E on the Israeli Mediterranean coastline, in central Israel, the historic land bridge between Europe, Asia and Africa. Immediately north of the ancient port of Jaffa, Tel Aviv lies on land that used to be sand dunes and as such has relatively poor soil fertility. The land has been flattened and has no important gradients; its most notable geographical features are bluffs above the Mediterranean coastline and the Yarkon River mouth. Because of the expansion of Tel Aviv and the Gush Dan region, absolute borders between Tel Aviv and Jaffa and between the city's neighborhoods do not exist.\n\nThe city is located 60 km (37 mi) northwest of Jerusalem and 90 km (56 mi) south of the city of Haifa. Neighboring cities and towns include Herzliya to the north, Ramat HaSharon to the northeast, Petah Tikva, Bnei Brak, Ramat Gan and Giv'atayim to the east, Holon to the southeast, and Bat Yam to the south. The city is economically stratified between the north and south. Southern Tel Aviv is considered less affluent than northern Tel Aviv with the exception of Neve Tzedek and northern and north-western Jaffa. Central Tel Aviv is home to Azrieli Center and the important financial and commerce district along Ayalon Highway. The northern side of Tel Aviv is home to Tel Aviv University, Hayarkon Park, and upscale residential neighborhoods such as Ramat Aviv and Afeka.\"\n\nPut it another way, it's a gert big built up strip along the coastline, as you can see here\n\nI'm using the SamScene Israel package, and I assume most of the signature buildings here are from that\n\nThe port at the mouth of the Yarkon River\n\nFinally (I hear you thinking) - a plane! Time to head off\n\nSlightly fish-eyed view back towards the airport. We're over the Yarkon here\n\nBusy looking place\n\nBeautiful setting. Like most of the planet, seems a shame people and their hormones seem determined to screw it all up (hey, I'm just an old hippie at heart).\n\nAway we go\n\nTwo more parts to come. I'm aware that these pix might look a bit blah on a smaller monitor, but I do run big screen and this sort of detail works fine there. And these pics are primarily for me!"
