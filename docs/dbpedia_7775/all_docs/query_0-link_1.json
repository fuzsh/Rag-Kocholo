        "text": "Yarqon River, river in west-central Israel, the principal perennial stream flowing almost entirely within the country. The name is derived from the Hebrew word yaroq (“green”); in Arabic it is known as Nahr Al-ʿAwjāʾ (“The Tortuous River”). The Yarqon rises in springs near Rosh Ha-ʿAyin and flows westward for about 16 miles (26 km) to the Mediterranean in northern Tel Aviv–Yafo. It marks the boundary between the Plain of Sharon (north) and the coastal lowlands (south). The seasonal watercourses west of Rosh Ha-ʿAyin, which form part of the drainage system, extend eastward into the West Bank. They include the Wadi Shillo (Dayr Ballūṭ) in the east, usually considered by geographers to mark the boundary between historic Judaea and Samaria, and the Wadi Ayyalon (Aijalon) in the southeast. In the valley of the latter, according to the Bible, the moon stood still during Joshua’s conquest of the Amorites (Joshua 10).\n\nThe Yarqon basin was the centre of several 19th- and early 20th-century Jewish settlements, including Petaḥ Tiqwa, Bene Beraq, Ramat Gan, and Tel Aviv, that have grown into cities. It was also the site of several important British victories over the Ottoman Empire in the conquest of Palestine during World War I. At the mouth of the river, in Tel Aviv, a shallow-draft port was built during the prolonged strike of the Arab port workers of Jaffa (1936); after World War II, however, it was abandoned.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nA View of the Middle East"
