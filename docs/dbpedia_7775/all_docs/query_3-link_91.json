        "text": "In the best of financial times, taxpayers are justified in their suspicions of political junkets. Too often, these publicly funded trips are barely disguised vacations for government officials, payoffs to political cronies and private power brokers, or a way to cement a politician’s public profile among various key constituencies.\n\nBut in tough financial times like these – with local governments planning massive service cuts and fee hikes – junketeers are all the more obligated to prove that their field trips are truly worth the public’s money.\n\nThat is especially true of Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa’s weeklong trip to Israel in June, which will be paid for by the city’s airports, port, and water and power departments.\n\nTo be sure, there are conceivable, legitimate travel expenses for government officials, especially in such a massive and complex city as Los Angeles. The Mayor’s Office cites the trip to Israel as a chance to bring city leaders up to speed on developments in aviation, security and environmental sustainability – all valid city concerns.\n\nThat said, the details available so far don’t go far enough to justify the untold thousands in taxpayer funds this trip will cost.\n\nOn its face, for instance, it seems unnecessary to send about 20 city officials – including two City Council members who ought to be able to pay for their trip out of their own travel funds – to sign a seemingly symbolic agreement “linking” the revitalization of the Los Angeles River to Tel Aviv’s Yarkon River.\n\nAnd even the parts of the trip that promise to deal with more substantive matters are of questionable value.\n\nIn addition to admiring the river, city officials will be getting security advice from Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport, unequivocally one of the world’s most secure facilities. Applying Israel’s renowned security standards to Los Angeles International Airport, a two-time terrorist target, is a commendable goal. But if that’s the case, wouldn’t it make more sense to bring L.A.’s airport police chief along? Or even to bring the appropriate Israeli experts to Los Angeles to train Los Angeles police directly?\n\nAll in all, it’s hard to measure the benefits of this trip. Likewise, it’s hard to gauge whether those benefits are worth the cost, because the Mayor’s Office hasn’t volunteered a price tag. As of Thursday, a mayoral spokesman said the cost was still being tabulated, which is to say, the city has committed to an expense without even first determining what it is.\n\nBut if previous mayoral trips are any indication, there’s little reason to think that taxpayers will be getting a good deal. In 2002, then-Mayor James Hahn took an entourage to Asia and had little to show for it except the promise of some Chinese golden monkeys for the L.A. Zoo. Six years later, those monkeys still haven’t arrived.\n\nAnd in 2006, Villaraigosa led a 45-person delegation on an Asian junket of his own. The journey included numerous public signings and meetings, but it’s unclear it yielded any tangible benefits that wouldn’t have been achieved anyway – save for a great travel experience for those involved.\n\nWhich is why, in the weeks ahead, Villaraigosa and his aides should closely scrutinize the attendees, schedule and costs of their Israeli adventure. At a time when the city is asking all of us to make do with less, city leaders should be setting an example of fiscal austerity in their own behavior.\n\nThere are legitimate reasons for city officials to travel on the public’s dime – but politics and R&R aren’t among them."
