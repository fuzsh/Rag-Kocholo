        "meta_description": "This tour visits areas often missed by tourists and operates only from October to May. The unique tour takes you to the Biblical city of Jericho where you’ll learn of the Battle of Jericho when the city walls fell. Also see the sycamore tree mentioned in the Biblical tale of Zacchaeus. Stop at Elisha’s Spring that supplied Jericho with fresh water for centuries. At Tel Jericho see where the city was first established and learn how 23 previous settlements have been excavated dating back to c.9000BC. Ride a cable car to the top of the Mount of Temptation and see the mount’s Greek Orthodox monastery. Visit Qaser el Yahud on the Jordan River where John baptized Jesus. Today visitors can also be baptized here. End the day at the Dead Sea where you can relax and enjoy the natural health and beauty benefits of the salt and mineral-rich sea.",
