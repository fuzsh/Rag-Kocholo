        "text": "Tel Aviv, Israel is the country’s second largest city and a dynamic, lively, multicultural dynamo. It’s one of the major financial centers of the Middle East, and is also known for its cafes and dynamic nightlife. For runners, Tel Aviv’s principal attraction is its location on the Mediterranean. A highlight is the 8km promenade along the beach. Other running highlights include the 8km path along the Yarkon River into Yarkon Park, and the grassy median along famous Boulevard Rothschild. We’ve also included some fun neighborhood and market runs, and some opportunities to get some breathing room in suburban Herzliya and the Ben Shemen Forest. There is a jogging track at Sportek, on Rokach Blvd. If you’d like to have an in-person guided running experience in Tel Aviv, we highly recommend our friends at Go! Running Tours.\n\nFor transportation, the city is congested and parking expensive. There is a very good bus system that is extensively used. Tel Aviv also has an improving train system, with four stops along the Ayalon Highway. Trains run to the airport, Haifa to the north, and to Jerusalem.\n\nOne of the great urban beach runs in the world. Run ~4 mile promenade path between Tel Aviv Port and Midron Yaffo Park in old Jaffa. The beach itself is also great for running. Very festive, tons of people!\n\nVery pleasant, green paths on both sides of the Yarkon River, which runs from Yarkon Park near Tel Aviv University and Tel Aviv Port, connecting with the path along the sea.\n\nA great opportunity to see some of Tel Aviv’s important sites while running 3+ km miles along the median of one of the city’s most famous streets. Connects to the Neve Tzedek neighborhood, Jaffa, and sea.\n\nNice running in the Neve Zedek neighborhood, off Rothschild, using historic Shabazi St. Also, run the winding streets of the Carmel Market and the Kerem -- ONLY when the market is closed!\n\nThe second largest green space in Tel Aviv after Yakron Park. Pleasant paths, wide lawns, and a pond that make this a nice spot for running. One can put together a ~4 km non-overlapping route here. In the southeastern part of the city.\n\nA prosperous residential area in Tel Aviv with nice streets for running. Good connections to a marina and beach promenade. Herzliya Park is a nice green space with a 1km running path.\n\nA good destination run for those desiring trails and shade. Located halfway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, at 5,000 acres there are miles of trails, including 32 km of bike trails suitable for running.\n\nOne of the great urban beach runs in the world. Run ~4 mile promenade path between Tel Aviv Port and Midron Yaffo Park in old Jaffa. The beach itself is also great for running. Very festive, tons of people!\n\nTel Aviv has a combination Mediterranean and desert climate. Summers are hot and humid, with high temperatures averaging 90F+ (32C), and hardly any rainfall between May and October. Winters can be rainier, with average high temperatures in January around 60F. Nighttime temperatures in winter can be cool, but rarely below freezing. Generally the weather is good all year for running but be aware of the summer hear and humidity.\n\nTel Aviv is an important business center and is also a popular tourist destination. There are plenty of hotels, mainly clustered in the city center near Rothschild Blvd., and in the western part of the city along the coast. Our recommendation is to stay in one of the beach side hotels if possible, allowing access to wonderful waterfront running. If you stay toward the northern part of beach toward the Port of Tel Aviv, there’s also good access to the Yarkon River paths and park.\n\nThe main independent running store in Tel Aviv is Pro Runner, located near Yarkon Park. Great selection of running clothing. There are also Nike running store and Newton Running.\n\nPro Runner is the main independent running store in Tel Aviv. Great selection of running shoes and clothing. Social events as well.\n\nNewton Running. Another great running store in Tel Aviv. In the eastern part of the city, not that centrally located.\n\nThe running scene in Israel continues to grow and there are many running events in different parts of the country.\n\nArticle on Israel’s most important running events.\n\nTel Aviv Marathon. February. Major event with 40,000 runners. Great course along the water and central Tel Aviv.\n\nTel Aviv Night Run. November. Very popular 10k, attracting 25,000 runners.\n\nNatal Color Run. Part of the Color Run series. 5k run with the aim of raising awareness of PTSD as a result of terror and war in Israel."
