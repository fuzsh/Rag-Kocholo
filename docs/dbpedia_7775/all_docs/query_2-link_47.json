Arriving passengers ascend through bridges at the gates to a mezzanine level overlooking the concourses and the rotunda, then descend towards passport control through the connector.",

        "text": "/ Built\n\nAs the main gateway to Israel, Ben Gurion International Airport is designed as a sequence of spaces characterized by a profusion of natural daylight, with ceremonial arrival halls, dramatic communal gathering areas and lush feature gardens. The Airport brings together a land-side terminal accommodating ticketing, customs, immigration, and baggage claim; an air-side complex including a ramping connector linking the landside facilities; and a spacious rotunda accommodating dining and retail facilities. Concourses radiate from the rotunda to the gates.\n\nCareful consideration was given to the reduction of level changes for both arriving and departing passengers.
