        "text": "There are so many things to see and do in Tel Aviv! The White City is found on the Mediterranean Sea and has a rich culture, beautiful architecture, and hospitable people. The largest city in Israel brings in millions of visitors each year. Not only is it the gateway to the Holy Land, but it is also the welcoming city for Start-Up Nation.\n\nGiven this, there is truly so much to do and see in Tel Aviv. We have spent a long time in Tel Aviv as we started our year-long adventure abroad. Making Tel Aviv our de facto home at this time has allowed us to truly enjoy everything this city has to offer. So below are some of our favorite must-see things on your next visit!\n\nEnjoy Cafe Culture\n\nAs you already know about our time in Buenos Aires, we LOVE cafe culture. While in Tel Aviv you will be able to find to go coffee unlike many other places, I strongly urge you to lean into the relaxing in the morning with cafe culture. Tel Aviv is a sleepy city, so you won’t see many people in the early morning. Most cafes are starting to set up in the early morning.\n\nThere are so many cafes with lots of seating outside. You’ll see sidewalks with tables and chairs corresponding to different cafes. Most cafes will also have fresh baked goods as well as sandwiches. Early in the morning, you can often smell the freshly baked goods as you stroll down the sidewalk. Definitely get your baked goods heated up whenever possible. Of course, if you’re in a rush, then you can take your coffee and pastries to go (then head to the beach).\n\nTaste All the Local Foods\n\nOne of the best parts about traveling is getting to try all the local foods. Tel Aviv is a foodie city! There’s plenty of food to try out, like the ones listed below. Additionally, Tel Aviv is a very vegan-friendly city.\n\nHummus\n\nOne of the best things to eat in Tel Aviv is the Hummus. There are several restaurants that only make and sell hummus. They are absolutely delicious. Usually have lemon and olive oil drizzled over the hummus for added flavor. The spicy hummus is our favorite. We also learned that locals eat hummus with raw onions as well.\n\nBaked Goods\n\nThere are SO many delicious baked goods to try in Tel Aviv. The bakeries will have racks and racks filled with trays of freshly baked pastries. We enjoy picking a wide selection in order to taste as many as possible. It can be challenging to know what you may be getting since everything is in Hebrew, but that’s part of the adventure.\n\nCheck out all the foods and pastries to try in Israel here!\n\nFalafels\n\nKnown as Israel’s “favorite snack food”; falafels are a must-have. They are a ground chickpea, herb, and spices mixture that are deep fried. These little balls are so incredibly delicious! You’ll be able to find them at many different local falafel stands. At the stand, they are put into pitas with various toppings. The toppings include salad, pickled cabbage, onions, pickles, tomato, tahini, hummus, and harissa. Finally, there are pickled veggies that you can add to your pita.\n\nThere are also options in which you only order pita and some dips. The absolute best falafels are the ones that are freshly made and warm when served to you. Shuk Carmel has one of the best falafel stands. We are lucky enough to have an incredibly fresh falafel stand downstairs from our apartment.\n\nShawarma\n\nProbably my most favorite street food in Tel Aviv. We luckily have a shawarma stand on the corner of where we live and I’m pretty sure they know us there now. You’ll find some stands that only sell shawarma, or that sell both shawarma and falafels. There are lamb, chicken, and turkey options.\n\nShawarma is thinly sliced and spiced meats rotating on a vertical rotisserie. At a shawarma place, you’ll choose the type of bread you want your shawarma in. We prefer the traditional pita, but there are other options. Then you pick toppings. The options include hummus, salad, harissa, pickled cabbage, etc.\n\nYogurt\n\nYogurt in Israel is so delicious! While in the US we only have sweet yogurts, Israel also has savory yogurts. Similar to Greek yogurt, there is Labne. Labne is a savory yogurt that is topped with olive oil and spices. It is a great dip! It is such a popular yogurt that there are whole restaurants that serve both savory and sweet yogurts.\n\nEven the yogurt in supermarkets is delicious! Some are so smooth they’re almost like pudding. You’ll also find yogurt in many dessert shops. They have flavors you won’t find at home, like pistachio.\n\nPita, Pita, and more Pita\n\nThe fresh pitas at the bakeries are unparalleled. There are so many bakeries throughout Tel Aviv, and they offer so many delicious baked goods. But you must try the freshly baked pitas. Made in a super hot pizza-type oven, these pitas are incredible. They are fresh, warm, and perfect with hummus. Do not skip out on the pita!\n\nCheck out all the food you must try in Israel here!\n\nLearn of Israeli and Jewish History in the Many Museums\n\nOne of the greatest things to do and see in Tel Aviv is to learn about its deep history. There are many wonderful museums in Tel Aviv that depict the history of Israel and the Jewish people. Many of the museums are located on the Tel Aviv University campus. There is so much history in Israel, Tel Aviv is no exception. Some of the best ones to check out are the ANU Museum, Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Bauhaus Museum, and Beit Hatfutsot.\n\nExplore the Local Shuks\n\nShuk Carmel\n\nBy far the most popular Shuk or farmer’s market in Tel Aviv. It is also the largest one. We’ve visited all the farmer’s markets or shuks in Tel Aviv, and this one is the largest and most complete. To see our thoughts on the other markets, check out our post here.\n\nShuk Carmel boasts many streets full of stands. These stands include fresh, seasonal fruits and veggies, lots of spices, jewelry and accessories; varieties of desserts; butchers; and so many freshly baked pastries and breads. There are also fresh juice stands and food stands. You’ll find one of the best falafel stands here! Finally, in the streets nearby, you’ll find a bunch of different cafes and restaurants.\n\nOne of the best ways to enjoy the shuk and see everything there is to see is by taking a tour. This tour includes lunch. There is also this fantastic walking tour that goes through the history of Shuk Carmel.\n\nSarona\n\nThis is really more like a food hall rather than a farmer’s market like Shuk Carmel. There are several Shuks in Tel Aviv that are a must do thing in Tel Aviv. Sarona Market offers a wide option of restaurants from Hawaiian food to German food and even Mexican food.\n\nIf you visit Sarona in the morning, you can enjoy some coffee shops and bakeries. The bar also offers coffee. There are a couple of cheese shops and other specialty supermarkets within Sarona. You’ll find an Asian market, a nuts & spices market, a fish market, and a butcher as well. Outside of Sarona, there is a Templar Colony with many other stores.\n\nLearn all about the many markets in Tel Aviv here!\n\nEnjoy the Sparkling Sea\n\nTel Aviv’s 15 beaches span 8.7 miles. The beautiful Mediterranean Sea to the west is a great thing to see in Tel Aviv. You can walk from the city center right into the Sea. There is a boardwalk that takes you up the length of the beaches. The boardwalk goes from Jaffa all the way to the northern part of Tel Aviv.\n\nOn weekends, the beaches will be most busy. People enjoy running or walking up and down the boardwalk. There are playgrounds for kids and exercise equipment for adults. Additionally, there are three dog beaches that allow dogs to be off-leash. Dogs are also welcome on the other beaches.\n\nMany of the beaches have lockers, beach chair and umbrella rentals, and even kayak and paddle board rentals. There is a spot to rent sailboats. Several beaches have restaurants on the sand. Additionally, all the swimming beaches have lifeguards. The sand is incredibly soft. I absolutely love taking walks along the beach in the morning; it is one of my favorite things about Tel Aviv.\n\nCheck out our guide of the Tel Aviv Beaches here!\n\nOld City of Jaffa\n\nThe Old City of Jaffa truly looks like where Disney got their inspiration for the Middle East. The buildings and cafes are so charming they look like they came straight out of a movie. There is so much to see, starting with the iconic Clock Tower. One of the best ways to tour Jaffa is by bike. This biking tour is definitely the one to take.\n\nOur favorite Hummus restaurant (Abu Hassan Hummus) is also in Jaffa. There is nothing like warm and fresh hummus for lunch or a snack. Additionally, Jaffa has some wonderful cafes and bakeries. You’ll see people sitting outside enjoying the weather and a cup of coffee. Finally, there is plenty of shopping as well in Old Jaffa, especially at the flea market.\n\nFlea Market\n\nEvery day, the vendors put out their wares for the sale. This is a great place if you’re interested in seeing lots of random items. If you’re also interested in trying your hand at bargaining, this market is for you! Jaffa’s flea market is definitely a must-see thing in Tel Aviv. You’ll find jewelry, clothes, electronics, china, cups, and toys.\n\nPort of Jaffa\n\nOld Jaffa Port is known as one of the oldest ports in the world. It is believed to be the same location as the Biblical story of Jonah and the Whale. This port has a long and fascinating history. Today, it is largely used by local fishermen who continue the centuries-old tradition of fishing in this area. Additionally, it has remained an iconic landmark and cultural attraction for tourists.\n\nFor more history in Israel take the train to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv to explore the Old City of Jerusalem.\n\nExplore Tel Aviv Port\n\nTel Aviv Port is a fun, lively place to see and experience in Tel Aviv. It is the intersection of the sparkling blue sea, markets, and restaurants that makes it such a fun place. Additionally, it is a popular place for events and festivals, as well as its club and bar scene.\n\nThe wooden boardwalk is part of the beach boardwalk that connects Tel Aviv from north to south. People can be seen running, biking, or rollerblading along. Plus, there are some carousels and other kid friendly activities as well at the port. People enjoy fishing off the pier as well. In the summer, shops and restaurants are open late to take full advantage of the warm summer nights.\n\nTel Aviv port is located in central north Tel Aviv. Its southern edge is at Metzizim Beach, and it runs 1 KM northward to the mouth of the Yarkon River as it empties into the Mediterranean. At its north is the Wauchope footbridge, which takes you to the Old Reading power station and lighthouse.\n\nExperience All the Many Neighborhoods\n\nTel Aviv is an extremely walkable city. There are so many neighborhoods with so much to do and they are so close together. Definitely get your walking shoes on and head out to explore Tel Aviv. There are many wonderful walking tours that can get you through Tel Aviv.\n\nOld Jaffa & Neve Tzedek\n\nYou’ll get lost in gorgeous streets and areas. Old Jaffa, in the south, is the oldest neighborhood of Tel Aviv. It is rich in history and beauty. Neve Tzedek is just north of there with beautiful, Instagram-worthy walkways. It is a perfect place to spend the afternoon shopping or stopping for the best croissants in the whole city (Alexander Bakery). This Old Jaffa and Neve Tzedek Walking Tour is a great way to explore this part of the city.\n\nFlorentin & Central Tel Aviv\n\nMeander through the Florentin neighborhood. There are many graffiti-lined streets and the beautiful HaYarkon Park. It is the perfect place to ride a bike or enjoy a picnic. It is always busy on weekends. Then, walk up and down Rothschild Boulevard. It snakes up to Habima Theatre. People enjoy relaxing on the grass or in the garden that plays relaxing classical music. Additionally, there are coffee shop stands that dot the boulevard. It takes you near Ibn Gabriol Street, which has many great restaurants.\n\nCentral Tel Aviv also features King George St, which is a busy street full of shopping and restaurants. The largest mall in Tel Aviv, Dizengoff Center, is found here. Down the street from the mall is Dizengoff Square, and in the other direction is Rabine Square. These are two of the major centers of Tel Aviv.\n\nOld North & Across the Yarkon\n\nOld North is a charming, historic neighborhood. It has our heart as it was the first neighborhood we live in when we arrived to Tel Aviv. Ha’Medina Square has plenty of local shops to explore. Additionally, the best pizza shop is in Old North! It is truly an iconic neighborhood full of Bauhaus-style homes. As you get further north, you’ll hit the Yarkon River and then Tel Aviv University. Here is where most of the museums of Tel Aviv are. Finally, you’ll also get to Ramat Aviv Mall for additional shopping.\n\nGet a local perspective of the neighborhoods of Tel Aviv with this private tour.

There are new festivals and events every year! Of course, you can find anything from music festivals with DJs or top Israeli bands to art festivals. For New Year’s Tel Aviv hosts a giant party as well. Additionally, you can participate and enjoy many religious holidays. As the Holy Land for several religions, you really do get to experience many important religious and cultural events.\n\nFinal Thoughts about Things to Do in Tel Aviv\n\nTel Aviv is a lively city with so much to do! There are so many things to see in Tel Aviv. As one of the largest cities in Israel, this city has plenty of things to do for every visitor. From food to activities, a trip to Tel Aviv can truly be jam-packed. Additionally, Tel Aviv isn’t a very large city, which allows you to really see all corners of the city.
