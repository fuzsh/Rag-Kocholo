        "text": "Other sailor nationals preferred\n\ndeath to eating the spawn of demon-witch-whores,\n\nbut when the Spanish sailors raided the potato stores\n\nColumbus carried back, they avoided scurvy.\n\nYou have to start somewhere, and this will do,\n\nsince history was created to explain you.\n\n(Columbus's voyage—to add to the mix—\n\nwas underwritten by a Spanish salt tax).\n\nI'd wanted, in this way, to document\n\nthat two hundred varieties once grew in Peru\n\nand the Incan Empire created the method\n\nof freeze drying by stamping their moisture out,\n\nexposing them to sun, these chuño, and letting\n\nthem freeze and thaw, then stamping them again.\n\nThat's how Mrs. Orsak's flabby arms came to plop\n\neventually, a reconstituted spoon of potato pulp\n\non the square slot of my cafeteria tray—\n\nat 45 cents a subsidized lunch in Texas, 1979.\n\nThe potato flakes retain the shine, when shaken\n\nfrom their box, of the winter Andean skies,\n\nunder whose supervision freeze drying was begun.\n\nSublime Incan utensils formed from native\n\nclay had eyes, and growing from the eye-threads,\n\nroots, and from the roots the heads of gods.\n\nThey may be viewed in Lima's Museo Larco\n\nin subterranean store rooms, loose along\n\nthe shelves, among the agile os and tongues\n\nof ceramic corpulent couples, whose\n\nflexibility of flesh and morals\n\ncaused many such pots to be smashed by conquerors,\n\nwho were \"mortified,\" thus rendering this\n\ncollection \"all the more important.\" Tonight the eyes\n\nare cut. My father says to do it. He says\n\nthat you must cut and let the edges dry.\n\nThat if you plant when the cut edge is\n\nmoist, it will rot. I remember how we\n\nused to store them in the sand under a house\n\nraised on cement blocks in Texas. How once my\n\nmother crawled beneath, edged her hand into the storage box,\n\nand agitated a nest of baby rattlesnakes.\n\nI don't remember her turning pale and sick,\n\nI recall getting whipped with a leather belt\n\nafter crawling there myself. But then I did\n\nnot remember how we acquired seed\n\npotatoes either. There were none available\n\nin Tel Aviv last night, so I bought cooking spuds on Basel\n\nstreet, wrapped in plastic, in oxidized\n\ncardboard, not Styrofoam, and we cut the eyes,\n\nand the indentions that look like eyes, gently\n\nwashing the black earth off, and scratching to see\n\nwhat lay beneath. And saving some, too, to eat,\n\nthe parts clean shaven, no eyes. The dumb and\n\nbeautiful skin. Catherine the Great also forbade\n\nthe peasantry from growing potatoes, then had\n\npotatoes planted on her land, up to the trees,\n\nposted sentries instructed to accept bribery,\n\nand that's how the potato spread across the\n\nUkraine. In a failed sonnet I once wrote:\n\nAcross the Ukraine, tea-stained, broken teeth\n\ntore the flesh; hands pounded it to dough\n\nand boiled it until it sank and slowly rose.\n\nFrederick the Great threatened with knives the noses\n\nand ears of the Irish to force them to plant.\n\nAnd thus the ground was fertile for the famine.\n\nThen three times a day for eight months, Antoine\n\nParmentier, French army pharmacist,\n\nwas fed only \"hog's fodder\" in a Prussian\n\nprison. Later, in the gardens of Versailles\n\nhe gave Marie Antoinette a papery blossom.\n\nThe scene makes a pretty prelude to the appetizers,\n\nsoups, entrées, and desserts he composed\n\n(200 of them) exclusively from potatoes.\n\nKing Louis XIV and Marie invited\n\nnobility to dine. Since peasant\n\ncooperation was the aim of this banquet,\n\npeasants were forbidden by parliament\n\nto cultivate potatoes. Parmentier planted\n\nhis behind a wall and instructed\n\nhis armed guards to accept every bribe,\n\nand to gift potato blossom nosegays to each bride.\n\nHe was right, of course, and so were they;\n\nthe blossom is diminutive but pretty,\n\nthreaded through the hair, a saucy pink.\n\nYou wouldn't think\n\nso, if you bought potatoes today,\n\non sale, as I did, standard shapes\n\nas stout and straight and graded as a girl\n\nwho, half a century later, isn't beautiful,\n\nalthough she can't believe it (you should know\n\nshe once was)—but once potatoes were gnarled\n\nas this narrative, with shapes as uncontrolled\n\nas the deities they embodied in their native world.\n\nI bought mine in a red net with a gold\n\nlabel depicting fries, pale as an old\n\nday because—much time's elapsed since I began—\n\nand classroom Hanukkah festivities demand\n\nI send my child with a peeled semblance\n\nof this once-heretical root, domesticated\n\nfor latkes. My calendar's terribly reduced.\n\nAnd Parmentier also published his knowledge\n\nof cornmeal, chestnut flour, grain storage,\n\nmushroom culture, mineral waters,\n\nbread-baking, cheese-making,\n\nwine-making\n\n(he also improved sea biscuits).\n\nAt Montdidier, his bronze\n\nstatue surveys the Place\n\nParmentier from its high socle,\n\nwhile below, in full marble relief,\n\nseed potatoes are distributed\n\nto a grateful peasant\n\nas a present.\n\nI'm roasting new potatoes in their jackets\n\nthis morning with sprigs of rosemary\n\ntorn from the neighbor's invasive phalanx\n\nof a shrub, and salt from the local sea.\n\nTo be salted with the salt of the palace\n\nis to be in the employ of a king:\n\nand for five years I've been salted with the salary\n\nof Tel Aviv. Sometimes I forget about the sea\n\nthat every evening swallows its pink balled sun\n\nwhere the mouth of the Yarkon River joins the port,\n\nwhile, on threads along the Park Hayarkon,\n\ncircus performers climb and spin and drop.\n\nThe river's mouth is probed by a cone\n\nof light from Tel Kudadi, a Bronze-age fort\n\nguarding this twist in the ancient Via Maris\n\nin which I live, between Memphis and Damascus.\n\nThe rosemary, too, means dew of the sea,\n\nfrom ros and mar, which explains why it won't\n\nremain within my neighbor's garden boundaries,\n\nthough I strike with shears when it begins to choke\n\nmy (also native) greens. On every coastal\n\nroad the fragrance runs ahead; inland from the valley\n\nof Gehenna to Jerusalem's walls which the Romans rent\n\ntill no two stones stood. Ascent's a scent."
