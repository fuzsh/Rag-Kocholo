        "text": "The Authority requests the public to avoid entering or swimming in the river for two main reasons:\n\nThe Yarkon River today is a functioning ecosystem after years of comprehensive ecological restoration in all its aspects. The river hosts a variety of animals and plants, including the Yarkon tilapia which is the most sensitive fish to water quality conditions in the system. The Yarkon water in the upper section is fresh water that is discharged from boreholes – the entry of humans into the water creates disturbances and spot infections in the same section, damages the ecosystem and disrupts animal activity. Most of the channel of the Yarkon River is in a declared national park for the benefit of nature conservation and the ability to enforce regulations to prevent damage to the river area. For further restrictions and guidelines please contact the Nature and Parks Authority.\n\nThe Yarkon River channel is an open and unfenced system that drains the large catchment basin in the catchment basins of the coastal streams. Therefore, the creek is exposed to events of pollution from various sources along the creek. Relevant law enforcement monitors river water quality and handles pollution incidents and malfunctions. However, since the creek is an open system that constitutes a large-scale catchment basin, spot pollution events cannot be completely prevented.\n\nThe Yarkon River Authority samples the Yarkon River once a week in the saline section adapted for sailing, between the “Seven Mills” dam (Ganei Yehoshua Park Tel Aviv) and the Yarkon estuary, and with varying frequency of sampling in other sections along the river – according to the sampling procedure for water quality in streams of the Ministry of Environmental Protection. In addition, there is a station for continuous monitoring of water quality in the middle section of the river, in the area between Tel Aviv and Bnei Brak.\n\nYarkon water sampling data are published on the Authority’s website, under the “Water Quality Sampling” tab.\n\nThe Yarkon River today is not a polluted river.\n\nThe damage to the Yarkon in the past began in the late 1950s. . At that time, the Yarkon water was pumped for private use and this caused the river to dry up. The damage to the river worsened with the development of the cities around it. The river became a drainage channel into which sewage and effluents of poor quality were discharged.\n\nThe Yarkon River Authority began its activities in 1991, and has been working for the past 30 years to rehabilitate the Yarkon River, the flow channel and its banks, to improve water quality and to develop the river area for community and educational activities.\n\nThe Yarkon River today is a functioning ecosystem after years of comprehensive ecological restoration in all its aspects. The river is home to a variety of animals and plants, including the Yarkon tilapia, which is the most sensitive fish in the water quality system. On the website of the Yarkon River Authority, you will find details about the projects promoted by the Authority and additional information about its activities in various areas for the benefit of the Yarkon Preservation and the development of the river from an ecological, environmental and community point of view.\n\nThe two main factors that can be pointed out as sources of pollution that today endanger the restoration of the stream and the ecosystem are: 1. Faults in the sewage systems in the communities along the stream; 2. The first rain that washes the pollutants from the roads and the urban area and drains them into the environment and streams.\n\nThe Yarkon River Authority is working together with government ministries and bodies in charge of environmental protection to specifically prevent pollution incidents, and to promote long-term solutions to the real dangers facing the rehabilitation of the Yarkon River.\n\nThe Yarkon River Authority cleans the area under its responsibility per its foundation order (20 m on each side of its banks), and within the river channel itself. The local authorities are responsible for cleaning the municipal area up to the river bank, without the riverbed.\n\nThe cleaning in the summer months takes place 6 days a week in light of the load of visitors who frequent the stream area.\n\nIn winter, cleaning operations are carried out in sections that can be reached (the Yarkon area is not accessible during the winter months due to winter pools and saturated soil).\n\nAt the end of the rainy season, the riverbed is cleaned along its entire length."
