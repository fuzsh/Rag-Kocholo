        "text": "I lived in Tel Aviv in both 2015 and early 2019, and as of October 2019, now live here full-time (still current as of 2024!) and it is, without a doubt, my favorite city in the entire world. Tel Aviv has anything you want in a vacation or living environment; beaches, history, nightlife, food scene and walking distance to everything. The zest for life that Tel Avivians, and Israelis in general (more on that in my Israel Travel Blog here) have is nothing like I have ever seen. I could talk about Tel Aviv all day everyday, but I tried to keep this Tel Aviv blog somewhat condensed. Generally when people visit Israel they only spend 2 or 3 days visiting Tel Aviv but I would argue you need AT LEAST 5 days in a Tel Aviv itinerary to immerse yourself in the bustling city. Keep reading for the ideal Tel Aviv itinerary.\n\nDisclosure: This Tel Aviv travel blog may contain affiliate links. I may receive commissions for purchases made through links in this post. As always, all opinions are my own and I would never post about something I have not personally used/verified.\n\nTel Aviv Blog: Tel Aviv Travel Tips\n\nFor all of my Israel travel tips head to my Israel travel blog here (and there are a lot of tips).\n\nThe main airport in Tel Aviv (and in the whole country of Israel) is Ben Gurion Airport (TLV). Train and Taxi are your two options to get to the city.\n\nA taxi is my go-to to get to Tel Aviv from the airport. The airport is about a 25 minute ride to the city of Tel Aviv and should be around ~150-170 shekels normally, and around ~190-200 shekels on Shabbat/middle of the night. It is easier to get one directly from the taxi line as soon as you exit the airport and turn left to the authorized taxi lines. Do NOT go with anyone who comes up to you and says they are a taxi. You have to download the Gett Taxi app (more details later) to get the taxi and then you can pay by card in the app or with cash.\n\nYou can also take the train which is a direct train to any of Tel Aviv’s 3 train stations, however the stations are on the border of Tel Aviv meaning you will have to then take a taxi or bus to your accommodation. The train is a cheaper alternative from the airport for sure, but keep in mind on the location of where your accommodation is.\n\nIf you are just visiting Tel Aviv I do not suggest renting a car in Israel as parking is hard to come by in Tel Aviv and you do NOT need a car by any means for any Tel Aviv activity. However, if you are exploring the country of Israel (which I suggest, duh) then read my Israel car rental guide on my country guide here.\n\nDownload Gett app. Gett was made in Israel and is the primary way to get around Tel Aviv and Israel in general. They do not use Uber or Lyft in Israel so Gett makes it super easy. Gett just uses taxis in Tel Aviv but it makes it easier because you can pay by credit card. Speaking of which…\n\nCabs in Tel Aviv will either give you a set price to your destination within the city or you can choose meter when you get in. I always would choose meter (if I don’t use Gett) because they will rip you off. ESPECIALLY if you are speaking in English and they know you don’t live there. Always do meter. Also most cabs do not accept credit cards, it’s cash only, which is why I like having Gett!\n\nDownload Bird or Lime: Scooters are huge in Tel Aviv and one of our main way of transportations. There are bike lanes on almost every street now and the scooters come with helmets.\n\nTRAVEL INSURANCE: Unfortunately, things can and do go wrong when you travel. World Nomads offers coverage for more than 150 activities as well as emergency medical, lost luggage, trip cancellation and more. Buy at home or while traveling and claim online from anywhere in the world. We receive a fee when you get a quote from World Nomads using this link. We do not represent World Nomads. This is not a recommendation to buy travel insurance.\n\nTel Aviv Packing Tips: Tel Aviv is HOT and HUMID in the summer and mild in the winter. It can always be beach weather, even in winter. Sunscreen is an absolute must during any visit to Israel. My favorite face sunscreen ever is this Sunbum stick (buy here). I think I own 5 of them and they last forever. They’re the best for travel since its solid too! For more of my fave packing items I bring on any trip compiled together, head to my influencer page on Amazon here for a complete list or my descriptive carry-on packing guide here or my favorite travel gear here or the best travel items you need under $20!\n\nTEL AVIV ITINERARY: THE BEST THINGS TO DO IN TEL AVIV ISRAEL\n\nShuk HaCarmel (Carmel Market)\n\nA MUST! The famous Shuk HaCarmel (open-air market) in Tel Aviv is by far one of the best things to do in Tel Aviv and the number one spot not to miss on a Tel Aviv Itinerary. Come to the Tel Aviv Shuk HaCarmel (Carmel Market) any day of the week to shop for anything you could ever think of (clothes, home goods, antiques, candy, falafel, hummus, fruits) and the freshest produce and food. I urge you to try the food in the Shuk, specifically: strawberries (in winter), falafel and halva. Some of the best restaurants are also on the OUTSKIRTS of the Shuk so make sure to weave in and out of the alleys, too, not just the main road! This is also where you will find all of your tourist gifts you could ever want to buy to bring home (IDF sweatshirts, evil eye and hamsa bracelets, keychains and more). I also HIGHLY suggest taking a food tour when visiting the Shuk to really immerse yourself in the history of the Shuk and each of the food stalls. Delicious Israel runs the best food tours I highly recommend (have done it twice!), you can read my review on the tour lower in this guide!\n\nA true local Tel Aviv experience is going to the Shuk on Friday morning right before Shabbat when it is bustling and beyond crowded. Also spending all day here on Fridays is the thing to do – have a drink at one of the many spots on the alleys of the Shuk and people watch until sundown.\n\nTEL AVIV INSIDER TIP: Negotiating the price of what you’re buying is a 100% must at the Tel Aviv Carmel Market! They will always come down.\n\nTEL AVIV INSIDER TIP: If you are a looking to buy produce and food, the farther down in the Shuk you go towards the end, the cheaper the price.\n\nTEL AVIV INSIDER TIP: If you are walking on the outskirts of the Shuk and see the floor is RED, that means you are in the meat section!\n\nWalk (or scooter) the Tel Aviv Promenade (Tayelet)\n\nWalk the whole length of the Tel Aviv Boardwalk (better known as the Tayelet, which technically translates to Promenade). The Tel Aviv Tayelet stretches all the way from the port of Tel Aviv (the Namal) in the North of Tel Aviv all the way down to Jaffa in the South along the Mediterranean Sea. The Tayelet is such a gorgeous place to run, bike, scooter or walk and, for obvious reasons, has the best sunset views. This is one of my top things to do in Tel Aviv every single day. I could walk along the Tayelet forever. Scooters (or Korkinet in Hebrew) have also become wildly popular thanks to Lime, Bird and Wind definitely rent one and ride up and down (in the bike lanes!!).\n\nJaffa (Yafo)\n\nJaffa (Yafo) is the southern tip and oldest area of Tel Aviv. It is an absolute must-visit to add into your Tel Aviv itinerary travel time as the history is tremendous and shows a different side of Tel Aviv. You need to spend a good part of a full day visiting Jaffa and all that it has to offer especially since it is also up and coming (there are THREE new luxury hotels that have opened in the past year (18/19). While visiting Yafo, you should do the following:\n\nWalk around theJaffa Port.\n\nGet lost in the Jaffa cobblestone alleys up and down from the Port to the top while stopping in cute boutique stores.\n\nShop at the Jaffa Flea Market (Shuk HaPushPashim) (my favorite name ever). Here you will find everything from antiques, jewelry, furniture and more.\n\nSee: the Zodiac Fountain, the Gate Of Faith and the Jaffa Clocktower.\n\nEat at a Middle Eastern restaurant with lots of small plates (see below for my recommendations).\n\nHead to Abu Hassan for the voted best hummus in Tel Aviv (but get there as early as possible because they close as soon as they run out (usually near 2pm) since they make it daily!).\n\nWalk to the top of the hill from the bottom and turn around to see the stunning views of the Tel Aviv skyline.\n\nWalk across the Wishing Bridge and find your astrological sign, hold it and ask for a wish and it will come true!\n\nFavorite Jaffa Restaurants to stop at for lunch include Puaa and Beit Kandinof!\n\nRelated Post: One Day In Dubai Itinerary\n\nShuk Levinsky (Levinsky Market)\n\nLevinsky Market is another one of the best things to do during your Tel Aviv travels that, in all honesty, most people do not get to on their first visit to Tel Aviv but should. A lot of people focus on the beaches and the Carmel Market BUT Levinsky Market should be on EVERYONE’s Tel Aviv itinerary! Levinsky Market Tel Aviv is one of the oldest markets in the country and is located in Florentin (more on Florentin later) and is totally different than the Carmel Market. Shuk Levinsky is a market dedicated to Israeli spices, nuts and fruits as well as popular Turkish and Greek foods (there are two different sides of the street for each of these). It is one of the much more popular local things to do in Tel Aviv (why I love it) and open-air. You won’t find tourist souvenirs here. I also HIGHLY suggest doing a Food Tour in Levinsky Market (more on that in Food Tour section below).\n\nSome of my favorite spots and foods you must try in Levinsky Market are: Levinsky 41 (Cafe Levinsky) for a Gazoz Drink (flavored fresh soda water with an Israeli twist), Yom Tov Deli for olives and vegetables (get the hibiscus flower wrapped goat cheese it is insane), Halva Magic for Halva, duh, Burekas Penso for amazing Burekas and Saluf & Sons for Yemenite Kubaneh.\n\nRabin Square\n\n[As of 2023 Rabin Square is under construction for the new metro line so you may have to walk a bit farther and in between streets to find the memorial] Rabin Square (Kikar Rabin) is probably the most famous square in Tel Aviv and is largely historical. It is a big square in Tel Aviv on one of the main streets, Ibn Gabirol. Most importantly, you must check out the Rabin Memorial Monument at the edge of the square which has an exact replication of how Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination was carried out in 1995. It is incredibly somber and powerful to see the exact movements of this terrorist act and how it occurred. Rabin Square is also extremely lively at nighttime as there are tons of shows and events for various holidays and also peaceful protests are held here often whenever there is something to protest about in Israel (which is often)!\n\nRothschild Boulevard\n\nRothschild Boulevard is Tel Aviv’s oldest street and by far the prettiest street in Tel Aviv. It is lined with trees in the middle and has walking/biking paths. It is such a gorgeous and historical street to walk around. If you walk to the end of it (South) you’ll get to Florentin and the Neve Tzedek neighborhoods and on the other side (North) all the way at Kikar Habima (Habima Square), near Dizengoff Center. At the top of it (South) there is a tourist booth where you can take a DIY walking tour pamphlet to read while walking down Rothschild and it will tell you some important facts as you’re walking! There’s a metal strip down the street how its Independence Road. Rothschild is also a hub for Tel Aviv’s famous nightlife with a ton of bars and clubs lining the street on the South end.\n\nIndependence Hall\n\nTel Aviv Independence Hall is one of the only historical museum-type spots most people visit on Israel tours. It is a must-go just for the history lesson of Israel becoming a country and its independence. It is on Rothschild Boulevard and you really only need less than an hour here.\n\nRelated Post: Israel Country Travel Guide\n\nTel Aviv Port (Namal)\n\nNamal translates to port and this is in the Old North of Tel Aviv. It is the main port of Tel Aviv (and Israel) and you can walk around it. There are a lot of nice restaurants, bars and clubs on the Namal as well with great outdoor seating. There are also a ton of stores to shop at. Definitely suggest walking around the Namal for part of a day. There are always people walking, running or biking around here and the Namal at night is beyond lively.\n\nTel Aviv Beaches & Sunsets\n\nObviously the main Tel Aviv point of interest to tourists are the beaches! The beaches of Tel Aviv are some of the best in the world and stretches a vast NINE miles and you can find different types of beaches (13 of them!) for all interests. Tel Aviv sits right on the Mediterranean Sea and this long coast also gives way to some of the best sunsets since it faces West. One of my favorite things to do is sit at the Tel Aviv beach restaurants (like LaLaLand, Calypso, Hilton Beach) and order watermelon and feta and a bottle of rosé. Watermelon is Israel’s summer fruit and you will see everyone eating it on the beach! My personal favorite Tel Aviv beach is Gordon Beach which is right by the Sheraton Hotel and has LaLaLand restaurant right on it. It also has lots of umbrellas, chairs, right in the center of the city and great food.\n\nSome of the best Tel Aviv beaches to people watch are Gordon Beach (LaLaLand restaurant is one of the better beach restaurants), Frischman Beach (a lot of French people head here), the Dog Beach (aptly named), Hilton Bay Beach (the new up and coming trendier beach) and Banana Beach. You can’t go wrong anywhere. You can just walk on to any beach wherever you are staying closest to as well! You don’t need passes as they’re not private.\n\nYou can buy a lounge chair for 16 shekels (~$5), a regular chair for 6 shekels (~$2) and an umbrella for 18 shekels (~$6). You have to buy them at the machines attached to each beach restaurant building. The beaches in Tel Aviv are amazing and I urge you to camp out there for more than one day of your trip to relax. And watch the Tel Aviv sunsets. They never ever get old.\n\nShopping in Tel Aviv\n\nThere is SO much good shopping in Tel Aviv. Head to Sheinkin Street for the most trendy street with the best boutique shopping in Tel Aviv. Head to Dizengoff Street, one of the main streets in the city that is lined with stores and a million restaurants and bars. Make sure to walk on Dizengoff Square right in the center, it was just recently reopened after being refurbished in 2019! Head to Neve Tzedek for the most upscale and expensive shopping in Tel Aviv. One of my FAVORITE spots to shop & one of the best things to do in Tel Aviv is to go to Nachlat Binyamin Street (next to the Carmel Market) on Tuesdays and Fridays. There is an outdoor market on these days with stands set up by local artists and designers selling their goods. It is the BEST local Tel Aviv shopping and I have bought so many gifts and home decor and pieces here. A must.\n\nRelated Post: What To Do In The Negev Desert and South Of Israel\n\nSarona Market\n\nSarona Market is somewhat new (<5 years) and is in Central Tel Aviv. It’s basically a food complex and is a bunch of great food/snack places, drinks and shops to check out and just walk around during the day. It reminds me of Chelsea Market in NYC. The Market is an indoor complex with a bunch of spots to choose from and then surrounding the indoor market there is a HUGE outdoor space with more shops and restaurants. It’s a really popular lunch spot since it’s near a lot of Tel Aviv offices. There are about 90 stalls inside so take your time choosing what to eat!\n\nFlorentin and Neve Tzedek Neighborhoods\n\nFlorentin is a hipster neighborhood in Tel Aviv mostly known for their street art/graffiti (and also Levinsky Market, above). If you are a street art person definitely walk around Florentin Tel Aviv and get lost looking at the amazing Tel Aviv street art! Neve Tzedek is the most chic and trendiest (and most expensive) neighborhood of Tel Aviv. It’s home to some of the most posh stores and restaurants as well. The cobblestone streets of Neve Tzedek make it my favorite though. The main street to walk along in Neve Tzedek is Shabazi Street. You also must stop at Anita’s and have their famous gelato here.\n\nHaTachana\n\nThe HaTachana (translates to train station) is an area near Neve Tzedek that used to be an old train station! They repurposed it to be a really cute complex to walk around with a bunch of stores, bars and restaurants! It’s pretty cool how they built this area on top of old tracks and some of the trendiest restaurants and bars in Tel Aviv are in the HaTachana.\n\nHaYarkon Park\n\nHaYarkon Park is in the North of Tel Aviv. My favorite part of the park is that it’s not a tourist destination at all; you’ll almost solely find Tel Aviv locals here. You can find people kayaking on the Yarkon River, walking around the parks and playing sports throughout. The botanical gardens and large concert venues here also make for a great setting for any activity. The park was one of my favorite places to go during my spare time and is a true Tel Aviv local spot.\n\nRelated Post: Day Trips From Tel Aviv\n\nWhere To Eat In Tel Aviv\n\nOne of the best things to do in Tel Aviv is EAT! I am so beyond obsessed with the Tel Aviv food I plan my trips and itineraries around where I am eating in Tel Aviv! I have FINALLLLY finished my MASSIVE beyond massive Food Guide to Tel Aviv. After 10+ visits and living here three times, I know my Tel Aviv food. In the guide, I go in depth into all the cuisines, where to eat for any type of meal you may be craving and more. You can literally find ANYTHING you want to eat in Tel Aviv and this Tel Aviv food guide has it all. I listed a few of the best below in case you are skimming quickly but I highly recommend you read the full guide so you find your perfect spots for your Tel Aviv itinerary.\n\nVisit my massive FULL FOOD IN TEL AVIV GUIDE here!\n\nBest breakfast/brunches:Café Xoho, Bucke Cafe and Yom Tov Cafe\n\nBest street food lunch: HaKosem, Jasmino, Shlomo v Doron, Hummus Abu Hassan, HaShomer 1\n\nBest dinner spots: HaBasta, North Abraxas, Abie, Old Man & The Sea, Ha’Achim, Port Sa’id and La Shuk\n\nBest sweets: Anita Gelato, Tamara and Arte Cafe\n\nAgain, visit my massive FULL FOOD IN TEL AVIV GUIDE here!\n\nBONUS: Tel Aviv Food Tour\n\nIf you know me at all you know I try to do food tour’s in every city I visit in order to really immerse myself in their cuisine and culture. If you also couldn’t tell from the above, I am beyond obsessed with Israeli food and specifically the Tel Aviv food scene. So when I found Delicious Israel Food Tours during my time living there in 2019, I could NOT pass up the opportunity on taking this tour. I can honestly, whole-heartedly say this was the ABSOLUTE BEST food tour I have EVER taken. This is THE way to eat Tel Aviv. And I am saying that as someone who has taken similar food tours in other countries AND have already tried (what I thought was) the best of the best in Tel Aviv.\n\nDelicious Israel offers a ton of different Israel food tour options around the country, I personally chose the Market Hop tour which is a four hour tour that goes to both the Carmel Market and Levinsky Market. I chose this one so that I could get a taste of each of my favorite markets, instead of focusing on one since they are both so insanely different. The tour was amazing. I thought four hours was going to be too long. NOPE. It felt like 5 seconds. My guide Lainie was amazing and you could tell how much she cared about the Israeli food, the spots she brought us to (which each had a unique story and personality) and the history behind it. If you are in Tel Aviv and love food (duh) BOOK A TOUR WITH DELICIOUS ISRAEL now. This is the most important part of the Tel Aviv travel guide. I am confident their other tours are just as good as the Market Hop. I cannot wait to go back and literally try every single one of their tours until I do them all! I will go more into detail on every single stop we took on my massive food guide as well, but run, do not walk, to booking this Tel Aviv food tour. It DOES sell out daily. I emailed to book in February and didn’t get a free date until April – hurry !! This has to be on your Tel Aviv itinerary no questions.\n\nBook the Delicious Israel Market Hop or any of their other food tours here!\n\n*Thanks to Inbal for inviting me on the Delicious Israel Market Hop food tour! While I did receive this tour as a gift, my review and experience is, as always, 100% personal and honest*\n\nRelated Post: Food Tour in Porto Portugal Guide\n\nNightlife & Bars In Tel Aviv\n\nCocktail Bars In Tel Aviv\n\nImperial Craft Cocktail Bar: The place to go when you fancy cocktails. It’s a SUPER small bar. MAKE A RESERVATION (I’m not kidding). It’s the #1 rated bar in the Middle East and Africa, you literally can’t walk in without a reservation. Coolest cocktails.\n\nOther cocktail bars in Tel Aviv I love: Dizengoff 223, Bellboy, Spicehaus, Concierge, Honolulu, Por do Sol (go for sunset!!).\n\nFun Bars In Tel Aviv\n\nSputnik: Super cool bar on Rothschild. Has a hipster vibe and has a bunch of different rooms including an outside spot. Really good drinks and chill bar.\n\nTeder: One of my favorite spots that I frequent weekly. Good vibes outdoor courtyard bar that is fun any night of the week. Many Saturdays there are live music shows as well. Within the complex there is also a restaurant upstairs called Romano, a record bar on the ground floor, and a few other bars within. There is also pizza in the bar. The best pizza in Tel Aviv. Get it.\n\nDrama: 3 floors with different vibes. The second floor has a huge outdoor (covered) area to sit and chat. Super popular, go early if you are going on a weekend night.\n\nSpeakeasy: Rooftop bar on Rothschild.\n\nBar Clubs In Tel Aviv\n\nKuli Alma: One of the most popular bars in Tel Aviv. It has a hipster vibe but it is so cool. The top floor is all outdoor tables and chill, then the bottom there is a bar area and then in the back room is a club area. They play all hiphop/rap music. Go later on in the night.\n\nJimmy Who: Fun bar/club on Rothschild, better for people in their young 20s.\n\nAbraxas: Attached to the Abraxas restaurant is a bar that gets really wild on the weekends. However, Israeli night is on Wednesday nights and it is my absolute favorite. If you are looking for a local night I highly recommend going on Wednesdays, otherwise, come any other night of the week and it is a vibe! Probably my favorite bar in Tel Aviv.\n\nMondo 2000: Rooftop bar/club in Florentin. There is usually a wait to get in.\n\nSecret Garden: My personal favorite club (usually Saturday late afternoon/evening). Super cool Tulum type vibes.\n\nShalvata: The “it” young club in Tel Aviv for the summers since it’s outside on the port. Only open in the summer. Skews a bit younger.\n\nOther going out/rowdy clubs in Tel Aviv I love: Goat, Emesh, & Kanta.\n\nSunset Bars in Tel Aviv\n\nLoullie: Chic club right on the tayelet where you can sit at a table and watch the sunset and often has fun DJs on Saturdays. Need to save a table.\n\nMigdalor: Newest sunset spot in the city and a bit far as it’s past the port all the way in the North but has one of my favorite views of the sunset and all of Tel Aviv and is a massive spot with an amazing vibe. Can just walk in – all ages! (often there are kids here!)\n\nPor de Sol: Amazing small bar on the top of the steps at Ben Gurion/Tayelet (Kikar Atarim)\n\nContento: Another cute bar right on the Tayelet\n\nAny of the restaurants on the beach!\n\n*Tip: A lot of the bars and clubs in Tel Aviv you have to be over 24 years old to get into. This is because Israelis go into the army after high school and THEN college, meaning they are out of college at 24 and the bars do not want college kids there, even though they’re of age (drinking age is 18). Just be mindful of this that you may get rejected, but we rarely had issues at every bar.\n\nTel Aviv Hotels & Where To Stay In Tel Aviv\n\nI’ve lived in Tel Aviv, I’ve visited with friends, I’ve been on group trips and I’ve visited with my family, so it’s safe to say I have stayed in many different areas at different budgets. I personally suggest staying at a hotel when you visit Tel Aviv right on the Mediterranean Sea but you still can’t go wrong wherever you choose since Tel Aviv is such a small walking city.\n\nBEACH HOTELS in Tel Aviv are the absolute best. I suggest somewhere near the center of the city (Allenby Street). You will find plenty of ranges of different hotels on Tel Aviv beach. You will find a ton of big chain hotels here (Sheraton Tel Aviv, Hilton Tel Aviv), the David Intercontinental Tel Aviv (which has the best hotel brunch I’ve ever had and is one of the nicer hotels in Tel Aviv). I personally recommend the Royal Beach Hotel (where I had my parents stay when they visited) or the new David Kempinski just opened (Spring 2022) and is the new, nicest hotel in Tel Aviv. It is truly like no other place here, but definitely comes the price. Highly recommend.\n\nBOUTIQUE CASUAL: There are a ton of new boutique hotels that have opened near the beach (personally I like boutique better), I recommend Mendeli Street Hotel (amazing brunch), Brown Beach House or Fabric Hotel I have been in all and they’re both great and in amazing locations!\n\nLUXE BOUTIQUE HOTELS: If you are coming during the winter and don’t need to be close to the beach, there are a TON of luxe boutique hotels near Rothschild and the Tel Aviv Center for a range of budgets. I recommend The Norman (one of the most luxurious and best hotels in Tel Aviv), Hotel Montefiore, The Vera Hotel, The Rothschild Hotel or Poli House!\n\nJAFFA HOTELS: Lastly, there have been luxury hotels popping up all over Jaffa as it becomes the new hot spot in Tel Aviv so if you want to stay in a different area DEFINITELY check out The Setai Tel Aviv(most luxurious hotel in Tel Aviv) or The Jaffa Tel Aviv.\n\nBook the hotels by clicking their names above!\n\nSearch and book all Tel Aviv hotels by clicking here! Read reviews on Tel Aviv hotels on TripAdvisor here.\n\nFor a cheap hotel in Tel Aviv or hostel in Tel Aviv, I HIGHLY recommend Abraham Hostel. This is THE hostel to stay at – it hosts a ton of bar crawls, events, and is by far the highest rated hostel group in the country and is an amazing place to meet people! Definitely, definitely book Abraham for a fun time and clean hostel in Tel Aviv!\n\nBook Abraham Hostel Tel Aviv here!!\n\nAIRBNB Tel Aviv: There are also so many amazing, modern apartments in Tel Aviv. They are generally cheaper than hotels so if you like the Airbnb route instead of hotels I definitely recommend it in Israel – Israeli hosts are amazing. Airbnb Tel Aviv has tons of options, too! Also, if you use my Airbnb link you get $40 off your first stay!\n\nMore Things To Do In Tel Aviv: Weekend & Day Trips From Tel Aviv\n\nAnother one of the best things to do in Tel Aviv is to take day trips or weekend trips around Israel, it is a benefit of being a small country and Tel Aviv is situated in the center of Israel so a perfect home base. Travel guides for each of these locations coming soon! For now, check out my Israel travel blog here on what to pack, safety and what to expect when visiting Israel!\n\nJerusalem\n\nMy extensive Jerusalem guide coming soon – but Jerusalem is an absolute MUST when visiting Tel Aviv.\n\nDay Trips From Tel Aviv: Haifa, Akko, Caesarea and Zichron Yaakov\n\nThe West Bank\n\nMasada, Ein Gedi & the Dead Sea\n\nThe North of Israel (Golan Heights, The Galilee, & Tzfat)\n\nThe South of Israel (Mizpe Ramon, Sde Boker, Ein Avedat,Sderot, Gaza Border & Salad Trail)AND/OR Eilat, Petra and Sinai\n\nLoved this local Tel Aviv blog and Tel Aviv itinerary travel guide?
