        "text": "The river flows for some fifty kilometers through the Coastal Plain before spilling into the sea to the north of Givat Olga. Its main tributaries are the Haviva, Yitzhak, Haderaand Iron rivers. With time, extensive development in the surrounding area has caused the river to become polluted by effluent flowing from factories and the local sewage plants, and until recent years, its lower reaches between Hadera and the sea were a blot on the ecological landscape; the turbid waters stank of sewage and effluent from communities and factories further upriver.\n\nIn 1982, the Maor David Power Station (subsequently renamed Orot Yitzhak in memory of Israel’s late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin) was built on the shore to the north of the mouth of the Hadera River, and since coming into operation, it has used the seawater to cool its electricity production units. After use, the water is returned to the sea, about ten degrees warmer than it had been originally, but otherwise no different from before; no pollution is involved.\n\nAfter the power station was built, a decision was taken to rehabilitate the western section of Nahal Hadera that lies between the Coastal Highway and the point where the river water spills into the sea. KKL-JNF and the Israel Electric Corporation joined forces and established a development authority for the park, under the auspices of KKL-JNF, which is working in conjunction with the Electric Corporation, Hadera Municipality, the Ministry for Environmental Protection and the Society for the Protection of Nature and National Parks.\n\nCoal ash from the power station was used to construct a seventeen-meter-high ramp on the river’s north bank. After construction the ramp was covered with soil and coconut matting and planted with trees and shrubs to keep it stable, prevent erosion and integrate it into the landscape of the park.\n\nAfter stabilization with stones and concrete, the south bank of the river has been transformed into a promenade. Its centerpiece is Fountain Square, where warm seawater bubbles up into a shallow pool equipped with concrete seats for visitors. All along the riverbank fisherman can be observed casting their lines into the water and catching saltwater fish (mainly mullet)."
