        "text": "Stretching over 150 miles, the Jordan River is the longest waterway in Israel and forms much of its eastern border with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Because of its role in a few biblical stories, it is also one of the most famous rivers in the world.\n\nFrom its sources by the Hermon to its estuary into the Dead Sea, the Jordan River is dotted with historical sites and nature reserves, as well as various scenic rides, hikes, and rafting options.\n\nHistoric Sites along the Jordan River\n\nTel Dan\n\nAn important Canaanite and Israelite city was established next to one of the main tributaries to the Jordan River. In addition to the impressive remains of the city’s gate and cultic center, the combined historical site and nature reserve offer hikes along the stream and wading pools for children.\n\nCaesarea Philippi (Banias)\n\nA neighboring city to biblical Dan that prospered in Roman times and the subsequent periods. The New Testament records Jesus’ naming Simon-Yonah, his prime disciple, “Peter” (in Greek: Rock), near the city. Archaeological research uncovered a Pagan cultic center next to the city’s spring, another tributary to the Jordan River (the Banias stream).\n\nChastellet\n\nThe Crusaders built A Crusader fort next to the Jordan River crossing (“Gesher Bnot Yaakov”). In 1179, Saladin led a successful Muslim assault on the fort and destroyed it. A hiking trail next to the fort offers a scenic walk along the Jordan River.\n\nBethsaida\n\nA Roman city built next to the river’s mouth into the Sea of Galilee. The New Testament records Jesus performing a miracle at the city (Mark 8:22-26) and that 3 of his disciples were from Bethsaida (John 1:44). However, later, Jesus dammed the city (Matthew 21:22). To this day, it exactly location is under debate.\n\nDegania\n\nThe first ‘Kibbutz’ (communal farm) in the world, Degania, was established next to the southern outlet of the Jordan River in 1910. Its pioneers formed a true equality lifestyle that was copied in the following decades by creating 300 more kibbutzim across Israel. Today, the Kibbutz founders’ homes are a museum presenting Degania’s unique history and legacy.\n\nGesher\n\nAnother Kibbutz was established in 1939 next to a crossing point of the Jordan River between Tiberias and Beit-She’an. In 1948, the Kibbutz members held against two Arab attacks during the 1948 Israel-Arab War. Today, Old Gesher is a historical site that offers a beautiful walk along the natural Jordan River.\n\nThe Baptism Site\n\nThe exact location of John the Baptist’s baptism of Jesus is not given in the New Testament, but a centuries-old tradition places it at Qasr el-Yahud, five miles east of Jericho. Furthermore, the site is also said to be where the Israelites crossed the Jordan River into the promised land (Joshua 3:13) and where Elijah later crossed to ascend to the heavens (2 Kings 11). Until 1994, it was a war zone, and another site offering baptism services was developed next to the Sea of Galilee (Yardenit).\n\nOutdoor Activities Along the Jordan River\n\nAyun Stream\n\nOne of the Jordan River tributaries, whose origins are in Lebanon, forms a beautiful set of waterfalls near the border. Being a nature reserve, the site offers a scenic hike along the stream’s rapids and waterfalls in one of the most beautiful parts of the country. Nearby, the Snir Stream provides an attractive, family-friendly hike along the water.\n\nBanias Nature Reserve\n\nIt is a three-hour hike along the Banias stream, passing by antiquities of Caesarea-Philippi and Ottoman-era water-powered flour mills. At its southern end, the hike reaches the Banias waterfall, the biggest waterfall in Israel, and a 300-foot suspended trail over the river’s wild rapids.\n\nDrive along the Jordan River Rapids\n\nThis is a scenic ride along a dirt road parallel to the wildest part of the Jordan River. The 10 miles long road starts at Chastellet and ends near Bethsaida, by the Sea of Galilee. At various points, there are stunning views of the river cascading down the Sea of Galilee.\n\nKayaking, Rafting, and Canoeing\n\nWhitewater rafting and kayaking rentals are available at several locations along the northern part of the Jordan River. Kfar Blum Kayaks also offers an extreme park with wall climbing and zip-lining into the river after the rafting. For those seeking a less extreme experience, Rob Roy provides canoeing along a slow-flowing section of the river next to Degania and Yardenit."
