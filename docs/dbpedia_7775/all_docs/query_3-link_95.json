        "text": "The transition between the late EB IB and the EB II, dated to the end of the 4th millennium BCE, is considered by many scholars as a critical point that ended one cultural phenomenon (village life) and started another one (urbanization). Recent excavations at ʿEn Esur, conducted on behalf of the IAA in a huge scale of c. 1700 squares, revealed large portions of a 65 ha. EB IB settlement, the largest known in the southern Levant. In this settlement, various traits of urbanization are found: carefully planned streets, squares, drainage and storage facilities, fortifications, and a unique public building that may have been used as a temple. Moreover, this site, located on a central junction leading from the coastal plain to the Jezreel Valley, was a trading center, as evidenced by finds that originated in other regions, including the Jordan Valley and Egypt. Based on the data collected, it can be stated that ʿEn Esur was already fully urbanized during the EB IB and was an important component of a widespread proto-urban phenomenon which includes very large and often fortified EB IB settlements like ʿEn Zippori and Tel Erani."
