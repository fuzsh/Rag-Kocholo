I came across Amit and his crew from the Daniel Rowing Center (Merkaz Daniel) just off the shore of northern Tel Aviv, as they reached the meeting point between the river and the Mediterranean Sea. Not only were they cool with a drone above their head, they also showed off some really awesome kayaking coordination before turning back upriver to the Center.

The mouth of the Yarkon meets the sea at the Wokop Bridge, which holds it own historic significance dating back to the British Mandate. Part of the area - Tel Qudadi - dates back even further to the Assyrian Empire in the 8th century BCE. Today it connects Tel Aviv Port (the Namal) to the promenade that extends all the way to Herzliya, running across the now abandoned Sde Dov Airport.
