Yarkon River (Hebrew: נחל הירקון, Nahal HaYarkon) is a river in central Israel that flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The river starts in the Yarkon National Garden near Rosh HaAyin and flows past the city of Petah Tikva. After then it flows through the Yarkon Park in the north of the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area beside the cities of Bnei Brak and Ramat Gan, and then flows through Tel Aviv and into the Mediterranean Sea next to the Yarkon River Peninsula and the Tel Aviv Port.

The Yarkon River has a written history of 2000 years. It is described in the Hebrew Bible as a border of the Tribe of Dan of Israelite.
