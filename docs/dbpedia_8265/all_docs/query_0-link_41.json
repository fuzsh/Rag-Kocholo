        "text": "At the end of the school year, Kendra and her brother Seth find themselves racing back to Fablehaven, a refuge for mythical and magical creatures. Grandpa Sorenson, the caretaker, invites three specialists – a potion master, a magical relics collector, and a mystical creature trapper – to help protect the property from the Society of the Evening Star, an ancient organization determined to infiltrate the preserve and steal a hidden artifact of great power. Time is running out. The Evening Star is storming the gates. If the artifact falls into the wrong hands, it could mean the downfall of other preserves and possibly the world. Will Kendra learn to use her fairy gifts in time? Will Seth stay out of trouble?\n\nBrandon Mull is the author of the New York Times, USA TODAY, and Wall Street Journal bestselling Beyonders and Fablehaven series, as well as the bestselling Five Kingdoms, Candy Shop Wars, and Dragonwatch series. He resides in Utah, in a happy little valley near the mouth of a canyon. Brandon’s greatest regret is that he has but one life to give for Gondor.\n\nBrandon Dorman lives in Puyallup, Washington, and is the creator of Pirates of the Sea! and Santa’s Stowaway, and the illustrator of Jack Prelutsky’s Be Glad Your Nose Is on Your Face, as well as Halloween Night, by Marjorie Dennis Murray."
