        "text": "Welcome to our Fun Friday Roundup!\n\nThis roundup comes from a July Fun Friday Book Recommendations on the LitJoy Podcast, where Brandon Mull, author of the Fablehaven series, shares some of his favorite fantasy and sci-fi books and series. Take a look at the books he mentions to Alix and Kelly as having greatly impacted his life and his writing, and let us know in the comments which is your favorite—or which one you're most excited to read!\n\nBrandon Mull's Favorite Books Roundup\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia\n\nC.S. Lewis\n\nSynopsis Sneak Peek\n\nWith the fantastical worlds we find in Brandon Mull's writing, it's no surprise that one of his favorites takes us through the wardrobe and into the land of Aslan! The Chronicles of Narnia has become part of the canon of classic literature, drawing readers of all ages into magical lands with unforgettable characters for over sixty years. Epic battles between good and evil, fantastic creatures, betrayals, heroic deeds, and friendships won and lost all come together in this unforgettable world.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings trilogy\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien\n\nSynopsis Sneak Peek\n\nOne Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien’s classic fantasy has accumulated worldwide acclaim as the greatest adventure tale ever written. It is largely acknowledged that no other writer has created a world as distinct as Middle-earth, complete with its own geography, history, languages, and legends. And one would be hard-pressed to find characters as endearing as Tolkien’s large-hearted, hairy-footed hobbits. So of course The Lord of the Rings series made Brandon Mull's list of faves, opening his mind to a grander and more authentic style of fantasy!\n\nThe Harry Potter series\n\nJ.K. Rowling\n\nSynopsis Sneak Peek\n\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter 'H'.\n\nThe Harry Potter series was the phenomenon of the last generation. Millions were welcomed to the magical school of Hogwarts, and immersed themselves in the wizarding world. It's easy to see the parallels between the world of Harry Potter and Brandon Mull's own Fablehaven, both drawing young people and old who long for a spark of magic in the mundane world!\n\nEnder's Game\n\nOrson Scott Card\n\nSynopsis Sneak Peek\n\nIn Ender's Game, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers to defend against a hostile alien race. A brilliant young boy, Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Until Ender is drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives. Ender's Game is the winner of the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel—and made Brandon Mull's list of all-time favorites, marked for being the book he read in the least number of sittings.\n\nDune\n\nFrank Herbert\n\nSynopsis Sneak Peek\n\nSet on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious man known as Muad'dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family—and would bring to fruition humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream. A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction. It's no wonder it's a source of inspiration for Brandon Mull!\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nHave you checked out our Fun Friday Book Recommendations on The LitJoy Podcast yet?
