        "text": "CONSTRUCTION TYPE:\n\nIn order to match existing roof geometries, as well as, provide for ease of connection from new framing to existing framing, structural steel and bar joists were selected for use at the new roof at the Chapel and Sanctuary. Light-gage Z-purlins, with in-plane rod bracing, were used for roof joists at the classroom addition, to match existing construction in that area. K-braces were used in locations where man-doors would have otherwise interfered with the structural framing. A new cast-in-place concrete baptistery was installed in the Sanctuary, which required saw-cutting the foundation and use of continuous water-stops to prevent potential moisture migration through the new/existing foundation interface in the future."
