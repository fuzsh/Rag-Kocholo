        "text": "Summary\n\nA Roman Catholic parish church, 1933-4. Designed by Philip Chatwin in the neo-Georgian style and built by Maddox & Walford of Gravelly Hill. Not including in the listing are the late C20 link building between the sacristry and the presbytery, the presbytery, and the boundary wall, railings and gates to the west end of the church.\n\nReasons for Designation\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel and St Gregory the Great, designed by Philip Chatwin and built in 1933-4, is listed at Grade II for the following principal reasons:\n\n* Architectural interest: a dignified and accomplished design in the neo-Georgian style with good detailing, and by a significant regional architect; * Interior: the internal space is well-composed with good massing and sophistication in the quality of its detailing; * Degree of survival: the church remains little altered since its completion and the reordering, which is minimal, does not detract from the overall interest; * Fixtures and fittings: the contemporary fixtures and fittings are of high quality in their design and execution, and together form a complete suite of furnishings.\n\nHistory\n\nFrom 1899 Mass was said in a former coach house behind properties fronting Three Shires Oak Road in Bearwood. In 1909 Bearwood became an independent mission and the Galton family gave some land for the building of a permanent Catholic church. However, following a dispute, Major Hubert Galton withdrew his support and instead funded the building of the nearby Church of Our Lady and St Hubert, in Warley.\n\nThe church and the presbytery at Bearwood were designed by Philip Chatwin. Chatwin was from a notable local firm of, mainly Anglican, church builders, and his brother, the Reverend Geoffrey Chatwin, was the parish priest and rector at Bearwood. The builders were Maddox & Walford of Gravelly Hill. The foundation stone was laid on 3 May 1933 by Archbishop Thomas Williams, and the church opened in 1934. It seated 350 and cost £8,300 (excluding the marble high altar). An account in the parish file in the Diocesan Archives, probably written by the architect, described the design as ‘an adaptation of the kind of work common in the reign of Queen Anne’.\n\nDetails"
