        "text": "From a copper-clad church in Finland to an indoor-outdoor sanctuary in Mexico, discover what makes these modern churches such travel-worthy destinations\n\nSacred architecture tends not to conjure visions of a modern church, but Gothic cathedrals with flying buttresses or Baroque churches with ornate ceiling paintings. And though they may feature modern materials or sleeker styles, contemporary churches can inspire as much wonder as their centuries-old counterparts. Architects around the world have taken the traditional elements of church architecture and reinterpreted them within present-day buildings. These welcoming structures are as much community spaces as they are houses of worship. Read on to discover 12 of the most incredible modern churches, from a copper-clad church in Finland to an indoor-outdoor sanctuary in Mexico to a towering chapel in South Korea."
