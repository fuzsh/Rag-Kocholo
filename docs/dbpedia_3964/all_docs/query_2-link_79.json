It has two gift shops and a walking trail to follow the stations of the cross. There are speakers at each stop where when you press a button, Bill Curtis gives a commentary on that specific station. There is beautiful music playing throughout the walk as well. I'm so glad I made a visit here! This is also free, but you can offer a donation if you wish.\n\nMuy hermoso la verdad pero si ban a venir vengan con aguas fr√≠as caminamos mucho el recorrido pero vali√≥ la pena\n\nA beautiful and well-executed depiction of Christ's passion.

We are Protestant but this is the shrine of Jesus Christ. no matter what denomination you are if you know Jesus or love Jesus visit this place.\n\nIt allows you to go back into time and walk the road of Via Dolorosa with Jesus Christ..\n\nWhen you reach the end and see him on the cross, the emotions is so strong is like being in the presence of the Lord.\n\nThe Ascension scene is very emotional and touching. If you love the Lord; you need to go see the shrine. Churches need to take field trips, Sunday Schools to the shrine.\n\nYou will not leave there feeling the same way that you did when you came.\n\nI knelt with Jesus in The garden of Gethsemane. So very close to the real thing that you feel the spirit of God.\n\nThe same way when you feel the spirit as you read the word and get into the word.\n\nI believe this place was ordained by the Lord\n\nReverend Tina Redden\n\nThey have great nativity sets both for the young and the young at heart. So many beautiful religious items to choose from. The Shrine of Christ's Passion giftshop is worth the visit.\n\nAn amazing and humbling experience!
