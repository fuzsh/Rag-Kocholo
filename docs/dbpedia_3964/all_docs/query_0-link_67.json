        "text": "Symbols and architecture in the Bible convey profound spiritual truths, enriching believers’ understanding of faith and redemption. They provide a visual language for connecting with God’s plan and deepening spiritual experience.\n\nThe most ancient text in the Bible is the building, furnishing, and dedicating the Temple of Jerusalem in I Kings 6-7. Church architecture uses this text as the ultimate reference point. Its features include the entrance, the rooms, the greenery, the tabernacle’s Holy of Holies, the use of cedar and gold, the presence of water, the cherubim and seraphim statuary. The ark of the covenant held a tablet of the Covenant, the staff of the patriarchs, and vessel preserving the manna in the desert.\n\nThe Ambry\n\nThe ambry is a sacred chest in which the holy oils used by the Church for the sacraments are stored in a public place. The holy oils are blessed by the bishop of a diocese at the annual Chrism Mass, usually Tuesday of Holy Week, during which the clergy of the diocese renew their priestly vows. The oils are Sacred Chrism (SC), Oil of the Infirm (OI), and Oil of Catechu-mens (OC). The vessels are crystal.\n\nThe Reredos\n\nThe reredos marble was quarried from the Carrara mines in Italy in the late 1870s and carved there. In 1881 it was installed in Most Blessed Sacrament Parish in Philadelphia PA. When the parish was closed and torn down, Guardian Angels purchased it, shipped it here for storage at Butch and Karen Sekich’s shed for 18 months, before it was installed by the team of Danny Vancica of Alpha Tile from Atlanta GA. It is about fifteen tons of marble, 22’ high, 17’ wide across the whole front, and about 6 feet deep, not counting the stairs. Each of the trumpeting angels are about five feet high; they wear a star on their diadems, like the bronze angel at the Meditation Park. Each is slightly different from the other. The overall style of the reredos is Romanesque, noted for its rounded arches, unlike the pointed arches of Gothic. The reredos was a way for artists to represent our approach to the walls of the heavenly city of Jerusalem through the sacraments of the Church. Often the reredos provides a setting for flowers, plants, and candles, very much in tune with the description of the interior of the Temple of Jerusalem. Typically, the arches behind the shelves held the statues or icons of various saints chosen for particular devotion by the parish.\n\nThe Baptismal Font\n\nOnce we enter the sacred space, at the door, we find the baptismal font, for this is where we were first washed of sin, died with Christ, and so became a child of God. Baptism is the first of the sacraments, and so is naturally at the door. The rest of the nave and sanctuary architecture is all about the life of the Christian at prayer and worship of God.\n\nThe Confessional\n\nAnother important part of the Christian journey is the experience of God’s forgiveness and mercy in the Sacrament of Reconciliation.\n\nThe confessional is currently located in the conference room, where you may go to confession face to face or behind a screen anonymously."
