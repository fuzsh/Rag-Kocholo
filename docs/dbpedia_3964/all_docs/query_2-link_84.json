        "text": "Matthias Church is one of the finest churches in Budapest and the most unique churches in Europe. Located atop the Buda Castle hill, it has been serving the citizens of Buda Castle Hill since 1015, its foundation by the first Hungarian king. Bored with churches? Not this time. Full of surprises, mysteries, and treasures, the church has a breath taking interior with colours inspired by orientalism and romantic historicism. Its mystically exotic atmosphere paired with its Neo-Gothic features differentiates it from any other church.\n\nThe Church of the Assumption of the Buda Castle (Hungarian: Nagyboldogasszony-templom), more commonly known as the Matthias Church (Hungarian: Mátyás-templom), more rarely the Coronation Church of Buda, is a Catholic church located in the Holy Trinity Square, Budapest, Hungary, in front of the Fisherman’s Bastion at the heart of Buda’s Castle District. According to church tradition, it was originally built in Romanesque style in 1015, although few references exist. The current building was constructed in the florid late Gothic style in the second half of the 14th century and was extensively restored in the late 19th century. It was the second largest church of medieval Buda and the seventh largest church of the medieval Hungarian Kingdom.\n\nIt is a historic building with an important history. Two Kings of Hungary were crowned within its walls: Franz Joseph I of Hungary and Elisabeth, and Charles IV of Hungary and Zita of Bourbon-Parma. The church was also the location of the “Marian Miracle” of Buda. In 1686, during the siege of Buda city by the Holy League, a wall of the church – used as a mosque by the Ottoman occupiers of the city – collapsed due to cannon fire. It turned out that an old votive Madonna statue was hidden behind the wall. As the sculpture of the Virgin Mary appeared before the praying Muslims, the morale of the Muslim garrison collapsed and the city fell on the same day.\n\nStanding on Buda’s Trinity Square, the building has been shaped by transformations, natural disasters, wars and sieges over the past 800 years. During the Turkish occupation, it was used as a mosque, its tower was used as a minaret, but it has been revived every century to become one of the most beautiful and most visited churches in Hungary today. Matthias Church was built in the 13th century, and since then it has been extended and rebuilt so many times: each era, style, ruler and Castle siege has left its mark on the building. It was even a mosque in 1541 during the Turkish occupation. It is one of the city’s oldest buildings and it is located on the Buda hill, in front of the Fishermen’s Bastion, not too far from the castle. Also known as the Church of Our Lady, this holy building constructed in the florid late Gothic style has more than 700 years of history. It has been the site of several coronations as well as two royal weddings.\n\nMatthias Church was returned to its gothic characteristics in a 19th century restoration. The roof is covered with the famous Zsolnay ceramic tiles, giving an extra touch of charm to the whole structure. The church is characterized by a unique atmosphere and it is decorated with frescoes that have been added during the restoration works between 1895 and 1903. On the left wall, there is a fresco representing the Renaissance; it includes some eastern details representing the Turkish reign in Hungary. Matthias church is home to the ecclesiastical art museum, showcasing several sacred relics and replicas of the Hungarian royal crown and coronation jewels.\n\nDespite being founded in the thirteenth century by King Bela IV (some posit that the first church here was built in the eleventh century), the name Matthias Church is actually a reference to the monarch Matthias Corvinus who was twice married there. Its official name is the Church of Our Lady.The diverse and often turbulent history of Buda is reflected in the eclectic style of Matthias Church, which includes a mostly gothic dramatic exterior and a vibrant interior with allusions to the various rulers of the city, including the Ottomans.\n\nMatthias Church is a Roman Catholic church located in front of the Fisherman’s Bastion at the heart of Buda’s Castle District. According to the tradition, the first church on the site was founded by Saint Stephen, King of Hungary, in 1015: this is based on an inscription erected in 1690 inside the church and burned in 1748, which some previous references seem to confirm. However, there is no clear evidence of the foundation by St. Stephen. This building was destroyed in 1241 by the Mongols; the current building was constructed in the latter half of the 13th century. Originally named after the Virgin Mary, taking names such as “The Church of Mary” and “The Church of Our Lady,” since the 19th century the church has been referred to as Matthias Church, after King Matthias, who ordered the transformation of its original southern tower.\n\nMatthias Church (officially called the Church of Our Lady, but all locals call it “Matyas Templom”) has quite the history and a story to tell. According to historians a church called Church of Mary stood on the site of the current building founded by Saint Stephen, the first king of Hungary in 1015. The current Roman Catholic church was founded by King Bela IV. after the Mongol invaders left Hungary in 1242 in complete ruins, and King Bela IV decided to move the royal residence from Esztergom in the Danube Bend, to the Buda Hills.\n\nWe have no written records of the first organs of the main church in Buda, but only references, for example, in the Thuróczy Chronicle, which reads: “… the bells of the temples were drawn and in them the trombone, organ and music glorified God.”) that in Matthias’s time there were organ builder masters in Buda, like Stefano Lorenzo, whose small positive, allegedly made for Matthias’ order, is currently on display at the Correr Museum in Venice. It is likely that the temple was also equipped with an organ.\n\nThe Church of the Assumption was used by the Turks as a mosque in 1541. When Buda was liberated in 1686, the building was occupied by the Jesuits, who soon repaired it from the Queen’s donation. The musicians’ gallery was also equipped, and in 1688 Archbishop György Széchényi of Esztergom donated a hundred organs of positive organ to the church. Just seven years later, Pál Esterházy, a music lover and composer palatine, expanded the chorus of the church to raise the light of the musical masses and erected a new organ, possibly larger.\n\nEsterházy’s organ worked for almost three decades. In 1723, during a fire, the temple’s front wall fell and destroyed the instrument. In the same year, the Jesuits re-archived the choir and soon equipped it with a new “suitable” organ. The Benedictine monastery lived in the middle of the century, the church was even more brightly decorated. It was then that a contract was made with a certain organ builder named Martin, who, probably in 1747, made two identical instruments for the Jesuit and Franciscan churches of the castle, the Church of the Assumption and the Virgin Mary. His own handwriting testified to this on two facades of the organ of the latter church, which was demolished in 1934.\n\nIn 1768 they began to build a larger musical instrument again from the legacy of a 2015 comrade. We don’t know the builder. This organ was also featured in Franz Liszt’s Coronation Mass in 1867. In 1874, when the church began to be rebuilt, it was valued for sale, which left a very detailed description of it. We do not know any more about his fate, according to his contract Antal Dangl took over the organ in Arad, who built the next instrument. After nearly twenty years of restoration work, Dangl made a new organ for the coronation church, which opened. Its carved, neo-Gothic house was designed by Frederick Schulek.\n\nThe angel statue on the organ cabinet is believed to recognize the features of Ferenc Liszt. The wardrobe of 1893 also serves as the frame of today’s organ. Dangl’s organ was a three-manual, mechanical, tapered instrument. It soon became apparent that, due to its poor disposition and structural deficiencies, it could not meet the music and artistic needs of the temple. A new instrument had to be built to which, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the reign of Franz Joseph as Hungarian King, he donated 50,000 crowns from his private fund.\n\nThe work was entrusted to the Rieger Organ Factory in Jägererndorf, which in 1909, according to the plans of Viktor Sugár, built a late-romantic, four-manual organ with 77 registers (Op. 1500), called the King’s Organ. Manual whistles were placed in the attic of the temple, according to the fashion of the time, and his voice was guided into the temple ship through a 14-meter-long wooden belt on the ceiling. An organ was also planned for the so-called “small band” in the north, but it was not ready at that time.\n\nIn 1931 (again, according to Sugar’s plans) the instrument was expanded to 86 registrars by the Rieger factory in Budapest. During the rebuilding, the whistles were removed from the attic and the interior arrangement of the organ was altered in an extremely unfavorable way. The huge play table was replaced with a smaller one and – for the first time in Europe – equipped with the American Setzer combination, which made it possible to store various tone combinations, greatly facilitating the organist’s work during the performance. The instrument, which was heavily damaged during the Soviet siege of 1944, was temporarily rebuilt after the war. He was completely overhung, suppressed due to inadequate wind supply, his voice silent and pale. Its condition was getting worse and eventually it was inevitable to rebuild. In 1979 a committee was formed with the help of Ferenc Gergely, István Koloss, István Baróti and organist Bertalan Hock.\n\nThe “symphonic” organ, which combines the valuable and still salvable whistles and structural elements of the old instrument, combines romantic and baroque style features. The reconstruction was completed by the Rieger-Kloss organ factory in Krnov, Czech Republic, within a year. In January 1984, a new five-manual organ with an electropneumatic tractor and 85-register, 8-line (Setzer) combination was opened (RIEGER Op. 3540). After the grand organ was handed over, the two-manual 18-register telegraph was originally designed in the chapel (originally a small orchestra) of the Knights of Malta (originally a small band), which was originally located above the sacristy. This instrument could be heard from the grand organ’s play table, but also independently during liturgy or concerts in the church space."
