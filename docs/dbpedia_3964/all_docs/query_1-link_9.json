        "text": "The Font of the Living Waters\n\nThe Font of Baptism.\n\nCrossing the threshold into the church, we are greeted by the Font or Fountain of living waters. Here we may bless ourselves with the water of the Font and renew the promises made at our baptism.\n\nThe Promises of Baptism.\n\nPerhaps we were baptized long ago and cannot remember the sacred event. Perhaps we were baptized only last week. Is it time to renew our promises so soon? Yes, it is.\n\nBaptism is real. Whether I am aware of it or not, it has changed my life. I am marked with a permanent Christ character. That is why I cannot be baptized over again. But I need to apply my once-in-a-lifetime baptism anew to every new day of my life.\n\nRenewing our Baptism.\n\nBefore entering the body of the church, then, I freely renew the baptismal pledge in which I was once adopted into the people of God. I renew my promise by blessing myself with the water on the Font, in the Name of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\n\nThe Liturgy of the Word:\n\nChair and Ambo\n\nThe Chair in the Exedra.\n\nAn oak railing, closing the front of the Chapel of Reservation, forms the background of the Presider’s Chair. Two clergy Benches, angled as an Exedra, on each side of the Chair, complete the “family circle” of the people’s seating.\n\nThe Chair\n\nThe Chair is elevated on several steps in order to provide eye contact between the presiding priest and whole assembly and to make his voice clearly heard.\n\nAt times, the presider may choose to give the homily seated at the Chair in the manner of antiquity. For the prayers, he stands on the foot-pace in front of the Chair.\n\nThe Ambo (Lectern or Pulpit)\n\nAt the right side of the presider, as he faces towards the people, is the Ambo, where readers proclaim the Word of God during the Liturgy of the Word. St. Lucy’s beautiful oak Ambo, part of the original church furnishings, is now raised in an outstanding position on the minister’s platform. From the Ambo’s raised position, the lector’s voice can be heard by all. Thus honor and importance are given to the presence of Christ in the reading of God’s Holy Word.\n\nNatural Light by Day.\n\nFrom the skylights above, ample natural illumination descends to fill the church, inviting us to open our eyes to the radiances of the Lord’s teaching. “Come let us walk in the light of the Lord” (Is 2:5)\n\nNatural daylight is focused upon the center of the buiding so that we may learn to see each other’s faces glowing “in the light of Christ.” The brilliant symbol, diffused at the heart of the building, recalls the words of Jesus, “I am the light of the world. No follower of mine shall ever walk in darkness; but shall possess the light of (divine) life” (Jn 8:12).\n\nLighting by Night.\n\nSt. Lucy’s church enjoys a simple, effective, low-wattage lighting system. A gentle cloud of lights “floats” overhead, suggesting a choir of angel spirits singing with us, “Hosannah in the highest!”\n\nOnly 12 –ft from the floor, clear bulbs in Holophane shades, are both efficient and practical to relamp.\n\nFor a small group, it is possible to turn on only the canopy of twelve lights above the altar, thus leaving the outer margins of the building in semi-shadow. Additional lighting can be provided, as needed, surrounding the central fixture, so that the church is not over lighted on those occasions when a more intimate family event is celebrated at night.\n\nThe Rose Window At The East\n\nThe Sign of Unity\n\nAs we leave the bulding after a church, it is the window at the east that talks to us.\n\nThe circle – a single line with no beginning, no end – is a universal sign of unity. Within the circle that frames the window, we see the symbol of the Creator, of the Word, of the Spirit: Father, Son and Holy Spirit, the Trinity in whose name we were baptized and have just received the blessing.\n\nSymbols of the Holy Trinity.\n\nThe Hand symbolizes the Creator, who made the heavens and the earth, who made us, protects us and saves us. Many are the Bible references to the “mighty hand and extended arm” by which the Lord rescued His people.\n\nThe Dove is also mentioned in Holy Scripture. Matthew writes of “ the Spirit of God descending like a dove, descending upon him.” In Luke, we read: “When Jesus too had been baptized and was praying, heaven opened and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove.”\n\nThe Monogram of Christ comes to us from early Christian days when Greek was the universal language (as English is today). It is in Greek texts that the Gospels, Acts, Epistles and the Apocalyptic Book of Revelation have come down to us.\n\nThe Monogram of Christ combines the Greek letters iota and chi. Iota (I) is the initial of the name Iesous (Jesus) and Chi (X) is the first letter of the title Christos (Christ, the Anointed Messiah). Placed on over the other the two letters: I and X form a star. In a conceptual perspective, the star suggests a three-dimensional cross, as if I were facing conceptual perspective, the star suggests a three-dimensional cross, as if I were facing east looking for Christ to dwell in my heart and looking “to grasp full, with all the holy ones,…\n\nThe breadth … (north and south: way beyond reach of my arms stretched out wide)\n\nAnd length … (east and west: untold distances ahead of me and faraway behind me)\n\nAnd height … (far, far, far above me)\n\nAnd depth … (down fathomless reaches below me)\n\nOf Christ’s love . . . and experience this love which surpasses all knowledge.” (Ephesians 3:18)\n\nThe Persons of the Trinity are One, their oneness marked by the circular form of the rose window itself.\n\nLight and Life\n\nWhen the morning sun streams through the chunks of colored glass assembled in the east window, they sing like jeweled rainbows of peace. After the liturgical celebration as we walk out of the door, the sound of the hymn still rings in our ears, while rainbow colors dance in our eyes.\n\nStepping into the sunlight, we can almost hear Jesus say, “I am the light of the world.” And also, “You are the light of the world . . . Your light must shine before people they may see goodness in your acts and give praise to your heavenly Father.”\n\nBoth stained glass windows are executed by the Rudolph Rohn Studios of Pittsburgh, PA from designs by Ade Bethune. In the technique called faceted glass, slabs of glass about and in think, are chipped in an irregular fashion in order to sparkle as diamonds and precious stones. The jewel-colored individual slaps are embedded in a solid panel cast from epoxy resin and coated with sand aggregate.\n\nEach round window is 8-ft in diameter and contains nine panels, assembled between dark aluminum mullions. The colors change constantly as they reflect the changing sky. Morning or evening, on a rainy day, or in bright sunshine, they sing different songs, reminding us that Christ is our light and life.\n\nThe Communion of Saints\n\nThe Shrines.\n\nOn each side of the Ark is a smaller niche or recess. Each niche holds a sacred image donated almost forty years ago for the older building of St. Lucy parish.\n\nEach image, made from a trunk of limewood 3 ½ ft tall, was carved by hand in an alpine valley of the Tyrol, north of Trent, where ancient traditions of wood carving are still alive today.\n\nOn one side is the image of the Christ Child in the arms of Saint Joseph, on the other side the image of Mary as the Church, continuing in constant prayer of praise and thanksgiving. The figures stand for all our brothers and sisters in Christ, who have gone before us and now celebrate the liturgy in spirit with us.\n\nThe Symbolism of the Color\n\nThe pale blue background of the two niches is painted a \"heavenly blue\" in honor of Our Lady, our first saint, and the saint's prepetual residency with Our Lord.\n\nLights, Candles and Lamps.\n\nLights and candles are time-honored ornaments of every shrine. The purpose of candles is festive. We light them for meals, we place them on birthday cakes. Why are they lighted here during the Mass, and on particular feast days? To tell us that the persons represented by the images are celebrating the divine liturgy with us in heaven, while we celebrate it here and now on earth.\n\nAt candlelight services, lamps and candles have long been used to signify the persons who hold them. Votive lights continue that tradition. In the early church, the gift of candles or oil for lamps was esteemed equal to the gift of bread and wine for the altar.\n\nToday, giving and lighting votive candles expresses our desire to honor the Lord and to continue in prayer just as the little wax candle is consumed by a flame which, like the Spirit, gives at the same time both light and the warmth of love."
