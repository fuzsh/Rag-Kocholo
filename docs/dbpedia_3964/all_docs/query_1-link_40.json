        "text": "Photos by OC-Travel\n\nThe chapel is an architectural triumph and a delight. It justifies itself by announcing itself as a visitor from the past, an ideal example from a golden age of church architecture. The old language speaks of something great that has gone before, providing for an experience which seizes visitors and warms the heart and stirs the soul. It speaks to a city whose walls are to be eternal, from whose temples the celestial powers shall never depart.\n\nThe architectural art blesses the human spirit with something like a vision of redemption. It is so nice, it would be great to see the same design replicated and copied for other new church construction in other cities. It is clear an immense amount of thought and planning went into the design and decoration. The church even includes living quarters and offices for the chaplain and priests on the faculty, a nice touch (seen below), attached to the sacristy. This is connected by an ambulatory passageway behind the sanctuary that connects both sacristies.\n\nBeautiful gardens surround the chapel with an excellent selection of flowers that bloom all summer. Today the chapel is in a fine state of preservation and is popular for alumnae weddings, when students who have graduated from St. Kate's return for their dream wedding celebration. The outstanding semi-circular tympanum of the main portal is the main artistic jewel (seen below), showcasing in the middle a hand-carved image of Our Lady of Victory with the Christ Child, modeled after the famous statue of Our Lady of Victory found in the east transept of the Basilica of Notre-Dame-des-Victories in Paris, France.\n\nThe chapel was built in 1923 by a local architect, Herbert A. Sullwold. The model for inspiration chosen was the Cathedral of St. Trophime in Arles, near Avignon, in the South of France. Mother Antonia McHugh, CSJ, the nun who was Dean of the College of St. Catherine from 1914-1929, oversaw the building of the chapel and its fundraising. She had traveled to Europe and became fond of the French Cathedral in Provence, which had been built between the 12th and 15th century. The highlight of the Cathedral's exterior in its west portal is a magnificently carved tympanum, considered one of the finest examples of Romanesque sculpture in the world. The general structure of the church and portal entrance with tympanum were copied beautifully in the new chapel in St. Paul. The architect had visited and studied the cathedral in France to sketch and take measurements when he went to Europe in 1921 for an extended holiday to study architecture. In the end everyone was more than satisfied with the new church. One significant change made was the addition of a magnificent rose window added to the front facade. The final cost was about $400,000, paid largely by prosperous northern farmers with ties to the college. The architect himself was very proud of the finished product, and described the style as, \"Modern-Byzantine-Romanesque.\" Paul Steenberg Construction Co. was the builder (headquartered in downtown St. Paul's beautiful Endicott Building).\n\nHand-crafted door hinges can be seen along with exquisite outdoor polychrome ceramics (seen below). Shamrocks were included in the design of the bas-relief molding (see below), a wink of the eye to the Irish-American nuns who founded the college, including Mother Seraphine Ireland, Provincial Superior from 1882-1921 (and sister to Archbishop Ireland, who helped found the college). All the details, small and large, display classical influences giving inspiration and voice to objective artistic values. The nuns were eminent in their good taste, lovers of art, patrons and promoters of beauty and elegance by reason of their fine appreciation and keen critical judgment developed through years of patient and persevering study of classical works and the masters.\n\nBeauty, symmetry, and harmony of soul, these the Church had taught taught them to cherish and love. The nuns had been formed by the wisdom of the ages, holiness, high-mindedness and the will to carry out courageously the fine purposes which the Christian religion demands. Mighty in word, and more mightily in deed, the sisters can still be seen by those with an imagination, in their long flowing habits, the epitome of elegance and refinement, praying in the chambered recesses of the hallways and parlors of St. Kate's, the murmurings of their prayers echoing faintly through the chapel, the golden melodies of Gregorian Chant in Latin.\n\nThe chapel was dedicated on October 7, 1924, its titular feast celebrating Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary, also known as Our Lady of Victory. The Mass and rite was celebrated by Archbishop Austin Dowling, Archbishop of St. Paul. Once the debt of construction had been finally paid, the chapel was consecrated on May 1, 1958 by Archbishop William Brady, Archbishop of St. Paul. The chapel was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Hundreds of contributors gave to the 1995-1997 chapel restoration campaign that restored the chapel from a state of desperate decay, found crumbling with age.\n\nAfter the restoration, alumnae return more than ever for weddings and other quiet visits. Both students and graduates commonly describe the scene as a place of beauty, color and silent stillness, a place of pleasant memories. Across the manicured slope in front of the chapel is the Dew-Drop pond, a great attraction to escape and enjoy a moment of revery, an abstracted state of absorption, released from reality. For over 70 years a massive willow tree had stood tall in front of the chapel, which since died - many alumnae hope the administration will some day replace it with a new one.\n\nWhen the chapel was built, the school - St. Catherine's College - was one of the most prestigious women's colleges in the world, with wealthy female students coming from across the country and abroad. Not only did the nuns own and operate the college, on the same campus they also had their own high school for girls, on the second floor of Derham Hall. Both schools went hand in hand, acting as feeders to the convent. In fact, the two buildings are covered with an ivy-covered bridge that was modeled after the bridge of a Venetian canal, spanning between the chapel and Derham Hall.\n\nConvent, chapel and classroom were all united in the work of womanly formation - the results were to be shown in the homes the graduates would found. In those days American nuns were the most educated women in the world, wielding tremendous power and influence with a national multi-million dollar apparatus of schools and hospitals. The nuns were pioneers in the areas of education and health care. Then as today, the education of Catholic women was paramount for the survival of Catholic life in the New World. In the worlds of Fr. Virgil Michael, OSB, a native of St. Paul, Minnesota, who addressed the Minnesota Council of Catholic women in 1936: \"The worst that can happen to a civilization is that its women descend to the moral depths of the unchristian men of the age. We are at that state today.\""
