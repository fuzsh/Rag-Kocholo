        "text": "The painted and mosaic art is the work of Slovenian Jesuit, Marko Rupnik which is unique in Australia.\n\nHis iconography is supported by the red marble from France and white marble from Sardinia covering the floors; the altar, ambo, chair and font cut from Jerusalem stone; and the pews of beechwood from Germany’s Black Forest.\n\nThe mosaic art begins at the front door with the Samaritan woman at the well. The aisle to the altar brings us to the mosaic of the Wedding feast at Cana, flanked by two angles."
