        "text": "Figure of Our Lord: Above the canopy of the main entrance to the church is a 14-foot tall golden bronze figure of Our Lord, hand forged in Cologne, Germany, by one of the great metal craftsmen of Europe, Carl Wyland. Behind this figure of Christ the King is a stone panel background that contains gold incised symbols of Our Savior, such as contracted forms of Jesus' name in Greek, the Chi Rho, and Alpha/Omega.\n\nCreation Windows: Along the left side of the church are seven large stained glass bay windows depicting the days of creation in Genesis 1. The imposing, bare concrete slabs call to mind the formless emptiness of the Earth, which seemed all too familiar amid the melancholy of the mid-twentieth century. But obdurate coldness is not the end of the story. The light emitted through the windows illustrates the marvelous tapestry of God’s creative work—bringing everything from nothing—through his Word that is Light itself. The seventh window, representing the Seventh Day, depicts illustrations of the sacraments. Here, Schulte and window maker Emil Frei show that God has not stepped away from his creation but rather is fully involved in it through the sacraments and through the Church.\n\nMarian Altar: To the right of the High Altar is an altar dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary. Above this shrine is a painting of Our Lady giving the rosary to St. Dominic. The painting, by Carl Zimmerman, a popular Cincinnati artist and art teacher, is flanked by the 15 mysteries of the rosary.\n\nStatuary: St. Gertrude Church’s sanctuary houses three statues. From left to right, the first statue is the statue of St. Joseph the Worker (a feast day implemented by Pope Pius XII in 1955). The second statue depicts the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The Catechism of the Catholic Church reminds us that Jesus’ heart, which was “pierced by our sins and for our salvation, ‘is quite rightly considered the chief sign and symbol of that . . . love with which the divine Redeemer continually loves the eternal Father and all human beings’ without exception” (CCC 478). The third statue is the statue of St. Gertrude the Great, the thirteenth century Benedictine and patroness of our parish. The statue clearly depicts her own devotion to the Sacred Heart and reminds us of our own call to discipleship.\n\nAnchors: Carved into the exterior stone above the side doors of the church, anchors are a traditional Christian symbol for hope. ​\n\nBlack Marble Wall: Located behind the sanctuary,the polished black marble wall contains sinuous lines and gold stars, depicting prayers rising to heaven. This represents the connection and dialogue we have with God. Prayer gives us hope and shows God’s active participation in the world through his relationship with us.\n\nCrucifix: The crucifix, positioned prominently behind the tabernacle, represents the Tree of Life and contains 12 depictions of the Eucharist. However, one can find symbolism in the corpus as well. If you look closely, you can see that Jesus’ eyes are still open. As we look up and see Jesus in agony on the cross, we are reminded of the purpose of pain and suffering in this life and that it is not a product of God’s indifference. We are not “stuck” here on Earth, suffering for no reason. ​\n\nRelics: There are relics of St. Gertrude the Great in both the altar of reservation (on which sits the tabernacle) and the altar of sacrifice. There are also over 50 relics of saints and one relic of the cross located in our reliquary in the Holy Family Chapel (located in what was formerly the baptistry). ​\n\n​Stations of the Cross: George Yostel, a parishioner of St. Gertrude Church, designed and sculpted the bronze Stations of the Cross, which were cast in Munich, Germany."
