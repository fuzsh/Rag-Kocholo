        "text": "Welcome to our parish website!\n\nIf you are looking for a parish where the Catholic Faith is solid, and the heart of our people is warm and generous -- look no further than Our Lady of the Lake Parish.\n\nWe are one parish with three locations:\n\nOur Lady of the Lake Church - Edinboro PA\n\nSaint Anthony of Padua Church - Cambridge Springs PA\n\nSaint Bernadette Church - Saegertown PA\n\nWe are a parish of The Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie Pennsylvania.\n\nWe strive live each day in fidelity to our triune God: The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit. We embrace Jesus as the Christ as the Lord of our Lives. We firmly embrace the Catholic Church's official teachings on the Holy Scriptures, the Sacraments, and the Traditions of the Church as illustrated in the Catechism of the Catholic Church.\n\nâ€‹Our Mission is the mission of Jesus Christ: To follow the will of the Heavenly Father with the blessing of the Holy Spirit.\n\nTHE BACKSTORY\n\nOur font has had a leaking problem almost from the time it was installed. Several fixes were made over the years, but none permanently solved the problem. We now have the opportunity to remove the current font and install a beautiful new font in 2024.\n\nOur goal was $22,000.\n\nTwo parish families donated leadership gifts in the amount of $10,000 and $12,000 respectively. Those generous gifts allowed us to do a \"Matching Gift\" component, the first for a 1:1 match, and the other for a 2:1 match.\n\nThe drive began on Monday, November 13, 2023\n\nand ended on #iGiveCatolic Tuesday, November 28, 2023.\n\nBy the grace of God and the generous support of our parishioners and friends, we were gifted $38,603 Raised by 125 Donors, AND we were given an award of $1,000 by the Quinn Law Firm through the Catholic Foundation of Northwestern Pennsylvania.\n\nThis brings our total to $39,603!\n\nOur Lady of the Lake Parish thanks everyone who made donations, large or small.\n\nWe have already begun our project. Our hope is to have it completed in May of 2024. It will look beautiful!\n\nWe project that the baptismal font project will be completed by August 1st. After it is completed, we will be inviting Bishop Persico to preside at a liturgy and bless our new font.\n\nA serious problem with our roof has been identified several years ago. It is to the point that we really need to address it as soon as possible as leakage has already affected the ceiling in various areas of the church as well as causing condensation striping on all exterior walls.\n\nin this project we are addressing some architectural issues that have surfaced since the building of our church. These include:\n\nA new soundproof, accessible and child safe reconciliation room\n\nConstructing an audio/video room for videography equipment\n\nRedesigning a new cover to hide the cold air returns located in the sanctuary\n\nApplying a vapor barrier over walls that have condensation problems\n\nA design upgrade for our chapel which provides comfort and easier to access from the gathering space.\n\nFunding will be from two sources:\n\nOur annual Catholic Services Appeal\n\nFunds we have saved over the years\n\nWe held 5 meetings in late 2023-early 2024 and from the feedback we received from our parishioners --- this project has been very well received. The most common response we received was -- \"Let's get going on these projects!\"\n\nOur CSA 2024 diocesan goal is $56,740. Recently we surpassed this goal and are now to the point that every dollar donated will directly support our church project.\n\nOverall, the project will be under $700,000. A more exact figure will be published when bids have been completed. We will draw over $400,000 from parish funds, thus making our fundraising goal $300,000.\n\nWe invite all our parishioners and friends to please make a gift to our annual Catholic Services Appeal. Call or visit our parish office. This is a fantastic way to use IRA distributions and receive a tax break. Together we can fund this church project and continue to move into the future!\n\nGod Bless you for your generous response. You are amazing!"
