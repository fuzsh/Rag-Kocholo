        "text": "Parish Mission Statement\n\nWe, the faithful of Our Lady Queen of Heaven Church and Holy Martyrs Mission, in the Diocese of Venice, Florida, are called to proclaim that Jesus is the Light of the world, who offers to all who follow Him the light of life.\n\nWe therefore commit ourselves to:\n\nBuilding our lives in the image of Jesus through prayer and the sacraments of the Church.\n\nPlacing our lives and the lives of our families under the maternal protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nContributing to the growth of our parish community by devoting ourselves to the work of evangelization.\n\nServing our brothers and sisters, particularly the poor and needy, by generous acts of charity.\n\nMay Our Lady Queen of Heaven, and the Holy Martyrs of Mexico, guide us in our earthly journey so that at the end, we may forever proclaim God’s mercy. Amen\n\nThe Gospel writer Mark records the occasion when those disciples slept while he prayed in the Garden prior to his trial and eventual crucifixion, “Could you not watch one hour with Me?” (Mk 14:34) We are encouraged to do likewise and spend an hour in thanksgiving. Every Friday and Thursday a Holy Hour is offered from 7pm until 8pm at Our Lady Queen of Heaven. This is an opportunity to visit the Blessed Sacrament exposed and to receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation. For more info see here."
