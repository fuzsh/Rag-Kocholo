        "text": "St. Clare Catholic Church opened its doors in 1977 as a mission of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Newhall. Soon we were growing out of our church and in response we built our current church building in 1988. In 1995 construction began on our Mission Church, Bl. Kateri in the Saugus area of Santa Clarita. Bl. Kateri, now St. Kateri — a parish in its own right — also continues to grow.\n\nIn 2007 St. Clare added two new buildings to accommodate our need for more meeting and gathering space. The new buildings also house our Parish Library. We thank God for the ministries which serve our Hispanic and Filipino population, The Knights of Columbus, our Religious Education Programs, the Bereavement Ministry, our Lectors, Eucharistic Ministers, Ushers, our Sunday Morning Coffee and Doughnuts Crews, our Tuesday/Thursday Senior Group, and all of our volunteers who breathe life into St. Clare’s.\n\nAs the Santa Clarita Valley continues to grow, the three Catholic Churches in this area are all in various stages of construction, working to meet the needs of our ever-growing population.\n\nWe welcome you to St. Clare of Assisi Catholic Church. We are blessed by your presence and hope that you will visit us soon. Should you decide to join us for Sunday Masses, please be sure and introduce yourself to one of our priests.\n\nSanta Clarita Valley was officially named in 1972. The only parish in the valley was Our Lady of Perpetual Help. SCV was growing and so was the parish. There was a need for more space; it was time that the parishioners from the Canyon Country area branched off to make a new mission of their own. Father Henry J. Banks, Pastor of OLPH started the mission of St. Clare of Assisi. Masses began in February at the Canyon High Library. By April, the library could no longer accommodate the growing mission, so Mass was moved to the gymnasium. Remember being a bleacher climber? Ahh, those were the days! You were not only spiritually enlightened but physically fit due to all that climbing. CCD classes began that same year. Weekly classes were held at the Elks Lodge on Sierra Highway, Sierra Vista Jr. High School, and at the homes of several parishioners. Religious Education would be a mainstay of the parish.\n\nThere was an extensive search for property to build the new church. One of the sites being considered was the current location of Denny’s at Soledad and Crossglade in Canyon Country. There was also a plot of land nestled in the Canyon off Camp Plenty Road. Originally, the land had a house and a barn on it. The story goes that settlers would camp near the site because it had plenty of water from the Santa Clara River. This seemed a perfect place to put a church, a place to find a community of God. The property was purchased for $35,000 dollars. In 1976, Cardinal Manning approved the name of the mission as St. Clare of Assisi.\n\nConstruction began in January of 1976 and was completed in July of that year. The architectural drawings of St Francis of Assisi church in Fillmore were used, not only to save money, but it kept the connection between St. Francis and St. Clare who were spiritual partners in Christ. The total cost was $285,000 and was completely paid for by the time the first Mass was held in the new church. This was due to the generosity and dedication of the parishioners of both St. Clare and OLPH!\n\nFather Ed Renehan was appointed to the position of Mission Administrator in 1977. In February of 1978, St. Clare was officially made a parish, with 1,500 registered families. At that time Father Ed was appointed Pastor.\n\nSeeing the strength of the parish community it was time to come together and put that strength to work. During the Lenten season of 1979, St Clare held its first annual Fish Fry and inaugural Barbecue later that year. The International Food Fair and the Christmas Basket Program were also started to put the strength of the community to work. This was an exciting time to be a parishioner.\n\nIn 1985 the construction of the classrooms began. This was a landmark for the church. Since the beginning, Religious Education has been and will always be the cornerstone of St. Clare’s of Assisi. Today, classes are now held five days a week. In a few short years, the Santa Clarita Valley grew and so did the parish. There was a need for more space. The strength of the parish community had a new challenge before them, to build a new church. The property adjacent to the first church and classrooms was purchased for $280,000. Construction was completed within a year at a cost of $1.8 million dollars. In two short years, the entire building and property were paid for, but the most amazing thing was that the parishioners raised $415,000 in one weekend! The first Mass in the new church was celebrated on Christmas Eve, 1988. At that time, the total number of families registered was 3,800.\n\nThe Santa Clarita Valley has grown from small individual communities into a large city. In 1991, Mass began to be celebrated at Arroyo Seco Jr. High and guess what? It was time to build a new Building! The multi-purpose building at Blessed Kateri was started. Construction began in 1996 and was completed in 1997. Blessed Kateri officially became the third parish in the valley. The International Food Faire was enhanced by the creation of the Ministry Faire. This gave the parish a renewed spirit and strengthened the bond of Community.\n\nIn January of 1994, Santa Clarita felt the shock waves of the 6.8 Northridge Earthquake. This left the church damaged. In 1999 the parish of St. Clare of Assisi, having built Blessed Kateri, started the job of refurbishing the church. The cost to refurbish the church would be $435,000, $150,000 more than the cost of the original church, which is now the Fr. Henry J. Banks Community Center."
