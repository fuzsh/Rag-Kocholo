        "text": "Submitted by: W. Liu & R. Zhong, Class of 2017\n\nInterviewee: Jim McCullough, Youth Minister at OLG\n\nThe interview took place in Our Lady of Grace Church, March 11th, 2017. When we first arrived at the church, the construction of its inside and the outside fascinated Rayna and I, and we both think it is the peaceful and beauty of the details of the church including the statues, stained glass, the design of the building, and the paintings that really made OLG stand out compared to the other churches in North Carolina. Jim McCullough is the person we chose to interview. He was one of the youth ministers of this church, who has devoted thirty-seven years of his life to this church working with children; teaches them about God, the purpose of volunteer, worship, and education. After his retirement, he still chose to stay in OLG and give tours to people, and amaze more people with his speech of the story of OLG.\n\nOur group chose this stained glass topic is because me and rayna both enjoy art and history of architectures, so that when we first heard of OLG church from Dr. O about their beautiful stained glass windows and their story of how Hitler end up on one of those windows in the church… it has caught my attention and interests. Later we go to the library and did some research on it, and found myself has already fall in love with every piece of their stained glass windows. Every piece of the14 of them tells a story of Jesus with his people, so with a curious heart wanting to know more details and get to see those glass windows closer than the picture we decide to pick the history of those stained glass in OLG as our concentration for this Archive project. Through this Archive Project, we hope people can pay more attention to the stained glass windows in church. Because they meant more than decorations, but instead, they are like God’s arm welcoming us into his world. His followers can feel it when the light shine through those\n\nwindows with God’s mark on it right into our heart while we are trying to connect to God. The stained glass windows bring us peace and shows us the present of God."
