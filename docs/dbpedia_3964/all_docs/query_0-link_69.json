        "text": "Nine Churches Walk – Website and Mobile Companion\n\nYou can view the latest information and route details by going to the new Nine Churches Walk website.\n\nAbout the Nine Churches Walk\n\nJesus’ description of a disciple as one who denies himself, takes up his cross, and follows him is not an easy saying to live or to understand. It produces the same confusion that confronts a believer in calling the day on which Jesus was brutally tortured and crucified “Good Friday.” Good Friday challenges Christians not to look away from the evil in the world nor from the suffering endured to overcome it. This day challenges believers to say a resounding ‘yes’ to the suffering Christ experienced for their sakes, even saying ‘yes’ to the suffering in their own lives for the salvation of the world.\n\nWith this purpose, the Jesuit High School community participates each year in the Nine Churches Walk. Participants visit churches rooted in New Orleans history and garnished with striking architecture and walk in pilgrimage imitating the way of the cross endured by Jesus. At each church participants are invited to listen to a brief history of the parish given by pilgrimage historian Brandon Briscoe ’98. The group then prays one or two of the Stations of the Cross, accompanied by reflections composed in 2005 by then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. After a few moments of prayer in the church, the group makes its way to the next station church.\n\nPilgrimage Details\n\nThe new route will begin at Holy Name of Jesus Church located at Loyola University. Participants are welcome to gather around 8:15 a.m. in preparation for the pilgrimage to begin at 8:15 a.m. with some introductory remarks followed by the first station. From there the procession will follow the order of churches listed below.\n\nAlthough Good Friday is a fasting day, participants may choose to bring a light snack and water for the walk. It is also recommended to check the weather forecast for the appropriate dress, noting that sunscreen or a hat may be helpful. Participants should also be prepared to walk 5-6 miles through the course of the morning. The walk ends at Immaculate Conception Jesuit Church around 1:30 p.m., and participants should arrange their own ride back to their vehicles after the walk.\n\nWe will be live updating our location and progress along the Nine Churches route via Twitter — follow us @SocietyOfJaysus.\n\nChurches Visited\n\nHoly Name of Jesus 6367 St Charles Ave St. Francis of Assisi 631 State St. St. Stephen’s Church 1045 Napoleon Ave. St. Henry’s Church 812 General Pershing St. Our Lady of Good Counsel Church 1235 Louisiana Ave. St. Mary’s Assumption Church 919 Josephine St. St. Theresa of Avila Church 1404 Erato St. St. Patrick’s Church 724 Camp St. Immaculate Conception Jesuit Church 130 Baronne St.\n\nThe origins of the Nine Churches Walk, like most traditions in New Orleans, are somewhat obscure. Some sources say that the number of churches reflects the tradition of praying nine days of a novena for a particular petition. Others cite the tradition in Rome of praying the Stations of the Cross at a different church on each of the forty days in Lent. Whatever the origins, the tradition manifests the vibrancy of the Catholic faith for centuries in Louisiana as an integral part of the region’s culture."
