        "text": "Author: Bob Reddy\n\nDonor-Advised Funds\n\nSusan Laielli – Special to the Florida Catholic\n\n11/15/2018\n\nIt’s difficult to imagine that with one simple phone call a person can donate to any number of their favorite Catholic, social service, and other pro-life causes such as Pregnancy Care Centers, abstinence programs, Catholic Schools, Catholic Charities and beyond, through the Catholic Community Foundation of Southwest Florida (CCFSF).\n\nAfter investing in other foundations in Southwest Florida, philanthropists Janine Marrone, and her husband Steve, decided to place their hard-earned money into a Donor-Advised Fund (DAF) at the Catholic Community Foundation of Southwest Florida, where their Catholic and pro-life passions could prosper, and hopefully change hearts and minds along the way.\n\nA Donor-Advised Fund is a charitable investment account for the sole purpose of supporting charitable organizations you care most about, while offering an immediate tax deduction. Donors make a charitable contribution to their fund and recommend grants from it over time to their favorite Catholic, pro-life or social service programs and ministries.\n\nIn the Marrone’s case, they advance many Catholic and pro-life missions, such as creating Luncheons4Life. They are assisted by many good people in Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties within the Diocese, each offering monthly luncheons in support of life. The luncheons, also held in Fort Lauderdale, Atlanta, Georgia, and Alton, Illinois, bring like-minded supporters of life together without politics, and with no cost or “ask” at the end. Through their Donor-Advised Fund, the Marrone’s are able to raise awareness in hopes of bringing an end to abortion and offering healing to those who have had an abortion.\n\n“The Donor-Advised Fund allows our contributions to be forwarded to Our Lady of Perpetual Help Retreat Center for the luncheons, or to our Parish, the Catholic Faith Appeal, and Catholic Schools,” said Janine Marrone, who was excited to open the first Donor-Advised Fund with the Catholic Community Foundation of Southwest Florida this year.\n\n“We can also contribute to the Institute for Catholic Studies and Formation, Pregnancy Care Centers, and to Catholic Charities through this fund,” added Marrone, who was well-versed and experienced in donor-advised funds.\n\nShe approached the Catholic Community Foundation when she heard they were launching their own Donor-Advised Fund program that was more in alignment with her faith and values.\n\nFunds with the Catholic Community Foundation are invested in socially responsible, Catholic-screened investments. Distributions can only be made to Catholic, pro-life or social service agencies whose mission and services are in keeping with the teachings of the Church.\n\n“Earlier in 2018, the Catholic Community Foundation Board approved the launch of our Donor-Advised Fund program in response to numerous requests from donors within the Diocese who were looking for a Catholic option,” said Michael Morse, Executive Director of the Catholic Community Foundation of Southwest Florida. “I was so blessed to work with the Marrone’s on the program’s launch.”\n\nWith the launch of this new program the CCFSW is now a full-service community foundation that can meet the needs of donors looking for a faith-based alternative for their giving. All Donor-Advised Funds, similar to all funds held by the Foundation, are governed by fund agreements signed by the donor, which specify how they may be used.\n\n“With the recent changes to the tax laws, Donor-Advised Funds with the Catholic Community Foundation may be a great way to maximize your tax benefits this year and going forward,” added Morse.\n\nMarrone exhibits much enthusiasm when she talks about charitable giving and making a difference, but she also is very active and engaged in the community, so there’s not a lot of time to waste.\n\n“Working with the Foundation is easy, and with the Donor-Advised Fund it’s essentially one-stop-shopping, really,” said Marrone.\n\nFor more information on donor-advised funds or the Catholic Community Foundation, please contact Michael Morse at 941-441-1124.\n\nSecond wave of donated items delivered to Panhandle\n\nStaff Report – Florida Catholic\n\n11/15/2018\n\nThe second delivery of items donated by the faithful of the Diocese of Venice has been delivered and distributed to those recovering from the aftermath of Hurricane Michael.\n\nDeacon Henry deMena and Paul Unsworth of St. Agnes Parish helped deliver the supplies to St. Dominic Parish in Panama City on Nov. 2. There he spent the week helping to hand out needed supplies to people who are continuing to struggle to rebuild their lives nearly a month after the storm struck the Panhandle.\n\n“The destruction is truly indescribable,” Deacon deMena said. “The number of homes that are damaged or destroyed is amazing. Entire strip malls turned to rubble. We saw boats on their side in the middle of roads (more than three weeks after the storm); trailer homes either destroyed or lying on their sides; trees that were snapped like twigs, etc.”\n\nThe emergency supplies were the result of a Diocese-wide appeal that showed a tremendous response of donated emergency items, including water, food and cleaning supplies.\n\nDeacon deMena and a colleague spent the week at the distribution center for food, water, personal hygiene, pet food and many other items located at St. Dominic Parish. The center operated from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and had a continuous stream of cars coming through.\n\n“The needs are endless up there and yet everyone who came through the line were so upbeat and appreciative of what we were all doing for them,” the Deacon explained. “As the colder weather approaches people were looking for blankets since many of them are living in a partial home open to the outside.”\n\nThe distribution site is in the shadow of the Church, which had major damage. The rectory, parish hall and faith formation buildings were destroyed.\n\nEverywhere he turned, Deacon deMena saw volunteers making a difference, working alongside Catholic Charities staff from across Florida and the nation being Jesus to the poor and downtrodden.\n\nThe first wave of supplies from the Diocese of Venice arrived in the Panhandle less than a week after Hurricane Michael struck on Oct. 10. The donations were then consolidated at the Judy Sullivan Family Resource Center of Catholic Charities in Naples.\n\nStudents from St. John Neumann Catholic High School in Naples helped load the truck deMena took of Panama City.\n\n“I can’t list the many times we saw God’s hand in helping us,” Deacon deMena said of his time in Panama City. “This was a true example of how the Catholic Church works as a united front to care for ‘the least of my brothers.’”\n\nPunta Gorda Youth Tweet the Holy Father\n\nStaff Report – Florida Catholic\n\n11/15/2018\n\nA simple exercise for a Parish youth group turned into an outpouring of heartfelt emotion about the Universal Church, their Faith and Pope Francis.\n\nRita J. Sheridan, Director of Youth Ministries at Sacred Heart Parish in Punta Gorda, organized her 6th-8th graders to compose messages – or Tweets – that would be sent to Pope Francis through his Twitter social media account.\n\nSheridan heard about other youth groups doing this exercise and believed it would be a good idea. The results were amazing.\n\n“After I read each of them, I was so moved that I set up the Twitter account and sent them off to the Pope,” Sheridan said. “They really couldn’t believe I would actually do this!”\n\nSheridan was pleased with the thought and effort the students made during this project.\n\n“It was a great exercise and the kids truly spoke from their hearts,” she said.\n\nThe following are just some of the Tweets created by the youth from Sacred Heart Parish in Punta Gorda:\n\n“Dear Pope Francis – when I go to Church I feel safe against all evil on Earth. I honor you for religious freedom. I get connected to the Church when I pray and I am with my family.” – Nicholas\n\n“Dear Pope Francis – I feel special at Church because I sing at Mass. It’s only me and three other girls. Almost all my family that goes to church at the 4 o’clock Mass helps in the Mass. Thank you for trying to stop the shootings. Love.” – Tristen\n\n“Dear Pope Francis – My name is Aaron and I’d like to tell you that when I go to Church I feel connected to the Church. I appreciate your work. I’m connected to the Church because I love to learn about God. God bless you, Pope Francis.” – Aaron\n\n“Dear Pope Francis – When my mother, brother and I walk into Church we feel welcomed by God. I truly follow what you stand for which is love, caring and having a beloved heart. I follow yours and God’s Word for these top three special things. I plan on serving in the U.S. Navy to protect these top three things including religious freedom so we can continue to follow God and follow his word in the future. Thank you for being the true head of our Christian Catholic religion. I truly follow you wholeheartedly… dearly loved and truly follower.” – no name provided\n\n“Dear Pope Francis – As I walk into Church I feel welcomed. Along with many other emotions including the breaking of my religious solitude and the acceptance into God’s arms. I honor you because of your efforts and success in helping people into Christianity or accepting them for who they are no matter the religion or Faith of said person. I feel as if you connect me to the Church by showing me there is nothing to be afraid of as you and God accept me into your arms even if others don’t accept me for who I am. I like your approach on how you want to save the environment and how you unite people together to make a change. Thank you.” 8th grader – no name provided\n\nTo date, the youth have not received any responses from Pope Francis, but Sheridan explained that this is understandable as the Holy Father (or his staff) likely see countless messages each day.\n\nMemorial Mass for Deacons held\n\nBy Bob Reddy – Florida Catholic\n\n11/15/2018\n\nNovember is an appropriate time to remember those who have died, that they may someday be accepted into heaven.\n\nFor this reason, Bishop Frank J. Dewane invites the Permanent Deacons and their wives to participate in a Memorial Mass each year as a time to pray for, to honor, and to remember the Deacons and their wives who have passed away. The 2018 Mass was celebrated on Nov. 6 at Our Lady of Perpetual Help Retreat Center in Venice. Today, there are more than 50 Permanent Deacons, many seasonal, living and serving throughout the Diocese.\n\nBishop Dewane paid tribute to the Deacons for answering the call of the Lord in a precise way and took time to honor those who came before to ensure they are not forgotten.\n\n“Being a Deacon is about building a spiritual life,” Bishop Dewane said. “It is an intentional aspect of discipleship. You go forward – with the support of your spouse – blessed by the Lord who provides the resources necessary so that you finish that call you were given.”\n\nThat call includes being representatives of the Living Church. Permanent Deacons serve as Ministers of Word, proclaiming the Gospel, preaching, and teaching in the name of the Church. They also baptize, lead the faithful in prayer, witness marriages, and conduct wake and funeral services. As ministers of Charity, Deacons are leaders in identifying the needs of others, then marshaling the resources to meet those needs.\n\nThe goal of the Memorial Mass is to bring attention to all of the Deacons who have served in the Diocese of Venice since its founding in 1984.\n\n“Let us not just remember on a single day those who go before us,” Bishop Dewane concluded. “Let us not forget that example of strength they gave us before continuing on their journey toward the Lord.”\n\nAs part of this annual tradition, the names of those who have passed away during the previous year are solemnly read as a candle is lit in their honor. Included in the list of names were Deacon Edward McCarthy, Deacon Joseph Cirieco, Lillian Camacho and Miriam Horvath.\n\nDeacon Frank Camacho said that the annual Mass serves as an opportunity for the Permanent Deacons of the Diocese, and their spouses, to take time out to reflect on those who have died in the most appropriate way through Mass and prayer.\n\nGrandparents honored at Neumann\n\nBob Reddy – Florida Catholic\n\n11/15/2018\n\nGrandparents, a vital link to the past – most importantly the Faith, were welcomed to St. John Neumann Catholic High School in Naples for a special celebration.\n\nThat celebration on Nov. 7 opened with a Mass celebrated by Bishop Frank J. Dewane as students sat with their grandparents in the Our Lady of the Angels Chapel. Afterwards, everyone went to the Student Life Center for a luncheon.\n\nDuring the Mass, Bishop Dewane spoke about the wisdom and knowledge of the faith older people can share with the young.\n\n“Those of you who are blessed to still have your grandparents in your lives must take advantage of this,” the Bishop said. “Learn from them. Learn about how the Lord has shaped their lives.”\n\nThe Bishop also encouraged the grandparents to impart their wisdom through love and tenderness. “You as grandparents are a connection to Jesus Christ that the young people need. You are the example for them to follow.”\n\nSeveral grandparents, and their grandchildren, complimented the Bishop for speaking so clearly about their respective roles in the Church – one as mentor and example, the other as respectful listener and observer.\n\nFollowing the Mass, one grandparent noted that he is proud his grandchildren attend a Catholic High School. “My grandson is getting the best education. I tried to pass the faith along to my own children and grandchildren. It is rewarding to see that lesson is being passed down to my grandchildren and enhanced here at St. John Neumann.”\n\nBereavement: Surviving the Holidays\n\nBob Reddy – Florida Catholic\n\n11/25/2018\n\nThe holidays can be a stressful time for everyone but more so for those who are grieving the loss of a loved one. The rush of memories can make it feel as if the loss is happening all over again.\n\nTo help the bereaved, the Office of Family Life offered three “There is Hope: Surviving the Holidays” workshops led by Deacon Henry deMena of St. Agnes Parish in Naples, who has extensive training experience as a bereavement counselor.\n\nDeacon deMena tried to help the bereaved make sense out of what doesn’t make sense: grief. The workshops took place Nov. 13 at St. Leo the Great Parish in Bonita Springs, and Nov. 15 at Epiphany Cathedral in Venice and Incarnation Parish in Sarasota.\n\nDeacon deMena spoke about how the grieving process is an emotional roller coaster and spiritually one can find peace at times and then find anger. None of this is unusual. While prayers can bring comfort, they cannot magically take pain away.\n\n“As humans we might feel God has abandoned us when trying to deal with the loss of a loved one,” Deacon deMena said. “It’s OK, because God has broad shoulders. He can handle you being upset with Him. The more you can pray and talk to the Lord, the easier it will be to help Him find you. God wants to share His love and comfort with us.”\n\nThe holidays are difficult because anxiety and stress levels are running high for everyone. Anything that can be done to reduce the effort and stress of the season is recommended.\n\nThe first Thanksgiving or the first Christmas after a loss is a stark reminder for the bereaved that the deceased is no longer there in a specific and powerful way. Fortunately, as time passes the recovery for the bereaved from the holiday is quicker.\n\n“You need to expect and accept the pain of the day,” Deacon deMena said of holidays. “Feel what you need to feel, not with others want you to feel.”\n\nDeacon deMena offered a variety of suggestions on how to get through the holidays by planning ahead for any activity to help avoid surprises. One thing not to do during the holidays is pretending everything is the same or fine, or to not talk about the loved one as if they never existed. This actually is more painful for the bereaved.\n\nOther topics included common grieving feelings and misunderstandings; bereaving time frames; holiday bereavement for children/teens; coping techniques; and the power of prayer.\n\nWorkshop attendees shared their own stories of grief and the challenge of dealing with well-intentioned friends and family who are offering advice.\n\nOne gentleman from Bonita Springs explained how he is trying to cope with the recent loss of his wife of more than 50 years. “There is a hole in my life. Thanksgiving and Christmas just seem so overwhelming.”\n\nDeacon deMena stressed the need for the bereaved to express their emotions and not hide them. He suggested several ways to incorporate the memory of the lost loved one in some way at a gathering can overcome some difficulties friends or family might have when bringing up the deceased.\n\n“Doing the holidays different is okay,” the Deacon said. “Things are not the same. There is no reason to act as if they are.”\n\nDeacon DeMena will be holding an Hour of Remembrance Prayer Vigil at 7 p.m. on Dec. 12 at St. Agnes Parish Chapel, 7775 Vanderbilt Beach Road, Naples. This is an hour before the Lord in prayer and music for all who are suffering or grieving in any way.\n\nFor more information about bereavement counseling, please contact Deacon deMena at deaconhenry@stagnesnaples.org.\n\nTraining Session\n\nFor those who are interested in becoming a Parish bereavement volunteer, the Diocese Office of Family Life is hosting a training called “There is Hope: Bereavement Training.” This will focus on training parish bereavement volunteers and those who speak with the bereaved and is not a workshop to help someone who has recently lost a loved one. Deacon deMena holds a Master’s Degree in Counseling with extensive training and experience in Bereavement. The training will be held Jan. 24-25, 10 a.m.-4 p.m., both days, at St. Ann Parish, 985 3rd St. S., Naples. The cost is $25 per person which includes lunch for both days and materials. More information can be found at www.dioceseofvenice.org/calendar The registration link is: https://dioceseofvenice.regfox.com/bereavement-training-jan2019 and please register by January 21.\n\nSarasota Red Mass Oct. 24\n\nRed Mass celebrating 10 years: Free to Worship Without Fear: The First Amendment guarantees it\n\nEvelyn L. Moya, Esq. (Special to the Florida Catholic)\n\n10/12/18\n\nSince the first Red Mass in the Diocese of Venice was held in Sarasota at St. Martha Church on March 14, 2008; more questions have arisen as to its significance, its history and purpose.\n\nThe Red Mass is a special liturgy steeped in Catholic Church tradition since 1245, when the first on record was held in the Cathedral of Paris. It is a liturgy based upon the prayers invoking the blessings of the Holy Spirit to bestow His gifts (among them: wisdom, understanding, counsel, knowledge) upon those who serve in the administration of justice.\n\nThe popular name “Red Mass’ was derived from the red vestments worn by the judges of the royal courts of Europe. However, it was King Edward I, who started the tradition in 1310, of convening the judges at Westminster Abbey for the annual Mass. The Red Mass is a continuing tradition in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Philippines, Scotland, Wales and other countries although Catholics may not be the majority of the countries’ population.\n\nThe first Red Mass in the United States was held at St. Peter and Paul Church in Detroit Michigan in 1877. However, the first official Red Mass is recognized as the one held in New York City in 1928. According to a Time Magazine article it was President Dwight Eisenhower, (Presbyterian) who encouraged his cabinet members to attend the Red Mass held in Washington, D.C., which he attended in 1953, in an effort “to show the nation’s communist adversaries that the United States was not anti-religion.”\n\nMany criticisms have been leveled against the practice of the Bench and Bar attending a Catholic Mass together. However, it must be noted that the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment guarantees the freedom of every individual to worship in the manner of the individual’s choice. After all, what is there to argue about when praying is asking for what is good. The Red Mass is open to every person of faith. Each event may include a renewal of the lawyer’s oath to serve in truth and justice.\n\nAt the nation’s capital, the Red Mass is celebrated annually on the Sunday before the first Monday in October, for opening of the term of the Supreme Court. Persons who serve in the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches of the government have frequently participated. In Tallahassee, the Red Mass is held before the opening of the State Legislature and includes all of the Bishops of Florida.\n\nThe Red Mass is presided by a Bishop. It is usually hosted by a Diocese, or Catholic law organizations such as a Thomas More Society (named after the Catholic chancellor beheaded by King Henry VIII for disobedience), or the John Carroll Society (named after the only Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence) or the Catholic Lawyers Guild, such as the one hosting the Red Mass 5:30 p.m., Oct. 24 at St. Martha Parish, 200 N. Orange Avenue, Sarasota.\n\nBishop Frank J. Dewane will be the principal celebrant. The Mass is intended for judges, lawyers, lawmakers, their families, and staff.\n\nThe Catholic Lawyers’ Guild of the Diocese of Venice is also introducing an award to a person the Guild deems as demonstrating the exemplary attributes of a faithful servant of the law while giving glory to God.\n\nFor additional information about the Red Mass, please call 941-316-9200.\n\nBishop Dewane will also be celebrating a Red Mass at noon, Nov. 16 at St. Catherine Parish, 820 Hickory St., Sebring. All Catholic members of the legal profession in the Eastern Deanery (Highlands, Hardee, DeSoto, Glades and Hendry counties) are invited and encouraged to attend. For additional information, please call the Parish at 863-385-0049.\n\nCreating a Safe Environment\n\nSpecial to the Florida Catholic\n\nRecent events continue to underscore the importance of protecting children, young people and adults from sexual abuse and supporting victims/survivors as they bravely come forward with their reports. All forms of sexual abuse are intrinsically evil, especially those that occur within the Catholic Church. It is the commitment of the Diocese to provide an environment which is safe and nurturing.\n\nThe mission of the Safe Environment Program is:\n\nTo provide required education for all employees (clergy, religious and laity), those volunteers and others regularly involved with minors, and parents, as to the issue of abuse of children including the detection, prevention and reporting of child abuse.\n\nTo provide required training programs for children and young people in our Catholic schools and religious education programs. This includes age appropriate materials pertaining to personal safety and information about improper touching and relationships. Children are not expected to be fully knowledgeable about child abuse or of the laws governing care of children but they need to know when they should seek assistance from a trusted adult.\n\nTo thoroughly screen and evaluate the background of all employees at the parishes, Catholic schools, and other diocesan entities – clergy, religious and laity – and those volunteers who work with children, young people, and vulnerable adults.\n\nTo hold those who minister in the Diocese of Venice – all employees (clergy, religious and laity) at the parishes, Catholic schools, and other diocesan entities and those volunteers who work with children, young people, and vulnerable adults – to Christ-centered and professional codes of conduct.\n\nSince 2002, the Diocese has engaged a professional company to conduct background screening through the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigation with results available to the Diocesan Safe Environment Coordinator within 24-48 hours. There have been over 35,541 background screenings and 33,700 persons trained in safe environment. In the last five years alone, 13,494 were background screened and 11,257 trained in safe environment.\n\nEmployees (clergy, religious and laity) and volunteers become certified in safe environment after completing a training session. During the sessions, attendees are trained: in the detection of grooming techniques by a potential sex offender; in the detection and prevention of abuse on a child or vulnerable adult; and in the detection of labor and sex trafficking. Additional training includes learning about National Hotline contacts for child, elder, labor or sex trafficking abuse, anti-cyber-bullying and anti-sexting resources, and procedures for reporting grooming techniques and abuse. The training also provides location-specific sex offender registries within a two-mile radius of each Catholic school in the Diocese.\n\nAttendees are also trained in Diocesan Procedures, especially the Code of Pastoral Conduct, the Code of Conduct for Volunteers Working with Minors, the Policy and Procedural Guidelines for the Diocese of Venice in Florida relating to the Protection of Children and Vulnerable Adults, and Electronic Fingerprinting Procedures. These codes, policies and procedures are accessible to the public on the Diocesan Safe Environment Website.\n\nIt is the duty of all persons to report abuse. The following are the mandatory steps regarding reporting:\n\nAn allegation of sexual abuse of a minor by anyone should be reported immediately to the Florida Department of Children and Families Child Abuse Hotline (800-96Abuse) and/or any Law enforcement agency.\n\nAn allegation of elder abuse by anyone should be reported immediately to the Elder Abuse Hotline (800-96Elder) and/or any Law enforcement agency.\n\nAn allegation of labor or sex trafficking abuse by anyone should be reported immediately to the National Human Trafficking Hotline (888-373-7888) and/or any Law enforcement agency.\n\nIf the alleged abuser is a Diocesan employee or volunteer, including clergy, also notify Victim Assistance Coordinator at 941-416-6114.\n\nOnce a report is made to the Victim Assistance Coordinator, the Diocesan Review Board is notified, primarily compromised of non-Diocesan-employed lay professionals, is notified. The board meets promptly to review the allegation, investigate the case, and make recommendations to the Bishop.\n\nEvery five years, employees and volunteers are background rescreened and employees are recertified in safe environment. The Diocese is informed by the State of Florida within 24 hours of the arrest of any of its employees, including clergy.\n\nEvery priest or deacon must be background screened at two levels – the State of Florida and the Federal Bureau of Investigation – and become certified in safe environment in order to minister in the Diocese of Venice. These requirements are in addition to a reference check and a letter of good standing from their bishop or provincial superior for religious order priests.\n\nIn the 2017-2018 academic year, 14,865 children and youth in parish religious education programs and Catholic schools were safe environment trained. Each Parish and Catholic school is yearly audited on its safe environment training for children and youth by the Diocese, and the information in the Diocesan Safe Environment Program is subject to national audits.\n\nParishes and Catholic schools are also required to publish information on proper reporting to the Department of Children and Families by posters and other forms of communication. The Diocese of Venice works hard to maintain safe environments and to bring awareness about abuse and how to properly report.\n\nThe Diocese is committed to providing a comprehensive Safe Environment Program in an effort to protect the most vulnerable from all types of abuse. An important part of this program is prayer. Each year, Bishop Dewane invites all faithful to join him in prayer for the victims/survivors at two special Masses held in April, National Child Abuse Prevention Month.\n\nWe must always endeavor to improve and move forward. An organizational change involves creating a vigilant culture of protection and healing. Anyone interested can become certified in safe environment and aide in maintaining safe environments in every parish, Catholic school, and diocesan entity.

Dewane read a book to children at Casa San Juan Bosco farmworker housing community of Catholic Charities Diocese of Venice Inc. in Arcadia.\n\nThe 39 children, from kindergarten through 4th grade, were participating in a summer afternoon reading program that was part of the Suncoast Campaign for Grade-Level Reading and made possible through the support of The Patterson Foundation with partnerships with The Community Foundation of Sarasota and the United Way Suncoast.\n\nBishop Dewane read “The Giving Tree,” a children’s picture book by Shel Silverstein. The book follows the lives of a female apple tree and a boy, who develop a relationship with one another. The tree is very “giving” and the boy evolves into a “taking” teenager, man, then elderly man. While the boy ages in the story, the tree addresses the boy as “Boy” his entire life.\n\nWhile reading the book, the Bishop made sure each of the children, who were seated attentively on the floor, could see the illustrations and pointing out some of the important details. Afterwards, the Bishop queried the inquisitive children about what lessons they learned.\n\nBased on the questions posed by Bishop Dewane and the responses he received, the children understood the positive messages from the book about giving and having a caring relationship with nature and those around them.\n\nThe summer reading program at Casa San Juan Bosco is three afternoons a week in June and July, and is part of a larger program which includes the arts and other educational activities. Throughout the summer the children were encouraged to read as many books as they could. The older children and volunteers would also read to the others in smaller groups. Throughout the summer, the children keep track of all the books they read and then write a short synopsis on each book to get credit.\n\nBy late June, Janet Seguera had read 10 books, which were marked in shiny stars on the Summer Reading Challenge board. “I love to read and sometimes read to my younger sisters. By reading, I learn so much about wonderful places and people. It’s fun.”\n\nThe Suncoast Campaign for Grade-Level Reading is part of a national campaign which unites community partners across the nation to make reading proficiently by the end of third grade a priority. This is to address the fact that two-thirds of children in 4th grade cannot read at grade-level. While it is understood that parents and good preschool teachers teach reading from birth through 3rd Grade, in fourth grade students must use their reading skills to learn, and teachers no longer teach students how to read.\n\nLocally, the communitywide effort includes Manatee and Sarasota counties as well as the Catholic Charities program in Arcadia. The effort focuses on helping all children, especially those from low-income families, succeed in school and life by ensuring they read on grade level by the end of third grade.\n\nBishop Dewane said he was delighted to be a part of this outreach and thanked representatives of the Suncoast Campaign for Grade-level Reading for recognizing the Catholic Charities program as worthy of their outreach as well as the Patterson Foundation which also supported helped with the program.\n\n“It was an honor to read for the children and a privilege to be here to support this reading program for these young boys and girls in Arcadia,” Bishop Dewane said. “Reading is an important foundation of learning that can be carried forward throughout one’s life. Catholic Charities and the Diocese both look forward to working with these partners in the future to help promote literacy which is so important in the life of all students.”\n\nSummertime and the Giving is Easy 2018\n\nAnnual Campaign to support Catholic Charities\n\nStaff Report\n\n7/13/2018\n\nEvery day vulnerable people living throughout Southwest Florida go to their local Catholic Charities Diocese of Venice Inc. office seeking relief.

Frail and isolated elders come to the Senior Support Coordination Program to live independently. A victim of labor trafficking recently expressed his gratitude from the work of Catholic Charities to create a stable and safe living environment for his family. “I have not the right words for all who have helped us, but I am so thankful.”\n\nSheltering the homeless.\n\nThe North Port Family Haven provides emergency housing and long-term case management for homeless families. At Our Mother’s House in Venice, desperate mothers and their children have a safe place to live where they can work toward self-sufficiency. One mother recently completed the extensive education program, leaving with a stable job and housing for her and her child and a very bright future. “Our Mother’s House changed my life. I was essentially homeless with a young child and no options. I was desperate. Today, I am a very different person. I never would have thought it was possible.” Additionally, Casa San Jose in Sarasota gives those living with HIV a proper residence to enhance the quality of their life. The Veteran’s House, also in Sarasota, offers a deserving veteran a roof over his/her head.\n\nFeeding the hungry.\n\nFood Pantries located throughout Southwest Florida distribute thousands of pounds of food every week.
