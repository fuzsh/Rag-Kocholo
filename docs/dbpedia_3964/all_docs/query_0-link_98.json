        "text": "The structure itself is of cruciform shape and was erected just before the turn of this century. The Polish Catholics acquired it in 1953 and adapted it for Catholic worship. The style of architecture, eminently in vogue at the time when it was built, may be described as “neo-gothic”, although some students of ecclesiastical architecture would consider this term a misnomer\n\nInteriors are kept simple in design. . The High Altar remains as the focal point and is raised on three steps with a splendidly hand-carved reredos, the work of Mr. Eugene Chruscicki, a well known and talented Toronto artist of Polish extraction.\n\nThe main theme of the reredos is the Baptism of Christ by John the Baptist in the Jordan. Additionally, there are depictions of the Four Evangelists, each with his traditional symbol: St. Matthew, with Christ’s head; St. Mark, the lion; St. Luke, an ox; The and St. John the Divine, an eagle. Rays of light emanate from God the Father ( centre-top), who is quoted by the words inscribed in Polish on the wall at the entrance to the sanctuary:\n\n“This is my beloved Son, in Whom I am well pleased\n\nTThe traditional Fourteen Stations of the Cross are by no means to be overlooked; each of them was a donation from one of Saint John’s parishioners. They all depict graphically the actual sufferings of Christ and His Blessed Mother on Good Friday. The texts, which accompany each one, of course, have been engraved in Polish, the language of the majority of the founders of this parish.\n\nThe sanctuary also holds the bishop’s “cathedra”’ the pulpit, and the sedilia (special seats) for the clergy. In the south transept is the Chapel of Our Lady . It is customary, especially in cathedral-churches, to dedicate a chapel to God, in honour of His Blessed Mother. Services are held here on weekdays, particularly during the months that are dedicated to and associated with the Blessed Mother.\n\nIn the north transept, in the chapel dedicated to our Lord under the title of the Sacred Heart, is the Baptistry ( Baptismal Font), whose font was also designed and executed by Mr. Chruscicki, in order to conform with the sanctuary furnishings."
