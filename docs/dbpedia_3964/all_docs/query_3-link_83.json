        "text": "The Holy Trinity Parish started out as a small community chapel situated on Village East Avenue. The original chapel, named Mary Help of Christians, was built in 1991 originally to serve the needs of the Catholic community of Village East. Through the years, the pastoral needs of the community began increasing, and Bishop Gungon of the Diocese of Antipolo, recognizing this need, issued a decree establishing The Holy Trinity Quasi-Parish on December 14, 2000. The Quasi-Parish included: Gruar I, Riverside, Cypress, Villa Olympia, Mayfield and Village East. On November 29, 2002, the community originally served by the Mary Help of Christians chapel bonded together by their faith in Jesus Christ and His Church to lay the foundation for the Canonical Erection of Holy Trinity as a Parish. The once small community in Village East quickly grew into crowds of faithful who religiously attend the Eucharist in the tiny space provided by the chapel; and so to serve and house the fast growing Catholic community, a new and bigger church was conceptualized and this is what stands today as home of the Holy Trinity Parish.\n\nThe Holy Trinity Parish has two buildings: the Church building, and the convent which serves as the residence of the parish priest and houses the Parish office. The current convent that stands west of the Church building was constructed in 2002 on land that was donated by Antipolo Properties, the developer of Village East; but it was only in December of 2003 that Samahang Katoliko finally and officially turned over the title of this 5, 196-square-meter land to the Diocese of Antipolo.\n\nThe construction of the Church building began in 2005, with Ground Breaking in March of that year. Construction moved on through fund raising projects initiated by our parish priest, Fr. Noel Rabonza III, and his marketing team, Team Holy Trinity, supported by the Parish Pastoral Council and the community. On Palm Sunday 0f 2007, the Holy Trinity Parish community celebrated the Holy Eucharist in the new Church building for the first time. The crucifix at the center of the sanctuary, designed and crafted by Mr. Daniel dela Cruz — a known sculptor who uses metal as medium, was unveiled in April of 2011. Although far from finished, the new Church building has become the center of worship and prayer for the faithful within the Holy Trinity Parish.\n\nThe Church building, as it stands today, was made possible through the efforts of our Parish priest, Rev. Fr. Pedro Noel Rabonza III, and the help of the Holy Trinity Parish community. It was because of Fr. Noel’s able leadership and outstanding organizational skills that construction of the Holy Trinity Parish Church building finally began. He mobilized parishioners, community-leaders and community-oriented companies into assisting the construction effort through monetary and material donations, and sponsorships. Fr. Noel established the parish’s marketing team, which he called Team HTP, to lead and motivate members of the community in participating and supporting the fund-raising activities of the parish.\n\nAs Fr. Noel is fond of saying: “Our job is not yet done.” There is more to be witnessed and experienced in the life of the Holy Trinity Parish community, and we hope you will join us in our journey towards becoming a community of God’s love."
