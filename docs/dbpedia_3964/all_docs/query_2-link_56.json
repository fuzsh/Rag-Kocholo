        "text": "New Leadership and a New Mission\n\nFr. Joseph Eckert, SVD. Date unknown (possibly 1930s)\n\nAfter the death of Fr. Tolton, the Archdiocese did not have a solid plan for what to do with the Black community that was rapidly expanding at St. Monica. In a 1917 letter to the provincial of the Society of the Divine Word, Fr. J.A. Burgmer, Mundelein granted the Techny Fathers control of St. Monica and authority to begin an apostolate to the African American community in Bronzeville. St. Monica would be designated the “ethnic” parish for Black Catholics in the city, as there were Irish, German, and Polish churches. In a controversial move, Mundelein forbade white Catholics from attending St. Monica, although he allowed Black Catholics to attend church elsewhere if convenient. Cardinal Mundelein believed that this measure would strengthen and unify the Black community, but it caused Black parishioners to protest, as they believed that they were being “segregated” into a single church. The first SVD pastor, Fr. Augustine Reissman, felt the brunt of the community’s anger and left in 1921, feeling singled out and left to dry.\n\nThat year, the SVDs chose Fr. Joseph Eckert, SVD to replace him. Eckert, born in Germany in 1884 and at that time a professor at the Divine Word seminary, was loath to leave his beloved teaching post. But he acquiesced, remembering what inspired his vocation was a desire to save souls. With zeal, he quickly endeared himself, often personally visiting every new parishioner at their homes, introducing himself to non-Catholics, and enmeshing himself in the community. His singular rule was to “be kind and charitable to all.”\n\n“…Within a few weeks I became accustomed to the ordinary routine of parish life and I began to like it, especially in view of the fact that the Colored Catholics responded well and seemed to take an active interest in parish affairs. I also came to realize what a gigantic task lay before me—a task greater than either my superiors or I ever dreamed of… I became fully aware that there was a real soul-saving and pioneer missionary work before me and not merely a reclamation of lost sheep, but that I had the best opportunities to give my missionary vocation a real and severe test. I made up my mind to go out and get converts…”\n\n-Fr. Joseph Eckert, undated\n\nIn 1924, Mundelein merged St. Monica with St. Elizabeth, which had been steadily declining. By the time St. Elizabeth burned down in 1930, the congregation was too large for a single parish. Rather than build a larger church, Mundelein pragmatically looked to the equally struggling St. Anselm. In 1932, over the protests of the remaining whites, Mundelein gave St. Anselm's to the SVDs with Fr. Eckert as its new pastor. He instructed Eckert: “Take good care of all the people in the parish, irrespective of race or color, and make as many converts as possible… Fill St. Anselm’s church.” Eckert recounted how the white parishioners were shocked to learn that Eckert was white. They assumed that the priest making waves at St. Elizabeth could only have been Black. From then on, the Divine Word fathers would be a fixture of the neighborhood.\n\nLawrence Thornton, SVD, with St. Elizabeth youth, c. 1954. Thornton was the 30th Black priest ordained to the Divine Word fathers. He would later become pastor of Our Lady of the Gardens.\n\nCorpus Christi’s pastor had wanted to open his parish to minister to Black Catholics as early as the 1920s. However, Mundelein adamantly maintained that Ss. Elizabeth and Anselm would be the only “ethnic” Black parishes for the South Side. The Franciscans were entrusted the shrinking and crumbling parish and were instructed to minister to the remaining whites. By the end of the 20s, both mass attendance and school enrollment at Corpus Christi dropped to less than 100. In 1932, after urging from Fr. Eckert, the cardinal saw the writing on the wall and gave the Franciscans permission to open the parish to the Black community. Seven years later, the friars were confirming over 500 adults at Corpus Christi.\n\nFranciscan friars enjoying a moment of fun at Corpus Christi, c. 1950s. From left to right: Frs. Benedict Hagen, Ernest Koufhold, and Maurice Amann, pastor. Koufhold earned renown and distinction in the city for serving as the chaplain of Cook County Jail for 25 years.\n\nHoly Angels and St. Ambrose remained predominantly white through the first half of the twentieth century. Holy Angels’ school did not enroll its first Black student until the 1940s; in 1957, the number was 4. When the racial makeup of Washington Park and Kenwood shifted with the second wave of the Great Migration following World War II, Holy Angels and St. Ambrose—rather than delegated to a religious order such as Ss. Elizabeth, Anselm, and Corpus Christi had been—remained staffed by diocesan priests.\n\nIn 1969, Fr. George Clements was named pastor of Holy Angels. Clements was the second Black priest ordained by the Archdiocese of Chicago and had previously served as an associate at St. Ambrose and St. Dorothy. During the 70s and 80s, Fr. Clements brought national renown to Holy Angels for his tireless work promoting social and racial justice in the neighborhood.\n\nVelma Barker-Hill, who came to Holy Angels at age 19 after marching with Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in Mississippi, considered Fr. George a “genuine human being.” When her husband Michael converted to the faith and joined the parish in the 1990s, she remembers how overjoyed Fr. George was, taking him around the parish for a tour of all the buildings. Fr. Clements also paid a personal visit to their son, along with all his teachers, when he was in the hospital from a car accident. Those kinds of gestures made Velma and her husband feel like the parish really cared for their well-being.\n\nFr. Maurice Amann, OFM and Fr. George Clements, celebrating at Corpus Christi.\n\nBack to top\n\nReligious Devotion\n\nThe Bronzeville, Washington Park, and Kenwood communities were never shy about showing off their faith, even in the early days of the neighborhood. When Chicago hosted the 1926 Eucharistic Congress, the effort was made to display the size and devotion of the Black community at St. Elizabeth. At the time Fr. Eckert had amassed a Holy Name Society of over 500 men, and nearly the entire parish turned out to come and see the distinguished guest Fr. Norman DuKette, at the time one of five Black priests in the United States. A crowd estimated between ten and twenty thousand, Blacks and whites alike, gathered at St. Elizabeth for the Congress.\n\nIdentified in this closeup is Joseph Robichaux Jr., a St. Elizabeth Altar Boy who later ran the neighborhood’s Catholic Youth Organization building.\n\n“When I was a small boy in the late 1940s, my mother took me to Corpus Christi to see the Living Stations of the Cross during Lent. She said they were the most beautiful stations I would see anywhere, and they were.”\n\n-Francis Cardinal George, 2001\n\nCorpus Christi first staged a live reenactment of the Lenten Stations of the Cross in 1937 under the direction of Fr. David Fotchman, OFM. Everything from the costumes and sets were designed and made by the congregation. The cast was made of parishioners, who performed and pantomimed the stations while one of the parish priests narrated the Passion. This proved to be a popular yearly production for the parish and neighborhood.\n\nThe Living Stations grew in renown and attracted attention from its appearances in newspapers and the Catholic Extension magazine. In 1957, WGNTV televised the reenactment in a program called Faith of our Founders several times. While this brought further fame to the parish, a contemporary chronicler noted that the cast and crew found the TV directors—who insisted on adding more drama and action into the pantomime—onerous. The cast preferred to keep the Living Stations a live—and local—production. Pictured here are scenes from one of the 1950s productions.\n\nChange Once More… Our Lady of Africa\n\nAfter the 1960s, Bronzeville, Washington Park, and Kenwood started to undergo a drastic change. Many of the middle-class residents moved out, making the area poorer. Unscrupulous landlords cut up and compartmentalized the older, larger homes, cramming families into small apartments. Over time parishes had to reckon with the effects of this shift, in drug and gang violence. The parishes responded to these changes, often taking more overtly activist and political stances on issues of the day.\n\nIn the 1990s, one Corpus Christi parishioner felt called to bring a new light into the neighborhood. Dr. Olukemi Ebunoluwa worked daily ministering to single mothers in the nearby Robert Taylor projects. These women were often abandoned, poor, or struggling with the fallout of gang violence and addiction. Dr. Olukemi wanted to bring a new symbol of hope into the South Side. That symbol would be Our Lady of Africa.\n\nShe commissioned a local diocesan artist, Fr. Anthony Brankin, to design a bronze statue for Our Lady. The design was based off an existing statue dedicated to Our Lady of Africa in Algiers, Algeria, which was venerated by Christian and Muslim alike in the basilica at the heart of the city, but with a decidedly more African likeness. The parish connected the statue to the movement “One Mother, Many Titles,” showing the miraculous power of Mary all over the world.\n\nThe statue of Our Lady of Africa at the Holy Angels site, taken 2021.\n\nAt the 1996 dedication of the statue, Dr. Ebunoluwa drew parallels from the life of Mary to the women she served at the Robert Taylor homes and elsewhere. These women, like Mary, had to raise their children in a violent world and without support. She hoped that the statue would promote racial healing and provide a way for the neighborhood to beseech Mary for her intercession and protection.\n\nBack to top"
