        "text": "Return to Your Parish Family\n\nRecently I had a conversation with a new family sending their children to school here. I want to share a part of that conversation with you as it is important to the Stewardship Way of Life.\n\nRead more …\n\nPart 15: An Ideal Parish is Universal\n\nI know that many of you, like me, can remember a time when maps were on paper. And, perhaps, you also remember being frustrated when the actual road you needed was on the fold of the map! But now maps have moved to smartphones and tablets and are actual satellite images of the land. Nowadays any person can look up any place in the world and have a relatively recent satellite image of that place.\n\nRead more …\n\nPart 14: An Ideal Parish Shares\n\n\"Mine! Mine! Mine!\" How often did we yell that when we were children? Perhaps it was \"my\" toy, or \"my\" room, or \"my\" cloths, or \"my\" iPod (…or CD… or cassette… or 8-track - depending on your age, ha!). And I wish I could say that it is only young people who are so concerned with \"mine!\" As adults we argue over \"my\" stapler, \"my\" property, \"my\" office, or \"my\" duty. Sometimes the little kid in each of us comes out when something of \"mine\" is threatened. And this only means that we need to learn to share.\n\nRead more …\n\nPart 13: An Ideal Parish Fosters Vocations\n\n“Come out, Come out, from wherever you are!” I remember yelling that as a kid playing hide-and-seek. What a fun game that was! Whether you were “it,” or you were the one hiding, I think hide-and-seek was an early exercise of mental espionage. I mean, the game itself is a mental exercise of out-guessing one’s opponent: “He thinks I’ll hide here… so I’m going to hide over there;” or “He usually hides in this place… so I’m going to look in a new place.”\n\nRead more …\n\nPart 12: An Ideal Parish is Ministerial\n\nThere are very few things that are as nice as good service. Like waiters or waitresses that provide the perfect balance of conversation and attention, neither too wordy nor too distant. Or a department store attendant who recognizes your confused look and gently offers help, takes you to the right spot, and makes sure your questions are answered. Or like a computer technician who recognizes the frustration in your voice, asks truly pertinent questions, and leads you through troubleshooting until your problem is resolved.\n\nRead more …\n\nPart 11: An Ideal Parish is Youth Filled\n\nI remember hearing about Ponce de Leon searching for the fountain of youth: a magical water source capable of reversing the aging process. Alas, never did he find it, nor does it seem that such a fountain exists. Yet now-a-days it seems that people search for their own fountain of youth through beauty products, weight loss programs, or even medical procedures\n\nRead more …\n\nHour of Mercy\n\nNearly one hundred years ago, the Church was blessed with the devotion to the Divine Mercy, first promoted by St. Faustina Kowalska. Flowing from the Divine Mercy came the new devotional, the Divine Mercy Chaplet, which, prayed on rosary beads, begs for Jesus’ sorrowful passion to pour mercy onto those for whom it is prayed.\n\nRead more …\n\nPart 10: An Ideal Parish is Familial\n\nCan you guess where these lyrics come from: Sometimes you want to go / Where everybody knows your name, / and they're always glad you came. / You wanna be where you can see, / our troubles are all the same / You wanna be where everybody knows / Your name.\n\nRead more …\n\nPart 9: An Ideal Parish is Catechetical\n\nI love it when children discover echo spots. Maybe it's in the foyer of a church or in a huge cavern but when toddlers discover an echo it brings them to a stop. Their hands go out. Their eyes start casting back and forth. They concentrate on their hearing by tilting their head slightly upward. Then they squeeze out a little bleat or they began saying, \"Hey!\" All the while hearing echo follow upon echo.\n\nRead more …\n\nPart 8: An Ideal Parish is Sacramental\n\nI have been told that an earthquake in Minnesota caused some hot springs in Arkansas to stop being hot springs. Imagine that! That there is such a labyrinth of underground streams that an earthquake hundreds of miles to the North can stop water flowing hundreds of miles to the South!\n\nRead more …\n\nPart 7: An Ideal Parish is Charismatic (Charism-filled)\n\nI think that I am a bit of a pyromaniac; I like campfires. I’m the kind of person that, when I’m setting by a fire, I can’t just let the flames burn low. I like getting up, rolling the logs, adding new fuel, repositioning the embers, and getting a better oxygen flow. Frankly, it makes people around the fire a little uneasy because sparks tend to fly everywhere.\n\nRead more …\n\nPart 6: An Ideal Parish is Pneumatological\n\nSome words are just freaky looking. Like \"onomatopoeia\" or \"kakorrhaphiophobic.\" See? Freaky! (Yes, both of these are actual English words.) Theology has its own share of \"freaky words\" too. Recently we saw the word \"kerygma\" which is a fancy way of referring to the basic message of the Gospel: God's love Redeems us from sin so that through the Advent of Christ all who Confess his name may receive Eternal life (G.R.A.C.E.).\n\nRead more …\n\nPart 5: An Ideal Parish is Kerygmatic\n\nPopcorn is a funny little food. Good corn gets so old that it completely hardens with a seemingly impenetrable shell. But if you take that same corn and subject it to heat, the inside of the kernel gets so hot-and-bothered that not even the hard shell can contain the pressure! Then pop-you've got popcorn! What was once so hard you could not bite it without chipping a tooth now is so soft you could smoosh it with your fingers.\n\nRead more …\n\nPart 4: An Ideal Parish is Missionary\n\nThere is a certain appeal to being a missionary. Perhaps you, like me, have fantasized about going to a foreign country to preach the Gospel. St. Thérèse of Lisieux did. She said, “I would travel to every land to preach Thy name, O my Beloved…I would spread the Gospel to the ends of the earth…I would be a Missionary” (The Story of a Soul, pp. 181–182). But the truth is, if we do not have a missionary heart in our own home, workplace or parish, being a missionary anywhere else will only ever be a fantasy.\n\nRead more …\n\nPart 3: An Ideal Parish is Communal\n\nIt’s kinda like four-year-old soccer. I’m referring to our instinct for community. I’m sure most people have seen four-year-old soccer. It’s cute. Tedious, but cute. All the kids know is that the game has something to do a ball, a net, and an opposing team. Outside of that, it’s pretty much a mosh-pit of little legs, distracted looks, random kicks, and the occasional pouting lip.\n\nRead more …\n\nPart 2: An Ideal Parish is Christological\n\nI like dipping bread in oil. It’s yummy! Especially if the bread is fresh and the oil has some seasoning in it. So, it struck me the other day: our parish should be like bread dipped in oil. Sure, I know that sounds kind of weird, but let me explain.\n\nRead more …\n\nThis is My Home\n\nRecently, our teachers and staff started a string of appreciation emails for why we are grateful for working (ministering) here at St. Francis. That has been playing on my mind ever since, and so, here is my response…\n\nRead more …\n\nPart 1: An Ideal Parish is Trinitarian\n\nEvery vehicle has a carburetor, a central piece of the engine. Every computer has a Central Processing Unit (CPU). Every arch has a central keystone. But what is the central mystery of our faith?\n\nRead more …\n\nIntroduction to Characteristics of an Ideal Parish\n\nIt never hurts to return to the basics. This is an introductory article to a fifteen-part series called “The Vision of an Ideal Parish” based on an article Dr. Peter Williamson published in 2016. Our buildings serve our mission—now let’s return to the basics of our identity as a parish and reignite ourselves in our mission to save souls!\n\nRead more …\n\nRepent and Believe in the Gospel\n\nMaranatha! Come, Lord Jesus! The Christian confession of faith is unique in many ways; but one stands out among others: God came to earth searching for us. Think of that! God sought us. This is the Good News. We call it the kerygma.\n\nRead more …\n\nSolemnity of Dedication of Our Altar: March 13\n\nI remember as a child reading The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, and coming to that fateful moment of the book when Azlan was slain on the Altar. I also remember my teacher telling us that that was a symbol of Jesus being slain on the altar in our church. That image never left me.\n\nRead more …\n\nSt. Francis of Assisi Transformed the Catholic Church\n\n\"Francis, go and rebuild my, house, which, as you can see, is totally in ruin.\" Many times we, here at St. Francis Parish, have heard this story of St. Francis when, kneeling in the Church of San Damiano he audibly heard a voice say these words.\n\nRead more …\n\nLent?\n\nDo you remember that old Looney Tunes cartoon with Frisky the puppy and Claude the house cat? It is the one where Claude, a yellow cat with a red-tipped tail, would be walking through the house minding his own business. Then, out of nowhere, Frisky the puppy would come up behind Him and start barking, \"Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!!\"\n\nRead more …\n\nThis is The Gift\n\nI just left Jam for the Lamb, which is a morning of Worship, Praise and Adoration that kicked off our Catholic Schools Week. It is intoxicating to hear the children sing so wonderfully! The Eucharist is exposed in the gym, center stage, and all morning young persons, faculty, staff, and parents flood the gym with prayer. It truly is proof that faith is living and effective on our campus and in our school!\n\nRead more …\n\nSaint Clare of Assisi\n\nIt has been said that Ignatius of Loyola learned his rules of discernment by comparing worldly reading to reading the lives of the saints.\n\nRead more …\n\nTime is Precious\n\nI snapped a pic the other day of the clock I have in the confessional. I couldn’t help myself. It read 1:23 pm on 12/31/23... Do you notice the repetition? 1-2-3-1-2-3-1-2-3. How unique it that?\n\nRead more …\n\nFinding Joy in Life\n\nNow that we have come to the end of Christmas season: “Maintain the desire of God in our hearts, and allow the Lord to outline His Plan to us through the little things of life so that we can have an Epiphany Experience!”\n\nRead more …\n\nSeeking Home...\n\nA stranger in a foreign land, I was exhausted and homesick as my summer Spanish immersion ended in Guatemala. The rusty minivan arriving outside my small residence filled me with joyful hope. I was flying home to the U.S. and would be, at long last, completely happy. Or so I thought...\n\nRead more …\n\nRecalculating\n\n“Recalculating.” When GPS navigation systems were first invented it was common for people to hear the statement “recalculating.” This happened when a person took a new direction on the way to a destination not programed in the GPS. It happened to me a lot!\n\nRead more …\n\nA Diamond for Christmas\n\nMay I give you a diamond for Christmas? I would love to say that I could give you a real diamond for Christmas; but, as it is, I must settle for a spiritual diamond.\n\nRead more …\n\nThank You for Your Tithe\n\nI would like to thank you for your tithe. Financially speaking, it takes $5.6 million to fund our parish operations ($107,000 weekly). This money comes through our Sunday collections. Because of your generosity, even though we see yearly increases in wages, raises, and inflation, we have not incurred debt. This is due to your generosity.\n\nRead more …\n\nAdvent - Repent and Believe in the Gospel\n\nMaranatha! Come Lord Jesus! The Christian confession of faith is absolutely unique in many ways; but one stands out among others: God came to earth searching for us. Think of that! God sought us. This is the Good News. We call it the kerygma. What, then, is the kerygma? It is the basic proclamation of the Gospel. Essentially Jesus Himself is the kerygma.\n\nRead more …\n\nTime for Our ‘Grit and Grind’\n\nAs the saying goes, “You cannot love what you do not know.” Our formation in stewardship is a way for us to grow in our love and commitment to this way of life. The Stewardship Way of Life is the way every single one of us participates in the mission of the Gospel.\n\nRead more …\n\nBrief History of Stewardship in the Diocese of Wichita\n\nJust as a fish tank needs a delicately balanced environment for fish to thrive, the Diocese of Wichita provided the right environment for stewardship to thrive in the years immediately following Vatican II. The ingredients for this balance were fourfold: inspired pastors, highly engaged lay leadership, visionary bishops, and a collaborative presbyterate.\n\nRead more …\n\nA Brief Tour of Some Renovated Spaces\n\nNow that we have entered our newly renovated Church, I wanted to take a moment to go over some key elements. This renovation is not simply about updating areas that were in need of a refresh or better function, but to improve the space with beautiful architectural elements, and an increased focus on liturgical tradition.\n\nRead more …\n\nThe Rite of Blessing for Our Church Doors\n\nThere is a very important expression in Church formation, “lex orandi, lex credenda, lex vivendi,” meaning, “the law of praying leads to the law of believing, which leads to the law of living.” This essentially means that the way you pray determines the way you believe; and the way you believe determines the way you live.\n\nRead more …\n\nPillars of Formation\n\nI want to make an analogous connection between these architectural aspects and stewardship. I believe they can be connected to the four pillars of stewardship:\n\nRead more …\n\nA Parish Technology Guild\n\nWith internal Church renovations being complete, and having returned home for Mass, it is time to form a Parish Technology Guild to help oversee our technology needs. There are several systems at play in our Sacristy, Vestibule, Bell Tower, and Church. This guild would oversee maintaining these systems and maximizing their potential for parish use.\n\nRead more …\n\nWelcome to Our Renovated Church!\n\nIt is my hope that as you enter our newly renovated church, you are struck by its beauty, simplicity and architectural integrity. It has been an honor and privilege to oversee the past four months of construction (June 1 to Sept. 30), working with Alloy Architecture and Simpson Construction to achieve this wonderful update.\n\nRead more …\n\nAn Instinctive Humility\n\nAs some of you know, I recently went to the Walnut Valley Bluegrass Festival in the greater-metropolitan area of Winfield, Kansas. It was a great trip again, with wonderful fellowship, delicious food, good music, and mild weather.\n\nRead more …\n\nPlease, Tithe\n\nGod has called us, as stewards, to tithe generously, proportionately, and sacrificially 10% of our income. Consider this: your tithe guarantees the primacy of heavenly, faith-based goals over and above earthly, terrestrial desires. As you prayerfully consider your tithe, how close are you to God’s 10% goal?\n\nRead more …\n\nWe Are Less Without You\n\nHave you ever driven by a field of sunflowers in the morning with the sun rising in the eastern sky? They lift their drooping Heads and awake as if from slumber and they bask in the rays of the sun as it crests into the sky.\n\nRead more …\n\nIntolerable Patience\n\nI counsel you to intolerable patience...\n\nLike Michael Jordan... he was patient with his growth, but intolerable with imperfection. It is said that he shot 1000 free throws every day of his career. Really?\n\nRead more …\n\nMaintaining Joy\n\nJoy is the vibrancy of life. If joy were visible, it would be the color of life. Joy changes life from being monochromatic, black and white, to a kaleidoscope of light. It is my prayer that God will fill each of us with Joy.\n\nRead more …\n\nMore Than Bricks & Mortar\n\nThe most famous stories about St. Francis were written by St. Bonaventure in a book titled The Life of St. Francis. Here is one story that is very familiar to many people:\n\nRead more …\n\nEntering Into Religious Life\n\nEntering into Religious Life We are so blessed at St. Francis to have two women from our parish currently enter a religious order.\n\nRead more …\n\nFoundations of Catholic Bioethics\n\n“Out of the mouth of babes and infants, you have perfected praise.” (Ps 8:3) Some of the most difficult questions to answer come from the mouth of babes and infants. And the attempt to answer them puts the most intellectual adults to shame.\n\nRead more …\n\nA Parish with a Charism for Confession - Part 2\n\nOne of the reasons why Saint Francis of Assisi parish is able to have a multitude of days and hours of Confession available is because of our use of Confession during Mass. There are some who, when we started this practice, did not like it; but have since come to see its value and beauty.\n\nRead more …\n\nProtect Human Life\n\n“A person is a person, no matter how small.” This simple wisdom given to us by Dr. Suess in Horton Hears a Who, captures a profound Christian truth. A person is a person no matter how small. Human life begins at conception.\n\nRead more …\n\nThe Definition of Christian Stewardship\n\nGod will not be out done in generosity. This concept should instill in us trust in our life as a Christian Steward. The spirituality of Stewardship encourages us to constantly take stock of our lives as disciples and offer our actions in a grateful response to all that God has given to us.\n\nRead more …\n\nTo Live in Ec-stacis\n\nWhat does it mean to live? To be called from the grave that a spirit might be put in you and that life might dwell within you. To live is to be “ec-stasis”. It’s not to implode or to explode. I use those images because it helps us understand what it means to be “ec-stasis”.\n\nRead more …\n\nA Parish with a Charism for Confession - Part 1\n\nIt is inspiring to us priests at Saint Francis, witnessing just how long the Confession lines get before the 5:30 evening Masses. Fr. Meng and I were discussing this specifically about confessions during Holy Week. During that week we had multiple priests every evening hearing confessions.\n\nRead more …\n\nA Message During “Pride Month” - Part 2\n\nIn addition to my message in last week’s Father’s Focus, it’s worth taking this time to explain a bit of the reasoning behind why the Church teaches what it does and why it simply cannot, and will not, ever change.\n\nRead more …\n\nA Message During “Pride Month” - Part 1\n\nAs we’ve entered into the first weeks of June, you will notice that the news and marketing campaigns for a vast part of Western society are once again celebrating June as LGBTQ “Pride Month.” I feel that this is a topic that should, and must, be addressed from the pulpit. However, I want to be very precise in exactly how I do this, and so I want to give you my a personal history.\n\nRead more …\n\nSt. Michael's Lent, Fasting, and Digitial Media\n\nOur Church has a wealth of traditions that help the faithful ascend to moral virtue and combat the vices that distract us from the ultimate goal, union with Christ in the beatific vision. One such tradition quickly approaching is \"Saint Michael's Lent,\" a nonobligatory devotion that began in the 13th Century.\n\nRead more …\n\nA Catholic Perspective on Crime and Criminal Justice\n\nThe United States Catholic Conference of Bishops issued this publication in 2000, noting that our response is a “moral test for our nation and a challenge for our Church.” Over two decades later, this moral test and challenge remain imperative and are worth reflecting on as Catholics seek answers in a culture of moral decline.\n\nRead more …\n\nHospitality and Our Borders: A Reflection on the Border Crisis\n\nRecently my family and I were blessed to go on a pilgrimage to Mexico City to see Our Lady of Guadalupe. One of the highlights of our time there was being able to spend some time with an organization called \"Hope for the Poor\", whose ministry centers around helping the homeless by giving them food and shelter as well as avenues to healing, intervention, and Catholic teaching. In our brief time there, we were able to enter a bit of their world.\n\nRead more …\n\nThe Catholic Church's Position on Immigration Reform\n\nWith the presidential election cycle already in progress with the airing of the first Presidential Debate, Catholic American's must bring to mind their Catholic morality as it applies to some of the most pressing issues of our time. In doing so, one will be equipped to make a knowledgeable decision in the ballot booth. Please consider these excerpts from a USCCB article on immigration reform.\n\nRead more …\n\nPlant A Seed of Kindness - An Instructional Response to the \"Pride\" Community\n\nAt the closing of \"Pride Month,\" let us take a moment to consider a few things. First, always defy the stereotype that people think you are. To modern American culture, anything less than the total enthusiastic celebration of all things \"pride\" suggests one is filled with hatred and bigotry. So, in response, never, ever act like the stereotype they think you are. We can improve so much of life through one simple rule: be kind.\n\nRead more …\n\nUnderstanding Spiritual Joy Through the Example of St. John the Baptist\n\nIn June, we celebrate the birth of St. John the Baptist who is patron saint of JOY! It’s often a battle to hold on to joy amidst the trials and crosses of life in our world today. True joy, however, is not a fleeting feeling or emotion, but a spiritual fruit of the Holy Spirit that arises out of God’s grace and being mindful of and working against the things that rob us of that joy. Be on the lookout for the 7 thieves of joy, or the seven deadly sins.\n\nRead more …\n\nCourage and Encourage: A Catholic Apostolate for LGBTQ Support\n\nAs we continue the month of June and the culture at large supports and affirms the LGBTQ community through the celebration of “Pride month,” it is essential to remember the Catholic position on homosexuality.\n\nRead more …\n\nKnow it's Not Done\n\nOn August 14, 1999 if, someone would have asked me, \"Do you know Maria (my wife)?\" I would have said, \"YES! Of course. I know her favorite song, band, favorite color, her family, and where she went to school. I know her. I am about to profess my love to her in front of God, family, and friends.\" However, after five years of marriage, I could confidently say I knew Maria more.\n\nRead more …\n\nThe Church Teaching on Homosexuality and Sexual Identity\n\nJune signals the beginning of \"Pride\" month in secular society, a time dedicated to celebrating the LGBTQ community and the 1969 Stonewall Uprising in Manhattan, a demonstration considered a \"tipping point for the Gay Liberation Movement.\"\n\nRead more …\n\nPornagraphy and Human Objectification\n\nWhat happens when we lose sight of how we were created? What happens when we see God's commands as arbitrary or pick and choose which to follow without understanding the \"why\"? He longs to protect us. He sees the grave consequences when many times we don't. In the case of pornography, it can lead to devastating ripples that greatly affect others.\n\nRead more …\n\nProtecting Our Children from Sexual Perversion\n\nIn today's digital age, children are exposed to various influences much earlier than previous generations. Among these are sexual perversion and inappropriate content media, which can have lasting impacts on their understanding of relationships and sex. As parents and guardians, it is crucial to guide our children properly and supervise against their exposure to such content, ensuring a healthy development.\n\nRead more …\n\nEvangelization and the Wildfire Ministry\n\nChristians are called to Evangelize. In Luke 24:46-47, it is written: \"that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in His name to all nations.\" The season of Easter is a perfect time to recall, celebrate, and share this good news. For many reasons, however, people feel uncomfortable with sharing.\n\nRead more …\n\nTheology of the Body\n\nThe Theology of the Body is a series of teachings by St. John Paul II that explore human identity, the role of our bodies, and the purpose of our sexuality. Delivered from 1979 to 1984 over 129 papal audiences, these talks delve into biblical representations of the human body and marriage, offering a detailed theological framework that addresses questions about human dignity, sexuality, and relationships.\n\nRead more …\n\nThe Loss of the Dignity of Sex\n\nSex is difficult to speak about, and that makes sense. Not because sex is something to be ashamed of but because sex has lost its dignity. A loss of dignity occurs when something with inherent value is perceived or treated as having little or no value and is treated as such. This is what has happened to sex in our culture.\n\nRead more …\n\nThe Messiness of Divorce\n\nIn all my years of ministry, teaching junior high, high school, college, and adult formation, it has been my experience that the Catholic teaching on divorce is one of the most misunderstood teachings. Both in the practical teaching of the subject and the pastoral care, divorce quite simply, is messy.\n\nRead more …\n\nMarriage: A Reflection of Christ’s Love and Faithfulness\n\nEphesians 5:21-31, There is infinite beauty in these words from Ephesians! We loved this reading and its message so much that my husband and I chose it for one of our readings at our wedding. In our modern times, however, the message has been misconstrued to be something different. In Roman times, women were seen as property.\n\nRead more …\n\nJourney to a Life of Faith\n\nEaster stands as the pinnacle of the liturgical calendar, celebrating the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. This sacred season calls us to plunge into the vastness of God's mercy, it is interwoven within our worship, sacramental rites, and particularly evident in the transformative journey undertaken by the Elect through the Order of Christian Initiation of Adults (OCIA).\n\nRead more …\n\nBe His Light\n\nAt Baptism we received a candle, lit from the Paschal Candle, with the words, “Receive the Light of Christ”. The rite continues: “This child of yours has been enlightened by Christ. He is to walk always as a child of the light. May he keep the flame of faith alive in his heart. When the Lord comes, may he go out to meet him with all the saints in the heavenly kingdom.”\n\nRead more …\n\nFighting Against Lukewarm Faith\n\nWe have often heard this passage from revelation and the warning that comes from having a lukewarm faith; let us take this moment as we near the end of Lent to reflect on what that means and how we must apply it to our lives as Christians. To be lukewarm is to be neither cold nor hot, and we often experience this in many aspects of our lives; it is the mundane, the banal, the ordinary, the routine. In our Christian life, we can experience this as well.\n\nRead more …\n\nDying to Self\n\nSt. Paul's teachings and his life vividly exemplify a boundless truth: to the extent that Jesus' life within me mirrors the very essence of Christ Himself, I must willingly surrender and let those aspects \"of me\" that fall short of Christ's perfection fade away. In short, I must die to myself.\n\nRead more …\n\nReturn to the Father Through Confession\n\nThe Prodigal Son had lived a life safe, protected, loved. He had an inheritance to come, but the patient endurance to reach that inheritance was lacking. Because of pride and greed, he thought he could do better than the life his father had given him.\n\nRead more …\n\nAlmsgiving: An Important Pillar of Lent\n\nI remember as a teenager walking the streets of Washington, D.C., for the March for Life. We were there to support a child's right to life. We were walking with Fr. Ben Shockey. It was my first encounter with him. I am pretty sure we were enjoying an ice cream cone while walking. On the sidewalk was a homeless man asking for money.\n\nRead more …\n\n40 Days Closer to Christ\n\nLent is not just a period established for personal improvement, intended for one to temporarily give up a vice or lose a few pounds, nor is it necessarily about becoming a better individual Christian, although that should happen. Lent, instead, is a period of intense spiritual preparation. This is a Catholic's 40 days on Mount Sinai (see Ex 24:12, 34:28, and Dt 9:9).\n\nRead more …\n\nGod Calls Us All to Freedom of Chastity\n\nDue to various historical factors, some attitudes have given rise to idea that \"chastity\" is a burden, a prohibition of freedoms, or a tether of suppression. This, however, is the furthest definition from God's true intentions for chastity. What is it and why is God's true intention not suppression, but rather FREEDOM?\n\nRead more …\n\nThe Virtues\n\nIn our fallen world, it is evident that our intellectual faculties often become subservient to our fleeting emotional states. This struggle manifests in various ways: anger leading to regrettable words, lustful desires culminating in sinful actions, or fear hindering our response to the Holy Spirit's guidance.\n\nRead more …\n\nThe Principle of Double Effect\n\nLife doesn't always follow an easy script. In fact, quite often, there are decisions in life when it becomes both necessary and prudent to seek out knowledgeable advice from those who are familiar with the church's teaching on moral issues. One of the most interesting of these moral philosophies is the \"principle of double effect\".\n\nRead more …\n\nDeveloping Warrior Mindset for Spiritual Combat\n\nAn aspect of Christianity that does not get spoken of enough is that Christians are at war.
