        "text": "Welcome to Holy Rosary Chapel in Cascade, Colorado, off of Ute Pass (U.S. Route 24), midway between Old Colorado City and Woodland Park. We are located at the turnoff to Pikes Peak Highway and Santa’s Workshop at the North Pole.\n\nThe chapel of the Holy Rosary was built by the Cusack family and donated to the Catholic Diocese as a memorial to Thomas and Mary Green Cusack. Archbishop Urban J. Vehr of Denver blessed the chapel on July 31, 1931 and presided over the first High Mass celebrated at the chapel on the day of dedication.\n\nBuilt in pure Romanesque design, the chapel was constructed on a hilltop at an elevation of 7,391 feet. The outer walls are native lichen-covered red rock, brought down from Pyramid Mountain, which can be seen rising in front of the Rampart Range, about two miles across the valley, north of the Chapel.\n\nThe interior of this devotional chapel is breathtaking in its sheer simplicity ~ contrasted by its exceptional works of art – dominated by an almost life-size carved wood crucifix of Christ the King. This crucifix of rosewood is an original sculpture from the studio of Anton Lang of the family known for fine wood carvings, and as the players in the Passion Play of Oberammergau, Germany.\n\nThis altar of white Carrera marble is enhanced by the hand-carved replica of “The Last Supper” by Lualdi of Florence, Italy. Italian carved wood statuettes of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and Saint Joseph with the Christ Child, flank the sides of the sanctuary.\n\nThe large stained glass ‘rose’ or ‘wheel’ window recessed high in the front elevation of the chapel shows Saint Cecilia, patroness of music, in the center, surrounded by seven patron saints with Madonna at the top. The surrounding panes include St. Francis of Assisi, St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Joseph, St. Jane Frances de Chantal, St. Charles Borromeo, St. Anne, and St. Thomas, Apostle. This lovely window throws a soft light over the two-manual Kilgen pipe-organ installed on the small choir balcony. The organ was designed especially to fit the acoustical qualities of the chapel.\n\nA circular stairway can be used to access the choir loft or to visit the ‘grotto’ dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes\n\nIn 1996 the Colorado Historical Society included this property in the State Register of Historic Properties.\n\nThe chapel is visited by many summer guests who have been vacationing in the area since childhood. It is also a special place for couples who return to remember their wedding celebration, or the baptism of a child."
