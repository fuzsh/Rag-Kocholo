        "text": "In deciding to erect a school first, even before a temporary church, Father Power had followed what most of us readily recognize as a wise course. Pope after Pope has stressed the need for Catholic education, and reminded parents of their obligations in this respect. The Holy Fathers have asked that other buildings be delayed to achieve this useful and practical end.\n\nConstruction of our school commenced January 3, 1955. It was ready for classes in September. The first scholastic year found at least four and possibly five grades functioning, depending on the availability of Nuns. One class was added each year until the full total of eight were in session.\n\nOur school was staffed by the Dominican Nuns of San Rafael, one of the finest teaching orders in the country. At first, they resided at St. Rose Academy in San Francisco. Adding to their regular burdens of caring for our children was a daily round trip of 16 miles between their convent and the school.\n\nIf only out of a sense of common gratitude, the parish hastened the erection of a convent in Westlake to lighten their burden. Members of Our Lady of Mercy Parish should consider themselves most fortunate as a new unit, to be able to obtain the services of teaching sisters. Msgr. Power stated,\n\n​\n\n\"There are several parishes in Northern California, including long-established ones, which have schools standing idle because of a general shortage of vocations. The Dominican Nuns operate schools where the annual tuition rates are as high per pupil as the amount of the pledge which most of us will make in the forthcoming building fund drive. The school will cost $186,000 to construct and another $20,000 to furnish. It will include eight classrooms and will be expandable. Our architect, Vincent G. Paney, is taking advantage of the latest construction techniques in order to hold our costs to a minimum. The school will be modern, comfortable and adequate, without unnecessary frills.\"\n\nAnyone having further information about these years of the parish life please contact us with your information.\n\nThe Parish from Fr. Power to the present\n\nFr. Paul E. Duggan - 1981 to 1982\n\nThis was a time of transition. Father Duggan stayed with the parish for only one year following the death of Msgr. Power.\n\nAnyone having further information about these years of the parish life please contact us with your information.\n\nFr. John Ryan - 1982 to 1995\n\nThis time in the parish saw continued growth and development of the parish school, the renovation of the church interior under the guidelines of Vatican Council II, the installation of the Rufatti Organ for Parish Worship as well as the beginning of a project of beautification which we now call the installation of the Faceted Glass Windows - Our Parish Art Gallery. Fr. Ryan had a sense of beauty and art which helped make our church something to be both admired as well as a place where a community could gather and pray together. The parish also saw development of fine tradition of education in the Parish School which attained the status of a Five Star School. The Parish Religious Education Program directed by The Holy family Sisters made a transition of leadership to Sister John Minetta who is presently its Leader.\n\nAnyone having further information about these years of the parish life please contact us with your information.\n\nFr. Manuel Curso, 1995 to July, 2000\n\n​\n\nFr. Curso came to Our Lady of Mercy from St. Anne Parish in San Francisco at the time Fr. Ryan became very ill. He helped Fr. Ryan and the Parish during this difficult period of change and transition. Since assuming the role of Pastor, he has undertaken to recap the history of our community, begin building a parish community that has ownership of its identity and is moving toward the Third Millenium with gusto. This tedious task takes much time and energy both in planning. listening and implementing. Various projects and boards have been begun in this process. The whole concept of W E S T Lake as the identity moniker and logo for our parish family comes from a vision of our Catholic Community that presumes involvement, ownership and a community vision that is dynamic.\n\nDuring the course of Fr. Curso's pastorate, he had invited the RVM Sisters to get involved in Our Lady of Mercy parish. Sr. Olive Kingsbury, RVM was sent by her Congregation. As Parish Sister she takes charge of Baptismal Preparation, Marriage Preparation, Coordinator of Renew 2000 and other parish programs. In August, 1997 Sr. Nicolina Estevez, RVM joined her and taught first grade for two years at OLM school. Then in May 1999, Sr. Margie Aguilar, RVM joined them and served as Assistant to the Director of Religious Education in the Parish. A year later, Sr. Margie was assigned as Director of Religious Education Program of the parish.\n\n​\n\nFr. William E. Brown, August 2000 to June 2010\n\n​\n\nPerhaps Fr. Brown will be best remembered for his wonderful homilies. From the time he started in OLM, he has continually captivated the OLM community with his sermons that he always started with a segment from his early youth which he then articulately transformed and masterfully blended into that day's gospel message. Everyone loved them because the poignant stories were down-to-earth and the message was always clearly delivered.\n\nHe was a great communicator, oral and written, and his daily emails to parishioners and staff were always delightful to read. He was kind, sensitive, understanding and intelligent (you could talk to him about anything) . He was very open and welcomed conversation. He was always there when you needed him. He had a daily open appointment calendar for anyone who wished to speak with him. And he never missed an appointment.\n\nHe was a caring Pastor and was very generous in showering everyone with God's blessings. He often said phrases like, \"God bless Nino\", \"God loves Nena\" and \"Thank God for Sister Fe\". He treasured the people near to him and always referred to his staff as \"gold\".\n\nHe never failed to recognize the good work that the sisters did at the church and never failed to thank everyone who helped in the preparation and celebration of the mass - the choir, the lectors, the altar servers, the eucharistic ministers and the ushers.\n\nThroughout the year, he scheduled dinners at the rectory with the various ministry groups and yearly, there was always the annual dinner for volunteers held at the church hall.\n\nBeing a convert himself, Fr.Brown strongly supported the RCIA program, which helps candidates to learn the catholic teachings and prepare throughout the year and culminates in their acceptance into the Catholic community on Easter.\n\nHe also encouraged youth ministry, grief support ministry and other ministries, and he welcomed the introduction of the Simbang Gabi masses before Christmas.\n\nFr. Brown did not want OLM to be left behind by the advancement of Internet and technology, so he introduced the concept of online giving through electronic contribution to OLM. He always made sure that our webpage was updated to reflect interesting links to news, retreats, articles relating to being Catholic in the Internet Age.\n\nFather Bill was supportive and committed to Catholic Education and in particular Our Lady of Mercy School.\n\n​\n\nDuring the pastorship of Fr. Brown, OLM was able to achieve and enjoy all these accomplishments:\n\nprinted two parish directories\n\nbought new church furniture\n\nestablished all-day Friday Eucharistic Adoration\n\nstarted our first Parish Council\n\ncompleted the meditation garden\n\n​\n\nmade all these renovations:\n\nremodeled the church hall and kitchen;\n\nreplaced the roofs and windows in the Rectory, Church, and Parish Center;\n\nremodeled sacristy and bathrooms in the church and refurbished the confessionals with face-to-face option;\n\nresurfaced the school yards and Parish parking lot; remodeled the guest room and kitchen in the Parish Center;\n\nand remodeled the apartment under the Kindergarten for new school principal.\n\nIn gratitude and in fairness to Fr. Brown's expertise in languages, OLM is honored to say, \"Father Brown, Thank you! Danke! Merci! Cảm ơn ông! Grazie, Arigato! Go raibh maith agat! Gracias! Mahalo! Salamat po!\"\n\nFr. Doming Orimaco, July 2010 to present\n\nParish Staff Boards and Committees\n\nSee Staff Page.\n\nContinuing Church Beautification\n\nSee Art galleries. Community Formation and Ownership\n\nSee Parish Mission and Vision.\n\n​\n\nThe Parish Is Yours Today and Tomorrow\n\nAt its beginning Fr. Power said, \"Our parish was established for the convenience of all of us. In the truest sense of the word, we are all Christian pioneers. Every successful parish is built upon the united sacrifice of its members.\n\nIn years to come you will be able to gaze upon your parish plant with pride and admiration, and you will be able to share its everlasting glory.\"\n\nWe have the challenge through our exercise of membership, ownership and participation to carry on this fine tradition that is \"SECOND TO NONE\" in our day and for our future. We are Our Lady of Mercy W E S T LAKE and we must continue to work for the formation, growth, financing and development of this community VISION."
