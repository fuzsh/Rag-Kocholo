        "text": "As we celebrate our 78th year as a parish, we have much to be thankful for. This video gives a small visual glimpse of our church family, but it cannot tell the entire story of all the many brothers and sisters who have blessed us and the countless blessings God has bestowed upon us over the years.\n\nMother of Christ Church located in the Winton Hills community of Cincinnati, Ohio is an African American Catholic parish. In the spirit of faith, service and community, we seek to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus through the word and Sacraments. We celebrate our Roman Catholic heritage in worship that flows from African American Culture and music.\n\nWe foster the education of children, evangelization and service to our neighbors, and ecumenism with surrounding faith Communities. We seek to share generously; our time, talents and resources on behalf of God’s Kingdom.\n\nTaken from The Catholic Telegraph\n\nFebruary 5, 1965\n\nMother of Christ Mission in Findlater Gardens, Cincinnati, will officially open its new church hall and recreational center, above, on Sunday, February 7.\n\nFather Charles H. McGurn of St. Bernard Parish, Winton Place, who has charge of the mission, will bless the building and offer Mass at 4 p.m. The building, located on a three and on-half-acre site at 5301 Winneste Avenue will seat about 300 in the church hall for church services. Moveable partitions will permit the hall to be divided into three separate rooms for catechetical classes, held there for grade school and high students who attend public schools. Other facilities of the building include a wing containing a meeting room, kitchen, utility rooms, an office, and a priest’s room.\n\nFor the past 20 years, the mission used a community building in Winton Terrace for Masses and instructions. The new building, which was erected by the archdiocese, will permit the transfer of all the mission’s activities to the new center.\n\nEugene Schrand of Cincinnati was the architect; Allan and Beischel of Cincinnati the general contract"
