        "text": "Dear Parishioners of St. Mary's, and all People of Prayer,\n\nWe have begun asking the intercession of Mary under her local title, \"Our Lady of the Rivers,\" as of Easter Sunday 2020.\n\nToday, April 13, 2020, the St. Mary's OMV Community visited and prayed at the Shrine of Our Lady of the Rivers, and asked her to intercede on behalf of our Parish, all the local parishes, the Riverbend, Portage des Sioux and the entire world.\n\nWe promised we would lead a pilgrimage there in thanksgiving for her intercession on our behalf. Please join us in praying a Rosary each day for this intention. Please spread the word and invite others, no matter who they are, or where they are to join us in this prayer.\n\nGod bless you all.\n\nOur Lady of the Rivers, Pray for us.\n\nFr. Jeremy, Fr. Dave, Fr. Ben, Fr. Paul, Br. Leland and Dcn. JIm\n\nThe power of prayer\n\nIn 1951, the people of Portage des Sioux prayed to be delivered from the rising flood waters of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. Their prayers were answered! In fact, the place got its name from the place where the Sioux tribesmen carried (portaged) their canoes over land to escape the grasp of their enemy Missouri warriors. This is a place of deliverance, and it is a place that Mary has proven the power of her intercession!\n\nJoin together with all believers in the Riverbend area in asking for the protection and deliverance that Our Lady of the Rivers can obtain for us again, as we face the threat of the coronavirus here.\n\nEvery day, as we pray the Rosary, let us offer this prayer to Our Lady of the Rivers. When the danger has passed, we will go together to visit her riverside shrine in a pilgrimage of thanksgiving.\n\nOur prayer\n\nOur Lady of the Rivers,\n\nwhen the rising waters threatened to overwhelm us,\n\nyou came to our rescue,\n\njust as so many years before,\n\nthe Sioux escaped certain death\n\nwhere you now stand.\n\nHear us, your sons and daughters,\n\nwho again cry out in our need.\n\nAs the threat of contagion rises like a flood,\n\nsteer us by the light of your crown and Rosary\n\ninto the Great River of Christâ€™s Peace and Life,\n\nto the safe harbor of His Sacred Heart,\n\nthrough whom we beg this deliverance.\n\nWho lives and reigns with the Father,\n\nin the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n\none God forever and ever.\n\nAmen.\n\nHow to Pray the Rosary\n\nRead background and full instructions from Dynamic Catholic here.\n\nIf you cannot join our live rosary (at 3pm until April 20, and at 5:30pm after that), pray along with a straight-forward video of the Rosary from Catholic Crusade."
