Appeal for Catholic Ministries 2024

Thank You For Sharing In Our Need.

We give thanks to our God at our every remembrance of our generous stewards, our pastors, parish leaders and all those who partner with us in grace to carry out the work of Jesus through diocesan ministries and Catholic Charities of Southeast Texas. We pray always with joy in our hearts at our every thought of them. Remembering how they have helped us to spread the Good News. We are confident the One who began this good work in them will continue to complete it until the day of Christ Jesus.
