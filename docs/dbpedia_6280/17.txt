I recently had the opportunity to see Lithium at a local film festival. This film was not only the best film I saw at the festival, but one of the best films that I've seen in a long time.

The story takes place in Stockholm, Sweeden and revolves around a young girl who is working as an assistant journalist for a small paper. The girl soon becomes obsessed with a local story about a series of unsolved murders that have taken place, and becomes determined to find the killer on her own.

The director's unique, "hand held" style of filming combined with a very effective use of music and sound and a great story, make this a fascinating film.

If you like a good thriller that will keep you glued to the edge of your seat until the very end, this is a must see film!
