Check out other interesting highlights in the newsletter too.\n\nOften motivated by their outstanding piezoelectric, ferroelectric and electro-optical properties, lithium niobate (LiNbO3, LN) thin films are widely studied and explored for their potential applications in acoustic and photonic devices. For example, LN thin films with high electromechanical coupling coefficients could offer performance improvements in acoustic resonators for radio frequency filters — crucial for high speed and low latency wireless communication. LN thin films have also risen to the forefront of chip-scale nonlinear optics research, while inspiring a wealth of opportunities for the development of novel signal processing devices, quantum interconnects, power-efficient light amplification/generation and so on.\n\nWith the above perspectives, we are excited to announce a recent review in the World Scientific Annual Review of Functional Materials (WSARFM), focusing on the developments, challenges and key learning points in the fabrication and direct growth methods of high quality LN thin films.
