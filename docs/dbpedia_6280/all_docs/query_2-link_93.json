        "text": "It is about these battery types\n\nIn Gothenburg, NMC batteries will be manufactured, but there are other types of batteries for cars and other applications. We are mostly talking about lithium-ion batteries, but there are several technologies with different cathode materials.\n\nNMC batteries - are what people talk about the most. They have the highest energy content and contain cobalt (NMC). In today's batteries, however, the cobalt content has been reduced considerably. It is this battery technology that is mainly used in the electric cars sold in Europe.\n\nLFP â€“ lithium-based batteries that do not contain cobalt, which is an advantage as it is a critical mineral that today is mostly imported from countries outside Europe. The disadvantage of LFP batteries is that they have a slightly lower energy content than NMC.\n\nGlobally, these two battery technologies have equal market shares today.\n\nSolid state batteries - is also a lithium battery where the separator in the battery has been replaced with a solid material instead of a liquid one. There are many who are pinning their hopes on these, but it is by no means a given that solid state technology will be a big winner. Here, the market is perhaps mostly aimed at drones, where one is more insensitive to high prices and instead seeks the absolute highest performance.\n\nEveryone is aiming for batteries that are cheap to manufacture and that are made from cheaper materials. In that context, sodium-ion batteries are an interesting technology that many are looking at. Perhaps mainly for stationary batteries, but also for vehicles in the future, when cost is more important than long range.\n\nThese different technologies will probably live side by side for a very long time. If you look at the most well-known, the lead battery, it is almost 150 years old, and the production rate has never been as high as it is now.\n\nTogether, they will handle the increase in volume that is happening globally with the electrification of more and more vehicles, machines and applications."
