He is best known for his tenure as the bassist and vocalist for the seminal Finnish doom metal band Reverend Bizarre. He is also notable for his vocal tenure in the Finnish doom pioneers Spiritus Mortis and a wide range of musical projects such as his solo project Opium Warlords, exploring a wide arrangement of genres and sounds.\n\nSince starting his career in 1991, Sami Hynninen has been involved with numerous bands in the Finnish scene, along with contributing graphic design and artwork to numerous bands.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly Bands[]\n\nHynninen's earliest known band, along with Jari Pohjonen, would be KLV. KLV was an avant-garde rock/goth/doom/prog band from Lohja, Finland, was active between 1992-1998. KLV is short for \"Kehitysvammaisen Lapsen Vanhemmat\" (\"Parents of a disabled child\" in English). Around 2002, they were supposed to record an album for Firebox Records but a few years later the label decided not to release it after all and thus nothing was recorded. Some KLV songs later became Reverend Bizarre songs, like \"The Hour of Death\".\n\nOther early bands featuring Hynninen would be a short-lived band known as Punishment (Where he handled lead vocals), along with Soihtu and Lohja SS.\n\nReverend Bizarre (1995 - 2007)[]\n\nFor more details feel free to view the Riffipedia page on Reverend Bizarre.\n\nReverend Bizarre was started in 1995 by Albert Witchfinder (Sami Hynninen), Peter Vicar (Kami Kärki) and Juippi (Juha-Petteri Lundqvist). Though some practice sessions were recorded (Vicar owns the only copy) no real studio recordings were made with this lineup and Juippi left in 1997, replaced by Earl of Void (Jari Lars Johan Pohjonen).\n\nThe band's current lineup then recorded some practice sessions and self-released them under the title Slice of Doom in 1999. The band played their first live show at TVO in Turku, Finland on 18 August 1999.[1]\n\nEventually in 2002, the band released their debut album In the Rectory of the Bizarre Reverend, cited as an iconic album in doom metal. Following the album was a 2003 tour of Germany (their first shows outside of Finland.) with a limited CD-R entitled You Shall Suffer!. An EP followed entitled Harbinger of Metal followed that year, labeled as such despite being as lengthy as their albums.\n\nSlice of Doom 1999 - 2002 was released in 2004 via PsycheDOOMelic, detailing all recordings from the Slice of Doom sessions and compilation tracks. In 2005, Reverend Bizarre released their second album II: Crush the Insects on Spikefarm. A short tour of Sweden happened in April that year and their only tour of the United States happened in July 2005, supported by The Gates of Slumber. Their first US performance was in Indianapolis, Indiana at Templars of Doom.\n\nReverend Bizarre announced their breakup was imminent sometime in 2006, recording what would be their final album and a plethora of songs for split releases that year. Along with a string of shows in Europe, they played a handful of shows in Finland leading up to their final performance. Reverend Bizarre's final concert was on 30 December 2006. It was at TVO in Turku, the same venue where their first show was held. The show had two sets including In the Rectory of the Bizarre Reverend in its entirety and founding member Juippi as a guest. [2]\n\n\"Teutonic Witch\" was released in May 2007 and peaked at #1 on the Finnish Radio Singles charts. Reverend Bizarre's third and final album III: So Long Suckers, was released on 8 August 2007. A sticker was included on the jewelcase with the statement \"DOOM METAL IS DEAD\". A plethora of posthumous split releases and EPs were released throughout the rest of 2007 and 2008. All of these recordings (Along with other split and rare tracks) were compiled in a 2CD set via Spikefarm entitled Death Is Glory... Now, released on 11 February 2009.\n\nSpiritus Mortis[]\n\nFor more details, feel free to view the Riffipedia page on Spiritus Mortis.\n\nOn 23 September 2008 it would be announced that Spiritus Mortis had signed to a new label in Firebox Records and that a third album was finished by October 2008.[3] On 22 January 2009 it would be revealed that the new lead singer for Spiritus Mortis would be former Reverend Bizarre frontman/bassist Sami Hynninen, who contributed his vocals to the new album.[4] Hynninen's first gig with Spiritus Mortis would be on 21 February 2009 at Lekkeri Winterfest NS in Tuuri, performing almost entirely new songs.[5]\n\nMore details would be revealed leading up to the official release, such as a promotional single,[6] a full stream of the new album[7] and the artwork[8] leading up to the release of the band's third studio album The God Behind The God on 13 May 2009. Featuring eight brand new songs, The God Behind The God would attain positive reception from the likes of MetalRage,[9] Disagreement[10] and a host of other critics.[11] Spiritus Mortis would have their most extensive year on the road in support of The God Behind The God, participating in a full tour of Europe and appearing at a host of festivals such as Dooomstock, Hammer of Doom Festival, Jalometalli, Dutch Doom Days and Metal Warning Festival. Following two more gigs in 2010 the band would go on a hiatus. A 7\" split with Pale Divine would be released the next year, both bands contributing Deep Purple covers. Both of the band's first two albums would also get reissued via High Roller Records and Svart Records in 2012.\n\nOn 26 September 2016 it would be announced that Spiritus Mortis had now signed with Svart Records, along with details and a release date for their fourth album.[12] On 6 October the band would premiere a new song in \"Babalon Working\" to promote this new album[13] followed by a full stream in November.[14] The Year Is One would be released on 11 November 2016 to positive reviews. The band's first show since 2010 would be at Nosturi supporting Pentagram and Satan. Spiritus Mortis would follow up with a host of shows in 2017 with a handful of shows and an appearance at Blowup Festival for their third edition. Hynninen would leave the band by the end of 2017.\n\nOpium Warlords[]\n\nOpium Warlords was founded in 2004, with Hynninen stating of the project: \"The concept of Opium Warlords first came to my mind somewhere around 2004, but back then it was a bit different from what Opium Warlords came to be. It was more “floating” sound wise. This was because at those same times I had The Puritan in my mind, as well, and it was very heavy music. Then when The Puritan came to an end, all of that material – which in the first place had already gone through some other projects – became Opium Warlords’ material. The final form of Opium Warlords included almost everything I have ever thought about musically.\".[15]\n\nInitially, Hynninen was the sole performer. The project's first release would be Live at Colonia Dignidad, released circa 25 November 2009 via Cobra Records. The album's name derives from the location of a secluded cult in Chile, South America.[16] The next year, Hynninen would recruit two new members in Laura Länsimäki and Erkki Virta to further flesh out future recordings.\n\nSigning with Svart Records, The project's first album as a trio would be We Meditate Under the Pussy in the Sky, released on 30 November 2012. The band's third album was intended to be their second, but due to delays from Cobra Records, would be finished in 2013 and 2014. Taste My Sword of Understanding would come on 30 May 2014.\n\nOn 3 November 2017, Opium Warlords would release Droner, comprising entirely of three lengthy songs spanning nearly twenty minutes each and the second Opium Warlords album to feature Hynninen as the sole performer. A fifth album in Nembutal would come on 4 December 2020, featuring the duo of Hynninen and Virta.[17]\n\nTähtiportti[]\n\nTähtiportti would be an electronic art collective founded in 2013 by Hynninen, a along with a veritable who's who of the Finnish leftfield music scene in Ilari Larjosto (Jesse, Googolplex, etc.), Mikko Viljakainen (Larry And The Lefthanded, Legopel, Op:l Bastards, The Barefoot Brothers, etc.) and Perttu Eino Häkkinen (Harmönia, Boyz Of Caligula, Cae$ar, etc.). Hynninen would handle the lyrics and vocals in his native Finnish language while the remaining members handled the instrumentation.[18] Not long after forming the quartet would release two 7\" Singles via Iron Magnesium Records and perform regularly at various festivals.[19][20]\n\nSigning the project to Svart Records, Tähtiportti would release three albums in three years (Tähtiportti on 27 February 2015,[21] Eetterimessu on 1 April 2016[22] and Superdepressio on 21 April 2017.[23]) along with occasionally performing live.\n\nPerttu Häkkinen died on 12 August 2018, turning the band into a trio. He would contribute drum machines and synthesizer to a fourth record, with Abiristeily released on 10 May 2019 and dedicated to his memory.[24]\n\nFriends of Hell[]\n\nOn 18 November 2021 Rise Above Records would announce a new signing in Friends of Hell, a collaborative doom metal project featuring Danazoglou, along with Hynninen on vocals. Their eponymous debut album is set for release on 18 March 2022.[25] Albert would quit the band in 2023 citing \"personal reasons\".[26]\n\nOther Endeavors[]\n\nHynninen was notably involved with a Finnish dark progressive rock band known as Orne. Formed in 1997 under the moniker Mesmer, changed to Orne in 2001. Has gone through several line-up changes during the years; only the guitarists Kimi Kärki and Pekka Pitkälä and the drummer Jara Pohjonen remain in the band as original members. The project would release two albums since their formation.\n\nHynninen had notably been with several one-time projects, such as The Candles Burning Blue (A gothic rock project),[27] Vironsusi (A black metal project that composed one song in 2005),[28] Armanenschaft (A raw black metal project),[29] and March 15 (An industrial/noise project).[30] He also has a black metal project in Azrael Rising (Under the name \"Ancient Fisherman\") alongside Vitutor.[31]\n\nThe Puritan was a short-lived project based out of Finland, featuring Hyninnen along with members of Sinisthra. Unlike the traditional doom of Reverend Bizarre, The Puritan leans more into avant-garde and experimental territories, leaning into drone doom. The Puritan would release two 12\" EPs via I Hate in their tenure (The Puritan which was released 30 November 2006 and The Black Law which was released on 14 February 2008). Both EPs would be released on CD as Lithium Gates via Spikefarm Records on 19 November 2008. The project would be disbanded that same year.\n\nCollaborating with Harri Kuokkanen (Horse Latitudes, Hooded Menace, etc.), Hynninen would start the band Pussies in 2017, a project that leans into garage rock. The project would release a 12\" split with the Finnish garage rock band The Girlfriends in 2019. Hynninen was also notably involved with another garage rock band in babes in The Abyss, mainly as a live vocalist.\n\nHynninen is also known as a self-taught graphic designer and comic book artist. In 1998, the publishing house Sarjamafia released Hynninen's first comic album, Magical Journey. He was awarded with his musical merit at the Somnium Scholarship in 2009.\n\nBands[]\n\nPunishment - Vocals (1991 - 1992)\n\nKLV - Bass, Vocals (1992 - 2002)\n\nReverend Bizarre - Guitar (1995 - 2007)\n\nThe Candles Burning Blue - Vocals (1997 - 1999, 2000 - 2005)\n\nMesmer - Vocals (1997 - 2001)\n\nOrne - Vocals (2001 - 2011)\n\nOpium Warlords - All Instruments, Vocals (2004 - Present)\n\nMarch 15 - Electronics, Vocals (2004)\n\nVironsusi - Drums, Vocals (2005)\n\nArmanenschaft - Vocals (2005 - 2008)\n\nAzrael Rising - Vocals (2005 - Present)\n\nThe Puritan - Bass, Vocals (2005 - 2008)\n\nSpiritus Mortis - Vocals (2008 - 2017)\n\nTähtiportti - Contributor (2012 - Present)\n\nLord Vicar - Live Bass (2015 - 2016)\n\nPussies - All Instruments, Vocals (2017 - Present)\n\nBabes in The Abyss - Live Vocals (2018 - 2020)\n\nLoinen - Bass (2018 - Present)\n\nFriends of Hell - Vocals (2021 - 2023)\n\nSelected Discography[]\n\nWith KLV[]\n\nAnalogical Picnic Tales (Compilation) (1993, Beyond The Sector)\n\nMaan Liha (Album) (1994, Beyond The Sector)\n\nPietr (Album) (1994, Self-Released)\n\nMinun Lentoni ‎(Album) (1996, Beyond The Sector)\n\nKatso Mihin Kätesi Pystyvät (Album) (1997, Self-Released)\n\nValkeus (Album) (1998, Self-Released; 2015, Svart Records)\n\nViikate / KLV (Split with Viikate) (1999, Syyslevyt, Kuoleman Kylmä Käsi)\n\nNun Musta On Maa (Compilation) (2008, Emissary)\n\nWith Reverend Bizarre[]\n\nIn the Rectory of the Bizarre Reverend (2002, Sinister Figure)\n\nHarbinger of Metal (EP) (2003, Spikefarm)\n\nSlice of Doom 1999 - 2002 (Compilation) (2004, PsycheDOOMelic Records)\n\nII: Crush the Insects (2005, Spikefarm)\n\nIII: So Long Suckers (2007, Spikefarm)\n\nDeath Is Glory...
