        "text": "AVD is applied in the form of a mist which is composed of fine droplets of water containing vermiculite platelets. When deposited on the surface of the burning fuel, the water suppresses the flames and cools the fuel source bringing the fire under control.\n\nLithium-ion battery fires burn at very high temperatures, often >1100°C. As the water cools and evaporates, the high aspect ratio vermiculite platelets overlap and bind together, producing a heat-resistant oxygen barrier between the fuel and the atmosphere is produced.\n\nAVD is a novel extinguishing agent which has been specifically developed to tackle the unique risks of Lithium-ion battery fires.\n\nA unique fire type requires a unique extinguishing agent and AVD has many excellent properties to bring Lithium-ion battery fires under control quickly limiting the potential damage and losses caused by the propagating fire.\n\nAVD acts to suppress the flames, extinguishing the fire, and forms a heat and oxygen barrier of vermiculite as the water evaporates.\n\nAVD is unique in its thermal resistance properties and can be applied as a fire break to prevent propagation of the fire to surrounding materials and property.\n\nAVD Fire has conducted hundreds of Battery fire tests to develop AVD and offers a wide range of certified fire-fighting products including;\n\nPortable fire extinguishers\n\nLarge-volume trolley units\n\nFire suppression kits,\n\nFire resistant containers\n\nFire blankets.\n\nFurthermore, the versatile AVD extinguishing agent can be delivered using standard fire-fighting equipment and can be used in fixed systems designed for the risk at hand.\n\nAVD Fire provides the best, most versatile solution to battery fires across a wide range of applications.\n\nTake a look at our lithium battery fire extinguishers and product bundles to find out more about the protection that AVD Fire can offer."
