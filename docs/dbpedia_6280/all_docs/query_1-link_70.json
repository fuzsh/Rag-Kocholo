        "text": "A report from tests made public by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) shows that a cutting extinguisher can safely put out a battery fire in a very short time, with minimal use of water and without the risk of re-ignition.\n\nThe report is based on the results on a number of tests carried out in a collaborative project involving several stakeholders, including the CTIF Commission for Extrication and New Technology, and CTIF Sweden, where Tore Eriksson, Tom van Esbroeck & Michel Gentilleau have been part of the reference group. CTIF ´s Yvonne Näsman and Per-Ola Malmquist have been project members on behalf of MSB.se.\n\nThe tests were designed to examine whether injecting water into a Li-ion battery that had gone into a state of thermal runaway could effectively suppress and extinguish the fire without reignition.\n\nSeveral different kinds of equipment was tested, including fog nails, pick axes, traditional nozzles and various penetrating extinguishers (which use water mist to cut holes through the protective shell of the battery).\n\nPlease note, that for safety reasons, the use of fog nails or pickaxes (to break the battery shell before water was applied) are not recommended in the report.\n\nDon´t miss any ctif news - follow link to sign up for our CTIF Newsletter\n\nSeveral tools and methods tested\n\nAs a stakeholder in the project, our CTIF Associate Member Cobra Cold Cut Systems provided their Cobra Ultra High pressure lance.\n\nAlso tested was the Murer extinguishing lance. Both tools extinguish fires from a safe distance through the use of a water mist which can penetrate walls and other hard surfaces.\n\nIn the case of the full scale, the Cobra Cutting Extinguisher was used to penetrate the protective shell of the EV lithium battery, with minimum introduction of oxygen to the cell.\n\nAvoid jet flames and other risks by using the appropriate penetration tools\n\nSeveral methods and tools were tested, and the high pressure extinguishing tools produced the best results. They also provided the safest methods for the operator, with the lowest risk of re-ignition or dangerous jet flames.\n\nThe reason for the more successful extinguishing with the cutting extinguishers, as opposed to other methods, is that those tools use high pressure water (sometimes mixed with an abrasive) to cut through the battery shell, minimizing the introduction of oxygen to the cell.\n\nThe extinguishing media used were:\n\nCobra Ultra High Pressure Lance (UHPL) firefighting equipment – this equipment uses abrasive entrained in water to pierce and then water mist to suppress/extinguish. This is all applied using one continuous action. This uses water at 58 l/min.\n\nInsulated Penetrating Lance equipment – this uses a low-pressure water supply to apply water but without using any abrasive, this uses water at 25 l/min.\n\nWater injection using an axe and a pipe connected to a water supply. This uses the axe to make the hole in the battery and then the pipe to inject the water into the battery. This uses water at 75 l/min.\n\nFog nails and pickaxes not recommended for safety reasons\n\nOther methods tested, like the use of fog nails or pickaxes to break the battery shell before water was applied, are not recommended in the report.\n\nThe reason fog nail and pickaxes were deemed inappropriate is that those methods showed an increased tendency for dangerous jet flames to shoot out of the battery, and it also exposed the firefighter to a greater risk of electrocution from the remaining current in the battery.\n\nThe report from MSB underlines that operators wishing to try this do so only after a thorough risk assessment, and only after receiving the appropriate training in the use of tools approved for the purpose by the manufacturer. The report also stresses the importance of only using tools and methods approved by the employer.\n\nSuccessful extinguishing of an EV battery in 4 minutes - with only 63 gallons if water\n\nSeveral standalone battery modules and also a full scale EV were tested by bringing the batteries into a state of thermal runaway, resulting in battery fire. Water was introduced after 15 minutes from the first signs of propagation, to simulate a typical fire service response time.\n\nIn the full scale fire test, the total duration of the extinguishing effort, from the time water was first applied on the vehicle fire, to the time the lithium.Ion battery was determined to be inert, was only ten minutes for extinguishing the entire vehicle fire. The total time for extinguishing the battery alone was 4 minutes.\n\nThe water consumption for extinguishing the lithium-Ion battery was calculated to be only 240 liters / 63 gallons.\n\nIncluding the time to extinguish the entire vehicle fire, a total of 750 liters / 200 gallons in total was used, in a combined effort with the Cobra cutting extinguisher and traditional fire extinguishing with water.\n\nThis can be compared with real life examples of some fire services using up thousands of gallons of water, requiring several tanker trucks, in dealing with a single EV fire.\n\nMany fire services have also witnessed on cases where several teams have been dispatched, spending hours trying to contain EV fires, with sometimes very mixed results.\n\nNo sign of reignition with minimal use of water\n\nAfter only ten minutes of being flooded with a relatively small amount of water, the batteries showed no sign of reignition. The voltage measurements of the battery modules also showed that in all the tests, that the affected battery cells and the neighbouring cells were cooled and showed a drop in voltage. Other battery cells maintained either a full charge or residual charge.\n\nSome of the battery cells where the Cobra Cutting Extinguisher had been applied showed no residual voltage at all.\n\nThe most important observation is that in all cases the affected battery cells, and neighbouring cells, were cooled by the introduction of water and showed a drop in voltage. This also stopped the propagation of fire in the battery and stopped the fire from spreading further.\n\nread a summary of the report on cold cut systems home page\n\nBelow is a 28 minute educational video demonstrating how the tests were made.\n\nMethodology\n\nA review of existing research literature on Li-ion battery fires was carried out to ensure that all the known risks were fully understood as well as the mechanism of spread of fire within Li-ion batteries.\n\nOne of the overall findings from this research was that the most effective suppression of a thermally propagating Li-ion battery is achieved when coolant can be applied as close as possible to the core of the heat source within the battery.\n\nFresh water is the most readily available medium for first responders and was therefore the chosen agent for these tests. One objective of the tests was to see if safe tactics could be developed for first responders to use in applying water to cool the interior of a Li-ion battery in thermal runaway.\n\nAll the tests were carried out using Li-ion batteries with 100% state of charge. Thermal runaway was initiated using a heating plate that was installed pre-test. The battery units were also modified to overcome some safety systems; the modifications had no impact on the cooling effect of the water.\n\nIn tests ii) and iii), once thermal runaway had been initiated in one cell of the battery, there was a delay of 15 minutes before extinguishing media was applied. This was to simulate the time taken to call the emergency responders and for them to arrive at the scene. The tests were terminated when visual inspection indicated no continuing thermal propagation and the temperatures recorded on the Thermal Imaging equipment were below 50°C.\n\nThe three tests, in sequence, were:\n\ni). Three stand-alone subpacks – four battery modules at 24 Volts, 6.54 kWh\n\nii) One stand-alone traction battery at 14.8 Volts, 2.8 kWh\n\niii) One full size electric vehicle with traction battery – 27 modules at 14.8 Volts, 2.8 kWh\n\nThe tests were carried out on four different types of setups:\n\n• sub-battery\n\n• stand-alone electric car battery\n\n• complete electric vehicle\n\n• battery module.\n\nThe tests were carried out over two days in April 2022 on a practice field at Södra Älvsborg's emergency services association. This is an advanced practice field with many years of experience testing cold cutting tools for various applications.\n\nA total of eight trials were carried out, distributed over four different tests. The tests were preceded by a risk analysis where all tools were evaluated based on specific conditions. The risk analysis also took into account the design of the test objects.\n\nThe risk analysis showed that there could be difficulties with access to the battery and electrical safety if only the existing standard equipment on modern fire engines is used. Therefore, it was decided to include two commercial tools in the demonstration, the cutting extinguisher and the extinguishing lance.\n\nThe following conclusion regarding other methods is translated directly from the Swedish source document:\n\n\"When we made holes while adding water, no new jet flames appeared. However, when we made holes without adding water, jet flames appeared. Two extinguishing attempts were carried out with self-constructed tools assembled from equipment assumed to be on a modern standard fire engine: jet pipe and narrow hose and pickaxe, which was used for punching holes. Although it worked in the demonstration, this type of approach is not recommended because the technology is difficult to implement in a real vehicle fire where access to the battery is limited and would require working inside a burning vehicle.\"\n\n\"The risks associated with handling a burnt battery with a significant amount of residual energy must always be weighed against the benefits of shortening the response time. Note that also lithium-ion batteries which have been allowed to burn out may contain residual voltage and should always be treated with this in mind until it is confirmed that the battery is electrically dead. During the demonstration, both a thermal camera and a thermocouple were used. It is important to note that the thermal imager is sensitive to reflection, so it can be difficult to get a completely truthful picture of the heat spread inside the battery. In the event of a fire in an electric vehicle and its battery, it is of the utmost importance that the response personnel take note of the vehicle manufacturer's safety and response information in the vehicle's rescue card (Rescue Sheet) and rescue instructions (Emergency Response Guide, ERG) in order to be able to make response planning based on the specific conditions in the current case.\"\n\nSummary of the tests:\n\nThis is only a summary of the tests, however the full report can be accessed (in Swedish) through MSB.se.\n\nAn English summary of the test can be read on the Cobra Cold Cut System home page\n\nResults and methodology:\n\nThe tests were very successful and demonstrated, among other findings, that:\n\nIt is possible to interrupt thermal propagation in a Li-ion battery through an active extinguishing operation where the battery is flooded with water.\n\nExtinguishing operations where the Li-ion battery is flooded with water can shorten the operation time and reduce personnel and material resource requirements.\n\nTest Results\n\nIn the first two tests, all three methods for injecting water into the battery itself worked to the extent that they were able to reduce the heat in the affected battery cells and extinguish the fire. The batteries did not reignite after being extinguished in any of the tests.\n\nHowever, use of an axe to make the water access hole in the battery casing caused an initial increase in intensity of the emerging jet flames from the battery until the pipe was connected and water was able to flood the battery cells. This method was also the least accurate in terms of targeting the water to those cells in thermal runaway or in thermal propagation.\n\nA key factor was the assumption that in the extreme case of battery modules not being harmed, their voltage would stay intact, while the other extreme case would be that a completely burned-out battery module would show no residual voltage. Thereby the remaining voltage of individual battery modules was considered an indication of the extent of damage caused by the thermal runaway propagation. In all the tests, the affected battery cells and the neighbouring cells were cooled and showed a drop in voltage. Other battery cells maintained either a full charge or residual charge.\n\nThe final full EV test involved a vehicle that was fully involved in fire (i.e. the vehicle cabin was fully involved and cells within the Li-ion battery were in thermal runaway. The vehicle cabin was extinguished using a conventional firefighting nozzle, then Thermal Imaging equipment was used to show the hottest spots within the battery. Cobra was then used to penetrate both the car bodywork and the battery casing and then apply water within the battery itself. The total period of fire suppression was 10 minutes from the first approach with Cobra to the conclusion of firefighting when all surface temperatures had fallen below 50°C. 15 minutes after extinguishment, the whole vehicle was twice lifted 1 metre using a forklift truck and then dropped to simulate rough handling – no reignition occurred. The car was then placed in a quarantine location for two days with no reignition.\n\nThe Cobra was used for around five minutes using 240 litres of water. The firefighting nozzle was used for four minutes using 510 litres of water giving a grand total of 750 litres. This is significantly less than the 1670 litres used in a test conducted by Exponent and The Fire Protection Research Foundation reported in 2013.\n\nThe use of Cobra permits the operator to act from a safer distance when establishing an ingress hole for water injection.\n\nAt the first sign of propagation, a countdown was started from 15 minutes to mimic the normal emergency service response time.\n\nThe extinguishing attempt was then started. To control the fire, water mist from the cutting extinguisher was used to knock down the flames and try to extinguish the cabin fire.\n\nWhen it was possible to open the rear door, thermal imaging was used to scan the interior of the vehicle and look for hot spots in the battery pack.\n\nIt was done by measuring thermal gradients in the cabin floor. Wind and control of gases using a PPV fan (Positive Pressure Ventilation) meant that one side of the vehicle was difficult to access due to thick smoke and flames.\n\nThe cutting extinguisher was used in the gimbal tunnel and lance extenders were used to facilitate access and avoid contact with the bodywork. During the time which the fire extinguisher was in operation, a conventional jet pipe was used as personal protection for the fire extinguisher operator.\n\nWhen the fire calmed down and the flames closest to the fire extinguisher operator were extinguished, the person with the protective beam (the beam operator) continued with the focus on extinguishing the compartment fire. Note that the x beam operator's primary duty throughout the operation was to protect the fire extinguisher operator from flash and flames. The test was terminated when the thermal imager showed a stable temperature below 50 °C.\n\nAfter the extinguishing effort was interrupted, continuous monitoring of the temperature with a thermal imaging camera continued for 15 minutes, to ensure that the propagation stopped. To simulate a removal of the vehicle, the vehicle was lifted about half a meter a couple of times with the help of a forklift, and dropped to the ground to see if it was possible to provoke a reaction that could lead to re-ignition.\n\nConclusions\n\nIt is possible to interrupt thermal propagation in a Li-ion battery through an active extinguishing operation where the battery is flooded with water.\n\nExtinguishing operations where the Li-ion battery is flooded with water can shorten the operation time and reduce personnel and material resource requirements.\n\nIt is difficult to determine the degree of propagation in a Li-ion battery during an ongoing fire based on external observable factors such as thermal imaging, temperature monitoring, smoke, and noise.\n\nCell chemistry, state of charge, battery architecture and vehicle architecture are system properties that affect how a thermal surge and propagation develops during a thermal event in an electric vehicle.\n\nWhen planning an intervention, it is important to first look at the vehicle’s Rescue Sheet and Emergency Response Guide (ERG) to assess the conditions for an active extinguishing operation.\n\nConducted trials show that it is possible to access the battery with the tools tested. Thermal Imaging Cameras and Rescue Sheets can provide information that provides better likelihood of success in an operation.\n\nThe risk of residual electrical and chemical energy, which can lead to re-ignition must always be considered when handling an electric vehicle and its traction battery after a thermal event.\n\nBackground:\n\nA preliminary study was carried out by Cold Cut Systems in Kungsbacka in 2021, where the Swedish Agency for Community Safety and Preparedness (MSB) participated as a reference. The purpose was to investigate whether it was possible to interrupt the thermal process in a propagating lithium ion battery by establishing an internal water flow in the battery pack.\n\nCold Cut Systems used a cutting extinguisher (Standard Cobra lance) in the pilot study with good results. It was determined there was enough evidence to motivate further studies and tests to develop guidelines for offensive extinguishing efforts of lithium-ion battery fires.\n\nThis demonstration is an activity within the scope of this work.\n\nThe overall aim of the demonstration was to contribute with experimental experience of the methodology of flooding lithium-ion batteries with water in the event of a fire and to show that it can contribute to a faster and more efficient extinguishing, provided that it is possible to access the battery in a safe way.\n\nThe goal of the extinguishing efforts was to stop the thermal propagation in the lithium-ion battery.\n\nThe demonstration was limited to test objects composed of lithium-ion cells with a maximum nickel content of 60 percent in the cathode material. More nickel-rich and energy-dense electrode systems have higher reactivity and must be investigated separately.\n\nBoth prismatic cells and pouch cells are represented in the sample objects. Cylindrical cells have not been studied in this demonstration."
