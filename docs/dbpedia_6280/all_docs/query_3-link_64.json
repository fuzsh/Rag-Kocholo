        "text": "This week, Billboard is celebrating the music of 20 years ago with a week of content about the most interesting artists, albums, songs and stories from 1998. Here, we present a chronological run through a number of notable ’98 memories that we that didn’t have the time or words to dive into in full: a whole 98 of ’em, in fact.\n\nThe year was 1998: A time when Britney Spears was the sweetheart of MTV’s new Total Request Live, Victoria (ahem, Posh Spice) and David Beckham were the new it-couple, the MP3 player was a controversial new gadget and some of today’s biggest stars — from Khalid to Shawn Mendes — were still in their baby cribs. As part of Billboard‘s 1998 Week, we’re looking back at the moments that made up that monumental year in music, from celebrity break-ups to stage crashers, era-defining singles and wild lawsuits.\n\nReminisce on the most memorable events of the year with our chronological wrap-up, below.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nJan 1: The debut of MTV’s Celebrity Deathmatch\n\nMTV kicks off the new year with the debut of its late-night, gory claymation series, pitting animated pop culture icons against each other in battles to the death, aptly titled Celebrity Deathmatch. In the inaugural episode, Marilyn Manson faces off with notorious murderer Charles Manson, beginning the former Manson’s long-standing reign as Deathmatch’s undefeated fighter.\n\nJan 5: Sonny Bono dies in a skiing accident at age 62\n\nLess than a week after Michael L. Kennedy, son of RFK, was tragically killed after colliding with a tree while skiing in Aspen, Colo., Sonny Bono — one-half of iconic duo Sonny & Cher — meets the same fate on vacation with family at a resort in South Lake Tahoe, Calif.\n\nJan 6: The 1998 Grammy nominee list includes LeAnn Rimes and Trisha Yearwood — for the same song\n\nThough tear-jerker ballad “How Do I Live” was originally written for then-teenaged LeAnn Rimes to sing on the soundtrack for action film Con Air, the rising country star was later replaced by Trisha Yearwood, whose own recording ended up on the big screen. Nonetheless, both versions get nominated for the female country vocal performance Grammy, with Rimes performing the song live at the ceremonies, but Yearwood taking home the prize immediately after.\n\nJan 12: The annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction fosters reunions\n\nWhen Jimmy Buffett inducts The Eagles, all past and present members at the time unite (for the only time in history) to perform iconic hits “Take It Easy” and “Hotel California.” Earlier that night, the trailblazing San Francisco rock outfit Santana are inducted, with many original band members returning to perform “Black Magic Woman” alongside frontman Carlos Santana, the first-ever Hispanic inductee.\n\nJan 15: Chicago blues leader Junior Wells dies at age 63\n\nSeveral months after suffering a heart attack, and following a long battle with lymphoma, Chicago blues icon Junior Wells passes away in the city where he built his legacy. A frequent collaborator of Buddy Guy, Wells helped bridge the gap between traditional blues and contemporary popular music, performing with singers like Van Morrison and Tracy Chapman and even touring with The Rolling Stones.\n\nJan 19: Controversial doc Kurt and Courtney is pulled from Sundance Film Festival\n\nFour years after Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was reported to have committed suicide, rumors of foul play are still being passed around. In his controversial documentary Kurt and Courtney, Nick Broomfield opened the can of worms by interviewing four people who suspected Cobain’s widow (and Hole singer) Courtney Love played a part in the tragedy — including Love’s own father. The film makes headlines when it gets abruptly pulled from the Sundance lineup amidst lawsuit threats from Love, who avoids the film’s accusations and instead claims it illegally made use of Hole and Nirvana songs.\n\nJan 19: “Blue Suede Shoes” singer Carl Perkins dies at age 65\n\nA close friend and collaborator to the likes of Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, The Beatles, Bob Dylan and more, Carl Perkins’ rockabilly sound permeated genres and became a building block of modern rock and roll. Perkins passes away from throat cancer at 65 in Tennessee, after suffering a series of strokes.\n\nBetween Jan 19 and Jan 26: Snoop Dogg exits Death Row Records\n\nAfter signee Tupac’s death in 1996, MC Hammer and Dr. Dre’s departure from the label that same year and CEO Suge Knight’s nine-year prison sentence in 1997, it was the perfect storm for the fall of Death Row, once one of hip-hop’s most powerful labels. As tensions mount and Knight’s control over the label diminishes, Snoop Dogg abandons ship, joining an exodus of rappers that would eventually lead the label to file for bankruptcy in 2006.\n\nJan 20: *NSYNC release “I Want You Back” in the U.S.\n\nAfter gaining the attention of RCA A&R rep VIncent DeGiorgio, who offered the boy band an American record deal in November 1997, *NSYNC mark their first release in both the U.K. and U.S. with single “I Want You Back.” The song peaks at No. 13 on the Hot 100 in May, setting the stage for the band’s national takeover.\n\nJan 22: Fiona Apple opens up to Rolling Stone\n\nIn a cover story for Rolling Stone titled “Fiona Apple: The Caged Bird Sings,” the notoriously private singer-songwriter behind 1996 debut Tidal opens up for the first time about her rape as a child and subsequent mental health struggles, her now-famous “this world is bullshit” MTV Video Music Awards speech and more. Twenty years later, the story remains one of the most revealing interviews of Apple’s career.\n\nJan 25: Grease ends a 1,503-show run\n\nThe Broadway revival of Grease, directed by Jeff Calhoun, opened at New York’s historic Eugene O’Neill Theatre in May of 1994 with a cast including Ricky Paull Goldin, Susan Wood and Rosie O’Donnell (who was later replaced by Brooke Shields). By the end of its run four years later, the revival was nominated for three Tony awards and grossed more than $72.3 million.\n\nJan 25: Victoria Beckham (a.k.a Posh Spice) and David Beckham get engaged\n\nLegend has it that U.K. It Couple “Posh and Becks” met at a charity soccer game in 1997. It’s only a year later that the soccer star proposes to the Spice Girl at the height of her fame.\n\nJan 26: The 25th installment of the American Music Awards\n\nDrew Carey, then star of The Drew Carey Show, hosts the 25th annual American Music Awards in Los Angeles, which features performances by Janet Jackson, Matchbox Twenty and Trisha Yearwood. The Spice Girls are the biggest winners of the night, racking up three honors — though the absent group only appear singing in a pre-taped segment.\n\nJan 28: Interscope Records incites “pay-for-play” controversy\n\nPortland, Ore. radio station KUFO-FM makes history by agreeing to play Limp Bizkit’s song “Counterfeit” at least 50 times over the course of five weeks in return for a $5,000 check from Interscope Records — a controversial decision that brings the concept of pay-for-play to the center of industry debate, but helps beak the nu-metal band in the U.S. mainstream.\n\nJan 29: Bobby Brown is found guilty of a DWI in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.\n\nWhen Bobby Brown crashed his Porsche in South Florida in 1996, it was neither the first nor the last time he’d have a brush with the law — over the years, the “Every Little Step” singer became infamous for his legal troubles. This time, Brown is convicted (two years later) of driving under the influence, as well as causing property damage, and he serves five days in jail before being released on probation.\n\nJan 29: Paul Simon’s The Capeman musical has a rocky start\n\nThe Simon & Garfunkel singer’s most significant career failure comes in the form of The Capeman, a Broadway musical based on the true story of Salvador Agron, a convicted killer who became a poet in prison. When the Marc Anthony-starring musical opens at New York’s Marquis Theater, it does so to protests from the families of Agron’s real-life victims, and the show receives overwhelmingly negative reviews overall, closing after just 68 performances.\n\nJan 31: Toni Braxton files for bankruptcy protection\n\nR&B star Toni Braxton makes headlines when she files for bankruptcy protection the same week as the 1998 American Music Awards — for which, ironically, she was nominated twice. Within the next two months, all of the “Un-Break My Heart” singer’s belongings would be liquidated in order to help pay back her whopping $2.8 million debt. (Notably, Braxton still manages to make history that year, becoming the first black woman to portray Belle in a Broadway production of Beauty and the Beast that September.)\n\nJan 31: The Presidents of the United States of America play a farewell show\n\nGoofy alt-rock trio The Presidents of the United States of America briefly disband in 1998 when lead vocalist Chris Ballew calls it quits to spend more time with family. Fans bid the group goodbye as they play a farewell show in their hometown of Seattle… only to reunite just two years later. (They retire again, presumably for real, in 2016.)\n\nFeb 5: Former Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford comes out as gay\n\nWhen former Judas Priest lead vocalist Rob Halford comes out as gay in an interview with MTV, he becomes one of the first high-profile metal musicians to do so; twenty years later, the now-66-year-old “Metal God” continues to be a vocal advocate for LGBTQ acceptance.\n\nFeb 6: Carl Wilson of The Beach Boys dies at age 51 following a battle with lung cancer\n\nDespite being diagnosed with lung and brain cancer in early 1997, Carl continued to perform Southern California-defining hits like “Wouldn’t It Be Nice” and “Surfin’ U.S.A.” live with the band while undergoing chemotherapy, taking part in The Beach Boys’ entire summer 1997 tour. After a hard-fought year, the leader of the seminal surf band passes away in Los Angeles on Feb 6, 1998, just two months after the death of his mother, Audree Wilson.\n\nFeb 11: Khalid is born at a United States Army post in the state of Georgia\n\nThe “Young Dumb & Broke” star is born Khalid Donnel Robinson in Fort Stewart, Georgia. Due to his mother’s career in the military, he spends his childhood in more than one “Location,” including Kentucky, New York and even Germany.\n\nFeb 14: John Cameron Mitchell’s Hedwig and the Angry Inch premieres Off-Broadway\n\nThe punk-rock tale of a German rock diva who is the victim of a botched gender-reassignment surgery turns heads, with Patti LuPone, David Bowie and Glenn Close reportedly among its attendees. The show comes to Broadway in 2014, where it picks up a Tony for the best revival of a musical, racking up eight total nominations.\n\nFeb. 19: Country legend Louis Marshall Jones (a.k.a. “Grandpa Jones”) dies at age 84\n\n“Grandpa Jones” — a persona the banjo player and country singer became known for at just 22 years old — was famous for wearing his pants tucked inside of his boots, and praised for his pioneering influence on “old time” country music. Jones suffered two strokes after his second show performance at the Grand Ole Opry in January 1998, passing away one month later. He is remembered in the Country Music Hall of Fame, where he became a member in 1978.\n\nFeb 24: Elton John is knighted by Queen Elizabeth II at London’s Buckingham Palace\n\nThe British rock star appears before the Queen to be knighted as Sir Elton John for his services to pop music and extraordinary work raising money for AIDS charities.\n\nFeb 25: The 40th annual Grammy Awards’ “SOY BOMB” moment\n\nThe words “SOY BOMB” enter the minds of pop junkies forever when, during Bob Dylan’s performance of “Love Sick,” performance artist Michael Portnoy rushes onstage shirtless with the slogan written on his chest. Portnoy isn’t the only stage-crasher of the night: Ol’ Dirty Bastard also storms the stage to declare that “Wu-Tang is for the children,” protesting his group’s earlier loss to Puff Daddy in the best rap album category during folk singer Shawn Colvin’s song of the year acceptance speech.\n\nFeb 28: Celine Dion’s “My Heart Will Go On” debuts at No. 1 on the Hot 100 following the whirlwind success of Titanic\n\nThe romantic ballad skyrockets to mega-success all over the world, becoming Dion’s biggest hit and one of the best-selling singles in history. Eventually, it scores the diva a Grammy for record of the year, and wins best original song at the Academy Awards in March.\n\nFeb 28: Haitian group RAM survive an assassination attempt\n\nAfter clashing with the then-newly-elected mayor of Port-au-Prince, Haitian group RAM survives an assassination attempt while performing at the city’s annual Mardis Gras carnival. Thankfully, all three members survive –and in 2016, they release their first studio album in a decade, Ram 6: Manmanm Se Ginen.\n\nMarch 2: Toni Braxton airs her financial troubles on The Oprah Winfrey Show\n\nThe singer-songwriter later accuses Winfrey of being “so frickin’ mean” during the interview, where Braxton delves into her bankruptcy filing.\n\nMarch 5: Mariah Carey and Tommy Mottola divorce\n\nThe singer and music exec had married back in 1993 with a grand ceremony, modeled after the royal wedding of Princess Diana and Prince Charles. After the couple divorce in ’98, it is revealed that Mottola was physically and emotionally abusive in the relationship.\n\nMarch 7: Van Halen’s “Without You” spends the first of six weeks atop the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart\n\nHard rock heroes Van Halen earn their 13th No. 1 on Billboard’s Mainstream Rock Airplay chart in 1998 with the six-and-a-half-minute marathon “Without You,” one of the band’s first songs to feature vocals from new lead singer Gary Cherone, veteran of the band Extreme. The record is only just matched in March 2018, when Three Days Grace notch their own 13th list-topper with “The Mountain.”\n\nMarch 9: Eminem is signed by Dr. Dre to Aftermath Entertainment\n\nAfter the then-fledgling Detroit rapper placed second in the annual Rap Olympics that year, a copy of his Slim Shady EP is said to have made its way to Dr. Dre, who signs Eminem to his Aftermath Entertainment — on the one-year-anniversary of Notorious B.I.G.’s death, no less. The decision solidifies Em as the cornerstone of the label, and just the next year, his Slim Shady LP goes platinum in five quick weeks.\n\nMarch 9: FIFA calls on Ricky Martin to create the 1998 World Cup theme song\n\nWhat results is Martin’s career-changing “La Copa de la Vida (The Cup of Life),” which hits charts in more than 60 countries and sets the foundation for his international success to come with his self-titled album the next year.\n\nMarch 10: The first mass-produced portable MP3 player is launched at a German trade fair\n\nThe South Korean-made MPMan F10 costs $250, features just 32MB of flash memory (roughly eight songs!) and has a tiny LCD screen for playback info, but it marks a major milestone for portable music, and lays the groundwork for the iPod’s explosion in 2001.\n\nMarch 10: The Beastie Boys post MP3 recordings of their songs on their website\n\nThe simple move makes The Beastie Boys one of the first acts to embrace the then-controversial MP3 audio format.\n\nMarch 22: Canadian hip-hop group The Rascalz refuse a Juno award\n\nThe Rascalz become one of the first to launch the conversation of diversity in awards ceremonies, refusing their Juno honor for best rap recording. “Urban music, reggae, R&B and rap: that’s all Black music and it’s not represented at the Junos,” reads a statement from the band’s manager Sol Guy at the time. “We decided that until it is, we are going to take a stance.”\n\nMarch 23: Elliott Smith performs “Miss Misery” at the Oscars\n\nElliott Smith was still gigging at Brooklyn coffee shops when filmmaker Gus Van Sant asked to use the singer’s music in his 1997 film Good Will Hunting. So it was a major milestone for Smith when, after his soundtrack contribution “Miss Misery” was nominated for a best original song Oscar, he gets asked to perform it at the film awards ceremony, delivering a haunting rendition of the ballad.\n\nMar 27: K-pop website Soompi hits the web\n\nSoompi, the longest-running website dedicated to K-pop, was created by Korean-American web developer Susan Kang — though at the time, she identified herself only as “Soomp,” a major fan of Korean boy band M.O.T. Soompi has since been bought out by Tokyo-based e-commerce company Rakuten, and remains a huge destination for K-pop heads all over the world.\n\nMarch: Britney Spears begins recording her debut album, …Baby One More Time, at Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden\n\nReleased in January 1999, Spears’ debut album …Baby One More Time would launch the then-teenaged singer into pop superstardom for decades to come. But in 1998, the soon-to-be icon had just begun work on the LP, recording half the album in the pop hub of Sweden with Max Martin, including its Hot 100-topping title track.\n\nMarch: Jennifer Lopez and Ojani Noa divorce\n\nThe union lasted only a year, but the drama between J. Lo and her first husband — who was working as a waiter when they first met — hasn’t stopped since. J. Lo later sues Noa to prevent him from publishing a book about their short-lived marriage; in 2015, Noa threatens to release a sex tape with the star (which never materializes).\n\nApril 1: R.E.M.’s Michael Stipe and friends publish a book of haikus\n\nSometime in the late ‘90s, R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe made a pact with six friends to each write one haiku per day for a year. Their efforts are published in Haiku Year, a 120-page paperback that includes hundreds of moving, witty and at times funny poems like this one: “‘Coffee & Pastry’ sign / I thought it said ‘Poetry’ / I would’ve ordered.”\n\nApril 3: Dave Navarro exits the Red Hot Chili Peppers\n\nDave Navarro became the eighth Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist when he joined the band’s ever-changing lineup in 1994 during a hiatus from Jane’s Addiction. Four years later, he departs over creative differences, as cited by frontman Anthony Kiedis in a label statement.\n\nApril 3: Lollapalooza is canceled after failing to sign a headliner\n\nFor what was the first time in eight years, Lollapalooza is forced to cancel its annual Chicago music festival in 1998 due to its failure to sign a major headliner. At the time, the embarrassing announcement is taken to signify alternative rock’s declining popularity — though the fest is rebooted a half-decade later, and finds greater success as a non-touring, multi-day concert shortly after.\n\nApril 6: “Stand By Your Man” country singer Tammy Wynette dies at age 55\n\nAfter a long history of medical complications, country music legend Tammy Wynette — best known for her signature ballad “Stand By Your Man” — dies of a blood clot in her Nashville home.\n\nApril 7: George Michael is arrested in a Beverly Hills public restroom for engaging in a “lewd act”\n\nThe late George Michael finds himself at the center of one of the greatest pop-world scandals of the late ’90s in a public bathroom in Beverly Hills, where he is famously arrested for engaging in a “lewd act.” Charged with a misdemeanor, he is released after posting $500 bail, and shortly after releases the cheeky “Outside” video in response to the incident and his subsequent outing.\n\nApril 8: Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee is sentenced to six months in prison for spousal abuse and battery\n\nIn one of the darker news stories to surface in 1998, rock star Tommy Lee serves four months of a six month sentence in Los Angeles County Jail for battering his wife, actress Pamela Anderson Lee, after pleading no contest to a felony charge of spousal battery.\n\nApril 14: Aretha Franklin, Gloria Estefan, Celine Dion, Shania Twain and Mariah Carey star in premiere of VH1’s Divas Live\n\nThe inaugural VH1 Divas Live brings five musical powerhouses — Franklin, Estefan, Dion, Twain and Carey — together for a one-night-only performance in Manhattan, in support of the network’s still-existing Save the Music Foundation. Legendary singer-songwriter Carole King also makes an appearance at the show, where all six singers join in a rendition of “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman” — a track made famous by Franklin in 1967, and co-written by King.\n\nApril 18: The Rolling Stones reschedule part of their European tour after Keith Richards takes a tumble\n\nKeith Richards might be unsinkable, but you can sidetrack him for a moment. In April, Keif tumbles like dice off a ladder in his library, injuring his ribs and chest and forcing the Stones to reschedule part of their European tour.\n\nApril 19: Cher is presented with the Vanguard Award at the GLAAD Media Awards\n\n“I feel like the gay poster girl,” said Cher, accepting the Vanguard Award at the 1998 GLAAD Media Awards for promoting equal rights in the gay community. The honor not only cements the “Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves” singer’s enduring status as a gay icon — it’s also a family affair, given that Cher’s own daughter Chastity Bono served as GLAAD’s entertainment director at the time.\n\nApril 26: U2 cameos on The Simpsons\n\nThe 200th episode of The Simpsons, titled “Trash of the Titans,” enlists U2 to guest-star as themselves in a memorable sketch that winked at the group’s real-life environmentalism (Bono: “The man’s talking about waste management. That affects the whole damn planet.”)\n\nApril 30: An Indigo Girls concert at a South Carolina high school is canceled after parents complain about its singers, who are openly gay\n\nThe controversial decision sparks debate among several southern high schools, where the band was set to perform a mini-tour.\n\nMay 8: The Beatles are awarded full rights to Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany\n\nGeorge Harrison offers in-person testimony to win over rights to the famous bootleg tapes of live performances by the English rock group during their final pre-fame Hamburg residency in 1962.\n\nMay 9: Israeli singer Dana International becomes the first-ever trans winner of Eurovision\n\nWith “Diva,” her pounding dance-pop ode to mortal and immortal women throughout history (from Cleopatra to Aphrodite), Dana International becomes the first ever trans winner of the Eurovision Song Contest. The Tel Aviv-born singer represents Israel in the competition.\n\nMay 14: Frank Sinatra dies of a heart attack at the age of 82\n\nIn tribute to the beloved jazz icon Frank Sinatra, the lights on the Empire State Building turn blue and the lights in the Vegas Strip are dimmed, doing Ol’ Blue Eyes proud.\n\nMay 14: Seinfeld says goodbye?\n\nConcert promoters across the U.S. push back set times to avoid competing with the series finale of Seinfeld, which 76.3 million people end up watching, according to Nielsen.\n\nMay 28: LA Weekly reporter Belissa Cohen sues Courtney Love\n\nLA Weekly reporter Belissa Cohen sues Courtney Love for alleged assault and battery while attending a fashion show. A rep for the Hole singer denies the charges; Love herself comments that Cohen “just wants money and has lithium problems.”\n\nMay 31: Geri Halliwell, A.K.A.
