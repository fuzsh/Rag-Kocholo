        "text": "For the storage of lithium batteries, analogies can be derived to the transport regulations for hazardous goods and the hazardous materials ordinance or TRGS\n\nIn accordance with the law on hazardous goods: provide a protection design based on the hazard potential, e.g. differentiation between new products, end-of-life batteries, damaged batteries, prototypes, etc.\n\nIn accordance with the law on hazardous substances, design the storage facility as for a hazardous materials storage facility in accordance with TRGS 510, including design as F90, access restriction, ventilation, prohibition of combined storage.\n\nThe following storage solutions have proven themselves in practice:\n\nSafety cabinets in accordance with EN14470\n\nADR-compliant container and transportation systems with fire protection function\n\nFire protection containers with tested fire resistance\n\nOther additional conditions:\n\nstorage is only permitted if lithium batteries are tested in accordance with UN38.3, otherwise only following an appropriate risk assessment.\n\nNo charging in the storage area!\n\nCharging dealt with separately from storage.\n\nOnly daily requirements outside of warehouses\n\nMinimum quantity limitation or encapsulation\n\nProperty insurance and, in the case of larger quantities, the fire brigade should be involved in the decision-making process in terms of proper storage. See also fire protection concept.\n\nTransport regulations\n\nSince 2009, lithium batteries have been officially noted as Class 9 hazardous goods (various hazardous substances and item). And that's no bad thing! For small lithium batteries (<100Wh), the legislation provides relief for e.g. power banks, mobile phones or laptop batteries via special provision 188 in the ADR. Under certain conditions, their transportation does not fall under the considerably more complicated hazardous goods transportation requirements for larger batteries.\n\nThe following points must be worked through in connection with the transportation:\n\nUN 3090 (Lithium-metal batteries) or UN 3480 (Lithium-ion battery)\n\nClassification into small (according to SV188) or larger lithium batteries\n\nChoice of container or packaging\n\nCorrect packing method\n\nADR-compliant labelling\n\nFor lithium batteries there are various special regulations and packaging instructions in the ADR (i.e. transportation by road). These differ, in some cases considerably, in the requirements associated with them and the choice of container or packaging.\n\nADR distinguishes between\n\nNew/intact lithium batteries (normal case)\n\nLithium batteries with prototype status\n\nDefective/damaged lithium batteries\n\nLithium batteries for disposal/recycling\n\nIn principle, transportation by air is much more complicated, and the shipping of defective/damaged lithium batteries is even strictly prohibited. Lithium batteries in aircraft have been associated with too many accidents, sometimes even with crashes. It is advisable to consult the transport service provider in advance with regard to the transportation and what needs to be taken into account.\n\nLegal regulations - obligation to instruct:\n\nAll persons involved in the transportation of hazardous goods (e.g. lithium batteries) MUST be instructed in the requirements for their area of work and responsibility. Even those who are not subject to the law on hazardous goods (e.g. because of SV 188) should know exactly why they are exempt and what conditions they have to comply with.\n\nSpecial feature: transportation of lithium batteries as hazardous goods\n\nLithium batteries are considered hazardous goods under transport law. A UN approval of the container alone does not justify all requirements to carry out the ADR-compliant transportation of lithium batteries for all cases. We therefore recommend that our customers acquire the appropriate technical knowledge in the field and to train the responsible employees extensively so that the containers are used according to the regulations. This includes having appropriate understanding of the official packaging instructions, the labelling in accordance with ADR and the conscious handling of e.g. damaged lithium batteries.\n\nGeneral safety rules\n\nAccording to GDV / VdS, the following are to be observed in principle (even for small quantities):\n\nCompliance with all specifications of the respective manufacturers and technical product data sheets\n\nPrevention of external short circuits (protection against short circuiting the battery poles, e.g. by using pole caps)\n\nPrevention of internal short circuits (protection against mechanical damage)\n\nDo not expose to high temperatures or heat sources directly and permanently (e.g. including direct sunlight)\n\nIn areas not protected by automatic extinguishing systems, a structural or spatial separation of at least 2.5 m from other flammable materials must be maintained.\n\nDamaged or defective lithium batteries must be removed immediately from storage and production areas and temporarily stored at a safe distance or in a fire protection area until disposal.\n\nOnly cells and batteries for which proof of testing according to UN 38.3 is available may be stored (prototypes may be stored in exceptional cases and only with a risk assessment).\n\nWhen charging batteries, the instructions of the manufacturers and insurers must be observed.\n\nSource:VdS3103\n\nSpecific safety rules\n\nAccording to GDV / VdS, the following are to be observed in particular:\n\nLow-power lithium batteries (≤ 100 Wh)\n\nFor batteries in this category the general safety rules apply; for this there are no specific safety rules. For larger connected storage quantities (volumes over 7 m³ or more than six Euro pallets) the instructions for medium capacity lithium batteries apply.\n\nMedium capacity lithium batteries (> 100 Wh and ≤ 12 kg)\n\nAreas with medium power batteries must be separated from other areas spatially (at least 5 m) or structurally fire resistant mixed bearing arrangements with other products, which can accelerate a fire , should be avoided The storage area is to be monitored by means of a suitable fire alarm system with connection to a permanently occupied location . In terms of the presence of fire extinguishing systems, the information in reference to suitable extinguishing agents in the respective technical product data sheets must be taken into account. For larger storage quantities (occupied area > 60 m² and/or storage heights > 3 m), the instructions for high-performance lithium batteries apply.\n\nHigh-performance lithium batteries (> 100 Wh and > 12 kg)\n\nIn terms of high-performance batteries no no secure knowledge currently exists regarding the adequate protective measures . Protective measures are therefore to be taken in agreement with the property insurer for the individual case. Conceivable measures in this respect include e.g:\n\nSeparation and quantity limits\n\nStorage in fireproof separated areas or with adherence to a safety distance (spatial separation of 5 m)\n\nAutomatic fire extinguishing systems\n\nSource:VdS3103\n\nRisk assessment\n\nThe operating instructions and, if necessary, a \"safety data sheet\" from the battery manufacturer should provide initial orientation. Lithium batteries pose an array of hazards: electrical hazard, fire hazard, environmental hazard, acid leakage etc.\n\nIn order to determine all the hazards posed by lithium batteries, it is necessary to look at the entire process within the company (i.e. from goods receipt, operation, storage and disposal). It is crucial to make a breakdown in the classification because of the considerable differences in risk: new, damaged, in use, charging, etc.\n\nTypical examples of what needs to be identified and evaluated in terms of a risk assessment\n\nEmployees must be aware of the criteria that apply when a lithium battery becomes conspicuous or is considered defective/damaged (meaning that it is no longer in use)\n\nThe correct handling of returns/complaints from customers must be clarified if they arrive in an unknown (hazardous) condition at your own company. In any case, the charging of lithium batteries must be considered in the employer's risk assessment. All hazards associated with the charging processes and storage of the batteries must be assessed and it must be determined which occupational safety measures are necessary. Employee instruction and operating instructions for handling lithium batteries can then be derived from the written documented risk assessment.\n\nFire protection concept\n\nA holistic fire protection concept is important. This should include not only structural/technical protective measures (e.g. a safety cabinet) but also organisational/behavioural protective measures (e.g. the separation of damaged batteries). In terms of the concept design, the employer must also consider the question of a sprinkler system or smoke detector/fire alarm system.\n\nEven the best fire protection concept is useless if the employees are not prepared for an emergency. This means that staff training, definition of the rescue chain, the commissioning of hand fire extinguishers and PPE if necessary, emergency training are all important.\n\nDiscussions with the fire brigade & property insurers\n\nA fire protection concept should never worked out behind closed doors, but should be a team effort involving a range of participants and experts. These should include above all, storage solution manufacturers, affected employees, managers, fire safety officers, insurance representatives, the fire brigade and external experts.\n\nThe effectiveness and timeliness of the fire protection concept should be reviewed regularly."
