        "text": "Nonlinear optics (NLO) is an ever-growing field of research enabled by lasers.1 Because strong light intensities are required for NLO effects to become relevant, such effects can be greatly enhanced when used in waveguides in which light is tightly confined. Only non-centrosymmetric materials, such as the ferroelectric crystals lithium niobate (LN), lithium tantalate (LT), and potassium titanyl phosphate (KTiOPO4, KTP), naturally exhibit a non-zero second-order nonlinearity, χ(2), which enables wave-mixing processes such as second-harmonic generation (SHG), sum- and difference-frequency generation, and optical parametric amplification.\n\nThe development of waveguides for efficient nonlinear optical conversion has been a topic of interest since the 1970s. Early work was devoted to basic studies, primarily based on birefringent phase matching in titanium-diffused LN waveguides, where the material dispersion limited the range of wavelengths accessible.2 Proton-exchanged (PE) waveguides where developed in the early 1980s, first by Jackel et al.,3 but as they guide only one polarization, they could only be used for nonlinear Cerenkov radiation.4 The introduction of quasi-phase matching (QPM) waveguides in the late 1980s made the field highly active.5,6 Conceptually, QPM consists in periodically resetting the phase mismatch between the interacting waves in order to force them to be in phase as they propagate along the nonlinear crystal. As the phase of the generated wave is related to the sign of the χ(2) nonlinearity, this can be achieved by periodically modulating the crystal structure. It is most commonly carried out by electric field poling, where periodic finger electrodes are placed on the polar face of the ferroelectric crystal, and by applying an electric field, exceeding the crystal’s coercive field, over the crystal. Domains of reversed polarization are then created under the electrode fingers. The period, Λ, of the lithographically defined electrode is chosen to compensate for the phase mismatch between the interacting waves, which by design gives flexibility in the choice of interacting wavelengths within the crystal’s full transparency range. Furthermore, with QPM, the strongest nonlinearity (d33 coefficient) for LN and KTP can be determined, which is inaccessible with birefringent phase matching. An efficient QPM waveguide made by electric field poling was fabricated for the first time in 1993, in LN, by Yamada et al.7 This achievement was a milestone in the field of nonlinear optics, which enabled an improvement of orders of magnitude in NLO conversion. Much of the efforts in the early days were directed toward developing visible sources as compact solid-state lasers were not available in this wavelength range at the time and several applications such as Blu-ray storage and biomedical detection had emerged.8 Many such devices have since then been commercialized. The field has attracted renewed attention over the last two decades primarily for its potential application in quantum technologies. In particular, LN waveguide devices have become popular as the key integrated platform for fundamental investigation of quantum phenomena and a variety of paradigm-shifting quantum technologies, such as photon-pair sources, heralded-single-photon sources, coherent frequency-conversion interfaces, and quantum memories.9–11 In addition, thin-film lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) has more recently emerged as a hybrid material platform and become commercially available. The thickness of the thin films is usually between 300 and 700 nm,12 leading to waveguides with sub-micrometer cross sections, in which the light confinement is dramatically enhanced, enabling extremely efficient NLO conversion. However, the often large propagation and coupling losses exhibited by waveguides on LNOI13 have so far limited their widespread application, particularly in quantum optical technologies where losses are detrimental.14\n\nThere are, nevertheless, limitations associated with LN, in particular for operation at visible wavelengths, as the crystal is susceptible to photorefraction,15 as well as green-induced infrared absorption.16 In LN, the induced absorption was suggested16 to be related to the formation of polarons, which consist of electrons trapped by niobium antisite defects. This effect can be reduced by incorporating magnesium oxide, thereby reducing these antisite defects in LN. Alternatively, using stoichiometric LN (when the composition ratio [Li]/([Li]+[Nb]) is 50%) can also reduce the induced absorption. Furthermore, it is also challenging to fabricate the short-period QPM gratings required at these wavelengths. In the visible region, particularly toward shorter wavelengths, KTP is a more suitable material. It exhibits a high optical nonlinearity, excellent mechanical and thermal properties, and high resistance to photorefractive damage,17,18 as well as to green- or blue-induced infrared absorption especially in the continuous-wave regime. Furthermore, ion-exchanged waveguides in KTP allow a better transverse mode overlap between interacting waves19 and a better coupling to optical fibers than LN. However, KTP suffers from material homogeneities and a large ionic conductivity, which can affect the quality of the QPM grating negatively and result in inhomogeneous waveguide structures, as well as difficulties with the reproducibility of fabrication.20 Alternatively, the isomorph rubidium-doped potassium titanyl phosphate (RKTP) can be employed, in which the KTP crystal is doped with typically 0.3% Rb during growth. RKTP exhibits very similar linear and nonlinear optical properties to KTP but has the ionic conductivity reduced by approximately two orders of magnitude,21 which enhances the quality of both the fabricated QPM structures and the waveguides. In addition, crystals from the KTP family, such as RKTP, offer the possibility of being periodically poled with short periods, which is required for optical interactions at visible wavelengths. Furthermore, if the period is made in the sub-micrometer range, counter-propagating parametric interactions can be analyzed,22 in which a pump photon generates a forward-propagating signal photon and a narrow bandwidth backward-propagating idler photon. This process is highly interesting, for instance, for the generation of counter-propagating entangled photon pairs.23 Moreover, KTP and RKTP offer the possibility of group-velocity matching,24,25 enabling a separable joint-spectral-amplitude diagram, with applications in quantum information technology.23,26\n\nFor achieving an efficient nonlinear optical conversion, the waveguide should exhibit large nonlinearity, low propagation losses, uniform domain grating and geometry, strong optical confinement, and good mode overlap between the wavelengths involved in the process. Much effort has been dedicated toward the development of waveguides with the above-mentioned requisites fulfilled. This challenging task remains an open topic of research, in which devices are being continually improved.\n\nIn this Tutorial, we provide a comparative analysis of different waveguide technologies established for LN and KTP based on literature data and our simulations. The description in Sec. II briefly summarizes the different waveguide technologies, highlighting their most relevant aspects such as refractive index increase, propagation losses, susceptibility to photorefractive damage, and experimental values of conversion efficiency for SHG with the fundamental wavelength at 1.55 µm. For a more extensive description, we refer to the readers elsewhere.27–31 Simulations of mode profiles were performed in order to calculate the theoretical values of conversion efficiency and coupling efficiency (CE) to single-mode (SM) optical fibers, and the results are presented in Sec. III. Finally, in Sec. IV, results from the literature and simulations identify gaps where the waveguide performance is below the theoretical predictions, and possible improvements are discussed. It provides a roadmap for choosing the most appropriate waveguide type and material choice between LN and KTP to optimize the performance of targeted applications.\n\nAn overview of various waveguide technologies on LN, KTP, and RKTP is presented in this section. Their performance is discussed for SHG with the fundamental wavelength at 1.55 µm, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Emphasis is given to technologies based on ion-exchange32 due to its widespread use; however, other techniques have been successfully demonstrated in both LN and KTP, such as laser writing,33–36 ion implantation,37–40 and liquid-phase epitaxy.41 The diffusion of dopant ions into the crystal structure modifies the crystal’s chemical composition, thereby increasing its refractive index, resulting in a waveguiding layer. The solution to the diffusion equation32 assumes the form of a Gaussian function or a complementary error function (erfc) depending on whether the film was completely depleted during the diffusion process or not, respectively.42 In the case of proton exchange in LN, the situation is slightly different as the crystal changes phase at high proton concentrations with different diffusion constants in the different phases, resulting in a step-like index profile,3 as discussed below.\n\nThe conversion efficiency for SHG in waveguides is given by η = P2ω/Pω, where Pω and P2ω are the powers of the fundamental wave, of frequency ω, and the SH wave, of frequency 2ω, respectively. To compare the SHG performance of different waveguides, the normalized conversion efficiency, ηnorm=η/PωL2⁠, is used, with a normalization of the input power to 1 W and a waveguide length L of 1 cm. In the low-conversion regime, it is calculated as8,\n\nηnorm=8π2deff2Nω2N2ωc0ε0λω2Aovl,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Nω and N2ω are the modal refractive indices at the fundamental and SH wavelengths, respectively, λω is the fundamental wavelength, c0 is the speed of light in vacuum, ɛ0 is the vacuum permittivity, and deff is the effective second-order nonlinear coefficient. The normalized conversion efficiency ηnorm is used throughout this Tutorial because it allows the comparison between different waveguide technologies independent of the waveguide’s length and input power. The overlap area between the transverse modes at the fundamental and SH wavelengths is given by Aovl=Iovl−2⁠, where the overlap integral Iovl is defined as43,44\n\nIovl=∬E2ω*x,yEω2x,ydxdy∬E2ω2x,ydxdy12∬Eω2x,ydxdy,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Eω and E2ω are the electric fields of the fundamental and SH beams, respectively. The unit of the overlap area calculated using Eq. (2) is μm2. Moreover, in this Tutorial, only z-cut crystals with type-0 QPM is considered where both pump and SH photons exhibit TM polarization; thus, the large d33 coefficients of LN and KTP are used, with d33 = 32.4 pm/V45 and d33 = 16.9 pm/V,46 respectively.\n\nThe cross sections of some of the most common waveguide geometries are shown in Fig. 1. The comparison presented in this Tutorial comprises two different waveguide geometries, namely, channel waveguides and ridge waveguides. The latter are attractive for NLO conversion because they enable stronger optical confinement than channel waveguides, thus allowing larger conversion efficiencies. The first ridge waveguide fabricated in LN dates back to 1974,47 fabricated by ion-etching of a planar waveguide. Since then, various techniques have been successfully employed, such as dry etching,48–50 wet etching,51 femtosecond-laser structuring,52 precise-cutting using a diamond tool,53 and high-precision diamond-blade dicing.54 The latter has become a popular method since its first demonstration in 2001.54 In this technique, a rapidly rotating diamond blade is slowly moved along a crystal with a planar waveguide, creating a groove. Two parallel grooves are fabricated, thereby defining a ridge channel waveguide in between them. This method is fast and does not require the use of clean room facilities, and it can provide very smooth side walls, with hardly any chipping, leading to propagation losses as low as αloss = 0.2 dB/cm55 in LN.\n\nProton exchange71 is an ion-exchange technique in which the crystal is immersed in a liquid source of hydrogen ions; the most commonly used ones are pyrophosphoric acid72 or benzoic acid.33 The replacement of lithium ions (Li+) by hydrogen ions (H+) leads to a compositional modification referred to as Li1−xHxNbO3. If the acidity is strong, which is the case when the acids are undiluted, a large amount of H+ (up to x = 70%) replaces the Li+-ions, with an additional structural modification from the original crystalline α-phase to a cubic phase with a complete loss of the optical nonlinearity.73 Up to seven different phases have been identified in the PE layers,74 and most of them exhibit high propagation losses and strongly reduced electro-optic and nonlinear coefficients.75,76 The ion-exchange causes a step-like refractive index profile with an increase in ne up to δne ≈ 0.14 and a corresponding decrease in no down to δno ≈ −0.06.77 This means that the PE layer can guide a single polarization only, i.e., TM modes for z-cut LN. Subsequent to PE, a heat treatment can be used to further diffuse the H+-ions into the crystal, forming the so-called annealed proton-exchanged (APE) waveguides. The initial step-like refractive index profile then evolves into an exponential profile and, with continued annealing, to a Gaussian profile.78 Annealing under proper conditions (time and temperature)78 can fully restore the crystalline structure to the α-phase74 and thereby regaining the χ(2) nonlinearity.72,76,79,80 The propagation losses are then also reduced to αloss ≈ 0.15 dB/cm81 (measured at 800 nm), while the surface refractive index increase is reduced to δne(z = 0) = 0.02 with the waveguide depth approximately seven times larger than that just after PE.78\n\nAPE waveguides present advantages such as a low processing temperature, T ≈ 250–300 °C, and a high resistance to photorefractive damage;82 however, as the diffusion of protons takes place both sidewise and in depth, it gives an asymmetric refractive index profile and elliptical modes, resulting in poor overlap between the fundamental (TM00) modes at the fundamental and SH wavelengths. Variants in PE have been successfully demonstrated, such as soft proton exchange (SPE),83 high-index soft proton-exchange,84 vapor-phase proton-exchange,85 and high-vacuum vapor-phase proton-exchange.86 These techniques are attractive because they maintain χ(2) without being affected; however, very accurate control of the fabrication conditions is required to obtain reproducible results.\n\nThe largest normalized conversion efficiency demonstrated with APE channel waveguides was ηnorm = 65%/(W cm2),87 while for SPE channel waveguides, ηnorm = 48%/(W cm2) has been obtained.88\n\nAPE ridge waveguides have been successfully fabricated by dicing with propagation losses as low as 0.1 dB/cm.89 The largest conversion efficiency demonstrated for such APE ridge waveguides was ηnorm = 80%/(W cm2), achieved in commercial samples from HC Photonics.90\n\nThin-film waveguides exhibit a large refractive index contrast between the film and the substrate and symmetric optical-mode profiles with maintained material properties. Altogether, this leads to a very small modal cross section with a good overlap between the interacting modes, allowing for efficient nonlinear interaction at low input power. There are two main techniques employed for the fabrication of LN thin-film waveguides. The first technique is based on crystal ion slicing, which was developed in the late 1990s,94 resulting in the so-called lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI), in which submicrometer film thicknesses can be achieved with high homogeneity. In the second technique, LN is first bonded to a substrate using either an adhesive54 or by direct bonding;95 thereafter, the LN crystal is polished until the desired thickness is achieved,96 resulting in the so-called adhered waveguides. This method enables the realization of films with thicknesses as low as a few micrometers.\n\nThe commercial availability of LNOI has boosted the development of new devices over recent years. As the waveguide dimensions decrease, the impact of waveguide imperfections on the optical modes increases, and consequently, fabrication tolerances become very strict. In particular, propagation losses are typically large due to a large electric field strength at the waveguide sidewalls and scattering due to sidewall roughness. This becomes detrimental as the mode size is reduced here. There have recently been considerable efforts to reduce the sidewall roughness,97–99 leading to propagation losses as low as αloss = 0.027 dB/cm using dry etching100 and to αloss = 0.03 dB/cm using chemo-mechanical polishing.101,102 A major remaining challenge is the coupling of light in and out of LNOI waveguides as the dimensions are very small. The mode-mismatch for conventional optical fiber end-face coupling leads to coupling efficiencies of only CE ≈ 3%. Alternative more complex coupling schemes have been successfully implemented, such as use of grating couplers (CE ≈ 45%103), a tapered fiber (CE ≈ 65%104), and an inverse waveguide taper combined with a tapered fiber (CE ≈ 68%105).\n\nThe first demonstration of outstanding QPM SHG performance in an LNOI waveguide was carried out in 2018 by Wang et al., when a normalized conversion efficiency, ηnorm = 2600%/(W cm2), was achieved.106 In the following year, a waveguide was made where the QPM structure was optimized by monitoring the SH response during periodic poling, with ηnorm = 4600%/(W cm2), which is the largest reported ηnorm for LN to date.107\n\nThe technique to fabricate adhered thin films requires extremely accurate control of the polishing step in order to produce homogeneous waveguides. The highest efficiency ηnorm = 370%/(W cm2) in this case was demonstrated with a multimode adhered ridge waveguide fabricated on a 5 mol. % Zn-doped LN substrate.108\n\nIon-exchange can be carried out in KTP or in RKTP to fabricate waveguides, with univalent ions such as Cs+, Tl+, or Rb+ as dopants.19 As the K+-ions close to the surface diffuse out of the crystal, they leave K-vacancies behind. These are negatively charged and electrostatically attract dopant ions in the melt, which enter the crystal to counteract the charge unbalance. The vacancies are highly mobile and can act as hopping centers for the ions. Moreover, pre-existing vacancies also attract dopant ions from the melt.111 RbNO3 melts are the most commonly used exchange baths, and the resulting compositional modification is referred to as RbxK1−xTiOPO4.\n\nThe ionic conductivity in flux-grown KTP is often inhomogeneous over the grown boule and hence also in the wafer cut for waveguide fabrication. It can vary by as much as one order of magnitude along the y direction21 due to a spatial variation in vacancies, while it is more or less constant in the x-direction.112 Consequently, the depth of Rb-exchanged waveguides varies particularly for those with propagation in the y direction.58 This has hampered commercial production of KTP waveguides. RKTP is an interesting alternative to KTP for waveguide fabrication. It shows a much lower ionic conductivity than KTP as a result of the larger ionic radius of Rb+ than that of K+, which reduces the diffusivity in the ionic channels in the crystal network. As the Rb-exchange progresses and the concentration of Rb in the surface layer increases, the crystal’s conduction channels21 become more and more blocked, suppressing further ion-exchange and reducing the achievable diffusion depth.19 A consequence of this process is that ion-exchange in KTP or RKTP does not obey simple diffusion kinetics, as already noted in earlier works.19 Another consequence of the lower ionic conductivity is that the conditions for ion-exchange in RKTP are different than those in KTP. On the other hand, a positive aspect from the larger Rb+-ions being less mobile in the RKTP lattice than in KTP is that Rb-exchanged waveguides in RKTP are much more stable than those made in KTP, in which the Rb+-ions diffuse over time when the waveguide is operated at high optical powers,112 thereby changing their performance.\n\nDivalent ions such as Ba2+ or Sr2+ can be added to the melt in order to increase the ion-exchange rate. Most commonly, Ba(NO3)2 is added to the exchange bath, and each Ba2+-ion will diffuse into the crystal together with a vacancy, thereby replacing two monovalent ions (K+), to provide charge neutrality. The increase in the K-vacancy concentration increases the ionic conductivity and thus the ion-exchange rate for Rb+.111 Approximately, a 5% concentration of Ba can be incorporated in the crystal lattice without changing the crystal’s structure or its optical properties significantly.111 However, a larger Rb-concentration enabled by the divalent ions in the melt increases the strain in the crystal, which can lead to spontaneous domain reversal,113,114 deteriorating the domain grating in PP crystals. The addition of K+-ions to the melt reduces the maximum Rb-concentration in the crystal, while still maintaining a deep enough diffusion depth.111 To optimize the ion-exchange process, one should consider the delicate interplay between several parameters, such as surface quality, ionic conductivity, melt composition, and processing temperature.\n\nThere are no prior studies that have systematically investigated the ion-exchange dynamics in KTP or RKTP, although recent studies contributed significantly to understanding this complex process.115,116 The ion diffusion has a complementary error–function profile, which causes both ne and no to increase with the same profile. The maximum increase in the surface refractive index is up to δno(z = 0) = δne(z = 0) = 0.024 in the z direction for KTP.19 To this date, there are no corresponding available experimental data for the surface refractive index increase in RKTP.\n\nThe crystalline structure of KTP, RKTP, and RTP is the same and unaltered by the ion-exchange, which also holds good for χ(2),nonlinearity, in strong contrast to PE in LN, where the crystal goes through phase transitions and χ(2) is reduced. However, the temperature change during ion-exchange can result in strong internal fields and lead to spontaneous domain reversal when the domain walls are initially charged,116 as is the case when the domain walls are tilted (non-parallel to the polar axis). Tilted domains normally appear when the domains have not propagated fully through the crystal and stabilized or when they have broadened during periodic poling.116\n\nIon-exchanged waveguides on LN and KTP as well as ridge waveguides on LNOI have been simulated using the finite element analysis platform COMSOL, in which the geometry of each waveguide is given as an input to the software. The details for each case are described in the corresponding sections. The software then solves the frequency domain form of Maxwell’s equations using the finite element method. The resulting electric field transverse distribution is then the figure of interest. The calculations were performed for first order (m = 1), type-0 QPM with TM polarization on z-cut CLN and KTP, thus using the strongest nonlinear coefficient, d33. Furthermore, only single-mode waveguides at 1.55 µm were considered. The waveguides’ lateral and vertical directions are y and z, respectively, and light propagates along the x-direction. Given these considerations, the waveguides’ cross sections were modeled, and the resulting transverse mode profiles TM00 at the fundamental and SH wavelengths of 1.55 µm and 775 nm, respectively, were used to calculate the overlap area Aovl using Eq. (2), with the integral limits extended to infinity. The effective refractive indices of the fundamental and SH waveguide modes, Nω and N2ω, respectively, as well as Aovl were then used to calculate ηnorm using Eq. (1). In addition, the coupling efficiency between the waveguide’s TM00 mode at 1.55 µm and a standard single-mode optical fiber SMF28 was calculated via the overlap integral, with the fiber end coupled to the waveguide.\n\nIn all the simulations presented here, the extraordinary refractive index, ne, was considered to linearly depend on the ion-concentration profile C(y, z). Furthermore, the extraordinary refractive index increase on the surface, δne(z = 0), always assumed the maximum values reported in the literature to provide maximum confinement (see Sec. II).\n\nThe simulations were performed by varying the waveguide width w and depth d in the entire range where the waveguide was single mode at 1.55 µm, while considering the maximum refractive index increase resulting from each waveguide fabrication method. A summary of the refractive index profiles and values of δne(z = 0) used in the simulations is shown in Table I.\n\nTABLE I.\n\nWaveguide type . Profile of ne(z) . Profile of ne(y) . δne(z = 0) .

Each figure contains the calculated values of the overlap area Aovl, normalized conversion efficiency ηnorm, and coupling efficiency to an SM optical fiber. The results are expressed in terms of the waveguide’s width w and depth d, which result from the ion-exchange process.\n\nThe results in Figs. 2(a1)–2(d1) and 4(a1) illustrate that under certain conditions for the waveguide geometry, Aovl decreases as the waveguide width increases. This counter-intuitive behavior is present for all the channel waveguides based on ion diffusion. This effect is due to the weak mode confinement of narrow waveguides such that as their dimensions increases, they get a stronger mode confinement, thereby decreasing the overlap area. This effect is not present in any of the ridge waveguides, given that the refractive index contrast with air is always large. Nevertheless, for LNOI ridge waveguides, Aovl is larger for small depths, i.e., film thickness, due to the weaker mode confinement as the dimensions approach the lower limit for confining the mode.\n\nFrom Eq. (1), it is evident that ηnorm increases with decreasing Aovl. The values of Aovl achieved with each waveguide technology, as shown in Figs. 2(a1)–2(d1), 3(a1)–3(d1), and 4(a1)–4(d1), are a result of how strong the mode confinement is and of how good the overlap between the transverse-mode profiles at the fundamental and SH wavelengths is. When comparing the values of Aovl obtained with channel waveguides with the values obtained with ridge wave guides, the advantage becomes evident for the latter in terms of mode confinement. The sub-micrometer width of LNOI ridge waveguides leads to extremely small values of Aovl and thus extremely large values of ηnorm, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Moreover, the values of Aovl obtained with RPE channel waveguides are evidence of the improved mode overlap achieved in this type of waveguide.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the coupling efficiency (CE value), shown in Figs. 2(a3)–2(d3), 3(a3)–3(d3), and 4(a3)–4(d3), is larger for channel waveguides than for ridge waveguides due to a weaker mode confinement. Moreover, waveguides in KTP can have close to circular modes and hence exhibit excellent mode matching to fibers.\n\nIn this final section, a discussion comparing the simulation results and the literature results is presented, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each waveguide technology. In the following, the presented comparison is simplified in the sense that it is assumed that χ(2) was completely preserved and that propagation losses were negligible. However, these two assumptions are not always appropriate, as discussed in detail in the individual descriptions of each waveguide type in Secs. II A and II B. In the simulations, it was also assumed that the evanescent field of the guided modes (at the fundamental and SH waves) outside the waveguide region is negligible. This assumption enables the calculation of Iovl with the integration limits in Eq. (2) extend to infinity. This assumption is a good approximation for the ion-exchanged waveguides considered in the simulations; however, it is less appropriate for LNOI waveguides. In an LNOI waveguide, the optical fields become less confined to the guiding region as the waveguide dimensions are decreased, leading to an overestimation of the calculated ηnorm.107\n\nFigure 5(a) displays the efficiency values extracted from Figs. 2(a3)–2(d3), 3(a3)–3(d3), and 4(a3)–4(d3). The lower bound of each range can, of course, be decreased by reducing δne(z = 0) used in the simulations. The calculated values of ηnorm achieved with the different types of waveguides are shown as a solid fill, and the tremendous enhancement achievable with LNOI waveguides is clear in Fig. 5(a). The values of ηnorm multiplied by the coupling efficiencies between the TM00 mode at 1.55 µm and a single-mode optical fiber are also displayed in Fig. 5 (patterned fill). This multiplication is not carried out for LNOI ridge waveguides, for which end-fire coupling with a fiber is too inefficient. For SHG, this product corresponds to an input coupling efficiency, with a fundamental wavelength of 1.55 µm. The overall efficiency of the device consists of a multiplication of the input coupling efficiency, ηnorm, and the output coupling efficiency, i.e., the collection efficiency of a single-mode fiber.\n\nIn many applications, a low value of ηnorm can be compensated for by increasing the power of the fundamental field. For spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with generated photons at 1.55 µm, the multiplication displayed in Fig. 5 corresponds to an output coupling efficiency, when a single-mode optical fiber is used to collect the generated photons. For applications in quantum information technology, for instance, when the device is an entangled-photon-pair source based on SPDC, then ηnorm and the coupling efficiency should be considered separately. In this case, the output coupling efficiency is a severe limiting factor for the technological application, often preventing these devices from reaching the efficiency levels achieved with bulk optics.11\n\nThe record experimental values of ηnorm reported in the literature are included in Fig. 5(b) for waveguides on LN at 1.55 µm. To our knowledge, waveguides on KTP have not been used for SHG with a fundamental wavelength at 1.55 µm. Overall, the results indicate that the device performances generally remain below the theoretical values, with the exception of Zn-indiffused channel waveguides in LN. The maximum calculated value for ηnorm in Zn-indiffused channel waveguides in LN is slightly below the maximum value demonstrated experimentally. This is most likely due to the fact that in Ref. 67, the fabrication conditions lead to a larger δne than what was considered in the simulations. Regarding the LNOI ridge waveguides, the indicated record value was achieved by using a lensed fiber for coupling,107 leading to CE = 25%.\n\nA summary of relevant parameters for comparing the overall performance of different waveguides is given in Table II. It is noteworthy that the indicated values of CE serve as a comparison between the different technologies as they were calculated considering the maximum δne(z = 0) resulting from each waveguide fabrication method. In some cases, the CE could be improved by adjusting the waveguide mode area to match the mode area of the optical fiber better. This could be achieved in practice by reducing δne(z = 0), albeit at the cost of also reducing Aovl. In particular, the largest fiber coupling efficiency reported for RPE/APE channel waveguides was 90%,91 while our simulations indicate a value of 80%.\n\nTABLE II.\n\nWaveguide type .

While propagation and coupling losses reduce the overall transmission in the waveguide, thus decreasing the conversion efficiency, the above-mentioned inhomogeneities cause an asymmetry in the phase matching curve and drastically reduce the conversion efficiency.124\n\nThe results in Fig. 5 and Tables I and II indicate that waveguides on KTP present very promising conversion and coupling efficiencies once the challenges associated with the waveguide fabrication are overcome. It is worth mentioning that the experimental results of conversion efficiency shown for KTP waveguides are for SHG in the blue region as this is the available data in the literature. Nevertheless, at such shorter wavelengths, the values of Aovl are smaller than those in the IR; thus, an even larger theoretical ηnorm is expected. In particular, the excellent performance of channel waveguides is mainly due to the negligible transverse Rb-diffusion along the y direction, when compared to the diffusion in depth along the z direction. The resulting refractive index profile contributes to a strong mode confinement and means to obtain circular modes, thereby obtaining very high coupling efficiency to optical fibers. The data presented in Fig. 5 show that the calculated performance of channel wave guides in KTP is typically better than that of channel waveguides in LN, with the exception of RPE channel waveguides.\n\nWhen comparing the simulated values of ηnorm for ridge wave guides on APE LN and on Rb-exchanged KTP, the values are slightly larger for the latter, even though d33 in LN is almost twice as large as d33 in KTP.45,46 However, when comparing the materials, the figure of merit,1 FOM = d33/(⁠nωn2ω2⁠), is only ∼15% smaller for KTP than that of LN. This result indicates that ne(z) according to an error function leads to improved efficiencies when compared to ne(z) according to a Gaussian function.\n\nRecent progress on LNOI has shown that it is feasible to achieve low propagation losses of αloss = 0.03 dB/cm,100–102 a large CE value of 68%,105 and good homogeneity and thus a conversion efficiency as large as 4600%/(W cm2).107 These extremely promising results were demonstrated in different devices, and combining the state of the art fabrication processes in a single device would potentially enable LNOI waveguides to replace traditional waveguides on LN. For applications in quantum optics, however, further improvement in the CE value is still paramount, particularly on the collection side, as both photons in entangled pairs are needed for system applications."
