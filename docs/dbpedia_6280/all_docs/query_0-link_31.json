        "text": "The procedure in brief\n\nWithin Lund University premises, staff and students may only charge electronic equipment supplied by Lund University. Private mobile phones, laptops and tablets are exempted. Charging must be done using the correct charger.\n\nLithium-ion batteries intended for transport use or lithium-ion batteries larger than 10 Ah may not be charged, stored or otherwise handled on Lund University premises, except as follows:\n\n- outdoors, at an appropriate distance from buildings, where charging equipment and batteries are sheltered from the elements. Batteries should not normally be charged when the temperature is below freezing, since this can damage the batteries. This must be taken into consideration if charging is taking place outdoors.\n\n- indoors, in a room intended for the purpose, separate from other activities. The room is to have a fire rating of at least EI60, is to be well ventilated and equipped with smoke detection systems.\n\nThe procedure and guidance for the storage and charging of lithium-ion batteries is available to organisational managers on the HR website: Systematic fire safety management (in Swedish).\n\nLithium-ion batteries – for your organisation or for private use?\n\nLithium-ion batteries can be divided into two categories – those used in the organisation for research, teaching or by staff on duty, and those used by staff or students for private use.\n\nBatteries for University organisations\n\nThe first group, i.e. batteries used in the organisation, might include batteries for work bicycles, cleaning equipment, drones, power banks used by staff in the course of their jobs and so on. For these batteries, it may be necessary to adapt part of your premises so that it meets the requirements in Kammarkollegiet’s terms of insurance.\n\nIf, after an inventory of the organisation’s batteries, it emerges that the premises need adaptation for the storage of lithium-ion batteries, contact the building supervisor or equivalent. The building supervisor or equivalent is to complete a form informing the facilities planning group at LU Estates of these required alterations.\n\nLithium-ion batteries for private use\n\nInventories are underway at the faculties to establish the extent of the need for lockers to store private-use lithium-ion batteries. In spring 2024, Akademiska Hus is working in collaboration with LU Estates to propose a plan for which lockers are fit-for-purpose and where these lockers are to be placed on campus. A pilot with three lockers will be carried out during the year at LTH and afterwards an evaluation will be made to decide on the continuation. A dialogue with other property owners has also been initiated so that all organisations within the University provide the same conditions for all staff and students, regardless of which property owner the premises are rented from.\n\nWhat applies to private bicycle batteries in the meantime?\n\nUntil storage lockers or adapted premises are in place, or until you receive other instructions about what to do where you work or study, the following applies:\n\nYou may not bring in, store or charge your own bicycle battery anywhere indoors on University premises.\n\nYou may leave your battery on the bicycle provided it is parked a suitable distance away from the building.\n\nWheelchairs/mobility scooters etc.\n\nFor those who use, for example, an electric wheelchair or equivalent powered by lithium-ion batteries, Kammarkollegiet say:\n\n“It has never been Kammarkollegiet’s intention to restrict accessibility for people with functional impairments. There is also a difference in that these aids are under constant supervision when in use. If damage occurs, this is naturally something that Kammarkollegiet will consider when adjusting the claim. Otherwise, the safety regulations for handling lithium-ion batteries apply.”\n\nIn the event of a battery fire\n\nIt is important to act quickly in the event of a battery fire.\n\nAlert people to the fire.\n\nCall emergency services on 112\n\nReport the incident in the University’s incident management (IA) system.\n\nPrevent battery fires\n\nFires while charging are usually down to obviously damaged batteries or incorrect charging. If the battery is obviously damaged, it is not to be charged. The most important way of preventing fires while charging is to use the correct charging equipment and be alert to overloading and heat. If the object being charged gets very hot, charging must be stopped immediately. Extension cables or power strips are not to be used since they can be dangerous if they are not correctly dimensioned.\n\nMore information for organisational managers on how to prevent battery fires is available in the guidance for the storage and charging of lithium-ion batteries on the HR website: Systematic fire safety management (in Swedish).\n\nAlso read the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency’s tips for safe charging: Charge your batteries safely (msb.se, in Swedish).\n\nWorking group at LU Estates\n\nTo assist the University’s organisations with advice and guidance on individual questions, a working group bringing together different expertise on the issue has been formed at LU Estates. The working group will keep the information on this website up to date when new content is produced.\n\nFAQ"
