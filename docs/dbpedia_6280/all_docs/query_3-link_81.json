        "text": "Worlds collide on this tour of Hong Kong. From Aberdeen, a village on the water, to the soaring heights of Victoria Peak, experience Hong Kong from every vantage point. Gain a deeper understanding of Hong Kongâs culture and traditions by visiting key attractions such as Stanley Market and the Western District, riding a tram to Victoria Peak and cruising through a fishing village by sampan.\n\nDay 1\n\nAfter arriving at the Hong Kong International Airport and going through the luggage claim and Customs, you will be met at Arrival Hall B and transferred to the Kowloon Shangri La Hotel, where you will spend the evening.\n\nAlthough every effort will be made to have rooms ready before check-in at 3:00pm, this cannot be guaranteed. If you have an early arrival, you may wish to book an extra night so that your room will be available upon arrival.\n\nThe remainder of the day will be at your leisure and meals will be on your own. Feel free to simply settle in and relax or you might explore areas of Hong Kong not on the itinerary.\n\nDay 2\n\nFollowing breakfast at the hotel, you will drive to Hong Kong Island. For the ultimate view of the surroundings, you will ride the tram up to Victoria Peak. The worldâs steepest funicular railway, the Peak Tram opened in 1888 and has been providing spectacular panoramas ever since. As you ascend, you may notice that the steep slope causes an optical illusion in which the skyscrapers seem to be standing at impossible angles.\n\nAfter pausing for photos at the peak, you will drive on to Aberdeen fishing village and board a sampan boat. While on the water, you can expect to see fishing boats, Chinese junks and villagers doing chores. The experience offers a candid look into daily life, as does your next stopâa tour of a gem factory where you will learn how the craftsmen process the stones for sale or to be set into jewelry.\n\nThen following lunch, itâs on to vibrant Stanley Market, a highly popular shopping destination for merchandise such as silk garments, Chinese costume jewelry and art. As an alternative in Stanley, you might explore Tin Hau Temple, which once stood at the edge of the sea, and the Murray House, an early 19th-Century building that was moved from its original site to the seaside.\n\nYour next destination is Victoria Harbor. Board the renowned Star Ferry for a scenic cruise where you will experience the rhythm and vitality of the city from the water while enjoying the magnificent views offered by the Hong Kong skyline. Disembark and stroll along the Avenue of Stars which wraps around the waterfront. After viewing some of the icons of Hong Kong you will return to your hotel where the remainder of the evening is at your leisure. Dinner is on your own.\n\nDay 3\n\nAfter breakfast at the hotel, you will depart for Tung Chung, a city on Lantau, Hong Kongâs largest island.

The remainder of the day is at your leisure to relax, settle in and explore wherever you please. Check in time is at 3:00pm. Should you have an early arriving flight you may wish to book an extra night to guarantee your room is ready when you arrive.\n\nMeals are on your own.\n\nDay 2\n\nFollowing breakfast at the hotel and check out, you will be transferred to the airport for a flight to Xiâan. Upon arriving in Xiâan and passing through immigration, customs and baggage claim, you will start your tour with a visit to the Big Wild Goose Pagoda. One of Chinaâs most revered pagodas, it was built in 652 A.D. to house the sutras and figurines of Buddha that a Chinese monk brought to Xiâan. The building was eventually expanded to ten stories, although only seven stories remain, as the others were damaged in various wars. Nevertheless, the pagoda is recognized as a symbol of Xiâan.\n\nNext you will travel to the nearby Defachang Restaurant, popularly known for its dumplings. Carefully hand-prepared, the dumplings are available in dozens of different shapes and colors and filled with a variety of local ingredients. You can expect the meal to be wonderfully traditional. After dinner, you will drive back to the hotel to spend the evening.\n\nFollowing dinner, proceed to the Shangri La Xiâan (or similar hotel) for check in.\n\nDay 3\n\nFollowing breakfast at the hotel, you will drive to the Terracotta Warriors Museum, a repository for thousands of clay soldiers that were buried with Chinaâs first emperor to accompany him in his eternal rest. Considered one of the worldâs greatest archaeological treasures, the 7,000 life-size terracotta warriors and horses were buried for centuries until excavated in 1974.\n\nThe warriors are grouped in battle order, rank by rank, some mounted on horse-drawn chariots and others in infantry groups armed with spears, swords and crossbows. Each figure was individually created with unique characteristics.\n\nFollowing the tour and a traditional Chinese lunch at a nearby restaurant, visit the Shaanxi History Museum. Inside, seemingly countless exhibits depict the history of China from prehistoric times to the mid-19th century. It offers an enlightening overview of the country, with a particular emphasis on the Shaanxi Province.\n\nReturn to your hotel to freshen up before driving to the Tang Dynasty Theatre for dinner and a cultural performance. The costumed show features ancient music, poetry, singing and dance, some of which were developed as parts of ritual prayers for a good harvest. Following the lively performance, you will return to the hotel to spend the evening.\n\nDay 4\n\nAfter breakfast at the hotel and check out comes an exploration of the Muslim Quarter and its Grand Mosque. Muslims have lived in the quarter for more than 1,000 years ago, beginning with the merchants from Arabic countries that settled at this terminus of the Silk Road. The Grand Mosque is particularly fascinating, as it reflects traditional Chinese and Muslim styles.\n\nThen, itâs on to a traditional hot pot restaurant for lunch, before driving to the airport for the flight back to Hong Kong. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, you will be transferred to the Kowloon Shangri La where the remainder of the day is at your leisure. Dinner is on your own.\n\nDay 5\n\nEnjoy breakfast at your hotel before checking out and transferring to the port for embarkation.\n\nLand Program Details Step by Step:\n\nâ¢Please note: The order of sites visited may vary to avoid congestion.

Land program promotions are subject to terms.\n\nExplore historical and modern landmarks in Tokyo and then travel south to Hakone for a lake cruise in the shadow of Mt. Fuji and an enlightening visit to a meticulously reconstructed 15th-century castle.\n\nDAY 1\n\nAfter disembarking the ship, you will enjoy a half-day tour of Tokyo starting with a visit to the traditional Hamarikyu Gardens located alongside Tokyo Bay. Hamarikyu is a typical example of gardens from the Edo Period. It features the only seawater pond in Tokyo which change levels with the tides and a teahouse on an island where visitors can enjoy the scenery. From 1704, when this teahouse was first built, the Shoguns, and other elites such as Imperial Court nobles, who never tired of the relaxed atmosphere and the wonderful view of the place, used it continuously.\n\nNext, itâs on to Tokyo Tower, Japanâs second highest structure, which was built in 1958 as a symbol of Japanâs rebirth. After riding an elevator to the nearly 500-foot-high Grand Observation Platform, you will be treated to an astounding view of the city. If the sky is clear, you can see Mt. Fuji.\n\nFollowing lunch at a local restaurant, you will be transferred to your Odawara hotel to relax at your leisure. A bountiful buffet dinner will be served at the hotel. However, the remainder of the day is yours to enjoy as you please before you spend the evening at the hotel.\n\nNOTE: In general, hotel rooms in Japan are smaller than hotel rooms elsewhere around the world. Per Japanese culture, standard typical bedding is two twin beds. Although every effort will be made to obtain rooms with one bed for couples, this cannot be guaranteed. Should you require two beds, kindly make sure to advise this when booking your program.\n\nDAY 2\n\nToday, you will visit Hakone, a part of the Fuji National Park. Upon arriving at Sounzan (1-hour drive), you will board the Ropeway, a 30-minute aerial tram ride that affords you wonderful views of the Owakudani Valley. In time, you will stop at Lake Ashi for a scenic cruise. The crystal-clear lake was formed about 3,000 years ago in the caldera left after the volcanic eruption of Mount Hakone. If the conditions are ideal, as they often are, you will see Mt. Fuji and its inverted reflection on the water.\n\nEnjoy lunch at a local restaurant. On the return to the hotel, you will stop at Odawara Castle, which was originally built in the mid-15th century. The structure was destroyed in the latter half of the 19th century when political power changed from the Edo shogunate to the Meiji government, and the castle was condemned as the symbol of the samurai.\n\nThe castle that now stands is a reconstruction from 1960. However, the moat and stone walls are originals. The\n\ncastle is a three-tiered, five-storied donjon, and its top floor is an observatory.

When the sprawling metropolis, that is Tokyo nowadays, ran out of space, they inevitably turned toward the sea. Odaiba is a man-made island created by massive landfills, featuring many hypermodern and strange buildings memorably described as the result of a Pre-schoolerâs architecture class. You will have the chance to enjoy it from above, during a visit to an observation deck, located in one of Odaibaâs most iconic buildings: the headquarters of Fuji Television.\n\nContinue to the beautiful Hamarikyu Garden, an Edo Period Japanese garden surrounded by the Shiodome districtâs futuristic skyscrapers. This provides a great example of how Japan is the land of contrasts. The garden was originally built as a feudal lord's Tokyo residence and duck hunting grounds during the Edo Period, but later served as a strolling garden and as an Imperial detached palace before eventually being opened to the public in its current form.\n\nAfter lunch at a local restaurant, you will visit the Meiji Shrine. Dedicated to the Emperor Meiji, the father of modern Japan, the beautiful shrine stands in a dense forest glade of some 120,000 trees of 365 different species, at the very heart of Tokyo. The setting symbolizes the separation of the spiritual from the worldly. You enter the shrine through twin 40-feet tall Torii gates, one of the largest in all Japan. This shrine is a popular place for traditional Japanese weddings, if you are lucky, you might get see one.\n\nContinue to your hotel for check-in. The remainder of the day is at your leisure with dinner on your own.\n\nNOTE: In general, hotel rooms in Japan are smaller than hotel rooms elsewhere around the world. Per Japanese culture, standard typical bedding is two twin beds. Although every effort will be made to obtain rooms with one bed for couples, this cannot be guaranteed. Should you require two beds, kindly make sure to advise this when booking your program.\n\nDAY 2\n\nFollowing breakfast at the hotel, depart on a half-day tour of the city.\n\nVisit the Tokyo National Museum established 1872, it is one of the oldest museums in Japan. The Museum Collection comprises art and archaeological objects of Asia, focusing on Japan. There are a total of approximately 120,000 objects of which 89 are National Treasures and 649 Important Cultural Properties.\n\nContinue to the Ginza area, one of the most luxurious shopping districts in the world. The streets in Ginza are lined with numerous departments stores, boutiques, restaurants, and bars. Upon arrival you will enjoy some free time to browse, shop or perhaps visit some of the free galleries.\n\nYou can choose to either remain in Ginza and make your own way back to the hotel or return with the group.\n\nThe remainder of the day is at your leisure with lunch and dinner on your own.\n\nDAY 3\n\nFollowing breakfast at the hotel, you will begin yet another half-day tour of Tokyo, allowing you to see the city from a different perspective.\n\nYou will first journey to the Asakusa area â part of Tokyoâs Old Town. Visit the Asakusa Senso-ji Temple, which was founded in the early 7th century. Weather permitting, you will enter through a gate decorated with a huge red paper lantern to view the shrine. The architecture is stunning, as this temple is the countryâs oldest and one of the most revered. One of the highlights is a walk down Nakamise-dori, known as the âStreet of Inside Shops,â an alley lined with vendors selling traditional food, souvenirs, and handmade crafts.\n\nStop for photos at the Imperial Palace Plaza (no interior visit), where Japanâs Emperor and Empress reside. Surrounded by a moat, the palace was formerly known as Edo Castle, and samurai warriors lived there in the 17th through 19th centuries. In the large plaza in front of the palace, you can view the famed Nijubashiâtwo bridges that form an entrance to the inner palace grounds. The stone bridge in front is called Meganebashi (Eyeglass Bridge) for its looks.\n\nYou can choose to either remain in the area and make your own way back to the hotel or return with the group.\n\nThe remainder of the day is at your leisure with lunch and dinner on your own.\n\nDAY 4\n\nEnjoy one last breakfast at your hotel before checking out and transferring to either the Narita or the Haneda International Airports.
