        "text": "NEW YORK, March 25, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- SiriusXM announced today a new selection of artist branded channels with Bob Marley and LL COOL J available as streaming channels on the SiriusXM app. Each major artist is supplementing their existing SiriusXM channel with new channels that will further explore that artist's genre and will dive deeper into different themes that are important to the artists and their fans.\n\nThe new artist branded channels launching today are part of a 26-channel addition to the SiriusXM streaming lineup. These new channels will reflect sounds devoted to the 90s and 2000s--a listener-favorite music period, with lifestyle themes, moods, and celebratory, good vibes including Lithium Stripped, Classic Chill, Queens of Pop, 90s R&B Jams, Boy Bands and more.

The new streaming channels came about due to the popularity of Tuff Gong Radio's weekly show, Soca Afrobeats Mix, which debuted last December. The two new streaming channels will be spotlighting the best in Soca and Afrobeats music.\n\nLL COOL J previously launched LL COOL J's Rock The Bells Radio in March 2018, featuring a wide range of classic Hip Hop content, music, interviews and in-depth retrospectives. LL now dives deeper into the Rock The Bells world with three new streaming music channels that explore: B-Sides, exclusive mixes, and clean versions of classic Hip Hop songs. The channel logos for LL COOL J's new SiriusXM streaming channels were created by the acclaimed and influential American contemporary street artist, Shepard Fairey, famous for creating the iconic Barack Obama \"Hope\" poster during the 2008 presidential campaign. Shepard Fairey had previously created the logo for LL COOL J's Rock The Bells Radio.\n\nAt the top of the year, SiriusXM launched artist-branded music streaming channels with Armin van Buuren and Steve Aoki, and earlier this month, renowned guitarist Tom Morello launched three new streaming channels, a weekly show, and weekly podcast (more info HERE).\n\nTo find a full list and tune in to all new streaming music channels visit: www.siriusxm.com/streaming-channels.\n\nNew artist branded streaming music channels:\n\nBob Marley's Tuff Beats: The fusion of jazz with the traditional drum beats and melodies of West Africa initially pioneered by Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti has been reimagined by a new generation.
