        "text": "Part of an interview Iranian journalist and Ahmad Talebi-Nejad, Iranian documentary critic, director, and writer, about the evolution of Iranian cinema over the past 40 years. March 7, 2024 Part 2 ********** Ideological and governmental cinema in Iran is not a sustainable cinema. Ideological art is not sustainable art in Iran either. It makes no difference whether the ideology is heavenly or earthly. In my opinion, ideological art is like a balloon. It may inflate quickly, but it also bursts quickly with a pinprick. On the other hand, genuine art is like a soccer ball with multiple layers. It doesn't burst no matter how much you kick it. The Soviet Union has collapsed, and the only filmmakers from that period whose names are still mentioned are Tarkovsky and then Parajanov. This is because they made their own films in a time when everyone was making films that the government wanted. They used to say, \"In an Islamic film, at least two rak'ahs of prayer must be recited.\" However, this is not necessary and is a form of hypocrisy. Is there any prayer in the film \"Where Is the Friend's House?\" directed by Abbas Kiarostami? This film talks about an inherent human concept: helping others, companionship, and empathy. This is an eternal and timeless topic that has nothing to do with ideology. In my opinion, it doesn't even have anything to do with cultural and political geography. \"Where Is the Friend's House?\" is understood all over the world. If Asghar Farhadi's first film won an Oscar, apart from the behind-the-scenes talk and jokes, it was because it talked about an eternal and timeless concept. In the film \"A Separation\" directed by Asghar Farhadi, two people who live under the same roof have nothing in common, and it is the child who is crushed in the middle. This is a topic that Americans, Europeans, Indians, Bangladeshis, and everyone else can understand. I said all this to say that ideological art is brainwashing, but its effect is temporary, not permanent. If we bring the example of ideological art into cinema, how much does this lead us towards a single-genre cinema (not in the sense that we only have one genre, because ideology is not a genre) and a single-axis cinema? Because people don't want to see that content, they go and watch comedy films. This means that today we only have two choices: films that are made with a specific focus and comedy films of any kind. #Censorship #cinema #film #movie #iran #art #artist #Theater #Totalitarianism #Ideologicalgovernment #Religion #freedom #democracy #pluralism #Reviewer #literature #Culture #people #power #Limitation #Tyranny #Dictatorship #festival\n\nInterview The Pertinence of Impertinent Storytelling in Gilbert Ndahayo's Documentary Rwanda: Beyond the Deadly Pit Alexandre Dauge-Roth Pages 455-460 | Published online: 24 Nov 2010 Cite this article https://lnkd.in/dER_MgcC Alexandre Dauge-Roth: Your film Rwanda: Beyond the Deadly Pit (2010) represents a unique attempt to capture several seismic shifts that are both personal and collective. First there is the seism of the genocide of the Tutsis that took place in 1994, the death of your family, and your struggle with survival. Then a personal seism occurred when you engaged in filmmaking to negotiate the haunting legacy of the genocide and its ongoing aftermath. This crucial shift allowed you to craft your individual voice, a voice that is independent from some of the official accounts of genocide that you did not recognize. Finally, there is the seismic moment when you confront the killers of your family during a gacaca and reflect on the current reunification process. In order to address these seismic moments at the heart and genealogy of Beyond the Deadly Pit‚Äîwhose first version was entitled Behind this Convent‚ÄîI would like to start with a proverb. When asked about the role cinema plays in your life, you often refer to the following Rwandan proverb: ‚Äúujya gukira indwara arabanza akayirata‚Äù (if one wants to be healed from his or her sickness, he or she must talk about it to the world). Could you comment on this sickness and the role filmmaking plays for you as you seek to bear witness to the past and, simultaneously, assert that you are not totally defined by it within the present?\n\nSuccess Can Incite Envy, Just As Honesty Can Lead To Vulnerability: When I started the Australian Television Archive, I had two clear goals: 1) To provide an archive video preservation and digitisation service primarily for broadcast clients & content holders, ensuring they are preserved in a digital format. 2) To create a separate archive research and footage supply service where production houses and the general film and television industry could have research conducted and access archive content for their own projects. Despite my efforts to differentiate these two divisions, a persistent rumor suggests that they are intertwined, asserting that the archive's content comes from previously digitized projects. In essence, it insinuates that we are selling and licensing materials obtained from digitisation projects. Misunderstandings like this can innocently spread or be actively promoted by certain individuals. It's disheartening when you learn certain individuals actively spread this and warn potential clients avoid our services due to this misinformation, disregarding the evidence to the contrary. I've always aimed for transparency and honesty, even putting my name and face alongside my work. But, as I've learned being honest can also make you a target! In the grand scheme, success can incite envy, just as honesty can lead to vulnerability. Yet, challenges offer opportunities for growth. Staying authentic, confronting rumors, and standing firm are all principal values I subscribe to. Let's champion authenticity, dispel rumors, and uphold our values. How have you approached misinformation in your professional life? I'm eager to hear your thoughts and experiences‚Äîshare in the comments below! #ArchiveAmbitions #EmbraceAuthenticity #NavigateChallenges #ProfessionalValues #ExchangeExperiences\n\nBuzzing Paradox A Symphony of Mosquitoes and Humanity Introduction: This short film is born from a deeply personal moment. As I watched TV, a mosquito landed on me, prompting me to switch on the electric shock lamp. In that moment, I felt relief as the familiar zap echoed, taking the mosquito's life. This ordinary encounter left me pondering the fragility of life and the interconnectedness of all beings. The mosquito, a creature that has existed for centuries, was simply trying to feed itself, yet it became an inconvenience to me. This prompted me to reflect on the state of our world, where we strive for sustainability by using recycled materials like paper straws and eco-friendly packaging. But what about the gases and guns that disrupt life and harm the environment? As we are troubled by the sound of buzzing, how can we endure the cries of war, the echoing of gunshots, and the tears of children caught in the crossfire? This is what I call the \"Buzzing Paradox: A Symphony of Mosquitoes and Humanity.\" It is a journey into the profound complexities of our world and our place within it.

This was achieved by 10 hours at the desk on NYE and the time-saving and innovative inclusion of Instagram posts rather than an extra 8+ hours of picture editing with copyright citation on all photographic images. Last week I went back and did the exhaustive colour-editing in ASH style and now am content to share the post. Majiye gave a good appraisal, astonished on how I remembered it all. Using your #Instagram posts as a think tank and chronology allows some of your copy to write itself. As I revert to my usual focus and ASH special projects, it is great to know that 2023 laid a strong foundation for Majiye - and his USC student crew's - filmmaking activities this year and next. I will continue to support Majiye as a Producer and look forward to the blog contents blazing a trail for him and enlightening those considering funding future productions. The blog was also designed to inspire investment in the young talent emerging from Africa to lead industrial and economic leaps forward before 2050, the year that the continent will be home to 1/4 of the world's population; a young generation of social changemakers. I Am More Dangerous Dead is a visionary film that has shared awareness of the issues of resource exploitation, big oil operations and the indomitable resilience of the unrepresented #Ogoni people and their fight for #justice around the world. Across film festivals and climate change activities, it is packing a potent punch against #ecocide, for climate justice and supporting global movements. As the British Associate Producer of ‚ÄòI Am More Dangerous Dead‚Äô, the role engaged many of the skills, duties and responsibilities honed over years of managing projects and programmes in other industries. Managing UK and EU film production has been the ultimate project. I was able to deploy subject matter expertise in Communications, Public Relations and Sustainability and pivot skills including leadership, performance monitoring and outreach strategy to engage media and institutional stakeholders, program climate action collaborations and bespoke screening events and strategise film festival submissions that resulted in selections and award wins. Bespoke activist screening added value to the legal cases and human rights work of #MOSOP and grassroots climate action group Fossil Free London. #filmmakers #filmmaking #blogging #blogger #write #writer #champion #talent #support #creatives #invest #people #develop #industry #hollywood #visionary #climateaction https://lnkd.in/eQ7Vxk9D\n\nüá©üá™5 German documentaries for beginners: 1.\"Die Nordsee von oben\" (The North Sea from Above): Description: This documentary provides stunning aerial views of the North Sea, showcasing the beauty of the coastal landscapes, islands, and wildlife.
