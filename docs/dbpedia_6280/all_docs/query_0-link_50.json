        "text": "How sustainable and just is the present leap into the green new world? Join us for a panel discussion on how the decarbonization of the economy also intensifies the extraction of minerals in the global South and global North. This event will provide background to understand the global and local politics of the “green transformation” and explore its political ecology.\n\nABF Huset (Per Albin) Sveavägen 41, Stockholm — Wednesday 16 November 2022 — 18.00-20.00. Speakers: Martín Arboleda, Berta Flaquer, and Arne Müller.\n\nWe have three guests: MARTÌN ARBOLEDA Assistant Professor in Sociology at Universidad Diego Portales in Santiago de Chile and acclaimed author of the book Planetary Mine (2020, Verso Books). He will provide a background to capitalism’s extractive logic drawing on his case studies from Chile and Latin America and its connection to Chinese urbanization and the 4th industrial revolution, including artificial intelligence. BERTA FLAQUER an Architect graduated from BarcelonaTECH and PhD student in Urban Studies at Luleå University of Technology (LTU) will develop how critical mapping and ecofeminist lenses can help to understand how extraction and urbanization processes are interlinked. This is based on her ongoing PhD thesis on Territories of Extraction: Urbanization as Socionatures Reproduction, a thesis that revises the history of colonial extraction as situated in Swedish Sápmi from the mid 1500s to the present. Our third and final guest is ARNE MÜLLER, Swedish journalist and author of “Elbilen och jakten på mineralerna”/The electric car and the hunt for minerals (2019, Ord&visor). He will speak from his decades-long experience of covering mineral extraction in Europe and Sweden. Moderator and host will be HENRIK ERNSTSON, docent in Political Ecology at the Environmental Science Department at KTH (aka SEED).\n\nThe event will be held in English but questions can be posed in Swedish. We will start the event with some coffee and tea. After the event we will suggest a bar close-by to continue the discussion for those interested. We hope our event can contribute in forming networks among civil society, concerned citizens, and researchers. No entry fees and no need to let us know if you are coming, just show up at the door.\n\nOrganised by Henrik Ernstson, Associate Prof at KTH and Pontus Klasman Gustafsson, KTH.\n\nThe event is part of The Situated Ecologies Platform with financial support from funds held by Henrik Ernstson at the Environmental Science Department at KTH (aka SEED). The event is organized in conjunction with another event at Stockholm University that we recommend that you also check out: Archives of the Planetary Mine at Stockholm University, 14-15 November 2022 with three public keynote lectures on extraction (at campus and online) by Paula Serafini (Queen Mary, University of London), Martín Arboleda (Diego Portales University), and Jeff Diamanti (University of Amsterdam).
