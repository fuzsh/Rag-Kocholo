        "text": "Multimedia content management in MPEG-21 framework\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSmith, John R.\n\n2002-07-01\n\nMPEG-21 is an emerging standard from MPEG that specifies a framework for transactions of multimedia content. MPEG-21 defines the fundamental concept known as a digital item, which is the unit of transaction in the multimedia framework. A digital item can be used to package content for such as a digital photograph, a video clip or movie, a musical recording with graphics and liner notes, a photo album, and so on. The packaging of the media resources, corresponding identifiers, and associated metadata is provided in the declaration of the digital item. The digital item declaration allows for more effective transaction, distribution, and management of multimedia content and corresponding metadata, rights expressions, variations of media resources. In this paper, we describe various challenges for multimedia content management in the MPEG-21 framework.\n\nNoise level and MPEG-2 encoder statistics\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLee, Jungwoo\n\n1997-01-01\n\nMost software in the movie and broadcasting industries are still in analog film or tape format, which typically contains random noise that originated from film, CCD camera, and tape recording. The performance of the MPEG-2 encoder may be significantly degraded by the noise. It is also affected by the scene type that includes spatial and temporal activity. The statistical property of noise originating from camera and tape player is analyzed and the models for the two types of noise are developed. The relationship between the noise, the scene type, and encoder statistics of a number of MPEG-2 parameters such as motion vector magnitude, prediction error, and quant scale are discussed. This analysis is intended to be a tool for designing robust MPEG encoding algorithms such as preprocessing and rate control.\n\nDevelopment of the Plasma Movie Database System for JT-60\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSueoka, M.; Kawamata, Y.; Kurihara, K.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nA plasma movie is generally expected as one of the most efficient methods to know what plasma discharge has been conducted in the experiment. On this motivation we have developed and operated a real-time plasma shape visualization system over ten years. The current plasma movie is composed of (1) video camera picture looking at a plasma, (2) computer graphic (CG) picture, and (3) magnetic probe signal as a sound channel. (1) The plasma video movie is provided by a standard video camera, equipped at the viewing port of the vacuum vessel looking at a plasma poloidal cross section. (2) A plasma shape CG movie is provided by the plasma shape visualization system, which calculates the plasma shape in real-time using the CCS method [Kurihara, K., Fusion Engineering and Design, 51-52, 1049 (2000)]. Thirty snap-shot pictures per second are drawn by the graphic processor. (3) A sound in the movie is a raw signal of magnetic pick up coil. This sound reflects plasma rotation frequency which shows smooth high tone sound seems to mean a good plasma. In order to use this movie efficiently, we have developed a new system having the following functions: (a) To store a plasma movie in the movie database system automatically combined with the plasma shape CG and the sound according to a discharge sequence. (b) To make a plasma movie be available (downloadable) for experiment data analyses at the Web-site. The plasma movie capture system receives the timing signal according to the JT-60 discharge sequence, and starts to record a plasma movie automatically. The movie is stored in a format of MPEG2 in the RAID-disk. In addition, the plasma movie capture system transfers a movie file in a MPEG4 format to the plasma movie web-server at the same time. In response to the user's request the plasma movie web-server transfers a stored movie data immediately. The movie data amount for the MPEG2 format is about 50 Mbyte/shot (65 s discharge), and that for the MPEG4 format is about 7 Mbyte\n\nFundamental study of compression for movie files of coronary angiography\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAndo, Takekazu; Tsuchiya, Yuichiro; Kodera, Yoshie\n\n2005-04-01\n\nWhen network distribution of movie files was considered as reference, it could be useful that the lossy compression movie files which has small file size. We chouse three kinds of coronary stricture movies with different moving speed as an examination object; heart rate of slow, normal and fast movies. The movies of MPEG-1, DivX5.11, WMV9 (Windows Media Video 9), and WMV9-VCM (Windows Media Video 9-Video Compression Manager) were made from three kinds of AVI format movies with different moving speeds. Five kinds of movies that are four kinds of compression movies and non-compression AVI instead of the DICOM format were evaluated by Thurstone's method. The Evaluation factors of movies were determined as \"sharpness, granularity, contrast, and comprehensive evaluation.\" In the virtual bradycardia movie, AVI was the best evaluation at all evaluation factors except the granularity. In the virtual normal movie, an excellent compression technique is different in all evaluation factors. In the virtual tachycardia movie, MPEG-1 was the best evaluation at all evaluation factors expects the contrast. There is a good compression form depending on the speed of movies because of the difference of compression algorithm. It is thought that it is an influence by the difference of the compression between frames. The compression algorithm for movie has the compression between the frames and the intra-frame compression. As the compression algorithm give the different influence to image by each compression method, it is necessary to examine the relation of the compression algorithm and our results.\n\nDistributed multimedia database technologies supported by MPEG-7 and MPEG-21\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nKosch, Harald\n\n2003-01-01\n\n15 Introduction Multimedia Content: Context Multimedia Systems and Databases (Multi)Media Data and Multimedia Metadata Purpose and Organization of the Book MPEG-7: The Multimedia Content Description Standard Introduction MPEG-7 and Multimedia Database Systems Principles for Creating MPEG-7 Documents MPEG-7 Description Definition Language Step-by-Step Approach for Creating an MPEG-7 Document Extending the Description Schema of MPEG-7 Encoding and Decoding of MPEG-7 Documents for Delivery-Binary Format for MPEG-7 Audio Part of MPEG-7 MPEG-7 Supporting Tools and Referen\n\nComputed Quality Assessment of MPEG4-compressed DICOM Video Data.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFrankewitsch, Thomas; SÃ¶hnlein, Sven; MÃ¼ller, Marcel; Prokosch, Hans-Ulrich\n\n2005-01-01\n\nDigital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) has become one of the most popular standards in medicine. This standard specifies the exact procedures in which digital images are exchanged between devices, either using a network or storage medium. Sources for images vary; therefore there exist definitions for the exchange for CR, CT, NMR, angiography, sonography and so on. With its spreading, with the increasing amount of sources included, data volume is increasing, too. This affects storage and traffic. While for long-time storage data compression is generally not accepted at the moment, there are many situations where data compression is possible: Telemedicine for educational purposes (e.g. students at home using low speed internet connections), presentations with standard-resolution video projectors, or even the supply on wards combined receiving written findings. DICOM comprises compression: for still image there is JPEG, for video MPEG-2 is adopted. Within the last years MPEG-2 has been evolved to MPEG-4, which squeezes data even better, but the risk of significant errors increases, too. Within the last years effects of compression have been analyzed for entertainment movies, but these are not comparable to videos of physical examinations (e.g. echocardiography). In medical videos an individual image plays a more important role. Erroneous single images affect total quality even more. Additionally, the effect of compression can not be generalized from one test series to all videos. The result depends strongly on the source. Some investigations have been presented, where different MPEG-4 algorithms compressed videos have been compared and rated manually. But they describe only the results in an elected testbed. In this paper some methods derived from video rating are presented and discussed for an automatically created quality control for the compression of medical videos, primary stored in DICOM containers.\n\nExtreme compression for extreme conditions: pilot study to identify optimal compression of CT images using MPEG-4 video compression.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPeterson, P Gabriel; Pak, Sung K; Nguyen, Binh; Jacobs, Genevieve; Folio, Les\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThis study aims to evaluate the utility of compressed computed tomography (CT) studies (to expedite transmission) using Motion Pictures Experts Group, Layer 4 (MPEG-4) movie formatting in combat hospitals when guiding major treatment regimens. This retrospective analysis was approved by Walter Reed Army Medical Center institutional review board with a waiver for the informed consent requirement. Twenty-five CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis exams were converted from Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine to MPEG-4 movie format at various compression ratios. Three board-certified radiologists reviewed various levels of compression on emergent CT findings on 25 combat casualties and compared with the interpretation of the original series. A Universal Trauma Window was selected at -200 HU level and 1,500 HU width, then compressed at three lossy levels. Sensitivities and specificities for each reviewer were calculated along with 95 % confidence intervals using the method of general estimating equations. The compression ratios compared were 171:1, 86:1, and 41:1 with combined sensitivities of 90 % (95 % confidence interval, 79-95), 94 % (87-97), and 100 % (93-100), respectively. Combined specificities were 100 % (85-100), 100 % (85-100), and 96 % (78-99), respectively. The introduction of CT in combat hospitals with increasing detectors and image data in recent military operations has increased the need for effective teleradiology; mandating compression technology. Image compression is currently used to transmit images from combat hospital to tertiary care centers with subspecialists and our study demonstrates MPEG-4 technology as a reasonable means of achieving such compression.\n\nMPEG-4 IPMP Extension for Interoperable Protection of Multimedia Content\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nZeng Wenjun\n\n2004-01-01\n\nFull Text Available To ensure secure content delivery, the Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG has dedicated significant effort to the digital rights management (DRM issues. MPEG is now moving from defining only hooks to proprietary systems (e.g., in MPEG-2, MPEG-4 Version 1 to specifying a more encompassing standard in intellectual property management and protection (IPMP. MPEG feels that this is necessary in order to achieve MPEG's most important goal: interoperability. The design of the IPMP Extension framework also considers the complexity of the MPEG-4 standard and the diversity of its applications. This architecture leaves the details of the design of IPMP tools in the hands of applications developers, while ensuring the maximum flexibility and security. This paper first briefly describes the background of the development of the MPEG-4 IPMP Extension. It then presents an overview of the MPEG-4 IPMP Extension, including its architecture, the flexible protection signaling, and the secure messaging framework for the communication between the terminal and the tools. Two sample usage scenarios are also provided to illustrate how an MPEG-4 IPMP Extension compliant system works.\n\nUsing UPPAAL to Analyze an MPEG-2 Algorithm\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nCambronero, M. Emilia; Ravn, Anders Peter; Valero, Valentin\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe performance of a parallel algorithm for an MPEG-2 encoding is analyzed using timed automata models in the UppAal tool. We have constructed both a sequential model of MPEG-2, and a parallel model of MPEG-2 and then, a comparison of the results obtained for both models is made. We show how...\n\nThe H.264/MPEG4 advanced video coding\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGromek, Artur\n\n2009-06-01\n\nH.264/MPEG4-AVC is the newest video coding standard recommended by International Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication Standardization Section (ITU-T) and the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Expert Group (MPEG). The H.264/MPEG4-AVC has recently become leading standard for generic audiovisual services, since deployment for digital television. Nowadays is commonly used in wide range of video application ranging like mobile services, videoconferencing, IPTV, HDTV, video storage and many more. In this article, author briefly describes the technology applied in the H.264/MPEG4-AVC video coding standard, the way of real-time implementation and the way of future development.\n\nMPEG2 video parameter and no reference PSNR estimation\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nLi, Huiying; Forchhammer, SÃ¸ren\n\n2009-01-01\n\nMPEG coded video may be processed for quality assessment or postprocessed to reduce coding artifacts or transcoded. Utilizing information about the MPEG stream may be useful for these tasks.

Since the information relevant to the partitioning process can be extracted directly from the MPEG compressed stream, higher efficiency can be achieved utilizing information from the MPEG compressed domain. This paper introduces a real-time algorithm for scene change detection that analyses the statistics of the macroblock features extracted directly from the MPEG stream. A method for extraction of the continuous frame difference that transforms the 3D video stream into a 1D curve is presented. This transform is then further employed to extract temporal units within the analysed video sequence. Results of computer simulations are reported.\n\nCurrent status of the MPEG-4 standardization effort\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAnastassiou, Dimitris\n\n1994-09-01\n\nThe Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) of the International Standardization Organization has initiated a standardization effort, known as MPEG-4, addressing generic audiovisual coding at very low bit-rates (up to 64 kbits/s) with applications in videotelephony, mobile audiovisual communications, video database retrieval, computer games, video over Internet, remote sensing, etc. This paper gives a survey of the status of MPEG-4, including its planned schedule, and initial ideas about requirements and applications. A significant part of this paper is summarizing an incomplete draft version of a `requirements document' which presents specifications of desirable features on the video, audio, and system level of the forthcoming standard. Very low bit-rate coding algorithms are not described, because no endorsement of any particular algorithm, or class of algorithms, has yet been made by MPEG-4, and several seminars held concurrently with MPEG-4 meetings have not so far provided evidence that such high performance coding schemes are achievable.\n\nThe HST/WFC3 Quicklook Project: A User Interface to Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 Data\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBourque, Matthew; Bajaj, Varun; Bowers, Ariel; Dulude, Michael; Durbin, Meredith; Gosmeyer, Catherine; Gunning, Heather; Khandrika, Harish; Martlin, Catherine; Sunnquist, Ben; Viana, Alex\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument, comprised of two detectors, UVIS (Ultraviolet-Visible) and IR (Infrared), has been acquiring ~ 50-100 images daily since its installation in 2009. The WFC3 Quicklook project provides a means for instrument analysts to store, calibrate, monitor, and interact with these data through the various Quicklook systems: (1) a ~ 175 TB filesystem, which stores the entire WFC3 archive on disk, (2) a MySQL database, which stores image header data, (3) a Python-based automation platform, which currently executes 22 unique calibration/monitoring scripts, (4) a Python-based code library, which provides system functionality such as logging, downloading tools, database connection objects, and filesystem management, and (5) a Python/Flask-based web interface to the Quicklook system. The Quicklook project has enabled large-scale WFC3 analyses and calibrations, such as the monitoring of the health and stability of the WFC3 instrument, the measurement of ~ 20 million WFC3/UVIS Point Spread Functions (PSFs), the creation of WFC3/IR persistence calibration products, and many others.\n\nOptimization of MPEG decoding\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nMartins, Bo; Forchhammer, SÃ¸ren\n\n1999-01-01\n\nMPEG-2 video decoding is examined. A unified approach to quality improvement, chrominance upsampling, de-interlacing and superresolution is presented.

The result over the past 15 years has been a substantial increase in the type of information and change in the way humans generate, classify, store, search, access and consume information. Conversion of information to digital form is a prerequisite for this enhanced machine role, but must be done having in mind requirements such as compactness, fidelity, interpretability etc.Â This book provides an overview of the basic technology and mechanisms underpinning the operation of MPEG standards. It is a valuable reference for those making decisions in products and services based on digital media, those with general background, engaged in studies or developments of MPEG-related implementations, and those curious about MPEG and its role in the development of successful, standard technologies. Offers an overview of whatâs behind MP3, dig...\n\nA real-time MPEG software decoder using a portable message-passing library\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKwong, Man Kam; Tang, P.T. Peter; Lin, Biquan\n\n1995-12-31\n\nWe present a real-time MPEG software decoder that uses message-passing libraries such as MPL, p4 and MPI. The parallel MPEG decoder currently runs on the IBM SP system but can be easil ported to other parallel machines. This paper discusses our parallel MPEG decoding algorithm as well as the parallel programming environment under which it uses. Several technical issues are discussed, including balancing of decoding speed, memory limitation, 1/0 capacities, and optimization of MPEG decoding components. This project shows that a real-time portable software MPEG decoder is feasible in a general-purpose parallel machine.\n\nMPEG-4 AVC saliency map computation\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAmmar, M.; Mitrea, M.; Hasnaoui, M.\n\n2014-02-01\n\nA saliency map provides information about the regions inside some visual content (image, video, ...) at which a human observer will spontaneously look at. For saliency maps computation, current research studies consider the uncompressed (pixel) representation of the visual content and extract various types of information (intensity, color, orientation, motion energy) which are then fusioned. This paper goes one step further and computes the saliency map directly from the MPEG-4 AVC stream syntax elements with minimal decoding operations. In this respect, an a-priori in-depth study on the MPEG-4 AVC syntax elements is first carried out so as to identify the entities appealing the visual attention. Secondly, the MPEG-4 AVC reference software is completed with software tools allowing the parsing of these elements and their subsequent usage in objective benchmarking experiments. This way, it is demonstrated that an MPEG-4 saliency map can be given by a combination of static saliency and motion maps. This saliency map is experimentally validated under a robust watermarking framework. When included in an m-QIM (multiple symbols Quantization Index Modulation) insertion method, PSNR average gains of 2.43 dB, 2.15dB, and 2.37 dB are obtained for data payload of 10, 20 and 30 watermarked blocks per I frame, i.e. about 30, 60, and 90 bits/second, respectively. These quantitative results are obtained out of processing 2 hours of heterogeneous video content.\n\nTESS Data Processing and Quick-look Pipeline\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFausnaugh, Michael; Huang, Xu; Glidden, Ana; Guerrero, Natalia; TESS Science Office\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe describe the data analysis procedures and pipelines for the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We briefly review the processing pipeline developed and implemented by the Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC) at NASA Ames, including pixel/full-frame image calibration, photometric analysis, pre-search data conditioning, transiting planet search, and data validation. We also describe data-quality diagnostic analyses and photometric performance assessment tests. Finally, we detail a \"quick-look pipeline\" (QLP) that has been developed by the MIT branch of the TESS Science Office (TSO) to provide a fast and adaptable routine to search for planet candidates in the 30 minute full-frame images.\n\nVOP memory management in MPEG-4\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVaithianathan, Karthikeyan; Panchanathan, Sethuraman\n\n2001-03-01\n\nMPEG-4 is a multimedia standard that requires Video Object Planes (VOPs). Generation of VOPs for any kind of video sequence is still a challenging problem that largely remains unsolved. Nevertheless, if this problem is treated by imposing certain constraints, solutions for specific application domains can be found. MPEG-4 applications in mobile devices is one such domain where the opposite goals namely low power and high throughput are required to be met. Efficient memory management plays a major role in reducing the power consumption. Specifically, efficient memory management for VOPs is difficult because the lifetimes of these objects vary and these life times may be overlapping. Varying life times of the objects requires dynamic memory management where memory fragmentation is a key problem that needs to be addressed. In general, memory management systems address this problem by following a combination of strategy, policy and mechanism. For MPEG4 based mobile devices that lack instruction processors, a hardware based memory management solution is necessary. In MPEG4 based mobile devices that have a RISC processor, using a Real time operating system (RTOS) for this memory management task is not expected to be efficient because the strategies and policies used by the ROTS is often tuned for handling memory segments of smaller sizes compared to object sizes. Hence, a memory management scheme specifically tuned for VOPs is important. In this paper, different strategies, policies and mechanisms for memory management are considered and an efficient combination is proposed for the case of VOP memory management along with a hardware architecture, which can handle the proposed combination.\n\nMPEG-4 interactive image transmission on mobile thin clients\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJoveski, B.; Mitrea, M.; Pr\"teux, F.\n\n2010-05-01\n\nThe main issue in this paper is to deploy a compressing algorithm for heterogeneous content (text, graphics, image and video) with low-complex decoding. Such an algorithm will be involved in the remote display core problem for mobile thin clients: it allows the graphical content, computed on a remote server, to be displayer on the user's thin terminal, even when the network constraints (bandwidth, errors) are very strict. The paper is structured into three parts. First, a client-server architecture is presented. On the server side, the graphical content is parsed, converted and binary encoded into the MPEG 4 (BiFS, LASeR) format. This content is further streamed to the terminal, where it is played into a simple MPEG player. Secondly, this architecture is considered as a test bed for MPEG 4 performance assessment for various types of content (image, graphics, text). The quantitative results were focussed on bandwidth requirements and quality of experience. Finally, the conclusions are structured as a reference benchmarking of the MPEG (BiFS, LASeR) and outside (VNC) mobile remote display potential solutions.\n\nAn experimental digital consumer recorder for MPEG-coded video signals\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nSaeijs, R.W.J.J.; With, de P.H.N.; Rijckaert, A.M.A.; Wong, C.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThe concept and real-time implementation of an experimental home-use digital recorder is presented, capable of recording MPEG-compressed video signals. The system has small recording mechanics based on the DVC standard and it uses MPEG compression for trick-mode signals as well\n\nComparative assessment of H.265/MPEG-HEVC, VP9, and H.264/MPEG-AVC encoders for low-delay video applications\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGrois, Dan; Marpe, Detlev; Nguyen, Tung; Hadar, Ofer\n\n2014-09-01\n\nThe popularity of low-delay video applications dramatically increased over the last years due to a rising demand for realtime video content (such as video conferencing or video surveillance), and also due to the increasing availability of relatively inexpensive heterogeneous devices (such as smartphones and tablets). To this end, this work presents a comparative assessment of the two latest video coding standards: H.265/MPEG-HEVC (High-Efficiency Video Coding), H.264/MPEG-AVC (Advanced Video Coding), and also of the VP9 proprietary video coding scheme. For evaluating H.264/MPEG-AVC, an open-source x264 encoder was selected, which has a multi-pass encoding mode, similarly to VP9. According to experimental results, which were obtained by using similar low-delay configurations for all three examined representative encoders, it was observed that H.265/MPEG-HEVC provides significant average bit-rate savings of 32.5%, and 40.8%, relative to VP9 and x264 for the 1-pass encoding, and average bit-rate savings of 32.6%, and 42.2% for the 2-pass encoding, respectively. On the other hand, compared to the x264 encoder, typical low-delay encoding times of the VP9 encoder, are about 2,000 times higher for the 1-pass encoding, and are about 400 times higher for the 2-pass encoding.\n\nMPEG-7 based video annotation and browsing\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHoeynck, Michael; Auweiler, Thorsten; Wellhausen, Jens\n\n2003-11-01\n\nThe huge amount of multimedia data produced worldwide requires annotation in order to enable universal content access and to provide content-based search-and-retrieval functionalities. Since manual video annotation can be time consuming, automatic annotation systems are required. We review recent approaches to content-based indexing and annotation of videos for different kind of sports and describe our approach to automatic annotation of equestrian sports videos. We especially concentrate on MPEG-7 based feature extraction and content description, where we apply different visual descriptors for cut detection. Further, we extract the temporal positions of single obstacles on the course by analyzing MPEG-7 edge information. Having determined single shot positions as well as the visual highlights, the information is jointly stored with meta-textual information in an MPEG-7 description scheme. Based on this information, we generate content summaries which can be utilized in a user-interface in order to provide content-based access to the video stream, but further for media browsing on a streaming server.\n\nSynthesis of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Modified with MPEG-PEI via Photochemistry as New MRI Contrast Agent\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYancong Zhang\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Novel method for synthesis of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs coated with polyethylenimine (PEI and modified with poly(ethylene glycol methyl ether (MPEG, MPEG-PEI-SPIONs, was developed. PEI-SPIONs were successfully prepared in aqueous system via photochemistry, and their surface was modified with poly(ethylene glycol methyl ether (MPEG. The so-obtained MPEG-PEI-SPIONs had a uniform hydrodynamic particle size of 34ânm. The successful coating of MPEG-PEI on the SPIONs was ascertained from FT-IR analysis, and the PEI and MPEG fractions in MPEG-PEI-SPIONs were calculated to account for 31% and 12%, respectively. Magnetic measurement revealed that the saturated magnetization of MPEG-PEI-SPIONs reached 46âemu/g and the nanoparticles showed the characteristic of being superparamagnetic. The stability experiment revealed that the MPEG-PEI modification improved the nanoparticles stability greatly. T2 relaxation measurements showed that MPEG-PEI-SPIONs show similar R2 value to the PEI-SPIONs. The T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI of MPEG-PEI-SPIONs showed that the magnetic resonance signal was enhanced significantly with increasing nanoparticle concentration in water. These results indicated that the MPEG-PEI-SPIONs had great potential for application in MRI.\n\nMPEG-2 Compressed-Domain Algorithms for Video Analysis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHesseler Wolfgang\n\n2006-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper presents new algorithms for extracting metadata from video sequences in the MPEG-2 compressed domain. Three algorithms for efficient low-level metadata extraction in preprocessing stages are described. The first algorithm detects camera motion using the motion vector field of an MPEG-2 video. The second method extends the idea of motion detection to a limited region of interest, yielding an efficient algorithm to track objects inside video sequences. The third algorithm performs a cut detection using macroblock types and motion vectors.\n\nNo-reference analysis of decoded MPEG images for PSNR estimation and post-processing\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nForchhammer, SÃ¸ren; Li, Huiying; Andersen, Jakob Dahl\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWe propose no-reference analysis and processing of DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) coded images based on estimation of selected MPEG parameters from the decoded video. The goal is to assess MPEG video quality and perform post-processing without access to neither the original stream nor the code...... stream. Solutions are presented for MPEG-2 video. A method to estimate the quantization parameters of DCT coded images and MPEG I-frames at the macro-block level is presented. The results of this analysis is used for deblocking and deringing artifact reduction and no-reference PSNR estimation without...... code stream access. An adaptive deringing method using texture classification is presented. On the test set, the quantization parameters in MPEG-2 I-frames are estimated with an overall accuracy of 99.9% and the PSNR is estimated with an overall average error of 0.3dB. The deringing and deblocking...\n\nMPEG-4-based 2D facial animation for mobile devices\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRiegel, Thomas B.\n\n2005-03-01\n\nThe enormous spread of mobile computing devices (e.g. PDA, cellular phone, palmtop, etc.) emphasizes scalable applications, since users like to run their favorite programs on the terminal they operate at that moment. Therefore appliances are of interest, which can be adapted to the hardware realities without loosing a lot of their functionalities. A good example for this is \"Facial Animation,\" which offers an interesting way to achieve such \"scalability.\" By employing MPEG-4, which provides an own profile for facial animation, a solution for low power terminals including mobile phones is demonstrated. From the generic 3D MPEG-4 face a specific 2D head model is derived, which consists primarily of a portrait image superposed by a suited warping mesh and adapted 2D animation rules. Thus the animation process of MPEG-4 need not be changed and standard compliant facial animation parameters can be used to displace the vertices of the mesh and warp the underlying image accordingly.\n\nMPEG DASH SRD : Spatial Relationship Description\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nNiamut, O.A.; Thomas, E.D.R.; D'Acunto, L.; Concolato, C.; Denoual, F.; Yong Lim, S.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis paper presents the Spatial Representation Description (SRD)feature of the second amendment of MPEG DASH standard part 1, 23009-1:2014 [1].

The detection scheme was originally based on morphological directional neighborhood features extracted from mammographic regions of interest (ROIs). Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) was performed to evaluate the performance of each set of features independently and merged into a back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) using the leave-one-out sampling scheme (LOOSS). The study was based on a database of 668 mammographic ROIs (340 depicting cancer regions and 328 depicting normal parenchyma). Overall, the ROC area index of the BPANN using the directional morphological features was Az=0.85+/-0.01. The MPEG-7 edge histogram descriptor-based BPNN showed an ROC area index of Az=0.71+/-0.01 while homogeneous textural descriptors using 30 and 120 channels helped the BPNN achieve similar ROC area indexes of Az=0.882+/-0.02 and Az=0.877+/-0.01 respectively. After merging the MPEG-7 homogeneous textural features with the directional neighborhood features the performance of the BPANN increased providing an ROC area index of Az=0.91+/-0.01. MPEG-7 homogeneous textural descriptor significantly improved the morphology-based detection scheme.\n\nAdaptation of facial synthesis to parameter analysis in MPEG-4 visual communication\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYu, Lu; Zhang, Jingyu; Liu, Yunhai\n\n2000-12-01\n\nIn MPEG-4, Facial Definition Parameters (FDPs) and Facial Animation Parameters (FAPs) are defined to animate 1 a facial object. Most of the previous facial animation reconstruction systems were focused on synthesizing animation from manually or automatically generated FAPs but not the FAPs extracted from natural video scene. In this paper, an analysis-synthesis MPEG-4 visual communication system is established, in which facial animation is reconstructed from FAPs extracted from natural video scene.\n\nDevelopment of movie caption translation lecture site using MobileMotion{sub TM}; MobileMotion{sub TM} wo mochiita jimaku hon'yaku koza site no kaihatsu\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNONE\n\n2000-03-01\n\nThe site of Internet that performs the correspondence education for bringing up a movie caption translator was developed. Correspondence education that fully deepens understanding was obtained by distributing a motion picture using MPEG-4 distribution software (MobileMotion{sub TM}) and performing the learning based on bi-directional communication. HTML distribution and E-mail transmission and reception are done from Gaga Communications, and a MobileMotion{sub TM} file is distributed from the OnDemand Server of Toshiba.

The proposed scheme is applied directly in the domain of MPEG-1 system streams and MPEG-2 program streams (multiplexed streams. Perceptual models are used during the embedding process in order to avoid degradation of the video quality. The watermark is detected without the use of the original video sequence. A modified correlation-based detector is introduced that applies nonlinear preprocessing before correlation. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed scheme is able to withstand several common attacks. The resulting watermarking system is very fast and therefore suitable for copyright protection of compressed video.\n\nMovie Smoking, Movie Horror, and Urge to Smoke\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSARGENT, James D.; MARUSKA, Karin; MORGENSTERN, Matthis; ISENSEE, Barbara; HANEWINKEL, Reiner\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIt is known that exposure to smoking cues increases urge to smoke (UTS), but little is known about other media factors that might also increase UTS. We hypothesized that horror/thriller movies might also increase UTS by increasing negative affect. We surveyed 536 movie patrons who were smokers aged 18 years or older. Subjects had exited 26 movies, of which 12 contained smoking and two were horror films, one with and one without smoking. We used random effects regression to assess the association between exposure to movie smoking, movie horror, both and UTS, controlling for confounding factors. Median age was 26 years and 52% were female. Mean UTS was 5.9, 6.6, 6.6, and 8.7 for smokers exiting movies without smoking, with smoking, horror without smoking and horror with smoking respectively. Smoking in movies was associated with a significantly higher UTS (0.63 [95% CI 0.31â0.94]). Horror with smoking increased UTS by 2.8 points (95% C.I. 2.3, 3.5); the horror without smoking estimate was 0.88, but not statistically significant. This short report offers preliminary evidence that movie horror as one factor besides visual smoking cues that could increase UTS in a community setting.

The description infrastructure consists of an internal metadata model and access tool for using it. Based on an analysis of requirements, we have selected, out of a set of candidates, MPEG-7 as the basis of our metadata model. The openness and generality of MPEG-7 allow using it in broad range of applications, but increase complexity and hinder interoperability. Profiling has been proposed as a solution, with the focus on selecting and constraining description tools. Semantic constraints are currently only described in textual form. Conformance in terms of semantics can thus not be evaluated automatically and mappings between different profiles can only be defined manually. As a solution, we propose an approach to formalize the semantic constraints of an MPEG-7 profile using a formal vocabulary expressed in OWL, which allows automated processing of semantic constraints. We have defined the Detailed Audiovisual Profile as the profile to be used in our metadata model and we show how some of the semantic constraints of this profile can be formulated using ontologies. To work practically with the metadata model, we have implemented a MPEG-7 library and a client/server document access infrastructure.\n\nOnline Studies on Variation in Orthopedic Surgery: Computed Tomography in MPEG4 Versus DICOM Format.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMellema, Jos J; Mallee, Wouter H; Guitton, Thierry G; van Dijk, C Niek; Ring, David; Doornberg, Job N\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to compare the observer participation and satisfaction as well as interobserver reliability between two online platforms, Science of Variation Group (SOVG) and Traumaplatform Study Collaborative, for the evaluation of complex tibial plateau fractures using computed tomography in MPEG4 and DICOM format. A total of 143 observers started with the online evaluation of 15 complex tibial plateau fractures via either the SOVG or Traumaplatform Study Collaborative websites using MPEG4 videos or a DICOM viewer, respectively. Observers were asked to indicate the absence or presence of four tibial plateau fracture characteristics and to rate their satisfaction with the evaluation as provided by the respective online platforms. The observer participation rate was significantly higher in the SOVG (MPEG4 video) group compared to that in the Traumaplatform Study Collaborative (DICOM viewer) group (75 and 43%, respectively; PÂ video compared to six (range, 1-9) using DICOM viewer (PÂ =Â 0.11). The interobserver reliability for recognition of fracture characteristics in complex tibial plateau fractures was higher for the evaluation using MPEG4 video. In conclusion,Â observer participation and interobserver reliability for the characterization of tibial plateau fractures was greater with MPEG4 videos than with a standard DICOM viewer, while there was no difference in observer satisfaction. Future reliability studies should account for the method of delivering images.\n\n188Re labeled MPEG-modified superparamagnetic nanogels: preparation and preliminary application in mice\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSun Hanwen; Gong Peijun; Liu Xiuqing; Hong Jun; Xu Dongmei; Zhang Chunfu; Wang Yongxian; Yao Side\n\n2005-01-01\n\nSuperparamagnetic poly(acrylamide) magnetic nanogels produced via photochemical method have been developed. After Hoffmann degradation of carbonyl, the nanogels with amino groups, or poly(acrylamide-vinyl amine) magnetic nanogels, were also obtained. And the magnetic nanogels were further modified by methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (MPEG) for higher dispersibility and stability. The MPEG-modified magnetic nanogels were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), photo correlation spectroscopy (PCS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The MPEG-modified magnetic nanogels were labeled by 188 Re radiopharmaceuticals and intravenously injected into tails of mice in the presence and absence of a 0.5 T external magnetic field targeted on the bellies. The radioactivity distribution was monitored in vivo. In the absence of magnetic field, the radioactivity was mainly distributed in liver, spleen, kidney, stomach and lung. In the presence of the magnetic field, the radioactivity was mainly accumulated on the targeted point, verifying the magnetically targeted character.

P.; MacAlister, Charlotte; Philpot, William D.; Osorio Leyton, Javier M.; Steenhuis, Tammo S.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn many developing countries and remote areas of important ecosystems, good quality precipitation data are neither available nor readily accessible. Satellite observations and processing algorithms are being extensively used to produce satellite rainfall products (SREs). Nevertheless, these products are prone to systematic errors and need extensive validation before to be usable for streamflow simulations. In this study, we investigated and corrected the bias of Multi-Sensor Precipitation Estimate-Geostationary (MPEG) data. The corrected MPEG dataset was used as input to a semi-distributed hydrological model Hydrologiska ByrÃ¥ns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) for simulation of discharge of the Gilgel Abay and Gumara watersheds in the Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia. The result indicated that the MPEG satellite rainfall captured 81% and 78% of the gauged rainfall variability with a consistent bias of underestimating the gauged rainfall by 60%. A linear bias correction applied significantly reduced the bias while maintaining the coefficient of correlation. The simulated flow using bias corrected MPEG SRE resulted in a simulated flow comparable to the gauge rainfall for both watersheds. The study indicated the potential of MPEG SRE in water budget studies after applying a linear bias correction.\n\nSAMPEG: a scene-adaptive parallel MPEG-2 software encoder\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nFarin, D.S.; Mache, N.; With, de P.H.N.; Girod, B.; Bouman, C.A.; Steinbach, E.G.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThis paper presents a fully software-based MPEG-2 encoder architecture, which uses scene-change detection to optimize the Group-of-Picture (GOP) structure for the actual video sequence.

There is a vital need to annotate multimedia data in order to allow universal content access and to provide content-based search-and-retrieval functionalities. Since supervised video annotation can be time consuming, an automatic solution is appreciated. We review recent approaches to content-based indexing and annotation of videos for different kind of sports, and present our application for the automatic annotation of equestrian sports videos. Thereby, we especially concentrate on MPEG-7 based feature extraction and content description. We apply different visual descriptors for cut detection. Further, we extract the temporal positions of single obstacles on the course by analyzing MPEG-7 edge information and taking specific domain knowledge into account. Having determined single shot positions as well as the visual highlights, the information is jointly stored together with additional textual information in an MPEG-7 description scheme. Using this information, we generate content summaries which can be utilized in a user front-end in order to provide content-based access to the video stream, but further content-based queries and navigation on a video-on-demand streaming server.\n\nMovies in Chemistry Education\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPekdag, Bulent; Le Marechal, Jean-Francois\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis article reviews numerous studies on chemistry movies.

In this study, we developed methoxy poly(ethylene glycol-poly(caprolactone (MPEG-PCL micelles loaded with curcumin and doxorubicin (Cur-Dox/MPEG-PCL that were tolerated by recipient mice and had enhanced antitumor effects and fewer side effects. It was shown that these Cur-Dox/MPEG-PCL micelles could release curcumin and doxorubicin slowly in vitro. The long circulation time of MPEG-PCL micelles and the slow rate of release of curcumin and doxorubicin in vivo may help to maintain plasma concentrations of active drug. We also demonstrated that Cur-Dox/MPEG-PCL had improved antitumor effects both in vivo and in vitro. The mechanism by which Cur-Dox/MPEG-PCL micelles inhibit lung cancer might involve increased apoptosis of tumor cells and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. We found advantages using Cur-Dox/MPEG-PCL micelles in the treatment of cancer, with Cur-Dox/MPEG-PCL achieving better inhibition of LL/2 lung cancer growth in vivo and in vitro. Our study indicates that Cur-Dox/MPEG-PCL micelles may be an effective treatment strategy for cancer in the future.

Many such system require portability and wireless communication capabilities, and thus face severe limitations in size and power consumption. This places a premium on integration and efficiency, and favors software solutions for video functionality over specialized hardware. The processors in most embedded system currently lack the computational power needed to perform video decoding, but a related and equally important problem is the required data bandwidth, and the need to cost-effectively insure adequate data supply. MPEG data sets are very large, and generate significant amounts of excess memory traffic for standard data caches, up to 100 times the amount required for decoding. Meanwhile, cost and power limitations restrict cache sizes in embedded systems. Some systems, including many media processors, eliminate caches in favor of memories under direct, painstaking software control in the manner of digital signal processors. Yet MPEG data has locality which caches can exploit if properly optimized, providing fast, flexible, and automatic data supply. We propose a set of enhancements which target the specific needs of the heterogeneous types within the MPEG decoder working set. These optimizations significantly improve the efficiency of small caches, reducing cache-memory traffic by almost 70 percent, and can make an enhanced 4 KB cache perform better than a standard 1 MB cache. This performance improvement can enable high-resolution, full frame rate video playback in cheaper, smaller system than woudl otherwise be possible.\n\nBiodegradable mixed MPEG-SS-2SA/TPGS micelles for triggered intracellular release of paclitaxel and reversing multidrug resistance\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDong K\n\n2016-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Kai Dong,1 Yan Yan,2 Pengchong Wang,2 Xianpeng Shi,2 Lu Zhang,2 Ke Wang,2 Jianfeng Xing,2 Yalin Dong1 1Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiâan Jiaotong University, 2School of Pharmacy, Xiâan Jiaotong University, Xiâan, Shaanxi, Peopleâs Republic of China Abstract: In this study, a type of multifunctional mixed micelles were prepared by a novel biodegradable amphiphilic polymer (MPEG-SS-2SA and a multidrug resistance (MDR reversal agent (D-Î±-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate, TPGS. The mixed micelles could achieve rapid intracellular drug release and reversal of MDR. First, the amphiphilic polymer, MPEG-SS-2SA, was synthesized through disulfide bonds between poly (ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (MPEG and stearic acid (SA. The structure of the obtained polymer was similar to poly (ethylene glycol-phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE. Then the mixed micelles, MPEG-SS-2SA/TPGS, were prepared by MPEG-SS-2SA and TPGS through the thin film hydration method and loaded paclitaxel (PTX as the model drug. The in vitro release study revealed that the mixed micelles could rapidly release PTX within 24 h under a reductive environment because of the breaking of disulfide bonds. In cell experiments, the mixed micelles significantly inhibited the activity of mitochondrial respiratory complex II, also reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential, and the content of adenosine triphosphate, thus effectively inhibiting the efflux of PTX from cells. Moreover, in the confocal laser scanning microscopy, cellular uptake and 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assays, the MPEG-SS-2SA/TPGS micelles achieved faster release and more uptake of PTX in Michigan Cancer Foundation-7/PTX cells and showed better antitumor effects as compared with the insensitive control. In conclusion, the biodegradable mixed micelles, MPEG-SS-2SA/TPGS, could be potential vehicles for delivering hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drugs in\n\nVisual saliency in MPEG-4 AVC video stream\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAmmar, M.; Mitrea, M.; Hasnaoui, M.; Le Callet, P.\n\n2015-03-01\n\nVisual saliency maps already proved their efficiency in a large variety of image/video communication application fields, covering from selective compression and channel coding to watermarking. Such saliency maps are generally based on different visual characteristics (like color, intensity, orientation, motion,â¦) computed from the pixel representation of the visual content. This paper resumes and extends our previous work devoted to the definition of a saliency map solely extracted from the MPEG-4 AVC stream syntax elements. The MPEG-4 AVC saliency map thus defined is a fusion of static and dynamic map. The static saliency map is in its turn a combination of intensity, color and orientation features maps. Despite the particular way in which all these elementary maps are computed, the fusion techniques allowing their combination plays a critical role in the final result and makes the object of the proposed study. A total of 48 fusion formulas (6 for combining static features and, for each of them, 8 to combine static to dynamic features) are investigated. The performances of the obtained maps are evaluated on a public database organized at IRCCyN, by computing two objective metrics: the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the area under curve.\n\nEntry of the movie service Netflix into the Czech movie market\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nKawulok, Filip\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis thesis will focus on movie distribution via internet, especially on American movie service Netlix and its impact on recent entry to Czech movie market.

In order to decrease the XNJ-M-induced mucosal irritation, XNJ-M modified by mPEG2000-PLA (XNJ-MM) were prepared in a previous work. The present work aimed to assess the impact of mPEG2000-PLA on pharmacokinetic features and brain-targeting ability of XNJ-M. The bioavailability and brain-target effects of borneol and geniposide in XNJ-M and XNJ-MM were compared in mice after intravenous (i.v.) and intranasal (i.n.) administrations. Gas chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry methods were developed for the quantification of borneol and geniposide. Blood and brain samples were collected from mice at different time points after i.v. and i.n. treatments with borneol at 8.0âmg/kg, geniposide at 4.12âmg/kg. In addition, near-infrared fluorescence dye, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl indotricarbocyanine iodide was loaded into microemulsions to evaluate the brain-targeting ability of XNJ-M and XNJ-MM by near-infrared fluorescence imaging in vivo and ex vivo. For XNJ-M and XNJ-MM, the relative brain targeted coefficients (Re) were 134.59% and 198.09% (borneol), 89.70% and 188.33% (geniposide), respectively. Besides, significant near-infrared fluorescent signal was detected in the brain after i.n. administration of microemulsions, compared with that of groups for i.v. administration. These findings indicated that mPEG2000-PLA modified microemulsion improved drug entry into blood and brain compared with normal microemulsion: the introduction of mPEG2000-PLA in microemulsion resulted in brain-targeting enhancement of both fat-soluble and water-soluble drugs. These findings provide a basis for the significance of mPEG2000-PLA addition in microemulsion, defining its effects on the drugs in microemulsion.\n\nBinary Format for Scene (BIFS): combining MPEG-4 media to build rich multimedia services\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSignes, Julien\n\n1998-12-01\n\nIn this paper, we analyze the design concepts and some technical details behind the MPEG-4 standard, particularly the scene description layer, commonly known as the Binary Format for Scene (BIFS).

By their nature, movies or animations are particularly useful for highlighting key features by offering a 'guided tour' of structures and conformation changes. However, high-quality movies are rarely seen because they are currently difficult and time consuming to make. By adopting the traditional movie 'storyboard' concept, which gives guidance and direction to filming, eMovie makes the creation of lengthy molecular animations much easier. This tool is a plug-in for the open-source molecular graphics program PyMOL, and enables experts and novices alike to produce informative and high-quality molecular animations.\n\nMPEG-4 solutions for virtualizing RDP-based applications\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJoveski, Bojan; Mitrea, Mihai; Ganji, Rama-Rao\n\n2014-02-01\n\nThe present paper provides the proof-of-concepts for the use of the MPEG-4 multimedia scene representations (BiFS and LASeR) as a virtualization tool for RDP-based applications (e.g. MS Windows applications). Two main applicative benefits are thus granted. First, any legacy application can be virtualized without additional programming effort. Second, heterogeneous mobile devices (different manufacturers, OS) can collaboratively enjoy full multimedia experiences. From the methodological point of view, the main novelty consists in (1) designing an architecture allowing the conversion of the RDP content into a semantic multimedia scene-graph and its subsequent rendering on the client and (2) providing the underlying scene graph management and interactivity tools. Experiments consider 5 users and two RDP applications (MS Word and Internet Explorer), and benchmark our solution against two state-of-the-art technologies (VNC and FreeRDP). The visual quality is evaluated by six objective measures (e.g. PSNRVNC by a factor 1.8 while being 2 times heavier then the FreeRDP; (2) for Internet browsing, the MPEG solutions outperform both VNC and FreeRDP by factors of 1.9 and 1.5, respectively. The average round-trip times (less than 40ms) cope with real-time application constraints.\n\nDeterministic Adoption in Movie Industry\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nCh'ng, Kean Siang; Lean, Hooi Hooi\n\n2007-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we investigate the decision making process by movie goers.

In addition, we examined whether positive and negative movie alcohol portrayals affect transportation into and attitude toward the movie. A within-subject design was used in which participants were exposed to 8 different movie clips containing alcohol (positive or negative context) or no alcohol portrayals in a controlled laboratory setting. A total of 159 college students (84 males and 75 females) ages 18 to 30 participated in the experiment. Transportation and attitude toward the movie were measured after each movie clip. Participants were more transported into and had a more positive attitude toward movie clips with alcohol portrayals compared to the same movie clips with no alcohol portrayal. In addition, participants were more transported into movie clips with negative alcohol (NA) portrayals compared to clips with positive alcohol (PA) portrayals. For attitude toward the movie, opposite results were found. Participants had a more positive attitudes toward clips with PA portrayals compared to clips with NA portrayals.

In order to avoid the drift drawbacks, two classes of solutions are currently considered in the literature. They try either to compensate the drift distortions at the expense of complex decoding/estimation algorithms or to restrict the insertion to the blocks which are not involved in the prediction, thus reducing the data payload. The present study follows a different approach. First, it algebraically models the drift distortion spread problem by considering the analytic expressions of the MPEG-4 AVC encoding operations. Secondly, it solves the underlying algebraic system under drift-free constraints. Finally, the advanced solution is adapted to take into account the watermarking peculiarities. The experiments consider an m-QIM semi-fragile watermarking method and a video surveillance corpus of 80 minutes. For prescribed data payload (100 bit/s), robustness (BER < 0.1 against transcoding at 50% in stream size), fragility (frame modification detection with accuracies of 1/81 from the frame size and 3s) and complexity constraints, the modified insertion results in gains in transparency of 2 dB in PSNR, of 0.4 in AAD, of 0.002 in IF, of 0.03 in SC, of 0.017 NCC and 22 in DVQ.\n\nMovie Popularity Classification based on Inherent Movie Attributes using C4.5, PART and Correlation Coefficient\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nIbnal Asad, Khalid; Ahmed, Tanvir; Rahman, Md. Saiedur\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAbundance of movie data across the internet makes it an obvious candidate for machine learning and knowledge discovery. But most researches are directed towards bi-polar classification of movie or generation of a movie recommendation system based on reviews given by viewers on various internet...... sites. Classification of movie popularity based solely on attributes of a movie i.e. actor, actress, director rating, language, country and budget etc. has been less highlighted due to large number of attributes that are associated with each movie and their differences in dimensions. In this paper, we...... propose classification scheme of pre-release movie popularity based on inherent attributes using C4.S and PART classifier algorithm and define the relation between attributes of post release movies using correlation coefficient....\n\nMPEG-1 low-cost encoder solution\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGrueger, Klaus; Schirrmeister, Frank; Filor, Lutz; von Reventlow, Christian; Schneider, Ulrich; Mueller, Gerriet; Sefzik, Nicolai; Fiedrich, Sven\n\n1995-02-01\n\nA solution for real-time compression of digital YCRCB video data to an MPEG-1 video data stream has been developed. As an additional option, motion JPEG and video telephone streams (H.261) can be generated. For MPEG-1, up to two bidirectional predicted images are supported. The required computational power for motion estimation and DCT/IDCT, memory size and memory bandwidth have been the main challenges. The design uses fast-page-mode memory accesses and requires only one single 80 ns EDO-DRAM with 256 X 16 organization for video encoding. This can be achieved only by using adequate access and coding strategies. The architecture consists of an input processing and filter unit, a memory interface, a motion estimation unit, a motion compensation unit, a DCT unit, a quantization control, a VLC unit and a bus interface. For using the available memory bandwidth by the processing tasks, a fixed schedule for memory accesses has been applied, that can be interrupted for asynchronous events. The motion estimation unit implements a highly sophisticated hierarchical search strategy based on block matching. The DCT unit uses a separated fast-DCT flowgraph realized by a switchable hardware unit for both DCT and IDCT operation. By appropriate multiplexing, only one multiplier is required for: DCT, quantization, inverse quantization, and IDCT. The VLC unit generates the video-stream up to the video sequence layer and is directly coupled with an intelligent bus-interface. Thus, the assembly of video, audio and system data can easily be performed by the host computer. Having a relatively low complexity and only small requirements for DRAM circuits, the developed solution can be applied to low-cost encoding products for consumer electronics.\n\nPreparation and characterization of PVDF separators for lithium ion cells using hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene grafted methoxyl polyethylene glycol (HTPB-g-MPEG) as additive\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLi, Hao; Niu, Dong-Hui; Zhou, Hui; Chao, Chun-Ying; Wu, Li-Jun; Han, Pei-Lin\n\n2018-05-01\n\nHydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene grafted methoxyl polyethylene glycol (HTPB-g-MPEG) with different arm length were synthesized by grafting methoxyl poly(ethylene glycol)s (MPEGs, Mn = 350, 750, 1900 and 5000, respectively) to the hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) molecule using isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) as the coupling agent, and blended with PVDF to fabricate porous separators via phase inversion process. By measuring the composition, morphology and ion conductivity etc., the influence of HTPB-g-MPEG on structure and property of blend separators were discussed. Compared with pure PVDF separator with comparable porous structure, the adoption of HTPB-g-MPEG could not only decrease the crystallinity, but also enhance the stability of entrapped liquid electrolyte and corresponding ion conductivity. The cells assembled with such separators showed good initial discharge capacity and cyclic stability.\n\nNew Complexity Scalable MPEG Encoding Techniques for Mobile Applications\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nStephan Mietens\n\n2004-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Complexity scalability offers the advantage of one-time design of video applications for a large product family, including mobile devices, without the need of redesigning the applications on the algorithmic level to meet the requirements of the different products. In this paper, we present complexity scalable MPEG encoding having core modules with modifications for scalability. The interdependencies of the scalable modules and the system performance are evaluated. Experimental results show scalability giving a smooth change in complexity and corresponding video quality. Scalability is basically achieved by varying the number of computed DCT coefficients and the number of evaluated motion vectors but other modules are designed such they scale with the previous parameters. In the experiments using the ÃâÃâStefanÃâÃâ sequence, the elapsed execution time of the scalable encoder, reflecting the computational complexity, can be gradually reduced to roughly 50% of its original execution time. The video quality scales between 20 dB and 48 dB PSNR with unity quantizer setting, and between 21.5 dB and 38.5 dB PSNR for different sequences targeting 1500 kbps. The implemented encoder and the scalability techniques can be successfully applied in mobile systems based on MPEG video compression.\n\nA novel method for efficient archiving and retrieval of biomedical images using MPEG-7\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMeyer, Joerg; Pahwa, Ash\n\n2004-10-01\n\nDigital archiving and efficient retrieval of radiological scans have become critical steps in contemporary medical diagnostics. Since more and more images and image sequences (single scans or video) from various modalities (CT/MRI/PET/digital X-ray) are now available in digital formats (e.g., DICOM-3), hospitals and radiology clinics need to implement efficient protocols capable of managing the enormous amounts of data generated daily in a typical clinical routine. We present a method that appears to be a viable way to eliminate the tedious step of manually annotating image and video material for database indexing. MPEG-7 is a new framework that standardizes the way images are characterized in terms of color, shape, and other abstract, content-related criteria. A set of standardized descriptors that are automatically generated from an image is used to compare an image to other images in a database, and to compute the distance between two images for a given application domain. Text-based database queries can be replaced with image-based queries using MPEG-7. Consequently, image queries can be conducted without any prior knowledge of the keys that were used as indices in the database. Since the decoding and matching steps are not part of the MPEG-7 standard, this method also enables searches that were not planned by the time the keys were generated.\n\nSearching for Movies\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nBogers, Toine\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDespite a surge in popularity of work on casual leisure search, some leisure domains are still relatively underrepresented.

This is achieved by extracting and pooling features from a NR image quality assessment method used frame by frame. We also present methods to identify the video coding...... and estimate the video coding parameters for MPEG-2 and H.264/AVC which can be used to improve the VQA. The analysis differs from most other video coding analysis methods since it is without access to the bitstream. The results show that our proposed method is competitive with other recent NR VQA methods...\n\nMPEG-V bridging the virtual and real world\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nYoon, Kyoungro; Han, Jae Joon; Han, Seungju; Preda, Marius\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis book is the first to cover the recently developed MPEG-V standard, explaining the fundamentals of each part of the technology and exploring potential applications.

It is a concept often applied to the question of realism of virtual environments. However, it is equally applicable to the act of watching a movie. A movie provides a markedly different visual environment to that given by the natural worldâparticularly because of frequent edits. And yet, the audience in a movie achieves high levels of presence. We investigate the relationship between presence and the optical and temporal parameters of movies. We find effects of mean shot length, colour/b&w, and 3D/2D. We find that short shots, while being unnatural, are associated with high levels of presence. We consider why such artificial stimuli should appear so real and immersive.\n\nFeasibility study of a real-time operating system for a multichannel MPEG-4 encoder\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLehtoranta, Olli; Hamalainen, Timo D.\n\n2005-03-01\n\nFeasibility of DSP/BIOS real-time operating system for a multi-channel MPEG-4 encoder is studied. Performances of two MPEG-4 encoder implementations with and without the operating system are compared in terms of encoding frame rate and memory requirements. The effects of task switching frequency and number of parallel video channels to the encoding frame rate are measured. The research is carried out on a 200 MHz TMS320C6201 fixed point DSP using QCIF (176x144 pixels) video format. Compared to a traditional DSP implementation without an operating system, inclusion of DSP/BIOS reduces total system throughput only by 1 QCIF frames/s. The operating system has 6 KB data memory overhead and program memory requirement of 15.7 KB. Hence, the overhead is considered low enough for resource critical mobile video applications.\n\nMPEG-compliant joint source/channel coding using discrete cosine transform and substream scheduling for visual communication over packet networks\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKim, Seong-Whan; Suthaharan, Shan; Lee, Heung-Kyu; Rao, K. R.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nQuality of Service (QoS)-guarantee in real-time communication for multimedia applications is significantly important. An architectural framework for multimedia networks based on substreams or flows is effectively exploited for combining source and channel coding for multimedia data. But the existing frame by frame approach which includes Moving Pictures Expert Group (MPEG) cannot be neglected because it is a standard. In this paper, first, we designed an MPEG transcoder which converts an MPEG coded stream into variable rate packet sequences to be used for our joint source/channel coding (JSCC) scheme. Second, we designed a classification scheme to partition the packet stream into multiple substreams which have their own QoS requirements. Finally, we designed a management (reservation and scheduling) scheme for substreams to support better perceptual video quality such as the bound of end-to-end jitter. We have shown that our JSCC scheme is better than two other two popular techniques by simulation and real video experiments on the TCP/IP environment.\n\nFast mode decision algorithm in MPEG-2 to H.264/AVC transcoding including group of picture structure conversion\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLee, Kangjun; Jeon, Gwanggil; Jeong, Jechang\n\n2009-05-01\n\nThe H.264/AVC baseline profile is used in many applications, including digital multimedia broadcasting, Internet protocol television, and storage devices, while the MPEG-2 main profile is widely used in applications, such as high-definition television and digital versatile disks. The MPEG-2 main profile supports B pictures for bidirectional motion prediction. Therefore, transcoding the MPEG-2 main profile to the H.264/AVC baseline is necessary for universal multimedia access. In the cascaded pixel domain transcoder architecture, the calculation of the rate distortion cost as part of the mode decision process in the H.264/AVC encoder requires extremely complex computations. To reduce the complexity inherent in the implementation of a real-time transcoder, we propose a fast mode decision algorithm based on complexity information from the reference region that is used for motion compensation. In this study, an adaptive mode decision process was used based on the modes assigned to the reference regions. Simulation results indicated that a significant reduction in complexity was achieved without significant degradation of video quality.\n\nDiabetes Movie (For Parents)\n\nMedline Plus\n\nFull Text Available ...

Such contests increased the popularity of the new medium of film by engaging local audiences in the process of filmmaking, including fans as scriptwriters and even stars. They helped to transform film into a dominant cultural practice by creating local spaces for film patrons to become part of the national pastime of going to the show. They did so by appealing directly to female spectators, who both legitimized going to the movies and created dynamic film fan communities.\n\nMapping of MPEG-4 decoding on a flexible architecture platform\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nvan der Tol, Erik B.; Jaspers, Egbert G.\n\n2001-12-01\n\nIn the field of consumer electronics, the advent of new features such as Internet, games, video conferencing, and mobile communication has triggered the convergence of television and computers technologies. This requires a generic media-processing platform that enables simultaneous execution of very diverse tasks such as high-throughput stream-oriented data processing and highly data-dependent irregular processing with complex control flows. As a representative application, this paper presents the mapping of a Main Visual profile MPEG-4 for High-Definition (HD) video onto a flexible architecture platform. A stepwise approach is taken, going from the decoder application toward an implementation proposal. First, the application is decomposed into separate tasks with self-contained functionality, clear interfaces, and distinct characteristics. Next, a hardware-software partitioning is derived by analyzing the characteristics of each task such as the amount of inherent parallelism, the throughput requirements, the complexity of control processing, and the reuse potential over different applications and different systems. Finally, a feasible implementation is proposed that includes amongst others a very-long-instruction-word (VLIW) media processor, one or more RISC processors, and some dedicated processors. The mapping study of the MPEG-4 decoder proves the flexibility and extensibility of the media-processing platform. This platform enables an effective HW/SW co-design yielding a high performance density.\n\nMovies and Literary Elements.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKeller, Rodney D.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nRecommends using movie clips to stimulate students' interest in reading a novel as well as to teach elements of fiction such as plot, character, setting, symbol, irony, and theme.

J.; Sanz, C.; JuÃ¡rez, E.; Samper, D.; Antoniello, R.\n\n2007-05-01\n\nInternet Protocol Set-Top Boxes (IP STBs) based on single-processor architectures have been recently introduced in the market. In this paper, the implementation of an MPEG-4 SP/ASP video decoder for a multi-format IP STB based on a TMS320DM641 DSP is presented. An initial decoder for PC platform was fully tested and ported to the DSP. Using this code an optimization process was started achieving a 90% speedup. This process allows real-time MPEG-4 SP/ASP decoding. The MPEG-4 decoder has been integrated in an IP STB and tested in a real environment using DVD movies and TV channels with excellent results.\n\nExperimental Study of Concealment Data in Video Sequences MPEG-2\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA. A. Alimov\n\n2011-03-01\n\nFull Text Available MPEG-2 uses video compression with loses based on the use of discrete cosine transformation (DCT to small blocks of encoded image. As a result, there is range of factors, each of which corresponds to a frequency index of the encoded block. The human eye, due to natural approximation, does not perceive the difference when the high-frequency DCT coefficients change. The investigated algorithm uses this feature of the human vision to embed required data in video stream invisibly.\n\nOccult Phenomena in Sherlock Holmes the Movie\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nNAMAZCARRA, CHRIESHER\n\n2014-01-01\n\nKeywords: Occult phenomena, Sherlock Holmes, movie.

ROMOT represents the next generation of movie theatres, where scenes are enhanced with multimodal content, also allowing audience interaction. ROMOT is highly versatile as it can support different setups, integrated hardware and content and, thus, it can be easily adapted to different groups and purposes. Regarding the setups, currently, ROMOT supports a traditional movie setup (including first-person movies, a mixed reality environment, a virtual reality interactive environment, and an augmented reality mirror-based scene. Regarding the integrated hardware, the system currently integrates a variety of devices and displays that allow audiences to see, hear, smell, touch, and feel the movement, all synchronized with the film experience. Finally, regarding to content, here we theorize about the use of ROMOT for romantic-related interactive movies. Though the work presented in this sense is rather speculative, it might open new avenues of research and for the film and other creative industries.\n\nMadness at the movies: prioritised movies for self-directed learning by medical students.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWilson, Nick; Heath, Deb; Heath, Tim; Gallagher, Peter; Huthwaite, Mark\n\n2014-10-01\n\nWe aimed to systematically compile a list of 10 movies to facilitate self-directed learning in psychiatry by medical students. The selected areas were those of the top five mental health conditions from the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study. The search strategy for movies covered an extensive range of sources (published literature and websites), followed by closer examination and critical viewing of a sample. Out of a total of 503 potential movies that were identified, 23 were selected for viewing and more detailed critique. The final top 10 were: for depressive and anxiety disorders: Ordinary People (1980), Silver Linings Playbook (2012); for illicit drug use: Trainspotting (1996), Winter's Bone (2010), Rachel Getting Married (2008), Half Nelson (2006); for alcohol use disorders: Another Year (2010), Passion Fish (1992); and for schizophrenia: The Devil and Daniel Johnston (2006), and An Angel at My Table (1990). The final selection of 10 movies all appeared to have relatively high entertainment value together with rich content in terms of psychiatric themes. Further research could evaluate the extent to which medical students actually watch such movies, by assessing the level of withdrawals from a medical school library and surveying student responses.

It is especially critical to maintain the Quality of Service (QoS standards. Existing multimedia streaming services have been studied to guarantee QoS on the receiving side. QoS has not been ensured due to the fact that the loss of streaming data to be transmitted has not been considered in network conditions. With an algorithm that considers the QoS and can reduce the overhead of the network, it will be possible to reduce the transmission error and wastage of communication network resources. In this paper, we propose a scheme that improves the reliability of multimedia transmissions by using an adaptive algorithm that switches between UDP (User Datagram Protocol and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol based on the size of the data. In addition, we present a method that retransmits essential portions of the multimedia data, thus improving transmission efficiency. We simulate an MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group stream service and evaluate the performance of the proposed adaptive MPEG stream service.\n\nPostprocessing MPEG based on estimated quantization parameters\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nForchhammer, SÃ¸ren\n\n2009-01-01\n\nthe case where the coded stream is not accessible, or from an architectural point of view not desirable to use, and instead estimate some of the MPEG stream parameters based on the decoded sequence.

This article presents a systematic review of the evidence on the nature and effect of smoking in the movies on adolescents (and others). We performed a comprehensive literature review. We identified 40 studies. Smoking in the movies decreased from 1950 to approximately 1990 and then increased rapidly. In 2002, smoking in movies was as common as it was in 1950. Movies rarely depict the negative health outcomes associated with smoking and contribute to increased perceptions of smoking prevalence and the benefits of smoking. Movie smoking is presented as adult behavior. Exposure to movie smoking makes viewers' attitudes and beliefs about smoking and smokers more favorable and has a dose-response relationship with adolescent smoking behavior. Parental restrictions on R-rated movies significantly reduces youth exposure to movie smoking and subsequent smoking uptake. Beginning in 2002, the total amount of smoking in movies was greater in youth-rated (G/PG/PG-13) films than adult-rated (R) films, significantly increasing adolescent exposure to movie smoking. Viewing antismoking advertisements before viewing movie smoking seems to blunt the stimulating effects of movie smoking on adolescent smoking. Strong empirical evidence indicates that smoking in movies increases adolescent smoking initiation. Amending the movie-rating system to rate movies containing smoking as \"R\" should reduce adolescent exposure to smoking and subsequent smoking.\n\nSocial media for movie lovers\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nNguyen, Hieu\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe main objective of this thesis project is to develop a basic social media application which targets a specific group of users â movie lovers.

Always, it will influence the box office directly. However, the public rating has strong bias depended on the types of movies, release time, and ages and background of the audiences. To fix the bias and give a movie a fair judgement is an important problem. In the paper, we focus on the movie scores on Douban, which is one of the most famous Chinese movie network community. We decompose the movie scores into two parts. One is the basis scores based on the basic properties of movies. The other is the extra scores which represent the excess value of the movies. We use the word-embedding technique to reduce the movies in a small dense subspace. Then, in the reduced subspace, we use the k-means method to offer the similar movies a basis scores.\n\nSurface modification of MPEG-b-PCL-based nanoparticles via oxidative self-polymerization of dopamine for malignant melanoma therapy\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nXiong W\n\n2015-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Wei Xiong,1,2 Lixia Peng,1,2 Hongbo Chen,3 Qin Li1,2 1Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 2Department of Plastic Surgery, General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command of PLA, Guangzhou, Peopleâs Republic ofÂ China; 3Division of Life Sciences and Health, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, Peopleâs Republic of China Abstract: To enhance the therapeutic effects of chemotherapy on malignant melanoma, paclitaxel (PTX-loaded methoxy poly(ethylene glycol-b-poly(Îµ-caprolactone nanoparticles (MPEG-b-PCL NPs that had their surfaces modified with polydopamine (PTX-loaded MPEG-b-PCL NPs@PDA were prepared as drug vehicles. The block copolymer MPEG-b-PCL was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization and characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography. The PTX-loaded NPs were prepared by a modified nanoprecipitation technique. The PTX-loaded NPs and PTX-loaded NPs@PDA were characterized in terms of size and size distribution, zeta potential, surface morphology, drug encapsulation efficiency, and drug release. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that coumarin-6-loaded NPs@PDA could be internalized by human melanoma cell line A875Â cells. The cellular uptake efficiency of NPs was greatly enhanced after PDA modification. The antitumor efficacy of the PTX-loaded NPs@PDA was investigated in vitro by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT assay and in vivo by a xenograft tumor model. The PTX-loaded NPs@PDA could significantly inhibit tumor growth compared to TaxolÂ® and precursor PTX-loaded NPs. All the results suggested that the PTX-loaded MPEG-b-PCL NPs that had their surfaces modified with PDA are promising nanocarriers for malignant melanoma therapy.
