As a leading producer of Silane gas, REC Silicon’s Signature Silane® is the material of choice from memory processes to lithium-ion battery production, as well as thin film deposition uses like flat panel displays.\n\nSignature Silane® is also REC Silicon’s core feedstock for its own specialty gases and silicon materials product lines.\n\nOur specialty silicon gases are used in the manufacturing processes of flat panel displays, semiconductors (in legacy and advance node applications) and solar cells.\n\nOur EG products are used in motor control and power conversion processes for hybrid and electric vehicles, wind energy, high voltage transmission, 5G communications, IoT (internet of things), big data, processors, and micro electromechanical (MEMS).\n\nOur flowable polysilicon is used in the manufacturing of solar ingots and wafers. Wafers are made into solar cells, and then solar panels.\n\ninvestor resources\n\nFinancial Calendar 2024 Q4 2023 February 8, 2024 Annual Report March 21, 2024 Q1 2024 May 10, 2024 AGM May 14, 2024 Q2 2024 August 8, 2024 Q3 2024 November 7, 2024\n\ntechnology\n\nAn established history of technological leadership.\n\nAt the core of REC Silicon’s technology is our molecule, SiH4, and the safe, sustainable best practices to produce it. Whether our technology is designed and engineered in-house, like our Fluidized Bed Reactor (FBR) technology, or progressively improved, like our Siemens Reactor technology, continuously improving and reducing costs, energy consumption, and our environmental footprint is the right thing to do.\n\nConnect with our sales team to discuss which products are right for your needs.\n\nGeneral\n\nNotice is hereby given of an extraordinary general meeting of REC Silicon ASA (REC) to be held as a digital meeting on 2 May 2022 at 1300 CET.\n\nReceive updates from us\n\nTo receive news from REC Silicon, please subscribe to our press releases by filling in your details.\n\nBuild a Career With Us\n\nOpportunities to Learn and Grow.\n\nCompany growth and ever-changing, fast-paced industries provide unparalleled opportunities for professional learning and growth.\n\ngeneral resources\n\nResources for the Public"
