He grew up on the family dairy farm and attended Lakeside Country School and graduated from Isle High School in 1957.

Jerry was employed with Mesaba Iron Works and spent many years tracking and stocking inventory at the Wabegon. Jerry enjoyed his daily walks to the Fond du Lac Campground where he left a lasting impression on numerous guests. He also enjoyed his peony gardens, feeding the birds, spending time with his great grandchildren, and conversations over a cup of coffee.
