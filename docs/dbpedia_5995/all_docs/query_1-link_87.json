        "text": "Patrick T. Breen earned his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from The Ohio State University in 1963, where he achieved membership in the Phi Zeta honor society, setting the stage for a distinguished career in veterinary medicine, dermatology, and allergy. His impact on the field has been far-reaching, encompassing clinical practice, education, entrepreneurship, and collaborative research efforts.\n\nIn 1974, Breen became one of the 13 charter Diplomates and founding members of the American College of Veterinary Dermatology, which marked the inception of Specialty Board Certification in veterinary dermatology. His involvement in establishing this organization laid the foundation for the worldwide advancement of the specialty. That same year, Breen became a consultant at the renowned New York Animal Medical Center. In 1981, he served as the American Academy of Veterinary Dermatology President. These roles allowed him to contribute to the broader veterinary community and gain recognition for his expertise.\n\nBreen's dedication to the profession was recognized by his appointment by the Governor of Ohio to the Ohio Veterinary Medical Board in 1975. His service as President and Treasurer in this capacity demonstrated his commitment to advancing veterinary medicine at a regulatory level. In 1982, he received the prestigious American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) Practitioner Award for Region III, underscoring his excellence in clinical practice.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1992, Breen served as an instructor and held the position of Assistant Clinical Professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, working directly with the internationally renowned dermatologist, Leon Goldman, MD, in comparative dermatology and learning the application of the CO2 laser.\n\nBreen became the first dermatologist in the country to own and use a CO2 laser in his clinical practices. He contributed to the first inclusion of Lasers in Dermatology in CURRENT VETERINARY THERAPY X by Robert W. Kirk, DVM, in 1988. He also did postgraduate work and served as an Associate in Dermatology at the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThrough his commitment to academia and comparative medical education, he shared his expertise with fellow veterinarians, residents, and students alike, lecturing nationally and internationally and helping to shape future generations of primary care veterinarians in veterinary dermatology.\n\nThe hallmark of Breen’s career has been in the clinical practice of veterinary medicine and dermatology from his private practice in Cincinnati, OH, where he continues caring for dermatologic and allergic patients across the entire tri-state area. However, Breen also previously established long-term satellite practices in Cleveland and Columbus, OH, Lexington, and Louisville, KY; Indianapolis, IN; Charleston, SC; Savannah, GA; and Jacksonville, FL, where there was no veterinary dermatologist available at that time. In addition, he has served as a special consultant in dermatology at several of the largest equine stud farms in Kentucky and The Cincinnati Zoo.\n\nBreen expanded his reach and impact nationwide by establishing DermaPath Consulting Service and Allergy Consulting Service, allowing him to share his expertise and knowledge with primary care practitioners across the United States. These consulting services continue to be instrumental in advancing dermatological care for animals.\n\nBreen’s most notable scientific contribution to veterinary medicine was his clinical recognition and published documentation of the dermatological condition, sebaceous adenitis (SA). SA is generally considered not to exist clinically prior to the publication by RosserE, Dunstan R, BreenP et al: “Sebaceous adenitis with hyperkeratosis in the standard poodle: a discussion of 10 cases.” JAAHA, 1987; 23: p341. Breen is a founding member of the Genodermatosis Research Foundation, Inc.\n\nIn 2014, Breen approached Lynette K. Cole, DVM, MS, DACVD, the section head of dermatology at Ohio State’s College of Veterinary Medicine, to discuss how he could give back to his alma mater. Recognizing the need to support the research endeavors of aspiring veterinary dermatologists, he established the Patrick T. Breen Dermatology Residents Research Fund. This fund has provided invaluable resources to support the growth of the dermatology program at the college.\n\nBreen has remained engaged with the college, sharing his expertise and insights with the veterinary dermatology team biannually. Additionally, he continues to support the program through shared consults on veterinary dermatology patients and contributions to the research fund.\n\nA true pioneer in comparative dermatology, Breen has actively participated in One Health initiatives throughout his career. His collaborations with institutions like the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Proctor & Gamble, Delmont Laboratories, and membership in The Cincinnati Dermatology Society exemplify his commitment to interdisciplinary research.\n\nTim Kolb, a 1982 graduate of The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine, has made remarkable contributions to the veterinary profession. Over the years, Kolb has demonstrated a deep commitment to animal and human well-being, leaving a lasting impact on the field.\n\nKolb's career includes owning and operating the highly successful Northwest Animal Hospital for 31 years, where he provided exceptional care to countless animals and built lasting relationships with their owners. In addition to Northwest Animal Hospital, in 2001, Kolb opened a Charter Hospital with Banfield Pet Hospital and continues to practice there. He has also supported his alma mater, serving on various committees and boards within Ohio State’s College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nHe currently serves as Treasurer for the American Association of Veterinary State Boards (AAVSB). He has been an active member of the Ohio Veterinary Medical Licensing Board (OVMLB), where he previously served from 2010 to 2018, twice as President, and returned in 2022 as a director.\n\nBeyond his veterinary practice, Kolb's influence extends to organizations such as the Ohio Veterinary Medical Association (OVMA), where he served on the OVMA Board of Trustees for several terms. Kolb has chaired the Confidential Assistance and Support Committee, then Wellbeing Committee for over 30 years and has played a pivotal role in promoting mental health awareness and support for veterinary professionals. He is currently the Veterinarian representative to the Ohio Professionals Health Program Board of Directors.\n\nKolb's tireless efforts in advocating for mental health awareness and his instrumental role in developing a Safe Haven Program for the veterinary community have been invaluable. This program provides a confidential way for veterinarians to seek support for mental health or substance use disorders without fear of losing their license or job, ensuring that all veterinarians and credentialed technicians can access the assistance they need outside the disciplinary process.\n\nHis own personal journey of long-term recovery and his subsequent dedication to helping others in similar situations highlight his exceptional character. He has made significant contributions to the mental health and well-being of veterinary professionals in Ohio and nationally, and his advocacy for mental health has saved lives and encouraged many to prioritize their well-being.\n\nAdditionally, Kolb's philanthropic efforts have supported mental health initiatives within Ohio State’s College of Veterinary Medicine, creating nurturing environments that foster the well-being of the entire Ohio State community.\n\nWilliam Saville, DVM, DACVIM, PhD, a posthumous recipient of the Distinguished Alumni Award, received his PhD in Veterinary Epidemiology from The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine in 1998. Saville passed away in 2018, leaving behind a remarkable legacy of contributions to the field.\n\nSaville began his career as an equine practitioner in Alberta, Canada, where he specialized in equine medicine and gained a reputation for his dedication to understanding and preventing equine disease.

He authored over 50 peer-reviewed scientific publications and received the College's Pfizer Award for Research Excellence in 2005.\n\nIn addition to his research, Saville was committed to teaching and advising graduate students, guiding them to successful degree completion. His dedication to education earned him the award for Creativity in Teaching at Ohio State’s College of Veterinary Medicine in 2003.\n\nSaville served two terms as the Chair of the Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine at Ohio State from 2007 to 2015. He was a diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine and served as the Director of the college’s Alice Lloyd Finley Memorial Veterinary Research Farm from 2004-2014.\n\nHis wife, Margo Saville, accepted the Distinguished Alumni Award on his behalf.\n\nSusan Skorupski, DVM, was raised on a dairy farm near Maria Stein, Ohio. Her lifelong connection to agriculture and her unwavering commitment to animal health served as the foundation for her illustrious career. Skorupski earned her Bachelor of Science in Agriculture in 1977 and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree in 1983 from Ohio State. In 1979, between earning her degrees from Ohio State, Skorupski earned her MS in Animal Science from Cornell University.\n\nSkorupski embarked on her professional journey with a dedication to herd health and disease prevention as a mixed animal practitioner in Northeastern Ohio. Her focus on proactive health measures rather than merely treating sick animals proved vital to the dairy industry in Ohio.\n\nStarting with USDA FSIS in 1986 and then moving to APHIS as a field Veterinary Medical Officer in 1987, Skorupski initially contributed to food safety and quality as part of the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), specializing in meat inspection across red meat and poultry plants.\n\nAs her career continued to evolve, Skorupski assumed roles, including Assistant Area Veterinarian in Charge in Indiana and Epidemiology Officer for Ohio and West Virginia. Some of her notable achievements include authoring a comprehensive pictorial atlas of tuberculosis lesions used in slaughter plants and enhancing disease detection and control efforts.\n\nHer dedication to safeguarding animal health reached new heights when she became the Area Veterinary In Charge (AVIC) for USDA APHIS in Ohio. In this pivotal role, Skorupski played a vital part in the success of Ohio's tuberculosis, brucellosis, scrapie and pseudorabies eradication programs. Her unwavering efforts ensured Ohio's disease-free status, facilitating access to domestic and international markets for the state's animal and animal products. Skorupski’s efforts as an epidemiologist and AVIC were more broadly directed at protecting American animal agriculture.\n\nSkorupski's advocacy extended to secure food supply and biosecurity planning, crucial elements in safeguarding agricultural commerce during disease events. As a delegate and liaison to the USDA APHIS administration in Washington, D.C., she tirelessly represented the interests of Ohio operations and producers, advocating for their benefit.\n\nBeyond her professional duties, Skorupski displayed a strong commitment to the education and training of future veterinarians. She mentored aspiring veterinary students interested in public practice careers and facilitated valuable opportunities for them to interact with her efforts.\n\nHer contributions greatly impacted public health, where she played a vital role in training Ohio's public health officials to respond to zoonotic disease outbreaks. Her leadership and support led to the development of training programs and educational materials, benefiting professionals throughout Ohio and influencing veterinary and graduate programs at Ohio State.\n\nSkorupski's dedication to animal health and agriculture was recently recognized with the 2022 Career Achievement Award presented by the Ohio Poultry Association.\n\nDennis Summers, DVM, graduated from The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine in 2006 and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Agriculture from The Ohio State University in 2001.\n\nThroughout his career, Summers has demonstrated exceptional versatility and leadership. From large animal practice and surgery to public service with the Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA), he has continually shown dedication to Ohio's animal industries.\n\nCurrently, he serves as the Chief of the Division of Animal Health for the ODA, which protects and promotes the health of Ohio’s livestock and poultry industries. In that capacity, he serves as Ohio’s State Veterinarian and oversees all operations for the division. His tireless efforts in regulatory medicine, animal health and disease prevention have made him a prominent figure in Ohio agriculture.\n\nSummers has played a pivotal role in enhancing collaborations between Ohio State’s College of Veterinary Medicine and key stakeholders in Ohio's agricultural management.
