        "text": "Gerald J. Vile, from Surf City, passed away at home surrounded by his loving family on Monday, August 23rd, 2021. Jerry was 79. He was the son of the late Kathryn nee Ackley and Robert D. Vile, Sr.\n\nJerry was preceded in death by his siblings Donald C. and his wife Miriam, Robert J., Richard F., and his brother-in-law Frank Martin.\n\nHe is survived by his beloved wife of 54 years, Eileen (nee Schultes), his children, Gerald Jr., Michael C. and his wife Megan, Sandra M. Mazzagatti and her husband Pete, his grandchildren, Nicole Vile, JJ Vile, Allison Vile, Peter Mazzagatti, Brayden Vile and Bryson Vile, his siblings, Charles G. and his wife Bettie, Marian Martin, and sisters-in-law, Carol Raskay and Eleanor Vile, as well as many cousins, nieces, and nephews.\n\nJerry was born in Philadelphia, grew up in the Olney neighborhood and attended St. Helena’s Catholic school and then Cheltenham High School. He was a sharpshooter in the US Army and drove a tank during the Vietnam War. Upon his discharge he worked in construction, while starting a family. He then turned his sights to the refuse business, starting United Disposal Systems, a business he would own for twenty years. He sold that business and would then become Superintendent of Refuse for Abington Township, PA. A position he would hold until his retirement.\n\nJerry was an avid sportsman who enjoyed fishing, boating, golf and his beloved Long Beach Island, where he has owned a home for the last 40 years. Above all, Jerry was dedicated to his family and was actively involved in the lives of his children and grandchildren. From coaching his own children’s soccer teams, to taking his grandchildren tubing on his boat, Jerry loved life and lived it to the fullest.\n\nA funeral mass in honor of Jerry will be held on Thursday, August 26th at St. Francis of Assisi Church in Brant Beach, Long Beach Island. A memorial gathering will begin at 12:00pm, followed by the Mass of Christian Burial at 1:00pm.\n\nMemorial contributions in memory of Gerald. J. Vile may be sent to the Wounded Warrior Project P.O. Box 758516, Topeka, Kansas 66675-8516 or donate online at https://support.woundedwarriorproject.org/Default.aspx?tsid=10043 .\n\nCondolences may be sent to his family by visiting www.maxwelltobiefuneralhome.com"
