        "text": "Gerald Scott Weinrich died unexpectedly on Saturday, June 22, 2024. He was born in\n\nCaledonia, Minnesota in 1957. Between his birth and his death, he lived life to its fullest\n\nenriching the lives of all who were lucky enough to have known him.\n\nHis family called him \"Scott\" and his friends called him \"Gerry.\" His wife used them together or interchangeably. Gerry Scott was not a huge conversationalist, however, his words although sparing, were always something you didn't want to miss. Gerry Scott used his life and his love of learning to help others. While practicing law Gerry helped his clients navigate whatever life had thrown at them. He was also gracious with his time to help family, friends, and even strangers. He was involved in many service organizations, most recently the board of the Rochester Women's Shelter.\n\nGerry Scott loved movies, especially 1950's monster movies. Gerry was a genius when it came to useless facts and trivia, especially 1960's television. He loved history and learning. The depth of his knowledge can only be described as encyclopedic. As such, he was incredibly dangerous at trivia.\n\nHe traveled around the US, Scotland, and Ireland. Not to the beaches as much as cities, farmers markets, and museums. He loved music, especially folk music, which is why their last road trip was to the great state of Oklahoma to visit the Woody Gutherie and Bob Dylan museums. Gerry Scott would recommend everyone adding Tulsa Oklahoma, Seattle Washington, and the Oregon coast to their travel schedule. At home, he loved to cook and entertain. He was a home-brewer, a winemaker, a mead maker, and roasted his own coffee. Every morning, he delivered a cup in bed to his wife. This was something he took a lot of criticism from other men about who thought he was setting the bar too high. Even that did not deter him.\n\nHis favorite holiday was Samhain (Halloween). Every year he hosted, The Feast of Samhain (Halloween party). Not a costume party, but a food-themed event, which included offerings of from his own labels, Chateau de Macabre and Crowtown Brewing. Gerry would plan his Halloween party for months in advance, creating food themes, a story for his invitation, and trivia for guests. Costumes were optional as it was about the food and the fun. Ask his friends, these parties were epic.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, the Honorable Pamela Ann Weinrich King, and their fur family Bella, Winifred Ruth \"Winnie Ru,\" and Shepherd; sister Robin (Jon) Klande; his nieces Bobbie Klande and Amber (John) Crellin; Great-nephew, Nick Spratte, as well as many in-laws, cousins, and friends he considered family.\n\nGerry loved good food and the meals served at their KingWeinrich Tavern, were legendary amongst his friends. Gerry was also a lover of tradition and weekly trips to the local farmer's market and \"treat run\" to the bank with the dogs were staples. Gerry and his wife were long-term homebrewers, as well as makers of wine. Again, by tradition, he and his wife brewed their first beer together on New Years Day many years ago and have made sure to do one on the first week of January ever since. Gerry Scott had an impressive collection of vinyl, which he enjoyed sharing in his basement \"tavern\" along with good conversation. Finally, even though his wife had become an avid golfer, Gerry had long taken the position when encouraged to take up golf that he would never step foot on golf course. He accomplished this goal.\n\nScott graduated from Mayo High School, Hamline University, and Hamline University School of Law. He is preceded in death by his parents, Gerald and Barb Weinrich. Gerry Scott loved life, and the world is a little bit smaller without him in it. Please raise a glass in his honor over your favorite meal sometime this week and wish him godspeed. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to the Rochester Women's Shelter, Olmsted County Legal Assistance or Unshattered.\n\nMemorial service will be held at 1:00 p.m. on Friday, July 12, 2024 at Ranfranz and Vine Funeral Homes (5421 Royal Place NW, Rochester, MN). Visitation will be held from 11:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. the same day at the funeral home.\n\nRanfranz and Vine Funeral Home is honored to be serving the Weinrich family; To share a special memory or condolence, please visit www.ranfranzandvinefh.com"
