        "text": "Crew began in the spring of 2001 with about two eights worth of boys. Rowing out of Canton from 2001-2002 and The Living Classrooms Foundation property from 2003-2005, the crew team gauged success in the early going by learning to row better each week, starting to beat boats here and there and training harder and harder.\n\nThen in 2004, rowing our first brand new Vespoli eight and four, St. Paul’s starting winning regattas. In 2005, we won all five races we entered at the William Fritz Regatta on the Potomac that year, stunning all our rivals. That same year, we even surprised ourselves by finishing sixth in the Jr. 4 event at the Stotesbury Cup Regatta, the worlds largest and most competitive high school regatta.\n\nAlways a popular sport at St. Paul’s, rowing was also gaining a competitive reputation and began drawing larger numbers to the team. In 2006 we moved to Middle River and began having longer, more productive practices on calm water without battling water taxis and huge wakes in the Inner Harbor. Boys started training harder in the winter months to get ready for spring crew and it showed. Our fleet of boats expanded to two eights and three fours to accommodate a steady 35 to 38 rowers by 2009. More important, rowers emerged in the last five years as serious athletes and contenders for college recruiting. Therefore, the top rowers led the way in training and setting a tone of a serious commitment to winning. Since 2009 SP Rowing has continued to improve, placing consistently in the grand finals of the Stotesbury Regatta in the Boys Junior and Senior 4 events, with the team’s first bronze medal coming in 2013.\n\nIn the past six years, St. Paul’s rowers have gone on to row at the following collegiate programs: Colgate, Coast Guard, Williams, Georgetown, Middlebury, Rollins, Hobart, Yale, Navy, Vermont, U. Penn, Trinity, Brown, and Drexel. Among those athletes, SP rowers have been in boats that have won Eastern Sprints titles and National Championship medals. Stay tuned in 2014-2015 for results of the Oxford/Cambridge Boat Race, in which Morgan Gerlak ’10 will be participating for the Dark Blues of Oxford.\n\nYEAR COACH OTHER CREW CUP 2001 Judd Anderson Alexander G.

Bartlett\n\nSt. Paul's Hockey Program Origins\n\nIn 1990-91, a group of boys including Michael Franks (Stick Boy for the AHL Skipjacks), Tim Swiss, Scott Paymer, and others did not want to wrestle, play basketball or take physical education during the winter season. They asked Michael's father, Denis Franks to sponsor ice hockey, and he agreed. The Athletic Director at the time, Mark Ruess, supported the plan, and the boys started skating as a Club twice a week at Patterson Park. Martin Juranick, Darren McCausland, and other members of the AHL Skipjacks helped serve as instructors, and in 1992-1993 the squad joined the Maryland Scholastic Hockey League as a 'developmental' team. Lloyd Bunting, a lacrosse player at Hopkins in the 1950's and member of the lacrosse Hall of Fame was convinced to coach and helped steer the team in its first two years of interscholastic competition. The program became a non-developmental team in 1994-95, and Mr. Rokous became the first faculty coach. With persistence from the school's hockey families, Headmaster Hallett agreed to help make St. Paul's the first MIAA school to award Varsity letters for ice hockey. And the rest as they say is history!\n\nOverall Records\n\nYEAR W-L COACH CAPTAINS OTHER ICE HOCKEY CUP 1995-1996 2-11-1 Chris Rokous Andrew Combs 1996-1997 3-9 Chris Rokous John Payne Kimball Payne 1997-1998 0-11 Derek Stikeleather Crickie Thomas Christopher B.
