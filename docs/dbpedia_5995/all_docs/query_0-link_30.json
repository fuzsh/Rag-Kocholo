Survived by son Peter Golden and his wife Tina; daughter Meredith Golden and her partner Nancy Marsh; granddaughters Rachel (Golden) Sklar and her husband Andy, and Danielle Golden; and great-granddaughters Ella and Sasha Sklar. Predeceased by her brothers Francis Ulman and Ted Ulman. Services at Sharon Memorial Park, 40 Dedham St., Sharon, MA (gather behind administration building), Thursday, August 20, 2015 at 1:45 pm. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Union of Concerned Scientists, 2 Brattle Sq., #6, Cambridge, MA 02138.\n\nThe educator and social activist Ruth Ulman Golden passed away on August 15th at the age of 96. At the time of her death she was a resident of Sherrill House in Jamaica Plain, where lived for many years. Born in Boston in 1919, she was a graduate of Girls Latin School and Radcliffe College. After completing her undergraduate studies in biology in 1939 she became a laboratory research assistant at Massachusetts General Hospital. Her marriage to the industrialist Gerald Maxwell Golden ended in divorce. In later years she attended graduate school at Simmons College and studied as a DuPont Fellow at Harvard University in preparing to become a teacher of life sciences. Subsequently, in Boston-area private schools she taught at Woodward in Quincy, Walnut Hill in Natick and the Buckingham School in Cambridge. In the mid-1960s she spent a year abroad as a teacher at the International School in Frankfort, Germany. Subsequent to her retirement she was a book buyer at the Boston Museum of Science. She served for decades as an elected member of Brookline Town Meeting. An intrepid activist on behalf of women’s rights, affordable housing and the environment, she was a founder of the Emerald Necklace Conservancy, belonged to the Union of Concerned Scientists and for many years was associated with Brookline PAX. Her daughter Meredith and son Peter along with nieces Laine Pasuit and Cindy Ulman as well as her devoted cousins Truda Bloom and Robert Spiegelman survive her."
