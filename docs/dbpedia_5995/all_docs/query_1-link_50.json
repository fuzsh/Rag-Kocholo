        "text": "Our History\n\nPrior to 1907 there was no established fire protection in the town of Madison Connecticut. Fire hydrants had been installed in some parts of the town by the Guilford Water Company, but Madison did not have any of its own fire equipment. The closest fire department at that time was in Guilford. In the event of a fire, Madison would have had to request help from Guilford or used more primitive methods of fighting fires such as a bucket brigade, a common, yet usually ineffective manner of fighting fires. Citizens would form a human chain from a pond, lake, the sound or another readily available source of water to the scene of the fire. Full and empty buckets would be passed back and forth by hand until the fire was extinguished. While valiant in effort, bucket brigades usually resulted in a total loss for the affected building or buildings.\n\nIn the early hours of July 5th 1907, a two family tenement house owned by Matilda Vogel and occupied by Frank H. Dunlap and family burned to the ground. The home, which was located in the downtown area of Madison, threatened to reduce two nearby exposures, one a home and one a business, to ash as well. Before the fire could spread to these structures, a telegram was sent to the superintendent of the Guilford Water Company requesting help which arrived in the form of fire hose. Upon arrival the hose was immediately attached to a nearby fire hydrant and used to extinguish the fire by local residents. The cause for alarm generated by this fire was evident, and on August 31, 1907, Walter Clark of Madison, owner of W.E. Clark Plumbing was appointed Foreman and Chief and tasked with organizing better fire protection for the community. Mr. Clark had previously resided in Portland Connecticut where he had served as a member of that town’s fire department. Mr. Clark would serve in the role of fire chief for the next twenty one years.\n\nOn September 23, 1907, 17 charter members signed up to form a fire department and Madison Hose Company # 1 was born. Moses Joy, President of the Guilford Water Company donated a two wheel hose carriage - commonly called a hose jumper - to the new company, and pledges of over $400.00 had been made by town residents for the purpose of purchasing fire hose for use with the hose cart. Early records indicate that the first firehouse was a rented garage on the south side of the Boston Post Road in the area of what is now occupied by Willoughby’s Coffee & Tea.\n\nIn 1911 J.R. Meigs had a blacksmith by the name of Herman Johnson build the hose company a new larger four wheeled hose carriage. This carriage could be pulled by a team of horses if they were available or by members of the hose company if necessary. Later cars were used to pull the carriage to fires as the automobile became a more common fixture in the community.\n\nIn 1913 Madison Hose Company # 1 moved to our second fire station at 722 Boston Post Road. This location was also rented by the company and would be temporary - members of the company were actively searching for a more permanent location that would better suit our needs. In May of that same year, land on the north side of the Boston Post Road was granted to the company for the purpose of constructing a fire house. Perhaps symbolically, construction on the new building began on July 4, 1913. Much of the work for our fire permanent home was undertaken by hose company members themselves. During the early years of our existence, firefighters were summoned to action by the ringing of a large iron bell that hung atop the hose tower located at the firehouse. Today, our second bell, which is cast of brass, is proudly displayed in front of the firehouse - a reminder of our proud and modest beginnings. In 1916 a fire whistle was installed in the hose tower, replacing the bell. The whistle would blast specific codes that would alert firefighters of the need to respond, where the call was located in town and the type of call firefighters were needed to respond to. Calls for help were received by the local phone company office who would activate the fire whistle.\n\nA major leap in the company’s capability to fight fires took place in 1919 when our fire motorized fire apparatus was ordered. Not only was this apparatus equipped with the ability to carry hose, but it boasted a mechanical fire pump which would greatly increase the effectiveness of fighting fires in areas of the town where no fire hydrants existed. This new apparatus was built by the Howe Fire Apparatus Company of Anderson Indiana on a Ford Model T chassis for the sum of $3,100.00.\n\nAn American LaFrance Cosmopolitan pumper was purchased and was delivered on June 9, 1927. This new apparatus was equipped with a 400 gallon per minute pump. With the delivery of this new truck, the fire company now had two fire engines, which greatly increased our capabilities. Now one apparatus could lay hose from a water source to the scene of a fire and the second apparatus could be operated at the water source and supply water to the scene. A more consistent and steady supply of water was essential to saving life and property.\n\nIn September of 1928, Adolph Schweizer was elected as the second fire chief of Madison Hose Company # 1. Chief Schweizer would hold this position until October of 1938.\n\nTragedy struck on the night of September 29, 1929 when the Model T, driven by hose company member Clifford Tefft, was struck by a train while laying hose to a barn fire in the East River section of town. Tefft was killed instantly and the fire engine was destroyed. Clifford Tefft is the only member of Madison Hose Company # 1 to be killed in the line of duty.\n\nIn 1930 a new fire engine arrived to replace the Model T. This unit was also built by the American LaFrance & Foamite Company of Elmira, New York but was a larger Type 91 pumper custom apparatus. We believe funding for this new engine was provided - in part - by the New York, New Haven and Hartford railroad. Both of the American LaFrance engines were larger in size and had larger more powerful motors than the Model T, allowing them to carry more hose, equipment and manpower to the scene of a fire.\n\nIn October of 1938 William McCann was elected by the membership of the hose company to serve as our third fire chief, a rank he would hold until October of 1946.\n\nA new Mack Type 505 triple combination fire apparatus was purchased and placed in service by the company in 1939. This apparatus replaced the American LaFrance Cosmopolitan pumper. This new larger unit was equipped with a 500 gallon per minute pump and an enclosed cab - considered a luxury for fire apparatus of that time. This new apparatus would serve the town of Madison faithfully until 1965.\n\nA third apparatus was placed in service in 1940 when a Plymouth pick-up truck was purchased and outfitted to carry additional hose and fire equipment.\n\nIn October of 1946, Ernest Gauer was elected as fire chief by the members of Madison Hose Company #1. Chief Gauer would serve in this role for the next 11 years until October of 1957.\n\nModernization of the Madison Hose Company continued and in 1949 a second Mack pumper, this one a Type 45 triple combination unit was purchased, replacing the 1930 American LaFrance. This new unit would serve the community for an astonishing 30 years, finally being retired in 1979.\n\nThe 1950’s would be a decade of considerable growth and advancement by Madison Hose Company # 1. By 1951 it was clear that we were outgrowing the small firehouse on Boston Post Road and that a larger building would be required to serve the needs of the growing community. A committee was formed for the purpose of exploring possible new sites suitable for the use of a firehouse.\n\nIn 1952 discussion began regarding the purchase of radios for each of the company’s fire apparatus. Neighboring Guilford had already made this improvement to their apparatus and had demonstrated the usefulness of radios at drill between the two departments. A committee was formed and hose company member Donald Balmer was appointed committee chairman.\n\nAfter a period of research, the company met with Madison First Selectman about funding the purchase of radios. Recognizing the importance and usefulness of radios for our fire apparatus, the expense for this project was approved at a town meeting in March of 1953.\n\nIn 1954 radios were purchased for each of the three fire apparatus operated by the company and a license for using the radios was secured from the FCC. The addition of radios in the fire apparatus greatly increased our ability to communicate with each other on the way to calls and on the fire ground.\n\n1954 also saw the purchase of a larger Chevy pick-up to replace the Plymouth, Truck 3. This new unit was capable again of carrying more equipment and hose to the scene of a fire. The hose company would retire the truck from service in 1979. The North Madison Volunteer Fire Department would go on to use it as their first rescue truck, where it continued service faithfully until1990!\n\nWhen no suitable location for a new firehouse had been identified by early 1954, discussion began about the possibility of purchasing Molnar’s garage. The building; which was just two doors away from the fire station, was built in 1923 by John Griswold and Arthur Dowd had once been a Maxwell and Plymouth automobile dealer and was now an automobile service center. Though not built with the intention of being a fire station, it met two important requirements - the central location and the size, it was a larger facility that would allow the company to grow to meet the needs of the town.\n\nLater in 1954, Madison Hose Company # 1 offered the Gulf Oil Company - the owner of Mulnar’s garage - $30,000 for the purchase of the land and the building located at 665 Boston Post Road.\n\nOur offer to purchase 665 Boston Post Road was accepted in March of 1955 and the company began the process of renovating the building to make it suitable for use as our new fire station. Large windows in the front of the building were removed and large garage doors, suitable for allowing the fire trucks access to and from the building, were installed. The apartment upstairs of the garage was renovated into a meeting space and the car lifts in the garage were disassembled. The first meeting in our new home was held in June of 1955.\n\nAfter the purchase of the “new” fire house 1955, the company made the decision to sell the old firehouse. This building still stands today and is currently the home of Head Start barber shop.\n\nIn October of 1957, Donald F. Balmer was elected by Madison Hose Company # 1 members to serve as fire chief. Chief Balmer held the rank of Chief until his untimely death on January 3, 1972.\n\n1958 was another big year for Madison Hose Company, three additional firefighting units were added to the fleet. The first was a brand new Ford F Series booster unit which boasted a small pump and 1000 gallons of water - greatly needed for fighting fires in the still predominantly rural areas north of the Post Road.\n\nWhen company members traveled to New Hampshire to pick-up Engine 4, the new Ford booster truck, they learned of the availability of a 1926 Childs pumper truck which had previously served Ellington Connecticut. This unit was purchased by the hose company for the sum of $150.00 to be used as a brush truck - a duty that it executed faithfully until being retired from service in 1968. The Childs is owned and maintained by the hose company today and is a crowd favorite in the Memorial Day and 4th of July parades.\n\nThe final apparatus purchased for use by the company in 1958 was a decommissioned 1943 military surplus DUKW amphibious craft (Duck Boat) for use as our first marine unit. Over 21,000 DUKWs were built for use by the United States military throughout the various theaters in World War II. This unit was purchased for the sum of $40! Hose company members traveled to Toledo Ohio to pick up the Duck and drive it home to Madison. One can only imagine what that trip must have been like. This unit was retired from active service in the early 1970’s and was sold to the Essex Connecticut Fire Department to help keep their DUKW afloat.\n\n1965 saw the purchase of a new Ford C cab-over pumper with body work by the Maxim Motor Company of Middleboro Massachusetts. This new apparatus had a large (by the standards of 1965) 750 gallon per minute pump and a 750 gallon water tank and plenty of compartment space. This apparatus replaced the 1939 Mack pumper and would serve Madison until its retirement in 1988.\n\nOur first “new” brush truck arrived in 1968. Affectionately known as “Yellow Bird” due to its Shell Oil yellow color, this Ford pick-up was outfitted for firefighting by the ever resourceful members of the Madison Hose Company. This unit was in service until 1996.\n\nFire Chief Donald F. Balmer answered his final call when he passed away unexpectedly on January 3, 1972. In honor of Chief Balmer, the position of Chief remained vacant until the annual meeting in October of that year.\n\nJoseph Schmidt Jr. was elected as fire chief by the members of Madison Hose Company #1 in October 1972. Chief Schmidt held this rank until October of 1976.\n\nIn 1974, a second larger Ford C cab over Maxim pumper was ordered. This unit would feature a large 1000 gallon per minute pump and a 1000 gallon water tank. In addition this new truck would be outfitted with a foam system and a larger foam nozzle which was mounted above the pump of the apparatus. This new pumper was delivered in 1976 and served Madison until its retirement in 1998.\n\nA major improvement in the way emergencies are reported and emergency services are dispatched was implemented in 1974 when Madison instituted a new 911 system. Now residents and visitors of Madison would only need to remember one phone number to call for help.\n\nIn 1974 Hose Company members John Bodner and Bill Lawlor restored the 1926 Childs to parade condition.\n\nIn 1975 a new Ford Oren fire apparatus was ordered to replace the 1958 Ford booster unit. This new apparatus would be equipped with a small pump and a large 1200 gallon water tank.\n\nIn October of 1976 Adrian “Adie” Bassett was elected Chief by the members of the Madison Hose Company # 1. Chief Bassett held this rank until October of 1978. It is interesting to note that, at 102 years of age, Chief Bassett is the oldest living fire chief in the State of Connecticut, a distinction recognized by the town of Madison and the State of Connecticut in 2017. In 2020 company members arrived via convoy at Chief Bassetts home to honor him and help him to celebrate his 100th birthday.\n\nUntil 1977 individuals who wanted to become involved in the hose company had to wait until they turned 20. In an effort to harness the interest in firefighting of several young people in the community, members of the Madison Hose Company voted to start a junior program which would allow boys as young as 16 to become involved. Ex-Chief and town Fire Marshal Sam DeBurra Jr., past Lieutenant Ralph Kyttle, Kevin Carroll and Joe Regan were the first junior firefighters in Madison Hose Company. John Bodner and Sam DeBurra Sr. were the first advisors for this program. The impact of the junior company is evident. Since its inception many of those who have served as senior members in the hose company since 1977, have come up through the juniors including three of our past, as well as our current fire chief.\n\nIn October of 1978 David Schafer was elected Chief by the members of the Madison Hose Company # 1. Chief Schafer held this rank until October of 1981.\n\nIn 1979 our first dedicated rescue truck was purchased. This new truck was built on a Dodge Power Wagon chassis with bodywork by Pierce Manufacturing of Appleton Wisconsin. This new apparatus was equipped with a PTO generator, power cord reels and quartz scene lights. Also included were the company’s first set of hydraulic rescue tools known as the Jaws of Life. This important tool is utilized to help free entrapped individuals in car wrecks. It is hard to imagine how many were saved thanks to the addition of this important rescue tool. This unit would serve as our rescue truck until 1996 and would later be retrofitted to serve as our next brush truck.\n\nIn October of 1981 Thomas Lemley was elected Chief by the members of the Madison Hose Company #1. Chief Lemley held this rank until October of 1989.\n\nAlmost 68 years after the hose company was organized because of a large fire that threatened the town, disaster struck again in downtown Madison. On December 28, 1985 at approximately 4:30 PM, a fire broke out at the Sunshine Farms Convenience Store, located at 758 Boston Post Road. Before the fire could be contained, five businesses and several apartments were destroyed by flames. Fire departments from every Shoreline town responded to help extinguish the fire. A 17 year old employee of the Sunshine Farms Convenience Store was convicted of starting the blaze which was estimated to have caused $1,000,000 worth of damage.\n\nIn 1988 the company took delivery of our first custom chassis fire engine, a Pierce Dash. This new pumper featured a custom cab designed and built specifically for firefighting and was the first apparatus purchased for the company with additional seating positions for the crew. All of our past apparatus did not have specific crew seats and firefighters stood on the tailboard of the apparatus when responding to calls. The new 2-5-1 was also the first pumper in the department delivered with a diesel motor. Other features included a 1500 gallon per minute pump and a 750 gallon water tank.\n\nIn October of 1989 Charles “Chick” Daricek was elected Chief by the members of the Madison Hose Company # 1. Chief Daricek held this rank until October of 1993.\n\nThe Sunshine Farms Convenience Store fire and the continued growth of the community highlighted the growing need and usefulness of an aerial ladder truck. In 1989 Madison Hose placed into service our first ladder truck, a 1973 Maxim 1000 gallon per minute pumper. This unit which featured a 55 foot telesquirt aerial had recently been placed out of service by the Guilford Fire Department and was purchased for $77,000. This apparatus would serve the company for the next 11 years.\n\nOur firefighting capabilities were again expanded with the delivery of a new KME Renegade custom tanker pumper, built by Kovatch Mobile Equipment in Nesquehoning Pennsylvania. This was our first apparatus to feature a 4 door, fully enclosed cab, a new requirement at that time for all fire apparatus. Also featured was a large 2,500 gallon water tank - very useful for fighting large fires in parts of our fire district where there are no fire hydrants. This apparatus replaced the 1975 Oren tanker.\n\nSamuel E. DeBurra, Jr. was elected Chief by the members of Madison Hose Company # 1 in October of 1993. Chief DeBurra held this rank until October of 1995.\n\nIn 1994, after more than 20 years without a boat for performing water rescues, Past Chief Charles “Chick” Daricek leased the company a motor boat which he owned for the sum of $1 to be used for marine rescues. The company spent some time retrofitting this boat for fire and rescue purposes and placed it in service. During boating season this unit was kept in the water at West Wharf so it could be pressed quickly into service. The Hose Company would use this boat until 2003.\n\nCharles “Chick” Daricek was reelected as Fire Chief by members of Madison Hose Company # 1 in October of 1995. Chief Daricek held this rank until October of 2001.\n\nA new larger rescue truck was delivered in 1996. This large unit featured a walk-in box style body that provided additional crew seating, a place to warm up or cool down in inclement weather, and greatly increased compartment space to carry the growing number of specialty tools used by the company during rescue operations. The new unit also featured a cascade system for filling the air bottles for SCBA devices at the scene of a major incident. The apparatus was built by 3D on a Freightliner commercial chassis. This unit replaced the older Dodge Power Wagon rescue truck.\n\nWith the delivery of the new rescue, the Dodge Power Wagon had its rescue body removed and company members fabricated and installed a new diamond plate body with a pump and water tank for use as a brush truck. Once in service, the 1968 Ford brush truck was retired from service and sold.\n\nRealizing the usefulness of the new marine unit along with its limitations, Madison Hose Company # 1 purchased an 18 foot Zodiac SMRN-500 inflatable boat in 1998. This smaller boat could get into places the larger “R2” boat could not get to and it was carried on a trailer and could be launched easily from any of the beaches in the town.\n\nMadison Hose Company # 1 took delivery of a new custom Pierce Dash 100 foot mid mount heavy duty ladder truck in 2000. This new unit featured an enclosed cab with seating for six people, a 2000 gallon per minute pump and a 400 gallon water tank. This truck was one of the first of its kind built by Pierce and it took longer than expected to arrive in town. Having already been placed out of service and sold the 1973 Maxim aerial unit, Pierce lent the Hose Company a similar demo aerial ladder for use while our new truck was being built. When it arrived and was placed in service, the new 2-7-1 could serve as a totally self sufficient unit at the scene of a fire if need be or could be supplied and carry-out traditional truck company operations.\n\nRobert C. Gerard was elected Chief by members of Madison Hose Company # 1 in October of 2001. Chief Gerard served in this role until October of 2011.\n\nA Ford F-550 Super Duty 4x4 chassis was purchased in 2002 for use as a brush truck. Using the diamond plate body off the Dodge Wagon brush truck, Hose company members outfitted this unit for service in house.\n\nA larger and more appropriate rescue boat - a 20 foot Maritime Skiff was placed in service as R-2 in 2003. This boat was stored on a trailer during the off-season and was kept in the water at the ready at West Wharf during summer months.\n\nIn 2006 a new custom Pierce Enforcer pumper was delivered and placed into service. The new unit featured a 1500 gallon per minute pump, 750 gallons of water and a foam system. When the new engine arrived the company was permitted by the town to keep the 1988 Pierce and for the first time in 8 years Madison had two class A pumpers in service at one time.\n\n2007 was a big year for Madison Hose Company # 1, turned 100 years old. To celebrate this event a large firemen’s parade was held and marched through the center of town, and Fire Chief Bob Gerard wrote and compiled a history of the company which was printed and made available to Hose Company members and the public. Most of the history for this section was gathered from that book.\n\nIn 2010 a new Crimson Fire Apparatus 3000 gallon tanker arrived and replaced the older KME. The new rig featured a short 6 person cab and a 2000 GPM pump. The unique design of this apparatus allowed for huge capacity of water, hose and pumping capabilities on an easily maneuverable vehicle - perfect for use in Madison’s many tight roads and cul-du-sacs. This new unit was capable of shuttling water or acting as a source or scene supply unit at large fires.\n\nDavid Thomas was elected Chief by member of Madison Hose Company # 1 in October of 2011. Chief Thomas held this rank until October of 2012.\n\nChief Robert Kyttle was elected Chief by the members of Madison Hose Company # 1 in October of 2012. Chief Kyttle remains Chief Officer of the company to this day.\n\nA new Pierce Enforcer rescue pumper was ordered in 2015 and arrived the following year. This new unit was designed to replace the Freightliner rescue and the 1988 Pierce Dash pumper which was now close to 30 years old. The new truck would be capable of doing the job of both of the units it replaced. Spatial constraints in the fire station and the cost of maintaining a large fleet of apparatus drove the decision to purchase a unit of this type.\n\nAfter many years of intense debate, the company purchased our first command unit in 2016. This vehicle was purchased specifically for the company officers to use for emergency responses. Prior to the delivery, Madison Hose Company officers drove their personal vehicles to all calls. This new unit, a Chevy Tahoe, was designed to carry incident command equipment, an air pack, forcible entry tools and fire extinguishers for quick use by the officers of the company.\n\nIn 2017 a new smaller Zodiac inflatable boat was purchased to replace the now aging Zodiac SMRN-500. This new boat was able to operate in even more shallow and difficult areas where the larger boats could not navigate. This Zodiac was significantly lighter and could be more easily and more quickly launched by a small crew on any of the town’s beaches. This boat is stored on a trailer at the firehouse and is ready for service at a moment’s notice. The older Zodiac was retired from service and sold.\n\n2018 saw major updates to the radio systems that emergency responders in town use for dispatching and communicating with one another. A major component of this upgrade included the purchase of hand held portable radios for each member of the company. Now firefighters arriving on scene before the fire apparatus or officers were able to provide important scene size up, helping arriving units to determine the resources that would be needed for that particular call while still in route.\n\nIn 2019, the town approved a floating dock which would be installed at the West Wharf for use by the fire department for the purpose of storing our rescue boat when it is in the water. This is a huge improvement that allows for the boat and responders to get underway more rapidly. Prior to the dock, the rescue boat was tied to and moored at a pile-on in the water at the beach using a complex rigging system that was difficult and time consuming to operate. Rescuers needed to wade through water that was - at times - waist high to get to the boat to get underway.\n\n2020 saw the arrival of several new units including a new $1.3 million dollar tower ladder to replace the 2000 Pierce aerial. The new truck was delivered without a pump, a water tank or hose - the company favored the additional compartment space that would be gained by omitting these components. The new ladder truck is shorter in length than its predecessor but has increased capabilities that allow for quicker and more safe set-up and operation along with a bucket that makes for safer operation on roofs and below grades. Included in the bucket are dual water monitors which can be used for master stream operation at large fires. The 2000 Pierce ladder and the 2020 Pierce ladder would work together once only at a residential fire early in 2021. The 2000 Pierce was on loan to neighboring Guilford who responded on a RIT assignment to the fire. The older ladder truck was retired and sold to a department in up-state New York shortly after this fire."
