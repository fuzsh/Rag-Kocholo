        "meta_description": "Gerald Charles Gilpin    1954-2024  Gerald was born May 18, 1954 in Oklahoma City at University Hospital. He passed away May 22, 2024 in Edmond OK at 70 Years of age.  Gerald was preceded in death by his grandparents Les and Stella Gilpin, both of Tulare, California, Clarence Cargill of Bakersfield, California, and Alice Cargill of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, his father and mother, Ralph and Jimmie Gilpin, brother Darrell and Sister-in-law, Hazel Gilpin, and many aunts and uncles, each special in different ways.  Gerald is survived by his oldest son Charles, Charlesâ wife Pamela and their daughter Julianna his youngest son Jonathan and blessings grandchildren, Conner and Sawyer, his ex-wife, Carole, his brother-in-laws and sister-in-laws Mary Maxwell- Kirkmeyer, James Maxwell, Barbara Maxwell Shanahan, John Maxwell, Charles Maxwell and Mark Maxwell. He is survived by brothers, Carroll and wife, Sarah, Gary and wife, Jamie, and Vincent and his wife, Maria. He has 5 nephews and 1 niece, and again, many more aunts and uncles throughout the country.  Gerald was a high school graduate from John Marshall High School in Oklahoma City, Ok where he held the pole vaulting record for many years. It could be still standing today. He went on to finish drafting school, but chose to spend his career as an Insulation Installer, just like most of his immediate family. He was a proud member of The Asbestos Workers Local #94, and when we say proud, there was no doubt he loved the Union with the shared rights it brings its members. And as soon as he was eligible, he ran for committees and other offices. The last office he held was President.  Geraldâs passions were fishing, playing golf, racquetball and Oklahoma Sooners Sports. It didnât matter menâs or womenâs sports. If it was OU crimson, he was onboard. He was a devout Democrat to the end, and if you were short on time when you started a conversation, it had better not be political. He was so competitive that less then 10 years ago, he and his son were in a racquetball tournament that involved about 20 games where he defeated his son Jonathan for the championship, Jonathan was in his 30âs. Also, in his 60âs, he scored 2 holes in one, so, he was not a bad Golfer either. Needless to say he was an athlete. Jonathan shared that his dad was the strongest person on the entire planet the way he survived 27 minutes of CPR just to stay with his family another few weeks. Gerald is being permanently laid to rest at Grace Lawn Cemetery, Edmond OK, in the new expansion area between two trees which almost makes it his little serene uncrowded resting place. The rest of the immediate family is considering making this area their little sanctuary after finding it for Gerald. Jonathan never even considered anything like this but heâs going to get his own spot.  We are so happy to know you were met at the North Gate by so many wonderful people that were called home before you. And we know we will all see you again soon.  Services will be held at 2:00 p.m., Thursday, May 30, 2024, at Matthews Funeral Home Chapel Edmond, OK.",
