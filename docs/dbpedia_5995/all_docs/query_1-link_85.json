        "text": "Students, faculty, alumni, and citizens of the state came together during the 1996-97 academic year to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the February 25, 1847, founding of The University of Iowa. This brief history of the University was compiled at that time by the University News Service.\n\nFOUNDING DATE\n\nFebruary 25, 1847, 59 days after Iowa became a state.\n\nOPENING OF CLASSES\n\nThe first faculty offered instruction at the University in March 1855 to students in the Old Mechanics Building, situated where Seashore Hall is now. In September 1855, the student body numbered 124, of which 41 were women. The 1856-57 catalogue listed nine departments offering Ancient Language, Modern Language, Intellectual Philosophy, Moral Philosophy, History, Natural History, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Chemistry.\n\nThe original campus was composed of Old Capitol and the 10 acres of land on which it stood. Following the placing of the cornerstone July 4, 1840, the building housed the Fifth Legislative Assembly of the Territory of Iowa (December 5, 1842) and then became the first capitol of the State of Iowa (December 28, 1846). Until that date it had been the third capitol of the Territory of Iowa. When the capitol of Iowa was moved to Des Moines in 1857, Old Capitol became the first permanent “home” of the University.\n\nUNIVERSITY DISTINCTIONS\n\n1855-The University receives 50 books, the basis for its library that will open in 1857. University Libraries eventually will become one of the nation’s largest research libraries, with world-renowned collections of rare medical books, materials about Abraham Lincoln, and works by Leigh Hunt and Edgar Allan Poe.\n\n1858 The University awarded its first degree to Mr. Dexter Smith, who received the Bachelor of Science degree. By the mid-1990s, Iowa will have awarded nearly 200,000 degrees.\n\n1858-The Cabinet (later Museum) of Natural History is established – the first university museum west of the Mississippi.
