        "text": "Webster: Age 101, passed away peacefully January 7, 2024. Davis is survived by sons, Dr. Mark Edgar (Suzanne Serdinak) and Stephen Warren Parker; daughter, Sarah Jane (Richard) Sultzer; grandchildren, Dr. Adam Edgar Parker, Dianna Jill Parker, Jeffrey Milan (Stefanie Marsa) Parker, Davis Edgar Parker II, Maxwell Faust Parker (Joe Lavertue) and Nolan James Parker, Kendra Jane Sultzer and Parker Robert Sultzer; great-granddaughter Ellie Marsa Parker. Also, exchange students, Toshiaki Hosaka of Tokyo, Ralf Holmlund of Helsinki and Fusun Saygili of Izmir, Turkey. He is predeceased by parents, Gerald Edgar and Luella Davis Parker; wife of 73 years, Jane Hunter Parker; and sister, Belva Joyce Kilbourn. Dave was born August 4, 1922 in Carthage, NY, and graduated from Watertown High School in 1939, from NYS Teacher's College at Oswego in 1947, and from the University of Rochester in 1967. He retired as Director of Personnel from Webster Central School in 1981 following teaching 7th grade math. An Army veteran of WWII, he served in New Guinea.\n\nDave was a member of Webster Presbyterian Church, a twelve-year member of the Board of Directors of the Oswego Alumni Association, served for eleven years as a member of the Board of Education of BOCES #1, and had long term responsibilities with the Association of Teen Age Diplomats, the Retired Professional Society, and the WPC Mission Committee. In retirement he and Jane spent over two years at the Red Bird Mission in Beverly, KY. He was a downhill skier, starting at age 50, and traveled with friends to western U.S., Canada and Europe. Davis very much enjoyed the family cottage at Lake Bonaparte. In late 2015, he and Jane moved to Chapel Oaks, a retirement community in Rochester (regretfully leaving their neighborhood in Webster) where he happily lived until his demise. He especially enjoyed the new family he acquired at Chapel Oaks, frequent visits from his children and grandchildren, and the wonderful care he received from Home Sweet Home and his many other caregivers and friends.\n\nA Memorial Service will be held 11:30 AM Saturday, February 10, at Webster Presbyterian Church, 550 Webster Rd., Webster, NY 14580. Contributions in Dave's memory may be made to the Webster Presbyterian Church Mission Committee, the Beta Scholarship Fund of the Oswego Alumni Association, SUNY Oswego, Oswego, NY 13126 or the Red Bird Mission, Beverly, KY 40913.
