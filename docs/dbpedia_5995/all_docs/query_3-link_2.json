        "text": "Maxwell, also known as Gerald Maxwell Rivera, was born on May 23, 1973. He is known for his smooth, soulful voice and contemporary R&B sound. He rose to prominence in the mid-1990s with his debut album “Maxwell’s Urban Hang Suite,” which became a critical and commercial success.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York, Maxwell grew up in a musically inclined family. He developed a passion for music at an early age and began performing in local clubs during his teenage years. His vocal abilities and distinct style drew attention from industry professionals, leading to a record deal with Columbia Records.\n\nDespite extended breaks between album releases, Maxwell has maintained a dedicated fan base throughout his career. His commitment to quality over quantity has contributed to his status as one of the most respected and influential soul singers of his generation."
