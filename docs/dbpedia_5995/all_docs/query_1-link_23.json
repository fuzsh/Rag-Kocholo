        "text": "Eudora Welty Collection\n\nNamed for Mississippi’s most prized author, the Eudora Welty Collection was established in Welty’s honor on the occasion of her 75th birthday in 1984. Welty was awarded an honorary doctor of letters degree by Millsaps in 1969. The materials included in the collection are books by and about Welty, numbering about 400. The collection also includes first editions of all her works, autographed and donated to the library by Welty. There are other first editions as well. Correspondence between Welty and Lehman Engel is included in these two collections. An effort has been made to include all dissertations written about her and collections of criticism or biography which include major portions about her are included as well. This collection does not include articles which appeared in periodical format. The Mississippi Department of Archives and History includes this material in its Welty collection. Welty’s connection with Millsaps includes service as Writer in Residence and as member of the college’s board of trustees. The college hosts a Welty Scholar on campus each spring.\n\nGeneral Louis Wilson Exhibit\n\nGeneral Louis Wilson, B.S. 1941, was born February 11, 1920, in Brandon, Mississippi, to Louis H. and Bertha Buchanan Wilson. While at the college, he competed in football and track. Wilson was commissioned a Marine officer upon graduation. As a platoon and later company commander in the Ninth Marine Regiment, Third Marine Division, he took part in a number of combat operations in the Pacific, including the invasion of Guam during the Marianas campaign in 1944. It was on Guam that Captain Wilson took part in a two-day company action that resulted in his being awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\nReturning stateside to recover from wounds sustained in that action, he was assigned to the Marine Barracks in Washington, D.C. Later that year he married his Millsaps sweetheart, Jane Clark, of Pearson, Mississippi.\n\nAlready a major at the end of the war, Wilson elected to stay in the service and rose through the field grade and general officer ranks. His duty postings included battalion and regimental commands, a stint at the National War College, and overseas service in South Korea and South Vietnam. He was named commandant of the Marine Corps in 1975 by President Gerald Ford.\n\nFollowing his retirement in 1979, Wilson sat on a number of corporate boards. He and his wife lived in Jackson at the time, and later moved to San Marino, California. The Wilsons eventually returned to the South, settling in Birmingham to be near their only child, Janet Wilson Taylor, an attorney and mother of two.\n\nWilson was made a trustee of Millsaps College in 1978 and was made a life trustee in 1990. Wilson’s military decorations included the Congressional Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with Combat “V” and two Gold Stars, the Navy Commendation Medal, the Purple Heart Medal with two Gold Stars and the Presidential Unit Citation with Bronze Battle Star. His civilian honors included the Gold Medal from the National Football Foundation Hall of Fame (1977), the Golden Plate Award from the American Academy of Achievement, the Outstanding American Award from the Los Angeles Philanthropic Foundation, the Iron Mike Award from the Marine Corps League, the City of New York Silver Seal, Distinguished Achievement Award from Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity (1946), Outstanding Mississippian Award (1974) and Omicron Delta Kappa from Millsaps College (1976). He was also inducted into the Millsaps College Sports Hall of Fame in 1980.\n\nGeneral Louis Wilson died Tuesday, June 21, 2005 at the age of 85 at his home in Birmingham.\n\n“Millsaps has always meant a great deal to me. I had never really considered going anywhere else to college. But Millsaps in those days, as now, had a splendid reputation for its academic work; the achievements of its graduates.”\n\nLouis H. Wilson, 1941, Trustee, Retired Commandant, United States Marine Corps\n\nItems in the exhibit include:\n\n1941 Commencement program\n\nPi Kappa Alpha fraternity pin\n\nGeneral Wilson’s garrison cap\n\nService decorations, 1942-1979\n\nHome of the Commandants\n\nThe Medal of Honor\n\nThird Marine Division shoulder patch and Captain’s bars\n\nForeign Decorations\n\nKorean Order of National Security Merit,\n\nGUK-SEON Medal, 2nd Class\n\nIn the video below, Col.
