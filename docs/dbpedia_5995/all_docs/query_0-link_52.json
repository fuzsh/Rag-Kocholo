        "text": "Captain Frederick Ross Maxwell Johnson (9 December, 1889 – 18 June, 1939) was an officer in the Royal Navy. He appears to have been a generally capable officer, but his manner was off-putting to some of his superiors.\n\nLife & Career\n\nJohnson was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant on 15 June, 1911.\n\nOn 29 October 1912, Johnson was admitted to Plymouth Hospital for one month to be treated for syphilis and scabies. He was found fit a month later and appointed to the light cruiser H.M.S. Chatham. On 4 April 1913, he was cautioned for being inattentive to his duties as officer of the watch.[1]\n\nJohnson served as watchkeeper in Chatham until March 1916, and was mentioned in despatches after participating in action against the German light cruiser Königsberg in the Rufiji Delta.[2]\n\nOn 15 November 1917, Lochinvar collided with S.S. Sirius. The determination of fault is illegible in his Service Record.[3]\n\nOn 13 May 1918, he suffered a severe injury to his left hand when a gun exploded. He was found fit for shore service on 6 September, 1918.[4]\n\nJohnson was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Commander on 15 June, 1919.[Fact Check]\n\nJohnson was appointed in command of the gunboat Ladybird on 14 June, 1920.[5]\n\nOn 29 June, 1924 Johnson was admitted to Plymouth Hospital with serious injuries to his head caused by a motor accident. His condition was deemed \"serious\".\n\nJohnson was promoted to the rank of Commander on 31 December, 1924.\n\nLoaned to the Royal Australian Navy in 1925, Johnson was placed in command of H.M.A.S. Penguin. Following this command, he replaced Commander Dolphin in the light cruiser H.M.A.S. Adelaide.[6]\n\nJohnson was promoted to the rank of Captain on 30 June, 1931.\n\nOn 13 January 1936, the Admiralty told Johnson it considered him solely at fault for a collision between the Dragon and a pilot boat at the entrance to the Para River in October 1935. He was cautioned to be more careful in future.[7]\n\nJohnson commanded the minesweeper Speedwell from 25 January 1939 until being sent back to his command of Caledon on 4 March, 1939.[8]\n\nJohnson was found dead in a wood near Maidstone on 18 June, 1939, having shot himself and severed his spinal cord. Deemed a suicide whilst of unsound mind.[9]\n\nSee Also\n\nService Records\n\nWikipedia"
