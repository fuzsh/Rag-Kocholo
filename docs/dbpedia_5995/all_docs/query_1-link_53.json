        "text": "Idaho Air Force History\n\nThe Air Force did not become a separate service until 1947. Until then, the Air Bases or Air Fields as they were known, were under the jurisdiction of the Army. Idaho had three Army Air Bases during WWII. They were:\n\nGowen Field (1941-1945; 1946-current)\n\nPocatello Army Air Base/Air Field (1942-1945; 1954-1965)\n\nMountain Home Army Air Base, now Mountain Home Air Force Base (1942-1945; 1948-current)\n\nWilder Radar Bomb Scoring Site (1964-1993)\n\nFrom 1964 until 1993, the Air Force operated a radar bomb scoring detachment at Wilder, Idaho to test the effectiveness of combat ready crews of the Strategic Air Command (SAC) bombers with simulated bomb drops.\n\nGowen Field (1941-1945; 1946-current)\n\nOn October 4, 1940, the Idaho Daily Statesman announced that Boise City officials and business men were making plans to raise $35,000 in matching funds “expected to be required as an initial outlay for materials to construct accommodations for a U.S. Army bombardment and service group to be based at the Boise airport.”\n\nThe base would be headquarters “for at least 54 twin-engined medium bombers” and approximately 260 officers and 1600 enlistment men. Additionally, a service element composed of approximately 40 officers and 700 enlistment men was to be included.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Idaho Military History Museum\n\nIdaho National Guard Adjutant General Mervin G. McConnel was given much of the credit for the good news. “When attempts to bring a National Guard aviation unit to the Boise airport failed more than a year ago, Gen. McConnel emerged from the negotiations with an idea…he would write to Ninth Corps Army headquarters in San Francisco…to inquire about the possibilities of the Idaho capital being chosen as an Army base.” Click here to read a biography of MG McConnel: General McConnel Biography.pdf\n\nIdaho’s Congressional Delegation had announced that the 42nd Bombardment Group and the 39th Air Base Group were to be stationed at the base. The base was projected to cost the Army between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000. In 2020 dollars, that equates to just over $18,000,000. Boise city had also agreed to “pave two runways, 6500 feet in length and 150 feet wide, with two-inch asphaltic covering. Sixty acres on the southwest corner of the airport is to be furnished for building sites and 600,000 square feet of hard-surfaced parking area provided.”\n\nOn December 3, 1940, Adjutant General Adams of the United States Army informed Boise Mayor James Straight that the construction of the Boise Air Base had been authorized. Boise was chosen because of “climatic and physical conditions.” The base was to consist of roughly 120 buildings which would provide facilities for housing, administration, feeding or messing as it was called, recreation and warehousing a troop garrison of 2500 officers and men. The authorized cost was $2,115,130. In order to provide additional living quarters for defense personnel, a housing complex which became known as Sergeant City was constructed with funding from the Federal Works Agency. It was located nearby at Overland and Latah.\n\nOn January 1, 1941, The Idaho Daily Statesman ran a full front-page article on the forthcoming base which included a map of the Boise Air Terminal and proposed location of the new base. The article stated that “Work Starts Soon.” On January 21, 1941, equipment was moved to the site and the task of clearing sagebrush began. In March, Governor Chase Clark broke ground by turning the first “spadefull of dust soil.” The construction contract went to Boise contractors Morrison-Knudsen and J.O. Jordan & Sons. The January 13, 1941 headline in The Ogden Standard-Examiner read, “Work Slated This Week On Boise Army Air Base.”\n\nQuoting from Wings Over Idaho by Arthur A. Hart, “By mid-March, 1941, activity at the air base was feverish. Building permits had reached $2 million and were expected to continue to grow. The more than 1,000 men working on the project came from all over the state. Officials said 40 communities were represented on a monthly payroll that averaged $200 per man. Skilled carpenters got $250.”\n\nOn March 12, 1941, Colonel Robin A. Day assumed command and on April 15, 1941 the first original cadre of 20 soldiers from the 39th Air Base group arrived from Salt Lake. Quarters were not yet available so they were housed at Boise Barracks and had to carry drinking water back and forth to camp until April 25th when facilities were complete enough for them to move in.\n\nThe first station complement group, CASC unit 1984 was activated May 5, 1941 and a few weeks later, the first units arrived being the 42nd Bombardment Group which included the 75th, 76th, 77th Bombardment Squadrons and the 16th Reconnaissance Squadron. Idaho welcomed the new soldiers. A club for enlisted men was opened in Boise under the supervision of the Red Cross. It “provid[ed] a place where service men could dine, dance or just relax amid cheerful surroundings, and all at a price sized to fit a private’s pocketbook.” Additionally, the state fish and game department announced that servicemen would be able to procure resident hunting and fishing licenses.\n\nWith the installation looking more and more like an army air base, thoughts turned to an appropriate name. Initially the name would be Boise Air Base as the facility was leased, not actually owned by the government but this soon changed. Three names were sent to the Field Naming Board in Washington D.C. and in July 1941, the name Gowen Field was chosen in honor of Paul R. Gowen, a former Caldwell resident and West Point graduate who perished in a military plane crash in Panama after a motor in his twin-engine bomber failed. Headquarters Gowen Field, Boise Idaho General Order No. 8 dated July 29, 1941 made it official. Click here to read a biography of Paul Gowen: Paul Gowen Biography\n\nPhoto courtesy of Idaho Military History Museum\n\nBy August 1941, the record noted “construction had reached the stage where it was felt that development was adequate, ‘except for certain technical facilities and authorized items; to begin operation of the field as an Army Air Base.” The mission was to train bomber crews.\n\nWith the first group of soldiers installed at the base, officials began looking for a suitable piece of land to use for a bombing range. 2,560 acres of Federal Grazing Service land twenty miles south of the airport looked promising. Colonel Day assured the city that the site was located far enough away from the city to keep residents from hearing explosions. “So far as the public is concerned,...they'll never know we are practicing.”\n\nAt the beginning of December, the field was engaged in the training of medium bombardment crews for combat, reconnaissance crews for combat and the instruction of ground personnel to be sent out as cadre to form new groups under the expansion program of the Air Force.\n\nWhen word came of the attack at Pearl Harbor the service members were quickly recalled to the base. Quoting from Wings Over Idaho, “Getting them there was no simple matter on a Sunday afternoon, with about a thousand men in town on pass. Roads to the base were jammed with cars and trucks taking them back with motorcycle police escorts. Hundreds more gathered at the Boise police station waiting for transportation. ‘Bombing planes from the field flying over the city, lent a realistic atmosphere to the day’s activities.’”\n\nThe record noted, “At the time of the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, Gowen Field was under operation on a fairly limited scale. After the declaration of war, the base was placed on a full 24-hour day schedule. Civilian, police and military groups in Boise and southwest Idaho moved swiftly into defense lines as the nation prepared for sabotage…A guard program was drawn up to provide for the protection of all important installations on the base and only visitors on official business were allowed to enter the base. Gowen Field was placed on an alert basis and all furloughs and leaves were canceled.”\n\nWar created the need for new rules and procedures. Absolute secrecy would be maintained on the movement of troops and planes. Security measures were increased against sabotage, attack, or espionage, and armed guards patrolled all perimeters. No automobiles could be parked near fences. Airplanes other than military would fly over the field at their own risk, and would be treated as enemy aircraft.\n\nThe announcement that any planes other than military aircraft flying over Gowen Field “would be regarded [as] enemy ships and fired upon” was widely carried and was nearly put to the test a few days later. Spotters at Gown Field air base picked up the sound of an approaching ship and, knowing no army bombers were flying, prepared to go into action.\n\nIt turned out that the plane held Mayor LaGuardia of New York City, national civilian defense coordinator, enroute to Washington D.C. A call between the base control tower and the United Air Lines served to identify the plane and the spotters were able to relax.\n\nBy mid December 1941 the new Base had “one runway, 150 feet wide is paved for 6,062 feet and graded an additional 2,000 feet. The shortest of the three runways is 4,500 feet. There are 20 acres of concrete parking space for planes and a hangar large enough for six two-motored bombers. More than 250 officers and 2,000 men are based at the field, which originally was constructed to house 63 planes. That number has not been reached as yet, but more ships are being added at intervals.” Initially the aircraft was the B-26 Martin bombers with several B-18s used as trainers. The first bombing range was close to reality. It was located in southwestern Ada county, 5½ miles southwest of Orchard, approximately 25 miles south of Boise, and 20 miles from Gowen Field. Training of bomber crews intensified and the inevitable training accidents began to occur. In January 1942, a Boise Valley unit of the Civil Air Patrol was organized and would be involved in searching for downed Gowen Field planes and personnel. In February the training changed from medium bombardment crews to heavy bombardment crews. The new aircraft was the B-17.\n\nThe morale office, also known as the athletic and recreation office, was opened in January of 1942, and was located in Building T-303. Building T-303 is the building on the top right side of the photograph with cars parked in front. The large building at the bottom center of the photograph was the Air Bases Headquarters.

The 29th Bombardment Group which now called Gowen Field home, were used to form new units and by the close of 1942, the 29th BG had increased to 486 officers and 2,107 enlisted men. The record noted that during the year, the Group had ‘given birth’ to several new groups using the original cadre to form a nucleus of the infant units.\n\nThe historical record for 1943 also notes a number of unit activations including not only bombardment groups but guard squadrons, airdrome squadrons and engineer aviation units. “As the second year of war dawned at Gowen Field, it found that the infant base of the year before had mushroomed into a larger-scale training school.\" Several engineer companies, a guard squadron, a base headquarters squadron, a colored service company and the 14th Sub-Depot were also there at the time. [Historical note, it is important to remember that the military was segregated until President Truman issued a desegregation proclamation in 1948. Click here for the proclamation: Proclamation Pg 1 Proclamation Pg 2]\n\nThe training program of the Second Air Force at that time was to divide the schooling into three phases and to give each phase at a different station. Gowen Field gave only first phase training at that time, transferring the crews to another station for the completion of their instruction.\n\nActor and First Lieutenant Jimmy Stewart arrived at Gowen Field in February 1943. Anxious to remain undisturbed, Stewart told reporters he didn't want to be glamorized and would concentrate fully on his duties while at Gowen Field. As First Lieutenant, Stewart served as Operations Officer. The Idaho Military History Museum has a copy of a document he signed as such on exhibit. While at Gowen Field, Stewart was promoted to Captain.\n\nAnother significant event in 1943 was the arrival of the Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps or WACS who began arriving in May 1943. The WACs began working in the various sections on the base performing mainly clerical duties.\n\nMay 1943 saw approval of a Gowen Field library. The facility was to be 52’ by 92’ and completion was directed to be by October 16, 1943. This was actually an expansion of an existing library which was too small and shared space with two other organizations. The record also notes that a new gymnasium would be complete in July which would “include a regulation size basketball floor, a handball court, and a boxing ring as well as bleachers on either side of the building for spectators.” Another project was the construction of a .30 caliber rifle range with a 100, 300 and 300 yard firing line. The justification was based on the fact that along with Air Corp personnel, two (sometimes five) Aviation Engineer Battalions were on station that needed small arms training.\n\nIn June 1943, the base became a Liberator Field. The Base public relations office announced that Gowen Field was now a training center for Consolidated B-24 Liberators which would replace the B-17 Flying Fortress.\n\nThe archive noted, \"The 29th Bombardment Group ceased to function as a training group on the twenty-third of December and the policy of sending out trained ground and flying personnel as cadre to form new organizations was discontinued. The training program was changed to include all three phases of training at each of the various schools. This removed one of the touchy spots in the previous set-up, second or third phase training stations often blaming any lack of proficiency of personnel on poor indoctrination given at a previous base.”\n\n1943 also saw expansion of the base hospital. Initially opened in January 1943 as a 33-bed ward it grew in size as outbreaks of measles (April 1943) and scarlet fever (May 1943) began. The May bed count is listed as 346 and the record notes that some barracks were converted into hospital wards. December 1943 saw the establishment of the first Search and Rescue unit at Gowen Field. It was “organized to bring medical aid to Air crews making forced landings in remote areas inaccessible by ordinary means of transportation.”\n\nThe big news story of January 1944 was a production by Gowen Field’s WACS called Bombshell Review. The event premiered January 20 and 21st at Gowen Field’s theater number three. It was well received earning the headline ‘Smash Hit’. The show generated a lot of media coverage. February 1944 brought a new commander to Gowen Field. Col John R. Kane replaced Col. Lloyd Dalton. (Like many installations, Gowen Field saw a number of different commanders) Gowen Field was Col Kane’s first assignment stateside after serving 15 months overseas and earning the Medal of Honor in an August 1943 raid on Ploesti, Romania’s oil refineries. (See Medal of Honor section for more details on Col Kane).\n\nMarch 1944 saw a new clinic building placed in operation. It included a laboratory, eye, ear, nose and throat clinic, a pharmacy, and obstetrical and orthopedic clinics. These facilities were required for the hospital to meet the official designation as an Army Air Force Regional Station Hospital. A new motor pool was also completed in March and the two existing motor pools were consolidated.\n\nIn April, the scoring of bombing and gunnery practices changed from tow-target mission to photographic scoring. The 21st Tow Target flight stationed at Gowen Field was dissolved and their personnel formed the nucleus of a new unit known as Section H.\n\nMorale was high at the Base and there was a spirit of competition between the units. Competitions included “designation of ‘Honor Squadron’ for marching and general appearance in formal review, or in sponsoring the enlisted person selected as ‘Soldier of the Week.’” Crews in each phase of training compete for the honor of being awarded the “best crew title” and designation of ‘Honor Squadron’.\n\nApril 1944 saw the formation of a Non-Commissioned Officers club which included room for dancing, a dining room, a bar and a game room. The good weather also saw baseball and softball teams organized. The record also stated that “A total of 6614.33 training hours were flown and 2887 missions were accomplished”.\n\nBy the end of May 1944, 167 full crews were in training. This included 56 crews which arrived from Nebraska on the 19th to begin their first phase of training. Training hours flown increased to 8979.73.\n\nIn June 1944 the “Soldier of the Week” competition was changed to “Soldier of the Month” which enabled squadron commanders to make a more careful selection of candidates. The criteria was also modified to include barracks inspection, general conduct and military courtesy as well as appearance in formations and drill. A guidon was obtained and was awarded to the barracks having the highest number of credits accumulated at the end of each week. The guidon was “kept by the winning barracks until it is won by another barracks.”\n\nConstruction of a swimming pool for station personnel also began in June 1944. Photo courtesy of Idaho Military History Museum.\n\nAlso in June 1944, a rest camp, a sub-base of Gowen Field, was opened in McCall, Idaho. The camp was a former CCC post. “Convalescents are sent to McCall to complete the recovery usually provided by convalescent furloughs and permanent personnel are detailed to the rest camp in three-day shifts.” The camp was further described as “on the shore of Payette Lake and includes quarters, messing and recreational facilities for approximately 80 enlisted men and 20 officers. The usual tonic consists of three days detached service there, obtainable on request, but convalescents are often sent for longer periods of time to complete their recovery.”\n\nThis likely staged photo is captioned McCall Rest Camp, Gowen Fld, Ida with a date stamp of June 1945. Photo courtesy of Idaho Military History Museum.\n\nBy the end of June, 168 full crews were in training. July’s record shows that 10,054.63 crew training hours were flown but over 400 hours were lost due to shortages of aviation fuel. The record indicated that fuel shortages were an ongoing and nationwide issue.\n\nIn August 1944, an open house was held commemorating the 37th Anniversary of the Air Corps. “an estimated 3000 civilian guests, the largest number of visitors ever recorded at the base, spent an afternoon in conducted tours and climaxed their visit by watching the formal retreat ceremony in which all units on the base participated.”\n\nThe robust Base did have a few problems. The WAC supply system was bogged down and there was considerable delay in fulfilling requests for needed clothing. Laundry was another issue. “Letters were written to all laundries in the vicinity of this base, relative to contracts for officers and enlisted men’s laundry, as the firms now under contract have not been able to handle the laundry within the maximum time given.” All flying clothing repairs and reconditioning was accomplished under direct control and supervision of the Parachute Department. August saw an increase in air training hours reaching 11,629.84 hours.\n\nAnother open house was held in September, this one being for families. It was designated “Parents Day” and over 2,000 civilian relatives of military personnel visited Gowen Field for an all-day program. The September 16th Gowen Beacon reported that visitors were conducted on a tour of the non-restricted buildings on the entire installation. Two B-24 bombers were placed near the main hangar so the public could view them under military supervision. The Band played a concert and two drill teams gave a marching demonstration. Search and Rescue demonstrated how supplies could be dropped to stranded flyers and a cargo plane flew over and parachuted down some supplies. The program closed with a formal review and Colonel Kane presented awards to the best combat crew and the honor section of the month as well as several civilian awards.\n\nOctober saw completion of the much anticipated Gowen Field swimming pool. It was formally dedicated on October 14th and “nine exhibition swimmers from San Francisco, including the world and national women’s free style champion swimmer, Ann Curtis, were guest artists on the program.” Colonel Kane named it the ‘Soldiers’ Pool’ and noted that the L shape would allow recreational swimming without interference with the swimming classes. “He testified to the importance of knowing how to bail out over water and said that he felt the time and energy expended in the contemplated classes would never be regretted.”\n\nThe October 21st Gowen Beacon announced that the Black unit or Section C as it was then called, had won the title Honor Section for three consecutive months. (Circa December 1943, the units at Gowen Field had undergone a reorganization and many had been given new unit designations; Section A, B, etc.)\n\nThe Gowen Beacon ran a large front-page photo of the unit passing in review. The historical record stated that “their physical training attendance for the month was 98%, and their mark of 94% received in the review was the highest ever awarded. The section was awarded a plaque from Colonel Kane at a formal review of troops.”\n\nThe record noted that flying weather was good in October and on the last day of the month, 169 crews were in training. Crews averaged 171 hours flown prior to movement to staging areas.\n\nDecember 1944 saw the transfer of Colonel Kane to a new assignment. His departure “left Gowen Field with the reputation of ‘one of the best bases in the Second Air Force.’ Many times during his stay here representatives from other B-24 bases visited this field to study training and maintenance methods.” Col Kane was replaced by Colonel Bernard T. Caster. The historical recorded noted several ongoing strength and supply issues which were partially resolved with the closure of the Pocatello Army Air Field. Arrangements were made to transfer some of the civilian employees to Gowen Field to reduce the shortages at Gowen Field.\n\nThe big news in January 1945 was that Gowen Field was being transferred from the 2nd Air Force to the 4th Air Force. Gowen Field and Mountain Home were two of the four transfers. The transfer was tentatively scheduled to take place in March but actually took place on the 15th of February. The paperwork required was enormous but the archive noted, “This necessitated the transfer of personnel and “special orders consisting of 46 legal size pages printed on both sides, the preparation of which involved many man hours. In spite of the fact that this station was not officially notified of the transfer until 1700 on 15 February, formalities completing the severance were finished within 24 hours.”\n\nThe conversion to the 4th Air Force brought a new manning table which included more authorizations for both enlisted and officers. A TWX on March 14th authorized promotions which was a welcome relief as promotions had been frozen since December 1943.\n\nThe one noted unit casualty was the Base band which was inactivated the last day of January. A shortage of personnel forced the Dance Orchestra to disband on January 22, 1945. The responsibility for supplying music for parades and reviews fell to the Base Signal Officer. A public Address System and phonograph records were to be the means. (By May, the lack of a base band was becoming a morale issue and options included “borrow the Mountain Home band for parades” and “organize a local pick-up band composed of soldiers who possess musical talent and have played in dance orchestras before entering the service.” This would however have to be done as an additional duty. )\n\nIn late March, Gowen Field was contacted by Ontario, Oregon regarding what turned out to be a Japanese balloon bomb near Adrian, Oregon. Major George S. Spilver, Gowen Field’s Base Intelligence Officer and “a party from Gowen Field” traveled to Oregon to investigate. Two Gowen Field based B-24 planes also sighted the object, one of which was able to capture gun camera footage of it. The plane was able to guide Spilver to the spot where the balloon first landed. Along with the bomb, other components of it were also located. This was the first time that so much of a balloon bomb was recovered intact. The historical record states that the bomb was destroyed with tracer bullets near Reno Air Field after it ascended into the air after its second landing. Click here for an article by the Smithsonian about the Japanese Balloon bombs, it includes several photographs. Japanese Balloon Bombs by Smithsonian.\n\nOn April 12, 1945, President Franklin D. Roosevelt died unexpectedly and on April 15, all available Gowen Field personnel took part in a memorial parade. As victory in Europe or V-E day had seemed imminent, the War Department had announced that enlisted personnel over the age of 42 could ask for discharge. By the end of May, 33 personnel had been discharged under the plan. The 8th of May brought the wonderful news that the war in Europe was at an end. “All Gowen Field personnel assembled in front of headquarters. This was one of the largest groups ever to assemble at the Field and included crews, many ambulatory patients and all civilian personnel. The Governor of Idaho, Charles C. Gossett was the official guest.” Photo courtesy of Idaho Military History Museum.\n\nB-24 bomber crew training continued to be the primary mission of Gowen Field as the war in the Pacific theater was still ongoing. By the close of May, Gowen Field’s aircraft inventory included 29 B-24Js, 4 B-24Ds, 9 B-24Es, 1 TB-24D, 8 P-38s, 3 L-5s, 1 C-45F, 2 BF-13s, 2 C-47s, 2 AT-6Cs and 1 AT-6A.\n\nAnother Japanese balloon bomb was sighted in Oregon in May. The code word for them was “Paper”. An L-5 was dispatched to take photos and 2 P-38s were standing by at the Ontario Airport to intercept and attempt to shoot it down. The attempt was not successful and they returned to Gowen Field “without having made any further contact with the ‘paper.’”\n\nThe May historical recorded also noted that Gowen Field set a record for bomb bases of the Fourth Air Force in maintenance. The percentage of aircraft in commission was consistently the highest in the Fourth Air Force. The base was “commended by the Inspectors General for the job we were doing and setting an all-time high record for this Field in the number of hours flown without a fatality.”\n\nPost V-E day meant a return to normal duties and prospects of a long, costly war in the Pacific. Then came word of the dropping of the atomic bombs and Japan’s acceptance of the Potsdam ultimatum; the war was over! “The sudden cessation of the war produced a riotous, boisterous, exuberant two day holiday celebration.” On August 15, Ceremonies were held in front of the base headquarters.\n\nWord was awaited from higher headquarters as to what the changes to the base would be. On August 30, Commanding General Hale of the Fourth Air Force paid a visit and stated that no changes were forth coming. “The training program will continue until cancelled by higher headquarters.”\n\nOne thing that did change was crews from other bases came to Gowen Field for Proficiency training which caused a number of problems that the historical record detailed at length. Change was inevitable and word arrived in early September that the training program was to be “totally abandoned for the present and that the primary mission of the base was to be concentrated on the processing of prospective discharges through the newly established separation squadron.” On September 13, 1945, Gowen Field became one of 145 separation centers to aid the army in clearing the backlog of men awaiting discharge.\n\nThis photograph is captioned Chaplain Joop Bids Dischargees Farwell. Photo courtesy of Idaho Military History Museum.\n\nOn September 15, the Gowen Beacon announced that Gowen Field had received a Flying Safety Award. From July 15th to September 5th Gowen had the best flying record in the Fourth Air Force and won the Division’s Flying Safety campaign over all other Fourth Air Force Bases. During this period, 23,654 hours were flown without any fatal accidents and 12,746 hours without a major accident.\n\nOn October 21, 1945, Mountain Home Air Base became a sub-base of Gowen Field. This added “4198 officers and enlisted men from Mountain Home” to the Gowen Field morning report. By October 31, the number of discharged personnel from the new separation center was 296. It was anticipated that the number would eventually reach 300 per day. Thirty-five surplus aircraft were transferred to Kingman, Arizona. To create flying time for rated pilots, they were the ones who ferried the surplus aircraft.\n\nWith the transfer of Mountain Home personnel, Gowen Field once again had a band; dances, concerts and parades were back on the docket. (The September 1945 history of the MHAAF Band noted that they were very short on band members and were limited to “one small dance group.”)\n\nOn October 22, 1945, Gowen University opened. Courses offered included English, US History, Algebra, Geometry, Chemistry, Physics, English Composition, Trigonometry, French, Spanish, Accounting, Physics, Machine Shop Mathematics, Blueprint Reading, Small Business, Advertising and Bookkeeping. Instructors were those with extensive training in the subject or had practical experience at teaching. Roughly 500 were enrolled with 16 full time and 5 part-time instructors.\n\nOctober 1945 is the last history in the archive. Thanks to various newspapers, we can fill in some of the missing pieces. Initially the base was going to stay open but by mid-October Boise’s newspaper, The Idaho Daily Statesman, was publishing reports that the base would be abandoned. Other papers picked up the story as well, the Separation center was scheduled to close on November 30th and “the move is preliminary to inactivation of the entire field, which will follow about January 1.”\n\nA follow up article in the December 19 Spokesman-Review stated the Gowen Field soldiers were “being transferred as rapidly as possible” and that the inactivation will leave about 2000 men …which “will be transferred as rapidly as possible.” The Separation Center closed on November 29, 1945 “having discharged 5869 men [total], 3937 enlisted men and 1932 officers.” By March 1946, only a handful of men remained. Notices began going out regarding sale of desks, trailers and equipment and the word deactivation replaced inactivation.\n\nIn December 1945, the War Department released information “which said operation of a national guard air force of perhaps 200 first-line planes would require facilities much greater than pre-war days and suggest[ed] the use of airfields now being abandoned by the army.” Idaho’s Adjutant General Brigadier General Mervin G. McConnel stated that he “expects to see the establishment of an Idaho national guard air force as soon as congress takes up national guard matters.” He was correct. Gowen Field was handed over to the city and then re-leased to the Idaho National Guard but that is another chapter of Idaho’s military history.\n\nGowen Field like other military installations had several VIP and Hollywood visitors. In July 1943, the British ambassador to the United States, his wife, Lady Halifax, and their son, Lt. Richard Wood, made Boise, Idaho their first stop on a tour of the northwest. This was a notable visit and received a great deal of media coverage.\n\nOther celebrities included Ann Sothern, film star and later television star; Sergeant Joe Louis, world heavyweight champion boxer, and Sgt. ‘Sugar’ Ray Robinson, the future world welterweight and middleweight champion; ex-world heavyweight champion boxer and film actor Max Baer and his film actor brother, Buddy Baer also visited Gowen Field. Radio singing star and film star Frances Langford visited Gowen Field in August 1945, but her visit was somewhat overshadowed by the announcement that Japan had surrendered, thus ending the war.\n\nEpilogue. In summing up the war years on Gowen field, the following quote is from the October 1945 historical archive: “From September 1, 1943 until training was discontinued at Gowen Field during the last days of September 1945, a total of 1,467 Combat Crews were trained in the CCTS [Combat Crew Training School] program. During that time a total of 192,173 training hours were flown in B-24 aircraft.\n\n“To interpret this set of figures it might be said that a B-24 flying at the normal cruising speed for that type aircraft would have flown a total of 42,669,410 miles or a distance equivalent to 1,308 complete trips around the world at the Equator during these 192,173 training hours.”\n\n“If we were to take the 35 bombing missions required for a tour of duty in the 8th Air Force…and estimating that each crew trained at Gowen Field completed one-half a tour, or 17.5 missions, it might be said that the crews trained here possibly flew as many as 25,700 combat missions. Projecting this assumption further and estimating that each crew dropped on each mission the normal bomb load of a B-24 flying from England (3 tons) Gowen crews could possibly have dropped as many as 154 million pounds of bombs, or a total bomb load that was more than 70 times the weight of bombs dropped on Britain during the worst thirty-day period of the Blitz.”\n\nBoise’s newspaper the Idaho Daily Statesman printed the following: “Since Sept 1, 1943, when Gowen Field became a combat crew training school, 192,173 hours of flying time have been registered. At the rate of 150 miles an hour this would constitute 92,000,000 miles, or the approximate distance from the earth to the sun.”\n\nTo learn more about Gowen Field, see the book Images of Aviation, Gowen Field, by Yancy Mailes and Gary Keith. It also includes many vintage photographs.\n\nMountain Home Army Air Base, now Mountain Home Air Force Base (1942-1945; 1948-current)\n\nMountain Home Army Air Base did not come about until 1942. The historical record reads, “It was in June 1942 that the Army Air Corps training program touched Mountain Home for the first time. By then it had become apparent that additional bases for heavy bombardment training, constructed on a scale seldom before approached, were urgently required to support the rising crescendo of battle. On all fronts there was a need for more and bigger bombers.\n\n“On 20 June 1942, the District Engineer of the United States Engineering Corps in Portland, Oregon, received telephonic instructions from the Division Engineer, followed by telegraphic instructions from the Commanding General, Second Air Force, to investigate immediately a proposed site for an air base in the vicinity of Jerome, Idaho. Subsequent investigation led to the choice of the present Mountain Home site, as an alternative.\n\n“The decision was dictated by engineering advantages and low costs. Construction of the base dates from 30 November 1942. Contractors’ equipment was on the ground and dirt was flying as the year closed.” Mountain Home was the rail stop for the base and was recorded as 43 miles from Boise. The Base itself is 12 ½ miles from Mountain Home and 55 miles from Boise.\n\nWork progressed rapidly. The historical record continues with: “The entire station, covering an area of nine square miles and costing $12,857,000 (project total, as of date of completion), was built in less than nine months. [In 2020 dollars, that construction cost equates to around $213,156,000.] Construction consistently ran ahead of schedule. The Base was functioning within four months of the beginning of construction. Runways were in use in seven months. Even as construction proceeded, officers and men began moving in.”\n\nThe official name of the base was Army Air Base, Mountain Home, Idaho; the date of organization was January 28, 1943 when Lieutenant Colonel Carlos L. Reavis was assigned to the base from Gowen Field where he had served as Gowen’s Base Administrative Inspector. Reavis assumed command of Mountain Home on January 29, 1943. On February 25, 1943, the base was assigned to the 15th Bombardment Training Wing.\n\nMore changes quickly followed. The first two enlisted men arrived at Mountain Home from the Air Base in Pocatello on February 9, 1943, others soon arrived from Gowen Field. On March 24, 1943, Col Arthur J. Melanson succeeded Lt Col Reavis as the new commander having been transferred there from Gowen Field. On May 15, 1943 the base was assigned to II Bomber Command.\n\nOn August 7, 1943 the field officially opened at 1516 o’clock Mountain Time. The first plane landed at 1527 (3:27 p.m.) that same day, a B-24 piloted by “Pilot Tipp”.\n\nOn August 21, 1943, the Army Air Forces accepted the Base from the Army Engineers and in the same ceremony, awarded J.A. Terteling & Sons of Boise, the general contractor who built the base, the Army-Navy “E” for excellence in construction achievement award.\n\nPhoto attributed to August 22, 1943 Idaho Statesman\n\nThe historical record notes other units activated and transferred to Mountain Home in rapid succession. The Bases newspaper The Sage (short for sagebrush) rolled out its first edition on May 26, 1943. In July, The Idaho Statesman began printing the paper at no cost to the Base. The last concrete was poured into the runways on June 19, 1943 and the Base Headquarters moved from their temporary location to their permanent buildings on the 9th of July. The Base Theater opened on July 15, 1943.\n\nThe rapid growth was noted in a strength report; on May 31, 1943 there were 35 officers and 161 enlisted personnel. By August 31, 1943 there were 558 officers and 3,811 enlisted personnel. The record also noted, “The Base was built for the training of heavy bombardment crews. All functions serve this end.” Much of the credit for the rapid development went to Col Melanson. The primary reason he was transferred from Gowen Field to Mountain Home was “to take advantage of your exceptional ability in organizing new air bases.”\n\nOn September 3, 1943 the base chapel opened and plans were formulated to establish a chapel choir. A few days later on the 14th, First Security Bank of Idaho opened an office on base adjacent to the Finance office.\n\nMorale was not as high as it could have been due to the remoteness of the base. The enlisted men’s service club was not yet open, the Post Exchange was open but the cafeteria facilities were not and the publication of the base newspaper had recently been suspended. The city of Mountain Home was not large enough to provide a great deal of R&R, the record details other morale issues such as AWOLs, even a General Court Martial. Eventually Special Services was able to mediate some of this with weekly dances in the Service Club, periodic G.I. movies, Bingo, variety shows and various sports team competition. Hostesses for the dances were brought in from Boise, Mountain Home and Glens Ferry. This was also a large morale boost.\n\nAlthough no specific date was given, the base newspaper resumed production again by the Idaho Daily Statesman. Late October, the hospital also began its own newspaper called Caduceus. The base was still undergoing growing pains and flare pots were still in use on one of the runways due to lighting contract issues. Facilities were still inadequate.\n\nThanksgiving celebrations improved morale and the men were allowed to invite guests to the holiday meal. A large number of promotions also added to a festive spirit. Several weddings also took place, the first on the base was held just a week before Thanksgiving. The base Band archive noted that the weather was so cold, outdoor playing was nearly impossible.\n\nThe base also finally had a new main gate. Up to this time, a tarpaper shack had functioned as the gate. In December the base became an Overseas Training Unit and Mountain Home Army Air Base became an Army Air Field. Lieutenant Colonel Clarence D. Barnhill replaced Colonel Melanson who had been transferred to Kansas as station commandant.\n\nPhoto from December 11, 1943 The Sage\n\nChristmas was also a welcome event and the chapel services were well attended. General Orders No. 6 suspended all duties at the Field that day except “the necessary guard and fatigue”.\n\nIn January, the city of Mountain Home asked the Field for a parade and speakers for a Fourth War Loan rally which was held on January 25, 1944. “The field responded with a three blocks-long parade of men and equipment, a formation of airplanes which flew over the town during the parade.” The rally was a success, $10,000 bonds and stamps were sold ($147,686.00 in 2020 dollars). The first radio broadcast from the Field took place on January 31 when Boise’s KIDO made a special broadcast from the hospital. They interviewed six men who had seen extensive action overseas.\n\nThe Field’s hospital report noted that the hospital capacity was 169 beds and it also had a dental clinic. The hospital also provided convalescent training to recondition the sick physically with planned and organized physical rehabilitation. Included in this was an educational program. The hospital had a loud speaker system in each ward so patients could keep abreast of the latest news and listen to popular radio programs.\n\nOn February 18, 1944, the Field held an open house and over 400 citizens from Mountain Home braved the cold weather to see the review which was held on the ramp. Men and equipment participated. The open house created a very favorable impression with the people of Mountain Home. For most, this was the first time most had seen the Field since the opening ceremonies.\n\nThe Idaho Daily Statesman informed the Field early March that it once again could no longer print the Field’s paper, The Sage due to a shortage of help. The Special Services offices took on the task of producing the paper. Fortunately, this was short lived as a new publishing house was located in April. Along with the previously mentioned forms of entertainment, a baseball team was formed “with great interest.”\n\nIn May 1944 the Combat Crew Training School at Peterson Field, Colorado was transferred to Mountain Home Army Air Field. This filled many of the ongoing shortages at Mountain Home AAF. The first contingent of WACs also arrived though no specific date is given. Both greatly increased morale at the Field.\n\nIn June 1944 the Field officially changed from an Operational Training Unit to a Combat Crew Training School. The recent arrival of personnel from Colorado made the transition much smoother.\n\nThe Fifth War Loan Drive was held and the Field’s soldiers to include the WACs marched in a parade and bond rally in Mountain Home. The Field’s band provided the music. A few days after the rally, members of the Mountain Home Boy Scouts were the guests of the Field as a reward for their bond selling activities. They were given a tour of a B-24 and then taken to a baseball game between Mountain Home and Gowen Field. Both these events cemented the friendship between Mountain Home and the Field which still exists today.\n\nOn July 13, Major General Uzal G. Ent, Commanding General of the 2nd Air Force paid a visit to the Field and held a question and answer session. The Field received a letter of commendation shortly thereafter stating that it had the lowest accident rate for the month.\n\nIn October, Lieutenant Colonel Barnhill was transferred to Kansas and Colonel Sluman assumed command. This was the first of many changes in command.\n\nTo illustrate the number of people at the Field, the archive noted that during October 1944, 31,700 pounds of bread, 31,584 quarts of milk and 1,545 gallons of ice cream were consumed. As of October 31, 1944, there were 460 officers, 5 Warrant Officers and 3,234 enlisted assigned to the Field. Additionally, there were 707 civilians, 711 trainee officers and 1,038 trainee enlisted. The Field also officially became Mountain Home Army Air Field, Mountain Home. It was previously known as Army Air Field, Mountain Home.\n\nIn December 1944, Christmas festivities began in earnest and the club was decorated with wreaths and a “huge Christmas tree dominating the lounge. ‘Christmas goodies’ were on hand at all times and were given without charge to all enlisted men.” Christmas was a holiday for all and no flying was to be done. Weather was once again impacting training and only about 77% of flying hours were achieved.\n\nThe Combat Crew Training Station won the 2nd Air Force Safety Program Contest scoring more points than any other B-24 base in the 2nd Air Force. The Field underwent a constant turnover of personnel which created acute shortages of some specialties, even the Band had to cut back on its performances.\n\nOn February 15, 1945, the Field was transferred to the 4th Air Force which also brought a new commander in Colonel John H. Gibson. The Field’s personnel shortages were somewhat alleviated under the 4th Air Force structure and morale went up considerably.\n\nThe archive noted that Mountain Home’s Red Cross came to the field periodically to do sewing for the soldiers. Simple alterations, sewing on additional stripes and replacing the 2nd Air Force patch with the 4th Air Force patch were greatly appreciated.\n\nPhoto from the Fields newspaper The Sage\n\nIn April 1945, the Field received a commendation from the 4th Air Force. The Fields safety record as of April 15th was 11, 507 hours flown without a major aircraft accident. The Field also received word that no further B-24 crews would be assigned to the Field for training. The plan was to change to B-32 aircraft. The training for B-32s was anticipated to begin in June. Mountain Home Army Air Field would be the first CCTS to train B-32 crews. Planes and crews arrived and all began the transition to the new mission.\n\nMay 8, 1945 brought the wonderful news of Victory in Europe, VE day, and a celebration was held at the Field. The Field also announced that a Base Insignia for the Field had been designated. (The historical archive noted that rabbits were a continuous problem for the Field. This is likely why a rabbit was incorporated into the insignia)\n\nGeneral George C. Marshall was scheduled to visit the Field on May 30, 1945. It is unknown if he actually arrived, no further mention was made in the archive nor in various newspapers.\n\nOn June 25th, the Field received word that the B-32 crews were being transferred to Fort Worth, Texas and that the B-32 training had been “discontinued for this station.” The archive noted that they “departed in eight B-32 type aircraft.” Other B-32 crews were transferred in July.\n\nThe new mission would be the B-29 aircraft. The Field was also transferred back to the 2nd Air Force but it was to be for only about two months. In line with the transfer to 2nd Air Force, Colonel George A. Blakey assumed command of the Field on June 23rd. The archive also noted that all of this created a tremendous amount of confusion and extra work. By June 23, three B-29 aircraft were at the Field.\n\nAlso in June, a Japanese Balloon Bomb was reported to have landed near Grandview. The matter was reported to the Base Intelligence Officer. The archive contained no further details on this incident. (See Historical Note in Gowen Field History for background on Japanese Balloon bombs.)\n\nIn July the Field received word that “all combat crew personnel presently stationed at Mountain Home are being assigned to Gowen Field, Boise, Idaho.” They were then placed on temporary duty at Mountain Home. Upon completion of the assignment, they would be transferred to Salinas, California. B-29 crew training was to begin mid-August 1945. By the 31st of July, 26 B-29s were at the Field.\n\nOn August 14, came the joyous news that that Japan had surrendered unconditionally, the war was over! August 15th and 16th were proclaimed as holidays by President Truman. On August 24, the Field was transferred back to 4th Air Force and was designated as the 426th Army Air Forces Base Unit.\n\nThis also scrapped the B-29 training program and all the effort that had gone into setting it up. Those at the Field for this training, 50 crews, would be transferred to Salina, Kansas. They left on August 28th. There was also speculation that the Field would close but on August 31st it was announced that 84 B-24 crews would be arriving from Nevada the first part of September 1945 for proficiency training. Arrival of 116 more crews was announced on September 7th.\n\nThis too was short lived as on September 27 it was announced that all B-24 crew training to include proficiency and phase training at the Field would end. All enlisted combat crew trainees would be removed from flight status and most would be transferred to base permanent party. The following day it was announced by the 4th Air Force that the Separation program had priority over flying training. This appears to have been Nationwide.\n\nOn October 5, 1945, the Field was informed that it would be placed “on temporary inactive status as a sub-base of Gowen Field”. Personnel were to be moved to Gowen Field. Many of the Field’s aircraft were declared excess. Equipment and salvageable materials were to be turned in. The Field was being inactivated.\n\nA historical report in the archive noted, “this base is inactivating October 5th (plus 30 days)”. On October 21, 1945, Mountain Home Air Base became a sub-base of Gowen Field. This added “4198 officers and enlisted men from Mountain Home” to the Gowen Field morning report.\n\nThe archive for October noted the transfers, turn-ins, discharges etc., as the Field shut down. The commissary was scheduled to close on October 20th. Beginning October 23rd, the letterhead read Headquarters, Gowen Field Sub Base, Mountain Home, Idaho. The last entry in the archive is dated November 5, 1945. The Field was in the final stages of shutdown but was not quite complete.\n\nFrom the book Images of America, Mountain Home Air Force Base, we learn, “from the end of 1945 until August 1948, responsibility for the base changed hands from Gowen Field to Walla Walla Army Air Field in Washington State. Eventually, in December 1948, a small services squadron arrived and prepared the outpost for a grand reopening as Mountain Home Air Force Base.” This was short lived however as on April 25, 1950, the base was again placed on inactive status when the unit left. The base was vacant for about a year until an air resupply and communication unit arrived.\n\nToday Mountain Home Air Force Base is home to the 366th Fighter Wing. Click here for the units that comprise the 366th FW and their respective missions: MHAFB Units\n\nAlthough not included above, several celebrities visited the Field as they did throughout the country to raise morale and aid the war effort. Mountain Home visitors included: Sgt Max and Buddy Baer of boxing fame who made two visits, “Tiny Hill” and his orchestra, Ted Weems and his orchestra, and Curt Sykes Orchestra.\n\nTo learn more about Mountain Home Army Air Force/Air Force Base, see the book Images of America, Mountain Home Air Force Base by Yancy Miles. It also includes many vintage photographs.\n\nPocatello Army Air Base/Air Field (1942-1945; 1954-1965)\n\nEarly in May 1942, two Army Engineers made an inspection of a sagebrush-covered site nine miles northwest of Pocatello, Idaho. It was announced that construction would soon begin at this location on an Army Air Base, which would cost between $6,000,000 - $8,000,000.\n\nThe area examined was one and a half miles west of Pocatello’s McDougall Airport in Power County, and close to the American Falls Reservoir. It was an almost level stretch of land, known as “Michaud Flats.” Initially a site of about 1,500 acres was checked. This was later expanded to roughly 3,200 acres.\n\nThere were to be three runways, each approximately 7,000 feet long. The Base was to have a force of approximately 3,500 men and 400 officers. Construction was to be by private contract under the direction of the Army Engineers.\n\nIt was estimated that the Base would be finished by the 15th of October. By May 22, work was under way, the contractors were Morrison-Knudson and J.W. Brennan Construction. The Base was to be one of the bases which the 2nd Air Force would use for training heavy bombardment units and it would also employ between 400 to 600 civilians.\n\nBy August 5, most of the sagebrush had been cleared and workers had begun to lay runways. Some buildings had been finished and others were almost completed. On October 19, the Base Complement arrived by train from Pleasant Grove, Utah at 6:00 p.m. This is recorded as the date the Base was activated.\n\nThe base was still very much under construction; there was no post exchange, no theater, no recreation hall. Neither the Officers Mess nor the Consolidated Mess were organized. The weather was extremely cold and the bleak Idaho landscape looked very forbidding. However, the new men had not been forgotten by the people of Pocatello. The American Legion had made arrangements to serve coffee and doughnuts in the messhall for the new men.\n\nActive operational training soon began and on October 27, the base was officially placed on a twenty-four hour per day, seven day a week basis. Ground classes were held at the base school building and regular and frequent flights were undertaken. A gunnery school had been set up and a low altitude bombing range was built near Rupert, Idaho.\n\nA machine gun range two miles wide and six miles long was built near Aberdeen, in Bingham County, Idaho. This was also described as an air-to-ground machine gun range. On December 15, 1942, it was announced that effective immediately, a high-altitude bomb range near Arco, Idaho would be put into use. This range was about three miles wide and four miles long, located in Butte County, Idaho, about twenty miles southeast of Arco and about nine miles north of big Southern Butte.\n\nThe Arco Advertiser ran a story in its December 25, 1942 edition that stated in part, “Practice bombs containing quite a large amount of black powder will be dropped on the range from B-17 ‘Flying Fortresses’ flying at high altitudes. They will cause no material damage, …but will create quite a flash of flame and smoke when they explode. Bombardier trainees will thus be able to tell how close they come to their targets even at night.”\n\nThe Air Base rapidly became a much better place to live. Regular bus service was established between the Air Base and Pocatello with fares of 15¢ for one way and 25¢ for a round trip ticket. It wasn’t long before dances were being given for the enlisted men in Pocatello. The American Legion Post was credited with this.\n\nThe Post Exchange expanded and by November 1st, had moved into its permanent quarters. The Consolidated Mess and Officer’s Mess were soon operational. Plans included publication of a Base newspaper under the Special Services Officer. It was to be printed twice a month and was given the name Bombardier. The first issue ran on November 26, 1942.\n\nThanksgiving dinner was held at the Consolidated Mess with an extensive holiday menu. A Base theater soon opened and a base band was formed under the leadership of Chief Warrant Officer Crockett Baxter who had 35 years of experience as an Army band leader.\n\nNovember 1942 was the stormiest on record at Pocatello and by December it made a severe impact on available flying time. Rumors circulated that the base would be closed down for the winter. Major General Robert Olds, Commanding General of the 2nd Air Force, issued a statement that weather conditions would not be allowed to interfere with the bomber crew training and if necessary, they would be moved to another part of the country. This proved to be the case when Secret orders arrived on December 21 transferring two Bomb Groups to Pyote, Texas.\n\nSpecial efforts went into Christmas at the base. Trees from the Caribou National Forrest were decorated and placed in the day rooms, Officer’ Club and hospital. The people of Pocatello helped provide decorations and gifts and also helped entertain the soldiers. On Christmas Eve, seven minstrels went about the base singing Christmas carols. Services were held in the chapel.\n\nThe work schedule was scaled back for Christmas day and most of the men on the base were able to take it easy. The Christmas menu was also a feast and the menu comprised several lines of the archive. A New Year’s Eve dance at the Officers’ Club celebrated the new year and served as a farewell to the departing Bomb Groups.\n\n1943 photo of Pocatello Air Base Main Gate\n\nThe Pocatello Army Air Base went on the air Jan. 29th over KSEI. The initial program featured the base dance orchestra. In April, the broadcast was revised to a weekly variety program and was broadcast from the Recreation Hall. When the enlisted men’s Service Club was completed, the show was moved there. It became known as “Pass In Review” and broadcast every Thursday at 9:30 p.m. It became very popular and the Public Relations Office received mail from “enthusiastic listeners all over southeastern Idaho.”\n\nAlthough bomber crew training was suspended from January to April, the personnel at the base were not idle. Regular training was carried on for both officer and enlisted men which included a six-hour course in camouflage in January 1943 along with a special supply course. Physical training and chemical warfare training were also conducted.\n\nThe bomber crews made full use of the bombing ranges constructed the previous fall. “Being used in April were the Arco, Twin Butte and Taber bombing ranges, and two target ranges in the immediate vicinity of the base. On May 17, announcement was made of the opening of a new machine gun range just east of the base. Required weapons training for officers and enlisted men of the Base Complement was provided by the use of a range constructed on the site of an old C.C.C. Camp east of Pocatello.” Another new phase of training was Celestial Navigation-navigating by the stars.\n\nThe Field’s soldiers also formed sports teams. There was softball, volleyball, and a boxing team. The citizens of Pocatello extended the use of tennis and golf facilities to base personnel. The archives also mention base personnel participation in various city parades and rodeos. The also periodically received special visitors. Character actor Andy Devine visited the Base in May and in July, Fred Waring a musician, bandleader and radio and television personality dedicated his coast to coast program “Victory Tunes” to the Pocatello Army Air Base.\n\nIn September it became evident that the 1943 potato crop would be the largest on record and the farmers faced a severe labor shortage. The Air Base personnel stepped in to help. Three-day passes were made available for the express purpose of aiding the potato farmers. It also allowed the men to earn extra money. The archives also noted that some base personnel participated in War Bond drives throughout the area, even traveling to Jackson, Wyoming.\n\nIn October 1943, a new type of training was added to the Pocatello Army Air Base with the arrival of the 362nd Fighter Squadron. Their aircraft was the P-39. The 362nd was reported to be the first fighter squadron ever to be stationed in Idaho. Its time at the base was short, it completed its advanced training and departed on November 7th. October also saw the arrival of the 464th Bomb Group and the Headquarters of the 20th Tow Target Squadron.\n\nThe base held an open house on October 24, 1943. “Thousands of visitors from all over southeastern Idaho took advantage of the opportunity to look over the base, and many guests ate in the Consolidated Mess or the Officers Mess. They were entertained by a demonstration of formation flying by both bombers and fighters. All parts of the base except the restricted area were inspected.” At the review, medals were presented to several service members as well as two wives whose husbands were reported missing in action. The Bombardier ran a special fourteen-page anniversary issue.\n\nFor Christmas 1943, enlisted men were authorized to bring guests to the holiday meal. Wives, relatives, and guests were charged 75¢ for the meal. Officers and guests were also to be charged 75¢. This menu also filled several lines of the report and it noted “is it any wonder that many a civilian accepted an invitation to eat at the base rather than vice-versa? Ration books are not so liberal to allow for sumptuous feasts.” Also in December an ice-skating rink was established and skilled instructors gave free lessons.\n\nTo aid heavy bombardment training, an extension of the ramp was completed and turned over to the base mid-December. The ramp doubled the available parking capacity of the base and “its forty thousand feet have been put to good use.”\n\nDecember 1943’s weather conditions were much better than the previous year. The archives noted that in December 1942 crews were able to complete less than 25% of their training. December 1943 saw only four days in which no flying could be done.\n\nTraffic control tower photo from 14 June 1944 The Fighter Pilot\n\nOn or about January 5, 1944, actress Claire Carleton and actor Frank Sully visited the base. They toured the base, visited the hospital patients, even served food in the Consolidated Mess hall. They also took part in the evening “Pass in Review” radio broadcast.\n\nThe archives noted that flying weather in January 1944 was much better than January 1943 and the field was only closed in on one day. The 464th Bomb group completed their training and left late January and early February 1944. The 464th was the only OTU (Over Seas Training Unit) to receive all phases of its training at Pocatello. They were treated to a farewell party and a musical review entitled “Strictly G.I.” which was written, directed, and produced by one of the base’s band members.\n\nFebruary 21, 1944 brought a significant change to Pocatello Army Air Base. That date was the effective date for Headquarters 2nd Air Force’s General Order No. 23 which changed the assignment of Pocatello AAF and “all Second Air Force units stationed thereat” from the 15th Bombardment Operational Training Wing to the 72nd Fighter Wing. The first fighter group was expected the first part of March.\n\nThe 476th Fighter Group arrived on March 25, 1944. The new aircraft training program was for the P-47. The Base also picked up three C-78’s and two BT-13’s as well as a crash rescue boat. The Base units received new designations and now included a WAC (Women’s Air Corp) unit although the WAC unit wasn’t organized until June. The name of the installation also changed. On March 20, 1944 it went from Pocatello Army Air Base to Pocatello Army Air Field. The P-47’s that arrived were referred to as “war-weary” and required quite a bit of maintenance work.\n\nBecause of the existence of a reservoir containing 57,000 surface acres of water near the end of the air-field runways, the new Field commander then called Commandant, arranged for the formation of a rescue launch crew which was manned by a medical man, a maintenance man, and 2 assistants, who were under the supervision of the Post Engineer. Although not discussed in this vignette, the archives document several reports of aircraft mishaps, some of which were fatal. This was the case at many training bases across the U.S.\n\nThe archives noted that personnel were very active in sporting competitions and bowling, ice skating, roller skating and skiing were now available, some in the city of Pocatello and some at the Field. It also noted that the theatre finally had padded chairs not wooden benches and more people were attending the events there. Day rooms were also a welcome addition. The Field also had a very active band which performed both at the Field and the city of Pocatello.\n\nThe archive also recorded “Another interesting bit of entertainment was found in the Indian dance put on by 60 of the Bannock-Shoshone Indians at the Field Theater, featuring Willie George, who once traveled with Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show as Master of Ceremonies. This program included the Hop, Tree, War, Snake, and Owl dances to the tune of raw-hide drums band music played by the older men of the tribe. Talent for this fine program came from the neighboring Fort Hall Indian Reservation.”\n\nThe Field’s personnel were also able to follow the progress of the war. “Developments in the global war are placed at the finger tips of base personnel through the opening of a new war information center in the outer lobby of the Field Theater. Daily news bulletins are on display and changes on the various fronts are shown with the receipt of latest dispatch wires. Displayed there are the latest news maps together with pertinent books for the war orientation program on the field.”\n\nIn June the Field became officially identified as a ‘Fighter Pilot Training Station’ instead of a ‘Combat Crew training School.” The Field’s newspaper also changed its name from Bombardier to The Fighter Pilot.\n\nFirst Pocatello Air Field Wedding photo from 21 June 1944 The Fighter Pilot\n\nThe later part of June (the dates vary by source), one WAC officer and four enlisted WACs arrived at the Field. By July, there were 39 enlisted WAC’s with 12 more on the way. They were the first WACs to be stationed at Pocatello Army Air Field. It was anticipated that others would soon follow and that a regular WAC section (unit) would be organized. By August, there were 61 WAC’s and 3 additional attached.\n\nPhoto from July 12, 1944 The Fighter Pilot\n\nThe maintenance issues with the P-47’s continued to be an issue into July. Landing gears were experiencing a lot of problems with loose nuts, bolts, rivets, washers to name a few, getting caught in the landing gear controls. The problem was severe enough that planes were grounded and factory inspectors, army inspectors and plant mechanics arrived from both Evansville and Farmingdale plants. Many of the planes also had multiple tech orders which had not been complied with further compounding the situation. It wasn’t until July 15 that the landing gear changes were complete.\n\nIn August 1944, an aviation unit from Mexico, the 201st Mexican Fighter Squadron, arrived at the Field for training. A new section was added to the Field which was called Section I. It was comprised of 2-3 officers and 20 enlisted men. These were the interpreters and instructors who would be used in training the Mexican unit. Three WACs also assisted with the interpretation and instruction. Up until August 4th, the responsibilities of the new section were classified Secret for most of the Field’s enlisted personnel.\n\nThe 201st Ground Echelon arrived on August 6. The unit came for instruction in American Army Air Forces methods of operating a combat squadron. The archives stated that Pocatello was “the only Field in the Second Air Force giving this Mexican training.” Six members of the 201st were in the medical field and received training at the Fields hospital.\n\nWhen Instruction began it included aircraft maintenance “organization of the Army, Military sanitation, interior guard duty, Basic English, marksmanship and care of clothing. The students showed themselves very eager to learn.” On August 16, a group of the 201st arrived and were met by the Field’s band who “played the Mexican National Anthem as the group disembarked from the train, and several other Mexican numbers as the men were making preparations to go to their new quarters.”\n\nThe men of the 201st expressed themselves as feeling at home because the climate and altitude reminded them of Mexico City. The Fighter Pilot had multiple articles about the unit, even one in Spanish, however the archives don’t hold any unit photos.\n\nOn 15th and 16th of September, both the American and the Mexican personnel joined in a celebration of the Mexican Independence Holiday. There were a number of celebratory events and Carlos Grimm, Mexican Consul from Salt Lake City, was present for some of them.\n\nThe archives noted that three classes of fighter pilot trainees were in progress during September. The Mexican unit was still in training and received a visit on September 21st from Major General Gustavo Salinas, Commanding General of the Mexican Air Force. He was accompanied by General George P. Tourtellot, Commanding General and Colonel Frank H. Mears, Deputy Commander respectively of the 72nd Fighter Wing. General Salinas was “highly pleased with the organization and status of the Mexican personnel.”\n\nThe latter part of September, two Women Air Force Service Pilots (WASPS) were assigned to Pocatello Army Air Field. Gloria W. Heath arrived on September 23rd, Mildred W. Gorssman arrived October 12th. Both were assigned to the Tow Target section as co-pilots. They flew B-26s which had been adapted to serve as tow-target planes. Grossman had transferred from Gowen Field.\n\nThe Tow Target section was transferred to Texas in November and the women were reassigned to the Fields base operations as administrative pilots flying Basic Training planes. Their final mission at the Field was to ferry two Basic Trainers from Pocatello to Dalhart, Texas. They were then transferred to the unit at Dalhart pending deactivation of the WASP on December 20, 1944. The archive recorded, “Both young women assigned here were college graduates and gave the appearance of being persons with poise and character.”\n\nIn October 1944, “Twenty new P-47’s were received direct from the factory for assignment to the Mexican Squadron. Mexican personnel made their own acceptance and flight tests.”\n\n“The training of the Mexican fighter pilots got underway on 22 October. These pilots had more flying experience than the AAF trainees, and proved to be well above average as a whole. They were not involved in any accidents during October. The training of the ground echelon of the 201st continued.” The only recorded accident by a member of the 201st was one of the pilot trainees ran out of gas and had to make an emergency landing about a mile from the field, heavily damaging the plane. This is believed to have occurred in early November 1944.\n\nIn November, the Field received word that the bulk of the personnel and equipment of the 265th AAF Base Unit at Pocatello would be transferred to Majors Field, Greenville, Texas. The direction was that “movement will be complete by 2400 30 November 1944.” This movement included pilot trainee sections, flying training and ground training personnel and flight line maintenance sections. It also transferred the 201st Mexican Fighter squadron to Greenville.\n\nThe P-47s and fighter planes were to transfer first with ground personnel traveling by train. The weather complicated things and the planes were weathered in but eventually the weather broke and the planes were able to take off.\n\nThe number of personnel transferred to Texas was 260 officers and 599 enlisted men and women. It is unclear if the 201st is part of this total. An additional 20 enlisted men were transferred to California. The Field was now under strength by about 362 personnel and it became necessary to reassign personnel from one department to another to keep all departments functioning properly.\n\nAlthough it is not known if anybody at Pocatello Army Air Field was aware of it at the time, the transfer of the training unit to Texas spelled the beginning of the end of the Field. “In December Pocatello Army Air Field’s mission of training fighter pilots for the Army Air Forces was discontinued, and Second Air Force Headquarters reported the field as surplus to Headquarters Army Air Forces.” Pocatello Army Air Field became a transient air base.\n\nAfter ensuring that “buildings and grounds be put in proper state of repair” by December 20, the units remaining at the Field were relieved from assignment to the 72nd Fighter Wing and placed under the jurisdiction of 2nd Air Force. “Twenty-eight enlisted men and one officer were selected to remain at this station as a cadre. The majority of the transfers to other 2nd Air Force and 72nd Fighter Wing stations took place between December 11-19, 1944.\n\nApproximately 235 men were placed on temporary duty status to assist with closing down the Field. As soon as they were no longer needed by their respective department heads, they were shipped out. Activities at the Field were closed down progressively during December 1944 as the inactivation of the Field was accomplished. The last edition of The Fighter Pilot ran on December 6, inactivation orders came through just before the next edition was sent to the presses.\n\nThe Field’s hospital patients who could not be returned to duty were transferred to AAF Regional Hospital in Kearns, Utah. A small dispensary was set up in the WACs dayroom.\n\nThe civilian staff was also cut. A Burley, Idaho newspaper article noted that a “former local stenographer, has discontinued her work at Pocatello army air base, since the base was closed up Saturday.” Arrangements were also made to transfer some of the civilian employees to Gowen Field to reduce the personnel shortages at Gowen Field.\n\nThe last history in the archive is dated January 1, 1945 and it lists the Fields strength as of 31 December 1944 as 5 officers and 28 enlisted men for a total of 33 personnel. However, the final chapter of the Pocatello Army Air Field is, at present, a mystery.\n\nThanks to the book The First Fifty Years: Michaud Flats, U.S. Army Base, Pocatello Regional Airport, we learn the following: “On February 20, 1949, for the sum of $1.00, the $4,000,000 Base with the Main Buildings and the land were deeded to the City of Pocatello by the War Surplus Administration, (quick claim deed with no strings attached). The building which became the Municipal Terminal [Pocatello Regional Airport] had been the Instrument Shop for the old Base.” Most of the buildings were dismantled and sold.\n\n(According to the Pocatello Airport’s webpage, “The airport and facilities were used for private aircraft operations between 1945 and 1949.” In 1951 the Pocatello airports municipal operations were moved to the former Pocatello Army Air Base location which was roughly two miles to the west.) “In January 1954, Pocatello was designated as the 943rd Air Reserve Squadron under the 256th Air Reserve Center in Boise. Members were considered part of the Air Force Ready Reserve. In 1955, Lt. Col. Clinton Murdock from Blackfoot, Idaho came up with an idea which was proposed at that time and which made its way up the chain of command until it was finally considered at Headquarters, U.S. Air Force in Washington D.C. The idea was that in time of enemy attacks, U.S. bombers who became airborne from their home bases would probably not be able to return to those bases as they would be likely enemy targets. Therefore, other secondary bases, to be called recovery bases, should be equipped and prepared to recover those bombers. Reserve Air Force members would train and make ready for this eventual[ity].\n\n“The idea was adopted nation-wide, and Lt.Col. Murdock received national recognition as a result. Pocatello was designated as one of the recovery bases and local Air Force Reservists were given the mission of making the local base adequate for the mission. Over a period of time, fire engines were secured (from the Navy) and other equipment was stockpiled. This program was carried out over the entire United State[s]. Later, due to cutbacks in funding, the program was discontinued and local reservists kept the Pocatello unit alive until early 1965. At this time, the Reserve Air Force activity was disbanded.”\n\nLt. Col Murdock, Idaho State Journal, 16 April 1961\n\nEpilogue The archives provide an insight to the happenings at the base/field but they don’t provide any numbers or names of those who passed through there. A document on the history of the INEL states that “Over 40,000 pilots were trained at the Pocatello Army Air Base and many flew day and night training missions over Twin Buttes Bombing Range and Arco High Altitude Bombing Range.”\n\nThe Base/Field had a photo section, a photo of the section appeared in the 22 September 1943 edition of the Bombardier. Unfortunately, not many of their photographs made it into the archive.\n\nAlthough his name is not listed in the archives, it is confirmed that Maynard H. Smith who earned a Medal of Honor during WWII, trained at the base and was in fact promoted there before departing for the European Theater. He was there from early November 1942 until early February or early March 1943, being promoted to Staff Sergeant on December 1, 1942.\n\nWilder Radar Bomb Scoring Site (1964-1993)\n\nIn July 1963, Idaho Senator Frank Church announced that a radar bomb scoring detachment which had been temporarily stationed at multiple sites throughout Idaho and eastern Oregon, was to be established at Wilder, Idaho in the fall of 1964. Senator Church stated that he had been told by the Air Force that “about 70 men are included in the detachment, which has been stationed at Vale Ore., for several months.”\n\nAlthough this was an Air Force facility, information about it is limited and there are reports that in 2005, the USAF records on the Radar Bomb Scoring Sites (RBS) were designated for destruction. A link to a USAF factsheet no longer works and contact with the USAF History office was unproductive.\n\nIn March 1966, Nampa, Idaho’s Idaho Free Press published a two-page article about the facility entitled “Spotlight on: The Beefeaters” which is quoted below with obvious typographical errors corrected. The article includes several photographs which unfortunately are not reproduceable due to the quality of the article. One of the photographs defines the mission of the facility: “To evaluate and determine the bombing, and electronic counter-measures reliability of Strategic Air Command aircrews under simulated combat conditions.”\n\n“Situated high on a hill on the Wilder-Adrian Highway west of Wilder and overlooking the winding Snake River, is one of Uncle Sam’s most useful peacetime training devices, the Beefeater: Bomb Plot, one of many radar bomb scoring sites located throughout this country. Although the Air Force detachment has been in this area since 1961 and permanently located at Wilder since January of 1964, it is surprising how few people know of its existence or its function.\n\n“When airmen from this detachment are in conversation with the local citizenry, these and other questions invariably are asked: What are you doing out there?, What does this mean to the local economy?, How many personnel do you have?, etc. Today, we are going to take the reader on a tour of the plot, introduce him to some of the personnel and instruct him in some of the facts of RBS simulated bomb missions and the sonic boom.\n\n“The detachment was organized in November, 1960, at Houston, Tex. Following a brief location in Astoria, Ore., the men and equipment moved to the Caldwell-Nampa area. They were first set up at Lake Lowell, then moved to Emmett, Payette and Vale before establishing the permanent site at Wilder.\n\n“How permanent are you? “We are as permanent as any military installation can be,” is the reply given by Major Raymond Davis, commander of the detachment. “These other sites were operated under a temporary basis and were never meant to be anything more.”\n\n“Quoting these facts, the major proves just how permanent the local site is: “The detachment size is 2.65 acres, owned by the U.S. Government. The pad is 200 by 200 feet and the access road is owned in a joint tenancy with Canyon County. Estimated dollar value of equipment and real estate is in excess of 2 million dollars.\n\n“All wooden structures were constructed by detachment personnel with all the materials being purchased on the local market. Within the next year there are plans to erect $10,000 worth of new building and pad equipment.\n\n“The mission behind all this expensive equipment, operated by highly trained men, is to test the effectiveness of all combat ready crews of the Strategic Air Command (SAC) bombers. Readiness of these crews must be kept at its zenith in peacetime in order to fulfill any future war-time mission.\n\n“Radar bomb scoring began in 1946 with 888 bomb releases for the year against a site in the San Diego area. Current operations see SAC bomber crews completing more than 20,000 simulated bomb drops monthly. During early phases of bomb scoring crews aimed at circles drawn on sand or other surfaces, then dropped sand bags or dummy bombs on these targets. Today highly sophisticated electronic apparatus scores the accuracy of the SAC crews. The target can be any object within the ‘eyes’ of scanning radar devices.\n\n“This electronic equipment used to score the accuracy of the ‘bomb’ drops is maintained and operated entirely by the local personnel. Radar bomb scoring permits bomber crews to receive invaluable training in the use of radar bombing against realistic targets, day and night in all kinds of weather. Using a combination of radio and radar contact between aircraft and RBS site, the effectiveness of combat crews is scored without having to drop a single bomb.\n\n“The RBS radars ‘lock on’ automatically on a plotting board. Just before the simulated release of the bomb, the aircraft transmits a tone to the RBS site by radio and indicates its point of simulated bomb release by stopping the tone. The target and the radar site have been precisely plotted on the tracking board prior to this action.\n\n“This computation allows RBS personnel to determine exactly if the target was hit, and it not, by how far and in what direction it was missed. A SAC-Federal Aviation Agency agreement assures a great degree of safety in the exercise of low-level flying, since civilian aircraft are informed which planned routes are in use by SAC bombers. During bad weather, no civilian aircraft are cleared along or through the routes while they are being used by the bombers.\n\n“Since there can be no one in this area, except perhaps a deaf person, who has missed hearing the sonic booms which are frequently made by bombers flying over the Wilder plot, a note should be made about these booms.\n\n“Many of these window-rattling blasts, which resemble the loud sound of a nearby thunderclap, are caused by B-58 bombers. When the aircraft exceeds the speed of sound, it pushes molecules of air ahead of it and the molecules are compressed to the point where shock waves are formed around the aircraft’s fuselage in a cone-shaped wave that reaches the ground with the resultant boom.\n\n“Loud and disconcerting as they are, sonic booms cannot cause damage to primary building structure or direct personal injury. Of the 89 men stationed with the local unit, 83 are married and [together they] have more than 100 children. Pay roll exceed $40,000 per month while lights, phone and other expenses to keep the site operative exceed $2,500 each month.\n\n“It is well known that some of the attractive features of a military career are the fringe benefits. Although there is no base exchange or commissary connected with the Wilder site many of the families prefer this type of location because it gives them an opportunity to blend their lives into the local community.\n\n“Complete medical care that one would have available at a large base cannot be furnished for an outfit this size; however, the men and their dependents receive hospitalization locally on a medi-care plan. Also a full-time medic co-ordinate is stationed with the unit. TSgt. Alvin Downing is qualified to administer shots and handle numerous other medical problems which arise. In approximately six more years he plans to retire from active military service and make his home here in Treasure Valley.\n\n“The detachment provides various types of entertainment and recreational equipment for the use of the airmen and their dependents. The unit now has 3 tents, 6 sleeping bags, 2 boats with motors and other necessary camping gear which can be checked out for use on a first come first served basis.\n\n“For the golfer, memberships are purchased in the Caldwell Golf Association. These may be used by the men, free of charge, and two sets of clubs are provided for those who have none of their own. In the summertime a softball team is sponsored to play in one of the local leagues. Uniforms, equipment and membership fees are furnished for players.\n\n“This last autumn the avid hunters and marksmen formed a Beefeater Rod and Gun Club, named for the site which wears this name officially in all Air Force records. An area below the hill, on which the pad is located, has been prepared for target practice for members of this club.\n\n“For the hobbyist and do-it-yourselfer, automotive and electronic equipment may be checked from entertainment centers. Although many of the personnel and their families are busy just being ‘families,’ many more are actively engaged in serving their communities in whatever capacity they can.\n\n“Major Davis, of Dallas, Tex., assumed his duties as commander of the Beefeater Bomb Plot in June last year, following the retirement of Major Richard Severin. He lives in Caldwell with his wife, Imy, daughter, Debb and dachshund, Katrina. The Davises are members of the Caldwell Memorial Hospital Association.\n\n“Second in command is Captain Ronald L. Norton, a bachelor, who has been located here since April 1964. Norton spends a lot of his spare time meeting and working with the Boise Association of Model Railroaders, a Treasure Valley Club of which he is a member, along with 13 other model railroad hobbyists. He will leave this area this month to report for a new assignment in Japan.” The article went on to name other personnel at the installation and their various community involvements.\n\nIn May 1993, Wilder received the news that the facility was to close as part of the Base Closure and Realignment Commission or BRAC. The Twin Falls newspaper, The Times-News carried the story. “The commander of the Air Force’s Wilder Radar Bomb Scoring Site, scheduled to close in mid-1994, said he and his men will be sorry to leave southwestern Idaho. ‘Of all the radar detachments across the United States, we’ve had the absolute best community relations,’ Lt. Col. James Prideaux said Friday [May 28, 1993]. ‘This is where our friends are, our lives. It’s going to be hard to leave.’\n\nThe May 29, 1993 The Times-News in Twin Falls, Idaho reported, “The Air Force announced the shutdown Thursday. It is among changes affecting 42 states that take into account base closings and realignments already underway as well as the 1993 Base Closure and Realignment Commission, which is due to report to Congress on July 1. The changes reflect efforts to save money, reduce the overall size of the Air Force and adjust to post-Cold War needs.”\n\nThe article noted that the installation then employed 46 active duty and two civilian personnel. It was also credited with putting an estimated $3.2 million per year into the areas economy which included over $1 million in payroll and housing allowances.\n\nAn Air Force public affairs officer in South Dakota, which also had an RBS, stated that “The inactivation is a result of reduced strategic requirements, low utilization rates and operating restrictions.” The Air Force would transfer the military personnel to other units and the civilian workers “probably also would be given an opportunity to be assigned elsewhere.”\n\nTwo former commanders at the site, Ned Kerr and Jim Scherer, had settled in Canyon county after retirement. Kerr who commanded the site from 1975-1978 stated “I’m sorry to see that it’s going to close because I think its been mutually beneficial between the Air Force and Canyon County, economically and socially.”\n\nEpilogue: Along with the various RBS scattered throughout the United States, the Air Force also had RBS railroad trains which traveled around the country. There are no known visits to Idaho but there was a report that one of the trains was to make a stop in Spokane, Washington in 1968. There is a YouTube video of one such train at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6UjTHiIw04 The video is vintage film and runs about 18 minutes.\n\nWilder, Idaho has also served as home to various units of the Idaho Army National Guard. Some of these units date as far back as 1927. There are no units currently stationed there but the National Guard’s anti-drug team has an office there and the Idaho Office of Emergency Management uses it as a COOP (Continuity of Operations) site.
