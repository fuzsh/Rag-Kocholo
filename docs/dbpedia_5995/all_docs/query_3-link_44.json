        "text": "Law degree, Miles College\n\nQ. What exactly do you do on your job?\n\nA. I am a defense attorney that plans strategies for individual cases that I handle. I do legal research in order to brush up on policies and laws.\n\nQ. What is a typical day like on your job?\n\nA. A typical day for me is waking up at 5:30 a.m. and running 2 miles. I make coffee and check my e-mail, the basic morning things. During the week I may have a hearing that I have to attend, which average about one per day. I don't have a secretary, so all of the clerical work that needs to be done is done by me. I also manage the Celebration Station reception hall next door.\n\nQ. What is the favorite thing about your occupation?\n\nA. I really like the fact that I serve as a public servant. I have always wanted to work where I could do something for my community. I enjoy stepping in for people to help them with their legal problems. Working for myself and setting my own hours is not bad either.\n\nQ. What is the least favorite thing about your job?\n\nA. The least favorite thing about my job is having to do the clerical work myself. I hate filing papers, because sometimes I file them in the wrong folders, and it gets me really confused.\n\nQ. What are some of the misconceptions that people have about lawyers?\n\nA. Some misconceptions that some people have with me in particular is that just because I am a black attorney I will automatically take a black case. Race is not a factor when I decide to take or not to take a case.\n\nAnother misconception that some may have is that lawyers are liars. Most lawyers are not liars, we just word certain things that may stretch the truth.\n\nQ. What is the average time length before a judge deliberates on a particular case?\n\nA. Some cases are settled in a timely manner, but cases dealing with personal injury, car accidents and insurance companies can take years to settle.\n\nQ. What is the most important court case in history in your opinion?\n\nA. Brown v. the Board of Education of 1954 in Topeka, Kan., is the most important court case, in my opinion, because that decision changed America forever.\n\nQ. Do you watch Court Television or \"judge shows\"?\n\nA. I don't particularly care for the \"judge shows\" that are on daytime television, because I think it consists of more acting than actual legal litigation.\n\nThese shows are all about ratings, not justice.\n\nQ. What type of court cases have the biggest impact on you personally?\n\nA. Usually the criminal cases that don't end up the way we planned them to affect me the most, especially when I know that the person has had the best legal process available.\n\nQ. What is some advice for new lawyers coming into the legal profession?\n\nA. No. 1 is live by a calendar; never miss an appointment. No. 2 thing is to think outside of the box; do everything you can to gain experience."
