        "text": "Box/Folder 1.1-1.3 Series 1: Lower McKenzie River Region - Oregon\n\n263 images, 3 folders\n\nFormat: There are 69 contemporary duplicate prints copied from the originals in the Lane County Historical Museum, Oregon Historical Society and University of Oregon, Knight Library Special Collections & University Archives, as well as several other public and private collections. The bulk of the 168 postcards are either sepia toned or black and white photographs, with a small number of color lithographed and contemporary postcards. The remaining 26 original photographs are mostly snapshots taken by non-professional photographers. Photographers: The photographers for most of these images are not identified, except for some postcards which have the photographer’s last name, or photo studio, written on the negative prior to printing. Photographers include: Christian, Eddy, Howard, Martin and Smith as well as several postcards from Dotson’s Photo, Eugene, Oregon. Narrative Description: These folders consist of images documenting the lower McKenzie River, Oregon area’s natural beauty, structures and residents. The images are organized as they are physically located along the McKenzie Highway, which winds eastward from Springfield through Leaburg, Vida, Nimrod, Blue River and Rainbow. Williams has also included some images of Springfield, Oregon, which is south of the McKenzie River, as well as an early postcard of the Southern Pacific Railroad bridge which crosses the McKenzie River at Armitage State Park north of Eugene, Oregon. The collection documents notable natural landmarks along the McKenzie River including Eagle Rock, Finn Rock and the Martin Rapids, as well as the scenic beauty of the river itself. There are several early images of the Deadman Ferry, and other McKenzie River ferries, which were later replaced by a system of bridges over the McKenzie River. Images of McKenzie River bridges include the Hendricks and Goodpasture Covered Bridges, and several steel truss bridges. The collection also has several photographs of the Leaburg and Cougar Dams which were constructed on the McKenzie River system to generate electricity and control flooding. There are also some images of the Lucky Boy Mine which at one time operated in the Blue River Mining District. Over the years the lower McKenzie River has been a popular place for camping and fishing. In addition to documenting various campgrounds, this collection also includes photographs of a number of area restaurants, ranches and “chateaus” which were popular in the 1930s and 40s. They include Cascade Resort, Helen’s Chateau, Helen’s Hobby Hut, Lucky Lodge, McKenzie Angler’s Club, McKenzie Chateau, McKenzie Half-Way Ranch Hotel, Nimrod Inn, Phil’s Place, Quimby Restaurant, Rainbow Auto Camp Store and Garage, Seymour’s Chateau, Shermer’s Chateau, Sparks Ranch, The Stockade and Thomson’s Lodge. Holiday Farm, located near Blue River, was a popular vacation spot for former President Herbert Hoover and is documented with a series of photographs. To maintain sufficient fish stocks in the McKenzie River, the McKenzie State Trout Hatchery was constructed and is documented with several photographs. Complementing the images of the natural and built environment are photographs of a number of early settlers and long-time residents of the McKenzie River area including: George and Sarah Armitage; Mr. and Mrs. John Cogswell; the Hendricks Family; George Josephsen; the Millican Family; Edwin Schwering; Carrie Smeed; Jacob and Nancy Spores and the Strube Family. There are also portraits of the river’s namesake, Donald Mackenzie (1783-1851), an explorer for the Astor Expedition who explored the region in 1812, and Lord Nelson Roney (1853-1944) Oregon’s most productive covered bridge builder from the 1880s to the mid 1920s.\n\n2.1-2.5 Series 2: Rogue Valley Region - Oregon\n\n457 images, 5 folders\n\nFormat: There is one contemporary duplicate print copied from the original in the USDA Forest Service Collection. The bulk of the 442 postcards are either sepia toned or black and white photographs, with a small number of color lithographed and contemporary postcards. The remaining 14 original photographs are mostly snapshots taken by non-professional photographers with several professional images. Photographers: The photographers for most of these images are not identified, except for some postcards which have the photographer’s last name, or photo studio, written on the negative prior to printing. Photographers include: Art-Ray, Artcraft, Darling, Eastman’s Studio, Harwood, Miller Photo Company, Hendrick’s Photo, Frank H. Hull (Medford, Oregon), Sawyer Scenic Photos (Portland, Oregon), Sawyer’s, Smith, Studio Ashland and the Western Card Company. Narrative Description: These folders consist of images documenting the Southern Oregon area’s natural beauty, street scenes, local landmarks and agriculture. Following views of Mount Pitt (Mt. McLoughlin) and Lake of the Woods, there are images of various natural landmarks along the Crater Lake Highway including: Box Canyon, Crater Lake Highway Bridge, Mill Creek Falls, Natural Bridge, Natural Bridge at Riviera Park, Rogue River Falls, Rogue River near Flounce Rock, Upper Rogue River, and the waterfall two miles above the Natural Bridge. Williams loosely organized the images to follow the old Highway 99 route beginning at the California-Oregon border and continuing north through Medford, Jacksonville, Central Point, Gold Hill and ending with the Grants Pass area. There are also a few images of Eagle Point and Butte Falls to the east. Pilot Rock and Mount Ashland, have been a guide to travelers from Ashland, Oregon to northern California since pioneer days. Complementing the images of these natural landmarks are panoramic views of Ashland, from the hills surrounding the town, and a detailed view of downtown taken from the top of the Lithia Hotel around 1930. Along with early images of the Ashland Plaza, various street scenes and hotels, there are also views of the original wooden buildings of the Southern Oregon State Normal School, which closed in 1909 due to the lack of state support. In the summer of 1926, the Southern Oregon Normal School was reopened in the newly constructed Churchill Hall, which became the centerpiece for an ever-expanding campus. Later known as the Southern Oregon College of Education (1940s), Southern Oregon College (1950s) and Southern Oregon State College (1970s), today this educational institution is known as Southern Oregon University. Williams has also included a number of early views of Lithia Park and the Oregon Shakespearean Festival, whose outdoor theatre was constructed within the concrete walls of the old Chautauqua Building. Also known at times as Chautauqua Park, Lithia Park was established on 8 acres in 1892 as a place where the Chautauqua Association could bring entertainment and noted speakers of the day. In 1893 a large wooden-domed building was constructed on top of a circular concrete base overlooking the entrance to Lithia Park. By the 1920s radio and motion pictures had caused the gradual demise of the national Chautauqua movement and Ashland’s Chautauqua Building fell into disrepair. Later the roof was demolished leaving the lower concrete walls. In the summer of 1935, the first Shakespearean plays were performed within the walls of the old Chautauqua building which today houses the Oregon Shakespearean Festival outdoor theatre. In 1909 the acreage along Ashland Creek was acquired for the park which grew to include an Auto Camp Ground, scenic ponds and the Butler-Perozzi Fountain. Near the source of Ashland Creek is the upper intake for the Ashland Waterworks. The city of Medford, Oregon was established in the early 1880s with the construction of the Oregon and California Railroad which opened in 1884. In addition of panoramic views of the city and street scenes, there are images of the Hotel Medford, several lumber mills, local agriculture and orchards. The folders also include images of nearby Central Point, the Mon Desir Restaurant, along with street scenes of Jacksonville and the Jacksonville Museum, from the late 1940s. The Sterling Mine was located south of Jacksonville and is documented with several images depicting large scale hydraulic mining. At the north end of the Rogue River Valley are two flat rock plateaus known as Table Rock and Lower Table Rock. There are also views of Table Rock seen from the Gold Ray Dam located on the Rogue River, near Gold Hill, Oregon. Further north of Gold Hill, is the House of Mystery at the Oregon Vortex which is documented with a number of postcards showing visitors standing at gravity defying angles. The Oregon Vortex is described as a spherical magnetic anomaly which is situated half above ground and half below ground. The House of Mystery was constructed as an assay office and tool shed for the Old Grey Eagle Mining Company. The company ceased its mining operations in 1911 and later the wooden building slid off its foundation to its current location. The House of Mystery was opened in 1930 so visitors could experience such strange phenomenon as brooms standing upright on their own and balls rolling uphill, due to the magnetic anomalies of the Oregon Vortex. Grants Pass, founded in the 1860s, is documented with several street scenes and views of the Rogue River which bisects the city. Other images along the Rogue River include Hell’s Gate, Blossom Bar, Ramey Falls, White Rocks, people shooting the rapids at China Bar and various fishing expeditions. There is also extensive documentation of the nearby Oregon Caves which were discovered by Elijah J. Davidson, around 1874, and became a national monument in 1909. Along with views of the entrance, including several images with fur-draped locals dressed as “cavemen”, there are detailed views of various “rooms” inside the caves. The unique formations inside the caves have been given such poetic names as: Joaquin Miller’s Chapel, the Atlantic Ocean, King’s Palace, Niagara Falls, Old Nick’s Bedroom, Paradise Lost, Petrified Forest, Queen’s Room, Satan’s Cradle, Twin Sisters, Washington Monument and Yosemite Falls. There is also extensive interior and exterior documentation of the Oregon Caves Chateau with its small stream running through the dining room, a dance floor, rustic stairway and outdoor evening campfires.\n\n3.1-3.3 Series 3: Upper McKenzie River Region - Oregon\n\n273 images, 3 folders\n\nFormat: There are 34 contemporary duplicate prints copied from the originals in the Lane County Historical Museum, University of Oregon and the USDA - Forest Service Collections as well as 8 black and white photographs by Sam Frear and Tonya Houg. The bulk of the 206 postcards are either sepia toned or black and white photographs, with a small number of color lithographed and contemporary postcards. The remaining 25 original photographs are mostly snapshots taken by non-professional photographers with some professional images. Photographers: The photographers for these images range from Frank A. Rankin, Eugene City, who photographed a glacier on one of the Three Sisters around 1885, to the late 1970s work of Sam Frear and Tonya Houg.

Martin (Eugene, Oregon), Perkins, Photo Art Studio (Bend, Oregon), Sawyers, Sawyers Scenic Photos (Portland, Oregon), Smith and Symons Bros. (Bend, Oregon). Narrative Description: These folders consist of images documenting the natural beauty, structures and residents of the Upper McKenzie River, Oregon area. The sites are located along the McKenzie Highway from the McKenzie Bridge to McKenzie Pass, north of the Three Sisters mountains. Over the years the Upper McKenzie River has been a popular place for vacations and enjoying the natural beauty of the area. The McKenzie Bridge was a wooden covered bridge, in the early 20th century, which was later replaced with an arching concrete bridge. A small town grew up around this important river crossing which is documented with several contemporary duplicate prints from the Lane County Museum and the U.S. Forest Service. The early wooden buildings of McKenzie Bridge, Oregon were later replaced with more modern structures housing Fuller’s Wishing Well Motel, Lauer’s Store and the rustic Log Cabin Inn, which is documented with early and contemporary views. Other visitor amenities in the area include: the Belnap Hot Springs Hotel and the swimming pool at Belnap Hot Springs, Clear Lake Resort, the Foley Springs Hotel, Lost Creek Ranch, the McKenzie Ranger Station and St. Benedict’s Retreat. The collection documents many notable natural landmarks in the area including: Belnap Crater, the cliffs above Obsidian Flat, Sister Springs, Proxy Falls, Scott Lake, and Three Sisters mountains. Numerous summer views show the lava strewn McKenzie Pass, along with the lava encrusted Dee Wright Observatory and surrounding scenic panoramas. Winter views of the McKenzie Pass show early snow removal equipment creating a narrow passage way through towering walls of snow. The scenic views of the Three Sisters mountains also include images of Mount Jefferson, Mount Washington and the Renfro and Collier Cone glaciers on Three Sisters. Other natural and man-made features include: Broken Top mountain, Carmen Diversion Dam, Clear Lake, Elk Lake, Koosah Falls, McKenzie Falls, McKenzie River, Morain Lake, Sahalie Falls, Tamolitch Falls, Tee Hee Falls and Upper Falls.

Foley, “Uncle” George Frissell (1848-1921), George N. Moody, packer and guide, and the Sparks Family picnicking .\n\n4.1-4.3 Series 4: Crater Lake Region - Oregon\n\n308 images, 3 folders\n\nFormat: There are 6 contemporary duplicate prints copied from the originals in the Douglas County Museum and an unidentified collection. The bulk of the 284 postcards are either sepia toned or black and white photographs, with a small number of color lithographed and contemporary postcards. The remaining 18 original photographs are mostly by professional photographers with a few snapshots. Photographers: Given Crater Lake’s unique geography and picturesque qualities, the lake and its environs have been a popular subject for photographers throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The first photograph of Crater Lake was taken in 1874 by Peter Britt, Jacksonville, Oregon and is included in the collection as a postcard reproduction. The photographers for most of these images are not identified, except for some postcards which have the photographer’s last name, or photo studio, written on the negative prior to printing.

Wildlife photographs include bears, chipmunks, a Clark’s Nutcracker, geese, golden mantle squirrels and trout from a fishing trip to Crater Lake. There are also some postcards of nearby Diamond Lake showing the lodge and cabins as well as distant views of Mt. Bailey and Mt. Thielsen. One of the most interesting series of images is of the Lady of the Woods, which is a life-sized figure of a woman on the end of a large boulder. For many years this sculpture was believed to be a natural phenomenon, possibly a lava casting of a native woman who was protecting herself from an erupting volcano. Later it was discovered that Dr. Earl R. Bush, of the U. S. Public Health Service, had made the carving during his stay in the woods October 4-19, 1917 and had left it unfinished due to weather hazardous conditions. In an accompanying article he states “This statue represents my offering to the forest, my interpretation of its awful stillness and repose, its beauty, fascination, and unseen life. A deep love of this virgin wilderness has fastened itself upon me and remains today. It seemed that I must leave something behind . . .\"\n\n5.1-5.3 Series 5: Eugene/Springfield Region - Oregon\n\n249 images, 3 folders\n\nFormat: There are 19 contemporary duplicate prints copied from the originals in the Lane County Historical Museum, the USDA Forest Service Collection and an unknown source. There are also 2 contemporary photographs taken by Gerald W. Williams. The bulk of the 196 postcards are sepia toned, black and white photographs and color lithographed images.

Waterways in and around Eugene are documented with images of the bridges across the Willamette River into Springfield, views of the Willamette River from Judkins Point and various scenes taken along the Millrace. The University of Oregon was established in 1876 the same year Deady Hall was constructed on campus. Ten years later Villard Hall was completed and together these two buildings became the nucleus for the expanding university campus which is documented with numerous postcards and snapshot images. Along with photographs of Deady and Villard Halls, there are also images of the Administration Building, Collier House, Commonwealth Hall, Condon Hall, Fenton Hall, Friendly Hall, Hendricks Hall, Knight Library, McArthur Court, McClure Hall and the Women’s Building.

There are also 2 contemporary photographs taken by Gerald W. Williams and 5 from undocumented sources. The bulk of the 124 postcards are sepia toned, black and white photographs and color lithographed images. The remaining 46 photographs are snapshots taken by non-professional photographers with a number of unidentified studio portraits. Photographers: The photographers for most of these images are not identified, except for some postcards which have the photographer’s last name, or photo studio, written on the negative prior to printing. Photographers include: Roy Andrews, Armstrong (Cottage Grove, Oregon), J. N. Boyd (Cottage Grove, Oregon), Christian, Dotson Photo/s (Eugene, Oregon), Eddy, Frank H. Hull (Medford, Oregon), Kiser Bros. (Portland, Oregon), E. F. Martin (Eugene, Oregon) and A. L. Monroe (Cottage Grove, Oregon). Narrative Description: These folders consist of images documenting the natural features, recreational sites and small towns of Oregon’s East Central Willamette Valley which Gerald Williams grouped under the title “Santiam Valley.” The area documented by these postcards and photographs stretches from Silverton, Mill City, Lebanon and Brownsville in the west, to Detroit, Breitenbush Hot Springs and the Cascade Range in the east. The northern border is the Henline Mountain area in Marion County north of Elkton, and south to Cascadia that is located on the South Santiam River. The Santiam Pass is the crossing point over the Cascade Range for Oregon Highways 20, 22 and 126 and is documented with summer and winter views. Originally known as Hogg Pass, after Col. T. Egenton Hogg who designated this crossing for his proposed railroad, Santiam Pass was renamed in 1929 when the Santiam Highway was completed. The original Santiam Pass is located three miles south and was discovered in 1859. The original pass may be documented in a 1920s photograph of the Half-Way House Barn. Nearby mountains include Three Fingered Jack and Mt. Washington. There are also individual views of these mountains from Big Lake, Lost Lake, Marion Lake, Middle Patjens Lake, Ollalie Lake, Square Lake, and the Santiam Toll Road. Three Fingered Jack and Mt. Washington are included in a group panorama with Hoodoo and Hayrack Buttes. Approximately 20 miles north of the Santiam Pass is Mt. Jefferson, which was named by Lewis and Clark in 1803 for the nation’s third president. This 10,495 foot peak is visible from neighboring Detroit Lake or Reservoir, and Marion Lake. There are also view of the Mt. Jefferson from Battle Axe Look Out, Hanging Valley and Pamelia Lake. Cascadia was established on the South Santiam River fourteen miles east of Sweet Home, in 1898. The unincorporated community began as a stage stop along with Santiam Wagon Road and later George Geisendorfer constructed a hotel near the Cascadia Mineral Springs. In 1940 the state acquired Cascadia which is now part of the 300-acre Cascadia Park. Nearby landmarks include the Cascadia Canyon Creek Footbridge, the Forest Ranger’s Lookout Station on Hurricane Deck and the Mountain House, a former lodge on Highway 20. Area geographic features include: Rainbow Falls, the falls on Soda Creek, Little Wiley Creek and Rooster Rock. West of Cascadia are the towns of Sweet Home, Brownsville and Lebanon, which are not as well documented as some of the towns in Williams' other folders. There is a view of logs in the Santiam River being floated to a local mill along with an aerial view of the Santiam Lumber Company near Sweet Home. Accompanying this aerial view is a photograph of an early lumber truck with one large log on it and one of a bridge over the Santiam River near Sweet Home. It is unclear where the Red and Eagles’ Nest railroad tunnels in Box Canyon are located relative to Sweet Home, Oregon. Views of Brownsville include the nearby Calapooia Dam, Coshow’s Park on the Calapooia River and a panorama of the town along with a view of the J. D. Iraine House. Portraits of Brownville residents Dr. William Rowland and Reverend Henry Harmon Spalding are also included. The Lebanon Valley is known for Peterson’s Butte where Judge Denny first “liberated” imported Chinese pheasants in 1882. East of Peterson’s Butte is the town of Lebanon, established in 1851, which is better known for its early paper mills and later the Crown Willamette Paper Company and Evan Products Company facilities. Crossing the Santiam River is an automobile bridge which replaced an earlier wooden covered bridge south of the manmade Santiam Falls. Other area views include the double span railroad bridge over the Santiam River, and a horse team cutting grain on a Lebanon farm in 1916. Southeast of Lebanon is Sodaville which was the site of a two-story spring house. In nearby Waterloo a picturesque covered bridge crossed the Santiam River in the early 1900s. East of Salem, Oregon is Silver Creek which flows out of Silver Creek Falls area, in the Cascade foothills above Silverton, creating the Silverton Falls and others. Logging first drew people to this area in the mid-1840s, who cut down trees by hand with felling axes and two-man saws into the early 20th century. Later water power from Silver Creek encouraged the construction of mills, such as Fischer’s Mill, along with waterway in Silverton. Included in the collection are also views of the Lutheran Church in Silverton. In the early 1900s local photographer June Drake began efforts to have the area containing the source of Silver Creek and 10 naturally occurring waterfalls made into a park. It wasn’t until 1935 that President Franklin Roosevelt announced that the Silver Creek Falls area would be preserved as a Recreational Demonstration Area. Civilian Conservation Corps workers were employed to construct the South Falls Lodge and other visitor amenities. Along with an exterior view of the lodge and the caretakers’ cabin there in an interior view of the dining room. Included in the album are postcards of the Lower South Falls, Middle North Silver Creek Falls, South Silver Creek Falls, North Silver Creek Falls, the Upper North Falls and the Lower North Falls. South of the Silver Creek Falls area, the Marion Forks Lodge was constructed in 1933 by Nan and Scott Young soon after the opening of the Santiam Highway pass. The Marion Forks Lodge burned to the ground in 1972. During the 1930s, farmers and business owners along the Willamette River demanded federal protection from periodic flooding which caused millions of dollars in damage. In 1938, Congress passed the Flood Control Act which authorized the construction of a dam on the Santiam River at Detroit, Oregon. Earlier in the century small wooden dams were constructed on the Santiam River possibly for irrigation purposes. Construction on the concrete Detroit Dam began on April 1, 1949 as part of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Willamette Valley Project. The completed dam was dedicated by former Oregon Governor Douglas McKay and the U. S. Secretary of the Interior on June 10, 1953. In addition to flood control, the dam benefited navigation, irrigation, electric power production, stream purification and recreation. There are several modern color postcards showing the completed dam along with some early black and white photographs of the town of Detroit prior to the construction of the dam. South of Detroit Lake is Mill City and the Little North Fork of the Santiam River. In 1887 John Shaw and others established the town site with a sawmill they moved from Stayton. The location on the North Santiam River may have been selected to power the mill. Over the years a town grew up around the mill and a wooden covered bridge was constructed to cross the Santiam River. Additional research is necessary to determine whether this railroad bridge was constructed over the low falls on the Santiam River at Mill City. By the early 1900s the Curtiss Lumber Company plant was a major employer in town. Breitenbush Hot Springs is located west of the confluence of the North and South Forks of the Breitenbush Rivers. Along with the Hot Springs the Breitenbush River has a picturesque gorge and waterfalls. The earliest visitors to the Breitenbush Hot Springs were members of the Santiam band of the Kalapuya and later fur trappers from the Hudson Bay Company at Fort Vancouver. Named for the one-armed hunter, John Breightenbush, the springs became the private property in 1904 and a later a rustic bathhouse was constructed to accommodate visitors along with other visitor amenities. In 1927, Merle Bruckman, whose wealthy father invented the first machine to produce ice cream cones, purchased the site and developed the Hot Springs into a wilderness health spa. The Bruckman’s Breitenbush Springs had a series of walking trails and bridges, an enclosed bathhouse, cabins, dance hall, grocery store restaurant, lodge and social hall. Guests could drink mineral water from a series of outdoor drinking fountains, soak their feet in an outdoor foot bath or swim in the open air pool. Bruckman sold the hot springs property in the 1950s and the resort was operated until 1972 when the effects of two major floods forced the closure of the site. In 1977 Breitenbush Hot Springs was purchased for rehabilitation as a retreat - conference center and home to an intentional living community.\n\n7.1-7.3 Series 7: Southern Willamette Valley Region - Oregon\n\n184 images, 3 folders\n\nFormat: There are 28 contemporary duplicate prints copied from the originals in the Lane County Historical Museum; the Grace Smith Collection; the National Archives, the Forest Service Collection, the USDA Forest Service and several unknown sources.

The postcards and photographs are divided into two main groups of images documenting the natural beauty, structures and residents along Highway 58, from Willamette Pass to Oakridge, and the Cottage Grove area including Dorena and the Bohemia Mountain area. Beginning with Willamette Pass Ski area, southeast of Oakridge, there are various images of the scenery and tunnels along Highway 58, also known as the Willamette Highway. Along this route lie Gold Lake, Salt Creek, Salt Creek Falls, the Salt Creek Railroad Bridge and Sprinkling Rock. Approximately half way between Willamette Pass and Oakridge is McCredie Springs Resort area which includes the McCredie Springs Hotel, McCredie Springs Hotel, Goble Creek and Swinging Bridge. Nearby Baby Rock was named for the legend that Indians sleeping near the rock were bitten by animals which left footprints around the rock like that of a small baby. Closer to Oakridge is Kitson Hot Springs Resort featuring a lodge and bath house. The resort was closed in 1963 and was donated to the Oregon Trail Boy Scout Council, in 1977, who have since removed the resort structures. Salmon Creek Falls is located on Salmon Creek, near Oakridge, which flows north of the Salmon Hatchery. Oakridge is also home to the Pope - Talbot Sawmill, Hiway Theatre, Steele’s Grocery and Croner’s Hiway Store. Natural features in the area include: Diamond Peak, Lookout Mountain showing the railroad tunnel and Profile Rock. Continuing up Highway 58 towards Eugene is the historic Lowell Market in Lowell and the Pleasant Hill Public School in Pleasant Hill. West of Oakridge is Dorena Lake, a manmade reservoir resulting from the damming of the Row River in 1949. For many years the Row River, a tributary of the Coast Fork of the Willamette River, was a transportation corridor for the Bohemia Mining District near Bohemia Mountain. Along with timber, transported by the Bohemia Railroad, mining was in important industry in this area and is documented with views of the Bohemia, Harris, Quartz Mill and Visouviu Mines. To move the ore from the mine to the stamp mill, where it was crushed and sorted, ore cars travelling on metal rails were often laid on rows of wooden ties. There is also a photograph of a mining camp and several group shots of miners working and gathered for a group portrait. Closer to Cottage Grove are Mosby Creek, Wildwood Falls, London Springs Hotel and Campground and the old Latham General Store. The town of Cottage Grove is documented with a variety of panoramas, taken from David Mountain and street scenes from various decades. There are also specific views of the Southern Pacific log trains, Cottage Grove Hospital, Currin’s bridge over the west fork of the Willamette River, the Westside School and the rustic Anlauf Motor Lodge, along with several view of the nearby Willamette River. A panorama of Creswell and a close-up of the Methodist Episcopal Church and Parsonage are also included. Complementing the images of the natural and built environment are a casual accumulation of portraits including: L. and Bertha Harrington with children Clifford and Flossie; Joseph Kupetz with two plucked turkeys; four studio portraits of Bob Legar as a young boy; Addie L. Morris, a General Land Office Forest Ranger, and his wife, residents of Big Prairie, Oregon; the James M. Parker Family in front of their home at Cloverdale, Oregon; the Wolf Family in front of their cabin at Big Prairie, Oregon and group shots of students in front of various Cottage Grove, Oregon Schools.\n\n8.1-8.5 Series 8: Willamette Valley Region - Oregon\n\n423 images, 5 folders\n\nFormat: There is only a single contemporary duplicate print in these folders. The bulk of the 370 postcards are sepia toned and black and white photographs with some color lithographed and contemporary images. The remaining 52 original photographs are snapshot portraits, snapshots and the work of professional photographers. Photographers: The photographers for most of these images are not identified, except for some postcards which have the photographer’s last name, or photo studio, written on the negative prior to printing. Photographers include: Ball, C. McC. Barton, William K. Burghard’s Company, F.J. Catterlin (Salem, Oregon), Cawthon (Independence, Oregon), Chase, Christian, Coffey, Collins, D. H. Craven (Independence, Oregon), Crawford & Paxton (Albany, Oregon), J. D. Drake (Silverton, Oregon), M. W. Earl, Eddy, Gunnell, W.L. Henbree Stationers (McMinnville, Oregon) J. Hogg (McMinnville, Oregon), Frank H. Hull (Medford, Oregon), Knutson Photo (Salem, Oregon), N.L., C.C. Lewis (Monmouth, Oregon), Dotson, G.W. Mackey (Halsey, Oregon), E.F. Martin Studio (Eugene, Oregon), Meier Photo (Jewell, Oregon), Moseley, Newton Photo, Prentiss, Ransford, Riley Photo (Newberg, Oregon), Sawyers, Tollman Studio (Eugene, Oregon), E.W.? Narrative Description: These folders consist of images documenting cities and towns in the Willamette Valley from Junction City, north of Eugene, to Forest Grove and Orenco, east of Portland. Unlike other folders, where Williams organized images along a single travel route, these postcards and photographs are arranged more informally by geographic region from south to north. Northwest of Eugene, Oregon are the towns of Franklin, Blachly and Tiernan situated along the Siuslaw River. There are several views of the waterways near Blachly including Lake Creek and Triangle Lake. In the 1870s Junction City was selected as the connecting point for Ben Holladay’s east and west side railroad lines. While this railroad scheme never materialized, the town grew to become the junction of two main branches of the Pacific Highway. Junction City is documented with several street scenes, along with views of the early Methodist church, several schools and the Hotel Block. Included are some postcards of a log train and several people. Traveling north from Junction City on Highway 99E, is Halsey, named for the vice-president of Holladay’s Willamette Valley Railway Company, which includes view of the J. C. Standish House and the Christian Church. South of Halsey is the town of Harrisburg, which was incorporated in 1866. The agriculture of the area is highlighted with images of a nearby cornfield, row crops and an interior view of the Fry Warehouse filled with bags of rye grass seed and bales of hops. Traveling north from Junction City, on Highway 99W, is the town of Monroe which was named for the fifth president of the United States. North of Monroe is Corvallis, a name invented by founder J.C. Avery from Latin meaning “heart of the valley.” The city is well documented with early panoramas and scenes along the Marys and Willamette Rivers. Included are also early views of the ferry on the Willamette River at Corvallis and the “New bridge at Corvallis” a steel truss swing bridge which crosses the Willamette River at Van Buren Street. Along with street scenes of the city there are images of Corvallis High School, the Benton County Courthouse and various scenes on the campus of the Oregon Agricultural College, now Oregon State University (OSU). OSU’s roots go back to 1858 when it was established as a private academy in Corvallis and in 1868 the university was designated as Oregon’s “land grant university”. The system of land grant universities was established by the federal government in 1862. Federal funding enabled these universities to focus their instruction on agriculture, science and engineering in response to the social changes brought on by the Industrial Revolution. Over the last century of activity and growth, OSU has followed its three-fold mission of teaching, research and service to Oregonians and the world. View of early campus buildings include: Benton Hall (Administration Building, 1887); Fairbanks Hall (Cauthorn Hall, 1892); Kearny Hall (Apperson Hall, 1899-1900); Education Hall (Agriculture Hall, 1902); Waldo Hall (1907); McAlexander Fieldhouse (1909-1910); Strand Agriculture Hall (Agronomy Hall, 1909); School of Domestic Science (Milam Hall, 1914); Memorial Union (1927-1928); Weatherford Hall (1928) and lower campus. There are also images of cadet regiments and early student’s gatherings on the lower campus grounds as well as a view of the Kappa Kappa Gamma House. An early view of Pioneer Hall and Music Hall, on the Linfield College campus in McMinnville, Oregon and John Straub Memorial Hall on the University of Oregon campus in Eugene, Oregon mistakenly found their way in with the images of Oregon State University. Highway 99W continues north from Corvallis, through Adair Village, near the site of Camp Adair a 57,000 acre United State Army training facility from 1942-1946. The next town is Monmouth, home of Western Oregon University, and nearby Independence, Oregon on the Willamette River. For many years, hops have been an important crop in the Independence area and are documented with a variety of images. Northeast of Monmouth is Dallas, Oregon named for George Mifflin Dallas, Vice-President of the U.S. from 1845 to 1849. Along with a view of Main Street, there is a view of the Carnegie Library, the Old Covered Bridge and the Mill District. In 1902 the senior class presented the “Lady of the Fountain” to the Oregon Agricultural College, now OSU. The nearly life-size metal statue was of Hebe, goddess of youth, stood atop a concrete circular basin which was constructed from bricks from the original Corvallis College building. Following a variety of student pranks involving the statue, the “Iron Lady” was stolen in late 1919 and eventually returned to campus during a track meet in 1922. The beloved statue was vandalized beyond repair with a sledgehammer the morning of January 21, 1929. There are several views of the statue soon after its installation in the lower campus. Other views in the Corvallis area include: Marys River in winter, Marys Peak also known as Mount Chintimini, and the water supply intake for Corvallis located on Marys Peak. There are also several views of Philomath, Oregon located 5.5 miles southwest of Corvallis. Along with a panorama of the city, possibly taken east from the Philomath College building (Benton County Historical Society), there are views of the Benton County Lumber Company Planing Mill, the Philomath Public School and a lumber flume. A photograph of the State Normal School in Drain, Oregon, has been mistakenly placed with the photographs of Philomath. Two early bridges to cross the Willamette River at Albany were the Steel Bridge and the C & E swing bridge which is shown with several steamships and its construction crew. The Steel Bridge, which carried vehicles from South Albany to the farms and Thornton’s Lake in North Albany, was replaced with the Lyons Street Bridge in 1925. The concrete pylons of the Steel Bridge, located west of the Lyons Street Bridge, were adapted for use as power poles. Other views around Albany include: a bucking bronco at the Western Oregon Round, the Madison Street School, a cannon and the bandstand in the Albany city park and the Linn County Courthouse. Images of local transportation and industry include: an Oregon Electric train passing through Albany, Oregon, mills on the Calapooia River and a group of mill workers standing on logs floating in a mill pond. Northeast of Albany are the towns of Jefferson and Turner. Sometime around the turn of the 20th century, a wagon bridge was constructed across the Santiam River at Jefferson. In 1906 a steel railroad bridge was constructed slightly south of the wagon bridge by the Southern Pacific Railroad. The wagon bridge was replaced by the triple arched Santiam Bridge in the mid-1930s. Farther north in Turner, the Turner Flour Mill was constructed during this same time period. West of Turner are the towns of Monmouth, Independence and Falls City which was named for the Luckiamute Falls on the Little Luckiamute River which flows nearby. Monmouth was named for Monmouth, Illinois which was the starting point of a group of pioneers who settle near the present site of the town in 1853. Members of this wagon train party set aside 640 acres for the town and Monmouth University which was established under the auspices of the Christian Church. In 1871 the university became the Christian College and in 1872 the state acquired the institution which became a teacher’s college and was renamed the Oregon State Normal School at Monmouth, then later Western Oregon College (Western Oregon University).. The collection includes several views of the school, around 1920, including Todd Hall and Campbell Hall with its picturesque bell tower, which blew over during the Columbus Day Storm in 1962. Continuing north from Monmouth are Rickreal, Dallas, Sheridan and Salem, Oregon, which is northeast of Monmouth on the Willamette River. There are birds-eye views of Dallas and Rickreal along with a colored view of the Hotel Sheridan on the South Yamhill River. The city of Salem was established in 1840-1841 when the Jason Lee Mission was relocated south from a less desirable site along the Willamette River. Salem became the official state capitol in 1851 where it has remained except during 1855 when the capital was temporarily moved to Corvallis, Oregon and back to Salem in the same year. Beginning with a comical sign for Nohlgren’s “all you can eat” restaurant the collection includes downtown panoramas and street scenes, along with images of the Breyman Fountain, Marion Square, the Post Office, Salem High School, the West Salem Presbyterian Church and numerous views of Oregon’s second capitol building which burned in 1935. Nearby structures and government buildings include the bandstand in Wilson Park, the Supreme Court Building, the Oregon Department of Justice Building and the new Oregon State Capital which was dedicated in 1938. Along with being the seat of state government, Salem is also the county seat for Marion County which is represented by views of the Marion County Courthouse. Views of other state institutions include the Oregon State Hospital Administration Building, the School for Deaf Mutes (Oregon School for the Deaf), State Blind School (Oregon School for the Blind), the Oregon State Fair and the Oregon State Penitentiary (Oregon State Prison). Other notable buildings in Salem include the Carnegie Library, the Masonic Temple building, the Salem Flouring Mills, Thomas Kay Woolen Mill, Willamette University campus with Eaton and Waller Halls, the E. W. Waite Electric Fountain and the interior of the Meier and Frank Department store. There are a number of views of the Willamette River including a dredge scene with Spaulding Lumber and the paper plant in the background, the Portland, Eugene and Eastern Railroad Bridge dedicated in 1913. Around 1866 Scotts Mills, Oregon, a small town northeast of Silverton, was named for Robert Hall Scott and Thomas Scott who established a sawmill and flour mill on the town site. There are images of logging in Brooks, Oregon and logs floating in the Luckiamute River in southern Polk County, near the Wildwood School. Other Oregon industries are depicted with images of Oregon strawberry fields, men in ties picking apples and rows of loganberry near Salem. Joseph Watt founded the town of Amity, Oregon with his brother Ahio between 1848 and 1849. Joseph Watt later established Oregon’s first woolen mill in nearby Salem and in 1868 shipped wheat to England which was the first Oregon wheat to be sent around Cape Horn. North of Amity is McMinnville, Oregon which boasted its “good roads” in the early 20th century. In 1858 the Baptist College was established in McMinnville which was renamed Linfield College in 1922. In addition to early views of the college there are images of Baker Falls, the Presbyterian Church, Yamhill County Courthouse, the large wooden auditorium in the city park and the Yamhill Sawmill. Founded in the mid-1840s, nearby Lafayette was the site of a picturesque wooden bridge on the Yamhill River. In 1898 work began on concrete locks to assist river commerce which began in the early 1850s. The locks were closed in 1954 due to limited use and increases in operation expenses and were removed in 1965 to increase fish runs on the river. South of Lafayette is the small town of Dayton which was established in 1848-1849 by Joel Palmer. There is a north view of Dayton showing the town, with its waterfront and the steeple of the brick church in the distance. One of the most notable structures in Dayton is the Fort Yamhill or Grand Ronde blockhouse which was constructed in 1856 as a refuge for settlers in case of attack by Native Americans. After Fort Yamhill closed in the mid-1860s the blockhouse was moved to Valley Junction and used as a jail. In 1911 John G. Lewis, a patriotic Dayton resident had the structure moved to a city park in Dayton to honor Joel Palmer. Woodburn, Oregon is located southeast of Dayton, on Highway 99E, and is shown in the early 1900s. There is also a postcard titled Mine near Woodburn, Oregon which may actually be located further east in the mining district of Marion County. Further north on Highway 99E are the Daffodil Gardens pictured with Mount Hood, Horse Shoe Park promotion and the Real-Rest Sanitarium at the Hubbard Mineral Springs near Hubbard, Oregon. Another well known Oregon mineral spring was the Wilhoit Mineral Springs, east of Scott’s Mills, which was established in the 1870s. Postcards show the resort at its heyday in the early 1900s, with log cottages, mineral spring houses, a log clubhouse and campgrounds with campers in suits and white dresses. The resort remained popular into the 1950s though fires had destroyed a number of the original buildings during that time. In October 1962, the Columbus Day Storm demolished the last of the original buildings and the site later became a county park. Southeast of the Portland metropolitan area are the cities of Mollala, Estacada and Oregon City. Along with rare double view stereoscopes of downtown Mollala, taken in 1910, there are a number of views taken along the Clackamas River. The river was harnessed for power in the early 20th Century with the River Mill power plant and dam, near Estacada, the dam and fish ladder at Cazadero two miles north of Estacada and the Clackamas River Dam. The Estacada Hotel opened in 1904 and was later known as the Promenade Hotel until it was destroyed by fire in 1936. West of Estacada is the small town of Viola which is represented with a photo of the “house the Charles built”. Further to the west, on the Willamette River, is Aurora which was the site of a German religious colony which began in the 1850 with the construction of a two-story hewn log cabin which is featured in the collection. To the west and southwest of Portland are Orenco and the cities of Forest Grove and Newberg. The name Orenco was a contraction taken from the Oregon Nursery Company, which built this company town in the early twentieth century. It is not known whether this company also constructed the mill at Orenco included in the collection. Forest Grove was established in the mid-1840s and in 1849 the Tualatin Academy was established which later grew into Pacific University. Along with early views of downtown Forest Grove and the Methodist Episcopal Church there are postcards depicting Marsh Hall, on the Pacific University campus and the petrified stump commemorating the first home of the university. South of Forest Grove is the town of Carlton which is represented with a view of several residences. In the early 1840s the Hudson Bay Company constructed a warehouse on the Willamette River south of Oregon City at Champoeg. A small town grew up around the warehouse and in 1843 Champoeg was the site for the vote which established Oregon’s first Provisional Government. While all the buildings in town were washed away in the flood of 1861, the town site has remained an important historic site for Oregon history. In 1901 a monument was erected to honor the first American Government established on the west coast and in 1930 the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) constructed and furnished a log cabin to honor the pioneer mothers. Later the Oregon Society of the DAR purchased and reconstructed the nearby home of Dr. Robert Newell (1807-1869) for the Oregon Centennial in 1959. Early views along with Willamette River include a picturesque scene of the Balancing Rock near Portland, Oregon and the Southern Pacific Railroad winding beside wheat fields along the river, south of Oregon City. The railroad tracks were maintained, in part, by a bonding crew which is shown working on a section of track near Dundee, Oregon. Traveling west out of Portland is the Sunset Highway which was originally known as the Wolf Creek Highway that was constructed in the early 1930s. The Quartz Creek Bridge was constructed along with the roadway. North of the highway, in eastern Clatsop County is the town of Jewell which had a thriving lumber industry in the nearby forests. South of Forest Grove is the town of Gaston which is represented with an early street scene. Farther south, near the Willamette River is the town of Newberg known for its orchards and agriculture. There are several panoramas of the town taken from Chehalem Mountain showing a variety of crops being grown in the Chehalem Valley. There are several street scenes, and a view of the Spaulding Sawmill with an enormous wooden platform being constructed on site.\n\n9.1-10.2 Series 9: Columbia River Region - Oregon\n\n700 images, 7 folders\n\nFormat: There are 13 contemporary duplicate prints, two from the Oregon Historical Society, two A.

Narrative Description: These folders consist of images documenting scenic views, industries and towns in the Columbia River Gorge around the first half of the 20th century. The Columbia River is the boundary between much of Oregon and Washington and has a long history of Native American settlement, water, rail and automobile transportation along with numerous hydroelectric dams. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, boats and railroads carried passengers and freight, such as lumber and fish, to market. With the increasing popularity of the automobile, the Historic Columbia River Highway was constructed in the gorge from 1913-1922 to enable travelers to experience the scenic wonders of the gorge. Many of the postcards and photographs document this scenic highway prior to the construction of a freeway bypass in the early 1950s. Due to its unique natural and historic features, the Columbia River Gorge was designated a National Scenic Area in 1986 and the Historic Columbia River Highway became a National Historic Landmark in 2000. Complementing the Columbia River Highway on the Washington side of the Columbia River is the Evergreen Highway, which becomes the Lewis and Clark Highway in the Ash Lake area. Views along the Evergreen Highway include the railroad bridge over the Klickitat River, Columbia River Bluffs, Wallula Gap and the Bridge of the Gods, completed in 1926. Additional images include postcards of Skamania Lodge, constructed in 1993, the bath house at Moffett’s Springs, Washington and the boat landing at Stevenson. In 1937 the Bonneville Dam was completed to provide flood control, hydroelectric power and jobs during the Great Depression. Along with the dam, construction included a number of administration buildings and residences, fish ladders and a fish counting station along with shipping locks. Earlier in century the banks of the Columbia River were dotted with logging camps, including one at Bridal Veil Falls. Logging trains may have been used to transport the logs to the river where they were chained together in large rafts for transport downstream. A handwritten note on the back of the Bridal Veil Falls postcard reads, “Here is a view of [a] logging train at the Portland Lumber Company. Landing [a] few miles up the river of (sic) us.” At that time steamships, such as the Bailey Gatzert named for a Seattle mayor, travelled the river carrying passengers and freight. To accommodate river traffic at a cascade in the river, the Cascade Locks were constructed between 1878 and 1896 and are documented with a number of period postcards. These locks were submerged with the completion of the Bonneville Dam in the late 1930s. The Oneonta Gorge, on the Columbia River, was named by noted photographer Carleton Watkins after his hometown in Oneonta, New York. Watkins was the first to photograph this picturesque natural formation which became more accessible to visitors, for hikes and picnics, after the completion of the Columbia River Highway. Along with the natural beauty of the Columbia River Gorge, the river was also home to a range of fish including Salmon, Steelhead Trout and Sturgeon. The modern salmon canning industry began on the river with the construction of the Hapgood, Hume and Company cannery in 1866. By 1883, the combined production of 39 canneries exceeded 42,000,000 pounds which owed its success to net fishing, known as seining. There are views of various styles of fish wheels that were constructed on the Columbia River from the late 1870s until the outlawing of their use in 1928. They all are based on a similar concept of using a fence, or weir, to guide fish swimming upstream into a large rotating wheel which is powered by river water flowing downstream. The wheel scoops the fish out of the river and into a holding pen, known as a fish box, where they can be speared. Over the years the use of fish wheels drew lawsuits from Native Americans, who lost their traditional fishing sites to cannery fish wheels, and from sport fishers who were concerned about overfishing the river. Voters eventually passed laws which prohibited fish wheels on the Columbia River, first in Oregon in 1928 and later in Washington in 1935. Other scenic points of interest along the river include Rooster Rock, where Lewis and Clark camped in November 1805, Cape Horn, Lone Rock, Castle Rock, Washington’s Beacon Rick, Wind Mountain, St. Peter’s Dome, the Pillars of Hercules, the Needles, Thumb Needle, Pilot Rock and Owl Rock. The Oregon Department of Transportation describes the Columbia River Highway as “the pinnacle of early-20th-century rural highway design created to take visitors to the Columbia River Gorge's most breathtaking and beautiful natural wonders and scenic vistas.” The Williams Collections includes views of: Shepperd’s Dell bridge, the Latourelle Bridge, Bradley Park, the Tunnel at Oneonta Gorge, the “Rotary Wheel” near Wahkeena Falls, Bishops Caps, Inspiration Point and Cathedral Peak. Scenic waterfalls include: Mist Falls and lodge, Bridal Veil Falls, Latourelle Falls, Wahkeena Falls, Necktie Falls, Horsetail Falls and Fairy Falls. Also included are images of bridges, vistas and seasonal views. Along with views of the natural features along the 75 mile Columbia River Highway there are also postcards highlighting structures and the roadway itself on the landscape. Images include: the Sam Hill Monument, Menucha Retreat and Conference Center, Chanticleer Inn (1912-1930), Crown Point, Vista House, Moffett Creek Bridge, the “Figure Eight”, Rowena Loops, Eagle Creek Trail, Bonneville Tunnel, Twin Tunnels, Mitchell’s Point Tunnel, Eagle Creek Bridge and Tooth Rock. The McNary Dam was constructed on the Columbia River from 1947-1954 north of Hermiston, Oregon. Along with the dam, construction included an administration building, residences, a fish ladder and shipping locks. Upriver from the dam is the Wallula Gap and downriver is the town of Arlington at the mouth of the Alkali Canyon. Continuing downriver, 34 miles west of Arlington, is Biggs Junction, Oregon which is across the river from the Maryhill Museum of Art, the Stonehenge Memorial, and the Meadow Lark Inn in Washington. Between Wishram, Washington, near the former site of Celilo Falls and The Dalles, there are a number of rock formations in the river which hamper river traffic but once created important areas for Native American salmon fishing. In the early 1900s, the Dalles-Celilo Canal, was constructed to allow steamboats and barges to pass around these huge series of waterfalls in the river. With the construction of the Bonneville Dam, in the late 1930s, the traditional fishing areas at Celilo Falls were flooded and remain under the waters of the Columbia River. Along with fishing, early in the 20th century the Columbia River basin on the Oregon side was known for its farms, orchards and lumber operations. Along with the fertile soil and endless water in this area, the beauty of the Columbia River was enjoyed by workers at the Jewett Farm and orchards along the river. Outside Hood River, Oregon, farmers had views of the majestic Mt. Hood from their orchards and strawberry fields. Logging operations were active near the Northwestern Power Company’s lake and at the Green Point Mill’s log pond where the mile and a half log flume from Palmer to Bridal Veil terminated. Hood River, Oregon is situated on the Columbia River across from White Salmon, Washington. In the early days it was the site of a busy railroad depot and the Mt. Hood Hotel. In 1924, the Hood River Bridge was constructed to connect these two cities and is the second oldest bridge across the Columbia River. Along with several views of the bridge prior to being raised to accommodate the higher waters created by the Bonneville Dam, the collection includes early views of the Hood River Telephone Company and the high school. West of Hood River is the historic Columbia River Hotel which was constructed in 1921 in a palatial Mediterranean-style with spectacular views up and down the river. In addition to the river, other natural features near Hood River, Oregon include: Lullaby Falls and the Devil’s Punch Bowl. Across the river in White Salmon, Washington, there is an early view of Jewett Avenue, now Jewett Boulevard, with a large tree growing in the middle of the street and some later views from the mid-1920s. Traveling west over 20 miles along the Lewis &Clark and Evergreen Highways, is the Fort Rains blockhouse which was constructed in 1927 as a memorial to military activity in the area. Williams includes images of the Middle Blockhouse, which was constructed by General Sheridan’s troops near Stevenson, Washington in 1855, and Fort Cascades Blockhouse constructed in the late 1850s. Near White Salmon is also a power dam and enclose flume. In the Carson River Valley, west of White Salmon, are the Shipherd’s Springs resort and the St. Martins Mineral Spring and Hotel St. Martin. Along the Wind River, which winds its way through the Carson River Valley, is Big Falls and the Upper Wind River Falls. It is not exactly clear where the Collins Hot Mineral Spring Hotel, with its pavilion and store, or the town of Collins was located in Washington. Along Rock Creek, near Stevenson, Washington, are the Upper Rock Creek Falls and the Lower Falls. East of White Salmon the Klickitat River has carved its way through the landscape creating beautiful gorges with a view of Mt. Hood in the background. Gresham, Oregon, east or Portland, was named for Walter Q. Gresham a Civil War soldier and presidential candidate in 1884 and 1888. Gerald Williams has included views of Powell Street and the Gresham Public School. The Interstate Bridge, which crosses the Columbia River between Portland and Vancouver, was constructed between 1915 and 1917. This bridge complemented two earlier railroad bridges across the Columbia River near Portland, the North Bank Railroad Bridge, and the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railroad Bridge. Farther downstream from Portland, the Longview-Rainier Bridge crosses the Columbia River at Rainier, Oregon. This small river town was named after Rear Admiral Peter Rainer, as was Mount Rainer in Washington, and there are view of Main street showing a wide street with railroad tracks and rows of wooden buildings. There are a number of images from various locations throughout northwest Oregon including the Upper Falls near Scappoose, Oregon, a colorful armada of sailboats on the Columbia with the Trojan Nuclear Power plant in the background and a view of the Court House Plaza in St. Helens, Oregon around 1940. In nearby Clatskanie and Vernonia, the lumber industry relied on the waters of the Columbia River and railroads to transport logs to area lumber mills. In the woods between these two towns are thousands of acres of forest lands, which were originally logged with steam donkeys mounted on railroad cars, and Beaver Falls. An early view of a mill shows a Wigwam Burner where sawdust and other milling refuse was burned. Due to the air pollution created by the smoke and ash from these incinerators, and growing interest in using wood by-products for making paper and landscaping bark, the Wigwam Burners in Oregon were phased out in the 1970s. Near Astoria, Oregon, at the mouth of the Columbia River, the Columbia River Highway’s Widby Loops wind through the landscape. Millions of pounds of salmon were caught with small net boats and horse-drawn seining nets and sent to local canneries. In addition to salmon, this area was also known for its sturgeon, oysters and smelt. Astoria is also the site of Fort Clatsop where Meriwether Lewis and William Clark wintered over 1805-1806. By 1811 the Pacific Fur Company, owned by John Jacob Astor, was the first commercial settlement on the Pacific Coast. Replicas of both of these early settlements have been constructed in Astoria. There are also views of Astoria’s centennial celebration in 1911 and the city reservoir. The Astoria Column was constructed in 1926 with funding from the Great Northern Railway and Vincent Astor, the great- grandson of John Jacob Astor. The 125 foot column, located on Coxcomb Hill, is decorated with a spiral sgraffitto frieze on the face of the column which measures nearly seven feet high and 525 feet long. By the early 1980s weather and other environmental factors had seriously diminished the original exterior murals which were restored in the mid-1990s. From the top of the column visitors may view the Astoria-Megler Bridge at the mouth of the Columbia River and out to the Pacific Ocean. A postcard in the collection also shows this panoramic view prior to the construction of the bridge in the mid-1960s. There are also a number of historic views of Astoria including a view up Commercial Street during a winter snow storm. Also included are early color images of Oregon’s first Custom House, constructed in 1852 and the first Post Office west of the Rocky Mountains, constructed in Astoria in 1847. This early wood framed building was later replaced with a two-story stone structure located near the Court House. Another notable building was the St. Mary’s Hospital which opened in 1880 and was the only hospital in the region until the early 1900s. It appears this building survived the devastating fires which consumed 30 blocks of downtown Astoria on December 8, 1922. A view of the fire damage at 14th and Commercial Streets in downtown Astoria is included. Complementing Astoria’s fishing industry, which included a fleet of fishing boats, netting salmon and canning fish at the Union Fisherman’s Co-Operative Packing Company, there was the Astoria Motor Boat Construction Company which made small fishing boats in the early 1920s. Astoria also had a thriving waterfront of wharves, municipal docks and warehouses. After the World War II Astoria also became the home of the U.S. Navy Fleet Reserve. This was a storage facility for surplus cargo vessels and at one time had over 500 vessels storing in the waters around the city before operations ceased in 1963. Other water related scenes in the collection are postcards of the Regatta at Astoria in 1910 and August, 1912 and a Salmon Derby in the mid-1950s. Crossing Young’s Bay, southwest of Astoria, is the Young’s Bay Bridge completed in 1921. On nearby Young’s River is a picturesque waterfall possibly in the vicinity of an unidentified lake featuring groups of water lilies floating in the water. At one time there was also a railroad bridge across Young’s Bay which connected with Seaside. In later years the Astoria North Beach Ferry Company transported people and vehicles to Megler, Washington. Large log rafts, destined for California, were shipped out of Astoria. The large log rafts, held together with chains, were constructed in big wooden cradles. The rafts were freed from the cradles and towed downstream with boats. These rafts, containing millions of feet of lumber, were floated out to sea and transported to California where they were milled into lumber. Other ships which travelled the waters near Astoria are the Steamer T.J. Potter, the Columbia and the Steamer San Pedro which sank in the Columbia.\n\n11.1-11.3 Series 10: Portland/ Oregon City Region - Oregon\n\n329 images, 3 folders\n\nFormat: There is 1 contemporary duplicate print from unidentified sources.

Narrative Description: This album consists of images documenting the natural features, industries and built environment from Oregon City, Oregon to Portland, Oregon. In 1829 Dr. John McLoughlin, chief factor of the Hudson’s Bay Company, secured a land claim at the site of Oregon City which he laid out and named in 1842. Due to its proximity to the Willamette River, and the spectacular Willamette Falls, Oregon City soon became an important industrial center for lumber, paper and woolen mills. In the early 1840s, settlement along the Willamette River, north of Oregon City, eventually grew into the town of Portland, which was named with a coin toss in 1845. Portland’s navigable river, deep harbor and gently sloping topography spurred fast-paced growth of the city. By 1900 there were 90, 426 people living in Portland, which doubled over the next 10 years to 207, 214 following the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries log rafts dotted the Willamette River at Oregon City. The raw logs were often transported by rail to the Willamette River where they were bound with large metal chains into large floating rafts. The rafts were later transported to various mills along the Willamette River where the lumber was processed into lumber or paper. Views of Oregon City, Oregon range from scenic panoramas from the early 1900s, including a tinted image of the McLoughlin Institute, to a candid shot of McLoughlin Boulevard, Oregon Route 99E, taken from the center lane. There are a variety of images showing the spectacular Willamette Falls at Oregon City, whose waters provided opportunities for fishing and industrial development. In 1909 Dr. John McLoughlin’s two-story white frame house by the Willamette River was threatened with demolition. Local citizens formed the McLoughlin Memorial Association to preserve and interpret the home of Oregon City’s founder, which they moved, restored and opened as a museum in 1910. Postcards show the McLoughlin House in its original and new locations, and interior view of the restored house, the McLoughlin graves at St. John’s Church and several early portraits of the “Father of Oregon.” Other historic homes in the area include the Barclay House, constructed by Dr. Forbes Barclay, a surgeon a Fort Vancouver, in 1846 and Rose Farm the meeting site of Oregon’s first Territorial Legislature in 1849. Across the river from Oregon City lies Gladstone, which was developed in the 1890s and became well known for the large Chautauqua Auditorium in the Gladstone Park. Williams has followed images of Oregon City, Oregon with a variety of scenes in and around the Portland area. There are aerial views of Hillsboro’s Shute Park and Washington County along with scenic views of the Washington County Courthouse and Tigard’s Union High School. There are early views of the U. S. Customs House, Reed College and the Willamette River at Sellwood before and after the construction of the Sellwood Bridge in 1925. Numerous aerial and panoramic views of Portland show the city in the early 1900s, the 1940s and in to the early 1970s. There are several early views of the Portland Harbor and Waterfront with scenes of the U.S.S. Constitution’s visit to Portland, on May 13, 1933, and the battleship Oregon which was “Permanently anchored at the East End of the Broadway Bridge” from 1925-1942. Scenes of the Portland Harbor include picturesque views of the “new” Morrison Street Bridge, constructed for pedestrian and streetcar traffic in 1905, the Broadway Bridge, Hawthorne Bridge, O.W.R. & N. (Oregon-Washington Railroad and Navigation Company) Bridge, Burnside Bridge, St. Johns Bridge and an early Steel Bridge on the Willamette River. Downtown views include: Broadway, First Avenue during the 1894 flood, Fifth Avenue, Front Street, Morrison Street showing the Hotel Portland, the Portland Post Office Building and the Oregonian Building and recreational areas such as the Roosevelt Statue in the Park Blocks and Plaza Block Park. There are views of the Arlington Club, Hotel Mallory and Multnomah Hotel as well as other well-known Portland buildings such as the Lloyd Center, Meier & Frank Department Store, North Pacific Industrial Association Building, Pittock Mansion, St. Vincent’s Hospital, Union Depot, Veteran’s Hospital and the Yeon Building. Portland schools also featured are Buckman High School, Jefferson High School, Portland Academy, West Side High School, and the Willamette University Medical School. Over the years Portland, Oregon has been the site of several notable expositions, fairs and celebrations. In 1905 the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition and Oriental Fair celebrated the 200th anniversary of Lewis and Clark’s famous journey west in 1802. Over 2.5 million people attended the fair to view the Auditorium Building, Forestry Building, Foreign Exhibits Building, Government Building, Lakeview Terrace and Grand Stairway, Manufacturers and Liberal Arts Building along with state exhibition buildings featuring Alaska, California, Idaho, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon and Washington. In 1959 the Oregon Centennial Expositional and International Trade Fair celebrated 100 years of statehood with a regional extravaganza which Williams documented with a number of souvenir postcards. Other well-known Portland festivals are the Rose Festival that began in 1907, and the Elks Parade of 1912, that featured a number of wooden pylons with electric lights lining Seventh Street at Morrison and various parade scenes. In 1915 over half a million school children signed a petition asking the city of Philadelphia to send the original Liberty Bell to the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco. The priceless symbol of American freedom traveled cross county and arrived in Portland on July 15, 1915 to a crowd of patriotic Oregonians. Other scenes of Portland include the reservoir at Washington Park, the monastery and gardens at the Sanctuary of Our Sorrowful Mother, views of various parks, the Soldiers’ Monument in Plaza Park and the Theodore Roosevelt Rough River Monument on the Park Blocks near the Portland Art Museum. There are also views of various recreational areas including: Dreamland of the Northwest, located at the top of Council Crest from 1907-1929; the Zooliner at the Portland Zoo; Thompson Fountain in Plaza Park; Coming of the White Man statue in Washington Park, Sacajawea Monument in Washington Park, Loyola House of Retreat and Oaks amusement park. In the spring of 1948 the Columbia River was swollen with runoff from unusually heavy snow pack melting in the northwestern United States and southern Canada. Flood waters were inundating Union Station and were threatening to overflow the banks of the Willamette River. On the afternoon of May 30, 1948 the railroad dike protecting the nearby city of Vanport was breached, sending a 10 foot wall of water into the low lying residential community. Constructed in 1943 for workers at the Kaiser Shipyard, Vanport residents were 40 percent African American who lived virtually segregated lives from the majority white residents. Although a college was established at Vanport in 1946, simmering race relations and anger over slow government response to the disaster heightened controversy over the destruction of the city. There are a number of aerial views of the flooding along with a series of selected souvenir snapshots such as one titled “Vanport City, Ore. Destroyed by the Mighty Columbia River”. Williams ended the photographs of the Portland and Oregon City with a view of a draw-span bridge over the Willamette River that was the longest in the world, images of the lighthouse at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers, and an early view of the Portland-Columbia Airport which later became the Portland International Airport.\n\n12.1-12.3 Series 11: Southern Coast Region - Oregon\n\n315 images, 3 folders\n\nFormat: There are 2 contemporary duplicate prints from the Douglas County Museum and 6 from unidentified sources.

Narrative Description: These folders consist of images documenting the scenery, towns and industries on the South Oregon coast from Gardiner south to Brookings. Establish in 1852, Reedsport was named from Alfred W. Reed who founded the town in 1912 with the coming of the railroad south to Coos Bay. The town is situated inland from the Oregon coast on the Umpqua River estuary. South of Reedsport on the coast are the Umpqua Lighthouse, the Umpqua Coast Guard Station and a jetty situated at the mouth of the Umpqua River. An 1857 view of the area shows an Indian Plank House which is labeled as Fort Umpqua. Fort Vancouver was actually established by the Hudson Bay Company in 1836 and consisted of a square stockade with a 12 foot wall of logs. North of Reedsport is Gardiner which was named for a Boston merchant whose ship was wrecked off the mouth of the Umpqua River in 1850. Gardiner, with the nearby Smith River Falls and Five Mile Lake, was surrounded by heavily forested mountains. The town was perfectly situated to take advantage of the growing lumber industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Lumber was shipped from the Gardiner Mill Wharf from 1885 to 1918, cut from area timber. Spruce trees, some up to 12 feet in diameter, were cut by hand with axes and long saws then transported out of the mountains in a system of log flumes. Other images from the Reedsport-Gardiner area include views of Lake Tahkenitch, the Reedsport Bridge on Highway 101 and a railroad bridge in the Reedsport area. South of Reedsport is Ten Mile Lake and the town of Lakeside, home of the Currier Village Resort on the shore of Ten Mile Lake. A postcard shows nearby Clear Lake which boasts of being the “Reedsport Water Supply.” A little farther south, on Highway 101, was the Whale Bone Inn at Hauser. This town was established as a station along with Southern Pacific Railroad line and is situated between Beale and Horsfall Lakes. North of Lakeside on Highway 101, is Winchester Bay home to the Stockade Tackle Shop. There are several early views of the bay including a ship placing buoys in the bay and of the South Umpqua Jetty. Originally known as Marshfield, the town of Coos Bay is situated along Highway 101 south of Reedsport, Winchester Bay and Lakeside on the bay. In 1944 the town voted to change the name to Coos Bay but retained North Bend for the town immediately to the north. A number of panoramic views show the town with wooden buildings constructed right up to the bayfront. Other postcards include the ducks at Mingus Park, local industry, such as the International Cedar Company and Marshfield Senior High School. On January 25, 1911 a rare snowstorm blanketed downtown Marshfield which was captured from a second story window. Over the years Coos Bay milling lumber and shipping have been important for the town’s prosperity and growth. Additional panoramas of Marshfield depict the lumber and shipping industries in the early 20th century. For years, companies such as the C.A. Smith Mill, in Coos Bay and others shipped their processed lumber from the port. Firms such as the Coos Lumber Company, transported logs and lumber by rail, while others used log rafts or steamships. In addition to the lumber industry, the Coos Bay-North Bend area was known for sturgeon and commercial fishing. The waters of the Pacific Ocean at Coos Bay have been the site of a number of shipping disasters over the years. In November 1915 the steamship Santa Clara struck and uncharted sandbar or reef with 91 passengers and 500 tons of cargo. The captain allowed the ship to drift toward shore, but heavy surf, fog, steady rain and darkness hindered rescue efforts which resulted in twelve deaths. After several days the stricken ship was plundered by locals and arson fires eventually destroyed the ship. Five years yearly, in January 1910, the Czarina left Coos Bay loaded with cement, coal and lumber headed for San Francisco. At the mouth of Coos Bay the ship encountered heavy waves which eventually flooded the ship and smashed or washed away many of the lifeboats. All but one member of the crew perished from exposure and drowning. Along the south shore of the opening into Coos Bay is Shore Acres, the former home of timber baron Louis J. Simpson, which is now part of the Oregon State Park system. Further inland is Charleston and the Coos River which flows into the bay. The Coos River is known for its excellent trout fishing and beautiful scenery. Over the years the Coos Bay area has been an important logging area with a log dump at Daniels Creek and special log cars pulled along the railroad tracks with cables. Among the natural wonders are Silver Falls and Golden Falls on the North Coos River. In 1936 the Conde B. McCullough Memorial Bridge, named for the noted Oregon bridge designer, was constructed across Coos Bay at North Bend. Southwest of the bridge, on the ocean front is Coos Head which marks the entrance to the bay. Southwest of Coos Head is Sunset Bay, Shore Acres State Park and the lighthouse at Cape Arago named for Dominique Francois Jean Arago (1786-1853) a noted French physicist and geographer. Cape Arago is also the site of the U.S. Coast Guard Station near Charleston, Oregon. Approximately 20 miles south of Cape Arago is Bandon, Oregon with its unique Natureland Auto Park “A Fairyland of Beauty and Art, Located on Bandon Beach Loop Road.” Complete with a Dutch inspired windmill and rustic shingled cottage, little historical information is available on this unusual vacation stop. On the ocean shoreline at Bandon are Face or Sphinx Rock, Cave of the Winds or Cave Rock and various beach and cliff scenes. Bandon area structures include the Life Guard Station perched high above the beach and Lighthouse #5 (or Coquille River lighthouse) on the mouth of the Coquille River. During the heyday of lumbering, the Coquille River was used to transport log rafts from the wooded mountains to the bay along with log drives which ended in the early 1940s. There is even a rare view of the steamboat “Coquille” and the S. S. Elizabeth traveling on the Coquille River as well as the Antelope loaded with a huge salmon catch. Upriver from Bandon is Coquille, Oregon with its three story clapboard public school and unique Coos County courthouse. For many years Coos County has been an important lumber producing area which Williams has documented with several postcards depicting lumberjacks laying in huge sawcuts or standing by large fallen trunks. Upriver from Coquille is Myrtle Point, which is situated in the Coquille Canyon, with Powers, Oregon 20 miles south of Myrtle Point. Powers was named in 1914 for A.H. Powers of the Smith-Powers Logging Company. Scenes from Powers show Bill standing and waving from atop a 150 spar tree as well as a significant gathering of deerskins and trophy mounts. There is the old Swimming Hole at Orchard Park and the railroad yard of the Smith-Powers Lumber Company with numerous railcars loaded with large trees. Almost due west of Powers on the Oregon coast is the Cape Blanco Lighthouse which is the most western point on the coast. There are ocean scenes along the Roosevelt Highway near Port Orford including Nellie’s Cove, Battle Rock where Captain William Tichenor and his crew fought with the native population on June 10, 1851 and Mother Carey’s Chickens with Humbug Mountain. In 1931 the beautiful Rogue River Bridge was completed at Gold Beach and is shown in a variety of scenes with anglers in boats and lining the shore fishing for salmon and trout. Gold Beach images also include the Sunset Inn, the Rogue-Au-Tel Cabins, The Breakers Inn and the “smallest Catholic Church in the United States”. This southern part of the Oregon Coast is also the home of myrtle trees which reportedly only grow here and “in the Holy Land.” Traveling south along the ocean on Highway 101 is Brookings with its Arch Rock and towering redwood trees. The Chetco River, which flows into the sea at Brookings, was also used to transport logs from the mountains to the lumber mills of Brookings. For years the Chetco River was also a well-known spawning ground for Oregon salmon.\n\n12.4 Series 12: Mohawk (Lane County) Region - Oregon\n\n41 images, 1 folder\n\nFormat: There are 2 contemporary duplicate prints from the University of Oregon and 2 from the USDA Forest Service. Also there is 1 print from the Oregon Historical Society, 1 from USDA Alfred Collier Collection and 1 from Southern Pacific Company. The bulk of the 16 postcards are sepia toned with black and white photographs, some color lithographed and contemporary images. The remaining 18 original photographs include 3 portraits, and 15 snapshots and photographs by nonprofessionals. Photographers: The photographers for most of these images are not identified, except for some postcards and photographs which have the photographer’s last name, or photo studio, written on the back of the print. Photographers include: Fred W. Cleator, G.E. Griffith, and [A.L.] Thomas. Narrative Description: This album contains images documenting the scenery, towns and industries in the Mohawk region of Lane County and a few images documenting the Willamette National Forest region by Oakridge, Oregon. The Mohawk River was named by Jacob C. Spores, a pioneer in the 1840s. A post office named after the river was established in1862 and was located seven miles upstream of Springfield, Oregon; the station was terminated in 1961. The town of Marcola, formerly known as Isabel, is documented. The town was named Isabel in 1857 after an early settler. After the railroad was built through the valley, the post office name was changed in 1901 to Marcola to match the station name. The town’s founder, Christopher Cole, chose Marcola to honor his wife, Mary Cole. Complementing the images of the post office and founder Christopher Cole are images of early community members and the homes they lived in. Established in 1878, the town of Mabel was named for Maud Mabel Drury, who was a daughter of the first postmaster, Alfred Drury. Mabel is located north of Marcola on the confluence of Shotgun Creek and the Mohawk River. The post office in Mabel was discontinued in 1957. Located between Mabel and Marcola is one of Lane County’s historic covered bridge titled Earnest Bridge. Accompanying photographs that document the area are envelopes from the Greater Eugene Stamp Society. Each envelope depicts a miniature picture of a town’s post office and provides information about the town. The information for Mabel tells how the post office caught fire while the photographer was taking the picture and the process had to be stopped in order to put out the fire. Wendling was established in 1899 and was named for George X. Wendling, a prominent Pacific Coast lumberman and director at one time of the Booth-Kelly Lumber Company. Wendling was a Booth-Kelly Lumber Company town. At the time it was established it held 250 inhabitants. The mill was closed due to the lack of timber and then burned down in the year of 1946; the post office was closed in 1952. The Wendling Covered Bridge located on Mill Creek is one of the few remaining landmarks of Wendling. Documented in this collection are several postcards featuring Wendling and families that had either passed through the lumber town or who had worked there. There are photographs of the town and various building such as the company bunk house which had 46 rooms. Also included are photographs of different parts of the logging operation including an image of a section of a two mile long log chute. The folder also contains images of a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp located beside Wendling in 1934. The images show different buildings and tents constructed for this temporary town, as well as workers waiting along the train tracks. The CCC camp was located near Wendling Oregon along the Bagene railroad, Project P-210 Co. No. 729. Logging has had a prominent history in Oregon especially in the areas around Oakridge, as depicted in a photograph of salvage logging, and a logging area near Westfir. The collection documents the Willamette National Forest with images, such as a planting station located near Oakridge, Oregon and an old bridge. There is also a photograph taken in 1951 at Taylor Burn Camp located in the Willamette National Forest. Another image depicts a crew of fire fighters in 1940 grouped together to get their photo taken. Also located in this folder is an image of Isaac Hamner’s ranch taken in 1901. Isaac Hamner settled on Hills Creek around 1884.\n\n13.1-13.4 Series 13: Central Coast Region - Oregon\n\n433 images, 4 folders\n\nFormat: There are 433 total images contained in the Oregon Central Coast album.
