        "text": "(CBS/AP) NEW YORK - You won't be seeing Grammy-winning R&B singer Maxwell on tour this summer.\n\nThe 39-year-old musician, whose real name is Gerald Maxwell Rivera, has cancelled his July and August concert dates after developing vocal swelling and hemorrhaging.\n\nA representative for the singer said Friday that he has been advised by doctors to rest and undergo treatment. Maxwell's six-date summer tour had shows planned for Los Angeles, Atlanta and Newark, N.J.\n\nThe MaxwellTwoNight (2012) was to feature back-to back shows in each city highlighting music from his four albums, including some that have never been performed live.\n\nMaxwell said in the statement that canceling the tour \"sucks\" and he plans to hit the road when his fifth album, \"blackSUMMERS'night,\" is released later this year.\n\nThe soul singer made his return to music in 2009 after a seven-year break with the platinum album \"BLACKsummers'night.\" It won the singer-songwriter two Grammy Awards, among other accolades.\n\nThe statement also said refunds are available."
