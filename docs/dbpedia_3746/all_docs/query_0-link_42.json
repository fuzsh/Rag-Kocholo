        "text": "1.\n\nNosedive 04:06\n\nThis is where everything begins. Get a life. Get to walk. Get to talk. Get to run. Get a bike. Get to school. Get to learn the crap. They say “You need to live a proper life”. Get you understand yourself! Get to dream. Learn to give. Get to build relationship. Get to know your friends. How they see… How to share. Get to turn away from everything. How they see the things. How to be street kings. Throwing stones to the sea. Being ourselves to never miss a beat. Every scar and every fault. Biggest smiles and broken bones. Everything you’ve ever needed is everything you’ve never known before.\n\n2.\n\nGuilty For Existing 02:29\n\nDays to keep them far away. Time to trap them. Worries are the same. Days full of traffic jams, full as ever, losing the sense of every simple silence. How long don’t you fill the lungs? Defiance! I'm doing everything, (all I can) but something keeps me unloaded. I don’t have scissors, neither blades. Where am I wrong? Keep me comatose. Have you ever thought, your life is easier than anyone else’s dream? No hands to untie. No hands to shake. No box to pack. No goals to reach.\n\n3.\n\nInsert Coin 04:06\n\nEndless road, strength adrift. Seeking the north for a better age. Lost the route, no one remains. This world collapses under our over weight. Blacklist / Persist. Lower than any frame of mind. Leaving this condition of supremacy. Blacklist / Persist. Lower than any frame of mind. Loosening your grip, basically you didn’t need to draw. Covered by new draft. Set smiles and conspiracy, fitting expressions. I hear the echo of the words behind. Forked tongues that they flattered before. Vicious circles of convenience, rest in peace. Nothing more to give you. Your tentacles are loosening the grip, making you free! Redemption for sinners, you’re looking for relief . Iron pressure to the temple. Heartbeat as an escaping thief. We share apologies to take up the past. Envy is moving us away making us foreigns. Last chance is dissolved. You’re dead into the gap.\n\n4.\n\nMind leaves this tired body. Observe the sinking ship. Those chains won’t stop it. Tell him… There are no regrets, no secrets. Nothing I forgot to tell you. Unfold this flesh, throw away the bones. Let me be, let me feel again. My eyes have seen enough about this life. I don’t deserve it. No reply to any crying. Burn this life. It’s a daily fighting. Curse their god! Cross this line alone. Remember anything of you. It’s gliding away from any kind of truth. It would be more credible if there was a light of reason. Lies, Lies! They told me nothing but Lies, Lies! They gave me nothing. Your faces, you should see them. That vinyl plays a long distressing theme.\n\n5.\n\nMissing Link 02:57\n\nSuicidal generation. Hard to tell and hard to see. Can not pretend, can not inhale, our last breath. Cheap intentions, can not sell them neither blindfolded and buried to the neck. Try to be a part of break. Missing link. Filling stinks. Spread a lie and let it bloom. Tried once… smashed later. Forever late, Forever debts. Tried once… Forever scorned, forever thief. Open your arms wide, receive the grief. Get yourself lost, hear yourself fail Keep yourself off, pray for consequence. Close every door to providence. Money and fame to smile with some gold tooth. Seeing lights going off, about this youth.\n\n6.\n\nBarefoot 01:43"
