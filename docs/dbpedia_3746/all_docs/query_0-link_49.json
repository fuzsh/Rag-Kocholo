        "text": "Creed\n\nComing out in 1997 Creed got extremely popular very quickly. They were clearly a cut above everyone else and it was really down to song writing. When they broke up and turned into Alter Bridge with Myles Kennedy in the place of Scott Stapp they were still great but for my money Scott Stapp had something to add to the mix that Myles didn’t when it came to song writing. I reckon that mark Tremonti wrote his best riffs in Creed and they were a really good band if you can get past the overly Christian themed lyrics. Scott is a brilliant example of singing about one thing and then living completely contrary to what he was promoting. Not the first time that staunch Christians have done this."
