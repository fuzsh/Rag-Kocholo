        "text": "Buckle up, we’re about to take a deep dive into the melodramatic abyss that is Creed‘s “My Own Prison.”\n\nCreed is the band that made post-grunge sound like it was sung by a brooding prophet who had just discovered their first leather jacket.\n\nFrom the start, the album plunges you into a vortex of existential angst and guttural baritone growls. Scott Stapp’s voice is like a philosophical foghorn, blasting deep thoughts through your eardrums with all the subtlety of a midlife crisis Harley Davidson.\n\nLet’s start with the title track, “My Own Prison.” The song’s theme? Imagine you’re stuck in an evil Escape Room, but instead of puzzles, it’s just your feelings and a lot of rain. Stapp croons about being trapped in a metaphorical cell, which is relatable if you’ve ever been stuck in line at the DMV with only your regrets for company.\n\nThe hit single “Torn” sounds like a therapy session where the therapist is a guitar and the patient is trying hard not to cry. The lyrics are deep. So deep that you might need a snorkel to avoid drowning in the sea of metaphors about inner turmoil and spiritual conflict.\n\n“What’s This Life For” offers some existential musings that will have you nodding along thoughtfully before realizing you have no idea what he’s singing about. It’s like those times you pretend to understand high art but you’re just there for the free wine. The chorus repeats the line “We all live under the reign of one king,” which sounds profound until you realize he’s probably talking about his hair, which is indeed majestic and regal.\n\nMusically, the album is a relentless barrage of power chords and earnest strumming, perfectly engineered for those introspective moments when you stare out of a rainy window, pondering life’s big questions like “Why did I wear white socks with sandals?” or “Is this my third or fourth cup of coffee today?”\n\nAnd who could forget “One“? It’s the anthem for anyone who’s ever wanted to hold their lighter aloft at a concert while swaying with the grace of a tipsy penguin. The message is about unity and peace, which is heartwarming if not slightly ironic coming from a band whose music inspires people to air-guitar in their living rooms aggressively.\n\n“My Own Prison” by Creed is a tour de force of moody rock anthems that will either make you question your existence or simply your choice in music.\n\nIt’s the perfect soundtrack for anyone looking to have a deep, soulful cry while still feeling kinda badass. So, dust off your flannel shirt, crank up the volume, and let Creed guide you through the murky waters of late-90s rock existentialism.\n\nJust remember: no matter how tough things get, at least you’re not stuck in Scott Stapp’s metaphorical prison. Or, you know, an actual Creed concert.\n\nScore 4/10\n\nTrack List\n\nSide A\n\n1. Torn\n\n2. Ode\n\n3. My Own Prison\n\n4. Pity For A Dime\n\n5. In America\n\nSide B\n\n6. Illusion\n\n7. Unforgiven\n\n8. Sister\n\n9. What’s This Life For\n\n10. One\n\nLabel – Wind-Up\n\nRelease – 16th December 2022\n\nFor all things Creed, click HERE, and to purchase the album, click HERE"
