        "text": "Bullets Bullets deals with the same issue as 'What If' - Creed's critics. The metaphor of \"shooting a bullet through my head\" is one of people running their mouths behind the band's back. Scott tells them and shouts for them to either say it to his face (\"at least look at me...\"), or don't say anything at all. Stapp thinks the people who put him down are jealous of his life, (\"I think they shoot cause they want it!\"). He then calls for those shooting at them to show themselves, (\"raise your head\") and at least be man enough to face the consequences of actions. Fred Durst and others aggravated Stapp further, into write the song. Signs This song is about labels. Everyone labels other things and other people, and alot of the time, they are based on bad stereotypes or mis-information. The chorus is talking about Creed losing 'their' identity, with people's opinions of the band being based on other's ideas and comments, rather than listening to the music. Scott asks for us to come with him and see the signs, see what Creed are really about.\n\nOne Last Breath In this song, he thinks he's dying, but with the last bit of life left in him (his last breath) he's trying to hold onto what he loved about life. He was going nowhere in his life it seemed, but he could not escape. In the second verse, the outlook looks even more bleak (now that it's over). His life is flashing before his eyes. The next part of the song shows how he thinks he can go on, (But I still believe there's something left for me), but he's down to one last breath. My Sacrifice \"This brings tears to my eyes, my sacrifice\" What sacrifice is Scott talking about? This song sounds uplifting and happy. But the situation was Infact very sad, but this song is looking back at the good times, reminiscing about a life and love that had been given away for something else. Who and what is it about? Scott has given a life away. One of being a normal dad and a normal family man, he's given away his wife, the woman he loved. That's Scott's sacrifice. All that to lead the time consuming life of helping people around the world through the music of Creed. Stand Here With Me This is about someone who inspires Scott. The first 3 lines tell of someone who helped Scott experience things, and he will cherish that they did it together. The chorus \"You stand here with me\" keeps this idea going, that the person is standing there with him as he experiences life. This help is so important to Scott that he wrote this song about that person, making them into the song so they may live on for ever. The person pushed Scott even when he was scared, and he owes them everything, and will always be indebted to them. In the second verse, Scott talks of a humbling experience, by being around this person, he now sees that there are bigger issues in life, something he couldn't realize before. Lullaby This song was written for Jagger, Scott Stapp's son.\n\nWhat If This is a song dedicated to the tyranny of the Media. Creed has had little Media attention and the little attention the do have has been negative. Faceless Man No One really knows who exactly Creed are referring to here - some people believe Scott Stapp is talking about himself while others say he's talking about God. I guess it's one of those things they will 'take to their grave'. Beautiful \"Don't judge a book by it's cover\". Something that may look appealing could really be something that will destroy you. \"Beautiful is empty\". Never Die It's about holding onto you. The music kinda holds that tone of loosing your youth. Im not going to let go of youth, I'm going to hold it forever. - Scott Stapp With Arms Wide Open This song was written when Scott Stapp had his son, Jagger. It celebrates the beauty of life and his feelings of becoming a father. Higher Higher is about a dream Stapp had where he was having a re-occuring\n\ndream that someone was chasing him - trying to kill him. He would always turn\n\nright and the person would end up catching him. Then Stapp heard about a\n\nthing called lucid dreaming and decided to try it with this dream. It worked - he was able to turn left in the dream and escape the killer. A Truly Amazing song - in my view... Creed's Best. Wash Away Those Years This song is written for a friend of Scott Stapp who was wronged - she was raped. Tragic incident - beautiful song."
