They were completly unoriginal. I didn't see one interesting concept come out of that band, just a bunch of stereotypes and cliches.\n\n2. They were way overproduced. There is something to be said for lack of production, it's what has made Rick Rubin one of the greatest producers of all time. Creed's albums had a polish that has no place in rock music.\n\n3. They took themselves way too seriously. Have you seen any of their videos? They tried far too hard to be epic and just ended up being laughable.\n\n4. They sounded like bad Pearl Jam wannabies. Come on, why listen to the crappy knock offs when you have the real thing?\n\ntonadax wrote:\n\nfirst at all Pearl jam are far better than Creed, and stapp was a vedder wannabe, but i consider that creed was a good band, with many great songs, and well produced albums, especially their first two....\n\nsometimes i´m listening my own prison and i think i would like hear mcready-gossard playing powerful guitars tunes like tremonti did in this album..."
