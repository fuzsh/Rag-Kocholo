So I held my head up high Hiding hate that burns inside Which only fuels their selfish pride And I said oh... All held captive Out from the sun A sun that shines on only some We the meek are all in one I hear a thunder in the distance See a vision of a cross I feel the pain that was given On that sad day of loss A lion roars in the darkness Only He holds the key A light to free me from my burden And grant me Life eternally Should have been dead On a Sunday morning Banging my head No time for mourning Ain't got no time Should have been dead On a Sunday morning Banging my head No time for mourning Ain't got no time And I said oh... So I held my head up high Hiding hate that burns inside Which only fuels their selfish pride And I said oh... All held captive Out from the sun A sun that shines on only some We the meek are all in one I cry out to God Seeking only his decision Gabriel stands and confirms I've created my own prison I cry out to God Seeking only his decision Gabriel stands and confirms I've created my own prison And I said oh... So I held my head up high Hiding hate that burns inside Which only fuels their selfish pride And I said oh... All held captive Out from the sun A sun that shines on only some We the meek are all in one And I said oh... So I held my head up high Hiding hate that burns inside Which only fuels their selfish pride And I said oh... All held captive (I've created) Out from the sun (I've created) A sun that shines on only some (I've created) We the meek are all in one (I've created my own prison) Should have been dead On a Sunday morning Banging my head No time for mourning Ain't got no time"
