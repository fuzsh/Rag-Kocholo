        "text": "Court is in session, a verdict is in\n\nNo appeal on the docket today just my own sin\n\nThe walls cold and pale, the cage made of steel\n\nScreams fill the room, alone I drop and kneel\n\nSilence now the sound, my breath the only motion around\n\nDemons cluttering around, my face showing no emotion\n\nShackled by my sentence, expecting no return\n\nHere there is no penance, my skin begins to burn\n\n(And I said, ohh) So I held my head up high\n\nHiding hate that burns inside\n\nWhich only fuels their selfish pride\n\n(And I said, ohh) All held captive out from the sun\n\nA sun that shines on only some\n\nWe the meek are all in one\n\nI hear a thunder in the distance, see a vision of a cross\n\nI feel the pain that was given on that sad day of loss\n\nA lion roars in the darkness, only he holds the key\n\nA light to free me from my burden and grant me life eternally\n\nShould have been dead on a Sunday morning, banging my head\n\nNo time for mourning\n\nAin′t got no time\n\nShould have been dead on a Sunday morning, banging my head\n\nNo time for mourning\n\nAin't got no time\n\n(And I said, ohh) So I held my head up high\n\nHiding hate that burns inside\n\nWhich only fuels their selfish pride\n\n(And I said, ohh) All held captive out from the sun\n\nA sun that shines on only some\n\nWe the meek are all in one\n\nI cry out to God, seeking only His decision\n\nGabriel stand and confirms, I′ve created my own prison\n\nI cry out to God, seeking only His decision\n\nGabriel stand and confirms, I've created my own prison\n\n(And I said, ohh) So I held my head up high\n\nHiding hate that burns inside\n\nWhich only fuels their selfish pride\n\n(And I said, ohh) All held captive out from the sun\n\nA sun that shines on only some\n\nWe the meek are all in one\n\n(And I said, ohh) So I held my head up high\n\nHiding hate that burns inside\n\nWhich only fuels their selfish pride\n\n(And I said, ohh) All held captive out from the sun\n\nA sun that shines on only some\n\nWe the meek are all in one\n\nShould have been dead on a Sunday morning, banging my head\n\nNo time for mourning\n\nAin't got no time\n\nWriter(s): Scott A.
