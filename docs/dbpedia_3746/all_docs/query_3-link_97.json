        "text": "Creed is an American rock band, formed in 1993 in Tallahassee, Florida. The band's best-known line-up consists of lead vocalist Scott Stapp, guitarist and vocalist Mark Tremonti, bassist Brian Marshall, and drummer Scott Phillips. Creed released four studio albums, My Own Prison in 1997, Human Clay in 1999, Weathered in 2001, and Full Circle in 2009.\n\nBecoming popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the band released three consecutive multi-platinum albums, with Human Clay certified Diamond (representing 10 million records sold). Creed has sold over 30 million records in the United States, and over 50 million albums worldwide, becoming the ninth best-selling artist of the 2000s. Creed is often recognized as the prominent act of the post-grunge movement of the late 1990s and early 2000s\n\nCreed toured extensively through its reign atop rock music, but for Scott, the musical machinery to keep the show going meant some terrible at a personal cost, as he battled depression. His creativity, passion, and desire to be transparent in his struggle were evident throughout many projects including his debut solo album, “The Great Divide” (2005), the full-circle album from a “rebirthed” Creed in 2009, several tours, his starkly revealing memoir “Sinner’s Creed” (2012), and his highly-acclaimed second solo album “Proof of Life” (2013), which brought Scott’s first number one song on the Christian charts.\n\nScott’s personal challenges proved to be the most harrowing chapter of his life. With the love and support of his family, grounded in his faith, he fought through and overcame his struggles. With a fresh purpose in performing, writing, and singing, he longs to bring hope to “even one person” who is amidst the kind of struggle he has lived. Scott is now sharing his personal story with the world. Hope and overcome has always been a theme of his music, and now, that level of hope takes on a whole new dimension.\n\nIn gratitude for the many interventions made on his behalf, Scott devotes himself to “paying it forward” to others in need through numerous outreaches. He created the “With Arms Wide Open Foundation” in 2000 to help underprivileged children and families around the world. He is also involved with CHARM (Children Are Magical), which his wife founded to heighten the awareness of children’s issues and provide underprivileged youth with the tools to enrich their lives. In addition to fundraising, Scott personally has contributed $1 million dollars to support the foundation’s mission helping children and families in need over the last 18 years.\n\nCurrently, Scott resides in Franklin, TN with his wife, Jaclyn, and their three children. He is currently in studio recording his third solo album. (Spring 2018)"
