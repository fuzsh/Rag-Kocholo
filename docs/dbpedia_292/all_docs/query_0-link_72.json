We have a photo of a truck with the right livery but can’t find out the colour scheme… This is from the period when BP had bought out National Benzole… I think in the early 1980s\n\n[/img]\n\nI would like your help with the colours of the tanker and in particular the stripe. We’re pretty sure that Mr Mercury was the usual white and blue but the shading looks different here, so perhaps he was different too.\n\nCan anyone help please?\n\nMy old tanker friend is Pete Farrow who drove tankers for 30 years\n\nThanks in advance"
