        "text": "National Benzole joined the Shell-Mex and BP Ltd family in 1957 but continued to trade separately.\n\nIn 1959, responding to the growing importance of benzole as a specialist chemical, it was decided to concentrate on this market by means of a new company named Benzole Producers Limited.[1] At the same time the motor fuel marketing business was now fully merged with Shell-Mex and BP Ltd.[1] Benzole (no longer part of the mixture) was dropped from the fuel's name and Mr Mercuryâ€™s black and chrome gave way to sparkling new yellow, blue and white. Following the de-merger of Shell-Mex and British Petroleum (BP) in 1976, the National brand continued to be distinctively marketed by BP for over a decade.\n\nP.S.: Buffers still seem to have the following Dapol Scottish 14t tanker: Scottish Cables of Renfrew\n\nShown on p95 of the book mentioned in my last posting."
