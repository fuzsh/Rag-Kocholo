Benzole is a coal-tar product consisting mainly of benzene and toluene and was initially used as a 'motor spirit' - an alternative to petroleum spirits.

        "text": "Our Terms of sale were designed to treat both Customers and Vendors (including Professional Vendors and Non-Professional Vendors (as defined in the Site Terms)) fairly, in order to make the shopping/selling experience with Vinterior just as exceptional as the items.\n\nTo protect our Customers from disappointment or the unexpected, we strongly encourage them to closely inspect item photos, descriptions, and details before purchasing anything on the Site, and then again upon delivery or pickup.\n\nIf the Customer is unsure about an item's condition, dimensions, quantity, or description, they can send their questions to the item’s Vendor by clicking on Ask the seller on the listing page of the Site.\n\nCustomers shall receive the same level of consumer protection on purchases irrespective of whether they are buying from a Professional Vendor or Non-Professional Vendor.\n\nShould you have any questions regarding your transaction, please contact the Vendor in the first instance.\n\nCan I cancel an order?\n\nIf a Customer changes their mind or decides for any other reason that they do not want to purchase the Goods before the Goods have been dispatched, they can cancel the order on the Site and receive a refund.\n\nThe right to cancel does not apply to the following types of Goods, which are non-refundable: items that are personalised, bespoke or made-to-order to the customer’s specific requirements. If in doubt, the Customer can contact the Vendor via the Site.\n\nIf the Customer cancels an order after an item has already been marked as dispatched for delivery, the costs of delivery are non-refundable.\n\nTo cancel the order, the Customer must follow the cancellation procedure on the Site by clicking on Create Cancellation on the order page.\n\nCan I return an item?\n\nConsumers based in the UK and European Union can request to return the Goods on Vinterior up to 14 days after the Goods have been received. Once accepted, the buyer is in charge of the shipment and should organise it as soon as possible (except in the case of a return of faulty Goods).\n\nTo initiate a return, the Customer must click on Create a return on the order page on the Site. In the return request, the reason for the return must be included along with photos of any damage of the Goods, if faulty.\n\nAs with cancellations, the right to return an item does not apply to the following types of Goods, which are non-refundable: items that are personalised, bespoke or made-to-order to the Customer’s specific requirements.\n\nAdditionally, the Customer may not return an item for \"inaccurate listing” reason when its dimensions or other characteristics do not fit its requirements. We strongly recommend that buyer measures all access areas prior to making a purchase.\n\nIf in doubt, the Customer can contact the Vendor via the Site.\n\nIn case of a return, the costs of delivery (i.e., outbound delivery costs when Goods are sent from the Vendor to a Customer) are non-refundable.\n\nThe Customer is responsible for organising the return of Goods and for paying delivery costs. Once the item is returned to the Vendor in the same condition, the Vendor will confirm receipt and refund the Customer. If an item is returned to the seller damaged, or in an unsuitable condition, Vinterior will not be able to process the refund and the seller may have to send it back to you (and ask you to cover the delivery costs). All items are inspected on return.\n\nActing under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, customers may return faulty Goods that are damaged in transportation or the listing on the Site is materially inaccurate, misleading, or misrepresents the Goods. In these cases, the Customer must provide photographic evidence to Vinterior and the Vendor or reject the delivery on arrival.\n\nIn case of damage in transit for all items, Vinterior must be informed. Vinterior will then raise an insurance claim on behalf the Vendor with delivery company Proovia. Once the claim is resolved and any relevant decision regarding the insurance has been made, any applicable refunds will be processed.\n\nPlease note that vintage items are not sold as new and are likely to show signs of wear and tear. This is not sufficient grounds for a refund.\n\nVendors may refuse a return of an item if it has been altered by the Customer in any way.\n\nNeither Vinterior nor the Vendors are liable for any damages or loss sustained in transit via third parties."
