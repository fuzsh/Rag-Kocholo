        "text": "Paul Sharp created a beautiful sketch of Castell Coch for a 1960s motoring guide to castles in the UK. I picked up a copy and discovered a fantastic collection of artwork by the Yorkshire designer.\n\nNational Benzole was a petrol brand in the UK from 1919 until the 1990s. Perhaps these books were produced to encourage motorists to visit more sites and buy more petrol.\n\nThe “Castles”, “Follies” and “Monuments” books were combined and reissued in 1967. This version credits E. M. Hatt and Paul Sharp on the cover and features Castell Coch on the inner title page.\n\nI fell in love with this sketch the first time I saw it. Paul Sharp’s work is 60 years old but feels very contemporary."
