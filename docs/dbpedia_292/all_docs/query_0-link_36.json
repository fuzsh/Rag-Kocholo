        "text": "Monday 3rd August 2015 one finds oneself wide wake in the Rydeview Hotel.\n\nFaced with a breakfast best described as indescribable.\n\nI arose and departed, not angry but hungry.\n\nMade my way to the corner of Southsea Common, where once we drank – Tim Rushton and I were often to be found in The Wheelbarrow together.\n\nA boozer no longer, now named for the city’s long gone famous son.\n\nHow bad a pub is this? I walk past it to get to my local. Most nights there are six people max in the bar, all huddled around the bar itself, backs to the door. – this often includes the landlord and landlady. They have live music there once in a while and you can’t get served by the one bloke behind the bar – the landlord and landlady never help out, they don’t seem to give a toss.\n\nBeers crap, not worth a visit.\n\nIt was never like that in our day.\n\nVisiting our former abode on Shaftesbury Road – where I once dwelt along with Tim, Catherine, Liz and Trish.\n\nYet more Stymie Bold Italic.\n\nBack to the front for a peer at the pier.\n\nClarence Pier is an amusement pier located next to Southsea Hoverport. Unlike most seaside piers in the UK, the pier does not extend very far out to sea and instead goes along the coast.\n\nThe pier was originally constructed and opened in 1861 by the Prince and Princess of Wales and boasted a regular ferry service to the Isle of Wight. It was damaged by air raids during World War II and was reopened in its current form on 1 June 1961 after being rebuilt by local architects AE Cogswell & Sons and R Lewis Reynish.\n\nLow cloud grey skies and drizzle.\n\nThis sizeable two bedroom apartment situated on the seventh floor of the ever popular Fastnet House is offered with no onward chain and the option of a new 999 year lease as well as a share of the freehold. With panoramic views over The Solent towards the Isle Of Wight and Spinnaker Tower, situated in a central location and close to all amenities, this lovely apartment offers luxury living for any prospective buyer. With lift access, the apartment comprises; entrance hallway, a large lounge diner with box bay window boasting stunning sea views across the city and The Solent, master bedroom with built in wardrobes and sea views over The Solent, a spacious second bedroom, fitted kitchen with breakfast bar and a recently updated modern shower room.\n\nOn The Market £365,000\n\nWe are fully stocked with house coal, smokeless coal, kindling and fire lighters, fire grates, companion sets and fire tools.\n\nChristmas lights have also arrived.\n\nBrockenhurst’s traditional hardware shop since 1926\n\nGhost garage.\n\nGhost post.\n\nCoal Exchange – Peter and Dawn welcome you to their traditional pub in the heart of Emsworth adjacent to the public car park in South Street and close to the harbour.\n\nLillywhite Bros Ltd is a family run business established over 60 years ago in Emsworth, which is ideally located between Portsmouth and Chichester. It is currently run by brothers Paul and Mike who continue to keep up with modern techniques and equipment, as well as maintaining their traditional values and high standard of customer service.\n\nNext thing you know I’m in Pagham, having become very lost somewhere between there and here, asking for directions from the newsagents and buying a bottle of Oasis.\n\nThe newsagent was mildly amused by lack of map, sense and/or sensibility.\n\nI spent many happy hours here in my youth playing the slots with The King.\n\nWe would stay here in Tamarisk with my Aunty Alice and Uncle Arthur and Smudge the cat, an idyllic railway carriage shack two rows back from the pebbled seashore.\n\nWe would enjoy a shandy at the King’s Beach with Lydia, Wendy and David.\n\nAll gone it seems.\n\nOn to Bognor a B&B and a brew – a brief glimpse into my luxury lifestyle.\n\nI’ll take an overcast Monday evening stroll along the prom, where I chanced to meet two landlocked Chinese lads, gazing amazed at the sea – they were on a course in Chichester learning our own particular, peculiar ways.\n\nThere was no-one else around.\n\nWho can resit the obvious allure of the novelty item?\n\nOr an Art Deco garage fascia.\n\nFitzleet House was built in the 1960s architects: Donald Harwin & Partners, it consists of seventy four flats, fifteen of them are in a three-storey block next to the main building.\n\nPS&B are pleased to offer this sixth floor flat which is situated conveniently close to the town centre and within close proximity of the sea front. The accommodation is newly refurnbished and is offered unfurnished with south/west facing lounge with small balcony with far reaching views to the sea. Kitchen and bathroom with shower over bath and one double bedroom. Further benefiting from having modern electric heating and double glazing, telephone entry system, lift to all floors, communal sky dish and white goods. With regret no pets and no children – £685 rental is payable calendar monthly in advance.\n\nFor many years, a gentleman called Todd Sweeney collected sunshine statistics from the roof of Fitzleet House, which were then forwarded to the Met Office in London to assist with national statistics, and in 1983 one group of Cubs arranged a special tea party on the roof of the building as part of the national tea-making fortnight.\n\nBognor Regis Post\n\nHighlight of the day or any day for that matter the Health Centre.\n\nPaul English Conservative Felpham East – asked about the life span of the building given it was built in the 1960s, describing it as ‘incredibly old’.\n\nMr Clavell-Bate replied – NHS Property Services say it is structurally sound, it has a life expectancy going forward.\n\nBognor Regis Observer\n\nI was looking forward to going forward Wetherspoon’s – ideologically unsound going forward, with hindsight.\n\nLet’s take a last late night stroll along the promenade.\n\nNight night."
