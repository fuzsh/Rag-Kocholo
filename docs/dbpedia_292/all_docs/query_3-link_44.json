        "text": "National Smurf is a non-canonical Smurf character created and used for the National Benzole advertisements ever since the now defunct petrol company made a series of commercials featuring the Smurfs.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nIn some commercials, he was seen with or without a mustache, while his Smurf hat had a wing, based on the National Benzole logo that had a human head wearing a winged helmet (Mr. Mercury).\n\nHis Role and Job[]\n\nOriginally, he leads the Smurfs into helping the station in the commercial and he sings the Father Abraham-like theme jingle with the Smurfs. He originally has a deep-masculine voice when he talks, and when he sings, his voice is natural and cool.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHe was a non-canonical Smurf character only for the NB commercial series.\n\nIn September 1979, when BP was selling merchandise featuring The Smurfs in Australia, they created a series of animated commercial featuring Papa Smurf and the other Smurfs. These commercials reused \"Het Smurfenlied\" (The Smurf Song) and had Papa Smurf singing the lyrics to the other Smurfs playing a similar role to National's in the 1978 commercials."
