        "text": "Original National Benzole keyfob badges which will have been produced in the late 1950s which we have remounted onto new leather keyfobs as can be seen in the photos .\n\nWhen these keyrings have been sold this listing will be cancelled .\n\nJust 2 keyrings left at present\n\nThe badges which we mount onto these keyrings are original vitreous enamel badges which are over 60 years old.\n\nMost of the original badges which have survived are no longer in good condition – but we only use badges which are in very good condition although with close scrutiny even these may have slight marks after 50 years of use.\n\nYou will be buying an original 60 year old vitreous enamel badge mounted onto a new leather keyfob.\n\nThis will then be good for another 60 years of use – provided motoring as we know it today lasts that long !\n\nThe National Benzole ‘Mr. Mercury’ with winged helmet was one of the most successful and well known advertising images of the 20th Century- instantly recognisable .\n\nIt became a symbol of all that was good and trusted in motoring at that time – almost like The Bank of England.\n\nWe still look at that badge with that familiar winged helmet profile and wistfully think that image and what it represents can never be bettered.\n\nWe are offering these original badges remounted onto our slimline teardrop keyfobs in full grain black leather – which is how they were originally mounted.\n\nOccasionally we also have the later badges which have ‘Super’ on them in red enamel- also the much later square ‘National’ badge with the winged head set on a blue background :\n\nWhen these are available then they will be listed here in the shop in a separate listing."
