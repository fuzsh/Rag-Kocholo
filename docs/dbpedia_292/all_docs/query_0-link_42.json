After leaving the Tyne we had to put in to Falmouth for repairs to the radio and other small repairs but because the vessel's speed was well below the dclared contract speed for the voyage the contract was going to be re-negotiated. I too had other forthcoming work contracts which I may miss so was relieved. However I do know that the vessel completed the passage via the Azores.\n\nRegards - Robin Craythorn."
