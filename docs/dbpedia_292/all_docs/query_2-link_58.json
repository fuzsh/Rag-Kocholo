It is one of the most complete set of portfolios we have from this key period in the AA’s history...\n\nWe are highlighting here some further treasures unearthed during the digitisation of the AA Archives' architectural lantern slide collection - one of the largest and most important surviving such archives in the UK...\n\nAA Collections Blog is pleased to publish an extract from Patrick Zamarian's authoritative new book on the postwar history of the AA (Lund Humphries, 2020). Making extensive use of the AA Archives, this is the first major study of the school in the 1950s and 60s - and is available for purchase, in time for Christmas, at the AA Bookshop!!\n\n\"Architecture is a conception of the mind. It must be conceived in your head with your eyes shut… Architecture is organisation. YOU ARE A ORGANISER, NOT A DRAWING BOARD STYLIST.\"\n\nIn Peter Cook's words: \"it was as an ace airbrush artist that she became a star... Every project has been turned upside down. She invented machines, she parodied gadgets, she parodied the heroic architectural monument...\"\n\nIf you're searching for details of certain building types or specific buildings, the AA Library has a new database that can help. Building Types Online is a resource for the study and practice of architectural design, based on Birkhäuser's professional architecture books.\n\nWhile many of us continue to spend more time than we would like in our own homes, the AA Archive invites you to live vicariously through photographs of our 19th century predecessors out-and-about on their distinctly non-social-distanced annual excursions...\n\n\"Although the actual idea that a building actually moves like a machine or a creature is physically absurd, the idea that a building, representing an institution or community, has an animus, is not... \"\n\nSince its opening in 1921 by the former Prime Minster, HH Asquith, the AA Library has hosted some remarkable performances - it has accommodated fire-eaters, male strippers, chickens, snakes… and final tables… But one legendary performance stands out – a poetry reading on the 15th July, 1965, featuring the leading figures of The Beat Generation, including Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Gregory Corso and Andrei Voznesensky.\n\nIn these days of social distancing and online meetings we look back to a 1968 project by AA students Dolan Conway and Brian Mitchenere which imagines a future communication network where the power of computer systems is harnessed for society and ‘distance becomes no-distance and the electronic wave is the permissive force of our future life...’\n\nThe AA Archives is proud to announce that it is a partner in a new international collaborative network, funded by Arts and Humanities Research Council. Working with the V&A, the Soane Museum, the RIBA, the Sorbonne...\n\nChernikhov’s teaching method used abstraction to explore the endless compositional possibilities in modern architecture. During this period, his abstract architectural fantasies were not utopias or romantic social daydreams, but a method of freeing the architect from “outmoded conservative methods and [allowing] them to give their imagination free rein”...\n\nThe family of AA alum, Amarjit Kalsi (1957-2014), have donated a set of his virtuosic student drawings. Amo worked for Richard Rogers and Partners, where he played a leading role on some of their most prestigious projects including the Lloyds building, the Millennium Dome, the European court of human rights building in Strasbourg, and Barajas airport in Madrid...\n\nDonald Trump is a controversial figure. He thrives on controversies, he enjoys them, they are inseparable to his public persona. His taste is as controversial as his speeches - his devotion to gold is the central component of his aesthetic credo...\n\nThe Martin Creed pre-album launch performance in the AA Canteen in June this year prompted much heated discussion in the Bar over which famous bands had or had not played at the AA in the past...\n\nThe AA Archives are pleased to announce a major donation of work by Martyn L.
