        "text": "Original National Benzole keyrings which will have been produced in 1957 .\n\nWhen all these keyrings have been sold this listing will be cancelled .\n\nJust 1 keyring left\n\nThese keyrings are over 60 years old and are in brand new un-issued condition.\n\nThey were left at The Progress Garage in Yapton Lane, Walberton, Near Arundel in West Sussex ( telephone no. Yapton 234 ) by the National Benzole representative whose name was Mr. Matthews – in 1957 !\n\nPromotional keyrings ready for handing out over the Easter & Whitsun holidays.\n\nAlthough not marked as such – we know that these keyrings were made by Sculthorps of London at the time.\n\nToo much information ? Not really – this is the sort of motoring history which went largely unrecorded.\n\nThese keyrings were all that was left in the box after the rest had been given out to customers who had petrol accounts at the garage.\n\nThe box was put up on a shelf & only recently came to light.\n\nHow do we know ? Because they came to us from the man who put the box up on that shelf in 1957 !\n\nWe have just a few to offer as shown in the photos complete with the tie-on label. When they have all been sold it is very doubtful that any more will ever appear !"
