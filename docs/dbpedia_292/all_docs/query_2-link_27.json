        "text": "Photos taken in Baildon often have vehicles and/or adverts in them and collecting info about them can be interesting and help with dating photos.\n\nOnes with their own page\n\nTowngate Stocks and Cross, 1920s - photo details\n\nBrowgate 1925 - photo details\n\nTowngate Stocks and Cross, 1920s\n\nBrowgate 1925\n\nBristol Type J & L\n\nTwo West Yorkshire Road Car Bristol JOG5s new in 1937, with 977 on the right and 999 on the left. Both have ECW32-seat front-entrance bodies and were withdrawn in 1955 and 1952 respectively.\n\n977 was on the 58 to Bradford via Sandals Road, Shipley, Bolton Woods and Canal Road, while 999 also destined for Bradford was on the 61 via Baildon Green, Shipley and Manningham Lane. The two crews are having a chat during their layover, with the conductresses dressed in light coloured smocks. Readers who are knowledgeable on the Road Car company may be able to determine if this is pre or post-war, and if Blythe & Berwick originally operated either of these services.\n\nBoth the Bristol J or L type single deckers were prewar from the 1930s BUT the installation of roller type destination screens to replace the original tin \"bible\" type took place piecemeal after 1946 and the last of the class were withdrawn in the early to mid 1950s.[1]\n\nOther things noticeable in this photo are the petrol pump globes on the wall behind the Potted Meat Stick. From the right they are Shell (the shape is obviously Shell but the bottom section of it is more horizontal than many globes), Esso (the word \"Esso\" is legible and the shape is typical), National Benzole, (the silhouette of the winged head in the circle can be identified, and the shape is typical), Cleveland Discol (the word \"Discol\" is just legible and the shape is classic Cleveland). The one on the left is thought to be Pratt's, the shape is right and if the top left has been rubbed off it fits. The letters seem to be \"Moto\" but no petrol/oil/fuel of that name can be found.\n\nThe premises on the right are J W Noble the local tinsmith.\n\nWhen looking for these petrol pump signs I found out several things:-\n\nNational Benzole mix is a mix of petrol and benzole that is produced from coal. In the 1920s it was cheaper to produce benzole than it was to produce petrol.\n\nCleveland were allowed to use the name Discol in their product with permission from Distillers with the agreement that the alcohol used in the mix came from Distillers.\n\nNational Benzole\n\nShell\n\nCleveland Discol\n\nPratt's\n\nCarnival Bus 1931\n\nThis West Yorkshire Road Car bus (WX 6687, old number 537) is decked out for Baildon Carnival. Info from Allen Williams says 1931. The bus was built in 1931 and rebodied in 1936. It was retired in 1948/9.[2]\n\nThe \"..LAND 1/3\" that can be seen on the Angel Garage is an enamel sign for Cleveland Guaranteed petrol. See example below but different price. We have other photos showing that the Angel Garage sold Cleveland petrol.\n\nThe sign just to the left of the Potted Meat Stick that reads \"Domin..\", is a sign for Dominion Motor Spirit. The price is not visible but I have shown and example below that has the same price as the Cleveland Guaranteed.\n\nI would like to know what it says on the big board above the Angel Hotel. It looks like \"???? Electrical Co.\"\n\nChairs are arranged in front of the garage and Noble's Tinsmiths with people sitting on them, waiting for a performance perhaps?. Speakers are on the garage.\n\nOn top of the bus is a large crown.\n\nIt is likely that the Baildon Carnival in 1931 was the Gypsy Carnival.\n\nSee here for images taken from the 1931 Gypsy Carnival programme\n\nCleveland Guaranteed\n\nAsk For Dominion\n\nSingle Decker\n\nThis photo was used in the Baildon War Services Comforts Fund Christmas card for 1945 but the name of the shop has been changed. The original photo shows J Hodgson as the name of the shop whereas the image with the card show T Bottomley but they are quite definitely the same original photo.\n\nThe shop is J Hodgson, Newsagent. Above the door \"Circulating Library\"\n\nNote that the cap on the cross looks recently carved. Previous caps had metal arms and a finial.\n\nThe bus/coach is is a 1927 Leyland Lion similar to one restored by the Aire Valley Transport Group. Most of West Yorkshire's Leyland Lions had been withdrawn or moved to other depots than Bradford by 1932, and as the bus is in WYRCC livery it will be post 1929. This puts the date of the photo between 1929 and 1932. It is strange that such an old photo (at least 15 years) should have been used in a 1945 Xmas card where editing of the card was done to show the 1945 owner of the shop.\n\nThe Harrogate Road Car Company was formed in 1906. In 1924, the company was absorbed into the Tilling & British Automobile Traction group, and its name changed to Harrogate & District Road Car Company. Its name was changed to West Yorkshire Road Car Company in 1927.\n\nAdverts\n\nPlayer's Navy Cut Cigarettes\n\nSmoke Robin Cigarettes\n\nSt Bruno Flake\n\nBlack Cat Cigarettes\n\nStephens Inks thermometer\n\nCadbury's Chocolate's Made At Bournville\n\nCirculatory Library\n\nRowntrees Chocolates - Pastilles\n\nRowntrees Chocolates - Clear Gums\n\nTit-Bits\n\nGirl Held Prisoner by Dope Gang\n\nSpratts Puppy Biscuits\n\nPlayers Navy Cut\n\nSmoke Robin Cigsarettes\n\nSt Bruno Flake\n\nBlack Cat Cigarettes\n\nStephens Inks Thermometer\n\nCadbury's Chocolates Made In Bournville\n\nSpratts Puppy Biscuits\n\nThese images are of enamel signs similar to the ones visible in the photo.\n\nThe right of the photo show how the camera was lined up and trying to get the same view now means having to get close to the ground, perhaps Hallcliffe was raised when the 1960s development took place. The wrought iron supports small balconies on the Baildon Club. The sign next to this \"BAILDON PA rish churh\" \"St John ....\"\n\nTowngate from Westgate\n\nThis photo is looking down Westgate to Towngate. Based on the information about the bus and the adverts it is reasonable to think this was taken in July 1950. The adverts on J. Hodgson, Tobacconist, on the left, in this one are much clearer and cleaner than some of the other photos. I have not been able to find a photo of a Player's Navy Cut advert with the same colouring.\n\nThe sign opposite that is propped against the wall says \"Petrol ??????? Angel Hotel\" and above it is a banner for Esso. I am sure the pump sign next to the banner has samples to be searched for on the internet.\n\nThe bus is a Bristol JO5G reg BWT 793 with No. 998. It is on the 58 service to Bradford. This bus was in service with West Yorkshire Road Car Company as 998 in 1937. Out of service Aug 1951 and scrapped May 1954.[3]\n\nIn the shop window on the right is a recognisable Batchelor's ad.\n\nAbove the door of the shop is quite a large light fitting and to the right of that an Osira Lamps and GEC Equipment box. A similar box is still on the left hand side of the Liberal Club building (Pickles) (Photo). A rather hefty light fitting is on the right of the Liberal Club.\n\nAdverts\n\nOn the side of the newsagents\n\nPlayer's Navy Cut Cigarettes\n\nSmoke Robin Cigarettes\n\nSt Bruno Flake\n\nState Express 555 cigarettes\n\nWoman\n\nThat Enchantress is readable. This is a book by Doris Leslie published 1950. The cover of Woman for July 29 1950 shows \"Beginning That Enchantress. Doris Leslie's romantic and intriguing new novel\".\n\nJohn Bull\n\n1000 days in the Antartic is visible. The John Bull magazine did a multi-part \"Antarctic Adventure\" with the 1st part being printed in their July 22 1950 edition.\n\nHome Chat\n\nWeldons Best Knitting Leaflets - Weldons produced knitting patterns in the 1940s and '50s.\n\nPopular Gardening\n\nWoman's Own\n\nSunny Stories\n\nSunny Stories was a children's magazine edited and written by Enid Blyton.\n\nJosie, Click & Bun were a doll, a clockwork mouse, and a bunny in stories by Enid Blyton.\n\nSilver Star\n\nOn the Angel Hotel\n\nTetley's Ales\n\nPlayers Navy Cut\n\nSmoke Robin Cigarettes\n\nSt Bruno Flake\n\nBus details\n\nWoman. July 29 1950\n\nJohn Bull. July 22 1950\n\nOsira/GEC fittings. Liberal Club, Towngate Rooms.\n\nTop of Browgate\n\nThe clothes worn in this photo suggest it was taken very early, 1900-1910. The women have long skirts but the children have shorter length clothes. Some of the signs may allow us to put the earliest date to the photo.\n\nBrooke,Bond's tea started to be sold wholesale in 1892.\n\nThe Robin Starch sign has The New across the middle of it unlike the red example. Further searching has found a blue Robin Starch advertising sign that has \"The new\" across it. The curvature of \"Robin\" and the shape of the bird a very similar to the blue sign. Robin Starch was introduced in 1890.[4]\n\nA Venus Soap sign has been for sale and the details said it was from 1910.[5]\n\nA Thomson's Dye sign has been for sale and the details said it was from the 1920s.[6]\n\nA reasonable estimate for this photo's date seems to be between 1900 and 1920.\n\nReading other publications that feature this photo mention that John Wesley House (9 Browgate) is shown as Rhodes grocers shop. The letters \"ODES\" of Rhodes can be seen on the sign above the door.\n\nSaville's sweet store is advertising Tordoff's and Brooke Bond's teas, Robin Starch and Globe Metal Polish.\n\nBeyond is Bentley's beneath the Mechanics Institute advertising agencies for Rockcliffe Laundry and a Perth Dye works. The Wesleyan Chapel advertises T H Mallinson and J H Cook as the preachers for next Sunday.\n\nBrooke,Bond's Tea sign.\n\nMatchless Soap\n\nThe New Robin Starch\n\nRobin Starch\n\nVenus soap\n\nA sample of the Dye Works sign\n\nTowngate with FWX 828\n\nThis shows a Bristol K6B bus that entered service with West Yorkshire Road Car Company in June 1948 and went out of service with them on Sept 1963. The bus was scrapped in 1968.[7]\n\nThe car just to the right of the Potted Meat Stick looks like an Austin A40 Devon that were made between 1947 and 1952.[8]\n\nThe building that for many years had been J W Noble is now shown as A Mitchell. Florist & Nurseryman\n\nWe still have Player's Navy Cut and St Bruno Flake ads on the wall but the periodical ads that are lower down have changed. John Bull is still there. The lower right ad still seems to have the same format which reminds me of wrestling or boxing match ads but might be announcing the forthcoming preachers for church/chapel? On the corner of the building is what looks like a Beech Nut dispenser with a 1d price."
