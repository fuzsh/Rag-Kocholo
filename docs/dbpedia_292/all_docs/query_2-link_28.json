        "text": "As the last theme for Explore Your Archives Week is ‘Watch This Space’, it seemed a great opportunity to share a project that I have been working on at WYAS Leeds with our Photopress (Leeds) collection (WYL5000).\n\nPhotopress Leeds Ltd was a commercial photographer’s company run by James ‘Jimmie’ Waite, a professional photographer from Leeds. On leaving Leeds Modern School in 1928, Jimmie didn’t have a very clear idea what he wanted to do. He was introduced to Bob Ledbetter, an older professional photographer who ran a wedding business alongside a press agency. Bob took Jimmie on as a trainee so he was able to gain experience in a wide range of photography and Jimmie also took a course in Professional and Pure Photography at Leeds College of Technology from 1935 to 1936. In around 1938, Jimmie was then made a partner in Bob’s firm. During the War, Jimmie’s photography skills were recognised and he went to the Royal Naval Photographic School at Portsmouth in 1941, and then to the Fleet Air Arm Photographic School at Ford where he gained more expertise, particularly in aerial photography.\n\nAfter the War, Jimmie parted ways with Bob Ledbetter and began his own business. Photopress was based at 26 East Parade from 1949 until 1960 when they moved to 16 New Station Street. The new building was well-situated next door to national newspaper offices, the Daily Mail, Daily Mirror and Sunday Express, and opposite the News of the World, and also close to Leeds Train Station.\n\nMost of the work done by Photopress was commercial and jobs came from friends and acquaintances. In the 1950s and early 1960s, Jimmie associated with many press photographers who worked in Leeds and nearly all the major national newspapers had a locally-based photographer and journalist. The picture editor of the Yorkshire Evening News would often give work to Jimmie in an emergency or when he needed a second photographer at football matches. Jimmie enjoyed press-work the most as a sports fanatic as he was able to capture many football, rugby and cricket matches.\n\nWork also came from local businesses to record their openings, new products, window displays, exhibitions, properties and social events. Some of their biggest employers were the petrol companies Regent Oil Co. (later Texaco) and National Benzole (later Shell-Mex and BP). They employed Photopress to photograph sites for prospective petrol stations in the 1950s when a major programme of expansion was underway, and followed this up with pictures of the garages that they had purchased or built on the sites. Other areas of employment include the universities, schools, politicians and celebrities, the courts and Leeds television companies ABC, Yorkshire Television and the BBC. Jimmie also photographed many weddings and private parties, and provided a passport photograph service.\n\nThe surviving records of Photopress are around 150,000 film and glass plate negatives from the 1950s, ‘60s and ‘70s. Unfortunately when Photopress moved from the fourth floor of 26 East Parade, they abandoned over 4,000 glass plate negatives as they were thought too heavy to be worth moving. This means that many that have survived date from March 1958 onwards, although there are some exceptions. Several index volumes in the collection are the keys to identifying the negatives. In a commercial photography business, negatives should be traceable and reusable as clients could return to ask for another print of a wedding photograph or a newspaper picture editor might want a specific picture for example.\n\nI have recently been working to transcribe and digitise one of the main indexes for the photographs to make the entries easier to search and identify. The below picture shows an original index page on the left and on the right is the Microsoft Excel version that I have been working on. The index is arranged in columns by date, location, description and box number. Once this is complete, the next stage will be to research some of the photographs to add further details and begin to digitise the negatives, transforming them into photographs and one day making them available online.\n\nThe images below give and idea of the process of digitisation, from finding the negatives in a folder or bundle, photographing them on the light box, to then inverting the image in Adobe Photoshop and cropping to the original photo size. I have experimented with the best way to digitise the negatives, first trying them on a scanbed, but the light box paired with a good smartphone or camera produces the best quality pictures. The images pictured show Whisky and Kanoble, two chimps from Billy Smart’s Circus in Leeds trying on their ‘beatle’ wigs at Ricardi’s Hairdressing Salon in December 1963.\n\nPhotopress was active during a period when the population of the City of Leeds grew from 480,000 to 748,000 and the company recorded some important changes and events in the city’s history. It is an intriguing insight into the work of a commercial photography business in the post-war era and I am excited to explore further and bring the images back to life. So watch this space for more updates on the project’s progress!
