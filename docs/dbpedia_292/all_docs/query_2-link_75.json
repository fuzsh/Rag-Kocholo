ONLINE BIDDING\n\nClarke & Simpson Auctions Ltd. offer an online bidding service via the-saleroom.com, bidspotter.co.uk and ibidder.com for those wishing to bid but cannot attend the sale.\n\nIn completing the bidder registration on the-saleroom.com, bidspotter.co.uk or ibidder.com and providing your payment card details and, unless alternative arrangements are agreed with Clarke & Simpson Auctions Ltd.:\n\n1. authorise Clarke & Simpson Auctions Ltd., if they so wish, to charge the payment card given in part or full payment, including all fees, for items successfully purchased in the auction via the-saleroom.com, bidspotter.co.uk or ibidder.com, and\n\n2. confirm that you are authorised to provide these payment card details to Clarke & Simpson Auctions Ltd. through the-saleroom.com, bidspotter.co.uk or ibidder.com and agree that Clarke & Simpson Auctions Ltd. are entitled to ship the goods to the card holder name and card holder address provided in fulfilment of the sale.\n\nPlease note that any lots purchased through any of the online platforms will be subject to an additional internet surcharge: Monday, Fine Art, Art Deco and Rural Bygones being 5% of the hammer price plus VAT (3% through www.clarkeandsimpson.co.uk).

We will expect payment of the balance owing by BACS on the following day, any payment not met within five working days will result in the forfeiture of the deposit paid.\n\n16. AT FAULT (A.F.) LOTS\n\nCertain lots are catalogued at fault (A.F.), damaged, restored etc., however the absence of any such notice does not imply that the piece is free from defects, nor does it indicate that other defects are not also present. Mention is not made of breakage, cracks, chips or any damage which can be noted by careful inspection, therefore those wishing to bid MUST, in all cases, be responsible for determining the condition of the lots themselves, either in person or by request of condition reports or additional detailed photographs.\n\n17. ESTIMATES\n\nPresale estimates are intended only as a guide for those wishing to bid, are given in good faith and subject to revision.\n\n18. CONDITION REPORTS\n\nClarke and Simpson are unable to guarantee that requests for Condition Reports/images received will be responded to. Clarke and Simpson are happy to give a Condition Report where possible on the physical condition of goods, this will be provided on behalf of the vendor on the understanding that Clarke and Simpson are not entering into a contract with you in respect of the Condition Report and accordingly does not assume responsibility to you in respect of it. All lots are available for your own inspection or for inspection by an expert instructed by you, therefore these Condition Reports are for guidance only and all lots are sold “as found”. Condition Reports do not form part of a contract.\n\n19. COMMISSION BIDS\n\nThe auctioneers will be pleased to execute bids for those unable to attend the sale. Lots will be purchased at the lowest bid the room bidding, internet bidding or any reserves will allow. In the event of identical bids, the earliest bid received will take precedence. There must always be a maximum limit indicated. Buy or unlimited bids will not be accepted. Commission bids placed by telephone are accepted at the client’s risk. We urge our clients to place such bids before the start of the sale. All such commissions are left entirely at the client’s risk.\n\n20. VALUE ADDED TAX\n\nThe symbol * or V after any lot number or description indicates that Value Added Tax is payable by the buyer on the hammer price.\n\n21. AUCTIONEERS MARGIN SCHEME\n\nThe Auctioneers Margin Scheme allows auctioneers to sell items without VAT on the hammer price. Under the margin scheme an amount equivalent to VAT at the current rate is added to the buyer’s premium. This amount cannot be refunded. The VAT element will not be shown separately on the buyer’s invoice. This VAT is not recoverable as Input Tax. We do not allow buyers to opt out of the margin scheme.\n\n22. ATTRIBUTION OF PICTURES AND DRAWINGS\n\nEvery effort is made to ensure the accuracy of any statements as to authorship, attribution, origin, date, age, provenance and condition of any lot whether or not such statement forms part of the description of any such lot. Whether any such statement is made orally or in the catalogue it is an expression of opinion and not to be taken as being or implying any warranties or representations of facts by the auctioneers. Each buyer by making a bid for a lot acknowledges that he has satisfied himself fully as to the attribution and condition of the lot. The following is for guidance only and does not form part of a contract.\n\nA. The forename (s) (or full stops where not known) and surname of an artist indicates in our opinion a work by the artist.\n\nB. The initials of the forename (s) and the surname of the artist indicates in our opinion a work of the period of the artist which may be wholly or in part his work.\n\nC. The surname of the artist indicates in our opinion a work of the school or by one of the followers of the artist or in his style and of uncertain date.\n\nD. Signed, Dated, Inscribed indicated in our opinion work signed/dated/inscribed by the artist.\n\nE. Bears signature indicates in our opinion that this is not the signature of the artist.\n\nF. Attributed to may be used to denote a traditional attribution based on style.\n\nG. Manner of indicates in our opinion a work executed in the artist/craftman’s style but of a later date.\n\nH. After indicates in our opinion a copy (of any date) of work of an artist or craftsman.\n\nThe addition of a question mark after any of the cataloguing terms above indicates an element of doubt.\n\n23. DROIT DE SUITE ROYALTY CHARGES\n\nAll United Kingdom Art Market professionals (which includes auctioneers) are required to collect a royalty payment for all qualifying Works of Art. This applies to living artists and those who have died in the last 70 years. This payment is calculated on qualifying Works of Art which are sold for a hammer price more than the UK sterling equivalent of €1,000 (the UK sterling equivalent will fluctuate in line with prevailing interest rates calculated by the Artist’s Resale Right Service Hub, based on the European Central Bank reference rate published at 2.15pm on the day of the sale, and can be found on www.dacs.org.uk).\n\nAll items in this catalogue that are marked “ü” are potentially qualifying items, and the royalty charge will apply if the hammer price is more than UK sterling equivalent of €1,000. The royalty charge will be added to purchase invoices and must be paid before items can be cleared. All royalty charges are paid to the design and Artists Copyright Society (DACS) by the auctioneers and no handling costs or additional fees with respect to these charges will be retained by the auctioneer. This charge may also be applicable to lots not marked “ü” and buyers must satisfy themselves.\n\nThe royalty charge for qualifying items which achieve a hammer price of more than the UK sterling equivalent of €1,000, but less than the UK sterling equivalent of €50,000 is 4%. For qualifying items that sell for more than the UK equivalent of €50,000 a sliding scale of royalty charges will apply. For a complete list of the royalty charges and threshold levels please refer to www.dacs.org.uk. There is no VAT payable on this royalty charge.\n\n24. ENDANGERED SPECIES\n\nLots sold at auction may include endangered or other species of wildlife and plant life, for example, tortoiseshell, crocodile skin, whale bone, ebony or rosewood. Some countries restrict or prohibit import or export of objects containing these materials or require a licence/permit for their movement (e.g. a CITES Licence). Prior to bidding on a lot which may include these or similar materials, buyers must familiarise themselves with the relevant laws and regulations regarding their movement.\n\n25. JEWELLERY\n\nGemstones are often treated to enhance colour and improve appearance. They may be heated or treated by oil or resin to intensify the colour and transparency. Other techniques like dying, irradiation, coating and impregnation can also be used. Buyers must be aware that unless the catalogue specifically states otherwise then the stone is natural, buyers must assume that any treatment may not be permanent, and that special care may be needed in the future.\n\n26. EXPORT\n\nAny lot purchased at auction may be subject to export restrictions and may require a licence for export out of the United Kingdom. The buyer is responsible for obtaining any licences that may be required (including any licence that may be required for import into the destination country) – any denial of such a licence will not be grounds for the buyer to cancel the purchase.\n\n27. THIRD PARTY LIABILITY\n\nAll members of the public on Clarke and Simpson Auctions Ltd. premises are there at their own risk and must note the layout of the buildings and site and the appropriate security arrangements. Accordingly, neither the Auctioneer nor its employees or agents shall incur liability for death or personal injury (except as required by law) or similarly for the safety or persons visiting the premises.\n\n28. CONSIGNMENT\n\nAll vendors will have received a copy of Clarke & Simpson Auctions Terms regarding consignment of lots for sale and these Terms and Conditions should be read in accordance with this consignment documentation."
