National Benzole – Higher Smileage Advert 1957 Here we have a lovely restored National Benzole Magazine Advertisement from August 1957. Entitled “For higher smileage go National Benzole”. The majority of these images have benefitted from total restoration. Some have been re-typeset. Some have original photographs inserted, if available. Some have logos and badges added. Any badge, if photographed, is from my personal library. Any logo will have been re-drawn by me in Photoshop or Corel Painter. Some of these are totally original recovered from agency “mock-ups”. Therefore these should be viewed as pieces of artwork, rather than company history. Image size A3 **Digital Download Only No Physical Product will be dispatched.
