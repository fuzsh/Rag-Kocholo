        "text": "HRH The Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathern\n\nTRH The Duke and Duchess of Connaught and Strathern with their children (from left to right) Patricia, Arthur and Margaret after the Coronation of HM King George V in 1911. Alongside them is the then Crown Prince Gustav Adolf of Sweden (later HM King Gustaf VI Adolf) Margaret's husband. Photoghrapher unknown. Source: www.europeanroyalhistory.wordpress.com\n\nWe skip HRH The Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll as she was the only child of Victoria and Albert who did not have children. We turn to HRH The Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathern instead.\n\nDespite being the least troublesome if not favourite of her children, Queen Victoria did not at first approve of Arthur's choice of bride in Princess Louise Margaret (Luise Margarete) of Prussia. However, they had a happy marriage and produced a major sub-dynasty of three children - Margaret, Arthur and Patricia. This was helped by the fact that Arthur's elder brother, Alfred, had moved to Coburg as the reigning Duke and whose son, also Alfred, died young, as did Arthur's younger brother, Leopold. When King George V came to the Throne in 1910 there were no other major adult members of the British Royal Family than the two Connaught Arthurs who acted as Aides and Counsellors of State alongside Arthur junior's wife/cousin, Alexandra of Fife, and her sister Maud. (The likes of the Athlones, etc would come to help out later.)\n\nThrough their elder daughter, amongst Arthur and Louise Margaret's descendants are the present-day Queen of Denmark and the King of Sweden. Although Arthur junior passed away before his father, he did himself father a son who became the 2nd Duke of Connaught (covered in the previous Blog). But the Dukedom became extinct and his wife's Dukedom of Fife passed to her sister Maud's descendants. Their other daughter, Patricia, is famous, amongst other things, for renouncing her title on marriage.\n\nMargaret\n\nPrincess Margaret of Connaught (Margaret Victoria Charlotte Augusta Norah, 15 January 1882 – 1 May 1920).\n\nThe Connaughts were a widely travelled family and both Margaret and Patricia were expected to marry into a foreign royal family, if not become Queens. After a failed visit to Portugal, the family travelled on to Egypt where they met the then Prince Gustav Adolf of Sweden who is believed to have been earmarked as a husband for Patricia. However, he and Margaret fell in love at first sight and they were married at St George's Chapel, Windsor within 6 months on 15th June 1905. One of Margaret's wedding presents was the Connaught tiara, which remains in the Swedish royal jewellery collection today and is still regularly worn.\n\nAs Crown Princess from 1907, Margaret was a quick learner and immersed herself in her new country. She was interested in the Arts, sport and gardening, and introduced a more relaxed attitude to the stiff Swedish court which helped her husband's and the country's reforms and meant she spent more direct time with her children.\n\nMargaret and Gustav's children included Ingrid who would marry Frederick of Denmark and go on to be Queen there and Bertil who would act as adviser and substitute father to the young Carl Gustav (the present King of Sweden) whose father, Margaret and Gustav's eldest son, also Gustav Adolf, died in a plane crash in 1947. Their youngest son, Carl Johann, would become the last surviving great-grandchild of Queen Victoria.\n\nMargaret herself had died early, on her father's 70th birthday, 1st May 1920, due to complications following an operation when she was 8 months pregnant with her sixth child. Gustav Adolf went on to marry Margaret's second cousin Lady Louise Mountbatten, born a Princess of Battenberg. It would be Louise who would go on to become Queen of Sweden when her husband succeeded to the Throne, but she would have to wait until 1950. Margaret would then have been 68 years old if she had lived.\n\nIn 1905 Margaret was assigned a five-pointed Label based on her Father's. Unusually, in fact uniquely, she added a green Shamrock to each of her extra two Points between the outer Fleurs-de-Lys and the central St. George's Cross. It may simply be that Connaught (nowadays spelled Connacht) is a province of Ireland.\n\nAs Crown Princess of Sweden and Duchess of Scania, Margaret placed the Shield of her personal grant of Arms with her Label as an Inescutcheon on top of the Arms of her Husband rather than the plain, generic United Kingdom Arms. Equally unusual, this Inescutcheon is shown as a Shield rather than an Oval which, for instance, the present Queen of Sweden, Silvia, uses. Queen Louise would also use a Shield-shaped Inescutcheon.\n\nRiddarholm Church near Stockholm, traditional burial church of the Swedish Royal Family. Stall plates of the Order of the Seraphim are placed here after a holder's death. Margaret's can be seen on the right. Instead of being encircled by the Order, her Shield is encircled by daisies as her nickname was Daisy. Source: Wikipedia/Zeke530.\n\nArthur\n\nPrince Arthur of Connaught KG KT GCMG GCVO GCStJ CB PC (Arthur Frederick Patrick Albert, 13 January 1883 – 12 September 1938). The impressive array of initials after his name belies Arthur and his Father's importance to the British Royal Family as the only senior adult males resident in the United Kingdom when King George V came to the Throne.\n\nYoung Arthur was apparently the first British royal prince to be educated at Eton College. He went on to study at Sandhurst from where he saw active service during the Second Boer War with the 7th Hussars. During the First World War, he served as aide-de-camp to successive commanders of the British Expeditionary Force in France and Belgium. He rose to the rank of Colonel and, in 1922, was made an honorary Major General.\n\nIn 1913 he married his cousin, HH Princess Alexandra, Duchess of Fife in her own right. She was a Granddaughter of HM King Edward VII, the eldest Daughter of HRH Louise, Princess Royal. Together they had the one child, Alastair, whose anomalous if not rather tragic life was covered in a previous Blog.\n\nPrince Arthur died of stomach cancer at age 55. His Father would outlive him by four years and Alastair would survive another year. With that, the Dukedom of Coannaught and Strathern would become extinct.\n\nArthur's Label was assigned to him in 1904 and had the addition of a St. George's Cross on each of the outer Points to his Father's Label.\n\nPatricia"
