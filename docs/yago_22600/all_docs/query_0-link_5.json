        "text": "On 15th June 1905, Princess Margaret of Connaught, daughter of Prince Arthur and granddaughter of Queen Victoria, married Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden at St George’s Chapel, Windsor.\n\nUpon reaching their teenage years Margaret and her sister, Patricia, were considered two of the most beautiful, and therefore most eligible, women in Europe. At the beginning of 1905, the Connaught family were staying in Cairo when they met Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden. While he had originally been intended for Patricia, the Prince got along better with Margaret. Before the visit had even ended, he proposed to the princess at a dinner at the British Consulate in Egypt on 25th February.\n\nTheir wedding took place just four months later in 15th June at Steph George’s Chapel. Margaret was attended by four bridesmaids: Princess Patricia, Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg, Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and Princess Mary of Wales.\n\nMargaret wore a white satin dress, which had been made in France and trimmed with Orange Blossom and Myrtle. Her wedding veil was also white and had been a gift from the ladies of Ireland.\n\nFollowing the ceremony, the wedding party returned to Windsor castle, where Gustaf’s parents hosted a Luncheon. As was tradition, the couple left the celebrations early to begin their honeymoon. They spent their first night as a married Couple at Saighton Grange in Cheshire, before heading to Adare Manor in County Limerick, Ireland.\n\nWhen they returned to Sweden Margaret and Gustaf made their home at Sofiero Palace, which had been given to them as a wedding gift from the Princes’s grandfather, King Oscar II.\n\nThe two had a happy marriage from the get-go and were popular amongst the Swedish people. However, their marriage was tragically cut short when Margaret died of sepsis in May 1920, while she was pregnant with their sixth child.\n\nFollowing her death, her wedding veil was placed over her coffin. In 1935, it was worn by Margaret’s daughter, Ingrid, for her wedding to King Frederik IX of Denmark. Since then, it has been worn by each of her female descendants.\n\n©️Queen.Victoria.Roses 2024\n\nI hope you have enjoyed today’s blog.
