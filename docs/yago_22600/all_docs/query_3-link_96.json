        "text": "I also would like to see pictures from the funerals of TRH Prince Gustaf Adolf and Princess Sibila (parents of HM King Carl XVI Gustaf) and of TM King Gustaf V Adolf (great-grandfather of HM King Carl XVI Gustaf) and HM Queen Louisa (second wife of HM King Gustaf VI Adolf).\n\nIf there are not pictures, I would like to see the royals who were there\n\nIt's almost two years since the last post in this thread, but here you go!\n\nThis is probably the last picture taken of our king Gustav VI Adolf. He was taken to the hospital, but he was almost 91 years old, and he soon passed away.\n\nhttp://img516.imageshack.us/img516/6267/sistabildeniq8.jpg\n\nThis is a picture from the funeral. Many of his children and grandchildren are seen in this picture.\n\nhttp://img300.imageshack.us/img300/8819/gustavviadolfsbegravningbm6.jpg\n\ni know its been long since some one posted on this thread but i found some fotage of the funeral cortege of the late King's funeral, in an documentary about Queen Margrethe of Denmark\n\nSÃ¸g i Bonanza - dr.dk/Bonanza\n\nskip to 32:52 for the footage of the funeral\n\nI've just started watching the video - and am blown away at how much Frederick looks like her! Thanks for posting this - very interesting.\n\nI assume Carl Gustav will have a similar service & cortege when the time comes. Has there been any news in the past that would describe how the process would be, especially now there would be a queen regnant that would follow him? The media have done stories of the process for Elizabeth II's passing.\n\nI assume Carl Gustav will have a similar service & cortege when the time comes.

My guess is that the arrangements would be very similar, with a procession from the Palace to Storkyrkan and then to the royal cemetary at Haga."
