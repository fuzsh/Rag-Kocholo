        "text": "\"The Marriage of the Duke of Connaught, 13th March 1879,\" oil on canvas by Sydney Prior Hall. Royal Collection Trust.\n\nOn March 13, 1879, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, married Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia. The engagement was initially received with hesitation by no other than Queen Victoria herself. She was not satisfied with Louise Margaret. She thought she was plain and boring with her broken teeth. Worst, she disapproved of the unhappy marriage and separation of Louise Margaret’s parents. It was clear that Victoria did not want her son to be associated with any scandal that might happen.\n\nTheir marriage, nevertheless, pushed through. The lavish ceremony which took place at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle on March 13, 1879, was well-attended by members of the British, Prussian and other European royal families.\n\nAll the mourning rituals for Princess Alice, who died in December 1878, were set aside on the wedding day, except for Queen Victoria and her ladies-in-waiting who wore black for the occasion. The town of Windsor, already on festive mood, was decorated for the day and illuminated at night.\n\nThe bride, Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia.

Inside Windsor castle, the grand staircase and state entrance of were decorated \"with flowers, palms, ferns and shrubs.” The queen's private apartments were adorned with flowers.\n\nFood flooded on the night before the wedding and during the wedding breakfast, a gathering of royalty feasting upon \"a gorgeous spectacle,” with \"magnificent buffet\" on the table and food was served on gold plate.\n\nNoticeably missing during the wedding was Prince Leopold, Queen Victoria's youngest son, who was ill at Darmstadt and could not travel to Windsor. In his stead, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, stood in as the groom's second supporter.\n\nThe couple received expensive gifts and Queen Victoria's gifts \"consisted of a magnificent diamond tiara, the brilliants hanging down in sparkling peaks from a central wreath of brilliants of pure.\" The Prince and Princess of Wales, meanwhile, gave a \"ring set with the stone known as cat's eye.\" Princess Louise Margaret, on the other hand, received \"costly and tasteful presents.\" From the Prussian Society of Matrons and Maidens she received \"a large basket in gold bronze, lined with purple velvet and supported by three golden claws upon a massive metal frame.\""
