        "text": "(1882–1973). Gustav VI Adolf, who was king of Sweden from 1950 to 1973, was the last Swedish monarch to hold real political power after constitutional reforms were initiated in 1971.\n\nGustav was born on November 11, 1882, in Stockholm, Sweden. The son of the future king Gustav V and Victoria of Baden, Gustav entered the army in 1902 and by 1932 had risen to the rank of general. His lifelong interest in archaeology began during his studies at the University of Uppsala (Sweden), and throughout the 1920s he participated in archaeological expeditions in Greece, Italy, and Cyprus. He also excavated and wrote papers on ancient Swedish monuments and was considered an authority on Chinese ceramics, having owned one of the world’s largest private collections of Asian pottery.\n\nThrough his first marriage, to Princess Margaret of Connaught, who died in 1920, Gustav had five children, the eldest of whom, Gustav Adolf, duke of Västerbotten, became his heir. In 1923 Gustav married Lady Louise Mountbatten, and in October 1950 he succeeded to the throne. His grandson Carl Gustaf, the son of Gustav Adolf, became crown prince after his father’s death in 1947."
