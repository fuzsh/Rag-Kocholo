Are you a fan of hockey? Swimming? Both? If you're a fan of both, then Octopush, or Underwater Hockey, is a sport you should definitely check out. The name Octopush is mainly used in the UK, while Underwater Hockey is used in most other countries. Underwater Hockey is a sport where, as the name suggests, you play under the water. It originates in England, and was made by Alan Blake as a way to keep scuba divers fit.

In Octopush, the team is comprised of six people, all playing at the bottom of a pool. The objective is to move a lead puck with a hand held pusher along the bottom of the pool. A team scores by flicking the puck into the opposing team's goal.

In order to play, each participant uses fins, a mask and snorkel, and a 'pusher' or stick. In addition, they wear other safety equipment such a mouth guard, glove, and water polo cap. These things are required to compete in competitions. On a team, there can ten people, but only six are allowed in the water at one time. Players are substituted throughout the game.

Another thing that makes Octopush unique compared to the majority of sports is that it actually requires the players to hold their breath while playing. Players must dive underwater to play. You might think that players would need to be able to hold their breath for extended periods of time, but according to the Imperial College Underwater Club, it's the ability to judge when dive that's most important. In a few well-timed seconds, players can tackle an opponent and pass the puck before returning to the surface.

While many people may not have heard of this sport before, it's actually one that has been around since the 1950s. Octopush is actually a global sport, and while not as popular as soccer or basketball, it's definitely a sport worth watching or even participating in.
