        "text": "Have you ever wondered how on earth you would play hockey underwater? I guess you might not even have heard of it!\n\nHello, my name is Sunny and I play underwater hockey at our local club, the Townsville Tiger Sharks.\n\nAs a well-trained swimmer, underwater hockey caught my attention as it combines a variety of skills into one sport: swimming, breath hold, sprinting, recovery, puck handling, strategy and tactics, team play and the ability to ‘toughen up’! As an underwater hockey player, you engage in a fit and healthy lifestyle, gain a new family, train your social and physical skills and enrich the community with a very unusual, but entertaining sports opportunity. Hence, I was hooked from the beginning and my passion is increasing ever since.\n\nNow I am highly motivated to participate in the Nationals Championship in January 2023 in Bunbury and potentially the World Championship in July 2023 at the Gold Coast, Australia, where well established underwater hockey teams from South Africa, New Zealand, Great Britain or France will encounter the world best underwater hockey players. There will be a series of national camps to prepare for these amazing events with the first one starting in September in Hobart. Training camps have expenses of at least 500 dollars per camp, since those entail traveling and accommodation costs, coaching lessons, pool and lane hire fees. The State Titles in October this year in Cairns is a great event to identify areas of improvement and to gain more experience in competing. However, travel and accommodation costs also need to be covered. Professional high-quality equipment can have expenses in the range of 30-200 dollars or more. The donation of 10 dollars will cover the costs for pool entry and two additional private training sessions or one training session with the club at our local pool.\n\nWith your support you will be able to raise more awareness of this particular sports, support local individuals and teams, highly increase the changes of a positive outcome of the World Championship in 2023 and make my dreams come true to take part in this exciting opportunity. I am super grateful to gain your support and more than happy to share this fascinating journey and lot of funny underwater hockey stories.\n\nStill wondering, how on earth you are supposed to play underwater hockey? Check out my video on Facebook to gain an impression and maybe even get hooked yourself ;)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sandra.erdmann.980/videos/5060818537270051"
