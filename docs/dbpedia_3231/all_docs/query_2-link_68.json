        "text": "“ I wasn't hurt that badly. The doctor said all my bleeding was internal. That's where the blood's supposed to be. ”\n\n―Jake Peralta in AC/DC\n\nJacob Jeffrey Sherlock \"Jake\" Peralta (portrayed by Andy Samberg) is the main protagonist of the show, and the only character besides Raymond Holt to appear in every episode. At the start of the series, he was a cocky and immature, but very talented and dedicated NYPD detective stationed in Brooklyn's 99th Precinct. He was often the one coming up with precinct competitions and shenanigans and not taking anything except his cases seriously. He has, however, always cared deeply about his friends and is extremely loyal. Throughout the series, due to his father-son relationship with Holt, and his partnership-turned-relationship with his now wife, Amy, Jake matured and turned into a very respectful and respectable person. In the series finale, he decides to retire from the NYPD and become a stay-at-home dad to his son Mac (born in the season 7 finale, \"Lights Out\") so that Amy can focus on her career.\n\nDescription\n\n“ Jacob Peralta is my best detective. He likes putting away bad guys and he loves solving puzzles. The only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up. ”\n\n―Terry Jeffords to Raymond Holt in the Pilot\n\nPeralta is a detective that has never been one to follow the rules too closely, frequently ignoring departmental guidelines and ignoring instructions from superior officers. Perhaps because he has the best arrest record among his colleagues, he's been enabled - if not indulged - throughout his entire career. That is, until the precinct gets a new commanding officer, Captain Raymond Holt, who reminds this hotshot cop to respect the badge. Jake is/was the most talented detective from the 99th and NYPD, since because of the level of his arrests/cases solved, he was on the 2% of the best detectives from the city.\n\nPersonality\n\nWhen first introduced, Jake is a very competent detective with an incredibly immature, yet charming personality. He often butts heads with authority and teases his partner, and later wife, Amy Santiago. He has trouble expressing his emotions, preferring to crack jokes and deflect with humor, but he usually comes around to talking about how he's feeling. He is extremely intelligent and calculating, yet his wits are most often channeled into coming up with clever wordplay instead of more detail-oriented work. He is also shown as somewhat unorganized and irresponsible, being in severe debt due to poor financial choices. As the show progresses, however, he is shown to be much more responsible.\n\nHe is a very laid-back individual, but he takes his job seriously and likes the arresting-bad-guys part the most. Jake clashes with Captain Holt at first because of the latter's practical, down-to-earth methods against Jake's wisecracking nature. Jake Peralta has abandonment issues, given that his father left him at an extremely young age. This has resulted in him viewing every male authority figure as a father figure, such as him sometimes calling Holt \"Dad\". He is also a big fan of the movie franchise Die Hard, always being excited when he is able or has an opportunity to act out a Die Hard scene during police work.\n\nJake is also very loyal with those he cares about. He once revealed that he hates psychiatrics because when he was a kid he attended one and his parents got an argument about who had the blame and shortly after his father abandoned them, so he feels very guilty believing he's responsible for his parent's separation. He is also kind with his friends often helping them in anything they need, like when he help Charles to negotiate with Eleanor to make her give him his sperm so he could have a child, or when he helps Terry's wife when she is about to go into labor making sure she feels comfortable respecting her decision of not going to the hospital - although when he realizes that the best thing for her is to be seen by an obstetrician, Jake finds a way for Captain Holt to make amends with his ex-boyfriend, an OB, since they didn't end the relationship on the best terms, so that he can see Sharon when she is going into labor, which later Terry and Sharen thank Jake for.\n\nBiography\n\nJake was born sometime between May 21 and June 20, 1981, in New York City. He is an Ashkenazi Jewish American New Yorker, raised by his mother after his dad walked out on them when Jake was only seven years old.\n\nAs a child, Jake was the shortstop on his little league team. His dad was the coach, and after every game would take the team to Sal's Pizza. Halfway through their last season, Roger Peralta left his wife and son.\n\nJake attended the same elementary and high school as Gina Linetti. As children, the two would hang out at Jake's Nana's apartment after school.\n\nIn Halloween, it is revealed that Jake has an Uncle Bob who taught him to shoot chess and backgammon pieces with a BB gun.\n\nWhen he was 13, Jake had a crush on Jenny Gildenhorn. They attended his Bar Mitzvah together, where she broke up with him in favour of Eddie Fung. Since then, Jake has continued to hold onto hope that he and Jenny would reunite. He claims that Jenny dumping him is his worst breakup of all time.\n\nAfter that, he lost his virginity to the daughter of one of his teachers, Mrs Stratton.\n\nRosa Diaz and Jake were classmates in the police academy. They bonded over their hatred of the training drills. Later, as detectives, they made a pact to trust each other fully when one offered to do 1,000 push-ups if proven wrong.\n\nJake has been working at the 99th Precinct for at least 8 years prior to the first season of the show. Before Raymond Holt took over as captain at the Nine-Nine, Jake enjoyed that Captain McGintley would allow him to get away with anything while on the job. He took advantage of McGintley's lax attitude and would participate in games with his coworkers, including The Jimmy Jab Games.\n\nPhysical Appearance\n\nJake has curly dark brown hair (mostly tamed), brown eyes, and what he refers to as a \"Jewish nose.\" (note that the author of this factoid is Jewish and very aware of the stereotypes and the affect they have, however, Jake's nose is used as a punchline multiple times by Jake himself throughout the show so it felt like an important addition to make.)\n\nHe is often seen wearing a button-down plaid shirt, a blue or red unzipped hoodie, jeans and at times, a stylish, black leather jacket. At Captain Holt's request, Jake has taken to sometimes wearing a tie. He used to wear a watch on his left wrist in the earlier episodes, his police badge on a chain around his neck and starting from the Season 5 Finale, a wedding ring on his left finger.\n\nRelationships\n\nAmy Santiago\n\nSee Jake-Amy Relationship\n\n“ I know that when things are hard, I talk them through with Amy. And just being with her, looking into her eyes, everything that seemed so complicated becomes simple. And then... I just know. ”\n\n―Jake to Holt in Renewal\n\nJake and Amy start the series as partners with adjacent desks in the bullpen at the 99th precinct. Although they behaved as rivals, always trying to one-up each other with bets, competitions, and teasing, they clearly shared mutual respect and a friendship. They were known for having one of the best partnerships in the precinct. After two seasons of slow-burn, with multiple confessions of romantic feelings, they finally kiss in the Season 2 finale, \"Johnny and Dora.\"\n\nIn the first episode of Season 3, titled \"New Captain,\" they go on their first real date and by the end of the episode they decide to start a relationship. In the winter finale of Season 4, Jake agrees to move into Amy's apartment. In the Season 5episode \"HalloVeen,\" Jake proposes to Amy in the evidence locker room (where they shared their first real kiss) and she accepts.

Minutes later, her father shows up and tells her that they were taken by surprise and it will take some time for them to \"get use\" to the fact that Rosa is bisexual and that is better that their game-nights get \"suspended\". At the end of the day, Jake get to Rosa's apartment with all the squad for game-night, saying that they will be there every week.\n\nWhen Jake prepares his \"perfect goodbye\" from the Nine-Nine and the NYPD, his gift for Rosa is a board game so she can know that even though they are all going in different ways, they will always have \"game-night\", no matter what.\n\nDoug Judy\n\nSee Jake-Doug Relationship\n\nThe first time Jake and Judy met was when Judy asked to have a talk with Peralta.
