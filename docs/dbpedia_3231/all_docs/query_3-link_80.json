        "text": "The Town of Okotoks is proud to announce Viking Rentals Centre as the new naming rights sponsor for its premier ice arena and events centre, formerly Centennial Arenas and Foothills Centennial Centre. This 10-year partnership reflects Viking Rentals’ commitment to supporting community recreation and entertainment and will unify the arenas and event centre under a single, cohesive identity, enhancing the facility's recognition and accessibility.\n\n“We are thrilled to partner with Viking Rentals and bring their name to our outstanding sports and event centre,” said Christa Michailuck, Okotoks Parks & Recreation Director. “This sponsorship will not only provide significant support for the ongoing operations and enhancements of our facilities but also foster a stronger sense of community pride and engagement.”\n\nThe state-of-the-art facility includes two NHL-sized ice surfaces, an unboarded leisure ice surface, a walking track, and versatile multi-purpose event space. It proudly serves as the home for the Okotoks Junior A Oilers and provides a top environment for both athletes and community members.\n\n“My family and I are very excited to work with the Town of Okotoks and to sponsor these exceptional venues that serve so many members of our community as well as surrounding areas,” said Lars Pettersen, Owner of Viking Rentals. “We are especially proud that Viking Rentals sponsorship will directly benefit athletes, spectators, and all visitors to the facilities. Sports, particularly hockey, have given me so much in my life, and I have always wanted to give back and help athletes to have the kinds of opportunities that I did. I have always admired people who contribute positively to their community and have been driven to be able to do the same. Together with the Town, I believe we will be able to achieve both goals.”\n\nThe Viking Rentals Centre is set to continue its tradition of excellence in providing a welcoming space for hockey, leisure skating, fitness activities, and a wide range of community events. This sponsorship not only marks a significant investment in the facility, but also a commitment to creating a positive impact on the community.
