        "text": "Australian Mens Team\n\nAfter months of indecision by NZ, we finally got a date and finalised our teams only a month out. I decided to go with just 10 players as those preceding months played havoc with player plans and numbers. We had 2 new caps in the team, and given that I felt it was an interim year, it would be good to see those boys in the furnace of a solid round robin tournament without the usual breaks players get with a 12 man rotation. We arrived in Auckland to some reasonable weather and great accommodation organized by Lucy, the Australian Teams manager. On using the pool for the first time, I felt it was the best pool I had seen anywhere in the world; fast, 4 walls, 25 x15 m, and made for hockey. We had a good mix in the team, with experience, youth, and some solid all-round players. I planned on changing our game plan that we developed in the last Worlds to something I would like to take to the Columbia Worlds next year. We had 3 days as our on-the-spot camp to make some change ups before the comp started on the Tuesday. The schedule was tough with 3 games a day and 2 on the Friday to make a total of 11 games in 3 and a half days of play. That is as much game play as you would expect from a Worlds in 10 days let alone in 3 and a half days. This certainly tested the boys without a rotation and, in the end, may have cost them the chance to finish strongly in what showed to be a very strong comp. New Zealand fielded 3 teams: their national side made up of 12 young fit players, a Barbartions team made up of experienced players who were either too old to be in the first team or too lazy to do the work, and an U23 team who were the next best players behind the first team.\n\nOur first game with NZ initially went well, with us being 3-1 up for most of the game, only to lose it in the final seconds 3-4 after a few guys got kicked out late in the game. Next were the Barbs, which followed a similar script, with us up 4-0 for most of the game then finishing 4-4 at full time. We then went on a scoring spree with the U23’s late in the day.\n\nAfter the first day I was indifferent with the results, as I felt fitness late in those matches may well have determined the final scores. The next day, we were out pointed in the first game 4-0 and NZ deserved the win and the Trans Tasman trophy that went with it. But to the boys credit, they rebounded after that result to beat the Barbars 13-1, with a similar result in the U23’s. At this stage the players felt they where starting to get the change ups in play and the next morning we fought out a 3-3 draw with New Zealand. We then beat the Barbars and the 23’s, to have a good last day. The final question was whether 11 games would take their toll, and after beating the Barbars in a tough 7-6 win in the morning, it was then just up to the last game at 3pm that day.\n\nThe boys fed and slept well proir to the game and after a great start and many chances on the goal tray in the first half, we started to wane and they struck back, getting 2 late goals in that half to be in control. The second half started the same, with some great work to get the puck on to the tray. But with none of those chances being taken, it was then just a matter of time and the flood gates opened and they quickly took the match away from us and won 7/1. The scoreline was not flattering, but I am sure it will spur the team on to do the work and never let fitness get in the way of winning again. The new players saw how they will need to play at the elite level and the other things that they will need to do to make sure that in a tough tournament they will be the last men standing.\n\nLooking ahead, we have 4 Australian players going to Columbia this month to play and to experience the country and facilities for next year’s Worlds. And with the addition of players who were not available for the Trans Tasman, we will have a hungry talented group to pick from to make the ultimate assault on the World title.\n\nArnie Piccoli, Aust. Mens Team Coach"
