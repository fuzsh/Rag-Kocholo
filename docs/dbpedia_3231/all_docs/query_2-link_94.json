        "text": "CSKA stands for Central'nyi Sportivnyi Klub Armii, which means the Central Sport Club of the Army. This club was founded by the Red Army in 1923 and its previous names were OPPV (The Experimental and Show Field of the Vsevobuch [Vsevobuch was the Army program for universal civilian military training]), CDKA (Central Red Army Club), KKA (Red Army Team), CDSA (Central Soviet Army Club) and CSK MO (Central Sport Club of the Ministry of Defence).\n\nWhen the club was taken away from the Vsevobuch and transferred to the Moscow officers' recreation club, it was known as CDKA and CDSA (with the exception of 1941, when it was called KKA and represented the entire Red Army). Then they transferred to ownership to the Ministry of Defense and changed the name to CSK MO, but it was very hard to chant and the fans hated it. Hence another change, to CSKA.\n\nSpartak is the Russian name of Spartacus, the leader of a famous Roman slave uprising, immortalized by a Hollywood movie with Kirk Douglas.\n\nOriginally the team was known as MKS (Moscow Sports Circle) and was founded by young workers from the Krasnaya Presnya area in Moscow. A couple of decades of affiliation and name changes ensued, before the name Spartak was adopted in 1935. The story of Spartacus was popular in the pre-war Soviet Union, as his struggle agains the Roman oppression was very dear to Soviet ideology.\n\nTorpedo means just that, even though the modern Russian name for the underwater weapon is now spelled torpeda. Nobody knows for sure why the automobile-plant team adopted this name. Some say it's what they called a certain car part in those days, some say it's simply supposed to represent the speed, a concept very important in the automobile industry.\n\nDinamo is the Russian spelling of the word \"dynamo\", which is a machine that transferred kinetic energey into electric power. Originally, when it was founded in 1923, the club was supposed to represent the electricians' trade union, but was taken over by the NKVD (the Soviet secret police). The name Dinamo was kept however, either for conspiratory purposes or simply because the new bosses liked it.\n\nDynamo Kiev was founded in 1927, also supposedly as an electricians' team, but was quickly transferred to the police. Later on, the USSR Sporting Society \"Dinamo\" was created, unifying all police teams in the country. This is why there are so many \"Dinamoes\" out there now.\n\nLokomotiv does indeed mean \"locomotive\". The team was founded (and is still owned) by the Ministry of Transportation in 1935. Before that, it was a railroad workers' team in Moscow.\n\nShakhtyor (Shakhtar in Ukrainian) does mean \"coal miner\". Coal mining is a very important industry in Donetsk, Ukraine, where the team plays. Originally the club was called Ugolshchiki (\"coal diggers\"), then Stakhanovets, after Stakhanov, a hero coal miner of the early Soviet times.\n\nChernomorets (there is one team in Russia, from Novorossiysk, and one in Ukraine, from Odessa) means Black Sea Sailor.\n\nShinnik (the team from Yaroslavl) means \"tire maker\". The club used to be owned by the local tire factory.\n\nZenit (St. Petersburg) means \"zenith\". For some reason, this is what they called teams that represented military-industry plants and factories in those days. Zenit was owned by the Leningrad Metalworks Plant (LMZ), which did some military projects. The old affiliation is no longer in place, but the name stuck.\n\nKrylya Sovetov (Samara) means \"The Soviet Wings\". The club used to represent a plant which build airplanes.\n\nAlania (Vladikavkaz) is named after the part of the Russian Federation where it is based. Alania is the local name for the Republic of North Ossetia.\n\nKuban (Krasnodar) is named after the Kuban River, which flows through the region. It's primarily assotiated with the Kuban Cossacks, who have inhabited the valley for a long time.\n\nAmkar (Perm) was founded by a chemical plant in 1995 and its name is composed of two words, ammiac and carbamite, the company's two main products.\n\nRotor (Volgograd) is named after the rotating part of the motor. The club was founded by a tractor factory and was called Traktor and Torpedo in the old days (after the Moscow side, all automobile-industry teams began calling themselves Torpedo), then switched to a steel mill and became Stal (\"steel\"), then went to another factory, then finally settled down at a plant which made car parts. Hence the name Rotor. They are now an independently owned team but the fans love the name.\n\nRubin (Kazan) is the Russian word for \"ruby\". No idea why this name was chosen, other than the fact that ruby is a nice-looking stone. True to the name, the team plays in red kits.\n\nShurik (as well as Shura and Sasha) is the Russian nickname for Alexander. My name is not Alexander however. I am simply using the name of my favorite Russian movie character.\n\nThe Moscow football club still is, and probably always will be, called Torpedo.\n\nHowever, the Russian word for the underwater missle is \"torpeda\". At the time when the club was created Soviet Union did not have any submarines and most of the naval terminology was taken from English, Dutch and German without any changes. The word was adapted for Russian grammar over time, became a feminine and acquired the \"a\" ending.\n\nActually, this is a myth propagated by some wishful-thinking Dinamo fans.\n\nThere was a team in the old Russia, in a small industrial town of Orekhovo-Zuyevo near Moscow, that was created by a pair of Blackburn-born Englishmen, who were supervisors at the Morozov Factories in the 1890s. The club (probably the first organized team in Russia) was originally called Morozovtsy and did wear blue and white in honor of the Rovers.\n\nOver time the Orekhovo-Zuyevo team became very strong, turned semi-professional and moved to Moscow, where it was renamed Sport Club Orekhovo, or SKO. It was one of the best pre-Revolution clubs in the city, but it disbanded in 1922, when the Moscow Football League was shut down.\n\nThe Dinamo team, which was created in 1923 has nothing to do with the definct SKO. The club was created by the NKVD (the secret police) and did not have a direct link to any of the old MFL sides.\n\nDinamo's white and blue color scheme was not officially introduced until 1926. Early on they wore white shirts and black shorts.\n\nTeam paraphenalia industry is very poor in Russia, and the reasons for that are beyond me. Either the clubs don't understand the value of the gold mine they are sitting on, or the licensing and production costs are too high to compete with the ocean of fakes and unofficial merchandise produced by fans and pirates everywhere.\n\nFor example, when visitning a CSKA home match in Moscow, you will see as many fans sporting a Barcelona shirt as those who wear a CSKA outfit. The colours are the same (red-blue stripes), but the Barca threads are easier to find than those of the local side. You will also see a huge amount of horribly-made fakes.\n\nMost of the scarves worn by Russian fans are not licensed product. They are inexpertly designed and made by diletantes, and, of course, in many cases by the hooligan groups themselves. The influence of the English hooligan culture is huge in Russia, hence the desire to emulate and to be recognized abroad.\n\nI am not sure why the Russian Railways advertize in English. The only reason I can think of is to convince foreigners to make the terrible mistake of travelling by train while in Russia. In addition to having to pay four times the amount taken from Russian citizens, they would willingly present themselves to the numerous thief gangs that infest the railroads."
