        "text": "My journey to the Underwater Hockey World Championship started over 20 years ago. I was working in a scuba store and we would play underwater hockey for three months in the winter to keep customers coming thru the store. One year, two of my friends and I decided to try the other team in the Twin Cities. They played all year round and went to tournaments. We were not ready to be done for the season and decided to join them. I started traveling and playing in tournaments. Eventually, this lead to helping coordinate and manage the 2016 USA Women’s Masters team.\n\nWhat is underwater hockey, you may ask? Underwater hockey is a little known sport that started in the U.K. in the 1950’s. It started more as underwater shuffleboard and was commonly called ‘Octopush’. Players wear a mask, snorkel, fins, headgear, mouth guard, glove and swimsuit. The puck weighs 1.3kg. Players push or pass the puck with a stick no longer than 350mm. Two teams of six line up on the end walls of a 25meter pool. Ideally, the pool should be between 2m and 3.65m deep. There can be up to four people in the substitution box. Goals are 3m long and located on each end of the pool. The object is to put the puck in the goal. There are about twenty active clubs across the U.S.A. There are regional and national tournaments, as well as the world competition. This year Nationals will be held June 10-12 in Denver. (Sorry, I won’t make the Herreid School Reunion.)\n\nThe World Underwater Hockey Championship was held in Stellenbosch, Republic of South Africa, March 25-April 2. The USA sent four teams, including Women’s Elite, Men’s Elite, Women’s Masters (age 32+) and Men’s Masters (age 35+). This is the first time in ten years that a Women’s Masters team was represented by the USA. The Women’s Masters team roster was started about 18 months prior to the event. Inquiries were made to see who was interested and who would qualify. There are also timed swimming trials to do that test fitness. A certain skill level that must also be met, i.e. shooting the puck, maneuvering the puck, etc. My team chose two events as mandatory attendance in order to be considered for the team. One was a women’s training event held in Minneapolis last October. The other was a regional competition in Milwaukee in January. We worked on strategies for play and formation. We also gained a coach with world level experience. Players live across the USA, so getting everyone together was a bit of a challenge. Some players got together and went to other tournaments to gain more experience and get used to playing with each other. Separately, we each had our workout routine to get to the world athlete level. My weekly routine consists of a combination of a swim 2500- 3600 yards, bike or walk in addition to the two regular underwater hockey practices.\n\nI flew from Minneapolis to Amsterdam, arriving in Cape Town on March 20. One of the U.S.A. referees and I toured Cape Town and the surrounding area. I had one day of sight-seeing before practices started on March 21. Practices consisted of a team meeting, warm-ups of 400+ yards, drills, and a scrimmage. Practice times are paid, so we shared some of our practices with other countries. We would scrimmage against them at the end of the time. The scrimmage time allows the teams to see what the other teams are like, as well as playing at the world level.\n\nThe games opened on March 25. Opening ceremonies were fun to see and participate in. Each country was called. The countries’ team would walk in with their flag dressed in team uniforms. There were 17 countries that participated in this world’s. Our first game was at 7:00am against South Africa. We were all shivering and laughing. “Come to South Africa they said. It would be warm they said.” March is the change of seasons there. The air temperature was 65-70 degrees Fahrenheit. Did I mention that it was an outdoor pool and we had to shower prior to getting in the pool? It was a bit chilly. We played one-two games per day. Each game consisted of a team meeting two hours prior to game time, a stretch or dry land warm-up, change, shower, gear inspection, pool warm-up, the actual game, change/shower and team meeting. The total time for each game was about four hours. We would also stay by the pool to cheer on the other teams and get acquainted with other players. The Women’s Masters team ended up 6th in the World.\n\nThe South African Women’s invited us to a wine tasting as Stellenbosch is the Napa Valley of South Africa. We had a great time playing a couple of games and chatting. There were lots of places to hike or walk. A nature center across from our guesthouse had a labyrinth. One of our players arranged reservations at a winery for a tasting and meal for Easter. I had two days of sight-seeing before I left the country. I got to see the penguins and Cape Point again."
