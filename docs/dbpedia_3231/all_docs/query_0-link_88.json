        "text": "ABOUT NICK\n\nNick Hobson has been in and around water his whole life. He was a competitive swimmer at high school in Scotland before playing the slightly obscure but highly enjoyable sport of Underwater Hockey for several years during which time he played for both the Great Britain and New Zealand Elite teams.\n\nNick’s first open water swim was in Loch Ness, Scotland, at the age of 16, swimming behind his Dad’s kayak preparing for the Scottish Open Water Championships in Loch Lubnaig where he finished second. While living in New Zealand, in addition to Underwater Hockey and Spearfishing Nick took up ocean swimming, competing in several ocean races around the North Island.\n\nSince relocating to Michigan 5 years ago Nick swims several times a week at the Holland Aquatic Center and regularly in Lake Michigan between May and Late September with his fellow Masters Swimmers and has swam from Holland to Saugatuck (7.5 miles) and Holland to Grand Haven (21 miles). On the Grand Haven Swim, Nick raised over $6,000 for Michigan based Breast Cancer non-profit The Pink Fund."
