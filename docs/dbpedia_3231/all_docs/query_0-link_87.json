I have been training for this competition for the last two years, attending training camps around the country and pretty much living in the pool.\n\nThe cost for the tournament is about $8000, which covers our flights to Hungary and accommodation. I'm looking to get $1000 from PledgeMe to help me on my way and get help from other companies.\n\nComments"
