        "text": "About Los Angeles Underwater Hockey Club\n\nWe are a co-ed group who love to play Underwater Hockey. We have players of all levels from beginners to members of the US World team. We encourage new players to come out and try this exciting sport. You do not need any special skills to play, and we were all beginners at some point in the journey. The club has all the gear you will need. Simply wear a swimsuit and bring a towel and your adventurous spirit!\n\nOur mascot, the Kraken, is the leviathan of the deepâ€¦feared by sailors and sea creatures alike. Beware! (We actually took our name from Kraken Rum but that is a tale for another time).\n\nThe club plays several times a week at the pools listed below. View our practice calendar on MeetUp"
