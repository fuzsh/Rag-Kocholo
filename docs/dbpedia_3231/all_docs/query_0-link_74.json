        "text": "Last year saw the revival of a tradition that had all but disappeared from Roger Bacon. A young friar, Bro. Roger Lopez, came here to spend his year of supervised ministry. This year comes before final vows, which Bro. Roger made on August 25th of this year. Many of you will remember young friar priests and brothers (and Franciscan Sisters) for whom Roger Bacon or OLA was a first assignment. Bro. Roger returned to Chicago to finish his studies for the priesthood. Everyone here at school hopes that heâ€™ll make his way back to Roger Bacon after he is ordained, bringing his enthusiasm and many personal gifts to our students. I can only hope that other young friars will also become part of the Franciscan tradition here at Roger Bacon. Fr. Bill Farris, OFM President"
