He finished ranked 12th in the nation in rushing yards and rushing touchdowns and his 15 total touchdowns put him eighth in the country. And he led the conference in all-purpose yards (1,299) and finished second in the league in rushing yards and third in rushing touchdowns.\n\nNamed the 12th-best returning edge rusher in the nation by HERO Sports, Kennedy finished 2023 with 28 stops (18 solo, 10 assisted), breaking up two passes and registering four quarterback hurries. Against Montana, Kennedy blocked a kick and at Idaho State Kennedy was in the backfield all game, finishing with eight total tackles and getting three sacks.\n\nEarlier in the week Connors was named to the Buck Buchanan Award Preseason Watch List, being named as one of the best 35 defenders in the nation.\n\nThe Aggie safety led the 2023 UC Davis secondary in total tackles (59) and solo tackles (36) finishing third and second on the team in both respective categories. He also added 2.5 tackles for loss, six pass break ups, one forced fumble and one interception.\n\nHe was named the seventh-best returning safety in the nation by HERO Sports. And among the top 30 returning safeties by HERO Sports, Connors ranks the highest among Big Sky colleagues sitting 11 spots higher than Northern Arizona's Alex McLaughlin, the next ranked Big Sky safety.\n\n2024 FALL CAMP: UC Davis opens fall camp on July 31 and all practices are open to media and fans.
