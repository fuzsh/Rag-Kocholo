        "text": "FANTASTICS NEWS!\n\nI turned this article into a book on Amazon. My second published book, and it inspired me to write up my page on Publishing. Please buy a copy! The book is built on tis article, but has many more team names, plus a lot of advice on how to create your own name. Who would appreciate this as a birthday gift? Your crazy uncle. Get him a copy!\n\nTitle:\n\nFunny Team Names: The Comprehensive Guide to Winning Best Team Name and Being Memorable In Your Pointless Team Event or Alcoholic Trivia Club\n\nLength: ................... 65 pages\n\nAmazon URL: ......... Amazon Paperback + Kindle Version\n\nBook Website: ........ this page!\n\nPublication date: .... May 28, 2021\n\nAmazon description:\n\nWouldn’t it be nice, to just once, win the funniest team name prize at trivia? This book is a comprehensive list of 800 funny team names - everything from “Southern Discomfort”, to “Fat Married People”, “Industrial Fuzz Bunnies”, “Unsolicited penis photos”, “Your Local Prostitutes”, “Eric’s little swimmers” and then the names too rude to put on the back cover. Yeah that gets you wondering.\n\nThis book covers everything from sports teams, to fitness groups, social clubs, planning committees, game nights, trivia teams, book-reading clubs or even that team building exercise that your boss is forcing you to do.\n\nYet this book is more than just a list of laugh-out-loud inappropriate group names. It also trains you to always be kick ass at naming a team. To learn the techniques to create something unique and funny. Even if you suck at the game, you’ll be memorable and make all your lousy team-mates smile, and that’s the next best thing to winning.\n\nAbout\n\nMany times during your life, you'll find yourself in a new team and suddenly asked to write down a team name. It could be a sports team, fitness group, trivia team, or even a team building exercise work is forcing you to do... the one consistent thing is that your group wants a kick-arse team name. A name like \"The Tigers\" may *sound* kind-of powerful, but the best names are almost always the funny and playful team names. \"The Asthmatic Ninja Tigers with Altitude Fear\" is longer, and yet more memorable - it paints a more vivid picture and gives you a shot at winning best team name. \"Team Rainbow\" is good, but with just one extra word \"Team Rainbow Juice\" is better. In a competition full of short plain names, don't be a afraid to take up a whole sentence and try something naughty and/or outside the box. Heck - you can even try making up a new word like \"HyperSynergisticPenguiness\" if you can't put together a real one.\n\nSo here you are, at your trivia night, and you know there's probably some kind of reward for the best (i.e. most hilarious) team name, but so far you're drawing blank. Nothing clever comes to mind. Even when you think \"my brain must be on vacation right now\" the semi-funny name \"Brains on Vacation\" hasn't occurred to you. The best people at coming up with team names are people that go to trivia every night and have remembered some of the best names, like \"My other outfit is a onesie\". Unfortunately, that's not you.\n\nOn this page I've scoured the internet for some of the funniest team names out there. With this list, you'll never again have to write down something uber lame like \"We couldn't come up with anything\" or \"best team name ever\" or \"team Doug\". Actually that last name is not so bad, but only because Doug is an awesome name. Use the funny team names below as ideas an inspiration to come up with something brilliant. The best names are, of course, topical to what you're doing and/or current events and/or who is in your team, so only copy it word for word if you have too.... you'll be more proud if you take these ideas, add in your situation, and whatever \"in jokes\" you have and make it golden.\n\nMany of these are kind of tailored toward funny trivia team names, but I've tried to keep in mind people coming to this page may be wanting to name all different kinds of team/clubs/groups/committees/societies/factions/cults/etc, so it should have something for everyone.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:\n\nUsually when I search the internet to make a list, like for Card messages, I find nothing but crap. Here, however, I found some great stuff online! I have stuff copied from all over the place, plus a few of my own and a couple from friends. It was a bit much to acknowledge each, but if you scroll to the bottom, I list some of the best website I found - most of which, of course, are compilations from other people. I'll never know who the original people were for any given name, but a big thank you to these people!\n\nKEY:\n\nI've used \"***\" to flag some of the best.\n\nNames with \"#\" are my own, or at least used by a team I was in once, so am casually taking credit for. ;)\n\nRelatively Safe Team Names\n\nLet's start with the relatively safe, generic and mildly amusing team names then work our way up.

Making fun of them is not optional - it's your duty. I haven't covered all nationalities, but there isn't a country or state on earth without a stereotype you can't turn into a team name. Just make sure it isn't a negative stereotype and consult with your minority first first and then your team. Fried chicken might be out.\n\nAmerica: best team name ever, if you don't agree you're a terrorist\n\nAmerica's best chance\n\nTexas is the smartest country I know\n\nCanada: America's hat\n\nDingo ate our babies * ..........

Any two sentence joke can be a team name. Below are just a few, but try it with your own favorite joke. The lame jokes can actually be the best.\n\nJoke: What's brown and sticky? ... A stick .......... (or \"poo\")\n\nWhat's brown and rhymes with snoop dog? Dr Dre.\n\nWhy did the koala fall out a tree? It died.\n\nWhat's red and smells like blue paint? Red paint.\n\nKnock knock .......... (if any team is drunk enough they'll yell out \"who's there\")\n\nCan someone stand up and tell a joke\n\nCall me delta Airlines, cuz I can't handle all your extra baggage\n\nA free beer to whoever stands up and does a good knock knock\n\nTeam Names For Reading Aloud\n\nFor something like trivia, you can expect or at least hope your team name gets read aloud by the quizmaster or MC at some point. Maybe every round. Most of the team names in this section play with that, and bring in a little interactivity.\n\nRibbing the MC\n\nA good MC should be able to handle hecklers and abuse, so why poke some fun and test him a little with words he'll might be embarrassed to say.\n\nSorry to change the subject, but I have a drinking problem #\n\nI wish this microphone was a penis ..........

(tongue twister - any will do)\n\nQuiz man, we will give you $5 if we win best name #\n\nThe quizmaster doesn't like the word vagina\n\nForeign Language\n\nI have never actually seen this, but it occurred to me that if you have a mix of foreign speakers spread about you can cause a commotion by writing in that language. The guy who reads it will have no idea if it's rude or not, and that's the beauty. Hopefully a few people around the room will be able to translate (or look it up) for their team. :)\n\nBaila para mí mono .......... (\"Dance for me monkey\" - in Spanish)\n\nSe deshace Mi mosca .......... (\"My fly is undone\" - in French)\n\nIch blase Ziegen .......... (\"I blow goats\" - in German - cheers Wayne's World)\n\nJabs at the Establishment\n\nIt won't get you free drinks, but it will earn a laugh. You might want to read the room for this one... if you're at a black tie event or nanna's Tuesday bingo you might think about the \"Safe as houses\" section.\n\nNext week we are taking our business to a fine drinking establishment down Oxley street because it has better questions, drink specials and it doesn't smell of spoilt food\n\nDon't order the burger, this is not mayonnaise #\n\nThe sticky stuff under the table is bubblegum right?\n\nWhere's Waldo?

If all else fails, pretty much 50% of all the white cards in a cards against humanity deck are winners for best team name. Don't believe me? Flip through a deck.\n\nNerdy board games\n\nTicket to ride... your sister\n\nSettlers of you mum\n\nCamel toe\n\nCards against humanity games\n\nPac man uncontrollably guzzling cum ..........

Did you buy this book just to help decide on a team name for your warcraft or fortnite friends. Maybe you suck at life, but hey, if it gives you satisfaction in life to frag a five year old boy in Russia then who are we to judge you. Nobody was actually hurt right. You just made someone cry, and your team name will make them extra angry.\n\nRandom server error\n\nPanicked keyboard mashing\n\nFraternity of frag\n\nGame over\n\nWeak signal\n\nDifferent timezone\n\nEven gamers get laid sometimes\n\nTrojan donkey\n\nDesktop warriors\n\nWe will destroy you and burn your village\n\nMom says bedtime is at 10\n\nMake love not warcraft\n\nBonus Round\n\nFuriously masturbating gerbils\n\nDingo ate my baby\n\nLegless wombat\n\nThrow another shrimp at Barbara\n\nGoddess of food porn\n\n24 hour food porn network\n\nTedEx wannabes\n\nMore STDs and worse ethics than a bar tender.\n\nSassy and trashy\n\nSkanks in spanks\n\nBlokes with jokes\n\nIt's not cheating if you don't get caught .......... (for board games)\n\nT-rex can't masturbate. That's why he's angry\n\nMaking Your Own Team Name\n\nCopying one of the above is fine, but if you want to be extra proud of taking out best name, use this list as inspiration and dream up your own. To come up with such names, here are four parting tips.\n\nDon't be afraid to:\n\nMake it long (helps you stand out) \"Alabama: because over there it's fine to meet your wife on ancestry.com\"\n\nPoke fun of people (your team, nationality, those in charge, other teams... whatever) \"My toupee is also French\"\n\nAdd colorful adjectives (especially with animal names) \"The juxtaposition unicorns\"\n\nBe naughty (suggestive names are the most memorable) \"Yes, we f**k on the first date\"\n\nGo get creative! :)\n\nConclusion\n\nHope you've enjoyed this list!\n\nI kind of finished on a low point - with the nerdy ones, but some of the names I found on the internet were so good I laughed to the point of crying when I read them. Some were actually too rude to copy here, but in the list of links below you might dig up some gems I either missed or decided were a little too much for this page.\n\nHave a great team activity with your awesome team name.... oh, and don't hesitate to email me other great names!\n\nSincerely,\n\nAndrew Noske\n\nPS: One day I may return to this page and address the face I've completely skipped team names for board game. My apologies/sympathy if you are one of these nerds. Just call yourselves \"A server error\" and get back to your starcraft and dungeons and dragons game. :)\n\nSee Also\n\nCard messages - Some funny things you can write into cards. Lots of the \"leaving work\" ones I came up with myself, and I'm pretty proud of. The rest are crap of course."
