        "text": "Name/Nickname: Elaine (Chairman)\n\n​\n\nDive Buddy: Debbie\n\n​\n\nDiver Grade: Sports Diver\n\n​\n\nKit: Jacket BCD / 12L\n\n​\n\nFavourite Dive/Wreck: Longbenton [Range Wreck] - The volume of marine life and shoals of fish were incredible. It made for a really memorable first ocean dive. It was really impressive and I was ‘buzzing’ after surfacing.\n\n​\n\nBackground: I always enjoyed snorkelling abroad so had a try dive whilst in Turkey. Unfortunately it turned out to be a bad experience, my BCD didn’t work and I ended up dropping to the sea bed (at 8 metres) on my first ever dive and needed the instructors to get me back to the surface. Several years later, my niece (Laura) joined SSAC (Scarborough Sub Aqua Club) and told me about the training and how she really enjoyed it. It prompted me to sign up for a try dive which was held in a swimming pool. Even though my bad experience had initially put me off diving, the thoroughness of the training in the UK gave me more confidence and now I have my own kit and dive various wrecks in the UK along with the rest of my family.\n\nProgression: Holidays are now focussed around diving. Have been to Mexico and Lanzarote and going to Malta this year. Going to go on as many UK dives as possible. Enjoy researching history of wrecks as well as marine life. Enjoys social side of things. Eventually want to look at being an instructor.\n\nName/Nickname: Matt (Vice-Chairman)\n\n​\n\nDive Buddy: Anybody\n\n​\n\nDiver Grade: Dive Leader\n\n​\n\nKit: Jacket BCD, 12L / 3L Pony\n\n​\n\nBackground: I first joined to learn to dive to pursue my interest in marine biology aged 16. I had no idea how much it would change my life! I’ve been all over the UK and parts of Europe with my diving. It gave me a basis on which to started university and put me in good stead with my work experience for scientific diving. It also gave me confidence I never knew I had to achieve things I never dreamt I would, such as organizing the Boxing Day Raft Race.\n\n​\n\nI didn’t realise just how good the diving is off Yorkshire! I was interested in diving locally anyway to see what was there but nothing prepared me for the variety of marine life and how incredible the wrecks are. Every wreck is different and no two dives are the same. OK, the North Sea isn’t as warm and clear as the likes of the Mediterranean, but the wrecks and marine life are certainly worth it! Many non-divers I speak to don’t believe there’s anything worth looking at in the North Sea and I’ve made it my mission in life to prove otherwise!\n\n​\n\nFavourite Dive/History: HMS E-49 in the Shetland Islands which I dived in July 2012. She was a British submarine which was mined in the First World War. It was an early morning dive, watching the sun come up as we anchored in. We descended down and the visibility was unbelievable, pushing thirty metres! We saw most of the submarine exposed including the brass conning tower, glass still in the periscope. A hydroplane lay upright and a ballast wheel lay on the sand. Even after 95 years I could still read the writing on it. And sightings of a large lobster and good sized ling were a nice treat too. Stunning dive.\n\nProgression: I also found a passion for maritime history. It was while talking with other members and diving the wrecks I began my own research into maritime history and became really interested in it. I even joined up with the Scarborough Maritime Heritage Centre and co-ordinated an exhibition there on behalf of the Scarborough Sub Aqua Club.\n\nName/Nickname: Kirsty (TBC)\n\n​\n\nDive Buddy: Spud or Phil\n\n​\n\nDiver Grade: Sports Diver\n\n​\n\nKit: Jacket BCD, 15L\n\n​\n\nHave you got a pony? No but I have a pet bird and a rabbit!\n\n​\n\nBackground: I came into the club to ask about the annual raft race because a friend and I wanted to take part. Even though I had done a PADI diving course back in South Africa years ago, it was not something I had to confidence to pursue. I signed up for a try dive through SSAC and the rest is history. I really enjoy the dive trips and this year was my first dive trip to Oban (2018) - it was great to see larger intact wrecks in more sheltered waters.\n\n​\n\nFavourite Wreck/History: HMS Falmouth (Bridlington)\n\n​\n\nOne of my first and most memorable dives was the HMS Falmouth (Bridlington Bay). It was one of the first British destroyers to be damaged and later sunk in the battle of Jutland. I am fascinated by the history of what we dive, especially the WW1 wrecks on the north east coast.\n\nProgression: Eventually I plan to start diving with a bailout or pony as I start to do deeper dives to 35m-40m. I am hoping to become a Dive Leader. Am looking to dive in Sodwana Bay in South Africa next year and maybe dive the Great Barrier Reef at some point as well as dive with sharks.\n\nName/Nickname: Edmund (Spud)\n\n​\n\nDive Buddy: Trainees!\n\n​\n\nDiver Grade: Dive Leader / Open Water Instructor / Snorkel Instructor\n\n​\n\nKit: Jacket BCD, 15L / 3L Pony\n\n​\n\nBackground: In 1982 I got slightly drunk in a bar in Northern Spain (L’Estartit) and signed up for a try dive which was a few days later. The kit was very basic, lungs were used for buoyancy and the dive cylinders were fitted with J valves (before submersible pressure gauges were common). I thoroughly enjoyed it and it gave me a sense of adventure. I dived abroad until 12 years ago and then dived with the club to bring my qualifications up to date.\n\n​\n\nFavourite Wreck/History: UC39 (Bridlington)\n\n​\n\nThe WW1 submarine has a lot of history; it intact and still has bulkheads. It has been there over 100 years . The prop from the sub is now in the maritime heritage centre in Bridlington.\n\nProgression: Close to completing Advanced Diver.\n\nWanting to do the accelerated deco course.\n\nName/Nickname: Sophie\n\n​\n\nDive Buddy: Martin (normally)\n\n​\n\nDiver Grade: Sports Diver (in training)\n\n​\n\nKit: Jacket BCD / 12L\n\n​\n\nFavourite Dive/Wreck: The P31 in Comino Malta. The visibility was so good we could see it from the surface. It was 20M down and 52M long so we could spend lots of time exploring. The wreck is made for divers so we could swim through all the rooms. There was lots of marine life including nudibranch and eels.\n\nI also loved the Farne Islands (in the UK) as we could dive with seals pup who were not shy and interacted with us.\n\n​\n\nBackground: I’ve always loved water and have been snorkelling for years. I did my first try dive in Lanzarote and instantly felt comfortable with it and was eager to train. Since then I have done inland dives, North sea dives and dives such in Mexico.\n\nProgression: I am now at University so I am going on a diving holiday with them and trips. I have now dived in 3 countries and hopefully this number will increase in the next few years. I hope to be a qualified Sports Diver by 2020."
