        "text": "Registration for 2023 Kings Cup is now open.\n\nThe event will take place 20 & 21 May 2023 on the Gold Coast.\n\nTeam registration & payment deadline: Friday 7th April 2023\n\nTeam lists and outstanding player payments due: Friday 5th May 2023.\n\n*You can add/change players if need be after the team registration deadline.\n\nInformation pack is available at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rs_wIJmToVTv-RwRWPda8ULFQzY7VyU1/view?usp=sharing\n\nThe team registration link is: https://forms.gle/h1A3hXW9WvJuDM8Z9\n\nFind out more at: https://www.facebook.com/sydneyuwh/\n\nImportant notes:\n\nWe have limited ability/pool space to accommodate more than total number of teams entered last year (18). So this year the FIRST 6 teams in each grade that register (fill out link AND pay their fees) will be guaranteed a spot, but any teams that register after that will have to wait to be confirmed entry – will depend on permutations of total games required in each division for X number of teams entered etc. We would prefer to not have to make games much shorter to accommodate late registering teams.\n\nWe are trusting clubs to enter appropriate strength teams in each grade. Although we have received feedback on how to grade teams, we are not aware of any quantitative/objective way to fairly grade teams and trust that for those who have attended past comps have got the feel of what constitutes an A, B or C grade team. It would also be ideal to set a quota of female players in each team/in water but we also feel that there is not enough depth across all clubs to make this a rule.\n\nThe Gold Coast Performance Centre (15mins from pool) has offered 10% off accommodation for any UWH teams that weekend. See info pack for details.\n\nAny questions/feedback please contact Ben Stepkovitch at steppo_94@hotmail.com\n\nThe UHA Annual General Meeting was held Saturday 15th October. Following a number of years of service to the UHA committee and community, five of the executive have stood down. It has obviously been a challenging last few years with Covid, and with motivation waning and life developments, these executives hope that some fresh appointments the ambitious plan and vision they have set out prior to Covid can be achieved in the future.\n\nNick Martyn, Jacko Smit, Eden Brown, Stewart Parkinson and Angus Sinclair have all served for a number of years on the committee as well as numerous other roles over the years. They have been a key part to undertake a number of positive changes for UHA. I thank them all for their efforts and dedication to UHA and wish them well in their future endeavours in and out of the pool.\n\nAUFQ in consultation with UHA and AUF made the decision to delay the 2022 Australian National Championships. The competition will now take place from the 4th to 9th July.\n\nThe reasons for this decision were as follows:\n\nLimited team registrations per division\n\nWA border restrictions have been extended and may not open until past the current comp date;\n\nCOVID 19 – associated risk to the tournament should any team be taken out by the impacts of Covid or the rules around close contacts of a positive case.\n\nAUFQ, UHA and the AUF hope that delaying the 2022 Australian National Championships until July will achieve the following:\n\nFacilitate WA state team inclusion across divisions;\n\nProvide a more stable and understood tournament environment in consideration of COVID 19.\n\nIncrease the likelihood of additional teams across divisions (inter-state/overseas).\n\nUpdates about the competition are posted on 2022 Australian National Championships Facebook page.\n\nShould you have any questions please contact AUFQ Organisers uwhnationals2022@gmail.com or the UHA Tournament Director (Stewart Parkinson) via email or mobile.\n\nA updated information pack and important dates will soon follow."
