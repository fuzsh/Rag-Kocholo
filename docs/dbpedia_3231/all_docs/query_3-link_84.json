Underwater hockey is a team sport played on the bottom of a pool where players use masks, snorkels, fins, gloves and sticks to move a heavy puck into the opposing team's goal. Players must have the proper safety equipment like a dual lens mask and soft snorkel, as well as high quality full foot fins for maneuvering. Success in underwater hockey requires teamwork and strategies like different formations and positioning to control the puck and score goals.",
