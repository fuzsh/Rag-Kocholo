        "text": "The New Zealand Menâ€™s Elite Underwater Hockey Team is heading off to Quebec City, Canada, to compete at the 20th World Championships, in July 2018, and we are looking for your support to help get us there!\n\nUnderwater Hockey is an up and coming sport which is rapidly gaining interest within New Zealand and all over the world. Unfortunately for our players, the sport is not funded in New Zealand and we need to pay our own way. The estimated cost per player totals $7000 so any contribution we receive will greatly help to fund our flights, accommodation, tournament entry and other travel expenses.\n\nThe team has been training hard to be in peak condition come tournament time and are averaging 12 training sessions per week on top of full time employment or study. Representing New Zealand are:\n\nHamish Arthur (Auckland)\n\nEdward Firth (Wellington)\n\nAndrew Gunn (Wellington)\n\nAndrew Harris (Wellington)\n\nNick Healy (Christchurch)\n\nAndre Heller (Wellington)\n\nJesse Hocking (Barcelona)\n\nBrendan Maxwell (Wellington)\n\nBen Paviour-Smith (Wellington)\n\nRob Tinkler (Auckland)\n\nLiam Watson (Hastings)\n\nJeremy Webster (Wellington)\n\nThank you in advance for your support, any amount of funding will be hugely appreciated and please feel free to share this page among friends and family!"
