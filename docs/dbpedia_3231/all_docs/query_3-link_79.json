        "text": "water polo, sport played in a swimming pool by teams of seven with a buoyant ball resembling an association football (soccer ball). The game was originally called “football-in-the-water,” and indeed it is more like association football and basketball than polo, the name of the sport coming from an earlier form of the game in which players rode barrels painted like horses and struck the ball with sticks. The aim of the game is to score a goal by throwing or dribbling the ball between the goalposts and under the crossbar of the defenders’ goal. The sport originated in Great Britain in the 1870s. The first rules were established in Scotland in 1877, when goalposts were suggested. When the first international water-polo match was held in London in 1890, Scotland won although the team was playing by British rules, which subsequently formed the basis of international regulations. The game was introduced to the United States in the 1880s. Great Britain was the first winner at the Olympic Games in Paris in 1900 and also at the 1908, 1912, and 1920 games. Great Britain’s early world domination was overtaken by Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, and eastern European countries.\n\nBefore World War II, two kinds of water polo were played: the water-soccer type, which used a fully inflated ball, weighing between 400 and 450 grams (14 and 16 ounces), and emphasized skillful passing; and the rugged body-contact style of play favoured in the United States, using a semi-inflated ball, with the premium placed on retaining possession. After 1937, however, only the game with the fully inflated ball has been officially recognized. Water polo is played in most parts of the world, and international competition is widespread. Women began competing internationally in 1978.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAmerican Sports Nicknames\n\nA water-polo team consists of seven active players and up to six substitutes. Each team wears either blue or white caps (red for the goalkeepers, with a blue or white number one; other players are numbered from 2 through 13). No grease or oil is allowed on the body. The two referees have final authority in each game; other officials include one or two timekeepers; one or two secretaries, who keep records of the many kinds of fouls, such as holding or hitting an opponent; and two goal judges. Water polo is regulated by the Fédération Internationale de Natation Amateur (International Amateur Swimming Federation; founded 1908) through its International Water Polo Committee, which issues Rules of Water Polo."
