        "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -- Maybe there's free food at the bottom of the water. Or maybe it's a practice run before a Spring Break trip to the Caribbean.\n\nOtherwise, why would 12 college students, donning snorkels, masks and flippers be so active at the bottom of a campus pool?\n\nWhat is actually going on under there?\n\n\"A lot of people are like 'What, underwater hockey?' sophomore Jordan Reeves said. \"So I get to tell the whole spiel about a thousand times a day.\"\n\nThe University of North Carolina's club underwater hockey team is one of more than 50 listed in the United States on PuckU.org. According to the site, more than 26 states and 35 countries have underwater hockey clubs. Domestically, the sport is particularly popular in California and Texas. Internationally, you can find teams from Australia to Brazil to the United Kingdom.The United States has a national governing body, USA Underwater Hockey, and fields national teams.\n\nThe UNC team plays in five or six tournaments a year, at schools as big and well-known as their own, including Michigan State and Illinois.\n\nWhen Reeves gets tired of describing the game, he points to YouTube."
