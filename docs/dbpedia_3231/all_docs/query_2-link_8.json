        "text": "“All hockey players are bilingual. They know English and profanity.”\n\nThat came straight from the mouth of Gordie Howe, himself.\n\nSince then, the game has transformed in almost every way imaginable. Players from overseas are ultimately bilingual, trilingual, quadrilingual or something even more impressive. But on the ice, your native tongue is replaced with slang, a whole other language of its own.\n\nSlang, of course, stems from excluding outsiders by using words and phrases only those on the “in” know. That means you’re here for a reason.\n\nMaybe you want to be on the “in” and understand more of what your favorite players and announcers are actually saying. Maybe you’re a parent and you just want to know what your kid and his team are blathering about half the time. Maybe you want to know what your team is blathering about.\n\nWell, whatever brought you here, below you’ll find the guide to some of hockey’s most common slang and terminology.
