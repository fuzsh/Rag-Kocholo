        "text": "Never have I imagined that World Underwater Hockey Champion player will come and teach me. But that’s the reality! On May 21-22, 2016, Stirling Underwater Hockey Club (SUHC) Team visited Jakarta for two-day coaching clinic at Ragunan pool, South Jakarta. For me, I was so thrilled that SUHC would fly all the way from Singapore to teach me and my team, and share their experiences. I am Mehran and I am member of Jakarta Underwater Hockey Club (JUHC) female team. My position is Center Forward.\n\nArrived on Saturday morning, Captain Pin Cheoh, Alice Chong, Chikuen Lee, Lisa Laminto, Helena, Simon Lee, Rudi Kurniawan, Elvie and Sheena Soh went to the pool after they all checked in the hotel. The first day of coaching session would soon begin, so excited….\n\nThe pool that we used is Ragunan Pool. This was the first time for me to play in Ragunan and found out that the pool is deeper (2.3 meter) than the one that we usually use at Bulungan. A bit narrow too, but it was okay. What made the place, somewhat, amusing was the pool staff that was very committed to their job. They had microphone and tirelessly reminded the visitors to take off sandals and to be very cautious not to swim at pool with 2 meters depth if they cannot swim well. Sometimes even they can sound grumpy over the microphone even though they just do their job, repeat the messages and prevent visitors from drowning.\n\nDay 1\n\nThe coaching session started with introduction from both Singapore team and Indonesian team, telling names, how long you have been playing underwater hockey and reasons why we love underwater hockey. I noticed some answers were funny as there was answer like “I found my husband here”. But, my reason to play underwater hockey is because this sport is physically and mentally challenging. To my surprise, most of the SUHC members have been playing this sport for more than seven years…wow…salute to them!!!\n\nThe introduction session was a wrap. Now it was time for game on. It was mixed game between SUHC and JUHC players. Well, to me, it was very hard to identify which SUHC girls who were actually my teammates because all of them, of course, wore same swimsuits. Except for Pin, the captain, you cannot ignore her muscular hand. That’s how I easily recognize her.\n\nAfter the first game, Indonesian female team was divided into three groups; beginner, intermediate and advance for drill session. Two persons from SUHC team accompanied each group and coached for certain topics, followed by individual review through video recording. A laptop was ready at the pool side to play the video.\n\nOn advance level, there are Chikuen and Elvie, SUHC members who coached us. They examined our kicking, curling, push and pull, and cobra skills. Pin was the observer. She gave advice and corrections to each member. Thank you, Pin.\n\nMoving on, all female team gathered at the poolside for whiteboard session. She distributed a guidance book that was given to her long long time ago by the famous and legendary Lena Plambeck, underwater hockey female player from Australia.\n\nPersonally, I call the book is the The Holy Book of JUHC female team. During the whiteboard session, Pin shared us several basic requirements that every forwards and backs should have.\n\nWe ended first day of coaching by…what else….GAME. This time, Indonesian female team divided into two teams but each team would get extra helps from two members of SUHC members.\n\nDinner!!!\n\nWoohoo…the game and coaching session might be over but that’s not the end. Next on the list is our favorite program dining and chatting. Puti’s house was the location for dinner. Our dinner menu was Tumpeng, cone-shaped rice dish with side dishes vegetables, meats and eggs typically served for special occasions. So many foods served at that time and I noticed Singaporean team ate a lot too but I wondered…..how they keep their muscular bodies stay in shape.\n\nWe ate; we chatted and took picture selfies or group photo. We just love to take picture whenever we get together. I used this occasion to chat with Alice, the pioneer of Shanghai Azures, and listened to her struggle establishing Shanghai Azures team. Even though there was never ending food provided, I decided to go home early to save energy for tomorrow.\n\nTo be continued……"
