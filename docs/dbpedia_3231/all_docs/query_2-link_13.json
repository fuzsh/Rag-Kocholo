        "text": "Hey,\n\nRecentley started playing a little U/W hockey and my cressi 2000 hd's aren't exactly kosher (hard plastic blade). Don't really want to speand a fortune on fins, but want to be able to motor w/out bloodying people (think that would be the classy thing to do).\n\nOld timers seem to be wearing mares quatro avanti... or comparable sporasubs. I also wouldn't mind a free diving fin if it was soft.\n\nAny suggestions would be apprectiated.\n\nIn another post I stated that I got to try out an underwater speedometer.. get this.. I matched the speed of my Pure Carbons twice (outta of total of 3 runs) with my Sporasub Cruise .. which I believe are the same as the Mares avanti quattro. So, I think those would be a good choice. I hope to do more testing of fins this winter.. want to test for acceleration differences from a stand (swim) still. By the way.. my pure carbons were the fastest of the fins I tested except for the mono and the speed was somewhat sustainable.\n\nThere are some uw hockey players on the board that may have more info for you.\n\nFred\n\nDef,\n\nI hunt in my cruises once in a while during those hot summer months when I don't have to use much weight. They work pretty well in water less than 10m. And yes, you could surface swim all day and never get sore. You'll find that the cruise footpocket is very similar to the gara pocket in size, shape and feel. Just make sure you have a set of finkeepers to use with em. Even the best fitting fin will get plucked off playing hockey.\n\nSave yourself some change and keep your eye on eBay. I've seen a pair of new 44-45's numerous times that were trying (without success) to sell for 40 or 50 bucks (with a mere 10 for shipping).\n\nTed"
