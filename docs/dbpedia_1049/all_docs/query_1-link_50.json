        "text": "It’s been three decades since New Kids on the Block released their breakthrough Hangin’ Tough album in 1988, and in celebration of the career-defining project, the Hangin’ Tough (30th Anniversary Edition) will come out on March 8, 2019.\n\nThe critically acclaimed album won the 1990 American Music Award for favorite pop/rock album and earned NKOTB a Grammy nomination for a companion film of the same name. It also features the boy band’s first No. 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100, “I’ll Be Loving You (Forever)”, which hit the top of the chart on June 17, 1989. The album’s title track also peaked at No. 1, with three more tracks cracking the top 10.\n\nThe reissue blends old with new, with five remixes and three newly recorded tracks, including recent single “80s Baby.” It will be available on digital and CD with a collectible 2LP picture-disc vinyl, and even an NKOTB.com exclusive cassette.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nLimited-edition merch is on pre-sale, along with the album for fans who want to secure autographed items.\n\nThe pop group also announced an accompanying 2019 North American tour that kicks off May 2. The MixTape Tour will be a true throwback, with special guests Salt-N-Pepa, Naughty by Nature, Debbie Gibson and Tiffany — who are all featured on “80s Baby” as well. Tickets are available now."
