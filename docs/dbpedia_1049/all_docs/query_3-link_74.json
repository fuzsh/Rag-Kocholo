        "text": "Rain, rain go away. Hurricane Isaias passed me by with no damage and it is headed up toward Myrtle Beach now carrying heavy rain, storm surge and high winds with it. In 1979, a 16-year-old girl, Brenda Spencer, who lived in a house across the street from the Grover Cleveland Elementary School in San Diego, California, was convicted of shooting and killing the principal and a custodian, while eight children and police officer Robert Robb were injured. A reporter asked her why she had done it, and she answered, “I don’t like Mondays. This livens up the day.” Bob Geldof, then the lead singer of the Boomtown Rats, read about the incident and he wrote the song ‘I Don’t Like Mondays’ about it and this became the band’s biggest hit. There is just something deeply wrong about writing a song about someone who fired at children playing in a schoolyard.\n\nThe Mamas and Papas had a #1 hit in 1963 with their third single ‘Monday Monday’, which is about the lousy feeling that comes with the end of the weekend and beginning of another workweek. John Phillips wrote this and neither Denny Doherty, Mama Cass or Michelle Phillips liked the song, and John Phillips claimed that he had no idea what the song meant. Larry Knechtel played keyboards, Joe Osborn played bass, Hal Blaine was on drums and P.F. Sloan played guitar on this recording. Michelle Phillips is the only surviving member of the group and the Mamas and the Papas were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nPrince Rogers Nelson using the pseudonym “Christopher” wrote the song ‘Manic Monday’ which became a big hit for the Bangles in 1987. This song is about a woman who is waking up to go to work on Monday, wishing that it was still Sunday, so she could continue relaxing. Prince gave the song to Bangles rhythm guitarist Susanna Hoffs, hoping that she would sleep with him. Christopher was the name of a character that Prince used in his movie Under the Cherry Moon. In the early ‘80s the Bangles were part of a Los Angeles movement known as the Paisley Underground and the next year, ‘Walk Like An Egyptian’ became a #1 song for them. The Bangles are not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nNobody ever said that there would be days like these, and in the John Lennon’s song ‘Nobody Told Me’ there are strange days indeed, as this remained unreleased till 1984 which was four years after he was already dead. The song contains the line “There’s UFOs over New York, and I ain’t too surprised”, which was inspired by Lennon’s alleged sighting of a UFO in 1974 while he was with his lover May Pang during a separation from Yoko. According to Pang, John yelled out the window “come back – take me!”\n\nIt doesn’t have to be a Monday or a day where it is raining to make you feel down, as sometimes we all get sad, feeling like we don’t belong, or that we don’t fit in a world that seems to be treating everyone else fine. The Wrecking Crew backed up The Carpenters on ‘Rainy Days and Mondays’ and this song went to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1971. This song was written by composer Paul H. Williams and lyricist Roger S. Nichols who also wrote the hit ‘Out in the Country’ together, which reached #15 for Three Dog Night and separately they wrote themes for popular TV shows, with Williams writing for The Love Boat and Nichols for Hart To Hart. They also wrote ‘We’ve Only Just Begun’ which was recorded by The Carpenters as well.\n\nTalkin’ to myself and feelin’ old\n\nSometimes I’d like to quit\n\nNothin’ ever seems to fit\n\nHangin’ around\n\nNothin’ to do but frown\n\nRainy days and Mondays always get me down\n\nWhat I’ve got they used to call the blues\n\nNothin’ is really wrong\n\nFeelin’ like I don’t belong\n\nWalkin’ around\n\nSome kind of lonely clown\n\nRainy days and Mondays always get me down\n\nFunny, but it seems I always wind up here with you\n\nNice to know somebody loves me\n\nFunny, but it seems that it’s the only thing to do\n\nRun and find the one who loves me (the one who loves me)\n\nWhat I feel has come and gone before\n\nNo need to talk it out (talk it out)\n\nWe know what it’s all about\n\nHangin’ around (hangin’ around)\n\nNothin’ to do but frown\n\nRainy days and Mondays always get me down\n\nFunny, but it seems that it’s the only thing to do (only thing to do)\n\nRun and find the one who loves me\n\nWhat I feel has come and gone before\n\nNo need to talk it out\n\nWe know what it’s all about\n\nHangin’ around (hangin’ around)\n\nNothin’ to do but frown\n\nRainy days and Mondays always get me down\n\nHangin’ around (hangin’ around)\n\nNothin’ to do but frown\n\nRainy days and Mondays always get\n\nMe down"
