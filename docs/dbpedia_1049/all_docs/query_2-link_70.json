        "text": "Blink-182‘s Mark Hoppus guests on a new version of the A Day to Remember song “Re-Entry.”\n\nThe updated recording features a reworked second verse with new lyrics and vocals from Hoppus. You can download it now via digital outlets.\n\n“When this song originally took shape it was without a doubt massively influenced by Blink-182,” says ADtR frontman Jeremy McKinnon. “So when the idea came up to do a remix of sorts for it, Mark was immediately who we pictured.”\n\nMcKinnon adds, “We sent [Hoppus] the track with no second verse and said to do whatever he was inspired to do and what he sent back genuinely makes the song for me. My younger self still can’t believe it exists.”\n\nThe original “Re-Entry” appears on A Day to Remember’s 2021 album You’re Welcome.\n\nIn other Blink-182 collaboration news, drummer Travis Barker adds to his ever-growing list of projects by producing a new song from the punk rap group Ho99o9 [pr. Horror]. The track, called “Battery Not Included,” is available now for digital download, and is accompanied by a video streaming now on YouTube.\n\nHo99o9 will be opening for Slipknot‘s Knotfest Roadshow tour beginning in May.\n\nCopyright © 2022, ABC Audio.
