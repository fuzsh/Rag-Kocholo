        "text": "Boduf Songs used to be the work of one man, a guitar, and acres of chilly blank space. Mat Sweet whispered his vocals and the songs were devotionally paced, but in their unremitting, medieval bleakness, there was a hint of metal: If Phil Elverum's love of black metal were more palpable in his Mount Eerie records, they might sound more like Sweet's work as Boduf Songs. Not coincidentally, Sweet has worked in harder, noisier climates: His crawling doom metal work in Map of Hell or his Mogwai-reminiscent post-rock outfit Four Man Ghost, both on his own label Blue Baby Recordings, testify to a lifelong membership to that society. But Boduf Songs, save for a few light, menacing drones, has always been a space for contemplation. These were songs that a member of the Night's Watch might hum to himself to keep warm as he crunches through the snow north of The Wall. All of Sweet’s spellbinding releases as Boduf Songs were of this one, grey piece.\n\nOn Burnt Up on Re-Entry, Sweet's latest as Boduf Songs, it's immediately clear that something different is happening. The album title evokes an object hurtling its way to the Earth, and the opening sound follows suit: The first thing you hear is a gargling, wheedling electronic shriek, like a mechanical valkyrie diving for your eyeballs. Sweet is still whispering, but it's a menacing stage whisper now of the \"we have your wife and children\" variety. The song, \"Fiery the Angels Fell\", concludes with with a conflagration of guitars, while a twitching wire of a drum track tweezers your nerve endings. Electronic locusts chitter, and Sweet sings, repeatedly, \"Hallelujah, we laid them with the rest.\" The Visigoths have raided the temple.\n\nTo hear the implied metal break out onto the surface of the Boduf Songs project is a thrilling moment; it consummates four album's worth of gathering menace. \"Everyone Will Let You Down In the End\" lurches in its final minutes into a La Brea tarpit of down-tuned doom guitars. But the best and most rewarding additions to the landscape are the electronic elements: Throughout Burnt Up, the processed sounds that used to drift miles past in the background press their leering faces right up to the window. As \"Song to Keep Me Still\" builds to its climax, the distant sonar ping that starts out as a ghostly presence sprouts fangs and threatens to overwhelm the song. \"Whither Thou Goest, Cretin\" opens on a blankly firing piston of a beat, like a copy machine whirring away in the next room. Electro bubbles travel like quicksilver up its rigid backbone, and the song locks into a rigor-mortis dance-pop groove reminiscent of Pretty Hate Machine. \"Long Divider\" opens with a Casio bump not far away from Leonard Cohen's \"I'm Your Man\".\n\nSweet still has a tendency to over-smear the stage blood in his lyrics-- at one point, he actually sings \"We'll grind your bones to make our bread.\" But his vocals are warmer than usual, and even allow some outbreaks of multiplart harmony, warm pockets furtively stirred into the cold. \"Maggot Ending\", despite its title, might be the most calming, beatific song Sweet has written. The album ends on another bleak landscape, a collage piece of digital swarms, beeps, subterranean thumps, and no human life. It sounds like the final transmission retrieved from the titular burnt-up spacecraft. It's despairing and unfriendly, but it opens up an entire new world for Sweet to explore, and is richest and most surprising Boduf release yet."
