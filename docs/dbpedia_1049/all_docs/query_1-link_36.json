        "text": "Description\n\nJohn Hiatt mixed pop, folk, rock, R&B, country, and gospel on his debut album “Hangin’ Around The Observatory”, released in 1974. The title indicates his position: Hiatt‘s songs show him an acute observer. Hiatt earned critical kudos for this album, and Three Dog Night (who knew good songwriting when they heard it) covered “Sure As I’m Sittin’ Here” on their album Hard Labor getting a Top 20 hit out of it.\n\nAdditional information\n\nArtist\n\nJohn Hiatt\n\nGenre\n\nRock\n\nTracks\n\n1 Maybe Baby, Say You Do 2 Whistles In My Ears 3 Sure As I’m Sittin’ Here 4 Rose 5 Hangin’ Around The Observatory 6 Full Moon 7 Wild-Eyed Gyspies 8 It’s All Right With Me 9 Little Blue Song For You 10 Ocean"
