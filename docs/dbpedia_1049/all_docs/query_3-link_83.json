        "text": "Railroad Earth. Where and when: 8 p.m. Saturday at the Community Theatre at Mayo Center for the Performing Arts, 100 South St., Morristown; 6:20 p.m. July 12 at the XPoNential Music Festival (also featuring Michael Franti and Spearhead, Amos Lee, Nicole Atkins and others) at Wiggins Park, Camden. How much: $25 in Morristown; call (973) 539-8008 or visit mayoarts.org; in Camden, $25 for the day or $60 for a four-day pass to the festival; call (215) 222-1400 or visit xpn.org.\n\nThe Jersey-based bluegrass-jam band Railroad Earth will perform at the Community Theatre in Morristown on Saturday, but will spend much of the next two months at music festivals. Rock festivals, folk festivals, bluegrass festivals -- they'll hit a dozen or so.\n\n\"One of the things I really enjoy about the band is the wide diversity of places that we seem to fit in,\" says singer/songwriter/guitarist Todd Sheaffer, 45, of Stillwater, adding that the audience gets more or less the same thing, no matter what the setting is.\n\n\"If we're at a bluegrass festival, it will be influenced by that somewhat, but we won't do a strictly bluegrassy set,\" Sheaffer says. \"The reason we're invited to a bluegrass festival is to provide more of a rock-bluegrass alternative.\" The band, a sextet that also includes mandolinist John Skehan, violinist/guitarist Tim Carbone, drummer Carey Harmon, bassist Johnny Grubb and guitarist/banjoist/saxophonist Andy Goessling, recently released its fifth album, Amen Corner. Like its predecessors, the album is full of virtuoso roots playing, with warm lead vocals and sturdy songwriting by Sheaffer.\n\n\"Amen Corner\" has a loose, unhurried feel, so it comes as no surprise to learn that it was recorded at Sheaffer's farmhouse rather than a conventional studio.\n\n\"It's something I've always wanted to do,\" says Sheaffer, a former member of the band From Good Homes. \"First of all, (the farmhouse) had a nice warm sound to it -- old wood has a nice warmth to it. And it was just a fluid and free working environment.\"\n\n\"Many of the tracks,\" Sheaffer says, \"were recorded almost immediately after the songs were written. Rather than rehearsing everything, arranging everything and then taking it to a studio, we were doing everything at the same time and capturing the first performance of a song, which I think is often the best one.\n\n\"With some of the songs, I had the idea in the morning, and had the idea done and recorded by the end of the day, which is a real luxury. Normally, you have something and by the time you get to realize it, its not as fresh as it was.\"\n\nThe album's title comes from the opening phrase of its first song, \"Been Down This Road.\" \"Come around Amen Corner/And there she's standing in the door/Staring in the eyes of my poor soul,\" Sheaffer sings.\n\nHe says he knew \"Amen Corner\" from golf -- the words are used to describe a particularly difficult stretch of the Augusta National course, where the Masters is played. But he wasn't thinking about golf when he wrote the song. He just thought the words were right for that line.\n\nSince settling on the album title, the band has researched the phrase, and found out it can refer to a section of a church and is the name of a London street. The sportswriter who first used it in connection with the Masters said he knew it from a jazz song, \"Shoutin' in That Amen Corner,\" recorded by Mildred Bailey and others.\n\nAs an album title, of course, it carries a connotation of gospel. \"Amen Corner\" is not a gospel album, but it does offer a bit of Southern-gospel flavor along with the bluegrass, rock, folk and other forms of music that Railroad Earth plays.\n\n\"It's more of that than anything else,\" Sheaffer says. \"We just did some shows in Denver, and we had a three-piece gospel choir backing us up, and that pushed the gospel element a little bit. And it was fantastic -- it worked out well. That's more of what we're talking about.\""
