        "text": "How many A Day To Remember fans are left after the band unleashed You’re Welcome last year?\n\nWell, for those that would rather forget that record existed (catch Browny’s review of it here), maybe this might win you over. The band have gone back into the studio and done a hot retake of the track ‘Re-Entry’ with none other than Blink-182’s Mark Hoppus!\n\nOverall, it doesn’t stray too far from the album version. With Hoppus making his mark on verse two, ‘Re-Entry’ is ADTR’s latest take on their pop punkier sound. It does sound inspired by the band’s Common Courtesy era, and it is quite the jam — just don’t expect the heaviness of ‘Right Back At It Again’!\n\nMeanwhile, Mark Hoppus seems to be making quite the musical comeback ever since getting the all clear from cancer. This week, he also appeared on alternative/pop artist Smrtdeath’s track ‘adding up’, to which I can confirm is a certified banger. He’s also set to appear on the forthcoming Avril Lavigne album, Love Sux next month. Geezus. He’s almost as busy as his Blink-182 bandmate, Travis Barker. No wonder we’re still waiting on the next Blink record…\n\nWords by Tamara May @citylightstam\n\nStream ‘Re-Entry (featuring Mark Hoppus)’ here"
