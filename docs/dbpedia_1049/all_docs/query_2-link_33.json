        "meta_description": "SFD043: Saytek - Re Entry by Superfreq, released 27 October 2017\n\n1. Re Entry (Live)\n2. Just My Opinion (Live)\n3. Acid Jam Six (Live)\n\nFollowing acclaimed releases for the labels of John Digweed (Bedrock), Marshall Jefferson (Freakin303), Darren Emerson (Detone), and Kevin Saunderson (KMS), UK super-producer Saytek (aka Joseph Keevill) makes his Superfreq label debut with the Re Entry EP.\r\n\r\nHaving cut his teeth as a young clubber and producer at many of Superfreq icon Mr.C’s influential parties – including Vapourspace, Subterrain, and the early Superfreq events – Saytek has become one of the electronic music scene’s most in-demand live acts. Recently named ‘one of the UK’s freshest and exciting acts’ by Carl Cox and a recent BBC Radio One live session that B.Traits called ‘incredible’, Saytek writes, produces and performs everything live on the fly, using a myriad of machines and effects. \r\n\r\nFrom multiple shows in Ibiza at The Terrace of Space (RIP) &amp; The Zoo Project, regular performances at fabric to Berlin appearances at Tresor, Sisyphos and a residency at Golden Gate, plus a relentless international tour schedule, it’s no wonder that legends and elite DJs like Maceo Plex, Derrick May, and Laurent Garnier are consistent supporters of Saytek’s releases.\r\n\r\nCulled from a series of live jams and edited down into DJ-friendly form, this three-track debut for Superfreq captures the energy and excitement of a live Saytek set and distills it for the dancefloor. The Re Entry EP is truly a unique blend of improvised live deep techno &amp; tough house grooves with dubby acid hues, sonically embodying all the best elements of Superfreq’s sound and vibe as a label and a party.",
