(Uhh, yeah dog, what is it?)\n\nWhat is it? (Dude chill, man)\n\nIt is Limp Bizkit\n\nAll around the world you know me\n\nAll around the world we know you\n\nAll around the world you know me\n\nAll around the world we know you\n\nWriter(s): John Everett Otto, William Frederick Durst, Sam Rivers<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
