        "text": "Lainey Wilson tells her lover to chill out just a bit longer and she’ll be home soon in her barn-burning new song “Hang Tight Honey.”\n\nWith elements of her own autobiography, the song opens with Wilson recalling how she had a “bus ‘fore I got a house/cause that’s what dreams make you do.” In other words, she’s a road dog and, damn, if any relationship is going to keep her off the stage. But that doesn’t mean she’s not wishing for her fella: “While this six string calls my name/baby, I’ll be missing yours.”\n\nTrending\n\n“Hang Tight Honey” is the second track to be released from Wilson’s upcoming new album, Whirlwind. Announced last week, the record, out Aug. 23, was recorded with Wilson’s live band, and there’s a certain energy to the songs that only comes from touring together. (Check out the ripping solo that ties “Hang Tight Honey” together.)"
