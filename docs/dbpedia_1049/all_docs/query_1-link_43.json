        "text": "Fans hungry for a taste of new music from Eric Church were given a treat on Friday (Aug. 10) when the singer shared a snippet of his latest work, \"Hangin' Around,\" from his upcoming album Desperate Man.\n\nThe song marks the second tune Church has revealed (following the title track, which he unveiled last month), and based on the short preview we've been provided it's a definite rocker. The snippet consists of a repeated chorus of the song's title and an edgy, blazing '70s vibe permeating overall.\n\nChurch previewed the song with his fan club the Church Choir a day before the general public, and noted that this song will be the second in the overall 11-song tracklisting of the new album.\n\nDesperate Man is set for release Oct. 5. The title track was inspired by the emotional aftermath of the mass shooting that took place at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas in October of 2017. Like \"Hangin' Around,\" the song builds retro-sounding rock and soul vibes into its country foundation, and is a marked sonic departure from anything the singer has done to date.\n\nChurch played the opening night of the Route 91 three-night festival, and was not present on the closing night when shots were fired during Jason Aldean's headlining set, but he was profoundly affected by the tragedy, which killed 58 people and wounded hundreds more."
