        "text": "In her latest album, “Re-Entry,” Marianne Solivan reminds us all of her elite artistry and powerhouse voice. The jazz community has been eagerly awaiting to hear this new outlet of well-crafted stories she has to share with the world and it does not disappoint. Marianne has seemingly reinvented herself, or ‘come into her own,’ as her new music reflects her authenticity and genuine emotions. “Re-Entry” is Marianne’s fifth album as a bandleader, and it is anticipated to be a huge landmark in her career.\n\nMarianne Solivan’s Early Career and Passion For Jazz\n\nMarianne Solivan stands out as the only female singer powerhouse to lead a big band. Currently, there is no known female bandleader in the jazz scene that matches her caliber and skill.\n\nThis achievement is a result of her hard work and passion for jazz, which began during her earlier years when she attended Berklee College of Music and The New England Conservatory in Boston, Massachusetts. There she built a solid musical foundation, receiving Bachelor’s degrees in Music Education and Performance and a Master’s in Jazz Studies. When she wasn’t focusing on school in Boston, Marianne was incredibly busy, often performing five or six gigs a week.\n\nAfter finishing her education, she embarked on an exciting move to New York City and found herself performing at renowned jazz clubs alongside some of the city’s most talented jazz musicians. She has had the pleasure of performing at Smoke Supper Club, Smalls Jazz Club, Dizzy’s Club Coca-cola, Birdland, The Blue Note, and several other renowned venues. She has also had the privilege of collaborating with renowned musicians including Christian McBride, Peter Bernstein, Buster Williams, Jeremy Pelt, Lewis Nash, Bruce Barth, Dezron Douglas, Johnathan Blake, Gregory Hutchinson, and Steve Wilson.\n\nThroughout this entire experience, her skills as a bandleader skyrocketed and her repertoire expanded, opening up opportunities for her to headline tours in Europe, Russia, Eastern Europe, Japan, and throughout the US.\n\nPrevious Work And Music\n\nWhen it comes to creating music, Marianne continuously seeks to collaborate with top arrangers and instrumentalists in the jazz network in order to expand her repertoire. Her vision is to form a band that performs one-of-a-kind arrangements with high energy and rhythmic qualities of swing jazz.\n\nHer previous work is a testament to this vision. Prior to “Re-Entry,” Marianne has released four other albums:\n\nPrisoner of Love (2012)\n\nSPARK (2017)\n\nMarianne – Live in Europe\n\nMood for Love (2023)\n\n“Re-Entry” Album\n\nMarianne Solivan’s latest album, “Re-Entry,” delivers exactly what fans have come to expect—excellent music that captivates, even without a live performance. Though hearing it live would undoubtedly be an enhanced experience, the album itself stands strong with its mesmerizing quality.\n\nMarianne’s band members include Leandro Pellegrino on guitar, Brandon McCune on piano, Steve Wood on bass, Alex Terrier on saxophones, and Jay Sawyer on drums. Their collaboration started during the Pandemic when Marianne and some friends hosted performances for their neighbors in Prospect Park, New York, simply to have fun and enjoy music outdoors. Eventually, the small gatherings evolved into live stream concerts, cementing the strong musical bond between them that led to the creation of their band and “Re-Entry.”\n\nIn “Re-Entry,” Marianne skillfully combines classic standards and her original compositions, all custom arrangements for her ensemble. She penned lyrics for the songs “Before It’s Time” and “I Burn For You,” and also connects her Puerto Rican heritage in the songs “Tal Vez” and “Debí Llorar.”\n\nMarianne is a master storyteller, bringing her songs in “Re-Entry” to life with each note. Her unique ability to charm her audience is evident as her personality shines and her soul pours out, embodying the emotion of each song. The arrangements are tight and well-crafted combining her powerful vocals with the band’s accompaniment to create a sound that both relaxes and excites you. The instrumentals and solos are smooth, atmospheric, and sometimes cheeky, and just like the keystone in an arch, Marianne’s vocals and confident leadership hold everything together flawlessly.\n\nMarianne’s voice has a seductive and velvety quality to it. It sounds like what you would imagine a luxuriously thick, hot chocolate topped with fluffy whipped cream would taste like. Her ability to convey lyrics with raw emotion and sincerity sets her apart, making her performances deeply touching. Bearing her true colors, Marianne ‘re-enters’ the jazz scene with her new album “Re-Entry,” serving well-baked music on a pretty platter that truly reveals the deliciousness that is her artistic essence."
