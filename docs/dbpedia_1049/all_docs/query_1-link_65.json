        "text": "Blues Traveler have announced they will release their 13th studio album, Hurry Up & Hang Around, on October 12 via BMG. The effort will mark the band’s first since 2015’s Blow Up the Moon and comes after the group’s recent 30th anniversary tour celebration.\n\nFor Hurry Up & Hang Around, frontman John Popper and his bandmates recruited producer Matt Rollings to work with them in a rented Nashville house to write and eventually record the album’s 12 tracks.\n\n“We were going through some changes as far as our infrastructure goes,” Popper says in a press release. “We parted ways with two different managers. No preparations had really been made, and it seemed like it might be too late to make new music. Between taking meetings, we were by ourselves writing in the garage every day of this Nashville house. That was pretty cool, because we felt like a garage band again. There was a spirit of survival. We had something to celebrate, so we really came together as a band. Matt put it all on turbo boost, because he’s one of the finest producers we’ve ever worked with, period. He can bring out any sound he wants. He got takes out of me that I couldn’t ever get out of myself, and I’ve tried. However, he also let me be me. It’s one of the best production experiences we’ve ever had. It was an unexpected musical education.”\n\nPre-order Hurry Up & Hang Around here. The album’s first single, “Accelerated Nation,” will be available July 6. Blues Traveler will return to Colorado’s famed Red Rocks Amphitheatre next week for their annual July 4 celebration before heading on an extensive touring schedule for the rest of 2018.
