        "text": "Ernest feat. Morgan Wallen - âHangin' Onâ\n\nLabel: Big Loud Records\n\nRelease Date: April 12th, 2024\n\nProducer: Joey Moi\n\nSongwriters: Ernest Keith Smith, Grady Block, Rhys Rutherford, Jacob Durrett & Rafe Tenpenny\n\nFeaturing 26 tracks that are somehow all must-listens, Nashville, Tennessee by Ernest â the country croonerâs third studio album â hit all music streaming services on April 12, instantly making waves with one track in particular: 'Hanginâ On' featuring Morgan Wallen.\n\nWhile the record features collaborations with some of the biggest names on the country music scene as of late â from Lainey Wilson to Jelly Roll to HARDY and beyond â fans were especially thrilled to see yet another duet between Ernest and Wallen after the success of their previous duets, 'Flower Shops' and 'Cowgirls,' which has made waves on both social media and streaming services.\n\nWith two top notch collaborations, this third collaboration could not have come at a better time.\n\nWhile 'Flower Shops' is known for being on the sadder side and 'Cowgirls' is best described either a pregame or party anthem, 'Hanginâ On' is a stark contrast from the songs that country music lovers know and love from this duo, showing off a much more angry, aggressive and â for lack of a better term â badass side of both stars.\n\nBeginning with some chilling guitar chords, 'Hanginâ On' blends into a catchy beat-driven tune, utilizing the trap-leaning sound that is heard within 'Cowgirls,' as well as Wallenâs song 'Broadway Girls'.\n\nLayered behind Ernest and Wallenâs vocals â which combine the smooth versalitility of R&B and rap with a touch of country twang â the overall sound has been compared to Post Malone and his country music career so far.\n\n\"Bar light open\n\nAnd I was hoping\n\nIâd find a flame that burns just like you\n\nNeon shadows across the dancefloor\n\nThat spun you âround just like you wanted me to\n\nWhiskey shot whiskey shot\n\nGet me drunk take me home\n\nThatâs what you were tellinâ me now\n\nMorning came I woke up\n\nNow youâre gone for good\n\nAnd Iâm losing my sleep\"\n\nThroughout, Ernest and Wallen try to find clarity after being ghosted by a love interest.\n\nThe first verse sets the scene of the evening, sharing that the narrator entered the bar that fateful night to âfind a flame that burns just like you,â ultimately achieving this goal. Describing a dance floor with âneon shadows,â it's implied that this bar is a honky tonk, where the narrator later dances with a beautiful woman and takes whiskey shot after whiskey shot, prior to drunkenly leaving together.\n\nWhile this rowdy night out is seemingly smooth sailing, things take a turn for the worse in the second half of the verse, as the narrator appears to get ghosted by the woman who he left the honky tonk with. âMorning came I woke up / Now youâre gone for good / And Iâm losing my sleep,â Ernet sings, prior to delving into the chorus of the track alongside Wallen.\n\n\"You left me hanginâ on\n\nBy a thread of them blue jeans\n\nBaby now Iâm wondering where it all went wrong\n\nGot me hanging on to some Jack and some Jim Beam\n\nTryinâ hard as hell just to get you gone\n\nBut itâs takinâ too long\n\nFor this heartache to give up\n\nNow I canât get up\n\nOff of this old barstool\n\nYou left me hanginâ on\n\nBy a thread of them blue jeans\n\nBaby now Iâm wondering where it all went wrong\n\nYou got me hanginâ on on\n\nGot me hanginâ on\"\n\nWaking up devastated, the narrator is now racking his brain trying to figure out what he did wrong to make this woman leave without a trace, coping with the pain the only way that a broken-hearted country boy knows how: alcohol.\n\nâGot me hanging on to some Jack and some Jim Beam / Tryinâ hard as hell just to get you gone,â Ernest and Wallen sing in the chorus, implying that they are using excess amounts of alcohol to try to numb the pain and forget about the heartache that they are feeling.\n\n\"Girl I canât take anymore\n\nNo I canât take that goodbye\n\nCanât pick my heart off the floor\n\nCause you got me some kind of high\n\nI never felt but I liked it\n\nDidnât try to fight it\n\nHowâs I supposed to know\n\nThe next day Iâd feel like dyinâ\n\nWhiskey shot whiskey shot\n\nGet me drunk take me home\n\nI wish you were tellinâ me now\n\nIn my head I see you in my bed\n\nBut I know that itâs all just a dream\"\n\nIn the second verse, taken over by Wallen, the narrator is feeling helpless, admitting that he âcanât take anymoreâ and âcanât take that goodbye,â seemingly left with a shattered heart.\n\nGushing that this girl was truly one in a million â mimicking âsome kind of highâ that he has never felt before â he was unaware of the heartache that he would have to endure after she abandoned him the following morning.\n\nIn the second half of this verse, the narrator reminisces on the night he met this woman, before realizing that trying to relive that evening is nothing but a dream.\n\nTo follow, Ernest and Wallen team up for two more choruses to close out the track.\n\nWhile neither artist has spoken out about 'Hanginâ On,' Ernest teased a solo version of the track via TikTok in May, instantaneously garnering an excited reaction from fans in the comment section of the post.\n\nâDudeeeeeee if I could like this 100000000000x I would,â one TikTok user gushed. Another dished, âYessss!!!! This song is ð¥ð¥ð¥â âRelease this ASAP,â a third TikTok user demanded.\n\nWhile the 'Last Night' singer was not announced as a collaborator on the track at the time, some fans speculated that the duo would pair up for 'Hanginâ On' based on the sound of the song alone, with one viewer asking âIs this Morganâs beat?â in the comment section of the post, with another replying âHe's gonna be on it.â\n\nDespite speculation leading up to its release, Ernest and Wallen have kept quiet about the brand new tune before it dropped on April 12.\n\nBar light open\n\nAnd I was hoping\n\nIâd find a flame that burns just like you\n\nNeon shadows across the dancefloor\n\nThat spun you âround just like you wanted me to\n\nWhiskey shot whiskey shot\n\nGet me drunk take me home\n\nThatâs what you were tellinâ me now\n\nMorning came I woke up\n\nNow youâre gone for good\n\nAnd Iâm losing my sleep\n\nYou left me hanginâ on\n\nBy a thread of them blue jeans\n\nBaby now Iâm wondering where it all went wrong\n\nGot me hanging on to some Jack and some Jim Beam\n\nTryinâ hard as hell just to get you gone\n\nBut itâs takinâ too long\n\nFor this heartache to give up\n\nNow I canât get up\n\nOff of this old barstool\n\nYou left me hanginâ on\n\nBy a thread of them blue jeans\n\nBaby now Iâm wondering where it all went wrong\n\nYou got me hanginâ on on\n\nGot me hanginâ on\n\nGirl I canât take anymore\n\nNo I canât take that goodbye\n\nCanât pick my heart off the floor\n\nCause you got me some kind of high\n\nI never felt but I liked it\n\nDidnât try to fight it\n\nHowâs I supposed to know\n\nThe next day Iâd feel like dyinâ\n\nWhiskey shot whiskey shot\n\nGet me drunk take me home\n\nI wish you were tellinâ me now\n\nIn my head I see you in my bed\n\nBut I know that itâs all just a dream\n\nCause you got me hanginâ on\n\nBy a thread of them blue jeans\n\nBaby now Iâm wondering where it all went wrong\n\nNow Iâm hanging on to some Jack and some Jim Beam\n\nTryinâ hard as hell just to get you gone\n\nBut itâs takinâ too long\n\nFor this heartache to give up\n\nNow I canât get up\n\nOff this old barstool\n\nYou left me hanginâ on\n\nBy a thread of them blue jeans\n\nBaby now Iâm wondering where it all went wrong\n\nAnd why you got me hanginâ on on\n\nGot me hanginâ on\n\nYou left me hanginâ on\n\nBy a thread of them blue jeans\n\nBaby now Iâm wondering where it all went wrong\n\nGot me hanginâ on to some Jack and some Jim Beam\n\nTryinâ hard as hell to get you gone\n\nBut itâs takinâ too long\n\nFor this heartache to give up\n\nNow I canât get up\n\nOff of this old barstool\n\nYou left me hanginâ on\n\nBy a thread of them blue jeans\n\nBaby now Iâm wondering where it all went wrong\n\nYou got me hanginâ on on\n\nGot me hanginâ on\n\nââ\n\nFor more on Ernest, see below:"
