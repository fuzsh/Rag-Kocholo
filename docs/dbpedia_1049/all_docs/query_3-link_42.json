        "text": "The latest single from Lonesome River Band, titled “Hang Around for the Heartbreak” (Mountain Home Music Company, 2024), epitomizes traditional bluegrass. With banjo player Sammy Shelor’s distinctive rhythmic style leading the way, the song carries the band’s hallmark sound. Vocalist Adam Miller delves into the theme of enduring love despite its potential pitfalls, in a mid-tempo confession:\n\nIt’s hard to keep a secret in a little town\n\nWhere everybody knows everybody they all talk about\n\nRumor has it we’re two of a kind\n\nIf I don’t break your heart first, you’ll break mine\n\nIt’s just a matter of time, but that’s all right\n\nWith a distinctive chord pattern that sets up the mixture of brightness and melancholy found in its chorus:\n\nIf we chase this feeling down whatever road it leads us\n\nWe’ll never have regrets about a chance we didn’t take\n\nBut if we’re just pretending this might be a happy ending someday\n\nI’ll still hang around for the heartbreak\n\n“This song was sent to us from my good friend, Barry Hutchens, who has been writing some material with his son, Will, and Jerry Salley,” says Shelor. “I call it a ‘Happy Heartbreak’ song. It’s a great perspective put together by Barry, Will, and Jerry. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do!“"
