        "text": "JASON ALEXANDER: Kristin, are you okay cause you've been a little stand-off-ish for this whole session\n\nKRISTIN CHENOWETH: Yea, Jason, I'm fine...\n\nJASON: Okay\n\nKRISTIN: ...I just keep hearing things about you and those other women.\n\nJASON: Oh, you mean the other albums that I'm gonna do?\n\nKRISTIN: Yea.\n\nJASON: Well those are just friends of mine.\n\nKRISTIN: Yeah, well that's not what I heard. Ya know, I thought I was special.\n\nJASON: Well you are, but I mean it's Beth and Barbra...\n\nKRISTIN: ...and Whoopi? Jason, she's not exactly known for her singing.\n\nJASON: Yeah, it's kind of a rap thing.\n\nKRISTIN: Jason, you've got to learn to take this relationship seriously!\n\nJASON: Huh.\n\nKRISTIN: Once, you would hang around me\n\nHang, 'round me night and day\n\nI thought that love had found me\n\nWhen we became that way (JASON: Well, sure.)\n\nNow, it's a different story\n\nYou're not a one-girl man\n\nI've heard you're in your glory\n\nPlaying the Dapper Dan (JASON: Well I am a natural at that...)\n\nYou may tell me you're a Saint\n\nBut listen to my complaint\n\nWhat's the use of hangin' around with you? (JASON: What?)\n\nHangin' around with you\n\nHangin' around with you, deary?\n\nI never know\n\nI never know just where I stand\n\nWhat's the use of bangin' around with you? (JASON: Huh?)\n\nBangin' around with you\n\nBangin' around with you, deary?\n\nYou've gotta give\n\nThis little girl a bigger hand (JASON: I have given you e-)\n\nYou're not acting the beau\n\nThat I once used to know (JASON: Well I feel a little pressure here!)\n\nI'm beginning to see\n\nThat I'm likely to be\n\nOn the shelf\n\nIf you want me hangin' around with you (JASON: Hey!)\n\nHangin' around with you\n\nHangin' around with you, deary\n\nYou've gotta learn\n\nYou've gotta learn to be yourself (JASON: Oh hoho, no, no, no, no, no...)\n\nJASON: I simply must deny it\n\nI swear it isn't true\n\nMy heart is on a diet\n\nDarling, except for you (KRISTIN: That's not what I heard!)\n\nWhen I'm with other damsels\n\nReally, I don't go far (KRISTIN: Yea?)\n\nI try to tell those ma'm'selles\n\nJust what a peach you are (KRISTIN: They think I'm a peach?)\n\nOh I'm so misunderstood\n\nThough I've tried to be so good\n\nAh, what's the use of hangin' around with you? (KRISTIN: Huh?)\n\nHangin' around with you\n\nHangin' around with you, deary?\n\nI never know\n\nI never know just where I'm at\n\nAnd what's the use of bangin' around with you? (KRISTIN: Well!)\n\nBangin' around with you\n\nBangin' around with you, deary?\n\nOh I'm afraid\n\nYou're forcing me to leave you flat (KRISTIN: flat)\n\nOh boy...\n\nKRISTIN: Please don't be in a huff (JASON: Hey!)\n\nIt was only a bluff (JASON: Don't you think this is getting kinda complicated?)\n\nEverything is in vain\n\nIf you mean to remain so upstage\n\nIf you want me hangin' around with you\n\nBOTH: Hangin' around with you\n\nHangin' around with you, deary\n\nKRISTIN: You've gotta learn\n\nYou've gotta learn to act-\n\nYour agent called\n\nYour other gigs fell through\n\nJASON: I love this album\n\nBOTH: You've gotta learn\n\nYou've gotta learn to act your age\n\nWriter(s): George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
