It's not a very good song by any means for ADTR overall material. Decent enough that I was willing to give it another listen, but the \"ba ba ba ba\" parts are unnecessary filler.\n\nrainie\n\n8x Platinum Member\n\nbut its not real, and you don't exist\n\nJoined: February 2016\n\nPosts: 8,698\n\nPronouns: they / them\n\nPost by rainie on\n\ni hope this can peter at the very bottom of the charts for a while so we can see a re-entry by re-entry\n\nDaryl the Beryl\n\nDiamond Member\n\nThe AAA Expert\n\nFlying over the Ocean\n\nJoined: December 2014\n\nPosts: 62,542\n\nMy Reviews\n\nMy Charts\n\nPronouns: he/him\n\nPost by Daryl the Beryl on\n\nTop 50 on Alternative:\n\n207 48 A DAY TO REMEMBER Re-Entry f/Mark Hoppus 132 9 123 0.161\n\nDaryl the Beryl\n\nDiamond Member\n\nThe AAA Expert\n\nFlying over the Ocean\n\nJoined: December 2014\n\nPosts: 62,542\n\nMy Reviews\n\nMy Charts\n\nPronouns: he/him\n\nPost by Daryl the Beryl on\n\nTop 50 on Active:\n\n99 50 A DAY TO REMEMBER Re-Entry f/Mark Hoppus 76 8 68 0.04\n\nDaryl the Beryl\n\nDiamond Member\n\nThe AAA Expert\n\nFlying over the Ocean\n\nJoined: December 2014\n\nPosts: 62,542\n\nMy Reviews\n\nMy Charts\n\nPronouns: he/him\n\nPost by Daryl the Beryl on\n\nTop 40 on Active:\n\n48 39 A DAY TO REMEMBER Re-Entry f/Mark Hoppus 156 76 80 0.129\n\nDaryl the Beryl\n\nDiamond Member\n\nThe AAA Expert\n\nFlying over the Ocean\n\nJoined: December 2014\n\nPosts: 62,542\n\nMy Reviews\n\nMy Charts\n\nPronouns: he/him\n\nPost by Daryl the Beryl on\n\nTop 30 on Alternative:\n\n39 30 A DAY TO REMEMBER Re-Entry f/Mark Hoppus 422 279 143 0.427\n\nDaryl the Beryl\n\nDiamond Member\n\nThe AAA Expert\n\nFlying over the Ocean\n\nJoined: December 2014\n\nPosts: 62,542\n\nMy Reviews\n\nMy Charts\n\nPronouns: he/him\n\nPost by Daryl the Beryl on\n\nTop 30 on Active:\n\n34 29 A DAY TO REMEMBER Re-Entry f/Mark Hoppus 301 245 56 0.238\n\nDaryl the Beryl\n\nDiamond Member\n\nThe AAA Expert\n\nFlying over the Ocean\n\nJoined: December 2014\n\nPosts: 62,542\n\nMy Reviews\n\nMy Charts\n\nPronouns: he/him\n\nPost by Daryl the Beryl on\n\nTop 20 on Active:\n\n24 20 A DAY TO REMEMBER Re-Entry f/Mark Hoppus 497 408 89 0.536\n\nDoc Indie Party Rock\n\nDiamond Member\n\nCeltic Metal is on FIRE!\n\nJoined: June 2014\n\nPosts: 27,919\n\nMy Charts\n\nPost by Doc Indie Party Rock on\n\nKind of digging this one since I have been regularly previewing it for the chart v.s. chart v.s. chart games.\n\ncrash46\n\n7x Platinum Member\n\nInspired Mediasource\n\nOnes who does not have Triforce can't go in.\n\nJoined: November 2005\n\nPosts: 7,224\n\nPost by crash46 on\n\nI was so stoked to see some ADTR back on the alternative chart but this sounds so much more like vintage Mark Hoppus than vintage ADTR. And that’s not a terrible thing at all but with all the blink guys having their fingerprints all over everything lately I’d probably prefer that to have been the opposite here."
