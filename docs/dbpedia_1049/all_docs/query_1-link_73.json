        "text": "It’s been four albums, and Counting Crows frontman Adam Duritz\n\nhasn’t gotten much sleep. His band’s new effort, Hard\n\nCandy, haunts old grooves and revisits familiar themes of\n\nsquandered love, angels who won’t return phone calls and lead\n\nsingers who won’t go to bed. Produced largely by Steve Lillywhite,\n\nHard Candy is also crammed with guest stars, from Sheryl\n\nCrow and Matthew Sweet to Ryan Adams and his sweetheart, Leona\n\nNaess.\n\nFrom the Crows’ tour bus, Duritz talks about the new set, songs\n\nabout old girlfriends, his new fitness regimen and\n\nRiverdance, which his band mates happen to be watching, to\n\nhis mock-horror. “I can’t tell if they’re having an ironic hour or\n\nnot,” he says.\n\nIs there significance to the title Hard\n\nCandy?\n\nThe album is thematically about memories — the way you use them\n\nto substitute for living sometimes. Some memories are sweet, but\n\ntough and painful too. And they’re not good for you.\n\nThere’s also a candy-coating to some of the songs.\n\n“Butterfly in Reverse” has an almost Burt Bacharach feel. Do you\n\nsee this as a new direction for the band?\n\nWe’re always playing around with stuff. I don’t know what new or\n\nold is for us. Whatever we feel like doing is what a Counting Crows\n\nsong sounds like. I agree that “Butterfly” sounds different than\n\nour other stuff. We made an effort on this album to really finish\n\nsongs. Once we’re done getting a good band performance, we work on\n\nall the colors, harmonies, horns, strings, banjo — whatever the\n\nextra colors are gonna be.\n\nYou recorded this album in a house in L.A., which you’ve\n\ndone in the past. How does that differ from being in a\n\nstudio?\n\nWe’ve never done a record in a studio. I hate\n\nstudios. Studios are really claustrophobic to me. I hate the whole\n\nvibe, sitting in some bland lounge when you’re not working . . . T\n\nBone [Burnett] used to say that recording studios reek of despair\n\nand stink of other people’s bad records.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nWhat did Steve Lillywhite bring to the\n\nrecord?\n\nI have no idea what Steve does, but I can tell you he’s really\n\nfucking great at it. There’s a reason why he’s been producing\n\nrecords for twenty-five years now. The best producers just bring a\n\ncertain atmosphere to the studio. They create a vibe where it seems\n\nmagical, and it seems like you’re making this very special thing\n\nthat’s classic and timeless. It was a cool feeling knowing I was\n\nworking with this guy who’d done all these records that I loved:\n\nU2, the La’s, Joan Armatrading . . . we counted them one day, and I\n\nhave forty Steve Lillywhite records.\n\nIs there a story behind “If I Could Give All My Love\n\n(Richard Manuel Is Dead)?”\n\nThat’s about this time I was out all night with my friends and\n\nthis girl I was seeing, getting wasted. I came home drunk around\n\nsix in the morning with this girl, and I grabbed a newspaper, and\n\nbefore we went to bed I was flipping through it and saw that [The\n\nBand’s] Richard Manuel had died. He hung himself the night before,\n\nin Florida. And it just had this striking effect on me, you know,\n\nthe utter impermanence of things. I really got the sense that you\n\ncan’t afford to go on forever just playing footsie in your life,\n\ndipping your toes in, because your life will pass you by. Here was\n\nthis person that’d meant a lot to me that was gone, and I suddenly\n\nthought about the girl I was with, “God, she’ll be gone soon, or I\n\nwill. I’m not doing anything lasting in my life, nothing that I’m\n\ndoing is gonna be around five minutes from now.” In a sense,\n\nwriting songs, you’re making meaningful, permanent memories, so\n\nthat things that come and go out of your life don’t just fade. The\n\npeople in the songs understand that however transitory things were,\n\nthey meant something to me. Anna knows. Elizabeth knows.\n\nWas the Band a big influence for you?\n\nWe were signed maybe three or four months after we got together\n\nas a band, and I was really concerned that we weren’t sure who we\n\nwere. The thing about the Band is that they clearly listened to\n\neach other when they played and were responsive to each other, and\n\nI wanted to get to that place. So with the first album we made a\n\npoint of no more fretless bass for Matt. For Charlie, just Hammond\n\nB3 and piano. Get rid of all the effects on the guitars. We got\n\ninto a circle where we could see each other and just played. We\n\nlearned to play together by listening. We got that from the Band. I\n\ndon’t know if there’s ever been a group with that many great\n\nsingers, and I almost think Richard Manuel was the best of them\n\nall. He’s just an achingly heartbreaking singer.\n\nRelated\n\nLet’s talk about the collaborations on this album. How\n\ndid Ryan Adams get involved?\n\n“Butterfly in Reverse” was a song that I had been working on. I\n\nhad the music for the verse and the chorus and the lyrics to the\n\nchorus, but we couldn’t figure out how to get into the bridge and\n\nout of the song. And one day Ryan stopped by to say hi, and he\n\nfigured out the rising part that goes into the bridge and out of\n\nthe song. And then we started talking about the lyrics, and I was\n\nstuck. We ended up brainstorming and doing the whole song like\n\nthat. It all started with a mistake too. I had a line that went\n\n“Had a lot of girlfriends/I should’ve known then,” and he said,\n\n“What a great line, ‘I should’ve known them.'” I was like “Oh, I\n\ndidn’t say that, I said ‘I should’ve known then,'” and he was like\n\n“‘You should’ve known then’ what?” I’m like, “I dunno.” He said,\n\n“Well let’s use mine then, ’cause that’s stupid.” We just went line\n\nfor line then, trading lines through the whole song. It took us\n\nfifteen minutes. And I wanted him to sing it with me because we\n\nwrote it together.\n\nWho’s idea was it to bring Sheryl Crow in?\n\nAt one point we were having a lot of problems with “American\n\nGirls.” Something was wrong with it and we couldn’t figure out\n\nwhat. Somehow the chorus sounded too anthemic, and it wants to be\n\nrelaxed, sort of sexy and breezy. So Jimmy Iovine said, “Why don’t\n\nyou call Sheryl and have her try to sing on it.” I’m sorry, that\n\ngirl is the most accomplished background singer I’ve ever seen. I\n\ncalled her up and said, “Can you come over and try this?” She\n\nlistened to it, liked it, put the headphones on, sang the harmony,\n\nnote-perfect, doubled it, note-perfect and moved on to the next\n\nsection. She did the entire song in an hour. That could have taken\n\nall day with somebody else. Backup singing is a totally different\n\nart. The kind of shit Sheryl did, I can’t do that.\n\nBut you’re kind of famous for that stuff, like your\n\nbackup vocals on the Wallflower’s “Sixth Avenue\n\nHeartache.”\n\nAll of those were kind of like things I just fell into. I had a\n\nbeer, sang on the song and left. It took about an hour. Most of my\n\nstuff has been like that. Like, I knew Jake [Jakob Dylan], I knew T\n\nBone, so I came down. They weren’t like, “Let’s get a collaboration\n\nwith Adam on the record.” They were just in trouble and needed\n\nsomeone to sing, so I came down. Sometimes I think collaborations\n\nare just a big circus just for the promotional aspect of them; it\n\nkind of bores me. I’m not really a good collaborator either — it’s\n\na lot of pressure. With Ryan, it just sort of happened. I became\n\nfriends with him, so I ended up on his record a bunch of times. I’d\n\njust rather do it that way. The only time I’ve ever been set up to\n\ndo something was on the Nancy Griffith record. But it was because\n\nher A&R guy knew I was a huge fan, and they needed someone to\n\ndo a duet. It was a really a dream for me.\n\nSo you don’t have any dream collaboration\n\nnow?\n\nNo. The idea of collaborating just turns me off, to be honest\n\nwith you. But I’ll do them when they happen if it’s spur of the\n\nmoment, and it feels right. If you’re around when we’re playing a\n\nconcert, and you’re a friend of mine, by all means, get the fuck up\n\non stage, come sing “Hangin’ Around” with us.\n\nJimmy Fallon does a pretty good impersonation of you . .\n\n.\n\nIt’s embarrassing. I always threaten to beat him up. I met Jimmy\n\nyears ago. We were in a bar, and Jimmy came over. He let it slip\n\nout that he did this impersonation of me, and I was like, “Shut\n\nup!” He said, “Yeah, I play guitar, do some songs, funny stuff.” I\n\nsaid “Well, we’ve got a gig tomorrow night at fucking Hammerstein\n\nBallroom, Mr. Funny Guy, why don’t you come down and play, see if\n\nyou can do it in front of a whole house of Counting Crows fans.” So\n\nhe came down and went on right before we did. I introduced him, and\n\nhe came out on stage and embarrassed the fuck out of me. It’s such\n\na horrific impersonation of me. But imitation is a form of\n\nflattery.\n\nEach one of your albums mentions insomnia. Shouldn’t you\n\nsee a doctor about that?\n\nI’m doing better right now. Sometimes at the end of the day, I\n\njust can’t believe that’s all there is. Is that as good as it’s\n\ngonna get today? So I’ll stay awake and watch TV and read books and\n\nkeep spooling time out as if something was gonna come along at 4 or\n\n5 or 6 in the morning, and there ain’t nothing coming. But you have\n\nto practice a certain discipline to make yourself go to sleep when\n\nyou’re that way. But, yeah, I’m going to bed at a pretty reasonable\n\nhour these days, waking up at seven or eight in the morning,\n\nworking out. I’ve been boxing a lot, which I’ve been doing for\n\nabout a year, so I have to be up to do that. It started off that I\n\nwanted to get in shape, and there’s different ways to do it, like\n\nrunning, biking, but that shit bores me. I’d rather shoot myself\n\nthan do something tedious like that. Plus, when you’re in my\n\nsituation, it’s good to take care of yourself. I’m not utterly\n\nunprepared to defend myself anymore. Also, I was an athlete as a\n\nkid, and I got really far away from that. When I got to college,\n\nafter all those years of athletics, I felt, “I am so tired of\n\nrunning around. I want to get high, get drunk, so I stopped all\n\nthat shit.” So then there were years of just drinking and smoking.\n\nI’d always been in good shape, but in the last ten years I found\n\nmyself in less and less good shape, and I didn’t want to be that\n\nway. I wanted to be like a “rock star” rock star.\n\nTrending\n\nYou once said you couldn’t understand what people get\n\nout of the pain in your music. Now that you’ve been doing it for a\n\nwhile, do you have a theory on that now?"
