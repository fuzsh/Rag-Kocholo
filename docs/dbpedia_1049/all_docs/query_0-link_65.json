        "text": "Emergency Preparedness\n\nIt is the policy of the University of Wisconsin – Milwaukee to immediately notify the campus community upon confirmation of a significant emergency or dangerous situation involving an immediate threat to the health or safety of students, employees or visitors on campus. Visit the Campus Safety web page for up-to-date information on campus health and safety issues and how to register for emergency alerts.\n\nDial 9-911 from any campus phone or 414-229-9911 from a cellphone for First Response to all Emergencies at the UWM Campus\n\nEmergency Contacts\n\nEmergency Contacts\n\nEmergency Medical, Fire, Life Threatening Situations Dial 9-911 from any campus phone\n\nDial 414-229-9911 from a cell phone University Police Department\n\n(Non-Emergency) 414-229-4627 Student Health and Wellness Center 414-229-4716 University Safety & Assurances 414-229-6339 Facility Services\n\nBuilding Emergency Services 414-229-4742 (day)\n\n414-229-4652 (evening) Dean of Students 414-229-4632 UWM Emergency Alerts Program\n\nUWM Emergency Alert Program, also known as “Rave Alerts,” provide students, faculty, and staff with notifications via SMS text message and/or email in the event of a campus emergency. Please visit the UWM Emergency Alerts Program for more about this program.\n\nHow to Request Assistance When Calling From a Cell Phone\n\nDial 414-229-9911\n\nYou will be connected with the UWM University Police Dispatcher\n\nProvide information on your exact location and the nature of the emergency\n\nRemain on the phone until the dispatcher has all necessary information\n\nUniversity Police will respond accordingly\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nOSHA’s Emergency Preparedness and Response Page\n\nWisconsin Emergency Management\n\nIssues of Concern for Schools Related to Biological/Chemical Agents\n\nWisconsin Homeland Security\n\nActive Shooter\n\nThe University Police Department is staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and has an authorized strength of 33 full-time sworn police officers. Support personnel include dispatchers, clericals and security officers. The University Police are trained and equipped to respond to campus active shooter incidents.\n\nIf Building Exit is Possible:\n\nIf you are in a building with an active shooter and it is possible to do so safely, exit the building immediately when you become aware of an incident, moving away from the immediate path of danger and take the following steps:\n\nNotify anyone you may encounter to exit the building immediately\n\nEvacuate to a safe area away from the danger and take protective cover. Stay there until assistance arrives.\n\nCall x9911 from a UWM land-line phone or 414-229-9911 from a cell phone to reach the University Police. Provide the dispatcher with the following information:\n\nYour name\n\nLocation of the incident (be as specific as possible)\n\nYour exact location\n\nNumber of shooters (if known)\n\nIdentification and description of shooter(s)\n\nNumber of persons who may be involved\n\nInjuries to anyone (if known)\n\nAdvise of number and type of weapons (if known)\n\nIndividuals not immediately impacted by the situation are to take protective cover, staying away from windows and doors until notified otherwise.\n\nIf Building Exit is Not Possible — “Shelter in Place”:\n\nIf you are in a building with an active shooter and exiting the building is not possible, the following actions are recommended:\n\nGo to the nearest room or office\n\nClose and lock or barricade the door with a desk or heavy object\n\nTurn off the lights\n\nSeek protective cover\n\nKeep quiet and act as if no one is in the room\n\nDo not answer the door\n\nCall x9911 from a UWM land-line phone or 414-229-9911 from a cell phone to reach the University Police if it is safe to do so. Provide the dispatcher with the following information\n\nYour name\n\nYour location in the building (be as specific as possible)\n\nNumber of shooters (if known)\n\nIdentification or description of shooter(s)\n\nNumber of persons who may be involved\n\nInjuries to anyone (if known)\n\nAdvise of number and type of weapons (if known)\n\nWait for police or security to assist you out of the building- follow their instructions\n\nAirborne Chemical or Biological Release\n\nSome kinds of chemical accidents or attacks may make going outdoors dangerous. Leaving the area might take too long or put you in harm’s way. In such a case it may be safer for you to stay indoors than to go outside.\n\n“Shelter in Place” means to make a shelter out of the place you are in. It is a way for you to make the building as safe as possible to protect yourself until help arrives. You should not try to shelter in a vehicle unless you have no other choice. Vehicles are not airtight enough to give you adequate protection from chemicals.\n\nStep 1: Notification from Police\n\nIn the event of a chemical or biological release that would require protective actions be taken by campus residents, the University Police would be notified by the city/county of the incident.\n\nA variety of notification methods will be used to inform all UWM employees of the protective action alert.\n\nThose university buildings that are equipped with voice public address systems will use them to notify occupants of any imminent danger, and give direction on what to do.\n\nDO NOT PANIC.\n\nStep 2: Close Doors and Windows\n\nDo not exit the building.\n\nIf possible move to interior, windowless room on an upper floor.\n\nClose all doors to the outside and lock all windows.\n\nWet towels or other fabric items and jam them in the crack under the door. Use plastic (trash bags are good) to cover all windows and doors. Use tape to seal the edges of plastic.\n\nStep 3: Seal off Ventilation Sources\n\nTurn off fume hoods, range hoods, air handlers, and all air conditioners. Switch inlets to the “closed” position.\n\nSeal off all vents, grills, or other openings to the outside to the extent possible.\n\nMinimize the use of the elevators in the building. These tend to “pump” outdoor air in and out of a building as they travel up and down.\n\nIf you become bothered by the gaseous release hold a wet cloth or handkerchief over your nose and mouth.\n\nIf you experience breathing difficulties contact the University Police (x9-911 from any hard-wired campus phone or 414-229-9911 from a cellphone) and request immediate medical assistance.\n\nStep 4: Remain Indoors\n\nMonitor the local media for further information and guidance.\n\nDo not evacuate the building unless told to do so by University Police or the Milwaukee Fire Department.\n\nAutomated External Defibrillator (AED)\n\nSudden cardiac arrest is one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. Over 350,000 people will suffer from sudden cardiac arrest this year. It can happen to anyone, anytime, anywhere and at any age. An Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is the only effective treatment for restoring a regular heart rhythm during sudden cardiac arrest and is an easy to operate tool for someone with no medical background.\n\nThe majority of AEDs are located at the first floor elevator lobbies of each UWM building. Consult emergency evacuation maps for exact location.\n\nAED training is available from UWM Police at https://uwm.edu/police/safety-training/.\n\nBomb Threats\n\nBomb threats are usually conveyed via telephone and generally made by individuals who want to create an atmosphere of general anxiety or panic. All bomb threats should be assumed to pose a legitimate danger to the UW-Milwaukee campus population.\n\nIf you receive a bomb threat by telephone:\n\nTake the caller seriously, but remain calm.\n\nAsk a lot of questions. Use the checklist below as a guide.\n\nTake notes on everything said and on your observations about background noise, voice characteristics, etc.\n\nIf possible, get a co-worker to call the University Police emergency phone line (Dial 9-911 from any campus phone or 414-229-9911 from a cellphone) while you continue talking to the caller.\n\nCall the University Police emergency phone number at 9-911 from any campus phone or 414-229-9911 from a cellphone immediately after the call.\n\nNotify your supervisor/department head.\n\nUniversity Police will be dispatched to your area to investigate and evaluate the threat. University Police will provide detailed instructions upon arrival.\n\nQuestions to Ask:\n\nWhen is bomb going to explode?\n\nWhere is it right now?\n\nWhat does it look like?\n\nWhat kind of bomb is it?\n\nWhat will cause it to explode?\n\nDid you place the bomb?\n\nWhy?\n\nWhat is your name?\n\nWhat is your address?\n\nTry to recall the exact wording of the threat\n\nCharacteristics of Caller’s Voice:\n\nCalm\n\nStutter\n\nLaughter\n\nAccent\n\nRagged\n\nNasal\n\nExcited\n\nNormal\n\nSlurred\n\nCracked Voice\n\nSlow\n\nRapid\n\nDistinguished\n\nLisp\n\nFamiliar\n\nRaspy\n\nDeep\n\nDistinct\n\nLoud\n\nSoft\n\nDeep Breathing\n\nAngry\n\nClearing Throat\n\nCrying\n\nIf voice is familiar, who did it sound like?\n\nWhat was the sex of the caller?\n\nCan you estimate an approximate age of the caller?\n\nMake a note of the date the call was received.\n\nRecord the number at which the call was received and the time of the call.\n\nMake a note of the approximate length of the phone call.\n\nBackground Sounds:\n\nStreet Noises\n\nMusic\n\nFactory Machinery\n\nLong Distance\n\nAnimal Noises\n\nHouse\n\nVoices\n\nNoises\n\nPA System\n\nBooth\n\nStatic\n\nMotor\n\nLocal\n\nOffice Machine\n\nOther\n\nThreat Language:\n\nWell-Spoken\n\nIrrational\n\nIncoherent\n\nMessage Read by Caller\n\nMessage Taped\n\nFoul Language\n\nReceipt of Suspicious Package/Bomb\n\nBombs can be constructed to look like almost anything and can be placed or delivered in any number of ways. The probability of finding a bomb that looks like the stereotypical bomb is almost nonexistent. The only common denominator that exists among bombs is that they are designed or intended to explode.\n\nMost bombs are homemade and are limited in their design only by the imagination of, and resources available to, the bomber. If you receive or discover a suspicious package or foreign device:\n\nDo not, under any circumstances, touch it, tamper with it or move it!\n\nReport it immediately to University Police by calling 9-911 (or 414-229-9911 from a cell phone)\n\nChemical Spill Response\n\nHave a spill kit available to clean up minor spills. That kit should include:\n\nInstructions and/or Material Safety Data Sheets for the chemical in use\n\nPersonal protective equipment including gloves, safety goggles and other protective clothing\n\nSpill pads or pillows sufficient to contain and absorb 1 liter of liquid\n\nPlastic bags or containers to place spill waste material\n\nDo NOT attempt to clean up a spill if any of the following conditions apply:\n\nMore than one chemical has spilled;\n\nThe quantity spilled is greater than one liter;\n\nThe substance is unknown or you are uncertain of the hazards of the substance; or\n\nYou are uncomfortable in the situation.\n\nMinor Spill Response\n\n(Less than 8 oz. of a Known Material)\n\nMinor spills may be controlled and cleaned up by employees who work with the substance and understand the hazards of the material following these steps:\n\nAlert people in the immediate area of the spill;\n\nWear protective equipment, including safety goggles, gloves and a long-sleeved shirt or other protective clothing;\n\nIf spilled material is flammable, turn off ignition and heat sources.\n\nAvoid breathing vapors from the spill;\n\nApply spill pillow/pads or other absorbent material, first around the outside of the spill, encircling the material, then absorb to the center of the spill;\n\nSweep/shovel up absorbent material and place into a sealed, leak-proof bag or container;\n\nDispose of all materials (gloves, brooms, paper towels) used to clean up the spill in a sealed container as well; and\n\nLabel and dispose of all bags or containers as hazardous waste. Contact University Safety and Assurances (hazwaste@uwm.edu) for a hazardous waste collection.\n\nPrint this spill kit and chemical-specific guidance to keep with your spill kit.\n\nMajor Spill Response\n\n(More than 8 oz. or Unknown Material)\n\nAttend to injured or contaminated persons and remove them from exposure as practical.\n\nAlert other persons in the area to evacuate. Close the doors to the affected area.\n\nContact the University Police for assistance:\n\nFrom any hard-wired campus phone dial 9-911.\n\nFrom a cell phone, dial 414-229-9911. You will be connected to a UWM Police Department Dispatcher.\n\nFrom a pay phone, no coin is needed, dial 911.\n\nGive your name, information on the material spilled (name, quantity, etc) and the exact location of the spill (room, floor, etc.). Be sure to stay on the phone until released by the emergency operator.\n\nReport to the building entrance to provide information to and/or assist emergency personnel.\n\nOther Situations\n\nChemical spill on body:\n\nRemove all contaminated clothing\n\nFlood exposed area with running water from a faucet or safety shower for at least 15 minutes\n\nHave another individual contact the University Police: 9-911 from any hard-wired campus phone or 414-229-9911 from a cell phone, to obtain medical attention\n\nReport the incident to your supervisor or instructor and University Safety and Assurances\n\nChemical Splashed in Eye:\n\nImmediately rinse eyeball and inner surface of eyelid with water continuously for 15 minutes. Forcibly hold eye lid(s) open to ensure effective wash behind eyelids\n\nHave another individual contact the University Police at x9-911 from any campus hard-wired phone, or 414-229-9911 from a cell phone to obtain medical attention\n\nReport the incident to your supervisor or instructor and University Safety and Assurances\n\nContinuity of Operations Plan\n\nUWM depends on certain functions such as building operations, financial transactions, communications and information systems applications and infrastructure to conduct its business. Accordingly, UWM departments shall develop comprehensive contingency plans (Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP)) to support mission critical functions.\n\nThe responsibility for continuity of a function at UWM, in the absence of a critical resource, rests with the user of the resource. Responsibility for the recovery of the resource rests with the provider. As a result, providers and users of mission critical functions at UWM are expected to have a COOP. This plan will identify high likelihood and high impact risks so that specific actions steps can be developed to ensure readiness, response, recovery and restoration. All plans will be periodically tested, reviewed and updated.\n\nA COOP template and guidance is available to help departments in drafting their Business Continuity Plan from UWM Police Department. Contact UWM Police at https://uwm.edu/police/non-emergency/.\n\nDisease Outbreak\n\nFollow campus pandemic plan for disease outbreak preparedness procedures.\n\nInformation regarding coronavirus (COVID-19) https://uwm.edu/coronavirus/.\n\nEarthquake\n\nStep 1: Stay Indoors\n\nStay indoors during tremors.\n\nTake cover under tables or desks, or go to a structurally strong location such as a hall by a pillar.\n\nDo not go outside.\n\nWatch for falling objects such as light fixtures, bookcases, cabinets, shelves and other furniture that might move or topple.\n\nStay away from windows.\n\nStep 2: Drop, Cover, Hold\n\nDrop to the floor.\n\nCover your head with your arms.\n\nHold that position\n\nStep 3: Remain in Place Until Shaking Stops\n\nDo not dash for exits since they may be damaged and the building’s exterior brick, tile or decorations may be falling off.\n\nWhen the shaking stops, check for injuries to personnel in your area. Render First Aid assistance if required.\n\nCheck for fires or fire hazards — spills of flammable or combustible liquids, or leaks of flammable gases.\n\nTurn off ignition and heat sources if it is safe to do so. Shut off all gas sources.\n\nStep 4: Assess Damage and Exit Building\n\nFollow procedures for fire, hazardous incidents and serious injury as necessary.\n\nExit the building, if possible, and go to a predetermined assembly point to report injuries, damages and potentially hazardous conditions\n\nCall the University Police (Dial x9-911 from any hard-wired campus phone or 414-229-9911 from a cellphone) or send a runner to the Campus Police Station (Sandburg W140) to notify them of any needed assistance and emergencies that may exist.\n\nOnce you have exited the building, do not reenter until the building has been declared safe by trained emergency personnel.\n\nElectrical Failures\n\nBefore a Power Outage:\n\nPrepare or review existing internal communications plan to notify affected personnel about workday and after-hours emergencies\n\nIdentify and prioritize vital power-dependent functions, operations, and equipment. Plan ahead for short-term and longer-term impacts and needs.\n\nBattery-powered flashlights should be kept at known locations, readily accessible during outages. Candles and other open flame devices are prohibited.\n\nKeep duplicates of critical data.\n\nDetermine if there are emergency power outlets (red) in your area. Use them for critical functions only.\n\nDetermine if there is emergency lighting in your area. Keep flashlights in all work areas.\n\nDevelop strategies for resuming operations when power returns.\n\nShort-Term Power Outage:\n\nAssess the extent of the outage in your area. Report outages to your Building Chairperson and/or Facility Services at 414-229-4742. If after hours contact Facility Services at 414-229-4652 or University Police at 9-911 from any campus phone or 414-229-9911 from a cellphone.\n\nBuilding chairpersons may make the decision to evacuate individual buildings. If you are told to leave the building, lock or secure your area, collect your personal belongings and leave. Reenter the building only when directed to do so by the Building Chair or the UWM Police.\n\nIf evacuation of the building is not necessary, restrict movement to areas that are adequately illuminated.\n\nReport any losses or equipment damage to Risk Management at 414-750-4699 or 414-229-6339 as soon as possible.\n\nResponse to Prolonged Power Outage:\n\nBuilding chairpersons should check their buildings elevators and initiate rescue efforts by notifying the University Police, if necessary. Only trained rescue personnel shall assist persons stranded in elevators.\n\nBuilding chairs should notify the University Police (414-229-4627) and Facility Services (414-229-4742) to facilitate assistance and repair as necessary.\n\nMove building occupants in darkened work areas to safe locations. Keep refrigerators and freezers closed throughout the outage.\n\nUnplug personal computers.\n\nUnplug non-essential electrical equipment and appliances.\n\nOpen windows for additional light and ventilation, if appropriate.\n\nThe Crisis Management Team will make any decisions to cancel classes.\n\nReport any losses or equipment damage to Risk Management at 414-750-4699 as soon as possible.\n\nAfter Power Outage:\n\nAfter a power outage make sure that all power is restored before turning on any equipment.\n\nFacility Services will ensure that all elevators are reset as well as security systems reactivated and other alarms are reset.\n\nElevator Malfunction\n\nIn case of an elevator malfunction, contact the University Police at 9-911 on a campus phone or at 414-229-9911 on a cell phone. The police will send an officer to the scene and will contact Facility Services for assistance. To ensure the safety of all, only trained elevator technicians should perform repairs to elevators or attempt to rescue any trapped passengers. UWM elevator technicians can generally respond to most elevator malfunctions within 20 minutes. If faster response is needed, University Police may contact the Milwaukee Fire Department.\n\nIn case someone is trapped in an elevator:\n\nStaff should attempt to locate the elevator car and communicate with passengers by any means available, including yelling through the closed shaft doorways if necessary. Ensure the passengers that they are safe in the car, ask them to remain calm and inform them that help is on the way.\n\nInsist that the passenger(s) remain in the car until an experienced elevator technician is called to the scene. Passengers should not attempt to use access panels for escape as the elevator may unexpectedly resume operation, which could cause serious injury or worse.\n\nCheck all floors to visually verify that all of the shaft doors are closed.\n\nIf a shaft door is found open, do not attempt to close it.\n\nKeep all others away from an open shaft door until an elevator technician arrives.\n\nIdentify the building and if the building contains multiple elevators, identify the specific elevator number or elevator location (if in a bank of elevators).\n\nLocate the floor position of the elevator.\n\nReport the status of the elevator:\n\nExample: “Enderis Hall, elevator #2, 5th floor, the doors are open, the elevator is 6″ above the floor” to the University Police. The Department of Facility Services Trouble Hotline may also be called at 414-229-4742 during regular business hours (7:00 A.M. – 4:30 P.M).\n\nEmergency Evacuation\n\nDuring certain emergency conditions, it may be necessary to evacuate a building. Examples of such occasions include: smoke/fire, gas leak, bomb threat or chemical spill.\n\nRoom specific “Classroom Emergency Procedures” are posted in all general assignment classrooms on campus. These signs provide information on how to contact emergency responders. They also include the specific building address and room number and list actions to follow in the event of any type of emergency occurring in the classroom — medical, fire, power outage or tornado warning. In larger classrooms (50 person capacity or greater), an emergency procedures card is available at the lectern. These procedures are especially important for students who move from building to building throughout the day and may not be familiar with evacuation routes and shelter areas for the various buildings in which they have classes.\n\nThe Department of University Safety and Assurances has also posted updated Emergency Evacuation Floor Plans in all of the campus buildings. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the evacuation plans for the building in which you work and those buildings you frequent. If you notice that your Emergency Evacuation Floor Plan is missing or if you need a “Classroom Emergency Procedures” sign, please contact University Safety and Assurances at 414-229-6339 so that we can replace a missing plan or print one for you. Evacuation Floor Plans can also be found on the Campus Planning web site. For security purposes, you will need to provide your Panther ID and password to view these plans\n\nIn addition, the Department of University Safety and Assurances asks that once occupants have exited, they should move at least 100 feet away from the building. Also, those evacuating should stay out of the way of responding emergency personnel vehicles, fire lanes, fire hydrants and equipment staging areas.\n\nIf there is a need for evacuation of your building, move calmly to the exits and remain at a distance until the “All Clear” has been given.\n\nAccording to UWS Chapter 18, Conduct on University Lands, section (g):\n\n“No person may remain in any university facility or on university lands when an audible or visual fire alarm has been activated or upon being notified by fire fighting, law enforcement or security personnel to evacuate.”\n\nPolice and fire personnel lives are at stake when people do not properly evacuate. Save your life and theirs by evacuating.\n\nEmergency Evacuation of People with Disabilities\n\nWhile an “emergency” by its very definition is an unforeseen event, it also usually requires immediate action. Developing an evacuation plan which addresses identifying exits, designates areas of refuge and assembly point (where all evacuees will meet once they have evacuate the building), and provides additional assistance to persons with disabilities gives everyone a plan of action which shortens their response time and enables them to help themselves and others. All persons at UWM, including those with disabilities, must prepare for emergencies ahead of time.\n\nAn evacuation plan must start with this basic premise: Everyone must try to evacuate to the nearest, safe exit. At least two emergency passageways must be identified in each building. Each passageway must either lead to an exit or safely lead to a designated area of refuge.\n\nAfter identifying the exits, a recommendation is that each person with a disability ask a co-worker, friend or fellow student to provide assistance if an emergency develops. This “evacuation assistant” should be informed about what disabilities you have and how he or she can best help you.\n\nPersons with disabilities have four basic evacuation options:\n\nHorizontal evacuation. This entails using building exits to gain access to outside ground level, or going into unaffected wings of multi-building complexes.\n\nStairway (vertical) evacuation. This means of evacuation means using stairwells to reach ground level exits from the building.\n\nStaying in Place. Unless danger is imminent, remaining in a room with an exterior window, a telephone and a solid or fire resistant door may be your best option. With this approach, the person may keep in contact with emergency services by dialing 9-911 and reporting his or her location directly to the University Police. The police will then immediately relay this location to on-site emergency personnel, who will determine the necessity for evacuation. Phone lines are expected to remain in service during most building emergencies. If the phone lines fail, the individual can signal from the window by waving a cloth or other visible object.NOTE: The Stay in Place approach may be more appropriate for sprinkler protected buildings, or buildings where an “area of refuge” is not nearby or available. It may also be more appropriate for an occupant who is alone when the alarm sounds. A label on the door jamb or frame can identify a fire resistant door. Non-labeled 1 ¾ inch thick solid core wood doors hung on a metal frame also offer good fire resistance.\n\nArea of Refuge. With an evacuation assistant, going to an area of refuge away from obvious danger is another emergency plan option. The evacuation assistant will then go to the building evacuation assembly point and notify the on-site emergency personnel of the location of the person with a disability. Emergency personnel will determine if further evacuation is necessary. The safest Areas of Refuge are stair enclosures common to high-rise buildings, and open-air exit balconies. Other possible Areas of Refuge include fire-rated corridors or vestibules adjacent to exit stairs and elevator lobbies. Many campus buildings feature fire rated corridor construction that may offer safe refuge.Taking a position in a rated corridor next to the stairs is a good alternative to a small stair landing crowded with the other building occupants using the stairways as a means of egress in an emergency.For false alarms or an isolated and contained fire, a person with a disability may not have to evacuate. The decision to evacuate will be made by the Milwaukee Fire Department (MFD). The MFD will tell the individual of their decision or relay the information via the University Police Department.\n\nSuggested Guidelines for Different Types of Disabilities\n\nMobility Impaired – Wheelchair\n\nPersons using wheelchairs should Stay in Place, or move to an Area of Refuge with their assistant when the alarm sounds. The evacuation assistant should then proceed to the evacuation assembly point outside the building and alert the Milwaukee Fire Department or University Police to the location of the person with a disability. If the person with a disability is alone, he or she should phone the University Police at 9-911 with their present location and the area of refuge they are headed to.\n\nNOTE: If the stair landing is chosen as the area of refuge, please note that many campus buildings have relatively small stair landings, and wheelchair users are advised to wait until the heavy traffic has passed before entering the stairway.\n\nStairway evacuation of wheelchair users should be conducted only by trained professionals or the Milwaukee Fire Department. Only in situations of extreme danger should untrained people attempt to evacuate wheelchair users.\n\nMobility Impaired – Non Wheelchair\n\nPersons with mobility impairments who are able to walk independently may be able to negotiate stairs in an emergency with minor assistance. If danger is imminent, the individual should wait until the heavy traffic has cleared before attempting the stairs. If there is no immediate danger (such as detectable smoke, fire or an unusual odor), the person with the disability may choose to stay in the building with the options listed above, until the emergency personnel arrive and determine if evacuation is necessary.\n\nDeaf/Hard of Hearing\n\nMost buildings on campus are equipped with fire alarm strobe lights; however, some are not. Persons with hearing loss may not hear audio emergency alarms and will need to be alerted of emergency situations. Emergency instructions can be given by writing a short explicit note to evacuate.\n\nReasonable accommodations for persons with hearing loss may be met by modifying the building fire alarm system, particularly for occupants who spend most of their day in one location. Persons requiring such accommodation should contact the UWM ADA Coordinator at 414-229-5419 (voice) or Teletypewriter (TTY) users, please use the relay service by dialing 711.\n\nVisually Impaired\n\nMost people with a visual impairment will be familiar with their immediate surroundings and frequently traveled routes. Since the emergency evacuation route is likely different from the commonly traveled route, persons who are visually impaired may need assistance in evacuating. The assistant should offer their elbow to the individual with a visual impairment and guide him or her through the evacuation route. During the evacuation, the assistant should communicate as necessary to assure safe evacuation.\n\nPrior planning and practicing of emergency evacuation routes are important in ensuring a safe evacuation.\n\nFor additional information contact UWM’s ADA Coordinator or the Accessibility Resource Center at 414-229-6287.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nFire Safety for Wheelchair Users at Work and at Home, United Spinal Association\n\nS.A.F.E.T.Y.first: Working Together for Safer Communities, Easter Seals\n\nPreparing for Disaster for People with Disabilities and other Special Needs, American Red Cross/FEMA\n\nExplosion\n\nIn the event of an explosion on campus, take the following actions:\n\nImmediately take cover under tables, desks, or under objects which will give protection against falling glass and debris.\n\nAfter the initial effects of the explosion have subsided, notify the University Police dispatcher at 9-911 from any campus phone or 414-229-9911 from a cell phone. Give your name, tell them if there is a fire and describe the location and nature of the emergency.\n\nActivate the building fire alarm.\n\nEvacuate the building by the nearest exit. If disabled personnel cannot safely evacuate the building, assist to the nearest stairwell away from damaged area. Alert emergency personnel of their location.\n\nDO NOT USE ELEVATORS. DO NOT PANIC.\n\nOnce outside, move to a clear area that is at least 500 feet away from the affected building. Keep streets and walkways clear for emergency vehicles and crews.\n\nDO NOT RETURN TO AN EVACUATED BUILDING unless authorized by the Milwaukee Fire Department or the University Police.\n\nFire Safety\n\nGo to Fire Safety web page.\n\nFloods\n\nFloods are the most common and widespread of all natural disasters – except fire. Most communities in the United States have experienced some kind of flooding, after spring rains, heavy thunderstorms, or winter snow thaws. Flooding within a building may also be the result of a mechanical failure.\n\nThe following are some steps you can take in response to a flood situation to minimize property damage and losses:\n\nIf the flooding is caused by a pipe break, sink overflow or other plumbing problem:\n\nDuring normal business hours, notify Facility Services at 414-229-4742. After hours contact Facility Services at 414-229-4652 or the University Police at 9-911 (emergency number) or 414-229-4627 (non-emergency phone number).\n\nTry to identify the source of the water and turn it off if this can be done safely.\n\nIf the flooding is caused by heavy rains or winter snow thaw:\n\nDuring normal business hours, notify Facility Services at 414-229-4742. If the situation occurs after hours, contact Facility Services at 414-229-4652 or University Police at 9-911 or 414-229-9911 from a cellphone.\n\nAttempt to close doors and windows to prevent additional water from entering the building, if possible.\n\nFocus resources on minimizing the spread of water into other areas of the building.\n\nAdditional actions you may take to minimize damage from water include:\n\nProtecting property and records by removing items from floors and /or covering items with water-resistant coverings.\n\nMoving items of value to “higher ground” if possible.\n\nUnplugging electrical equipment such as computers, printers, etc. if it is safe to do so. If electrical circuits appear to be getting wet, leave the area immediately.\n\nDepending upon the severity of the situation, evacuation of personnel may be required. If immediate evacuation is necessary, use the fire alarm system to notify building occupants.\n\nOnce the building has been evacuated, call the University Police (9-911), or 414-229-9911 from a cellphone, or send a runner to the Campus Police Station (Sandburg W140) to notify them of any needed assistance or other emergencies that may exist.\n\nReport any losses or equipment damage to Risk Management at 414-229-6339 as soon as possible.\n\nProperty Claims Checklist.\n\nGas Leak\n\nNatural gas is colorless, non-toxic and odorless, although an odorant is added as the gas is fed into the distribution system. Known as mercaptan, this odorant is an important safety measure because it provides a distinct smell (much like the smell of rotten eggs) in the event of a gas leak. Natural gas is lighter than air and rapidly dissipates into the air when it is released. If you smell gas or suspect a leak, cease all operations. Take appropriate actions to ensure your personal safety.\n\nIf gas smell is on the inside and windows can be easily opened, open to ventilate the area.\n\nLeave the area at once and pull the nearest fire alarm to initiate evacuation of the building.\n\nFrom any hard-wired campus phone dial 9-911.\n\nFrom a cell phone dial 414-229-9911. Your call will be connected to the UWM Police Department Dispatcher.\n\nFrom a pay phone (no coin is needed) dial 911.\n\nGive your name and the exact location of the leak (room, floor, etc.) as well as any other information you think would be useful. Be sure to stay on the phone until released by the emergency operator.\n\nIf the situation warrants, request that the fire department be called.\n\nEvacuate the building by the nearest exit. Report to the building entrance to inform emergency response personnel of the situation.\n\nBuilding Chairs and/or their designees will check occupied areas of their buildings and notify occupants that they must immediately evacuate the building by means of the nearest exit. Exit quickly and calmly by way of the nearest exit to a safe distance from the building. Leave sidewalks and roadways free for emergency responders.\n\nDO NOT USE ELEVATORS!\n\nEscort persons unable to negotiate stairs to area near emergency exit staircase. After the emergency exit is clear of traffic, move them onto the landing of the emergency stairwell. Do not attempt to move them down the stairs. A staff person should go to the building entrance to inform arriving emergency personnel where any such persons are waiting.\n\nDo not reenter the building until authorized to do so by University Police or the Milwaukee Fire Department.\n\nMedical Assistance and First Aid\n\nCall for Medical Assistance: 9-911 from any Campus Phone or 414-229-9911 from a Cell Phone\n\nIf serious injury or illness occurs on campus, immediately dial 9-911 from any campus phone or 414-229-9911 from a cell phone for medical assistance. Give your name, describe the nature and severity of the medical problem and the campus location of the victim. Do not hang up unless released by the emergency operator.\n\nIf the victim is conscious and oriented, the individual has the right to determine his/her own health care needs and the response to those needs. Under such circumstances, university staff should refrain from recommending specific health care vendors.\n\nIn circumstances involving a person who is unconscious and/or disoriented, calling the University Police is the appropriate response.\n\nKeep the victim still and comfortable until help arrives. Do not move the victim.\n\nIn case of a minor injury or illness, students may go to the Norris Health Center or have trained persons provide appropriate first aid.\n\nFirst Aid and CPR training is available through many agencies including the local American Red Cross.\n\nPersons with serious or unusual medical problems should be encouraged to notify their supervisors or instructors of the medical problem and the standard emergency treatment related to that problem.\n\nSuspicious Package\n\nAsk yourself the follow questions when screening articles received:\n\nIs the article unexpected or does it appear unfamiliar?\n\nIs the address vague or incomplete?\n\nIs the return address missing?\n\nDoes it have unusual weight or texture?\n\nAre there restrictive markings such as “for addressee only” or “personal”?\n\nIs the article addressed to an individual who no longer works within your department?\n\nDo not attempt to touch, open or move any suspicious letter, article or package.\n\nIf you receive an article, package or letter which you are concerned about immediately put the article down.\n\nDo not panic. Biological agents are not easily aerosolized. The mere act of opening an envelope or package containing a suspected agent would generally not provide the energy required to project the agent into your airway or breathing zone.\n\nIf possible request the assistance of a co-worker or other person in your area to immediately contact the University Police at 9-911 from any hard-wired campus phone or 414-229-9911 from a cellphone to inform them of the potential for a biological release on campus.\n\nIf you are alone, phone the police yourself, attempting to limit the number of things you come in contact with. If you have been contaminated, limiting what you touch will limit the spread of the contamination.\n\nWait for the police to arrive. Do not leave the area. Do not allow others who may have been in the area when the article was received or opened to leave until the Police arrive and assess the situation.\n\nUniversity Police will isolate the package and initiate all follow-up activities.\n\nThe Milwaukee Fire Department Hazardous Materials Unit will be called to respond to the incident. Additionally individuals from the Milwaukee Health Department will be called to campus to assist.\n\nA controlled evacuation of the building in which the suspected agent was found will probably occur. Evacuated individuals will be instructed to report to a “congregate care” center to provide information to authorities. Follow-up actions will be based on each individuals potential for exposure to the suspected agent.\n\nTornado Safety\n\nTornado and Severe Weather Awareness Week in Wisconsin typically occurs the second week of April. All state agencies, including UW-Milwaukee and the University of Wisconsin System, are to conduct tornado drills during that week. The purpose of the awareness campaign is to remind people of the dangers associated with tornadoes, thunderstorms, flooding and hail and to encourage citizens to take protective safety measures such as developing a personal preparedness plan and putting together a disaster supply kit.\n\nThe purpose of campus participation in a tornado drill is to ensure that faculty, staff, and students know what to do and where to go should a tornado or severe weather event occur. The Department of University Safety and Assurances will coordinate drills in all buildings on the UWM campus, usually held Thursday of Tornado and Severe Weather Awareness Week .\n\nTornado Warning\n\nA “Tornado Warning” indicates a tornado has been sighted and you should immediately take shelter. The “Tornado Warning” signal is a steady blast three minutes or longer in duration. There is no “All Clear” signal.\n\nThere are 48 outdoor warning sirens located throughout Milwaukee County. The warning siren nearest to the UWM campus is located at 1311 E. Chambers Street. These sirens are only intended to be heard outside to alert people to take shelter indoors. A full sounding of the sirens is done at noon on the second Wednesday of each month (weather permitting).\n\nIn the Event a Tornado Warning is Issued for the UWM Campus:\n\nBuilding occupants should seek shelter in designated areas. A basement area or an inner corridor, away from windows and doors, are classic shelter areas. See the recommended shelter areas for campus buildings below.\n\nIf for some reason you are unable to flee to a safer area, get under a desk, heavy table or other object that could shield you from flying debris. Evacuation to a shelter or safer area is best, however.\n\nNote that tornadoes can occur quickly and they last an average of seven minutes, so time is of the essence. If the weather looks threatening, monitor local media or the UWM’s Innovative Weather for weather updates. Also watch for RAVE Alerts which will be issued by University of Wisconsin Milwaukee Police. You can receive RAVE Alerts on your personal computer and on your cell phone. Here is the link that faculty and staff can use to add RAVE to your cell phone: https://www.getrave.com/login/uwmilwaukee Typically a “Tornado Watch” will be issued when conditions are favorable for a tornado. A “Tornado Warning” will be issued either when a tornado has been sighted or when the National Weather Service doppler radar detects tornado wind conditions. Please see detailed explanations of these alerts below.\n\nRecommendations for Individuals with a Disability:\n\nMobility impaired-wheelchair-elevator to shelter\n\nMobility impaired, non-wheelchair-elevator to shelter\n\nHearing impaired, inform of announcement and shelter advice\n\nVisually impaired, offer elbow and assist to shelter\n\nShelter Recommendations for Campus Buildings:\n\nTornado Shelter Area signs have been posted in each campus building.

If warranted, an “All Clear” notification will be made by the University Police. The University Police are in radio contact with the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office, which is also in charge of County Emergency Government, and appropriate weather outlets. After a tornado on campus, normal communications may not be available. Therefore, University Police and their designees (e.g. safety staff; Facility Services personnel;) may use squad car PA systems, bull horns, or personnel to move from building to building to announce the “All Clear”.\n\nAlternatively, campus occupants are encouraged to check UWM’s Innovative Weather, local news, or weather media updates.\n\nHow Big a Threat are Tornadoes to UWM?\n\nThe UWM campus has never been struck by a tornado. However, twisters have been sighted near campus in years past. There is nothing about the UWM environment that would render it any more immune to tornadoes than any other piece of land in the Midwest. Contrary to popular belief, neither an urban environment nor the presence of Lake Michigan will do anything at all to deter or deflect a tornado. Tornadoes have been spotted in all areas of Milwaukee County. The fact that no large loss of life has occurred here is due simply to good luck and random chance. Other urban areas in the Midwest have been struck by tornadoes, with heavy loss of life and property damage.\n\nHow Will I Know If Conditions Are Right For Tornado Formation?\n\nThe National Weather Service will notify the University Police and other area law enforcement agencies via teletype if a “Tornado Watch” is in effect. This condition means that weather conditions are favorable for the formation of a tornado, but that no tornadoes have yet been sighted. In all 2,000 mediated classrooms on campus, any VCR tuner connected to our Campus Cable Network can be tuned to either the Milwaukee Weather Channel (Channel 7) or the NOAA weather station for the Milwaukee area located in Delafield (Channel 27). Otherwise, if you have a radio or television in your office, tune to local radio and TV stations and listen continuously for weather updates. Be alert to changing weather conditions and look and listen for signs of an approaching tornado. Signs such as blowing debris or a sound often described as a roar or a sound similar to an approaching freight train can mean a tornado is nearby.\n\nHow Will I Know if a Tornado Has Actually Been Sighted?\n\nIn the event of a “Tornado Warning”, the National Weather Service will alert local agencies that a tornado has actually been sighted, either visually or by radar. Information will be transmitted over local radio and TV stations. A variety of notification methods will be used to direct all people on campus to seek shelter.\n\nIn all 2,000 mediated classrooms on campus, any VCR tuner connected to our Campus Cable Network can be tuned to either the Milwaukee Weather Channel (Channel 7) or the NOAA weather station for the Milwaukee area located in Delafield (Channel 27).\n\nIn addition, Milwaukee County Emergency Government will sound their warning sirens. The tornado “Warning Signal” is a steady blast three minutes or longer in duration. There is no “All Clear” signal.\n\nWhat Should I do if a Tornado Threatens the Campus?\n\nFirst, do not attempt to flee the tornado by foot or automobile. Twisters can move much faster than you can. Do not seek shelter in or under your car.\n\nSecondly, move to a location inside the building away from windows or glass. Most injuries related to tornadoes are caused by flying broken glass or other debris. An interior stairwell, hallway, or room on the lowest floor or in the basement is best, as long as it is away from windows. Contrary to popular belief, the southwest corner of a building is no safer than any other corner of the building. You may want to consider moving to another building if necessary. The Union, Lubar School of Business, or EMS parking structures would provide excellent shelter, but not the open design of the Sandburg parking structure. Avoid auditoriums, gymnasiums, or other spaces with wide, free-span roofs.\n\nHow Long do Tornadoes Last and How Fast do They Move?\n\nDetailed statistics about the time a tornado is on the ground or how quickly they move are not available. Their duration can range from an instant to several hours, but a typical tornado lasts approximately 5 minutes or so. Their movement can range from virtually stationary to more than 60 miles per hour. Typically, they move at roughly 10-20 miles per hour.\n\nWorkplace Violence\n\nWorkplace violence has emerged as an important safety and health issue in today’s workplace. Its most extreme form, homicide, is the third-leading cause of fatal occupational injury in the United States.\n\nUWM is committed to providing a safe and healthy place for our faculty, staff and students to work and learn. A person who believes that he or she has been the target of workplace violence should report it to the University Police and/or to his or her supervisor, manager or an appropriate administrator.\n\nThe non-emergency number for the University Police is 414-229-4627. If you believe you are in imminent danger, please contact the University Police by calling x9-911 from a campus phone or 414-229-9911 from a cellphone.\n\nUWM Resource: UWM Code of Conduct policy, May, 2013\n\nPost Incident Building Re-Entry Procedure\n\nFires, releases of chemical, biological or radiological materials, floods, gas leak, and other major emergencies that result in a building being evacuated may pose a health and safety threat to people. This procedure shall be followed to protect the individuals that need to re-enter the building as part of recovery operations."
