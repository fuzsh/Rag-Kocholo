        "text": "Lainey Wilson is sending us into the week ready to roll as she's set to release her newest track, 'Hang Tight Honey,' tonight (May 12).\n\nJust days after unveiling that her fifth record, Whirlwind, would be arriving in late August, Wilson has sent fans into a tizzy as she's been dropping teasers and snippets nearly every day since.\n\nStarting with a tongue-in-cheek letter to her sweet pup, Hippie, which talked about how much the reigning CMA Entertainer of the Year missed her furry companion though she's been having so much fun on her European tour, the Louisiana native followed it up with a video from the studio listening to the song that we can now recognize as 'Hang Tight Honey.'\n\nShowing off some of Wilson's signature southern rock charm, the new song finds Wilson singing about her road warrior lifestyle, driving from city to city as she performs for sold out crowds all over the world.\n\nHowever, the song also highlights how she misses her significant other back home and her itching to get back to them. \"But, baby, I miss your blue collar kiss / Just one more day to get through / Hang tight, honey / I got a pocket full of money and I'm heading straight home to you.\"\n\nIf the snippets thus far are any indication, 'Hang Tight Honey' serves as a blistering sneak peek at what's to come with Whirlwind later this year.\n\nOriginally thought to be titled Country's Cool Again after her already-released single and her sprawling 2024 touring odyssey, the new record will see Wilson step into a new era, officially moving on from her lauded Bell Bottom Country chapter. Though, we're pretty sure she'll still be donning her signature slacks for the foreseeable future!\n\nSaid to act as a reflection on the last few years of monumental success she's experienced, thanks in no small part to Bell Bottom Country, Wilson also made a point to say that the new collection \"is the most cathartic and personal piece of art Iâve ever made. I hope this record brings some peace to your whirlwind and wraps its arms around you like it did for me.\"\n\nThe last week's flurry of news comes on the heels of yet another country radio No. 1 for the star, as âWildflowers and Wild Horses' ascended to the peak of the charts.\n\nThe big moments just keep coming, though, as this week she'll head to the 2024 ACM Awards to battle it out for Female Artist of the Year, Song of the Year ('Heart Like A Truck'), Music Event of the Year ('Save Me' - Jelly Roll feat. Lainey Wilson) and the coveted Entertainer of the Year trophy.\n\nFor the lyrics to 'Hang Tight Honey' so far, see below:\n\nHang tight, honey, I'm white line running down a dream on a long lost highway\n\nMe and this band playing one night stands for some fans getting straight up sideways\n\nBut, baby, I miss your blue collar kiss\n\nJust one more day to get through\n\nHang tight, honey\n\nI got a pocket full of money and I'm heading straight home to you\n\nââ"
