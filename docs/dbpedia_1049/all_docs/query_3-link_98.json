(note 1)\n\nShe lost her sparkle you know she isn't the same\n\nLiving on reds and vitamin C and cocaine\n\nAll her friends can say is ain't it a shame\n\nTruckin' up to Buffalo\n\nBeen thinking you got to mellow slow\n\nTakes time, you pick a place to go\n\nJust keep truckin' on\n\nSitting and staring out of the hotel window\n\nGot a tip they're gonna kick the door in again\n\nLike to get some sleep before I travel\n\nBut if you got a warrant I guess you're gonna come in\n\nBusted down on Bourbon Street\n\nSet up like a bowling pin\n\nKnocked down, it gets to wearing thin\n\nThey just won't let you be\n\nYou're sick of hanging around, you'd like to travel\n\nGet tired of travelling you want to settle down\n\nI guess they can't revoke your soul for trying\n\nGet out of the door, light out and look all around\n\nSometimes the lights all shining on me\n\nOther times I can barely see\n\nLately it occurs to me\n\nWhat a long strange trip it's been"
