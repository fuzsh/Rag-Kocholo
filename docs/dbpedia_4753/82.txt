(1934–2008). American director, producer, and actor Sydney Pollack was responsible for a number of popular films beginning in the 1960s. As a director he was known for drawing strong performances from actors. Pollack was the recipient of an Academy Award for best director for the movie Out of Africa (1985).

Sydney Irwin Pollack was born on July 1, 1934, in Lafayette, Indiana. After high school, he moved to New York, New York, where he took acting classes with Sanford Meisner and later taught. In 1955 he appeared on Broadway, and the following year he began acting on television in series such as Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Twilight Zone. Pollack made his directorial debut in 1961 and later directed various TV series, including The Fugitive and Dr. Kildare. He won his first Emmy Award for a 1965 episode of the Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre television show.

The first movie that Pollack directed was The Slender Thread (1965), but his first critical and commercial success did not come until They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? (1969). The latter film was a Depression-era drama about a dance marathon that ends tragically for several of its contestants. With that movie Pollack received his first nomination for best director. In the 1970s he directed Robert Redford in several films, including the western Jeremiah Johnson (1972), the love story The Way We Were (1973), the thriller Three Days of the Condor (1975), and the adventure-romance The Electric Horseman (1979).

Pollack started the 1980s by directing Absence of Malice (1981), an exploration of the boundaries of journalistic ethics. The next year Tootsie (1982)—a romantic comedy starring Dustin Hoffman as a struggling actor who turns to cross-dressing in order to land a role on a soap opera—earned Pollack his second Oscar nomination for direction. In 1985 he directed the successful film Out of Africa, which was based on the life of Danish author Isak Dinesen (played by Meryl Streep). Out of Africa won seven Academy Awards, including best picture, and Pollack won his only Oscar for best director.

Pollack’s later career as a director was less successful. The movie Havana (1990), a 1950s drama set in Cuba, was widely panned. He rebounded with the box-office hit The Firm (1993), an adaptation of John Grisham’s thriller, with Tom Cruise as a hunted lawyer. Pollack’s last films include the romantic comedy Sabrina (1995) and the romantic drama Random Hearts (1999). After a long absence from directing, Pollack directed his final film, the political thriller The Interpreter, in 2005. That same year he also directed an episode on architect Frank Gehry for American Masters, a series on public television.

Alongside directing, Pollack continued to act. He appeared in his own films as well as in those directed by others, and he acted in a number of television shows. Pollack also produced nearly 50 films, including Tootsie, Michael Clayton (2007), and The Reader (2008), which were nominated for Oscars in the best picture category. In addition, he was a producer for the HBO film Recount (2008), which won an Emmy Award for best television movie. Pollack died on May 26, 2008, in Pacific Palisades, California.
