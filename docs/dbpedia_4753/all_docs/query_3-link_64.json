        "text": "Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Can you tell us the story of how you grew up?\n\nI am a native New Yorker and grew up in Harlem. According to 23 and me, I’m half Spanish and half Mayan, so I’m literally at war with myself lol. I was raised Catholic by hard working parents.\n\nCan you share a story with us about what brought you to this specific career path?\n\nI was a shy kid growing up, and I turned to the movies for escape, comfort and inspiration. I began seeing myself on the big screen even though nobody in my neighborhood or family thought this was a good idea.\n\nCan you tell us the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?\n\nEach project has had an interesting story attached to it, and these are the things I think of when I think of my career, because it’s far more lasting than box office, or whether or not it was a “hit”.\n\nIt’s the moments between people at the time of the filming that move me the most, like Ben Stiller generously explaining the different camera equipment purposes to my then eight year old daughter when she came to visit me on the set of “The secret life of Walter Mitty,” or Jerry Seinfeld calling me, ‘comedy gold,’ on the set of “Unfrosted,” or Sydney Pollack reassuring me with compassion and kindness to help me overcome my nerves on the set of “The Interpreter,” moments before my big scenes with Nicole Kidman. So many good memories.\n\nIt has been said that our mistakes can be our greatest teachers. Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?\n\nI came from the stage where basically the script is the script, and there are rarely, if any, changes to that script, and I assumed that was the case in television and film when I was starting out. I was wrong. I remember memorizing my dialogue for one version of the script, and then ignoring an email with a subsequent different version of the script and showing up to set completely unprepared for the days work! Not so much funny as it was horrifying, but somehow I got through it. Always read the new versions of the scripts. ALWAYS BE PREPARED.\n\nWhat are some of the most interesting or exciting projects you are working on now?\n\nI filming an episode of “Blue bloods” on CBS, and on a break I walked into the kitchen and there was a wide selection of pop tarts and I couldn’t stop laughing because I’m in the new “Unfrosted pop tart movie that Mr. Seinfeld has directed for Netflix. It literally has a galaxy of stars, and I’m proud of the fact that he thought highly of me and gave me the opportunity to work with him and a stellar cast — Melissa McCarthy, Jim Gaffigan, Amy Schumer, to name a few.\n\nYou have been blessed with success in a career path that can be challenging. Do you have any words of advice for others who may want to embark on this career path, but seem daunted by the prospect of failure?\n\nYou have to take a deep breath and jump! Everyone is afraid of something. I think it’s really important, however, to define for yourself what success and failure mean to you from the onset of your career. it sets the template for whether or not you’re going to enjoy the journey or not. For myself, success is putting out content and characterizations that help illuminate, enlighten and entertain people, and being grateful for it all every step of the way. It’s showing up, especially when I don’t want to. Failure for me is giving my power to the whims of a extremely difficult business that is not a meritocracy, and/ or giving up. Whatever your career path, you have to be resilient, or the talent you have will haunt you.\n\nWe are very interested in diversity in the entertainment industry. Can you share three reasons with our readers about why you think it’s important to have diversity represented in film and television? How can that potentially affect our culture?\n\nI just think in 2024 that it is in the audience’s best interest to see the world it is actually in, and accurately depicted in film and television, and not some one note regurgitation of things we’ve seen in the past. As I show in my movie, iGilbert, it’s all about connection, not just with what we know, but also by embracing the opportunity to connect with what we don’t know through the language of images and story. It’s a beautiful thing when given half a chance.\n\nWhat are your “5 things I wish someone told me when I first started” and why?\n\n1 . No one succeeds alone — All along my journey, and usually when I was about to give up, people have come around to say or do something that was helpful and encouraging. You just have to be open to the miracles that come your way, and the people that bring these miracle to you.\n\n2 . You are enough — Embracing who you are is one of the most powerful strengths you can have. I was told by a former agent that if I change my name to something Italian, I would work a lot more .Well, I’m doing just fine, not ignoring my own heritage.\n\n3 . Resiliency is everything — I honestly thought I would be a big star within a few years. That divine intervention would just pick me up from Harlem and plant me at the stage where they give out the Oscars… That was not the case, obviously. Whatever path you choose, it takes time. There’s no app for real life experience and that is as it should be. The key is to embrace and connect with people along the way and allow these experiences to fuel your energy for the next day.\n\n4 . See the water — this is an expression I read from David Foster Wallace. it is about being mindful of everything in front of you, and trying to say all the variables at play, and not jump to conclusions.\n\nI remember standing on a line at a pharmacy, and the line was taking forever and people were groaning and complaining, and when I got to the front of the line, I saw that the sales person was new; just learning, terrified.\n\nAnd I wanted to help her and I felt bad for being impatient. I couldn’t see that she was a beginner from the back of a line but I definitely could’ve trusted that there was a reason for this moment and that I could just trust that reason even if I didn’t totally understand it. I’ve never regretted any time when I was kind or just patient.\n\n5 . Don’t stop until your proud — it’s important to take real pride in your work and show up for it and to push yourself towards the high bar of excellence even when there are days when you are exhausted and that bar seems a mile away. Take a break and regroup and come back harder than ever.\n\nThese days I have to audition about half the time, and when I do I make sure it’s for a project I have a passion for, and I make sure I work my ass off before sending in a submission that I’m proud of.\n\nGetting the job or not getting the job is almost irrelevant, what is very relevant is that I can live comfortably in my own skin and I can do that knowing I didn’t stop working until I was proud of the work.\n\nWhich tips would you recommend to your colleagues in your industry to help them to thrive and not “burn out”?\n\nIt’s really important to do work that really connects with you and matters to you and not just say yes to everything because you just want to work. I like taking breaks. I find museums and walks and putting down the phone and just connecting with people very rejuvenating. I miss seeing peoples eyes when I talk to them and I’m tired of texting. Direct communication with people even if it’s just FaceTime has helped me thrive.\n\nYou are a person of enormous influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)\n\nIt would be amazing to see the whole world dedicate itself for just one day to only communicate with other people either in person or FaceTime — no texting, no emails, no phone calls, you have to see the other person’s face and communicate that way for one full day. My mind is blown just thinking about it.\n\nNone of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?\n\nI remember Mr. Kerrigan in high school. He was my speech teacher, and I walked up to the front of the class and gave a speech about my family, and it turned out to be very funny and deadpan with a lot of understated humor. I was just being me, but these were skills that he pointed out, could be very valuable to me, and he was right. Mr. Kerrigan was the first one to publicly acknowledge my talent, and if he were alive today, I would thank him and give him a hug.\n\nCan you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?\n\n“Death ends a life but it does not end a relationship”\n\nThis is a line from a play I did called “I never sang for my father” by Robert Anderson. play.\n\nI think of it whenever I miss the people in my life that have passed on. I still speak to them every day I still listen to them every day.\n\nWe are very blessed that some very prominent names in Business, VC funding, Sports, and Entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world, or in the US with whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this if we tag them.\n\nThe hardest question! I love Eva Longoria. What she has accomplished as a Latina in Hollywood from acting to directing and producing and helping others along the way, sets a wonderful example for all of us. Call me, Eva!\n\nHow can our readers follow you online?\n\ninstagram- @TasteOfAdrian\n\nThis was very meaningful, thank you so much! We wish you continued success!\n\nThank you!"
