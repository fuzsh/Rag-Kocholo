        "text": "October 11, 2000\n\nDGA members Mike Nichols and Sydney Pollack, Senator Edward M. Kennedy and International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees President Thomas Short named 2000 Honorees for Second Annual Directors Guild of America Honors.\n\nGala To Be Held December 10th at The Grand Hyatt New York.\n\nFilmmakers Mike Nichols and Sydney Pollack, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and labor leader Thomas Short will be among those honored at the Second Annual Directors Guild of America Honors, a black-tie gala to be held at The Grand Hyatt New York on December 10th.\n\n“The Directors Guild of America is proud of the new DGA Honors tradition that was established by our wonderfully successful inaugural event in 1999,”commented DGA President Jack Shea.\n\nThe evening will celebrate individuals and organizations that have made distinguished contributions to our nation’s culture in support of filmmaking and television. The membership of the Directors Guild of America, other top entertainment industry professionals, union, government and business leadership from across the nation are expected to attend. All honorees will be present to accept their award.\n\n“Directors Guild of America Honors recognizes outstanding contribution to American culture,” said DGA National Vice President Ed Sherin. “The 2000 honorees are each superbly qualified to meet the high standard of excellence exemplified by last year’s recipients and our Guild is proud to bring public focus to their respective contributions through the spotlight of DGA Honors.”\n\nLegendary filmmaker Mike Nichols, who has directed Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, The Graduate (for which he won both the DGA and Academy Awards for Best Director), Carnal Knowledge, Working Girl, Silkwood and The Birdcage, among dozens of others, will be receiving the Filmmaker Award. Mr. Nichols has had an outstanding career in film, television and theatre, winning six Tony Awards and a Grammy.\n\nSydney Pollack has directed and/or produced more than 30 films and won two Academy Awards for Out of Africa (Best Director and Best Picture). He will receive the Artists Rights Foundation's “John Huston Award” for outstanding commitment to artist’s rights. Mr. Pollack has been a champion for the protection of the creative work of film directors and he has testified before a Subcommittee of the Unites States Senate on the subject of film colorization. The “John Huston Award” has become one of the film community’s most prestigious awards. Barbra Streisand, who co-starred in Pollack’s The Way We Were, said “I can think of no one more deserving to carry on the legacy and tradition of the ‘John Huston’ Award than him.”\n\nSenator Edward M. Kennedy, who throughout his nearly 40 year career in the United States Congress has been a staunch supporter of the National Endowment for the Arts and First Amendment issues, will receive the National Honoree Award, the DGA’s highest recognition extended to persons outside the filmmaking community. Senator Kennedy is the ranking Democrat on the United States Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and has fought for issues ranging from the minimum wage to quality health care, education reform, civil rights and environmental protection.\n\nProminent entertainment labor leader, Thomas C. Short, International President of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) will receive the Union Leadership Award. For more than 30 years since joining the Stagehands Local No.27 in Cleveland, Ohio, Mr. Short has been an outspoken advocate for those who work in specialized crafts within the entertainment industry.\n\nAdditional honorees for this year’s event will be announced shortly.\n\nLast year’s honorees included filmmaker Martin Scorsese, Congressman Richard Gephardt (D- MO), Thomas O’Donnell Sr.(President of Local 817 of The International Brotherhood of Teamsters), Robert Shaye, Founder and CEO of New Line Cinema and the Austin Texas Film Society. A committee of DGA members appointed by DGA National Vice President Ed Sherin selects honorees.\n\nFounded in 1936 by 13 of Hollywood’s leading filmmakers, including the legendary John Ford and King Vidor, the Directors Guild of America is the nation’s pre-eminent organization representing directors and members of the directorial team. The Directors Guild of America represents 11,872 members who work in feature film, filmed, taped and live television, commercials, and documentaries, including Directors, Unit Production Managers, Assistant Directors, Associate Directors, Technical Coordinators, Stage Managers and Production Associates.\n\nThe Second Annual Directors Guild of America Honors on Sunday, December 10th, will begin with a cocktail reception at 6:00 PM, dinner at 7:00 PM, followed by the awards presentation at 8:00 pm at the Grand Hyatt New York (East 42nd Street between Park and Lexington Avenues).\n\nFor table or ticket information, please contact (212) 581-0370."
