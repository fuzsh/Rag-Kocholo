        "text": "Adult Education\n\nBlanche's psychology professor sexually harasses her when she goes to him for help on a difficult test. Blanche's professor makes her an harassing deal: If she has sex with him, he'll give her an \"A\" for the exam. Meanwhile, Dorothy, Rose and Sophia each try to get a hold of tickets for a sold out Frank Sinatra concert.\n\nLittle Sister\n\nRose's sister, Holly comes for a visit and becomes quick friends with Dorothy and Blanche, and leaves Rose out in the cold. However, when Rose catches Holly with Blanche's boyfriend and tries to tell Blanche, Dorothy and Blanche refuse to believe her.\n\nDeep Throat\n\nA test pilot who may have been flying aircraft made with alien technology disappears, and Mulder and Scully must defy their own government to find the truth.\n\nHalloween V\n\nOn Halloween night, Frankie and Mike are stunned â and a bit scared â to learn that Brick has invited a girl over to the house just to hang with him. Meanwhile, to help supplement her college fund, Sue attempts to put together a pumpkin patch screening of the animated classic, It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown; and Axl reluctantly goes to the library to write a history paper and ironically gets locked inside after staying past closing hours."
