        "text": "As for the climax of the story, Laurents modeled The Way We Were after his married friends, Peter and Jigee Viertel. He met them in Paris after moving there to escape the Hollywood Witch Hunt; Jigee’s ex-husband informed on her, and the FBI pressured Peter, who found that “the husband of a Party member wasn’t welcome in either the Marines or the studios.”\n\nAfter Laurents spun his story, Ray Stark asked for a ten or twenty-page treatment — In the movie business, a treatment is a synopsis of the story that happens in the screenplay, with action, and sparse dialogue. Laurents says he wrote a 125-page treatment (which he later turned into a novel which was released to bookstores May 1972).\n\nStreisand recalled: “He wrote a treatment that had five great scenes in it. And so I said, Yes! I want to do that as a movie. And then he wrote the script.”\n\nSydney Pollack was brought on board to direct at the end of 1971. He was suggested by Arthur Laurents, who enjoyed the picture Pollack made with Jane Fonda – They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? Streisand liked the fact that Pollack had studied with acting coach Sanford Meisner.\n\nIn a letter he wrote to Robert Redford on December 4th, Pollack tried hard to convince his pal to take the role of Hubbell Gardiner. “Hubbell is NOT a cop-out or a weak guy, rather he is the most sophisticated character in the novel,” Pollack wrote. “Hubbell sees all sides of the argument and therefore cannot take the extreme positions Katie does.”\n\nPollack continued his plea to Redford. “The whole McCarthy thing can be a great asset if it’s handled unpretentiously and un-preachy.” As for Streisand, Pollack told Redford: “She’s unbelievably good in the right thing … and it’s been a long time since you’ve had any help [on screen] outside of BUTCH” [CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, who Redford starred in with Paul Newman].\n\n“If I knew you less well and we weren’t friends I wouldn’t sell so hard,” Pollack wrote. “But I’m too excited about this possibility not to push. For me, it’s that very rare combination of GOOD and Commercial.”\n\nWith Redford taking a second look at the movie, Laurents began rewriting for his star talents. Ray Stark brought him and Pollack to a ski lodge in Sun Valley, Idaho to work on the script. Of the Redford and Streisand pairing, Laurents likened them to “Astaire-Rogers but more because he had more sex to begin with than Astaire, she had more class to begin with than Rogers, together they made the screen swoon every time they were in the same frame.”\n\nPICTURED: Streisand and writer David Rayfiel\n\nRedford remained concerned, however, that Hubbell Gardiner was underwritten, and Streisand’s part was bigger. Stark, Pollack and Laurents left Sun Valley with a final screenplay before filming began, with Laurents noting, “Nobody, including the publishers of the novel, ever liked ‘The Way We Were.’ They considered it a temporary title until the day it passed into the language.”\n\nAfter joining the producer and director on an Upstate New York location scouting trip, Laurents received a call from Pollack. “Ray’s going to fire you,” he warned. Laurents admonished Pollack: “You’re going to build up Redford’s part because you’re in love with him. I don’t mean homosexually but he’s the blond goy you wish you were. The picture is Barbra’s no matter what you do because the story is hers. Be careful you don’t destroy it trying to give it to him.”\n\nThen Laurents received a call from Stark, known to be a master manipulator. “Sydney is going to fire you.”\n\nFed up with the whole mishegoss, Laurents left the movie and learned that Stark brought in eleven writers to “polish” his screenplay. Among them: Larry Gelbart, Dalton Trumbo, Alvin Sargent, Francis Ford Coppola, and David Rayfiel. Shooting at Cornell was postponed, then abandoned while the script was fine-tuned.\n\nRobert Redford felt that Hubbell, as written by Laurents, “was really a symbol of a certain kind of man and I wasn’t comfortable playing just a symbol. It was o.k. for Hubbell to be passive, but I wanted to show some justification for it, some reason.”\n\nIt was writer David Rayfiel who added juicy, character bits to some of the scenes. Rayfiel, Pollack remembers, came up with the game that J.J. and Hubbell play (“Best year, best this, best that”) “It works so well at the end when [Hubbell] can’t think of a year that’s the best year anymore,” Pollack said. Rayfiel also wrote new scenes like the train station argument for Hubbell and Katie in which she responds, “Hubbell, people are their principles.” Rayfiel was a favorite of Redford and Pollack and over the years he had a hand in augmenting several of their films, including Out of Africa and The Electric Horseman.\n\nAlvin Sargent added the bit with Hubbell tying Katie’s show to the end of Laurents’ already written scene between Katie and Hubbell over beers one night at the college town patio.\n\nAs filming approached, Ray Stark called up Arthur Laurents to beg for help. Laurents wrote in his memoir, “They hadn’t kept track of the rewrites of the rewrites. There were holes in scenes, the story was garbled, Barbra was unhappy, Redford wasn’t any happier—would I come back?” He wanted to protect the work even though is feelings had been hurt. But he was not entirely successful. A confrontation scene between Hubbell and Katie at Beekman Place in front of Hubbell’s friends was a sore spot for Laurents. “It was rewritten by one of the Pollack Eleven and staged by Sydney so that Katie harangued Hubbell in front of his friends. Making her a shrill, insensitive harridan while he is a strong, true gent who takes no crap.”\n\nLaurents admitted that during filming “I had more success with writing inserts or moments or even scenes, whatever was needed to fill in the holes and cover the gaps left in the story by the rewrites of the Eleven.”\n\nRay Stark told the columnist Joyce Haber, “It’s what always happens,” regarding the Redford-centric rewrites. “It’s simply last-minute nerves and jitters.”\n\nIt’s clear when Laurent’s August 1972 script is compared to the final film that the other writers contributed several of the film’s second act scenes. Not in Laurent’s script:\n\nBissinger’s Hollywood tennis party, which introduced all of the Los Angeles characters at once\n\nthe Marx Brothers party scene\n\nthe Katie and Hubbell “people are their principles” scene\n\nArthur Laurents was no fan of Pollack, who he felt undercut the politics he had written simply because he didn’t really understand them. Laurents fought hard to keep the line, “Hubbell, people are their principles” and even worked with Streisand to win that battle (Pollack wanted to cut the line). He lost the battle on another line that came at the end of the breakup scene where Katie says, “I want us to love each other!” Hubbell was to say, “The trouble is we do.” But Pollack cut it. “They loved each other despite, not because,” Arthur Laurents argued. “Sydney looked blank. To him, if they loved each other, they’d surmount any trouble; if trouble was continuous, they didn’t love each other. How do you explain the complexities of love to a Sydney Pollack?”\n\nPollack told Judith Crist, “the penultimate ending was much more political than what’s there now. It’s why there’s a disjointed feeling in the third act of the picture – where you can see the surgery. The audiences were just plain bored when we got into the politics. They wanted to know what was happening with Bob and Barbra. And so I had to weed out most of the rest of it.”\n\nWarren Beatty, Dennis Cole, Ken Howard, and Ryan O'Neal were all considered as Hubbell.\n\n“Stark had me to his house in California for an afternoon of tennis and to meet Barbra. It was very pleasant,” said Ken Howard. Arthur Laurents told writer René Jordan “there was no sex appeal between them, that nothing would happen up there on the screen … I agreed with her one hundred percent and Howard was out.”\n\nWith the rewrites for Redford putting the movie’s start date behind schedule, Pollack said that Ray Stark got impatient. “So finally Ray Stark, who is a very proud man, said: ‘Look, I’m not going to wait any more. I’m not going to be pushed around by Robert Redford. We’ll get Ryan O’Neal or so-and-so, or so-and-so.’” Pollack recalled. “I knew I was right in this case, so I kept saying that the picture would not be right without Redford. It literally wouldn’t work. Because up until that point Barbra had never worked with a really strong leading man.”\n\nRedford told Oprah Winfrey, “I thought it was a good script. I thought it was great for Barbra. But the character in the initial script was, I felt, one dimensional,” he said. “So [director] Sydney [Pollack] and I got together, and we worked something that felt good to me, which was a character that appeared a certain way and people would ascribe certain things to him that he didn't really know were true.”\n\nBarbra always wanted Redford for the part. “I was hoping and praying, but it didn't look good. And then, I was in Africa making a movie and ... a friend of mine at the time sent me a telegram, and it said ‘Barbra Redford?’ and I knew he had signed on.”\n\nThe song “The Way We Were” — with music by Marvin Hamlisch and lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman — is as well-loved as the movie itself.\n\nMarilyn Bergman said, “Well, first of all it's a wonderful title. The main title of the movie had to function as a passage way back in time. We were underscoring the flashback, in a way.”\n\n“You are tailor-making a song for an artist,” Hamlisch explained. “And if it's Barbra Streisand it has to fit her until she's comfortable.” Hamlisch recalled “how wonderful she sounds when she holds certain notes. I wanted to give her the notes that let her soar.”\n\n“[Barbra] made two suggestions,” Marilyn Bergman recalled. “One was the change of a note in the first phrase of the tune. And the other was a change of a word, a very important suggestion. We had the lyric beginning with ‘daydreams light the corners of your mind,’ and she suggested that the first word of the song be ‘mem'ries.’”\n\nHamlisch became involved in the first place because he had just worked on Ray Stark’s boxing movie, Fat City, as music supervisor. Stark called up Hamlisch and asked for “a song that was roughly a cross between Michel Legrand and Carole King. Well, I thought that over and, on the surface, it was a pretty difficult assignment. I went to bed one night, but I woke up at 2 a.m. and I had the song. It was there. I wrote it down and when I got up the next morning, I made some minor changes and had the finished product. I called Allan and Marilyn Bergman and in a short while the song was done.”\n\nIn his memoir, Hamlisch goes into details about the tune, describing how he could have chosen a minor key, which would reflect the heartbreak more. “I decided to write it in the major mode. By doing this, I tried to give a sense of hope to this tragic story.”\n\nIt was Alan Bergman who suggested “maybe we could do even better” after the tune was approved but not yet recorded. Hamlisch and the Bergmans also wrote a second song with a different melody for the film. Hamlisch said it was “more complex in structure, with a more complicated melody.”\n\nBarbra liked it a lot, after recording a demo of “The Way We Were II.” But Pollack was shrewd and ran both songs against the visuals of the movie. Everyone agreed that the first version worked better in the movie. “The Way We Weren't” (as the second song is nicknamed) appears on Streisand's retrospective CD box set, Just For the Record.\n\nWhen it came time to record the song in the studio, Hamlisch wisely prepared three different orchestrations, knowing that Streisand could surely ask for changes on the spot. Sure enough, Streisand wasn’t feeling the first arrangement, which Hamlisch described as a very romantic orchestration. Streisand liked the second version: “less romance and more introspection.”\n\nAppearing at number eight on the American Film Institute's list of 100 greatest movie songs, “The Way We Were” was nominated for (and won!) an Academy Award for Best Original Song. Hamlisch, too, was awarded an Oscar for the film's Best Original Dramatic Score. At the 46th Annual Academy Awards, Peggy Lee sang “The Way We Were” on the live telecast."
