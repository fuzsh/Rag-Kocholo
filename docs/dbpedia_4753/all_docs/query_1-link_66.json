        "text": "Life as a lawyer tends to be fast-paced, diverse and full of exciting challenges, which is why the profession has become the subject of plenty of awesome movies, books and jokes! Here, we explore the greatest media about lawyers, from must-read books and funny memes to the most popular law-based TV shows around.\n\nTV Shows about lawyers\n\nThere are plenty of awesome and realistic law dramas on TV. If you love watching high-quality series, you are going to love this list of the top TV shows about lawyers of all times.\n\nSuits\n\nSince 2011, Suits has been entertaining audiences with its quick wit and ever-changing storylines. The legal drama launched the career of Meghan Markle and follows the daily workings of a fictional law firm in New York City.\n\nWhen Harvey Clifford Specter is promoted to senior partner, he is given the chance to hire an associate attorney. Impressed by Mike Ross’s quick thinking, Harvey hires him, despite knowing that he never completed his law degree.\n\nEach episode follows a new criminal case while exploring life in and out of the office. With nine seasons, this long-standing drama is one of the best TV shows about lawyers available!\n\nThe Night Of\n\nWhile Suits entertains with its light-hearted nature, The Night Of offers a look at the darker side of the law. This eight-part crime drama is based on the BBC \"Criminal Justice\" series and follows a complex murder case.\n\nPakistani-American college student, Naz, is accused of a crime he didn’t commit, after finding himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. As his hapless lawyer attempts to clear his name, Naz finds an unlikely assistant at Rikers Island correctional facility.\n\nEdgy and gripping, The Night Of is one for thriller fans.\n\nHow to Get Away With Murder\n\nSharp, clever and full of twists, How to Get Away with Murder follows Annalise Keating, a college professor teaching students about the ins and outs of criminal law. Annalise is also a defence attorney and selects a group of her favourite students to assist her with her latest cases.\n\nHowever, when a real-life murder takes place, Annalise and her students must put their skills into practice.\n\nIf you like a rollercoaster storyline, then you’ll definitely think How to Get Away with Murder is one of the best TV shows about lawyers!\n\nPerry Mason\n\nFrom 1957 until 1966, Perry Mason was our go-to TV lawyer! The popular American show was based on the detective novels of Erle Stanley Gardner (who was himself a lawyer!) and follows a smart defence attorney as he bravely represents clients with apparently hopeless cases.\n\nYet Perry’s smarts means he knows exactly how to win, bringing forward surprise witnesses and excelling at cross-examination, in order to force the real baddie to confess.\n\nLaw and Order\n\nAnother iconic American series, Law and Order has become so popular that it is now a franchise. Yet the original is arguably the best. The show started in 1990 and ran for more than 20 years.\n\nSet in New York City, each episode is formed from two parts: first, the NYPD hunt for a suspect following a dastardly crime, before the lawyers take over as the suspect is taken to court. What made the show so good, is that every case had actually recently happened, meaning storylines were partly based on true crimes.\n\nGripping and cleverly written, Law and Order remains one of the best TV shows about lawyers ever made!\n\nThe Good Wife\n\nIn 2009 The Good Wife hit our screens. The show follows Alicia Florrick in the wake of a humiliating scandal that sees her husband, a former state attorney, imprisoned.\n\nIn order to keep her life, and the lives of her children, from crumbling, Alicia puts her embarrassment to one side and goes back to doing what she does best, working as a litigator at a Chicago law firm.\n\nDynamic and boundary-pushing, this show is one for fans of female empowerment!\n\nDamages\n\nWinner of numerous awards and dazzling with an all-star cast that includes John Goodman and James Gandolfini,\n\nDamages follows Patty Hewes (Glenn Close), a merciless attorney, and her protege Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne). The show takes on a realistic approach, allocating a whole series to a single legal case.\n\nEach episode also weaves in the difficult relationship between Patty and Ellen, as their professional and personal lives collide.\n\nMovies about lawyers\n\nMovie fans can also enjoy some entertaining media about lawyers. In fact, some of the most popular films of all time are set in and around the courtroom. Here, we run through our favourite law-based movies, where our sector is placed under the spotlight.\n\n12 Angry Men\n\nReleased in 1957, 12 Angry Men is considered one of the greatest movies of all time. Set in a single location, Sidney Lumet’s iconic black and white film follows 12 jury members as they argue over the guilt of a man accused of murder.\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nStarring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, Philadelphia is an emotional rollercoaster of a film. Dating back to 1993, it follows a man diagnosed with HIV, who is dismissed from a law firm because of his illness. Wanting to prove that he was wrongfully fired, he seeks the help of a homophobic lawyer – the only man willing to take his case to court.\n\nErin Brockovich\n\nJulia Roberts’s iconic 2000 movie, Erin Brockovich, is based on an amazing true story. A down-on-her-luck single mother is hired as a legal assistant after losing a court battle for whiplash. When Erin begins to piece together the wrong-doings of a large power company, accused of polluting California’s water supply with devastating consequences, this once ridiculed woman shows her prowess both in and out of the courtroom.\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird\n\nBased on the timeless novel by Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird stars Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, a successful lawyer and single father to Scout and Jem. While examining the childhoods of the Finch kids, the film also explores race, gender and stereotypes as Atticus helps defend an innocent black men, accused of rape.\n\nPlacing his reputation and his family’s lives on the line, Atticus works to do what’s right, while Scout and Jem discover they must grow up quickly in an increasingly changing world.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nAnother classic from Sidney Lumet, The Verdict was written by iconic playwright, David Mamet. Released in 1982, the movie stars Paul Newman as disgraced lawyer, Frank Galvin, who is given a second chance when he comes across a medical malpractice case that he becomes determined to win. Going up against renowned attorney, Edward Concannon (James Mason), Frank must prove his worth while fighting for what is right!\n\nThe Devil’s Advocate\n\nIf you’re into something a little more sinister, then The Devil’s Advocate might be for you.\n\nReleased in 1997, the supernatural-horror movie has a star-studded cast and tells the story of aspiring defence lawyer, Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves), as he moves his way up the ranks at a New York law firm, headed up by powerhouse John Milton (Al Pacino).\n\nSoon, Kevin’s wife (Charlize Theron) becomes tormented by unusual supernatural occurrences, as Kevin begins to realize that his boss is not all that he appears...\n\nThe Firm\n\nSydney Pollack’s classic 90s movie, The Firm, is based on the popular John Grisham novel and is another film boasting an all-star lineup! Tom Cruise stars as Mitch McDeere, a promising law student who accepts a role at a notable Memphis firm.\n\nSeduced by the power and money that his new role affords, Mitch quickly becomes entangled in money laundering and murder cover-ups.

Gary did not give evidence in court, but Mr Dezarnaulds’s fine was dropped - a win for both goat and man!\n\nBud the parrot becomes a witness in a Michigan murder trial\n\nIn Michigan in 2017, a parrot named Bud became a witness in a murder trial, after its owner, Glenna Duram, was found guilty of shooting her husband.
