        "text": "Though his work often proves less self-congratulatory than many of his colleagues, there are few filmmakers working today as respected, successful and deserving of praise as Sydney Pollack. After small parts in stage productions and a supporting role in the forgettable '60s film War Hunt - perhaps best known as Robert Redford's silver screen debut - Pollack ventured behind the camera, and found a much more fascinating world to explore; rather than simply inhabiting a single role, he could now take them all on - and all at the same time.\n\n1969's They Shoot Horses, Don't They offered Pollack his first taste of box office success, and several subsequent '70s hits catapulted him and his actors into the upper strata of Hollywood's elite; Jeremiah Johnson, The Way We Were and Three Days of the Condor made stars of Redford, Barbra Streisand, and Faye Dunaway all and simultaneously cemented the director's status as a creative and commercial force. During the 1980s, he emerged again from behind the camera for sporadic starring roles in some of his own films, most notably Tootsie, but a more significant career development came when he abandoned widescreen filmmaking, due largely to the advent of pan-and-scan TV presentation. So while films like Out of Africa and The Firm exploited their rea-life locales to great narrative effect, the accompanying imagery occasionally left a little to be desired.\n\nBut five films and twenty years later, Pollack returns not only to the expansive opportunities of widescreen moviemaking, but the prominence he once held as a leading purveyor of intelligent, adult-oriented entertainment. The Interpreter, which stars Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman, opened earlier this year to critical acclaim and commercial success, and offers the director's first widescreen film - and, quite honestly, his best - in two decades. Pollack recently sat down with IGN DVD to discuss the development and design of this hot-button political thriller, which debuts on DVD October 4, 2005.\n\nClick here or on the links below to check out IGN's exclusive interview with director Sydney Pollack for the release of The Intepreter on DVD!"
