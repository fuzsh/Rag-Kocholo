        "text": "Mira Sorvino (born September 28, 1967, New York, New York, U.S.) is an American actress who won an Academy Award for best supporting actress for her portrayal of a dim-witted but warmhearted prostitute in Woody Allen’s Mighty Aphrodite (1995).\n\nSorvino, the daughter of character actor Paul Sorvino, grew up in New Jersey. She excelled at school and attended Harvard University, graduating in 1990 with a major in East Asian area studies after spending an academic year abroad in China, where she learned to speak Mandarin. She then moved to New York City and worked in various jobs before deciding to pursue an acting career. She found a few minor roles in television before being hired by writer and director Rob Weiss to help him on his independent movie Amongst Friends (1993); she played a simple suburban girl whose boyfriend chooses a life of crime. She portrayed a Spanish woman in the comedy of manners Barcelona (1994).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nSorvino was cast as the wife of a congressional investigator in her first major movie, Robert Redford’s Quiz Show (1994), and she played an American from South America in the television miniseries The Buccaneers (1995) before being cast in Mighty Aphrodite. Her performance in that film brought her critical praise and a Golden Globe Award in addition to the Oscar. Sorvino appeared in Ted Demme’s comic romance Beautiful Girls (1996) and was nominated for both a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award for her portrayal of Marilyn Monroe in the TV movie Norma Jean & Marilyn (1996). She then starred with Lisa Kudrow in Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion (1997), played an entomologist in Guillermo del Toro’s horror film Mimic (1997), and acted opposite Chow Yun-Fat in the thriller The Replacement Killers (1998). Sorvino won favourable reviews for her role as the wife of the hairdresser played by John Leguizamo in Spike Lee’s Summer of Sam (1999), and she appeared as Daisy Buchanan in the 2000 television movie The Great Gatsby.\n\nSorvino’s later career consisted largely of major roles in such minor films as The Triumph of Love (2001), Between Strangers (2002), and The Final Cut (2004). She starred with Donald Sutherland in the TV miniseries Human Trafficking (2005) and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for her performance. Her later movies included Union Square (2011), Space Warriors (2013), Quitters (2015), and The Red Maple Leaf (2016). In 2019 she appeared in the action comedy Stuber.\n\nIn addition to her film work, Sorvino acted in a number of television shows, including Intruders (2014) and Falling Skies (2014–15). In 2018 she appeared in the spy series Condor, inspired by Sydney Pollack’s thriller Three Days of the Condor (1975). In the Netflix miniseries Hollywood (2020), she played an actress in the 1940s. She later was cast in the miniseries Impeachment: American Crime Story (2021), about the impeachment of U.S. Pres. Bill Clinton, and Shining Vale (2022– ), a horror-comedy series in which she portrayed a ghost."
