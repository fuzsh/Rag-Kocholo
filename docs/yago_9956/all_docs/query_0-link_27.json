        "text": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_Stearns\n\nAbel Stearns (February 9, 1798 – August 23, 1871) was a trader who came to the Pueblo de Los Angeles, Alta California in 1829 and became a major landowner, cattle rancher and one of the area's wealthiest citizens.\n\nStearns was born in Lunenburg, Massachusetts, the son of Elizabeth (née Goodrich) and Levi Stearns, a farmer. His parents were both from families that came from England in the 1600s.[1] Stearns went to Mexico in about 1826, where he became a naturalized citizen.\n\nIn 1829, Abel Stearns emigrated to Monterey, California, then settled in the Pueblo de los Ángeles, present day Los Angeles, California. He obtained a government concession to build a warehouse at San Pedro, the nearest seaport. Later, he established a stagecoach route connecting San Pedro Bay with the Los Angeles pueblo. In 1831, he built a three-story flour mill on North Spring Street, Los Angeles. Soon, Stearns became one of the most prominent and influential citizens of the pueblo.[3]\n\nIn 1842 Stearns bought the 28,000-acre (110 km2) Rancho Los Alamitos between Los Angeles and the harbor. However, there was a drought between 1862 and 1864 which was said to have resulted in the death of 50,000 cattle on Stearns land alone. Stearns mortgaged the rancho to Michael Reese, who then purchased it at a sheriff's sale and Reese's estate then sold it to John W. Bixby and Isaias W. Hellman, a founder of the Farmers and Merchants Bank.\n\nIn 1842 Stearns made the first shipment to the U.S. Mint of California gold on record. On July 8, 1843, his package of 1,843 ounces of placer gold valued at $19 an ounce was deposited in the Philadelphia Mint by Alfred Robinson.[4]\n\nFollowing the Mexican-American War, Abel Stearns represented Los Angeles to the US military government of California, 1848-1850. He was a delegate to the 1849 California Constitutional Convention,[5] representing the district of Los Angeles; later he was California State Assemblyman, and a Los Angeles County Supervisor[6] and a member of the Los Angeles Common Council, the legislative branch of the city government."
