        "text": "La Sierra is a quiet neighborhood of Riverside, but it started\n\nout as a 17,774 acre land grant in 1846 by Mexican Gov. Pio Pico to\n\nVicenta Sepulveda. It was called La Sierra de Santa Ana (the\n\nmountains of Santa Ana). At that time, the grant also included the\n\narea today known as Norco and the west end of Riverside.\n\nThe land was sought by both Maria Vicenta Sepulveda, daughter of\n\nFrancisco Sepulveda, who owned the Rancho San Vicente y Santa\n\nMonica land grant, and Bernardo Yorba, brother of her late husband,\n\nTomas Antonio Yorba, son of Jose Antonio Yorba, the grantee of\n\nRancho Santiago de Santa Ana in what is today Orange County. The\n\nbrothers used the land in La Sierra as pasture, but Bernardo\n\napplied for it when his brother died and claimed interest in the\n\nland had dated from 1825. Pio Pico granted the east half of the\n\nland (La Sierra) to the widow and the west half to Bernardo\n\nYorba.\n\nAbel Stearns, one-time mayor of Los Angeles, who married Arcadia\n\nBandini when she was 14, bought the Rancho La Sierra but sold it\n\nafter an 1863 drought. An interesting note is that Arcadia\n\nremarried to the namesake of Bakersfield, Robert S. Baker, when\n\nStearns died. Other entities then owned it, including the San\n\nJacinto Land Company, before James W. Long bought it in 1908. He\n\nbegan developing the area in 1910 and formed the Orange Heights\n\nWater Company to do so.\n\nLos Angeles businessman Willitts J. Hole bought most of the\n\nrancho and developed the Hole Ranch, building a large mansion\n\ndesigned by Arthur Benton, that is today used as a Catholic\n\nseminary. In 1921, the North Corona Land Company, a subdivision of\n\nthe Corona Land Company, bought some of the land to grow citrus.\n\nThis land became Norco, an abbreviation of the North Corona Land\n\nCompany name.\n\nIn 1922, Hole sold 400 acres to the Seventh-day Adventist\n\nChurch, and in 1942, he sold over 1,200 acres to the U.S. Army to\n\nbuild Camp Anza. Riverside annexed what was left of the rancho land\n\nin 1964.\n\nHole was a real estate developer throughout Southern California\n\nand was known as the father of the city of La Habra. He was born in\n\nIndiana and came to California for his wife’s health concerns. He\n\nbought land in the La Habra Valley and sold the land that would\n\nbecome La Habra. In 1897, he became a selling agent for the Stearns\n\nRancho Company of San Francisco, which owned the Rancho La Sierra.\n\nHole obtained the land by foreclosure.\n\nHole went on to have a boat built, the Samona. The Craig\n\nShipbuilding Company built a steel-hulled, long-range cruiser known\n\nas the Samona II, bought by the U.S. Navy in 1940 and commissioned\n\nthe USS Amethyst. Hole was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in\n\nRiverside.\n\nRiverside County historian Steve Lech said the history of La\n\nSierra wasn’t documented well, but there are reports and books on\n\nFive Points, Willets Hole, the Hole Ranch and Camp Anza.\n\nLa Sierra is home to La Sierra University and the new Riverwalk\n\nCommunity.\n\nReach Nita Hiltner: nhiltner1@sbcglobal.net"
