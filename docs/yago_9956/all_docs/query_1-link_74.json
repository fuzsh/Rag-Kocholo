His work radically redefined the architectural landscape of Southern California—especially San Diego, where his practice was based—and set the stage for a later, more widely celebrated generation of modernists who would continue his experiments with new forms and construction techniques. Gill’s work within an international context: as his identification with the modern movement developed, his work evolved from the influence of the East Coast Shingle Style and Wright’s Midwest Prairie Style to become closer in spirit to the work of the Austrian Adolf Loos. His Los Angeles buildings include the Lewis Courts, Sierra Madre; the Dodge House, Hollywood; and Horatio West Court, Santa Monica. A bachelor until the age of 58, Gill married Marion A Waugh in 1928, but the marriage was unsuccessful.
