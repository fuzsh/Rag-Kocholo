        "text": "Reference: Find A Grave Memorial - SmartCopy: Jun 5 2021, 16:37:10 UTC\n\nbrief biography and family\n\nJuan Bandini was born 4 October 1800 at San Marcos, Lima, Peru, the son of Jose and Isadora Blancas. He appears to have come to California on one of the voyages of his father, either in 1819 or 1821. The younger Bandini entered public life after settling in San Diego and served as representative to Congress in Mexico in 1833 and as administrator of Mission San Gabriel from 1838 to 1840. In 1841 he was sent to supervise the formal dedication of el Pueblo San Juan de Arguello (otherwise known as San Juan Capistrano) staying until March 1842. He also was one of those granted a houselot in San Juan in 1841. In 1845 and 1846 he was secretary to Governor Pio Pico. Don Juan Bandini was grantee of Rancho Tecate on the Baja California border in 1838, of Rancho Jurupa the same year, and of Rancho Rincon and Rancho Caj6n de Muscupiabe in 1839. The latter three were located in the western part of present-day Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. In spite of his ranch holdings and political positions, his fortunes were often reversed. In later years he ran a store facing the plaza in Old Town San Diego (Bancroft 1963, XIX:709) (Wright 1951:VI-VII). On 20 November 1822 in the Chapel of the San Diego Presidio, Juan Bandini married Maria de los Dolores Estudillo baptized 26 May 1805 at San Carlos, the daughter of Jose Maria Estudillo and Gertrudis Horcasitas. The children of Juan Bandini and Dolores Estudillo were: Maria Josefa Ramona Maxima, baptized 23 August 1823 San Diego Presidio, married Pedro Catarina Carrillo, 24 August 1841 San Gabriel, died 5 April 1896 Santa Monica; Alejandro Feliz Rafael, baptized 21 November 1824 San Diego Presidio, buried 11 May 1839 San Gabriel; Maria Arcadia Francisca de Paula, baptized 14 January 1827 San Diego Presidio, married first Abel Stearns on 22 June 1841 at San Gabriel, and second Colonel Robert S. Baker 28 April 1875 Plaza, died 15 September 1912 Los Angeles; Maria Isidora Barbara, baptized 14 September 1829 San Diego Presidio, married Lieut. Cave J. Couts of Tennessee 5 April 1851 San Diego, died 24 May 1897 Los Angeles; Jose Maria.Perfecto, baptized 19 April 1830 San Diego Presidio, married Teresa Argiiello 8 February 1860, died 31 May 1909 Santa Monica; -217- Chapter X - EVERYBODY'S COUSIN Maria de los Dolores [may be the same as \"Isidora\" above], confirmed 6 December 1832 San Diego; and Juan Bautis~aAntonio de Padua, baptized 17November1833 San Diego Presidio, married first Esperanza Sepulveda 15 November 1860 Plaza, second Carolina Moreno 9 March 1871, died 8 September 1905 Santa Monica. The story of how Isadora Bandini \"fell into love\" with Cave Couts goes as follows: Cave Couts, a first Lieutenant of the US forces, born in Tennessee, was part of the US invasion forces in 1846 when they marched into Old Town San Diego. All of the local residents watched. The Bandini girls had been restricted to their house and watched from a second story balcony. As the story goes, Isadora leaned so far against the balcony railing that it gave way, Cave Counts was near enough so that he could catch her as she fell. Thus Isadora met Cave. After the death of Dolores Estudillo about 1834, Don Juan Bandini married Refugio Argiiello on 7 February 1835 at the San Diego Presidio. She had been baptized 10 February 1817 at Santa Barbara, daughter of Santiago Arguello and Maria del Pilar Salvadora Ortega. While Don Juan Bandini spent much time in San Diego and at his Rancho Tecate, he died at the home of his son-in law Abel Stearns in Los Angeles and was buried at the Plaza Church on 5 November 1859. His wife, Refugio Arguello died 29 June 1891 at Santa Barbara. Their children included: Maria de los Dolores Celedonia, baptized 4 March 1836 San Diego Mission, married Charles R. Johnson 16 January 1851 San Diego, died 30 September 1924 Santa Monica; Margarita Josefa Maria Luisa, baptized 18 June 1837 San Diego Presidio, married Dr. James B. Winston 4 December 1860 Plaza, died 29 September 1911 Santa Monica; Juan de la Cruz, baptized 25 November 1838 San Gabriel, died unmarried 9 February 1896 Vista; Alfredo Alejando Abel, baptized 19 April 1849 Plaza, married Guadalupe Monroy about 1877, died 8 April 1879 Los Angeles; and Arturo, baptized 9 August 1853 San Diego Mission, married first Maria Wilson, and second Helen Agnes Elliott on 10 May 1883 San Gabriel, died 16 February 1913 Dolores\n\nDate and place of birth have also been erroneously reported to be:\n\ncirca 1800 in Pennsylvania\n\ncirca 1800 in Italy\n\ncirca 1800 in Spain\n\n1800 at Lima, Lima Province, Lima, Peru\n\nDate and place of death have also been erroneously reported to be November 4, 1859 at Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California, United States."
