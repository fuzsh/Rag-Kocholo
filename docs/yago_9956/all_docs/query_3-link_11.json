        "text": "Historical Notes\n\nThe northern sections of the city of Santa Monica once belonged to Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica and Rancho Boca de Santa Monica. The Sepulveda family sold 38,409 acres of Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica for $54,000 in 1872 to Colonel Robert S. Baker and his wife, Arcadia Bandini de Stearns Baker. Bandini was the daughter of Juan Bandini, a prominent and wealthy early Californian, and was the widow of Abel Stearns, once the richest man in Los Angeles. Baker also bought a half interest in Rancho Boca de Santa Monica. Nevada Senator John P. Jones bought a half interest in Baker's property in 1874.\n\nTo make the town marketable, Jones built a 16-mile rail line between the Santa Monica Bay waterfront and downtown Los Angeles, naming it the Los Angeles and Independence Railroad. It was only the second railroad built in Los Angeles; the first was the Los Angeles and San Pedro, which opened in 1869.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nÂ\n\nIn 1875, John P. Jones and Colonel Robert S. Baker subdivided part of their joint holdings and created the town of Santa Monica. The town site fronted on the ocean and was bounded on the northwest by Montana Avenue, on the southeast by Colorado Avenue and on the northeast by 26th Street. The avenues were all named after the states of the West, the streets being simply numbered. The first lots in Santa Monica were sold on July 15, 1875.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe land was auctioned on July 15, 1875 by the San Francisco Office of the Santa Monica Land Company. The advantages of Santa Monica were emphasized, particularly the superiority of its harbor over that of San Pedro.\n\nThe lots sold for $500 and $750.Â Within a few weeks after the town lot sale a change had come over the barren plain.Â Houses and stores sprang up, a general store was opened and a newspaper started.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe original naming convention for east-west avenues in Santa Monica, established when the townsite was laid out in 1875, used names of Western U.S. states and territories. In later years, many of these street names were changed.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn 1912, Oregon Street became part of Santa Monica Boulevard.\n\nIn 1913, Nevada Street adopted the name Wilshire Boulevard.\n\nIn 1924, Utah Street was renamed Broadway.\n\nIn 1902, Railroad Avenue was renamed Colorado Avenue.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Los Angeles and Independence Railroad (LA&I) opened in 1875. It was a steam powered rail line which travelled from a wharf North of the current Santa Monica Pier in Santa Monica along a private right-of-way to 5th and San Pedro Street in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThe 16.67 miles of track between Los Angeles and Santa Monica were built by John P. Jones without government subsidies or land grants, all in a little over ten months - primarily using 67 Chinese laborers imported for the task. Right-of-way between Los Angeles and Santa Monica was given by local ranchers who were anxious to have access to a railroad. The line opened October 17, 1875, with two trains a day running between Santa Monica and Los Angeles; the fare was fixed at $1.00 per trip, freight at $1.00 per ton.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Los Angeles and Independence Railroad helped make Santa Monica palatable to real estate speculators and prospective residents, but Jones, who was politically well-connected as a U.S. senator from Nevada, had grander plans for the railroad. Intending to connect the line with the town of Independence in the Owens Valley, and from there to a silver mine he owned in the Panamint Mountains, Jones optimistically included \"Independence\" in his railroad's name. Jones, however, encountered financial problems stemming from his mines drying out. He reluctantly sold the Los Angeles and Independence to Collis P. Huntington's Southern Pacific Railroad on July 1, 1877 for $195,000.\n\nClick HERE for more on the Los Angeles and Independence Railroad.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nAs soon as work started on Los Angeles Independence Railroad line from Los Angeles to Santa Monica the construction of a new wharf was begun. This was located near the old \"Shoo Fly\" landing and near the present foot of Colorado Street, where a stub of the old wharf still remains. The first pile was driven April 22nd, 1875, and the first boat landed at the wharf in June. This wharf was 1700 feet in length and reached a depth of thirty feet at low tide. It was substantially built, with depot, and warehouses at its terminus and cost about $45,000.\n\nThe wharf would be sold to Southern Pacific Railway Company in 1877. One short year later, Southern Pacific deemed the wharf unsafe for train usage and by 1888 it was torn down.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Arcadia Hotel opened for business in 1887 and was located on Ocean Avenue between Railroad Avenue (later known as Colorado Avenue) and Front (later known as Pico Boulevard). The Arcadia was the largest structure in Santa Monica at the time of its construction. The 125-room hotel was owned by J.W. Scott, the proprietor of the city's first hotel, the Santa Monica Hotel. The hotel was named for Arcadia Bandini de Baker, the wife of Santa Monica cofounder Colonel R. S. Baker.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nTracks were first laid in Santa Monica in 1875 with the construction of the Los Angeles and Independence Railroad. This steam-powered rail line connected Santa Monica to downtown Los Angeles, running from the Santa Monica Long Wharf north of the current Santa Monica Pier to 5th and San Pedro streets in Los Angeles. This line was intended to serve both freight and passenger purposes, facilitating the transport of mined ore and beachgoers.\n\nThe Los Angeles and Independence Railroad was purchased by the Southern Pacific Railroad on July 1, 1877.\n\nIn 1892, the Southern Pacific Railroad extended the existing tracks, seen above, to their new Long Wharf (completed in 1893) north of Santa Monica Canyon, enhancing the line's capacity to handle larger ships and increasing its importance for freight and passenger transport.\n\nBeach Road became Roosevelt Highway in Santa Monica in 1927. This change was part of a larger effort to develop the highway system along the California coast, and the Roosevelt Highway would later become known as the Pacific Coast Highway (PCH). The railroad tracks along Santa Monica Beach were in use from 1891 until 1933.\n\nIt appears that the majority of beach shacks along Santa Monica's North Beach were removed with the laying of railroad tracks by Southern Pacific in 1892. No photos of these beach shacks have been found after 1892.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Arcadia Hotel opened for business in 1887 and was located on Ocean Avenue between Railroad Avenue (later known as Colorado Avenue) and Front (later known as Pico Boulevard). The Arcadia was the largest structure in Santa Monica at the time of its construction. The 125-room hotel was owned by J.W. Scott, the proprietor of the city's first hotel, the Santa Monica Hotel. The hotel was named for Arcadia Bandini de Baker, the wife of Santa Monica cofounder Colonel R. S. Baker.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Arcadia Hotel was the site where Colonel Griffith J. Griffith shot his wife in 1903, which led to their divorce and his (short) imprisonment.\n\nIn 1882 Griffith moved to Los Angeles and purchased approximately 4,000 acres of the Rancho Los Feliz Mexican land grant. On December 16, 1896, Griffith and his wife Christina presented 3,015 acres of the Rancho Los Feliz to the city of Los Angeles for use as a public park. Griffith called it \"a Christmas present.\" After accepting the donation, the city passed an ordinance to name the property Griffith Park, in honor of the donor. Griffith later donated another 1,000 acres along the Los Angeles River.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Arcadia Hotel was a landmark, hailed as one of the finest hotels in Southern California in its day. However, like many hotels in the area, the Arcadia hotel was forced to close in times of slow business; the hotel closed for one year from 1888-1889, and permanently in 1906 when the building boom subsided. In 1907, there was a failed attempt to convert the hotel into a private school for the California Military Academy, but the property stood abandoned until it was demolished in 1909 to make room for beach improvements, homes, and hotels.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nA special delight for Arcadia Hotel guests was a two-track gravity switchback roller coaster, which in a one minute journey, could whisk guests either to or from the hotel and back again. For five cents, riders would climb a platform to board the large bench-like car and were pushed off to coast 300 ft. down the track across the ravine.Â The car went just over 6 mph.Â At the top of the other platform the vehicle was switched to a return track or \"switched back\" (hence the name).\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Arcadia Hotel opened for business in 1887 and was located on Ocean Avenue between Railroad Avenue (later known as Colorado Avenue) and Front (later known as Pico Boulevard). The Arcadia was the largest structure in Santa Monica at the time of its construction. The 125-room hotel was owned by J.W. Scott, the proprietor of the city's first hotel, the Santa Monica Hotel. The hotel was named for Arcadia Bandini de Baker, the wife of Santa Monica cofounder Colonel R. S. Baker.\n\nThe hotel was built next to a steep cliff and shows only 3 stories on the Ocean Avenue side and 5 stories on the beach side as seen above.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Santa Monica Cycle Path was a pioneering bicycle route in Los Angeles, completed in 1900. It was an 18-mile cycleway that provided a smooth, reliable route from Los Angeles to the coast, specifically Santa Monica. This path was significant as it paralleled the often rutted and poorly maintained wagon roads of the time, offering cyclists a much-needed alternative for safe and efficient travel.\n\nThe cycle path was a six-foot-wide gravel road, closed to all but cyclists and pedestrians. It featured arches that marked the route and prevented buggies and wagons from entering. These arches also carried advertisements to help fund the path.\n\nThe path offered varied scenery, from farmland and meadows to more industrial areas like the Hauser slaughterhouse. It was shaded by newly planted pepper trees, providing a pleasant riding experience.\n\nUpon its opening, the Santa Monica Cycle Path significantly reduced travel time between Los Angeles and Santa Monica. It quickly became popular among cyclists, who previously had to navigate treacherous wagon roads.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe 18-mile Santa Monica Cycle Path was a pioneering dedicated bicycle route that spanned from downtown Los Angeles to the coastal city of Santa Monica. Beginning in the bustling heart of downtown, the path primarily followed Washington Street, which was later renamed Washington Boulevard. This major thoroughfare provided a direct east-west connection through the city. Key intersections along the route included Third Avenue and Western Avenue, which served as significant landmarks for cyclists. As the path continued westward, it traversed the mid-city areas of Los Angeles, an area that was less developed at the time and offered a more open and scenic route for cyclists. Moving further west, the path passed through what is now the Culver City area, still following Washington Boulevard. The route concluded in Santa Monica, providing access to the popular coastal destination and its recreational areas.\n\nWashington Street in Los Angeles was renamed to Washington Boulevard around 1903. The change from \"Street\" to \"Boulevard\" occurred in the early 20th century, with the earliest reference to \"Washington Street\" found in 1860. By 1905, it was already known as Washington Boulevard, as evidenced by reports of it being used as a speedway for horse driving clubs west of Western Avenue.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Santa Monica Cycle Path was built as part of the \"good roads\" movement, spearheaded by the League of American Wheelmen. This movement aimed to improve road conditions across the United States, initially for cyclists but eventually benefiting all road users. Even the fundraising drive for the cycle path doubled as a publicity campaign for the movement; boosters purchased \"good roads\" buttons that they could later wear on their coats in lieu of paying a toll.\n\nThe cycle path intersected Washington Boulevard at Western Avenue. This location was part of the broader route that connected Los Angeles to Santa Monica, making it a crucial segment of the path.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Santa Monica Cycle Path, along with the similar California Cycleway located in Pasadena, were two projects that reflected the cycling boom of the 1890s when Los Angeles had over 35,000 cyclists. They represented early attempts to create dedicated infrastructure for non-motorized transportation, predating the car-centric development that would come to define Los Angeles in the 20th century. While neither project achieved long-term success, they remain important chapters in the history of transportation and urban planning in Southern California.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nOriginally the location of Santa Monica's founding father Senator Jones mansion, the Miramar has provided shelter for rich and famous guests looking for an extended beach stay since the 1920s. Notables include Cary Grant, John F Kennedy, Charles Lindbergh and Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nIn 1924 the six-story Palisades Wing was constructed to provide apartments for guests who planned lengthy stays at the beach. Scandinavian beauty Greta Garbo was one of the first celebrity guests to move into the wing and resided there for more than four years.\n\nSultry blonde Jean Harlow rented one of the Miramar's bungalows in the early 1930s, and years later another famous blonde, Marilyn Monroe, frequently retreated to the Miramar when she wanted to disappear from the media.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nWhen the Southern Pacific Railroad arrived at Los Angeles, a controversy erupted over where to locate the city's main seaport. The SPRR preferred Santa Monica, while others advocated for San Pedro Bay. The Long Wharf was built in 1893 at the north end of Santa Monica to accommodate large ships and was dubbed Port Los Angeles. At the time it was constructed, it was the longest pier in the world at 4700 feet, and accommodated a train.\n\nHowever, just a short four years after the Long Wharf's construction, San Pedro Bay was chosen over Santa Monica to be the main seaport of Los Angeles. Click HERE to see more in Early Views of San Pedro and Wilmington.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nn 1897, San Pedro Bay, now known as the Port of Los Angeles, was selected by the United States Congress to be the official port of Los Angeles (Port of Los Angeles) over Santa Monica. Still, the Long Wharf acted as the major port of call for Los Angeles until 1903. Though the final decision disappointed the city's residents, the selection allowed Santa Monica to maintain its scenic charm. The rail line down to Santa Monica Canyon was sold to the Pacific Electric Railway, and was in use from 1891 to 1933.\n\nClick HERE to see more in Early Views of San Pedro and Wilmington.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nAdjacent to the wharf, and extending northwest to the mouth of Temescal Canyon, a Japanese fishing village was established in 1899 by fisherman Hatsuji Sano on land leased from the railroad. Eventually the home of about 300 Japanese families and a small number of Russians, the village also included two hotels. However, this venture was largely abandoned by 1920, by which time most of the fisherman had moved to Terminal Island and the property was condemned.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Santa Monica Canyon area was experiencing a land boom during the late 1880’s attracting tycoons (either actual or potential) of every industry. One such industrious man was Abbot Kinney who opened the first forestry station in the adjacent Rustic Canyon in 1887. One of his objectives was to test trees, primarily eucalyptus, as cash crops. On 247 acres of land Kinney began planting trees. Despite the success of the trees, it was clear they were not an effective cash crop and Kinney soon sold the property. Notwithstanding a devastating fire in 1904, many of the trees survived creating the plentiful and beautiful eucalyptus groves in Rustic Canyon today. A plaque was dedicated on August 18, 1971, officially designating the eucalyptus groves as a California State Historical Landmark.\n\nClick HERE to see more California HIstorical Landmarks.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nTract planning for residential homes in the Santa Monica Canyon began in 1912. Santa Monica Land Companies owned by Gillis, Sherman, and C.L. Bundy promoted one expensive new tract after another. At the place Where the Mountains meet the Sea (as The Canyon was advertised), the Bundy’s built a bath house with picnic area, refreshments, and dance pavilion. It became the favorite oasis of many until it burned down in 1927.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nPacific Palisades was founded in 1920 by Dr. Charles Holmes Scott of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who sought permanent roots for his religious community. Scott, along with a delegation of Methodist ministers and laymen, purchased 16.6 acres of Rustic Canyon property (then-owned by scholar and widow Julia Edmond) and 11.8 acres of land adjacent to a forestry station. That same year, the Pacific Palisades Association was established to implement Scottâs plans and to further expand the community â in land and in population. January 14, 1922 was Pacific Palisadesâ official âopening day.â\n\nIn 1926, the Pacific Palisades Association purchased the land that was owned by the Huntington family of New York. Both a commemorative gesture and a way to benefit from the prestige associated with the Huntington name, the area was deemed âHuntington Palisades.â"
