        "text": "The United Arab Emirates has approved a COVID-19 vaccine from Sinopharm (OTCMKTS:SHTDY). The China-based pharma company concluded that that the vaccine was 86% effective, putting it ahead of the vaccine performance of the vaccine candidate from AstraZeneca (LON:AZN) but behind the vaccines from Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna (NYSE:MRNA). Both of the latter two vaccines were 95% efficacious.\n\nThe UAE Ministry of Health stated that clinical trial data confirmed that the vaccine had no serious safety concerns. Furthermore, the vaccine was 100% effective at fending off moderate and severe COVID-19 infections.\n\nSinopharm’s vaccine also does not require storage in ultra-cold temperatures, unlike Pfizer’s vaccine.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates’ decision to allow emergency use of the vaccine marks the first time a country outside of China has approved its use. Morocco is also planning a Sinopharm-based vaccination program.\n\nGiven its use in China, the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine is likely the most extensively used globally, with nearly one million people receiving it to date.\n\nBut China, like Russia, had made the vaccine available before Phase 3 clinical trials had concluded. In Nov., Sinopharm submitted the vaccine for final approval.\n\nIn related news, the Sinopharm competitor Sinovac is facing controversy for allegations that its CEO has bribed China drug authorities for vaccine approvals, according to the Washington Post.\n\nFiled Under: clinical trials, Drug Discovery, Infectious Disease\n\nBrian Buntz\n\nAs the pharma and biotech editor at WTWH Media, Brian has almost two decades of experience in B2B media, with a focus on healthcare and technology.
