A 2-dose Sinopharm regime is available.\n\nTo book your vaccination appointment at our Medical Centre and the vaccination price, please call our hotline: 6244 6689 or email enquiries@sata.com.sg the following details to us. We will contact you to allocate your appointment date and time for both your first and second dose.\n\nYour name\n\nNRIC/FIN\n\nDate of birth\n\nContact number\n\nEmail address\n\nWhat technology does Sinopharm vaccine use?\n\nThe Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine uses a traditional inactivated/dead whole virus method. It introduces the surface spike protein of the virus particle to trigger our immune systems to produce antibodies and protect against the live COVID-19 virus.\n\nPfizer-BioNTech/Cominarty and Moderna vaccines use mRNA technology. With mRNA vaccines, part of the COVID-19 genetic code is injected into our bodies, triggering our bodies to begin making viral proteins, but not the whole virus, which is enough to train our immune systems to recognise and fight the virus.\n\nWho is eligible?"
