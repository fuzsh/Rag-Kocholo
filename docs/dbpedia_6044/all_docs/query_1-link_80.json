Now when you search for a target your search results will include the drug profiles indexed with that target term as well as the drug profiles indexed with children of that target term. This is how searching works for other hierarchical parameters like mechanism of action, drug class, etc. You can view the target hierarchy by clicking on “hierarchy view” under Target in the Advanced Search. Coming Soon: Search by target will soon be available for Trial profiles."
