        "text": "On June 27, 2024, the CDC Director adopted ACIP’s recommendations for use of 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccines if authorized or approved by FDA, in people ages 6 months and older. CDC will recommend updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccination for everyone ages 6 months and older. CDC does not expect the interval between doses to differ from 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. CDC will continue to recommend an initial vaccination series for previously unvaccinated children ages 6 months–4 years and people with moderate or severe immunocompromise, as well as additional doses for people of all ages with moderate or severe immunocompromise. For fall 2024, CDC does not expect to initially recommend an additional dose of 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine for people ages 65 years and older who are not moderately or severely immunocompromised. ACIP will continue to evaluate evidence and update recommendations as needed, including for people ages 65 years and older. This page will be updated to align with the new recommendations following FDA approval or authorization of 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccines. Learn more\n\nSome 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccines will expire in summer 2024\n\nExpiration dates vary by manufacturer and vaccine. Always check the expiration date or beyond-use date/time to ensure it has not passed. Never use expired vaccine or diluent.\n\nSee the Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID-19 Vaccines in the United States for information on interchangeability of COVID-19 vaccines."
