        "text": "As the vaccination rates are increasing each day, the majority of countries all over the world have decided to open their borders for travellers who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nNonetheless, since every country’s health authorities have the right to decide on their own regarding the vaccines that they accept for travel, international travel has been complicated lately, VisaGuide.World reports.\n\nTherefore, it is highly recommended that when travelling to another country, everyone checks whether the destination they plan on visiting recognizes as valid proof of immunity the vaccine they have been jabbed with. This can be done by using the vaccine-checker tool developed by VisaGuide.World.\n\nBased on the data gathered from this tool, the following countries allow entry to all those who have been vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine:\n\n[table “81” not found /]\n\nSpain was among the first EU countries that decided to accept Sinopharm as valid proof of immunity. While other countries were allowing entry only to those immunized with an EMA-approved vaccine, the country’s authorities stated back then that all vaccines authorized for marketing by EMA or World Health Organization (WHO) would be accepted.\n\nIs Sinopharm Accepted in the United States?\n\nAs for the United States, until now, the country has authorised the use of Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson vaccines for use. Nonetheless, since the US has been closed for international travellers it is still unclear whether the country will allow entry to those who have been immunized with another vaccine in early November, when the entry ban on 33 world countries, including the UK, Ireland and the Schengen Area countries, is set to end.\n\nIn regards to this, several universities, including Harvard, Colombia, Yale University, and several others, have announced that they would allow students who have been vaccinated with Sinopharm to follow their studies there.\n\nIs Sinopharm Vaccine Accepted in the UK?\n\nAdditionally, the United Kingdom hasn’t approved the Sinopharm vaccine for use. This means that all persons who have been immunized with this type of vaccine are subject to restrictions when entering the UK’s territory. Currently, the UK recognizes only the vaccines that EMA has approved.\n\nThe Sinopharm vaccine was developed by a Chinese state-owned company and got emergency approval by WHO back in May. The vaccine was initially used within China and then was distributed to various other countries, mainly to those with a weaker economy.\n\nIt is recommended that for maximum protection against the COVID-19 disease, everyone over the age of 18 takes the two required doses of the vaccine.\n\nApart from Sinopharm, Sinovac is another vaccine manufactured by a Beijing-based pharmaceutical company. The vaccine is part of the WHO Emergency Use Listing and has been approved for use in 50 countries until now."
