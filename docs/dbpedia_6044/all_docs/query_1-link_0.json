        "text": "Chinese state-owned enterprise\n\nThis article is about the pharmaceutical company. For the COVID-19 vaccine that it developed, see Sinopharm BIBP COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nFor other uses, see Sinopharm (disambiguation).\n\n\"Sinopharm\" redirects here. Not to be confused with Sinovac Biotech.\n\nChina National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation (CNPGC), commonly referred to as Sinopharm, is a Chinese state-owned enterprise. The corporation was the indirect major shareholder of publicly traded companies Sinopharm Group (SEHK: 1099, via a 51–49 joint venture, Sinopharm Industrial Investment, with Fosun Pharmaceutical), China Traditional Chinese Medicine [zh] (SEHK: 570, mostly via Sinopharm Group Hongkong Co., Ltd.),[5] Shanghai Shyndec Pharmaceutical (SSE: 600420, via a wholly owned research institute based in Shanghai), and Beijing Tiantan Biological Products (SSE: 600161, via China National Biotec Group).\n\nChina National Pharmaceutical Group was supervised by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council.[6]\n\nSinopharm was ranked 109th in the 2021 Fortune Global 500 list.[7]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSinopharm was founded as China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation (Chinese: 中国医药集团总公司) on November 26, 1998, as a holding company for China National Pharmaceutical Corporation, China National Pharmaceutical Industry Corporation (Chinese: 中国医药工业公司), China National Pharmaceutical Foreign Trade Corp. (Chinese: 中国医药对外贸易公司) and China National Medical Device (Chinese: 中国医疗器械工业公司). In 2009 it was merged with China National Biotec Group (Chinese: 中国生物技术集团公司).[citation needed]\n\nIts subsidiary Wuhan Institute of Biological Products was fined for selling 400,520 ineffective DPT vaccines in November 2017.[8]\n\nPfizer announced the signing of a cooperation pact with Sinopharm Group in April 2023, with plans to seep approval for 12 drugs in China through 2025.[9]\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Sinopharm BIBP COVID-19 vaccine, also known as BBIBP-CorV,[10] the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine,[11] or BIBP vaccine,[11][12][13] is one of two inactivated virus COVID-19 vaccines developed by Sinopharm. It completed Phase III trials in Argentina, Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with over 60,000 participants.[14] BBIBP-CorV shares similar technology with CoronaVac and BBV152, other inactivated virus vaccines for COVID-19.[15]\n\nPeer-reviewed results published in JAMA of Phase III trials in United Arab Emirates and Bahrain showed BBIBP-CorV 78.1% effective against symptomatic cases and 100% against severe cases (21 cases in vaccinated group vs. 95 cases in placebo group).[16] In December 2020, the UAE previously announced interim results showing 86% efficacy.[17] While mRNA vaccines like the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and mRNA-1273 showed higher efficacy of over 90%, those present distribution challenges for some nations as they require deep-freeze facilities and trucks. BIBP-CorV could be transported and stored at normal refrigerated temperatures.[18]\n\nBBIBP-CorV is being used in vaccination campaigns by certain countries in Asia,[19][20][21] Africa,[22][23][24] South America,[25][26][27] and Europe.[28][29][30] Sinopharm expects to produce one billion doses of BBIBP-CorV in 2021.[31] On 7 May 2021, the World Health Organization approved the vaccine for emergency use[32] and Sinopharm later signed purchase agreements for 170 million doses from COVAX.[33]\n\nThe similarly named Sinopharm WIBP COVID-19 vaccine is also an inactivated virus vaccine.[citation needed]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCanSino Biologics\n\nSinovac\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
