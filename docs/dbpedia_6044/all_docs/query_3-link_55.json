        "text": "Experimental jab is similar to more effective foreign vaccines and is designed to target the Omicron variant.\n\nSun Yat-sen University research, which has not been peer-reviewed, suggests immune response cannot be endlessly boosted and there will be a ‘turning point’ after repeated vaccination.\n\nThe jab shows significantly weaker neutralising activity against the variant than against an older strain, researchers say.\n\nIt is being developed to provide protection against Delta and Beta strains, and clinical trials of a booster shot are also under way, CNBG vice-president says.\n\nInterim phase 3 results suggest two products have efficacy above 70 per cent for symptomatic cases but there is little data on elderly and vulnerable groups.\n\nThe green light given to Sinopharm comes more than four months after the WHO handed out its first emergency use listing for a Covid-19 vaccine to US pharmaceutical company Pfizer and German company BioNTech.\n\nElsewhere, Taiwan will form its first travel bubble of the pandemic with the tiny Pacific nation of Palau, and Japan is to lift a state of emergency in the Tokyo area."
