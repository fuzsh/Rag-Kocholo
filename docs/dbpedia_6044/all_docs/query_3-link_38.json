        "text": "This article is reviewed regularly (on a monthly basis) by Wego’s editorial team to ensure that the content is up to date & accurate.\n\nReviewed 26 November 2021\n\nThe Chinese Sinopharm vaccine has been one of the front-runners from the start of the COVID-19 vaccine race. By now, it has been approved in over 70 countries and is being distributed across the globe. It has also come to the aid of several low and middle-income countries through the COVAX agreement.\n\nKeep reading to find out where the Sinopharm vaccine has been approved.\n\nAbout Sinopharm\n\nThe Sinopharm vaccine is produced by Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological Products Co Ltd, a subsidiary of China National Biotec Group (CNBG).\n\nSinopharm relies on the older but tested inactivated virus technology, which involves taking dead coronavirus and injecting them into the body. The process essentially forces the body to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.\n\nOnce vaccinated, the immune system will be able to respond to an infection of live coronaviruses. Antibodies can stick to and prevent the invading virus from entering the cells in the body.\n\nBased on the available data, the Sinopharm vaccine is reported to have 100 per cent protection from moderate and severe forms of Covid-19. Its overall efficacy rate is 86 per cent. The side effects associated with vaccination in volunteers include pain at the injection site, headache, high temperature or fatigue.\n\nWHO Approval\n\nSinopharm got the WHO’s approval on 7 May 2021 for emergency use, giving the green light for this vaccine to be rolled out globally.\n\nWHO recommends the vaccine for adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of three to four weeks. Vaccine efficacy for symptomatic and hospitalized disease was estimated to be 79%, all age groups combined.\n\nThe emergency use listing (EUL) procedure assesses the suitability of novel health products during public health emergencies. The objective is to make medicines, vaccines and diagnostics available as rapidly as possible to address the emergency, while adhering to stringent criteria of safety, efficacy and quality. The assessment weighs the threat posed by the emergency as well as the benefit that would accrue from the use of the product against any potential risks.\n\nFor COVID-19 vaccines, the UN’s health branch has set the bar for minimum efficacy at 50% in its considerations for evaluation of COVID-19 vaccines. So far, 8 vaccines are approved for use by WHO:\n\nPfizer/BioNTech: Comirnaty\n\nOxford/AstraZeneca: Vaxzevria\n\nJohnson & Johnson: Ad26.COV2.S\n\nModerna: mRNA-1273\n\nSinopharm:
