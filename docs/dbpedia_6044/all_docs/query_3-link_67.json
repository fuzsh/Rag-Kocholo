        "text": "Go To Page 1\n\nCovid-19: China is developing its own mRNA vaccine - and it's showing early promise\n\nThe mRNA vaccines initially generated high levels of protection against getting COVID. And while the protection offered by two doses wanes over time and offers little protection against infection with omicron, the mRNA vaccines appear to offer the best protection against an omicron infection when used as boosters.\n\n17 Feb, 2022, 10:07 AM IST\n\nUAE approves Sinopharm's protein-based vaccine\n\nThe vaccine will be produced and distributed by a joint venture between the UAE's Group 42 and China National Biotec Group (CNBG), a unit of China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), the ministry said in a statement on state media on Monday.\n\n28 Dec, 2021, 12:21 PM IST\n\nChina's Sinovac COVID-19 booster weaker against Omicron: Hong Kong Study\n\nSinovac's CoronaVac and state-owned Sinopharm's BBIBP-CorV vaccine are the two most-used vaccines in China.\n\n23 Dec, 2021, 04:29 PM IST\n\nWHO approves Novavax as 10th authorised Covid jab\n\nIt is made from a more conventional technology than others already approved, which has led officials in Brussels to express hope that this will help persuade those hesitant about vaccination to come forward.\n\n21 Dec, 2021, 11:02 PM IST\n\nMost of the world’s vaccines likely will not prevent infection from Omicron\n\nPreliminary data from South Africa suggest that with omicron, there is a much higher chance of people who already had COVID getting reinfected than there was with the original virus and previous variants.\n\n21 Dec, 2021, 10:04 AM IST\n\nArmenia will allow employers to fire unvaccinated workers\n\nArmenia began its mass vaccination campaign in April with authorities planning to inoculate 700,000 of the country's 2.9 million citizens by the end of the year.
