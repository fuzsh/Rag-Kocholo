        "text": "Criminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.\n\nSome laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. See crimes against minors abroad and the U.S. Department of Justice website.\n\nArrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General immediately.\n\nPRC authorities must notify a U.S. consular officer within four days; however, this does not always occur in a timely manner.\n\nA consular officer may be the only authorized visitor during your initial detention period.\n\nBail is rarely granted.\n\nDetention may last many months before a trial.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General is unable to represent you in a legal matter.\n\nTravelers to the PRC should enroll in the State Department’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) and you may wish to have someone contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General if you are detained.\n\nPlease see the section on DUAL NATIONALITY for the limits on consular notification and access to dual nationals.\n\nSee U.S. Department of State’s webpage for further information.\n\nThe PRC legal system can be opaque and the interpretation and enforcement of local laws arbitrary. The judiciary does not enjoy independence from political influence. U.S. citizens traveling or residing in the PRC should be aware of varying levels of scrutiny to which they will be subject from local law enforcement and state security.\n\nCertain provisions of the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China, such as “social order” crimes (Article 293) and crimes involving “endangering state security” and “state secrets” (Article 102 to 113), are ill-defined and can be interpreted by the authorities arbitrarily and situationally. Information that may be common knowledge in other countries could be considered a “state secret” in the PRC, and information can be designated a “state secret” retroactively.\n\nDrug and Alcohol Enforcement:\n\nPRC law-enforcement authorities have little tolerance for illegal drugs, including marijuana. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs in the PRC are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences, heavy fines, or the death penalty. Police regularly conduct unannounced drug tests on people suspected of drug use and have been known to enter a bar or nightclub and subject all patrons to immediate drug testing. Police may force you to provide a urine, blood, or hair follicle sample on short notice. A positive finding, even if the drug was legal elsewhere or consumed prior to arriving in the PRC, can lead to immediate detention, fines, deportation, and/or a ban from re-entering the PRC.\n\nThe PRC also has strict laws against driving under the influence of alcohol that can lead to immediate detention on a criminal charge.\n\nAssisted Reproductive Technology: In vitro fertilization (IVF) is widely and legally practiced. PRC law, however, strictly forbids surrogacy, and surrogacy contracts will not be considered valid. The use of reproductive technology for medical research and profit is strictly controlled.\n\nContracts and Commercial Disputes: Before entering into a commercial or employment contract in the PRC, have it reviewed by legal counsel both in the United States and in the PRC. The U.S. International Trade Administration can assist you in identifying and vetting business contacts and opportunities but may not intervene in contract disputes. Many U.S. citizens have reported difficulty getting their contracts enforced by PRC courts or being forced out of profitable joint-ventures without opportunity to secure legal recourse in the PRC.\n\nCounterfeit Goods: Do not buy counterfeit or pirated goods. Bootlegs are illegal in the United States, and you may also be breaking local law by purchasing them.\n\nCruise Ship Passengers: Click here for safety information and travel advice.\n\nDigital Payments: The PRC has transitioned to almost a predominantly cashless society. Some mobile phone applications offer a digital payment solution for individuals visiting the PRC on a temporary or long-term basis. Often, payment is made through an individual using their mobile phone to scan a vendor or business’s QR code. The number of locations accepting foreign credit cards has decreased in recent years. Visitors to the PRC should research whether the locations they are visiting will accept foreign credit cards and familiarize themselves with mobile digital payment options prior to traveling to the PRC.\n\nEarthquakes: Earthquakes occur throughout the PRC. Check here for information about preparing for a crisis or disaster overseas.\n\nEnglish/Secondary School Teachers: English teachers in the PRC frequently report employment disputes which can result in questioning by local authorities, termination, lost wages, confiscation of passports, forced eviction from housing, and even threats of violence.\n\nExit Bans: Business disputes, court orders to pay a settlement, or government investigations into both criminal and civil issues may result in an exit ban which will prohibit your departure from the PRC until the issue is resolved. Even individuals and their family members who are not directly involved, or even aware of these proceedings, can be subject to an exit ban. Additionally, some local businesspeople who feel that they have been wronged by a foreign business partner may hire \"debt collectors” to harass, intimidate, and sometimes physically detain foreign business partners or family members in hopes of collecting the debt. The U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General can provide a list of local attorneys who serve U.S. clients but are otherwise unable to intervene in civil cases. Local law enforcement authorities are generally unwilling to become involved in what they consider private business matters and may not provide the individual who has been barred from leaving the PRC with any written notice of the exit ban.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details:\n\nFaith-Based Travel Information\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Reports\n\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices\n\nHajj Fact Sheet for Travelers\n\nBest Practices for Volunteering Abroad\n\nLGBTQI+ Travelers: Same sex marriages are not legally recognized in the PRC and local authorities will not provide marriage certificates to same-sex couples. There are no civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination or harassment based on sexual orientation or gender identity, though homosexuality has been decriminalized. Prejudices and discrimination still exist in many parts of the country. There are growing LGBTQI+ communities in some of the largest cities in the PRC and violence against LGBTQI+ individuals in the PRC is relatively rare. See Section 6 of our Human Rights Practices in the Human Rights Report for the People's Republic of China and read our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page.\n\nNon-Governmental Organizations (NGOs): In January 2017, the PRC implemented a law regulating the operations of foreign NGOs in the PRC. NGOs and their employees should ensure they are complying with all relevant statutory requirements, particularly if working in sensitive areas or fields. Additionally, the PRC government announced sanctions on five U.S.-based NGOs in December 2019.\n\nNorth Korea: Do not travel to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) due to the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention of U.S. nationals. For further information, consult the North Korea International Travel Information page and the North Korea Travel Advisory.\n\nPolitical and Religious Activity: Participating in unauthorized political or religious activities, including participating in public protests or sending private electronic messages critical of the government may result in detention and PRC government-imposed restrictions on future travel to the PRC. Although the PRC constitution permits freedom of religious belief, it does not permit freedom of religious practice and government officials are increasing pressure on domestic religious activities. The U.S. Mission to the PRC has observed an increase in the number of U.S. citizens being interrogated, detained, and/or forced to leave the country in connection with real or perceived religious proselytization. U.S. citizens have been detained and/or expelled for distributing religious literature, including Bibles, or engaging in unauthorized religious meetings. If you bring religious literature with you, local law dictates that it be a “reasonable amount” for your personal use. If you attempt to bring larger quantities, the literature will likely be confiscated and you may be fined, detained, or deported.\n\nSocial Insurance: The PRC has a social insurance system to which foreigners who work in the PRC must contribute. When you sign an employment contract, you must apply for a social insurance number, and it is important that your employer work with you to comply with the regulations. Please check the official website for updated information.\n\nSocial Media: Social media accounts are widely monitored in the PRC. Local authorities may use information they deem critical, controversial, or that might involve illegal activity against both the poster of the material and the host of the social media forum under local law. Individuals have also been held responsible for the content that others place within social media spaces they control, such as the comments section under a post or within a group chat that an individual controls.\n\nSpecial Scrutiny of Foreign Citizens: On occasion, U.S. citizens visiting or resident in the PRC have been interrogated or detained for reasons said to be related to “state security.” In such circumstances, you could face arrest, detention, or an exit ban prohibiting your departure from the PRC for a prolonged period. Dual U.S.-PRC nationals and U.S. citizens of Chinese heritage may be at a higher risk of facing such special scrutiny. Information about dual nationality can be found on our website.\n\nStudents: See our U.S. Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips.\n\nSurveillance and Monitoring: Security personnel carefully watch foreign visitors and may place you under surveillance. Hotel rooms (including meeting rooms), offices, cars, taxis, telephones, internet usage, ​digital payments, and fax machines may be monitored onsite or remotely, and personal possessions in hotel rooms, including computers, may be searched without your consent or knowledge. Security personnel have been known to detain and deport U.S. citizens sending private electronic messages critical of the PRC government.\n\nTransferring Money to/from the PRC: The regulatory environment in the PRC includes tightening capital outflow controls that can severely impact one’s ability to move money out of the country. Wire transfers may only be available to those who have an active bank account in the PRC. Ask your local bank location in the PRC for more information. The U.S. Department of State may be able to help transfer funds to a destitute U.S citizen overseas through our office in Washington, D.C., to a U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate General abroad. More information on this option is available here.\n\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: U.S. citizens with mobility disabilities may face challenges while traveling in the PRC. Sidewalks often do not have curb cuts and many streets can be crossed only via pedestrian bridges or underpasses accessible by staircase. Assistive technologies for blind people and those with other vision disabilities are unreliable, and access to elevators in public buildings can be restricted. In major cities, public restrooms in places visited by tourists usually have a least one accessible toilet. See Persons with Disabilities in the Human Rights Report for the People's Republic of China (2022).\n\nTyphoons: The southeast coast of the PRC is subject to strong typhoons and tropical storms, usually from July through September. For current information, please consult the Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Honolulu and the National Weather Service's Central Pacific Hurricane Center.\n\nWomen Travelers: If you are a woman traveling abroad, please review our travel tips for Women Travelers.\n\nXinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region: Extraordinary security measures are in place through the region. Authorities may impose curfews and restrictions on short notice. They may also engage in invasive surveillance techniques against individuals. Expect significant travel delays, avoid gatherings and demonstrations, always carry ID, and follow the instructions of local authorities. Travelers with ethnic ties to the region may experience special restrictions, discrimination, and even arbitrary detention.\n\nCOVID-19 Entry Requirements: There are no COVID-related entry requirements in place for U.S. citizens.\n\nAs of August 30, 2023, a negative COVID-19 PCR test or rapid antigen test is no longer required for entry. For more information, please see this notice.\n\nNo proof of vaccination against COVID-19 is required for entry.\n\nThere is no quarantine period for travelers upon arrival.\n\nCOVID-19 Testing: U.S. citizens can obtain a COVID-19 test at most hospitals and clinics in the PRC. They can choose between PCR and antigen tests, which are both available. The cost of the test is about $17 U.S. dollars, but it may vary depending on the location. The test fee is not covered by the host government and must be paid by the U.S. citizen. Test results are usually returned within 12 to 24 hours by email, text, or an update to the local COVID-19 monitoring app. For more information, please see this notice.\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccines: Certain COVID-19 vaccines are available for U.S. citizens to receive in the PRC.\n\nThe PRC government has conditionally authorized several vaccines that are currently available to foreigners residing in the PRC. The two most commonly available, Sinopharm and Sinovac, have not yet received approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States. Sinopharm and Sinovac have received approval for emergency use by the World Health Organization (WHO). Please contact your local health authorities for more information.\n\nVisit the FDA's website to learn more about FDA-approved vaccines in the United States.\n\nQuality of Care: The standards of medical care in the PRC are not equivalent to those in the United States. Even in private hospitals or public hospitals with well-equipped wards, English-speaking patients frequently encounter difficulty due to cultural, language, and regulatory differences. Rural areas have rudimentary facilities and inadequate staffing. Additionally, Rh-negative blood may be difficult to obtain; the blood type of the general Asian populace is Rh positive.\n\nPayment and Insurance: Ambulances in the PRC are often slow to arrive, and most do not have sophisticated medical equipment or trained responders. Cash payment for services is often required prior to treatment, including emergency cases. Travelers will be asked to post a deposit prior to admission to cover the expected cost of treatment. Hospitals in major cities may accept credit cards. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General in the PRC maintain lists of local English-speaking doctors and hospitals.\n\nUse of Medicare/Medicaid in the PRC: Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Hospitals and doctors in the PRC often do not accept U.S. health insurance.\n\nMedical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\n\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\n\nMedication: If traveling with prescription medication, check with the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in the United States of America to ensure the medication is legal in the PRC. Carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with the prescription. Many commonly used U.S. drugs and medications are not available in the PRC, and counterfeit, low-quality knockoffs are prevalent. If you try to have medications sent to you from outside the PRC, you may have problems getting them released by PRC Customs authorities and/or you may have to pay high customs duties.\n\nAir Quality: Air pollution is a significant problem in many locations. Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. The PRC’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment also provides its own air quality data for cities throughout the PRC.\n\nMost roads and towns in Tibet, Qinghai, parts of Xinjiang, and western Sichuan are situated at altitudes over 10,000 feet. Take appropriate precautions to prepare for and be alert to altitude sickness.\n\nDisease: The following diseases are prevalent:\n\nInfluenza\n\nTyphoid\n\nMeasles\n\nHepatitis A\n\nHepatitis B\n\nTuberculosis\n\nSexually transmitted infections (e.g., syphilis)\n\nVaccinations: Be up to date on all routine vaccinations recommended by the CDC. The CDC traveler’s health site for the PRC provides vaccine recommendations specific to travel within the PRC.\n\nFor further health information:\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO)\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)"
