        "text": "Even though the COVID-19 Delta variant continues to be highly prevalent in the European continent and further in the world, the majority of the European Union and Schengen Area countries still welcome travellers who have been fully vaccinated against the disease.\n\nHowever, since a large share of the EU/Schengen Area countries does not recognise the vaccine doses other than those approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the travel process has been complicated for quite some time now, .\n\nBased on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) figures, at the moment, all EU countries recognise the vaccine doses approved by EMA – Pfizer/BioNTech (Comirnaty), Moderna (Spikevax), AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria), and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen).\n\nStill, when it comes to the shots that have been listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization (WHO), part of which is Sinopharm, the case is not the same. This is because Sinopharm has not been approved by EMA yet, making it less recognisable within the EU countries.\n\nAccording to the data provided by a new vaccine-checker tool developed by VisaGuide.World, which enables travellers to check the validity of their vaccine, the following EU and Schengen Area countries accept Sinopharm as valid proof of immunity against COVID-19:\n\nAustria\n\nCyprus\n\nGreece\n\nHungary\n\nIceland\n\nNetherlands\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nFinland\n\nSwitzerland\n\nSpain is among the first countries to recognise the Sinopharm vaccine. While the other countries were permitting entry only to travellers immunised with an EMA-approved vaccine, back at that time, the country’s authorities highlighted that “any vaccine authorised for marketing by the European Medicines Agency, EMA and WHO will be accepted”.\n\nIn order to facilitate the travel process and in support of the free movement, Netherlands also decided to permit entry to all persons vaccinated with Sinopharm. The Netherlands accepts a vaccination certificate that indicates that the holder has been immunised with Sinopharm as long as the document contains all the necessary information.\n\nSimilarly, the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare announced that all travellers vaccinated with a vaccine approved by EMA or WHO are considered fully immunised when entering the country. As a result, those who are vaccinated with Sinopharm do not need to follow quarantine rules when travelling to Finland.\n\n>> Which COVID-19 Vaccines Are Recognised for Travel to Finland\n\nAs for Austria, even though the country recognises Sinopharm as a valid proof of immunity, the authorities have noted that travellers vaccinated with the shot are not allowed to enter hotels, restaurants, or access other services while in the country.\n\n“Sinovac/Sinopharm are not valid for entering hotels, restaurants etc., within Austria,” the Austrian authorities explained.\n\nSeveral EU countries now also accept mixed COVID-19 vaccine doses. Earlier today, it was reported that among the countries that recognise combinations of shots are Denmark, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, and Norway.\n\nExcept for the countries mentioned above, other countries located in the continent of Europe that also recognise Sinopharm as valid proof of immunity are:\n\nGeorgia\n\nNorth Macedonia\n\nMontenegro\n\nSerbia"
