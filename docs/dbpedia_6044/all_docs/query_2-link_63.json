        "text": "LETTER FROM CENTRAL EUROPE\n\nIn front of the brand new factory, which shows no sign of activity, three flags – Chinese, Emirati and Serbian – are in tatters, due as much to the effects of passing time as to the weather. \"Don't take a picture of them, we'll replace them soon,\" said the security guard, the only sign of life in the empty parking lot of this Chinese vaccine factory, located a few kilometres from Belgrade airport in Serbia. The government-built road gleams immaculately, but the only perceptible traffic in the vicinity is that of landing planes.\n\nSlated to open in March 2022, this plant was to be the first in Europe to produce Sinopharm, the Chinese vaccine against Covid-19. But on Tuesday, November 8, it still seems a long way from being able to manufacture \"40 million annual doses\" and employ \"180 people,\" as promised by the Serbian president at the time of the construction site's launch in September 2021.\n\nWhen President Aleksandar Vučić came to break ground on the project, he brought with him the Chinese ambassador to Serbia as well as representatives of Hayat Biotech – an Emirati company and Sinopharm joint venture – promising to open the plant six months later.\n\nRead more Subscribers only European Union approves Sanofi's Covid-19 vaccine\n\n\"A regional miracle,\" boasted Mr. Vučić, a former nationalist who has dominated the political landscape of this Balkan country since 2014 by skillfully playing to various international geopolitical interests, all the while insisting that he wishes to join the European Union (EU) as soon as possible.\n\nDuring the pandemic, he massively imported Chinese Sinopharm and Russian Sputnik V vaccines, ignoring European scientific reticence. This ensured him a certain popularity in his country, which has maintained, ever since the Yugoslav wars, a mistrust of anything from the West. In his enthusiasm, he then promised to produce the two vaccines on Serbian territory, but this \"miracle\" seems to have turned into a mirage with the decline of the epidemic and the scientific victory of Western vaccines.\n\n'I don't think it's for vaccines'\n\nThe state-owned national vaccine production institute Torlak, a glorious legacy of the Yugoslav period, was selected to bottle Sputnik V and had begun this work in June 2021, again on the watch of Mr. Vučić. \"The humanity shown by Russia to Serbia is an indication of the quality of political relations between our countries. Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich [Putin], it is a great honor and privilege for me to launch the production of the Russian-Serbian vaccine with you,\" the president declared in front of the cameras, tugging on the Serbs' historical pro-Russian cord."
