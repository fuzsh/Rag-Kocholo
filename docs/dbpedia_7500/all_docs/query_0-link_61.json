        "text": "When you learn Italian, it feels like there's so much to do, right?\n\nYou have to wrap your head around tricky grammar like the subjunctive and the Italian past tenses. As well as wrap your tongue around Italian sounds and pronunciation!\n\nBut what is it that really helps you blend in with native speakers when you talk to them?\n\n…mastery of the finer points of Italian grammar?\n\n…having read Dante's Inferno directly in Italian?\n\n…perfect Italian pronunciation?\n\nHow about none of the above?\n\nThe quickest and easiest way to speak more native-like Italian and sound like an Italian is to use Italian slang phrases.\n\nWith a few expressions under your belt, be they slang, idioms or dialect, you can quickly sound less like a textbook and more like an Italian.\n\nPlus you won't have to bug your Italian friends to ask them to explain expressions to you!\n\nWith that in mind, I've put together a big list of 30 need-to-know Italian slang expressions to help you fit in with the natives.\n\nAs you'll see, some of these phrases are specific to particular regions. And some of them are idioms, rather than slang. Don't worry, I'll explain all that first, and then we'll get to the list so you can start learning and using these phrases.\n\nBy the way, do you want to go beyond Italian slang phrases and learn Italian with confidence and fluency?\n\nYep. I thought so.\n\nThe best way to do so is by working through a comprehensive and well designed course.\n\nMy top recommendation for beginners is Italian Uncovered, my in-depth online Italian course for beginners that teaches you through StoryLearning®. Click here to try out this innovative method for free.\n\nOr if you're already at an intermediate level, I suggest Conversations, which will teach you lots of colloquial Italian phrases – exactly the kind of thing you'll hear and use in real conversations with real people.\n\nAnyway, back to Italian slang…\n\nWhy Italian Dialects Matter\n\nCompared to other parts of Europe, Italy is a relatively new country. The Italian peninsula consisted of several different states with changing borders until it was unified as the Kingdom of Italy in 1861.\n\nWith unification came the need for a common language. The Modern Italian that we know and love today most reflects the language that was spoken in the Toscana (Tuscany) region of Italy.\n\nIt was considered the “most beautiful” dialect because it was the one used by the beloved writer Dante, of Divine Comedy fame.\n\nFrom that point forward, italiano nazionale (standard “national” Italian) was used in schools and businesses. Today it's truly the common language.\n\nThe regional dialetti (dialects), however, remain. They're mixed with standard Italian in homes throughout Italy.\n\nA few of the biggest Italian dialects include:\n\nVeneto (spoken in Venice and throughout the Veneto region)\n\nRomanesco (spoken around Rome)\n\nNapoletano (spoken around Naples)\n\nand Siciliano (spoken in Sicily)\n\nIf you visit Italy, you’ll find that it isn’t just your nonna who speaks dialetto. Dialects also influence the vast majority of Italian slang!\n\nYou'll see that in a second in the list of Italian slang phrases. I've pointed out which ones are particular to specific regions.\n\nWhat Are Idioms Anyway?\n\nAs you study Italian do you ever feel like you’ll be hitting the books until you kick the bucket?\n\nWait, what?\n\nIdioms are phrases like “hit the books” and “kick the bucket” that don’t literally mean what we mean when we say them. When you use an idiom and you think about the actual meaning of what you’re saying, it can be pretty funny.\n\nItalian has idioms as well. And they’re usually not direct translations of our English idioms.\n\nBrushing up on Italian idioms is a great way to make sure you’ll fit right in with the natives.\n\nWhy Learn Italian Slang?\n\nWhen you’ve been studying Italian in a classroom setting, idioms and slang can be one of the biggest obstacles when transitioning into real life conversation. Real life Italian speakers talk casually sometimes, just like speakers of any language.\n\nIf you take the time to read up on some Italian idioms and slang before you take a trip to Italy, you’ll feel more comfortable with your new Italian friends because there will be one less barrier between you!\n\nYou’ll also sound more like a native speaker and less like a foreigner!\n\nSo, with that in mind, let's get straight to my list of the thirty most commonly used Italian slang phrases.\n\nTop 30: Italian Slang\n\n1. Mettere La Paglia Vicino Al Fuoco\n\nThis phrase literally means, “to put a straw in the fire.” Colloquially it means, “to tempt fate.”\n\n2. Essere Del Gatto\n\nThis phrase literally means, “to be of the cat.” Colloquially it means, “to get in trouble.”\n\n3. A Fagiolo\n\nLiterally, “to the bean.” You use it when something happens right in the perfect moment or comes up in the perfect situation.\n\n4. ‘Ndom!\n\nYou’re most likely to hear this in Northern Italy. It’s a dialectic shortening of andiamo (let’s go).\n\n5. Facimme ‘Na Cosa ‘E Juòrne\n\nThis one is Napolitano. It translates to, “let’s do this by daylight.” It means, “hurry up!” The implication is that if you don’t hurry, it’ll be dark before you get where you’re going!\n\n6. Bedda/Beddo\n\nIf you’re in Sicily and you hear someone call you bedda, you might just blush! This is the dialectic pronunciation of bella (beautiful).\n\n7. Dai\n\nThis is a conjugated form of the verb dare (to give). But you’ll hear it all the time and it means something different. If someone says, “dai,” they mean “come on!”\n\n8. Meno Male\n\nThis directly translates to “less bad,” but it means, “Thank goodness!”\n\n9. Che Figata\n\nThis directly translates to, “what a big fig!” It means, “how cool!”\n\n10. In Bocca Al Lupo\n\nLiterally, “in the mouth of the wolf.” This is a somewhat superstitious way to tell someone good luck. It’s sort of like the English phrase, “break a leg.”\n\n11. Crepi\n\nThis shortening of crepi il lupo (may the wolf die) is the proper response to in bocca al lupo.\n\n12. Boh\n\nBoh means simply, “I don’t know.”\n\n13. Libro Giallo\n\nThis directly translates as “yellow book,” but it refers to mystery novels.\n\n14. Limonare\n\nLiterally “to lemon,” (not a verb other than in this slang form), this means “to make out”.\n\n15. Essere Alla Frutta\n\nThis expression means to be at the very lowest, to hit rock bottom. It can also mean to have reached the end (because the fruit is typically the last dish in a meal).\n\n16. Avere Le Mani In Pasta\n\nThis literally means “to have one’s hands in the pasta.” It’s a phrase you’d use to describe someone who is all up in everyone else’s business.\n\n17. Figurati\n\nThis means, “no worries!”\n\n18. Mi Fa Cagare\n\nThis is an expression of disgust or distain that can be used in any number of situations. It directly translates to, “That makes me poop.”\n\n19. Bon / Va Bon\n\nIn the Veneto region, you might hear someone say this instead of bene or va bene.\n\n20. Amunninni\n\nLike ‘ndom in the North, this means andiamo (let’s go) in Sicily.\n\n21. Spacchuiso\n\nThis is the Sicilian dialect word for “cool” (hipness, not temperature) that has become part of the regular vernacular.\n\n22. Nuotare Nell’oro\n\nThis means literally, “to be swimming in gold.” If you’re doing this, you have a lot of money.\n\n23. Alzare Il Gomito\n\nThis literally means, “to raise the elbow.” It means “to take a drink.”\n\n24. Bischero\n\nThis is a word used in Tuscany to mean someone is a jerk.\n\n25. Essere Nelle Nuvole\n\nLiterally, “to be in the clouds.” This means, “to daydream.”\n\n26. Saputo/a\n\nThis comes from the verb sapere (to know) and is a name for a know-it-all.\n\n27. Sei Scemo\n\nThis means, “you’re shrinking,” but it’s something you can say to tell someone they’re being mean.\n\n28. Fare Il Grande\n\nLiterally, “to do the big.” If you’re doing this, you’re acting like you’re a big deal.\n\n29. Avere Un Chiodo Fisso In Testa\n\nLiterally, “to have a nail fixed to one’s head.” This means you are obsessed with something.\n\n30. Tirare Un Bidone\n\nLiterally, “to throw a trash can,” this is the phrase for standing someone up on a date.\n\nYou've reached the end of this list of Italian slang and idioms. But, if you've enjoyed it, then you'll probably also enjoy my post on 82 basic Italian phrases to survive your first conversations with a native speaker.\n\nTime To Try Out Your Italian Slang In Conversation\n\nSo, you've got your list of Italian slang phrases.
