        "text": "Ancora (“Yet”)Proprio (“Really”)Appena (“Just”)Subito (“Immediately”)Finalmente (“Finally”)Certamente (“Surely”)Già (“Already”)Forse (“Maybe”)Mai (“Never”)Nemmeno (“Not even”)Sempre (“Always”)Probabilmente (“Probably”)Spesso (“Often”)Sicuramente (“Definitely”)\n\nEva ha appena mangiato la mela… (“Eva just ate the apple…”)\n\nNon ho ancora letto il giornale. (“I haven’t read the newspaper yet.”)\n\nVoglio sicuramente studiare l’italiano con ItalianPod101. (“I definitely want to study Italian with ItalianPod101.”)\n\nDevo proprio chiedere scusa…? (“Do I really have to apologize…?”)\n\n4. Prepositional Phrases\n\nIn most sentences, we end up referring to “when,” “where,” and “how” the action is taking (or took) place. These sentences are the ones that explain the when, where, and how, and they’re called prepositional phrases since they’re often introduced by a preposition.\n\nStudio l’italiano di sera. [when?] (“I study Italian in the evening.”)\n\nStudio l’italiano a Firenze. [where?] (“I study Italian in Florence.”)\n\nStudio l’italiano con ItalianPod101. [how?] (“I study Italian with ItalianPod101.”)\n\nAs you can see in the examples above, these phrases normally go at the end of the sentence, although with most of the phrases indicating the time aspect of the action (when?), you can safely move the elements around, just as you would in English:\n\nStudio l’italiano di sera. [when?] (“I study Italian in the evening.”)\n\nDi sera studio l’italiano. [when?] (“In the evening, I study Italian.”)\n\nA pranzo non bevo mai il caffè. [when?] (“For lunch, I never have coffee.”)\n\nNon bevo mai il caffè a pranzo. [when?] (“I never have coffee for lunch.”)\n\nBut, if you’re not sure, always place them at the end of the sentence, and you’ll definitely be correct.\n\nIf you want more information on Italian prepositions, be sure to take a couple of minutes to watch the video below:\n\n5. Personal Pronouns\n\nRemember the first sentences we looked at?\n\n{Eva mangia una mela.} (“Eva eats an apple.”)\n\n{Studi l’italiano.} (“You study Italian.”)\n\nSubject, verb, object. In that order. Well…not always. If you substitute the object with a personal pronoun, that pronoun would still be the object of the action, but it goes BEFORE the verb. Take a look:\n\n{Eva la mangia in fretta.} (“Eva eats it in a hurry.”)\n\n{Lo studi con ItalianPod101.} (“You study it with ItalianPod101.”)\n\nHelp! I need a Personal [pronoun] Trainer!!!\n\nThe same rules apply to indirect personal pronouns, as in:\n\nGli chiedo un favore. (“I ask a favor of him.”)\n\nMi piace la pizza. (“Pizza pleases me.“= “I like pizza.”)\n\nThis is also true for the little pronouns ci (“in it,” “there”) and ne (“of it”).\n\nA Roma? Ci andiamo domani. (“To Rome? We go there tomorrow.”)\n\nHa del prosciutto? Ne vorrei 100 grammi. (“Do you have ham? I would like 100 grams of it.”)\n\nThings, however, change a little when we have these same pronouns, but the verb is an infinitive, a gerund, or an imperative. (Maybe you need a little more practice with those tenses or how they’re conjugated?\n\nBecause with these tenses, the pronoun can be placed either before or after. And in case it’s after, you need to attach it to the verb. Let’s see how:\n\n{Eva mangia una mela.} (“Eva eats an apple.”)\n\n{Eva la mangia in fretta.} (“Eva eats it in a hurry.”)\n\n{“Eva, mangiala!} (“Eva, eat it!”)\n\n{Studi l’italiano.} (“You study Italian.”)\n\n{Lo studi con ItalianPod101.} (“You study it with ItalianPod101.”)\n\n{Puoi studiarlo con ItalianPod101.} (“You can study it with ItalianPod101.”)\n\nA little patience and lots of exercise: the perfect strategy for learning a language!\n\n3.

Let’s start with a very basic sentence, and we’ll add up elements of complexity.
