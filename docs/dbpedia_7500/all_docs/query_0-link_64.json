Having a wide vocabulary foundation is one of the most important aspects of learning a language and navigating everyday life in another country.\n\nYouâll be able to better understand directions (for example, metro lines are often defined by a color), do better shopping (if youâre a fashion enthusiast, Italy is great!) and just generally describe any object to Italian speakers.\n\nPlus, the tables for âred in Italianâ and âyellow in Italianâ will be invaluable if you like to attend wine tastings!\n\nUnderstanding expressions and proverbs\n\nThere are many idioms and informal expressions that include the names of colors in Italian. Knowing them will surely help you recognize them and start using them too. If you want a list of the most common ones, we got you covered, read on!\n\nAppreciating Italian art\n\nItaly is famous all over the world for its art, and it is a well-deserved fame. Anywhere you go, from the smallest mountain village to seaside towns, youâll find frescos, statues, and paintings by famous artists.\n\nIf you love art, then understanding the Italian descriptions of these works of art will bring you great satisfaction. Learning the many shades in Italian is undoubtedly a great start!\n\nColors in Italian\n\nLetâs get started then. First of all, how do you say âcolorâ in Italian? Here the âjust add a vowel at the end if you donât know a wordâ rule works: il colore (eel coh-loh-reh) is the singular and i colori (ee coh-loh-ree) the plural.\n\nColors can be nouns or adjectives.\n\nItalian English Il rosso Ã¨ il mio colore preferito. Red is my favourite color. Il libro rosso Ã¨ mio. The red book is mine.\n\nWhen they are adjectives, like in the second example, they go after the object they describe.\n\nTo add a description of the color, for example, if it is light or dark, you can add chiaro (light) and scuro (dark) after the color.\n\nItalian English Il quaderno verde chiaro Ã¨ di Giacomo. The light green book is Giacomoâs. Ho un cappello blu scuro. I have a dark blue hat.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you want to ask what color something is, use:\n\nDi che colore Ã¨ â¦ ?\n\nDi che colore sono â¦ ?\n\nWith some of the specific names of colors that youâll find in the table, youâll need to use the expression: âcolor ___â\n\nItalian English La sciarpa Ã¨ color lavanda. The scarf is lavender.\n\nColors can also take diminutives, this usually makes them âlighterâ: Il pigiama giallino (the light yellow pyjamas).\n\nPurple in Italian\n\nPurple in Italian is viola. This is not only the name of a color â a viola or violetta is also a flower!\n\nItalian English Le viole fioriscono dallâautunno alla primavera. Violets flower from fall to spring.\n\nAnd it doesnât end there. Viola or Violetta in Italian is also a girlâs name.\n\nItalian English Mia figlia si chiama Viola. My daughterâs name is Viola.\n\nSo from fruits to flowers, weâve got you covered for some wonderful shades of purple.\n\nEnglish Italian Pronunciation Lavender lavanda lah-vaan-dah Purple viola vee-oh-lah Violet violetto vee-oh-let-toh Grape uva ooh-vah Mauve malva maal-vah Mulberry mora moh-rah Plum prugna prooh-nya Lilac lilla leel-lah Indigo indaco een-dah-coh\n\nRemember to keep in mind that Viola does not change its ending according to the subject described, like some colors do. It always stays the same.\n\nOrange in Italian\n\nOrange in Italian is arancione which is also sometimes called arancio (like an orange tree!). Careful, though, the fruit is feminine: arancia.\n\nEnglish Italian Pronunciation Tangerine mandarino maan-dah-ree-noh Orange arancione ah-raan-choh-neh Amber ambra ahm-brah Bronze bronzo brohn-dzoh Burnt Orange rosso aragosta roh-ssoh ah-rah-goh-stah Marmalade arancio scuro ah-raan-choh scoo-roh Mango mango maan-goh Rust ruggine roo-jee-neh Papaya papaya paa-paa-yah\n\nAgain, Arancione does not change its ending according to the subject described, like some colors do. It always stays the same.\n\nBlue in Italian\n\nThere are two main ways of saying blue in Italian: blu and azzurro. The first describes a darker color, while azzurro is usually light blue.\n\nEnglish Italian Pronunciation Royal Blue blu reale blooh reh-ah-leh Blue blu blooh Turquoise turchese toor-keh-seh Teal tÃ¨ blu blooh Cyan ciano chah-noh Sky Blue azzurro ah-dzur-roh Navy Blue blu marino blooh mah-ree-noh Baby Blue celeste cheh-less-teh Midnight Blue blu notte blooh noh-tteh\n\nSimilarly, Blu does not change its ending according to the subject described like other colors do. It always stays the same.\n\nAzzurro, on the other hand, does.\n\nRed in Italian\n\nIf you want to be able to order a good bottle of wine, you need to know how to say red in Italianâ¦ Rosso!\n\nRed in Italian is one of the colors that change their ending according to what they describe, like a typical adjective.\n\nEnglish Italian Pronunciation Burgundy bordeaux bohr-doh Red rosso ross-soh Cherry rosso ciliegia ross-soh chee-lyeh-jah Crimson cremisi creh-mee-seeh Brick Red rosso mattone ross-soh maatt-oh-neh Blood Red rosso sangue ross-soh saan-gweh Maroon granata grah-nah-tah Berry rosso scuro ross-soh scoo-roh Scarlet scarlatto scaar-laat-toh\n\nYellow in Italian\n\nGiallo is âyellowâ in Italian. This color is also used to talk about thriller/crime books or films:\n\nItalian English Sto leggendo un giallo. I am reading a crime novel.\n\nGiallo changes its ending according to what youâre describing: giallo, gialla, gialli, gialle.\n\nEnglish Italian Pronunciation Lemon limone lee-moh-neh Yellow giallo jaal-loh Cream crema creh-mah Canary canarino cah-nah-ree-noh Chartreuse chartreuse shar-treus Gold oro oh-roh Light Yellow giallo chiaro jaal-loh kyah-roh Sand sabbia saab-byah Mustard senape seh-nah-peh\n\nBrown in Italian\n\nTo describe something brown in Italian, you need to use the word marrone, or marron. This is also a word to say âchestnutâ, the actual fruit.\n\nIf youâre talking about someoneâs brown hair or eyes, however, we prefer to use capelli/occhi castani.\n\nEnglish Italian Pronunciation Caramel caramello cah-rah-mell-loh Brown marrone maar-roh-neh Sepia seppia sehp-pyah Chestnut marrone castagna maar-roh-neh cass-tah-nyah Chocolate cioccolato choc-coh-lah-toh Almond mandorla maan-dorr-lah Cedar marrone scuro maar-roh-neh scoo-roh Coffee caffÃ¨ caaf-fÃ¨h Walnut noce noh-cheh\n\nRemember that Marrone does not change its ending according to the subject described, like other colors do. It always stays the same.\n\nPink in Italian\n\nRosa, which is âpinkâ in Italian, also is a flowerâ¦ Guess which? Yes, of course, itâs the word for âRoseâ. Itâs also a girlâs name.\n\nEnglish Italian Pronunciation Peach pesca pehs-kah Pink rosa roh-zah Coral corallo coh-rall-loh Rouge rouge rooj Magenta magenta mah-gen-tah Salmon salmone saal-moh-neh Blush rosa chiaro roh-zah kya-roh Hot Pink fucsia fook-syah Strawberry rosso fragola ross-soh kya-roh\n\nRosa does not change its ending according to the subject described like other colors do.

It always stays the same.\n\nBlack in Italian\n\nNero is the Italian for âblackâ.

This describes white wine (vino bianco) and, in its feminine singular form Bianca (yes, it changes according to gender and number, becoming bianca, bianchi, bianche) is also a girlâs name.\n\nFor example, Biancaneve (Snow White!)\n\nEnglish Color in Italian Pronunciation Beige Beige behj White bianco bee-ann-coh Ivory avorio ah-voh-ryoh Eggshell guscio dâuovo goo-shoh doo-oh-voh Coconut cocco cock-oh Pearl perla perr-lah Bone osso oss-soh Alabaster alabastro ah-lah-bass-troh Off white bianco sporco bee-ahnn-coh sporr-koh\n\nFree downloadable paper chatterbox\n\nThis fun paper chatterbox will help you learn Italian colors in no time!
