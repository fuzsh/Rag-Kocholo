        "text": "The average Italian vocabulary lists the definitions for about 200,000 lemmas. However, native Italian speakers can get by with just a tiny fraction of that huge number. You can actually live in the country if you know as little as 7,000 words.\n\nIn this lesson, we’ll cover the 100 most common Italian words you’ll need to know as a foreigner. We’ve selected the ones that are more useful for practical purposes.\n\nWe’ll also look at plenty of example sentences to help you learn these words more easily. Let’s get started!\n\nThe 100 most common Italian words\n\n10 Italian words you will use on a daily basis\n\nciao hello, bye buongiorno good morning, good day buonasera good evening arrivederci goodbye sì yes no no grazie thanks, thank you prego you’re welcome mi scusi excuse me, sorry per favore please\n\nIn Italy, ciao is an informal greeting you use with friends and family. Buongiorno and buonasera are polite greetings. You can also use ciao to part ways in informal settings. If you need to say bye to your boss or a stranger, use arrivederci. This literally means “to see each other again”.\n\nSì and no are the translations for “yes” and “no”, respectively. If you need to write them, make sure you put an accent mark on sì, because si is a different Italian word.\n\nGrazie and prego are the words for “thank you” and “you’re welcome”. If you want to say “yes, please”, you actually have to use sì, grazie. This literally translates as “yes, thank you”. I know it may sound strange, but that’s the way it goes in Italy!\n\nIf you want to apologize or ask something of a stranger, use mi scusi. It works for both “sorry” and “excuse me”. If you want to ask a favor, use per favore, which literally means “for favor” but translates as “please”.\n\nExamples:\n\nBuongiorno signor Rossi, come sta?\n\nGood morning Mr. Rossi, how are you?\n\nVuoi del tè? – Si, grazie.\n\nWould you like some tea? – Yes, please.\n\nMi scusi, sa dove trovo la stazione degli autobus?\n\nExcuse me, do you know where the bus station is?\n\nThe 10 most important Italian verbs\n\nessere to be avere to have stare to stay fare to do andare to go venire to come dovere must, have to potere can, be able to volere to want sapere to know\n\nEssere and avere are used in compound verb tenses like some Italian past tenses (ho mangiato, “I have eaten”), while stare is used in the gerund mood (sto mangiando, “I am eating”).\n\nThe four Italian modal verbs are dovere, potere, volere and sapere. Unlike other verbs, these can be followed by a verb in the infinitive mood (the basic form of Italian verbs ending in –are, –ere and –ire).\n\nExamples:\n\nSono andato in farmacia.\n\nI went to the pharmacy.\n\nSto leggendo un libro giallo.\n\nI am reading a crime book.\n\nDevo pulire i piatti entro sera.\n\nI have to do the dishes by evening.\n\nEnrico sa suonare la chitarra.\n\nEnrico can play the guitar.\n\nThe 10 most common Italian words for asking questions\n\ncosa, che cosa what chi who dove where quando when perché why come how quanto how much quanti how many come mai how come a che ora at what time\n\nIf you want to ask a question in Italian, you don’t have to change the order of the subject and verb or add a helper verb. All you need to do is add a “?” at the end of the sentence.\n\nStefano abita in quella casa.\n\nStefano lives in that house.\n\nStefano abita in quella casa?\n\nDoes Stefano live in that house?\n\nYou’ll probably use the interrogative pronouns cosa, chi, dove, quando, perché and come the most. These always come first in the question, just like their English translations. It’s a good idea to learn these well because you’ll probably use them pretty much daily, likely more than once. Here are a few examples:\n\nCosa vuoi mangiare per cena?\n\nWhat would you like to eat for dinner?\n\nChi ha mangiato l’ultimo pezzo di torta?\n\nWho ate the last piece of cake?\n\nDove ho lasciato i miei occhiali?\n\nWhere did I leave my glasses?\n\nQuando partirai per Parigi?\n\nWhen are you leaving for Paris?\n\nPerché il cane si morde la coda?\n\nWhy is the dog biting its own tail?\n\nCome si scrive questa parola?\n\nHow do you spell this word?\n\nQuanto costa una bottiglia d’acqua?\n\nHow much does a bottle of water cost?\n\nThe 10 most common Italian words for travelling\n\nstazione (ferroviaria) (train) station aeroporto airport valigia/bagaglio suitcase/luggage biglietto ticket museo museum treno train autobus bus hotel hotel chiesa church camera doppia/singola single/double room\n\nIf you ever get the chance to visit Italy, you’ll probably need to get your bearings. This section and the next will help you avoid getting lost.\n\nYou can use these words in lots of different ways, but there are a few common sentences and questions you’ll often hear or need to ask, such as:\n\nQuanto costa un biglietto per…?\n\nHow much is a ticket to…?\n\nDove posso comprare…?\n\nWhere can I buy…?\n\nVorrei prenotare una camera singola/doppia.\n\nI would like to book a single/double room.\n\nHo perso il mio bagaglio!\n\nI lost my luggage!\n\nDevo arrivare all’hotel…\n\nI have to get to the hotel…\n\nHo perso l’aereo / il treno / l’autobus.\n\nI missed the plane / the train / the bus.\n\nThe 10 most common Italian words for going places\n\nvia street strada road piazza square città city paese small town sinistra left destra right dritto straight ahead casa home chilometro kilometer\n\nYou also need to know how to read directions. Use a sinistra to translate “to the left”, and a destra to say “to the right”. If someone says you need to andare dritto, it means you have to “go straight ahead”.\n\nIf you need to ask where something is or you happen to get lost, you can say:\n\nDove si trova…?\n\nWhere is…?\n\nMi sono perso!\n\nI got lost!\n\nSto cercando Via Manzoni.\n\nI’m looking for Via Manzoni.\n\nSa dirmi come raggiungere Piazza Navona?\n\nCan you tell me how to get to Piazza Navona?\n\nJust a quick note: If you’re used to calculating distances in miles, remember that the numbers you see on Italian road signs are always in chilometri, which is the Italian word for kilometers. So, “BERGAMO 12” means that the city of Bergamo is 12 kilometers away, even if no unit is given. A kilometer is about 0.62 miles.\n\nThe 10 most common Italian words for talking about time\n\ngiorno day sera evening notte night ora hour minuto minute oggi today domani tomorrow ieri yesterday mese month settimana week\n\nYou need to know how to answer the question quando?, “when?”. It’s a pretty common question in Italian, so it’s worth learning how to respond. Here are some common questions and sentences for talking about time:\n\nChe ore sono?\n\nWhat time is it?\n\nChe giorno è oggi?\n\nWhat day is today?\n\nA che ora chiude la banca?\n\nWhat time does the bank close?\n\nCome si dicono i giorni della settimana in italiano?\n\nHow do you say the days of the week in Italian?\n\nFind out how to say the days of the week in Italian here! 😉\n\nThe 10 most common Italian words to go shopping\n\nsupermercato supermarket cassa check-out, cash register carrello shopping cart spesa grocery shopping borsa bag carne meat pesce fish pane bread frutta e verdura fruits and vegetables carta di credito credit card\n\nIf you’re grocery shopping in Italy, it’s good to know some of the most common words you’ll find in supermarkets.\n\nAnother quick note: If you’re planning on staying in the country for a while and doing your grocery shopping almost every day, make sure you bring your own tote bag. Supermarkets, supermercati, will charge you 2-10 cents for every compostable bag you request at their place (they used to be free!), and the cost can add up pretty quickly.\n\nThat said, here are a few common sentences you need to know:\n\nPosso pagare con carta di credito?\n\nCan I pay by credit card?\n\nDov’è il reparto della carne / del pesce?\n\nWhere is the meat/fish department?\n\nDov’è la cassa?\n\nWhere is the cash register?\n\nMi sa dire dov’è il supermercato più vicino?\n\nCan you tell me where the nearest supermarket is?\n\nThe 10 most common Italian words for eating out\n\nristorante restaurant pizzeria pizzeria menù menu primo first course secondo main course dolce dessert tavolo table forchetta fork cameriere waiter conto bill\n\nA full Italian meal is made up of three parts: il primo (first course), il secondo (main course) and il dolce (dessert). If you want to reserve a table, just say:\n\nVorrei prenotare un tavolo per… due/tre/quattro.\n\nI would like to reserve a table for… two/three/four.\n\nOnce you’ve finished your meal, it’s not typical for Italian waiters to bring the bill to your table unprompted. You’ll have to ask for it directly or walk up to the cash register yourself. Eating out is a social event, and waiters will let you stay for as long as you like without rushing you to leave! To ask for the bill, just say:\n\nMi porta il conto, per favore?\n\nWould you bring me the bill, please?\n\nIt’s also pretty common for people to drop their fork or some other piece of cutlery on the floor by accident. If that happens, just call for the waiter with cameriere, mi scusi (do NOT shout!) and then say:\n\nMi porterebbe una nuova forchetta?\n\nWould you bring me a new fork?\n\nOr un nuovo cucchiaio, if you need a spoon. Or a new glass, un nuovo bicchiere.\n\nThe 10 most common Italian words for talking about relationships\n\nfamiglia family mamma mom papà dad fratello brother sorella sister ragazzo boy, boyfriend ragazza girl, girlfriend uomo man donna woman bambino/a child (m/f)\n\nFratello and sorella are the Italian words for “brother” and “sister”, but there’s no word in Italian that translates “sibling”. You’ll have to use either of the two, while in the plural you have to say fratelli e/o sorelle, “brothers and/or sisters”.\n\nIf you’re talking about a little boy, use bambino. For little girls, use bambina. You’ll also find the masculine/feminine distinction in ragazzo (“boy”) and ragazza (“girl”). These can also be used to translate “boyfriend” and “girlfriend”.\n\nHere are some common sentences you might come across:\n\nHai fratelli o sorelle?\n\nDo you have any brothers or sisters?\n\nQuanti siete in famiglia?\n\nHow many of you are in the family?\n\nIl papà e la mamma sono sposati.\n\nDad and Mom are married.\n\n10 beautiful Italian words\n\nAt last, you’re going to learn some Italian words that will put a smile on your face!\n\namore love felicità happiness sorriso smile auguri best wishes compleanno birthday amico friend cane dog gatto cat fiore flower cuore heart\n\nIsn’t it interesting how cuore, the Italian word for “heart”, and amore, rhyme? 🙂 The same goes for fiore, “flower”.\n\nTo wish happy birthday to someone, use buon compleanno. If you want to say “best wishes” instead, you can simply say auguri or also tanti auguri, literally “many wishes”.\n\nExamples:\n\nTanti auguri di buon compleanno!\n\nMany happy birthday wishes!\n\nChi è il tuo amico del cuore?\n\nWho is your BFF?\n\nCuore e amore fanno rima.\n\n“Cuore” and “amore” rhyme.\n\nHo raccolto un bel fiore.\n\nI picked a beautiful flower."
