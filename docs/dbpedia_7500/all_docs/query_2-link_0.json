For example reading a hard boiled noir has such a specific style that you’d never go all Hardy when describing something in nature (if the natural world is even talked about in noir!).\n\nI like to use lyrical and poetic description in my prose and am realising this might be antithetical to the style of Giallo. Even tho it’s only a film style and not a literary one.\n\nI used a phrase about long marsh grasses painting the sky like calligraphy pens but realise this is incongruous.\n\nSo, whilst knowing that Giallo is a movie style and not a literary on, what kind of syntax etc would you anticipate?\n\nmsstice\n\n200 words a day = 1 novel/year\n\nJoined\n\nMar 27, 2020\n\nMessages\n\n905\n\nMay 29, 2024\n\n#2\n\nNot knowing what Giallo is (I thought you misspelled Gallileo) I am a tabula rasa that will accept what ever style you inflict upon me.\n\nSwank\n\nand debonair\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 25, 2022\n\nMessages\n\n2,190\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#3\n\nApparently Giallo is also a novel form.\n\nI wonder if a more noir-ish form would work? \"Skies painted in by fountain-pen grass blades.\" You know, get rid of the simile and keep it sparse.\n\nTeresa Edgerton\n\nGoblin Princess\n\nJoined\n\nNov 1, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n15,786\n\nLocation\n\nCalifornia\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#4\n\nHow do the characters in the movie speak.

The series consisted almost exclusively of Italian translations of mystery novels by British and American writers. These included Agatha Christie, Ellery Queen, Edgar Wallace, Ed McBain, Rex Stout, Edgar Allan Poe, and Raymond Chandler.[4][5][6]\n\nUrsa major\n\nBearly Believable\n\nJoined\n\nAug 7, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n24,060\n\nLocation\n\nEngland\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#6\n\nI'm already imagining what Phyrebrat might do with Agatha Christie's hard-boiled prose.\n\n​\n\nPhyrebrat\n\nwww.beanwriting.com\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 13, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n6,124\n\nLocation\n\nIn your bedroom wardrobe...\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7\n\nMrs McGinty lay afloat the one surviving door of her armoire.

I think you're allowed to be lyrical, but nine times out of ten you want to be do so in a succinct, laconic manner.\n\nedit: I remember once reading that one novelist used \"the sun pounded me like a gorilla with a banana\" or something for their Chandler-esque writing. Pithy and graphic lyricism, that's the key."
