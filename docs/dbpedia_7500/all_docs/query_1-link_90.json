If you're eager to dive into the world of Italian cooking while also picking up some Italian language skills, YouTube is a treasure trove of resources.\n\nFrom entertaining Italian chefs to authentic Italian recipes passed down through generations, there's something for everyone.\n\nHere are 10 YouTube cooking channels that offer a delightful blend of delicious recipes and Italian learning.\n\n1. Pasta Grannies\n\nPasta Grannies travels around Italy searching for Grannies (Nonne) who are still cooking for their families and happily sharing their culinary wisdom.\n\nBritish creator Vicky Bennison started Pasta Grannies in 2014, and in 2019, the first Pasta Grannies cookbook was introduced. She has interviewed and fimed more than 400 grannies and watching these amazing Nonne will bring you nothing but joy.\n\nThe shows have English subtitles when the Nonne are speaking, and there is an English narrator for the rest.\n\n2. Ricette Della Nonna\n\nThis is such a simple beautiful channel to watch, especially if you love Italy and Italian food.\n\nWatching Nonna Maria makes you feel like you are part of the family…just hanging out in the kitchen cooking with Grandma, making pizza and pasta dishes. So amazing.\n\n3. Giallo Zafferano\n\nThis channel is maybe the most famous one on the list. Giallo Zafferano, which means “Yellow Saffron” in Italian, has been around since 2006.\n\nGiallo Zafferano’s “ricette per bambini” (recipes for kids) are also great to watch with your little ones because they are quite unique and fun.\n\nGiallo Zafferano is available in English and Spanish on YouTube now as well.\n\n4. Cook Around Recipies\n\nThis Italian cooking channel was created by a Luca Pappagallo with the idea of trying to kindle a passion for cooking in those who've never wielded a pan before.\n\nYou'll find a vast array of original, delectable dishes: from appetizers to main courses, and desserts, spanning both Italian and international cuisines.\n\nThe channel is a joy to watch…especially if you need to awaken your guests' appetite.\n\n5. Vincenzo’s Plate\n\nThis channel is fantastic! Vincenzo's Plate Italian recipes are in English, but he is 100% Italian. He sometimes has his Italian Nonna in them too, which is always a pleasure to watch.\n\nIf you go to his website, you can get information about his tours in Italy, as well as cooking classes you can take (if you happen to live in Sydney, Australia).\n\n6. Cucina Con Noi (cucinaconoi)\n\nThis is an interesting channel. There are some videos that have speaking, but most of the videos that I have seen are just of the cooking with Italian subtitles that tell you the cooking instructions.\n\nThis is kind of a neat way to learn basic Italian vocabulary, not to mention all the yummy Italian food you get to see being made.\n\nThey have an English YouTube channel as well. They also have a website (In Italian) with all of their recipes.\n\n7. Laura in the Kitchen\n\n'Laura in the Kitchen' is an interactive cooking program led by Laura Vitale. While the spotlight is on Italian cuisine, viewers are also encouraged to share their requests.\n\nYou'll notice that many of the recipes featured on the show stem from audience suggestions.\n\n8. The Pasta Queen\n\nNadia Caterina Munno's \"The Pasta Queen\" offers a delightful and authentic exploration of traditional Italian food recipes and culinary traditions.\n\nHer family history traces back to ancestors who owned a pasta factory in southern Italy, instilling in her a profound appreciation for pasta making. Growing up surrounded by her grandparents' winemaking and the bountiful harvests of fresh ingredients, she developed a love for fresh, seasonal, rich ingredients.\n\n9. Authentic Italian Cooking\n\nBased in Mandello del Lario at Lake Como, this channel provides access to quality ingredients sourced from all over Italy, ensuring they are 100% natural, embodying the concept of \"a chilometro zero.\"\n\nAuthentic Italian Cooking is a channel focused on preparing the best Italian food recipes in their original form, while also being open to adding a slight personal touch.\n\nMost recipes shared on the channel are easy to prepare, taking approximately 20 minutes.\n\n10. Buon-A-Petitti\n\nThe channel name \"Buon-A-Petitti\" cleverly combines the phrase 'Buon Appetito' with Gina's surname, 'Petitti'. Born in 1935 in Faeto, Italy, a province of Foggia in the Puglia region, Gina delights in preparing food for her family using traditional methods passed down from her mother and grandmother in Italy.\n\nShe also embraces new culinary techniques learned from family and friends in the US. Apart from cooking, Gina finds joy in gardening and actively participates in her church community. Her cookbook, 'Cooking with Grandma Gina', is readily available on Amazon.\n\nWhy Start Learning Through Delicious Italian Recipes\n\nLearning Italian through delicious Italian recipes on YouTube can be a unique and immersive experience.\n\nAs you delve into the culinary delights of Italy, you're likely to encounter an entertaining Italian chef infusing their videos with charisma and charm, making the learning process enjoyable.\n\nFrom traditional dishes passed down through generations in an Italian family to innovative twists on classic recipes, you'll gain insight into the amazing Italian cuisine.\n\nWhether you're starting to learn Italian or seeking to practice your language skills, trying some of these Italian recipes offers a dynamic way to engage with vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation—all for free.\n\nHow to Make the Most of Your Learning Experience on YouTube\n\nLearning Italian through YouTube videos opens up a world of possibilities for language learners.
