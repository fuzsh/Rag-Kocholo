Take the first letter of each color word to memorize the order of the colors in a rainbow.\n\nVIBVGAR is the Italian take on this little trick.\n\nWhen I break it up into Vib V Gar, it almost seems like a character’s name—cue the mental picture of a colorful unicorn!—so the sequence pops instantly into my head. I know it’s silly but it works for me; hopefully it’ll work for you, too.\n\nBelow are the names of the colors in Italian, following Vib V Gar. You can make these colors more specific by adding chiaro (light) or scuro (dark) after, like with verde scuro (dark green).\n\nWe’ve also included some other common colors that aren’t part of the rainbow.\n\nViola — Violet\n\nGli occhi viola sono adorabili.\n\n(The violet eyes are lovely.)\n\nIndaco — Indigo\n\nEven though indaco technically means dark blue, it’s used more commonly than blu scuro (dark blue).\n\nLe sue orecchie indaco sono bellissimi.\n\n(Her indigo ears are beautiful.)\n\nBlu — Blue\n\nNuvole blu la circondano.\n\n(Blue clouds surround her.)\n\nVerde — Green\n\nL’erba verde cresce sotto di lei.\n\n(Green grass grows beneath her.)\n\nGiallo — Yellow\n\nLe sue ali gialle sbattano.\n\n(Her yellow wings flutter.)\n\nArancione — Orange\n\nIl suo corno arancione è lucido.\n\n(Her orange horn is shiny.)\n\nRosso — Red\n\nLa sua pelliccia rossa è bellissima.\n\n(Her red fur is beautiful.)\n\nNero — Black\n\nLa notte è così nera.\n\n(The night is so black.)\n\nMarrone — Brown\n\nL’orso marrone è enorme.\n\n(The brown bear is huge.)\n\nRosa — Pink\n\nMi piace il rosa.\n\n(I like pink.)\n\nBianco — White\n\nLe colombe bianche sono per i matrimoni.\n\n(White doves are for weddings.)\n\nAzzurro — Light blue, blue\n\nA special note about azzurro, the color that’s so very important in Italy.\n\nAzzurro is a shade of light blue that’s so well-loved it’s actually the Italian national color. The national football (that is, soccer) team is named Gli Azzurri (The Blues) because of their blue jerseys. And a wildly popular song is titled “Azzurro.”\n\nLa squadra indossa l’azzurro.\n\n(The team wears light blue.)\n\nThe Grammar of Colors in Italian\n\nRemember that color words are adjectives, so they’re used to describe or clarify nouns. In Italian, adjectives usually follow the nouns they modify.\n\nItalian adjectives must agree with the gender—masculine or feminine—state of the noun they describe. Colors are no exception!\n\nFor instance, take a look at these two examples:\n\nla scarpa rossa (the red shoe)\n\nun cane rosso (a red dog)\n\nThe first noun, “shoe,” is feminine in Italian while the second, “dog,” is masculine. Notice how the adjective changes its ending based on the noun it’s modifying.\n\nFinally, Italian adjectives also agree with the noun in number—singular or plural:\n\nun cane rosso (a red dog) → cani rossi (red dogs)\n\nMasculine adjectives end in -o and change their ending to -i in their plural form. Feminine adjectives end in -a and become plural by changing the ending to -e.\n\nAs always, there are exceptions to these rules. There are a few colors (blu, viola, rosa, indaco) that don’t change in gender or number.\n\nMi piace leggere i romanzi rosa.\n\n(I like to read romance novels.)\n\nCompro le scarpe blu.\n\n(I’m buying blue shoes.)\n\nA good way to become familiar with how to use color words in Italian is by practicing writing your own sentences. You could also use an immersion program like FluentU to find more examples of this vocabulary used in context.\n\n8 Colorful Italian Expressions\n\nNow it’s time to learn some fun Italian expressions that can definitely add to your language skills. They’re common in Italian songs, literature and movies so you may have already heard some of them!\n\nIl principe azzurro — Light blue prince\n\nWhile this romantic phrase literally means “light blue prince,” it’s not used to describe a blue royal.\n\nIt does, however, imply that a man is someone special—a Prince Charming!\n\nIl suo ragazzo è davvero un principe azzurro!\n\n(Her boyfriend is a real Prince Charming!)\n\nEssere nero — To be black\n\nThe literal translation, to be black, refers to a mood. The expression is commonly used to describe someone when they’re upset or angry.\n\nNon prestare attenzione a lui. È nero.\n\n(Don’t pay attention to him. He’s in a bad mood.)\n\nUna mosca bianca — A white fly\n\nCommon houseflies are black so when something or someone is called una mosca bianca (a white fly) it means that they’re unique.\n\nWhile most of us wouldn’t think that being called an insect is a good thing, in this case it’s a real compliment!\n\nLa moglie di Enzo è una mosca bianca.\n\n(Enzo’s wife is exceptional.)\n\nLa pecora nera — the black sheep\n\nThis expression is familiar in many languages.\n\nLoosely translated, this common idiom refers to a family member who’s unlike the others. It can imply rebelliousness or a desire to do things in a less-than-typically-desired manner. The connotation is generally unfavorable.\n\nIt sounds especially melodious in Italian, doesn’t it?\n\nJoe è la nostra pecora nera.\n\n(Joe is our black sheep [of the family].)\n\nFarne di tutti i colori — to be up to all sorts of things; mischief\n\nIn this case, “colorful” refers to doing all sorts of things. Think of shooting the breeze with your friends or kids hanging out.\n\nLoro continuano a farne di tutti i colori.\n\n(They continue to be up to all sorts of things.)\n\nEssere in rosso — to be in red\n\nBeing “in the red” isn’t an expression used only by Italians. It means to be short on money.\n\nIl mio portafoglio è vuoto. Sono in rosso!\n\n(My wallet is empty. I am in the red!)\n\nAnima nera — black soul\n\nWhether or not you believe in souls, this is a way of saying that someone is wicked.\n\nÈ un uomo cattivo con un’anima nera.\n\n(He’s a bad man with a wicked soul.)\n\nDama bianca — white lady\n\nThis phrase is another word for fantasma (ghost). Specifically, dama bianca is referred to as an eerie “vision” that’s said to foretell death.\n\nSta’attento! Ho sognato dellla dama bianca ieri sera!\n\n(Be careful! I dreamt about the white lady last night!)\n\nLife in Italy is molto colorata (very colorful), and the Italian language can describe everything so vividly that it comes to life. This goes for imaginary rainbow unicorns, too!\n\nNow that you’re familiar with colors and how to use them, you should be able to paint pictures with your words.\n\nBuona fortuna! (Good luck!)"
