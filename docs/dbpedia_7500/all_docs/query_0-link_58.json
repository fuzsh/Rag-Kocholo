        "text": "Italian (italiano) is the official language of Italy and San Marino, and one of the four official languages of Switzerland, spoken mainly in the cantons of Ticino and Grigioni. It is a co-official language in Istria, a coastal region of Slovenia and Croatia. Furthermore, it is the primary language of the Vatican City, where it is co-official with Latin, and is widely used and understood in Monaco, Corsica, Malta, Albania, and Romania. It is also used outside of Europe in parts of Libya and Somalia.\n\nIn most of the touristy resorts along Italy's coasts, English and German are widely spoken, but in any part of Italy, it will hold you in good stead to know at least basic phrases of polite Italian and not to assume that whoever you are speaking with will know your language.\n\nItalian is the most important language in classical music, with most operas being written in Italian, and musical notation on scores being primarily in Italian. All musicians who play Western music are required to be familiar with Italian musical terminology, and it was de rigeur for European composers from the Renaissance to the first half of the 20th century to have at least some basic knowledge of Italian.\n\nIf you speak Spanish or even Portuguese, be careful as there are a lot of words that look and sound almost the same in these languages but convey very different meanings: for example, Spanish guardar (\"to store, shelve\") vs. Italian guardare (\"to see, watch\"), Spanish salir (\"to get out\") vs. Italian salire (\"to go up\"), Spanish burro (\"donkey\") vs. Italian burro (\"butter\"), Spanish caldo (\"soup\") vs. Italian caldo (\"hot\"), Spanish aceite (\"oil\") vs Italian aceto (\"vinegar\") and Spanish sembrar (\"to sow, plant\") vs Italian sembrare (\"to seem\").\n\nGrammar\n\n[edit]\n\nNouns\n\n[edit]\n\nAll Italian nouns are assigned one of two genders: masculine or feminine. Unlike in English, even inanimate objects are assigned a gender (e.g. tavolo [table] is masculine, casa [house] is feminine). The article before a noun depends on its gender: e.g. il (m for most cases), lo (m if word starts with s + consonant, z, gn, ps, pn, x, y and consonant clusters), la (f for most cases) or l' (if word starts with a vowel). Likewise, third person subject pronouns also depend on the grammatical gender of the subject : lui/egli/esso (m) and lei/ella/essa (f).\n\nAdjectives\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Italian, adjectives must agree in gender and number with the noun or pronoun they modify. So for example, the word for \"child\" in Italian is bambino (masculine), plural bambini, or bambina (feminine), plural bambine. If you want to say \"a small boy\", you'd use un piccolo bambino, whereas two small boys would be due piccoli bambini, a small girl would be una piccola bambina and two small girls would be due piccole bambine. If a group of children you are speaking of includes both boys and girls, use the masculine plural form. Unlike English, Italian has no capitalized adjectives, so, for example, \"Italian\" is always represented in lowercase in Italian, but again must agree in gender and number: un bambino italiano; una bambina italiana.\n\nFormal and familiar pronouns\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Italian, you use the polite form of you (\"lei\") with all the people you don't know; it doesn't matter whether they are older or younger than you, unless they are children. You'll use the familiar form (\"tu\") with the people you know and with children. The two forms differ in that 2nd person singular verb forms are used for \"tu\" and 3rd person singular verb forms are used for \"lei\" (which can also mean \"she\").\n\nAddressing people\n\n[edit]\n\nThe formal way to address a man you meet for the first time is signore, while the equivalent when addressing a woman is signora. Signorina may sometimes be used to address a very young, unmarried woman, but unless you are absolutely sure, it is best to default to signora. The corresponding plurals are signori (all-male and mixed male and female groups) and, somewhat confusingly, signore (all-female groups). The Italian equivalent for the salutation \"ladies and gentlemen\" is thus \"signore e signori\". In informal situations, these terms are frequently dispensed with.\n\nPossessives\n\n[edit]\n\nEnglish speakers are used to using possessive pronouns before nouns, as in \"my book\" or \"your car\". In Italian, things are usually a bit more complicated. With the exception of individual family members (mia moglie is \"my wife\"; suo figlio is \"his/her son\"), these kinds of phrases are replaced by article + possessive pronoun + noun, and both the article and the pronoun must agree in gender and number with the noun being modified. For example, \"my book\" would be il mio libro; \"your car\" would be la tua macchina; \"our houses\" would be le nostre case. If you leave out the article, people will understand you, but it's good to be prepared to hear native speakers use these kinds of common phrases even before you are comfortable enough to use them yourself."
