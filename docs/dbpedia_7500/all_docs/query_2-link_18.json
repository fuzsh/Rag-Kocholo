        "text": "So as far as movie watching is concerned, things seem to have returned to normalcy (or at least what passes for what we call “normal” here in Castle Podferatu). Let’s jump right in.\n\n3/3 The Psychic\n\nI do love a non-zombie Fulci flick. The original Italian title translates as Seven Notes In Black which A) is just and objectively better title and B) just screams giallo (another of my other great cinematic loves). Virginia begins having visions of a murder in a room in the abandoned mansion she and her husband own and which she is renovating. I won’t give away any more details or how all the dream-like pieces finally fall into place. Ending is a little predictable, but somehow that’s just not bothersome for me on this one.\n\n3/5 Lurking Fear\n\nOkay, don’t get me wrong. Charles Band? Full Moon Features? Huge fan. But that doesn’t mean I can get behind every single thing Full Moon ever did (lookin’ at you Killer Eye. Yeah, see what I did there? Oh! Eye did it again).\n\nDespite the efforts of Jeffrey Combs and Vincent Schiavelli, this one never got off the ground for me. I’m pretty skeptical when it comes to Lovecraft adaptations and more so when the words “loosely based on” enter the mix. This is touted as loosely based on Lovecraft’s “The Lurking Fear.” In this case, the phrase “loosely based” is loosely based on the meaning of the phrase “loosely based,” cuz damn. Without being told ahead of time, I might never have put together this was a Lovecraft story.\n\n3/5 Harry Brown\n\nAlong with horror, noir, giallo, and westerns, I do love a good vengeance flick. In this case, a pensioner avenges the murder of his pub mate. It’s a little sad, a little bleak, but justice is meted out appropriately. Plus it’s Michael Caine. How can you go wrong?\n\n3/6 The McPherson Tape\n\nSo yeah I guess I went down a little alien rabbit hole and watched this right after Things Unknown. This little found footage flick had me right up until the last maybe 3 minutes or so. If you watch, you’ll see why. It’s just jarringly anticlimactic. The story itself isn’t bad, the tension is okay, and the whole thing is kinda fun until it’s not. Oh well.\n\n3/6 Things Unknown\n\nThis surprised me. On their way home from Burning Man, web show hosts Brad, Anne, and Neil stop to camp at a spot in the desert that Anne used to go to with her mother. I really enjoyed this one, and it gave me wwwaaayyy more than I expected from it. The less you know goin’ in, the better, so go have a look. Currently available on Tubi.\n\n3/7 Sunday In The Country\n\nI’m not sure where or how I came across the title of this weird little 1974 John Trent movie. It’s a pretty standard “bad guys picked the wrong house” setup, but there’s something about Borgnine’s character, Adam, that gives the ol’ knife just a little bit of a twist. It’s not that Adam is batshit crazy. It’s more like one of his gears is missing a cog. But when it comes to protecting himself and is, Adam fer sure don’t mess around. Well worth a watch over on YouTube.\n\n3/10 Mama\n\nA stockbroker loses everything which drives him to kill his coworkers and estranged wife and abscond with his daughters, ages 3 and 1, ostensibly to kill them and himself. He crashes his car, and the end up in an abandoned cabin. As he steels himself to kill his daughters, his plan goes awry. Again, I won’t give any more away. This had some genuinely creepy moments, especially early on with the youngest daughter. There’s some disappointing CGI, the plot treads some familiar ground, and the end is a little cheap. But overall, not a waste of time.\n\n3/13 Berlin Syndrome\n\nI stumbled across this whilst compiling stuff for next week’s vacation episode. It looked interesting, so I watched it, and it was interesting. It leans heavily on the whole Stockholm Syndrome idea. I’ve read that the novel of the same name by Melanie Jooster does this to an even greater degree. At almost 2 hours it can drag a bit here and there, but it’s a compelling story.\n\n3/16 The Child\n\nOdd little chunk of evil child grindhouse fare with some genuinely creepy bits. Rosalie is telekinetic and is “friends” with these zombie-like things in the nearby graveyard. A nanny has come to take care of Rosalie at the behest of the widower father. The zombies or whatever the hell they are (it’s never really made clear) under Rosalie’s control have a decent enough look, and there are some nicely handled practical effects. Of note, the Rob Zombie song “Sick Bubblegum” starts with a quote from Werewolves On Wheels. In like fashion, the “I don’t have to tell you anyting” line in “What?” was pulled from The Child.\n\n3/19 Shrooms\n\nWe recently recorded one of our double features, mainly so we could talk about this particular movie. Jorge brought it up whilst recording another upcoming episode, and I was gobsmacked. I’ve only heard one other person besides me talk about this movie, so I was overjoyed that it was on Jorge’s radar as well. This movie is a trip in a very literal sense of the word. A bunch of college kids go visit a friend in Ireland specifically to go harvest some special mushrooms. Sadly, there is also a very close lookalike that has severe effects. You can imagine what happens from there. Director Paddy Breathnach does a fine job blurring the line between hallucination and reality. The end may be a little old hat, but the movie is pretty out there and well worth a look.\n\n3/19 Double Blind\n\nSo we needed something else for a double feature, and this looked promising. Claire and six other youngish folks are in a drug trial. Some are repeat subjects (which is apparently kind of a thing). Well, this one starts going horribly wrong. Whoda thunk? One major complication is that they can’t fall asleep. If they do, they’ll die. This of course clicks right into my creepypasta proclivities and all the Russian sleep experiment stories. It’s also got overtones of 2022’s Sleep Experiment, loosely based on the aforementioned material. Double Blind is pretty good. Shrooms is more fun.\n\n3/21 The Revenge Of Frankenstein\n\nEverything left for March was mainly homework. We plan/planned to record a Frankenstein focused episode as well as a dive into the Stepfather franchise. I knew I’d be talking about at least a couple Peter Cushing/Hammer Frankenstein flicks. I’ve seen them all, but a couple were a little fuzzy, so I felt a rewatch was in order. This is the one where Frankenstein’s assistant, the deformed Karl, volunteers to have his brain transplanted into a tall, strappin’ new body (not one pieced together). It’s a success, but the new body starts to conform to the body as remembered by Karl’s brain. It’s a fun one, has some Dr. Moreau vibes, and a cute little gotcha ending.\n\n3/28 The Curse Of Frankenstein\n\nWell, before The Revenge, there was The Curse. This one is mainly another adaptation of the novel. Not half bad, but a weird choice for the creature: Christopher Lee. Understandably, at 6 feet 5 inches, Lee is one towering creature, but he was also quite the looker, so to ugly him up is a little bit of a shame. Overall it’s a serviceable adaptation. It doesn’t do anything particularly new or exciting, but it’s fun enough.\n\n3/29 The Stepfather\n\nI remember not being a huge fan of this back in 1987. After a rewatch, I may have misjudged it a bit. O’Quinn does a fine job as the unhinged Henry Morrison/Jerry Blake. Jill Schoelen (Cutting Class, Popcorn) turns in a more or less decent performance as Stephanie. Shelly Hack is, well, about as Shelly Hack as she is in everything else she’s ever been in. But as a slasher/mystery goes, it holds together okay. What I like in particular is how little details make Jerry start to come unglued, something you don’t see much of. The Dentist does this nicely too for example. One of the better moments is his mini-breakdown before bashing Shelly Hack with a phone. And for those of you who fret about these thing (as I do), the dog does not die.\n\n3/29 Stepfather 2\n\nOf course, Jerry survives the end of Stepfather. Of course, he escapes from the psychiatric institution he ends up in. Of course, he starts all over again. This time it’s Carol (Meg Foster–if you don’t recognize the name, you’ll recognize the eyes) and her son. There’s a nice but somewhat obvious giveaway at the end of the movie involving the song Jerry (now calling himself Gene Clifford) always whistles. Oh, and Matty (Caroline Williams–yup, Stretch) is entertaining and wily and ultimately too smart for her own good."
