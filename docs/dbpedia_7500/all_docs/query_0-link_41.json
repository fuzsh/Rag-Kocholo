        "text": "How to Talk About: Movies and TV in Italian\n\nHow to talk about movies and TV in Italian: Important Italian phrases and vocabulary you need to know when talking about the shows you watch with Italian friends and colleagues!\n\nThis blog series, “How to Talk About… in Italian” will focus on the topics that have come up most frequently in my everyday conversations with Italian family, friends and colleagues. We will focus on the important Italian phrases and Italian vocabulary we all need to know to become more fluent when we speak about everyday events in Italian!\n\nThe topic for this month —movies and TV — comes up frequently during daily conversation, both when making small talk with acquaintances and also when planning activities with family, friends, and co-workers. In the “How to Talk About Movies and TV in Italian” blog for this month, we will focus on common Italian phrases needed to describe the type of show you have watched, if liked it, and why . As usual, the focus will be on common Italian expressions that can be used to describe your own interests.\n\nEnjoy the third topic in this “How to Talk About…” series, “How to Talk About Movies and TV in Italian.” —Kathryn Occhipinti\n\nSpecial thanks to Italian instructor Maria Vanessa Colapinto.\n\nBanner image credit: Como lake landscapes on film strip\n\nHow to Talk About: TV and the Movies in Italian\n\nUsing piacere to say we like a TV show or movie…\n\nIn Italian, a few simple sentences will suffice to say if we liked what we saw — or not. You may recall that Italians use the irregular verb piacere to convey the idea that they like something. For a refresher on how this verb works, please refer to the beginning Italian blogs in my Conversational Italian! blog, “Piacere — How Italians Say, ‘I like it!” and “Piacere: How Italians Say, ‘I liked it!’\n\nThe most important thing to remember is that the conjugation of piacere will have to agree with the number of things that are being liked.\n\nSo, when speaking in the present tense, if one thing is liked, simply use the third person singular conjugation piace.\n\nIf many things are liked in the present, use the plural third person, which is piacciono.\n\nFor the past tense, we can use the passato prossimo third person singular forms “è piacuto” and “è piaciuta” for the one-time event when we liked something.\n\nIf many things are liked, the third person plural forms “sono piaciuti” for the masculine plural (and mixed group plural) and “sono piaciute” for the feminine plural are used.\n\nThen put the indirect object pronoun “mi” before the verb to make the simple sentence: “ To me, this is/was pleasing!” Or, as we would say in English, “I like/liked this!”\n\nTo ask a friend if they like or liked something, put “ti“ before the verb, for “Is/was this pleasing to you?” Or, as we would say in English, “Do/Did you like this?”\n\nIf, for some reason, we do NOT like what we have watched, just start your sentence with the word “non.”\n\nWhat we might say about our favorite TV show or movie that we like:\n\nMi piace questo film. I like this movie. Mi è piaciuto questo film. I liked this movie. Mi piace molto questo film. I really like this movie. Mi è piaciuto molto questo film. I really liked this movie. Ti piace questo film? Do you like this movie? Ti è piaciuto questo film? Did you like this movie?\n\nWhat we might say about our favorite TV show or movie that we did NOT like:\n\nNon mi piace questo film. I don’t like this movie. Non mi è piaciuto questo film. I didn’t like this movie. Mi piace molto questo film. I really don’t like this movie. Mi è piaciuto molto questo film. I really didn’t like this movie. Ti piace questo film? Don’t you like this movie? Ti è piaciuto questo film? Didn’t you like this movie?\n\nUsing common expressions to say we like a TV show or movie…\n\nOf course, there are many common expressions in Italian that go beyond the simple: ” I like it” or “I didn’t like it.” Just like in English, we might say, “It was cool,” or “It was out of this world,” It seems like new expressions are invented almost every day for how we feel about things! So, it should come as no surprise that Italians also have invented colloquial expressions that express feelings that go deeper than simply liking. Here are a few you might want to try to surprise your Italian friends.\n\nIf you want to ask your friend if it is worth your time to watch a certain movie, you can use the phrases, ” Vale la pena?” for “Is it worth it?” “Voleva la pena il film?” means, “Was the film worth it?”\n\nIn the table below are some answers to this question that you might hear from a native Italian if they liked the film you are talking about:\n\nMi piace un sacco! I like it a lot! (lit. a sack full) Mi è piaciuto un sacco! I liked it a lot! È stato bello! It was great! È / È stato meraviglioso! It is / was wonderful! È / È stato stupendo! It is / was amazing / cool! È / È stato fantastico! It is / was fantastic / cool! È / È stato fico / figo! It is / was cool! È / È stato fichissimo / fighissimo! It is / was the coolest! È / È stato da paura! It is / was cool! È / È stato il meglio! It is / was the best! È il migliore film che io abbia mai visto. It is the best film that I have ever seen.\n\nHow do I say, “TV show” and “movies” in Italian?\n\nThe programs we watch on a television set ( il televisore) or on a screen (lo schermo) are referred to most commonly in both English and Italian as “TV.” The pronunciation, of course, is different in each language. In Italian, “TV” is pronounced as an Italian would pronounce the letters “t” and “v”, which sounds like “tee-vooh.” Notice from the table below that there is an Italian word for TV, “la televisione,” and therefore the abbreviation is feminine as well.\n\nTV La TV / La televisione Cable TV La TV via cavo Satellite TV La TV sattelitare RAI-TV Italian state television\n\n(Radio-Televisione Italiana) Television set Il televisore TV or computer screen Lo schermo TV show Un programma\n\nUn programma televisivo TV series Una serie TV\n\nUn telefilm Episode Una puntata Situation Comedy Una serie TV sitcom\n\nUna commedia Comedy show Un programma comico\n\nTo talk about a movie in Italian, we could refer to “la pellicola,” but this word is no longer in common use. Instead, Italians most often refer to a movie in general with the word “film.” Movies in general are either “i film,” with the borrowed English word preceded by the plural masculine definite article in Italian, or “il cinema,” a collective masculine noun.\n\nThe usual verbs for “to watch,” “guardare,” and “to see,”“vedere,” describe the act of watching a screen to see a TV show or movie.\n\nMovie theater Il cinema Film studio Lo studio cinematografico Movie Il film (La pellicola) Movies I film / Il cinema to capture an image for a film filmare / riprendere / girare to be recorded essere filmato to watch a movie guardare un film to watch a movie vedere un film\n\nUsing common expressions to say what we prefer…\n\nThe verb preferire means “to prefer,” which is a regular -isc conjugated -ire verb.“I prefer,“ is “Io preferisco…” To ask a question of someone else, say, “Tu preferisci…?”\n\nIf you want to say you prefer one movie genre over another, just use the adjective preferito. This also works for your favorite movie, TV show, color, etc. Just make sure to change the ending of preferito (a,i,e) to reflect what it is you are describing, whether masculine or feminine, singular or plural.\n\nHere are examples from the dialogue below:\n\nÈ il tipo di film che io preferisco.\n\nIt’s the type of film that I prefer.\n\nNon per me. Il mio film preferito è un buon giallo.\n\nNot for me. My favorite movie is a good mystery movie.\n\nIf you might want to say, “I liked (film) better than…” use the sentence construction:\n\n“Mi piace… (film) più di + definite article… (film).\n\nMa mi piace La Vita è Bella più del Commissario Montalbano.\n\nI like La Vita è Bella more than Detective Montalbano.\n\nAnother way to make a comparison between films: “This film is much better than…”\n\n“Questo film è molto meglio di + definite article…”\n\nQuesto film è molto meglio del Commissario Montalbano, sono sicuro!\n\nThis film is much better than Detective Montalbano, I am sure.\n\nFinally, to mention who has written or directed a movie, use the conjunction “di” to mean “by.”\n\nSome common movie genres\n\nAction Film d’azione Adventure story Storia d’avventura Costume drama (historical TV show with costumes) Sceneggiato in costume Costume drama (historical film with costumes) Film in costume Comedy Film comico / commedia Comedy drama Commedia drammatica Dark comedy Commedia nera High comedy Commedia sofisticata / da intenditori Low comedy (bawdy) Commedia popolare Slapstick comedy Farsa / Pagliacciata* Musical comedy Commedia musicale Romantic comedy Commedia romantica Documentary Un documentario Drama Storia drammatica Drama movie Film drammatico / Dramma Detective movie Un poliziesco / Un giallo** Film noir (thriller genre) Film noir Foreign Film Film straniero Horror Film horror / Film dell’orrore Mystery Un giallo** Science Fiction / Sci-fi Film di fantascienza Psychological thriller Thriller psicologico Thriller (suspense film) Thriller / Giallo Western Film Western\n\n*Reference to the opera “Pagliacci,” whose main character is a clown that performs slapstick humor with puppets.\n\n**Mystery books and films are referred to by the color “giallo,” which is derived from the yellow cover all mystery books were given in the past.\n\nBelow is a simple dialogue between two friends, Maria and Anna, talking about their favorite movie and TV show. There are, of course, many variations. Think about your favorite movie and create your own!\n\nMaria: Ieri sera, ho guardato il film, La Vita è Bella, di Roberto Benigni. Last night, I watched the movie, “Life is Beautiful,” by Roberto Benigni. Anna: Ne è valsa la pena? Was it worth it? Maria: Si, vale la pena.\n\nMi è piaciuto molto questo film! Yes, it is worth it.\n\nI really liked this film! Anna: È una storia drammatica? Is it a drama? Maria: Si, è una storia drammatica, ma la prima parte è anche un po’ comica. Yes, it is a drama, but the first part is also a bit funny. Anna: Ah, una commedia drammatica. I see, a comedy drama. Maria: È il tipo di film che io preferisco. It’s the type of film that I prefer. Anna: Non per me.\n\nIl mio film preferito è un buon giallo. Not for me.\n\nMy favorite movie is a good mystery movie. Commissario Montalbano è figo. Detective Montalbano is cool. Maria: Boh. Ho visto molte puntate del Commissario Montalbano sul TV. Well. I have seen many episodes of Detective Montalbano on TV. Ma mi piace La Vita è Bella più del Commissario Montalbano. I like La Vita è Bella more than Detective Montalbano. Questo film è molto meglio del Commissario Montalbano, sono sicuro! This film is much better than Detective Montalbano, I am sure. Anna: Allora, devo guardare La Vita è Bella un giorno. Well, then, I will have to watch La Vita è Bella one day.\n\nRemember how to talk about movies and TV in Italian and I guarantee\n\nyou will use these Italian phrases every day!\n\nAnd remember to study our Conversational Italian for Travelers “Just the Important Phrases” pocket travel book if you want a handy way to remember all the important Italian phrases you will need to know!\n\nAvailable on amazon.com and Learn Travel Italian.com\n\nKathryn Occhipinti, MD, is the author of the\n\nConversational Italian for Travelers series of books and a teacher of Italian for travelers to Italy in the Peoria and Chicago area.\n\n“Everything you need to know to enjoy your visit to Italy!”\n\nJoin myConversational Italian!
