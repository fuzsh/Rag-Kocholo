        "text": "Since the release in 1929 of a popular book series with bright yellow covers, the Italian word giallo (yellow) has come to define a whole spectrum of mystery and detective fiction and films. Although most English speakers associate the term giallo with the violent and erotic thrillers popular in the 1960s and 1970s from directors like Mario Bava, Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci and others, the term encompasses a wide range of Italian media such as mysteries, thrillers and detective stories--even comedies and political pamphlets. As films like Blood and Black Lace (1964) and Deep Red (1975) have received international acclaim, giallo is a fluid and dynamic genre that has evolved throughout the decades. This book examines the many facets of the giallo genre --narrative, style, themes, and influences. It explores Italian films, made-for-TV films and miniseries from the dawn of sound cinema to the present, discussing their impact on society, culture and mores.\n\nRoberto Curti is a free lance writer for several Italian and foreign magazines. He’s a regular contributor to Italian music, film and literary magazine Blow Up (http://www.blowupmagazine.com). He has collaborated, among others, to the Italian cult film magazine Nocturno Cinema and to the Canadian web mag Offscreen (www.offscreen.com). His most recent work is Italian Crime Filmography 1968-1980 (McFarland), an in-depth history of Italian crime and noir films."
