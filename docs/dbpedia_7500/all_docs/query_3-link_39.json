        "text": "One of Italy’s greatest contributions to horror is the introduction of the “giallo,” a form of super-stylish murder mystery that became known for its gorgeous aesthetics, its twisty, bizarre plotting and, most of all, its breathtaking kill sequences. Films with amazing titles like Mario Bava’s Blood and Black Lace, Dario Argento’s Bird with the Crystal Plumage, Paolo Cavara’s Black Belly of the Tarantula and Sergio Martino’s Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key are among the most celebrated giallo films, not only for the way they can represent the best of what the genre has to offer, but also for the way they help to codify exactly what a “giallo” is.\n\nFor the uninitiated or less familiar, the giallo is born out of a series of cheap pulp crime paperbacks published in Italy as far back as the late 1920s and known for their yellow — or, in Italian, giallo — covers. Though the films that would eventually carry this categorization became known for being lurid, sexual, and often hyper-violent, the original giallo paperbacks were primarily Italian translations of American novels from the likes of Agatha Christie and Raymond Chandler. The term was really only used to describe a murder mystery. The sleaze would come later. As a movie subgenre, the giallo finds its roots in the thrillers of Alfred Hitchcock and Michael Powell’s Peeping Tom. Mario Bava’s 1963 film The Girl Who Knew Too Much (aka The Evil Eye) is widely considered to be the first giallo, as it meets many of the criteria and includes a number of the tropes that have come to be associated with the genre.\n\nAnd what are those tropes exactly? Well, gialli typically center around a mystery that begins with a murder or series of murders, which are then investigated by some sort of outsider working independently of the police (who, it should be said, often prove to be ineffectual). The murders tend to be bloody and often have women as the target, many of whom will appear nude moments before dying. The arts and/or fashion (read: models) play a major role in many of the movies. In the most traditional gialli, the killer wears black leather gloves and carries out the murders with knives and straight razors. There are multiple red herrings in determining the killer’s identity and the motives are often psychosexual and/or nonsensical in nature. They tend to focus on form over content, more about how the sequences are staged than about breaking narrative ground.\n\nSpoilers for Dressed to Kill ahead.\n\nAlmost every sentence in the above paragraph describes Brian De Palma’s Dressed to Kill, a film that has always been accused of being slavishly imitative of Hitchcock’s Psycho but which owes a great deal more to the European gialli of the 1970s. As a filmmaker, De Palma has never been able to get out from under Hitchcock’s shadow. It’s a comparison he invites himself, as several of his ‘70s and ‘80s thrillers are reworkings of earlier Hitchcock films such as Vertigo, Psycho, and Rear Window – basically any of the films that deal at all with voyeurism or “looking,” a common theme across De Palma’s work. And while Dressed to Kill certainly shares some elements in common with Psycho, both in the way it dispatches who we assume to be the leading lady at the end of Act I and in the cross-dressing reveal of the killer’s identity, it’s pure giallo through and through.\n\nBefore getting into the specifics, consider the debt that De Palma’s overall style owes to Italian gialli: the gliding camera, the long takes, the way scenes play out without dialogue or exposition, working purely on the rise and fall of an emotional impact based purely on imagery and music. No single one of these elements is exclusive to the giallo, but combine all of these stylistic conceits into the same movie and you’re creating the template for a giallo film. De Palma’s films didn’t start out this way; his student films and earliest work in the 1960s was far more documentarian and political, owing primarily to the free-form experimental cinema of Jean-Luc Godard. But De Palma has always been a filmmaker who wears his influences proudly on his sleeve, be it Godard or Hitchcock or, as the timing might suggest, Italian gialli. If the 1970s were the most fruitful decade for this particular subgenre of horror, it may be no coincidence that De Palma’s thrillers begin to draw from gialli closer to the end of the ‘70s. Dressed to Kill, released in 1980, represents the apex of this influence on De Palma’s work.\n\nThen there are those aspects of Dressed to Kill that feel almost like a 1:1 adaptation of a giallo film. It begins with a woman in danger, as Angie Dickinson’s Kate Miller dreams of a long, hot shower, complete with lingering shots of her (body double’s) nude figure. Suddenly, she’s grabbed from behind by a stranger inside the shower with her; she calls out her husband’s name, but he can’t hear. She wakes up, having dreamed the whole thing, but De Palma has laid out his mission statement: this a movie about a woman who is not safe, just as Bava and Argento and Martino and Fulci had been making movies about women in danger for the previous decade. It’s not just the danger that makes Dressed to Kill a giallo, though, but rather the way it intertwines with a sexuality in a way that’s far more erotic than the hormonal teenage rituals of the slasher genre.\n\nThe movie’s biggest setpiece is an extended silent sequence during which Dickinson flirts with a man in an art museum (works of fine art are common signifiers of a giallo), then makes love with him in a cab, goes home to his apartment and makes love again, sneaking out after getting a bit of shocking news about him – the guilt of her marital transgression come to terrible life – and enters an elevator to leave the building and the memory of the mistake behind. This is pure visual storytelling, played out wordlessly across one nearly 15 minute sequence. Once Dickinson enters the elevator, everything changes: hiding in the corner is a blonde woman in sunglasses who begins to stab and slash her. We get an extreme closeup of her eye as the razor cuts her face; not only are shots like this closely associated with filmmakers like Argento, but with entire giallo genre – a genre obsessed with eyes as a function of “looking.” Black leather gloves, the light glinting off of a straight razor – De Palma’s camera fetishizes these hallmarks of the giallo throughout the murder. The killer’s reflection is glimpsed in a mirror by a bystander (a prostitute played by Nancy Allen), which should be familiar to anyone who has seen Argento’s Deep Red. More than any other, this is the scene in which De Palma confirms Dressed to Kill as an American giallo.\n\nBut it’s not just the elevator sequence that codifies the movie as a giallo, as De Palma embraces other tropes as well: we get our amateur sleuth in the form of Dickinson’s son, played by Keith Gordon, who becomes obsessed with solving his mom’s murder, enlisting the help of witness Allen along the way. We have the ineffectual police presence, here personified by De Palma regular Dennis Franz. We have a major red herring. We have the psychosexual motives of our killer, ultimately revealed to be the psychiatrist who was treating Dickinson’s character and played by Michael Caine. Aside from the murder of Angie Dickinson early on, this is De Palma’s most overt nod to Psycho, but it’s also totally in keeping with the traditions of gialli, in which repressed sexual desire and gender fluidity often drive the killers to kill, whether it’s Four Flies on Grey Velvet or Tenebrae or A Blade in the Dark or even, to a certain extent, Who Saw Her Die?. Murders are rarely random in gialli; they’re motivated by sex and psychology and, usually, some break between the two. Dressed to Kill fits this model completely.\n\nI don’t know for certain that De Palma set out to make a giallo when he wrote and directed Dressed to Kill, but I do know that he has long been the sum of his influences as a filmmaker. He takes all of the movies he loves, all of the movies that have made an impact on him, then filters them through his own lens (believe it or not, Dressed to Kill is probably his most personal film) and executes them with a near-unparalleled technical precision. It’s hard to believe that a decade’s worth of Italian gialli didn’t play some role in shaping Dressed to Kill, though, given how many elements of the movie are so in line with that subgenre of horror. Whether intentional or not, Dressed to Kill still stands as the definitive example of an American giallo film. There are a few other instances of directors attempting to adapt the distinctly European giallo for American audiences – White of the Eye, for example, or 1994’s Color of Night – but none are nearly as successful as De Palma is here.\n\nDressed to Kill is a bottle of J&B and some dubbing short of being a perfect giallo.\n\nThe horror films of the 1950s are often relegated to two categories: space invaders and giant bugs. There is some truth in that generalization, but the reality is far more subtle with deep ties to the past along with the political climate of the decade itself. Both these categories can trace their lineage, at least in American film, back to two quintessential classics of the genre—Dracula and Frankenstein, but removed from spooky castles and unspecified European locales and placed squarely in the suburbs and cities of Cold War era America. Like Dracula, the alien invasion film examines the fear of “the other.” The so-called giant bug movies are really “science gone awry” movies and Frankenstein has been the template and ultimate expression of that idea since its publication in 1818. By the 1950s, the great scientific fear was nuclear power, specifically in the form of the atomic bomb and the radioactive fallout left it its wake. Them! remains one of the best and most enduring expressions of those fears.\n\nThem! began as a short story by George Worthing Yates about giant irradiated ants in New York’s subway tunnels before finding its way to producer Ted Sherdeman, who sold it to Warner Brothers. According to David J. Skal’s book Screams of Reason: Mad Science and Modern Culture, news of the bombing of Hiroshima made Sherdeman, who had served under General Douglas MacArthur during World War II, physically ill, causing him to throw up in reaction. The original Yates script was deemed unfilmable due to budget considerations and Sherdeman transplanted the story to the New Mexico desert and the storm drain system beneath Los Angeles. Sherdeman’s screenplay was approved and handed over to director Gordon Douglas and producer David Weisbart with an intention to film it in 3-D and color, but by the time Them! went before the cameras, it was scaled back to 2-D black and white. Douglas described the original look of the giant ants to Skal saying, “I put green and red soap bubbles in their eyes[…]The ants were purple, slimy things. Their bodies were wet down with Vaseline. They scared the bejeezus out of you.”\n\nThough the change to black and white disappointed its director, it was probably for the best as the black and white photography gives the film a grittier, more reality-bound immediacy than the Warner color system of the time would have provided, allowing the film to stand the test of time to a greater degree. There is no doubt that, to modern eyes, the monstrous insects have lost some of their impact in light of advances in creature creation over the decades, but color may well have made that even more noticeable. Despite the limitations of the era, the film holds up remarkably well, less because of its monsters than due to its tight script, the gravity of its subject matter, and the effectiveness of its characters. Watching Them! for the first time in a very long time (so long that it practically qualifies as a first viewing), I was struck by how engaging the film remains throughout the entirety of its runtime. The intrigue and suspense of the story is ratcheted to a level that rarely lets up and holds the viewer firmly in its grasp.\n\nThe film begins as a mystery when two police officers, Sgt. Ben Peterson (James Whitmore who would claim latter-day notoriety for his roles in films like The Shawshank Redemption and The Relic) and his partner Ed Blackburn (Chris Drake) discover a little girl (Sandy Descher) in a state of catatonia wandering alone through the New Mexico desert near White Sands. Their investigation leads them to a travel trailer that has been ravaged by something large and savage that has left behind a footprint that neither man can identify. As they search the premises, a bizarre, high pitched chirping sound emanates from the desert. They also come across the ruins of the general store, its proprietor has been killed and thrown into the cellar. In both cases no money or belongings have been taken, only sugar. Left behind to guard the store while Ben takes the little girl back to town, Ed again hears the high pitched whine before being killed offscreen.\n\nOf course, anyone who had seen the trailer or even the poster for Them! already knew the culprits were giant ants but this setup is remarkably strong. It is soon discovered that the little girl is the daughter of an FBI agent who had been vacationing with his family and FBI Agent Robert Graham, played by James Arness who had previously played the creature in The Thing and would soon go on to his greatest fame as Marshal Matt Dillon on Gunsmoke, is called in to join the investigation. Also joining the core cast are Dr. Harold Medford (Oscar winner for Miracle on 34th Street Edmund Gwenn) and his daughter Patricia (Joan Weldon) who arrive from the Department of Agriculture to examine a scientific theory that is not immediately disclosed. This is where the seeds of the underlying environmental and scientific responsibility message of the film begin to be sown. The elder Medford asks where the first atomic bomb tests were made. He is told that they were performed in the White Sands desert area where the little girl, the smashed trailer, and the ravaged general store were found.\n\nThe first appearances of the giant ants in the desert are among the most indelible in 1950s horror. The first sees our small band all wearing safety glasses to protect their eyes from the whipping sand and one of Them rising over a dune above Weldon’s Dr. Pat Medford followed by her inevitable scream. The second is even more powerful with a giant ant holding a ribcage in its mandibles and releasing it onto a pile of bones that have gathered on the side of a gigantic anthill. The Fay Wray-ish scream that Pat lets loose in these early moments is perhaps a necessary, for the time, nod to the damsel in distress trope ubiquitous to most horror films of the era, but that soon gives way to her true character. After the discovery of the nest that is soon after barraged with missiles by Peterson and Graham, Pat takes control of the situation. She is a modern, take charge, professional woman who feels no need to explain herself to the men involved in the attempts to stop the ants. Her experience and expertise is invaluable to the success of the mission and she repels down inside the nest along with the small all-male crew despite Agent Graham’s chivalrous protests.\n\nThe sequence inside the nest is one of the film’s best set pieces and fans of James Cameron’s Aliens (1986) will undoubtedly see the influence Them! had on that film. This is particularly true when the team discovers the queen’s chamber filled with eggs, some of them already hatched, and use flamethrowers to set them ablaze. This confirms the doctors Medford’s worst fears, that the gigantism of the ants was most likely “caused by lingering radiation from the first atomic bomb” and the giant ants have multiplied, producing more queens that will migrate to other areas and create more colonies, eventually taking over the world. Back in Washington, D.C., it is confirmed that, if they are not stopped, this will lead to the extinction of the human race within a year.\n\nDespite its expansion to a national scale, the film continues to tell its story through its small group of central characters. This is an extremely effective way to tell the story as it allows the film to remain personal and emotionally connected despite the global nature of the crisis. The climactic sequence in the Los Angeles storm drain system is all the more effective because our heroes, along with a large contingent of the U.S. Army, are searching for Mrs. Lodge’s (Mary Alan Hokanson) missing boys. As was often the case in the post-World War II, pre-Vietnam 1950s, the U.S. military is depicted as the ultimate in heroism and are the ones who save the day. Ironically, however, this was all caused by a weapon of war in the first place.\n\nThe final moments of the film once again underscore the message wrapped up inside this entertaining package—the very real fears of nuclear weapons. As the nest adjacent to the L.A. River is being eradicated, Graham speculates to the younger Dr. Medford, “Pat if these monsters got started as a result of the first atomic bomb in 1945, what about all the others that have been exploded since then?” Pat can only answer, “I don’t know.” Her father, however, has a more philosophical and foreboding answer: “Nobody knows, Robert. When man entered the atomic age, he opened a door into a new world. What we’ll eventually find in that new world, nobody can predict.”\n\nFor fans of science fiction and horror, it led to an unprecedented number of giant bug, human, and radioactive monsters. Following Them! came Tarantula (1955), The Deadly Mantis (1957), The Monster That Challenged the World (1957), Attack of the Crab Monsters (1957), The Amazing Colossal Man (1957), Attack of the 50 Foot Woman (1958), The Spider (1958), and of course the greatest giant atomic monster of them all Godzilla. There were other variations as well like The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957) which as the title suggests reversed the formula and The Fly (1958), another science gone awry parable that finds a scientist fused with a housefly during an experiment in teleportation. And its influence didn’t end with the 50s inspiring directly and indirectly animal attack and giant creature features for decades to come.\n\nBut messages and influence aside, Them! is just a damned entertaining movie. It moves like lightning and maintains its urgency from beginning to end. It crackles with energy and excitement, great characters and performances, and cool monsters, not to mention that iconic whining sound effect. Seventy years have passed since its release but even now, nothing seems to be able to stop Them!.\n\nIn Bride of Frankenstein, Dr. Pretorius, played by the inimitable Ernest Thesiger, raises his glass and proposes a toast to Colin Clive’s Henry Frankenstein—“to a new world of Gods and Monsters.” I invite you to join me in exploring this world, focusing on horror films from the dawn of the Universal Monster movies in 1931 to the collapse of the studio system and the rise of the new Hollywood rebels in the late 1960’s. With this period as our focus, and occasional ventures beyond, we will explore this magnificent world of classic horror. So, I raise my glass to you and invite you to join me in the toast."
