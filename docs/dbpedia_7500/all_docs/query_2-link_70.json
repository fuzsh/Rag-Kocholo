        "text": "Do you want to speak Italian more easily and confidently in 2023?\n\nI have been trying to help you with this goal by posting a new blog every month in the series “Italian Phrases We Use EVERY Day!”® With these blogs, I discuss how Italians use their language on a daily basis and in so doing help you to “think in Italian.”\n\nTo speak fluently in another language, it is important to know how to use linking verbs — verbs that describe a state of being. Linking verbs do not describe movement; that is the role of the action verbs. The linking verbs, which link the subject with a descriptor, have their own, essential role to play. Remember the famous English saying, “To be or not to be? ” to understand just how important a linking verb is in any language!\n\nIt follows that if one were to make a list of the most commonly used verbs for any language, the linking verbs will top any single action verb. For instance, the English verb “to be,” and its Italian equivalent “essere,” are certainly used in ordinary conversation every day, many times a day. In English, the verbs “to become” and “to seem” are always linking verbs, as are their Italian equivalents “diventare” and “sembrare.”\n\nSince a linking verb “links” the subject to a descriptor, there are special implications when a verb like “to be” or “essere” is employed. In short, the subject in the first phrase of the sentence and the predicate that follows are “linked” so they are “one and the same.” This creates a situation in which the verb tense and the noun and/or adjective that follows must always agree with the subject. This last rule has special implications for Italian, which classifies all nouns into masculine and feminine and requires that all adjectives match their noun in gender and number!\n\nWe have talked about Italian noun/adjective agreement in our blog in this series, Italian Phrases We Use EVERY Day! Italian Adjectives: Before or After the Noun? We have also described how the Italian possessive adjectives must agree in gender and number with the noun they precede in our last blog How to Express Possession in Italian. The Italian linking verbs provide yet another situation for noun/adjective agreement.\n\nIf we learn how to use the most common Italian linking verbs, essere, diventare and sembrare, we will truly sound like a native Italian!\n\nThis post is the 69th in a series of Italian phrases we have been trying out in our Conversational Italian! Facebook group. If you’d like to read the earlier posts in the series, “Italian Phrases We Use EVERY Day!” just click HERE\n\nMany “commonly used phrases”\n\nin Italian use\n\nthe Italian linking verbs\n\nessere, diventare, and sembrare\n\nSee below for how this works.\n\nAs we all master these phrases, so will you. Try my method and let me know how it works. What sentences will you create with these phrases?\n\nPlease reply. I’d love to hear from you! Or join our Conversational Italian! group discussion on Facebook.\n\nThe basics of the Italian language are introduced in the Conversational Italian for Travelers textbook and reference books Just the Verbs and Just the Grammar *\n\nfound on amazon.com and Learn Travel Italian.com.\n\nThe rights to purchase the Conversational Italian for Travelers books in PDF format on two electronic devices can also be obtained at Learn Travel Italian.com.\n\n*This material adapted from the Conversational Italian for Travelers textbook and reference books Just the Verbs and Just the Grammar\n\n****************************************\n\nItalian Linking Verb\n\nEssere\n\n“To be, or not to be…” is one of the most famous lines ever written in the English language. But that phrase would not be possible without a verb to express the very idea that we exist. Think of how many times a day we say, “I am” or “he is” or “we are” — all forms of the English infinitive verb “to be.”\n\nIn Italian, the verb essere means to be. Essere in the present tense is a linking verb, as it connects the subject in the beginning of the sentence with specific information about the subject at the end of the sentence. No action is described. Instead, with the verb essere, the subject can be thought of as one and the same as, or “linked” to the information that follows.\n\nThe complete conjugation of essere in the present tense is given below. Note that essere is an irregular verb and all forms should be memorized given the daily use you will have for this verb! The accented syllables have been underlined.\n\nSince a linking verb “links” the subject to a descriptor, there are special rules to follow when a verb like “to be” or “essere” is employed. Since the subject in the first phrase and the predicate that follows are “linked” they are essentially “one and the same.” Therefore, the verb tense, as well as the noun and/or adjective that follows, must always agree with the subject. This situation has special implications for Italian, which classifies all nouns into masculine and feminine and requires that all adjectives match their noun in gender and number!\n\nThe use of essere requires\n\nthe Italian endings for any noun or adjective that follows\n\nto match the gender and number of the subject.\n\nThey are, after all, one and the same!\n\nEssere is also an essential “helping verb” for compound tenses in Italian, which are made up of more than one verb. Hence essere is also classified as an auxiliary, or “assisting” verb when used in this manner. For compound tenses, essere requires a change in the ending of the verb that it assists. The passato prossimo, which is used to describe the recent past in Italian (and has been discussed in other blogs in this series), is an example of how essere is used as an auxiliary verb. Now that we know that essere is a linking verb, it makes sense that the ending of the past participle that follows the conjugated form of essere must be changed!\n\nLet’s go through some simple examples in the present tense to see how this works.\n\nThe sentences below use the nouns that refer to a young girl, a young boy, and the different groups to which girls and boys can belong. For these nouns, one can simply change the ending of ragazzo (boy) to reflect the gender and number of the subject. Remember that in a group of males, or males and females, the Italian ending defaults to the masculine -i. A group of all females is special, though; the plural feminine ending -e is used.\n\nThe descriptor used in the sentences below, is the adjective bravo (good/nice personality), which will change it’s ending to reflect the gender and number of the noun that it modifies.\n\nBoth noun and adjective will, of course, reflect back to the subject\n\nwhen using the verb to be, which is essere in Italian.\n\nIn the examples below, the gender of the subject and the noun and adjective endings that match it are given in red for the feminine and brown for the masculine. The conjugated forms of essere are green.\n\nCaterina è una brava ragazza. Kathy is a good/nice girl.\n\nPietro è un bravo ragazzo.Peter is a good/nice boy.\n\nCaterina e Francesca sono brave ragazze.Kathy and Frances are good girls.\n\nPietro e Michele sono bravi ragazzi.Peter and Michael are good boys.\n\nCaterina e Pietro sono bravi ragazzi.Kathy and Peter are good young people.\n\nWhat do we do if the noun after the verb to be (essere) is omitted from the sentence and only an adjective is used to describe the subject? Simply remember to change the ending of the adjective to reflect the gender and number of the subject.\n\nCaterina è brava. Kathy is good/nice.\n\nPietro è bravo. Peter is good/nice.\n\nCaterina e Francesca sono brave.Kathy and Frances are good.\n\nPietro e Michele sono bravi.Peter and Michael are good.\n\nCaterina e Pietro sono bravi.Kathy and Peter are good.\n\nOne last word on the use of bravo. If you shout, “Bravo!” in a theater, this is for a single male performer. Shout “Brava!” for a female performer. “Bravi!” is correct for the entire cast but for some reason is less frequently used than “Bravo!” here in America.\n\n***********************************************************\n\nItalian Linking Verb\n\nDiventare\n\nThe Italian verb diventare (to become), like the verb “to be,” always functions as a linking verb in both Italian and English. By definition, the subject “becomes” what is listed in the phrase that follows this verb. Although the subject changes, the verb still refers to the subject mentioned at the beginning of the sentence.\n\nDiventare is a regular -are verb. The full conjugation is below.\n\nNotice that if we substitute the conjugated form of diventare for essere in our example sentences in the first section of this blog, the endings for the adjective bravo remain the same! I’ve added a qualifier to the first sentence, which can also be used with the sentences that follow with our verb diventare.\n\nCaterina diventa brava con la prova.\n\nKathy becomes good with rehearsing.\n\nPietro diventa bravo. Peter becomes good.\n\nCaterina e Francesca diventano brave.Kathy and Frances become good.\n\nPietro e Michele diventano bravi.Peter and Michael become good.\n\nCaterina e Pietro diventano bravi.Kathy and Peter become good.\n\nSince the verb diventare is often used in the past tense, such as when one is talking about a change they have noticed in another, let’s try these sentences one more time with the passato prossimo. Essere must be conjugated and used as the helping verb with diventare, as with other Italian verbs that denote a change in one’s state of being.\n\nIn the examples below, notice the change in the ending of the past participle diventato to match the gender and number of the subject. Also, the addition of a specific time frame to the first sentence (which can be used with the remaining sentences as well) to go along with our use of the passato prossimo. (If you need a refresher on how to use the passato prossimo, visit the blog Past Tense Passato Prossimo — Avere vs. Essere? ).\n\nCaterina è diventata brava lo scorso anno.\n\nKathy became good last year.\n\nPietro è diventato bravo. Peter became good.\n\nCaterina e Francesca sono diventate brave.Kathy and Frances became good.\n\nPietro e Michele sono diventati bravi.Peter and Michael become good.\n\nCaterina e Pietro sono diventati bravi.Kathy and Peter became good.\n\nMany common Italian phrases that speak of life changes use the verb diventare. One can make something of themselves, become a grandfather, or become another’s friend and these ideas can be rendered with phrases that use the Italian verb diventare.\n\nSee below for example sentences that describe real life situations with diventare. Once again, notice that the passato prossimo and the noun or adjective that follows all must change to agree in gender and number with the subject!\n\nMarco è diventato qualcuno quando lui ha compiuto trentadue anni.\n\nMark made something of himself when he became 32 years old.\n\nMichelle è diventato nonno alla età di sessanta anni.\n\nMichael became a grandfather at the age of 60.\n\nMaria e Anna sono diventate amiche.\n\nMary and Ann have become friends.\n\nMarco e Michelle sono diventati amici.\n\nMark and Michael have become friends.\n\nMarco e Anna sono diventati amici.\n\nMark and Ann have become friends.\n\nSeveral Italian expressions use diventare to refer to emotions that show in a person’s facial expressions or body language. For instance, the acts of blushing, showing confusion, freezing up or becoming furious.\n\nMaria è diventata di fuoco quando ho detto che a Marco gli piace lei.\n\nMaria blushed violently when I told her that Mark likes her.\n\nPietro è diventato una bestia* dopo aver guidato nel traffico per due ore.\n\nPeter lost it after driving in traffic for two hours.\n\nMaria e Pietro sono diventati di gelo quando hanno sentito un rumore in casa di notte.\n\nMary and Peter froze up when they heard noise in the house at night.\n\n*The noun bestia is always feminine.\n\n***********************************************************\n\nItalian Linking Verb\n\nSembrare\n\nThe Italian verb sembrare (to seem/to appear/to look like) is the third verb that always functions as a linking verb in both Italian and English.* By definition, the subject “seems to be “or “looks like” what is listed in the phrase that follows sembrare. Although, in reality the subject may not fit the description in the phrase that follows, sembrare still refers back to the subject. and therefore is a linking verb.\n\nSembrare is a regular -are verb. The full conjugation is below.\n\n*Sembrare can also mean “to feel like” but this definition will be discussed in another blog.\n\nNotice that if we substitute the conjugated form of sembrare for essere in our example sentences in the first section of this blog, the endings for the adjective bravo remain the same! I’ve translated bravo as nice, as in to have a nice personality, for the examples below that use sembrare.\n\nCaterina sembra brava.\n\nKathy seems nice.\n\nPietro sembra bravo. Peter seems nice.\n\nCaterina e Francesca sembrano brave.Kathy and Frances seem nice.\n\nPietro e Michele sembrano bravi.Peter and Michael seem nice.\n\nCaterina e Pietro sembrano bravi.Kathy and Peter seem nice.\n\nIn life, sembrare is commonly used to describe how a person comes across, or presents him or herself, as above. Just replace bravo with any one of many characteristics or personality types to create many more descriptive sentences.\n\nLei sembra intelligente, contenta, bella, etc.\n\nShe seems intelligent, happy, pretty, etc.\n\nOr, on the negative side…\n\nLei sembra maleducata, triste, brutta, etc.\n\nShe seems rude, sad, ugly, etc.\n\n*********************\n\nItalian Verbs\n\nSembrare vs. Somigliare\n\nSembrare is also often the verb used to describe when someone resembles, or “looks like” someone else, such as when a child looks like their parent or when someone you know resembles a famous actor. Notice that in this case the idea contained in the English phrase “looks like” is expressed with sembrare alone in Italian; no preposition or other clarifying word is needed.\n\nThe verb somigliare, followed by the preposition a, is often used in this situation as well. Since the two people or groups are similar to each other, it stands to reason they will be equivalent in gender and number. In the passato prossimo, though, sembrare uses essere as its helping verb, while somigliare uses avere.\n\nIf you want to embellish your statement, provide specific characteristics using either entrambe for a feminine comparison, or entrambi for a masculine comparison or to compare a group of males and females.\n\nMaria sembra sua mamma; Maria looks like her mother;\n\nentrambe sono alte e belle. both are tall and beautiful.\n\n– or –\n\nMaria somiglia a sua mamma. Maria looks like her mother.\n\nentrambe sono alte e belle. both are tall and beautiful.\n\nPietro sembra Marcello Mastroianni;\n\nPeter looks like Marcello Mastroianni;\n\nentrambi sono alti e belli.\n\nboth are tall and handsome.\n\n– or –\n\nPietro somiglia a Marcello Mastroianni.\n\nMaria looks like Marcello Mastroianni.\n\nentrambi sono alti e belli.\n\nboth are tall and handsome.\n\nA place or object can also look similar to another place or object, depending on one’s perspective. Be careful when stating your opinion, though, since the sentence structure may require use of the subjunctive mood! If you are not familiar with the subjunctive mood but still want to emphasize that you are uncertain or stating an opinion, start your sentence with one of the following phrases: forse (perhaps), per me (for me), or secondo me (according to me). These three phrases do not require the use of a subjunctive mood verb.*\n\nSecondo me, Roma sembra New York:\n\nAccording to me, Rome seems like New York;\n\nentrambe (città) sono rumorose e pieno di gente.\n\nboth (cities) are noisy and full of people.\n\n– or –\n\nPer me, Roma somiglia a New York:\n\nFor me, Rome is similar to New York;\n\nentrambe (città) sono rumorose e pieno di gente.\n\nboth (cities) are noisy and full of people.\n\nLa nuova versione del software sembra la vecchia;\n\nThe new version of the software appears like the old;\n\nnon ho notato alcuna differenza.\n\nI haven’t noticed any difference.\n\n– or –\n\nLa nuova versione del software somoglia alla vecchia;\n\nThe new version of the software seems like the old;\n\nNon ho notato qualunque differenza.\n\nI haven’t noticed any difference.\n\n*If you are interested in learning more about the subjunctive mood, visit my blog series “Speak Italian!” on this topic in my blog.learntravelitalian.com.

Every day we all compare the characteristics of one thing to another — larger vs. smaller, better or worse — often to describe what we prefer. The Italian language uses precise sentence structures and specific prepositions when making comparisons that are not always identical to English. In this blog, we will explore several ways to make comparisons that use the Italian preposition di. The good news is that Italian is consistent, and it is easy to learn the “Italian way” of thinking to compare the things in the world we live in!\n\nTo compare two different nouns — people, places, or things — where one has a superior or inferior characteristic, use the following Italian phrases below. Note that the Italian preposition di will combine with the definite article the (il, la, lo, l’, etc.) according to the usual rules, if a definite article is needed in the sentence.\n\nIn this case, the Italian preposition di is translated into English with than. Notice that “the” is often used in Italian but is not needed in English, due to the different way the two languages express possession (see the first example below). If you need a refresher on the Italian preposition di, visit a prior blog in this series, “How to Use “Di” in Italian.”\n\nAlso, the translation into English will not match the Italian word for word when making comparisons. English uses the irregular “larger” and “smaller” and therefore the Italian “more large” and “more small” cannot be translated directly into English.\n\nComparison of Two Different Nouns\n\npiù… di more… than meno… di less… than\n\nComparison sentences with two different nouns (person, place, or thing) are given below. The nouns that are being compared are red.\n\nPietro ha più soldi\n\ndi Caterina. Peter has more money\n\nthan Kathy. Caterina ha meno soldi di Pietro. Kathy has less money than Peter. La casa di Pietro è più grande\n\ndella casa di Caterina. Peter’s house is larger\n\nthan Kathy’s house. Firenze è più piccola di Roma. Florence is smaller than Rome.\n\nThis Italian sentence structure using di also works\n\nwhen making comparisons using piacere between two nouns\n\nthat have different characteristics.\n\nLet’s look into how to make comparisons with the verb piacere. Piacere is how Italians say they like something. (If you need a refresher on how to conjugate the verb piacere, visit our blog, “Piacere — How Italians Say, ‘I like it!'”)\n\nPiacere often comes into play to describe how much we like doing something compared to something else. For instance, in a prior blog, “Let’s Talk About… TV and Movies in Italian.” we discussed how to state a preference for one film over another. The two lines below give the correct Italian sentence structure and again use più di and meno di.\n\nMi piace… (film) più di + definite article… (film).\n\nMi piace… (film) meno di + definite article… (film).\n\nMi piace il film La Vita è Bella più delle serie Commissario Montalbano.\n\nI like the film Life is Beautiful more than the series Detective Montalbano. Mi piace il film Pane e Tulipani meno di La Vita è Bella.\n\nI like Bread and Tulips less than Life is Beautiful.\n\n**********************************************************\n\nUse “Che” to Compare\n\nItalian Verbs, Adjectives and Adverbs\n\nHowever, to combine two different verbs, adverbs or adjectives where one has a superior or inferior characteristic, or one is liked more than another, substitute che for di. The two lines below use più che and meno che with the verbs correre and nuotare in green, and the adjectives giallo and rosso in brown. Notice that the subject is the same in these comparisons — in this case, the subject is what one likes but of course one can substitute “mi piace” with a noun (person, place or thing).\n\nThe English transition when comparing two verbs uses the present progressive tense (-ing verb).\n\nMi piace correre più che nuotare.\n\nI like running more than swimming. Mi piace giallo meno che rosso.\n\nI like yellow less than red.\n\nFinally, use più che or meno che if making a comparison that uses a preposition.\n\nRosa è più contenta con te che con me.\n\nRose is happier (more happy) with you than with me.\n\nOr use che alone to express a preference.\n\nPreferisco partire il 7 che il 5 di mattina.\n\nI prefer to leave at 7 than at 5 in the morning.\n\n**********************************************************\n\nUse “Di” with\n\nIrregular Adverbs\n\nComparative sentences that use adverbs are common, since people often discuss how well (bene) — or how badly (male) — something is going. To compare how one action is better or worse compared to another, use the irregular comparative adverbs meglio and peggio with the preposition di and the same sentence structure described in the last section of this blog.\n\nIn the examples below, the adverb that is used in the comparison is in brown and its verb in green.\n\nCaterina parla italiano bene. Kathy speaks Italian well. Caterina parla italiano meglio di Francesca. Kathy speaks Italian better than Frances. Francesca parla italiano male. Frances speaks Italian badly. Francesca parla italiano peggio di Caterina. Frances speaks Italian worse than Kathy.\n\nTo express the relative superlative “the best” or “the worst” in Italian, one can simply use the comparative sentence structure we have learned with the Italian phrases “meglio di tutti” or “peggio di tutti.”\n\nCaterina parla italiano meglio di tutti. Kathy speaks Italian better than everyone. Meaning: Kathy speaks Italian the best. Francesca parla italiano peggio di tutti. Frances speaks Italian worse than everyone. Meaning: Frances speaks Italian the worst.\n\nMeglio is used in the same way when talking about a thing, rather than a person. For instance, to compare a recent film with a well-known TV series, see the example below from our blog “Let’s Talk About… TV and Movies in Italian.”\n\nThis film is better than…\n\nQuesto film è meglio di + definite article…\n\nQuesto film è meglio del Commissario Montalbano, sono sicuro!\n\nThis film is better than Detective Montalbano, I am sure.\n\nEqually important are comparisons made with the adverbs very (molto) or little (poco). People have a tendency to make comparisons between doing something more (più) or doing something less (meno). We have seen the Italian adverbs piu and meno in action in the first section as part of the sentence structure for making a comparison. When used with the meaning of “more” or “less,” piu and meno are considered irregular adverbs.\n\nHowever, when making a comparison in Italian using più or meno with the meanings of more or less, speakers often don’t mention the second term. This is common in every day conversation when both speakers already know the topic under discussion. When the second term in the comparison is omitted, the preposition di is added before più or meno to complete the sentence.\n\nUse di più or di meno, rather than simply più or meno\n\nwhen the second term of the comparison is not stated.\n\nIn the examples below, the adverb used in the comparison is in brown and its verb in green.\n\nPietro ha mangiato molta pizza. Peter ate a lot of pizza. Pietro ha mangiato più pizza di Michele. Peter ate more pizza than Michael. Pietro ha mangiato di più. Peter ate more. Michele ha mangiato poca pizza. Michael ate a little pizza. Michele ha mangiato meno pizza di Pietro. Michael ate less pizza than Peter. Michele ha mangiato di meno. Michael ate less.\n\nTo express “the most” or “the least” in Italian, one can simply use the comparative sentence structure we have learned with the Italian phrases “più di tutti” or “meno di tutti.”\n\nPietro ha mangiato più di tutti. Peter ate more than everyone. Meaning: Peter ate the most. Michele ha mangiato meno di tutti. Michael ate less than everyone. Meaning: Michael ate the least.\n\n*************************************************\n\nUse “Di” with\n\nIrregular Adjectives\n\nSee the irregular comparative adverbs we have just discussed in the previous section in the table below, along with their relative superlative adjectives and phrases.\n\nAdverb Comparative\n\nAdverb Relative Superlative Adjective/Phrases bene well meglio better\n\nil migliore the best male badly peggio il peggiore the worst molto very più\n\ndi più\n\nmore più\n\nla maggior parte di\n\nil maggior numero di the most poco a little meno\n\ndi meno\n\nless meno\n\nil minimo di\n\nla minima parte di the least\n\nNow let’s talk about the relative superlative adjectives in the third column of our table above.\n\nThe Best and the Worst in Italian:\n\nEarlier in this blog, we mentioned that to express the relative superlative adjective “the best” in Italian, one can simply use the Italian phrase “meglio di tutti” to state “better than everyone.”\n\nHowever, when we use the irregular adjective “il migliore” to state someone or something is “the best,” a different sentence structure is required. One might say Italian is more precise than English since Italian expresses the difference between Frances the person and Frances’ knowledge of Italian. In English, this difference is simply understood. (If you need a refresher on how to state possession with the Italian preposition di, visit a prior blog in this series, “How to Use “Di” in Italian.”)\n\nIn short, an Italian sentence that uses the adjective migliore must start with the noun that migliore modifies. Once again, we encounter differences in the English and Italian way of thinking — in this case about how to be the best!\n\nBelow are examples from the prior section again, with the addition of a sentence with “il migliore” for comparison. The last example also includes “the worst,” or “il peggiore,” which follows the same sentence structure. The adverb that is being compared is in brown and its verb in green. The noun described as “the best” or “the worst” is in red.\n\nCaterina parla italiano meglio di tutti. Kathy speaks Italian better than everyone. Meaning: Kathy speaks Italian the best. L’italiano di Caterina è il migliore. Meaning: Kathy’s Italian is the best. Francesca parla italiano peggio di tutti. Frances speaks Italian worse than everyone. Meaning: Frances speaks Italian the worst. L’italiano di Francesca è il peggiore. Meaning: Frances’ Italian is the worst.\n\nThe Most in Italian:\n\nPreviously in this blog, we mentioned that to express the relative superlative adjective “the most” in Italian, one can simply use the Italian phrase “più di tutti” to state “more than everyone.”\n\nWe can also use più in a sentence that starts with a noun followed by quello(a,i,e) to express the idea of “the most.” Use this Italian way of speaking to refer to the greatest quantity of something, measure of something (tangible or intangible), or number of something. The Italian sentence structure is similar to the examples given for how to use migliore and peggiore. English speakers tend to express the same idea in a different way, as noted by the translations below.\n\nIl bicchiere di Marco è quello che ha più vino. Mark has the most wine in his glass. Anna è quella della famiglia che è più bella. Ann is the most beautiful of all of us in the family. Quest’albero è quello che ha più mele. This tree is the one with the most apples.\n\nTwo other phrases, “la maggior parte di” and “il maggior numero di” can also mean “the most,” regarding “the greatest quantity” and “the greatest number” of something.\n\nAlso, “Per la maggiore parte…” is commonly used to say, “For the most part…”\n\nOur original examples are listed below again, with additional ways to say “the most.” Notice how the meaning changes with the use of the last two phrases. Also that “fetta di” is itself a separate phrase, so that di is not combined with the definite article.\n\nPietro ha mangiato più di tutti.\n\nPeter ate more than everyone/the most.\n\nPietro ha mangiato la maggior parte della pizza.\n\nPeter ate most (the most part of) of the pizza.\n\nPietro ha mangiato il magior numero di fette di piazza.\n\nPeter ate most (the most number of) of the pieces of the pizza.\n\nThe Least in Italian:\n\nFinally, to say “the least,” one can use “meno” with quello(a) and the same sentence structure as described above for più.\n\nMichele è quello della famiglia che ha mangiato meno pizza.\n\nMichael has eaten the least pizza of all of us in the family.\n\n“Il minimo di” and “la minima parte di” can also be used to describe “the least.” See examples below. Remember to change the ending of minimo(a) to match the gender of the noun that is modified.\n\nMichele ha mangiato meno di tutti.\n\nMichael ate less than everyone/the least pizza.\n\nMichele ha mangiato la minima parte della pizza. Michael ate the least (amount of) pizza.\n\nMichele ha mangiato il minimo del pane. Michael ate the least (amount of) bread.\n\nRemember how to make comparisons with\n\nthe Italian preposition “di” in conversation\n\nand I guarantee you will use the Italian “di” every day!\n\nDo you want to speak Italian more easily and confidently in 2022?\n\nWhy not set a goal to learn Italian, starting today, for the year 2022? I will try to help you with this goal by posting a new blog every month in the series “Italian Phrases We Use EVERY Day!”® With these blogs, I discuss how Italians use their language on a daily basis and in so doing help you to “think in Italian.”\n\nTo speak fluently in another language, it is important to know how to introduce an object, or to describe direction, location or time. We do this naturally in our own language with prepositions — short words like of, to, at/in/from, and by. All languages use prepositions but the choice of preposition in a given situation will differ from one language to another. This is the case for English and Italian; English and Italian often use prepositions in a different way. Also, in some situations Italian sentence structure may require a preposition where English does not!\n\nLet’s start our new series on Italian prepositions with the essential Italian preposition “di.” If we learn how to use the Italian preposition “di,” which can be translated into the English prepositions “of, from,” and “by,” we will truly sound like a native Italian!\n\nThis post is the 54th in a series of Italian phrases we have been trying out in our Conversational Italian! Facebook group. If you’d like to read the earlier posts in the series, “Italian Phrases We Use EVERY Day!” just click HERE\n\nMany “commonly used phrases”\n\nin Italian use\n\nthe preposition “di”\n\nSee below for how this works.\n\nAs we all master these phrases, so will you. Try my method and let me know how it works. What sentences will you create with these phrases?\n\nPlease reply. I’d love to hear from you! Or join our Conversational Italian! group discussion on Facebook.\n\nThe basics of the Italian language are introduced in the Conversational Italian for Travelers textbook and reference books Just the Verbs and Just the Grammar *\n\nfound on amazon.com and Learn Travel Italian.com.\n\nThe rights to purchase the Conversational Italian for Travelers books in PDF format on two electronic devices can also be obtained at Learn Travel Italian.com.\n\n*This material adapted from the Conversational Italian for Travelers textbook and reference books Just the Verbs and Just the Grammar\n\n****************************************\n\nUse “Di” to Say\n\nWhere You are From\n\nOne of the most frequent questions asked during polite conversation is, “Where are you from?” This is expressed in Italian with the verb to be (essere) and di, which is translated in English to the preposition from in this situation. The Italian sentence structure is, “From where are you?”\n\ndi + dove + essere from + where + to be\n\nIn proper English, of course, we would say, “Where are you from?” Although the Italian sentence sounds awkward in English, the rule in Italian is never to end a sentence with a preposition; in effect, the English sentence likely sounds awkward to Italians! The answer in Italian will also use di and is followed by the town of one’s birth. Notice that the subject pronoun io (I) is usually left out of the answer, as it is understood from the ending of the verb. For instance:\n\nNote: there is another way of asking where someone is from in Italian — the phrase, “Da dove viene?” This phrase uses the conjunction da with the verb venire, and is a more general reference to where one has been living in prior years. The answer is “Vengo da…” for “I am from…” This phrase will be discussed in more detail in a future blog about the preposition da.\n\nExpressing Possession with “Di”\n\nIn Italian, the word di is used to expresses possession, and in this situation, di means of. To describe ownership of a car in Italian, for instance, one would use di to create the sentence: “Questa è la macchina di Pietro.”\n\nWe can translate the Italian way of thinking into English with the following sentence: “This is the car of Peter.” To the American ear, though, this sounds formal and too wordy. We have the option of expressing this thought with [apostrophe + the letter s] (‘s) tacked onto the name of the person doing the possessing. The English version of our example above would be, “This is Peter’s car.” In Italian, though, if we want to use someone’s name to describe possession, we have only the very first sentence structure: “Questa è la macchina di Pietro.”\n\nGeneral Uses for “Di”\n\n1. In order to express authorship of a work, Italians use di, which in this case corresponds to the English word by. Also use di with the verb conoscere to describe “knowing someone by” their appearance or their name. Notice we may render these ideas a bit differently in English.\n\n2. In order to express what something is composed of, Italians use di. In English, we say “made of,” and in Italian the past particle fatto can be used as an adjective to make the corresponding phrase “fatto(a,i,e) di.” However, in Italian the adjective fatto is optional and the entire meaning of the phrase is usually conveyed just with the preposition di. This is why it is so important to learn how to use Italian prepositions correctly. A short, simple preposition can change the meaning of an entire sentence!\n\nNote: for all metals that are not gold (oro) and for the cloth velvet (velluto) use the preposition in instead of di. These exceptions are simply by convention.\n\n—–but-—-\n\nThere are also many descriptive nouns in English that are composed of two nouns, one of which acts as an adjective to describe the other. Some of these descriptive noun/adjectives must be linked with di in Italian if the descriptive term represents what the main item is made of. For instance the two English words that represent one item from the example silk blouse given above is translated into Italian as camicia di seta. The single English word sandcastle is il castello di sabbia in Italian, or “the castle made of sand.” Descriptive nouns will be covered in more detail in a future blog about da.\n\n3. In order to relate that a topic is being talked about, or discussed/argued about, Italians use di to link certain verbs with the subject matter under discussion. The most common verbs used in this way are: parlare (to talk), discutere (to discuss) and trattarsi, (concerning or regarding).\n\nFor the verb parlare, the Italian preposition di is translated as “about” in English. When a verb follows parlare di or discutere di to complete the sentence, Italian simply adds an infinitive verb after di. English uses [about + gerund of the verb]. You remember, of course, that the gerund is the commonly used “-ing” form of a verb in English. Below are two examples using parlare and discutere.\n\nTrattarsi di is generally used in the third person as “Si tratta di…” to ask and answer the question “What is this regarding?” Parlare often starts a conversation of this type, when one person asks to speak to another about something, someone, or an action. Two example conversations are below; the first could take place between a boss and a worker, the second perhaps between two family members. To add a feeling of urgency or importance to the conversation, the examples start with “devo” for “I have to.” Notice again how the Italian preposition di is always placed at the beginning of a question, just like in the first section examples that ask where someone is from.\n\nTo complete our discussion, note a change in use of the preposition di required in Italian: when talking about a person or something by name. Instead of di, the Italian preposition su is used in the following construction: [su + definite article + noun]. As mentioned previously, if the preposition di were used before a name, the translation would be “by.” For a book, for instance, use of di would mean the person had written the book, rather than the book was about the person under discussion.\n\n4. The verb pensare has a special relationship with the preposition di. When saying, “I think so,” to agree with someone, or “I don’t think so,” to disagree, one might say pensare is being used as a verb of discussion, as in #3 above. In this situation, the conjugated form of pensare is followed by “di si” or “di no.”\n\nAlso use [pensare di+ infinitive verb] when thinking about an action you may want to carry out. But, use [pensare a +noun] when thinking about a person, place, or thing.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, it should be mentioned that [pensare che + subjunctive mood verb] is used to link to phrases with different subjects in a single sentence. However, use of the subjunctive mood is beyond the scope of this blog!\n\n—–but-—-\n\n5. To mention an acquaintance’s age in conversation, use di as part of a descriptive phrase about the individual before giving their age in years. The phrases “all’età di (at the age of) or “a girl/woman, boy/man, etc. of precede the age type of sentence. This sentence structure also works for the age of an inanimate object, such as a bottle of wine!\n\n6. To say something happened “in” or “at” a particular time of day, use di before the Italian words for morning (mattina), afternoon (pomeriggio), evening (sera), or night (notte).\n\n7. To say something happened “in” the summertime or wintertime, use di before the Italian words for summer (estate) and winter (inverno). Use the Italian preposition in for spring (primavera) and autumn (autunno). This is by convention.\n\n8. To say “nothing at all” or “nobody at all” repeat niente (nothing) or nessuno (nobody) and link the words with di.\n\nCommon Expressions with “Di”\n\nAvere and Essere\n\nThere are several Italian phrases used to express one’s feelings that require the preposition di to link the conjugated form of the verb avere with the infinitive form of the verb of action that will complete the sentence. In English, replacing the Italian preposition di with the translation of is variable. In some cases, the English infinitive verb will be used alone or the English expression may use a gerund instead of an infinitive verb. You must really learn to think in Italian to use these expressions! Some examples of how to use these phrases are given in the last column. How many more can you think of?\n\nThere are several expressions of feeling that use the verb essere and take the preposition di prior to adding an infinitive verb to complete a sentence. Again, in English, we do not always use an additional preposition for these phrases, aside from the word to that is already a part of the infinitive verb.\n\nWhen to Use “Di”\n\nto Link Italian Verbs\n\nWhen we link two Italian verbs together in the present tense, the first verb, or helping verb, is conjugated and the second verb, or action verb, is left in the infinitive form. For instance, “Tomorrow, I have to go to work,” is a simple statement that can be translated as, “Domani, devo andare al lavoro.” “I have to” meaning, “I must,” is the first person present tense of dovere, which is devo. Andare means “to go.”\n\nOther helping verbs, such as potere and volere work the same way in the present tense. In fact, using the polite first person of potere, which is può, followed by an infinitive verb, is a simple way to ask for what you need while traveling in Italy. Once you remember “Mi può…” no further conjugation is necessary using this method Just tack on the infinitive verb for what you need and finish the sentence!\n\nSome examples that use [può + infinitive verb] useful for traveling are given below:\n\nAlthough the traveler to Italy can get by with simple phrases, it is important to understand how to create a more complex sentence if one truly wants to be fluent in Italian. This is where the preposition di becomes important. There are some action verbs that need to be followed by the Italian preposition di before an infinitive verb is added to complete the sentence.\n\nMost of the verbs that must use di prior to an infinitive verb describe speaking, thinking, or an activity that needs to be completed. We have already discussed parlare and pensare. Other actions, such as trying to (cercare di), finishing (finire di), and waiting (aspettare di) need the preposition di to join them to an additional verb of activity.\n\nIn the case of cercare, the meaning will change when di is used to link this verb to another. By itself, cercare means to look for, but cercare di means to try to. For the Italian speaker, it is natural to insert the preposition di after certain verbs; it just sounds correct when one has grown up with the Italian language. For the Italian student, listening to Italian will also be important. Listen for the word di when these phrases come up in Italian movies and songs and soon it will become natural to say these phrases correctly!\n\nRemember how to use the Italian preposition “di” in conversation\n\nand I guarantee you will use the Italian “di” every day!\n\nDo you want to speak Italian more easily and confidently in 2022?\n\nNow that 2022 is upon us, why not set a goal to learn Italian, starting today, for the year 2022? I will try to help you with this goal by posting blogs n this series, “Italian Phrases We Use EVERY Day! “® These blogs describe how Italians use their language on a daily basis and in so doing help you to “think in Italian.”\n\nFor instance, did you know that Italians still use impersonal constructions? By “impersonal constructions” I mean sentences that describe what “one” is doing, in order to make a general statement.\n\nA common example of an Italian impersonal construction is the phrase, “Come si dice…” This simple Italian phrase is used by every Italian student at one point or another when asking for help with their vocabulary. The literal translation of “Come si dice…?” is, “How does one say…” In spoken English, this construction is only rarely used today, and usually in formal situations. Instead, to generalize, English speakers often use the collective “you” — directed both at no one in particular and at everyone at the same time! Especially in an informal conversation, “Come si dice…” would be translated as, “How do you say…?” But in Italian, when one generalizes, he or she cannot replace the “si” for “one” with “tu” for “you” the way we do in English.\n\nIf we learn how to use impersonal phrases in Italian, with Italian reflexive verbs, we will be able to ask general questions, give directions, and even express how mechanical objects work!\n\nThis post is the 52nd in a series of Italian phrases we have been trying out in our Conversational Italian!

Reflexive verbs are recognized by the –si ending of their infinitive form. Let’s review a bit about reflexive verbs before going on to discuss how they are used to make impersonal statements.\n\nDirect reflexive verbs, as their name suggests, are used when an action refers back directly to the speaker in the subject of the sentence. For example, if one wants to describe the everyday act of falling asleep in Italian, they must use the reflexive verb addormentarsi. Italian reflexive verbs are also used to express the English concept of “to get,” as we’ve seen in a prior Italian Phrases We Use EVERY Day blog. When one “gets mad,” they must express this concept in Italian with the verb arrabbiarsi. Consider also the every day activity of “getting dressed,” with mettersi, which was the focus of another blog in this series, How We Dress in Italian.\n\nAll Italian students are introduced to a direct reflexive verb of the –arsi type at the very beginning of their studies, when they learn how to introduce themselves with the reflexive verb that means “to be named,” which is chiamarsi. There are, of course, also reflexive verbs of the –ersi and –irsi types as well, such as mettersi (to put on clothes/to get dressed) and divertirsi (to enjoy oneself).\n\nThe necessary component of all reflexive verbs is the reflexive pronoun (myself, yourself, himself, etc.), which is what actually corresponds to and refers directly back to the subject.\n\nTo review, the reflexive pronouns are:\n\nmi – myself\n\nti – yourself (familiar)\n\nsi – yourself (pol.)/ herself, himself, itself, oneself\n\nci – ourselves\n\nvi – yourselves (familiar)\n\nsi – themselves\n\nTo conjugate a reflexive verb, start with the subject pronoun and follow with the corresponding reflexive pronoun. However, remember that for conversational Italian the subject pronoun is usually left out of the sentence and is only sometimes included for emphasis.\n\nOur first table below starts us on our way to the complete conjugation of a reflexive verb by pairing each subject pronoun with its corresponding reflexive pronoun:\n\nio mi I myself tu ti you (familiar) yourself Leilei/lui si you (polite)she/he yourselfherself, himself,\n\nitself, oneself noi ci we ourselves voi vi you all yourselves loro si they yourselves (polite)\n\nthemselves\n\nAll we need to do now is to add our verb to create the action! Notice that the English translation adds the reflexive pronoun after the verb, while in Italian the reflexive pronoun comes before the verb (except for familiar commands). This may take a little time to get used to!\n\nLet’s conjugate divertirsi — to have fun / enjoy oneself — as an example:\n\nio mi diverto I enjoy myself tu ti diverti you (familiar) enjoy yourself Leilei/lui si diverte you (polite) enjoy yourself she/he enjoys herself, himself noi ci divertiamo we enjoy ourselves voi vi divertite you all enjoy yourselves loro si divertono they enjoy themselves\n\nHow to Make Impersonal Statements\n\nItalian Reflexive Pronouns\n\nGeneralizations in the third person, called impersonal statements, are used sparingly in English but are common in Italian. An Italian impersonal statement is created by using the reflexive pronoun si, along with a verb in the singular or plural third person (either the lei/lui or the loro form).\n\nAs noted from the conjugation tables from the first section…\n\nwhen the reflexive pronoun si is used in the singular third person, the reference is to a single, unnamed person, and the subject can be translated as “one.”\n\nwhen the reflexive pronoun si is used in the plural third person, the reference is to a group of unnamed people and the subject can be translated as “they.”\n\nIn both situations, the speaker is referring in general to someone,\n\nwithout a individual or group of people in mind.\n\nIt makes sense, then, that these statements are called “impersonal statements.”\n\nA common example of an Italian impersonal statement is the phrase, “Come si dice…” This simple Italian phrase is used by every Italian student at one point or another when asking for help with their vocabulary. The literal translation of “Come si dice…?” is, “How does one say…” This construction is only rarely used in spoken English today, and usually in formal situations. Instead, when an English speaker wants to generalize, he or she often uses the collective “you” — directed both at no one in particular and at everyone at the same time! Especially in an informal conversation, “Come si dice…” would be translated into English as, “How do you say…?” But in Italian, when one generalizes, he or she cannot replace the “si” for “one” with “tu” for “you” the way we do in English.\n\nSome generalizations that come up frequently in Italian conversation are listed below. The direct Italian translation is given first, with the English phrase more commonly used to express the same idea in the following translation. You may want to remember the first example when asking for help with your Italian!\n\nCome si dice…? How (does) one say…?\n\nHow do you say…? Come si dicono…? How (do) they say…\n\nHow (do) you all say...\n\nIn Italia, si parla italiano. In Italy, one speaks Italian.\n\nIn Italy, Italian is spoken. In America, si parlano molte lingue. In America, they speak many languages.\n\nIn America, many languages\n\nare spoken.\n\nSi può fare? Can one do it?\n\nCan it be done?\n\nCan you do it? Si sa che… One knows that…\n\nYou know that… Non si sa mai! One never knows!\n\nYou never know!\n\nImpersonal statements can also be used to describe a rule and are often found in Italian sayings or proverbs.\n\nSi deve obbedire alla legge. One must obey the law.\n\nYou have to obey the law. Non si paga per parcheggiare la domenica. One doesn’t pay for parking on Sundays.\n\nYou don’t pay for parking on Sundays.\n\nQualche volta, uno si trova a un bivio della propria vita. Sometimes, one finds himself at a crossroads of his life. Vivendo s’impara. One learns by living.\n\nUse Italian impersonal statements when giving directions, such as when talking a friend through a recipe for a favorite dish. For instance, to describe how to make your family’s Italian tomato sauce, use the common verbs aggiungere (to add) and mettere (to put) in the third person singular with the reflexive pronoun “si” to describe how “one” cooks. For examples, see the first table below. In English, of course, we default to “you” when giving directions to someone in conversation, and this is reflected in the translation. To follow are a few pointers about how to cook pasta to go with that delicious pot of tomato sauce!\n\nPrima, si taglia a pezzi una cipolla e uno spicchio d’aglio. First, one chops an onion and a clove of garlic into small pieces.\n\nFirst, you chop… Poi, si mette la verdura in pentola con l’olio di oliva. Then, one puts the vegetables in a pot with olive oil.\n\nThen, you put… Li si cuoce, si mescola bene, fino a quando tutti e due sono morbidi. One cooks them, sautéing well, until both are soft.\n\nYou cook them… Si aggiunge la passata di pomodoro, l’acqua, e il basilico. One adds tomato puree, water, and basil.\n\nYou add… Si agguinge un po’ di sale e pepe. One adds a little bit of salt and pepper.\n\nYou add… Si cuoce la salsa per almeno un’ora, e si mescola bene. One cooks the sauce for at least one hour, stirring well.\n\nYou cook the sauce… and you mix…\n\nPer la pasta perfetta, si deve seguire questo metodo: For the perfect pasta, one must follow this method:\n\nFor the perfect pasta, you must… Si mette una pentola grande con tanta acqua sui fornelli. One puts a large pot with lots of water on the stovetop.\n\nYou put… Si copre e si riscalda l’aqua fino a bollire. One covers it and heats up the water until it is boiling.\n\nYou cover it… you bring the water to boil… Si aggiunge una manciata di sale, si ricopre la pentola, e si riscalda l’aqua fino a fare bollire di nuovo. One adds a handful (lots) of salt, one covers the pot, and brings the water to boil again.\n\nYou add… you recover the pot… and you bring the water to boil… Quando l’acqua sta bollendo, scoperchiare la pentola e aggiungere la pasta.\n\nSi deve mescolare bene a questo punto. When the water is boiling, uncover the pot and add the pasta.\n\nOne must mix well at this point.\n\nYou must mix well… Si fa bollire la pasta secondo le istruzioni nella scatola della pasta. One must boil the pasta according to the directions on the pasta box.\n\nYou must boil the pasta… Quando la pasta è al dente, scolare l’acqua e aggiungere la salsa! When the pasta is “al dente,” drain the water and add the sauce!\n\nHow to Describe Movement with\n\nItalian Reflexive Verbs\n\nWhen an inanimate object does something automatically, this idea is rendered in Italian using the third person of a reflexive verb. In many situations, Italian uses a reflexive verb to describe movement when English relays the same idea by combining the verb with a preposition, such as “on” or “up.” Note that in English, the preposition is added only to change the meaning of the verb. In the same way, Italian uses a reflexive verb, with its reflexive pronoun, to change the meaning of a verb.\n\nLet’s take a simple, everyday situation at home for our first example: “Ann turns on the light.” The verb that means “turn on” in Italian is accendere and the Italian translation is, “Anna accende la luce.” However, electric lights can be programmed to turn on automatically. In English, I can say, “The automatic light turns itself on when I enter the room.” Although the preposition “on” is required in English, the reflexive pronoun “itself” is optional. To convey the same idea, it is mandatory in Italian to use the reflexive verb accendersi: “La luce automatica si accende quando entro la stanza.”\n\nIn short, English sometimes uses a third person reflexive verb to describe an automatic action but often does not, instead relying on the addition of a preposition. Italian is more consistent, with a reflexive counterpart to most verbs of action that refer to mechanical movement.\n\nAnother simple action that requires a reflexive verb in Italian and a verb + preposition combination in English is that of “rising up” or “going up.” The verb alzare means “to raise” or “to lift” something. “I lifted the box onto the table,” is a simple sentence that translates as, “Ho alzato la scatola sul tavolo.” But if a person “gets up” in the morning, the action becomes reflexive and the verb alzarsi is needed. Similarly, a bird or an inanimate object such as a kite can “rise up” or “go up” into the sky and the verb alzarsi once again comes into play.\n\nBelow are some examples of how Italians use reflexive verbs to describe movement of inanimate objects. Notice exceptions to what we have just discussed: the verb cominciare (to start) and cadere (to fall) are not reflexive when speaking about an inanimate object. However, mettersi a followed by an infinitive verb can be used in the third person to describe an inanimate object or an act of nature starting to do something by itself. Also, the verb smettere (to stop) is not used in a reflexive way, although fermare, which also means to stop, does have a reflexive counterpart: the verb fermarsi.\n\nLa luce automatica si accende quando entro la stanza. The automatic light turns (itself) on when I enter the room. Le luci della casa si accendono ogni sera. The house lights turn (themselves) on every night. Le luci della casa si spengono ogni sera. The house lights turn (themselves) off every morning.\n\nL’acensore si apre. The elevator opens. L’acensore si chiude. The elevator shuts.\n\nIl treno comincia l’itinerario.Il treno si mette ad andare velocemente. The train starts its route.The train starts to go fast. Il treno si ferma automaticamente. The train stops automatically.\n\nIl gabbiano si alza e vola via. The sea gull rises up and flies away. L’aquilone si alza nelle nuvole. The kite rises into the clouds. Le foglie cadono per terra ogni autunno. The leaves fall to the ground every autumn.\n\nHow to Describe Nature and Life with\n\nItalian Reflexive Verbs\n\nWe all know the forces of nature well, as they act every day to create the environment in which we live. Since nature is an inanimate being, the actions of the weather are often given with reflexive verbs in Italian. Listen closely to the Italian news and you will hear about how a volcano in Sicily finally stopped erupting, or how the sea has begun to rise in the Venetian lagoon — all described in the third person with Italian reflexive verbs!\n\nFor the common phrases that describe what weather “it” is making, such as, “Fa caldo oggi” (“It is hot today”) or “Fa freddo oggi” (“It is cold today”), Italians use fare in the third person without an indirect object pronoun. But to say, “It is getting late,” or “It is getting dark,” we use the reflexive farsi for the phrases, “Si fa tarde” or “Si fa buio.” (For more of these common phrases, visit our blog in this series, “Lets talk about… the weather in Italian!”)\n\nIn the same way, it is often necessary to use Italian reflexive verbs when speaking about abstract forces that can “act” on our lives. Life itself is often spoken of as “moving” slowly or quickly. However, there is no reflexive verb for passare, so time can be seen as “passing by” without the addition of a reflexive pronoun. (For more ways to use passare, visit our blog in this series, “The Many Uses of Passare.” )\n\nIn short, to understand the nuances of how to use reflexive verbs to describe actions of the weather or make generalizations about life, it is helpful to listen to native Italians as much as possible. In this way, it will eventually become natural to use Italian verbs the way Italians do!\n\nThe examples discussed above are listed below.\n\nL’eruzione del vulcano in Sicilia si è fermato. The eruption of the volcano in Sicily has stopped. L’acqua a Venezia si è alzata due metri\n\ne si sta alzando ancora! The water in Venice has risen 2 meters and is still rising! Fa caldo oggi. / Fa freddo oggi. It is warm today. / It is cold today Si fa tarde. / Si fa buio. It’s getting late. / It is getting dark.\n\nNella campagna, la vita si muove lentamente. In the country, life moves slowly. Il tempo passa lentamente quando si aspetta. Time passes slowly for one who waits (when one is waiting for something.)\n\nListen carefully to Italians when they speak\n\nand I guarantee you will hear\n\nItalian impersonal statements and Italian reflexive verbs\n\nevery day!\n\nAvailable on amazon.com and Learn Travel Italian.com\n\nDo you want to speak Italian more easily and confidently by the end of 2021?\n\nI have been trying to help you by posting blogs in the series “Italian Phrases We Use EVERY Day! “® With these blogs, I discuss how Italians use their language on a daily basis and in so doing help you to “think in Italian.”\n\nMany Italian verbs have a similar use to those in English, which simplifies translation from one language to the other. However, many times the meaning of an Italian verb will vary from the usual English connotation.

Tenere (along with its reflexive form tenersi, and the pronominal verb tenerci) is one of those verbs that is used in many ways in Italian and is important to “keep in mind” if one wants to use it correctly.\n\nAs I’ve said before, I believe that “commonly used phrases” are the key for how we can all build fluency in any language in a short time.\n\nIf we learn how to incorporate “commonly used phrases” when use the Italian verb tenere, we will be able to communicate just as we do in our native language!\n\nThis post is the 50th in a series of Italian phrases we have been trying out in our Conversational Italian!

It is important to “keep in mind” the nuances of the verb tenere to create sentences as we would in our native language.\n\nThe Italian verb tenere is most often translated into English as “to hold” or “to keep.” It can be used in a simple way, to describe holding an object or holding another’s hand. As in English, the verb tenere can also mean “to hold,” with reference to capacity, as in how many objects or people can occupy or be contained in a certain space or place. The word “hold” in English can also take on the connotation of “to support” something (as a column holds up a roof) or someone (as a fan supports his team). So it is with tenere, which can mean “to support.”\n\nTenere is an important verb to use when dining at an Italian restaurant to tell someone to “keep the change.”\n\nWhen the verb tenere is combined with the phrase “conto di,” it takes on different shades of meaning. [Tenere + conto di] is used to describe the concepts of keeping something in mind, keeping track of something, or being aware of something. The phrase can also have the connotation of considering or taking to heart important issues.\n\nCombining the verb tenere with “conto che,” as in [tenere + conto che], adds yet another nuance to the original ideas of “to keep” or “to hold,” and is used to convey the idea of to consider. [Tenere in conto + noun] means to consider something.\n\nTenersi, the reflexive form of tenere, is also often used in the important everyday phrase “keep/stay in contact” and is a nice way to end a conversation or an email with a friend. Tenersi is often used when giving another instructions to hang/hold onto something or abide by/follow certain rules and regulations. If your emotions get the best of you and you can’t keep from laughing or crying, then use [tenersi + da] to get this point across!\n\nThere are many common Italian expressions that combine tenere with the preposition “a.” A few of these expressions will be listed in example sentences below.\n\nWhen the verb tenere is combined with the preposition “a” and an adverb or adjective, as in [tenere +a +molto] the meaning changes once again. [Tenere + a] means to care about someone or something. You might think of using tenere in this way as being similar to the English phrase “to hold someone dear.” Consider also that the adjective tenero(a) is used to describe the following characteristics: tender, sensitive, or warm. For full emphasis, the pronominal verb tenerci followed by “a” [tenerci + a] can be used to stress the importance of something. A description of pronominal verbs and their uses is beyond the scope of this blog, but rest assured, if you add the pronoun “ci” before “tengo a,” you are telling someone that something is important to you!\n\nFinally, in some important Italian phrases, tenere can be used interchangeably with the verb avere, and take on the meaning of “to have.”* Using tenere in this manner is a subtle way to emphasize that you are “keeping” or “holding close” the thing that you have.\n\nLet’s talk about how to conjugate tenere in the present, past, and future tenses before using it in some example sentences.\n\nPresent tense: tenere is an irregular -ere verb in the present tense, since it has an irregular stem in all forms but the noi and voi forms. The present tense conjugation is below. The irregular stem is in brown:\n\nio\n\ntengo\n\ntu\n\ntieni\n\nLei,lei,lui\n\ntiene\n\nnoi\n\nteniamo\n\nvoi\n\ntenete\n\nloro\n\ntengono\n\nPast tense: When used in the passato prossimo to describe a single event, avere is the helping verb and the past participle is tenuto.\n\nTenere is regular in the imperfetto past tense (tenevo, tenevi, teneva, tenevamo, tenevate, tenevano).\n\nFuture tense: Tenere is irregular in the future tense due to it’s irregular stem.\n\nio\n\nterrò\n\ntu\n\nterrai\n\nLei,lei,lui\n\nterrà\n\nnoi\n\nterremo\n\nvoi\n\nterrete\n\nloro\n\nterranno\n\n1. Use tenere to describe the simple act of holding something or holding someone’s hand.\n\nTenere can also be used to refer to the capacity of something, or “how much” a certain thing or a place can hold.\n\nTenere can mean “to support” something or somebody.\n\nTieni stretto questo biglietto; tienilo in mano; non lasciarlo! Hold this ticket tightly; hold it in your hand; don’t lose it! Mi piace tenere la mano del mio fidanzato quando camminiamo in piazza. I like to hold my fiance’s hand when we take a walk in the piazza.\n\nL’Allianz Stadium a Torino tiene 41,507 spettatori.* The Allianz Stadium in Turin holds 41,507 spectators. Ho raccolto tutti i fiori che posso tenere in una mano! I have collected all the flowers that I can hold in one hand!\n\nVengo da Turino. Tengo per la Juve / Tifo per la Juve. ** I am from Turin. I support/root for the Juventus soccer team. Le mure sono molto vecchie. Grazie di Dio le colanne tiene il tetto! The walls are very old. Thank goodness the columns support the roof!\n\n* Regarding the use of tenere with the meaning of “to have/to own/to possess”: the verb tenere is used mostly in the south of Italy, while in the north they would simply use the verb avere (example: Lo stadio ha 41,507 spettatori.).\n\n**Regarding the use of tenere to describe support for a sports team: “tengo per” is used in the south of Italy. “Tifo per” is used in the north.\n\n2. Use tenere to mean “to keep” — the simple act of keeping something in a place.\n\nIn a restaurant, a common phrase spoken by the customer to the waiter in both English and Italian is, “Keep the change!” In Italian, the polite command (subjunctive) form of tenere is used for this phrase, often with the addition of the Italian word “pure“ which serves to encourage the server to keep the tip. Use of the subjunctive is beyond the scope of this blog. Just memorize this simple phrase, which should come up often!\n\nTengo gli attrezzi per cucinare di là. I keep the cooking utensils over there. Tenga pure il resto! Keep the change, please!\n\n3. Use [tenere + conto di] with the figurative meanings listed below.\n\nto keep something in mind\n\n[tenere a mente] also means “to keep something in mind”\n\nto keep track of something\n\nto consider (See also #4, listed below)\n\n[tenere in conto + noun] and [tenere conto che] also mean “to consider”\n\n“non tenere in sufficiente considerazione a…” means\n\n“not to give sufficient consideration to…“\n\nto take to heart\n\nHo dovuto tenere conto di tutte le regole che tu mi hai detto al lavoro. I have to keep in mind all the rules you told me at work. Tieni conto dei clienti e dagli quello che vogliono! Keep track of the clients and give them what they want!\n\nMi raccomando, tieni conto di quello che io ho detto! I insist/demand/ (that you) take to heart what I have said! Ho tenuto conto di tutto che tu hai detto. E sono d’accordo! I’ve considered all that you have said. And I agree!\n\n4. Use [tenere + conto che] or [tenere in conto + noun]\n\nfor “to consider.”\n\n“non tenere in sufficiente considerazione a…” means\n\n“not to give sufficient consideration to…“\n\n[tenere conto di] can also mean “to consider” (See #3).\n\nDevo tenere conto che ci sono molte opinioni in questo gruppo prima di prendere una decisione. I have to consider that there are many opinions in this group before making a decision. Devo tenere in conto anche le altre regole. I must also consider the other rules.\n\n5. Use the reflexive verb tenersi to ask someone to “keep/stay” in touch or give a command to “follow/abide by” a rule.\n\nOther translations of tenersi include “hang onto” and “hold onto”.\n\n[Tenersi + da] can also be used to express the phrase “to keep from…” doing something, such as laughing or crying. In this case, tenere is often combined with the verb riuscire, which means “to manage to,” and further emphasizes the effort one has put into trying to “keep from” doing something. To learn more about how to use the verb riuscire, visit another blog in this series: “The Many Uses of the Italian Verb “Ruscire.”\n\n6. Common Italian phrases with [tenere + a]\n\n7. Use [tenere + a + adverb/adjective] or [tenerci + a] to describe caring about something very much\n\nRemember another way to talk about platonic love and caring among family members and friends is to use the verb volerci, with the phrase, “Ti voglio bene.” For a review of the many ways to express one’s feelings of love, visit our blog in this series: “How to Talk About Relationships and Love in Italian.”\n\n[Tenerci + a] can also be used in an introductory phrase when the speaker wants to emphasize the importance of what they will talk about or what they have done. Therefore, this phrase is often followed by the verb dire or fare.\n\n8. Use the tenere in place of avere for certain expressions.\n\nRemember how to use the Italian verbs tenere, tenersi, and tenerci in conversation\n\nand I guarantee you will use these verbs every day!\n\nDo you want to speak Italian more easily and confidently by the end of 2021?\n\nI have been trying to help you with this goal by posting a new blog every month in the series “Italian Phrases We Use EVERY Day!”® With these blogs, I discuss how Italians use their language on a daily basis and in so doing help you to “think in Italian.”\n\nTwo of the most popular every day phrases are, “He said to me… ” or “She said to me…” In fact, the equivalent phrase in Italian, “Mi ha detto.” is used so often that it usually comes out in quickly, in one breath!\n\nIn this blog, we will discuss the popular phrase “Mi ha detto,” and use it as a springboard into a discussion of indirect object pronouns that can be used with the verb dire and many other Italian verbs as well.\n\nAs I’ve said before, I believe that “commonly used phrases” are the key for how we can all build fluency in any language in a short time.\n\nIf we learn how to incorporate “commonly used phrases” when use the Italian verb dire, we will be able to communicate just as we do in our native language!\n\nThis post is the 47th in a series of Italian phrases we have been trying out in our Conversational Italian!

The past tense for “he said” and “she said” in Italian, a one-time event, uses the passato prossimo, and is “ lui/lei ha detto.” This Italian past tense verb also translates into the less commonly used English past tense, “he has said” and “she has said.”\n\nSince the subject pronoun is generally left out of an Italian sentence, we are left with “ha detto” to describe both what he said and what she said. The subject pronouns lui (he) or lei (she) may be added before the verb for emphasis in this case, but generally those having a conversation know who they are talking about.\n\nBecause the phrases “he said” and “she said” are used frequently in everyday conversation, we should commit the Italian passato prossimo verb “ha detto” to memory.\n\nTo make a complete sentence using the verb dire to describe what was said, use either “di” or “che” to link the subject and verb to the topic that was discussed. Di is used as the conjunction in the examples in the table below to answer a question in the affirmative or negative. Of course, even though our focus in this blog is on how to use the verb ha detto, it should be noted that one usually answers “yes,” or “no,” for themselves with ho detto, although they can also relay someone else’s answer using a different conjugation of dire, such as ha detto, abbiamo detto, etc. In all situations, when answering “yes” or “no” in Italian, the conjunction di is required.\n\n****************************************\n\nAdding an indirect object pronoun before the verbs ho detto, abbiamo detto, or ha detto will allow the speaker to describe to whom something was said. For this section, though, our discussion will focus only on “ha detto” and Italian indefinite articles.\n\nWhy focus on “ha detto?“ One of the most popular every day phrases is, “He/She said to me,” which is, “Mi ha detto” in Italian. In fact, the phrase “mi ha detto” is used so often that it usually said in one breath! We can build on this simple, easy to remember phrase to describe more complex situations. For instance, we can substitute other indirect object pronouns for mi (to me), such as ti (to you), gli (to him), or le (to her).\n\nIn English, when we use the indirect object pronouns “to me,” “to you,” “to him/her,” they are placed after the verb, while in Italian, they are placed before the verb. This may take some time to get used to. In the summary table below, the indirect object pronouns are in red.\n\nThe next table uses our verb ha detto and indirect object pronouns in example sentences. For these examples (and for all other instances in Italian except those given in the table in the previous section regarding a “yes” or “no” answer), “che” is used as the conjunction.\n\nThe subject pronoun is included in some of the examples in the table below for clarity. Again, the Italian and English indirect object pronouns are in red. In all cases except the first, when the subject is directly quoting what someone else has said to them, English uses a direct object pronoun, and this is given in green. Notice how many permutations of the same sentence are possible with only the singular indirect object pronouns!\n\n****************************************\n\nOur example sentence, “Mi ha detto che il film era bello,” and its translation, “He/She told me that the film was good,” brings up an important difference between Italian and English verbs and object pronouns; not all Italian verbs that take indirect object pronouns do so in English!\n\nWe have just seen the the Italian verb dire takes an indirect object pronoun that goes before the verb, whereas its English counterpart “to say,” in general conversation usually takes a direct object pronoun that goes after the verb. We would not say, “He told to me that the film was good,” although this is correct in Italian!\n\nThis adds to the difficulty in choosing when to use an Italian indirect object pronoun, since the correct English translation will not always reflect the indirect object pronoun choice in Italian.\n\nThe difference in the Italian and English [object pronoun-verb] combination may not be immediately apparent in the phrase “mi ha detto,” since the Italian pronoun mi plays double duty as both an indirect and direct object pronoun! The Italian pronoun mi can be translated as both “me” (direct object pronoun) and “to/for me” (indirect object pronoun).*\n\nThe same goes for the Italian pronoun ti, which is translated as “you”(direct object pronoun) as well as “to you“ (indirect object pronoun).*\n\nChoosing between an indirect and direct Italian object pronoun when conversing about others in Italian becomes important in the masculine third person, as one must decide between lo (him) and gli (to him). For females, the choice is between la (her) and le (to her).\n\nSo how does an English speaker know when to choose an indirect object pronoun in Italian?\n\nItalian verbs of communication and giving\n\ntake indirect object pronouns\n\nwhen referring to a person.\n\nThe table below is a short list of the verbs of communication that take Italian indirect object pronouns when referring to other people in conversation. You will recognize the example verb in this blog, dire, at the top of the list.\n\nNote that if one of these verbs is followed by a person’s name, the Italian pattern to follow is [verb + a + name]. The Italian indirect object pronoun can be though of as substituting for the “a“ placed before a person’s name.\n\nIn some cases, both Italian and English verbs take an indirect object pronoun but in other cases the English translation uses a direct object pronoun, as we’ve already mentioned. Unfortunately, there is no rule that connects the Italian way of speaking to the English way, so the Italian verbs that take [a + name] or indirect object pronouns just need to be memorized. In short, in order to speak Italian, we must think in Italian!\n\n*And, of course with reflexive verbs mi stands for “myself” and ti stands for “yourself.”\n\nSome Italian verbs of communication that take indirect object pronouns:\n\nDire\n\nto say\n\nParlare\n\nto talk\n\nTelefonare\n\nto call\n\nScrivere\n\nto write\n\nDomandare\n\nto ask\n\nChiedere\n\nto ask\n\nInsegnare\n\nto teach\n\nSpiegare\n\nto explain\n\nConsigliare\n\nto give advice\n\nExamples that use Italian verbs of communication with indirect object pronouns are given below.

All the phrases you need to know with tips on how to create your own!\n\nOne of the reviews for the book\n\nP. Zoro4.0 out of 5 stars Effective learning guide Reviewed in the United Kingdom\n\nTravelling to a foreign country can be a terrible experience if you don’t know how to communicate. Kathryn thus solved this potential problem for all foreign visitors to Italy with her book picking on just the important phrases.\n\nTo start with, the book is both exciting and humorous. The reader discovers the Italian alphabethas 21 letters and borrows some additions from Latin. There are surprising differences from English, like z becomes zeta and is pronounced zeh-tah. I spent some time translating my name and found the result amusing. Learning to pronounce the words correctly was an enjoyable experiment in which I found myself closer and closer to sounding very foreign and learned.\n\nI discovered “buongiorno” is all I need to say from morning to early evening, and if I am not yet in my hotel then “buonasera” will do until bedtime. For hi and bye to friends there is just one word to learn – “ciao”, but there are so many ways to say goodbye you really have to take your time to learn them. “Millie Gracie” means thanks a lot (a thousand) though I expected it to be “thanks a million”.\n\nThe writer takes the reader through the basic everyday conversational Italian in an interesting manner. You learn to be polite and formal and at the same time to be friendly and appreciative of any assistance. You also learn how to form important phrases, how to ask for the important things and making friends. The book teaches you to get comfortable at the hotel, at a restaurant and when sightseeing. It is indeed a comprehensive guide I would recommend to anyone travelling to Italy who does not speak Italian.\n\nAs for me if someone says “Parla italiano?” (Do you speak Italian?), I will just say “Si, un po’” (Yes, a little) even though sono di Zimbabwe (I am from Zimbabwe).\n\nSi, I loved this book.\n\nRead the reviews and buy the book: Amazon US – And:Amazon UK –Electronic copies: Learn Travel Italian\n\nAlso by Kathryn Occhipinti\n\nRead the reviews and buy the books: Amazon US – And: Amazon UK – More reviews: Goodreads – Websites: French and Italian: StellaLucente.com – Blogs: Beginning Italian: Conversational Italian! – Twitter: StellaLucente@travelitalian1 and @travelfrench1\n\nAbout Dr. Kathyrn Occhipinti\n\nDr. Kathryn Occhipinti is a radiologist of Italian-American descent who has been leading Italian language groups in the Peoria and Chicago areas for about 10 years.

Today we are “about to” learn two more ways to use the verb stare that you can use every day!\n\nI have been trying to help you to learn Italian by posting a new blog every month in the series “Italian Phrases We Use EVERY Day!”® With these blogs, I discuss how Italians use their language on a daily basis and in so doing help you to “think in Italian.”\n\nAs I’ve said before in this blog series, I believe that “commonly used phrases” are the key for how we can all build fluency in any language in a short time.\n\nIf we learn how to incorporate “commonly used phrases” when we talk about what we are about to do in Italian with the verb stare and the preposition per, we will be able to communicate with the same complexity as we do in our native language!\n\nAnd when we are actually in the process of performing an action, we can use the verb stare again as a helping verb to emphasize that we are doing something right now.\n\nThis post is the 42nd in a series of Italian phrases we have been trying out in our Conversational Italian! Facebook group. If you’d like to read the earlier posts in the series, “Italian Phrases We Use EVERY Day!” just click HERE\n\nMany “commonly used phrases” in Italian\n\nstart with “I am about to”\n\nand use the verb + preposition combination\n\nStare + per\n\nSee below for how this works.\n\nAs we all master these phrases, so will you. Try my method and let me know how it works. What sentences will you create with this verb?\n\nPlease reply. I’d love to hear from you! Or join our Conversational Italian! group discussion on Facebook.\n\nThe basics of the Italian language are introduced in the Conversational Italian for Travelers textbook and reference books Just the Verbs and Just the Grammar\n\nfound on amazon.com and Learn Travel Italian.com.\n\nThe rights to purchase the Conversational Italian for Travelers books in PDF format on two electronic devices can also be obtained at Learn Travel Italian.com.\n\n************************************************\n\nStare per — to be about to\n\nAs we’ve seen in a previous blog about the verb stare, although the direct translation of stare is “to stay,” over the centuries stare has also taken on the meaning of “to be” with respect to one’s general health. The verb stare is often used in other ways as well. For instance, with the addition of the preposition per, the “stare per” combination conveys the meaning “to be about to.”\n\nStare is an –are verb that has an irregular root in the tu and loro forms. In the table below, the regular conjugations of stare are given in green and the irregular forms in brown, in order to make them easier to recognize. The stare conjugation table has been modified from our first blog on this topic to reflect the different meaning with the addition of the preposition per after the verb.\n\nStare per – to be about to\n\nio\n\nsto\n\nper I am about to tu stai\n\nper you (familiar) are about to Lei\n\nlei/lui\n\nsta\n\nper you (polite) are about to\n\nshe/he is about to\n\nnoi stiamo per we are about to voi state\n\nper you all are about to loro stanno\n\nper\n\nthey are about to\n\nOnce we have stare conjugated to reflect the speaker, the rest is easy! Simply follow the conjugated form of stare with per and then the infinitive form of the verb that describes what you are “about to” do.\n\nWhat are some things we may be “about to” do during the course of the day? The actions of going to or returning from a place are very common. For instance, if I were “about to” go to the store to pick up some wine for dinner, and want to inform a family member, the line may go something like this:\n\nSto per andare a comprare una bottiglia di vino. Preferisci rosso o bianco?\n\nI am about to go to buy a bottle of wine. Do you prefer red or white?\n\nOr, maybe your friend is putting on his coat, as if he were about to leave a gathering. Instead, you would like him to stay. You may say something like this (using the familiar command form of restare):\n\nStai per partire? È troppo presto! Resta qui un ora di più con me!\n\nAre you about to leave? It’s very early! Stay here an hour longer with me!\n\nWe can continue in this manner with the other verbs of “coming and going” like arrivare (to arrive), venire (to come), entrare (to enter), tornare (to return), or rientrare (to come back).\n\nThere are many other daily activities that come to mind where stare per may be useful. We are often “about to” say (dire) something important, or “about to” answer (rispondere) a question. We may be “about to” write (scrivere), send (mandare), or read (leggere) an important text or email.\n\nAfter hearing sad news, we may be about to cry (stare per mettersi a piangere).\n\nSeveral commonly used verb combinations given above have been listed in the table below. How many more can you think of?\n\n*******************************\n\nNow that we know how to say what we are about to do in the present tense, let’s go one a step further and talk about the past tense. In fact, many of the phrases listed in the last section are more commonly used in the past tense during a normal conversation.\n\nFor instance, the phrase, “I was about to say…” is often used when one speaker has interrupted another. “I was about to answer…!” might be used if one feels pressured into saying something too quickly. Or, is one is telling a story about an unfortunate event that has happened to a friend, this story might involve the sentence, “He/she was about to cry…”\n\nIn these cases, we have to conjugate stare in the past tense. The imperfetto conjugation is given below. The rest of the sentence structure remains the same!\n\nStare imperfetto per — was about to\n\nio\n\nstavo\n\nper I was about to tu stavi\n\nper you (familiar) were about to Lei\n\nlei/lui\n\nstava\n\nper you (polite) were about to\n\nshe/he was about to\n\nnoi stavamo per we were about to voi stavate per you all were about to loro stavano per\n\nthey were about to\n\nStavo per dire la stessa cosa!\n\nI was about to say the same thing!\n\nStavo per rispondere, ma non mi hai dato il tempo!\n\nI was about to answer, but you didn’t give me time!\n\nStava per mettersi a piangere quando le ho detto che nonna è in ospitale.\n\nShe was about to cry when I told her that grandma is in the hospital.\n\n*******************************\n\nAnother important use for the verb stare is to convey the idea that one is doing something right now. Stare plus the gerund of an action verb creates the present progressive form. In English, the present progressive is the “ing” form of a verb — I am going, coming, doing, etc.\n\nIn Italian, the present progressive tense is used sparingly; it is reserved for a happening that is going on at the exact same time as the conversation. In short, where in English we commonly say “I am going,” to mean we will leave anywhere from one minute later to sometime in the near future, in Italian, a simple, “Io vado,” will suffice. To stress that he or she is leaving momentarily, an Italian might instead use stare say, “Sto andando,”** but either tense is correct.\n\nTo form the present progressive tense, simply conjugate stare to reflect the speaker. Then add the gerund of the action verb that is to follow.\n\nIt is fairly simple to create a gerund to create the present progressive tense in Italian. Drop the -are, -ere, and -ire verb endings to create the stem. Then add –ando to the stem of the -are verbs and -endo to the stem of the -ere and -ire verbs. Most gerunds are regular, which generally makes for easy conjugation, although, of course, there are some exceptions! For more information on this verb type, check out our reference book, Conversational Italian for Travelers “Just the Verbs.”\n\nLet’s take a few of our example sentences one step further, from being “about to” do something, to actually doing it “right away.” Notice how the different use of stare changes the meaning of each sentence!\n\nSto andando a comprare una bottiglia di vino.\n\nI am going (right now) to buy a bottle of wine.\n\nIl treno per Roma sta partendo!\n\nThe train for Rome is leaving (right now)!\n\nStavo dicendo la stessa cosa!\n\nI was (just) saying the same thing!\n\nStavo rispondendo, ma mi hai interrotto!\n\nI was answering, but you interrupted me!\n\nA couple more points…\n\n*Another common way to convey you are leaving right away is with the phrase, “Me ne vado,” from the verb andarsene, but this is a topic for another blog!\n\n*Instead of saying, “Sto arrivando,” for “I’m coming right now,” Italians commonly say, “Arrivo!”\n\nRemember how to use the Italian verb combination stare per in conversation\n\nand I guarantee you will use this verb every day!\n\nAvailable on amazon.com and Learn Travel Italian.com"
