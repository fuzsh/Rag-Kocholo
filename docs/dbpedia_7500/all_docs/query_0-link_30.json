        "text": "Giallo\n\nIn Italian cinema, Giallo (pronounced [ˈdʒallo]; plural gialli, from giallo, Italian for yellow) is a genre of mystery fiction and thrillers that often contains slasher, crime fiction, psychological thriller, psychological horror, sexploitation, and, less frequently, supernatural horror elements.This particular style of Italian-produced murder mystery horror-thriller film usually blends the atmosphere and suspense of thriller fiction with elements of horror fiction (such as slasher violence) and eroticism (similar to the French fantastique genre), and often involves a mysterious killer whose identity is not revealed until the final act of the film. The genre developed in the mid-to-late 1960s, peaked in popularity during the 1970s, and subsequently declined in commercial mainstream filmmaking over the next few decades, though examples continue to be produced. It was a predecessor to, and had significant influence on, the later American slasher film genre.\n\ngiallo\n\nGiallo refers to a genre of Italian horror and thriller films that typically feature elements of mystery, murder, and suspense. The term \"giallo\" translates to \"yellow\" in English, and comes from the yellow covers of pulp fiction novels popular in Italy that inspired the genre. Giallo films often include graphic violence, stylish cinematography, and complex plots with twists and turns.\n\nGiallo\n\nGiallo is an Italian 20th-century genre of literature and film, which in Italian indicates crime fiction and mystery. In the English language it refers to a genre similar to the French fantastique genre and includes elements of horror fiction and eroticism. The word \"giallo\" is Italian for \"yellow\" and stems from the origin of the genre in Italy as a series of cheap paperback mystery novels which all had trademark yellow covers."
