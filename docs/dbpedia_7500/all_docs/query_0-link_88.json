        "text": "3.3K\n\nThe words you’ll most often use when describing colors in Italian are:\n\n• rosso = red\n\n• arancione = orange\n\n• giallo = yellow\n\n• verde = green\n\n• blu = blue\n\n• porpora/viola = purple\n\n• bianco = white\n\n• nero = black\n\n• grigio = grey\n\n• marrone = brown\n\nOf course, there are plenty of other words for different combinations of these colors or nuanced names for particular shades, such as rosa (pink) and azzurro (light blue).\n\nHow you approach learning the Italian language depends on your ultimate objectives. Many early learners start by picking up common words and phrases to replicate the infamous Italian accent—perfecting buongiornio, bruschetta, arrivederci, molto bene, and more. Others may be coming back to Italian after previously studying it in school or exposure to the language in travel. Whatever your aim is for taking on Italian, you should definitely consider a language-learning program built with your goals in mind.\n\nRosetta Stone has experience in designing language-learning programs that build confidence in speaking and understanding Italian. Whether you’re a beginner, or an intermediate Italian speaker looking to advance your fluency, Rosetta Stone can help. With an immersive approach that focuses on contextualizing learning, Rosetta Stone uses an award-winning mobile app to deliver bite-sized lessons that help you learn Italian anytime and anywhere.\n\n>> Explore the colors of Tuscany when you use our list of things to do in Florence!\n\nLearn Italian Words and Phrases\n\nWorried about the commitment of learning Italian ? There’s no need. Rosetta Stone breaks up your language journey into bite-sized lessons, so you can fit them into your life––not the other way around. Whether you’re taking a break from watching the kids, commuting home from your job, or using downtime on campus to enrich your education, Rosetta Stone makes it easy to learn Italian and speak it authentically.\n\nIf you’re a novice learner of Italian, one of the first features you’ll notice is the frequent use of double consonants. You will encounter this again and again in popular words, including the words anno and pizza and the name Alessandra. But even though every Italian word is enunciated a bit differently, there is a general rule of thumb when it comes to pronouncing words with double consonants: to deemphasize the vowel that precedes the double consonants.\n\nAnother notable characteristic of Italian pronunciation relates to the letter c. You may be familiar with the Spanish pronunciation of the letter c which is often spoken as an s sound. (In Spanish this is called el ceceo and differs markedly in Iberian Spanish.) In contrast with the Spanish pronunciation of the letter c, in Italian the letter c can have a hard ch sound, like you hear in the English word “change.”\n\nThat said, the Italian letter c is pronounced differently in other contexts. The Italian letter c can sound like an English c and very similar to the k sound, as you hear in English words like car, can, cat, call, company, Carol, campus, California and code. You’ll hear this same k sound in Italian words. Of note, the words will include one of these vowels; a, o, or u. Examples of these Italian words with a c that sounds like a k include capra, Capri, Campari, cannoli, and campione.\n\nItalian = gnocchi\n\nSpanish = ñoqui\n\nLearning proper Italian pronunciation depends on getting immediate feedback so you can make corrections. Rosetta Stone includes our proven and patented TruAccent™ speech-recognition engine into every lesson. It provides real-time feedback of spoken words with pronunciation and cadence scoring. TruAccent was developed by scanning, analyzing, and integrating the speech of native and non-native Italian speakers. That’s why it can be a valuable tool in helping you learn to understand and speak in Italian.\n\nAfter beginning learners have acquired the Italian basics that make up the building blocks of speaking Italian, they can move on to learning the longer phrases that make up the backbone of everyday conversations. Rosetta Stone’s brief and bite-sized, 10-minute lessons are built to help you do just that. The language lessons will guide you towards speaking Italian with comfort and confidence."
