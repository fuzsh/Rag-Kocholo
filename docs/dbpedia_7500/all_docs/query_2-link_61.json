        "text": "I wrote a blog post last year about Italian coffee’s curious linguistic links, and it seems apt to do a similar version for pasta – but in this case, perhaps, a more simplified post on what the different names mean. Sometimes, unlike the dishes created from them, the meaning can be quite bland!\n\nSpaghetti\n\nSpaghetti Nerano (a Neapolitan dish with zucchini [courgettes] and basil; pictured as home made)\n\nSpaghetti is the most common form of pasta found in Italy, though it is nothing like as dominant in that position as it is globally. It is, for example, very rarely paired with ragù (a word actually borrowed from French) bolognese (i.e. of Bologna).\n\nSpaghetti is a plural diminutive form deriving ultimately from spago ‘cord’. Ultimately, therefore, it means ‘wee cords’.\n\nTagliatelle\n\nTagliatelle al ragù (“alla bolognese”; a traditional meat sauce built on a “soffritto” of carrot and celery; this one was served directly outside Verona Arena)\n\nA flatter, long pasta actually more commonly paired with bolognese is simply a cut (applying to both tagliatelle and bolognese, note -gl- and -gn- in Italian are pronounced similarly to the “-lli-” in English ‘million’ or the “ne-” in British English ‘new’ respectively).\n\nDeriving from the verb tagliare ‘cut’, and specifically from the feminine past participle form tagliata, the suffix -ella is, like -etto, a diminutive suffix (plural -elle, hence tagliatelle).\n\nNote that the tendency in Italian is to describe tagliatelle served with a bolognese sauce simply as tagliatelle al ragù, although alla bolognese may be added for clarity; conversely, a bolognese sauce served within sheets of pasta topped with bechamel is definitively called lasagne alla bolognese (the plural lasagne is preferred to singular lasagna in most but not all regions of the country).\n\nFusilli\n\nFusilli, often used in salads, look quite different from spaghetti, but the linguistic origin is quite similar.\n\nIn this case, fusilli is a plural diminutive of fuso ‘spindle’, thus meaning ‘wee spindles’.\n\nBucatini\n\nBucatini alla Gricia (essentially a traditional Roman Carbonara without egg; that said, Carbonara is not as traditional as some dishes, having emerged only towards the end of World War Two – the name Carbonara likely refers to a charcoal burner, but Gricia is of contested origin; pictured as home made)\n\nBucatini is another pasta taking a plural diminutive form. It is quite like spaghetti but with a hole through the middle – and it is named for that hole.\n\nThe word buco ‘hole’ is simply converted into a diminutive plural form bucatini ‘wee holes’.\n\nPenne\n\nPenne all’Arrabbiata (literally something close to “Penne with raging sauce”, taken from the highly recommended Giallo Zafferano web site)\n\nPenne is quite different from spaghetti, and there tends to be used in quite different dishes.\n\nIt in fact means ‘feathers’. The linguistic curiosity here is nothing to do with food, but rather that the meaning of the word expanded to include feather pens and ultimately just pens – so, in Italian, penne may mean any of ‘feathers’, ‘pens’ or a type of pasta.\n\nOriecchiete\n\nOrecchiette are twirls of pasta, becoming more widespread even outside Italy (note ‘ch’ is pronounced hard in Italian, as /k/).\n\nYet again, the word reflects what it looks like and is a plural diminutive, in this case derived from orecchio ‘ear’ (thus ‘wee ears’).\n\nConchiglie\n\nSlightly smoother in shape that orecchiette are conchiglie (note here the pronunciation: roughly as if “kon-kiyl-yieh”).\n\nIf you are in Italy during the summer you will invariably come across these on the beach – conchiglie are simply ‘seashells’, ultimately deriving from a borrowing into Latin from Greek.\n\nFarfalle\n\nNot totally unlike orecchiette are farfalle, used in similar types of dishes.\n\nThis is a simple one as, like conchiglie, there is no suffix – farfalle translates simply as ‘butterflies’.\n\nVermicelli\n\nNot quite so linguistically appetising, although handy for salads and lighter meals, are vermicelli.\n\nFar from butterflies, this ultimately derives from verme ‘worm’ in its diminutive form, pluralised as vermicelli ‘wee worms’. Perhaps this is why it is also known as a double diminutive spaghettini…\n\nLinguine\n\nLinguine al baffo (baffo is literally ‘moustache’, this dish essentially adds cream and ham; pictured as home made)\n\nLinguine is nothing like the aforementioned orecchiette in the pan, formed of ribbons of pasta somewhere between tagliatelle and spaghetti.\n\nNevertheless, linguistically it is almost identical: it derives from lingua ‘tongue’, made diminutive plural thus linguine ‘wee tongues’.\n\nFettuccine\n\nFettucine al ragù (my own ragu based around chicken rather than beef or pork, as it happens, so obviously pictured as home made)\n\nFettuccine is a ribbon-type pasta, frequently also used in Italian-American dishes.\n\nAgain, here, -ine is a feminine plural diminutive suffix, in this case paired with the simple fettuccia ‘ribbon’ (hence ‘wee ribbons’).\n\nCapellini\n\nCapellini are sometimes known in English as ‘angel-hair pasta’, often paired with chunky meat or tomato sauces.\n\nThe diminutive suffix happens to be masculine here and ultimately shares an origin with cappuccino, deriving from capo ‘head’ and specifically capello ‘hair’.\n\nCaserecce\n\nCaserecce sugo d’anatra (duck ragù, with a similar base to bolognese above; in preparation at home last night)\n\nCaserecce (also casarecce) is a much shorter pasta than spaghetti, linguine, tagliatelle or bucatini. It derives from the Mediterranean Islands, but is found it regional cuisine right across the peninsula.\n\nIt is another suffixed form, although in this case it is not a diminutive – -ereccio (or -areccio) means ‘made’ in a culinary sense. Attached to casa ‘house’, the name caserecce is a feminine plural meaning essentially ‘home made’.\n\nMacaroni\n\n“Macaroni” is in fact an American English spelling; in Italy it is much less used but, where it is, it is spelled maccheroni. The origin is uncertain, but this may simply mean ‘macaroons’.\n\nRigatoni\n\nRigatoni all’amatriciana (a traditional Roman Carbonara but with tomato instead of egg and often red instead of black pepper; named for the village of Amatrice in Lazio but in this case served at ‘Al Vecchio Violino’ in Jesolo, near Venice)\n\nSlightly longer than maccheroni are rigatoni.\n\nHere, the suffix is in fact augmentative rather than diminutive (making bigger rather than smaller): the verb rigare ‘stripe’ gives the more commonly used past participle rigato ‘striped’ which is then augmented via the plural suffix -oni to ‘big striped [pasta]’.\n\nTortellini/Tortelloni\n\nAlso among the larger forms of pasta are tortellini or tortelloni, often used in soups; the latter is the larger.\n\nAmusingly, tortellini is a double diminutive and tortelloni is in fact a diminutive followed by an augmentative (-oni is similar to rigatoni above): Italian has torta ‘cake’, then tortello ‘wee cake’, and then tortellino ‘little wee cake’ (the plural form of which is tortellini; the larger form of this then takes an augmentative rather than a diminutive, hence tortelloni).\n\nRavioli\n\nBest known in its large, stuffed form, ravioli are quite different from other forms of pasta.\n\nIt is thought that the word is linked to rava ‘turnip’, although this is uncertain.\n\nShoes and salt…\n\nIn conclusion, it is worth noting that Italians like to mop up their pasta sauce with bread.\n\nThis is known as fare la scarpetta and there is yet another diminutive: the Italian for ‘shoe’ is scarpe and thus the phrase translates as ‘to do the wee shoe’. You may even choose to do this with a bread known as ciabatta, which is in fact the Italian for ‘slipper’.\n\nAs an aside to conclude, one traditional bread still sold in Rome which dates back to ancient times is presented with slabs of salt inside; modern Romans still buy this as a snack or a pick-me-up (‘pick-me-up’ in Italian is literally tiramisu, but that’s another story). This style of bread is so ancient that it was known to be given to Roman legionaries to keep them going and ensure they could fight at any time: those who could not do so were said to be ‘not worth their salt’…"
