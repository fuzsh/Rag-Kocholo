        "text": "Listen to the pronunciation of the colors by a native Italian speaker in the video.\n\nI colori in Italiano\n\nThe main colors in Italian are:\n\nnero / nera – black\n\nmarrone – brown\n\ngrigio / grigia – gray / grey\n\nbianco / bianca – white\n\ngiallo / gialla – yellow\n\narancione – orange\n\nrosso / rossa – red\n\nrosa – pink\n\nviola – purple *\n\nblu – blue\n\nazzurro / azzurra – light blue\n\nverde – green\n\n* Viola, Violetto or Porpora?\n\nSometimes you will see the color purple incorrectly translated as porpora. This is a false friend and incorrect. Porpora is more of a dark red color. The correct way to say purple is viola. Sometimes you will see the word violetto used as purple. Violetto is actually violet in Italian.\n\nColors have different forms\n\nColors are adjectives, words that describe something. Adjectives in Italian must agree with the gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural) of the noun.\n\nColors that end in -O normally have a feminine form (ending in -A). They also have a singular and plural form which must coincide with the noun (or subject).\n\nFor example, there are 4 forms of the color rosso (red).\n\nCappello rosso – (rosso is masculine and in singular form, just like the word it describes)\n\nCappelli rossi – (rossi is masculine and in plural form)\n\nCasa rossa – (rossa is feminine and in singular form)\n\nCase rosse – (rosse is feminine and in plural form)\n\nNotice how the color comes AFTER the word it describes (Noun + Adjective = Thing + Color)\n\nThe exceptions are rosa, blu and viola which always maintain the same form (we do not say roso or violo).\n\ni guanti viola – the purple gloves\n\nBe careful with the spelling of bianco in its four forms: bianco, bianca, bianchi, bianche\n\nESSERE + color\n\nTo say that something IS a certain color, you use essere (to be) + color:\n\nLa neve è blanca – Snow is white\n\nIl cielo è azzurro – The sky is (light) blue\n\nL’erba è verde – The grass is green\n\nL’elefante è grigio – The elephant is grey/gray\n\nAgain, make sure the color coincides in number and gender with the noun it describes.\n\nChiaro – Scuro\n\nWhen we talk about colors, we can also include different tones or shades by using the following words:\n\nchiaro = light\n\nscuro = dark\n\nChiaro is the opposite of Scuro\n\nverde chiaro = light green\n\nverde scuro = dark green\n\nYou will notice that the words chiaro and scuro go after the color.\n\nHow to say Blue in Italian\n\nFor the normal blue color, the Italian word is blu (that wasn’t hard, was it?).\n\nHowever, the Italian language has a word specifically used for the color light blue … azzurro.\n\nThe Italian national football team is known as Gli Azzurri from the traditional colour of Italian national teams and athletes representing Italy.\n\nColors in Italian Chart\n\nIl mio colore preferito è …\n\nMy favorite color is…"
