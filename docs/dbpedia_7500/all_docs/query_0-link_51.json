This leads to common phrases used on a daily basis.\n\nFor instance, an individual’s need to express his or her willingness to take on a particular duty by saying, “I’ll take care of it,” can be rendered in Italian by a unique sentence structure that puts a subject pronoun after a verb of action. Exclaiming “Ci penso io!” or a stating a phrase using the reflexive verb occuparsi are two other common ways Italian accept an obligation. Even more importantly, family members often share responsibility for other family members. In Italian, this important concept of “taking care of others” is expressed with the phrase presndersi cura. Finally, there are uniquely Italian ways to admonish those you care about to, “Take care of yourself!”\n\nIf we learn the Italian way to say, “I’m taking care of it,” and how to wish others, “Take care of yourself!” we will truly sound like a native Italian!\n\nThis post is the 81st in a series of Italian phrases we have been trying out in our Conversational Italian! Facebook group. If you’d like to read the earlier posts in the series, “Italian Phrases We Use EVERY Day!” just click HERE.\n\nMany “commonly used phrases”\n\nin Italian are used to take responsibility and say,\n\n“I’ll take care of it!”\n\nwith\n\nSubject-Verb Inversion\n\n“Ci penso io”\n\nOccuparsi and Prendersi cura\n\nand to wish others well by saying,\n\n“Take care of yourself!”\n\nSee below for how this works.\n\nAs we all master these phrases, so will you. Try my method and let me know how it works. What sentences will you create with these phrases?\n\nPlease reply. I’d love to hear from you! Or join our Conversational Italian! group discussion on Facebook.\n\nThe basics of the Italian language are introduced in the Conversational Italian for Travelers textbook and reference books Just the Verbs and Just the Grammar *\n\nfound on amazon.com and Learn Travel Italian.com.\n\nThe rights to purchase the Conversational Italian for Travelers books in PDF format on two electronic devices can also be obtained at Learn Travel Italian.com.\n\n*This material adapted from the Conversational Italian for Travelers textbook and reference books Just the Verbs and Just the Grammar\n\n****************************************\n\nSay “I’ll take care of it” in Italian\n\nwith Subject – Verb Inversion\n\nWhen in Italy, a simple way to emphasize that you will take responsibility for an action is to make a short statement and place the subject pronoun after the verb; in effect, invert the usual Italian subject-verb order. Use this convention to say, “I’ll take care of it!” in a way that truly sounds like a native Italian!\n\nRemember that the Italian subject pronouns — such as io, tu, lei/lui, which mean I, you, she/he — are generally left out of an Italian sentence. Many blogs in this series have mentioned that Italian subject pronouns are not needed for conversational Italian since the speaker is understood by the unique Italian verb endings for each subject. Given the Italian convention to omit subject pronouns, then, the simple act of including a subject pronoun shifts the emphasis from the action verb in the sentence to the subject. When the subject pronoun-verb order is inversed by placing the subject pronoun after the verb, the effect is to stress the subject even more.\n\nFor instance, if you are enjoying dinner at home with your family and someone rings the doorbell, one individual in the group will need to take the responsibility to answer the door. That person might get up from the table and say, “Vado io,” which simply means, “I’m going.” But by inverting the verb and subject pronoun order from “Io vado” to “Vado io,” a message has also been sent to the group that no one else need to be concerned about the situation because , “I am (the one who is) going (to take care of it)!” In short, you are demonstrating your intention to take care of the issue at hand and will do so right away.* You might also yell, “Vengo io!” for “I’m coming!” so the person waiting at the door knows you are on your way.\n\nThis subject-verb inversion is useful in other situations as well. In Italy, there is an extra expense for the taxi driver to handle luggage. If you would like to manage your luggage on your own, simply say, “Porto io!” The way the sentence is constructed relays not only, “I will carry my luggage!” but emphasizes your strong desire to do say, as in, “I will take care of it!”\n\n*Note for completeness: Another commonly used verb to signal you are on your way is, “Arrivo!” from arrivare (to arrive). The literal translation is, “I am arriving!” with the meaning of, “I am on my way!” In this case, though, the subject pronoun is usually omitted.\n\nSay “I’ll take care of it” in Italian\n\nwith “Ci penso io”\n\nPensare means “to think” and the well-known meaning of “pensare a” is “to think about (something).” But there is another use for the versatile Italian verb pensare: to describe taking care of someone or something. “Penasare a” is also frequently used to mean, “to see to (something),” as in “to take care of (something).”\n\nFor example, to tell someone you have to take care of your elderly mother using the verb pensare, you might say, “Devo pensare a mia mamma oggi e portarle la spesa.” for “I have to take care of my mother today and bring (to) her the groceries.” Notice the Italian use of the indirect object pronoun “le” with the verb portare and the English use of the direct object pronoun her with the verb “to bring.”\n\nTo say that you have to take care of organizing a meeting at work on Monday, you could say, “Devo pensare alla riunione questo lunedì.” for “I have to take care of the meeting this Monday.” Notice here that the Italian preposition “a” has been combined with the required Italian definite article “la” before “la riunione.” If you need a refresher on how to combine Italian prepositions with definite articles, check out the reference book Conversational Italian for Travelers “Just the Grammar.”\n\nItalians also use subject-verb inversion with the verb pensare, and this sentence structure will change the meaning of pensare from “to think” to “to take care of.” Although “Io penso…” or simply, “Penso…” mean, “I think…” simply invert the subject pronoun and verb order to create the exclamation, “Ci penso io!” which means, “I’ll take care of it!” Notice that the pronoun ci has also been added to the Italian sentence, just as in English we use “it” as a stand-in for a specific action both of the speakers have already discussed.\n\nYou can even ask someone, “Will you take care of it?” by conjugating pensare into the tu form, which is pensi, and using the short phrase, “Ci pensi tu?” Of course, if responsibility for the action is accepted, the answer will be, Si. Ci penso io!” for “Yes, I will take care of it!” These two phrases are commonly used between family members, as well as between peers at work. Use of ci and this sentence structure generally concludes a conversation, since both speakers have been made aware of the situation at hand and responsibility for the next action has been accepted.\n\nSay “I’ll take care of it” in Italian\n\nwith “Mi occupo di”\n\nThe Italian verb occupare has many meanings, including “to occupy (take up space),” “to seize (take over a place),” “to keep interested,” and “to keep busy.”\n\nThe reflexive verb occuparsi can be translated as “to deal with/to handle,” “to oversee,” and “to take care of. “ Use [occuparsi + di] in a work situation to relay that you will be the one to take control of the situation at hand. For instance, if Mr. Rossi, an important client, is visiting the company you work for, your boss may ask you pick him up at the airport and give him a tour of the facility. You could accept responsibility for this client by saying, “D’accordo. Mi occupo del Signor Rossi oggi,” for “Agreed. I will take care of Mr. Rossi today.” A note about this sentence structure: when speaking in Italian about an individual using their last name, the definite article applies, just as it would for any other Italian noun. Notice how Italians combine [di + il Signor Rossi] to make “del Signor Rossi.”\n\nAnother work situation: perhaps a product your company makes is not selling as it should. You may be asked to check how the marketing department is performing and to correct any deficiencies. To affirm you will evaluate how the marketing department functions you could say, “Mi occupo di marketing” for “I will deal with marketing.”\n\nAlong these lines, a polite way to ask what another does for a living is “Di che si occupa?” for “What do you do?” The answer using occuparsi is, “Mi occupo di…” followed by your general field of work or profession.\n\nAlthough occuparsi is most commonly used in the setting of the workplace, this verb can also be used in the family setting, especially if one agrees to take on a challenging situation.\n\nSay “I’ll take care of it” in Italian\n\nwith “Mi prendo cura di” or “Bado a”\n\nItalians often use the phrase “prendersi cura di” when they talk about taking care of family. The reflexive verb prendersi refers to the person who is taking care of another — with the person being taken care of linked to the caregiver by “di.”\n\nFor instance, to say, “I am taking care of my baby Anna,” conjugate prendersi into the io form, which is “io mi prendo” and then add [di + la mia bambina Anna]. As usual, the subject pronoun io is left out of the sentence and di is combined with the definite article la. The final sentence is, ” Mi prendo cura della mia bambina Anna.”\n\nAt first glance, expressing caregiving in Italian with “prendersi cura di” may sound a little strange to an English speaker, since this concept is not reflexive in English. Instead, English speakers use the verb “to be” before the phrase “taking care of.” But if you know the Italian way of thinking, it is simple enough to follow the formula and conjugate the Italian reflexive -ere verb prendersi as to reflect the speaker. Or just remember the phrase “mi prendo cura di…” if you are the one who usually takes care of others!\n\nWhen taking care of something requires an action, “prendersi cura di” is followed by the infinitive verb for that action.\n\nSome examples are below. Remember to combine di with the definite article when needed to create a possessive adjective. (If you need a refresher on how to create possessive adjectives, refer to our blog “How to Express Possession with Italian Possessive Adjectives”). Also, notice that the simple present tense in Italian can be translated several ways in English and also used to refer to the near future.\n\nTi prendi cura di mia figlia oggi?\n\nWill you take care of my daughter today?\n\nWill you be taking care of my daughter today?\n\nSi prende cura dei miei figli oggi.\n\nShe takes/is taking care of my children today.\n\nSi prende cura del giardino ogni mattina.\n\nHe takes care of the garden every morning.\n\nCi prendiamo cura di comprare la torta per la festa in chiesa.\n\nWe are taking care of buying the cake for the party at church.\n\nVi prendete cura di questo ?\n\nAre you all taking care of this?\n\nAnother Italian verb, badare, is often used to describe caregiving for children. Badare means, “to look after,” “tend to,” or “care for.” Badare is always followed by the preposition “a” and“a” will be combined with a definite article if one is needed. The meaning of “badare a” is only slightly different from “prendersi cura di,” possibly expressing a bit more tenderness, but the two verbs are interchangeable. Our original example sentence, “I am taking care of my baby Anna,” could also be translated into Italian as, “Bado alla mia bambina Anna.”\n\nBadare does have other uses to be aware of. Badare can also be used in an exclamation to warn another to “be careful,” with the negative connotations of, “beware” or “look out. For instance, “Bada a quello che tu dici!“ means “Be careful what you say!”\n\nBadare can also mean “to take an interest in” or “to mind” something, rather than a person. “Io bado ai fatti miei,” means, “I mind my own business.”\n\nFinally, if an Italian should hire a babysitter to take care of children, now-a-days, they refer to that person as a “babysitter” whose occupation is “fare la babysitter.” Bambinaia is an old-fashioned Italian word that can also be used to refer to a caregiver outside the family, such as a babysitter or nanny and one can also “fare la bambinaia.”\n\nSay “Take care of yourself!” in Italian\n\nwith “Abbi cura” or “Stammi bene”\n\n“Take care of yourself!” is a phrase many Americans use when ending a telephone conversation or when leaving a get-together with family or friends. Italians use this expression as well, and there are several ways to express good wishes in Italian upon parting with loved ones.\n\nWhen leaving a family member or friend, you could use “prendersi cura” from our first section, and say, “Prenderti cura di te ,” which means, “Take care of yourself.” In a more formal setting, the polite form of the phrase would be, “Prendersi cura di se,” using the third person polite “you.”\n\nThe verb avere (to have) can also be combined with the noun cura (care) to express good wishes to a close friend or family member. Use the familiar command form of avere, which is abbi, to give this advice and show your concern with, “Abbi cura di te!” or even more strongly, “Abbi buon cura di te! for “Take good care of yourself!”\n\nAnother common informal interjection uses the verb stare, which is the verb Italians use to refer to health and well-being. All beginning students of Italian learn early on to use stare to start a conversation by asking, “How are you?” with, “Come sta?” (polite) or “Come stai?” (familiar) and answer in the affirmative with, “Sto bene” for “I am fine.” The use of stare to refer to one’s health was discussed in more detail in the blog, “How to Say, ‘I feel…’ in Italian with Stare.” The interjection “Stammi bene!” is derived from this use of stare. This Italian phrase is translated as “Take care!” A direct translation does not necessarily make sense, but to remember the phrase one might think of it as meaning, “Stay well for me!”\n\nRemember the many ways to say,\n\n“I’ll take care of it!” and “Take care of yourself!” in Italian”\n\nand I guarantee you will use these phrases every day!\n\nFor “All the Italian you need to enjoy your trip to Italy,” click on the links below to purchase my Conversational Italian for Travelers books – and then listen to the audiobook “Just the Important Phrases” on your favorite streaming platform! -Kathryn Occhipinti\n\nConversational Italian for Travelers “Just the Important Phrases” book downloaded to a cell phone from www.learntravelitalian.com\n\nItalian Phrases We Use EVERY Day!® How to say “some” in Italian with “Di”\n\nHave you been trying to speak Italian more easily and confidently in 2024?\n\nI will try to help you with this goal by posting a new blog every month in the series “Italian Phrases We Use EVERY Day!”® With these blogs, I discuss how Italians use their language on a daily basis and in so doing help you to “think in Italian.”\n\nTo speak fluently in another language, it is important to know how to describe a group of things in a general way. In some cases, the number of things in a group can be counted, but we may want to describe only a part of the entire group. In other cases, the number of things in a group cannot be counted — either due to difficulty in dividing the group into individual parts or due to a seemingly infinite number of things within the group. In short, all languages bypass the problem of assessing exactly what is in a group of things by saying, “some.” In technical terms, this is called “the partitive.”\n\nOf course, the way to say “some” in Italian will differ from the simple way English expresses this idea. In fact, there are many options at an Italian’s disposal when he or she want’s to say “some.” The situation, along with the speaker’s preference, will determine the how an Italian expresses the idea of “some.”\n\nLet’s begin our series on the ways Italians say,” some” by focusing on how to combine the Italian preposition di with the definite article to say, “some of the.” This method is commonly used by Italians to talk about quantities of food, and therefore gets daily use! Learning a method to relay a simple concept like “some” may sound complicated at first; but once mastered, this Italian way of thinking is easily incorporated into basic Italian conversation.\n\nIf we learn how to say “some” by combining the Italian preposition di with a definite article, we will truly sound like a native Italian!\n\nThis post is the 80th in a series of Italian phrases we have been trying out in our Conversational Italian!

When describing a part of a whole, or an undetermined number of things, we are using the partitive. This idea is rendered in English with the words “some” or “any,” as in “some of the” or “any of the.”\n\nLet’s begin our series on the ways Italians say,” some” by focusing on how to combine the Italian preposition di with the definite article to say, “some of the.” This method is commonly used by Italians to talk about quantities of food, and therefore gets daily use!\n\nAs an incidental note, the partitive can be thought of as the plural form of the indefinite article “a” — which, as you may recall, in Italian is “un, uno, una, or un’.\n\nHow to Combine\n\n[di + Italian definite article]\n\nto say “Some of it”\n\nThe method Italians use to create the partitive with [di + definite article] is not as foreign to an English speaker as it might seem at first. In English, we can combine the words “some” + “of the” when asking for a portion of food at the dinner table. For instance, at Thanksgiving, when there is a plethora of food to be passed around, we may say, “I’ll have some (of the) turkey, and also some (of the) green beans, please.” The phrase “of the” is in parentheses for the example sentence because in English “of the” is optional. In fact, in English we often omit the word “some” as well when making a statement; the idea that we only want a portion is understood. But this is not the case for Italian!\n\nThe Italian rules of grammar require the speaker to include “some of the” in most situations when making a statement. The preposition “di,” which means “of” in this case, is combined with the required definite article (the) for the noun under discussion. Below is the method for combining di with each Italian definite article and also a reminder about which definite article to choose for the gender and number of an Italian noun.\n\nA few spelling rules…\n\nNotice that di must be changed to “de” before adding the definite article to make, “del” for “of the.” For the definite article il, the letter i in il is dropped when il is combined with a preposition. For definite articles that begin with the letter l, the l is doubled when written, which adds a syllable to the pronunciation and preserves the melodious sound of Italian. You may remember this last two rules are also used to combine the Italian preposition su with Italian definite articles from our blog: “How to Use the Preposition ‘Su’ in Italian.”\n\nA word of advice…\n\nDo not try to memorize the rules behind each definite article,\n\nbut DO memorize each noun with its definite article!\n\nThis way, when you are speaking,\n\nthe definite article will naturally be linked to it’s noun!\n\nThe method for [di + singular definite articles]:\n\ndi + il = del masculine singular definite article\n\ndi + lo = dello masculine singular definite article before [s + consonant], x, y, z\n\ndi+ la = della feminine singular definite article\n\ndi+ l’ = dell’ masculine and feminine singular definite article before a vowel\n\nThe method for [di + plural definite articles]:\n\ndi + i = dei masculine plural definite article\n\ndi + gli = degli masculine plural definite article before a vowel or [s + consonant], x, y, z\n\ndi + le = delle feminine plural definite article\n\nHow to Use the Partitive\n\nwith Vorrei While Dining\n\nThere are, of course, innumerable instances when the partitive can come into play while dining. Most often, this will be to make a request. As discussed in a previous blog, there are many ways to make a request in Italian.\n\nIf one is in polite company, such as with a new acquaintance, or at a formal dinner or a business meeting, the verb vorrei is helpful. Vorrei, which means, “I would like,” is the conditional io form of volere and is the most educated way to ask for what we need. Not only is vorrei polite, but using this form of volere is easy, as noted in a previous blog, “Being Polite with ‘Volere.'”\n\nWhen using vorrei to ask for an item while dining, simply follow vorrei with [di + definite article + noun] to say, ” I would like some of the…” Some examples are given below, with “of the” in parentheses in the English translation. Of course, when gathered with around the dinner table with family, voglio, which means, “I want” can be be substituted for the more formal vorrei. The sentence structure is the same for both vorrei and voglio.\n\nVorrei del pane. I would like some (of the) bread.\n\nVorrei della minestra. I would like some (of the) soup.\n\nVorrei dell’acqua. I would like some (of the) water.\n\nVorrei dei piselli. I would like some (of the) peas.\n\nVorrei delle lasagne. I would like some (of the) lasagna.\n\nVorrei dello spumante. I would like some (of the) sparkling white wine.\n\nVorrei degli spaghetti. I would like some (of the) spaghetti.\n\nA Substitute for\n\nthe Italian Partitive\n\nIf one wants to emphasize a request for a small portion of something, such as with the phrases “a little bit,” or “a little bit of,” the partitive can be replaced by the phrase, “un po’ di,” and the definite article is then omitted. See below:\n\nVorrei un po’ di pane. I would like a little bit of bread.\n\nVorrei un po’ di minestra. I would like a little bit of soup.\n\nWhen to Omit\n\nthe Italian Partitive\n\nThe Italian partitive is always omitted when making a negative statement and often omitted when asking a question. Let’s look at how these rules of Italian grammar apply to different situations.\n\nThe Italian partitive is always omitted when making a negative statement.\n\nOne of the most common phrases spoken in Italian movies is, “Non ho soldi!” instead of “Non ho dei soldi!” The partitive is not omitted in negative English statements. Instead, the English adjective “any” is used. The English translation is therefore, “I don’t have any money!”\n\nNow, let’s go back to our original example of a family at the Thanksgiving table and change it a bit to make a negative statement. For instance, if you don’t want any of Mom’s green bean casserole, you might say, “I’ll have some (of the) turkey, but I don’t want any (of the) green beans.”\n\nAgain, the partitive comes into play with the adjective “any” in English. In Italian, however, the partitive is always omitted in a negative statement. Just use “non” to make the Italian sentence negative, followed by vorrei or voglio, and then the noun without its definite article for what you don’t want! The translation for our example sentence: “Vorrei del tacchino ma non voglio fagiolini.”\n\n2. The Italian partitive is often omitted when asking a question in an informal situation.\n\nWhen asking a question, the Italian partitive is often omitted during an informal conversation with family or friends. In informal conversations, sentences are often shortened, phrases omitted, and in general, extraneous information left unsaid. One of the most common questions a parent asks a child, for instance, is what they want for dinner. In the example below, the Italian partitive degli can be used, but is often left out, to make a shorter, more direct sentence. The answer in the negative that follows also leaves out the partitive, as we have just learned.\n\nMama: Vuoi mangiare (degli) spaghetti stasera?\n\nMom: Do you want to eat spaghetti tonight?\n\nBambino: Non voglio mangiare spaghetti di nuovo stasera!\n\nChild: I don’t want to eat spaghetti again tonight!\n\nHowever, in a formal situation, as when a waiter speaks to diners using the “polite you” at a restaurant, the partitive is always required. This rule holds whether the waiter is making a statement or asking a question. For example, if a waiter wants to ask a customer to try some of the vegetable of the day, he or she would have to use the partitive and say, “Vorrebbe provare degli asparagi per contorno?” meaning, “Would you like to try some asparagus for the side dish?”\n\nListen a bit to those speaking Italian, and these types of phrases will probably come up frequently. Italians are not being lazy if they leave out the partitive; instead, they are using correct Italian grammar!\n\nRemember how to say\n\n“Some” in Italian\n\nand I guarantee you will use\n\nphrases with the partitive every day!\n\nFor “All the Italian you need to enjoy your trip to Italy,” click on the links below to purchase my Conversational Italian for Travelers books – and then listen to the audiobook “Just the Important Phrases” on your favorite streaming platform! -Kathryn Occhipinti\n\nConversational Italian for Travelers “Just the Important Phrases” book downloaded to a cell phone from www.learntravelitalian.com\n\nItalian Phrases We Use EVERY Day!® Let’s Talk About… Making a telephone call in Italian\n\nDo you want to speak Italian more easily and confidently in 2023?\n\nI hope you are on your way to meet this goal! I will try to help you by posting a new blog every month in the series “Italian Phrases We Use EVERY Day!” ® With these blogs, I describe how Italians use their language on a daily basis and in so doing help you to “think in Italian.”\n\nPrior to beginning the lesson for this blog, I acknowledge that in the larger cities in Italy it is not usually necessary for the traveler to know how to speak in Italian to communicate on the telephone; the Italian staff at hotels and restaurants usually speak basic English and often the languages of their European neighbors — French, Spanish or German. Also, most times reservations can now be made over the internet on one’s computer or smart phone, without any human interaction at all! (Have you downloaded WhatsApp onto your phone yet?) But I’ve found that a few phrases in Italian are always warmly welcomed when I am traveling in Italy, even in the larger cities.\n\nFor those of us in the United States or other parts of the world lucky enough to have relatives in Italy to communicate with, knowing the few basic Italian telephone greetings will help to maintain a relationship until a visit is possible. Once in Italy to visit relatives or friends, and especially for business, it is important to know both the familiar and polite Italian phrases routinely used to initiate a telephone conversation. It may also be necessary to decode a voicemail recorded in Italian or to leave a message in Italian with the particulars needed for a return call. In the smaller Italian towns, knowledge of Italian can be essential to make a request or schedule an appointment. (See our previous blog Let’s talk about… making reservations in Italian.)\n\nIn short, if we learn the few phrases needed when making a telephone call in Italian, we will feel more comfortable during our stay in the “bel paese.”\n\nThis post is the 79th in a series of Italian phrases we have been trying out in our Conversational Italian!

Ready. (for hello)\n\nI am Kathy. Pronto.\n\nSono io! Ready. (for hello)\n\nIt’s me! (lit. It is I!)\n\nIn some households in Italy, landlines are still in use. In this case, of course, one needs to be prepared to ask if a friend is at home and, if so, for the friend come to the phone. Also, it is possible to “drop by” unexpectedly or “fare un salto” to someone’s house and ask if a friend is home. Or, perhaps someone unexpected has answered a friend’s cell phone and you will have to ask to speak to the person you had originally called! In any of these situations, some common, informal phrases to use would be:\n\nPosso parlare con Paolo? May I speak with Paul? Paolo è a casa? Is Paul at home? C’è Paolo? Is Paul there?\n\nIf for some reason your friend is not available, you may receive one of the following replies below. The grammar for this simple act is somewhat complicated.\n\nA few points:\n\nFirst, Remember that c’è, from the verb esserci, means “here is.”\n\nAlso, as in the third example below, remember that ti (to him), becomes “te” when followed by a direct object pronoun such as “lo” for “him” and “la” for her.\n\nFinally, the Italian and English sentence structures differ when using indirect and direct object pronouns. In Italian, all pronouns are usually placed before the verb, while in English they are placed after the verb. In this case, to speak like an Italian, we must “think in Italian!” As an aid in understanding these differences, in the examples below, the object pronouns have been underlined and the indirect object pronouns are in red.\n\nSi, aspetta un momento. Yes, wait a moment. Si, aspetta un attimo. Yes, wait a second. (lit. moment) Te lo/la passo. I’ll put him/her through to you. No, non è in casa. No, (he/she) is not at home. No, non c’è. No, (he /she) is not here.\n\nIf you want to try to get some information or leave a message, you might ask:\n\nQuando torna? (lui/lei is usually omitted/understood from the conversation)\n\nWhen (will) he/she return?\n\nSa quando torna? (lui/lei is usually omitted/understood from the conversation)\n\n(Do) you know when he/she (will) return? (pol.)\n\nIf you’d like to make a request, such as for a call back or to leave a message, the following phrases listed below may be of use.\n\nA few notes about the Italian grammar behind these common requests:\n\nNotice that when asking someone to speak to another with the verb dire (to say/to tell), Italian uses indirect object pronouns. In other words, Italians tell information “to him” with gli and “to her” with le. (If you need a refresher about common Italian verbs that take indirect object pronouns, visit the previous blog in this series: “‘He Said/She Said…’ Italian Verbs that Take Indirect Object Pronouns”).\n\nWhen a helping verb (in this case può) is used before dire, the final “e” in dire is dropped and the indirect object pronoun is attached to “dir.” Also in the first sentence below, the Italian direct object pronoun “mi” has been added to the end of chiamare. The details for combining Italian helping verbs with infinitive verbs and object pronouns were discussed in our recent blog, “The Many Uses of the Italian Verb Dovere.”The Italian indirect object pronouns are in red and the direct object pronouns have been underlined in the example phrases below.\n\nThe Italian grammar for these simple requests is complicated. You may want to simply memorize the sentences below, just in case you need to reach one friend or relation through another!\n\nPuò dirgli/dirle di chiamarmi?\n\nCan you tell (to) him/her to call me? (pol.)\n\nPuò dirgli/dirle che ho chiamato?\n\nCan you tell (to) him/her that I called? (pol.)\n\nPuò prendere un messaggio?\n\nCan you take a message? (pol.)\n\nPosso richiamare più tardi?\n\nCan I call back later?\n\nRichiamerei (un po’) più tardi.\n\nI would like to call back (a little) later.\n\nRichiamerò (un po’) più tardi.\n\nI will call back (a little) later.\n\nTo end a telephone conversation with someone you know, if you want sound like a native Italian, try one of the following lines listed below. Of note, Italians often have difficulty ending a conversation — both in person and on the telephone! But, for some reason, the expression “Ciao ciao!” means the conversation is really over or “è chiuso” (is closed), as an Italian would say. In general, after one of the parties says “Ciao ciao!” no further comments will be heard!\n\nCi sentiamo… We will speak to each other…\n\n(lit. hear each other) …a più tardi /dopo / presto. …later / later / soon. Devo scappare! I must run! (lit. escape/run away) Richiamami! Call me back! (fam. command) Chiamami! Call me! (fam. command) Fatti sentire! Let me hear from you!\n\n(lit. Make yourself heard!) Ciao! Bye! Ciao ciao! Bye bye!\n\nItalian Telephone Phrases to Use with Business Associates\n\nA receptionist at a business may answer the phone with “Pronto!” followed by one of the following questions:\n\nPronto.\n\nChe cosa posso fare per Lei?\n\nHello.\n\nWhat can I do for you? (pol.)\n\nPosso aiutarla? May I help you? (pol.) Chi parla? Who is speaking? (pol.) Chi chiama? Who is calling? (pol.)\n\nReplies to the receptionist at a business office might include the lines below. Notice that the polite “io” conditional form of volere, which is “vorrei” is used to make the initial request after the perfunctory “Pronto.” The polite “you” present tense of potere, which is “può,” is also important to know in this situation. Do you remember how useful both vorrei and può are for travelers from our previous blogs? To learn about a method to ask for what you need in Italy using vorrei and può, visit the blogs “Italian Travelers — Use ‘Vorrei’ to Say, ‘I would like…'” and “Italian Travelers — Use ‘Può’ to ask for what you need!”\n\nAlso notice the Italian use of a definite article (il, la) before Mr., Mrs., or Miss during introductions from the first two examples below.\n\nPronto. Sono il signor / la signora / la signorina Rossi.\n\nHello. I am Mr. / Mrs. / Miss Rossi.\n\nVorrei parlare con il signor Manzini.\n\nI would like to speak with Mr. Manzini.\n\nMi può passare il direttore, per piacere?\n\nCan you put me through to (give me) the director, please? (pol.)\n\nMe lo può passare?\n\nCan you put him through to me? (pol.)\n\nMe la può passare?\n\nCan you put him through to me? (pol.)\n\nIf speaking to a colleague, or someone you know well at a business, the polite conditional vorrei for “I would like” is still considered an educated way to make the first request. However, the familiar “you” of potere, which is puoi, is permitted as the conversation continues.\n\nMi puoi passare il direttore, per piacere?\n\nCan you put me through to (give me) the director, please? (familiar)\n\nMe lo puoi passare?\n\nCan you put him through to me? (familiar)\n\nMe la puoi passare?\n\nCan you put him through to me? (familiar)\n\nAfter requesting to speak to a business associate, you may hear the following replies below. Notice the use of indirect object pronouns again in the last example (given in red). In this case, when combining gli with either lo or la, one must follow the Italian grammar rule to insert an “e” between the indirect and direct object pronouns. This will also give a subtle change to the pronunciation of “gli,” which is now pronounced, “glie” as part of the newly created words, “glielo” or “gliela.”\n\nAgain, the Italian grammar for these simple lines is complicated. You may want to simply memorize the sentences below, as they are likely to come up frequently if you decide to stay in Italy for a bit!\n\nResti in linea, per favore.\n\nHold (the line), please. (pol. command)\n\nMi dispiace, ma…\n\nI’m sorry, but…\n\n…il direttore è occupato.\n\n…the director is busy.\n\n…il direttore non c’è oggi.\n\n…the director is not in today.\n\n…il direttore è (appena) uscito(a).\n\n…the director has (just) stepped out. (masc./fem.)\n\n…il direttore è in riunione.\n\n…the director is (attending) in a meeting.\n\nGlielo passo. / Gliela passo.\n\nI’ll put him/her through to you. (pol.)\n\nVoicemail Messages\n\nWhen communicating with both friends and business associates, it may also be necessary to decode a voicemail recorded in Italian or to leave a message in Italian with the particulars needed for a return call.\n\nItalian phrases you may hear on voice mail:\n\nLa segreteria telefonica di…\n\nThe voice mailbox/answering machine of…\n\nNon posso/possiamo rispondere al telefono ora.\n\nI/We cannot answer the phone now.\n\nLasciate il vostro messaggio, e il vostro nome, la data, e l’ora della vostra chiamata…\n\nLeave your message, and your name, the date, and the time of your call…\n\n…e il vostro numero di telefono\n\n…and your telephone number\n\n…dopo il segnale acustico.\n\n…after the beep.\n\nVi richiamerò/Vi richiameremo presto.\n\nI/We will call you all back soon.\n\nHow to leave a voicemail message in Italian.\n\nFirst, identify yourself and leave a short message about why you are calling. Remember to use the Italian definite article before your last name if leaving a formal message!\n\nSono la signora Manzini.\n\nI am Mrs. Manzini.\n\nSono Caterina.\n\nI am Kathy.\n\nVorrei parlare di…\n\nI want to talk about…\n\nPossiamo parlare di…\n\nCan we talk about…\n\nThen, state the date and time of your call.\n\nOggi è lunedì tre agosto, alle 10 di mattina. (American way of thinking)\n\nToday is Monday, August third, at 10 AM.\n\n-or-\n\nOggi sono le 10 di mattina di lunedì tre agosto. (What an Italian would say.)\n\nToday it is 10 AM on Monday, August 3.\n\nFinally, leave your telephone number or email.\n\nIl mio numero di telefono è…\n\nMy telephone number is…\n\nLa mia mail è…\n\norders chiocciola Stella Lucente punto com.\n\nMy email is… orders@stellalucente.com.\n\nRemember familiar and polite\n\nItalian Phrases for Telephone Conversations\n\nand I guarantee you will use these phrases every day!\n\nFor “All the Italian you need to enjoy your trip to Italy,” click on the links below to purchase my Conversational Italian for Travelers books – and then listen to the audiobook “Just the Important Phrases” on your favorite streaming platform! -Kathryn Occhipinti\n\nItalian Phrases We Use EVERY Day!® The many uses of the Italian verb “Dovere”\n\nDo you want to speak Italian more easily and confidently in 2024?\n\nHave you set a goal to learn Italian? I will try to help you by posting a new blog every month in the series “Italian Phrases We Use EVERY Day!”® With these blogs, I discuss how Italians use their language on a daily basis and in so doing help you to “think in Italian.”\n\nFor instance, many Italian verbs have a similar use to those in English, which simplifies translation from one language to the other. However, often the meaning of an Italian verb will vary from the usual English connotation. And in many situations, the same verb can have several different meanings in both languages, depending on the context. Dovere is an essential Italian verb that you “have to” learn to use in all its shades of meaning if you want to speak like a native Italian!\n\nDovere, which means “to have to,” or “to must” is one of the three helping verbs in Italian, along with volere (to want) and potere (to be able to/can). We have discussed how important it is to use the verb vorrei (from volere) to be polite as visitor in Italy with the blog, “Italian Travelers – Use ‘Vorrei’ to say, I would like.” We’ve also discussed potere, an essential verb of politeness when used in its third person, present tense conjugation può, in the blog, “Italian Travelers – Use ‘Può’ to ask for what you need!” Also important for the student new to Italian: if you learn how to preface a request politely with può, you can avoid the need to conjugate the main verb of the sentence, since helping verbs are always followed by an infinitive verb!\n\nThe third Italian helping verb, dovere, which is the subject of this blog, also fulfills an essential role in everyday Italian life, whether one is a traveler or is speaking to an acquaintance, friend, or family. Dovere is used as a helping verb to emphasize the obligation or the need to complete an action with its meanings of “to have to,” or “to must.” Think of how many times a day we say we “have to” or “must” do something — leave for work or school, run an errand, meet a friend we haven’t seen in awhile — the permutations are endless!\n\nTake the feeling of obligation that one feels when they “must” do something a step further, and the meaning of dovere used as a stand-alone verb changes to “to owe,” or “to be indebted to.” Finally, continuing along these lines, “dovere” is also used as a noun to refer to one’s “duty” or “obligation.”\n\nAs I’ve said before, I believe that “commonly used phrases” are the key for how we can all build fluency in any language in a short time.\n\nIf we learn how to incorporate “commonly used phrases” when use the Italian verb dovere, we will be able to communicate just as we do in our native language!\n\nThis post is the 77th in a series of Italian phrases we have been trying out in our Conversational Italian!

Dovere is used as a helping verb to emphasize the obligation or the need to complete an action with its meanings of “to have to,” or “to must.” Think of how many times a day we say we “have to” or “must” do something — leave for work or school, run an errand, meet a friend we haven’t seen in a while — the permutations are endless!\n\nAlso, it is important to note that in English we often say, ” I need to,” rather than the more formal, “I must,” or even the conversational “I have to,” when in truth, this need is actually an obligation. We might say, “I need to leave for work,” as a stand-alone statement, or with a qualifier, such as “right now,” “soon,” or “at 8 AM.” This type of English statement communicates that one will be leaving due to an obligation. Italians are more specific, though. When their action is a result of an obligation, something they truly need to do because they must do it, Italians use the verb dovere.*\n\nTake the feeling of obligation one step further, and the meaning of dovere used as a stand-alone verb changes to “to owe,” or “to be indebted to.” Finally, continuing along these lines, dovere is also used as a noun to refer to one’s “duty” or “obligation.”\n\nSince the number of ways dovere can be used in conversation is endless, the focus of this blog is on how to use dovere while traveling and in every day interactions.\n\n* If you need a refresher on when Italians would say, “I need” in Italian, visit our blog in this series, “How to say, ‘I need…’ in Italian with ‘Ho bisogno di,’ ‘Mi serve,’ and ‘Averne voglia.'”\n\nHow to Conjugate Dovere\n\nDovere is an irregular -ere verb in the present tense due to its irregular stems — with two irregular stems each for the io and the loro conjugations. The more commonly used stem is listed first in the table below. Only the voi form has a regular stem and ending and is printed in green.\n\nIn general, a speaker tends to focus on what he or she “must” or “needs to” do, so the io (I) conjugation will be used the most often. When speaking to a group, the third person plural, noi (we) form dovere is also important to remember. Dovere is such an essential verb, though, it is recommended that all conjugations be memorized!\n\nio devo, debbo tu devi Lei/lei/lui deve noi dobbiamo voi dovete loro devono, debbono\n\nKnowing how to conjugate dovere is only the first step if you want to express what you “have to” or “must” do in Italian. After “I have to,” another verb is needed to express what needs to be done — to go somewhere, to buy something, etc. Here is how to link dovere to another verb:\n\nFirst conjugate the verb dovere to reflect the speaker. Then simply add the infinitive form of the main verb in the sentence after the conjugated form of dovere. This is the same as we would do in English! The verb dovere is known as a modal, or helping verb for the way that it modifies, or adds to, the meaning of the main verb in the sentence.\n\nTwo examples below demonstrate how this works. Notice that the subject pronoun io is not included in the Italian example sentences below that use dovere, since subject pronouns are almost always left out of Italian sentences. For this reason, “I” is given in parenthesis in the English translation.\n\n(Io) Devo andare in Italia per lavoro la prossima settimana.\n\n(I) have to go to Italy for work next week.\n\n(Io) Devo tornare lunedì.\n\n(I) have to return Monday.\n\nDovere with reflexive verbs:\n\nIf dovere* is used to modify a reflexive verb, one of the reflexive pronouns (mi, ti, si, ci, vi, si) will be attached to the infinitive form of the reflexive verb or can be placed at the beginning of the phrase, before dovere. The Italian subject pronoun. as usual, has been omitted in the Italian sentences that demonstrate this below, so it is given in parentheses.\n\n(Io) Devo svegliarmi alle sei domani.\n\nI need to (must) get (myself) up at 6 AM tomorrow.\n\n(Io) Mi devo svegliare alle sei domani.\n\nI need to (must) get (myself) up at 6 AM tomorrow.\n\nNotice that the English translation for the examples with [dovere + svegliarsi] is “I need to,” since “I need to” is commonly used by English speakers to describe when they have set an alarm to get up in the morning. This case demonstrates a situation in which Italians use dovere to express a need; there is the understanding is that the speaker must have an underlying obligation that requires a timely awakening.\n\nPast tense:\n\nPassato Prossimo: The past participle is regular, and is dovuto.\n\nWhen dovere used alone, such as to say, “I owed…/ I have owed…” the helping verb is avere. (However, the imperfetto is more commonly used to describe an indefinite amount of time in the past that one has owed something to another.)\n\nWhen dovere is used as a helping verb, for instance to say, “I had to…” things get a bit complicated. Either avere or essere can be used; the choice of avere or essere will depend on the main verb.**\n\n1.) If the main verb takes avere in the passato prossimo, the sequence with dovere acting as a helping verb is: [conjugated avere + dovuto + infinitive main verb].\n\n2.) If the main verb takes essere in the passato prossimo, the sequence with dovere acting as a helping verb is: [conjugated essere + dovuto(a, i, e) + infinitive action verb]. Notice that the ending of the past participle dovuto will change to reflect if the speaker is masculine (o,i) or feminine (a,e).**\n\n3.) If the main verb is essere (to be), such as, “I had to be…” the sequence with dovere acting as a helping verb is: [conjugated avere + dovuto + essere].\n\nImperfetto: Dovere has a regular conjugation in the imperfetto past tense (dovevo, dovevi, doveva, dovevamo, dovevate, dovevano).\n\n*This rule holds true for all modal verbs.\n\n**These rules hold true for all modal verbs.\n\n1. Use dovere with the meaning “to have to” or “must,” to describe an obligation and create complex sentences in Italian.\n\nAs noted in the introduction, verb dovere is used to express a necessity, obligation or duty.\n\nIn grammatical terms, dovere, along with the verbs potere and volere, are referred to as modal verbs. The alternate, name for these verbs, as mentioned above for dovere, is “helping verb,” since modal verbs “modify” the main verb in the sentence and in so doing aid in understanding the situation under discussion. A by product of using a compound verb created with a modal verb is a sentence that has a more complex meaning than a simple sentence.\n\nIn the present tense, a modal verb is conjugated to reflect the speaker and the main verb follows directly after in its infinitive form. This format was discussed with dovere in the last section. (For a discussion of the other helping verbs potere and volere, see “Italian Travelers – Use ‘Può’ to ask for what you need!” and “Italian Travelers – Use ‘Vorrei’ to say, I would like.”)\n\nRemember to leave out the Italian subject pronoun when creating a sentence with dovere and the other modal verbs, as is usual for Italian conversation. The conjugation of the modal verb will signal who is doing the talking!\n\nFollow the progression of sentences in the examples below and notice how the modal verbs dovere, potere, and volere allow the individual to express complex ideas by adding bits of information about the action verb in the sentence. In the first sentence, which is a simple sentence, we learn only that someone goes to Rome every day. In the sentence that follows, with the addition of dovere, we learn about the person’s obligation to go to Rome. This brings up the question of “why” this individual “must go” to Rome every day, which is answered with the addition of a short phrase in the same sentence. We also learn how it is possible that this person “can” go to Rome on a daily basis with the addition of potere. Finally, with the helping verb volere, we discover that the individual actually “wants” to go to Rome frequently. Read on and see how to make more complex and descriptive sentences using dovere and other Italian modal verbs!\n\n(Io) Vado a Roma ogni giorno.\n\nI go to Rome every day.\n\n(Io) Devo andare a Roma ogni giorno per lavoro.\n\nI have to (must) go to Rome every day for work.\n\n(Io) Posso andare a Roma ogni giorno; è facile con il treno diretto.\n\nI can go to Rome every day; it is easy with the direct train.\n\n(Io) Voglio andare a Roma ogni giorno; mi piace molto la città!\n\nI want to go to Rome every day; I really like the city!\n\nThe conjugated forms of dovere can also stand alone as a complete sentence to express obligation as, “I must,” “You must,” “He/She must,” and so on. This occurs mostly in conversation, in response to a subject already under discussion. See the last question/answer example below.\n\n(Tu) Devi andare a Roma ogni giorno per lavoro?\n\nDo you have to go to Rome every day for work?\n\nSi, devo.\n\nYes, I have to. / Yes, I must.\n\n2. Use dovere with the meaning “to have to” or “to must,” to ask about a necessity during transactions or when asking for directions.\n\nDovere is often used when performing complex transactions that require an exchange of information, such as when making a purchase that comes with requirements or restrictions. In this case, one may ask about the details that are “necessary” to know about the purchase using dovere. For instance, when purchasing train tickets, there are generally several options to consider. See the first set of example phrases below, which uses both volere and dovere.\n\nThe traveler asking for directions might hear dovere in the response for they “need to do” to reach their destination. See the second set of examples below.\n\nOther situations in which someone might ask what they “have to do” might involve making an expensive purchase, such as buying a house or a car, or filling out an application, such as for college, a club, or a job. The number of situations in which to use dovere to express necessity is endless!\n\nDesidera?\n\nDesidero un biglietto per Milano. What do you want/need/wish? (polite)\n\nI want a ticket for Milan. Vorrei un biglietto per Milano. I would like a ticket for Milan. Vorrei un biglietto di andata e ritorno. I would like a round trip ticket.\n\n(lit. a ticket of going and returning) Vorrei il diretto. I would like a direct train (non-stop train). Voglio prendere il treno diretto. I want to take the direct train (non-stop train). Voglio prendere il treno diretto per Milano. I want to take the direct train for Milan. Devo pagare il supplemento? Must (I) pay an extra fee (for fast trains)? Vorrei il locale. I would like the local (many stops on the route). Cambio/Cambi treno a… I/You change train(s) at… Non vorrei cambiare treno. I don’t want to change train(s). Devo cambiare treno? Must I change trains? Quanto ci vuole per la coincidenza? How much time is needed for the connection?\n\nHo/Abbiamo bisogno di indicazioni. I/We need directions. Ho/Abbiamo bisogno di un’informazione.\n\nHo/Abbiamo bisogno di informazioni.\n\nHo/Abbiamo bisogno di alcune informazioni. I/We need information. (one fact)\n\nI/We need information. (more than one fact)\n\nI/We need some information. Sa come arrivare a…? (Do) you (pol.) know how to get to…? Vado bene per…? Am I going the right way for…? No, sta andando nella direzione sbagliata. No, you are going in the wrong direction. È lontano da qui? Is it far from here? È vicino da qui? Is it close to here? Quanto dista? How far is (it)? Quanto dista da…?\n\nQuant’è lontano da…? How far is (it) from…? A quanti chilometri è da…? How many kilometers is it from…? Quanto tempo a piedi? How long (walking) on foot? Deve camminare per un’isolato. You must walk for one block. Deve seguire per… You must follow for… Deve proseguire per… You must continue for…\n\n3. Use dovere in common expressions that describe the necessity of what you “have to” or “had to” do during a typical day.\n\nThe following phrases that use dovere and fare will come in handy when talking about the necessity of the actions you perform during a typical day; that is, what you “have to” or “had to” do. Since fare means “to do,” to create a sentence in the present tense, just place the conjugated form of dovere before the infinitive verb fare.\n\nIn the past tense, to talk about what you did have to do recently, the formula that incorporates dovere and fare is [conjugated avere + dovuto + infinitive main verb], as given earlier in this blog in the section “Conjugation of Dovere.” You may recall that in the passato prossimo, the verb fare always takes avere, which makes the choice of avere in this situation easy! (If you need a refresher on how to create the passato prossimo, visit the blog in this series “Past Tense Passato Prossimo, ‘Avere’ or ‘Essere'”?)\n\nWhen you have to leave someone’s company, use the last two popular phrases in our example list that mean, “I’ve got to go!” or in colloquial English, “Gotta go!” or “Gotta run!” To really sound like an Italian, when leaving the company of a close friend, add a phrase of assurance that you’d like to meet again soon with, “A dopo!” for “See you later!” or “A presto!” for “See you soon!”\n\nDevo alzarmi presto lunedì. I need to/have to get up early Monday. Devo fare molte cose lunedì.\n\nHo dovuto fare molte cose oggi. I have many things to do Monday.\n\nI had many things to do today. Devo fare… I have to do… Ho dovuto fare… I had to do… …molti servizi …a lot of errands. …dei servizi …some errands. …molti giri per… …a lot of running around for… Devo correre. I have to run. Devo scappare. I have to rush off. (lit. escape or run away) A dopo! See you later! A presto! See you soon!\n\n4. Use dovere in the past tense with essere to describe where you “had to” go.\n\nIn #3 of this section, we just saw how example sentences in the past tense combine dovere with fare to describe what someone “had to do” in the passato prossimo. Now let’s review the passato prossimo with a verb of action — andare (to go).\n\nIn the past tense, to talk about where you have gone, or went recently, the formula that incorporates dovere and andare is [conjugated essere + dovuto (i,a,e) + infinitive action verb], as given in the earlier section of this blog “Conjugation of Dovere.” You may recall that in the passato prossimo the verb andare always takes essere, which makes the choice of essere in this situation easy!\n\nWith the action verb andare, the other two modal verbs, potere and volere will also take essere in the passato prossimo, and follow the same sentence structure described for dovere. The past participles for potere and volere are potuto and voluto.\n\nOur initial example sentences in #1 of this section that were created with all three modal verbs have been converted into the past tense using the action verb andare in the examples below. We are assuming the speaker is masculine, with a reminder that feminine speakers using this sentence structure with essere must change the ending of the past participle from an (o) to an (a).\n\n(Io) Vado a Roma ogni giorno.\n\nI go to Rome every day.\n\n(Io) Sono dovuto(a) andare a Roma ogni giorno per lavoro.\n\nI had to (must) go to Rome every day for work.\n\n(Io) Sono potuto(a) andare a Roma ogni giorno; era facile con il treno diretto.\n\nI was able to go to Rome every day; it was easy with the direct train.\n\n(Io) Sono voluto(a) andare a Roma ogni giorno; mi piace molto la città!\n\nI wanted to go to Rome every day; I really like the city!\n\nAs mentioned previously, the conjugated forms of dovere can also stand alone as a complete sentence to express obligation as, “I must,” “You must,” “He/She must,” or in the past tense, “I/You/He/She had to.\n\nThis occurs mostly in conversation, in response to a subject already under discussion. See the last question/answer example below for how to do this in the past tense.\n\n(Tu) Sei dovuto(a) andare a Roma ogni giorno per lavoro?\n\nDid you have to go to Rome every day for work?\n\nSi, ho dovuto(a).\n\nYes, I had to.\n\n5. Use dovere as an independent verb to describe what you owe “to someone.”\n\nDovere can stand alone as a verb that means “to owe,” in reference to an amount of money or figuratively, in payback for a favor, etc. Simply conjugate doverein the present tense to create a short sentence about something owed to someone.\n\nThe only trick is that Italian requires one to mention to whom the money is owed — to Mary, to Mark, to him or to her. Therefore, an indirect object pronoun must be used before dovere if you want to replace [to + person’s name]. In English, we simply state the person’s name we are referring to directly, as in, “I owe Mary twenty dollars.” Therefore, in English, a direct object pronoun is used to substitute for a person. This English pronoun is placed after the verb.\n\nAs discussed in a previous blog, since the Italian direct and indirect object pronouns mi and ti are identical, it may not be apparent which pronoun one is using with these two forms. It does become apparent in the third person singular. The polite you and the third person direct object pronouns are la (you, polite; her) and lo (him) but the indefinite object pronouns are le (to you, polite; her) and gli (to him). For instance, if one has bought a friend coffee in Italy, the friend will probably ask, “How much do I owe you?” or simply state, “I owe to you… euro.” To make these simple sentences in Italian, use dovere and the indirect object pronouns!\n\nOf note, when forming a question to ask, “how much,” the adverb quanto comes into play. Since we are using quanto as an adverb to modify dovere, quanto will be invariable. This is similar to the question, “Quanto costa (one article)?” When referring to money, the noun soldi is understood and (by convention) generally left out of the phrase. This leaves only the indirect object pronoun between quanto and dovere and the question to ask is, “Quanto ti/le devo?” “How much do I owe (to you, familiar/polite)?\n\nFinally, when replying with the amount of money owed, the European currency used in Italy today is the euro. The Italian noun euro is not capitalized when written and has an invariable ending.\n\nSee examples below with different speakers talking about who owes what to whom in different situations.\n\nSituation 1:\n\nPietro and Maria are friends. Pietro buys Maria a coffee. Since they know each other well, they speak using the familiar “tu” form for “you.”\n\nMaria asks Pietro:\n\n“Quanto ti devo?” for “How much (money) do I owe (to) you?”\n\nPietro can reply simply, with the amount in euros, or with the complete sentence:\n\n“Mi devi cinque euro.” “You owe (to) me 5 Euros.”\n\nSituation 2:\n\nPietro and Maria have just met at a gathering in a coffee bar. Pietro asks if Maria would like a coffee, goes to get it for her, and then returns to the bar where she is standing. Since they are only acquaintances, they speak to each other using the polite “lei” form for “you.”\n\nMaria asks Pietro:\n\n“Quanti le devo?” for “How much do I owe (to) you (polite)?\n\nPietro answers politely:\n\n“Mi deve cinque euro.” “You owe (to) me 5 euors.”\n\nSituation 3:\n\nPietro and Maria have just met at a gathering in a coffee bar. Two friends, Caterina and Anna have been watching their interactions, and now decide to talk about the couple.\n\nCaterina mentions to Anna:\n\n“Quanti gli deve per il caffè?”\n\n“How much (does) she owe (to) him for the coffee?\n\nAnna answers Caterina:\n\n“Secondo me, gli deve cinque euro.”\n\n“According to me, she owes (to) him 5 euros.”\n\nBut Caterina remembers:\n\n“Ma, prima, Maria ha comprato un dolcetto per lui per 7 euro. E quindi, Pietro le deve 2 euro!”\n\n“But before, Maria bought a pastry for him for 7 euros. And therefore, Peter owes (to) her 2 euros!”\n\nDovere can also stand alone as a verb that means “to owe,” as in “to be indebted to” figuratively. The use of the indirect object pronoun and the sentence structure is the same as noted in the previous examples.\n\nTo say one is “in debt” in Italian, you can also use the phrase “in debito.” To be in someone’s debt, nel tuo/suo debito.\n\nDevo la mia educazione ai miei genitori, che hanno pagato per tutto.\n\nI owe my education to my parents, who have paid for everything.\n\nDa ora in poi, sarò sempre nel tuo debito.\n\nFrom now on, I will forever be in your debt.\n\n6. Use dovere as a masculine noun to describe the feeling of duty\n\nDovere is often used as a masculine noun to refer to one’s duty. This can be a general feeling of obligation or refer specifically to a job, obligation, or a task that needs to be done. The definite article il before dovere signals that dovere is being used as a noun, rather than a verb.\n\nTo emphasize the feeling of a duty as an obligation, use the phrase “sentirsi in dovere di…” as in, “Mi sento in dovere di prendermi cura mio fratello.” I feel obligated to take care of my brother.”\n\nWhen writing a letter to an unknown recipient, such as in a large corporation, you may begin with “a chi di dovere” for “to the responsible party.”\n\nil senso del dovere\n\nsentirsi in dovere di… the sense of duty\n\nto feel obligated to… la dedizione al dovere the dedication to duty È il mio dovere.\n\nFaccio il mio dovere.\n\nIt is my duty.\n\nI do my duty.\n\nchi di dovere the responsible party\n\nRemember how to use the Italian verb\n\ndovere\n\nand I guarantee you will use this verb every day!\n\nFor “All the Italian you need to enjoy your trip to Italy,” click on the links below to purchase my Conversational Italian for Travelers books — and then listen to the audiobook “Just the Important Phrases” on your favorite streaming platform! -Kathryn Occhipinti\n\nItalian Phrases We Use EVERY Day!® Let’s talk about… Emotions in Italian (Part 2) —Boredom and Annoyance\n\nDo you want to speak Italian more easily and confidently in 2024?\n\nI will try to help you by posting a new blog every month in the series “Italian Phrases We Use EVERY Day!” ® With these blogs, I describe how Italians use their language on a daily basis and in so doing help you to “think in Italian.”\n\nCertain situations come up often among family members and friends, especially those living together in the same household. This leads to common phrases that are often used on a daily basis. In recent blogs, “Talking with family and friends with familiar Italian commands,“ and “Italian Phrases to Use with the Family,” we discussed common commands, statements and questions Italians use during interactions with those they are close to. Continuing in this vein with our series on emotions, we delve into additional Italian expressions that are used on a personal level.\n\nFor instance, an upcoming event may make one happy and generate positive feelings of excitement and anticipation. Check out our first blog about expressing emotions in Italian from last Christmas season, Let’s talk about… Emotions in Italian (Part 1) — Happiness and Anticipation. On the other hand, one may become bored with every day routines or even find themselves annoyed at certain individuals or at situations that can crop up in modern life. It is a part of being human to feel negative emotions, and we commonly talk with family and friends about our feelings of boredom and annoyance.\n\nExpressing one’s emotions is complex, both in one’s native language and certainly in an adopted language. In Italian, many phrases used to convey emotion are idiomatic, and the choice of verbs can differ with even minor differences in a situation.\n\nIn short, we must learn to think in Italian if we are to communicate our emotions of boredom and annoyance in Italian! Then, we will be able to express our feelings like a native!\n\nThis post is the 76th in a series of Italian phrases we have been trying out in our Conversational Italian! Facebook group.

Remember to put the direct object pronoun lo or la (for him/her) before the verb, as usual with Italian sentence construction.\n\nQuesto film lo/la annoia. (from annoiare)\n\nThis film bores him/her.\n\nBut more commonly, Italians use dare — the verb that means to give — with the noun noia, for [dare + noia]. The effect is that “it” or “someone” is “giving boredom to” another!\n\nIn effect, although in English something or someone can “make” another bored,\n\nin Italian things and other people “give” boredom with dare.\n\nThis brings up another grammatical point. Since boredom is being given to someone, indefinite object pronouns must be used to describe that someone. For the singular forms, you will recall the indirect object pronouns are “to me,” “to you,” “to him,” “to her,” in English, and mi, ti, gli, and le in Italian.\n\nIf you have been put into a boring situation\n\nand want to describe your feeling of boredom,\n\nonce again, be careful!\n\nIf you are bored, i.e. have become bored and are feeling bored at a certain point, use the past participle annoiato(a). In this case, the verb that means bored is used as an adjective following essere.\n\nDo not follow essere with the adjective noioso(a) when referring to yourself, unless you want to say that you are boring!\n\nTo “get bored” use the reflexive form of annoiare, which is annoiarsi. (Again, remember that Italians express “to get” with reflexive verbs and see “How to Say, ‘Get…’ in Italian” for a refresher if you need to.)\n\nExamples below show how annoiarsi, annoiare, [dare + noia], annoiato, and annoioso(a) are used to describe the different states of boredom. The Italian subject pronouns have been put in parentheses, as they are usually left out of the sentence in conversational Italian (as mentioned before in many previous blogs).\n\nFor our example conversation, let’s say we want to talk about the fact that someone is bored by a certain film.\n\nThe simple statement given as our first example above is repeated here. But as mentioned previously, this is not usually the sentence structure people to communicate the feeling of boredom in Italian, so in the following examples, we continue on with other, more common ways to express boredom:\n\nWhen I become bored…\n\nQuesto film mi annoia. (from annoiare)\n\nThis film bores me.\n\n(Io) Mi annoio. (from annoiarsi)\n\nI am getting bored.\n\nQuesto film mi da noia. / Mi da noia questo film. (from [dare + noia])\n\nThis film is making me bored. / (literally: This film is giving me boredom.)\n\n(Io) Sono annoiato(a). (Use the past participle of annoiare here!)\n\nI am bored.\n\nIf he or she becomes bored…\n\nQuesto film lo/la annoia. (from annoiare)\n\nThis film bores him/her.\n\nLui si annoia. / Lei si annoia. (from annoiarsi)\n\nHe is getting bored. / She is getting bored.\n\nQuesto film gli/le da noia. / Gli/Le da noia questo film. (from [dare + noia])\n\nThis film is making him/her bored. (lit. This film is giving him or her boredom.)\n\nOra, lui è annoiato. / Ora, lei è annoiata.\n\nNow, he is bored. / Now, she is bored. (Use the past participle of annoiare here!)\n\nAnd in this case, someone is bored about something (a certain film)…\n\nIl film è noioso. (Use the adjective here!)\n\nThe film is boring.\n\nBut in another situation, a person, rather than a thing may be boring… Use the adjective noioso(a) in this case to describe the person!\n\nNon sopporto Maria. Lei è cosi noiosa quando parla continuamente di suo marito!\n\nI can’t stand Maria. She is so boring when she constantly talks about her husband!\n\nSome ways to express just how exasperated you are by something or someone who is boring:\n\nChe noia! / Uffa! (expression and sound of exasperation)\n\nHow boring!\n\nChe palle!\n\nHow boring! (idiomatic expression)\n\nChe barba!\n\nHow boring! (idiomatic expression)\n\nExpressing Annoyance in Italian — Infastidire and Seccare\n\nOf course, much as we love them, family members and friends can sometimes annoy us. The Italian verb infastidire means to annoy or to bother someone and is often used in reference to a child with the meaning “to pester.” The past participle, which can be used as an adjective, is infastidito(a).\n\nThe adjective that means “annoying, bothersome” or “pesky” is fastidioso(a).\n\nAdditional meanings for fastidioso(a) are “fussy, finicky,” and “fastidious.”\n\nThe noun that means the annoyance is il fastidio. Fastidio is used with dare to create the phrase [dare + fastidio] to describe someone “giving annoyance” or “pestering” someone else. This is the same sentence construction used in the last section with noia!\n\nAs with annoiare, infastidire has a reflexive form, infastidirsi, which means “to get annoyed.”\n\nThe present tense conjugation for infastidire, which is a regular -ire verb that uses the “isc” in the ending, is given below. Examples follow.\n\nInfastidire Presente io infastidisco tu infastidisci lui, lei, Lei, egli infastidisce noi infastidiamo voi infastidite loro, Loro, essi infastidiscono\n\nMi infastidisco. (from infastidirsi)\n\nI am getting annoyed.\n\nMichele mi da fastidio! (from [dare + infastidire])\n\nMichael is pestering me! (lit. he is giving annoyance to me.)\n\nSono infastidito(a). (Use the past participle of infastidire here!)\n\nI am annoyed.\n\nand in this case…\n\nMichele è fastidioso. (Use the adjective to describe a person who is the pest!)\n\nMichael is pesky.\n\nFinally, seccare is another Italian verb that means to annoy, bother, or disturb someone, to the point of exasperation. Seccare does double duty as the verb that also means “to dry out.” It’s reflexive form, seccarsi, means both “to become annoyed” and “to dry out.” Seccare is a regular -are verb.\n\nThe adjective is seccante and the noun is la seccatura.\n\nBoth seccatura and fastidio/ fastidioso are used to refer to an annoyance or nuisanceand are used to say, “How annoying…”\n\nChe seccatura, la mia macchina non funziona!\n\nHow annoying (What an annoyance/What a bother), my car won’t start!\n\nQuanto/Come sei fastidioso! Tu non mi ascolti mai!\n\nHow annoying you are!

This blog will focus on the Italian verb potere, which means “to can” or “to be able to.” I like to call this verb the “Italian verb of politeness” since it is used to make polite requests, and therefore it is especially useful to know when traveling in Italy.\n\nFor instance, different present tense forms of potere can be used to ask a question politely. Potere can be used alone in the first conjugation in the singular and plural to ask the questions, “Posso?” or “Possiamo?” which mean, “May I?” or “May we?” Combine the third person, “polite you” Lei conjugation of potere, which is “può,” with an action verb to create a polite question in Italian that asks, “Can/Could you…?” Italian travelers: just remember how to use può and you can ask for whatever you need while in Italy!\n\nWith the simple examples above, one can easily imagine how the present tense conjugation of potere, and especially the verb può, is essential knowledge for one traveling in Italy. Read on for a simple method that will ensure the Italian traveler “can” create a polite sentence in Italian and “will be able to” relay what they need using the verbs posso, possiamo, and especially può.\n\nThis method is an integral part of our Conversational Italian for Travelers series of books. After reading this blog, try our pocket travel book, “Just the Important Phrases,” which summarizes this method and provides essential Italian phrases using può. Many of these phrases have been reprinted here. Use this method to create your own phrases in Italian!\n\nAs I’ve said before, I believe that “commonly used phrases” are the key for how we can all build fluency in any language in a short time.\n\nIf we learn how to incorporate “commonly used phrases” with the Italian verb può, we will be able to communicate just as we do in our native language and ask for whatever we need politely!\n\nThis post is the 61st in a series of Italian phrases we have been trying out in our Conversational Italian! Facebook group. If you’d like to read the earlier posts in the series, “Italian Phrases We Use EVERY Day!” just click HERE\n\nMany “commonly used phrases” in Italian\n\nuse the verbs\n\nPosso, Possiamo,\n\nand especially Può\n\nin order to ask politely\n\nfor what one needs.\n\nSee below for how this works.\n\nAs we all master these phrases, so will you. Try my method and let me know how it works. What sentences will you create with these phrases?\n\nPlease reply. I’d love to hear from you!

This means that potere provides information about the ability of the speaker to “be able to” complete the main action described in a sentence. When used in this way, potere is conjugated to reflect the speaker and the action verb follows directly after in its infinitive form — that is, the action verb is not conjugated! (Remember that Italian verbs are categorized into three infinitive forms by the following endings: -are, -ere, and -ire, and that English infinitive verbs are preceded by “to,” as in, “to go” “to stay,” etc.)\n\nOne can imagine the infinite number of uses for a helping verb with the meanings of potere. This blog will focus the use of potere as a verb of politeness, with emphasis on how to use the third person, or Lei (polite you) conjugation, which is può. Può translates literally as “he/she can” and “you (polite) can.” For purposes of this blog, in order to demonstrate the use of può to mean “polite you” in a question, the translation will be given as the softer English “could.”\n\nOne simple way to use potere while traveling in Italy is to connect the “polite you” conjugation of potere, which is “può” with an action verb in the infinitive.\n\nThis will enable travelers to ask for whatever they need with the polite phrase, “Could you…?”\n\nOf course, polite communication is essential to show respect for others in any language and it is especially important when traveling in Italy to make a good impression, or fare una bella figura!\n\nThe beauty of this method, which uses [può + infinitive verb] to pose a question, is that it is easy to ask for assistance during the course of a typical day. For instance, one were to direct another to act in a specific manner with a statement in Italian (instead of using a question formulated with può) the polite Italian command form would be required. And the polite command form in Italian is relayed with a verb conjugated in the subjunctive mood — a complex form covered in advanced Italian. However, when the request is made with a question that starts with può, the subjunctive conjugation is no longer necessary! Even knowledge of the complete conjugation of potere is not required!\n\nThe traveler only needs to remember the helping verb può and the meaning of the action verb for what they need.\n\nThere is essentially no need to conjugate using this method!\n\nItalian travelers can ask for help understanding fluent Italian, with the many simple transactions of daily life, with directions and transportation needs, and while dining at a restaurant simply by using [può + infinitive verb]. Further discussion of how to use può as a traveler is given below for several different situations, after the present tense conjuration.\n\nFinally, we will also discuss how to use the first person singular and plural conjugations of potere, which are posso and possiamo to ask for what one needs at an Italian restaurant.\n\nOf course, the phrases given will serve as examples and this method can be extrapolated to many different situations!\n\nHow to Conjugate Potere\n\nPotere is an irregular -ere verb in the present tense. As noted above, for many reasons, and especially to be polite in Italian, this verb is essential to commit to memory!\n\nThe complete present tense conjugation of potere is below, with the important conjugations of politeness that are the focus of this blog in green: io (I), “Lei” (polite you) and noi (we).\n\nio posso tu puoi Lei/lei/lui può noi possiamo voi potete loro possono\n\nUse Può to Ask for What You Need!\n\n1. Use può if you are having difficulty understanding fluent Italian.\n\nPuò is an important conjugation of potere for the beginning student of Italian to remember for when he or she needs help conversing with a fluent speaker.\n\n[Può + parlare + adverb] is a polite way to direct someone to speak Italian in way that is helpful to you. Start a sentence with può and then add the infinitive verb parlare and an adverb requesting another to speak more slowly or loudly, for instance. To be even more polite, start your request with, “Per favore…” or “Per piacere…” for “Please…”\n\nNotice from the examples below how the Italian adverb “più,” which means “more,” is also helpful in this situation.\n\n[Può + ripetere] can be used in a simple phrase to ask someone to repeat what they’ve just said. You can also start a sentence with [può + ripetere] and build your Italian sentence one phrase at a time to describe what you’d like in more detail, as with the last examples in the table below.\n\nPer favore,\n\nPuò… Please,\n\nCould you… …parlare più lentamente? …speak more slowly? …parlare più piano? …speak more slowly? …parlare più forte? …speak more loudly? …parlare in inglese? …speak in English? Può ripetere? Could you repeat (that)? Può ripetere… Could you repeat… …che ha detto lui?* …what he said? …che ha detto lei?* …what she said? …che hanno detto loro?* …what they said? …le direzioni?\n\n…le direzioni per il duomo? …the directions?\n\n…the directions to the cathedral? …l’informazione?\n\n…l’informazione sullo spettacolo? …the information?\n\n…the information about the show?\n\n(one piece of information) …le informazioni?\n\n…le informazioni per la riunione di domani? …the information?\n\n…the information for the meeting tomorrow?\n\n(more than one piece of information)\n\n*When a sentence or question starts with che, the subject pronoun is given at the end if one wants to emphasize or clarify who the subject is. Otherwise, the verb ending corresponds to the speaker, as usual.\n\n2. Use può at the service station to ask for assistance with your car\n\nFor those brave enough to rent a car in Italy, assistance from a service station may be necessary. Some useful infinitive verbs to remember that can be used after the polite request is made with può are given below.\n\nIn some places in Italy, it may still be possible to ask for assistance filling a car with gasoline with the phrase “fare il pieno.” Or, at least, one may still see the gas station attendant conversing with a customer in Italian movies from the 1950s and 60s. Although a polite sentence can be made with può in this case, “Può fare il pieno?” “Can you fill it up?” a shortened phrase is usually used, such as, “Il pieno, per favore!” for “Fill it up, please!”\n\nPuò… Could you… …caricare la batteria? …charge the battery? …controllare l’olio? …check the oil? …controllare l’acqua? …check the water? …controllare le gomme? …check the tires? …cambiare la gomma? …change the tire? …aggiustare la gomma che è a terra? fix the flat tire? …riparare la gomma che è a terra? …fix the flat tire?\n\n3. Use “Mi può… ” for every day, simple interactions\n\nA simple question to ask if you are paying in cash and need change uses [mi può + portare] for “Can you bring me…?” Remember that in Italian the pronoun “mi” for “me” comes before the conjugated verb, while in English the pronoun is placed after the verb.\n\nThe Italian pronoun Lei, for “polite you” is left out of the sentence, which, along with the word order can complicate things a bit. But, just remember that in this case we are using a method that specifies può means “polite you.” And, with this method, we don’t have to worry about the conjugating an Italian verb! With this method we can ask for change s follows:\n\nMi può portare il resto, per favore? Could you bring me the change, please?\n\nOf course, the verb portare can also be used to refer to a person, such as when a taxi is needed to transfer someone from one location to another. In this case, just give the address after the phrase “Mi puo portare…” For a proper Italian sentence, remember to use the correct preposition and to put the street number for the address after the street name!\n\nMi può portare in via Verde? Could you bring me to Green Street?\n\nMi può portare a via Melzo 10? Could you bring me 10 Melzo Street?\n\nTo ask the concierge at a hotel to call you a taxi, use [mi può + chiamare] for “Can/Could you call me…” In this case, the Italian “mi” serves as the indirect object pronoun “for me.”\n\nMi può chiamare un taxi? Can you call a taxi for me?\n\nTo ask a shopkeeper to show you an article of clothing or other item of interest, use [mi può + mostrare] for “Can/Could you show me…”\n\nMi può mostrare una camicia bianca? Can you show me a white shirt?\n\n4. Use [Mi può + dire…] to ask for assistance with directions\n\nWhen visiting an unfamiliar city, it may be necessary to ask a stranger for help. In Italy, it is customary to begin this type of conversation with “mi scusi” for “excuse me” (polite command).\n\nThen, an easy way to politely phrase any question you may have is to use the phrase, “Mi può,” which means, “Could you (polite)… me.” To complete the sentence, add the infinitive verb for what you need after this Italian phrase – once again, there is no need to conjugate with this method! If we add dire to the phrase, for instance, we get, “Mi può dire…” for “Could you (polite) tell me…”\n\nExamples below use “Dov’è…?” for “Where is…?” and allow one to ask for directions to place of interest. If the answer to any of these questions involves a particular street, you will hear the phrase in… via, for the English on… street.\n\nLa banca è in via Verde. The bank is on Green Street.\n\nOf course, with this method, one has to be ready to hear the directions in Italian! Examples of useful phrases one might hear in reply are given in the Conversational Italian for Travelers books.\n\nMi scusi, Excuse me, mi può dire could (you pol.) tell me dov’è… where is… …l’albergo? …the hotel? …il ristorante? …the restaurant? …la metro/metropolitana? …the subway? …la fermata dell’autobus? …the bus stop? …la stazione dei treni? …the train station? …la banca? …the bank? …l’ufficio postale? …the post office? …il museo? …the museum?\n\n5. Use [Mi può + dire…] to ask about Italian schedules\n\nUse “Mi puo…” to ask about a schedule for public transportation or when a place of interest opens or closes.\n\nQuando means when and can be added after the phrase, “Mi può dire…” to find out when transportation will arrive (arriva) or depart (parte).\n\nUse quando to ask when a museum, shop, restaurant or other place of interest will open (apre) or will close (chiude). Notice from the literal translation in the table below, which follows the abbreviation “lit.” that the word order to ask these questions is slightly different in Italian and English.\n\nMi può dire Could you (pol.) tell me quando… when… …arriva il treno? …the train arrives?\n\n(lit. arrives the train) …arriva l’autobus? …the bus arrives?\n\n(lit. arrives the bus) …parte il treno? …the train leaves?\n\n(lit. leaves the train) …parte l’autobus? …the bus leaves?\n\n(lit. leaves the bus) …apre il museo? …the museum opens?\n\n(lit. opens the museum) …chiude il museo? …the museum closes?\n\n(lit. closes the museum)\n\n6. Use [Mi può + portare] or [Ci può + portare] at the restaurant\n\nWhile dining at a restaurant, it is often necessary to ask the waiter to bring something to your table. Perhaps you need additional silverware or another napkin. Or maybe another drink or cup of espresso. Just ask the waiter to bring these things to you with the phrase [mi può + portare]. Of course, it will be necessary to remember the Italian for which part of the table setting or which drink you need, as in the examples below. (If you need a refresher on how to use the Italian indefinite article (a, an) or how to create the word “some” in Italian, check out Conversational Italian for Travlers “Just the Grammar.\n\nCultural note: Italian restaurants do not usually serve water or soft drinks with ice (ghiaccio). The reason is often simple — there usually is no ice maker on the premises. Also, many Italians still believe that a very cold drink is not good for one’s health. In short, if you’d like to ask for ice while traveling in Italy, it is possible to do so by asking, “Mi può portare del ghiaccio,” for “Can you bring me some ice?” but don’t be disappointed if there is none available!\n\nAn additional bottle of water or wine, or perhaps an additional basket of bread might be needed for all the guests dining at a table. In this case, one can make a request for the entire table simply by changing the “mi” for “me” in the original phrase to “ci” for “us.”\n\nMi può portare… Could you bring me… Ci può portare… Could you bring us… …dell’acqua naturale? …some still water (natural water)? …dell’acqua con gas/frizzante? …some sparkling water? …del pane/più pane? …some bread/more bread? …del sale e pepe? …some salt and pepper? …un cucchiaio, un coltello, una forchetta? …a spoon, a knife, a fork? …un tovagliolo? …a napkin?\n\nCultural note: remember that there is a charge in Italy for any bread served, whether it is brought to you by request or not! This charge is listed on the bill as the “pane e coperto” or “bread and cover charge,” and, as the name suggests, also serves to reserve the table for as long as the guests would like to stay. An additional charge will be added for any additional bread requested, so don’t be surprised to see this charge on the bill as well. Luckily, the pane e coperto at the time of this writing is usually only 1-3 euros, although more may be charged in an upscale restaurant. It is best to check the notice that should be listed in the menu if you are on a budget.\n\nA simple question to use if you’d like a receipt at a restaurant replaces portare with dare (to give) in the formula; [mi può + dare] means, “Can you give me…?” Remember to ask for the receipt when dining in Italy, as there is no limit for the amount of time one can linger and enjoy food and friends and the waiter will not want to interrupt your time together! Use, “Mi può dare la ricevuta, per favore?” for “Could you give me a receipt, please?\n\n7. Use [Posso + infinitive verb] or [Possiamo + infinitive verb] at the restaurant\n\nIn the table below are some expressions commonly used when dining in a restaurant. The io (I) and noi (we) forms of the verb potere are important to know in this situation, since requests are usually made for oneself or for the entire table.\n\nWe expand the polite use of potere with, “Posso?” for “May I…?” and “Possiamo?” for “May we…?”\n\nUse the reflexive pronoun mi (myself) with [posso + sedersi] when asking to be seated in Italian.Use the reflexive pronoun ci (ourselves) with [possiamo + sedersi] when requesting a group be seated. You will notice from the phrases below that the reflexive pronouns mi and ci are attached to the infinitive action verb sedersiafter removing the -si ending. This is the rule for all [helping verb + reflexive verb] combinations.\n\nSitting is not reflexive in English, so you will not find a reflexive pronoun in the translations in the table below. Instead, English simply uses the verb “sit” alone or sometimes adds the adverb “down” to personalize the meaning of the verb sit.\n\nCultural note: It is not usually necessary to ask for the menu in an Italian restaurant; the waiter will generally bring menus to the table once everyone is seated. But, if for some reason you need to see the menu again, it is customary to make this request in Italian with the verb avere (to have) rather than the American verb “to see.”\n\nLanguage note: In Italian, the word for table has both masculine and feminine endings. The masculine, “il tavolo” refers to any type of table — a table one will be eating on or working on, for instance. When the table is full of food, it becomes feminine, as in “la tavola.” Therefore, if one is simply asking for a table at a certain place in a restaurant (before the food has arrived), the masculine ending applies.\n\nPosso… May I… …sedermi vicino alla finestra?\n\n…sedermi fuori?\n\n… sedermi a un tavolo fuori? …sit by the window?\n\n…sit outside?\n\n…sit at an outside table? …sedermi a un’altro tavolo? …sit at another table? …avere il menù? …see (have) the menu? Possiamo… May we… …sederci vicino alla finestra?\n\n…sederci fuori?\n\n…sederci a un tavolo fuori? …sit by the window?\n\n…sit outside?\n\n…sederci a una tavola fuori? …sederci a un’altro tavolo? …sit at another table? …avere il menù? …see (have) the menu?\n\nFinally, if you have food allergies or special requests, use posso to describe what you can… or cannot do!\n\nNon posso mangiare niente… I cannot eat anything… …fatto con noci/arachidi. …made with nuts/peanuts. …molto piccante. …very spicy.\n\nSimply follow the method detailed in this blog\n\nto use potere to ask for what you need politely\n\nand “fare una bella figura” while in Italy!\n\nI guarantee you will use può every day!\n\nItalian Phrases We Use EVERY Day!® How to Make Comparisons in Italian with “Di”\n\nDo you want to speak Italian more easily and confidently in 2022?\n\nWhy not set a goal to learn Italian, starting today, for the year 2022?
