        "text": "Actress Una Stubbs has died at the age of 84, following an illness, her agent has confirmed.\n\nHer agent said that she died surrounded by her family at home in Edinburgh.\n\nThey added to BBC News that Una had been ill for a few months.\n\nThe star is best known for her roles in EastEnders and Sherlock, as well as in other shows such as Worzel Gummidge and Till Death Us Do Part.\n\nMore recently she had appeared in The Durrells, Call The Midwife and Midsomer Murders.\n\nEastEnders paid tribute to Una in a tweet and said: \"We are so sad to hear the heart-breaking news that Una Stubbs has passed away. Playing the role of Caroline Bishop, Honey's aunty, Una will always be a much-loved part of the EastEnders family. Our thoughts are with her family and friends. RIP\".\n\nUna first found fame in the 1960s when she appeared in Sir Cliff Richard's film Summer Holiday.\n\nIn 2006, Una appeared as Caroline Bishop in six episodes of EastEnders – though her career was seriously varied.\n\nThe actress was born in Hertfordshire and first found her love for performing when attending dance school at 14.\n\nA couple of years later, Una then became a chorus girl at age 16.\n\nAfter starting her career as a dancer, Stubbs became a regular on the small screen in the 60s, playing Alf Garnett's exasperated daughter Rita in Till Death Us Do Part and the 1980s follow-ups 'Til Death and In Sickness and In Health.\n\nShe also starred in a film called Golden Years, which was released on 29 April 2016.\n\nA statement from her family said: \"Mum passed away quietly today with her family around her, in Edinburgh. We ask for privacy and understanding at this most difficult and sad of times.\"\n\nUna's agent Rebecca Blond also spoke of the star: \"We are desperately sad to have lost not only a wonderful actress, whose screen and stage career, spanning over 50 years, was so extraordinarily varied, from Till Death Us Do Part to Sherlock, as well as memorable performances in the West End, at the Old Vic, Donmar Warehouse, Sheffield Crucible and National Theatre, but also a wickedly funny, elegant, stylish, graceful, gracious and kind and constant friend.\n\n\"She was also a highly respected and exhibited artist. We will miss her enormously and remember her always.\"\n\nIn the late 1990s, she also starred in the children's show, The Worst Witch, as well as appearing in The Catherine Tate Show and sitcom Benidorm.\n\nUna's last major role saw her play Sherlock's landlady Mrs Hudson in the BBC drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman.\n\nSherlock creator Steven Moffat remembered Una as \"the loveliest light on Baker Street\" as he paid tribute to her.\n\nWriting on Instagram, he said: \"The loveliest light on Baker Street has gone out. What a woman, what a talent, what a star - and just about the kindest, nicest, funniest person you could meet.\n\n\"I don't know how anyone even starts summing up that career - Till Death Us Do Part, Fawlty Towers, the incomparable Aunt Sally in Worzel Gummidge... and, of course, the irreplaceable heart and soul of Sherlock\".\n\nUna was married to actor Peter Gilmore from 1958 to 1969, with whom she adopted son Jason, and then married Nicky Henson in 1969, before they split in 1975.\n\nThe couple had two sons, Joe and Christian, both of whom are composers. Christian wrote on Twitter: \"Some of you may have known her as Rita, as Sally as Bat or Hudson but to my two brothers and I she was known as Mum.\n\n\"Thanks for everything Mum RIP.\""
