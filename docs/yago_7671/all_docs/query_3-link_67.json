        "text": "Joe Hanson\n\nJoe Hanson, Ph.D., is a science writer, biologist, host, video producer and educator. His quest is to explore ways that digital storytelling can help people think more deeply about the universe they live in.\n\nHe’s the creator and host of “Be Smart,” an award-winning science education show from PBS Digital Studios that celebrates curiosity and the pleasure of finding things out. “Be Smart” has amassed more than 4.7 million subscribers and earned almost half a billion views on YouTube.\n\nJoe is also the creator and co-host of “Hot Mess,” a show about climate change and the environment, and the host and co-writer of “Overview,” an aerial photography show focused on nature and science stories, both from PBS.\n\nHe won the 2017 Webby Award for Best Web Personality for his work on “Be Smart” and a 2021 AAAS Kavli Science Journalism Award for his work on “Overview.”\n\nJoe received his Ph.D. from The University of Texas at Austin, and his science writing has been published by WIRED, Nautilus, Scientific American and Texas Monthly. He has appeared in numerous national and international print and broadcast media outlets including CNN and NPR. One time, he had a Twitter conversation with an astronaut while they were in space, which was pretty cool. He lives in Austin, Texas.\n\nRen Smith\n\n(11:30 A.M.)\n\nRen Smith is a member of the Polymathic Scholars Program and is graduating with an Honors B.S.A. in Neuroscience, with certificates in Forensic Science and Evidence and Inquiry. They began research in the Microbe Hackers stream of the Freshman Research Initiative under the guidance of Dr. Dennis Mishler and continued working with the stream throughout their time at UT. In a collaborative project between the labs of Dr. Jeffrey Barrick and Dr. Nancy Moran, Ren investigated symbiont-mediated RNAi in bee species and presented their research at several events, include the Gulf Coast Undergraduate Research Symposium at Rice University. Their work has earned the CNS and Thermo-Fisher Scientific Awards for Excellence in Molecular Biology and awards for outstanding presentation. In addition to this research, Ren has studied the consequences of political and ideological polarization and completed a thesis entitled “The Value of Incorporating Sociohistorical Nuance in Mis/disinformation and Polarization Research,” with the help of their faculty supervisor Dr. Samuel Woolley. Ren is also an emergency medical technician and will continue working as an EMT in the Austin area after graduation. Moving forward, Ren is interested in investigating clinical neuropharmacology and intersectional approaches to healthcare, and they are applying to medical school to pursue these passions.\n\nAyotoluwafunmi Osunsade\n\n(3:30 P.M.)\n\nAyotoluwafunmi Osunsade is a proud Nigerian and South Asian woman, born and raised in Houston, Texas, and graduating with a B.S. in Public Health, a B.A. in African and African Diaspora Studies and a certificate in Pre-Health Professions. During her time at UT, Tolu has worked as a Freshman Research Initiative peer mentor, a mentor for the Texas Institute for Discovery Education in Science and a course assistant in public health, Black Studies and integrative biology. Most recently, she has served as an intern at a local reproductive justice organization, course assistant for a health equities course and research assistant in a Black reproductive justice laboratory under Dr. Nessette Falu. As a recipient of the President’s Award for Global Learning, Tolu and her team were able to create an independent magazine entitled, Hair, highlighting phenotypic attributes and collective care to explore the impact on BIPOC members’ journey through postsecondary education in the U.S. and U.K. Above all, she is guided by radical love and care for her communities and hopes to always amplify and uplift the narratives of those often cast aside and erased.\n\n11:30 AM\n\nPearlyn Yi Hui Ang, B.S.A.
