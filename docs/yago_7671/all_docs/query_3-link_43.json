To serve their public purpose, our higher education institutions must also commit deeply to Civic and Community Engagement in teaching and research. Our faculty reward systems (including promotion, tenure or long-term contracts for non-tenure-track faculty, and post-tenure review) shape whom we attract, support, and retain as faculty. This virtual symposium will explore how faculty reward systems can be structured to support both of these critical and intersecting themes in higher education--Equity and Public Engagement.

Sessions throughout the day will begin to address these questions and will be customized to faculty and campus executives who are essential to the process.\n\nWhere do we go from Here?

Experiences, feelings, and dreams make up the raw material of this record. Each story is unique, yet they all have in common a shared border and a shared dream of heading north. Corazόn Norte hopes to offer the audience a richer understanding of migration by exploring the individual stories that embody its complexity, its horrors, and the depth of its humanity. Its ultimate goal is to light a passion for the dignity of each person regardless of which side on any line he or she stands.
