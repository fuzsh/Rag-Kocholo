        "text": "PETER GILMORE, the star of long-running BBC seafaring drama The Onedin Line, has died aged 81.\n\nThe actor, who also appeared in many of the Carry On films, died after a long illness, his family said yesterday.\n\nPeter clocked up appearances in shows including Doctor Who, The Persuaders, Ruth Rendell Mysteries and Heartbeat.\n\nBut he is best remembered for his portrayal of shipping magnate James Onedin in 91 episodes of the 1970s series.\n\nHis co-star Jessica Benton said: “The Onedin Line was a very happy, long-running series to be involved in and that was all credit to Peter because he made it so.\n\n“We all became very close over the years and had a lot of fun. Peter was a gentleman and we sorely miss him.”\n\nPeter’s character James was memorable for his ruthlessness and huge muttonchop sideburns.\n\nThe saga followed the fortunes of a family-run shipping line in the 19th century and its theme tune became well known to a generation.\n\nPeter was born in Leipzig, Germany, and came to the UK aged six. He was raised in Nunthorpe, Yorkshire, and left school at 14 to pursue an acting career.\n\nHis big break came when he landed a role in the TV series Ivanhoe in 1958. He went on to appear in west end musical successes such as Lock Up Your Daughters and The Beggar’s Opera.\n\nThe father of one also joined the casts of many films including popular comedies Carry On Up The Khyber, Carry On Henry and the ghoulish horror film The Abominable Doctor Phibes.\n\nPeter, who died on Sunday at Trinity Hospice in London, was the husband of actress Una Stubbs for more than a decade and went on to marry Anne Stallybrass, who also played his wife in The Onedin Line.\n\nHis agent Primie Carey, of Roger Carey Associates, said: “On behalf of his wife Anne and Peter’s family, I would like to thank those who have sent their kind thoughts and condolences and would request their privacy is respected at this sad time.”"
