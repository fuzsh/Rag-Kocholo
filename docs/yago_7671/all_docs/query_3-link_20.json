        "text": "Published\n\n12 August 2021\n\nActress Una Stubbs, who appeared in some of the best-loved shows on British TV from the 1960s to the 2010s, has died at the age of 84.\n\nShe found fame in Cliff Richard's 1963 film Summer Holiday before starring in hit sitcom Till Death Us Do Part.\n\nThe actress went on to appear in shows like Worzel Gummidge, The Worst Witch, EastEnders and Sherlock.\n\nHer agent paid tribute to her as \"a wonderful actress\" and \"graceful, gracious and kind and constant friend\".\n\nAfter starting her career as a dancer, Stubbs became a fixture on the small screen in the 60s when she played Alf Garnett's exasperated daughter Rita in Till Death Us Do Part and the 1980s follow-ups 'Til Death and In Sickness and In Health.\n\nShe was also a regular on the game show Don't Say A Word and its follow-up Give us a Clue, and became a favourite of young audiences as Aunt Sally in Worzel Gummidge.\n\nShe starred in another children's hit, The Worst Witch, in the late 1990s, as well as playing Caroline Bishop in soap EastEnders and appearing in comedies The Catherine Tate Show and Benidorm.\n\nHer last major role saw her play Sherlock's landlady Mrs Hudson in the BBC drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch.\n\n'What a talent'\n\nSherlock creator Steven Moffat remembered Stubbs as \"the loveliest light on Baker Street\".\n\nWriting on Instagram, he said, external: \"What a woman, what a talent, what a star - and just about the kindest, nicest, funniest person you could meet.\n\n\"I don't know how anyone even starts summing up that career - Till Death Us Do Part, Fawlty Towers, the incomparable Aunt Sally in Worzel Gummidge... and, of course, the irreplaceable heart and soul of Sherlock\".\n\nIn a statement, Stubbs' sons Joe and Christian Henson and Jason Gilmore said: \"Mum passed away quietly today with her family around her, in Edinburgh. We ask for privacy and understanding at this most difficult and sad of times.\"\n\nHer agent Rebecca Blond, who represented Stubbs for more than 20 years, said she would \"miss her enormously and remember her always\".\n\nThe veteran actress had been ill for a few months, Blond told BBC News.\n\nShe said: \"We are desperately sad to have lost not only a wonderful actress, whose screen and stage career, spanning over 50 years, was so extraordinarily varied, from Till Death Us Do Part to Sherlock, as well as memorable performances in the West End, at the Old Vic, Donmar Warehouse, Sheffield Crucible and National Theatre, but also a wickedly funny, elegant, stylish, graceful, gracious and kind and constant friend.\n\n\"She was also a highly respected and exhibited artist.\"\n\nStubbs exhibited in the Royal Academy's Summer Exhibition, and her passion for art made her the perfect choice to co-host BBC One's The Big Painting Challenge in 2015.\n\nBroadcaster Gyles Brandreth paid tribute, external, saying it was \"a sad day\".\n\nHe wrote: \"Such a funny, lovely, gifted lady - a marvellous actress with a special style & a great (and impish) sense of humour.\"\n\nFellow dancer and actress Bonnie Langford said it was \"such a loss\".\n\nShe said, external: \"She made everything look so effortless. A consummate professional, kind, gracious, elegant, versatile and fun. Her Aunt Sally was a masterclass alone.\"\n\nOther tributes came from across the entertainment industry.\n\nThis Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.
