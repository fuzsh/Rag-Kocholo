        "text": "German-born Gilmore clocked up appearances in numerous TV dramas such as Doctor Who, The Persuaders, Ruth Rendell Mysteries and Heartbeat.\n\nBut he will be best remembered for his portrayal of the mutton-chopped lead, James Onedin, in 91 episodes of BBC1 series The Onedin Line.\n\nThe saga - with its theme tune familiar to a generation - followed the fortunes of a family shipping line in the second half of the 19th century.\n\nHis co-star Jessica Benton, who also appeared in other BBC period dramas The Duchess Of Duke Street and Upstairs, Downstairs, said: \"The Onedin Line was a very happy, long-running series to be involved in and that was all credit to Peter because he made it so.\n\n\"We all became very close friends over the years and had a lot of fun. Peter was a gentle man and a gentleman and we sorely miss him.\"\n\nBorn in Leipzig, he came to the UK at six and was raised in Nunthorpe, North Yorkshire, leaving school at 14 to pursue an acting career.\n\nHis big break was in the TV series Ivanhoe in 1958, and he went on to appear in West End musical stage successes such as Lock Up Your Daughters and The Beggar's Opera.\n\nAmong his many films, he appeared in popular comedies such as Carry On Up The Khyber and Carry On Henry and the ghoulish British horror film The Abominable Doctor Phibes.\n\nGilmore - who died on Sunday - was married to actress Una Stubbs for more than a decade and went on to marry Anne Stallybrass, who also played his wife in The Onedin Line.\n\nHis agent Primie Carey, of Roger Carey Associates, said: \"On behalf of his wife Anne and Peter's family I would like to thank those who have sent their kind thoughts and condolences and would request their privacy is respected at this sad time.\""
