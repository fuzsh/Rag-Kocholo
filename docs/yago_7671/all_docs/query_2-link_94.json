        "text": "Her agent said she died at her home in Edinburgh surrounded by her family and that she had been ill for several months.\n\nA statement from her family said: \"Mum passed away quietly today with her family around her, in Edinburgh. We ask for privacy and understanding at this most difficult and sad of times.\"\n\nRebecca Blond, her agent, said: \"We are desperately sad to have lost not only a wonderful actress, whose screen and stage career, spanning over 50 years, was so extraordinarily varied, from Till Death Us Do Part to Sherlock, as well as memorable performances in the West End, at the Old Vic, Donmar Warehouse, Sheffield Crucible and National Theatre, but also a wickedly funny, elegant, stylish, graceful, gracious and kind and constant friend.\n\n\"She was also a highly respected and exhibited artist. We will miss her enormously and remember her always.\"\n\nThe 1963 film Summer Holiday helped to make Stubbs's name after she starred in the musical alongside Sir Cliff Richard.\n\nShe went on to star in BBC sitcom Till Death Us Do Part and its sequel In Sickness And In Health, playing Rita Rawlings.\n\nIn addition to her work as an actress, Stubbs was also a keen amateur painter who had her work displayed at the Royal Academy in London.\n\nShe was married to actor Peter Gilmore from 1958 to 1969, with whom she adopted son Jason, and later married Nicky Henson in 1969, before they split in 1975. The couple had two sons, Joe and Christian, both of whom are composers.\n\nChristian wrote on Twitter: \"Some of you may have known her as Rita, as Sally as Bat or Hudson but to my two brothers and I she was known as Mum. Thanks for everything Mum RIP.\"\n\nSteven Moffat, the Sherlock creator, remembered Stubbs as \"the loveliest light on Baker Street\" as he paid tribute to her.\n\nWriting on Instagram, he said: \"The loveliest light on Baker Street has gone out. What a woman, what a talent, what a star - and just about the kindest, nicest, funniest person you could meet.\n\n\"I don't know how anyone even starts summing up that career - Till Death Us Do Part, Fawlty Towers, the incomparable Aunt Sally in Worzel Gummidge ... and, of course, the irreplaceable heart and soul of Sherlock\"."
