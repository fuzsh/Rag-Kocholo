The versatile star, who also appeared in a number of Carry On films, died in a London hospice on Sunday following a long illness.

Gilmore clocked up appearances in numerous TV shows such as Doctor Who, The Persuaders, The Ruth Rendell Mysteries and Heartbeat.

But he will be best remembered for his portrayal of the rugged, mutton-chopped ship’s captain, James Onedin, in 91 episodes of The Onedin Line, from 1971 to 1980.

Gilmore was married to actress Una Stubbs from 1958 to 1969 and went on to marry Anne Stallybrass, who played his wife in The Onedin Line.

The saga, with its memorable and stirring theme tune from Khachaturian’s Spartacus, followed the fortunes of a shipping line in the 19th century.

Co-star Jessica Benton said: “The Onedin Line was a very happy, series and that was all credit to Peter. We all became very close friends over the years and had a lot of fun. Peter was a gentle man and a gentleman and we sorely miss him.”

His agent Primie Carey said: “On behalf of his wife, Anne, and Peter’s family, I would like to thank those who have sent their condolences.”

Gilmore was born in Leipzig, Germany, but, aged six, came to Nunthorpe, Yorkshire, to be raised by ­relatives. He left school at 14 to pursue an acting career.

His first big break was in the TV series Ivanhoe in 1958 and film credits include Carry On Up The Khyber and Carry On Henry, ­alongside comedy stars Sid James and Barbara Windsor.
