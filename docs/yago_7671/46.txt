Una was married to The Onedin Line actor Peter Gilmore from 1958 to 1969 and then to Fawlty Towers star Nicky Henson between 1969 and 1975.

With Peter, Una adopted her eldest son Jason, and then went on to have two more sons with Nicky.

Una’s younger sons Joe and Christian are now both working as composers.

In a touching tribute to their mum, Christian Henson wrote: “Some of you may have known her as Rita, as Sally as Bat or Hudson but to my two brothers and I she was known as Mum.

“I personally will miss her greatly and I know that our industry on the whole will also miss her greatly.

“Her talent, her joy, everything that she was will remain with us though.

“While we remember her, she will still be with us.”

Sherlock creator Steven Moffat also paid homage to the actress, adding that “the loveliest light on Baker Street has gone out.”
