        "text": "The year is 1991. In Harare, the capital of Zimbabawe, at the end of a Commonwealth summit, Elizabeth II appears in the marquee on the lawn of the British High Commission. The guest freezes. The sovereign is smaller than you might imagine. Her handshake is limp and her voice nasal, the ends of her sentences trailing off. And yet she exudes a natural authority. She looks her guest up and down with the faintest hint of a smile. Conversation is limited to two banal questions. A short silence ensues. The queen disappears. The monarch excels at this role: appearing at once accessible and inaccessible. She is a true queen, as former French president François Mitterrand once declared admiratively.\n\nOne always had the impression of having already seen Elizabeth II in a wax museum like at Madam Tussauds in London. The queen, who died on Thursday, September 8, at the age of 96, was a living page of history who worked with no fewer than 15 British prime ministers, 13 American presidents and all the heads of state of France's Fifth Republic. She held audiences with political personalities from all over the world, from Churchill to de Gaulle, to Kennedy and Nehru.\n\nShe was also a symbol. Under her reign, the United Kingdom saw the joys of success and the pangs of defeat, demonstrating that the monarchy could be the connecting thread between the old, broken order and a new one yet to be invented.\n\nCourteous and unflappable\n\nThe most photographed and painted monarch in the world, Elizabeth II was perhaps more of a living computer. Had she not been Queen, walled up in the silence and dignity that befits not only a head of state and head of an Empire – now a Commonwealth – but also the head of the army and the Supreme Governor of the Church of England, what a writer of memoirs she could have been! It makes you wonder, though, if this small, shy, poorly-educated woman secretly hated her role all her life. No one was ever able to read on her impassive face the secrets that she took to the grave.\n\nLittle touched by literary or artistic concerns, Elizabeth II was instead the very essence of the English landed gentry, devoted to the cult of animals. When not carrying out her official visits, she was always surrounded by her beloved corgis, who were treated with the utmost care.\n\nEven to her few friends, Elizabeth II did not give much of herself away\n\nThere was always the same composure in the most dramatic situations, the same sense of control when faced with trying events. The photo showing her sitting alone at a pew in the chapel of Windsor Castle, dressed in black in front of the coffin of her husband Prince Philip at his funeral on April 17, 2021, sums up her stoicism. Courteous and unflappable, she never blinked at the tabloid press' cruel attacks on her family, especially during the crisis caused by Princess Diana’s death in a car crash in Paris on August 31, 1997.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Elizabeth II's Jubilee: Four days of national joy\n\nThe Queen remained inscrutable, even during the dramatic rupture that her grandson Harry and his wife Meghan Markle made with the rest of the royal family in 2020, as well as by their accusations of racism against the Windsors – accusations, however, that didn't include the sovereign. Instead, she only released a statement in an attempt to ease tensions. Similarly, she expressed nothing when her son Andrew was accused of sexually assaulting a minor, but removed his military titles and charity patronages in January 2022. Even to her few friends, Elizabeth II did not give herself away.\n\nWhen she was born in London in the elegant district of Mayfair on April 21, 1926, nothing indicated that Elizabeth Mary Windsor would one day accede to the throne. She was the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York. The Duke was the second son of King George V, who was succeeded on January 20, 1936, by Edward, Prince of Wales. As the niece of the future king, she was set to become simply a minor member of the royal family.\n\nHorses: Her life's passion\n\nHer childhood was idyllic. But on December 10, 1936, following her uncle Edward VIII's abdication, her father acceded to the throne as King George VI. Elizabeth became Crown Princess at the age of 10 and found herself, along with her parents and younger sister Margaret, thrust into the spotlight overnight.\n\nShe quickly started to receive training in her duties as princess. While Margaret was known for her whimsical nature, Elizabeth was characterized by her seriousness and diligence. Her governess Viscountess Marie-Antoinette de Bellaigue taught her French. The princess made her first official speech in French when she was 13 years old at President Lebrun's state visit to London in 1939.\n\nElizabeth didn’t go to school. Private tutors taught her German, a language in which she was soon able to hold a conversation, as well as history and a rudimentary introduction to state affairs. The princess learned to ride horses, a sport that would remain her great passion. She loved horseracing and had her own stable in her colors. Family life was calm and balanced, if a little stilted under a rigorous set of rules.\n\nHer beloved father George VI was a shy man, fundamentally kind, but afflicted by a terrible stammer. He was tormented by his new role, which he had neither sought out nor wanted. When the Second World War broke out in September 1939, the King wanted to send his wife and two daughters to Canada, following a suggestion by then-prime minister Winston Churchill. But the queen refused to leave, so the princesses stayed at Windsor Castle, outside London, rather than at Buckingham Palace, which was considered too vulnerable. To raise national morale, \"Lilibet,\" as Elizabeth was nicknamed, made even more public appearances, wearing her Grenadier Guard’s uniform or the ambulance driver uniform she wore while learning to drive at the Aldershot military camp. At the end of 1944, Elizabeth got her driver's license, qualifying under the number 230873, and joined the army reserve as an ambulance driver. She would often speak on the radio to her future subjects.\n\nQueen at the age of 25\n\nWith peace restored, Elizabeth accompanied her parents on their travels in the UK and the Commonwealth and made her first speeches. On November 20, 1947, she married a distant cousin, Philip Mountbatten, who was a member of the Greek royal family. The wedding was one of the first televised events to be broadcast throughout Western Europe. This loving marriage brought Elizabeth both happiness and stability and would produce four children: Charles (1948), Anne (1950), Andrew (1960) and Edward (1964). They would go on to give Elizabeth and Philip eight grandchildren. But meanwhile, the health of Elizabeth's father, who was suffering from cancer and exhausted by the heaviness of the Crown, began to falter.\n\nAt the beginning of 1952, with Philip by her side, the princess made an official visit to Kenya, in the first stage of a tour that would take her to the Indian subcontinent and Australia. On February 6, King George VI died in his sleep at Sandringham Castle. Elizabeth, as his eldest daughter, succeeded him. She was 25 years old.\n\nAt Heathrow Airport on February 7, politicians lined up behind Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who was wearing a black overcoat, and greeted the slim, frail figure as she stepped off the plane from Entebbe. An officer of state, the Lord Great Chamberlain, had to write the name chosen by the new monarch on the official accession document. She could have chosen Mary III rather than risk a possible confusion with her mother, Queen Elizabeth. She opted for her first name.\n\nAt 11:15 am, on February 8, 1952, Elizabeth II was proclaimed Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Head of the Commonwealth, Supreme Governor of the Church of England and Commander-in-Chief of the British Armed Forces.\n\nA new Elizabethan era\n\n\"I pray that God will help me to discharge worthily this heavy task that has been laid upon me so early in my life,\" declared the 40th British monarch to rule since William the Conqueror. A memorable photo shows the three queens together – Elizabeth II, her mother Elizabeth and grandmother Mary – all wearing long, black veils around the catafalque in Westminster Hall.\n\nWith this image, the country felt immortal. The young queen represented a new link in the chain, down through the ages from Egbert of Wessex to the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha family, renamed Windsor. Sixteen months later, she was crowned in Westminster Abbey, a ceremony that was one of the first celebrations to be broadcast on television.\n\nWinston Churchill then evoked the beginning of a new \"Elizabethan\" era, in reference to the Tudor queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603), who had inherited a disunited and weak kingdom and left behind her a rich and much-feared nation. At the beginning of Elizabeth II's reign, England could still give the illusion of being a powerful country. That year, Britain became a nuclear power. But the country was economically exhausted by the hard-won victory over Nazism; the pound was falling, GDP was falling, societal unrest was on the rise and the Empire was fissuring under the pressure of decolonization.\n\nShe relied on the same pillars as Queen Victoria: The palace, the army, religion and the nobility\n\nIn the years following her coronation, this apparently self-effacing young woman enjoyed a personal prestige that no one expected. The Queen possessed an indispensable character trait that some called determination, others authority. While she had neither the biting irony nor the severe bun of Queen Victoria (1837-1901), her great-great-grandmother who ascended the throne at the age of 17, their demeanor was the same: self-control imbued with aloofness.\n\nShe thwarted her uncle Lord Mountbatten's attempts to bring back the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha name, which had been replaced by Windsor in 1917 owing to anti-German sentiment during the First World War. She then denied Philip the title of king consort and marginalized his mother, who was influential among the old guard at the palace.\n\nIn 1955, she vetoed her sister Margaret's plan to marry Group Captain Peter Townsend, who was deputy Master of the Royal Household. Twenty years older than her, he was also divorced, which made him an unacceptable choice in the eyes of the Church of England. Little by little, the courtiers appointed during the previous reign were replaced by less conservative personalities, although they were cut from the same cloth: scions of great families and career soldiers. She relied on the same pillars as Queen Victoria: the palace, the army, religion and the nobility.\n\nThe glamor of Lady Diana\n\nIn 1981, she approved the union between her eldest son and Lady Diana, which brought the British monarchy some much-needed glamor. But when, after their divorce in 1996, the scandals surrounding the royal couple threatened to destabilize the dynasty, the Queen became strongly opposed to her ex-daughter-in-law. The sovereign was a traditional woman. For a long time, divorcees had been banned from her court – the height of hypocrisy in light of the matrimonial antics of her sister and three of her children.\n\nThe way members of the royal household were recruited was tainted by sexism. The Queen, in fact, preferred to work with men. As the Colonel-in-Chief of hundreds of regiments, she was closely associated with the armed forces, with whom she shared a sense of hierarchy, but she never had a female equerry. It was not until the 1990s and a campaign led by Prince Charles that West Indians were allowed to join the grenadier regiments of her guard.\n\nPolitically, the Queen had always been scrupulous about not interfering in government affairs by making her position known. No one has ever known her opinion on Brexit. There was no question of the monarch mixing her personal convictions with the duties of her office. She never gave interviews to the media. The tone of her annual Christmas message, the only speech she would write without ministerial approval, was always harmonious with public opinion. Nothing was ever disclosed about the content of the the weekly private audience between the head of state and the tenants of 10 Downing Street.\n\nEmbodiment of the sacred\n\nThe official line is that the queen is authorized to provide encouragement, warnings and advice to her government. The sovereign embodies the sacred without holding the reins of power, ensuring the balance of democracy. Even if the head of state has access to the most secret files in the famous red boxes and a ‘privy council’ made up of the most eminent figures in the kingdom, their role in practice is one of notary, simply signing off on decisions taken by others. For example, the \"Queen’s Speech\" that she delivers each year is drafted by her government.\n\nDespite these limits to what she could actually do, Elizabeth II was certainly not a purely ornamental head of state. It is the queen's job to appoint a prime minister. The UK's first-past-the-post electoral system certainly makes this task easier, by already providing a majority in the House of Commons. Faced with a hung parliament in 1974, Queen Elizabeth II chose Labour's Harold Wilson, her favorite prime minister, who she believed was better able to form a Liberal-backed cabinet than the Conservative Edward Heath. Even Margaret Thatcher, who had a mind of her own, recognized the value of having someone who was up to speed with state affairs but well above the political fray.\n\nA centrist leaning\n\nTestimony from both British and foreign dignitaries draws a picture of a monarch with little interest in Westminster's parliamentary jousting. Elizabeth II was a moderate right-winger. Her antipathy for the authoritarian Margaret Thatcher, the rumors of her concerns over a rise in social unrest under the Tories between 1979 and 1997 and the risks of the Commonwealth breaking up because of sanctions against apartheid South Africa were signs of her centrist-leaning attitude. This explains why she got on so well with old-school Conservative prime ministers, in particular her mentor Winston Churchill, the thoroughly middle-class Harold Macmillan and Anthony Eden and the aristocrat Lord Home.\n\nHer relationships with right-wing, working-class leaders such as Edward Heath, Margaret Thatcher and John Major were more difficult, as their convictions on subjects like privatization or Europe damaged the country's unity. Conversely, she had very friendly working relationships with Harold Wilson, James Callaghan and Tony Blair. No-one is more of a monarchist than a Labour party leader.\n\nIn general, the personal interventions of this very devout Anglican were limited to the appointments of the palace's bishops. To make her views known publicly, however, she didn't hesitate to call on other members of the royal family (the Duke of Edinburgh or Prince Charles), who never shied away from open criticism of government policy.\n\nA unifying approach\n\nHer second achievement was to unite the diverse people of the United Kingdom. The head of state acts as the guarantor for the nation’s unity in the face of dividing forces at the country's margins, particularly in Scotland.\n\nFinally, despite the accession of the United Kingdom to the European Economic Community in 1973, which later became the European Union, the Queen succeeded in maintaining links with the Commonwealth, the great overseas family for which she had special affection. Her moral authority at the head of this association of former colonies enabled her to defuse three constitutional crises in Australia (1975), Grenada (1983) and Fiji (1987).\n\nThe Queen knew all the heads of state of the Commonwealth personally, as well as those from many other countries. She was the first British sovereign to set foot in Russia (1994) and China (1986). In May 2011, she made one of her most delicate official trips: a state visit to the Republic of Ireland. It was a triumph, despite wounds on both sides from a 30-year civil war in Northern Ireland, still under the aegis of the Crown of England.\n\nGiving in to pressure from her husband first, and then from Prince Charles, Elizabeth II gradually agreed to give the public a less solemn image of the monarchy\n\nThe monarch saw herself as the head of the \"royal firm,\" as her father had called the Royal House of Windsor. She took care of the kingdom’s big affairs while others had their own particular niche: the environment and racial minorities (Charles), sport (Philip), health (Anne) and foreign trade (Andrew).\n\nGiving in to pressure from her husband and then from Prince Charles, Elizabeth II gradually agreed to give the public a less solemn image of the monarchy. A famous BBC report broadcast in 1969 showed the Queen and her family cooking sausages during a picnic in Scotland and opened the way to a more relaxed style of media coverage.\n\nAfter the annus horribilis of 1992, when both Charles and Andrew saw their respective marriages destroyed, and her favorite residence, Windsor Castle, went up in flames, she started stepping outside the beaten paths of protocol: she visited a pub, a McDonald's and a low-income housing development, abolished the civil list, stopped using charter planes for travel and sold the Britannia yacht. Most of the old barriers had been broken down.\n\nAlways reserved and often distant\n\nBut Elizabeth II was not the type to invite garbage collectors to her table or do her shopping on a bicycle. Besides, few Britons would want the popularization of an immutable institution like the monarchy that spans centuries. As the essayist Walter Bagehot (1826-1877) said, \"One may have a splendid court or no court at all, but nothing can justify a mediocre court.\"\n\nWe had to wait until the dismantling of the yacht \"Britannia\" in December 1997 to see her shed a few tears in public\n\nDestined to ascend the throne from a young age, Elizabeth was always reserved and often distant. It was not until the Royal Yacht Britannia was dismantled in December 1997 that she was seen shedding a tear in public. Two months earlier, when Diana died, she had been unable to show any emotion at all, while the rest of the country was in tears.\n\nSome left-wing voices have criticized the cost of the monarchy, questioning her castles, stables and personal fortune as well as it's outdated customs. More personally, a minority of republican pundits have lambasted her for her backward-looking personality, veneration of established customs and wariness of change.\n\nIf she always cultivated the old-fashioned, traditional values of her social class and remained very attached to the pomp of royalty, Elizabeth II nevertheless made multiple concessions in the modern era. Her formidable ability to adapt to the changing times was demonstrated when she relaxed protocol for her grandson Prince William's wedding to a commoner, Catherine Middleton, on April 29, 2011; her presence at the Buckingham Palace rock concert during her Diamond Jubilee in June 2012, and her appearance in a short film alongside James Bond actor Daniel Craig, which was broadcast during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games on July 28, 2012.\n\nNo one has ever questioned Elizabeth II's sense of duty, goodwill and professionalism. Through her quiet dignity, her total dedication to her office and her shrewd intelligence, the queen, aristocrat by birth but petit bourgeois in taste, succeeded in anchoring more firmly than ever one of the most anachronistic institutions in the world: the British monarchy."
