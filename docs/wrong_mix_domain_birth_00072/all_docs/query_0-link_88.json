        "text": "Many congratulations to Eliza who has won the Outlet Publishing Young Writers’ competition! She is a former pupil of Cargilfield, now at Rugby School.\n\n‘Eleven Months is part of a bigger project that I am working on; I am in the process of editing a draft of my book that I have been writing. It is my personal experience of the battle between Cancer and my Mum, who died in 2016 when I was 12. As I was so young, I want to publish this book to different help centres and areas for people who have been through what my family have been through and, hopefully, find some consolation from it. I took several different areas of my Cancer experience and molded them into a present tense reality and past tense flash backs. In this process of writing and revisiting memories and times that I had shut off for a few years, my writing is both very honest, real, and emotional. I have tried to portray my own emotions from the time, as well as the endless days spent waiting for the day my life would change, within the story. Cancer is a topic that is often shied away from, as often it is one that struggles to be breached, whether it affects you directly or not. This is something that I want to change, so I want to share my experience with the disease so that others feel that they can do the same.’\n\nA fabulous achievement! Well done, Eliza.\n\nhttp://www.outletpublishinggroup.com/2020/11/02/short-story-competition-2020-results/?fbclid=IwAR36TMaqjYREXDTJcj6meDUlQfnJ9TV0-uGga_Sh92SlqI6rZPC2fdgLfEI\n\nHere is Eliza’s winning entry.\n\nThe door cracks open and Dad’s familiar hand gently shakes my shoulder urgently. Having hardly slept, light floods into my eyes and, when the speckles fade, I see it‘s 5:13. I realise within seconds I’m not at home and the memories of the last day crash into my brain just as a tsunami crashes into a village.\n\n“Siz, come through,” he says, fear holding his eyes. My head dizzies, my stomach curls, my palms are sweaty.\n\nSuddenly we are by her side, thick rasping breaths filling the air. My sleepy heart thumps in rhythm to the bleep of machines in the room.\n\nI grip Dad’s hand tightly, his body a plank next to mine. Nurses flap around Mum’s body and I just want to rip the tubes off her face and unplug the wall and to put a plaster on her lungs like she does to my knees when I fall in hockey and have her hold me and stroke my hair and feel her soft cashmere on her cheeks which she doesn’t mind me soaking when tears seep from my eyes and my heart aches as I think that it’ll never happen again.\n\nCharlie looks up sadly at me, still holding Mum’s hand tightly. Both my Granny’s and Auntie Caroline are sitting in a semi-circle around the foot of the bed and Dad resumes his place on the other side of Mum, holding her other hand. I sit on his knee but my little arm is too small to reach over the rail, so I just hug Dad limply. I think of Halloween, just two months ago in October; Mum had patted her knee, asking for me to sit, but I felt I was too heavy for her fragile frame, that her knees may snap if I sat down. I shook my head and hated the flash of hurt in her eyes. How could I tell her I thought I might squash her?\n\nIf this is to be it, if this really is Mum leaving, then all I want is to climb under the covers with her by my side and just hold each other like we did when I had been sick or had a nightmare.\n\nI wait.\n\nI sit by her side, we talk to her.\n\nI hold her hands, letting go when the nurses come throughout the early hours of the morning.\n\nI watch with a hole in my heart as she wheezes and grasps for the tiniest piece of oxygen.\n\nWe stare in disbelief as we think of the woman who, eleven months ago, was the brightest butterfly out there; it doesn’t seem like the Mum who came to pick me up from school that day when we saw Dad and Tokai, our Vizsla, on a run, trainers splashing water up from puddles.\n\n“Should we soak them?” Mum asked wickedly.\n\nOf course I said yes, and Mum revved the engine as we passed, spraying water all over him. Mum rolled down the window, grinning, and flicked the V’s to Dad who stood there laughing.\n\nWhen came Dad back through the door a few minutes later, he tried to hug a laughing Mum who thwacked him with a pillow up the stairs to have a shower.\n\nIt didn’t seem like the Mum who plaited my hair after Mum and Dad told Charlie and me of the diagnosis, holding me, radiating love. But now I feel disconnected from my body, the only evidence of reality is when I pinch my leg, gently at first, and when I’m still in the room and haven’t woken up from this dream, I pinch harder. There she still is in front of me, hairless, unnaturally skinny, lying in a decaying cocoon of skin and bones. I can hardly believe the past Eleven Months; the frightening days, the incessant savage nights, the infinite chemo and radiotherapy. The sympathetic looks, the multitudes of drugs and injections, once causing a burst vein, the rollercoaster of better and then worse. The nurses and live-in carers invading our house, the relentless uncertainness every hour, the never-ending shadow of death.\n\nThis woman who lay in front of me is not the Mum I know, and I despise it.\n\nI long for Mum who I used to snuggle with on the sofa.\n\nMum who took me to Waitrose and bought me the Beano when I was little.\n\nMum who went shopping with me, drove me to school, picked me up from school.\n\nMum who is so much more than any Mum;\n\nMum who is just Mum.\n\nShe survives the night.\n\nThe next day, we shower to wash yesterday’s grime off ourselves and wipe away the crusty sleep off our faces. Deep caverns of purple are engraved under all our eyes, faces pale compared to our normally healthy and tanned complexions.\n\nWe agree that Auntie Caroline and I will drive home to pick up clean clothes for everyone and some forms of entertainment; I jumped at the opportunity to escape. The last time we had been alone together was just a mere seventeen hours ago where I had asked Auntie Caroline how long Mum had left. It was now the first of December and Christmas was only a few weeks away; what if she died on Christmas?\n\n“I don’t really know, Lizy. The doctors haven’t given a date; it really could be a day, could be a couple.” She had said, putting her arm around my shoulders. I was stunned. Mum and I had already started listening to Christmas music in the car and now she wasn’t even going to be there for the real day?\n\nAs we drive along, memories flood my mind. First, we pass the road to Mulberry Walk where Mum and I had gone to have her hair shaved off back in October. We had parked the car right outside smugly as we had our disabled badge, the key to unlocking different and normally unreachable places for Mum.\n\nThe foyer of the salon was decorated with brightly coloured roses, yellows, reds and pinks. I imagined the colours to be the same as the wings of the butterflies in my stomach.\n\nI held Mum’s hand; although I was scared, I didn’t hold her hand for me. I held it for her; this was the biggest moment for her that she had had to face. The thing that would make it really real for her.\n\nMum smiled at me in the mirror as we sat side-by-side and made herself more comfortable, adjusting the head back seat so it wouldn’t put pressure on her thorax.\n\nYou okay? She mouthed. I nodded.\n\nYou? She smiled.\n\n“Right then, Mrs Bruce-Jones,” Derek, Mum’s hairdresser, said, but there wasn’t a hint of formality in it. Mum had that effect; instantly you felt comfortable in her presence, and she’d been with Derek long enough that they considered each other as friends. Everyone always says to me that Mum lit up every room; she was the sun that every person orbited, a light to an array of moths. “What are we doing today then?”\n\nAs Mum explained, I didn’t see a hint of pity in Derek’s face; not out of spite, but just because she was his friend and he didn’t see her any differently.\n\n“As fond as I am of the ratty mullet, I think we can do something about it, can’t we.” He had said, his fingers played gently with the wisps hanging at the nape of her neck contemplatively before explaining his thoughts to her.\n\nWhen my own hairdresser appeared, she manoeuvred me to the wash basins, chatting away. They gave me towels to sit on as I was too small for the adult chairs.\n\nMum joined me shortly and we sat side by side as suds fell down our ears, Mum quickly so that she wouldn’t be leaning back for too long, letting ourselves relax to the knead of hands on our scalps.\n\nMy trance was broken when Mum was taken over to the seats again and I watched the ratty mullet bound away. Slowly.\n\nWhen I joined Mum, the front half was already shaved I watched Mum in the mirror, seeing the remainder of hair fall away, always thinking of when we’d be sat here again, Mum’s hair grown back again, needing to be taken care of to get back to her sunny, glorious blonde hair.\n\nMy heart saddened slightly as I saw the scars of chemo being shaven away, but, as my own hair was chopped two inches, it didn’t make a huge difference. It was just tidier.\n\nThe little ratty mullet was gone, replaced with a buzz, little tufts covering her head like sprouts of grass.\n\nWhen we were finished, we both grinned gloriously at the results.\n\nThe reception area, full of the roses, seemed brighter as we paid.\n\nWe walked out, arms linked, her head held high.\n\nShe didn’t wear her hat.\n\nAs Winter settles a dark blanket over Edinburgh and twinkling lights begin to grow outside houses as we drive by, I think of the time Mum forgot to collect me from Grange hockey club. It was Mum’s turn to pick me and my friend, Jess, up, but she never appeared.\n\nWhen I had finally gotten home after a lot of confusion, Mum had been lying on the sofa. When she saw me, she apologised profusely through half-closed eyes.\n\n“I’m so sorry, Lizy. Trish was meant to wake me up.” There was no way I would’ve been angry at her, and I sat on the floor next to the sofa where she lay while stroking my hair.\n\n“I think I’d better go to bed; I’m knackered!” she had said, and slowly eased herself off the sofa and we headed upstairs. I shouted goodnight to Trish who was making a cup of tea in the kitchen.\n\nI headed into Mum’s room to go and say goodnight. She was just swallowing some pills (there were too many to remember the names) and gave her a big hug.\n\nBut she jerked back from me, hand springing over mouth, clamped, as she retched and hurried into the bathroom, goo oozing out of her fingers.\n\n“Mum? Mum? Are you okay?” I had asked worriedly, right behind her. She was spitting into the sink. I shouted down to Trish, grabbing a glass of water, grabbing tissues, grabbing cardboard-like pots for her to guzzle and spit into whilst rubbing her back and muttering soothing words as her eyes watered with the gagging motion and tears streamed down her face as she tried to regain her breath and not be sick again.\n\n“I’m so sorry, Lizey.” She said, giving me hug. “Sorry you had to see that.”\n\nI told her not to be silly, for I always apologised for being sick in the night.\n\nIt was a rough night, that night; even home couldn’t protect us.\n\nWhen we pull into the drive at home, I run upstairs, immediately grabbing my special teddys, my two little polar bears, who make my arms feel empty at night when they’re absent. We pick up clothes, toothbrushes, hairbrushes, drawing pads and pens, Christmas paper chains (which I hadn’t made for years). I give Tokai, our Vizsla, a huggle and she licks my cheek tenderly, putting one long paw onto my arm.\n\nOn the way out I see my pendant necklace Mum had given me for Christmas that year; our final one. It’s a silver circle with a small heart on it, ‘I love you more’ engraved in it.\n\n“I couldn’t find one with ‘I love you most’ on it’.” She had said. It was our thing before going to bed;\n\n“Love you,” I would say.\n\n“Love you more,” She would say.\n\n“Love you most,” I would say, giggling at this point.\n\n“Not possible!” She would call as I walked out the door.\n\n“Yes it is because I do!” I would shout back.\n\nI grab it and hold it tightly in my fist.\n\nOn the way back to the hospice, we stop off at my school to pick up my Zovirax from the changing rooms because I have a bad cold sore.\n\nI desperately want to see Claudia, my friend, and tell her what was happening. I continuously contemplate texting her She’s going to die., so that she will know and I’ll have someone to talk to about it.\n\nSeeing school reminds me of a Science lesson in September. My teacher had warned me that we were having a lesson on Cancer, and that I could leave any time I wanted. When he had started the video, I asked to go to the loo. He looked at me sympathetically and nodded.\n\nI went to the loo, washed and dried my hands.\n\nI walked back in, interested in the video and the research.\n\nI didn’t leave because of the video; I was absolutely fine.\n\nI just needed a pee.\n\nI climb back into the car, although I’m slightly reluctant to leave the familiarity of home. We drive through town back to Leith to the hospice, past Fettes, Inverleith, Comely Bank (where we used to live; I stare longingly at the front door), past Edinburgh Academy and the sports’ pitches where boys are kicking rugby balls around.\n\nWhen we arrive, we sign back in at the reception, walking past the glass corridor and the yummy café. Up the elevator we go. We drop our things off in the family room and go to see everyone.\n\nWe hear voices in the TV room, so we peak our heads round the door to see Uncle Mark and Granny Rosemary chatting, accompanying Granny Maggles asleep in just her knickers and a long-sleeved white top; it’s all she seems to wear here! She doesn’t seem to care that there is another family who also duck in and out of the room. We giggle and close the door gently.\n\nWhen Auntie Caroline and I walk into Mum’s room, Dad looks tired so I tell him to go and have a sandwich and some sleep which he gratefully accepts when I promise to wake him if anything were to happen.\n\nCharlie and I are left in the room alone with Mum. We speak of the future and the past; even though she cannot talk, I know she’s listening and that she’s loving our presence.\n\nCharlie says, (because I’m Head Girl at school), “and Eliza will be head girl at senior school”, which I scoff to.\n\n“Nah, Charlie you’ll be head boy!” I reply, and Mum seems to snort too, kindly, making a noise that sounds like a laugh so we giggle at the silliness of it all, even if Mum won’t be there to see it. (Safe to say, Charlie wasn’t head boy…)\n\nAt night, the first of December makes the sky darker and gloomier, but in the day time the crisp, warm air is a lovely wisp in the morning as we stand on Mum’s balcony, absorbing the December sun, and look at the beautiful shadows the leafless trees make, and how the frost glistens and shimmers like precious and rare diamonds that, by the end of the day, would soon melt away into the grass.\n\nThat night, because day and night merge into one, I wander down to the café where we got a sandwich or salad or chomp on a rouge apple. After, I sit with Mum and talk to her or sit with Dad and draw; together we think of memorials for Mum to have her with us always, and I draw multiple sundials with my silver pen which we all love. Sometimes I make some Christmas chains, but they either rip or I become too bored and only manage five or six links; I can’t sort the chain out without Mum. Sometimes I wander into the TV room and watch “I’m a Celebrity: Get me out of here!”.\n\nDad doesn’t leave Mum’s side, sitting next to her without fail; they are destined together, so when, two years or so later, Ariel, my best friend, told me of how, when herself and Anna, her Mum, often spoke of Mum, Anna bore stories of dinner parties:\n\n“No other couple bounced off each other like they did; never any arguments, never any insecurities, never any jealousy, not even a sliver.” she had said. “They were soulmates; hard, evident proof that they do exist.”\n\nWhen they told me this, I thought of two days ago; I was sitting with Mum at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, before she was moved to St Columba’s, quite unsure what to say, when suddenly she started thrashing about, shouting, “I need loo! Let me go loo!” so I ran out to the nurses’ and told them, stuttering in a breath, “Excuse me, I think my Mum needs the loo, she’s trying to go and she’s ripping out her tubes.” and the nurse walked off and I stood there worried and thinking please hurry; this is my Mum.\n\nThey were so oddly calm about it that it was unnerving. I didn’t want to think it, but I knew that if this was the end, then a small part of me would hold that nurse accountable.\n\nI went in again so Mum wasn’t alone as she ripped her wires. This was it. She wasn’t meant to get up because of her broken hip, but then again, she wasn’t supposed to have broken the hip, or be there, or have cancer.\n\nFinally, the nurse burst in, busying herself with the bedpan and calling other nurses and then Dad came back and was in the room and I didn’t feel like breathing, ironically when that was Mum’s one job right now and she couldn’t, and my cheeks were hot and red and my head was dizzy and I wanted to cry but I saw Dad and knew I had to stay strong and Dad bent over her head and stroked her hair and she stopped whimpering and wriggling and seemed to just lay in his arms while the nurses did their job and there they were, my Mum and Dad together just being, while he whispered “Stop, sweetheart, you can’t get up. I love you, I’m here.” over and over and over again. And then she was almost alright again, except our ‘alright’ was far from everyone else’s alright.\n\nWhen there isn’t anything good on TV, I go and sit with Mum, hugging her and holding her hand as the oxygen mask wheezes and her eyes droop heavily. I hold her hand, kiss her head and whisper goodbyes in her ear. Hardly sleeping, I lie in a small ball on a beanbag, my neck cramping. Mum’s breath is short and ragged and groaning, an uneven lullaby for us as we drift in and out of dozing and dreariness.\n\nI really struggle to be in there. It isn’t that I don’t want to be there, obviously, but I find it difficult to watch, like someone forcing themselves to watch a war film when they hated blood.\n\nWhen I am alone, I just don’t know what to say. I tell her I love her, I tell her she is the best Mum, that she is brave, that I will never forget her. Tears prick my eyes as I recite quietly, my voice sounding strange:\n\nMay the road rise to meet you, May the wind be ever at your back, May the sun shine warm upon your face, And, until we meet again, may God hold you in the palm of his hand.\n\nI wonder, when I fell short of words, whether she is disappointed that that is all I have to say to her.\n\nOn Friday, the 2nd, I sit and laugh and mourn and kiss her and hold her hand and whisper in her ear and stroke her tender, sweaty, bald head. Guiltily, I want to escape once again and go home, but there’s nothing we need and so my service in that perspective isn’t necessary.\n\nI look out the window at the sun which smiles gloriously into our room, refracting off the light of the balcony outside Mum’s door. I know our story is a doomed fate, and yet the sun made me hope for a miracle. I pray meaningfully for one of the last times in my life.\n\nAnd then the sun goes behind a cloud, leaving menacing shadows to flit across the room. Coward.\n\nFriday evening means fish, chips, jelly and ice cream for supper which our favourite nurse, Craig, brings for Charlie and me. We eat quickly, regularly going into Mum’s room to check on her before retreating into the TV room to watch the final of ‘I’m A Celebrity’.\n\nI sit and wait.\n\nI watch Scarlet win.\n\nAt 22:28, Dad comes into the room.\n\nHe bends over with his hands on his knees.\n\nHe holds his breath.\n\nHis shoulders shake in defeat.\n\nHis eyes, which stare at the ground, turn black like oblivion.\n\nAnd then he says two words that change my life.\n\n“She’s gone.”\n\nFuck you, Cancer.\n\nToday (Sunday 4th October) would have been the 100th birthday of Sir Thomas Macpherson, an old boy of Cargilfield and Fettes College.\n\nColonel Sir Ronald Thomas Stewart Macpherson CBE, MC & Two Bars, TD, DL (4 October 1920 – 6 November 2014) was a highly decorated Scottish British Army officer during and after the Second World War. He fought with the No. 11 Commando unit and French Resistance forces, becoming infamous among Axis forces as the “Kilted Killer”. He caused so much damage to enemy military infrastructure, a bounty of 300,000 francs was placed upon his head. He was awarded the Military Cross and the Croix de Guerre three times, and the Légion d’honneur.\n\nBelow is his obituary from The Times published on his death in 2014.\n\nSerial escape attempts, remarkable bluffing tactics, and sheer bravery behind enemy lines made Sir Thomas Macpherson one of Britain’s most decorated veterans of the Second World War. In addition to his three Military Crosses and three Croix de Guerre, the Pope personally awarded him the Star of Bethlehem and a papal knighthood.\n\nAs a young wartime commando, Macpherson took part in the ill-fated operation to kill General Erwin Rommel immediately before the Eighth Army’s “Crusader” offensive in November 1941. Two parties landed in rubber boats from the RN submarines Torbay and Talisman to make the 18-mile night approach march in pouring rain to the villa at Beda Littoria (Libya). Subsequent intelligence, however, was to prove that Rommel had never used the place. Many of the commandos were killed and the rest taken prisoner. Among them was Macpherson, who had been commissioned into the Queen’s Own Cameron Highlanders. The adventures that followed were nothing short of swashbuckling. While held in a prison camp near Genoa, Macpherson would not allow his spirit to be broken and took advantage of incarceration by becoming fluent in Italian. In 1943, when Italy surrendered, he and his fellow PoWs were loaded on to a train by the Germans to be moved to a different camp. Seizing his moment, he tried to flee but was swiftly caught by a guard who marched him back to the station — and vented his anger by emptying his rifle in single shots between Macpherson’s feet. Then forced to stand against a wall, he was about to be shot when another officer ordered the guard not to kill him.\n\nDespite a number of failed attempts to escape — including one from a transit camp in Spittal when he tried to slip away amid a party of agricultural workers — he did not despair. He eventually escaped from Stalag XXA at Thorn on the Vistula, in occupied Poland, after crawling under two perimeter fences and dodging the searchlights. He made his way back to England via Sweden, having been smuggled on to a Baltic collier at Gdynia by some friendly Poles. On board he narrowly escaped detection by customs officials by climbing down into the hold. Back home, he was recruited by the Special Operations Executive to be dropped into occupied France at the time of the Normandy invasion. Formed into three-man teams codenamed “Jedburghs”, their mission was to make contact with the French Resistance movements, arm them where necessary and encourage them to engage in sabotage helpful to the Allies’ campaign to liberate France.\n\nThe Jedburgh team of which Major Macpherson was in charge, codenamed “Quinine”, was flown from Blida in Algiers and dropped near Aurillac, in the Cantal department, on the night of June 8, 1944. Accompanied by Aspirant (officer cadet) Prince Michel de Bourbon of the French Army and Sergeant Arthur Brown of the Royal Tank Regiment, Macpherson — a proud Scot — wore his kilt for the occasion. The attire caused some confusion and the first report to reach the local maquisards claimed “a French officer has arrived with his wife”.\n\nIn order to swell partisan numbers, Macpherson drove around in a car — still wearing his Cameron Highlander tartans — openly flying the Union Flag pennant and the Croix de Lorraine, much to the astonishment of his comrades. After establishing contact with the Gaullist FFI (Forces Françaises de l’Intérieur), he urged them to disrupt railway lines and to destroy a number of locomotives at Capdenac. Attempts were made to trap Macpherson and it was said that a 300,000 franc price was put on his head.\n\nHe became known for leading large-scale guerrilla operations — including one against the Das Reich Panzer division shortly after his arrival in France. Macpherson and the “Jeds” demolished a bridge the Germans were hoping to cross, and defended another for six days against their attacks. He turned his attention to the communist FTP (Francs-tireurs et partisans) who, at his suggestion, stole two Citroën cars from the Vichy-French police to enhance their tactical mobility. Macpherson later moved Quinine to Toulouse and became part of a French Resistance force known as the Groupement Mobile du Sud Ouest, which moved north of Clermont- Ferrand.\n\nWhether through bravery or chutzpah, Macpherson won the surrender of 23,000 Wehrmacht troops by spouting a series of brazen lies. He presented himself to the commanding officer, Major-General Botho Elster, and assured him that heavy artillery, 20,000 troops and RAF bombers were waiting for Macpherson’s word to attack. In reality he had only the aid of another Jedburgh team. Surrender or die, he urged Elster; the bluff worked. Elster and his troops eventually passed into US Army captivity.\n\nAfter Macpherson was withdrawn from France in October 1944, he was sent to work with the partisans in northeastern Italy, where he helped to unify bickering groups and led a successful raid on a marshalling yard in Udine.For his exploits in France in 1944, he was awarded a bar to the MC he had received for escaping from the Stalag XXA camp and evading the Germans in 1943; and a second bar came in 1945 for his service in Italy. He was also appointed a Chevalier of the French Legion of Honour and awarded the Croix de Guerre with two palms, the Italian Medaglia d’Argento and the Resistance Medal.\n\nRonald Thomas Stewart Macpherson, known as Tommy, was born in Edinburgh in 1920, the fifth son of Sir Thomas Stewart Macpherson. He was a small and sickly child who suffered from osteomyelitis, a debilitating infection of the bone marrow that left him confined to his bed for several months. During that time he read voraciously, finishing a book every two days; Robert Louis Stevenson’s Alan Breck became his childhood hero.\n\nOnce recovered, he gained a reputation at Fettes College as a talented sportsman. On the rugby pitch he took after his older brother, the renowned rugby union player GPS “Phil” Macpherson. After demobilisation he headed to Trinity College, Oxford, where he continued to excel on the pitch and read a First in PPE. Aside from intellectual jousting with his tutorial partner, the future Labour minister Tony Crosland, Macpherson won an athletics Blue and could even boast a rare victory over Roger Bannister. He also competed as an international student athlete against Emil Zatopek in the World Student Games.\n\nOxford eased him back into civilian life — “Our life was finished, and then it started again”. For nearly 30 years he worked for the timber company William Mallinson & Sons, where he started as a personal assistant to the chairman and finished as managing director.\n\nBefore being appointed CBE (Military Division) in 1968, he commanded 1st Battalion the London Scottish TA (1961-64) and was Colonel TA London District (1964-67). He was knighted for services to commerce and industry in 1992.\n\nTogether with his wife Jean (née Butler Wilson), whom he married in 1953, he divided his time between homes in London — where he travelled everywhere on foot — and the family seat, Biallid House, in Newtonmore, Inverness-shire. Lady Macpherson survives him, with their two sons and daughter: Duncan is a barrister; Angus is managing director of\n\nthe Environment Exchange; and Ishbel is non-executive chairman and director of several companies. As children they recall their father beginning every day with a cold bath and an hour of exercise.\n\nAside from his love of fishing, shooting and languages, he served for 40 years as president of the Achilles Club (for Oxbridge athletes). He resigned after a stroke.\n\nHis passion for the outdoors never waned and he insisted on going for walks twice a day, even in ailing health, regardless of whether it was raining or snowing. Though an animated raconteur he rarely spoke of his wartime experiences until his eighties. He published an autobiography, Behind Enemy Lines, in 2010. Once asked to name his proudest moment, he pondered and said: “It’s very often that one remembers the small things and forgets the big ones.”\n\nSir Thomas Macpherson, CBE, MC and two bars, soldier and businessman, was born on October 4, 1920. He died on November 6, 2014, aged 94"
