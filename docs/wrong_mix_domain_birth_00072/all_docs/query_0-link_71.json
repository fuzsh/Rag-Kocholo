        "text": "Welcome to my site.\n\nMy name is Leo, but I write under my first two given names, Leo Anthony. I am the progeny of a Cypriot-Greek father and Anglo-Irish mother, both of whom were born and raised in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe).\n\nI was born in the UK shortly before the conclusion of the Rhodesian Bush War. Once that had been realised I was whisked away to a newly independent nation, Zimbabwe, where I spent the better part of the next thirty years of my life. You can learn about my childhood in Zimbabwe and some memorable family holidays.\n\nSince 2009 I have lived in several places in the UK, chief amongst them London, Luton and Bournemouth. I travelled widely in the years 2015 and 2016 to places as diverse as France, Turkey, Algeria and South Africa before settling down as a member of an intentional community on the south bank of the River Rhine near the Dutch town of Millingen-aan-de-Rijn with my family.\n\nI now live in a shared house on the German side of the border, not far from the intentional community, but living a regular life as a tax-paying citizen! There have been one or two family adventures chronicled on this blog: staying in the Avalon Community in Italy and a visit to Northern Greece.\n\nI have two self-published book, Between Two Worlds: The Life of a Jet-Setting Vagrant, (see below) and Revisiting South Africa. Both are based on my personal travel experiences.\n\nYou can find my eBook and paperback versions of these two titles on all major platforms by following either of these links (Previews available on Amazon product pages):\n\nAmazon or\n\nOther major online retailers\n\nTo sign up for book updates please consider join my mailing list. You can opt out any time.\n\nPlease feel free to peruse my posts and leave any feedback you feel inclined to share."
