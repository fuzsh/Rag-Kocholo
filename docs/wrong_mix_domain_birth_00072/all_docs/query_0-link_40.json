After you accept an offer to study at Deakin, the agent can also assist you with your visa application.\n\nIt is important that you only work with Deakin authorised agents. These agents are subject to a rigorous application process and ongoing monitoring by the University. They have a signed agreement with Deakin University. We keep them up-to-date about what is happening at Deakin.\n\nDeakin strongly recommends you use the support of a Deakin authorised agent. Their assistance can make the process much easier, particularly when you are applying for your student visa.\n\nStudents applying from certain countries are required to submit their application through a Deakin authorised agent. These countries include:\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs requires all student visa applications to be lodged online. The online visa application process is lengthy and complex. An authorised agent will be able to assist you with this process. Deakin strongly recommends that you seek the support of a registered agent to ensure your online visa application is submitted correctly. The Department of Home Affairs is not obligated to seek additional information from applicants who fail to submit all required documents at the time of application lodgement. If you fail to complete the online visa application correctly, you may receive a visa refusal."
