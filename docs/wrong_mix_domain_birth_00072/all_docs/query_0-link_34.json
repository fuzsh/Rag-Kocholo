        "text": "The question that I have been asked most frequently is ‘What is it like judging a prize?’ The answer is: it is a privilege but also emotionally taxing. You want to honour the hard work and creativity that went into the writing of each short story. Ten stories in (there were 230 stories eligible), you realise, with heartbreaking clarity, that there will be far, far more worthy stories than there are finalist slots. [It is here that I found Petina Gappah’s essay particularly helpful. Dear Tete Petina: I Am Not on the Caine Prize Shortlist | By Petina Gappah (brittlepaper.com) I – we – could not magic up more finalist places, much as we would have liked to.] How does one choose between them?\n\nAt an early panel meeting, I had asked my fellow judges what they looked for in a short story – they were, after all, published writers of some renown. The answers were: ‘Well, I like a story to have a good ending’; ‘I think a story should have a good hook’; ‘I really like it when the author feels free to intersperse words from their mother tongue – it feels more natural’; ‘I don’t know – I just have to really like it. It has to grip me from beginning to end, to surprise me; and ending with, ‘I will know when I find “the one”.’ Reader, I am trying to tell you that there is no science to this. It is about what gives one ‘the feels’. In my case, it was also about thinking about a broader audience beyond the literary elite who edit or read literary magazines. Literature, in my opinion must be accessible to all – not just materially, but also in terms of comprehensibility and contextual legibility. My 77-year-old mother’s favourite book is Mariama Bâ’s So Long a Letter. It is not a complex book, but it is a universal story, well told. It has resonated across generations and through decades. It is rightly considered to be a classic. In judging, I was cognisant too, that tastes and literary styles differ. There had, in my view, to be something for everyone. More challenging for me was that there were so many themes that were explored with beauty and insight.\n\nThemes\n\nThe breadth came in the themes covered. It was not surprising that COVID came up as did stories on migration – both transnational and within borders. Stories about love between two people of the same gender were submitted. Powerful were the environmental apocalypse stories. Sympathetically realised were stories about albinism. One or two I read as political allegories. Exquisite in its gentle quietness, was a story about the life of a petrol attendant. Charming was the story written as if it were an entry in a non-fiction science book. Stunning was the use of architecture and the construction of homes to explore domestic violence. There were dystopian stories about medical experimentation. I liked that there were stories set in both urban and rural areas and in different historical periods. Some intercut histories of resistance and survival – African with African American – to great effect. We were moved by the stories of ordinary people doing their best to get by – the widowed mother in the refugee camp and the young men hustling on the streets of Lagos. I liked that the stories reflected the whole lifecycle – from birth to old age. There were morality tales with a sting (don’t dump your university love for escort work – you’ll regret it, was one). There were others. The exploration of masculinity was fresh. Food was a theme – not least in stories from Nigeria. I have enjoyed gallons of egusi soup and look forward to more snails. Music resonated through some stories, in the rhythm of the writing as well in the naming of artists and tunes.\n\nWere there any that we did not like? Well, I grew weary of paw paw-coloured skin which, more often than not, seemed to have an association with beauty. The colourism did not sit well with me. I was not keen on the misogyny on display in a couple of stories, especially as the stories were not well told making it an endurance without reward. Yes, judges being human, have biases too. There were stories that could and should have been better edited – spelling mistakes in the first line do not bode well. Those of my fellow judges who had read one or two stories in their original form felt that some of the translations did not do the original justice. One or two of the longer-form stories (between seven to nine thousand words) read as if they were chapters culled from a novel in progress and sent in. The writing was good but one had the sense that reading the extract in context would have been a more rewarding experience.\n\nSo, how does one decide?\n\nThe answer is – with great difficulty. Judges received an Excel sheet with links to the stories. The Excel sheet was numbered from AA001 to AA230. I started at the top but would print stories from the bottom to read when my eyes grew tired of reading online or when I was travelling and not sure of the internet connection. One had to grade the stories from 1-5. In addition, I had an A4-size notebook labelled ‘Caine Prize’. I wrote a short summary of each submission on the Excel sheet and reasons for its grade, while my notebook was a conversation with myself and my response after reading each story. On the spreadsheet, I marked out those that I thought were definite contenders by using bold text, those that were maybe were italicised. This was supposed to help to whittle the list down, but I ended up with over 30 stories. Re-reading did not lead to cutting out many. I tried refining by themes but there were inter-theme ties or stand-offs. It felt like a cacophony of ‘pick me’ ‘pick me!’ in my head. My family grew tired of my lengthy discourses about the relative merits of stories that they had not read, finally observing that I seemed to like so many, in other words, please – enough!\n\nAt the end, we were told to submit our five finalists. Our pleas for a longlist of ten fell on deaf ears. Clearly, the organisers have heard the special pleading before. I tried to cheat by having a tie. Our choices were put on a spreadsheet and then the discussion began. It took close to four hours and multiple rounds of voting and discussion. We all lost at least one story that we loved – most of us, more than one. I am a human rights lawyer and the process reminded me of how human rights treaties are drafted – they go through multiple discussions and negotiations and what emerges is what can be agreed on.\n\nLuckily, ours was a happy, supportive, thoughtful and truly wonderful family to be a part of. Our emails including: ‘I think I found the one!’ to, ‘I’m still looking’ to wondering about the advantages of polyamory (the love of many) were always bountiful in their kindness, humour and determination to do our best by the people who had honoured us with their submissions.\n\nWill everyone agree with our choices? No. As I have said, we all have ‘the one that got away’. That makes at least five – meaning this could easily have been a different shortlist. For those who submitted in 2023 – a deep, heartfelt thank you. I have made note of so many stories that I will read again, use in my teaching and writing or share with others. You have enriched our lives and we thank you. Please keep writing – your work is important. Thank you too to the editors whose work, though unseen, is central to the production of the stories that are submitted. Thanks are also due to the publishers, for submitting the stories, and indeed, for providing them a home to begin with. Aluta!\n\nFareda Banda, Chair of Judges (2023)\n\nJonty Driver, who has died aged 83, was in every way a large and impressive presence on the Advisory Council of The Caine Prize, joining it at its inception and only resigning from it in 2020. Jonty was a big man physically: this was always the first thing anybody said about him when they first met him. Within a short while, however, they would be saying he was a big man morally. He was never afraid to speak his mind, even when he felt that the balance of opinion might be going against him.\n\nJonty had the right background for speaking up, having served in 1963 and 1964 as president of the National Union of South African Students. It is hard to recall for those who were not alive at the peak of apartheid how exposed a position this was. Jonty felt that his responsibilities lay to all students, not just those like himself who were white and from a relatively privileged background. Inevitably he aroused suspicion in the paranoic world of the South African government and its spying agencies. He was arrested and spent several weeks in solitary confinement. Never formally charged, he decided on release to leave South Africa and to come to England. The metaphorical scars of what he had been through, and what he had seen among deprived communities in black South Africa, never left him. Even in old age he felt, by his association with The Caine Prize and with the Beit Trust, that he was paying something back to the continent and to the country which had nurtured him at the expense of so many millions less advantaged.\n\nHe was a literary man through and through. His novel Elegy for a Revolutionary came out in 1969 and is still regarded as a classic exposition of the liberal dilemmas of the day. Is armed conflict justified in opposing a tyrannous regime? Jonty was the author of five novels in all and went on to write two biographies of South African dissenters, Patrick Duncan and John Harris.\n\nI suspect, however, that he wanted most of all to be remembered as a poet. His collections So Far and Still Further bring together most of his major poems written between 1960 and 2020. They are various in subject, some personal, some public, but always they seem to me to be pressing against the forms that poetry can take, as though he wanted to mould new shapes and possibilities for the art itself. He was a great believer in the pamphlet poem, such as The Slave-Bell at Doornhoek, which he accompanied with a water colour, ‘a painting and a poem’. It was from this late work that I quoted at our most recent Council meeting:\n\n‘The names we gave the places where we lived\n\n(not all that long ago) are changing now,\n\nto what they might have been before we came,\n\nor what we might have wished they would have been\n\nif we had never settled here. How vain\n\nthat we should think we could repair the past\n\nor give that bell another, better voice.’\n\nJonty was a paradoxical man. A revolutionary, yet a conservative. A man horrified by injustices perpetrated by his own class and breed, yet the successful headmaster of three independent schools - Berkhamsted School and Wellington College in England, and the Island School in Hong Kong – which some people might say exist to perpetuate these élites. He was above all an immensely kind man. On several occasions my wife and I visited Jonty and his wife Ann at their serene bookish home in east Sussex. They were a model couple in the manner in which they faced some of the debilities of old age. Jonty did most of the cooking because he loved to do so. Anything he embarked on he did with the utmost fastidiousness. The result was, for example, a perfect salmon mousse, the recipe for which I shall always treasure. He was a rounded ‘man o’ pairts’, as we say in Scotland.\n\nAnd coming back to the Caine Prize, he was always wise and judicious in his counsel. He valued the Prize because it recognises so many voices that might otherwise remain unheard. It also allowed him to stay connected with the African literary world, in which he had played a major role. His sister’s partner is J. M. Coetzee. If I had such a formidable Nobel laureate in my family I would be anxious about anything I wrote, but Jonty was uncowed. In his way he was no lesser a writer and, like Coetzee, he was one of the greatest sons of modern South Africa. The Caine Prize should be proud of its links with him and must pass to his widow our sorrow at his passing.\n\nAlastair Niven, London, August 2023\n\nThe name of Ama Ata Aidoo deserves to feature high on any list of influential Anglophone African writers, particularly notable for giving a perspective on women to be found nowhere else. She made her mark not only as an author – with plays, novels, short stories, poetry and essays – but also as a politician, an academic and an activist. Holding strong Pan-Africanist views, she was fearlessly outspoken about the centuries of exploitation of Africa's resources and peoples (as can be heard in a video clip about imperialism that went viral), and always made it clear that she learned her first feminist lessons in Africa.\n\nBorn in 1940, Christina Ama Ata Aidoo began the trajectory that launched her literary life in a Fante village in the Central Region of what was then the Gold Coast, where she was born to Maame Elizabeth Aba Abasema Bosu and Nana Manu III – also known as Nana Yaw Fama, chief of Abeadzi Kyiakor. Ama Ata was her mother’s first child, though she had many older siblings from her father’s other wives. She grew up in her father’s royal household, shaped by the stimulus of interactions between family as well as those who came to the chief with local issues.\n\nHer father built the village’s first school, which she began attending in 1946. She went on to win a scholarship at 14 to the prestigious Wesley Girls High School in Cape Coast in 1957. During this time, her love of reading and writing was nurtured, leading in 1958 to her receiving first prize for a story in a Daily Graphic competition. Completing her A-levels in 1960, she was admitted the next year to the University of Ghana, Legon, studying for a BA degree in English, while simultaneously demonstrating her creative skill at whatever writing genre she attempted. In 1962, she won an Mbari Club short-story competition with her entry “No Sweetness Here”, and poetry prizes, too, came her way.\n\nWhile still an undergraduate, Aidoo wrote her first play, The Dilemma of a Ghost, premiered in 1964 at the Open-Air Theatre, and in 1965 published by Longman – an achievement marking her out as the first published female African dramatist. She joined the Institute of African Studies for two years, until 1966, benefiting from the mentorship of literary pioneer Efua Sutherland. Then, as the winner of a creative writing fellowship, Ama Ata went to Stanford University in California. A spell in the UK followed, freelancing in broadcasting and journalism, and travels took her elsewhere in Europe and on the African continent, including Tanzania and Kenya, where her daughter Kinna was born in Nairobi, with 1969 also bringing a return to Ghana.\n\nIn 1970 came her second play, Anowa, and the short-story collection No Sweetness Here. A rising academic career took her to the Department of English at the University of Cape Coast, where she became a professor, participating in many international seminars and educational initiatives. Her witty and unconventional debut novel Our Sister Killjoy: or Reflections from a Black-eyed Squint was published in 1977.\n\nShe was appointed Secretary for Education in Ghana in 1982 under the PNDC administration of Jerry Rawlings, but resigned after 18 months, realizing that she would be unable to achieve her aim of making education in Ghana freely accessible to all.\n\nIn 1983, she moved to live in Zimbabwe, continuing her work in education, alongside her writing. While in Harare, she published a collection of poems in 1985, Someone Talking to Sometime, and wrote a children's book entitled The Eagle and the Chickens and Other Stories (1986). From the late 1980s, she was again in the US, including a spell as writer-in-residence at the University of Richmond, Virginia, in 1989. In 1991, she and poet Jayne Cortez founded and co-chaired the Organization of Women Writers of Africa.\n\nIn 1992, Ama Ata won the Commonwealth Writers' Prize with her remarkable novel Changes, and she turned again to poetry with her collection An Angry Letter in January; that same year, I was delighted to include her story \"Two Sisters\" in my anthology Daughters of Africa. (An anthologist in her own right, she edited 2006’s African Love Stories, published by Ayebia Books.) Ama Ata Aidoo’s commitment to promoting and supporting the literary work of African women was demonstrated again by her establishment of the Mbaasem Foundation in Ghana in 2000.\n\nAligned with the principled life choices she made, and the stalwart beliefs framed by her own experiences, she portrayed in her works memorable women who defied stereotypes in empowering and inspirational ways, negotiating, examining and exploring the intersections of Western and African worldviews.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2011, Ama Ata was a visiting professor in the Africana Studies Department at Brown University. She chaired the Ghana Association of Writers Book Festival from its inception in 2011. In 2012, she published Diplomatic Pounds & Other Stories, a compilation of short stories. Somehow, she found time, year in and year out, to support ventures she deemed worthy, such as the Etisalat Prize for Literature, created in 2013 as a platform for African writers of debut novels of fiction.\n\nHer genuine humility was never affected by the many accolades she received, including the 2012 volume Essays in honour of Ama Ata Aidoo at 70 (edited by Anne V. Adams, with a stellar list of contributors, among them: Atukwei Okai, Maryse Condé, Micere Mugo, Toyin Falola, Biodun Jeyifo, Kofi Anyidoho, Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang, Naana Banyiwa Horne, Nana Wilson-Tagoe, Carole Boyce Davies, Emmanuel Akyeampong, James Gibbs, Vincent O. Odamtten, Jane Bryce, Esi Sutherland-Addy, Femi Osofisan, Kwesi Yankah, Abena Busia, Yaba Badoe, Ivor Agyeman-Duah, Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi, Ngugi Wa Thiong'o, and Kinna Likimani), and being the subject of a fascinating 2014 documentary film by Yaba Badoe, The Art of Ama Ata Aidoo. In March 2017, the Ama Ata Aidoo Centre for Creative Writing (Aidoo Centre) was launched in Accra (Nii Parkes was its inaugural director), furthering her legacy.\n\nHaving already lived a full life defined from its earliest by so much creativity, versatility, integrity and generosity, Ama Ata had even more in mind that she had hoped to give us – including finalising a new novel she told me she had been working on for 18 years. Her death on 31 May 2023 came as a shock, an irreparable loss to family and friends, to everyone fortunate enough to have known her personally. The only mitigation is that her extraordinary talent, tenacity of spirit and the perceptiveness that shines through her writing will live on, sustaining us all into a more optimistic future.\n\nMargaret Busby, London, August 2023"
