Guglielmo Marconi was an Italian engineer and inventor who successfully demonstrated the working of long-distance wireless telegraph and radio signal. This Nobel-prize winner was born into a wealthy and educated family, and was first educated in Bologna and Florence, later moving to a technical school in Leghorn. As a boy he was impressed by the works of Hertz, Maxwell and Lodge. He began experimenting in his fatherâ€™s estate and was successful in sending wireless signals over short distances, greater than a mile. He took his machine to England where his invention was received with enthusiasm. One of the interested parties was British Post Office. Within a year, his successful endeavour of broadcasting to 12 miles, Marconi applied for his first patent. Determined to establish that wireless waves were not influenced by the curves of Earth, he transmitted his historic wireless signals across the Atlantic. The claims of his transatlantic signal were however never quite verified. Marconi continuously explored the various possibilities of the usage of radio waves beyond the spectrum of telecommunications. His experimentation resulted in discovering the use of microwave in physical therapy. Guglielmo, as an entrepreneur was quite conservative when it came to patents, as he never disclosed the full design until the patent was given to him, allowing him to realize the full monetary benefit
