        "text": "Jacqueline Hochheiser, Corporate Communications\n\nThe concept of the phased array antenna system was first put into practice by German Physicist Ferdinand Braun and his assistants in the spring of 1905. This invention led to the development of radar, smart antennas, and MIMO. Though his career was mainly spent as an educator of physics in various university appointments, he was also an avid inventor and was even a co-winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1909 for his contributions toward the development of wireless telegraphy.\n\nEarly Life & Career\n\nBraun was born on June 6, 1850 at Fulda, Germany, where he was educated at the local “Gymnasium,” or grammar school. He then went on to attend the University of Marburg and earned his PhD from the University of Berlin. He graduated in 1872 with a completed paper on the oscillations of elastic strings, which would serve as the catalyst for his later inventions.\n\nIn 1874, Braun attained his first position as an assistant to a professor of physics at the Wurzburg University. Over the course of his life, Braun held various teaching positions including Extraordinary Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Marburg in 1876. In 1885, Braun was invited to the University of Tubingen for a role as the professor of physics, and was also tasked with building a new physics institute. It was here that he stayed for the remainder of his professional career, and the institute allowed him access to a laboratory for his work as an independent inventor.\n\nExperimentation & Invention\n\nBraun’s first investigations pursued the oscillations of strings and elastic rods in regard to the influence of amplitude and environment on the rods during their oscillations. But perhaps his most important work was done in the field of electricity. He discovered the rectification effect that a point-contact, metal-semiconductor junction has on alternating current in 1874,1 which was essentially the first crystal detector and the first semiconductor junction.\n\nBraun’s experiments led him to invent what is now known as Braun’s Electrometer, or a cathode-ray tube (CRT) that he constructed in 1897. The CRT became the cornerstone to eventually inventing the television, as it was a critical part of any electronic screen up until the production of the LCD screen at the end of the 20th century. By 1898, Braun had taken up wireless telegraphy and attempted to transmit Morse signals through water by means of high-frequency currents.\n\nSubsequently, he introduced the closed circuit of oscillation into the field of wireless telegraphy and was one of the first to send electric waves in definite directions. That is, to send them toward intended points. Braun’s wireless, closed circuit could send signals over longer distances than those of his contemporaries, because the energy encountered less loss in his circuit. In early wireless transmitters, the antenna was situated directly in the power circuit and broadcasting was limited to a range of about 15km. Braun solved this problem by introducing a sparkless antenna circuit that linked transmitter power to the circuit inductively.\n\nIn 1905, Braun went a step further and invented the phased array antenna by arranging three antennas to transmit a direct signal. Braun and his assistants carefully controlled the excitation phase of each of the antennas shown in Fig 13 of Table 1 and determined experimentally that the antenna array exhibited significant directivity. This and the CRT earned Braun the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy, which he shared with Guglielmo Marconi. 1 Table 1 shows how Braun himself described the phased array when accepting the Nobel Prize:\n\nUnlike some of his contemporaries, “Braun avoided publicity and sought no personal recognition for his work. Braun saw his work solely in terms of helping [the] advancement of science.”4 This may have been a contributing factor in the reason why Guglielmo Marconi is better remembered as the “Father of Radio,” since the two had shared claim to the 1909 Nobel Prize.\n\nLater Life\n\nBefore the outbreak of World War I, Braun was summoned to New York as a witness for a lawsuit regarding a patent claim by the Marconi Corporation against the wireless station of Telefunken at Sayville, New York. Once the war broke out, Braun was detained to the United States, but was given permission to roam freely around Brooklyn. Due to his absence from his laboratory and the onset of illness, Braun was unable to continue his research, but he lived out the rest of his life peacefully in the United States and passed away April 20, 1918.\n\nIn the nearly 12 decades since Braun first described the phased array antenna system, this technology has become commonplace in 4G/5G communications, electronic warfare/countermeasures/support, radar, nonlethal weaponry, and military/industrial/medical imaging. Braun’s early innovations continue to inspire new technology today.\n\nSources"
