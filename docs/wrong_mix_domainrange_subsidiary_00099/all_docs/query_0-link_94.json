The historic Puck Building, home of the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.\n\n4. he founding of New York University in 1831 by a group of eminent private citi- zens was a historic event in American education. In the early 19th century, a major emphasis in higher education was on the mastery of Greek and Latin, with little attention given to modern or contemporary subjects. The founders of New York University intended to enlarge the scope of higher education to meet the needs of persons aspiring to careers in business, industry, science, and the arts, as well as in law, medicine, and the ministry. The opening of the University of London in 1828 convinced New Yorkers that New York, too, should have a university. The first president of New York University’s governing council was Albert Gallatin, former adviser to Thomas Jefferson and secretary of the treasury in Jefferson’s cabinet. Gallatin and his cofounders said that the new university was to be a “national university” that would provide a “rational and practical education for all.” The result of the founders’ foresight is today a university that is recognized both nationally and internationally as a leader in scholarship. Of the more than 3,000 colleges and universities in America, only 60 institutions are members of the distinguished Association of American Universities. New York University is one of the 60. Students come to the University from all 50 states and from over 130 foreign countries. The University includes 19 schools, colleges, and institutes at major centers in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Abu Dhabi (UAE) and Shanghai. In addition, the University operates a branch cam- pus program in Rockland County at St. Thomas Aquinas College. Certain of the University’s research facilities, notably the Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, are located in Sterling Forest, near Tuxedo, New York. Although overall the University is large, the divisions are small- to moderate-sized units—each with its own traditions, programs, and faculty. The University overall grants more than 25 different degrees.

With four million print volumes, 68,000 serial sub- scriptions, 50,000 electronic jour- nals, half a million e-books, 105,000 audio and video record- ings, and 25,000 linear feet of archival materials, the collections are uniquely strong in the per- forming arts, radical and labor his- tory, and the history of New York and its avant-garde culture. The library’s website, library.nyu.edu, received 2.8 million visits in 2008-2009. Bobst Library offers 28 miles of open stacks and approximately 2,500 seats for student study. The Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media, one of the world’s largest academic media centers, has 134 carrels for audio listening and video viewing and three mul- timedia classrooms. Last year the center filled more than 70,000 research requests for audio and video material. The Digital Studio offers a constantly evolving, lead- ing-edge resource for faculty and student projects and promotes and supports access to digital resources for teaching, learning, research, and arts events. The Data Service Studio provides expert staff and access to software, statistical com- puting, geographical information systems analysis, data collection resources, and data management services in support of quantitative research at NYU. The Fales Library, a special collection within Bobst Library, is home to the unparalleled Fales Collection of English and American Literature; the Food Studies Collection, a rich and growing trove of cookbooks, food writing, pamphlets, paper, and archives dating from the 1790s; and the Downtown Collection, an extraordinary multimedia archive documenting the avant-garde New York art world since 1975. Bobst Library also houses the Tamiment Library, the country’s leading repository of research materials in the history of left pol- itics and labor. Two fellowship programs bring scholars from around the world to Tamiment to explore the history of the Cold War and its wide-ranging impact on American institutions and to research academic freedom and promote public discussion of its history and role in our society. Tamiment’s Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives contain, among other resources, the archives of the Jewish Labor Committee and of more than 200 New York City labor organizations. The Barbara Goldsmith Preservation and Conservation Department in Bobst Library com- prises laboratories for book, film, and audio/video conservation. Its preservation projects often provide training for students in many aspects of book, paper, and media preservation. In a groundbreaking initiative funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Division of Libraries in 2008 com- pleted development of rationales and strategies for all aspects of moving image and audio preserva- tion, consulting with a variety of other institutions to identify and test best practices and disseminat- ing them throughout the archival community. Beyond Bobst, the library of the renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences focuses on research-level material in mathe- matics, computer science, and related fields. The Stephen Chan Library of Fine Arts at the Institute of Fine Arts (IFA) houses the rich collections that support the research and curricular needs of the institute’s graduate programs in art history and archaeology. The Jack Brause Real Estate Library at the Real Estate Institute, the\n\n6. most comprehensive facility of its kind, serves the information needs of every sector of the real estate community. The Library of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) is a resource for advanced research and graduate education in ancient civi- lizations from the western Mediterranean to China. Complementing the collections of the Division of Libraries are those of the libraries of NYU’s School of Medicine, Dental Center, and School of Law. The NYU Division of Libraries continually enhances its student and faculty services and expands its research collections, responding to the extraordinary growth of the University’s academic programs in recent years and to the rapid expansion of electronic informa- tion resources. Bobst Library’s pro- fessional staff includes more than 30 subject specialists who select materials and work with faculty and graduate students in every field of study at NYU. The staff also includes specialists in under- graduate outreach, instructional services, preservation, electronic information, and digital libraries. The Grey Art Gallery, the University’s fine arts museum, presents three to four innovative exhibitions each year that encom- pass all aspects of the visual arts: painting and sculpture, prints and drawings, photography, architec- ture and decorative arts, video, film, and performance. The gallery also sponsors lectures, seminars, symposia, and film series in con- junction with its exhibitions. Admission to the gallery is free for NYU staff, faculty, and students. The New York University Art Collection, founded in 1958, con- sists of more than 5,000 works in a wide range of media. The collec- tion primarily comprises late- 19th-century and 20th-century works; its particular strengths are American painting from the 1940s to the present and 20th-century European prints. A unique seg- ment of the NYU Art Collection is the Abby Weed Grey Collection of Contemporary Asian and Middle Eastern Art, which totals some 1,000 works in various media representing countries from Turkey to Japan. THE LARGER CAMPUS New York University is an inte- gral part of the metropolitan com- munity of New York City—the business, cultural, artistic, and financial center of the nation and the home of the United Nations. The city’s extraordinary resources enrich both the academic programs and the experience of living at New York University. Professors whose extracurricular activities include service as editors for publishing houses and maga- zines; as advisers to city govern- ment, banks, school systems, and social agencies; and as consultants for museums and industrial corpo- rations bring to teaching an expe- rience of the world and a profes- sional sophistication that are diffi- cult to match. Students also, either through course work or in outside activi- ties, tend to be involved in the vigorous and varied life of the city. Research for term papers in the humanities and social sciences may take them to such diverse places as the American Museum of Natural History, the Museum of Modern Art, a garment factory, a deterio- rating neighborhood, or a foreign consulate. Students in science work with their professors on such problems of immediate importance for urban society as the pollution of water- ways and the congestion of city streets. Business majors attend seminars in corporation board- rooms and intern as executive assistants in business and financial houses. The schools, courts, hospi- tals, settlement houses, theatres, playgrounds, and prisons of the greatest city in the world form a regular part of the educational scene for students of medicine, dentistry, education, social work, law, business and public adminis- tration, and the creative and per- forming arts. The chief center for undergrad- uate and graduate study is at Washington Square in Greenwich Village, long famous for its contri- butions to the fine arts, literature, and drama and its personalized, smaller-scale, European style of living. New York University itself makes a significant contribution to the creative activity of the Village through the high concentration of faculty and students who reside within a few blocks of the University. University apartment buildings provide housing for over 2,100 members of the faculty and admin- istration, and University student residence halls accommodate over 11,500 men and women. Many more faculty and students reside in private housing in the area. A PRIVATE UNIVERSITY Since its founding, New York University has been a private uni- versity. It operates under a board of trustees and derives its income from tuition, endowment, grants from private foundations and gov- ernment, and gifts from friends, alumni, corporations, and other private philanthropic sources. The University is committed to a policy of equal treatment and opportunity in every aspect of its relations with its faculty, students, and staff members, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender and/or gender identity or expression, marital or parental status, national origin, ethnicity, citizenship status, veter- an or military status, age, disabili- ty, and any other legally protected basis.

Inquiries may also be referred to the director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance, U.S. Department of Labor. New York University is a member of the Association of American Universities and is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools (Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, 3624 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104; 215-662- 5606). Individual undergraduate, graduate, and professional pro- grams and schools are accredited by the appropriate specialized accrediting agencies. 5 • I N T R O D U C T I O N\n\n7. 6 • I N T R O D U C T I O N Senior University Administration John Sexton, B.A., M.A., Ph.D., J.D., President David W.

Wagner Graduate School of Public Service strives to embody the values of a man who spent more than half a century serving the people of this city, state, and country. Following his mayoral career, Wagner continued in gov- ernment service, as United States ambassador to Spain and presidential envoy to the Vatican, as well as chair of a host of national, state, and local commissions. Today, Robert Wagner’s career in public service provides constant inspiration to the Wagner School community. The Wagner Tradition in Public Service z 10 • T H E WA G N E R T R A D I T I O N I N P U B L I C S E RV I C E N “Public service is the highest good and when done honorably and well, the most rewarding.” —Robert F. Wagner\n\n12. Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service Public and Nonprofit Management and Policy Program z The oldest instructional compo- nent of the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service is the Public and Nonprofit Management and Policy Program (formerly known as the Public Administration Program). The program, accredited by the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration (NASPAA), provides both general- ist and specialist graduate educa- tion for practitioners, managers, policymakers, and researchers con- cerned with the future of public service organizations and firms closely connected with the public sector. The program is designed to prepare students for work in diverse public service settings, including federal, state, and local governments; nonprofit institu- tions; foundations; international organizations; and in private sector fields related to public service. Frequently, students utilize their public administration education in many of these settings, moving easily among them as they pursue careers in the public service. Students in the M.P.A. pro- gram focus on one of four areas of specialization: management of public and nonprofit organiza- tions, financial management and public finance, public policy, or international policy and manage- ment. In addition to these choices, students are able to choose from a wide selection of elective courses and either cluster their courses around a single topic (e.g. eco- nomic development and housing; education policy; international development; public and nonprofit management and organizations; race, class, and diversity) or select more varied courses. Students may also take courses offered elsewhere at New York University, notably in the School of Law, the Leonard N. Stern School of Business, and the Graduate School of Arts and Science. The program culminates in a capstone end event that encourages students to integrate and enhance their learning in sev- eral different arenas: a content or issue area; key process skills including project management and 11 • R O B E RT F. WA G N E R G R A D U AT E S C H O O L O F P U B L I C S E RV I C E stablished in 1938, the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service offers advanced programs leading to the professional degrees of Master of Public Administration, Master of Urban Planning and Doctor of Philosophy. Through these rigorous programs, NYU Wagner educates the future leaders of public, nonprofit and health institutions, as well as private organizations serving the public sector. NYU Wagner prepares seri- ous, talented professionals to face the constantly changing challenges of public service. Trained in management, pol- icy and finance, NYU Wagner students graduate with the skills they need to confront society’s most press- ing problems. From throughout the world, NYU Wagner’s stu- dent body—as well as Wagner’s faculty and alum- ni—is bound together by a common commitment to public service, a commit- ment that infuses the school’s courses, programs, and activ- ities with a sense of shared moral and ethical purpose. NYU Wagner offers a distinctive and dynamic approach to preparing people to serve the public through education, research and serv- ice. Students enjoy an open, interactive educational set- ting that combines classroom learning with direct involve- ment in research and prac- tice. Residencies, externships and clinical courses all con- nect the NYU Wagner class- room to the real world, where students can act on their values and hone their skills. Located in the heart of New York City, one of the world’s great metropolises, surrounded by hundreds of nonprofit organizations, health care providers and government agencies, NYU Wagner is perfectly posi- tioned to deliver its practical approach, urban focus and global perspective.

The end event involves a team project for an external client, often a government agency or non- profit organization, or an applied research opportunity. An Advanced Professional Certificate program is also avail- able for working professionals who want to update their knowledge of a subject or develop expertise in an area that will enhance their profes- sional development. In 1970, the Wagner School estab- lished the Health Policy and Management Program in recogni- tion of the special characteristics of health services enterprises and the need for people with graduate edu- cation attuned to those special characteristics. The program serves those who are interested in careers concerned with policy analysis, financial management, and the management of health service organizations in the public, not- for-profit, and for-profit sectors— both nationally and internationally. Students in the program are required to declare a specialization in health services management, health policy analysis, health financial management, health pub- lic finance, or international health policy and management. The health program is led by a distinct faculty group, but it uses all the resources and courses offered by the School, as well as courses in other graduate and professional schools of the University. As an integral part of the program, health students participate in the capstone end event. The M.P.A. program is accred- ited by the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration. The management specialization of the M.P.A. health program is accredited by the Commission for the Accreditation of Health Management Education. An Advanced Professional Certificate program is also avail- able for students who have prior graduate degrees and want to pur- sue a specialization in the health area. Health Policy and Management Program Urban Planning Program The Urban Planning Program leads to the Master of Urban Planning degree, which provides students with the knowledge and skills in planning and in other professions involving planning skills. The M.U.P. degree at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service is accredited by the Planning Accreditation Board (PAB), spon- sored jointly by the American Institute of Certified Planners and the Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning in coordination with the American Planning Association. It constitutes credit toward member- ship in the American Institute of Certified Planners. Graduates of the M.U.P. degree program are employed by leading consulting firms, financial institutions, commu- nity development organizations, and governmental organizations at local, state, and federal levels. The program concentrates on the conceptual and analytical skills needed for effective urban plan- ning and policymaking. Major areas of emphasis in the M.U.P. curriculum include environmental planning, infrastructure planning, housing, urban economic develop- ment, and international urbaniza- tion. As part of the training for professional planning practice, most students have the opportu- nity to obtain hands-on experience during the course of study through internships, externships, and sum- mer and part-time jobs in plan- ning organizations and research assistantships with the School. The program culminates in a capstone end event that encourages students to integrate and enhance their learning in several different arenas: a content or issue area; key process skills including project management and teamwork; and methods for gathering, analyzing, and reporting data. The end event involves a team project for an external client, often a government agency or nonprofit organization, or an applied research opportunity. The Urban Planning Program offers working professionals in planning and related fields an opportunity to earn an Advanced Professional Certificate in one of a number of specializations. Executive Master of Public Administration NYU Wagner’s Master of Public Administration, Executive pro- grams and concentrations prepare seasoned professionals to have the greatest impact and achieve the highest level of success in public service. NYU Wagner offers the Masters of Public Administration, Executive program for public serv- ice leaders and managers, and a joint-degree program with University College London for global policy leaders. The School also offers an Executive concentra- tion for nurse leaders. Admitted students are either ris- ing leaders or already in an execu- tive position, and come from diverse backgrounds in the public, nonprofit, and private sectors. Graduates of the program or con- centration make a lasting impact leading agencies, companies, and organizations around the world and benefit from the Wagner School’s deep connections through- out New York City and the globe.\n\n14. 13 • R O B E RT F. WA G N E R G R A D U AT E S C H O O L O F P U B L I C S E RV I C E Ph.D. Program in Public Administration The Wagner School offers the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), a research-oriented degree intended to prepare students for scholarly careers in applied social science research. Study for a doctorate should only be undertaken by individuals who are interested in pursuing careers that focus mainly on research. Those interested in doctoral studies at the Wagner School are encouraged to spend time learning more about the pro- gram through the School’s website to see whether the course of study and faculty interests are a good match with the candidate’s own interests and expectations. Centers and Institutes NYU Wagner is home to research and policy centers, institutes, and initiatives that focus on problems of urgent importance at local, national, and global levels and strengthen public policy and pub- lic service nationally and interna- tionally. These centers and institutes create an environment of dynamic thinking, purposeful questioning, and thoughtful rea- soning on today’s most complex public service issues. With a repu- tation for quality analysis and eval- uation, research centers keep faculty and students current, make tangible contributions to critical public service arenas, and attract funding and talent that greatly enhance the School’s effectiveness. CENTER FOR GLOBAL PUBLIC SERVICE AND SOCIAL IMPACT The NYUAD Center for Global Public Service and Social Impact is designed to support the entrepre- neurial, effective, and efficient pro- duction of public value by governments, nongovernmental organizations, and private social ventures. It is built upon a broad commitment toward creating the highest quality of life around the globe. The Center’s mission is to advance international understand- ing and effective practice for strengthening the global public service as a driver of social impact in a constantly changing interna- tional environment. FINANCIAL ACCESS INITIATIVE The Financial Access Initiative is a research center focused on explor- ing how financial services can bet- ter meet the needs and improve the lives of poor households. The Financial Access Initiative, housed at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University, was founded in 2006 by economists Jonathan Morduch (New York University), Dean Karlan (Yale University), and Sendhil Mullainathan (Harvard University). The initial funding was provided by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. FURMAN CENTER FOR REAL ESTATE AND URBAN POLICY Since its founding in 1994, the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy has become the leading academic research center in New York City devoted to the public policy aspects of land use, real estate development and hous- ing. The Center is dedicated to three missions: providing objective academic and empirical research on the legal and public policy issues involving land use, real estate, housing and urban affairs in the United States, with a particu- lar focus on New York City; pro- moting frank and productive discussions among elected and appointed officials, leaders of the real estate industry, leaders of non- profit housing and community development organizations, schol- ars, faculty and students about critical issues in land use, real estate and urban policy; and pre- senting innovative and engaging learning environments for students interested in land use, real estate development, community eco- nomic development, housing, urban economics and urban policy. INSTITUTE FOR CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS The Institute for Civil Infrastructure Systems (ICIS) is a research and education center founded in January 1998, located at New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, and directed by Professor Rae Zimmerman. ICIS promotes interdisciplinary approaches to planning, building, and managing the complex world of civil infrastructure systems to meet their social and environmen- tal objectives. Current areas of research include infrastructure security and protection, risk com- munication and management, and the sustainability of urban areas. INSTITUTE FOR EDUCATION AND SOCIAL POLICY A university-wide, multidiscipli- nary enterprise, the Institute for Education and Social Policy was founded by former Wagner Dean and NYU Executive Vice President Robert Berne, the Aaron Diamond Foundation’s Norm Fruchter, and former NYU Steinhardt School of Education Dean Ann Marcus. The Institute investigates urban education issues and studies the impact of public policy on students from poor, dis- advantaged, urban communities. Under director Amy Ellen Schwartz, this partnership of the Wagner School and Steinhardt School explores topics such as school finance equity in New York State, opportunities to learn in charter schools, new systems of public accountability for educa- tion, the cost effectiveness of small schools and special education in New York City schools. The Institute also collects key educa- tional data and provides training and technical assistance to commu- nity groups organizing to improve their schools. JOHN BRADEMAS CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF CONGRESS The mission of the John Brademas Center for the Study of Congress is to increase the understanding of the “People’s Branch” of govern- ment, focusing on the powers,\n\n15. 14 • R O B E RT F. WA G N E R G R A D U AT E S C H O O L O F P U B L I C S E RV I C E processes, and responsibilities of Congress. The Center’s bipartisan work is aimed at scholars, stu- dents, current and future policy- makers, and the public. The Center conducts research, organ- izes classes, holds public outreach events, and hosts policy addresses by current and former members of Congress and their staffs. It is named for John Brademas, who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1959 to 1981 and was NYU’s president for 11 years following his tenure in Congress. M.L. BERMAN JEWISH POLICY ARCHIVE The Berman Jewish Policy Archive (BJPA) at NYU’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service is a central address for Jewish communal and social pol- icy, both on the web and in its home at NYU Wagner. Named for its principal funder, The Berman Foundation, BJPA’s primary focus is on making the vast amount of policy-relevant material accessible and available to all those who seek it. Launched in October 2008, BJPA’s free and searchable online archive spans from the early twen- tieth century into the twenty-first, and is bridging into the future with continually updated print and web-based sources. In placing this material into a comprehensive database - the first of its kind— BJPA aims to encourage thought- ful and informed policy discourse in the Jewish community. Its library can also be found as a spe- cial Research Collection within the Policy Archive of the Center for Governmental Studies. In its insti- tutional and intellectual home at NYU Wagner, BJPA produces reports on current topics and hosts conferences, forums, and other events to engage the public in issues of pressing concern to the community at large. In so doing, BJPA hopes to create a rich, com- prehensive, and usable intellectual legacy, animating research on Jewish life for the present and for generations to come. RESEARCH CENTER FOR LEADERSHIP IN ACTION The Research Center for Leadership in Action (RCLA) creates collabora- tive learning environments that break down this isolation, foster needed connections and networks, and yield new and practical insights and strategies. We engage the lead- ership of a diverse spectrum of pub- lic service organizations from government agencies to nonprofits large and small to community- based and social change groups, both across the country and around the world. Launched in 2003 with core funding from the Ford Foundation, RCLA crafts and runs customized, experiential lead- ership programs that both expand individuals’ skills and strengthen the organizations in which they work. It develops structured con- venes where leaders explore the complexity of the challenges they face and together advance their efforts to make change possible.

AREAS OF SPECIALIZATION Students must select or design an area of specialization. The faculty of the health program has designed four options that are suited to many students’ interests: (1) health services management, (2) health policy analysis, (3) health finance (either health services financial management or health care public finance), and (4) international health. Students also have the opportunity to design a cus- tomized area of specialization appropriate to their interests and career plans. Health Policy This specialization focuses on the development and evaluation of health policies and programs. Emphasis is placed on developing policy analytic skills including evaluation design, descriptive and multivariate statistics, program implementation analysis, policy formation assessment, and cost- benefit analysis. Policy analysts are concerned with the development and evaluation of strategies to improve the functioning of the health care delivery system. Sometimes this role is played in a governmental agency responsible for regulating and financing health services. Sometimes a policy ana- lyst works for an organization that provides health care services, a nonprofit service organization, or a professional association or founda- tion. Responsibilities often include the development and analysis of data to support policy initiatives; an assessment of new health care initiatives using techniques such as cost-benefit analysis, program eval- uation, and implementation analy- sis; and the development of formal health plans to anticipate future needs for health care resources.

Health Financial Management. This sub-specialization focuses on the basic skills required to organ- ize and interpret financial informa- tion as the basis of decision making. Specific topics include financial and managerial account- ing, financial statements, business plans, budgeting, capital planning, cost accounting, managerial con- trol, and working capital manage- ment and payment systems. Financial managers measure the flow of funds into and out of the organization, plan for investments in buildings and new technology, and forecast future surpluses and deficits for the organization as a whole and its various departments. Financial managers work closely with accountants, administrators, computer programmers, records managers, and planners whose decisions have a considerable impact on the financial status of organizations. They, in turn, rely on the financial manager’s skills and advice to assist them in fulfill- ing their responsibilities.

This sub- specialization provides the con- cepts and skills needed for careers that focus on the financial aspects of health care policy and the health care delivery system. Specific top- ics include public expenditure analysis, social insurance pro- grams, taxation, and debt financ- ing. Health care public finance positions are located in govern- ment, private, and nonprofit organizations. Graduates often work in different positions during their careers. Examples include budget officers and analysts, con- sultants, finance directors, grants managers, program auditors, financial analysts, bond raters, investment bankers, and bond insurance underwriters.

To design a customized track, students must meet with their faculty adviser and outline specific courses. DETAILED REQUIREMENTS Candidates for the M.P.A. degree in health policy and management must complete 60 credits with a B (3.0) or better average. A mini- mum of 32 credits must be com- pleted while matriculated in the Wagner School. All degree requirements must be completed within five years—no credit toward the degree will be granted for course work completed more than five years before the granting of the degree. This also applies to transfer credit. The academic work includes the five schoolwide core courses, two to three core health courses, three to five advanced courses within an area of special- ization, two to four electives, and the completion of an end event (capstone). Required Courses. The required core courses should be taken early in the program as they are prereq- uisites for many of the advanced health courses and provide an essential intellectual base for course work for the M.P.A. Waivers. Students who have acquired knowledge of the subject matter of any of the core courses prior to enrolling at the Wagner School are encouraged to consider applying for a waiver. In order to be waived from a course, students need to review the relevant waiver 21 • M A S T E R O F P U B L I C A D M I N I S T R AT I O N\n\n23. policy on the Wagner website. Course waivers do not reduce the 60-credit degree requirement, but they do provide students with the opportunity to take additional electives. Professional Experience Requirement. All students are required to gradu- ate with field experience that is relevant to their degree program. Students who enter the program with fewer than two years of full- time relevant experience in the field must show proof of having completed an internship or work experience relevant to their degree program while at Wagner before enrollment in capstone. Elective Courses. Students have a certain number of elective credits that provide them with the oppor- tunity to gain additional expertise in important areas, depending on their degree requirements. Students are encouraged to con- sider relevant courses offered at the Wagner School, as well as at other graduate schools within NYU. Capstone Requirement. Required of all M.P.A. and M.U.P. students. Over the course of an academic year, students work in teams either to address challenges and identify opportunities for a client organiza- tion or to conduct research on a pressing social question. (Note: M.P.A. and M.U.P. students com- mencing study in the spring semester will require two and one- half years to complete the program due to course sequencing.) 22 • M A S T E R O F P U B L I C A D M I N I S T R AT I O N\n\n24. s part of the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, the Urban Planning Program prepares students for careers in local and state governments, pub- lic authorities, and nonprofit and for-profit organizations. There are three areas of emphasis in the Master of Urban Planning (M.U.P.) program: environment, infrastructure, and trans- portation planning; econom- ic development and housing; and international develop- ment planning. The overall goal of the M.U.P. curriculum is to pre- pare students to work as planners in a variety of set- tings, including nonprofit organizations, private agen- cies, and the public sector. Students in the program acquire analytical skills and substantive knowledge to undertake these professional responsibilities, especially in the areas of urban and regional planning, environ- ment, infrastructure, trans- portation, urban economic development, housing, and, increasingly, the field of international urbanization. Students develop the skills to work well in teams and with multicultural populations. Graduates of the Urban Planning Program are pre- pared to work in consulting firms, planning agencies, financial investment firms, and public agencies across the country. (Note: The M.U.P. program is accredited by the Planning Accreditation Board.) Master of Urban Planning Degree Requirements z Master of Urban Planning (M.U.P.) requirements consist of a minimum of the equivalent of 15 graduate courses, including required and elective courses and a capstone end event, for a total of 60 credits. All M.U.P. students are required to complete four school- wide core courses and five urban planning core courses and to demonstrate computer proficiency. The required planning courses deal with urban planning and its politi- cal context and emphasize quanti- tative and economic methods of analysis in urban planning. M.U.P. students are encouraged to either cluster their electives in one of two areas—environment, infrastruc- ture, and transportation planning or economic development and housing—or pursue a specializa- tion in international development planning. Electives may consist of courses in the Urban Planning Program or within the Wagner School as well as from other gradu- ate schools of New York University. Using the resources of New York University, it is possible to acquire additional expertise rel- evant for professional urban plan- ners. Urban planning students are eligible to enroll in courses offered by New York University’s Schack Institute of Real Estate as part of their M.U.P. program. Students interested in transportation plan- ning may enroll in courses at Polytechnic Institute of NYU (NYU-Poly). Students who enter the pro- gram with fewer than two years of full-time relevant experience in the field must show proof of having completed an internship or work experience relevant to their degree program while at Wagner before enrollment in capstone.

A mini- mum of 32 credits must be com- pleted while matriculated in the Wagner School. All degree requirements must be completed within five years—no credit toward the degree will be granted for course work taken as part of another completed graduate degree or completed more than five years before the granting of the degree. This also applies to transfer credit. All M.U.P. students are required to demonstrate computer proficiency and to complete (1) four schoolwide core courses; (2) five required urban planning core courses; (3) a required capstone experience in the form of a profes- sional practice; and (4) twenty credits of elective courses in urban planning or related subjects. Students pursuing the interna- tional urban planning specializa- tion are required to complete the five courses of the international development planning core instead of the five courses of the urban planning core for the elective clus- ter track. Waivers. Students who have acquired knowledge of the subject matter of any of the core courses prior to enrolling at the Wagner School are encouraged to consider applying for a waiver. In order to be waived from a course, students need to review the relevant waiver policy on the Wagner website and submit the proper materials to Student and Program Services. Course waivers do not reduce the 60-credits degree requirement, but they do provide students with the opportunity to take additional electives. Professional Experience Requirement. All students are required to gradu- ate with field experience that is relevant to their degree program. Students who enter the program with fewer than two years of full- time relevant experience in the field must show proof of having completed an internship or work experience relevant to their degree program while at Wagner before enrollment in capstone. Electives. Elective courses are organized in three areas of empha- sis, and students are advised to concentrate in one of these areas: (1) environment, infrastructure, and transportation planning; (2) economic development and housing; or (3) international devel- opment planning. All students are also urged to take one or more courses in geographic information systems. Although specific elective course work is not required of urban planning students, cluster- ing electives is encouraged as a way of obtaining expertise in a specialized area. Capstone Requirement. Required of all M.P.A. and M.U.P. students. Students work in teams either to address challenges and identify opportunities for a client organiza- tion or to conduct research on a pressing social question. (Note: M.P.A. and M.U.P. students com- mencing study in the spring semes- ter will require at least two and one-half years to complete the pro- gram due to course sequencing.) 24 • M A S T E R O F U R B A N P L A N N I N G\n\n26.

NYU Wagner offers Executive Masters of Public Administration (EMPA) degrees to public service leaders and managers, global policy leaders and nurse leaders. EMPA students are either rising leaders or already in an executive position, and come from diverse backgrounds in the public, nonprofit, and private sectors. Graduates of the EMPA program make a lasting impact leading agen- cies, companies, and organi- zations around the world and benefit from NYU Wagner’s deep connections throughout New York City and the globe. Master of Public Administration, Executive Program for Service Leaders and Managers DEGREE REQUIREMENTS The requirements for the Executive M.P.A. program for public service leaders and man- agers consist of a minimum of nine graduate courses, or 36 credits, including three required courses (12 credits). All degree requirements must be com- pleted within five years—no credit toward the degree will be granted for course work completed more than five years before granting the degree. This also applies to trans- fer credit. COURSEWORK Executive M.P.A. students may tailor their program by selecting elective courses from one or more of the School’s areas of specializa- tion or course topic areas (see list below). All Executive M.P.A. stu- dents must demonstrate profi- ciency in public service leadership and management, and financial management. Proficiency in these critical areas is accomplished by taking EXEC-GP 1194 Strategic Leadership, EXEC-GP 3190 Leadership Confronted and CORE-GP 1021 Financial Management for Public, Nonprofit, and Health Organizations (or by meeting the requirements for a waiver). Normally, students may not take more than two of the school- wide core courses. Up to 8 credits of suitable transfer credit from graduate coursework may be used to meet degree requirements, pro- vided that they were not part of a previous master’s degree. If the maximum number of transfer credits is awarded, all of the remaining courses must be taken at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. All Executive M.P.A. degree students are required to complete an end event that provides an opportunity for assessment of over- all accomplishment. EXEC-GP 3190 Leadership Confronted should be taken in a student’s final spring semester and provides an integrative experience for Executive M.P.A. students. Elective Courses: Students have elective credits that provide them with the opportunity to gain addi- tional expertise in important areas, depending on their degree require- ments. Students are encouraged to consider relevant courses offered at NYU Wagner, as well as at other graduate schools within NYU.

(joint-degree with University College London) Established in 2012, the Global E.M.P.A. program will receive its first incoming class in the fall of 2014. The innovative one-year joint degree was created in partnership with University College London and its School of Public Policy. Intended for experienced leaders, the program will improve stu- dents’ ability to craft effective solutions to problems in the face of global and local policy and man- agement challenges. Accomplished professionals in the program learn to balance advantages of public and private sector actors; promote successful inter-governmental cooperation at all levels; more effectively link policy analysis with policy implementation; and broadly ensure that policy is meet- ing its intended objectives and improving human welfare. COURSEWORK The program is a one-year full- time program, commencing each fall. Students spend the first semester (August - December) at the Wagner School enrolled in two required courses and two electives. Students spend the spring term (January - May) at University College London enrolled in two required courses and two elective courses. The summer is spent in locations across the globe working on an executive level client-based capstone project. Students must complete 36 credits to graduate, consisting of the four required courses (16 credits), four elective courses (16 credits), and Capstone (4 credits). Global Capstone In the Global E.M.P.A capstone program students work in teams to address challenges and identify opportunities for client organiza- tions across the globe. The course is completed in the summer term and provides students with an end- event course that allows them to focus on a specific content or issue area; enhance key process skills, such as project management and teamwork; and improve their com- petency in gathering, analyzing, and reporting on data. Master of Public Administration, Executive Concentration for Nurse Leaders COURSEWORK The curriculum for the Executive M.P.A. Program’s concentration for nurse leaders combines the lat- est in health care management research with opportunities for real-world application. The pro- gram prepares nursing profession- als to provide effective leadership in today’s complex hospital and health care systems. On a part-time basis, students complete 36 credits, consisting of five core courses and four electives. Students begin their first semester with EXEC-GP 1830 Introduction to Health Policy and Management for Nurse Leaders, HPAM-GP 4833 Health Care Management I: Control and Organizational Design, and HPAM-GP 4834 Health Care Management II: Adaptation and the Professional Manager. In their second semester, students complete EXEC-GP 1821 Financial Management for Nurse Leaders and EXEC-GP 2810 Service Excellence for Nurse Leaders. The final core course is taken in a student’s final year: CAP-GP 3890 and CAP-GP 3891 Capstone: Advanced Project for Nurse Leaders. Capstone Students in the Executive M.P.A. nurse leaders program fulfill the end event requirement via the School’s capstone course. Working in teams and under the supervision of a Wagner faculty member, stu- dents use an evidence-based approach to design and recom- mend management interventions to respond to organizational chal- lenges and opportunities for a client organization in the health care field. The capstone course is completed during the student’s final year in the program."
