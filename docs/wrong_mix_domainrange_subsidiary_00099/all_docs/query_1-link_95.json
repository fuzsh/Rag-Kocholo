In connection with this new strategic direction, SCYNEXIS intends to out-license BREXAFEMME® for vaginal yeast infections and is actively pursuing a U.S. commercialization partner. During this process, SCYNEXIS will wind down its promotional activities for BREXAFEMME, while keeping BREXAFEMME on the market and available to patients. With the change in strategic direction, SCYNEXIS no longer is in need of the commercialization services provided by its contracted commercial sales partner, Amplity Health, and SCYNEXIS is in ongoing discussions to terminate the Master Services Agreement by and between SCYNEXIS and Amplity, Inc.
