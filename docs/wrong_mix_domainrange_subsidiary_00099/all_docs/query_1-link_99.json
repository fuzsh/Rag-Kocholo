        "text": "“Thank you and your team for the tremendous amount of work that went into making the Design Review Committee presentation a success. Everyone was very impressed with the building renderings, its amenities, and the thought that went into the site design. This project sets high standards for future development throughout STEP. We look forward to continuing to work with you and your team on this outstanding project.”\n\n“I wanted to take a moment to express our gratitude for a job well done by your company. Safety, security and constant communication while working within the confines of an active airport are critical and cannot be taken for granted. Your team understood this and we never had a concern while the work of this contract progressed. Also I was very impressed with Jersen’s constant attempt to please the owner. Now after a good, hard winter your work on this project has stood the test of time.”\n\n“Renovating a 40-year-old, public, open-air, performing arts facility offers a unique set of challenges that many construction companies would not be equipped to manage. However, from the start, it was apparent that Jersen had the expertise needed to see the project to completion. The Company’s professionalism and commitment to quality ultimately gave us a ‘new’ amphitheatre that is worthy of the world-class artists and programming that we showcase in it each summer. Jersen is a company that is truly up to any challenge and that maintains high standards in a demanding, competitive industry.”\n\n“I would like to express my sincerest form of appreciation and congratulations. The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute – EMPAC building site is complex and congested with changes in work areas happening by the hour, hazards can arise fast. Due to the overwhelming efforts from your supervision, safety officer and crew members, violations and hazards are detected and corrected in a timely manner. OSHA was not only impressed with the conditions of the site but the teamwork between subcontractors, all tradesmen, not to mention an impeccable safety record to date. Jersen has shown outstanding teamwork day after day and Turner Construction is proud to be working with you.”\n\n“On behalf of Bridgestone America Tire Operations LLC I am writing this letter to thank Jersen Construction for the job well done on finishing the commercial truck bay addition at our Albany location. Within the five months of the construction project, your company has shown diligence and dedication to finish work in time… Your attention to the specifics of the construction as well as proper scheduling has been very remarkable, resulting to a job well done.”\n\n“Thank you for the outstanding job you did building the addition to our Southern Saratoga County YMCA. The smoothness of the project that allowed us to enjoy the main facility throughout construction was commendable. Delivering the facility a full month ahead of the project was appreciated by our staff and members who were pleasantly surprised with the size and quality of the addition. In today’s business climate it is unheard of to complete a project of this nature without a change order. For this expansion to come to completion without one is I know a tribute to you and your company. Recently I mentioned to our volunteers from the Guilderland Community YMCA that you were the best contractor I ever worked with in my twenty years in this business.”\n\n“I wish to thank Jersen Construction Group and its subcontractors for their patience, perseverance and adopted design as you build flexibility into meeting the specialty needs of the C9 Corporation…the end product is much better than originally anticipated and has drawn many compliments from New York State and Industry observers, related to its functionality, energy saving design and perceived value. This team effort and the facility outcome are most appreciated, thank you.”\n\n“From inception, Jersen’s personnel hit the ground running and demonstrated a proactive approach. As with most difficult renovations, unforeseen conditions can sometimes slow a project down, but Jersen’s cooperative and problem solving team approach with the construction management and design team allowed solutions to overcome obstacles. Every level of Jersen’s organization, from the laborer in the field to the owner of the company demonstrated the same proactive approach in completing the project with a high standard of quality and on schedule.\n\nAs the renovation was nearing its completion, an additional project sprouted up. A community garden was established…one of the first organizations to step in and volunteer to help was Jersen. On a Saturday, not only did employees of your organization volunteer, but family members also volunteered, just another example of Jersen’s commitment to the project and the Arbor Hill Community.”\n\n“Jersen Construction Group worked on the $35 million expansion / renovation of the Stiefel Oak Hill Manufacturing and Distribution facility. This has been a very complex project…amplified by the need to construct and renovate the whole 230,000 sf facility without affecting Stiefel’s ability to produce drug products according to Good Manufacturing Practices. As our construction manager, Jersen was intimately involved in the design phase, the value engineering phase and coordination of the many subcontractors required to complete this project. Jersen has a great capacity to handle the many technical challenges we faced …we were certainly blessed to have chosen Jersen Construction Group to lead us through this long and difficult project.”\n\n“Jersen’s support of our event shows a larger awareness of what we’re all doing here. It shows your company places a value on the customer and that, even though this is a public project, it will make a direct impact of the lives of the families who will use this building for many years to come. It is clear that you ‘get it.’ On behalf of the Delhi Community, a sincere thanks to all of you.”\n\n“I want to thank you and your team for a great project result and excellent customer service. It is obvious you value your clients and take pride in your product. Major renovation is one of the more stressful experiences in business and your company provided a streamlined, trouble-free process that was a pleasure to work with.”\n\n“I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Jersen Construction Group for their outstanding workmanship and professionalism in the completion of this project. While focusing on the project scope and timeline your team was able to maintain the very important day to day plant operations for my staff and myself. Working with your team to complete this unique project has improved the efficiency of our plant, saving both time and money, and has created unexpected professional friendships which can benefit all involved.”\n\n“The Board of Fire Commissioners of Glenville Fire District #2 would like to thank the Jersen Construction Group for the excellent work your company conducted in the construction and rehabilitation of our firehouse. This construction project was the culmination of a multi-year process and the largest project our fire district has ever undertaken. The Jersen Construction Group completed the work efficiently and we were able to stay within budget even with several necessary change orders. Thank you for a job well done!”\n\n“I would like to thank you and your team for the excellent work you did in the construction of the Schenectady County Public Library Plaza. The quality of the work was excellent and the finished project is outstanding. I was particularly impressed by the responsiveness, attention to detail, and commitment to following the intent of the project and ensuring consistent quality throughout the work. The project also required great attention to detail, and despite a very tight schedule, Jersen executed the work thoroughly and beautifully. Prior to the project start, the plaza was a large and empty space that had fallen into disrepair. Today, it is one of the nicest public spaces downtown and has become a real sense of pride for the Library and the City.”\n\n“Working on Tribute Park was especially fulfilling as so much work went into the original community outreach, planning, design and fundraising for this project. Despite an incredibly tight budget and unforeseen circumstances such as the buried oil tank and finding the old streetcar tracks, your team worked really hard to make the project a reality. Public open space is limited in the Eastern Avenue Neighborhood and the community is very excited to have this new park. Working with Jersen on this project was a pleasure and resulted in a project of the highest quality.”\n\n“The Board of Fire Commissioners, Halfmoon Fire District #1 wishes to extend our sincere appreciation to your company for the efforts that your employees put forth to make the plans for the rebuilding of our 50 year old cramped and outdated fire station a reality. The remodeled fire station looks fantastic, is state of the art has given the fire district, fire department and the community residents and visitors an emergency services building to be proud of and that will be in service for the next 50 plus years.”"
