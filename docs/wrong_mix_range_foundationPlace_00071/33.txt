Places, also known as points of interest (POIs), are geographic locations represented by a single latitude-longitude point. A place may be a business, a government building such as a post office, a landmark like the Eiffel Tower, or a natural feature such as a lake or a trail head.

ArcGIS Places data provides authoritative information about locations that can be used as a stand-alone foundation for visualization for analysis or can be used in the context of other types of data, such as Esri Demographics data and imagery data.

Knowing about the places that exist in your area of interest can inform geographic analysis and decision making, helping you answer questions such as the following:

Where is the nearest pharmacy from this hospital that is currently open?

How far is a competitor's store from my business?

What is the demographic profile of the census tract the place falls in?

Where are the most popular Italian restaurants near my current location?

Is this place located in a flood zone or within range of other natural hazards?

Caution:

The use of Places data requires that you access it using licensed ArcGIS products through one of three available access methods: ArcGIS Location Platform, ArcGIS Online, or install the data locally. Local data installations require the purchase of a Places dataset bundle. Product licenses, access methods, and dataset bundles each have associated costs. See the product documentation in the tables below for licensing and product usage details. See the ArcGIS Online Credits by capability topic or the ArcGIS Location Platform Pricing topic to learn more about the costs associated with accessing Places data when performing tasks such as exporting places with a business search, finding nearby locations, creating and downloading reports, and creating or exporting infographics.
