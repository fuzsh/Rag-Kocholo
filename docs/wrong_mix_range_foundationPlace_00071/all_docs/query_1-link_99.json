        "text": "FORMAL DEFINITION\n\nGeographic information system(s), GIS (noun)\n\nGIS is a technology that is used to create, manage, analyze, and map all types of data.\n\nGIS connects data to a map, integrating location data (where things are) with all types of descriptive information (what things are like there). This provides a foundation for mapping and analysis that is used in science and almost every industry. GIS helps users understand patterns, relationships, and geographic context. The benefits include improved communication, efficiency, management, and decision-making.\n\nChoosing the right location\n\nMake better decisions about business growth or service expansion. Know where your best customers are and discover where to find more of them. When selecting the ideal place for a new retail store, distribution hub, or fire station, GIS can bring together all the information important to your decision. Consider what’s nearby, travel times, population numbers, local demographics, site suitability, and competitor locations.\n\nKeeping track of things\n\nGet a better understanding of everything you manage. Respond to issues quickly. Plan preventative maintenance so things don’t break down. Roads, water pipes, streetlights, company vehicles—these are all things GIS can help you take care of throughout their life cycles. GIS tells you where things are and what condition they’re in.\n\nPlanning for the future\n\nMake predictions and informed decisions that benefit both people and the planet. Model possible scenarios to address complex challenges like climate resilience and sustainability. GIS analysis can identify where adding green spaces would reduce extreme heat for the most vulnerable, or where expected population growth would support a business expansion.\n\nResponding to emergencies\n\nProtect people and save lives before, during, and after emergencies such as hurricanes, fires, and earthquakes. GIS helps responders understand what is happening right now, and where, so they can help where it’s needed most. Emergency management teams use GIS before and after emergencies for planning and recovery."
