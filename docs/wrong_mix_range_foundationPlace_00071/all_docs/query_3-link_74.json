The Rancho is located on Tongva-Gabrielino land known as Povuunânga. From the Tongva people who lived and gathered at Povuunânga through waves of newcomers from Spain, Mexico, the United States, and more, the site has nurtured a great diversity of peoples and cultures over thousands of years. Today, the 7Â½-acre site includes four acres of nationally significant historic gardens, a ranch house (1790-1933), and a restored barnyard of the early 20th-century working ranch. Read more.\n\nDuring your visit, wander garden trails, learn from knowledgeable docents and volunteers, meet the barnyardâs resident livestock (horses, sheep, goats, chickens, and ducks), and explore California history. Our mission is to inspire a sense of community by educating and engaging visitors with our rich history, our compelling stories, and our authentic connections to Californiaâs past. We welcome you to join us."
