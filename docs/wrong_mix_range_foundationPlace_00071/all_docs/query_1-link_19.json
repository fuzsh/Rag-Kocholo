For many years, geospatial professionals have been collecting, collating, analysing and sharing real world data and information for all parts of the planet we inhabit.\n\nWe refer to this as The Living Atlas of the World. This is the largest collection of digital global geographic information used to support critical business and political decision making.\n\nGeography is the foundation subject for complex problem solving, spatial thinking, location-based analytics and spatial reasoning.\n\nWe have a strongly held belief that over time, our Education Programmes will help our future decision makers to understand and solve some of the world’s most difficult problems while gaining insights into how the world of geospatial technology enables education for a brighter future."
