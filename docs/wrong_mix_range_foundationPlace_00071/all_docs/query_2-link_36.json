        "text": "Thousands of nonprofit entities and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) around the world use a geographic approach to advance their missions. This approach has a foundation in geographic information system (GIS) technology that enables faster data sharing, fluid collaboration, and decisive action. Viewing operations and outreach through a geographic lens elevates strategic business plans, enhances services, and promotes lasting change.\n\nNonprofit organizations can apply a geographic approach to everything they do. GIS technology allows staff and volunteers to connect data based on geography and apply spatial thinking to decision-making. This unique perspective on creating, managing, analyzing, and mapping all types of data empowers teams to better communicate causes, understand communities, act on missions, and measure impacts. Use cloud-based and cost-effective tools to extend services, attract volunteers, expand and manage donor networks, and shape public policies."
