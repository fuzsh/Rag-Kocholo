        "text": "A Museum Like No Other\n\nThe estate popularly known as Hearst Castle is a National Historic Landmark and California Historical Landmark located on the Central Coast of California, about 250 miles north of Los Angeles.\n\nIt was designed by architect Julia Morgan between 1919 and 1947 as a residence for William Randolph Hearst, who died in 1951.\n\nHearst Corporation deeded the estate to California in January 1958 and Hearst San Simeon State Historical Monument® opened to the public that summer. The Castle serves as the key economic engine of the Central California Coast. Since then, the estate, and its considerable collection of art and antiques, has been open for public tours.\n\nDespite its location far from any urban center, the Castle welcomes around 700,000 visitors annually, making it a top tourist destination in California.\n\nEstablished in 1985, The Foundation at Hearst Castle (formerly called Friends of Hearst Castle) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit cooperating association affiliated with Hearst San Simeon State Historical Monument® and the San Luis Obispo Coast District of California State Parks.\n\nThrough membership and fundraising, The Foundation supports educational, interpretive, and preservation programs for Hearst Castle and California State Parks. Through the Foundation, businesses, philanthropic organizations, and individuals can provide support and engagement with Hearst Castle.\n\nWe provide membership opportunities, educational programs, and special events (such as Neptune Pool Swims and intimate wine-paired dinners at the castle) with the goal of enhancing understanding and appreciation, thereby enriching the visitor experience."
