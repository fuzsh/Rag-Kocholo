        "meta_description": "CA Nature CA Nature: a suite of interactive mapping and visualization tools compiling statewide biodiversity, access, climate and conservation information to advance 30x30 Jump to: Introduction CA Nature is an online Geographic Information System (or GIS), that collects a suite of publicly accessible interactive digital mapping tools and data. This collection of tools brings together maps of biodiversity, climate change, and public access so we can view and analyze features of the landscape from a single site. It allows us to identify places across California where we have the opportunity to achieve our biodiversity, climate, and equity goals. The State will use CA Nature to assess what percentage of California is already conserved and track progress toward our goal. Conserved Terrestrial Area Gauge Conserved Marina Area Gauge Open Access Areas Gauge Acres by GAP Status Chart Story Maps The Story Maps below provide an introduction to California's 30x30 efforts, lay out the challenges and opportunities associated with conservation and climate change, and walk users through the suite of tools in CA Nature. Each story map contributes by explaining the 30x30 initiative in California, illuminating the challenges and opportunities, or helping visitors use the exploratory tools supporting California's responses to Executive Order N-82-20. California's 30x30 Initiative Access Explorer User Guide Biodiversity Explorer Guide Climate Explorer User Guide Conserved Areas Explorer Guide Conservation Opportunities Modeler User Guide Explore this Story Map to learn more about the goal of conserving 30 percent of our lands and coastal waters by 2030. Learn about the Access Explorer and how to compare populations living near publicly accessible open spaces with those of the community overall. The Biodiversity Explorer provides unique insights into the state's biodiversity as measured by multiple key metrics. Use this guide to learn how to use the Biodiversity Explorer. Learn about the data in the Climate Explorer and how to visualize projected changes to California’s temperature and precipitation patterns. Learn how to use the Conserved Areas Explorer. This Story Map provides a guide to the data and features of the application that tracks California's progress to 30x30. Learn how to get the most out of CA Nature's decision support tools. CA Nature Open Data User Guide This guide introduces CA Nature Open Data and familiarizes users with key features and capabilities of the open data site and tools. Explorer Applications The interactive Explorer Applications below enable everyone to engage with data in new and significant ways. Building on the foundation provided by the story maps above, these applications provide subject-specific opportunities to dig in and develop insights into the challenges and opportunities that California faces as it works towards the goals of 30x30 and implements climate smart land strategies. Access Explorer Biodiversity Explorer Climate Explorer The Access Explorer compares populations living near publicly accessible open spaces with those of the community overall. The Biodiversity Explorer draws from several key datasets of the Areas of Conservation Emphasis (ACE) project developed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The Climate Explorer compares changes in temperature and precipitation throughout the state between different climate models and time periods. Conserved Areas Explorer This dashboard brings together conservation success stories from across the state, tallies their contributions towards 30x30 goals, and enables you to explore the data being used to track this progress. Conservation Opportunities Modeler Decision support tools integrate data across themes within 30x30, and climate smart land strategies. Using a weighted overlay, our stakeholders can use the same tools that the state does to identify areas with multiple overlapping opportunities or where tackling specific challenges can help meet California's conservation and climate goals. Conservation Opportunities Modeler Highlighted Data and Open Data The data below are central to CA Nature. They represent either foundational data about the state's biodiversity, conserved lands, and climate activities or provide context essential for understanding the relationship between California's geography and the goals of Executive Order N-82-20. Use the embedded application to thumb through these key data and learn what is included in CA Nature. CA Nature Data Carousel CA Nature Open Data As a State project charged to conserve 30% of California's lands and waters by 2030, data is essential to informing targets, identifying opportunities, and validating that goals are met. It is also incumbent on the state to provide these data in an open and transparent fashion. Please visit the Open Data portal for CA Nature to engage directly with the data in your own work.
