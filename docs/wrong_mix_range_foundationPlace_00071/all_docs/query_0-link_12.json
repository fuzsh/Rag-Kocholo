The new integrated FUSION + CCC GIS + ONUMA system expands the capabilities of the colleges to manage and plan their physical space more effectively and efficiently.\n\nMapping the California Community Colleges.\n\nCCC GIS provides a common repository for the various maps, documents, links, and other tools we are collecting in our ongoing work. The maps produced over time will help to answer questions important to the mission of the California Community Colleges, including questions about regional demographics and population growth, election histories and bond election planning, enrollment forecasting, enrollment patterns of neighboring districts, workforce development, facilities planning and maintenance, and more.\n\nCCC GIS Map\n\nAccess an interactive map of all 72 physical districts and 115 physical campuses that make up the California Community College system."
