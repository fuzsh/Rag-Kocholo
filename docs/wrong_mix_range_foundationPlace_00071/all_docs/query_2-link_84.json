        "text": "This category is for 3D content that is created using Esri software. The work should be displayed in a web scene or an interactive map that includes a web scene. Entries should evaluate the results of a 3D analysis, compare different 3D scenarios, or explore 3D environments.\n\nThe judges will be looking for innovative and creative 3D cartographic techniques; effective use of slides, labels, and pop‐ups; and an engaging and fulfilling user experience.\n\nEntries must be submitted as a web scene (or an interactive map with a web scene) that is hosted in ArcGIS Online. A URL to the live map must be provided. Each map is to be entered separately. Multiple entries are permitted.\n\nThis category is for maps and posters that describe an analysis completed entirely using Esri software or partner solutions that have Esri software as a foundation. The entry should identify the question of interest, the analytic methods, and the steps required to reproduce the workflow. The results of the analysis should be clearly displayed in map form with any required supporting graphics.\n\nThe judges will be looking for clear expressions of the purpose, the value of the method, and the quality of the results. Successful entries will exhibit a strong, logical design and a flow of information from which the intended audience can learn and apply the method themselves.\n\nEntries in this category can be submitted digitally or published online. For online submissions, a URL is required. Each map is to be entered separately. Multiple entries are permitted.\n\nThis category is for scientific posters in fields other than geographic information science (GIScience) that leverage GIS to perform a key aspect of mapping or analysis. The poster should include one or more maps that demonstrate the use of GIS and the analysis workflow where Esri software was applied. Minimally, Esri software must have been used to produce the map(s) and to perform at least one portion of the analysis.\n\nThe judges will be looking to see whether the poster has clear organization and a reading sequence that includes an introduction, the methodology, the results, and a conclusion. It should also possess strong visual appeal, display a consistent graphic design, and support the communication of science.\n\nPosters in this category may have been displayed within the past calendar year or soon will be displayed at another scientific conference (e.g., AGU, AAG, GSA). Within the description field of the submission form, entrants may optionally include a list of past meetings where the poster has been displayed.\n\nEntries in this category can be submitted digitally or published online. For online submissions, a URL is required. Each map is to be entered separately. Multiple entries are permitted.\n\nThis category is for maps produced for dashboard-style presentation, using ArcGIS Dashboards or ArcGIS for Power BI.\n\nThe judges will be looking for clean, intuitive layouts with maps and infographics that promote observation of spatial trends and dynamic patterns. The patterns and design must support effective decision-making by those familiar with the area of study as well as new stakeholders.\n\nEntries in this category must be published online. For each submission, a URL is required. Multiple entries are permitted.\n\nThis category is for work whose intended focus is to educate while incorporating GIS technology. In addition to maps, entries may include step‐by‐step instructions, explanatory text, diagrams, and illustrations. Entries in this category should identify a learning goal in terms of demonstrable skills or knowledge that a student will acquire.\n\nThe judges will be looking for evidence of how the intended student could achieve the learning goal and whether the type and style of the learning materials are clearly designed for the target student's age.\n\nEntries in this category can be presented as a set of instructional materials, shown digitally, or published online. To be published online, a URL is required. Each map is to be entered separately. Multiple entries are permitted.\n\nEntries in this category must consist of maps in a series or an atlas. A representative subset—rather than all maps from a series—should be submitted. A map series must be represented by three or more maps.\n\nThe judges will be looking for the overall appearance, the design of the individual maps, and the flow and continuity of the sequence of maps in the collection or atlas.\n\nEntries in this category can be submitted digitally or published online. For online submissions, a URL is required. Multiple entries are permitted.\n\nThe judges will be looking for an engaging story that includes maps, communicates clearly, and makes effective use of ArcGIS StoryMaps. The judges will also assess the design of the maps, the choice of basemaps, the design of interactivity (e.g., pop-ups), and how well supporting content and customizations are integrated into the narrative.\n\nEntries in this category must be submitted as an online product with a URL. Each story is to be entered separately. Multiple entries are permitted.\n\nThis category is for reference maps (sometimes called general‐purpose maps). Reference maps communicate the geographic character of the mapped area and the locations of natural and cultural features within its extent. Reference maps are not concerned with the statistical or quantitative attributes of mapped features.\n\nThe judges will be looking for the selection, classification, and generalization of features; the methods used to distinguish and prioritize features; and the quality of symbolization and labeling of features. Successful entries will also exhibit overall visual harmony, completeness, legibility, and clarity of the map with regard to the map scale, intended audience, and intended use.\n\nEntries in this category can be submitted digitally or published online. For online submissions, a URL is required. Each map is to be entered separately. Multiple entries are permitted.\n\nThere are three subcategories of student maps: entries from students up to 12 years old; from students 13–18 years of age; and from university and postgraduate students. Entries in the Student Map category can be from either an individual or a group—for example, a class‐based project in which many students participated. The focus of the entry should be a map. Entries should include and give credit to all students, teachers, supervisors, and leaders who participated in the work.\n\nThe judges will be looking for the overall graphical quality of the submission and clarity of communication of the map's topic, purpose, and intended audience. Maps will be judged relative to the age group with appropriate expectations.\n\nEntries in these categories can be submitted digitally or published online. For online submissions, a URL is required. Each map is to be entered separately. Multiple entries are permitted.\n\nThis category is for maps that feature the geographic distribution of one or more statistical variables (i.e., theme). These variables may be categorical or quantitative. The focus of these maps is the pattern or geographic distribution of features and their statistical values, which may or may not physically exist on the Earth.\n\nThe judges will be looking for clear and concise communication of the theme, appropriate geographic context, and supporting information. Successful entries will have titles that intuitively match the map's body, and each map will have a legend that efficiently conveys the meaning of symbols. Successful entries will also exhibit visual harmony, completeness, and legibility regarding the map scale, intended audience, and intended use.\n\nEntries in this category can be submitted digitally or published online. For online submissions, a URL is required. Each map is to be entered separately. Multiple entries are permitted.\n\nNew this year: All entries are automatically considered for this award.\n\nThis category is for creative, new, or experimental uses of Esri software. Entries should show the mapped theme in a graphically distinctive or constructively provocative way.\n\nThe judges will be looking for excellence in overall design, a creative combination of art and science, and the use of products that go beyond conventional cartographic expectations.\n\nEntries in this category can be submitted digitally or published online. For online submissions, a URL is required. Each map is to be entered separately. Multiple entries are permitted."
