        "text": "Everyone is welcome at a Red Cross shelter and all disaster assistance is free. We provide aid to all those in need, regardless of race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation or citizenship status. We don’t require people to show any kind of identification to enter a Red Cross shelter, just their name and where they were living before the disaster. The Red Cross is also committed to helping people with a wide range of needs, including people with disabilities and mental illnesses, whether they are children or seniors. If you need to leave your home due to a disaster or emergency, you are welcome to come to a Red Cross shelter.\n\nAll Red Cross shelters are accessible to people with disabilities. Your service animal is also welcome. Please speak with a shelter worker if your service animal is in need of food or supplies.\n\nEnsuring people have a safe place to stay during a disaster is a critical part of the Red Cross mission, but how we support sheltering efforts may be different in each community depending on local emergency plans and the scale of the disaster.\n\nIn most cases, every shelter we open will appear on the map above. However, in some communities, hotels or other approaches may still be more appropriate if the risk of COVID-19 is particularly high.\n\nIf asked to evacuate, listen to local officials for information about the nearest temporary evacuation point, where you will be provided information about emergency shelter options near you.\n\nIf it’s not safe for you to stay home, it’s not safe for your pet either. When possible, Red Cross shelter workers will do all they can to accommodate domesticated pets comfortably, however, depending on the situation, pets may need to be housed in a different location with support from animal welfare groups. Pet shelters are intended to accommodate animals that live in your home, such as dogs and cats, as well as small birds, rodents, fish, amphibians, and reptiles in enclosures. Please bring your pet(s) with you and a shelter worker will help you when you arrive.\n\nService animals are always welcome in Red Cross emergency shelters and are not considered pets.\n\nWe know you will be eager to return home as soon as the danger is over. In many cases, the Red Cross and our partners can help you do so: with clean up supplies; meal delivery to areas that lack power and water; and a case worker to help you access any available funding for your repair efforts.\n\nIf your home will not be ready right away, we will help you locate transitional housing. Red Cross shelters don’t close until all of our guests have a safe place to go!"
