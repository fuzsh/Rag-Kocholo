        "text": "The goal of the new Alliance is to build capacity to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with people, technology, and process.\n\nNEW YORK, USA, July 15, 2021. Based on the foundational principle of reducing inequalities of all kinds, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, Esri, the PVBLIC Foundation, and the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) Global Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM) Secretariat, this week during the SDG Media Zone (HLPF 2021), have officially launched the SDG Data Alliance, an open community-driven partnership whose work is grounded on the belief that data is a human right and that reducing inequalities of all kinds is fundamental to achieving all of the Sustainable Development Goals, and creating a just, healthy, and prosperous world where no one is left behind and everyone can thrive.\n\nA long-term universal threat to social and economic development, inequity hampers poverty reduction initiatives, destroys people’s sense of fulfillment and self-worth, and stunts every human’s potential. In September 2015, world leaders agreed to 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that have the power to create a better, more equitable world by 2030. Reducing inequality is the most important step countries can take to improve standards of living.\n\nUsing the power of purpose-driven collaboration, globally recognized geospatial frameworks, and leading GIS technology, this influential group of partners will accelerate achievement of the SDGs by creating 17 SDG Data Hubs across developing nations in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Based on geospatial frameworks and technology, the data hubs will assist developing countries in measuring, monitoring and reporting on their progress toward reducing inequality and will empower people to ensure inclusiveness and equality.\n\nSome of the countries to develop SDG Data Hubs are Brazil, Chile, Guatemala, Ghana, Honduras, Mexico, Rwanda, Senegal, St. Lucia, South Africa, Cameroon, Mozambique, Morocco, Philippines, Mongolia, Nepal, Indonesia, India, Fiji, Moldova, and Haiti.\n\nThe SDG Data Alliance will empower governments, businesses, and people to respond to and manage shared global challenges like poverty, inequality, and climate change.\n\nThe Alliance was launched during the United Nations’ High-Level Political Forum on sustainable development as part of an SDG Media Zone panel featuring Alix Cantave, Program Officer for Latin America & the Caribbean at WK Kellogg Foundation, Charles Brigham, Lead Account Manager Non-Profit & Global Organizations at Esri and Greg Scott, Inter-Regional Advisor, UN-GGIM, at the United Nations Statistics Division. The session, “Data for Good”, was moderated by CBS News Correspondent, Enrique Acevedo, and focused on why data partnerships are important and how geospatial data can be used to help developing countries achieve the SDGs. You can view the session here.\n\nSDG Data Hubs at Work. A Few Local Examples\n\nIreland and Gender Equality. Women are significantly outnumbered by men in both local and national politics in Ireland. The introduction of gender quota legislation before the 2016 General Elections produced an increase of 6.5 percentage points in female representation in those elections. The gender quota legislation did not apply in the 2019 Local Elections, which saw a smaller increase of 3.8 percentage points in the number of seats won by women. With SDG equity data, gender information, constituent and population information, and economic data help identify marginalized workers, economic and labor market opportunities, and gender balance in government.\n\nIraq and Health Access Inequity. A young pregnant woman living in an informal settlement in Iraq during COVID-19 pandemic may not have adequate water, sanitation, housing or access to healthcare facilities. With SDG equity data around water, healthcare and housing, gaps and patterns can be identified in context to build an infrastructure to keep this woman and her baby healthy during the pandemic.\n\nHaiti and Climate Justice. Haiti is extremely vulnerable to natural disasters with more than 90 percent of the population at risk. A young man makes his living and supports his family by selling fruit on the street during rush hour and at tourist destinations. Hurricane Irma nearly swept away his family’s home and his ability to go to school for a better economic potential. With SDG equity data around education, economic growth, climate, and agriculture, insights can be found and shared to provide this young man the opportunity to finish his education and build a more promising future for his family.\n\nThe SDG Data Alliance’s technology, expertise, and financial support will help countries around the world measure their progress in achieving global equity. Geospatial information and the collaborative efforts to collect and share SDG data are the foundation for connecting people to their location and environment. This alliance enables countries to more precisely allocate resources to address all forms of inequity - reducing inequalities of all kinds, including equity for women, reducing hunger, poverty, improving access to clean water and taking action to reduce the impact of climate change.\n\n“Together, we have a vision to build the capacity of communities, governments and NGOs to monitor their progress towards their goals,” said La June Montgomery Tabron, President and CEO of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. “At the heart of this partnership is the belief that people have the capacity to create the conditions for their children to thrive and for communities to become equitable places of opportunity. When communities see the full picture of what’s at play, it will only accelerate that change.”\n\n“Inequality threatens long-term social and economic development, and hampers poverty reduction initiatives, especially among vulnerable global communities,” said Jack Dangermond, Esri founder and president. “Open, community-driven partnerships like the SDG Data Alliance offer a framework to create a reporting environment that help communities see patterns and trends around issues like inequality. Our goal in this partnership is to enable the world to work more effectively together on reducing inequalities by leveraging geospatial technology to better understand and solve these challenges.”\n\n“ We have been advancing this concept for many years and it is remarkable to see this dream become a reality with so many global partners coming together,” said Sergio Fernandez de Cordova, Chairman of PVBLIC Foundation. “Our core mission at PVBLIC is to mobilize media, data, and technology to take action on the sustainable development goals and that’s what the SDG Data Alliance is all about. The partners assembled here are poised to rewrite history, around the role of data, in a post-pandemic world.”\n\n“Reducing Inequalities is fundamental to creating a just and prosperous world where no one is left behind and everyone can thrive,” said Michelle Gyles McDonnough, Director, Sustainable Development Unit, Executive Office of the Secretary-General at the United Nations. “It is essential that member states build up their capacity based on actionable data to measure and monitor their progress on the SDG 10 – Reducing Inequalities. The SDG Data Alliance is an example of a multistakeholder initiative that drives progress and offers innovative solutions. Greater universal equality among women and men, income groups and regardless of race and ethnicity will enable us to keep the promise to reach the goals by 2030.”\n\nVisit the SDG Data Alliance website: alliance.sdg.org\n\nMembers of the SDG Data Alliance have already helped many countries create, organize and implement their SDG Data Hubs including: Colombia, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico, State of Palestine, Philippines, Qatar, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nABOUT W.K.
