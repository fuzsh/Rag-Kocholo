        "text": "Overview\n\nThis geo services plugin allows applications to access Esri location based services using the Qt Location API. The use of these services is governed by the Esri terms of use.\n\nData is provided by many different content providers.\n\nThe Esri geoservices plugin can be loaded by using the plugin key \"esri\".\n\nYou can use the services provided by Esri's ArcGIS Platform by subscribing to the ArcGIS Developer Program, at no charge. See the \"Essentials\" plan details here: {https://developers.arcgis.com/pricing/}{ArcGIS Developer Program Pricing}.\n\nThe Developer subscription offers a free-of-charge option for developing and testing your applications. With this, your applications can go to production under the following conditions:\n\nThe app can request up to one million maps per month.\n\n50 credits are included with the Developer subscription. The costs are 40 credits for 1000 geocodes, and 0.5 credits per route generated. Place searches are free.\n\nThe app does not directly generate revenue. That is, end users must be able to obtain it and to use it for free.\n\nIf the above conditions cannot be met, the ArcGIS Online subscription is the correct choice, as it gives applications full access to the ArcGIS platform.\n\nParameters\n\nMandatory parameters\n\nTo use the routing services hosted on ArcGIS Online with the Esri plugin, a token is required. You can obtain a token for testing purposes, or you can sign up for an ArcGIS Online subscription.\n\nOptional parameters\n\nDirections language\n\nThe service supports generating directions in the following languages:\n\nIf only unsupported language codes are specified via the locales property, the service returns the directions using the default language, English.\n\nDirections length units"
