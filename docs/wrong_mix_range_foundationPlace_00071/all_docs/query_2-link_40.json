        "text": "Many persons are involved in our organization. They have different roles, different background and different ideas. In order to learn to know each other better, to synchronize our understanding of “our” ICA and to allow for taking on board all those rich ideas, perspectives and thoughts all Executive Committee Members, Commission Chairs and Co-Chairs, Working Group Chairs and further ICA officers met at the Technische Universität Wien in Vienna, Austria from 22.3.2024 to 24.3.2024 for an intense working meeting.\n\nThe agenda included several information presentations on issues of mutual concern, several group-works and workshops and simply time to meet, discuss and be part of ICA.\n\nIn the unique venue of the “Kuppelsaal” of the Technical University of Vienna we found enough space and inspiration to gather and work together.\n\nThe meeting started with an introduction from President Georg Gartner on the nature, aims and scope and mission of the International Cartographic Association. It is really the global voice for Cartography and GIScience and the motto “We love maps” is a common nominator for all of us.\n\nIn order to learn to know each other better we performed a group work, where we paired in two to be able to introduce always the other person accordingly.\n\nWe then collected ideas about the questions:\n\nWhat would you like to give to the ICA community?\n\nWhat would you like to get from ICA?\n\nwhich resulted in a long and rich list of relevant items.\n\nHaving set the tone for the meeting with this we then dived into several existing structures, instruments and elements of ICA, such as the ICA Webservices (presented by Webmaster Manuela Schmidt), the International Journal of Cartography (presented online from the Editors Anne Ruas and William Cartwright), the ICA Publication Regime (presented online from Publication Committee Chair Menno-Jan Kraak), the ICA Executive Committee (presented by President Georg Gartner and Secretary-General Thomas Schulz), the ICA Commissions and their Administration (presented by Secretary-General Thomas Schulz), the ICA Conferences (presented by Vice-President Serena Coetzee), the ICA memberships, MoUs and relations to other organisations (presented by Past-President Tim Trainor), the ICA Research Agenda (presented by Vice-President Haosheng Huang), the ICA Body of Knowledge (presented by Working Group Chair Terje Mitbo).\n\nInbetween further group interventions took place, refering to the idea of synchronizing our understanding of the core concept of our organization (What is a map?), identifying and presenting commission and working group plans and synergies (led by Vice-President Dusan Petrovic), a SWOT (Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threads) – Analysis of ICA (led by Vice-President Alex Kent), a open mic session on ideas and visions (led by Vice-Presidents Amy Griffin, Jiping Liu and Dariusz Dukaczewski).\n\nSocializing opportunities despite the amical, fruitful and constructive working atmosphere have been taken on a joined short “CartoWalk” around Karlsplatz and joined meals.\n\nThe event proofs my feeling right again, that ICA is really more like a family – it is such a privilege to be able to cooperate with so many bright, motivated, enthusiastic, fantastic scholars and persons!\n\nList of Participants\n\nExecutive Committee\n\nPresident: Georg Gartner\n\nPast President: Timothy Trainor\n\nSecretary-General and Treasurer: Thomas Schulz\n\nVice President: Serena Coetzee\n\nVice President: Dariusz Dukaczewski\n\nVice President: Amy Griffin\n\nVice President: Dusan Petrovic\n\nVice President: Haosheng Huang\n\nVice President: Alexander Kent\n\nVice President: Jiping Liu\n\nCommission Chairs and Co-Chairs\n\nArt and Cartography: Taien Ng-Chan\n\nAtlases: Vitek Vozenilek, Eric Losang\n\nCartographic Heritage into the Digital: Matyas Gede\n\nCartography and Children: Silvia Marinova\n\nCartography and Sustainable Development: Britta Ricker\n\nCartography in Early Warning and Crisis Mgmt: Christophe Lienert, Jie Shen\n\nCognitive Issues: Tumasch Reichenbacher, Pyry Kettunen, Petr Kubicek\n\nDigital Transformation of Mapping Agencies: Bin Jiang\n\nEducation and Training: Tao Wang\n\nEthics in Cartography: Aileen Buckley\n\nGeoAI: Samantha Arundel\n\nGeospatial Analysis and Modelling: Xintao Liu\n\nGeospatial Semantics and Ontology: Francis Harvey\n\nGeovisualization: Florian Ledermann, Arzu Cöltekin\n\nHigh-Definition Maps: Qingyun Du\n\nIntegrated Geospatial Information: Anja Hopfstock, Kathryn Arnold\n\nLocation Based Services: Jukka Krisp\n\nMap Design: Ian Muehlenhaus\n\nMap Projections: Krisztian Kerkovits\n\nMaps and the Internet: Otakar Cerba\n\nMarine Cartography: Ron Furness, Lysandros Tsoulos\n\nMountain Cartography: Patrick Kennelly\n\nMulti-scale Cartography: Guillaume Touya, Izabela Karsznia\n\nTopographic Mapping: David Forrest, Lukas Halik\n\nToponomy: Matjaz Gersic\n\nUbiquitious Mapping: Toru Ishikawa, Angela Schwering, Armand Kapaj\n\nUser Experiences: Robert Roth\n\nWorking Group Chairs and Co-Chairs\n\nNext Generation Cartographers: Katarzyna Slomska-Przech, Chelsea Nestel\n\nInclusive Cartography: Jakub Wabinski, Vincent van Altena\n\nBody of Knowledge: Terje Mitbo\n\nThe EuroCarto 2024 conference will take place from 9—11.9.2024 at Vienna, Austria. This conference will again see more then 180 contributions in oral presentations, posters and exhibitions demonstrating the wide range and contemporary character of cartography.\n\nA number of pre-conference workshops are offered on Sunday, September 8, 2024 at TU Wien for the conference participants, covering a wide range of contemporary and highly relevant topics of cartography to be discussed in an interactive manner. I am sure there is something interesting for every cartographer included!\n\nBarrier-Free Cartography\n\nThe ICA’s Working Group on Inclusive Cartography was established earlier this year to continue and extend the work of the former Commission on Maps and Graphics for Blind and Partially Sighted People. The primary objective of this working group is to advance the accessibility of cartographic products to all users and communities.\n\nThe idea is that special needs are not strictly related to physical aspects, and can also be related to social and educational aspects. These are also reflected in the UN’s SDGs that aim to “…ensuring that no one is left behind…”. Individuals with special needs remain underrepresented in the field of cartography. This underrepresentation may stem from the intricate and nuanced nature of their requirements, coupled with the need for highly tailored solutions. But what exactly are their needs? How can we define, develop, and promote barrier-free cartography, and who are the users that will benefit from accessible maps? We aim to provide a forum to address these questions and provide answers during the barrier-free cartography workshop.\n\nBuilding the road to AI – how cartography links data integration, meaning and geospatial knowledge transmission\n\nAll countries need geospatial information to address their national strategic priorities. However, all countries have different levels of geospatial maturity. The United Nations Integrated Geospatial Information Framework (UN-IGIF) provides a basis and guide for developing, integrating and strengthening national arrangements in geospatial information management.\n\nIn this workshop, hosted by the ICA Commission on Integrated Geospatial Information for Cartography and Commission on Topographic Mapping, you will learn more about the development and activities of the UN-GGIM and UN-IGIF, how countries across Europe can adopt and implement the framework, how data can be provided via national Geoportals and how cartography builds the road to AI.\n\nCollaborative mapping of commissions beyond the International Cartographic Association (ICA)\n\nThis workshop will allow participants to critically evaluate a landscape of map conceptions shaped by the ICA commissions. Drawing upon the work of the Iconoclasistas collective, the conception of a map as a collaborative practice will be explored. Through participatory methods, this workshop will reveal cartographic spaces where the ICA has yet to venture, both geographically and epistemologically.\n\nIndoor location-based services (Indoor LBS)\n\nThe research on indoor LBS is not trivial. On the one hand, its design closely depends on both indoor themes (e.g., airports, shopping malls) and target users (e.g., passengers under time pressure, visually impaired customers). Therefore, there is a huge need to investigate the indoor LBS requirements and guarantee its usability. On the other hand, the emergence of agents, such as air drones and service robots, results in more diverse indoor LBS with various indoor map formats, including floor plans, BIM models, depth images, and point clouds. However, this is also challenging to communicate indoor spatial information among different agents and collaboratively provide indoor LBS for human users as well as other agents. The workshop is organized by the ICA Commission on Location Based Services.\n\nMapping Future Courses: Bridging Old and New in Cartographic Education for Europe\n\nThe ICA Commission on Education and Training, the ICA WG on Cartographic Body of Knowledge, and the ICA Commission on Digital Transformation of National Mapping Agencies are organizing a workshop, Mapping Future Courses: Bridging Old and New in Cartographic Education for Europe. The workshop brings together experts to share their latest thoughts and best practices on how to include new digital technologies and tools in cartographic education, including GIS, remote sensing and geomatics education. It will be a combination of oral presentations and live discussions.\n\nMultiperspective Cartography in Conflict Visualisation\n\nThis workshop explores approaches, potentials and limitations of visualising multiple perspectives in peace and conflict cartography. It addresses complexities and uncertainties in how maps politicise space, and challenges in integrating critical perspectives in day-to-day cartographic research and practice. The engagement of maps with multiple perspectives is expected to enable discussions on scientific authority, transparency, and trustworthiness, as well as inclusion of bottom up and personal perspectives. The workshop takes up a reflective practice approach, starting from discussing existing examples of multiperspectivity in maps and visualisations (via short presentations). From there, participants work in groups on collecting and reviewing cartographic practices that engage with multiple perspectives in terms of both map analysis and production. The workshop aims to deliver an outline of a multiperspective approach to visualising peace and conflict, with the ambition of gathering a cartographic community around the topic.\n\nOnline User Experiments: Seeing What Map Users See without Seeing Them\n\nThis workshop is designed for researchers, practitioners, and students interested in conducting online user experiments in cartography with a special focus on webcam eye tracking to study map users’ behavior. Building up from a previous ICA workshop on “Workshop on Adaptable Research Methods For Empirical Research with Map Users”, we aim to collaboratively explore the possibilities and boundaries of the current state of conducting online experiments to inform cartographic practice and map use. This workshop represents the joint efforts of the ICA Commissions on Geovisualization and User Experience (UX).\n\nParticipatory mapping – new approaches and technologies\n\nParticipatory mapping, a widely employed geographical method across disciplines, remains relatively underexplored within the International Cartographic Association. This workshop seeks to introduce three distinct participatory mapping apps/approaches: an in-situ participatory mobile app, a web-based participatory mapping tool, and a paper-based “paper2GIS” style app. Each method has the potential to target diverse groups and serve different mapping purposes.\n\nStorytelling with Geographical Visualization\n\nThis workshop explores how we express and communicate a current issue to a wide audience by visualizing geographical data. After an introductory talk on the implementation of cartographic design principles in data journalism (20 min), groups of participants will be given the task of devising a method for mapping a current issue using datasets, contextual maps, and drawing materials provided (70 min). After the activity, participants will be encouraged to feedback on their approach and discuss their decisions over the methods of representation chosen (30 min). The workshop provides an opportunity to discuss ways of visualizing data within the context of a current issue and by deliberately eliminating the need for technical skills in particular software. The workshop is therefore designed to maximise inclusivity (encouraging multinational and transgenerational participation) and to allow a greater focus on the process of creativity in exploring approaches to cartographic representation.\n\nThe Future of Atlases\n\nIn this workshop, hosted by the ICA Commission on Atlases, we want to rethink atlases and develop new approaches to both atlas production and atlas research – focal points of the Atlas Commission’s work. We believe it’s about recombining content structures, technical developments, geographical information and the re-organisation of knowledge. We would like to approach this by answering the following questions:\n\nWhat will be the elements (or aspects) of an atlas of the future?\n\nHow will atlases of the future be technically realised?\n\nWhat other aspects need to be taken into account in the future?\n\nWhat research topics need to be focused to scientifically support these points?\n\nWeb Cartography Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence\n\nThe main goal of the workshop is to promote knowledge sharing and collaboration among experts and stakeholders in the field of AI-enabled web cartography, to inspire participants to develop innovative solutions and projects in the field and to promote advancement in web cartography education through the responsible use of AI. During the interactive workshop, we will share experiences, challenges and examples of good practice in this dynamically developing field. The workshop will take the form of an interactive discussion to encourage active participation of all participants.\n\nThis workshop is organized by the Chair of the ICA Commission on Maps and the Internet.\n\nOne workshop will already take place on Saturday, Septemer 7 in Warsaw, Poland:\n\nICA Workshop on AI, Geovisualization, and Analytical Reasoning\n\nThis workshop is intended to relate to supporting geovisualization and analytical reasoning, including approaches that leverage AI methods applied at various stages: data processing, analysis, visualization generation and interpretation, as well as support in user perception interpretation.\n\nFor more details on the workshop in Warsaw, visit the CartoVis24 website.\n\nFor more details on all EuroCarto 2024 workshops, visit eurocarto2024.org/workshop-programme\n\nThe 13th ICA Mountain Cartography Workshop, organized by the Commission on Mountain Cartography (CMC), was held April 3-7, 2024 at the base of Poland’s Tatra Mountains.\n\nWorkshops are usually held biennially, alternating with the International Cartographic Conferences (ICC). This year, CMC workshop got back on this traditional schedule, after the 12th ICA CMC Workshop in the Colorado Rockies needed to be rescheduled twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was originally scheduled for April 2020, then initially rescheduled to April 2022, and finally convened in April of 2023.\n\nThe workshop organizer was Rafał Jońca of AMG Maps. CMC Chair Patrick Kennelly supported the team in preparation of the workshop, and previous workshop organizer Tom Patterson and ICC liaison Dušan Petrovič provided plenty of logistical support. Tom Patterson was especially helpful in building the web site for the workshop, as well as answering numerous questions about how we could recreate the success of the Colorado 2022 ICA CMC workshop. We selected Limba Grand & Resort as the workshop venue because of its proximity to Krakow, Poland (about three hours away by train or car), and for its beautiful mountain setting. Limba Grand & Resort is near the city of Zakopane and within easy reach of the Tatra Mountains that serve as the southern border of Poland with Slovakia.\n\nThe workshop had 36 participants from Poland, Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Croatia, India, New Zealand, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Switzerland, and the United States. Five of the participants were female and five were students.\n\nThe theme of this year’s workshop was “Mapping Mountains in a New Era” to focus on how we approach mapping mountains, and how this focus may change in the coming years. The workshop featured 23 presentations grouped into 7 sessions. Rafał Jońca organized the program and was flexible in accommodating the needs of speakers both before and during the workshop. He asked several younger participants to chair sessions with the goal of making them feel welcome and involved.\n\nThe workshop began on Wednesday evening with welcoming remarks from Rafał Jońca and Patrick Kennelly.\n\nThis was followed by a social time in our spacious dining room, which the Limba Grand & Resort allowed us to use in addition to our meeting and recreation rooms. A downstairs great room provided access to pool, ping pong, and foosball tables for evening recreation. Nearby was a third room we had available to us for social gathering. Our meeting room had all the needed equipment for presentations, and also served as a map and poster gallery.\n\nThursday and Saturday were devoted to presentations covering a variety of topics related to mountain cartography. Presentations were either 10 or 20 minutes in length. Thursday evening after dinner opened with shorter Avalanche Talks by presenters who discussed their poster contributions. This year, all five Avalanche Talks were given by undergraduate students from Middlebury College in Vermont, USA who completed their posters as part of a Senior Seminar with their professor, Jeff Howarth, who unfortunately was not able to attend. Many participants noted these beautifully designed and thought-provoking posters, along with the interesting and engaging overviews from the students’ Avalanche Talks, as a highlight of the conference. This session was followed by the CMC business meeting which was run by CMC Chair Patrick Kennelly.\n\nFriday was the Field Study Day. The purpose is for participants to get to know both the beautiful mountain setting of the Tatras and one another better in a more informal manner. Participants had three options. Rafał Jońca led a cultural tour of Zakopane and its environs, including city center of Zakopane, with a focus on local wooden architecture in Zakopane’s style and an old cemetery of Zakopane. The tour also included a funicular to a stunning view of the Tatras and Zakopane. After organizing transportation to the nearby Tatra National Park for all interested participants, Dušan Petrovič led a field study to the iconic Morskie Oko, while Charly Kriz led other participants on a hike to a spectacular viewpoint of the Tatras.\n\nUpon returning to the Grand Limba & Resort, the last activity on Friday was the always challenging mountain trivia quiz hosted by Tom Patterson. The winning team (Alex Fries, Karel Kriz, Dušan Petrovič, Ondrej Prochazka, and Silviu Bumbak) scored 20 out of 27 possible points.\n\nThe workshop continued on Saturday with additional presentations. Also, Dušan Petrovič, our liaison on the ICA Executive Committee, provided an overview of the ICA and other items that were of interest to the CMC attendees. He also presented two attendees with Young Scientist Scholarships to assist in their travel costs, Madeline Grubb from the United States and Shekhar Kumar from India.\n\nThe workshop concluded Saturday evening with a night out in Zakopane at the Góralski Browar, a fun and festive conclusion to the workshop.\n\nThe workshop program, CMC business meeting notes, and other information are available on the CMC website at https://mountaincartography.icaci.org, and all photos in this report are courtesy of Charly Kriz and Dušan Petrovič.\n\nRafał Jońca, Patrick Kennelly, and Dušan Petrovič\n\nSome weeks before the United Nations calls for the Fourteenth Session of the United Nations Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management, 7-9 August 2024, UNHQ, New York, I would like to take the opportunity to highlight the mutual connections, cooperation and contributions between UN entities and ICA.\n\nSeveral entities and institutions of the UN are related to the aims and scope of ICA, this is why we take a great interest and pro-active view on cooperation and mutual interests. Derived from the general need of an international meta organization like the UN for spatial information in reliable manner has become more and more relevant. The saying “everything happens somewhere” can be applied to every global issue or crisis. The need to become aware about “what is happening somewhere”, to get tailored information, to underpin decisions asks very often for maps, cartography and GIScience.\n\nIt is therefore not a surprise, that ICA is taking a strong interest in related UN Activities, as the respective UN entities benefit from ICA involvement. The eventually most visible example of this involvement was the joined book publication “Mapping for a sustainable world” of UN and ICA.\n\nLet me introduce some of the main UN bodies, we are cooperating with:\n\nUnited Nations Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM)\n\nThis is an entity to promote international cooperation in the field of global geospatial information, for consulting governments in the context of making joint decisions and setting directions with regard to the production, availability, and application of geospatial information within national, regional, and global policy frameworks. All member states of the UN can participate, but also “Thematic Networks” are represented, including geospatial societies, academic network, private sector network and the UN Geospatial Network.\n\nICA is actively participating in UN-GGIM since its inauguration by\n\nParticipating at the UN-GGIM yearly sessions\n\nParticipating in some of the so called “High Level Forums of UN-GGIM\n\nTaking a strong interest in main outcomes and results of UN-GGIM work, such as the Integrated Geospatial Information Framework (IGIF) or the UN Centres of Excellence\n\nSeveral ICA-related scholars are actively working with UN-GGIM. I would like to highlight especially the ongoing role of Past President Timothy Trainor, which has and is substantially involved in steering the UN-GGIM agenda in several consultative ways\n\nAcademic Network of UN-GGIM\n\nThis is a network of universities and scholars trying to contribute to the agenda of UN-GGIM for an academic perspective, focusing on the role of research and education. ICA is traditionally well presented in the Academic Network, former President Menno-Jan Kraak was a board member, current president Georg Gartner is currently Board Member.\n\nUN-GGIM Geospatial Societies\n\nThe UN-GGIM Geospatial Societies is a coalition of the Presidents, Secretaries-General or equivalent office bearers or their nominees that lead recognized international organizations involved in the coordination, development, management, standardization or regulation of geospatial information and related matters, trying to support the agenda of UN-GGIM.\n\nICA is highly involved in work of this entity, I would like to highlight especially the instrumental role of former president William Cartwright in forming and establishing this group.\n\nOffice of Outer Space Affairs, United Nations (OOSA)\n\nA Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed March 2005 in Vienna by Milan Konecny (ICA President) and Sergio Camacho-Lara (UNOOSA Executive Director) is in place. This has led to mutual contacts e.g presentations and internships for students.\n\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO)\n\nICA is an official partner of UNESCO as recognized Non-governmental organization (NGO) and as such fully included in the communication of UNESCO activities and policies as entitled to participate in UNESCO activities.\n\nUnited Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNGEGN)\n\nThe objectives of this entity are\n\nencourage national and international geographical names standardization;\n\npromote the international dissemination of nationally standardized geographical names information; and\n\nadopt single romanization systems for the conversion of each non-Roman writing system to the Roman alphabet.\n\nICA was and is always prominently participating in the work of UNGEGN, I would like to explicitly mention her the significant input of the former secretary-general Ferjan Ormeling or the former Commission Chair Peter Jordan. Currently Matjaž Geršič is the chair from the ICA side of the Joint ICA/IGU Commission on Toponymy, a joint venture of ICA and IGU committed to fostering cartographic and geographical research in toponymy supplementary to UNGEGN.\n\nIn a truly unique effort, the book “Mapping for a Sustainable World” was co-published by the International Cartographic Association and the United Nations in 2021 as an open access document according to the CC BY-NC license, authored by Menno-Jan Kraak, Robert Roth, Britta Ricker, Ayako Kagawa and Guillaume Le Sourd. Drawing from cartography, the book offers guidelines for mapping geographic datasets related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by introducing basic principles of map design and use, discussing established best practices and conventions, and explaining how different mapping techniques support understanding of the SDGs.\n\nThe English language is available here:\n\nWeb version: https://www.un-ilibrary.org/content/books/9789216040468\n\nPrint version: https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3898826?ln=en&v=pdf\n\nAs the book embarks on the highly relevant topic of making the Sustainable Development Goals tangible and accessible through maps, translations in other languages was an immediate demand. The French version is titled “Cartographier pour un monde durable” and can be found here:\n\nWeb version: https://www.un-ilibrary.org/content/books/9789210024419\n\nThe Japan Cartographers Association (JCA) has picked the idea up to make the book available also in Japanese language. In a tremendous effort under the leadership of Dr. Momoko Yoshida and strategic guidance from Dr. Hiroshi Ota, Professor Takashi Morita and many more eminent cartographers in Japan, the book is now available and will be disseminated as print and online version in the upcoming months.\n\nTo me, this is another fantastic example of the enormous relevance of cartography and maps in the context of Sustainable Development Goals, which now becomes easily accessible for all Japanese-speaking interested persons!\n\nThis translation project has allowed the ICA and UN editorial team to draft a “MSW Translation Principles and Style Guide” to facilitate the translation process for JCA, and in case there are other ICA National Members and Affiliated Members who are interested to embark such a project in other languages in future. The documentation is intended to facilitate some best practices to ensure the quality and integrity of the spirit of the original version. Please contact the Publication Committee of ICA if you are interested in the “MSW Translation Principles and Style Guide”."
