        "text": "By Jeff Allen and Tom Coolidge\n\nWe are excited that Esri has added a Pipeline Referencing Foundation to its ArcGIS Solutions suite.\n\nGas and hazardous liquids pipeline operators need to answer more questions than ever from stakeholders about their pipe network and how it operates. ArcGIS provides industry-specific capabilities that facilitate a pipeline operator’s creating and maintaining the data needed to answer these questions.\n\nThree of those industry-specific capabilities are highlighted in this blog. Two of them are software capabilities that enable the building of pipeline models and maintaining the assets within them. These are the ArcGIS Pipeline Referencing (APR) extension and the ArcGIS Utility Network Management extension. Both extensions are intended to be further extended by Esri partners and customers to provide even more advanced functionality.\n\nThe third component is the Utility and Pipeline Data Model (UPDM). UPDM is a template data model used to store data related to everything from the wellhead to the customer meter. While the Pipeline Referencing Foundation is configured to be used with the UPDM templates, Esri pipeline data maintenance software tools were designed to be data model agnostic. APR, and soon the Utility Network can be equally well implemented in a PODS (Pipeline Open Data Standard) environment.\n\nThe business requirements of some pipeline operators lead them to implement all three capabilities – UPDM, APR, and the Utility Network. Others find that modeling their assets as linear features only is sufficient for their regulatory compliance and business needs. The Pipeline Referencing Foundation is intended for that latter group of pipeline operators who wish to only implement APR as a standalone solution.\n\nThe Pipeline Referencing Foundation was created to accelerate the deployment of an APR and UPDM implementation. By utilizing this solution in your ArcGIS organization, you get the key information products in one easy-to-use package (applications, forms, projects, maps, feature layers, feature layer views, and so on).\n\nThe Pipeline Referencing Foundation is delivered as a zipped file with an ArcGIS Pro project package with tasks, a file geodatabase configured for APR with sample data, and publishing and editor maps.\n\nYou can learn more about this most recent addition to the ArcGIS Solutions suite at:\n\nhttps://www.arcgis.com/apps/solutions/index.html?gallery=true&industry=Pipeline&solution=px5h08vjpiab1tds3a0vjg0cqidv2q7m&sortField=relevance&sortOrder=desc#home\n\nAbout ArcGIS Pipeline Referencing\n\nFor those not familiar with ArcGIS Pipeline Referencing, here is a brief introduction. APR provides industry-specific extensions to ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Enterprise that manage and locate specific points and parts on or around pipe networks.\n\nThe extension uses linear referencing to define locations of features along the pipe system. Linear referencing is a language that expresses pipeline attribute and event locations in terms of measurements along a pipeline, from a defined starting point.\n\nThe location model in the APR extension is established by the sequence of measures along a section of the pipe network defined as a route. These measurements can be a continuous network, which is a sequence of strictly increasing or decreasing measures along an unbroken non-branching run of physical pipe. Or the measurements can be a more complex engineering network. An engineering network can be composed of multiple routes logically grouped together in lines that can increase or decrease in measure as traversed. Equation points are used at locations where one route ends and another route starts.\n\nManagement of the routes is performed through an ArcGIS Pro ribbon, shown in Figure 1. This enables the creation, realignment, reassignment, retirement, extension, and cartographic realignment of routes using a context-based toolbar. It also enables the editing of calibration points and centerlines.\n\nFigure 1 – The APR Toolbar\n\nPoint and linear event data editing is performed within a delivered web application compatible with your Enterprise Portal. This enables owners of specific event layers of data to be able to manage their own content, without inadvertently also being enabled to edit the event layers managed by others.\n\nAPR allows users to automate route geometry and event alignment. Rule-based location management allows you to define how event measures and route associations should react to changes or edits. You can arrange to preserve event position (x,y coordinates) and allow m-values to change, preserve event location (measure values) and allow x,y values to change, or preserve both historical position and location prior to the effective date of the route edit.\n\nOften, the vast amount of information a pipeline operator deals with is diverse and distributed throughout the organization in multiple, disparate systems, each with its own linear referencing system (LRS). APR makes it possible for pipeline operators to integrate data from multiple LRS networks, maintained with multiple measurement systems, to get a single, comprehensive view of their pipeline.\n\nFigure 2 – Dynamic Segmentation\n\nAPR also provides dynamic segmentation functionality. Dynamic segmentation is the process of computing the map locations of linearly referenced data (for example, event attributes stored in a table) on demand, so they can be displayed on a map, queried, and analyzed using a GIS. The dynamic segmentation process enables multiple sets of attributes to be associated with any portion of a line feature without segmenting the underlying feature. A dynamic segmentation example is shown in Figure 2.\n\nNext Step\n\nThe Pipeline Referencing Foundation can help pipeline operators wanting to accelerate their implementation of APR on UPDM. We encourage you to check it out and let us know if you have any questions or further information needs.\n\nAlso, please know that there is a companion Gas and Pipeline Referencing Utility Network Foundation for gas utilities and pipeline operators wanting to accelerate their implementation of all three capabilities – APR, ArcGIS Utility Network, and UPDM. Further information on this companion foundation can be found at:\n\nhttps://www.arcgis.com/apps/solutions/index.html?gallery=true&industry=Pipeline&solution=978b5cfb5bc0419d8c64d290edbd2037&sortField=relevance&sortOrder=desc#home\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The postings on this site are our own and don’t necessarily represent Esri’s position, strategies, or opinions."
