        "text": "Generating Maps for Situational Awareness\n\nStandard mapping techniques will produce informative visualizations and provide orientation for studying the location, the physical attributes of the investigation area, and descriptive characteristics of the population(s) of interest. Field staff should begin by creating general reference maps (1,2). Google Maps (Google, Inc., Mountain View, CA), OpenStreetMap (an open-source wiki software by the OpenStreetMap Foundation), or county geographic files serve as reasonable starting points. These maps can include information about road networks, hotels, airports, and other points of interest to familiarize the field team with the area in which it will be investigating the disease or injury occurrence. Reference maps can be useful in both domestic and international settings, especially in unfamiliar areas.\n\nAdditionally, such maps are useful for establishing the boundaries of the investigation area (2–4). Using geographic information science, systems, or software (collectively known as GIS), boundaries can be drawn for the area of interest and from which specific GIS data files, known as shapefiles, can be created (2,4,5). These boundary files can then be used to evaluate variables of interest (e.g., estimating the number of persons residing within a particular area or examining the extent of contamination from a harmful exposure) (Figure 17.1).\n\nIdentifying and Acquiring Pertinent Supplemental Data\n\nTime permitting, the field team might consider gathering pertinent data sets useful beyond general reference data. For example, incorporating such sociodemographic characteristic data as population counts, age, sex, race/ethnicity, sensitive populations, language/translation needs, and measures of poverty by specific state, county, or other census boundaries is possible by using US Census data (Figure 17.2). The US Census Bureau makes these data available with a unique geographic identifier, thereby enabling easy association between the population data and the location data in GIS (6).\n\nUnderstanding the influence of the natural and built environment is possible with GIS (1–3). For example, exploring the distribution of persons in communities and neighborhoods, school locations, childcare facilities, or senior living facilities relative to the locations of industry might prove key to the investigation. During a natural disaster or a chemical release, imagery can be useful for understanding the extent of damage, to track population movements, and to guide the planning and logistics of travel for fieldwork. Furthermore, identifying transportation routes and locations of public utilities might be pertinent to understanding potential transmission modes (Figure 17.3).\n\nGIS can be a principal resource for generating a sampling plan. By using GIS, investigators can select homes or areas within communities for sampling activities (Figure 17.4).\n\nSimilarly, investigators can use road network data to develop optimized routes for data collection. Before fieldwork in Panama, for example, researchers used GIS to characterize varying levels of forestation adjacent to villages for study site selection (7). Additionally, the researchers used maps to determine each village’s accessibility.\n\nDepending on the study area’s location (i.e., domestic vs. international), different levels of data might be available. In domestic situations, current and historic data from the US Census Bureau and satellite imagery may be readily available. This might also be true in certain international settings; however, obtaining this information before deployment might be difficult. In those instances, investigators might need to rely on dated or minimally detailed information before beginning fieldwork. Under these circumstances, the team should consider collecting pertinent data after arriving at the location.\n\nSelecting GIS Software and Equipment\n\nBoth commercial and open-source GIS packages offer useful software options (4,8). Additionally, statistical software packages with spatial analysis capabilities exist. When selecting a GIS package, the user should consider data collection, analysis, and visualization needs, as well as available technical and financial resources, in determining which package is most feasible.\n\nDeveloping GIS Capacity\n\nThe beginning of the investigation is often the best time to collaborate with a GIS subject matter expert (SME) because that person can provide advice regarding pertinent maps, data, and analysis plans. Engaging GIS SMEs from the beginning can also build GIS capacity among the field team. During 2017, for example, a team from the Center for Global Health of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collaborated with GIS SMEs in the Geospatial Research, Analysis, and Services Program to determine the best methods for collecting, storing, and analyzing locations where sex workers were active in Papua, New Guinea (9). That collaboration resulted in a plan to determine locations to conduct the surveys, to implement methods for collecting location data, and to enable spatial data analysis, which led to development of an interactive mapping tool. After completion, not only were relevant data collected, but the team began to develop internal GIS capacity.\n\nSummary\n\nGeneral reference maps can provide situational awareness.\n\nMaps can be useful for setting the boundaries of the investigation area.\n\nMaps can be instrumental in developing a sampling plan.\n\nPublicly available data (e.g., US Census Bureau and health outcome data) can be mapped and evaluated for the particular area of interest.\n\nImagery data also might be informative, especially when attempting to assess damage from natural disasters.\n\nInviting GIS SMEs to participate in the planning process can build field team capacity.\n\nCollecting and Geocoding Location Data\n\nThe street address at the time of disease diagnosis, whether a residence or common establishment, is usually part of routine data collection efforts; however, remembering that location information should be collected in a standardized format is crucial (3). After collection, these data can be converted into points or shapes for mapping, a process known as geocoding (3,12,13). Providing specific instructions for collecting complete and accurate address information can influence correct point placement (3,12).\n\nThe field team can determine early on the preferred method for collecting geographic coordinates during data collection in the field (2). Given inconsistencies in complete and accurate address data availability, variability in geocoding software accuracy, and the wide availability of handheld global positioning system (GPS) devices, collecting GPS coordinates might prove better than address data. Additionally, obtaining address-level data for analysis in international settings can be challenging, especially in remote locations where standardized addresses may not be available for data collection or for the geocoding process. For example, throughout the Ebola virus disease epidemic during 2014–2016, infection spread rapidly. In one particularly remote village, the rapid identification of infected persons and their isolation was essential for limiting transmission. During that fieldwork, the investigator was able to use a GPS device to collect the latitude and longitude of each household location while collecting interview data (14). Having these household locations enabled spatiotemporal analysis of transmission risk factors. Without the point locations, examining risk factors at the household level may not have been possible.\n\nIn addition to GPS data, network location information from a cellular device might be used to identify location. Today, almost any standard cellular device can generate geographic data. In one instance of fieldwork in Africa, the field investigators used the geotagging function on their cellular phones to take pictures inside their pockets to document their locations.\n\nBeyond Points on a Map\n\nA common misconception is that location can represent only a single position. Collecting spatial data in formats other than points (e.g., lines or polygons) is additionally informative (2–4). Moreover, certain spatial data can represent abstract ideas (e.g., activity space) (15,16). Activity space can include places of employment, houses of worship, residences, restaurants, points of food purchase, recreational areas, friends’ residences, and anywhere else the persons of interest might have frequented. Therefore, when in the field, an investigator should not be limited to recording a street address or assigning a single georeference point.\n\nVisualizing distribution points of contaminated products through road network data can be informative during the case identification process. Other spatial data that might be of interest reflect the movement of materials between facilities and the points of interaction with affected populations. Food products can undergo a lengthy trip from production or harvesting to the consumer and every location along the route. Even the route itself can be a source of risk. Processing locations (e.g., water treatment plants or heating, ventilation, and air conditioning handlers) also can be sources of risk. Collecting data about the locations of and connections between these networks can aid the team’s understanding of the risk factors.\n\nIn addition, GIS and location information can be useful in understanding the impact of specific interventions or changes in the natural or built environment. For example, in Atlanta, Georgia, GIS and location information was used to study possible health impacts to residents resulting from the development of a city “Beltline” to improve urban walkability and enhance active commuting (17,18). Field data collection efforts included location and measurement of sidewalk characteristics, walkability, and aesthetics (Figure 17.7). Data were collected for specific road segments, mapped, and spatially analyzed to examine the possible impact of the “BeltLine” on local residents’ health.\n\nSummary\n\nGIS can be used to specify the place associated with the case definition.\n\nGIS can be informative for planning field data collection methods.\n\nThe type of analysis will influence spatial data needs and spatial data collection tools.\n\nGeographic-level data collected during fieldwork will affect the specificity of visualization and the spatial statistical methods during analysis.\n\nField investigators should think beyond collection of latitude and longitude, point-level data.\n\nCharacterizing the Geographic and Sociodemographic Distribution of Disease\n\nOften, the first look at the data involves creating a map visualizing the disease distribution. Maps can comprise points representing the location of each case or display the geographic distribution of rates or changes in the distribution of counts or rates across time (1–3,8). Both count and rate data can be aggregated to different geographic units (e.g., census tracts, counties, or zip codes). The technique known as choropleth mapping visualizes the intensity of the counts or rates by using boundary aggregations (Figure 17.8) (1–3,8). Selecting classification breakpoints and color schemes are chief considerations (8,19).\n\nAnalyses do not have to be restricted to commonly used geopolitical boundaries. For example, mapping the accumulation of cases among homes within a village might be useful. With this information, choropleth maps of the number of cases, or rates, within each home can be compared with the quantity in other homes within the study area. Another possibility is for the map to represent the location of cases in rooms in a building (e.g., in a hospital or nursing home).\n\nGIS Operations and Their Utility\n\nPoint-level analyses of cases can provide an overview of the extent of disease distribution. Point-level data also are needed for evaluating spatial clustering of disease. Alternatively, service area or activity space analyses can help characterize the extent of disease distribution on a more relative and temporal scale. As previously mentioned, another advantage of GIS is incorporating other spatially related information into the analysis, thus providing context for disease patterns and insights regarding place-based risk factors. For example, during the 2016 Flint, Michigan, shigellosis outbreak, cases were aggregated by census area for reporting and visualization. In doing so, the team was able to examine the case rates in relation to reported water-quality events, thus leading to more in-depth spatial analysis (20).\n\nProviding Context with Supplemental Data\n\nAnalyzing supplemental data (e.g., environmental or infrastructure data) enables further contextualization of the public health problem. For example, during the investigation of elevated lead levels in Flint, Michigan, water supply system data were important for understanding the common source of contamination and identifying particularly vulnerable populations (i.e., child residents). Similarly, waterline information was used to model chlorine residuals to understand a later outbreak of shigellosis in the same area (20).\n\nAnother resource is remotely sensed data. Remotely sensed data can include aerial and satellite images, or they can be data collected by sensors on satellites orbiting in space (2). Remote sensing techniques can aid in locating key geographic features or monitoring change across time. Imagery can be particularly useful in preparing for responses to natural disasters by providing an aerial view of environmental and infrastructural damage and stranded populations. For example, after Hurricane Harvey’s landfall in Texas in 2017, field investigators analyzed satellite imagery to predict and prevent mold exposure. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, satellite imagery was used to locate stranded populations and to identify the locations to which affected residents were moving to find shelter. During the 2016–2017 Zika virus infection response in Puerto Rico, spectral signature remote sensing techniques were used to locate standing water, which served as a breeding ground for Aedies egypti mosquitos potentially carrying the Zika virus (Figure 17.9).\n\nVisualizing Disease Across Time\n\nGIS can be used to visualize disease progression, changing concentrations, or distribution of risk factors across time. Static map series, linked interactive micromaps, and animations are methods for such visualization. An animation of the spread of Ebola virus infection among households and the institution of household-wide and village-wide isolation and quarantine efforts in Sierra Leone was particularly informative in understanding the outbreak’s epidemiologic curve (14). New tools are also being developed to visualize the slope of an epidemiologic curve for every geographic unit within a study area. As the direction and magnitude of this slope is mapped, a visualization of the stage, magnitude, and geographic distribution of an outbreak can be realized.\n\nSummary\n\nMapping count and rate data describe disease distribution and potential risk factors whether at the county, household, or room level.\n\nSupplemental data add another dimension to the analysis, enabling further contextualization of the public health problem.\n\nEnvironmental, infrastructure, transportation networks, water systems, and satellite imagery are common supplemental resources.\n\nLinked micromaps and animations are helpful for describing disease distributions across time."
