        "text": "The Southern California Mountains Foundation is a non-profit that is passionate about our mission and community. We strive to:\n\nSupport youth development through conservation initiatives integrating environmental education, training, and hands-on service projects;\n\nProtect our natural resources through adult and family-led programming; and\n\nProvide interpretive services that focus on outdoor recreation, responsible use, and stewardship of our natural environment.\n\nWe achieve our mission by raising money, organizing critical volunteer resources, and creating and managing programs focused on health, stewardship, and sustainability of our Southern California mountains and urban “forests”.\n\nOver the past 30 years, the use of national forests has increased while funding has dramatically declined. The Mountains Foundation works to bridge that gap and add value to our local mountains through the visitor experience. It takes the efforts of our staff and more than 700 trained volunteers to support that work.\n\nFor the past 20 years, the organization has made a critical difference, executing volunteer programs that donated 1.5 million hours of service valued at $32,685,000.00.\n\nLooking back at the last 25 years . . . The organization, founded and incorporated in 1993, was the idea of a group of stakeholders associated with the San Bernardino National Forest. With millions of recreational visitors per year and a year-round population of hundreds of thousands, the Southern California Mountains represented one of the U.S. Forest Service’s greatest challenges. At that time, meeting these recreational demands with quality services seemed beyond Forest Service resources.\n\nThe solution the stakeholders generated was to create a non-profit to support the work of the San Bernardino National Forest, assisting with the mandate for responsible recreation, undertaking conservation to safeguard the Forest’s future, and providing education that promotes stewardship. The San Bernardino National Forest Association was born.\n\nThe organization started out by interpreting the forest to visitors along off-highway vehicle trails and in historic fire lookout towers through their Off Highway Vehicle Safety and Education and Fire Lookout programs, respectively. At the same time, the National Children’s Forest was developed to engage young people.\n\nThe San Bernardino National Forest was threatened and under attack by an 8-year drought, massive infestation of the bark beetle and what began with the wildfires of 2003 followed by the devastating fires of 2006. This extreme call-to-action created a fundamental shift in their priorities from a focus on interpretive programming and natural resource protection to an on-the ground restoration team that was shovel-ready with the organizational capacity and reputation to get the job done; primarily led by youth.\n\nHence, the Forest Care and the Urban Conservation Corps of the Inland Empire (UCC) were launched in 2006 in response to assisting homeowners create more fire safe mountain communities and to expand their commitment to youth development. They accomplished this charter through the Urban Conservation Corps by engaging inner city and at-risk youth from both San Bernardino and Riverside Counties in conservation projects by integrating education, hands-on work and job readiness training. In the process, the organization has helped young people succeed while creating healthier and sustainable urban public lands and mountains loved by so many Southern Californians. In addition, our restoration efforts expanded the role and voice of youth at Children’s Forest in public lands management.\n\nIn 1998 the Big Bear Discovery Center was opened and co-managed with the U.S. Forest Service as a gateway to the forest through visitor services, family-oriented programming and interpretative tours and services designed to teach responsible recreation and foster a respect and appreciation for our public lands through stewardship education. In 2017 the mountains partnered with the Big Bear Valley Trails Foundation and is currently undergoing a merger to add the seventh program to our portfolio that will support trail stewardship throughout the Big Bear Valley.\n\nOver 750 volunteers support the Mountains Foundation on a year-round basis. The Foundation supports public lands and our partners through grants, corporate sponsorships, memberships, private donations and fundraisers.\n\nMike Mutschler | Vice President\n\nMike Mutschler started his professional life as a computer programmer and non-destructive testing engineer in the 80’s while in college at Cal Poly Pomona. By 1991, his entrepreneurial tendencies took over and he started a technology support company aimed at helping clients get the most out of their IT budgets. His company, Resource Computer Solutions has been doing just that ever since mostly in Southern California but all over the country as well. He knows and understands what it takes to make a small business successful.\n\nHe first got involved as a Board member for the Mountains Foundation in 2015. He was asked to serve because of his passion for the environment and for the preservation of the Big Bear Valley. He has spent a lot of his vacation time in Moonridge since he was 5 years old and continues to make Big Bear his second home. “There is nothing better than making the short drive up the hill and feeling the stress of life slowly dissolve as the sky turns more blue and the air changes to something pure.” He attributes much of his success to the ability for him and his family to get away from it all in just an hour. He believes we have to do everything within our limited power to keep the forest a place where everyone can experience the power and beauty of nature.\n\nStacy Gorin | Executive Director\n\nStacy Gorin, a 10 year veteran of the Southern California Mountains Foundation has been leading the organization since October 2015. Stacy has been energized by nature since childhood and believes that everyone deserves the opportunity to enjoy the beauty, solitude and joy that connecting to nature provides.\n\nThrough her leadership, the nonprofit continues to win large-scale grants since her employment in 2006; and, created collaborative partnerships successfully advancing our environmental conservation, education and responsible recreation initiatives. Stacy previously served as Deputy Director for the Southern California Mountains Foundation from December 2012 until April 2015. Stacy joined the nonprofit in 2006, then named the San Bernardino National Forest Association, as Lead Naturalist at the Big Bear Discovery Center performing student and visitor education program, training volunteers and leading interpretive programs; moving to Discovery Center Director position in 2010 overseeing all operations and staff at the Center. The nonprofit was formed in 1992 and renamed the Southern California Mountains Foundation in concert with its 20th milestone year and celebration. It is comprised of 6 key programs and supported by 1,000 plus volunteers.\n\nStacy Gorin holds a Bachelor’s degree in Environmental Analysis and Design from the University California Irvine. Stacy connects to nature through her hobbies of hiking, biking, snowboarding, and rock climbing.\n\nDuvonne Easley | Urban Conservation Corps Fleet, and Warehouse Manager\n\nDuvonne Easley was born and raised in Los Angeles, California.
