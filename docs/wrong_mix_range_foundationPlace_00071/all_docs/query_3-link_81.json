        "text": "Preston Castle was constructed in 1894 as the administration building for the Preston School of Industry, a reform school for boys. The Romanesque Revival style of architecture was to make the building look like a school rather than a prison.\n\nThe Castle opened in June 1894 and remained in use until 1960. In 1960 the State planned to demolish the building and from 1960-1968 a group of local women fought to keep it standing. Once the State agreed to not tear the building down they also said they would do nothing to keep it standing.\n\nThe building remained vacant and in disrepair until September 2001 when the Preston Castle Foundation leased the building from the State. And later, in 2014, the foundation was granted ownership of the Castle and 12.91 acres.\n\nThe Preston Castle Foundationâ€™s mission is to preserve, rehabilitate and utilize the historic Preston Castle site as well as preserving the history of the school, its staff and boys."
