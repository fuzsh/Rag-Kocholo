The suggestions are generated by locators based on the settings you chose on the Provider Settings view accessed from the Options button on the Locate tab in the Locate pane. You can press Enter to search based on text you enter in the search box, or you can click one of the suggestions to perform a search based on that text.\n\nThe Locate pane displays search suggestions generated from the ArcGIS World Geocoding Service, as well as custom-built locators used locally or published as services.\n\nIf you zoom in on the map to approximately city level, you should start to see that results are returned closer to the location you are zoomed in to. For instance, if you search coffee at a global extent or map scale smaller than 1:500000, you will likely see candidates returned for all over the world, but if you're zoomed in to Denver, Colorado, you will likely see candidates returned that are close to or in Denver.\n\nTo turn off this capability, click the Options button and uncheck the Prefer nearby results when zoomed in option. This setting does not apply to the ArcGIS World Geocoding Service, which will always prefer nearby matches when zoomed in.\n\nIf the address is matched, the address candidates appear in list format under the locator that returned them, and they appear as labeled points on your map.\n\nIf features match, the results appear in list format under the locate provider that returned them, and they appear as features on your map. You can right-click any candidate to reveal the Zoom To and Pan To options, which allow you to perform their respective actions on the selected result so you can examine it more efficiently.\n\nIf the feature or record matches, the results appear in list format under the locate provider that returned them, and layer results appear as features on your map. Table results do not appear on the map. Right-click a feature candidate to reveal the Zoom To and Pan To options, which allow you to perform their respective actions on the selected feature result so you can examine it more efficiently."
