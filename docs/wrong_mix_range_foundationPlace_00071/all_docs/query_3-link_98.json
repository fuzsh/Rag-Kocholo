        "text": "Based in Santa Monica, California, the William H. Hannon Foundation was founded in 1983 by the late Catholic philanthropist and real estate developer William H. Hannon. Following his service in World War II, Mr. Hannon returned to Los Angeles to develop residential communities and commercial shopping centers across Southern California. Today, the Foundation carries on Mr. Hannonâ€™s goals of supporting Catholic churches and schools, as well as hospitals and social service organizations that are focused on improving the lives of people in communities Mr. Hannon helped build.\n\nWilliam H. Hannon was born on October 2, 1913, in Los Angeles and died on November 4, 1999, in the same city he called home for a lifetime. He is remembered as a community builder whose passion for real estate was matched only by his passion for giving away the riches he had made."
