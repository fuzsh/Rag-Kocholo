Feb. 4, 1930 – Feb. 7, 2020

Janet Thompson was born in Los Angeles in 1930. She grew up and went to school in Glendale then moved to La Crescenta, where she raised her family and lived the remainder of her life. Janet passed away in her home surrounded by loved ones.

She led a very active and fulfilling lifestyle. She married her high school sweetheart and love of her life, Richard Thompson. Together they shared 71 years of marriage and great memories. The two traveled extensively. Not only did they just sightsee the world, but were also involved in special events. They raced horseless carriages in both England and the states. They were the pit crew for a cross-country helium balloon race team that gave them the opportunity to spend a month in Australia, pitting for a hot air balloon team to celebrate the country’s bicentennial.

In addition to traveling, she was an avid aerobics participant. To say she was involved in politics would be an understatement. Janet held many positions in the Republican Women’s Club and was involved in judging the judge’s group.

There were many highlights in her life. One of her favorite highlights was in high school where she was the only female in an all boy band playing the piano. Another highlight was the fact that she was able to water ski until her 60th birthday.

Janet was an avid animal lover. Janet had numerous pets in her life that included birds, Guinea pigs, and three dogs that she loved to no end. She also had a rabbit and a racoon of all things.

She was an ardent supporter of veterans, children and animal causes. Also she supported state and national parks, just to name a few.

Janet is survived by her husband Richard; son Rick (Irma); and her grandchildren Richard and Laura. Sadly, her daughter Linda passed away in June 2019, but is survived by her wife Patricia.

She will be dearly missed by all who knew and loved her.
