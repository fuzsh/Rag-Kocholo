        "text": "Welcome to Hoover Funeral Homes & Crematory Inc\n\nThank you for taking the time to visit our website. We hope you find it both helpful and informative. One of the key features of our website is that we offer free listings of obituaries for the families we serve. The Obituary page allows for individuals to sign an online guest book to send condolences to the family as well.\n\nHoover Funeral Homes & Crematory has been helping families in the central Pennsylvania area for over seven decades.\n\nWe offer families many choices to help honor the life of their loved one. Traditional Funerals, Memorial Services, Celebration of Life Services, Graveside Services, and Cremation are all examples of some of the services we offer.\n\nOur Hershey location serves the Hershey, Hummlestown, Palmyra, and surrounding areas The Linglestown office works with families in the entire Harrisburg area as well as Dauphin, Grantville, and their surrounding communities. These modern facilities are handicap accessible and have ample off-street parking. Hoover Funeral Homes & Crematory, Inc. continues to maintain the same high standards, professional skills, and compassionate service that have endured for over a century. Our business specializes in all before and after death matters. Unlike most funeral homes, we own and operate our own crematory to guarantee that the same high standards are met during the cremation process as all other services we provide.\n\nCurrently, the two funeral homes and crematory serve over 300 families a year and employ five licensed directors and additional support staff. In Hershey, funeral directors/owners; S. Keith Hoover and Greg W. Hoover oversee the daily operations and work closely with families. In our Linglestown location, funeral directors, John L. Babb, Jr. and Richard H. Buse have many years of experience in funeral service, live in the Linglestown area and have served their community for many years."
