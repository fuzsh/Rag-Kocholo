        "text": "The Oilbird: Mysterious Inhabitant of the Dark Caverns of the Neotropics In the deep and mysterious heart of caves discovered by the renowned German naturalist Alexander Von Humboldt in Venezuela, resides a creature that has captivated nature lovers for years, both for its uniqueness and its crucial role in the ecosystem: Steatornis caripensis, commonly known in this Caribbean country as the Oilbird. In one of many documentary expeditions we carried out in South America with Proyecto AVE, we had the privilege of venturing into the so-called Oilbird Cave, a place of indescribable beauty and mystery in the Monagas State of Venezuela. Hundreds of kilometers traveled to document this strange creature were nearly lost when we realized our entry permits for this cavern, protected by the National Parks Institute (INPARQUES), had expired. After hours of paperwork, we reached a verbal agreement with the local rangers and finally managed to enter, guided by the faint light of our lanterns, to capture the long-awaited image of this ghostly animal in its natural habitat‚Äîa photographic trophy that few documentarians have had the privilege of obtaining. For hours, we tracked an individual until it finally gave us those few memorable seconds that allowed us to immortalize its unique spectral beauty‚Äîa visual document that is a privileged part of our Specialized Visual Archive (AVE), a collection that we have painstakingly built over more than 20 years and that today positions us as one of the leading organizations in documenting neotropical wildlife. I hope that with this document, we can continue to foster interest in the conservation of one of the biological gems inhabiting the depths of the limestone caves of that wonderful country called Venezuela.

It was first established in May 1939 based on a Belgian royal decree with an area of 1.75 million hectares because of its high value in biodiversity. It is home to some 1.800 different species, including lions, leopards, elephants, buffalo, and the Katanga impala which is endemic to the park. Upemba is the only national park in DRC with zebra and cheetah populations. Bird species include several threatened or endangered species, such as the shoebill, wattled crane, and spotted ground thrush. Schmidt's snouted frog is also only known from the park It has been designated a UNESCO Biodiversity Reserve due to its large concentration of mammals, reptiles, batrachians, birds, fish, and a vast wetland. The park‚Äôs deep gorges, cliffs, and waterfalls and its marshes and lakes form a striking contrast to its immense expanse of savannah, making it arguably one of the most magnificent landscapes in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Upemba is also a large marshy bowl area (depression) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo comprising some fifty lakes, including 22 of relatively large size including Lake Upemba (530 km¬≤) and Lake Kisale (300 km¬≤). In an earlier era, the area was probably occupied by one large lake. This large depression has delivered the largest known cemetery in sub-Saharan Africa. Over 40 archaeological sites have been identified, but only six have been partially excavated so far. Arrange and Book with Ultimate Wild Safaris for the Upemba National Park Safari tour in DR Congo.

One of my professors found this highfin goby while exploring a marshland. However, the real takeaway from this post is not the fish itself but rather where it was found. My professor noted that marshlands are an often-overlooked region for aquarists and zoologists alike. Due to the sinking mud, murky water, rough terrain, and winding waterways, many critters go unnoticed. While estuary studies are a large field due to their importance, most inhabiting species are broadly described and/or not well-known in practice. Essentially, everyone knows about tropical, fresh, and oceanic fish; but not everyone knows about what lives in the mud of the marsh.\n\nüó∫Ô∏è#MAPS: The hunt for the rarest bird in the world Calyptura cristata, or the Kinglet Calyptura, is one of the rarest birds in Brazil and the entire planet. It is a tiny bright yellow flycatcher, with a yellowish-green back and a brilliant orange crest. With a wingspan of just around 8 centimeters, it is comparable in size to a tennis ball. And that is almost all that is known about this mysterious passerine species. The Kinglet Calyptura was first described in the early 19th century, along with the majority of Brazil‚Äôs bird species. There are scores of specimens of the Kinglet Calyptura in museums around the world, most of them identified as being collected in Rio de Janeiro during a 50-to-60-year period in the 1800s. Fast-forward to October 1996, more than 130 years without any sightings, and the bird was widely believed to have gone extinct. At least, that was until renowned ornithologist Ricardo Parrini spotted a pair on a tree canopy while out birdwatching in Rio de Janeiro.

This study examines the relationship between national identity, conservation, and iconography in Uruguay from a postcolonial perspective. The study focuses on the representation of fauna in the official iconography, analyzing 387 elements from postage stamps, institutional telephone cards, and national currency produced between 1895 and 2021. The work revealed the connection between shaping Uruguay's national identity, the representation of fauna, and the development of conservation policies. Initially, colonial representations emphasized productive animals to reinforce Uruguay's European image. However, as Uruguay sought to establish its unique identity, native animals became more prominent. Conservation policies reflected this trend, promoting the conservation of native species and regulating exotic ones. Among the vertebrates with the greatest presence in the iconography, the most abundant were birds and mammals. Regarding invertebrates, the most abundant were butterflies. On the other hand, large, threatened, and grassland specialist species were also represented among vertebrates (Puma, Capybara, Pampas Deer, Greater Rhea). The grassland is the ecosystem that supported the growth of cattle ranching, a productive system intertwined with the origin of Uruguay as a nation-state. In this sense, the most referenced species not only aims to highlight the greater visibility of wildlife for the country but also gives it a Latin American specificity associated with a dominant type of ecosystem. Our findings have, therefore, implications for understanding the intersection of conservation policies, national identity, and iconography.\n\nüê¶üîçThe hunt for the rarest bird in the world Calyptura cristata, or the Kinglet Calyptura, is one of the rarest birds in Brazil and the entire planet.

From our section Research and Monitoring üòé An extensive 14-year study using benthic #surveys and #photographic #records has revealed a stunning richness of sea slug diversity around the island of Koh Tao, Thailand. A staggering 191 distinct species across the orders Sacoglossa (14 species), Cephalaspidea (23 species), Aplysiida (5 species), Pleurobranchida (3 species), and Nudibranchia (146 species). Among these, seven species are the first of their kind reported in the Gulf of Thailand, while an additional 115 species represent the first records for Thailand as per current literature.

It‚Äôs encouraging from a biodiversity perspective because some of the world‚Äôs many threatened species (40,000+ in IUCN's list) have had their statuses changed for the better‚Äîlike the Giant Panda no longer being called \"endangered.\" On the other hand, the time-lapse videos made along with the Extreme Ice Survey dramatically display some hastening changes to the planet (the video below [1] is from a couple years ago, but it shows the idea). Although when Swiss glaciers lose 10% of remaining ice in two years, [2] it's almost like no time-lapse is needed... Such visible changes are the clearest indicators of global temperature change. It's hard to argue with the urgency when one can see with one's own eyes as the marmoreal glow of crystallized water gives way to a starker earth. Start with the eyes and the heart and mind may follow. *** [1] https://lnkd.in/g3Ambpeh [2] https://lnkd.in/giGiMMdD"
