He was called 'mariner' and is mentioned frequently in deeds, etc., owning land in New Haven. He married Anne Vicars, Aug. 4, 1656. He was one of the Proprietors of New Haven. (Hist. of New Haven, p. 153.) (See Vicars.) (John Thompson, No. 22, 'Elizabeth and Ann,' p. 153. See Drake Founders, p. 84.)\n\nJohn2 Thompson (Anthony1) called 'Mariner,' has usually been assigned a wife Ellen or Hellena ( 'cf. History of Goshen, and Genealogical History of Connecticut, 1911, p. 1000'). This is an error, and the only wife of John who appears on record was Anne Vicars, or Vicaris. On 25 Feb. 1657, John Tompson entered and action against the estate of John Roberts, part of which was then in the hands of Mr. Wakeman, on the ground that there had been a treaty of marriage betwixt the said John Roberts and Ann Vicars (now wife to the said John Tompson), and that her former betrothed had by word of mouth left his estate to Ann (Hoadley, Records of the Jurisdiction of New Haven, Vol. II, p. 198'.) It should be noted that John Wakeman's wife, Elizabeth Hopkins, had a first cousin Ann, daughter of Walter Vicaris (see the will of William Hopkins of Bewdley, Worcestershire, given in the 'Wakeman Genealogy,' p. 30.) John Thompson died 2 June 1707, and the inventory of Mr. John Thompson, Marriner, late decd,' was presented 28 Oct. 1707 (New Haven Probate Records, Vol. III, p. 116) In the absence of any distribution of the estate, it is difficult to place his daughters with certainty. Most of his land ahd been deeded in the later years of his life to his sons, John, Joseph, Samuel, and William (New Haven Deeds, Vols. II and III) There is no difficulty in identifying the first three, but there seems to have been considerable misapprehension as to the identity of William. ... There is no proof that Ann Vicars was mother of all the children, but no other wife has been found.\"\n\nback to bio.\n\n3. Cuyler Reynolds (ed.), Hudson-Mohawk Genealogical and Family Memoirs - Vol. I, Lewis Historical Publishing Company, New York, NY, 1911: pgs. 94-100.\n\n\"(II) John, eldest son of Anthony Thompson, was born in England in 1632. He is called Skipper John Thompson and John Thompson, the 'Mariner.' This to distinguish him from 'farmer' John Thompson. He was a seafaring man and a resident of New Haven. He married Hellena -----------, who died April 8, 1690. Captain John survived her until June 2, 1707. Children:\n\n1. John, born May 12, 1657; was called Lieutenant John; married Rebecca Daniel; children:\n\n1. Anna, married Thomas Ives;\n\n2. Daniel, married Mary Ball;\n\n3. Rebecca, married Caleb Mix;\n\n4. Elizabeth, married John Bassett;\n\n5. John;\n\n6. Anthony.\n\n2. William, born 1660, married Hannah Glover; children: James; Abigail; Mary, married John Hitchcock, Josiah and Benjamin.\n\n3. Joseph, born April 8, 1664; married Elizabeth Smith; children: Anna, Joseph and Ebenezer.\n\n4. Samuel, see forward.\"\n\nAs noted elsewhere, the mother of these children was probably Anne Vicars. It is plausible that Hellena was Captain John's second wife, although this by no means certain..

William Richard Cutter, Genealogical and Family History of Western New York - Vols. 1-3, Lewis Historical Publishing Company, New York, NY, 1912: Vol. 1, pg. 296.\n\nThis account of the early Thompson family is identical to that given above by Reynolds and must have come from the same earlier source.\n\nb. ibid.: Vol. 2, pg. 575.\n\n\"John, son of Anthony, seems to have been a sea captain.\"\n\nback to bio.\n\n5. \"Jared Sidney Torrance, in his history of the descendants of Lewis Hart, states that John's wife was named 'Hellena' according to records of Goshen, CT, and suggests that she may have been a second wife. He also states that she is supposed to have died 8 April 1690. It is certainly possible that he married twice.\"\n\n\"John was designated 'Mariner' in the family history written by William Baker Thompson in 1911. They resided at New Haven, CT.\"\n\n\"At his death, his estate was inventoried at nine pounds, eight shillings, sixpence. He served as Selectman of New Haven in 1688.\"\n\n\"According to the Will of his brother Anthony, written 26 Dec 1654, he received Anthony's land.\" (Keith Thompson, \"Thompson ka.ged\", www.gencircles.com/users/katman01/1/data/7002, 2003.)\n\nback to bio.\n\n6. \"There is conflicting information on this William. 'Families of Ancient New Haven', p. 1749 & 1757 gives his birth date as 17 Jan 1674, and his wife's name as 'Martha'. They also show him with the following family:\n\n1] Caleb, b 15 Sept 1708; m.
