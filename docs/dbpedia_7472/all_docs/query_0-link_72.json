        "text": "Marshall Thompson, a veteran actor and wildlife enthusiast best known for his portrayal of an African veterinarian in “Clarence, the Cross-Eyed Lion” and its television spinoff series “Daktari,” has died. He was 66.\n\nThompson, who spent many of his retirement years in Africa, died Monday of heart failure, his daughter, Janet Thompson, said Thursday from the family home in Birmingham, Mich.\n\nBorn Nov. 27, 1925, in Peoria, Ill., Thompson studied for the clergy at Occidental College but switched to acting when a part in a college play won him a contract at MGM. His boyish face earned him juvenile roles in the 1940s.\n\nHe moved on to supporting roles in uniform for various films about World War II, including “Command Decision,” “Battleground” and “To Hell and Back.” Years later, he wrote, produced, directed and played a role in “A Yank in Vietnam.”\n\nAfter writing the story about “Clarence,” Thompson helped create the 1965 film and the resulting CBS television series (1966-69). Flanked by an elderly lion and a chimp named Judy, Thompson portrayed Dr. Marsh Tracy, a veterinarian who operated an animal study center in Africa.\n\n“Daktari,” which means doctor in Swahili, dealt with themes that remain topical today--animal preservation, poaching, smuggling and mistreatment of pets.\n\nThompson also created the feature film “George” in 1973 about a New York St. Bernard coping with the wilds of Switzerland.\n\nDuring his later years in Africa, he produced, directed and starred in a documentary series called “Orphans of the Wild.”\n\nPrimarily an actor, Thompson also honed his skills in writing and directing.\n\n“I can’t afford to be inactive,” he told The Times in 1967. “There’ll come a time . . . well, let me put it this way: No one is getting any younger, especially me. I enjoy directing and writing and try to keep my hand in it. And that way, I can always hire myself for the good parts.”\n\nIn addition to his daughter, Thompson is survived by his wife, Barbara, and a grandson.\n\nAfter private services in Michigan, Thompson will be buried in Westwood Memorial Park, Westwood.\n\nThe family has asked that any memorial contributions be sent to the William Holden Wildlife Foundation."
