        "text": "Exhibitions\n\nTaking the Leap\n\n2019 - PHOTOFAIRS, Shanghai, China\n\n\"Taking the Leap is an exhibition of work selected from the University of Salford Art Collection by celebrated independent curator Ying Kwok. The exhibition will take place at PHOTOFAIRS, Shanghai.\n\nTaking the Leap – a brave, risky or challenging move away from one’s comfort zone – is the theme for this exhibition. Curator Ying Kwok, an internationally celebrated Hong Kong independent curator, selected works by artists that are innovative and confident in their creative strategy and design. The theme also aligns with the University of Salford Art Collection’s own leap to diversify the Collection – particularly in relation to Chinese contemporary art and digital art.\n\nFor this inaugural exhibition in China we will be exhibiting our first co-commission with Cao Fei (Haze and Fog) and our latest co-commission with multimedia artist Lu Yang. Visitors will be greeted by a site-specific installation by Lu Yang, specially commissioned by the University to accompany a new, unique print The Great Adventure of Material World #1 by the same artist, that will be premiered at PHOTOFAIRS Shanghai before entering the University Art Collection. In a special screening room there will be the opportunity to view Cao Fei’s celebrated Haze and Fog , co-commissioned with the Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art in 2013.\n\nTaking the Leap demonstrates the strong partnerships between the university and arts organisations in the UK – including the installation by Luke Ching, originally co-commissioned for LOOK 17 with Open Eye Gallery in Liverpool, and four prints from Where the City Can’t See project by Liam Young, originally co-commissioned with the AND Festival in 2017. Other digital works include a video by Simon Faithfull, an animation by Sun Xun and lightboxes by Thomson and Craighead based on computer viruses. The collection also regularly works with artists in the North West of England, represented by a large photograph by Manchester based Mishka Henner and a collaborative work by University of Salford alumni Lizzie King working with Technical Demonstrator Craig Tattersall, commissioned in 2015.\"\n\nAnytime Now\n\n2018 - TENT Rotterdam\n\nAnytime Now focuses on feelings of tension and global instability. The exhibition responds to a ubiquitous feeling of anxiety engendered by the perceived threat of war, terrorism, climate change, social polarisation, and the erosion of the welfare state. The exhibition also questions the feeling that the end of an era is approaching. With impressive images, the artists evoke both a sense of immediate threat and measures of time beyond human comprehension. With the continuous presence of live performers, the inescapable question of humankind’s role forms the heart of this exhibition.\n\nThe centerpiece of the exhibition is the theatrical installation Domain of Things by Pedro Gómez-Egaña. On a steel structure, almost two metres above the ground, there is a twilight-lit living room without walls. Half-empty cups, an open laptop, and other details suggest someone’s recent presence. When the house’s wooden floorboards start to slide like tectonic plates, it becomes clear that people have been present all along. Like a machine, tacitly and slowly, they set the construction into motion. Why did these people go underground? To seek shelter from the instability in the world above, or are they part of the very mechanism causing the instability?\n\nFor the past nine years, Olphaert den Otter has been producing a relentless stream of images showing catastrophes and natural disasters. These World Stress Paintings depict hurricanes, floods, explosions, plane crashes, and destroyed homes. The images are based on news photos, but they differ in one crucial respect: there are no people, and with that, there is no reference to a specific drama. The more his torrent of images flows, the clearer it becomes that Den Otter is not concerned with exceptional incidents, but with a permanent condition of global chaos. TENT is also presenting a new large-scale painting by Den Otter in which he merges ruined city landscapes, from classical antiquity to Homs in Syria, into a maelstrom of destruction.\n\nAgainst the ever-present sense of threat and insecurity, Anton Vrede mobilises an ongoing series of symbolic animal figures. In various legends, they are known as ‘tricksters’: archetypal figures who can endure the challenges and dangers of the world with cunning and guile. Across world history, the trickster emerges as a hero of the marginalised and oppressed. The animal figures also function as a symbolic code which allows people to share stories about fooling and undermining power in contexts where open resistance is impossible. For those who know the code, Vrede’s seemingly innocent drawings of the hare, the monkey and other animals form a subtle gesture of defiance. For years, every morning, Vrede sent a trickster drawing via social media into the world as a daily antidote to growing social tensions. At TENT he presents a wall of drawings.\n\nThomson & Craighead present two works dealing with two profoundly different notions of time, the first beyond and the second within human comprehension. The installation A Temporary Index is a huge clock that counts down in real time to the moment when sites of entombed nuclear waste accross the world become safe for humans. This may take millions of years, a time frame so unimaginable that we relinquish our responsibility. Thomson & Craighead make this inconceivable time span visible using self-designed numerical symbols; signs that may only be understood by future generations. They also present a work based on the ultimate huma\n\nPerpetual Uncertainty - art and radioactivity\n\n2018 - Digital Projection From Online Sources, Table, Chair, Lamp And Folder - Malmö Konstmuseum\n\nPerpetual Uncertainty brings together artists from Europe, Japan and the USA to investigate questions of nuclear technology, radiation and the transmission of knowledge over deep time futures.\n\nThe artworks in the exhibition explore how nuclear technology has affected our perception of memory, knowledge and time. How can we understand the long-lived half-lives of radioactive isotopes? How can we communicate to people where our radioactive waste is stored 100 000 years from now? Is it even possible to imagine how the world will look then?\n\nThe exhibition gives a contemporary perspective on living in a nuclear economy, just seven years after the accident in Fukushima and 32 years after the disaster in Chernobyl. Today North Korea’s nuclear weapon tests remind us of the threat of nuclear war. At the same time, humans are starting to bury radioactive waste, which must be isolated from the environment for up to a million years.\n\nArtists: James Acord, Shuji Akagi, Lise Autogena and Joshua Portway, Erich Berger and Mari Keto, Nick Crowe and Ian Rawlinson, Don’t Follow the Wind, Finger Pointing Worker, Dave Griffiths, Isao Hashimoto, Erika Kobayashi, David Mabb, Cécile Massart, Eva and Franco Mattes, Yelena Popova, Susan Schuppli, Shimpei Takeda, Kota Takeuchi, Jon Thomson and Alison Craighead, Suzanne Treister, Andy Weir, Robert Williams and Bryan McGovern Wilson, Ken + Julia Yonetani.\n\nPerpetual Uncertainty is produced by Bildmuseet and curated by Ele Carpenter.\n\nThe Academy of Saturn\n\n2018 - Solo Exhibition - Cooley Gallery Portland Oregon\n\nThe Cooley Gallery is proud to present a solo exhibition by celebrated UK artist-collaborators Jon Thomson & Alison Craighead.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, Thomson & Craighead have explored the visual, statistical, and poetic nature of networked information and its relationship to capitalism, war, and everyday life. The title of the exhibition—The Academy of Saturn—derives from Voltaire’s 1752 novella Micromégas, in which colossal astral travelers from The Academy of Saturn visit earth and engage in a philosophical discussion with a group of scientists. Radical scale shifts of knowledge and comprehension result in an absurd, zero-sum exchange between the species; however, the story is an acerbic parable about the inanity of war and the value of external perspective. With kindred tenacity and wit, Thomson & Craighead explore global information’s competing—and increasingly intertwined—experiences of intimacy and incomprehensibility, touching information to be here now.\n\nDistillation, order, and observation take different forms throughout the exhibition. The monumental Horizon (2009–present), for instance, comprises a grid of real-time webcam images from every time zone in the world. In Thomson’s words: “The result is a constantly updating array of images that read like a series of movie storyboards, but also as an idiosyncratic global electronic sundial.” As Horizon conjoins time and space in axial form, it amplifies the lyricism of each circadian landscape.\n\nThomson & Craighead also snare and repurpose networked information in material form, often working with ongoing streams of personal utterance. For The Academy of Saturn, the artists are creating a new iteration of their text-based project London Wall (2010–present), entitled, appropriately, Portland Wall. The work is based on public “status updates” posted on Twitter and Facebook in a three-mile radius from the Cooley. The texts are transformed into graphic posters and installed onto the walls of the gallery, forming a vast meander of endlessly readable concrete poetry—fleeting thoughts, arrested and echoed in their community of origin.\n\nPerhaps the artists’ most alchemical work—Apocalypse (2016)—atomizes the King James Bible’s account of the horrors of the End Times in the form of a luxury perfume (developed in collaboration with Edinburgh perfumer Euan McCall). The project was inspired by Master Bertram von Minden’s fifteenth-century altarpiece depicting forty-five scenes from the Book of Revelations (housed at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London). The artists determined Apocalypse’s olfactory notes by calculating the number of times a given substance, such as “blood” or “flesh,” is mentioned in the text.\n\nThomson & Craighead’s interest in the found poetry of historical narrative and networked culture speaks to artistic forms such as the Oulipo movement founded in the 1960s. Oulipo artists constructed their work using patterned constraints such as palindromes and the S+7 technique, in which each noun in a text is replaced with the seventh noun that follows it in the dictionary. In Thomson & Craighead’s sculpture Here (2011–present, also produced in a new iteration for the Cooley) a regulation street sign displays the distance the sign exists from itself if pointing in the direction of the North or South pole. Like a palindrome, the work encapsulates its own unidirectional movement: physical geography tuned to the logic of networked space. And in the video installation Control Room\n\nLooking at one thing and thinking of something else (An Exhibition in Four Parts) Part Two: Observations\n\n2017 - Online Sources, HTML And Javascript, Projection, Audio Amplification - Caroll/Fletcher Gallery\n\nOver the course of the last 10 years, I think we have seen the influence of the Internet on media to make everything shorter and more easily consumed. This influence has undoubtedly had an effect on art, including my own art with varying degrees of self awareness. Part of what interests me is the struggle to take more control over my relationship with time.\n\n-- Evan Roth, discussing his Landscapes series\n\nAt a time where information is rapidly consumed and instant judgements have become the norm, Part Two: Observations brings together works that encourage close attention and contemplation. Using media as varied as photography, film, online data and sculpture, the works in the second part of Looking at one thing and thinking of something else interrogate our patterns of viewing, seeking to foster new, more sustained modes of engagement in our image-saturated environment.\n\nNatascha Sadr Haghighian’s onco-mickey-catch (2016) uses a new application for image correction to investigate socially, culturally and technologically conditioned conventions of viewing. The application CatchEye uses facial recognition software to align the gaze of users of applications such as Skype, in order to give the impression that each person is looking directly into the camera and making eye contact with the other. Visitors are invited to access the application on two computer monitors embedded in a sculptural form resembling an oversized mouse, a reference to the OncoMouse™ known for being the first patented mammal. onco-mickey-catch calls attention to technologies developed in close connection with military research that have been adapted for commercial purposes, and makes manifest the ever more porous boundaries between the body and technology that inform our modes of relating.\n\nCompression Artifacts (2013), a project by Joshua Citarella, explores how artworks are consumed within today’s model of image production and distribution. In 2013, an exhibition was held in a custom-built structure at an undisclosed location. Citarella describes that the works in the show were curated in such a way as to “anticipate their transmission as images and, as such, have taken on certain characteristics native to graphics editing software.” He explains, “Art objects and exhibition spaces may now be partially fabricated, documented and hyper-realistically transformed into idealistic states whose physical manifestation would reach beyond the material means of their producers. In a universe comprised of images, the ability to create the outward appearance of value becomes a means of empowerment.”\n\nChristine Sun Kim and Thomas Mader’s Tables and Windows (2016) is a playful attempt to provide a new set of visual tools for mapping space and describing objects. Taking as its point of departure the sign language teacher Andreas Costrau's assertion that non-Deaf students often struggle to describe rooms and the objects within them, these two videos show Kim and Mader combining their facial expressions and hand gestures to together sign highly detailed descriptions of a variety of tables and windows.\n\nFirst uploaded in 2004, Thomson & Craighead’s Template Cinema is a series of low-tech networked short films made from data appropriated in real-time from the world wide web. Each one is comprised of footage from a live webcam paired with a found soundtrack, and framed within the tropes of the cinematic experience. The vista from a surveillance camera on a coastal walkway,\n\nLife Time - Biological Clocks of the Universe\n\n2017 - MU Eindhoven\n\nThis exhibition explores different dimensions and scales of time, from the universal to the personal and from the cellular to the geological, even the astronomical. Time can be seen as simultaneously binding us, through heredity, and separating us, by death, across generations. And then at the smallest, quantum scale, time seems to mock us, by behaving illogically and entangling all matter over vast distances.\n\nThe arts have long embraced time through forms like video and performance or, in the case of much bio art and design, explored it through birth, growth, rot, decay, and the cycles of whole ecological systems. With many of the works in the exhibition, time and life are examined simultaneously, acknowledging our human limitation of a lifetime, taking stock of our collective impact, and also gazing in awe at the immensity of what has come before and what will, inevitably, follow us all.\n\nLife Time presents the winning projects of the Bio Art and Design Award 2017, developed in collaboration with leading Dutch researchers in the life sciences, alongside several recent works that share a focus on the theme of time. The works reflect on, demonstrate, or even contest advances in life sciences research. They also probe time and life in the realms of the oceans, under the earth, in our minds, and in our cells.\n\nCurator: Angelique Spaninks.\n\nChairman of the BAD Award and writer of the Life Time essay is William Myers\n\nParticipating artists:\n\nSusana Cámara Leret (ES) & Sissel Tolaas (NO), Guo Cheng (CN), Gil Delindro (PT) , Xandra van der Eijk (NL), Noah Hutton (US), Fujita Keisuke (JP), Katie Paterson (UK), Thomson & Craighead (UK), Thomas Thwaites (UK), Wild Vlees (NL), Jiwon Woo (KR), Timo Wright (FI)\n\nSlow Violence\n\n2017 - Video Installation - University of Hertfordshire Arts\n\nUHArts is delighted to host a group exhibition of works by artists Ackroyd & Harvey, Adam Chodzko, Emma Critchley, Ellie Harrison, Tom James, Katie Paterson, Michael Pinsky and Thomson & Craighead to reconsider the prevalent and far-reaching threat of climate change.\n\nWe all know that climate change is a reality – we witness extreme weather conditions and acknowledge the scientific data – yet communicating its impact effectively to instigate behavioural change and decision-making is one of the most serious challenges of our time.\n\nThis exhibition takes its name and impetus from Rob Nixon’s seminal book ‘Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor’ (2013) and proposes fresh examinations of climate change through this lens. Nixon proposes we reject the idea of ‘violence’ as explosive, immediate or sensational - features usually associated with climate change - and instead suggests the ‘violence’ of the phenomenon can be localised, durational, unrecognised, even invisible.\n\nWorking across film, photography, print and installation, the contributing artists challenge us to rethink the prevailing iconography and headlines. Rejecting melting ice caps and desertification, their visual interpretations introduce alternative narratives and questions, at times bringing them unnervingly close to home.\n\nThe Slow Violence exhibition, symposium and other events have been developed collaboratively by UHArts and the Contemporary Arts Practice Group, School of Creative Arts, University of Hertfordshire.\n\nHumansbeingdigital\n\n2017 - Perfume (edition Of 50) - The Lowry\n\nEngaging with art can be an emotional experience - performance, sculpture, painting or music can all touch us beyond words – yet technology is often considered mechanical, cold or inhuman. So how can artists show new perspectives on life, emotion and relationships by using digital technologies to connect human beings and digital?\n\nThis exhibition of nine international artists allows you to experience a range of emotional and physical reactions to artwork that explore the links between humans, machines and technology - both now and in the future.\n\nThom Kubli brings his piece Black Hole Horizon, whilst U_Joo+LimheeYoung use human hair in their surreal work Machine with hair caught in it that gives a feeling of unease. Felix Luque Sanchez, Max Dovey and Libby Heaney use humorous aspects of modern communication in their works which involve emails, Instagram and Tinder respectively, with Dovey’s work using an algorithm to decide if visitors look ‘hipster’ enough to enter his work, A Hipster Bar. The artworks look at ideas about identity, relationships, independence and the absurd side of technology.\n\nHousewives Making Drugs by Mary Maggic and the three individual works Heart, Brain and Lungs by Pascal Haudressy are screen-based pieces that encourage you to think about your own bodies and others, whilst leading digital artists Thomson and Craighead awaken those bodies and senses with their perfume Apocalypse.\n\nFinally, Nye Thompson uses CCTV footage to create a curious environment that asks questions about technology and privacy, contributing a sense of anxiety to an exhibition of many emotions.\n\nhumansbeingdigital artists:\n\nU_Joo and Limhee Young; Max Dovey; Thom Kubli; Nye Thompson; Thomson and Craighead; Mary Maggic; Mango Chijo Tree and The Jayder; Pascal Haudressy; Libby Heaney and Felix Luque Sanchez.\n\nELECTRONIC SUPERHIGHWAY (1966-2016) TOURING\n\n2017 - Museum Art Architecture Technology (MAAT) Lisbon\n\nMAAT brings to Portugal the exhibition Electronic Superhighway, produced by the Whitechapel Gallery, London, in 2016. Electronic Superhighway gathers over one hundred pieces to show the impact of new technologies and the Internet on artists from the mid-1960s until today.\n\nIt showcases both new and rarely seen multimedia works, alongside film, painting, sculpture, photography and drawing by over 70 artists, including Cory Arcangel, Judith Barry, James Bridle, Constant Dullaart, Lynn Hershman Leeson, Vera Molnar, Nam June Paik, Thomas Ruff, Hito Steyerl, Amalia Ulman, and more.\n\nThe exhibition’s title, Electronic Superhighway, is taken from a term coined in 1974 by South Korean video art pioneer Nam June Paik, who foresaw the potential of global connections through network technology. Arranged in reverse chronological order, Electronic Superhighway begins with works made at the turn of the millennium, and ends with Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), an iconic event that took place in 1966. Spanning 50 years, from 2016 to 1966, key moments in the history of art and the Internet emerge as the exhibition travels back in time.\n\nPARTICIPATING ARTISTS\n\nZach Blas, Vuk Ćosić, Douglas Coupland, Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige, Camille Henrot, Gary Hill, Ann Hirsch, JODI, Allan Kaprow, Oliver Laric, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, Eva and Franco Mattes, Manfred Mohr, Lillian F. Schwartz, Richard Serra/ Nancy Holt, Taryn Simon, Stan VanDerBeek, Steina and Woody Vasulka, amoung others.\n\nThe New Observatory\n\n2017 - FACT, Liverpool, UK\n\nThe New Observatory transforms our galleries into an observatory for the 21st century. In collaboration with the Open Data Institute, the exhibition brings together an international group of artists whose work explores new and alternative modes of measuring, predicting, and sensing the world today through data, imagination and other observational methods.\n\nToday we are part of ever growing systems and evolving data infrastructures, which include organisations, algorithms, numbers, facts, governments, machines, and others. Inherent to this is the opportunity for the minutiae of our everyday lives to be watched and tracked. The New Observatory is an open call to everyone to become actively involved in responding to the opportunities and threats this situation demands and to reimagine new possibilities, subjects, and modes of behaviour, in interesting, surprising and sometimes playful ways.\n\nLiverpool has its own unique history of observatories with the Liverpool and Bidston Observatories, which began observations in 1845 and 1867, monitoring natural phenomena from the stars to the sea, creating and using bespoke scientific instruments. Taking this as a key reference point, artists in The New Observatory ingeniously explore how data, devices, and networks once exclusive to scientists are now part of our everyday lives.\n\nThe New Observatory responds to the challenges of standardisation in an increasingly technologically-mediated world. It offers a space where the predictability of things is challenged, where logic may fail, and where that failure can create space for new possibilities.\n\nBy conjuring new and untold stories, from the personal to the political, micro to macro, abstract numbers are transformed into tactile and immersive artworks: personal health records are metamorphosed into digitally printed seashells, the data of divorce is reassessed, soft robotics visualise the social structures of micro-chipped naked mole rats, open source ground stations trace the constellations of satellites that circle the earth, and animatronic face masks replay covert recordings of NSA employees.\n\nIt invites visitors to consider how everyday life is a subject of observation in which we all perform as our own micro-observatories, or ‘observatories of ourselves’. It asks us to reassess our roles as active citizens within a ‘surveillance’ culture, where the infrastructure that surrounds and enables our lives is both physical and digital, and to forge more meaningful, critical or intimate relationships with the data landscapes we inhabit.\n\nCurated by Hannah Redler Hawes (ODI) and Sam Skinner, the exhibition includes interactive works, installations, sound, film, photography, critical design projects, drawing and mixed media. It will be the world premiere of Recruitment Gone Wrong (2016), Divorce Index (2016) and Curtain of Broken Dreams (2016), three new large-scale commissions by internationally renowned British artists Thomson & Craighead and Natasha Caruana, respectively, who were the ODI’s first ever artists in residence in 2015. Other confirmed artists are: Burak Arikan, Wafaa Bilal, James Coupe, Phil Coy, Julie Freeman, Citizen Sense, David Gauthier, Interaction Research Studio, Rachel Jacobs, Jackie Karuti, Kei Kreutler, Libre Space Foundation, Stanza, Liz Orton, Proboscis (Giles Lane and Stefan Kueppers), Jeronimo Voss, and Yu-Chen Wang.\n\nThe 3D and 2D design for The New Observatory will be created by Ab Rogers Design.\n\nThomson & Craighead at Peacock Arts for Look Again Festival\n\n2017 - Peacock Arts, Aberdeen, UK\n\nLondon based visual artists Jon Thomson and Alison Craighead work across video, sound, sculpture, installation and online space. Through sensitive appropriation of images, texts, and data from online and archived sources, the artists produce generous, lyrical works that both exercise the dramatic conventions of cinema and examine the changing socio-political structures of the information age.\n\nThey present a new generative moving image work for Look Again called Control Room alongside two existing artworks, Aberdeen Wall (2010 – 2017) and Here (2013).\n\nI Want I Want! Art and Technology\n\n2017 - Birmingham City Art Gallery, UK\n\nThis exhibition features work by artists made over the last 20 years who have all been influenced by the rapid development of technology. The approach of each of the 26 artists and collectives to their practice is different, resulting in a rich and contrasting view of the world and the culture that surrounds us.\n\nThe artists have used computer animation, video, computer graphics, audio, photography, drawing and gaming technology to create films, moving image, sculptures, paintings, interactive games and small and large scale drawings. The artworks themselves tackle a range of themes such as human relationships and behaviour, surveillance and the habits of modern society.\n\nThe title is inspired by ‘I Want!

In critiquing the ways art is produced, distributed and sold, the artists in the exhibition encourage new modes of thinking and reimagine the ways that art can function in the world.\n\nFor Stolen Pieces (1995-97), artists Eva and Franco Mattes worked in secret over a period of two years stealing dozens of fragments from the most respected museums in the United States and Europe. These ‘stolen pieces’ include, for example, a label peeled from Jeff Koons’ equilibrium tank, a length of shoelace from a Claes Oldenburg soft sculpture, a little blob of lead from an installation by Joseph Beuys and a tiny chip of porcelain from Marcel Duchamp’s Fountain. A CCTV screen above the gallery reception desk, shows footage shot with a hidden camera, documenting the artists’ last heist: appropriating a shred from a painting by Alberto Burri. Meanwhile, Catt (2010) is a sculpture based on an Internet meme, deceptively exhibited as artist Maurizio Cattelan’s work at a gallery in Houston, Texas in 2011.\n\nMishka Henner has described the works in his series Golden Ratio as ‘reducing painting to pure investment value.’ He began the series in 2014 with the $0 painting, and from there the progression of the series follows the Fibonacci sequence, with each successive painting made only once the previous one has sold. The works circulate as a word-of-mouth project only and in that way, reflects the circles in which the artist moves. The first pieces were gifted to close family members or sold to friends. In this way, the series acts as an informal marker of the artist’s worth. For the $10,946 painting, the latest work in the series, Henner mimics the cover design of the influential JRP Ringier series of books of critical writings on art, a reference to how the design of book covers are used to assist in selling ideas. Climbing holds bolted to the surface of the piece allude to the dizzying nature of each price rise at this stage in the series, and the sense of both thrill and risk implicit in the climb. A portfolio showing all the works in the series to date can be viewed behind the gallery reception desk.\n\nNatascha Sadr Haghighian’s I can’t work like this (2007) was first produced in response to a gallery’s invitation to contribute a work for an art fair. Written out solely through the gaps between nails hammered into the wall, her declaration rejects the traditional art object. Instead she presents only the tools for installation used to mount art fair displays, the hammer and nail: symbols of labour itself. With this pointed phrase, the artist expresses her frustrations at the pressures and constraints placed on creative freedoms within a commercial context.\n\nIn May 1999, news spread through the art world that the Serbo-Slovenian artist Darko Maver had died in the NATO bombing during the Kosovo War. His death precipitated a string of posthumous exhibitions, including a tribute at the 48th Venice Biennale later that year. A radical and reclusive artist, Maver was best known for his life-size sculptures of murder victims, which he positioned in abandoned buildings and hotel rooms, seeking to draw media attention to the brutality of the war in the Balkans. The models were so gruesomely realistic that it is said they shocked and horrified the people who found them. In fact, it later emerged that no\n\nWake me up when it's over\n\n2017 - Young Projects Gallery, West Hollywood, Los Angeles, USA\n\nYoung Projects is pleased to present Wake Me Up When It’s Over by the UK duo, Thomson & Craighead, who have shown extensively at galleries, museums and film-festivals worldwide. The exhibition will feature nearly a dozen works spanning the years 1996-2016, thereby presenting an in-depth look into the couple’s practice and methodologies.\n\nFor the better part of the past two decades Jon Thomson and Alison Craighead have been “digging deep,” as curator Marc Garrett once described their practice, “into the algorithmic phenomena of our networked society; its conditions and protocols (architecture of the Internet) and the non-ending terror of the spectacle as a mediated life.”\n\nIn the process they've employed web cams, data feeds, networks, movies, images, sound and text in their many installations, videos and art-objects--often with a wide array of art-historical reference points, including 1960s systems art, 1970s structuralist film-making, and the compositional experiments of the literature group, Oulipo.\n\nOf course, given their interest in the ever-shifting world of the digital, their work can also be as sardonic and menacing as our daily news feed might suggest. Terrorism, dystopia, the apocalypse, the loss of privacy, police states, political apathy, radioactive waste, fear mongering and the self-help industry are common targets for the artists. However, in each case, such works can also convey a wry sense-of-humor and a well-honed critical distance. Apocalypse 2016 for instance, (pictured above), which will be featured in Wake Me Up When It’s Over, is a professionally made perfume that captures the odor of the ‘end of times’ as described in the Book of Revelation. \"[It's] the nasal equivalent of a subsonic frequency,\" wrote critic Nell Frizzell after his encounter with the scent. [It's] doom, in sprayable, wearable, purchasable form.”\n\nOther writers, such as Eddy Frankel, have written similarly of Thomson & Craighead. “There’s a chance you’ll feel like [the artists] have a direct line into your neuroses,” he wrote upon exiting one of their exhibitions; “or at the least have been monitoring your emails or something, because it all taps so perfectly into contemporary anxiety. It’s almost too real. This is aggressive, angsty art that really sticks in your throat.”\n\nPerhaps, but one would also be hard-pressed to overlook the obvious compassion and implicit optimism that is also apparent in much of their work. Video-based projects such as Belief, A Short Film About War, and Help Yourself for example, give tactile form to an astonishing array of anonymous, disembodied voices that pervade the internet—voices that often convey the alienation, loneliness and quiet supplication that tends to dominate online life. By doing so, the artists not only celebrate and delight in the so-called 'promise' of technology, but “tell us about a networked society's gaze at its mediated self,” as Garrett has written. For writers such as Baudrillard, Postman and Eco that kind of self-reflexiveness was the very definition of hyperreality, which they dubbed the information age. “But,” as Garrett continues, “if we add a contemporary flavor to what hyperreality looks like now in a networked society we come up with hyper-mediality.”\n\nWake Me Up When It’s Over is just that: a taste of hyper-mediality in all its strange, woeful and endlessly beguiling glory.\n\nRealtime (touring)\n\n2017 - Lo Pati Centre D'Art Terres de L'Ebre, Amposta, Spain\n\nL'exposició, produïda per Arts Santa Mònica, viatja a Amposta gràcies al Programa d’exposicions itinerants del Departament de Cultura\n\nEn la nostra societat accelerada, lo temps esdevé una preocupació principal a mesura que intentem mantenir-nos al corrent dels grans esdeveniments que tenen lloc a escala global, intentem ser competitius fent més en menys temps, i vivim en un estat de connexió permanent. Lo terme “realtime” (temps real) s'ha convertit en un terme d'ús comú que fa referència a qualsevol procés que es produix de forma sincronitzada amb lo temps de l'usuari, al fer de “ser allà” i “ser present” en una era que no permet lo més mínim retard en la reacció.\n\nLo terme “realtime” (temps real), provinent de la informàtica, s'ha convertit en un terme d'ús comú: sovint fa referència, no només a la computació reactiva, sinó també a qualsevol procés que es produix de forma sincronitzada amb lo temps de l'usuari, al fer de “ser allà” i “ser present” en una era que no permet lo més mínim retard en la reacció.\n\nEn lo món de l'art, lo temps és un element crucial en un fet sovint ignorat: la duració de la contemplació de l'obra d'art per part de l'espectador. Com indica Boris Groys, mentre que en los mitjans tradicionals lo temps necessari per a la contemplació és determinat per l'usuari, l'art basat en processos temporals (nous mitjans i performance) passa este control a l'obra. Hi ha, així, un temps de l'obra al qual l'espectador ha d'adaptar el seu propi temps. En la majoria de les obres de cinema i video, lo temps de la ficció se comprimix per a permetre a l'espectador observar els esdeveniments que tindrien lloc durant un llarg període de temps en uns pocs minuts. Però, què succeix quan una obra d'art té lloc en “temps real”, desenvolupant la seua història al llarg de diverses hores, mesos o dècades?\n\nComissariada per Pau Waelder, Real time. Art en temps real és una exposició col·lectiva que explora l'ús del temps en l'art contemporani presentant una selecció d'obres d'art en les quals lo concepte de “temps real” té un paper principal, ja sigue pel qüestionament de la relativitat del temps, l'ús de dades extretes en temps real d'Internet o per la seua intenció de crear una visió actual, “realista” i sempre canviant del temps en què vivim. Amb obres de Guillem Bayo, Clara Boj i Diego Díaz, Martin John Callanan, Thierry Fournier, Nicolas Maigret, Antoine Schmitt, Thomson and Craighead, Addie Wagenknecht i Carlo Zanni, algunes de les peces seleccionades se nodrixen de la informació que apareix constantment als mitjans de comunicació, mentre altres extreuen dades de diferents fonts, establixen un procés de producció en temps real o bé proposen un qüestionament de la nostra manera de mesurar el temps i relacionar-nos amb lo present. Les tecnologies que utilitzem actualment en la nostra vida quotidiana tenen un paper principal en estes peces, portant estes reflexions sobre el temps a un àmbit molt proper al públic, que en alguns casos pot interactuar amb l'obra i en d'altres ho fa sense saber-ho.\n\nDescarregueu lo llibret al link de l'esquerra, amb tota la informació dels artistes i les peces presentades.

The number of images we encounter on a daily basis has continued to rise ever more steeply, there are now over one and a half billion images uploaded every day. We also appear frequently on surveillance images, with the UK reported to have in excess of 6 million CCTV cameras.\n\nIn the midst of this unprecedented growth, Glut focuses on the work of a range of artists who are all making creative use of this new situation. The work takes in themes of (in)visibility, surveillance, data gathering and appropriation. Some of the works start with the idea of piecing together material taken from diverse sources in order to produce something new. Other works are more concerned with the world of watching and the exertion of control. All of the work looks at the different ways in which we exist in the midst of a world teeming with images.\n\nLooking at one thing and thinking of something else (An Exhibition in Four Parts) Part Three: United We Stand\n\n2017 - Carroll/Fletcher Gallery, London, UK\n\nIn the wake of Brexit, Donald J. Trump's election as President of the United States, and the ongoing refugee crisis, 2016 could be described as the year the outside world crashed in on contemporary art. In such uncertainty, the role of the artist seems more urgent than ever. United We Stand, the third part of Looking at one thing and thinking of something else, brings together works that aren't afraid to intervene in the political. From the poetic to the absurd, the exhibition presents a variety of creative and critical approaches to resistance and the reimagining of a shared future.\n\nEva and Franco Mattes' film poster United We Stand (2005) advertises a fictitious, Hollywood-style blockbuster in which Europe, not the USA, saves the world from impending doom. The film synopsis explains that in the year 2020 the USA has declared war on China. 'The European president calls for the intervention of a special Task Force of five highly trained individuals known only as the English (Ewan MacGregor), the Spanish (Penelope Cruz), the German, the Italian and the French agents. Their mission: to work behind the scenes to resolve the international crisis before it's too late.' Today, with increasingly uncertain Sino-US relations and the growing prospect of a new Cold War, America's status as the world's policeman sits on shaky ground. Whilst the Mattes spotlight and satirise the precarious nature of power blocs, they envision the 'European Project' as overseeing the reinstitution of global order, all the more pertinent in light of recent events.\n\nUBERMORGEN's [V]ote-Auction (2000) was a website launched for the 2000 presidential election, allowing US citizens to sell their vote to the highest bidder. Intervening in the electoral contest between Al Gore and George W. Bush, the work unleashed a storm of outrage with several states issuing temporary restraining orders or injunctions for alleged illegal vote trading. Moreover, federal attorney Janet Reno, the FBI and the NSA launched dedicated investigations to ensure the integrity of the voting process, issuing injunctions that amounted to 700 kg of legal documents. Ultimately, the website precipitated over 2500 national and international news features across print, television, radio and online media, including a 27-minute episode of CNN's 'Burden of Proof' devoted exclusively to the work. The artists' incendiary mode of 'media hacking' had the wry ambition of 'bringing capitalism and democracy closer together', a premonition that one might argue is being borne out today with the election of Donald J. Trump.\n\nLikewise, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer's Level of Confidence (2015) also seeks to intervene in current events but to very different ends. The work acts as a poetic memorial to the 43 students from the Ayotzinapa school in Iguala, Guerrero, Mexico who were kidnapped and likely murdered in 2014. Facial recognition technology is trained to tirelessly seek the faces of the disappeared students in those of exhibition visitors. As you stand in front of the camera, the system calculates which student's facial features most resemble your own, and offers a percentage 'level of confidence' for the accuracy of the match. The technology incorporates the same biometric surveillance algorithms that military and police forces would use to look for suspicious individuals, but re-orients them to search for victims instead. In this endlessly thwarted search for the missing students, the work serves as a profound\n\nMonsters of the Machine\n\n2016 - Laboral Centro de Arte y Creación Industrial\n\nMonsters of the Machine is a contemporary take on Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and asks us to reconsider her warning, that scientific imagining and all technologies have unintended and dramatic consequences for the world. It also invites us to ask the same about the arts and human imagination. Shelley’s classic, gothic horror and science fiction novel, has inspired millions since it was written 200 years ago in 1816, and then published anonymously in London in 1818. It offers a lens through which to look at the practices of arts and sciences today and how they shape society’s relationship with technology.\n\nDr. Frankenstein plays the role of the Promethean scientist, a creative genius, and also a narcissist tangled up in his own individual desires, exploiting others in an irresponsible and abusive drive to control nature. However, who is the real monster? Dr. Frankenstein or the poor wretched mutant he brought to life? Are we Dr. Frankenstein, or the suffering mutant, or both? This question posed by the exhibition considers the roles of our arts and science traditions and examines these issues as part of everyday life; as they are played out in the anthropocene, and climate change, gender politics, ethics, governance, surveillance, posthumanism, transhumanism, hacking, biohacking, colonialism, neoliberalism, biopolitics and accelerationism.\n\nIn this exhibition, visitors can experience artworks in which the human genome is used as the basis for a poetry machine for a self-assembling video montage spanning the thirteen years - a memorial work and an algorithmic visualisation for an historic scientific landmark. 3d printed avatars, representing distorted bodies in pain, in relation to virtual worlds, where there's no geography and the result is the crack / wound, everywhere and nowhere. Visitors participate in a software-driven installation, a performative social neuroscience experiment to discover our shared psychological biases. A surreal video installation shows us a dystopian blend of ‘reality’ out in the remote Australian desert with traditional ghost stories and dreamtime stories, mixed with science fiction. The Sahara Desert is remapped by a custom bot in an algorithmically scripted performance, traversing the data-scape of Google Maps and filling a Tumblr blog and its data-centres. Artists take our bio-matter and the inconceivable quantities of data which we generate in our daily lives as materials with an inherent recombinant intelligence and the power to generate (without the intervention of human will) the narratives of human destiny and more. Do we inhabit our own bodies anymore, or do we share our body materials out for others to measure, reshape and construct, data-scrape and manage remotely. Arthur Kroker in Body Drift: Butler, Hayles, Haraway says that, “we no longer inhabit a body in any meaningful sense of the term but rather occupy a multiplicity of bodies – imaginary, sexualized, disciplined, gendered, laboring technologically augmented bodies.” [2]\n\nArtists and scientists work with the same tools, frameworks and archetypes. There are crossovers, it’s no surprise that we find the boundaries of imaginative fantasy and objective reality breaking down. Take for instance, the jellyfish invasions around nuclear reactors in Japan, Israel, Sweden, and the Scottish plant in Torness. The natural world is writing its own science fiction into a new reality, with vivid images and outlandish outcomes. Right now, the classic techno-uto\n\nTecnologies de la violència\n\n2016 - Arts Santa Monica, Barcelona, Spain\n\nTECHNOLOGIES OF VIOLENCE explores the critical relations between art and the contemporary production of violence and the digital technologies, as well as the techniques that power uses to impose itself through violence.\n\nTechnology, as a system used to organise, service and control power, finds, in its machines, in Internet and electronic systems, tools for world dominance that, after World War Two and during the Cold War, led to the emergence of a “new era in political security”, according to Ralf Fücks, director of Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung, in a publication entitled Hich-Tech-Kriege (High-Tech Wars).\n\nControl of the air and cyberspace and “control of terror”, identified by theorists like Peter Sloterdijk, Marc Augé, Jutta Weber, Herfried Münkler, Constanze Kurz and Paul Virilio, is the goal of the great powers, including governments, companies and terrorist groups, which use sophisticated technology to establish their war zones, generate chaos and seize local and global dominance: anonymous, remote controlled killing by electronic operations; advanced development of cameras, drones and sensors; autonomous computer combat systems; satellite surveillance; and preventive security policies, police control, the killing and forced displacement of people.\n\nTECHNOLOGIES OF VIOLENCE meditates on the shape that violence takes in the collective imagination, on the iconography and symbology of the media and entertainment industry, and the different ways in which the war industry produces, consumes and uses images (cartoons, video games, software and so on). Moreover, taking up the ideas of Foucault, Achille Mbembe and Subhabrata Banerjee about biopolitics, “necropolitics” and “necrocapitalism” as a global system of death production, the exhibition also looks at the forms of insubordination that artists have worked on since the 2000s, as well as the so-called GWOT (Global War on Terrorism) and the implosion of the neocapitalist system after the failure of the great systems of ideological “redemption”.\n\nParticipating artists:\n\nPEGGY AHWESH\n\nMAJA BAJEVIC\n\nALICIA FRAMIS\n\nREGINA JOSÉ GALINDO\n\nMARIAM GHANI\n\nELNAZ JAVANI\n\nENRIC MAURÍ\n\nTIM PARCHIKOV\n\nPAOLO PEDERCINI\n\nMOLLEINDUSTRIA\n\nLARISSA SANSOUR\n\nSEAN SNYDER\n\nEDDO STERN\n\nTHOMSON & CRAIGHEAD\n\nZHOU XIAO HU\n\nStutterer\n\n2016 - Two Channel Digital Installation - The Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge\n\nAn instructional artwork, a poetry machine playing the human genome like a musical score. Cultural Zone, Wellcome Genome Campus\n\nStutterer plays the 3.2 billion letters of the human genome, our complete set of genetic instructions, like a musical score. As each letter plays out on one screen, the artwork randomly plucks a clip from English language media that was broadcast during the thirteen years it took to sequence the first human genome and plays the clip on a second screen. The work highlights the scale of information contained in each of our cells - if the work played continuously it would run for sixty years - but also the rich period of history that was the backdrop to this monumental project; beginning in 1990 with the release of Nelson Mandela, to the the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nThe Human Genome Project was an international collaboration between twenty research institutes in six countries, and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute based at the Wellcome Genome Campus was its UK hub. The Sanger was the single biggest contributor, sequencing one third of the genome. Stutterer is exhibited alongside objects from the Human Genome Project, including a DNA sequencing machine, which demonstrate the process of getting from an organic sample of DNA to the final string of letters visualised in the artwork.\n\nProgramming by Matt Jarvis. Stutterer was commissioned by LifeSpace Science Art Research Gallery at the University of Dundee for their new Discovery Centre for Translational and Interdisciplinary Research in the College of Life Sciences, which opened in 2014 and was supported by a Wellcome Trust Arts Award.\n\nImage credit: © Ruth Clark and courtesy of the artists and The University of Dundee\n\nPerpetual Uncertainty\n\n2016 - Digital Projection, Monolith, Vinyl Lettering - Bildmuseet, Umeå, Sweden\n\nPerpetual Uncertainty / Contemporary Art in the Nuclear Anthropocene brings together artists from Europe, Japan, the USA and Australia to investigate experiences of nuclear technology, radiation and the complex relationship between knowledge and the deep time.\n\nThe artworks explore how nuclear weapons and nuclear power has influenced our interpretation of concepts such as archives, memory, knowledge and time. How can we understand and visualise the ungraspable timeframe of radioactive half-life? How can we archive and communicate knowledge about radioactivity from generation to generation, hundreds of thousands of years into the future?\n\nParticipating artists: James Acord, Shuji Akagi, Lise Autogena & Joshua Portway, Erich Berger and Mari Keto, Nick Crowe and Ian Rawlinson, Don't Follow the Wind, Finger Pointing Worker, Dave Griffiths, Isao Hashimoto, Erika Kobayashi, David Mabb, Cécile Massart, Eva and Franco Mattes, Yelena Popova, Susan Schuppli, Shimpei Takeda, Kota Takeuchi, Thomson & Craighead, Suzanne Treister, Andy Weir, Robert Williams and Bryan McGovern Wilson, and Ken + Julia Yonetani.\n\nThe exhibition includes a programme of films, open discussions and talks by researchers and experts.

Jon Thomson & Alison Craighead's, temporary index, is a digital artwork that counts down decay rates of entombed radioactive waste sites around the world. David Mabb's new sculptural series, A Provisional Memorial to Nuclear Disarmament, draws on the Royal Navy's love of William Morris fabric and Morris's revolutionary politics. Susan Schuppli's audio work Sound of Sand, investigates the poetics of sonar surveillance.\n\nThe exhibition will situate these new works alongside works by Japanese artists investigating the deep time memory over generations. Erika Kobayashi's 'Half Life' calendar maps the intergenerational timescales of radiation between Europe and Japan, through the decay rate of Raduim. Artist Kota Takeuchi will present his work Take Stone Monuments Twice revisiting monuments along the Tohoku coast of Japan. The artwork reflects on the tensions between monuments of the past and markers for the future.\n\nThis year will mark the end of the Royal Navy fifteen-year public consultation on how to dismantle British nuclear submarines, and where to store the reactor vessels. The Submarine Dismantling Project Advisory Group is the first MOD public consultation with expert advisors, NGO's and statutory agencies that represent a range of experience and political concerns. The exhibition takes place in the spirit of the advisory group and their commitment to an open and frank discussion about the issues of nuclear dismantling and radioactive waste management.\n\nPartners\n\nThe Material Nuclear Culture exhibition is produced by KARST and Arts Catalyst, curated by Ele Carpenter with support from: Arts Council England, Goldsmiths College University of London, University of Westminster, Sasakawa Foundation, and Bildmuseet Sweden.

The scent will be showcased alongside a series of major new works inspired by sources ranging from nuclear waste to self-help literature and genetics.\n\nThe late 20th century saw one of the most significant scientific advances to date, with the first mapping of a human genome (an individual’s complete DNA set) by the international Human Genome Project. It took thirteen years and twenty universities to reference over three billion base pairs of nucleotides (DNA molecules) that compose one single genome. This process has inspired Thomson & Craighead’s Stutterer (2014), a video installation the artists describe as a “poetry machine.” There are four types of DNA: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, commonly referred to as A, C, G, and T. The artists seized the creative opportunity afforded by the combination of a sequence of letters and a crucial tranche of recent history. The time it took to complete the Human Genome Project spanned the liberation of Nelson Mandela in 1990 and the fall of Baghdad to the allied military coalition in 2003. Supported by the Wellcome Trust, Stutterer (2014) pairs each letter of the first human genome with a word beginning with the same letter, spoken in television footage from the period. The result is a televisual portrait of an era which encompassed not only the First and the Second Gulf Wars, but also the collapse of the Soviet Union, the deaths of Yitzhak Rabin and Princess Diana, the first cloned sheep Dolly, the launch of Viagra and the shootings at Columbine High School. In October 2002, then-President George W. Bush declared that Iraq was in possession of chemical and biological weapons which “threatened America and the world” – an allegation which is now widely acknowledged as one of the main triggers for the Second Gulf War (2003-11). “Confronting the threat posed by Iraq,” he said, “is crucial to winning the War on Terror.” Thomson & Craighead’s print the war on terror (2016) plays with the phrase in a series of Oulipo-esque anagrams: “the rot narrower”, “tarot hewn error”, “rare tower thorn.” Made with a type-writer on a white sheet of paper like a piece of experimental poetry, these hint at the absurdity of the chain of events that led to the death of hundreds of thousands of civilians in less than a decade. Multi-coloured balloons bearing the names of military operations from “Desert Storm” to “Urgent Fury” crowd the floor. These innocuous presences – absent-mindedly kicked about by visitors as they progress through the exhibition – function as gentle reminders of the pervasive nature of warfare. On a TV screen, some women dutifully pop the balloons after a corporate party, as if trying to contain a reality that could overwhelm them. Created in collaboration with perfumer Euan McCall, the fragrance Apocalypse combines the scents of olfactory elements described in The Book of Revelation, including burnt flesh, incense and blood. Presented in a velvet-lined box, it turns a central tenet of the Western imaginary, and a canonical representation of End Times, into a luxury, limited edition item. At once highly desirable and sickening, the piece is the product of a time in which both consumerism and politics feed on fear, mysticism and fallacies of all stripes. With the series of posters Common Era (2016), Thomson & Craighead gather a collection of predict\n\nElectronic Superhighway\n\n2016 - Karaoke Videos, PA Amplifier, Microphone, Microphone Stand, Unicol Stand, Flat Sreen Television And Media Player - Whitechapel Gallery\n\nElectronic Superhighway (2016 – 1966)\n\nIn January 2016 the Whitechapel Gallery presents Electronic Superhighway (2016-1966) a landmark exhibition that brings together over 100 artworks to show the impact of computer and Internet technologies on artists from the mid-1960s to the present day. It features new and rarely seen multimedia works, together with film, painting, sculpture, photography and drawing by over 70 artists, including works by Cory Arcangel, Roy Ascott, Jeremy Bailey, Judith Barry, James Bridle, Douglas Coupland, Constant Dullaart, Lynn Hershman Leeson, Vera Molnar, Albert Oehlen, Trevor Paglen, Nam June Paik, Jon Rafman, Hito Steyerl, Ryan Trecartin, Thomson & Craighead, Amalia Ulman and Ulla Wiggen. The exhibition title Electronic Superhighway (2016-1966) is taken from a term coined in 1974 by South Korean video art pioneer Nam June Paik, who foresaw the potential of global connections through technology. Arranged in reverse chronological order, Electronic Superhighway (2016-1966) begins with works made between 2000 – 2016, and ends with Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T), an iconic, artistic moment that took place in 1966. Spanning 50 years, from 2016 to 1966, key moments in the history of art and the Internet emerge as the exhibition travels back in time. As the exhibition illustrates, the Internet has provided material for different generations of artists. Oliver Laric’s painting series Versions (Missile Variations) (2010) reflects on issues surrounding digital image manipulation, production, authenticity and circulation. Further highlights include a series of photographs from conceptual artist Amalia Ulman’s four-month Instagram project Excellences & Perfections (2014-15), which examines the influence of social media on attitudes towards the female body. Miniature works by Celia Hempton painted live in chatrooms go on display alongside a large scale digital painting by Albert Oehlen and manipulated camera-less photography by Thomas Ruff. The dot-com boom, from the late 1990s to early millennium, is also examined through work from international artists and collectives. The exhibition is curated by Omar Kholeif with Emily Butler, Mahera and Mohammad Abu Ghazaleh Curator, Whitechapel Gallery and Séamus McCormack, Assistant Curator, Whitechapel Gallery.\n\nReal Time\n\n2016 - Arts Santa Mònica, Barcelona\n\nGuillem Bayo, Clara Boj i Diego Díaz, Martin John Callanan, Grégory Chatonsky, Thierry Fournier, Varvara Guljajeva i Mar Canet, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, Nicolas Maigret, Katie Paterson, Antoine Schmitt, Thomson and Craighead, Addie Wagenknecht, Carlo Zanni\n\nIn today’s accelerated society, time becomes a primary concern as one strives to keep abreast of major events taking place internationally and react to developments. We live in a state of permanent connection that leads to the anxiety of being part of a present that is not our own but one described by the media and social networks.\n\nThe term real time refers to the ability to show, communicate or react to events at the moment they take place. This term, which is commonly used in computer science, the media and all types of narratives, denotes a process that occurs synchronously with the spectator or user’s time. This immediacy translates into, for example, the ability to interact with a virtual environment, report on current events and tell a story in which time unfolds naturally. The individual present is connected with an external or shared present, promoting forming part of the present or issuing a response. “Real time” is thus linked to “being there” or Dasein as formulated by Martin Heidegger, which refers to the relationship between the individual and his or her environment and indicates that everyone is tied to the world they live and participate in. The concept also leads us to question what “real time” is, how we measure time and how this measuring is relative, even though it determines our perception of reality.\n\nIn the art world, time is a crucial element in something often overlooked: the amount of time the spectator spends contemplating the work of art. As Boris Groys has pointed out, while in traditional media the time needed for this contemplation is determined by the user, art based on temporal processes (new media, video and performance) hands this control over to the work. Usually works of art show a specific moment or an action bounded in time, but what happens when a work unfolds in “present continuous,” constantly changing and subject to an endless process?\n\nReal Time. Art in Real Time presents a selection of contemporary works of art in which the concept of “real time” has a key role, whether by questioning the relativity of time, using data taken from the Internet in real time or seeking to create a current picture, “realistic” and always changing with the times we live in. Some of the works selected draw information that appears constantly in the media, while others pull data from various sources, establish a production process in real time or propose a questioning of our way of measuring time and relating to the present. The technologies we use in our daily lives have a central role in these pieces, leading to reflection on time in an area that is very close to the spectator, who in some cases can interact with the work and in others does so unknowingly.\n\nBig Bang Data\n\n2015 - Somerset House\n\nEmails, selfies, shopping transactions, Google searches, dating profiles: every day we’re producing data in huge quantities. Our online activity, alongside that of businesses and governments, has led to a massive explosion – a ‘Big Bang’ – of data. This radical shift in the volume, variety and speed of data being produced, combined with new techniques for storage, access, and analysis, is what defines the proliferation of data. It is radically reshaping our world and is set to revolutionise everything we do. Data today gives us new ways of doing things: from scientific research to business strategy, politics to social interaction, our new data-driven society that has the potential to be more fair, stable, and efficient and yet it also created a tools for unprecedented mass surveillance and commodification. Data access and usage rights, along with the value they comprise, are at the heart of many concerns. Big Bang Data explores the issues surrounding the datafication of our world through the work of artists, designers, journalists and visionaries. As the data explosion accelerates, we ask if we really understand our relationship with data, and explore the meaning and implications of data for our future.\n\nRight Here Right Now\n\n2015 - The Lowry\n\nA major new exhibition providing a thought provoking snapshot of contemporary digital art. Featuring the work of 16 international artists, Right Here, Right Now looks at how technology affects our lives - through surveillance, artificial intelligence, voyeurism or online dating.\n\nCreated in the last five years, their critical, playful and illuminating artworks challenge our understanding of the digital systems that surround us, while making visible those that are hidden. Prepare to re-think your increasingly connected digital life.\n\nArt in the age of asymmetrical warfare\n\n2015 - Witte de With\n\nJust as World War II began with a charge on horseback, and ended with the atomic bomb, the technological escalation of killing machines continues today. Art In The Age Of…Asymmetrical Warfare, the third and final iteration of Witte de With’s year-long exhibition series Art In The Age Of…, considers the irregular, and often uneven nature of the hybrid battlefield. As always, war is ever-present, however, its theater has now extended from the so-called real to the virtual. While hard power is still asserted face-to-face and hand- to-hand, remotely controlled weaponry and other means of telecommunicated violence are broadcast and delivered digitally through cyber attacks, and via social media propaganda platforms. Not surprisingly, these new channels have created their own forms of representation in which morale and information have become equal to, or are greater than, traditional military superiority. Instead of simply producing images of war, a new war of images is being fought and sold. As such, Art In The Age Of…Asymmetrical Warfare asks the question: What role do artists play when they slip into these networks and try to reveal the engines and effects of contemporary conflict? Participants: Abbas Akhavan, Sven Augustijnen, James Bridle, Broomberg & Chanarin, Crass, Claire Evans, John Gerrard , Terence Gower, Glenn Kaino, Navine G. Khan-Dossos, Adam Kleinman, Trevor Paglen, Mohammad Salemy, Susan Schuppli, Nida Sinnokrot, Thomson & Craighead, Tom Tlalim, José Antonio Vega Macotela. Curators: Defne Ayas, Natasha Hoare, Adam Kleinman\n\nThe Line Sculpture Trail\n\n2015 - Metal Roadsign - Greenwich Tow Path, London\n\nWHAT IS THE LINE?\n\nThe Line is London's first dedicated modern and contemporary art walk.\n\nWHAT KIND OF ART CAN I SEE?\n\nBy the end of June, there will be 14 works on The Line. These include sculptures by Martin Creed, Damien Hirst, Thomas J Price, Antony Gormley and Eduardo Paolozzi. The art is outside (protected by 24 hour CCTV) and will be lit at night. We are creating a dynamic exhibition with works on loan for two years and with new works continually being introduced. There are also indoor gallery spaces along the route, which will show specific exhibitions.\n\nWHO IS THE LINE FOR?\n\nThat's like asking who is art for? We believe everyone will enjoy the experience. Local residents, Londoners, tourists, lovers, families, bird-watchers, cyclists, dog-walkers, art-followers, ramblers and anyone else who enjoys an adventure.\n\nWHO SELECTED THE ARTWORKS THAT ARE ON THE LINE?\n\nThe first 9 sculptures were part of an open submission and were selected by a panel that included artist Mark Wallinger, art critic Richard Cork, collector and philanthropist Anita Zabludowicz, Whitechapel Gallery curator Omar Kholeif, CEO of the charity Gasworks Docks Partnership Simon Myers and one of The Line's co-founders, Megan Piper. Carolyn Miner, previously a curator of sculpture at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, has joined the team as Curator and is responsible for further installations and the development of the exhibition programme.\n\nWHAT ROUTE DOES THE LINE FOLLOW?\n\nThe Line runs from Greenwich to Stratford, between The Greenwich Peninsula (The O2) and the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. It broadly follows the line of the Greenwich Meridian. Three miles in a straight line, much of the walk is along winding waterways and takes around three hours to complete. You can walk all of The Line in one go, or visit different sections on different days. There are underground and overground stations all along the route, and you can cross the Thames in the Emirates Air Line cable car.\n\nWHAT IS THE GREENWICH MERIDIAN?\n\nThe Greenwich Meridian is the line that separates east from west in the same way that the Equator separates north from south. It is an imaginary line that marks zero degrees longitude. The Greenwich Meridian is important as it marks the starting point of every time zone in the world.\n\nIS THE LINE FREE?\n\nIt is completely free to see the art on The Line. There are two sections where you need to pay to travel. North Greenwich and the Royal Docks are linked by the Emirates Air Line, a cable car, which takes you over the Thames. The Royal Docks and Cody Dock are linked by a three-minute DLR journey (Royal Victoria to Star Lane).\n\nExposition L'appartement\n\n2015 - Digital Video, Unicol Stand, Microphone, Microphone Stand And Amplifier - Plateforme 73 rue des Haies 75020 Paris France\n\nA small exhibition where the included works are set in a domestic scene: Exposition L'appartement // Du vendredi 24 avril au 10 mai 2015 // Vernissage le vendredi 24 avril de 18h à 22h // Avec les artistes de Plateforme: Stefan Brion, David Plion, Dominique Clerc, Alexandre Durand, Miki Nitadori, Dorota Kleszcz, Eric Le Maire, Vincent Debanne, Axël Kriloff, Hugo Arcier, Marc Poitvin... // Et leurs invités Atomic Pictures, Jon Thomson & Alison Craighead, Jean Baptiste Perrot, Jérôme Poret, Vincent Prieur, Carine Guimbard, Eli Gonzalez-Aoun, Florence Klein-Parahy, Léopold Koukissa, Emmanuelle Dagnaud, Sylvie Albac, Rafael Medeiros, Duel Domestique, Edouard Mortec, Adrien Belgrand...\n\nData as Culture 3: Data Anthropologies\n\n2015 - Open Data Institute\n\nData as Culture 3: Data Anthropologies critically positions humans at the centre of emerging data landscapes through artistic exploration. The Open Data Institute offers itself as the focal point of this exploration by hosting a series of artists’ exploration. Thomson & Craighead, in residence between February and June, 2015, will develop a concept for a new artwork, responding to or working with open data. They will work along an open research model, likewise sharing their thinking through a solo exhibition of their existing works at the ODI.\n\nThomson & Craighead’s work explores the ways in which our lives and experiences are mediated by technology. It raises questions about what it means to aggregate and interconnect large bodies of information, inviting reflection on how mechanisms like the World Wide Web, alter, extend and distort our understanding of the world around us. Thomson & Craighead are keen observers of the ways in which people interact with these new spaces. Working with sound, video and sculpture, their materials include found YouTube footage, search terms and extracted texts from individual and corporate contributors to online media.\n\nSignals: 24/7 (International Film Festival Rotterdam)\n\n2015 - Digital Animation - Hilton Rotterdam Hotel\n\n24/7 will focus on the changing world & technology, and how the attention economy is affecting our lives, how we consume information and how it dominates not only our waking but also our sleeping moments. Our experience of time is mutating at the speed of light, due to the glass fibre and wireless networks that keep us entangled. How this affects our sense of reality now and its impact in the near future is one of the most important discussions in the world today.\n\nIn the late 1990s, when Google was barely one year old and was still a privately held company, its future CEO, Dr. Eric Schmidt was already articulating the context in which such a venture would flourish. Schmidt declared that the twenty-first century would be synonymous with what he called the 'attention economy', and that the dominant global corporations would be those that succeed in maximizing the number of 'eyeballs' they could consistently engage and control.\n\n24/7 is focussed on stimulating discussion on this 'attention economy', the global thirst for information and the daily data consumption and mass synchronisation of work and leisure rhythms which are synonymous with this. We are working, communicating and consuming whenever and wherever we happen to be in the world. Divisions between night and day, between rest and work are gradually disappearing. Our experience of time is mutating at the speed of light, due to the glass fibre and wireless networks that keep us entangled.\n\nTherefore 24/7 forces the audience to step out of the cinema, into hotels. A hotel is just like a cinema, a place where one checks in to step out of the daily routine. They are open 24/7 and strongly associated with our need for sleep. While examining the ever-changing world of the 21st Century, this programme challenges the traditional notion of a film 'slot' by raising the question of what we now class as a 'normal duration'.\n\nHow to Construct a Time Machine\n\n2015 - Video - MK Gallery, Milton Keynes\n\nMK Gallery presents How to Construct a Time Machine, an exhibition of over twenty-five historical and contemporary works that explore how artists play with media in innovative ways to transform our experience of time.\n\nWhat is time? How do we order the past, the present, and the future? Why are artists interested in time? How is art a machine, vehicle, or device for exploring time? How is art a means by which time ‘travels’, and how does art permit us to travel in time? Consideration of these and other questions has provided the exhibition rationale for guest curator, Dr Marquard Smith.\n\nThe show’s title is taken from an 1899 text by the avant-garde French writer, Alfred Jarry, written in direct response to H. G. Wells’ science fiction novel The Time Machine (1895). Wells invented and popularised a distinctively modern, fictional concept of time travel, with the time machine as a vehicle that could be operated ‘selectively’. Jarry’s response crafted a pseudo-scientific fiction that presents the time machine and time travel as an instance of ‘the science of imaginary solutions’.\n\nTaking this idea of the time machine, time travel, and perhaps even time itself as an instance of ‘the science of imaginary solutions’, the exhibition is divided thematically across the galleries and includes works by John Cage, Martin John Callanan, Jim Campbell, Edgar Cleijne and Ellen Gallagher, Mat Collishaw, Ruth Ewan, Tehching Hsieh, On Kawara, the Lumière Brothers, Chris Marker, Kris Martin, Georges Méliès, Manfred Mohr, Melvin Moti, Nam June Paik, Katie Paterson, Elizabeth Price, Sun Ra, Raqs Media Collective, Meekyoung Shin, Maja Smrekar, The Otolith Group, Thomson & Craighead, Mark Wallinger and Catherine Yass.\n\nFilm work ranges from George Méliès’ A Trip to the Moon (1902), an iconic silent movie which follows a group of astronomers as they explore the moon, to Thomson & Craighead’s The Time Machine in alphabetical order (2010), a complete rendition of the 1960s film version of the Wells’ novella re-edited into alphabetical order.\n\nSculptural work includes Mark Wallinger’s Time and Relative Dimensions in Space (2001), a polished stainless steel version of Dr Who’s ‘Tardis’ police box that simultaneously disappears into the space-time continuum and reflects its own surroundings, and Ruth Ewan’s We Could Have Been Anything That We Wanted to Be (2012), a decimal clock which divides the day into ten (rather than twenty-four) periods, echoing a bold 18th century French Republican attempt to redefine and rationalise the day.\n\nThe exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue, designed by Herman Lelie, featuring an extended Introduction by the exhibition’s curator and a translation of Jarry’s How to Construct a Time Machine, together with essays by Dutch cultural theorist and video artist Mieke Bal and radical philosopher Peter Osborne. The exhibition will be supported by a range of related events including tours by the curator and artists, seminars, academic conferences, and film screenings.\n\nIt's me, not you (SSA Annual Exhibition 2014, Edinburgh)\n\n2014 - Video - Royal Scottish Academy, Edinburgh\n\nTHE 117th ANNUAL OPEN EXHIBITION\n\nSee more here:\n\nhttp://www.s-s-a.org/ssa-annual-exhibition-2014/\n\nScales of Life\n\n2014 - Digital Installation - LifeSpace Dundee\n\nScales of Life is the inaugural exhibition in LifeSpace and features new and existing art works by Thomson & Craighead, Elaine Shemilt, Tabitha Moses and Helen Chadwick, alongside artefacts from the University's collections. The exhibition, curated by Sarah Cook, shows how visual artists have represented the fundamental scales of life - from molecules to organelles to cells to tissue. Scientific research into each of these biological components is the basis of the understanding and treatment of many diseases, yet these artworks, made from materials as diverse as embroidery or digital video, present other ways of picturing scientific knowledge. The exhibition is in part supported by The Wellcome Trust.\n\nMicromégas > Powers of Ten\n\n2014 - Pier Arts Centre 28-36 Victoria Street Stromness Orkney\n\nMICROMEGAS > POWERS OF 10 - 58°57’53”N - 3°17’45”W brings together works by Pavel Büchler, Dora Garcia, Jonathan Monk, Scott Myles, Thomson & Craighead, Marco Stout, Tracy Mackenna & Edwin Janssen, a text by Mark Dorrian along with books and print-works published by Orkney based Hansel Cooperative Press and Brae Editions. Mircromegas explores ideas relating to perceptions of scale, philosophical & scientific thought and human foible. Referencing Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design's unique Artists’ Books Collection Dundee (abcD), the exhibition investigates notions of portability, reproduction, distribution and presentation and the potential for artist’s book in contemporary art and curatorial practice.\n\nThing World (International Triennial of New Media Art\n\n2014 - Digital Installation - National Art Museum of China\n\n“thingworld: International Triennial of New Media Art 2014” is the third edition following the internationally acclaimed Olympic Cultural Project “Synthetic Times: Media Art China 2008” and “transLife: International Triennial of New Media Art” which was officially instituted as a triennial of new media art at the National Art Museum of China in 2011. The previous exhibitions have received extensive media attention and publicity with coverage from major news outlets such as China Central Television (CCTV), China Daily, Radio China, People’s Daily, Wenhuibao, Guangming Daily, China News Agency, Beijing Daily, Southern Daily, China Youth Daily, Vision, Esquire, Domus, Vogue, New Weekly, The Art Newspaper, New York Times, International Herald Tribune, Art Asia Pacific, Artforum, and Skymedia.\n\nThese triennials have investigated the most current intellectual trends in the discourse of media art and culture, providing a prominent platform for a global presentation and theorization of cutting edge media artwork. The 2014 edition will present 58 works by 65 artists and artistic collectives from 22 countries. Most of the works in the exhibition will be shown in China for the first time.\n\nFrom metal balls ascending in an uncanny anti-gravitational movement to a Victorian sofa standing precariously à l’attitude; from miniature instruments which require a magnifying glass to peek at their elegance to monumental inflatables that entwine and elongate to permeate 5,000 square feet of gallery space; from murmuring tweets from the virtual void to billions of algorithmically generated configurations of a mere 24 cards depicting an 18th-century genre painting; from the umwelt of artifacts shuffling through a galaxy to a new ecosystem that emerges from the chemical sludges and trash vortex of the Pacific Ocean, the exhibition unfolds its three themes: Monologue: Ding An Sich; Dialogue: Ding to Thing; and Ensemble: Parliament of Things in a persuasive procession. By aligning Physical Being, Technical Being and Psychic Being (to borrow a concept of being from Gilbert Simondon) as the new vista of equality, Technology (as the reciprocal transduction of humanity and technicity) with its initiating motility may be the surprise candidate to turn anthropocentrism on its head: physical beings via technical beings achieve their own vivid presences, their own agency and autopoiesis, their own generativity, thereby evoking a conative penetration for the human being. They act and interact, dialogue and monologue, or chorus in the assemblage of the thingworld. In celebration of thingworld, there emerges an opportunity to reinvigorate the impasse of cultural production that is contingent solely on the premise of a human subject through a much-expanded field of operation; there will be a newfound world of discussions, concerns giving rise to new forms of artistic experimentation and new vocabularies of aesthetic manifestation that resonate with a vision of equity molded by a renewed political ecology, that is the “Equality of All Things.”\n\nThe catalogue accompanying the exhibition is co-published by The National Art Museum of China and The Liverpool University Press. Essay contributors include Graham Harman, Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev, Mark B.N. Hanson, Sean Cubitt, Timothy Morton, WANG Hui and ZHANG Ga.\n\nParticipating Artists\n\nAaajiao 徐文恺 | CN, Keith Armstrong | AU, & Lawrence English | AU, Cécile Babiole | FR, Ralf Baecker | DE, Christopher Baker | US, Rosa Barba | DE,\n\nVideo Container: Museum as Method\n\n2014 - Video - Museum of Contemporary Art North Miami\n\nOn March 25, the Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami (MOCA), inaugurates “Video Container: Museum as Method,” a presentation of single-channel video work by 15 contemporary artists who probe the role of the institution within artistic practice today. Part of a new MOCA video series exploring topical issues in contemporary art making, “Video Container” reflects the museum’s ongoing commitment to presenting and contextualizing experimental and critical practices, and to providing a platform for interdisciplinary media and discursive content. The program series is made possible by an endowment to the museum by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.\n\n“Video Container: Museum as Method” features videos by leading contemporary artists including: Bernadette Corporation, Loretta Fahrenholz, Harun Farocki, Andrea Fraser, Dan Graham, General Idea, William E. Jones, Maha Maamoun, Danny McDonald, Seth Price and Thomson & Craighead among others. Ranging widely in scope from abstract shorts to long-form documentary, these videos present a new form of institutional critique and attempt to de-stabilize official geopolitical, social, and transnational histories. Videos will rotate each day to address various questions, ranging from the changing relationship between artists and institutions in post-war society to the role of the artist as interpreted through media.\n\nMaps DNA and Spam\n\n2014 - Installation - Dundee Contemporary Arts\n\nWe are delighted to welcome back artists Thomson & Craighead to DCA for our first exhibition of 2014. Maps DNA and Spam features new work (Dundee Wall and The First Person) and a selection of older work including The Time Machine in alphabetical order, Belief and A short film about War.\n\nMuch of Thomson & Craighead's recent work looks at how communications networks like the worldwide web are changing the way we relate to the world around us - the conflict between our private and public identities, the tension between the global and the local and the way in which modern communications inform our sense of place and self in the world.\n\nThe exhibition includes new two new works: The First Person (2013), an endless stream of first person statements taken from American self-help websites, randomly intercut with found video footage of a burning house; and Dundee Wall (2014) a poetic snapshot of social networking traffic from within this city, published as typeset posters and pasted up within DCA.\n\nTwo earlier works in the exhibition draw on information found entirely online: A Short Film about War (2009) is a narrative documentary artwork which takes viewers around the world to a variety of war zones as seen through the collective eyes of the online photo sharing community Flickr, and as witnessed by a variety of existing military and civilian bloggers; while Belief (2011-12) presents a series of fragmented broadcasts about faith, all sourced from the video sharing community YouTube.\n\nOther works on display include The Time Machine in Alphabetical Order (2010) a complete re-edit of the 1960s film version of HG Wells Novella reconfigured by the artists into alphabetical order from beginning to end.\n\nJon Thomson, born 1969, and Alison Craighead, born 1971, studied at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art in Dundee and now live and work in Scotland and London. Jon Thomson is Reader in Fine Art at The Slade School of Fine Art, University College London, while Alison Craighead is Reader in Visual Culture and Contemporary Art at University of Westminster and lectures in Fine Art at Goldsmiths University London. Thomson & Craighead have been working together since 1993. Recent exhibitions include MEWO Kunsthalle, Memmingen and Carroll/Fletcher, London.\n\nLook Into the Net\n\n2014 - Edith-Russ-Haus für Medienkunst\n\nThe works shown in this exhibition of the internationally most relevant net artists belong to the collection of NETescopio, iniciated in 2008 and since then constantly developed by the Spanish Museum of Contemporary Art of Extremadura and Latin America – MEIAC, Badajoz. With NETescopio, the MEIAC is a pioneer in the availability of an Internet accessible art collection beyond the physical presence of the actual Museum. A selection of 120, partly no longer accessible, key works covers the panorama of net art production from the 1990s until today. This exhibition is in this sense a unique opportunity to gain an insight into the net art tendencies and their aesthetics. The main objective of the NETescopio archive, which makes also a historical classification of the collected works, is the preservation of the works, characterized by the incorporation of a large numbers of Spanish and Latin American net artists.\n\nThe curator Gustavo Romano has distinguished three strategies of artistic appropriation of the Internet with their various formats:\n\nDisassemblings\n\nDuring the web´s early years the artists started to experiment with the new medium and dealt with the possibilities of interactivity, the use of interfaces and alternative browsers. It is in the first years of web art, which can be seen in this category, that show a greater radicalism with a stress on experimentation and the deconstruction of the medium.\n\nRe/appropriations\n\nThe reuse of symbolic materials and artistic reactions to existing content play a key role in this work. In digital media information can be reproduced and manipulated, developing constant mutation. This poses in discourses to copy, original and authorship, as well as to owner and collector of net art. The artist’s role on the web is of a \"redirector\" of information.\n\nIntrusion\n\nThese works refer to artistic intervention in a new public space, the “Internet”, which involve commonly used sites such as Wikipedia or Google Maps, which parody or subvert private pages, in order to undermine them through artistic contexts. Stealthily infiltration of the user's computer or other computer systems is discussed here. The artist slips here into the role of spies, intruders and solitary flaneurs.\n\nCurated by Gustavo Romano\n\nartists:\n\n0100101110101101.org (Eva & Franco Mattes); Ivan Abreu; Amy Alexander; Marcel·lí Antúnez; Kim Asendorf; Lucas Bambozzi; Ryan Barone; Giselle Beiguelman; Amy Berk; Luther Blissett; Natalie Bookchin; Christophe Bruno; Maite Cajaraville; Martin John Callanan; Azahara Cerezo; Paolo Cirio; Arcángel Constantini; Vuk Cosic; Andy Cox; Critical Art Ensemble; Minerva Cuevas; Young-Hae Chang; Santiago Echeverry; Vadim Epstein; Evru; Fiambrera Obrera; Gonzalo Frasca; Belén Gache; Dora García; Daniel García Andújar; Gazira Babeli; Emilio Gomáriz; Ethan Ham; Luis Hernández Galván; Robin Hewlett; Steev Hise; Ricardo Iglesias; Daniel Jacoby; Sergi Jordá; Scott Kildall; Ben Kinsley; La Société Anonyme (José Luis Brea); Joan Leandre; Les Liens Invisibles; Olia Lialina; Rogelio López Cuenca; Iván Lozano; Alessandro Ludovico; Peter Luining; Fernando Llanos; Brian Mackern; Miltos Manetas; Rafael Marchetti; Iván Marino; Antonio Mendoza; Ricardo Miranda Zúñiga; Antoni Muntadas; Mark Napier; Eduardo Navas; Santiago Ortiz; Christian Oyarzún; Paolo Pedercini (Molleindustria); Raquel Rennó; Ricardo Barreto & Paula Perissinotto; Gustavo Romano; Benjamin Rosenbaum; Mario Santamaría; Santo_File (David Casacuber\n\nglobal aCtIVISm\n\n2013 - Digital Installation - Zentrum Kunst Media\n\nThe exhibition global aCtIVISm is dedicated to the field of artistic form of expression as politically inspired by actions, demonstrations and performances in the public sphere, which draw attention to socio-political grievances and call for changes to existing conditions. By means of objects, photographic, cinematographic, videographic and mass medial documents, the exhibition presents global activism as the first novel art form of the 21st century.\n\nglobal aCtIVISm serves as prelude to the exhibition marathon \"Globale\", scheduled to be held on the occasion of the 300-year anniversary of the founding of the city of Karlsruhe 2015.\n\nProject Team: Peter Weibel and Andreas Beitin, Andrea Buddensieg, Dietrich Heissenbüttel, Sabiha Keyif, Elisabeth Klotz, Sarah Maske, Linnea Semmerling, Joulia Strauss, Tatiana Volkova, Philipp Ziegler\n\nArtists\n\nAdbusters Media Foundation, G.M.B.

Viele ihrer Arbeiten befassen sich mit Live-Netzwerken wie dem Internet und damit, wie diese unser Verständnis unserer Situation und der uns umgebenden Welt verändern.\n\nThomson & Craighead verknüpfen über das Internet verfügbare Informationen mit realen Erfahrungen. So werden in der Filmarbeit Flat Earth die an und für sich neutralen Bilder von Aufklärungssatelliten mit den subjektiven Texten von Bloggern kombiniert und wandeln sich für die Betrachter dadurch zum Bestandteil einer emotionalen Erzählung. Die aus vielen Einzelbildern bestehende Videoarbeit Horizon trägt in Echtzeit Webcam-Aufnahmen aus den unterschiedlichen Zeitzonen zusammen und liefert ein eindrückliches Bild der sich mit uns drehenden und durch Tag und Nacht bewegenden Erde.\n\nDie Arbeiten von Thomson & Craighead verorten uns. Sie bieten uns eine Perspektive auf die Welt, die nicht immer mit unseren vorgefassten Erwartungen übereinstimmt, und die auch nicht der Komik entbehrt: Das Hinweisschild Hier, an der Straße vor der MEWO Kunsthalle positioniert, weist genau nach Norden und damit über beide Pole genau wieder auf uns, wie wir von uns selbst 40.008 km entfernt stehen.\n\nThomson & Craighead: Broken Webcams, 2013\n\nJon Thomson (*1969 in London) und Alison Craighead (*1971 in Aberdeen) arbeiten mit Video, Sound, Bildhauerei, Installation und dem Internet. Sie haben am Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art in Dundee studiert und arbeiten seit 1993 gemeinsam als Thomson & Craighead. Jon Thomson unterrichtet an der Slade School of Fine Art und Alison Craighead an der University of Westminster und am Goldsmiths College.

They are shown together for the first time in their single screen form at Taigh Chearsabhagh.\n\nThe trilogy covers a six-year period beginning with Flat Earth (2007), A short film about War (2009/2010) and ending with Belief (2012). In each case, the viewer is taken around the world encountering fragments taken from real peoples’ blogs, which are knitted together to form something resembling a story.\n\nIn Flat Earth, we see the visual language established where Google Earth is used as a way of joining each of these narrative moments together. A short film about War focuses more specifically on the collective gaze of photo-sharing communities like flickr as a way of apprehending the locations being spoken about, while Belief looks to the video sharing community youtube and the phenomenon of video blogging and to a lesser extent ‘trolling’, where individuals attempt to sow discord online as an end in itself.\n\nIn all of these works, the artists are interested in exploring how our own spheres of influence have been extended and transformed by the internet, allowing us to experience and broadcast information around the globe in ways unheard of even fifteen years ago.\n\nFlat Earth was made with Channel 4 and Animate Projects for television broadcast, but A short film about War and Belief have been developed as gallery installations as well as the single screen videos seen here.\n\nIn the gallery version of A short film about War, a second screen logs the provenance of images, blog fragments and GPS locations of each element comprising the work, so that the same information is simultaneously communicated to the viewer in two parallel formats -on one hand as a dramatised reportage and on the other hand as a text log.\n\nThe gallery version of Belief adds a synchronised floor projection of a compass, which interacts with the montage showing us where each clip originates in relation to the geographical location of the artwork thus placing the viewer at the centre point of a cinematic data-visualisation.\n\nIn both cases, the artists’ want us to consider our own relationship with this material -the way in which information changes as it is gathered, edited and then mediated through networked communications technologies or broadcast media, and how that changes and distorts what things mean; especially for (the generally wealthy minority of) the world’s users of high speed broadband networks, who have become used to the treacherously persuasive panoptic view that Google Earth (and the worldwide web) appears to give us.\n\nNever Odd or Even\n\n2013 - Carroll / Fletcher Gallery, London\n\nA major solo exhibition of recent work at Carroll / Fletcher Gallery in London curated by Diana Stevenson for Carroll/Fletcher gallery, London.\n\nVideonale 14 (Festival for Contemporary Video Art)\n\n2013 - Video Installation - Kunstmuseum Bonn\n\nVideonale e.V.- Association for the Advancement of Cultural Awareness in the Audio-Visual Field is committed to the presentation, mediation and promotion of contemporary works of video art and time-based art forms as well as to the conservation and study of its historical inheritance.\n\nOne of the association’s most important functions is organising an international festival of video art. Since it first took place in 1984, the VIDEONALE – Festival of Contemporary Video Art has been held every two years and, with its ambitious programme of video presentations, exhibitions, lectures and performances, soon became one of the most important festivals for video and time-based art in Germany and Europe. The participants included such pathfinders as Dara Birnbaum, Lynn Hershman, Klaus vom Bruch, Gary Hill, Keren Cytter, Marcel Odenbach, Bill Viola and Christian Jankowski. For many of these artists, VIDEONALE was the first chance to present their work to an international public. To this day VIDEONALE has remain"
