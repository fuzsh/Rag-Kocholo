        "text": "Janet Paige Thompson Wilson\n\nApril 11, 1953 - August 1, 2024\n\nJanet passed peacefully into eternal life on August 1 after a long struggle with dementia.\n\nShe was born in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, as the second of five children to James and Claire Thompson. The family moved several times, with one stop in Nassau Bay, Texas, where Janet graduated from Clear Creek High School in 1971. After a move to Decatur, Georgia, she obtained her teaching degree from Georgia State University and taught elementary school in Gwinnett County, Georgia until her retirement.\n\nJanet was a wonderful artist and also loved photography. She and her husband Frank (“Sparky”) and their beloved dog Prince moved to Foley, Alabama in 2016 to enjoy their retirement years. Here Janet took many pictures of the beach, moon and sunsets, her favorite subjects.\n\nHer many friends describe her as one of a kind … fun … adventurous … loving … a beautiful smile … a huge heart … generous …. a lover of animals … a quick Irish temper! … good at everything she did … But most of all she loved her daughter and her two grandchildren to the moon and back!\n\nJanet is survived by her husband Frank Wilson of Foley, AL; the Ferguson family of Chicago, IL - her daughter Teresa, son-in-law Kevin and beloved grandchildren Gwen and Wade; her sisters Pamela Dunn of Pelham, AL, and Katie Heusel (Lawrenceville, GA); her brothers Jim (Debbie) Thompson of Jacksonville, FL and Patrick (Eleanor) of Suwanee, GA; and many nieces and nephews. She is predeceased by her parents James and Claire Thompson.\n\nA celebration of life will be held at a later date.\n\nJanet’s great grandmother Mary came over to America from Ireland in an arranged marriage. In their honor we say this Irish blessing.\n\n“May the road rise up\n\nto meet you. May the wind be\n\nalways at your back.\n\nMay the sun shine warm upon\n\nyour face; the rains fall soft\n\nupon your fields and until we\n\nmeet again, may God hold you\n\nin the palm of His hand.\n\nAmen”\n\nRest in peace. You are loved and missed.\n\nTo order memorial trees or send flowers to the family in memory of Janet Paige Thompson Wilson, please visit our flower store."
