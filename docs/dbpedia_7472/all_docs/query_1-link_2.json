        "text": "I am honoring my mother, Janet Thompson, on her birthday (September 1) because she is a very special person in my life. She means the world to me and not only is she my mother, but my best friend.\n\nShe has given so much of herself to our family. She's always there when we need her. Family has always been very important to her. She is such a loving grandmother to our children. She makes a point to spend a lot of time with them and makes them feel important and special. We are so fortunate to have her for our mother and grandmother.\n\nShe also does a lot of volunteer work at our church. Religion is an important part of her life and she has instilled that in her children.\n\nJanet Louise Sydnes Thompson was born on September 1, 1934, to Tilmer and Carrie (Wee) Sydnes in rural Story County, Iowa. She graduated from Huxley High School, Huxley, Iowa in 1952. She married Gary Thompson (Roland, Iowa) son of Maurice and Abbie (Hemness) Thompson on August 14, 1955, at Palestine Lutheran Church in Huxley, Iowa.\n\nShe has three children: Kim Louise born on February 24, 1958. She married Tom Wierson on June 9, 1979. They have two children, Matthew Gary (March 11, 1985) and Chelsea Janet (March 22, 1988).\n\nRicky Lee was born on February 26, 1960. He married Renee Crockett on April 26, 1986. They have two children, Rachel Marie (December 22, 1988) and Erica Lynn (December 4, 1990).\n\nScott Alan was born on April 15, 1965. He married Mary Hoffmann on July 27, 1991. They are expecting their first child in May 1995.\n\nAs a tribute to my mother I would like to dedicate this poem to her, written by Susan Polis Schutz.\n\nTO MY MOTHER\n\nFor as long as I can remember\n\nyou were always by my side\n\nto give me support\n\nto give me confidence\n\nto give me help\n\nFor as long as I can remember\n\nyou were always the person\n\nI looked up to\n\nso strong\n\nso sensitive\n\nso pretty\n\nFor as long as I can remember\n\nand still today\n\nyou are everything\n\na mother should be ...\n\nFor as long as I can remember\n\nyou always provided stability\n\nwithin our family\n\nfull of laughter\n\nfull of tears\n\nfull of love\n\nWhatever I have become\n\nis because of you\n\nand I thank you\n\nforever for our relationship.\n\nSubmitted on 7/1/96"
