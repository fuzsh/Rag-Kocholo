If the last definition was created in 1958, then how do we find one and create a new one which resonates with the expansion of migrant narratives hereafter. This publication represents an important entry point in the conversation of social mobility, migration and immigration. As the world grows ever-increasingly interconnected we must begin to take the time to consider the implications of integrating what was termed in the 1950s as ‘Third Culture’. To do this, we have sought to bring together a wide selection of intersectional global communities to be present in this document, thus welcoming all voices, positions, practices, identifications and everything in between to further define the evolving narratives as embedded in Third Culture testimony in 2021 and beyond."
