When he was 3, he had taken a fruit-drink commercial too literally — “Hey, how about a nice Hawaiian punch?” ended with a fist to his mother’s face — so his parents decided to limit his television consumption. But on the weekends, they bent the rules and, around 12:45 a.m., nudged him awake. He would grab his crocheted-by-Grandma blanket and head downstairs, where he would switch on the television, wait for it to warm up and then crank the dial to Channel 48 as quietly as he could. Right at 1 a.m., he was greeted by a magical locomotive — chugging along so rhythmically that it almost seemed to dance, flipping gray buildings it passed into psychedelic colors — for his regular dose of peace, love and “Soul Train.”\n\nBecause “Soul Train” was the only show, besides “Sesame Street,” that he was allowed to watch as a child, and because Thompson, who you might better know as Questlove, grew up into the sort of adult who relies on an extensive knowledge of music to make sense of the world, his childhood memories are impossible to separate from which episode of “Soul Train” was playing at the time. The two are knotted together so intricately that the archive of the show and the archive of his brain are the same. An afternoon episode of “Soul Train” was playing — Curtis Mayfield, the Main Ingredient — when a 2-year-old Thompson rushed from the bathtub and toddled, still wet, into the living room, where he slipped and fell, his skin making contact with the radiator about 90 seconds into Mayfield’s performing “Freddie’s Dead,” right when the horns start crying. For decades, he was branded with a burn in the shape of a train track. The song still sounds sinister to him.\n\nThe first time he colored with the big Crayola box with the sharpener in the back? Sugarfoot leading Ohio Players. The time the Isley Brothers got to perform for an entire hour? Thompson was watching from a Valley Forge hotel, trying to replicate with his tennis racket Ernie Isley’s guitar solo — which Isley played with his mouth — forever changing the trajectory of Thompson’s two front teeth. When his ninth-grade girlfriend dumped him? The Thelma Houston episode was on that night. The day a teenage Thompson and his friend Tariq Trotter (better known now as Black Thought) performed music in public for the first time? They got the guts during a commercial break of “Soul Train.” The two have now been performing together as part of the Roots for decades.\n\nThompson missed the day his close friend and collaborator D’Angelo recorded his career-defining single, “Untitled (How Does It Feel),” for “Voodoo,” an album otherwise stamped with Thompson’s fingertips — because he was in Japan, digitizing 100 old episodes of “Soul Train,” refusing to get back on the plane home until he finished. It was 1997, and because of licensing issues, the trove was the first time he had been able to rewatch full episodes in decades. A Patti LaBelle episode sounded like getting snowed in with his cousins and making banana pancakes; Johnny (Guitar) Watson playing “Tarzan” took Thompson back to burning Jiffy Pop with his sister. For days, all he did was sit and watch and weep — he felt as if he had his childhood back.\n\nThompson now owns around 600 episodes of the show, which ended in 2006, though his collection is clustered mostly in the 1970s and 1980s. “Soul Train,” he explained, is his comfort food, his shortcut to joy. He plays the episodes in a constant loop on whichever screen is closest to him. The first time we met in person, “Soul Train” was playing on both television screens of his tour bus; the last time we talked by phone, he had just arrived home from a trip and, before even taking off his coat, had flipped on the show. “ ‘Soul Train’ served as a diary of what happened that week,” he said. “Retrieving these episodes allows me a chance to remember it — I didn’t have camera phones — and my memory breaks are all that I had in processing my childhood.” There is true love, which you can find time and time again, and then there is “Soul Train.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
