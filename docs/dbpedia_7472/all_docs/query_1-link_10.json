Her retirement years allowed her the time to make beautiful quilts that will be enjoyed by her family for generations to come. She was loved by those close to her and will be forever missed.\n\nShe is preceded in death by her father Gerald, mother Thelma, and siblings Robert and Linda. She is survived by her husband, Emil; her siblings, Jerry, Dennis, Cindy and Gloria; her children, Beth and Matt; and her grandchildren, Claire, Grace, Calla and Delia.\n\nA private service will be held at Fort Snelling National Cemetery once safe to gather."
