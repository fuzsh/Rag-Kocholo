        "text": "Following a long career editing magazines for the licensed black cab trade (her first husband was a licensed London cab driver), she also wrote all kinds of features for all kinds of magazines including Dogs Today when she and Barney the Beardie crawled through an agility tunnel at the Royal Windsor Horse Show in front of thousands of laughing onlookers. She also organised a World of Sport Taxi Racing Day when Page Three Girls, Radio One DJ’s and London cab drivers all battled it out and Janet showed off her prowess at the wheel having been taught to drive by none other than F1 Champion Graham Hill.\n\nNow nearly 77 she’s sort of retired and living on the Herts/Essex borders near Hatfield Forest with her second husband (also a licensed London cab driver!) where her house is crammed with books in every conceivable corner. Left handed, Janet has recently learnt to crochet and if you’re lucky you’ll be the recipient of one of her massive multi coloured throws as that’s apparently all she can crochet.\n\nShe can also be found stalking the book aisles in supermarkets spying on readers’ choices, whilst operating an unofficial library for friends and families. She’s now busy sleuthing dog friendly UK holidays.\n\nPreparing for the Event\n\nFor the best experience, you will need to have Zoom downloaded onto your computer. Please ensure you're connected to broadband/wifi rather than using your mobile phone connection (3G/4G).\n\nWe also recommend that pets are either calmly sitting on your lap or in another room, and any refreshments you may require are within your reach!"
