Through an array of sculpted forms, narrative photography, interactive video, and immersive installation, the artists delve and explore aspects of ideas and their construction, allowing viewers to see them from different angles and new perspectives. Visit Artsy for images of the exhibition.\n\nMckee Frazior | Austin Lewis | Raul Rodriguez | Eli Ruhala\n\nPress:\n\nLumber, Labor, and Love: TCU’s 2024 MFA Candidacy Exhibition, Jessica Fuentes\n\nCollege of Fine Arts – Q&A Creating the MFA Candidacy Exhibition\n\nMarch 1 – May 4, 2024: Children Need Love Like Flowers Need Rain\n\nJooYoung Choi creates fictional worlds through interdisciplinary means. Utilizing bright colors, dense imagery and sensuous textures, JooYoung Choi creates a dynamic and playful energy between objects; collectively the works entice viewers to consider the human spirit. Employing painting, video, sculpture, animation and installation art, she documents the interconnecting narratives of The Cosmic Womb, an expansive, and partly autobiographical, imagined land. With its own characters and mythology, this imaginary space allows Choi to explore her own identity through multiple roles and different characters. Guided by this creative narrative, she explores themes such as anti-racism, gender inclusivity, trans-racial adoptee rights, post-traumatic growth, and spirituality rooted in social justice.

Including photography, sculpture, video and installation, this exhibition highlights the migrant experience through the lens of Vietnamese Americans. While many of the works are inspired by the artists’ personal and familial history, various connecting threads are revealed as both artists explore universal themes including migration, resilience, loss, memory and identity. “Family traditions and stories touch and connect all of our lives,” Nguyễn said. “Knowing where we come from is an important foundation to know who we are today.”\n\nAnn Le | Trinh Mai | Kim Phan Nguyễn\n\nOctober 13 – November 17, 2023: Pleasure & Protest\n\nConceptual threads connecting these five artists center on exploring or re-situating domestic craft and decorative art practices in relation to painting the figure. They employ strategies of pattern, gesture and repetition through a range of materials and methods including watercolor, fresco-secco, wallpaper, clay and embroidery. Their works celebrate handwork and revel in the pleasures of tactile surfaces, decoration and ornamentation.\n\nOver forty years on from the groundbreaking Pattern and Decoration art movement, works by these five artists prompt fresh discussion about the renewed value of craft in contemporary art practices. Collectively their work protests against hierarchies in subject and material, and their concerns in paint reflect current feminist discourse about cultural identity, representation and making.\n\nJackie Gendel | Lovie Olivia | Yana Payusova | Alexis Pye | Keer Tanchak\n\nMoudy Gallery\n\nAugust 24 – September 14: Passage, New Works by Chris Powell\n\nSeptember 21 – October 19: Dear Frank, I wish…Love, Gabi 2/2/23 Gabi Magaly\n\nOctober 25 – November 1: Honors Studio / Art Education\n\nNovember 6 – 11: Honors Graphic Design\n\nNovember 16 – 30: BFA Studio Art Thesis Exhibition\n\nDecember 4 – 8: BFA Graphic Design Thesis Exhibition\n\nFort Worth Contemporary Arts\n\nJanuary 20 – February 18, 2023: Criss Cross Applesauce: MFA Candidacy Exhibition 2023\n\nThe 2023 MFA Candidacy Exhibition featured the work of second year Master’s of Fine Arts Candidates Max Marshall and Lauren Walker. With playful intention, the work in this exhibition explored the power of constructed narratives and the spaces that act as their settings through mediums of sculpture, painting, and drawing.\n\nMax Marshall received her BFA in Painting and Drawing with a second major in Art History, from The University of North Texas in 2015. In her current body of work, she examines the origins and creators of popularized American folklore which historically cowboys as individualistic and stoic seekers of justice. By fabricating her tall tale of a species of giant Cowboys and setting this revised origin story within the guise of roadside museums and highway attractions, Max creates a stage on which the popular Cowboy archetype can be critiqued as similarly flawed or absurd. With tongue in cheek, the resulting work asks questions of how, who constructed it and to what depth does it resound within our modern culture?\n\nLauren Walker’s current body of work explores the dollhouse as it relates to her personal experiences with femininity, sexuality, shared domestic space and make-believe. Through painting and ceramics, the resulting work uses playful gestures to elicit a queer narrative, disrupting the notion of idealized space. She invites the viewer to approach the work with their personal experiences of the domestic in mind, with questions of scale, materiality, and color palette shaping this ongoing research. Lauren is a Fort Worth native and received her BFA in Painting from Stephen F. Austin State University.\n\nRead Glasstire’s review of the show by Jessica Fuentes here\n\nMarch 24 – May 6, 2023: 150 years / 150 Artists\n\nIn conjunction with TCU’s sesquicentennial, the School of Art hosted a group exhibition featuring the work of 150 artists in all media accompanied by an exhibition publication that explored the legacy of the visual arts at TCU.

In reference to Christina Sharpe’s writings on representations of Black life, the title of Weaver’s exhibition responds to multiple understandings of “wake” – the temporary and ephemeral path behind a boat, a social ritual associated with funerals and a celebration of the dead, and the idea of awakening or becoming conscious. For his exhibition at Fort Worth Contemporary Arts Weaver responded to “wake” with a selection of objects that collectively weave together intersecting concerns of memory and identity. Referencing historic maritime culture, his new work included the skeletal frame of a boat hull, an anchor, and part of a lighthouse. He also included family photographic portraiture and a film that documents the wake of a boat on the Little Calumet River, a location that was once an important part of the Underground railroad on the South Side of Chicago.\n\nOct 19 – Nov 18, 2022: Yours, in Extraction: Robyn Woolston\n\nRobyn Woolston’s socially-engaged practice elicits site-specific responses to environmental concerns and human agency. Her work across installation, photography, moving image and print explores concerns ranging from economic imperatives and government policy to ecological grief and the psychological effects of the climate crisis. For the Art Galleries at TCU Woolston presented a new film and discursive objects resulting from ideas and materials gathered during two residency periods in Fort Worth (November 2019 and January 2022) and through collaboration with TCU’s Department of Psychology and BRIT, the Botanical Research Institute of Texas.

[3D Walkthrough]\n\nThe Art Galleries at TCU are pleased to present Persona, three solo exhibitions featuring the work of Richie Budd, Kris Pierce and John Rasimus. The exhibitions run February 25 – April 30, 2022 at Fort Worth Contemporary Art and opens with a reception for the artists on Friday, February 25, 6-8pm. Budd and Rasimus will present artist talks in the gallery on Saturday, February 26, at 2pm. Pierce will present an artist talk in the gallery on Saturday, March 26, at 2pm. Additional live programming to be confirmed soon.\n\nThe artists describe Persona as loosely referencing Ingmar Bergman’s 1966 Swedish film of the same title; an experimental, psychological drama renowned for its perplexing suggestion that the two main characters experience a type of an emotional convergence. Formatted as three concurrent solo exhibitions, the artists’ work circles ideas relating to identity, duality, and character as traits of humans’ inherent need to distinguish and validate their existence as individuals.\n\nThrough these individual presentations, the artists consider the development of persona in real and digital space, including involvement of physical senses. In different ways they each speak to a complicated desire to exist at the center of one’s own universe. Working within an anti-collaborative format, a web of connections between the artists’ approaches is revealed without the dynamics of a traditional group exhibition or the type of social alliance that informs much contemporary media.\n\nPERSONA 3D Walkthrough\n\nThree Solo Exhibitions:\n\nOil Can Tremolo by Kris Pierce\n\nHideout by John Rasimus\n\nMoudy Gallery\n\nFebruary 14 – 19: The 2022 Annual Juried Student Exhibition, selected by guest jurors Doug Gault and Joey Luong from Cufflink Art [3D Walkthrough]\n\nFebruary 24 – March 2: Fernando Alvarez MFA Thesis Exhibition [3D Walkthrough]\n\nMarch 14 – 19: Doug Land MFA Thesis Exhibition [3D Walkthrough]\n\nMarch 24 – 30: Corrie Thompson MFA Thesis Exhibition\n\nApril 4 – 9: Adrianna Touch MFA Thesis Exhibition\n\nApril 13 – 21: 2022 BFA Studio Senior Exhibition\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nCurrent Exhibitions and Programs\n\nThe Fall 2021 semester at The Art Galleries at TCU was a whirlwind of exhibitions and activity!

Through a rigorous curatorial process of research, creative collaboration and interdisciplinary partnerships, the galleries showcase excellent artistic practice and high-quality art, while supporting experimentation and innovation. To support students and faculty, the galleries act as a catalyst for critical dialogue and provide a vital avenue for professional development through investigation of contemporary art practices.\n\nMoudy Gallery\n\nLocated in the same building that houses the School of Art, Moudy Gallery showcases student work, including exhibitions by undergraduates and MFA students. This 900-square-foot space also functions as a responsive place for one-off or pop-up projects that students and faculty develop. TCU regularly shows its support for local professional artists by providing a collaborative environment in the Moudy Gallery as a testing ground for work-in-progress. Exhibitions or events of this kind help artists get involved in numerous ways and significantly benefit TCU students by enabling them to develop their professional networks with the local creative community.\n\nFort Worth Contemporary Arts\n\nFort Worth Contemporary Arts (FWCA) is a satellite exhibition space located a few blocks from the School of Art, on the edge of the TCU campus. Situated on West Berry Street, a busy urban corridor, this 2,000-square-foot gallery is TCU’s public-facing art venue. It offers a great opportunity for students, faculty, staff and alumni to engage with the Dallas-Fort Worth community.\n\nAt FWCA, the curatorial focus revolves around national and international artists at different stages of their career. It often includes work that has never been shown in Texas before or that is made on-site during a residency period. This concentration means students have close access to high-quality art and can critically engage with artists on a one-on-one basis in the gallery.\n\nFort Worth Contemporary Arts is located at 2900 W. Berry St. on the edge of the TCU Campus, Fort Worth, TX 76109.\n\nView current and past exhibitions on Artsy.\n\nOpportunities for Students\n\nStudents can volunteer or intern as gallery attendants. Interns are typically assigned responsibilities and research, such as overseeing social media for the galleries and researching artists’ work for future exhibition projects.\n\nIn addition, graduate students are assigned to the galleries each semester and complete weekly tasks including installation/deinstallation of exhibitions, delivery of live events and maintenance of the permanent art collection.\n\nPhoto: Post-Processing by Cisco Merel at Fort Worth Contemporary Arts, 2017"
