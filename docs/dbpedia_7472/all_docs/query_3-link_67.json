        "text": "Leonard Irwin Bregman ‘43, 96 of Ocala, FL, passed away peacefully at home, after a difficult battle with skin cancer, on January 21, 2022. Leonard (Len) was born in Brooklyn, NY, in 1925 to parents, Michael and Celia Bregman. He was the oldest of three boys. Robert Bregman and Gerald Bregman have both predeceased him. At the age of 4, the family moved into Manhattan settling into an apartment on Central Park West. He attended the Horace Mann School for Boys, graduating in 1943, then enrolled for a summer term at Harvard University, when tuition was just $100. He was 16 when the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred. He was still 17 when, at the end of the summer term, he enlisted in the Army. After basic training at Fort Benning, GA, he was assigned to the 87th Infantry Division. He shipped out from Camp Kilmer, NJ, on the Queen Elizabeth for the five-day trip to Grenoch, Scotland. Ultimately, on the night of December 15, 1944, he spent the night in a fox hole and on the 16th of December was wounded in the Battle of the Bulge. He received the Purple Heart and was discharged from the Army on August 14, 1945. He returned to Harvard University in the fall of 1945 with the help of the GI Bill. The tuition had skyrocketed from $100 to $500 per semester! At Harvard he was a cartoonist on the Harvard Lampoon where his artwork graced many a cover. He graduated with the Class of 1947. He was a long-time member of the Harvard Club of New York. He married Virginia Ferguson Bregman, a graduate of Smith College, in 1953. They lived in NYC where he worked with his father and brothers at Michael Bregman and Sons, a stock brokerage firm. His career included starting Bregman Cummings and Co., a short stint with Bear Stearns and ending his career at Kimmelman & Baird. He loved watching and analyzing stocks with his brother, Bob, well into his 90’s. Len and Ginny moved to the \"country\", Chester, NY, when their first daughter was born. There they raised three daughters, Laurie, Tracy, and Alcinda. Ginny bred English Mastiffs and the girls participated in many a horse show. Len spent many a day mowing fields on his beloved John Deere tractor. Len and his brother, Bob, invested in a standard bred horse breeding and racing operation, Buttonwood Tree Farm, in the early 70’s. Some epic parties occurred there during the Historic Goshen Track Race Week. Len was always a gentleman, loved by all who knew him. He had the patience of a saint and was generous to a fault. He will be sorely missed! He is survived by his daughters, Laurie (Carl) Kerschen of Clarkdale, AZ; Tracy Bregman of Ocala, FL; and Alcinda (Randy) Wolff of Sparks, NV; two grandchildren, Lindsey (Kris) Buran and Hannah Kerschen; and one great-grandson, Theodore Buran.

Allan was born January 18, 1926, in New York, NY.\n\nJoel Markowitz ’44, age 95, died in the early hours of January 1, 2023, at home. Doting husband for 68 years of the late pianist Elizabeth Rich; adored and loving brother to his \"dear little baby sister,\" The Honorable Sondra Miller ‘46; extraordinary father to John, Adam and Anne Markowitz; adoring, proud grandfather of Caitlin Smith and Nicholas, Oliver and Cordelia Bellinson, and astonished great-grandfather of Ray and Milo Smith. He was also admiring mentor and surrogate father to his nephew and niece, David and Wendy Miller. Joel was born in Brooklyn to Idel and Mina Markowitz and attended the Horace Mann School, Cornell University and Columbia University School of Physicians and Surgeons. He was in the Navy in 1945. Immediately drawn to psychiatry, he was a Freudian psychiatrist in private practice for 64 years, until his illness in October 2022. His patients were, after his family, the most important people in his life. An eternal optimist about the movement forward of the human group, he also wrote and lectured about psychohistory - not only what happened, but why historical events happened the way they did. He often stated that, in parallel to Freud's description of individual development, the human group is leaving latency for adolescence and reaching for early maturity. He valued experience over wealth, typewriters over cars, mind over material. He cared nothing for what people thought of his choices. He had a pet crow and could recite hundreds of poems from memory. One of the first joggers in Central Park, he looked out over his beloved park even in his last days. A man of unusual empathy, insight, tolerance and compassion, he brought love, understanding, and help to the lives of everyone who knew him. He leaves an enormous void in our lives, but we will carry him on in our hearts and minds.
