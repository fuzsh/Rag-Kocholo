        "text": "Born in Southampton in 1988, Luke Thompson is best known for playing Benedict Bridgerton in the Bridgerton television series. The West End actor will star in A Little Life at the Harold Pinter Theatre.\n\nAfter growing up in France, Thompson took a year out of education to train with the Year Out Drama Company. The Stratford-upon-Avon-based group focus on creating ensemble work.\n\nAfter a year training, Thompson then attended the University of Bristol, graduating with an English and Drama degree. He then graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 2013, studying alongside classmate Jessie Buckley.\n\nThompson made his London debut in A Midsummer Night’s Dream at Shakespeare’s Globe and quickly made an impression in the world — he earned an Evening Standard Award nomination for Best Newcomer. The same year, he also starred in Blue Stockings at the same theatre.\n\nHis affinity to Shakespeare's Globe continued: he played Mark Antony in Julius Caesar in 2014, and Ithocles in The Broken Heart at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in 2015.\n\nThe Almeida Theatre became Thompson's next London theatre: he starred as Orestes in Robert Icke's Oresteia in 2015 and as Laertes in the Andrew Scott-led Hamlet in 2017. For the latter, he eventually reprised the role in the West End transfer.\n\nHe continued the Shakespeare trend by playing Edgar in the Ian McKellen-led King Lear at the Duke of York’s Theatre in 2018. Coincidentally, his Bridgerton co-star, Jonathan Bailey, played Edgar at Chichester Festival Theatre that same year. Talk about brotherly love!\n\nAway from the stage, Thompson is best known for playing Benedict, the second eldest Bridgerton sibling, in the Bridgerton Netflix series. Many West End actors feature in Bridgerton, including Golda Rosheuvel, Nicola Coughlan, and Regé-Jean Page. Thompson also features in Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk film."
