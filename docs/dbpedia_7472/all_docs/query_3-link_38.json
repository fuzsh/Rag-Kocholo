Taffel, “Recent Patterns in Cesarean Delivery in the United States,” Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America 15 (December 1988): 607-27; Michelle J. K. Osterman and Joyce A. Martin, “Trends in Low-risk Cesarean Delivery in the United States, 1990-2013,” National Vital Statistics Reports 63 (November 5, 2014), available online at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr63/nvsr63_06.pdf, accessed April 11, 2017.\n\n2 American obstetricians performed 1,272,503 cesareans in 2015. For current cesarean rates see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/delivery.htm.\n\n3 Between the early nineteenth century and 1871, Robert Harris, a physician, medical statistician, and prodigious collector of data on cesarean sections, found evidence of 85 cesareans performed in the United States. Robert Harris Collection, Wangensteen Historical Library of Biology and Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, hereinafter referred to as the Harris Collection. Cesarean birth rates in the 1940s and 1950s are estimates based on local rates. Cesareans at Duke University Hospital in Durham, North Carolina, for example, decreased slightly between 1930 and 1950, from 2.5 to 2.3 percent of births. Obstetrics Logs, Book 1 January 1930-July 1932, Book 5 September 14, 1940-December 1941, and Book 15 August 29, 1949-June 17, 1950, Duke University Medical Center Archives, Durham, North Carolina. Other estimates set the rate at between 1 and 6 percent nationwide, although most areas of the country hovered closer to the low end. Between 1941 and 1949 at Johns Hopkins Hospital, for example, doctors performed 1,000 cesareans in 21,739 deliveries, a rate of 4.6 percent; doctors at Hopkins admitted being on the high end of the spectrum. In Alabama the overall rate was 1.32 percent from 1945 to 1947. Nicholson J. Eastman, Williams Obstetrics (New York: Apple-Century-Crofts, Inc., 1950), 1099-1101.\n\n4 For more on the history of obstetric anesthesia, see Jacqueline H. Wolf, Deliver Me from Pain: Anesthesia and Birth in America (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009). The first sterile surgical room opened in the United States in 1889 at Johns Hopkins Hospital. For more on asepsis during childbirth see Sherwin B. Nuland, The Doctors’ Plague: Germs, Childbed Fever, and the Strange Story of Ignác Semmelweis (New York: W. W. Norton, 2003), 179; Irvine Loudon, The Tragedy of Childbed Fever (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), 130-33. Improved surgical techniques for cesareans in the late nineteenth century included Italian obstetrician Edorado Porro’s removal of the uterus and ovaries after the surgery to prevent infection and hemorrhage and German obstetrician Max Sänger’s suturing of the uterus after the surgery. Prior to Sänger, physicians sutured only the abdominal wound. See Edwin Bradford Cragin, Obstetrics: A Practical Text-Book for Students and Practitioners (Philadelphia and New York: Lea & Febiger, 1916), 788; Joseph B. DeLee, The Principles and Practice of Obstetrics (Philadelphia and London: W. B. Saunders Company, 1918), 1027; W. S. Playfair, A Treatise on the Science and Practice of Midwifery with Notes and Additions by Robert P. Harris (Philadelphia: Leas Brothers & Co., 1889), available online at http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nnc2.ark:/13960/t2697x784;view=1up;seq=13, accessed July 31, 2017), and Theophilus Parvin, The Science and Art of Obstetrics (Philadelphia: Lea Brothers & Co., 1890), 680-687. Sänger’s 200-page book, written in German, published in 1881, and devoted wholly to cesarean surgery, was titled Der Kaiserschnitt (The Cesarean). His 1903 obituary ended with this high praise: “whatever minor services to science and to humanity may shrink into insignificance, or perhaps be forgotten, one great achievement will stand out in all future histories of obstetrics and gynecology by the association of the name of Max Sänger with the Conservative Caesarean Section.” Obituary Notice: Max Sänger, The Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the British Empire 3 (1903): 292-294, quote on 294. For the story of the first antibiotic, made available to civilians after WWII, see Eric Lax, The Mold in Dr. Florey’s Coat: The Story of the Penicillin Miracle (New York: Henry Holt and Company, 2004.) For more on the history of the post-WWII global blood industry, see Douglas Starr, Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce (Great Britain: Little, Brown and Company, 1999), 121-143, 185-204.\n\n5 In 2010, statisticians announced that cesarean section had become, at about 1.4 million cesareans annually, the most commonly performed surgical procedure in the United States, surpassing surgical abortion. Denise Grady, “Caesarean Births Are at a High in the U.S.,” New York Times, March 23, 2010.\n\n6 Cord prolapse occurs in from .14 to .61 percent of births—most articles cite a .28 percent rate. See D. Uygur, S. Kis, R. Tuncer, F. S. Özcan, S. Erkaya, “Risk factors and infant outcomes associated with umbilical cord prolapse,” International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics 78 (August 2002): 127-30. Placenta previa occurs in about .4 percent of births. A. S. Faiz and C. V. Ananth, “Etiology and risk factors for placenta previa: an overview and meta-analysis of observational studies,” The Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine 13 (2003): 175-190. Placental abruption occurs in .65 percent of births. Cande V. Ananth and Allen J. Wilcox, “Placental abruption and perinatal mortality,” American Journal of Epidemiology 153 (2001): 332-337. Transverse lie occurs in .12% of births. Mikael Gardberg, Yana Leonova, and Eero Laakkonen, “Malpresentation—impact on mode of delivery,” ACTA Obstetrica et Gynecologica Scandinavica 90 (2011): 540-542.\n\n7 Thomas H. Strong, Expecting Trouble: The Myth of Prenatal Care in America (New York: New York University Press, 2000), 3.\n\n8 The World Health Organization (WHO) has long claimed that the optimal cesarean rate is between 5 and 10 percent of births, and that any rate above 15 percent is likely to do more harm than good. Fernando Althabe and José M. Belizán, “Caesarean Section: The Paradox,” The Lancet 368 (2006): 1472-73.\n\n9 Other factors in the medical culture that have contributed to the precipitous increase in cesareans include: the advent of new diagnostic tools (the Friedman curve in the 1950s and the Bishop score in the 1960s) which redefined “normal” labor and birth and, in doing so, made cesarean births more likely; machinery, in addition to the fetal monitor, such as sonographic equipment, that changed the nature of the relationship between the fetus and the outside world; the fee-for-service system that encourages American physicians to overtreat their patients; an insurance system that reimburses obstetricians more than twice as much to perform an uncomplicated cesarean than to attend an uncomplicated vaginal birth; and changes in the training of obstetric residents that focused on recognizing and alleviating dubious risks rather than learning techniques to nurture vaginal birth. In the culture at large, the faith in medical technology that came with the antibiotic age, the American penchant for scheduling and time-keeping, and the sweeping change in women’s lives beginning in the 1970s converged with the changes in medical culture to normalize cesarean section and pathologize vaginal birth. The author discusses these and other factors contributing to the increase in cesarean sections in the United States in her book, Cesarean Section: An American History of Risk, Technology, and Consequence (Johns Hopkins University Press, forthcoming in 2018).\n\n10 Some of those stories appear in Nancy Wainer Cohen and Lois J. Estner, Silent Knife: Cesarean Prevention and Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC) (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey Publishers, Inc., 1983), xvi-xviii.\n\n11 In the 85 cesareans performed in the U.S. between the early nineteenth century and 1871, 44 women died—a mortality rate of almost 52 percent. Bound, handwritten journal, The Caesarean Operations of the United States by Robert P. Harris, M.D. Philadelphia 1879, Harris collection. Francis Ramsbotham, a renowned London obstetrician, reported in 1841 that 90 percent of the cesareans performed in the British Isles had ended in maternal death. Francis H. Ramsbotham, The Principles and Practice of Obstetric Medicine and Surgery, in Reference to the Process of Parturition (London: John Churchill, Princes Street, Soho, 1841), 225.\n\n12 Robert Barnes, Lectures on Obstetric Operations, Including the Treatment of Haemorrhage, and Forming a Guide to the Management of Difficult Labor (J. and A. Churchill, 1871), 312, 315.\n\n13 This was not the first cesarean performed in the United States but rather the first one formally reported to the medical community. At least three other, unpublished cesareans occurred between “early” in the nineteenth century—the exact dates are unknown—and 1825. See Harris, “The Caesarean Operations of the United States.” According to the historian of medicine, Fielding H. Garrison, the first cesarean section in the U.S. occurred in rural Virginia at an unspecified time and was unreported for many years. The case is not recorded in Harris’s journal so there is no means of corroborating the claim. An account of this surgery. along with accounts of other early cesareans in the U.S. and Europe, can be found in Alan Frank Guttmacher, Into This Universe: The Story of Human Birth (New York: The Viking Press, 1937), 251-267.\n\n14 John L.

Since 1996, the author has conducted interviews with retired obstetricians, practicing obstetricians, obstetric residents, and family physicians who made obstetrics part of their practice. Since 2004, the author has also interviewed mothers who gave birth by cesarean. The author recruited physicians by emailing all obstetricians and obstetric residents at large hospitals in Chicago and at local hospitals and obstetric practices in rural Ohio. The author recruited mothers through second parties and by snowball sampling. To achieve an urban/rural representation of experiences, interviews of both mothers and physicians took place in two locales: Chicago and rural Ohio. The physicians interviewed received their training between the late 1930s and the 2010s; the mothers gave birth by cesarean between 1971 and the 2010s. The Ohio University Institutional Review Board required that all interviews be anonymous.\n\n27 Abraham Flexner, Medical Education in the United States and Canada: A Report to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, 1910), 117-18.\n\n28 Clyde L.

Nancy Y. Rhoden, “Informed Consent in Obstetrics: Some Special Problems,” Western New England Law Review 9 (1987): 67-88. Yet there is no evidence that the maximin strategy achieves better results. See H. Brody and J.R. Thompson, “The Maximin Strategy in Modern Obstetrics,” Journal of Family Practice 12 (June 1981): 977-86. For more on women’s complaints that informed consent has been inconsistently implemented during childbirth, see Holly Goldberg, “Informed Decision Making in Maternity Care,” Journal of Perinatal Education 18 (Winter 2009): 32-40. Judith Walzer Leavitt was the first to argue that women controlled birthing practices until birth moved to the hospital. See Leavitt, Brought to Bed.\n\n33 For more descriptions of obstetricians’ postwar hospital protocols see Wolf, Deliver Me from Pain, 105-135; Judith Walzer Leavitt, Make Room for Daddy: The Journey from Waiting Room to Birthing Room (University of North Carolina Press, 2009), 21-47; and Suzanne Arms, Immaculate Deception: A New Look at Women and Childbirth (Bantam Books, 1975), 62-106.\n\n34 Interview by author with retired obstetrician, Chicago area, 12 July 1996, transcribed from tape recording.\n\n35 Ibid.\n\n36 “The doctor talks about babies by appointment,” McCall’s 84 (January 1957): 4, 81.\n\n37 July 12, 1996 interview.\n\n38 For the history of “twilight sleep,” see Wolf, Deliver Me from Pain, 44-72.\n\n39 July 12, 1996 interview. Feminist scholars have documented the relatively recent medical regimentation of childbirth. See, for example, Barbara Katz Rothman, In Labor: Women and Power in the Birthplace (New York and London: W. W. Norton & Company, 1991), 29-77.\n\n40 Gladys Denny Shultz, “Journal Mothers Report on Cruelty in Maternity Wards,” Ladies’ Home Journal, May 1958, 44-45, 152-55.\n\n41 Gayle Smith, “Angry and Happy at the Same Time,” in Janet Isaacs Ashford, Birth Stories: The Experience Remembered (Trumansburg, New York: The Crossing Press, 1984), 101-106, quotes on 103 and 105.\n\n42 Deborah Regal, “Home Birth After Two Cesareans,” in Ashford, 124-129, quote on 124. That mothers are not given the opportunity to consent to treatments during labor is implied by the conclusions of the “Listening to Mothers” surveys conducted by Childbirth Connection in partnership with Lamaze International. The national survey of U.S. women who gave birth in 2005 found that most mothers believed in the value of avoiding unnecessary medical interference but were nevertheless subjected to a broad array of interventions and were poorly informed about their potential complications. See Eugene R. Declercq, Carol Sakala, Maureen P. Corry, and Sandra Applebaum, “Listening to Mothers II: Report of the Second National U.S. Survey of Women’s Childbearing Experiences,” Journal of Perinatal Education 16 (Fall 2007): 9-14.\n\n43 Interview of mother by author, March 13, 2012, Chicago Mother Interview #1, Chicago, IL, transcribed from digital recording.\n\n44 Thomas P.

Hon, “Current Concepts of Fetal Monitoring,” California Medicine 119 (July 1973): 63-64.\n\n49 Physicians do not perform routine testing for particular diseases and conditions because the less likely a disease will be present, the more likely a positive test result will be a false-positive. For any given test, as the prevalence of the disease or condition decreases, the positive predictive value of the test decreases. Fredric D. Frigoletto and Allan S.

Stenchever, “The Results of a Five-Year Study of Continuous Fetal Monitoring on an Obstetric Service,” Obstetrics and Gynecology 50 (September 1977): 275-79. Other studies have noted that some women found the human contact afforded by frequent fetoscope use more valuable than electronic monitoring. Miriam Orleans, “Lessons from the Dublin Study of Electronic Fetal Monitoring,” Birth 12 (1985): 86.\n\n56 Chicago physician interview #6, October 4, 2012.\n\n57 No records track how many American hospitals have adopted central monitoring stations. Research indicates only that “many” have. See, for example, M. Withiam-Leitch, J. Shelton, and E. Fleming, “Central fetal monitoring: Effect on perinatal outcomes and cesarean section,” Birth 33 (December 2006): 284-88 and Lisa Heelan, “Fetal Monitoring: Creating a Culture of Safety with Informed Choice,” Journal of Perinatal Education 22 (Summer 2013): 156-65.\n\n58 P.J.

At a Salt Lake City hospital, for example, where 84.4 percent of patients were monitored in 1971 and 1972, cesarean section rates increased from 3.5 percent before the monitor, to six percent during the first year the hospital used the technology, to 9.5 percent during the second year.

In 1995, another ACOG bulletin noted for the first time that the “primary risk” of EFM was an increase in cesarean delivery. “Fetal Heart Rate Patterns: Monitoring, Interpretation, and Management,” ACOG Technical Bulletin: An Educational Aid to Obstetrician-Gynecologists (Number 207, July 1995). Nine years later, ACOG stated in another Practice Bulletin that “increasing reliance on continuous electronic monitoring of fetal heart rate and uterine contraction patterns led to an increase in the number of cesarean deliveries performed for presumed fetal compromise and dystocia, respectively [emphasis mine].” The organization also noted that “with few exceptions, major improvement in newborn outcomes as a result of the increased cesarean delivery rate are yet to be proved.” “Vaginal Birth After Previous Cesarean Delivery,” ACOG Practice Bulletin: Clinical Management Guidelines for Obstetrician-Gynecologists 54 (July 2004). Nevertheless, after more than 30 years of guidelines and accompanying caveats, in 2009 a record 85 percent of births in the U.S. were electronically monitored. “Intrapartum Fetal Heart Rate Monitoring: Nomenclature, Interpretation, and General Management Principles,” ACOG Practice Bulletin (Number 106, July 2009).\n\n71 Interview by author of obstetrician, Chicago physician interview #4, October 3, 2012, transcribed from digital recording.\n\n72 Anne Drapkin Lyerly, et al., “Risk and the Pregnant Body,” Hastings Center Report 39 (November-December 2009): 34-42, quote on 35.\n\n73 Marieskind, 4.\n\n74 Madeleine H.

Other anti-cesarean groups emerged later. The Cesarean Prevention Movement (later renamed the International Cesarean Awareness Network or ICAN) appeared in 1982. With the advent of the internet, The Unnecesarean.com surfaced so that an unlimited number of mothers could voice their frustration over their unwanted surgeries. The website billed itself as “pulling back the curtain on the unnecessary cesarean epidemic.” Today, The Unnecesarean continues its educational activities on Facebook.
