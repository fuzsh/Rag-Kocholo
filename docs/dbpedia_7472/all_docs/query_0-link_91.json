        "text": "The following details are given in the London Gazette of February 2nd, 1945: \"Awarded the George Cross for most conspicuous gallantry in carrying out hazardous work in a very brave manner.\" Captain Thompson was cited many times for bravery aboard Hospital Ships from the very beginning of the war, particularly with the H.M.H.S. \"Paris\" at Dunkirk and the \"St. David\" at Sicily. At Anzio aboard the rapidly sinking vessel \"St. David\" he organised parties to remove all the wounded to safety in nearby boats. Finally, when all were ordered to save themselves, Thompson returned alone, to almost certain death, to the one remaining patient who was still trapped below deck. Captain Thompson remained with this man and both perished together when the ship went down. Commonwealth War Graves Commission\n\nLetter from his wife, Marjorie, dated 11 Feb. 1951:\n\n“I have read your appeal in today’ Observer concerning your War Memorial. My husband J. R. O. Thompson R.A.M.C. was a Medical Student at King’s from - I think – 1928-31 or 32 whence he proceeded to Barts where he qualified. He was killed at Anzio in January 1944 and won a posthumous George Cross. I was at King’s from 1928-32 my maiden name being Bispham. We have two children Richard born March 1942 and Patricia born February 1944 and it is for them that I write to ask that their father’s name may be included on your Memorial list.”\n\nLetter from his mother, Jane, dated 12 Feb. 1951:\n\n“I have read in today’s Telegraph an appeal for names and information of old members of your College who have lost their lives in the war. May I ask if the name of my son is in the list of the fallen? Capt. Jenkin Robert Oswald Thompson G.C., R.A.M.C.\n\nHe was awarded posthumously the George Cross having given his life to save that of another on the Hospital Carrier, St. David at Anzio, Jan. 24th 1944. He was a student at King’s College about 1930 and onwards and later at \\St. Bartholomew’s Hospital. Trusting I am in order writing to you.”"
