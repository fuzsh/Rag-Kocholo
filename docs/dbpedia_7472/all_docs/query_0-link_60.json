        "text": "England-born Carroll, 61, was the leading light on the UK lovers' rock scene, and has lost none of her power to impress as she fuses her soulful vocals with melancholic melodies.\n\nShe quickly bought the crowd to their feet, singing along to her every note.\n\nIt's not just a skank down memory lane, it's an emotional release with lyrics that apply to anyone who had ever fallen in love, and experienced the emotional charge that comes with it.\n\nOften dubbed \"the album that triggered the baby boom\"’, Hopelessly In Love has sold more than one million copies worldwide and was recently voted The Greatest Lovers Rock Album of All Time by readers of Mojo.\n\nAward-winning singer, songwriter and composer Carroll has provided vocals for superstars such as Michael Jackson, Sade, Stevie Wonder, Annie Lennox and the Pet Shop Boys to name a few.\n\nHer remastered album is represented in its original sleeve and includes five bonus tracks. Performing Alongside Carroll was the legendary Silly Games singer Janet Kay. The song went to Number Two in 1979 making Janet the first person to perform a lovers' rock tune on Top Of The Pops.\n\nThe two stars have been working together for years and the chemistry between them is so heartfelt and sincere their warmth melts the crowd into a sea of smiling faces. Janet’s rendition of Wishing On A Star is cleverly crafted and her voice is as powerful and as clear as when she first sang Silly Games 43 years ago.\n\nThe talented pair finished the night collaborating on renditions of reggae classics like 007 (Desmond Dekker & The Aces) and No Time (Bob Marley & The Wailers), keeping us on our toes and exercising our vocal chords.\n\nA thoroughly engaging and entertaining performance.\n\nCarroll Thompson and Janet Kay return to London Boisdale on April 30.\n\nFor tickets and more tour dates see: seetickets.com.\n\nHopelessly In Love, the 40th Anniversary reissue, is out now and can be purchased on colour vinyl, CD or streamed at carrollthompson. lnk.to."
