        "text": "Janet Tyson is currently a PhD candidate in history at Birkbeck, University of London. In early 2020, she spent two weeks at Oak Spring working on her doctoral dissertation, which examines A Curious Herbal - an encyclopedia of of medicinal plants illustrated by 18th century Scottish botanical artist Elizabeth Blackwell - within the contexts of Georgian London and of similar books available at the time.\n\nOf her time at Oak Spring, Janet said, “This has been an invaluable experience. I've been exposed to an awful lot of things here instead of chasing all over the place. To be able to be a resident and to just walk over to the library everyday and look at these things, and the way it works I can just ask for something and Tony's just able to get it - other libraries you have to wait an hour. It's just very, very different.”"
