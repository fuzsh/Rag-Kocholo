Janet Q. Thompson OBITUARY

Thompson, Janet Q.

Janet Thompson died November 14, 2021 after a brief illness. Janet’s life was devoted to her family – especially her husband of 65 years, musical and visual arts, faith, travel, and cultivating friendships with people all over the world. Janet was born in January 1932 in New York and grew up in Allendale, New Jersey, the only daughter of William and Dolly Quaintance. Janet graduated from Columbia University as an RN with a degree in nursing. She practiced nursing in New York until she married Charles Thompson in June 1956. The couple moved to Denver that year, and Janet and Chuck’s daughters, Carolyn and Linsley, were born in Colorado. In 1962 the family moved to Sydney, Australia for six months, and that adventure sparked a love of travel and a talent for making friends along the way. After three years in California, the family moved to Atlanta in 1969. Janet became involved with the opera, St. Phillips Episcopal Cathedral, and her daughters’ schools. She also worked for a local art gallery owner, cultivating a knowledge of representational art. Janet and Chuck returned to Colorado in 1978. Janet was a docent at the Rotary Club’s Artists of America show. She was President of the Denver branch of the English Speaking Union for many years, and devoted herself to projects at St. John’s Episcopal Cathedral. She worked on Christian education and chaired the Arts & Architecture Commission. Janet and Chuck partnered in adding an antiphonal organ to the cathedral’s main organ. In the last 20 years, Janet reveled in her role as a grandmother. Janet is survived by her husband Chuck Thompson, daughters Carolyn (Jay) McCormick, Linsley (Duncan) Withers, grandson William McCormick and granddaughter Ruth Withers. A mass will be held, Tues, Dec 14, 2021 at 11:00 St. John’s Cathedral 13th & Washington. In lieu of flowers, the family encourages contributions to St. John’s Episcopal Cathedral.
