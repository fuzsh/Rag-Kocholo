        "text": "South Sudan has experienced protracted conflict since 2013, which is primarily the result of an ongoing power struggle between the leaders of South Sudan’s major conflicting parties, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) – led by President Salva Kiir – and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-in-opposition (SPLM-IO) – led by Riek Machar. Kiir and Machar are ideologically similar, and their rivalry lies principally in securing power for themselves and their ethnic communities. Despite signing a peace agreement (R-ARCSS), resurgence of armed conflict between Kiir and Machar, as well as from rival groups, is an acute threat. Additionally, Thomas Cirillo (National Salvation Front) has led an insurgency in the southern Equatoria region aimed at securing decentralised federal governance. The unlikelihood of peace in South Sudan constrains its development and the functions of its political institutions. Political leaders have manipulated and politicised ethnicity to aid armed conflict. For example, tension between the two biggest ethnic groups, the Dinka and Nuer, has been incited by the rivalry between Kiir (Dinka) and Machar (Nuer).\n\nThe sustained violence throughout South Sudan has caused a severe humanitarian crisis, aggravated by climate-related disasters and corruption. Thus far, over 2.3 million people have been displaced, with women and children accounting for about 83 per cent of South Sudan’s refugees. Relatedly, women and girls confront high risks of physical and sexual violence, which increased by 218 per cent from the first to the second quarter of 2022. Corruption remains a significant challenge, with over US$73 million of public funds reportedly taken by political elites between 2018 and 2021. The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) has been operating since 2011, although relations between UNMISS and the South Sudanese government have been tense. Regional actors – notably the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and the African Union – have also played a significant role in efforts to resolve the South Sudanese conflict and rebuild the society."
