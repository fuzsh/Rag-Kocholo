        "text": "After considering various names including Azania, Nile Republic and Kush Republic, the government settled on the safest choice: the Republic of South Sudan, or Ross.\n\nThe national flag is the same as that used by the rebel army, the SPLA, and consists of horizontal black, red and green stripes, separated by two thinner white bands. The thick stripes represent the black people, their blood and fertile land. White is for peace. The blue triangle at the flag's hoist symbolises the Nile, and the yellow star inside it the unity of the 10 states.\n\nWith several hundred language groups, South Sudan is one of the most linguistically diverse countries in Africa. English and Arabic were the official languages, but after independence only English will be retained as an official working language, according to the transitional constitution.\n\nA fish eagle appears on the coat of arms, while the symbol of the government is a secretary bird.\n\nChosen through a competition, the national anthem comprises four short stanzas and lasts a little more than a minute.\n\nFootball and basketball are increasingly popular sports, but the most popular traditional pastime is wrestling.\n\nThe South Sudan pound will enter circulation in the coming months.\n\nThere is no official national dish, as food varies widely throughout the states. In the east, Ethiopian-style dishes are common; in the north, fuul – cooked and mashed fava beans – is popular. Elsewhere, meals based around sorghum, beans and sometimes goat meat are common."
