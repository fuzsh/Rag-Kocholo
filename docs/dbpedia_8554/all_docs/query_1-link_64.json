        "text": "Table 1 provides key indicators on children’s work and education in South Sudan.\n\nTable 1.

(2)\n\nBased on a review of available information, Table 2 provides an overview of children's work by sector and activity.\n\nTable 2.

Despite the 2018 Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS), ethnic tensions and land disputes continue to drive violent conflict between state and non-state armed groups in the country, exposing children to the worst forms of child labor. (3,14) During the reporting period, state armed groups, including the South Sudan People's Defense Force (SSPDF); South Sudan National Police Services; and South Sudan Wildlife Services, and non-state armed groups including the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army in Opposition (SPLA-IO); South Sudan Opposition Alliance; and forces loyal to General Moses Lokujo recruited and used children as combatants, bodyguards, and porters during armed conflict. (14) Children recruited by armed groups lack access to basic services such as water and education, and they are particularly vulnerable to mistreatment, abuse, and further exploitation. (3) Armed groups have previously subjected children to rape and sexual abuse as in-kind payment to fighters. (9) Additionally, state and non-state armed groups recruit children from villages in which conflicts occur. There were also reports of armed groups recruiting children from the government-managed IDP camp in Bentiu during the reporting period. (14)\n\nOf the 10,000 children engaged in tending cattle throughout the country, many are used in armed cattle raids by other tribes. An even greater number of children fight as part of local community defense forces. (4) Children abducted by armed pastoralists may be forced to join heavily militarized cattle rustling networks. Older boys are also forced to work as soldiers, herders, or cattle rustlers. (4,9) While younger children tend to smaller livestock, teenagers serve as auxiliaries for armed pastoralists or self-defense groups. Among certain tribes, cattle raiding marks a rite of passage to adulthood. (15) In addition, non‐state groups often use children released from armed groups for cattle raiding, or intercommunal violence once the children arrive back in their villages. (4) Furthermore, economic pressures, including sustained flooding resulting in loss of land, cattle, and intercommunal conflict led to a continued increase in child marriages and child labor during the reporting period. Families with limited financial resources exchanged their young daughters for a bride price, or as restitution following intercommunal conflict. (3,4)\n\nDuring the reporting period, the South Sudan Education Cluster published the \"Education Needs Assessment in South Sudan 2021\" in coordination with Save the Children and UNICEF. The report detailed inadequacies within the country's education system, including the chronic underfunding of the sector. (3,16) Although a majority of pre-primary and primary schools have reopened after prolonged pandemic-related closures, the government does not enforce school attendance, and the majority of children leave school before age 13, rendering children vulnerable to child labor and exploitation. (3,17-19) Public school teachers are paid sporadically, leading to low morale, frequent absenteeism, and high teacher attrition. (3,4,18,20,21) In addition, armed groups, including government forces, continue to occupy schools in contested areas, and ongoing military operations in conflict-affected areas have forced teachers to flee. (9,14,20) Although the Constitution and the Child Act provide for free primary education, some schools illegally require families to contribute prohibitive school fees for teachers' and other officials' salaries as well as related costs such as utilities—a practice that the South Sudanese government is taking measures to address. (17,22,23) This practice disproportionately impacts girls, because families with multiple children, who cannot afford to pay additional fees to cover all children, prioritize educating sons. Underage marriage also prevents girls from attending school. (3,4,22)\n\nThe government has established institutional mechanisms for the enforcement of laws and regulations on child labor (Table 5). However, gaps exist within the operations of enforcement agencies that may hinder adequate enforcement of their child labor laws, including the absence of coordination between agencies, lack of defined mandates, and an overall lack of prioritization of child labor issues.\n\nTable 5. Agencies Responsible for Child Labor Law EnforcementOrganization/AgencyRole & ActivitiesMinistry of Labor, Public Service and Human Resource Development (MOL)Enforces child labor laws, identifies child labor violations, and conducts workplace inspections. (3,24,25) Refers violations of child labor laws to the South Sudan National Police Service, which then investigates the violation and determines whether to charge the violator in criminal court. During the reporting period, MOL resumed labor inspections. (3)Ministry of JusticeOversees all courts and prosecutes violations, including those related to child labor. (4) Partners with the UNICEF-funded initiative Justice for Children, which refers victims of child labor to special courts in which judges are trained on how to adjudicate cases involving minors. This initiative was active during the reporting period; however, research was unable to find information on the number of children diverted from criminal prosecutions in 2022. (3) South Sudan’s justice system faces enormous challenges, such as low capacity, insufficient funding, interference by the government and SSPDF, insufficient training for law enforcement personnel, and a scarcity of judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys. (30-32) Previous reports indicate that prosecutors and law enforcement officials are not familiar with the legal statutes regarding the worst forms of child labor, which resulted in the imprisonment of children engaged in commercial sexual exploitation. (21,30)South Sudan People's Defense Force (SSPDF) Directorate for Child ProtectionResponsible for preventing the recruitment of children into the army, monitoring barracks, identifying child soldiers and assisting with their release, investigating allegations of child soldiering, and providing training on children’s rights to child protection officers and members of SSPDF. Headed by a Brigadier General, serves as a liaison between SSPDF and the international community. (20) Research was unable to identify activities undertaken by the SSPDF Directorate for Child Protection to address child labor during the reporting period.\n\nLabor Law Enforcement\n\nIn 2022, the exceptionally low number of worksite inspections conducted at the national level in South Sudan may impede the enforcement of child labor laws (Table 6).\n\nTable 6. Labor Law Enforcement Efforts Related to Child LaborOverview of Labor Law Enforcement20212022Labor Inspectorate FundingUnknown (4)Unknown (3)Number of Labor Inspectors12 (4)14 (3)Mechanism to Assess Civil PenaltiesNo (25)No (25)Training for Labor Inspectors ProvidedYes (4)Yes (3)Number of Labor Inspections Conducted at Worksite0 (4)21 (3)Number of Child Labor Violations FoundN/A (4)0 (3)Number of Child Labor Violations for Which Penalties Were ImposedN/A (4)0 (3)Number of Child Labor Penalties Imposed that Were CollectedN/A (4)0 (3)Routine Inspections ConductedNo (4)No (3,32)Routine Inspections TargetedNo (4)No (3)Unannounced Inspections PermittedYes (25)Yes (25)Unannounced Inspections ConductedNo (4)Yes (3)Complaint Mechanism ExistsNo (4)No (3)Reciprocal Referral Mechanism Exists Between Labor Authorities and Social ServicesYes (4)Yes (3)\n\nDuring the reporting period, the Ministry of Finance and Planning did not provide any regular funding to MOL for labor inspections. MOL is authorized to retain 20 percent of the fees it collects for work permits, and 20 percent of the fines it collects for labor law violations; MOL divides this revenue between the five directorates within the ministry to pay for basic necessities such as utilities and some salaries. (3) No labor law violations were discovered during the reporting period, leaving the ministry without sufficient funding. (3,4) All inspections during the reporting period took place in the capital as there was no budget for inspectors to travel elsewhere in South Sudan. Most inspections were conducted in the hospitality sector, specifically hotels, where children are not known to work. (3) MOL lacks sufficient resources, including vehicles, to investigate child labor complaints, particularly in the informal sector. (3,21,33) Research also indicates that South Sudan does not have an adequate number of labor inspectors to carry out their mandated duties. (3,34,35) In addition, there is a high level of absenteeism among ministry staff, and salaries for civil servants in nearly every ministry were not paid for several months, further hindering the labor inspectorate's ability to enforce child labor laws. (20,21)\n\nIn 2022, labor inspectors were trained on the application of existing child labor and hazardous child labor laws. (3) While labor inspectors in South Sudan are not authorized to assess penalties, they can issue compliance notices requiring the violating business to remedy the violation; however, regulations do not specify monetary penalties for infractions. Labor inspectors can also refer cases to the police and any violations to the Labor Act, including child labor violations, can carry criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to 5 years. (3,4,25)\n\nCriminal Law Enforcement\n\nIn 2022, criminal law enforcement agencies in South Sudan took actions to address child labor (Table 7). However, gaps exist within the operations of criminal enforcement agencies that may hinder adequate criminal law enforcement, including a lack of financial resources.\n\nTable 7. Criminal Law Enforcement Efforts Related to Child LaborOverview of Criminal Law Enforcement20212022Training for Criminal Investigators ProvidedNo (4)No (3)Number of Investigations0 (4)0 (3)Number of Prosecutions Initiated0 (4)0 (3)Number of Convictions0 (4)0 (3)Imposed Penalties for Violations Related to the Worst Forms of Child LaborNo (4)No (3)Reciprocal Referral Mechanism Exists Between Criminal Authorities and Social ServicesNo (3)No (3)\n\nAlthough the August 2013 Punitive Order commits the SSPDF to hold its military officers accountable for the recruitment or use of children, and the government continued to release child soldiers during the reporting period, the government has neither investigated nor prosecuted officers who allegedly committed such crimes, despite ongoing evidence of officer involvement in and knowledge of child recruitment. (3,5,30,36,37) Research indicates that the budget allocated to agencies responsible for criminal law enforcement is insufficient, resulting in investigators lacking sufficient transportation and logistic necessities to carry out investigations related to the worst forms of child labor.
