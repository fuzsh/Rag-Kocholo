Sudan was officially the largest country in Africa and the Arab World.\n\n\"We no longer have borders with three countries, Uganda, Kenya and Congo, and the length of our borders with Ethiopia and the Central African Republic have decreased,\" al-Sadiq added.\n\nAmong the significant statistical changes in Sudan, explained in a booklet published by Sudan's Ministry of Information, occurs in the population, with a decrease of roughly 8 million (the population of South Sudan) to 33.4 million and an increase in the percentage of Muslims to 96.7%.\n\n\"Sudan's new map has been delivered to all the embassies, consulates, airports and governmental institutions and will be placed up on the morning of July 9 after the declaration of the state of South Sudan,\" said Sanaa al-Awad, of the Ministry of Information.\n\n\"We are, sadly, at the end of the old entity of Sudan and now face a new beginning,\" she explained.\n\n\"We hope the people and government of South Sudan peace and success, for peace and success in the south means peace and success in the north,\" she added."
