        "text": "South Sudan gained its independence from Sudan on 9 July 2011, becoming the world’s youngest nation. This followed decades of struggle by Southern Sudanese and other oppressed people of Sudan against successive regimes in Khartoum.\n\nFrom 1955, a cornucopia of southern Sudan-based armed groups, spearheaded by the Anya Nya Movement of Joseph Lagu, fought a guerrilla wars against various Sudanese governments.\n\nThe conflict ended in 1972 when Lagu’s Movement signed the Addis Ababa Agreement with the government of President Ja’afar Mohammed Numeiri. The Agreement gave southerners limited autonomy within a united Sudan.\n\nHowever, not all Anya Nya fighters supported the Agreement. Those opposed to the deal remained in the bush and continued to battle the government in Khartoum and advocate for full independence of southern Sudan from the rest of Sudan.\n\nBut most Anya Nya fighters returned home, including those officers and non-commissioned officers who were quietly unhappy with the Agreement, but found no immediate outlet to express their displeasure. This group included a certain Captain John Garang De Mabior.\n\nBy 1983, and much to the dismay of southerners, President Numeiri had almost completed unravelling the Addis Ababa Agreement of 1972. In fact, he even proceeded further to fragment the southern region and impose Islamic law in the country, setting the stage for renewed conflict with the southerners.\n\nThis time around, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), under the leadership of Col. John Garang De Mabior, led the revolution, which now also included disgruntled Sudanese from the Nuba Mountains and the Blue Nile.\n\nThe war started out in southern Sudan and soon it engulfed the entire country. The toll on the civilian population was heavy, prompting calls for a negotiated settlement.\n\nThe Nigerians tried to mediate, but their efforts hit a snag, largely due to the intransigence of the then National Islamic Front government of President Omar Hassan el Bashir. Later, former US President Jimmy Carter also got involved.\n\nHowever, the most serious effort to end the conflict through negotiations came from the leadership of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development or IGAD countries led by former Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi.\n\nThe talks, held in different Kenyan cities and towns over several years, culminated in the signing in 2005 of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in the Kenyan capital Nairobi.\n\nThe deal brought an end to the conflict, Africa’s longest-running civil war, which had cost an estimated two million lives and uprooted millions more from their homes.\n\nIt also enshrined the right of southerners to determine their own destiny in a referendum to be held after a six-year interim period (9 January 2011).\n\nIn the internationally-monitored referendum, more than 98 percent of southern Sudanese voted to secede from the North and establish their own country. And on 9 July 2011, some six months after the plebiscite, southern Sudan was declared an independent state.\n\nConsequently, it joined the community of nations as the 193rd member of the United Nations and the 54th member of the African Union.\n\nSouth Sudan, a land-locked country with an area of 644,329 sq. km, is located in eastern central Africa.\n\nThe country is bordered by six other African countries: Sudan in the north, Ethiopia in the east, Kenya in the southeast, Uganda in the south, the Democratic Republic of Congo in the Southwest and the Central African Republic in the west.\n\nUnfortunately, like many other countries in the world, South Sudan remains vulnerable to climate change. For South Sudan, this has only exacerbated humanitarian conditions for millions of people.\n\nIt continues to struggle with an array of environmental issues such as water pollution, wildlife conservation, loss of vegetation covers and biodiversity, flooding and periodic droughts.\n\nThe main tributary of the River Nile, the White Nile, passes through South Sudan, forming an expansive swamp commonly referred to as the Sudd region. The Sudd, located in Jonglei State, is the world’s largest swamp.\n\nSouth Sudan’s highest point is Mt. Kinyeti in Eastern Equatoria State at 10,456 ft. or 3,187 m above sea level and its lowest point is the White Nile at 381 m.\n\nThe country receives a reasonable amount of rainfall, mostly between May and November. May used to be the wettest month of the year, with July considered to be the coolest, when temperatures drop to around 20° C.\n\nWith temperatures hovering in the neighborhood of 40° C, the month of March remains one of the hottest months of the year."
