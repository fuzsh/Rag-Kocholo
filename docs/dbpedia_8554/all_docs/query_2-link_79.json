Sexual violence, including conflict-related sexual violence, against women and girls has been widespread, with few examples of perpetrators being brought to justice in military or civilian courts. The humanitarian situation in South Sudan remains dire, with the United Nations declaring that food insecurity is the worst it has been since South Sudan’s independence. Following escalating tensions and clashes, between government forces and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army in Opposition (SPLM/A-IO), President Salva Kiir and First Vice President and SPLS/A-IO leader Riek Machar, agreed in April to accelerate the integration of their forces as provided under the 2018 revitalized peace deal.",

        "text": "When South Sudan became an independent nation in 2011 it established the National Security Service to gather and analyze intelligence and advise other state authorities.\n\nHowever, today the security service operates far beyond this mandate. It has routinely used violence, intimidation, arrests, and torture to target suspected opponents of the government.\n\nAnonymous Man 1\n\nThey opened the car and they pulled me inside. Some were actually tying my hands at my back, some were tying my feet. I was actually in the car for almost 48 hours. That's what happened to me, and I can say they are members of [the] security apparatus.\n\nCarine Kaneza Nantulya\n\nHUMAN RIGHTS WATCH\n\nOur research identified three main detention sites used by the security service in Juba – Blue House, Riverside and Hai Jalaba, although none is authorized by law for detention purposes.\n\nThe National Security Service have even used residential houses for detentions. Detainees are sometimes held for months or years centers without charge or trial or access to their families and lawyers.\n\nThose who’ve been detained in these facilities include suspected rebels, students, human rights defenders, journalists, activists, political dissidents, and aid workers.\n\nAnonymous Man 1\n\nPeople who are active, reporting things that are affecting the community, are the ones targeted.\n\nAnonymous Man 2\n\nThey said, you are criticizing the president, you are criticizing the entire system of the country.\n\nCarine Kaneza Nantulya\n\nHUMAN RIGHTS WATCH\n\nPeople we interviewed told us of beatings, being hung upside down from a rope, shocked with electricity, pierced with needles, burned with melted plastic, and even raped. Most were released without ever being interrogated, charged, or presented in court.\n\nAnonymous Man 2\n\nIt's completely [outside] the law. The interrogation, and the way how they interrogate people during the investigation. // Individual detainees are always tortured. // The suffering inside the detention facility was very, very serious. You don’t have food. We don’t have water. We don’t have medication, treatment. Many detainees they used to die inside.\n\nCarine Kaneza Nantulya\n\nHUMAN RIGHTS WATCH\n\nSouth Sudan cannot develop into a country that respects human rights and the rule of law with a security service that operates without accountability and egregiously abuses its citizens. To this end, the NSS must be changed.\n\nTEXT\n\nSouth Sudan’s new unity government should reform the National Security Service Law to restrict their mandate to intelligence gathering.\n\nSouth Sudan’s regional and international partners should support NSS reform and insist on credible and independent investigations into their abuses."
