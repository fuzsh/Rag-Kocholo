        "text": "Safety and security\n\nPolitical situation\n\nThe security environment has generally improved since the signing of the peace agreement in 2018 and the formation of a transitional government in 2020. Localized tensions remain following a two-year extension of the transitional period, with elections announced for late 2024.\n\nSecurity situation\n\nMany security checkpoints have been set up throughout the country, making road travel difficult. Vehicles are regularly stopped and searched and violence has occurred during such encounters. Restrict your movements.\n\nViolent clashes traditionally increase during the dry season, from December to April.\n\nWith the deteriorating economic conditions, urban crime rates are rising significantly. Tensions are high and the potential for spontaneous unrest is significant.\n\nInter-tribal clashes occur without warning throughout the country, and there is frequent fighting between the army and armed militia groups.\n\nRegions bordering Sudan are particularly insecure due to periodic tension between Sudan and South Sudan.\n\nThe situation in Juba is relatively calm but remains unpredictable.\n\nJonglei state\n\nThe situation is extremely volatile in Jonglei state, more specifically in Bor and Pibor due to inter-communal fighting.\n\nAnti-government forces control of much of the countryside, while the government retains control within Bor and the Greater Pibor Administrative Area.\n\nNorthern states\n\nConflict between breakaway armed opposition forces continues in Unity and Upper Nile states. The government currently controls Malakal, but anti-government forces are in control of much of Upper Nile state, west of the Nile River. The government holds most of Unity, including Bentiu.\n\nOccasional tensions between South Sudan and Sudan have led to increased military activity in regions bordering Sudan, and both states have threatened to escalate their activities.\n\nFighting in the border areas of Blue Nile state and South Kordofan, Sudan, has displaced tens of thousands of people over the border since South Sudan’s secession in 2011. The ongoing conflict in Sudan is likely to increase the number of displaced persons.\n\nBe aware of security threats in the oil development region, especially in and around Paloich, Upper Nile state. Oil installations and the surrounding areas are potential targets for military and rebel attacks.\n\nThe Abyei region, which borders South Sudan’s Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap and Unity states and Sudan, is a disputed territory between the two countries. The Abyei region is the site of frequent fighting and mass displacement.\n\nInter-tribal conflict and cattle rustling are becoming prevalent in Lakes state. Tensions are particularly high in Rumbek East County.\n\nIf you remain in the area:\n\nrestrict your movement\n\navoid the road connecting Rumbek and Yirol\n\nSouthern states\n\nThere is increased militia activity in Central Equatoria and some parts of Western Equatoria states, particularly in Mundri.\n\nTravel on the three main roads has become extremely dangerous as armed attacks on these roads are frequent between:\n\nJuba–Nimule\n\nJuba–Kajo Keji\n\nJuba–Yei\n\nThe border area between South Sudan and Kenya remains volatile due to clashes between heavily armed youths on both sides of the borders.\n\nThere is an increase of attacks by non-state armed groups near the border crossing with Uganda at Nimule, Eastern Equatoria. South Sudanese authorities will close the border crossing for short periods when incidents occur.\n\nCrime\n\nPetty crime\n\nPetty crime, such as pickpocketing and handbag snatching, occurs regularly and mainly in Juba.\n\nDuring your stay in South Sudan:\n\nensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and your other travel documents are secure at all times\n\navoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery\n\navoid carrying large sums of cash or valuables\n\nViolent crime\n\nThere is widespread violent crime throughout South Sudan. Incidents include:\n\nkidnappings\n\narmed robbery\n\ncarjackings\n\ncompound invasions\n\nThe current economic crisis has led to a significant increase in the number of crimes involving guns. The economic crisis will likely deepen in the short to medium term.\n\nThere are frequent armed invasions of the compounds housing international non-governmental organizations.\n\nIncidences are especially high in Juba, which has seen regular outbreaks of violence and lawlessness and increasing numbers of carjackings.\n\nCrime usually rises in the run-up to Christmas, New Year and Easter seasons. Foreigners have been victims of many crimes, including rape and robbery.\n\nLaw enforcement personnel have limited capacity to deter crime.\n\nKidnappings\n\nSeveral kidnappings have occurred primarily in the oil producing areas of Unity and Upper Nile states.\n\nKidnappers mainly target workers in the oil and aid sectors working in remote and contested areas.\n\nIf you plan to go to these areas despite the risk:\n\nexercise caution at all times\n\nuse varied and unpredictable routes and itineraries\n\nRestrictions on movement\n\nRoadblocks are common and are frequently erected after dark.\n\nIncreasingly frequent fuel shortages may impede your ability to move freely at short notice and could lead to unexpected shortages of basic foodstuffs.\n\nHave your identity and vehicle documents readily available\n\nFollow the instructions of local authorities\n\nTake adequate precautions\n\nDemonstrations\n\nDemonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.\n\nAvoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place\n\nFollow the instructions of local authorities\n\nMonitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations\n\nMass gatherings (large-scale events)\n\nCommunications\n\nTelecommunications are unreliable.\n\nThere are no fixed telephone lines. Mobile devices don't have full functionality.\n\nThere is no international postal service.\n\nRoad safety\n\nLandmines pose a threat, especially outside of Juba.\n\nRoad conditions are extremely poor. Many roads are unpaved and poorly maintained. A four-wheel-drive vehicle is required, except in some urban areas such as Juba and Malakal, especially during the rainy season from March to November.\n\nYou should only undertake desert travel if you are experienced and fully equipped. Basic equipment should include:\n\na shovel\n\nmetal ramps for heavy sand\n\na GPS device\n\nspare fuel\n\nwater and food supplies\n\nUnpredictable local driving habits, pedestrians and roaming animals pose risks.\n\nPublic transportation\n\nA few taxis are available in urban centres but are generally old and uncomfortable.\n\nPublic transportation is limited outside of major urban areas.\n\nMost other buses are irregularly scheduled, poorly maintained and very badly driven. Fatal accidents involving buses are routine and increasing.\n\nOnly use top-of-the-line buses.\n\nAir travel\n\nWe do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.\n\nInformation about foreign domestic airlines\n\nHealth\n\nRelevant Travel Health Notices\n\nGlobal Measles Notice - 13 March, 2024\n\nCOVID-19 and International Travel - 13 March, 2024\n\nPolio: Advice for travellers - 3 July, 2024\n\nThis section contains information on possible health risks and restrictions regularly found or ongoing in the destination. Follow this advice to lower your risk of becoming ill while travelling. Not all risks are listed below.\n\nConsult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic preferably 6 weeks before you travel to get personalized health advice and recommendations.\n\nRoutine vaccines\n\nBe sure that your routine vaccinations, as per your province or territory, are up-to-date before travelling, regardless of your destination.\n\nSome of these vaccinations include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, varicella (chickenpox), influenza and others.\n\nPre-travel vaccines and medications\n\nYou may be at risk for preventable diseases while travelling in this destination. Talk to a travel health professional about which medications or vaccines may be right for you, based on your destination and itinerary.\n\nHepatitis A\n\nThere is a risk of hepatitis A in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.\n\nPractise safe food and water precautions and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present.\n\nYellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements\n\nYellow fever is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito.\n\nTravellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection.\n\nRisk\n\nThere is a risk of yellow fever in this country.\n\nCountry Entry Requirement*\n\nProof of yellow fever vaccination for travellers from all countries.\n\nRecommendation\n\nVaccination is recommended.\n\nContact a designated Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre well in advance of their trip to arrange for vaccination.\n\nDiscuss travel plans, activities, and destinations with a health care professional.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites.\n\nAbout Yellow Fever\n\nYellow Fever Vaccination Centres in Canada\n\n* It is important to note that country entry requirements may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest diplomatic or consular office of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements.\n\nMeasles\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nAnyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally.\n\nRegardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles.\n\nMeningococcal disease\n\nThis destination is in the African Meningitis Belt, an area which has the highest rates of meningococcal disease in the world. Meningococcal disease is a serious and sometimes fatal infection.\n\nTravellers who are at higher risk should discuss vaccination with a health care provider. High-risk travellers include those living or working with the local population (e.g., health care workers) or those travelling to crowded areas or taking part in large gatherings.\n\nHepatitis B\n\nHepatitis B is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus. Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.\n\nHepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. Prevent hepatitis B infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nIt is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally.\n\nBefore travelling, verify your destination’s COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19.\n\nInfluenza\n\nThe best way to protect yourself from seasonal influenza (flu) is to get vaccinated every year. Get the flu shot at least 2 weeks before travelling.\n\nThe flu occurs worldwide.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs from November to April.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs between April and October.\n\nIn the tropics, there is flu activity year round.\n\nThe flu vaccine available in one hemisphere may only offer partial protection against the flu in the other hemisphere.\n\nThe flu virus spreads from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Clean your hands often and wear a mask if you have a fever or respiratory symptoms.\n\nPolio\n\nPolio (poliomyelitis) is an infectious disease that can be prevented by vaccination. It is caused by poliovirus type 1, 2 or 3. Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus 2 (cVDPV2) is present in this country.\n\nPolio is spread from person to person and through contaminated food and water. Infection with the polio virus can cause paralysis and death in individuals of any age who are not immune.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nBe sure that your polio vaccinations are up to date before travelling. Polio is part of the routine vaccine schedule for children in Canada.\n\nOne booster dose of the polio vaccine is recommended as an adult.\n\nMalaria\n\nMalaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease that is caused by parasites spread through the bites of mosquitoes.\n\nThere is a risk of malaria in certain areas and/or during a certain time of year in this destination.\n\nAntimalarial medication may be recommended depending on your itinerary and the time of year you are travelling. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic before travelling to discuss your options. It is recommended to do this 6 weeks before travel, however, it is still a good idea any time before leaving.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times:\n\n• Cover your skin and use an approved insect repellent on uncovered skin.\n\n• Exclude mosquitoes from your living area with screening and/or closed, well-sealed doors and windows.\n\n• Use insecticide-treated bed nets if mosquitoes cannot be excluded from your living area.\n\n• Wear permethrin-treated clothing.\n\nIf you develop symptoms similar to malaria when you are travelling or up to a year after you return home, see a health care professional immediately. Tell them where you have been travelling or living.\n\nSafe food and water precautions\n\nMany illnesses can be caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated by bacteria, parasites, toxins, or viruses, or by swimming or bathing in contaminated water.\n\nLearn more about food and water precautions to take to avoid getting sick by visiting our eat and drink safely abroad page. Remember: Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it!\n\nAvoid getting water into your eyes, mouth or nose when swimming or participating in activities in freshwater (streams, canals, lakes), particularly after flooding or heavy rain. Water may look clean but could still be polluted or contaminated.\n\nAvoid inhaling or swallowing water while bathing, showering, or swimming in pools or hot tubs.\n\nCholera\n\nRisk\n\nCholera is a risk in parts of this country. Most travellers are at very low risk.\n\nTo protect against cholera, all travellers should practise safe food and water precautions.\n\nTravellers at higher risk of getting cholera include those:\n\nvisiting, working or living in areas with limited access to safe food, water and proper sanitation\n\nvisiting areas where outbreaks are occurring\n\nVaccination may be recommended for high-risk travellers, and should be discussed with a health care professional.\n\nTravellers' diarrhea\n\nTravellers' diarrhea is the most common illness affecting travellers. It is spread from eating or drinking contaminated food or water.\n\nRisk of developing travellers' diarrhea increases when travelling in regions with poor standards of hygiene and sanitation. Practise safe food and water precautions.\n\nThe most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling.\n\nTyphoid\n\nTyphoid is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Risk is higher among children, travellers going to rural areas, travellers visiting friends and relatives or those travelling for a long period of time.\n\nTravellers visiting regions with a risk of typhoid, especially those exposed to places with poor sanitation, should speak to a health care professional about vaccination.\n\nSchistosomiasis\n\nThere is a risk of schistosomiasis in this destination. Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by tiny worms (blood flukes) which can be found in freshwater (lakes, rivers, ponds, and wetlands). The worms can break the skin, and their eggs can cause stomach pain, diarrhea, flu-like symptoms, or urinary problems. Schistosomiasis mostly affects underdeveloped and rural communities, particularly agricultural and fishing communities.\n\nMost travellers are at low risk. Travellers should avoid contact with untreated freshwater such as lakes, rivers, and ponds (e.g., swimming, bathing, wading, ingesting). There is no vaccine or medication available to prevent infection.\n\nInsect bite prevention\n\nMany diseases are spread by the bites of infected insects such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas or flies. When travelling to areas where infected insects may be present:\n\nUse insect repellent (bug spray) on exposed skin\n\nCover up with light-coloured, loose clothes made of tightly woven materials such as nylon or polyester\n\nMinimize exposure to insects\n\nUse mosquito netting when sleeping outdoors or in buildings that are not fully enclosed\n\nTo learn more about how you can reduce your risk of infection and disease caused by bites, both at home and abroad, visit our insect bite prevention page.\n\nFind out what types of insects are present where you’re travelling, when they’re most active, and the symptoms of the diseases they spread.\n\nAfrican trypanosomiasis\n\nAfrican trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) is caused by a parasite spread through the bite of a tsetse fly. Tsetse flies usually bite during the day and the bites are usually painful. If untreated, the disease is eventually fatal. Risk is generally low for most travellers. Protect yourself from bites especially in game parks and rural areas. Avoid wearing bright or dark-coloured clothing as these colours attract tsetse flies. There is no vaccine available for this disease.\n\nChikungunya\n\nThere is a risk of chikungunya in this country. The level of risk may vary by:\n\nseason\n\nyear\n\nregion\n\nelevation\n\nThe virus that causes chikungunya is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can cause fever and pain in the joints. In some cases, the joint pain can be severe and last for months or years.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times.\n\nLearn more:\n\nInsect bite and pest prevention\n\nChikungunya\n\nDengue\n\nIn this country, risk of dengue is sporadic. It is a viral disease spread to humans by mosquito bites.\n\nDengue can cause flu-like symptoms. In some cases, it can lead to severe dengue, which can be fatal.\n\nThe level of risk of dengue changes seasonally, and varies from year to year. The level of risk also varies between regions in a country and can depend on the elevation in the region.\n\nMosquitoes carrying dengue typically bite during the daytime, particularly around sunrise and sunset.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites. There is no vaccine or medication that protects against dengue fever.\n\nRift Valley fever\n\nRift Valley fever is a viral disease that can cause severe flu-like symptoms. In some cases, it can be fatal. It is spread to humans through contact with infected animal blood or tissues, from the bite of an infected mosquito, or eating or drinking unpasteurized dairy. Risk is generally low for most travellers. Protect yourself from insect bites and avoid animals, particularly livestock, and unpasteurized dairy. There is no vaccine available for Rift Valley fever.\n\nVisceral Leishmaniasis\n\nVisceral leishmaniasis (or kala azar) affects the bone marrow and internal organs. It is caused by a parasite spread through the bite of a female sandfly. It can also be transmitted by blood transfusion or sharing contaminated needles. If left untreated it can cause death. Risk is generally low for most travellers. Protect yourself from sandfly bites, which typically occur after sunset in rural and forested areas and in some urban centres. There is no vaccine or medication to protect against leishmaniasis.\n\nOnchoceriasis\n\nOnchocerciasis (river blindness) is an eye and skin disease caused by a parasite spread through the bite of an infected female blackfly. Onchocerciasis often leads to blindness if left untreated. Risk is generally low for most travellers. Protect yourself from blackfly bites, which are most common close to fast-flowing rivers and streams. There is no vaccine available for onchocerciasis although drug treatments exist.\n\nAnimal precautions\n\nSome infections, such as rabies and influenza, can be shared between humans and animals. Certain types of activities may increase your chance of contact with animals, such as travelling in rural or forested areas, camping, hiking, and visiting wet markets (places where live animals are slaughtered and sold) or caves.\n\nTravellers are cautioned to avoid contact with animals, including dogs, livestock (pigs, cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats, and to avoid eating undercooked wild game.\n\nClosely supervise children, as they are more likely to come in contact with animals.\n\nMpox\n\nMpox (monkeypox) is a risk in this country. It is a viral disease that can cause serious illness in some circumstances. Risk is generally low for most travellers.\n\nMpox spreads in 3 ways:\n\nfrom animals to humans through direct contact or by eating or preparing undercooked meat of infected animals or coming into contact with an infected animal's body fluids\n\nfrom person to person through close contact, including direct contact with the skin lesions, blood, body fluids, or mucosal surfaces (such as eyes, mouth, throat, genitalia, anus, or rectum) of an infected person\n\nthrough direct contact with contaminated objects such as bedding and towels, or by sharing personal objects used by an infected person\n\nFollow recommended public health measures and avoid contact with animals such as rodents and primates to help prevent getting or spreading the infection.\n\nPerson-to-person infections\n\nStay home if you’re sick and practise proper cough and sneeze etiquette, which includes coughing or sneezing into a tissue or the bend of your arm, not your hand. Reduce your risk of colds, the flu and other illnesses by:\n\nwashing your hands often\n\navoiding or limiting the amount of time spent in closed spaces, crowded places, or at large-scale events (concerts, sporting events, rallies)\n\navoiding close physical contact with people who may be showing symptoms of illness\n\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and mpox are spread through blood and bodily fluids; use condoms, practise safe sex, and limit your number of sexual partners. Check with your local public health authority pre-travel to determine your eligibility for mpox vaccine.\n\nTuberculosis\n\nTuberculosis is an infection caused by bacteria and usually affects the lungs.\n\nFor most travellers the risk of tuberculosis is low.\n\nTravellers who may be at high risk while travelling in regions with risk of tuberculosis should discuss pre- and post-travel options with a health care professional.\n\nHigh-risk travellers include those visiting or working in prisons, refugee camps, homeless shelters, or hospitals, or travellers visiting friends and relatives.\n\nHIV\n\nHIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks and impairs the immune system, resulting in a chronic, progressive illness known as AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome).\n\nHigh risk activities include anything which puts you in contact with blood or body fluids, such as unprotected sex and exposure to unsterilized needles for medications or other substances (for example, steroids and drugs), tattooing, body-piercing or acupuncture.\n\nEbola disease\n\nSporadic outbreaks of Ebola disease occur in this country.\n\nEbola disease can be caused by 6 different viruses, including Sudan virus and Ebola virus, which spread through contact with infected bodily fluids (from people or animals). It is very serious and often fatal.\n\nPractise good hygiene (frequent and proper hand washing) and avoid contact with the body fluids of people with Ebola disease or unknown illnesses. Avoid contact with wild animals.\n\nOf the different viruses that cause Ebola disease, there is only a vaccine to prevent disease caused by Ebola virus. It is available under certain circumstances; however, it is not authorized for sale in Canada. There are currently no approved vaccines or effective treatments for Ebola disease caused by the other viruses, including Sudan virus.\n\nMedical services and facilities\n\nMedical facilities are inadequate and supplies of medicine are limited.\n\nYou will likely need medical evacuation if you fall seriously ill or are injured. Air ambulances are usually not available on short notice and the airport is closed after dark.\n\nMake sure you get travel insurance for South Sudan that includes coverage for:\n\nmedical evacuation\n\nrepatriation\n\nhospital stays\n\nMake sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.\n\nHealth and safety outside Canada\n\nMedication\n\nSome prescription medications may not be available in South Sudan.\n\nIf you take prescription medications, you’re responsible for determining if they’re legal in the country.\n\nBring sufficient quantities of your medication with you\n\nAlways keep your medication in the original container\n\nPack them in your carry-on luggage\n\nCarry a copy of your prescriptions\n\nKeep in Mind...\n\nThe decision to travel is the sole responsibility of the traveller. The traveller is also responsible for his or her own personal safety.\n\nBe prepared. Do not expect medical services to be the same as in Canada. Pack a travel health kit, especially if you will be travelling away from major city centres.\n\nLaws and culture\n\nYou must abide by local laws.\n\nLearn about what you should do and how we can help if you are arrested or detained abroad.\n\nDrugs\n\nPenalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences or heavy fines.\n\nDrugs, alcohol and travel\n\nDeath penalty\n\nThe death penalty applies to serious crimes such as murder, drug trafficking and treason.\n\nPhotography\n\nA permit for photography, including on a mobile phone, is required. Permits can be obtained at the Ministry of Information.\n\nEven with a photography permit, it is prohibited to photograph:\n\nmilitary installations\n\nmilitary and police personnel\n\ngovernment buildings and infrastructure, including roads, bridges, dams and airfields\n\npublic utilities including gas stations\n\n2SLGBTQI+ persons\n\nSouth Sudanese law prohibits sexual acts between individuals of the same sex. Public displays of affection between members of the opposite sex are frowned upon.\n\n2SLGBTQI+ persons have experienced harassment and verbal abuse.\n\nTravel and your sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics\n\nDual citizenship\n\nDual citizenship is legally recognized in South Sudan.\n\nIf you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of South Sudan, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different entry/exit requirements.\n\nDual citizens\n\nInternational Child Abduction\n\nThe Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and South Sudan.\n\nIf your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in South Sudan by an abducting parent:\n\nact as quickly as you can\n\nconsult a lawyer in Canada and in South Sudan to explore all the legal options for the return of your child\n\nreport the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre\n\nIf your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies.\n\nBe aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.\n\nUseful links\n\nInternational Child Abductions: A guide for affected parents\n\nChildren and travel\n\nCanadian embassies and consulates by destination\n\nRequest emergency assistance\n\nDriving\n\nYou should carry an International Driving Permit.\n\nInternational Driving Permit\n\nDress and behaviour\n\nSouth Sudan is a traditional, conservative society. Women should dress conservatively and should avoid:\n\nmini skirts\n\nbare arms\n\nlow necklines\n\nMoney\n\nThe currency is the South Sudan pound (SSP). The Sudanese pound (SDG) is not recognized as legal tender.\n\nTransferring U.S. or Canadian dollars to the country is difficult.
