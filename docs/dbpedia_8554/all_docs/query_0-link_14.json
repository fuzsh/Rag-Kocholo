        "text": "When to File\n\nIf you currently have TPS under South Sudan’s designation and would like to keep your TPS, you must re-register during the 60-day re-registration period that runs from Sep. 6, 2023 through Nov. 6, 2023. We encourage you to re-register as soon as possible within the 60-day registration period.\n\nIf you are filing an initial application for TPS under South Sudan’s redesignation, effective Nov. 4, 2023, you must register during the registration period that runs from Sep. 6, 2023, through May 3, 2025. We encourage you to register as soon as possible within the 18-month registration period.\n\nGo to the TPS page for information about registering and re-registering.\n\nWhere to File\n\nIf you are applying for TPS South Sudan, you may file Form I-821, Application for Temporary Protected Status, online. When filing an initial TPS application or re-registering for TPS, you can also request an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) by submitting a completed Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, online with your Form I-821 (or you can file your Form I-765 request separately later).\n\nFile Online\n\nIf you are filing a paper initial TPS application or re-registering for TPS, or if you are filing for a replacement EAD for TPS you were already granted, send your TPS package to the appropriate address in the table below.\n\nIf you send your paper application via:Then, mail your application to…U.S. Postal Service USPS:USCIS\n\nAttn: TPS South Sudan\n\nP.O. Box 6943\n\nChicago, IL 60680-6943FedEx, UPS, and DHL deliveries:USCIS\n\nAttn: TPS South Sudan (Box 6943)\n\n131 S. Dearborn 3rd Floor\n\nChicago, IL 60603-5517\n\nAutomatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension\n\nUSCIS has automatically extended through Nov. 3, 2024, the validity of EADs with a marked expiration date of Nov. 3, 2023, issued under the TPS designation of South Sudan. If your EAD is covered through this automatic extension, you may continue to use your existing EAD through Nov. 3, 2024, as evidence you are authorized to work.\n\nTo prove that you are authorized to work in the United States, you may show the following documentation to your employer. Government agencies may also accept these documents if they need to determine your immigration status:\n\nYour TPS-related EAD with a Nov. 3, 2023, expiration date; and\n\nA copy of the Federal Register notice announcing the automatic extension.\n\nYour employer may rely on the Federal Register notice as evidence of the continuing validity of your EAD. Go to the Documentation Employers May Accept and Temporary Protected Status Beneficiaries May Present as Evidence of Employment Eligibility page for more information.\n\nIf we approve your TPS re-registration application and you paid the fee for a new EAD (or if we approved your fee waiver request), we will issue you a new EAD with the expiration date of May, 3, 2025.\n\nFor more information on TPS eligibility requirements, what to file, and step-by-step instructions on submitting an initial TPS application package, go to the TPS page. You can find the filing fees for TPS related forms on our Fee Schedule page.\n\nOther Immigration Options\n\nYou might be eligible for other immigration options listed on the Explore My Options page.\n\nTo apply for lawful permanent resident status (Green Card), you must be eligible under one of the categories listed on the Green Card Eligibility Categories page. Once you find the category that may fit your situation, click on the link provided to get information on eligibility requirements, how to apply and whether your family members can also apply with you.\n\nNote on Seeking Asylum: Being granted and maintaining TPS until a reasonable period before the filing of the asylum application is considered an extraordinary circumstance for the purposes of the one-year filing deadline. In other words, having TPS status “stops the clock” on the requirement to file for asylum within one year of arriving in the United States, if the one-year clock has not already expired. See 8 CFR 208.4(a)(5)(iv).\n\nAvoid Scams\n\nPlease be aware that some unauthorized practitioners may try to take advantage of you by claiming they can file TPS forms. These same individuals may ask that you pay them to file such forms. We want to ensure that all potential TPS applicants know how to obtain legitimate, accurate legal advice and assistance. A list of accredited representatives and free or low-cost legal providers is available on the USCIS website on the finding legal advice web page.\n\nWe don’t want you to become a victim of an immigration scam. If you need legal advice on immigration matters, make sure the person helping you is authorized to give legal advice. Only an attorney or an accredited representative working for a Department of Justice (DOJ) recognized organization can give you legal advice. Visit the Avoid Scams page for information and resources."
