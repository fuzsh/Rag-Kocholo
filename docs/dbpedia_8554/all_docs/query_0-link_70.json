        "text": "In June and July of this year, I was excited to announce the plans for opening a new girls' boarding school in South Sudan, which to my knowledge, is only the third one in the country. South Sudan remains unstable and the wealthy who care about their girls' education send their girls to Uganda or Kenya to study. The poor are left with what they have, which is not much. Combined with a myriad of other constraints, the issue of girl's education in South Sudan, once I saw it, could not be forgotten. It remains an issue close to my heart, even though I may not work in the education space at the moment. Unlike girls in Afghanistan or girls kidnapped by ISIS, whose geopolitical importance surmounts those of South Sudanese girls, I think it's important to share what I can about what I have learned over the past year and half about the new nation's forgotten women and girls.\n\nThe Situation\n\nSouth Sudanese women are some of the most under-educated women in the world. Civil war and conflict have exacerbated this problem by destroying infrastructure and reinforcing traditional gender roles. But educating children, especially women, can help limit and reduce these issues. Better education can provide students with the skills they need to avoid joining militias and to identify other career options. In addition, addressing the education issue can increase women’s awareness about their reproductive rights and proper healthcare practices.\n\nThere is a legal basis for the right to education. Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights acknowledges education as an essential human right and yet, there are many cases where this right is taken away. However, when it comes to women’s education there is little guarantee that their right to education is protected. This issue is especially prevalent in South Sudan with girls under the age of 18.\n\nIn South Sudan and more generally in sub-Saharan Africa, while primary education is an attainable goal for all children, the gender disparity becomes evident in secondary education. In 47 out of 50 African countries, girls have less than a 50% chance of receiving secondary education. There is a social stigma: as girls are at an age associated with childbearing, marriage, and work. With the lack of support to stay in school, girls are pressured to drop out and fulfill their more traditional roles.\n\nIn my immersion trip to South Sudan in 2017 I overheard heard men use the term \"she is old\" as a derogatory statement about a woman's level of attractiveness. The problem is that old happens at around age 15 and 16. Girls \"dropped out\" during school breaks. Girls also disappeared because they were \"eloped\" by boys who could not afford the thirty to fifty required cows for her wedding dowry.\n\nParents are also faced with a dilemma, especially when in poverty, as there are many “hidden costs” associated with schooling, and a girl’s future may be put on hold in order to provide for the rest of the family.\n\nWhen speaking with the headmaster of our school, he was often interrupted by phone calls from his former students. Of the girl students, they were often in precarious waiting situations, where if they could not find the fees for school, they would be pressured by their parents to wed. Headmaster often visited fathers and sat down to explain to them how in the long run, educated girls earned more money, and there was a dividend to their education. For as many times as I heard a story that Headmaster succeeded in his father interventions, there might be two or three of girls whose parents suffered from the drought or the story of a rich man visiting with cows, the parents not unable to refuse a gesture. Girls' dropping out was not something to make noise about, one just accepted the fact, and like many women in the world, the girls too came to accept their fates. Speaking about birth control and AIDS is taboo, and as a foreign woman, who would believe it anyway. Behavior change happens subtly and carefully, and where there is little work being done, it's people like Headmaster who are doing the work, at his own risk.\n\nIn South Sudan, basic education is free and compulsory, following the General Education Act of 2012. However, this does not mean that enrollment rates remain consistent. In 2015, the gross enrollment ratio in secondary schooling for boys was 12.35%, whereas for girls it was only 6.63%. This disparity can be attributed to a number of causes, including poor infrastructure, high levels of poverty, and a deeply embedded stigma against girls’ education.\n\nInfrastructural Constraints\n\nBefore it became a country in 2011, South Sudan (formerly southern Sudan) suffered under decades of civil war that had not only torn apart the country, but had also destroyed all pre-existing infrastructure. Between 1983 and 2005 over two and a half million people were killed in the conflict and nearly six and a half million more were displaced as a result of it. In the years after the war South Sudan has had to build the infrastructure for agriculture, governmental programs and education from the ground up. And despite their newfound independence South Sudan still faces inter-ethnic clashes, conflicts with Greater Sudan and widespread poverty.\n\nPoverty as a Constraint\n\nAlthough basic education is available to all, there are additional costs that may restrict many families. In South Sudan, education is free until around grade 8, depending on the school. This correlates with the lower enrollment rates prevalent in primary versus secondary education, with 53.08% and 6.63% for females respectively. There are several hidden costs, including uniforms, books, transportation, and stationary, and even then there are not enough resources. Students surveyed in South Sudan cited a lack of books, chalk, and computers to be the most lacking in schools. These financial burdens contribute to the inability to send children to secondary school, particularly girls, as families prioritize boys’ education.\n\nSocial Stigma\n\nAt the age of secondary schooling, girls are expected to assume roles as mothers, brides, or caretakers. The gender disparity in secondary schooling can be attributed to these societal expectations. Girls are also held back during their menstrual cycles, often being forced to take “sick days” due to the shame and discomfort surrounding the process. In addition, early pregnancy cuts education short for many, and the lack of childcare options makes it almost impossible to return to school. Pregnancy is both a cause and consequence of child marriage, resulting in the fact that 52% of girls in South Sudan are married before their eighteenth birthday. However, only 63% of girls who married before their eighteenth birthday would prefer to continue their education with university while only 2% would like to get married. There is a gap between what is accepted as tradition with girls' desires.\n\nTeachers\n\nIn South Sudan 88% of secondary school teachers are male while only 12% are female. This underrepresentation has a negative impact on girls, as evidence shows the positive correlation between female teachers and the enrollment and retention of female students.\n\nHowever, among teachers themselves, views about girls education are improving. In 2017, 72.5% of teachers disagree or strongly disagree that boys are better suited for school. These changing numbers show a possibility for creating a more inclusive and welcoming environment for girls. That over a quarter of them still agree, however, means there is much to be done in terms of teachers' attitudes towards girls' ability when compared to boys.\n\nImpact\n\nIncreased opportunities for girls’ education will positively impact not only female lives, but also the lives of entire communities. When girls are educated, they can earn more, and generally 90% of those earnings go into reinvestment in families.* This “ripple effect” further leads to improved educational attainment rates for future generations, can help provide money and improve a woman's access to health resources and information. With the investment in one girl’s education, an entire community benefits.\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\nThis section will outline several techniques and barriers outlined by the “What Works for Girls’ Education” report with emphasis on the emerging practice of cognitively guided instruction to point towards the future of education development. Each section below draws from research mentioned in the \"What Works: A Catalog of Evidence on Addressing Girls’ Education Needs\" chapter of the Brooking Institute's publication titled \"What Works in Girls' Education: Evidence for the World's Best Investment.\"\n\nInterventions for Affordability\n\nMaking schools affordable lowers the barriers for girls to gain access to education — one of the main reasons families in rural areas are unwilling to send their girls to school is a lack of funds to send all the children to school. Instead money is spent to send boys to school and young girls are married off in exchange for goods. If schooling is universal, however, families would be more willing to send their girls to school.\n\nIn place of these practices it may also be deemed appropriate to create various scholarships and stipends (conditional cash transfers) for poor families that require financial aid. That is, there is an opportunity cost of a girl's labor in the home, from fetching water, cooking, childcare to economic activities such as farming and trading. However these measures alone are not enough, in addition to the direct cost of schooling families must also pay the hidden costs of education. These includes paying for transportation, forgoing the money a girl could earn from her labor, and taking time to ensure safe transportation of the children to school.\n\nCase studies for pro-girl's education policies that have worked are Tanzania where enrollment of girls in school doubled in 2002 after the abolishment of school fees, Uganda where enrollment jumped 70% and Malawi where enrollment jumped 63%. Kenya and a number of Asian countries that have seen a similar increase in enrollment after putting in place measures that cut out the plain sight and hidden costs of educating a girl.\n\nAlternatives to completely eliminating school fees include offering scholarships and other stipends that may alleviate the opportunity costs for girls and their families. Case studies for these kinds of practices include Bangladesh’s Female Stipend Program and the Mexican Progresa scholarship program. Key points to make note of include that it may be more effective to transfer the money to the girl’s mother instead of father (there is no significant difference if the girl receives the money directly), criteria for selection must be completely clear so as to not create tension between recipients and non recipients, conditional cash transfer seem to be more effective than unconditional cash transfers in sustaining a decline in early marriage and fertility, and the cost of transferring the fees should be absorbed by the organization providing them so as to not discourage students from applying.\n\nInterventions Addressing Health Barriers\n\nPoor health also serves as a more physical barrier preventing children from going to school — parasites and malnutrition being two of the biggest problems for children in developing areas. Case studies have shown that providing food and deworming programs have not only boosted school attendance but also increased test scores and school performance in children. In Kenya the introduction of inexpensive deworming drugs in schools not only increased attendance at targeted schools but also in schools nearby; when fewer children were infected, there were fewer children to transmit the disease. The practice cost roughly $3.50 per child per year. In addition in Pakistan, introducing a community delivered lunch program increased attendance by 40% over a period of 2 years, as well as reducing the amount of malnutrition among attendees. Similar practices in Kenya contributed to not only a boost in school attendance, but also a 0.4 standard deviation rise in test scores (compared to schools where food was not provided).\n\nAnother barrier to girls’ education is the lack of proper sanitary facilities. When proper toilet areas are not provided by the school, girls will miss school during menstruation. Studies suggest that access to clean facilities containing both a toilet and an area for hand washing reduces the number of transmitted diseases. Additionally, providing girls with sanitary pads increases their self confidence in school activities. For example, in northern India the construction of separate sex toilets reduced dropout rates of both girls and boys. In South Africa, separate sex toilets resulted in a reduced number of sexual assaults on female students.\n\nInterventions for Accessibility of Schools\n\nFor any student, a lack of local schools serves as a barrier to education, but for girls that cost is especially high. Many girls are escorted to school by their parents, in the fear that something may occur to them on their way to school, but the farther the schools are the more time it takes out of the parents’ days and the less willing they are to accommodate them. Case studies in South Asia and Africa, where female school attendance is traditionally low, show that a community based approach to education boosts girls’ enrollment in the schools. In many cases reducing the distance between the school and the girl’s home improved not only enrollment but also test scores. However there is a gap that needs to be addressed in secondary school education.\n\nWhile many countries have invested in increasing the number of primary schools in more convenient locations, the same efforts have not been made towards secondary schooling. Case studies include Indonesia, where the construction of more conveniently located schools increased attendance to near capacity, and Egypt where the construction on new schools also boosted girls’ enrollment by about 60%.\n\nOther programs that have worked to similar effect include Colombia’s Escuela Nueva “New School” program and Pratham’s community remedial education program. Lastly, it is worth considering implementing flexible school schedules in order to accommodate students who work. Reduced lesson time results in less time for students to spend studying, but is the most feasible option for providing working children an option for schooling. Case studies for this type of program include the Bangladesh BRAC program’s implementation of flexible “satellite” schools and the Pakistani government’s implementation of “double sessions” with boys attending first and then girls in the next session later that day.\n\nGender Aware Initiatives\n\nA natural first measure to making schools more girl-friendly is to prevent gender-based violence completely in the school environment. This includes sexual, physical, and psychological violence against girls. In order to prevent gender-based violence, schools can implement safety policies and code of conducts for teachers, including eliminating corporal punishment and providing teachers with other forms of discipline. When teachers are made aware of gender-based violence, they become more likely to hold perpetrators accountable.\n\nAn important step to preventing gender-based violence is to provide programs that include initiatives like gender sensitivity training. Such programs should work to transform gender norms and promote communication between genders.\n\nLastly, providing safe places like girl’s clubs and, in boarding schools, the employment of female mentors who live with the girls or \"dorm mothers\" is essential to improving women’s education in South Sudan. These spaces provide a safe haven for self-expression and improve social and psychological outcomes for girls, ultimately leading to a healthier environment. In Ghana a girls club lead by female mentors resulted in positive changes in girls’ attitudes toward violence and gender and empowered them against gender based violence.\n\nInterventions for School Quality\n\nIn order to achieve sustainable gains in girls’ education, a high quality learning experience for girls is just as important as improving access to an education. Recruiting good teachers is a critical step in improving the quality of education for both girls and boys. By providing quality teachers with support, one can help ensure that students receive the basic foundational skills in school. In the United States, evidence has been found that having a quality teacher is equivalent to an average gain of one year of learning.\n\nBesides looking for quality teachers and trying to persuade them to teach at schools with large benefits, a school can improve how teachers teach. Researchers have found that good teaching practices such as providing feedback, creating a safe environment, and drawing on student’s backgrounds and experiences, have made teaching more effective and improved learning environments. Training teachers also includes teaching them to consider gender-sensitive approaches in order to combat gender stereotypes. This ultimately results in an environment where girls can participate in classes equally with boys and encourage girls to explore fields they would not usually enter, such as STEM (science, technology, engineering and math).\n\nCommunity Outreach\n\nImproving women’s education in South Sudan requires community involvement with school management. Successful communities have explicit agreements to provide equal education to both girls and boys and strive for greater community involvement. For example, in Indonesia, an experiment found that community engagement in schools improved the quality of education for all students. Additionally, the research shows that improving relations between school committees and the communities they are based in can encourage the involvement of the most elite community members, who, in this study, helped enforce study hours and secure general gains for schools. As a result, students of this community saw an average test score improvement between 0.17 and 0.22 standard deviation. Women's participation was critical to the effectiveness of community participation as mothers demonstrated a stronger commitment to their children’s education.\n\nEmergencies and Safety Zones\n\nEducation must be accessible even in a time of crisis. When people know nothing but war, hunger and displacement, how do they move beyond the mentality of war and scarcity? There must be hope and a sense of normal to children's lives, which comes through going to school regularly. Although it may be difficult to provide traditional education with a physical school and certified teachers, some form of schooling should be provided. Access to education is an important way to address children’s physical and psychological health during difficult times. Children are deeply affected by wars and disasters; however, if even given basic support, they can remain resilient and stay well in the long run. Often emergency intervention is disproportionately directed toward adults. Therefore, it is important to focus on children’s needs in a time a crisis because creating a safe environment where regular activities help maintain their well-being help contribute to making the transition to more normal lives easier.\n\n*Plan WARO (2012), ‘BIAAG 2012 research: Uganda Country Report’"
