For this reason, the national emergency declared on April 3, 2014, must continue in effect beyond April 3, 2024. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13664.\n\nThis notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.\n\nJOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\nMarch 26, 2024."
