Your donation is in US dollars.\n\nWhen South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in July 2011, many hoped that sovereignty would bring peace, but the world’s newest state descended into civil war in December 2013 – resulting in the internal displacement of one million people, with an additional 367,000 seeking refuge in neighboring countries. A humanitarian crisis around access to food and safety threatens many. We began working in South Sudan in June 2014, using radio programs, outreach activities, and support to local organizations to promote peace and end violence."
