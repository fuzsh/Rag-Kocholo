        "text": "Sudanese Independence and Civil War\n\nIn 1953 Sudan was granted self-government. Ismaʿil al-Azhari was elected the first prime minister. The southern Sudanese received few positions in the new administration. Fears of northern domination led to widespread discontent in the south. On August 18, 1955, a number of southern army troops mutinied. Their rebellion was quickly put down, but some of the mutinous troops were able to escape. They began to coordinate an armed resistance, which became the basis of southern Sudan’s prolonged armed struggle against the north.\n\nIn 1956 Sudan became an independent country. It was initially a democracy, but in 1958 a bloodless coup instituted military rule under General Ibrahim ʿAbbud. His government introduced many measures to facilitate the spread of Islam and the Arabic language, all in the name of national unity. Important positions in the administration and police were staffed by northern Sudanese.\n\nThese actions led the southern rebels to increase their resistance to the government. In 1963 a rebellion erupted in southeastern Sudan, led by the Anya Nya, a southern Sudanese guerrilla organization. The government responded with increased repression, but it was not able to put down the rebellion. Finally, peace talks led to the signing of the Addis Ababa Agreement of 1972, which ended the war. The agreement gave the south its own legislature and executive body to govern the region.\n\nMeanwhile, after a brief return to democracy, another military government, led by Colonel Gaafar Mohamed el-Nimeiri, had come into power in 1969. Muslim fundamentalism had also grown considerably stronger in the north over the years. Nimeiri took an increasingly dictatorial approach to governing. He repeatedly dissolved southern Sudan’s regional legislature as well as the national parliament and imprisoned many who opposed his rule.\n\nIn the south there was widespread discontent with the Nimeiri regime. In 1983 civil war broke out again with even greater ferocity than before. Later that year Nimeiri elicited further ire when he modified Sudan’s legal codes to bring them into accord with Islamic law, the Shariʿah.\n\nNimeiri sought to crush the southern rebels by military force. His deployment of the Sudanese army only succeeded in disrupting the distribution of food. When coupled with drought and diminished harvests, this disruption created widespread famine in southern Sudan.\n\nNimeiri was overthrown in 1985. In yet another military coup, Lieutenant General Omar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir seized power in 1989. He and his colleagues continued to Islamize the country. They also ruthlessly imprisoned hundreds of political opponents and vigorously continued the war in the south. However, the southern rebels gained control of many southern towns. Unable to defeat them in battle, the government armed and unleashed an Arab militia against their traditional African rivals in the south, principally the Dinka. It also consistently ignored pleas for food and obstructed the efforts of Western humanitarian relief agencies. Countless south Sudanese fled to northern towns and cities or sought sanctuary in Ethiopia.\n\nIn 1993 the country transitioned to civilian rule, but Bashir was appointed president. He was elected to the presidency in 1996 and was reelected in 2000 and 2010.\n\nMeanwhile, the civil war continued to rage. After numerous failed cease-fires, agreements, and peace discussions, the war was finally ended when the rebels and the government signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) on January 9, 2005. By then, more than 2 million people had been killed and some 4–5.5 million people had been displaced since the fighting had resumed in 1983.\n\nTransition to Southern Independence\n\nThe CPA provided for a new national constitution and outlined new measures for sharing power, distributing wealth, and providing security in Sudan. It also allowed for a separate administration for southern Sudan and stipulated that a referendum on independence for that region would be held in six years. Equally significant was the ruling that Shariʿah law would apply only to Muslims, even in the north. The disputed Abyei border region was to be jointly administered by the north and the south until its final status could be determined in a referendum.\n\nThe southern rebel leader John Garang became president of the semiautonomous government in southern Sudan, but he died a few weeks later. He was succeeded by another rebel leader, Salva Kiir Mayardit. Thousands of refugees who had fled from southern Sudan during the war returned to their homes, especially in the run-up to the referendum on southern independence.\n\nAfter years of planning, southern Sudanese citizens began voting in the weeklong referendum on January 9, 2011. Nearly 99 percent of voters opted in favor of seceding from the north. Southern independence was scheduled for six months later.\n\nPreparations for the south’s secession did not go smoothly. Several key matters remained unresolved, such as the sharing of the country’s oil wealth, the distribution of its collective debt, and the establishment of the final border demarcation. In April a draft was released of the new transitional constitution for southern Sudan for when it became independent. It drew criticism from several southern Sudanese opposition parties for extending the term of the current southern Sudan president. It also angered the national government for laying claim to the disputed Abyei region as part of the new southern country.\n\nThe referendum on who would control the small oil-rich region of Abyei had been postponed indefinitely, and its status remained unsettled. In May, Bashir had the army invade the region’s primary town, also named Abyei. The following month an agreement was reached that provided for a new, temporary north-south administration of the Abyei region, with Ethiopian peacekeeping troops agreeing to form an interim security force for Abyei.\n\nDespite these problems and the ongoing challenges facing the south in building its infrastructure, developing its economy, and raising the standard of living of its people, it declared its independence as scheduled. On July 9, 2011, South Sudan became a new country, a republic with a two-house legislature. Salva Kiir Mayardit, who had been president of the southern Sudan semiautonomous region, became the country’s first president, the head of state and government.\n\nIn the years following independence, ethnic violence escalated in the new country. The government had to deal with rebel activity from several groups, which was closely related to ethnic divides. The country descended into civil war in December 2013, after gunfire erupted in Juba between troops loyal to President Kiir and those loyal to his former vice president, Riek Machar. Kiir accused Machar of attempting a coup. Although Machar denied the coup allegation, he soon emerged leading a force of rebel soldiers and called for Kiir to step down. Tensions were ignited between Kiir’s ethnic group, the Dinka, and Machar’s ethnic group, the Nuer, and violence quickly spread to the civilian population. Fighting intensified, and both sides were accused of having committed human rights abuses.\n\nBy the end of 2014 the fighting had left at least 10,000 people dead. Some estimates were considerably higher than that. In addition, more than 1.9 million people in South Sudan had been displaced by the violence. Several cease-fire agreements were signed, but they were quickly broken. Under growing pressure from the international community, Kiir and Machar signed another peace deal in August 2015. The agreement provided for a transitional unity government that was meant to end the conflict. But, as with previous agreements, both sides violated some of the terms, and fighting continued. The transitional unity government was eventually formed in April 2016. As part of the peace deal, Machar was sworn in as first vice president. By July, however, the new government had collapsed as fighting resumed in the capital. In May 2017 Kiir announced a unilateral cease-fire in an attempt to restart peace negotiations. Under a power-sharing agreement reached in August 2018, the transitional unity government was to be reinstituted by May 2019. The date for the formation of the unity government was later extended by six months."
