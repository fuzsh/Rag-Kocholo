        "text": "Just two years after gaining independence in 2011, South Sudan descended into a devastating civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, forced millions from their homes and plunged parts of the country into famine.\n\nOn Saturday, the country’s warring sides formed a transitional coalition government in what is seen as a significant step to create peace in a country ravaged by conflict.\n\nHere is a look at key events in South Sudan since independence.\n\n2011: World’s newest country\n\nOn July 9, 2011, South Sudan formally declares independence from Sudan following six years of autonomy and 20 years of war.\n\nThe proclamation of independence comes after a referendum that saw a nearly 99 percent vote in favour of secession.\n\nSalva Kiir is sworn in as president, with Riek Machar as his deputy. The two men are rivals but also leaders in the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) that led the push to secede from Sudan, which is now South Sudan’s northern neighbour.\n\nThe new country takes over three-quarters of the oil reserves in Sudan which retains control of all pipeline and export facilities.\n\nOther thorny issues are the tracing of their common border and the status of disputed regions such as Abyei.\n\n2012: Oil clashes\n\nThe two countries clash for nearly two months starting March 2012 over rights to the oilfields around Heglig, a town just inside Sudan.\n\nSouth Sudanese troops briefly occupy the area, which accounts for half of Sudan’s crude oil production.\n\nArguments erupt over pipeline transit costs and Sudan confiscates millions of barrels of South Sudan crude.\n\nSouth Sudan halts its production in January for more than a year accusing Khartoum of theft.\n\n2013: Civil war\n\nOn July 23, 2013, Kiir fires Machar as well as all government ministers, their deputies and several police brigadiers.\n\nOn December 6, Machar accuses Kiir of “dictatorial” behaviour.\n\nAfter a night of fighting in the capital, Juba, Kiir says on December 16 his forces had thwarted an attempted coup by Machar, who denies the claim.\n\nRival army units clash in Juba and the fighting spreads beyond the capital, fuelled by rivalries between Kiir’s majority Dinka ethnic group and Machar’s Nuer, the country’s second-largest ethnic group.\n\nThe country descends into civil war marked by ethnic massacres, widespread rape, the recruitment of child soldiers and other atrocities.\n\n2016: Machar back, briefly\n\nMachar and Kiir sign a peace accord in August 2015 that provides for Machar’s reappointment as vice president.\n\nHe returns to Juba and is sworn in on April 26, 2016.\n\nBut fighting between supporters of both leaders breaks out again in July. Machar goes into exile, accusing Kiir of trying to have him killed. He is replaced as vice president.\n\n2018: Unity delays\n\nOn June 20, 2018, Kiir and Machar meet for the first time in two years.\n\nOn September 12, they sign a new peace agreement to end five years of war that killed more than 380,000 and forced roughly four million people from their homes.\n\nIt paves the way for a power-sharing government to be installed on May 12, with Machar again as the vice president.\n\nDays before the deadline, they agree to a delay until November 12 because of outstanding differences.\n\nOn November 7, they extend the deadline by another 100 days.\n\nSticking points include the carving out of state boundaries, creation of a unified national army and protection for Machar.\n\n2020: Coalition government\n\nOn February 22, Machar is finally sworn in as the first vice president after he and Kiir agree to move forward with a power-sharing government.\n\nThe two men have said outstanding issues will be negotiated under the new government.\n\nTens of thousands of rival forces still must be knitted together into a single army, a process that the United Nations and others have described as being behind schedule and poorly provisioned.\n\nThe current peace is extremely fragile, a UN report that was released on Thursday warned.\n\nHigh-level corruption is rampant, militias are being armed and civilians deliberately starved, the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan said in its report. More than half of the 12-million strong population face food shortages, it added."
