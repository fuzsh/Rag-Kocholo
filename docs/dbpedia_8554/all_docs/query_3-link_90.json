At the end of 2022, two million South Sudanese were internally displaced, and around 2.3 million were refugees in neighbouring countries of Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan and Uganda. Tens of thousands have moved to western countries through refugee resettlement programmes or on their own initiative. While some refugees have gone back to South Sudan voluntarily, they often find themselves in situations of internal displacement upon their return, and the majority continue to live as refugees in countries of asylum, often for many years or even decades.\n\nSouth Sudan is ethnically and culturally very diverse, with more than sixty cultural and linguistic groups including Dinka, Nuer, Azande, Shilluk and Bari. Each of those are composed of various clans and sub-clans sometimes speaking dialects that are quite distinct from each other. The various ethno-linguistic groups also have important similarities: they are strongly collectivistic with hierarchical family structures and patriarchal leadership and have strict gender roles. The concept of the self in South Sudanese context can be described as a “communal self”: individuals perceive themselves in the first place as an intrinsic part of their extended family and community. This “relational nature” of personhood includes an understanding of the agency of supernatural actors such as ancestors and spirits. Religious beliefs often constitute the bedrock of refugees’ beliefs about their situations, their futures, and their ability to make meaning out of the events that have occurred in their lives. Understanding events as “God’s will” and believing that one’s life has a purpose helps people cope by giving order to the disruption and chaos of their lives.\n\nThe ongoing violence in South Sudan has had major effects on the psychological well-being of the South Sudanese people. Refugees and other forcibly displaced South Sudanese have had to cope with losses, family disruptions and disconnection from their community support systems. Many South Sudanese women and girls have experienced gender-based violence. Restrictive marital practices and gender norms are major drivers of intimate partner violence.\n\nIn displacement settings, such as camps for internally displaced persons in South Sudan, refugee settlements in neighbouring countries and among refugees resettled to high-income countries, the traditional role of adult men as the uncontested head of the household and the breadwinner often drastically changes, fuelling marital conflicts and tensions between fathers and children. Negative states of mind not only affect the individual, but also influence interpersonal systems such as family and community. The armed conflict and related atrocities have negatively affected people’s views of other ethnic groups and undermined communal trust.\n\nThe prevalence of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder among South Sudanese is high. At particular risk are those who have experience severe or recent traumatic events. Women, older people and those who experience high daily stress have more higher risk.\n\nKnowledge of local expressions and concepts of well- being and illness is essential to understanding the mental health and psychosocial well-being of South Sudanese people.\n\nProfessional concepts of psychiatric and neurological disorders as described in “Western” classification systems are often not aligned to the way “non-Western” populations experience and define their mental and psychosocial well-being. It is important, therefore, to understand how South Sudanese people express emotional and social suffering (“idioms of distress”), how they conceptualize and describe mental health conditions (“cultural concepts of mental illness”) and how they explain the causes (“explanatory models”).\n\nSouth Sudanese who suffer from severe mental disorders are commonly referred to in derogatory terms equivalent to ”crazy”, ”mad”, or ”separated from their head”. The local descriptions of such conditions focus on behavioural disturbances and delusional thinking.\n\nAs causes of “madness,” people identify a range of potential factors including witchcraft, punishment by ancestors, physical sickness and bad experiences in life. Usually, people seek medical attention for mental health issues only if symptoms are severe---often involving risky or challenging behaviour—and treatment by a traditional healer has not been sufficiently effective. However, health facilities often have little to offer, and people with severe mental health issues may end up wandering in the streets. Even where mental health services are available, people may avoid them out of fear of marginalization by their community once a diagnosis has been given.\n\nSouth Sudanese languages have a range of expressions of distress, with central characteristics involving trouble sleeping, being sad, withdrawing oneself and not being able to concentrate. These concepts of emotional distress have some overlap with common mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders, but the ideas of what causes such a condition and what should be done about it can be very different from Western psychiatric explanations. South Sudanese languages have expressions to indicate that a person is overwhelmed by sadness, such as the Azande expression bakere gberarago (“overwhelming sadness”) or the Bari tongo i kwenyit kode i toyili which indicates a “heavy heart” and having a lot of thoughts on the mind. The Nuer term jiä̱ klɔac/kuɔ̱ k kɛ rɔ literally translates as “heart feeling bad” and is used to describe sadness but can also indicate disappointment or anger. The expression “overthinking” is used in many languages such as Dinka (tak tak aretic), Bari (yeyesi jore), and Shilluk (charomo). Many South Sudanese people see a strong relationship between thinking and feeling and locate both states in the mind. Emotional distress is often expressed by South Sudanese through physical complaints.\n\nSuicidal feelings run high among some populations in South Sudan. Among South Sudanese refugees in the neighbouring countries, suicidality is also reported to be a significant issue. Alcohol is commonly consumed in South Sudan, mainly by men who use it to pass the time and for whom drinking has an important social role. Epilepsy is known in all communities in South Sudan, and the various languages have their own terms to describe convulsions.\n\nMany people in South Sudan do not consider mental health concerns to be medical issues for which one would seek help in a health facility. However, many people will visit a health facility when they have physical symptoms related to conditions of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress. Even so, in health facilities, such mental health conditions are often not identified because most medical staff are not trained in mental health care, including recognizing somatic symptoms of psychological distress.\n\nTraditional healing is of great importance among the different South Sudanese ethnic groups, which use specific names and categories for various types of healers. Some use mainly herbal medicine and other natural products. Others diagnose and heal through supernatural means; for example, by being possessed by spirits or by using magical means to decipher messages of spirits. The Nuer and Dinka use the term tiët to indicate a healer with spiritual powers who has a gift of “seeing”.\n\nChurches in South Sudan and in South Sudanese refugee communities have an enormous social and spiritual influence and help people making sense of the suffering and the pain and offer hope. People who suffer from psychological issues related to the violence they suffered, or who are troubled by visions or haunted by bad dreams, many find emotional support in churches. In church communities, feelings of trust and solidarity can be restored or created, and new forms of bonding give their members support and solidarity in a society affected by war. Praying in church for the mentally ill is a community management intervention to help mentally disturbed persons.\n\nThe formal mental health system in Sudan is rudimentary, and mental health and psychosocial support services are mostly provided by non- governmental organizations. In the settlements and camps for South Sudanese refugees in the neighbouring countries, a multi-layered system for mental health and psychosocial support has been set up, with services such as community-based psychosocial support through refugee volunteers, brief culturally-adapted psychological therapies and the provision of basic psychiatric services within primary healthcare facilities. However, the quality and quantity of these services is not sufficient to meet all needs. Relatively recent is the inclusion of mental health in peacebuilding efforts. Armed conflict undermines mental health, which affects the ability of individuals, communities and societies to function peacefully during conflict and post-conflict periods.\n\nThis primer intends to provide a starting point for all involved in humanitarian assistance, in fields such as MHPSS but also public health, protection (including those focussing on child protection and gender-based violence), education, community development and peacebuilding, providing them with background information to help them better engage with South Sudanese populations, whether those displaced within South Sudan or those who have become refugees. The first chapters (1-5) provide essential information about the history and the sociocultural context of South Sudan and its population, including South Sudanese refugees. Chapter 6-8 explore how South Sudanese experience psychosocial distress and mental health conditions, with specific chapters on adults, children and survivors of gender-based violence. Chapters 9-12 zoom in on cultural concepts of mental illness, including how South Sudanese populations explain mental health conditions and where they seek help, while also briefly presenting what is known on epidemiology of mental health conditions in South Sudan. Chapters 13 and 14 provide an overview of MHPSS services in South Sudan and in South Sudanese refugee settings. The final chapter (15) discusses how MHPSS is interrelated with peacebuilding for South Sudanese populations. The annexes contain glossaries for key terms around mental health and psychosocial well-being in some South Sudanese languages such as Dinka, Nuer, Bari, Azande and Shilluk.\n\nTo assist South Sudanese clients, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) professionals and others involved in the humanitarian response need to actively acquire a sufficient understanding of ethnic, religious and cultural systems, and be able to recognise common explanatory models for mental health conditions, afflictions and emotional distress. Engaging with local illness concepts and idioms of distress will allow better communication, and can be used as therapeutic levers in interventions designed to strengthen individual and collective resilience. Clinical interventions need be accompanied by efforts to strengthen community- based protection mechanisms, in order to maintain and improve the mental health and psychosocial well-being of South Sudanese people."
