        "text": "This essay explores how Azande people of South Sudan give names. Often, Zande people have Zande and Christian names, but how do they come about these names? Who gives them? Does this always happen in the same way, or do people get their names in different ways? I will write here what I know, but please also feel free to share your own experiences in the comment section!\n\nThe Zande do not have name-giving ceremonies like some other people do. Names are typically given right after birth either by the parents of the child or the paternal or maternal relatives. Sometimes close friends are asked to give names to the child. Sometimes names are given later, but never later than a week or two. During the period where a baby does not have its own name yet, a baby boy is called baadi or ‘booyi’ (after the English ‘boy’), and a baby girl is called naadi.\n\nMy own name is Isaac Waanzi Hillary. When I was small, I would imitate a man (Baka by tribe) and when people at home saw that I was good at imitating him, they started to call me Waanzi. But like the Zande say, rimo wia naa go nga te (a name that is given jokingly, does not go away). And so I remain with Waanzi until this day. The Christian names – Hillary, John and Dominic – are given at baptism in church, based on my knowledge as a child who was brought up in Catholic beliefs.\n\nThere are three reasons why people give certain Zande names to their children.\n\nFirst, some names are carried in the family lineage, and given to newborns. These names may be of family members who had a good reputation. By giving babies their names, we honour those family members, and we ensure that they are remembered in the future. Initially, we would only name babies after people have already passed on. There was a belief that if you give the name of a person who is still alive to a baby, either the baby or the original name owner might die. So only one person can have such a name at any particular time. But that belief is becoming weak these days. My close friend, for instance, honored his mother by giving her name to his daughter, and both are still alive.\n\nSecond, sometimes Zande names are based on the circumstances that surrounded the baby’s birth. Sometimes couples have fertility issues, and it takes a woman long to conceive. Then the child that she will produce will have a name like Mingerevuru (I almost looked for nothing). There are other names which denote difficulties during pregnancy or child birth, like Mbikoyesu (Because of Jesus) and Mboriundo (God’s help). If a woman gives birth to twins, Zande typically name them Bii and Siro. During conflict situations, the naming system similarly changes to carry sentiments of war or even the end of the world. Examples include Atovura (Run of war), Gbidigi (the world has ended), Ngbapai (Through difficulties), Naworobundu (She came through the sound of guns), and Anibati (We have survived).\n\nSometimes children’s names also reflect that their father had undesirable qualities such as laziness, domestic violence. In such cases, names such as Mbiko (Because of) are given to some babies, denoting that “Because” of my child (ren) that is why I am enduring this bad qualities\n\nThird, in my experience whenever I am asked to give Zande names,( this practice of requesting a family member (s) to name a child is becoming common these days, and in most situations, several family members are asked to give name, and at the end, the biological parents will choose one of the best name for their child) to give to the children of my nieces, elder brothers and relatives, sometimes the church influence with some Zande names. While preparing the child for baptism (typically the role of a child’s mother), the Catechist will ask for the Zande name of the baby. Sometimes, if the meaning of the name seems to be heavy (like a parable name) the Catechist may ask the parents to change the name to something lighter. For instance, when I once suggested the name Miongo (I have kept silent), I was asked by the Catechist to change it. I have seen many Azande changing heavy names to easy ones, because of church influence. Mostly, they then opt for qualities such as Nyamuse (Love), Zereda (Peace) or Hipai (Mercy).\n\nIn sum, there is a long and rich history of name-giving among the Azande of South Sudan. Some of these customs and beliefs are changing, some are remaining the same. I would be curious to hear from you what your names are, how you got them, and how you feel about our changing name-giving cultures!"
