        "text": "South Sudan became the world’s youngest nation after gaining independence from Sudan on 09/July/2011 through a nation-wide plebiscite that was carried out earlier in January.\n\nThe right of the people of southern Sudan to determine their own destiny in an internationally-monitored referendum was enshrined in the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA).\n\nThe CPA, signed in the Kenyan capital Nairobi on 09/Jan/2005, ended decades of armed conflict between the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) and successive regimes in Khartoum.\n\nIn the vote, an overwhelming majority of southern Sudanese opted for separation from northern Sudan. Consequently, South Sudan became the 193rd member of the United Nations and the 54th member of the African Union.\n\nThis land-locked country is located in the north-eastern part of the African continent and it is bordered by eight countries; Sudan in the north, Uganda in the South, Ethiopia to the east and Kenya towards the southeast.\n\nSouth Sudan is also bordered on the west by the Central African Republic and on the southwest by the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nSome 64 ethnic groups – mostly Nilotic and Bantu – inhabit this vast expanse of land that boasts equatorial and tropical climates across its plains and mountain ranges.\n\nThe main tributary of the River Nile, the White Nile, passes through South Sudan, forming an expansive swamp commonly referred to as the Sudd region. The Sudd, located in Jonglei State, is the world’s largest swamp.\n\nSouth Sudan’s highest point is Mt. Kinyeti at 10,456 ft. above sea level and it can be found in Eastern Equatoria State.\n\nThe country receives a reasonable amount of rainfall, mostly between May and November. Until recently, and owing to the impacts of climate change, the month of May used to be the wettest month of the year, with July considered to be the coolest, when temperatures drop to around 20° C.\n\nWith temperatures easily in the neighborhood of 40° C, the month of March appears to be the hottest month."
