Firefly (Groucho Marx) is named dictator of the mythical kingdom of Freedonia. He declares war on neighboring Sylvania over the love of his wealthy backer Mrs. Teasdale, while contending with two inept spies (Chico and Harpo Marx).The film features satire, innuendo, and slapstick humor, and is considered by many to be some of the Brothers’ most brilliant work.\n\nNot rated. Running time: 1 hour 10 minutes"
