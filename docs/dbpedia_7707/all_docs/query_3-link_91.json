        "text": "Arguably the greatest movie of The Marx Brothers, Duck Soup takes place in the country of Freedonia where Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) is appointed the new leader. All too soon he proves to be incompetent and the ambassador from the rival country of Sylvania wishes to start a war with Freedonia so he can take over the country. He enlists the help of a wily woman as well Chico and Harpo who are spies. Chico is caught and his trial ultimately leads to war. However, he is also Firefly’s secretary of War and with the Brothers leading things it is sure to be zany and wild. Beside the ever present puns and quips, some memorable moments include the opening serenade, the street vendor scenes, the famous mirror sequence, and of course the war at the end. This would be the last film with Zeppo but the other brothers would move onto MGM and keep their career going. This film is good but upon seeing more of their films I would say I appreciated A Night at the Opera more.\n\n4.5/5 Stars"
