        "text": "Posted by Larry Gleeson\n\nEdgar Wright announces today’s AFI Movie Club selection: DUCK SOUP – an early sophisticated comedy that holds up well over time. The film appears on three of AFI’s lists of the greatest American films – including #5 on AFI’s 100 YEARS…100 LAUGHS. And the Marx Brothers – Groucho, Chico and Harpo – appear collectively at #20 on AFI’s list of the greatest screen legends!\n\nThe mayor of Fredonia, NY, complained to Paramount Pictures about the name of the mythical kingdom of Freedonia. There is now a film festival in celebration of the film – Freedonia Marxonia: Marx Brothers Film Festival and Symposium – held in Fredonia! In the meantime, watch Billy Crystal and Lily Tomlin talk about their love of the Marx Brothers in this exclusive AFI Archive clip.\n\nInteresting Facts\n\nItalian dictator Benito Mussolini banned the film from Italy because he thought it was a direct attack on him.\n\nGroucho had a very unique explanation of the movie’s title. “Take two turkeys, one goose, four cabbages, but no duck, and mix them together. After one taste, you’ll duck soup the rest of your life.”\n\nDUCK SOUP is the final Marx Brothers film to feature straight man Zeppo Marx?\n\nActress Margaret Dumont starred in half of all Marx Brothers movies. She was an experienced comedienne, who Groucho Marx referred to as “practically the fifth Marx Brother.”\n\nDUCK SOUP doesn’t end at the credits. Engage with your family, friends and others like you who love the movies.
