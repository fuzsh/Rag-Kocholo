        "text": "The Marx Brothers made their way onto the Library of Congress’s National Film Registry in 1990 with their hilarious 1933 film “Duck Soup,” a film many consider to be most emblematic of the famous comedy team.\n\nFilm critic William Wolf once said of this particular mash-up of on-screen mayhem:\n\n“When Paramount released ‘Duck Soup’ in 1933, the reviews were mixed and the film’s lack of commercial success ended the Paramount-Marx Brothers relationship. Yet appreciation for this anarchic, hilarious movie has grown through the years, and many justifiably regard ‘Duck Soup’ as the ultimate Marx Brothers work, the film that best reveals the essence of their talent and originality.”\n\nRead the rest of Wolf’s take on “Duck Soup” (PDF).\n\nTitle: “Duck Soup”\n\nYear of Release: 1933\n\nYear Added to the National Film Registry: 1990 (See all films added to the Registry in 1990.)\n\nTrivia: “Duck Soup” marked the final time that Zeppo Marx appeared with his brothers on screen."
