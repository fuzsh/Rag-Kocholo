It was the last of five Paramount Pictures films released by the Marx brothers.\n\nCompared to the Marx Brothers' previous films, Duck Soup was a box office disappointment, though not entirely a \"flop\" as is sometimes reported. Although it did not do as well as Horse Feathers, it was the sixth-highest-grossing film of 1933, according to Glenn Mitchell in The Marx Brothers Encyclopedia and Simon Louvish in Monkey Business, his biography of the Marx Brothers. However, the film was a box office disappointment for Paramount.\n\nThe film opened to mixed reviews, although this by itself did not end the group's association with Paramount. Bitter contract disputes, including a threatened boycott by the Marxes, soured their negotiations with Paramount just as Duck Soup went into production. After the film fulfilled their five-picture obligation to the studio, the Marxes and Paramount agreed to part ways.\n\nWhile contemporaneous critics of Duck Soup felt it did not quite rise to the level of its predecessors, critical opinion has evolved and the film has since achieved the status of a classic. Duck Soup is now widely considered among many critics and fans to be a masterpiece of comedy as well as the Marx Brothers' finest film.\n\nMost critics at the time disliked it because of its \"dated\" look at politics. Some modern critics are also unimpressed.\n\nEven Groucho himself did not initially think too highly of the film. When asked the significance of the film's politics, Groucho only shrugged and said: \"What significance? We were just four Jews trying to get a laugh.\" Nevertheless, the Brothers were ecstatic when Benito Mussolini took the film as a personal insult and banned it in Italy.\n\nRevived interest in the film (and other 1930s comedies in general) during the 1960s was seen as dovetailing with the rebellious side of American culture in that decade. American literary critic Harold Bloom considers the end of Duck Soup one of the greatest works of American art produced in the 20th century.\n\nIn 1990, Duck Soup was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\n\nIn 2000, readers of Total Film magazine voted Duck Soup the 29th greatest comedy film of all time. It is also one of the earliest films to appear on Roger Ebert's list of The Great Movies.\n\nDuck Soup is also frequently cited as a major influence on the comedic side of The Beatles, and The Beatles themselves admitted that it was an inspiration for their film Help!\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nAFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies – #85\n\nAFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs – #5\n\nAFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – #60\n\nDuck Soup currently holds a 91% among critics on RT, a 93 score on Metacritic, and a 3.9/5 on Letterboxd.\n\nWhat is this movie about?/Elevator Pitch: The importance of good governance and diplomacy.\n\nPlot Summary:\"Duck Soup,\" a classic comedy directed by Leo McCarey and starring the irreverent Marx Brothers, is a cinematic tour de force that gleefully satirizes politics and war. Released in 1933, the film unfolds in the fictional realm of Freedonia, a nation on the brink of bankruptcy and political chaos. Groucho Marx, in his iconic role as Rufus T. Firefly, is appointed as the country's leader, bringing his signature wit and anarchic charm to the forefront. As Firefly navigates diplomatic relations with the neighboring nation of Sylvania, chaos ensues, leading to a riotous blend of slapstick humor and razor-sharp satire.\n\n\"Duck Soup\" remains a timeless masterpiece, celebrated for its brilliant wordplay, absurd antics, and a biting critique of governmental absurdity that resonates across generations. The film's legacy endures as a testament to the Marx Brothers' unparalleled comedic genius and their ability to use laughter as a powerful weapon against the follies of the world.\n\nDid You Know:\n\nGroucho Marx offered the following explanation for the movie's title: \"Take two turkeys, one goose, four cabbages, but no duck, and mix them together. After one taste, you'll duck soup the rest of your life.\"\n\nScreenwriters Harry Ruby and Bert Kalmar were standing on the set one day when an extra standing next to them said, \"I don't know who wrote this stuff but they ought to be arrested...they should be in a different business.\" Kalmer, who was known as a rational and calm man, said to Ruby, \"I'm going over to hit him. Who does he think he is? He's just an extra!\" But before fisticuffs erupted, Kalmer and Ruby were informed that Chico Marx had paid the extra to rib the screenwriters, just for the hell of it.\n\nFinal film of Zeppo Marx. After the film's premiere, he quit The Marx Brothers, citing a dissatisfaction with movie acting overall, and a weariness with being the butt of jokes regarding him as the \"unfunny\" Marx brother.\n\nLeo McCarey told Cahiers du cinema in 1967: \"I don't like (Duck Soup) so much...I never chose to shoot this film. The Marx Brothers absolutely wanted me to direct them in a film. I refused. Then they got angry with the studio, broke their contract and left. Believing myself secure, I accepted the renewal of my own contract with the studio. Soon, the Marx Brothers were reconciled with (Paramount)...and I found myself in the process of directing the Marx Brothers. The most surprising thing about this film was that I succeeded in not going crazy, for I really did not want to work with them: they were completely mad.\"\n\nThe residents of Fredonia, New York, protested because they feared that the similar-sounding nation would hurt their city's reputation. The Marx Brothers quipped in response, telling them to change the name of their town to keep from hurting their movie.\n\nIt was Leo McCarey's idea to film the mirror sequence, based on an old vaudeville routine. It reportedly took only two hours to film.\n\nBest Performance:Harpo Marx (Pinky)/Chico Marx (Chicolini)\n\nBest Secondary Performance: Groucho Marx (Firefly)\n\nMost Charismatic Award: Harpo Marx (Pinky)/Marx Brothers\n\nBest Scene:\n\nIntroduction of Firefly\n\nAmbassador Trentino\n\nLemonade Stand\n\nSecretary of War\n\nWar Plans\n\nMirror Exchange\n\nTrial of Chicolini\n\nTo War\n\nFavorite Scene: Lemonade Stand\n\nMost Indelible Moment: Mirror Exchange\n\nIn Memorium:\n\nElliot Silverstein, 96, American film and television director (A Man Called Horse, Nightmare Honeymoon, The Car, Cat Ballou).\n\nPhil Quartararo, 67, American music industry executive (former President of Virgin Records and Warner Bros.
