        "text": "My first venture into the Marx brothers’ filmography has been well documented. They made a very quick and powerful impression that very few artists have been able to do to my sensibilities. It was with this spirit that I embarked upon a quick binge of the other films they made, each one making an even better impression than the last.\n\nRight after Animal Crackers, the Marx brothers made Monkey Business. This film features them all in of a position of impunity, playing stowaways on a cruise liner, but once again bringing havoc everywhere they go like leeches on a wound. The plot once more carries no purpose other than to allow the brothers to create the most chaos possible. The same pattern repeats itself in their next film, Horse Feathers, only this time the brothers return to their formula of Groucho playing the aristocrat, Zeppo his assistant, Chico the dimwit, and Harpo the chaotic and mime-like mastermind pulling all the strings just by sheer presence and coincidence. They also feature a wonderful foray into the world of American football, where their wacky and creative antics meet the grit and toughness of the gridiron in spectacular fashion."
