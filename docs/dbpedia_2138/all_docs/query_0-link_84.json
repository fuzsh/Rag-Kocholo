His mother sings in a choir and plays in several plays; his youngest sister, Zorka Jan? (1921-1946), also became a film actress. In 1934, Baarová left Prague for Berlin after winning a competition in the UFA studios for a role in the film Barcarole.\n\nshe had a relationship with the French actor Charles Boyer with whom, she began two years earlier before him: Before leaving for the United States, the French actor began his career in France in 1934.\n\nIn Berlin, she made a successful appearance in the film Barcarole (1935), with the German actor Gustav Fröhlich (1902-1987). She and Fröhlich, meanwhile divorced from the Hungarian opera singer Gitta Alpár, became lovers and played together in several films. Baarová also performed on stage at Deutsches Theater and Volksbühne. She has received several job offers from Hollywood studios. She rejected them under pressure from the Nazi authorities, but later she regretted and told her biographer, Josef ?? kvorecký: \"I could have been as famous as Marlene Dietrich.\" After his engagement with Fröhlich, the couple moved to Schwanenwerder Island on the outskirts of Berlin, where his house was close to the residence of Joseph Goebbels, a key member of the Nazi government of Adolf Hitler with a decisive voice in the German and Nazi film production. cinema. Baarová, who was still working for the Ufa studios, met him when Goebbels visited Fröhlich's house in 1936. Gradually, they came together and, under Goebbels' impetus, began a relationship that lasted two years. Their love story caused serious complications between Goebbels and his wife Magda. When the minister began to show up in public with his mistress, Magda Goebbels in turn began an affair with Goebbels Secretary of State Karl Hanke and finally asked Hitler for permission to divorce her husband. According to Baarová's own statements, she, fearing Goebbels' hurt pride, approached the dictator for help.\n\nHitler intervened on August 16, 1938 and reprimanded his minister, declaring that, given his \"perfect marriage\" and the upcoming annexation of the Sudetenland, his affair with a Czech actress was an impossibility. Berlin police chief Wolf-Heinrich von Helldorff told Baarová that she must immediately quit her relationship with Goebbels and that he was prohibited from executing Hitler's direct order. [His recently completed film A Prussian Love Story which portrays the love story between Wilhelm I and Polish princess Elisa Radziwill, and was a thinly veiled reference to Goebbels and Barrová, was banned, and not shown in theaters until in 1950 as Liebeslegende (\"History of Love\"). The snipers shouted \"Sors, ??the fucking minister\" when the character of Baarovà appeared on the screen at the premiere of Der Spieler (\"The Player\") ), and did not stop until the show was stopped. The film's run was over and the actress had a nervous breakdown. She tried to contact friends in Hollywood, intending to go, but Hitler told her that she could not leave the country. Followed by the Gestapo wherever she went, commanded by Helldorf to stop making public appearances, and pressed by her friends, in the winter of 1938-39 Baarová fled to Prague. There, she was temporarily allowed to perform under German occupation and, in 1942, moved to Italy, where she starred in films like Grazia (1943), La Fornarina (1944), Vivere Ancora (1945) and other.\n\nAfter the Allied troops occupied Italy, she had to return to Prague. In April 1945 Lída Baarová left Prague again for Germany. On the way, she was arrested by US military police, imprisoned in Munich, and extradited to Czechoslovakia.\n\nIn Czechoslovakia in 1945, Baarová and his family were arrested because they were suspected of collaborating with the Germans during the war. His mother died under interrogation; her sister Zorka committed suicide in 1946. She was released after 18 months in police custody for lack of evidence. She had never been convicted or sentenced. During her detention, she was often visited by puppeteer Jan Kopecký and they finally married on July 27, 1947. Kopecký was a close relative of a prominent politician in the post-war Czechoslovak government. Kopecký's prominent parent did not approve the marriage and Kopecký lost his job as a result of this. This is one of the reasons why Jan Kopecký and Lída Baarová decided to emigrate in 1948. Kopecký emigrated to Argentina, leaving Lída behind to recover in Dr. Lundwall's sanatorium.\n\nIn Austria, the actress tried a return, but when the Austro-British actor Anton Walbrook withdrew from a film where he was thrown with her, she went to Argentina to escape the negative media that result . Living in extreme poverty, she decided to return to Italy. Her husband stayed in Argentina and they divorced in 1956. Back in Italy, she appeared in several films, including I Vitelloni de Fellini (1953), where she played the wife of a wealthy merchant. In 1958, she moved to Salzburg, where she again performed on stage. She married Austrian doctor Kurt Lundwall in 1969 (died 1972).\n\nIn the 1990s, Baarová reappeared on the cultural scene of the Czech Republic. She published her autobiography and a film, Bittersweet Memories by Lída Baarová, was released in 1995 and won an award at the 1996 Art Film Festival in Tren?ianske Teplice, Slovakia.\n\nBaarová suffered from Parkinson's disease and died in Salzburg in 2000, while living alone in the area she inherited after the death of her second husband, Dr. Lundwall. If she ever felt guilty about her past, she rigorously repressed it. \"There is no doubt that Goebbels was an interesting character,\" she remarked in 1997, \"a charming and intelligent man and a very good storyteller, you could guarantee that he would have a party with his little asides. and his jokes. \" Her ashes were buried in Prague's Straße Cemetery, where she rests with her parents and her sister Zorka.\n\nIn 2016 her life was filmed in Filip Ren?'s Devil's Mistress (Lída Baarová), with Tatiana Pauhofová as Lida Baarová and Karl Marcovics as Goebbels.\n\nSome films in the filmography of Lída BAAROVÁ :\n\nLída BAAROVÁ appeared in :\n\n1957 - Le Ciel brûle1953 - Pitié pour celle qui tombe★★★★☆1953 - Les Vitelloni (Lida BAAROWA)1936 - Les Traîtres"
