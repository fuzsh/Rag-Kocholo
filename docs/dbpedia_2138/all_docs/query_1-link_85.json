        "text": "Retribuce\n\nDiskuse\n\nPart I - Coping with the wartime past in the period up to the issuance of the retributive decrees\n\nI have been working on the issue of retributions and prosecution of war criminals in our country for several years and therefore I present my overview of the most famous cases. I would be grateful for any additional information.\n\n8.5.1945 - Former SdP leader Konrad Henlein (born 6.5.1898) was arrested in Loket and taken to Pilsen, where he committed suicide on 10.5.\n\n9.5.1945 - Early in the morning the Reich Minister Karl Hermann Frank fled Prague. However, his journey did not last long. A few hours later he was recognized when passing through Rokycany and arrested together with his wife Karla and children Edda, Wolfdieter and Holl and soon transferred to the prison in Pilsen. Karola Franková was later handed over to the NKVD and taken to the USSR at the end of May. She returned to Germany after eleven years of imprisonment and it took her another four years to find her three lost children.\n\n10.5.1945 - In the town of Trnávka, Franz Hodina, the local mayor and pre-war NS deputy for the SdP, was lynched by a mob and killed on the spot.\n\n- In Prague, one of the most powerful men of Czech cinema, the successful actor, director and producer Jan Sviták, was lynched and eventually shot by a mob. (After World War I, he began acting and later became a film director, producer and then technical director of the Foja Film Studios in Prague-Radlice. In addition, he was in charge of the film club, which was located in Lucerna and where representatives of Czech culture and especially Czech cinema met. The German circles used the film club to make various contacts and arrange many deals, but above all it was a place where they maintained contacts with Czech filmmakers. In addition to the film club, Sviták also ran the film headquarters, where decisions about new scripts and the casting of actors for individual roles were made. Although he did not turn anyone in during the war, and on the contrary tried to help people, on the night of 9-10 May he was dragged from his apartment by members of the Revolutionary Guards. Sviták was very well informed about Czech Gestapo confederates among the cultural workers and it is even reported that he kept a notebook where he wrote down how various people came to him during the war to denounce him. Therefore, it is probably no coincidence that the group of about twelve guardsmen who came to Svitak's apartment were brought there by Svitak's deputy in the film office. It was he who was said to have been most interested in the documents Sviták had at home. The guards dragged Sviták to Bartolomějská Street, where they interrogated him. They wouldn't even let him make a phone call. In the morning, they handed him over to the frenzied crowd, who literally dragged him down Národní třída to the church in his underwear. They kicked him, they beat him, umbrella wires tore his face. At St. Martin's Church, the lynching reached its climax. Someone brought in a Soviet soldier, who ended his life with a short burst from a machine gun.\n\n11.5.1945 - In Cimelice near Písek, the commander of the SS troops in the Protectorate, Count General Karl Friedrich von Pückler - Burghaus, committed suicide.\n\n12.5.1945 - In Prague, Othmar Kallina, a pre-war MP for the DNP, committed suicide for fear of arrest.\n\n- In Brno, President Edvard Beneš declared that the German nation \"has ceased to be human at all in this war, has ceased to be humanly bearable and appears to us only as one great human monster.\" He finally said: \"We have said to ourselves that the German problem in the republic must be definitely liquidated...\" On 19 May, an article by the president's aide Prokop Drtina entitled \"We cannot live with the Germans in one state\" was published in Svobodny slovo, where it was said, among other things: \"...what is, and what must be, the first task in establishing a new life: to cleanse the Republic entirely and completely of Germans.\" And further: \"I judge that in our new Republic no more of German should be allowed to be spoken than these three words: Heim ins Reich! But in order to achieve this goal, we must begin the expulsion of the Germans from our lands at once, immediately, by all means, before nothing we must pause and hesitate... Every one of us must help in the cleansing of the fatherland...\" (Prokop Drtina, Czechoslovakia, My Destiny, Volume 2, Prague 1991, pp. 63-64) These and similar speeches provoked a \"savage\" expulsion of the Germans, which was given a legal framework only after the Potsdam meeting of the Great Powers. (Strong words about the settlement with the Germans were already spoken during the war: Edvard Beneš's radio speech of 27 October 1943: \"In our country the end of the war will be written in blood. The Germans will be repaid mercilessly and many times over for everything they have committed in our country since 1938. The whole nation will take part in this struggle. There will be no Czech who will not take part in this task and no patriot who will not exact retribution for all that the nation has had to endure.\" (Central European Observer, XX, Nr. 22/1943). Edvard Beneš in the Council of State on February 3, 1944: \"The coup must be violent, it must be a violent showdown between the people and the Germans... a bloody, merciless struggle.\" (Einheit, 4/1944). Gen. \"When our day comes, the whole nation will return to the old Hussite cry, \"Cut them, beat them, spare none.\" Everyone must get a suitable weapon to hit the Germans. If not a rifle, then something else that will cut, stab or hit.\" (News Chronicle, November 4, 1944). In all, 3 million Germans were removed from Czechoslovakia and 2,964,000 hectares of land were confiscated. During the savage removal, 25,000 Germans lost their lives. And what the expulsion looked like: \"I saw a large number of these people, it is almost half a million, literally starving to death on the roads. I saw children and infants lying dead in the ditches, victims of famine or epidemics whose arms and legs were no stronger than a man's thumb. Evacuees were scavenging from Russian field kitchens, which were often already in decay, to satisfy their insane hunger.\" When the removal was halted in the wake of the Potsdam Conference, the Czechoslovak government began to make life even more unbearable for the Germans. \"Women and their children, including infants, were forced into the factory where they slept on the concrete floor and slowly died from lack of food. The men were taken to work under armed guard...\" It is appropriate to recall the worst excesses in the removal of the Germans:\n\nThe Brno Death March - From the decree of the National Committee for Greater Brno of 30 May 1945: \"The Provincial National Committee in Brno has ordered the following by its resolution of 29 May 1945 by decree of the same date No. 78/1945: The Germans residing in the district of the city of Brno, namely all women and children, as well as men under 14 years of age and over sixty years of age and men incapable of work, shall be removed from the city. These persons may take with them whatever they can carry, but not jewels and deposit books. The other Germans - men - shall be concentrated on the work of cleaning up and repairing the damage in the city of Brno and shall be marked with a capital N. After the work is done, these Germans shall also be removed from Brno.\" The signal for the \"Brno march\" was the aforementioned speech of President Edvard Beneš at the Brno town hall. The humiliation of women and children, the plundering of their property and the murders were often carried out by former collaborators. They were raped, beaten, tortured, Germans were not allowed to ride the trams, had to wear the N mark, were not given any ration cards except bread rolls and were not allowed to speak German. According to many testimonies, the Russians treated the Germans much more humanely and with more understanding than the Czechs, but unfortunately they also raped immature girls. 6000 Germans were herded into a railway tunnel north of Brno. What happened to the starving people in the dark tunnel for five days and five nights defies description. The establishment of the concentration camps was obviously intended to make the Germans eventually accept the removal as a kind of mercy. The interned Germans slept without blankets on the bare ground in the open air, were given inadequate food, so that many lost 20 to 30 kg in weight, were plagued by disease during hard labour, were robbed, sanitary and medical care was inadequate, the guards, mostly young people, acted with extreme cruelty, torture, burning, murder and rape were the order of the day. In the Kounic dormitories, where the Gestapo had its torture chambers during the war, atrocities and crimes against humanity continued long after the war. However, the death march itself was no spontaneous act of righteous vengeance. One of the victims recalls, \"The screaming guards chased us with rubber truncheons. Laughing and spitting crowds milled along the street. People tried to tear off our clothes, picking up everything we were no longer able to carry any further.\" Another memory: \"When it was light, they drove us out into the street. The death march of thousands of German women, children and old people from Brno towards the Austrian border began. Many fell from exhaustion into the ditches, where they received a blow of mercy.\" The escorting guards, often immature adolescents, kept inventing new torments. \"Kiss my gun, you damned German swine!\" they shouted at one old man. He had to say three times that he was a swine, kissing the barrel of the pistol, which they then \"smashed into his skull until blood spurted.\" More and more people were falling down from exhaustion, first the sick and the old, later pregnant women and children. Mothers who stayed with their lying children were killed by a shot in the back of the head. \"The most horrible thing I saw: A young woman lying in a meadow. She had just given birth. She was wailing and wailing, but she and the newborn were so long attacked with blows and kicks that they were both left lying lifeless.\" Typhus, dysentery, constant rape, screams of the tortured, piles of the dead, suicides, humiliation that defies description, mass graves along the roadside, torture from thirst and hunger. Just before the Austrian border, the Germans were robbed for the last time of the pitiful remains of their possessions and left to their own fate. Apart from President Beneš and the government, the main culprits of the whole operation were the security officer of the Provincial National Committee, Karel Smítal, and above all Bedřich Pokorný, the SNB commander for Moravia, a former captain in the Czechoslovak army, after the occupation a collaborator with the Sicherheitsdienst in Brno, who, together with his wife, who was posing as a German, lived in an apartment taken from Jews during the war, and was carefully sought out by the NKVD for his dirty work. The exact number of victims will probably never be known, but estimates range from 8 to 10 thousand dead, with a total of 30,000 Germans expelled from Brno alone.\n\nPrague - In May 1945, several dozen local Germans were concentrated in the German Real Gymnasium at 22 Stepanska Street in Prague. When the Uprising broke out, most of them were interned as members of the enemy nation and after the end of the war they waited to see what their fate would be. On the afternoon of May 10, a group of armed men entered the school building and selected six of the youngest and strongest. \"They led us to Wenceslas Square,\" one recalled. \"It was crowded with a raging mob, so they had to create an alley for us first. I never thought what a grin a human face could turn into as they grabbed at us with gnashing teeth, spat at us and shouted. With all their might and guns drawn, the guards had to protect us from these creatures, I cannot say humans. So we reached the corner of Vodičkova Street and saw our task: on a large billboard there were three naked corpses hanging by their feet, doused in petrol and burned. Faces disfigured beyond recognition, all teeth knocked out, mouths just a bloody hole. The fried skin was sticking to our hands, so we had to carry them to Štěpánská and drag them when we couldn't carry any more. When we laid the dead down, they made us kiss them on the mouth: 'They are your brothers, so kiss them!'` What was all the ugliness worth, life is kinder to man after all, so we pressed our clamped lips into the bloody pool that was to be a mouth. To this day I can still feel those icy heads in my hands.\" Testimony of Helena Burgner, 7.7.1946: \"On 9.5. I was beaten in my own apartment by the caretaker and then taken without any luggage to remove barricades in the streets of Prague. My work group consisted of 20 women, led by a certain Professor Zelenka. When we left the house, Professor Zelenka handed us over to the crowd with the words: \"Here I am leading you German swine.\" With the words \"You German whore\" we had to kneel down, then they cut off our hair with a bayonet. They took off our shoes and stockings, so we had to go barefoot. With every step and every movement we were beaten inhumanly with slats, rubber truncheons, etc. If a woman fell to the ground, they stepped on her, rolled her in excrement or threw stones at her until she died. I myself fainted several times and was then doused with water and had to continue working. When I really couldn't anymore, I got kicked in the left side of my body, which broke 2 ribs. During one fainting spell, a piece of flesh about 4 square centimetres in size was cut out of my foot. Such an ordeal lasted all afternoon. My group included women in high stages of pregnancy and nursing mothers who were treated exactly the same. One of these women had a miscarriage in 3 or 4 days. In the evening we returned home. My own children did not recognize me, so I was disfigured by the abuse. My face was covered with bloody scabs, my clothes were left in bloody rags, 2 women from our house committed suicide out of despair, one went mad. Our bodies were all blue and swollen. We all had open wounds on our heads. Since none of us could move, we were kept under guard for 3 weeks in a small apartment in our house. During that time they tortured us to the limit of our mental capacity. They threatened to take away our children and send us to Siberia. After 3 weeks we were taken to Hagibor camp. 1,200 people were housed in 4 barracks. All of them fell ill with dysentery from hunger, because the diet consisted of less than a quart of thin oat broth twice a day for the children, a quart of black coffee and one thin slice of bread each for the adults in the morning and evening, and water soup without any additives at noon. Toilets were only allowed to be used three times a day at a certain hour. Everyone was subject to the duty of work. Every evening the work parties returned to camp beaten. There was no medical treatment. The one German doctor who was locked up with us did what he could, but he had no medicines or bandages or the most primitive instruments such as thermometers, so that women who returned with gunshot wounds and other injuries were left practically untreated. There were epidemics of measles, scarlet fever, whooping cough, diphtheria, etc., for which there were no remedies. One day we were driven out on appeal. We had to stand in the open air for 7 hours when a terrific hail and gale swept in, tearing the roof off two barracks. That same day at the station we were loaded onto open heavily damaged coal cars so tightly that we could hardly stand. We arrived in Cologne at 3 o'clock in the morning in the pouring rain. There we were put up in a ruined school. While marching from the station to this school, two women died of exhaustion. From the school we were taken the next day to the building of the Czech Red Cross. Every night the Czech Red Cross nurses let Soviet soldiers into the camp, pointing out the pretty women and girls, who were then raped in an inhuman way, often many times a night. The desperate cries for help of these women could be heard throughout the night. Many had their faces and noses bitten off in the morning, and lay listlessly without any help, as medical treatment was not even available in this camp. After a few days, 45 women, including one with 6 small children, were sent to a Czech farm to work. We stayed there for 3 and a half months until the last two women, including myself, collapsed from exhaustion. With meals of the same kind as in Hagibor, we had to do hard physical work, even on Sundays. The children also received the same diet as the adults, without a drop of milk, so that three out of every four died. All the children under the age of one died in the Prague camp. We were guarded by armed patrols while we worked. When my child got scarlet fever like many other children and I begged the driver on my knees to bring him a doctor, he replied, \"The National Committee has ordered that the Germans will not get medical help.\" As I had contracted pleurisy as a result of my broken ribs, I was sent to Prague to be transported to the Reich. I was released for Christmas 1945 to Asha at the intervention of the British Embassy, where I worked as a secretary for 12 years.\"\n\nÚstí nad Labem - On 30 July 1945, at 15:30, an explosion occurred in a sugar factory in nearby Krásné Březno, where unused munitions of various kinds were being concentrated. The detonation was enormous and caused great damage. A rumour immediately spread in the town that it was a sabotage caused by the local Germans. \"I went into town immediately, I didn't put on my white armband, and that was my luck. The hunt for the Germans had begun,\" said Alois Ullmann, a Sudeten German Social Democrat and an eyewitness to the events, years later. People on the streets \"were armed with all sorts of implements, such as slats from fences, billets, shovel handles, etc., which they had procured somewhere. They used them indiscriminately to beat to the point of collapse those who spoke German or wore armbands... In the vicinity of the Market Square and the railway station, the wildest gangs were on the rampage. They threw women with baby carriages into the Elbe and they became targets for the soldiers who shot at them until they didn't float away. They also threw Germans into the water reservoir in the Market Square, and as soon as they surfaced, they pushed them under the surface with sticks. It was not until about 5 p.m. that a few Russian officers appeared and tried to clear the streets, while some Czechs in uniform helped them. A curfew was then issued in Czech by a silencer.\"\n\nTeplice - The literary historian Václav Černý left his testimony about the local massacre. When he returned to his birthplace in eastern Bohemia in the summer of 1945, he learned \"what had happened at the other end of his native horizon, in Teplice-Weckersdorf on the uppermost Metuji River. After Munich, all of our people, both the old and the new, republican ones, left the countryside of Broumov, adjacent to the Czech Náchod region, for the interior. And in May 1945 they came back in droves and made \"order\", they simply expelled all Germans from Teplice, even before the legal and state regulations on expulsion were issued! And in time, the crowd of expelled Germans from the border returned, nowhere they were wanted or accepted without accompanying documents. But in Teplice they had already been written off, their houses occupied, their possessions divided, and local ladies were already walking around in their furs. And so there was no choice but to restore \"order\" a second time. They took the Germans to the rocks and there they shot them in the forest and buried them. In time, the foreign German relatives began to look for the missing, entrusted the search to the International Red Cross, the authorities of the victorious powers turned to Prague, and it came to the dug edge of the murder shaft: the girl on top of the pile of corpses still clutched her death-stiffened hands in it, and the twist of her body betrayed that she had died kneeling in a plea for mercy...\"\n\nPostoloprty - Around two thousand Germans died in the largest post-war massacre of Germans in Postoloprty in the Lounsko region in June 1945, the exact numbers are unknown. The Germans were mostly shot in the back of the head and buried in mass graves. Only the exhumation a year later lasted five days. No one has been punished for this to this day. The most tragic mass murder of the post-war period was indeed investigated by a parliamentary commission in 1947, but some high officials in pre-February Czechoslovakia were convinced that these acts should be covered up and the evidence destroyed. Klement Gottwald wrote to the commission that it was not in the state's interest to investigate the incident too much, and the ministers of the interior and defence, Václav Nosek and Ludvík Svoboda, even suggested that the evidence of the massacres of Germans be destroyed and that journalists be forbidden to write about these matters.\n\nJihlava - Franz Kvapil's testimony from September 2, 1946. The following night, about 1,200 Germans committed suicide. By Christmas there were about 2,000 dead. On 24 and 25 May, within 20 minutes, the partisans drove the German population out of their apartments and locked them up in the camps Helenenthal and Altenberg. These camps were officially called 'concentration camps'. 3 700 people were placed in Helenenthal and 3 000 in Altenberg. Neither drinking water nor drinking water was adequately provided. There were no toilet or washing facilities. In the first eight days we were not given anything to eat. Later there was only thin soup and 100 grams of bread a day. The children were given a quarter of a litre of milk after the first eight days. Every day several elderly people and small children were dying. On 8 June the inhabitants of Helenenthal were robbed of everything and the next day they were led on foot 33 km through Telč to Stonarovo. We were driven by whips. The old people, who had collapsed, were carried on a wagon. This march cost 350 lives due to exhaustion and hunger. In Stonarovo, 3,500 people were crammed into a camp designed for 250 people. Most of them had to camp outside despite the rain. On the second day, families were divided into 5 different camps, with men, women and children separated. There were no meals for eight days. Then the usual soups. Once in the women's camp, two women were killed and one seriously wounded by a single shot. The punishment of beatings was the order of the day for both men and women. There was even a special cell for this. The management sold the camp inhabitants to Czech peasants as labourers. In August, conditions improved, but by Christmas about 500 prisoners had died in Stonarovo. In January, the camp was dissolved. I myself was placed in pre-trial detention on 9 January 1946 and released on 7 August 1946.\"\n\n13.5.1945 - State President Emil Hácha was arrested in Lány by government decision and placed in the prison hospital at Pankrác. He was already in a condition that he could not walk, he did not perceive his surroundings, he did not speak. He was placed in cell No. 4 and given prison number 3844. \"...he was in a cell full of lice, fleas and bedbugs. Occasionally the guards would take him out into the corridor and urinate on him from the galleries....he had to sleep on straw and was not given any food digestible for a person of his condition...He was officially provided only with food, the consumption of which was out of the question for him, such as hard bread.\" He was also unlawfully denied visitors. On June 25, he presented with bilateral pneumonia following a previous bout of tonsillitis. The agony lasted 36 hours. On 27 June at 8.50 p.m. Emil Hácha died. On 30 June he was buried secretly and with the assistance of the police in the Vinohrady cemetery. His name could not be placed on the grave by order of the Minister of the Interior, Václav Nosek.\n\n- In connection with the post-war arrests, 1,215 internment camps and 846 labour camps were established in Czechoslovakia. For example, the interpellation of the MP Ota Hora to the Minister of the Interior, Václav Nosek, dated 29 May 1947, which describes the situation in the Kolín region, shows how things were in such camps. Kárník first set up a so-called death column of 40 internees, which was later expanded to 70 people. The detainees were marked with a red circle on a white background 18 cm in diameter. The mark of shame had to be worn on the chest and back. The selection for the death column was made at random, and all the interrogated from Cologne were especially designated for it. They were assigned the most difficult and dangerous work, and Kárnik declared on every occasion that they were destined for gradual liquidation. The interrogatees tasted many punishments: blows with fists and truncheons, kicks and the knocking out of teeth were common sights, which were repeated daily. Internees were sentenced to 25 to 50 blows with a round rubber cable with a wire up to 1 cm thick inside. The guards took turns in the beatings. After such punishment, the exercise continued to \"stir the blood\". It was 50 to 100 squats, sometimes more. Other exercises followed, until the internees passed out. In order to resurrect themselves, the internees were put under a cold shower, during which they had to raise their heads and sing while water flowed from the shower into their mouths. They were also often beaten or placed in front of a tub filled with water and knocked into the tub with blows. Orders to squat across a corridor 100 metres long were also a common sight. On the night of June 6-7, 1945, Karnik, his companions and a woman came from Cologne. He personally drove all the secured Czechs in their underwear before midnight into the courtyard, which was full of mud and puddles after the rain. The half-hour warm-up consisted of short trotting, punctuated by commands to \"Get down!\" The guards trampled on the hands and heads of the interrogated lying in the mud, while Karnik made a speech, recalling in the mind to-day something like this: 'You will all die or be hanged here, and if some of you manage to slip away in court, Karnik will follow you like a shadow until he has killed you, or at least put out your eyes. You were all Nazi henchmen, and now we're going to show you what Nazism looks like.\" And then it started: First, the guards had to perform the \"Paradeschritt\" and whoever didn't raise his legs high enough was beaten. After this solemn march, the internees entered the clamped unit, and then followed a questioning by Karnik as to who was innocent in the camp. Those who did not understand this joke of Kárnik's, and stepped out of line, received 15 to 25 blows with a carbine on the back of the body. Those who had already been broken on that part of the body from earlier received 10 to 15 blows on the feet. Others who pleaded not guilty were beaten twice. This was followed by more falling to the ground, \"barrel rolling\" and other exercises. To complete the impression for the terrified population, who could see into the illuminated camp from the houses opposite, more flares were fired throughout the torture. As these scenes aroused the indignation of the inhabitants of the surrounding houses, the Kárnik ordered that further physical torture be carried out in the corridor of the barracks. A so-called \"death run\" was set up from the guards. A bench was built at the beginning of the corridor, the internees were placed on it and given 15 blows. In doing so, they had to count the blows themselves, and when it happened that one of them stopped counting because of great pain, the beatings were started again until everyone had actually counted out his 15 blows. Then these ransomed men had to run through the alley of death, being beaten with a club, or with the hand, or by kicking, by the new guards standing on either side, no matter where the blow fell. The column of the heaviest criminals - according to Kárnik, of course - who worked in the brickyard of the Bůzek company in Kolín, were ordered to produce 500 hand bricks per day per interrogated person. If this number was not met on just one day, they were all punished with 25 lashes and drilled until they passed out. Most internees vomited while rolling barrels against the plant. At the end of July 1945, a prisoner who had escaped from the camp in Jihlava was caught in Kolín. He was a man of tall stature, stocky and in good health. When he was brought to the camp, he was sentenced to 50 lashes by Kárnik for having escaped from the camp. The payoff was in the courtyard at roll call. After about the sixth blow he threw off the guards who held him, and was therefore knocked down and dragged to the office. There he was beaten so that he remained unconscious, and in his underwear, without underpants, was hung by his bound hands on a post of the high fence by the gate. He hung thus from about eight o'clock in the evening until four o'clock in the morning. Throughout the night there was a very violent storm and a heavy downpour. On waking he was lying on a stretcher in the corridor and died shortly afterwards. The last great torture carried out by Kárnik was on the night of 23-24 September 1945. The internees called this night the Night of St. Bartholomew. After 11 o'clock in the evening, Kárnik ran through the quarters shouting \"alles heraus\", and drove everyone out into the corridor to examine their washed feet. There were quite a few who had to go to the yard for exercise, while the others were allowed to return to the room thinking that they had already had a room. But they hadn't, for a new command came to enter the corridor in a huddled line along the wall. And then it began. First, Karnik's speech about the Xindi, the wretched dogs he must destroy, etc. After the speech, Karnik, with a bamboo cane fitted with a wire inside, went along the line, and everyone got two blows on the right cheek and two on the left. They were all bleeding. Then a new command, kneel facing the wall. Everyone got four blows to the head. This feat was accompanied by words from the barber: \"This is not communism, this is democracy as Karnik imagines it.\" During this torture, Ales Osecky from Kolin had to play on the violin compositions by Fibich, Dvorak and others, as well as national songs. Osecký was also interned in the camp. Kárnik and Hála gave someone else a kick now and then, and then Hála dragged a seriously ill cab driver, Jan Strnad from Kolín, from the camp hospital. In the corridor of the barracks, in front of the other internees, Strnad received about 70 blows with a cane from Hala, and was so wounded that he was unrecognizable the next day. This violence lasted until 2:30 a.m., with the result that by 5 a.m. the four interned doctors had to treat over 100 broken heads. These 100 internees with broken heads, barely standing on their feet, had to start their journey to work in the morning at the Petroleum and Metallurgical Works. Soon afterwards, Kárník, Hála, Vilím and Mikes were arrested and imprisoned in the prison of the regional court in Kutná Hora. After about six weeks, however, they were released. They both went to the borderlands. Even worse abuse was committed in the camp in Radboř near Kolín. For example, František Osecký, a merchant from Kolín, was beaten to death there a few hours after his arrival. His corpse was deliberately polluted and buried while singing mocking songs by the pond near Kořenice. During interrogations in the camp, the internees were stabbed, hung from trees by their legs and beaten. In total, 22 internees were tortured to death in the Cologne internment camp.\"\n\nShortly after liberation, tens of thousands of non-Communists suspected of collaboration with the Germans were arrested. They were inhumanly tortured and many died as a result of their imprisonment. The Soviet authorities also participated in the terror. One of their groups, based in the Jiřího z Poděbrad barracks in Prague, executed dozens of people on the nights after the liberation, including by burning. All these atrocities were legalised by Presidential Decree No. 137/1945 of 27 October 1945 and by Act No. 115/1946 Coll., according to which \"an act which would constitute a judicial offence under the regulations in force is not criminal if it was committed between 30 September 1938 and 28 October 1945 because of the struggle to regain the freedom of the Czechs and Slovaks, or if it was an expression of a desire for just retribution for the acts of the occupiers or their helpers.\"\n\n14.5.1945 - The Czech police arrested former Prime Minister Rudolf Beran, who had been free for only 8 days.\n\n19.5.1945 - President Edvard Beneš issued Decree No. 5/1945 Coll., on the national administration of the property of Germans, Hungarians, traitors and collaborators and on the invalidity of certain property acts from the time of the occupation.

This recommendation, however, the prosecutor accepted and the prosecution did so, as would anyone who was a member of the protectorate government, committed the crime of treason under section 1 of the retribučního of the law.

The investigative body in the presence of five other persons said to me: \"I got up and went to the Castle, to polishing some order of the Czech lion award for merit for the Ram. We need from You other statements.

What I was doing, I was always in the most honest efforts to serve their state, nation and the state.“ It finished with the following words: \"Frequently during the trial was to see about what kind of policy the government doing Raw and my. I'd say generally: \"we Made a policy of self-preservation of the state!\" Nothing else we could do.“ The decision of the court again met with a demagogic campaign in the communist press, calling for the highest punishment.

To imprisonment were convicted 19 888 persons in the total length of 206 334 years, taking the entire punishment or a considerable part of the executing in the separate working sections. Crumb also reminded that the political importance acquired in particular cases, which were tried before a National court in Prague and were the most important domestic leaders protektorátního the regime and activists, including people zkompromitovaných from the time immediately preceding the nazi occupation. Around these cases also arose in the public, but also between the political parties in CZECHOSLOVAKIA, the most controversy and conflicts. To clear the report of the minister of Sawdust was in the days of the 10. and 11. jun wide-ranging debate and 2. July then the house unanimously approved a two-year activity of the extraordinary courts in the Czech lands, and even the votes of the communists, who in the debate raised a number of critical reservations. Retribuce was terminated.

Měl jsem pocit, že vše je v pořádku do doby než jsem narazil na dva údaje, které si odporují. Obě informace se týkají armádního generála Alois Podhajského - viz:\n\n19.6.1945\n\nVy tvrdíte: \"... ve vězení zemřel gen. Alois Podhajský ...\"\n\nK tomuto datu si dovoluji poznamenat, že spíše patří k zatčení gen. Podhajského (po měsíci vyšetřování propuštěn z vazby).\n\n24.12.1946\n\nVy tvrdíte: \"Ve vyšetřovací vazbě v Praze na Pankráci zemřel předválečný náčelník hlavního štábu a generální inspektor československé branné moci, arm. gen. Alois Podhajský.\"\n\nAni v tomto případě nemohu souhlasit, protože gen. Podhajský zemřel doma ve věku 82 let (pravděpodobně na stařeckou sešlost). Navíc v té době již nebyl generálem, protože 04.06.1946 byl v nepřítomnosti odsouzen k ztrátě hodnosti a odebrání vyznamenání.\n\nZdroj\n\nPostavy z kalendáře historika PhDr. Libora Vykoupila, Rozhlas Brno, pořad: Ecce Homo, 08.02.2004.\n\nBrněnské vojenské osobnosti: Armádní generál Alois Podhajský, Listy univerzity obrany 2008, č. 6, str. 22.\n\nInternet\n\n/topic/postview/21832/\n\n/topic/postview/29091/\n\n/topic/postview/90578/\n\nP.
