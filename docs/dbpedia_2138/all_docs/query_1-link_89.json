        "text": "Propaganda as a weapon and a tool of totalitarian power: The image of the concept in the common discourse of the war and occupation years 1939–1945The author of the article describes the ways of conceptualizing Nazi totalitarian propaganda during the Second World War 1939–1945 in occupied Poland. This totalitarian discourse created many defense mechanisms on the level of colloquial knowledge, humor directed against the occupant, and was the object of counter-propaganda activities conducted by Polish underground organizations. This article describes a fragment of the “anti-totalitarian discourse” that emerges from the diaries and journals of the period described.\n\nDuring the First World War (1914-1918), all belligerent governments realized that propaganda proficiency was critical to selling their causes and stirring up support for the war. Yet German propagandists in particular struggled to master mass media, manage their messages, and build audience trust during the Great War in their goal to control domestic and foreign public opinion. Although previous scholarship has agreed that the German propaganda machine failed, little has been said about how Germany recognized these failures early on and sought to remedy them through increasingly modern propaganda strategies-even if those strategies were ultimately no match for the public's growing distrust of official information. This monograph examines how it was that more institutions, more manpower, new publicity initiatives, copying tactics from enemies, crowdsourcing ideas, and eventually focusing on visuals and film did little to boost morale at home or improve Germany's reputation abroad. The findings rest on a historical analysis of military dispatches, federal policy documents, letters, news stories, propaganda materials, and memoirs located in German and U.S. archives. Although many of the methods and tactics these early propagandists used would fail, others would become part of the universal toolbox governments still rely on to influence people's views and spread information."
