        "text": "The European Data Journalism Network looked at 145,933 streets named after individuals in 30 major European cities located in 17 different countries. Only 9% of these are named after a woman. Behind this figure, there is a wide range in the share that women seem to have in street naming, given that the degree of diversity and representation varies significantly from city to city: Stockholm tops the ranking with 19.5% of its streets named after women, followed by Copenhagen (13.4%) and Berlin (12.1%). On the other hand, Hungary’s Debrecen has the lowest share of streets honouring women (2.7%), followed by Prague and Athens, in the streets of which women make up less than 5% of the honoured people. At the same time, more than 90% of European streets are dedicated to white men.\n\nThese are some of the main results of Mapping Diversity, a large-scale data investigation and analysis coordinated by OBC Transeuropa for the European Data Journalism Network (EDJNet). Eight journalism organizations-members of the EDJNet contributed to the project, including iMEdD: OBC Transeuropa, BiQdata/Gazeta Wyborcza, Denik Referendum, Divergente, El Orden Mundial, EUrologus/HVG, iMEdD, Voxeurop.\n\nNavigate the web application, designed and developed by Sheldon.Studio, and find out who are the people of honour in the streets of Europe.\n\nMapping Diversity is a project coordinated by OBC Transeuropa for the European Data Journalism Network (EDJNet), first published in March 2023. A pilot project on Italy was published in 2021.\n\nConcept and editorial coordination: Giorgio Comai, Lorenzo Ferrari\n\nData collection and analysis: Giorgio Comai, Ornaldo Gjergji, Alice Corona\n\nDesign and development: Sheldon.studio\n\nHomepage data storytelling: Alice Corona\n\nThe following journalism organizations-members of the EDJNet contributed to the project: OBC Transeuropa, BiQdata/Gazeta Wyborcza, Denik Referendum, Divergente, El Orden Mundial, EUrologus/HVG, iMEdD, Voxeurop.\n\nStreet names and geographic data: © OpenStreetMap, released under ODbL; © EuroGeographics for the administrative boundaries.
