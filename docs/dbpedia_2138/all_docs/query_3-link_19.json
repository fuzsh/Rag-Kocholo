Unravelling the analogy is simple. Hitler is the actor, an evil actor but still a great one; the German people are the naïve, unwitting, but oh so willing, audience. That does not necessarily mean that Hitler, wherever he went, whatever he did, was doing nothing more than playing a part. His ideas and ideologies cannot be defended or excused. They were the driving force behind his actions; there can be no doubt about that. How those ideas were passed on to a waiting public is another matter altogether. Hitler’s control over the massed audiences, either in an auditorium or, later, around the family wireless sets which he and Joseph Goebbels had enabled almost every family in Germany to purchase, was strikingly effective. It was exactly like a skilled and politically minded Laurence Olivier, Henry Irving or even Shakespeare himself guiding, manipulating and forcing their audiences to believe every word that was uttered. Only a superb actor could have delivered his lines so perfectly and measured his success so efficiently. For a wide range of reasons, not least his ability to act out a part and play the character that they all wanted to see, Hitler’s control over his devotees was vast. That was particularly so with the women who flocked in their thousands to hear him speak or just to watch as he drove past in his open-topped Mercedes. The women of Germany loved him, hung onto his every word and he responded by making them seem special. Not to put too fine a point on it, the women of Germany were Hitler’s lovers, as he was theirs. He could not make personal contact with all of them but that simply made the relationship between them so much more special. And it made him so much more desirable: vi\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 6\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\nMany saw him as a super-god and his public appearances were marked by thousands of often swooning women hysterically screaming his name in what was close to sexual fantasy … Newsreels of the day showed footage of pretty young blonde women waving frantically as he passed by, their faces contorted with passion.1 The role of women in Hitler’s Germany has been discussed before. They were a crucial factor in his success and, arguably, in his failure when the bombs came crashing down onto their homes and dreams. But what has been only rarely examined are the lives and impact of the women who were close to Hitler, women who may have influenced his character, and thus his decisions, from the moment of his birth to his death in Berlin in 1945. Adolf Hitler used his women. He used them as a sounding board, as emotional support, as red-blooded heroines and, in particular, as Teutonic images of old. In the most part they came willingly under his spell, giving their love and infatuation, their help and support, with only one expectation: that he would make Germany great again. A man of many parts, Hitler wove a magical spell around his women and that includes – almost to the very end – those millions of adoring women across Germany who would never meet him but still revered and loved him. But it is particularly relevant for those closest to him. For a man supposedly so pledged, so dedicated to his country and to his mission, it is surprising to realize that there were actually dozens of women with whom he had intense emotional contact and relationships. Many of these relationships were kept hidden. Even Eva Braun remained an unknown figure until the final weeks of Hitler’s life. Not all of Hitler’s relationships involved sexual activity. Some of those relationships were with women who were clearly mother figures, either real or surrogate; some were simply platonic; others were not real women at all but were flitting, insubstantial creatures that clung like butterflies to the edges of his life and were little more than idealized visions from his dreams. Whatever the basis of Hitler’s relationships with women, there was always an edge of eroticism to his contact. It may never have been realized or acted upon but it was always there, powering his behaviour – sometimes flirtatious, sometimes dominant and sometimes submissive – in almost all of his interventions with women. vii\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 7\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nHITLER AND HIS WOMEN\n\nHowever, for a large number of Hitler’s women, from the higherprofile adherents to the dozens of nameless brief encounters who have now faded into history, contact did indeed start and finish in a sexual encounter. Brief or extended, bizarre or natural, affairs of the flesh mattered to Adolf Hitler – affairs, that is, in the widest possible context. Hitler was a complex man, difficult to read and understand. Even with those to whom he did not actually ‘make love’, there was, for both parties, the fascinating concept of being ‘in love’. Eroticism without romance or sex. Once you realize the breadth and depth of Hitler’s dreams and desires, it is hard to imagine or re-imagine the traditional view of a cold, distant demagogue working alone, without female support or comfort. If nothing else this book will try to show just how much Hitler needed and obtained that comfort. To that extent he was an ordinary man with ordinary wishes and plans. Except that he wasn’t ordinary at all. As we all know he was filled with an evil that remains, even now, hard to quantify. But putting the two elements of his character together is what makes the man so fascinating. As Dale Robertson used to say at the end of almost every episode of the 1950s Wells Fargo TV series: ‘There’s a little bad in the best of us, a little good in the worst.’ Adolf Hitler never witnessed the arrival of television but he was an enormous fan of America’s Wild West and an inveterate reader of Karl May’s lurid cowboy books. He might well have agreed with Robertson’s comment.\n\nviii\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 8\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nChapter 1\n\nPopular Opinion: Myth and Truth\n\nTry this as an experiment. Stop any passer-by, any man or woman you might encounter in the street or at the bar of your local public house, and ask them for their opinion of Adolf Hitler. The vast majority of those questioned will stare at you as if you had just uttered a piece of blasphemy or a particularly unpleasant and foul word. They will then probably all agree that Hitler was one of the most sinister and evil men who ever lived. From the inception of the Nazi Party in the early 1920s until its demise in 1945, Hitler’s warped, twisted and malformed mind spawned a regime that murdered millions and terrified the whole world. He took many of his early ideas from the man he regarded as his mentor, an alcoholic right-wing theorist who lived in and around the Munich area. Dietrich Eckart was a poet and writer whose fanciful ideas and theories held great appeal for Hitler but the culminations of his plans – the death squads, the concentration camps and the gas chambers – were his and his alone. In the years immediately after 1945, following his suicide in the besieged and battered city of Berlin, Hitler’s influence remained significant. Even now, from well beyond the grave he continues to haunt and cast his malign influence across the globe. It seems that Hitler’s evil knew no bounds. Apart from ruthless military campaigns in places like Poland and Greece, the rabid desire for lebensraum in the East, vicious race laws across Germany and newly conquered German-held territory, Hitler and his Nazi Party perpetrated a series of pogroms and massacres that have remained unequalled in the history of the world. Inventing murder on an industrial scale, his name has become a byword for the cold and calculated extermination of millions of helpless and hapless groups of people. Thousands of books have been written condemning Hitler and his actions while hundreds of films and documentaries have also 1\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 1\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nHITLER AND HIS WOMEN\n\nbeen produced. There have been others, perhaps not quite as many as the anti-Hitler variety but still a significant number, which have attempted to explain away the killings and the brutality, even to deny them altogether. In its own way the denial of the Holocaust has always been a concept as evil and diabolical as anything that came out of the Third Reich. Beyond the arguments and the debates, the sheer horror of Hitler’s Holocaust remains as a programme of carefully devised and organized murder that can be glibly called man’s inhumanity to man. In whichever way they are looked at and whatever they are used for, the tragic groups of innocent men, women and children who went, largely unknowing, to the gas chambers, are a wide-ranging and eclectic selection of would-be victims. Jews, gypsies, Slavs, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Quakers and communists were the primary targets of the Holocaust. They were not alone. Physically, mentally and emotionally disabled people were also caught in the crosshairs of the Nazis’ all-seeing scrutiny. So, too, were intellectuals, homosexuals and even members of Hitler’s own Party. The list of his victims seems at times to be endless. At the risk of being considered fey or overly poetic, it does not stretch the imagination too much to conjure harrowing visions of Hitler’s countless dead and persecuted. They range and reach far into the distance ahead of you like a faintly perceived but always remembered regiment of ghost figures. It is a fanciful and effete response, perhaps, but that is what such horror leads to in many thinking and imaginative individuals. On a more prosaic level, what Hitler’s use of terror meant to anyone who was opposed to the Nazi view of the world was a lengthy period of unmitigated horror. It was a time of such fear that it is now difficult to imagine how people felt. Trying to capture that fear is, frankly, beyond most of us. Once in power Hitler’s fury knew no bounds. Critics of the Nazi regime and members of the sects designated for destruction might all expect, sooner or later, to hear the terrifying midnight knock on their door or wake to an early morning raid by Gestapo* and SS** officers. Persecution, punishment, torture and, ultimately, death were the inevitable result for anyone who dared to voice a counter opinion or represent opposition and disagreement to the Nazis. * Geheime Staatspolizei, the Nazi secret police. ** Schutzstaffel, lit. Protection Squadron, the major Nazi paramilitary, latterly military, organization.\n\n2\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 2\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nPopular Opinion: Myth and Truth\n\nThe classic or standard image of Hitler, one that most people can recognize and possibly even relate to, comes from the 1930s. It is that of the dictator in his brown SA* uniform, designed for the stormtroopers by Party member Hugo Boss, standing in front of adoring thousands at one of the many Nuremberg rallies or election meetings. He is hurling invective, ranting and screaming himself into near-apoplexy. Metaphorically at least, the tyrannical Hitler holds the admiring host in the palm of his hand. Thousands stare at him, unblinking, unthinking but all of them in raptures and totally accepting what he says. They are mesmerized, in thrall to his words and vision of the world. No matter how many times he repeats his promises and condemns all the many enemies of the Third Reich – both of which he does over and over again, at the expense of almost any explanation or rationalization – the crowds worship and scream back their acceptance. Under the leadership of a man like this almost anything is possible. And that is exactly what Hitler is offering: ‘almost anything’. Nobody seems to know, least of all him, how he will obtain these misty, ill-defined utopian ideals for his people. That is part of the Hitler mystique. He seems to be saying that if you follow him and listen to him, if you agree with his ideas and join him, then the whole world will be open to you. But the questions have to be asked: what are those ideas, what are the ideals he is propagating? For the non-partisan observer the ideals of the 1930s Party meetings and rallies would always remain unclear. Apart from a few lofty targets such as an end to unemployment, Germany restored to power and wealth, the ultimate realization of Aryan destiny, the ideals are little more than sketchily drawn outlines, like a child’s view of the world. The audience can fill in the blanks with almost anything they might like to dream about. ‘Almost anything’ soon becomes ‘Almost everything’. That is really what Hitler seems to be offering when he stands before his public to make his promises, almost anything they want. It is not the reality of the dream but the offer itself, made with such certainty and such violent aplomb that matters to the worshipping crowds. Hitler screams and gesticulates, he sways and moves from side to side on the podium. His hands weave magical shapes in the air. Spittle flies from his lips and his eyes glisten with an appeal that everyone, even those hundreds of yards away at the back of the stadium, swear they * Sturmabteilung, or Storm Detachment, the initial Nazi Party paramilitaries.\n\n3\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 3\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nHITLER AND HIS WOMEN\n\ncan see. To those not of the faith he seems a madman; to those who believe and trust in each word he utters he is nothing short of a messiah. The one thing that no one can doubt, not his supporters, not his opponents and certainly not the representatives of foreign governments who look on in shock and horror, is that this man knows how to work a crowd. He can control them, whip them into fury and, when needed, quieten them into a menacing, sibilant hush. It is a skill practised by many but only truly gained by very few. From a faltering and stuttering start his diatribe gathers momentum. It is slowly and carefully done, even though very few in the auditorium realize it. The pattern is always the same, a gradual move from uncertainty to confidence and ultimately to a level of command that somehow manages to mirror Hitler’s view of his mission. The climax is always spectacular and eventually the crowds are treated to the howls of manic rhetoric that he famously spews out, wherever and however his speech is given. Hitler runs the crowd through every imaginable emotional gamut and they are like putty in his hands. Now, in hindsight, it is impossible not to view the performance as a public version of the sexual act, a slow and gradual build up to a cataclysmic and orgasmic climax, both for him and for the worshipping thousands. At the end both Hitler and his audience are fulfilled. The word ‘audience’ is used deliberately for Hitler is the player, the actor on stage. The crowd who applaud and scream are the equivalent of the spectators in an Elizabethan theatre. Like the sixteenth-century playgoers, the groundlings who packed into the Globe, the Curtain and other theatres of London, they demand a quality performance. The subject and the content remain, very clearly, only secondary factors. And eventually they are sated. They have been reduced to sweat-soaked, exhausted, brain-washed zombies who at that moment really believe that he and they can take over and control the whole world. That is what most observers see. Yet there is another side to Adolf Hitler, a softer, calmer and more normal side, if that word ‘normal’ can ever be used in regard to such an individual. It is a private side of his personality, one that he keeps carefully hidden from the world. It concerns not warfare, not German expansion and not even anti-Semitic promises of retribution. Where it is displayed and seen at its best is simply in his attitude towards women. 4\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 4\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nPopular Opinion: Myth and Truth\n\nIt is a surprising, even startling attribute but there is no doubt that once in the company of women Hitler changes and becomes a more laid-back character altogether. Almost unbelievably he becomes compassionate, caring and agreeable. Unknown to most people, he has a keen and infectious sense of humour, usually withheld from public scrutiny until he is relaxed and surrounded by women whose company he enjoys and in the face of whom he does not feel threatened or abused. Then he flirts and smiles, charms the company with his wit and knowledge. He is a skilled mimic and raconteur and he now becomes a man with whom it is a pleasure to sit, talk and spend a couple of agreeable hours. Time and the events of history have fixed our perceptions of Hitler, the Nazis and the whole of the Third Reich. What that means is that it is now difficult to imagine him as anything other than the ranting demagogue shown in the plethora of television documentaries and films to which we are regularly subjected. But as far as many German women of the inter-war years were concerned, this evil killer of millions was a somewhat different person altogether. They understood that when policy and the safe governance of the country demanded it, he might have to be ruthless, to be stern and even brutal. That was acceptable, that was how it had to be. But even those who had never been nearer to him than across the cavernous spaces of the Nuremberg stadium or the sawdust-covered floor of a Munich beerhall knew, truly knew, that he also had a softer side. Apart from acceptance by his women it was an affection – an affectation almost – that was noted by very few. It is unlikely that this propensity for female company and the change in character that accompanied it was ever considered important by his acolytes and the myrmidons whose primary concern was for their own position and advancement. If it was noticed it was soon pushed away, relegated to the depths of individual memory. Hitler’s staunchest allies, both within and without Party circles, saw only what they wanted to see in the man who had given them, and would continue to give them, immense power and position. Their vested interests would not allow them to take any other view. However, for those who had no interest in climbing the Party ladder to the top, men like Hitler’s personal pilot Hans Baur who was content with his position, the attraction of the Führer to what was then still 5\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 5\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nHITLER AND HIS WOMEN\n\ntermed ‘the weaker sex’ was obvious. Baur recorded one instance during a trip to Weimar: Whilst we were out Hitler turned round to Sauckel, who was walking behind us with a group of other Party leaders. ‘See that we have some female companionship at table tonight, Sauckel. All day long I’m surrounded by men, and I’d like to hear women’s voices for a change.’1 Sauckel happily obliged and dinner that night was taken in the company of a large and willing posse of enchanted young women. Such contact between the Leader, the Führer as he became universally known after 1934, and his worshipping female supporters was distant, ephemeral almost, and was limited to nothing more than his appreciation of the sound of those ‘women’s voices’. Hitler knew that the press and the authorities would pounce eagerly on any dalliance he might enjoy and that while his order would lead to the arrival of twenty or thirty young girls, his words to Fritz Sauckel, as recorded by Baur, did at least reveal that he had an enjoyment in the attention and presence of women. That enjoyment was a two-way process but, as far as Hitler was concerned, it was always short-lived. Invariably, after two or three hours, Hitler’s interest faded or passed away. He was not bored, exactly, but he had a mind that was impossible to pin down to one reality. He had something of a ‘butterfly brain’ as it might be described. Internally, after a few hours his imagination was already wandering onto other issues and the company would be relegated to the back of his mind. Then he would slip away, sometimes offering warm goodbyes, and sometimes just exiting the room before anyone noticed. However he departed, he would leave behind an enchanted group of what might now be regarded and labelled as an early example of totally smitten ‘groupies’. He would have called them soft-headed female adherents. There is an interesting question that has to be asked. Did the feelings and reactions of Hitler’s female acquaintances, of his women friends and daily companions, have any effect on his plans and policies? The answer is, in most cases at least, probably not. The women like Sauckel’s ‘rent a crowd’ who gathered around him, happy just to be in his company, were like ships that pass in the night. They would remember the contact with the Führer; he would not. 6\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 6\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nPopular Opinion: Myth and Truth\n\nWith his long-term female friends things might have been very different. For many years people did not believe that this group of friends ever existed. Yet despite the generally perceived and widely held view of a man standing alone, married only to his country and dedicated to his mission, Hitler did actually have many intense relationships with women. Those who fell into this category could have influenced, if not his plans and policies then certainly his personal makeup and characteristics – in other words, his personality. And that personality would, of course, be essential in helping him to take decisions. The complexities of Hitler’s personality were tortuous in the extreme but, if it is not stating the obvious that what he did, what he achieved, where he succeeded and where he failed, can be related directly to his inner beliefs and feelings – not a quality that can always be attributed to every politician or statesman, either then or now. Significant developments in his character can, at least in the early stages of his life, be linked to the women he encountered, the women he loved, used and abused. Not every one of them, of course, would leave such a rich trail of influence. A great deal would depend on the woman’s own individual and collective character and personality. Analysis is not easy. It must be remembered that for all of his political life Hitler remained the consummate actor, a man who could jump from one role to another with barely a pause for breath. This man who might be a ranting, obsessive tyrant one minute could be a caring, compassionate and supportive father figure the next. His range was wide and each part was totally believable. How, then, can he be assessed? The answer is with difficulty and no small degree of surmise. The interested reader or student is often tempted to invoke the old variety-show comment, ‘Will the real Adolf Hitler please stand up.’ Even then, the man who stood for identification would depend on the audience and the purpose behind both the question and the likely answer. One thing is clear, however: Adolf Hitler was fascinated by women; that is a recorded fact. He liked to have them around him and found great pleasure in their company. If nothing else they provided him with a relaxing, rejuvenating environment. An hour or two in the trenches, at the battle front or, in his case, scheming on the murder of millions, followed by an evening of tea and cakes and mindless chitchat, made Adolf Hitler’s day complete. 7\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 7\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nHITLER AND HIS WOMEN\n\nThat was with his women. They were a special part of his life and therefore received special treatment, even the distant ones. But with his male colleagues the evening sessions usually went on late into the night and slid into an inevitable series of harangues from the Führer. With his women Hitler was often quite prepared to let them do the talking. All of this might be a shallow way of looking at Hitler’s relationships with women but he undoubtedly compartmentalized his various interactions with the women who listened to him and adored him. All of them had their place. Their task was defined by the man himself, sometimes subliminally, often directly. The women and his relationships with them can be divided into three distinct groups which, generally speaking, were self-reliant and totally separate from the others. Firstly, there was the great mass of women who looked on and admired from a distance. A few, like the selection from Weimar, as arranged by Sauckel and recorded by Baur, might be lucky enough to meet him, to come within the remit of his strange but compelling personality. Their moment in the limelight was short and they invariably retired to worship and admire from a distance. Then there were those within arm’s reach, women who might be called on to give comfort and comment to their Führer. They were the secretaries, cooks, pilots, domestics, actresses and photographers who played an occasional but definitive role in the life and career of Adolf Hitler. Members of this group would be permitted revealing insights into the character of the man and, occasionally, would even be allowed to make their views known. However, it did not do to make comments that were too ideologically opposed to Hitler’s views as his secretary Christa Schroeder discovered in 1942 when she took him to task over the issue of supplying cigarettes and tobacco to the troops then fighting in Russia: He rose quickly and took his leave ‘ice cold’ and with an aggrieved expression, from which I finally saw what I had done. Next afternoon when I enquired of the manservant in what mood the boss found himself today, Hans Junge gave us a long look and told us that tea would be taken today without the ladies.2 8\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 8\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nPopular Opinion: Myth and Truth\n\nHitler sulked with Christa Schroeder for several months, still using her secretarial services but treating her with cold reserve. Despite apologizing and accepting the entire fault for upsetting him, Christa Schroeder was never treated with quite the same intimacy again. She was accepted back into the fold but the young Traudl Junge, who had joined Hitler’s staff not long after the outbreak of war, seemed to be granted many of the favours that had previously gone to Christa. The final group, last but certainly not the least important, was the small number of women who were intimate with him. Intimate did not always mean there was a sexual relationship but these were women who shared his triumphs and disasters in public and in private. It was, often, something of a poisoned chalice. Three members of this group – five if you include Eva Braun and Magda Goebbels – committed suicide; such was the pressure, stress and mystique of being involved in any form of intimate relationship with Adolf Hitler. Most of the women who became close to Hitler were physically attractive. He admired all sorts of beauty, provided it fitted with his particular choice or vision. In verse, in music, in art and in women his tastes were unchanging and remained with him to the end of his life. The women he admired most were either very young or considerably older than him. Young and old, both types were unthreatening. Both were generally supportive, but ultimately it all depended on the use to which they were likely to be put. Whatever the relationship there was always an agenda as far as Hitler was concerned. In Mein Kampf he wrote about the role and position of women, using this seminal document to make clear – as it did in so many other points of intent – exactly where he stood with regard to women and what he believed: They feel little shame at being terrorized intellectually and they are scarcely conscious of the fact that that their freedom as human beings is impudently abused … They see only the ruthless force and brutality of the determined utterances, to which they always submit.3 He was later to comment, scathingly but privately, that women did not know how and when to keep their mouths shut. Always worried about the rumour machine and its consequences it was one more of the reasons 9\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 9\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nHITLER AND HIS WOMEN\n\nthat passing affairs and ‘one-night stands’ were out of the question. He once described the masses, those thousands of German men, women, boys and girls who hung on his every word, as feminine in their makeup – stupid and easily influenced. And this from the man who liked women and enjoyed being in their company. Hitler may have had a poor opinion about the abilities of women in general but it did not stop him liking them. Liking and trusting were two vastly different issues. He would hardly have given any of them command of the armies on the Eastern Front. However, command of his kitchens, control over his reports and documents, the management of his various residences across Germany, these were gifts that he certainly did bestow, more than happily, on the women in his life. The cynic might argue that these were not really important responsibilities but to Hitler they were. He knew only too well that the basic levels of existence, the physiological levels such as the need for warmth, comfort, food and so on, had to be filled or played out. Otherwise the human being, as an entity and a thinking person, would not work; and you only have to look at the concentration camp regimes to see the truth of that statement. Apart from that his stance was simple. A woman’s time should revolve around the three Ks: Kinder, Küche and Kirche (children, kitchen and church), their chief purpose being to provide and rear increasing numbers of perfect Aryan children to fight in the wars that would ensure the safety and continuation of the regime and the country. It was a sexist, self-interested approach but it was not untypical of German and other cultures at this time. It has been estimated that approximately 50 per cent of the Nazi electoral vote came from women, a statement that is supported by the fact that from the beginning of the movement there had always been a large proportion of women at the Party meetings and rallies. The reason for this support remains unclear although the sexual element cannot be ignored. Many of those who watched and listened to him speak would have gone away with their minds full of fantasies and impossible dreams. Hans Baur attempted, on several occasions, to speak to these supporters to find out what they really thought about Hitler: I talked to the girl who was sitting beside me. She was 22 and very attractive but she told me that she was afraid 10\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 10\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nPopular Opinion: Myth and Truth\n\nshe would never get married because when she compared all the men she had ever met with Hitler, they were so far inferior to him that none could possibly satisfy her.4 The young women who hung on the Führer’s every word, as Baur discovered, were fanatical, some even hysterical in their admiration for Hitler. It was certainly not his looks that aroused them. His physical appearance was always secondary to what he believed even though he came to appreciate the value of strong, upright bodies and smart, dazzling clothing. It was an appreciation that reached its zenith with Hugo Boss’s black SS uniforms. Even then it is interesting to note that Hitler never donned the SS uniform himself, as he had done, and continued to do, with the SA Brownshirts. Once he became Chancellor, he realized that he needed a ‘makeover’ and many of his more unappealing traits and looks were dropped. During his rise to power, however, he was anything but the upright example of German manhood that he so relished and adored. Despite his piercing blue eyes – hypnotic blue eyes as they were sometimes called – Hitler cut, at first glance, an unprepossessing figure. He was below average height, slight rather than slim, with dirty finger nails and discoloured teeth. His tiny toothbrush of a moustache and the jet-black lick of hair combed across his forehead gave him a comedic rather than commanding appearance – more Chaplin than Cromwell. Perfect looks are never guaranteed to bring a perfect response and most observers were soon to admit that they had got it wrong. But as one American writer commented after meeting Hitler for the first time: He is formless, almost faceless, a man whose countenance is a caricature, a man whose framework seems cartilaginous … He is inconsequent and voluble, ill poised and insecure. He is the very prototype of the little man.5 Hitler might have been many things but he was never a ‘little man’. Such views rarely lasted beyond first meeting. Once unleashed, the quality of his voice and the display of raw power that emanated from him, along with the additional factor of hysteria in the audience, could well have helped create the magnetic, charismatic figure that he became. There is a modern comparison that might be useful to look at. In the 1960s, 11\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 11\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nHITLER AND HIS WOMEN\n\nalmost any concert or performance by popular beat groups like the Beatles or the Rolling Stones was accompanied by the advent of a new phenomenon: wet underwear left under the seats of the screaming fans when the concert was over. Mass hysteria had supplanted individual delicacies. Sudden incontinency and pre-orgasmic discharge were not the only issue for the over-enthusiastic girls and some fans even attempted to throw themselves from balconies or other high points when they discovered that they could not get close enough to their idols. Hitler’s adoring female audience might not have screamed in bladder-draining delight or tried to throw themselves from the top of the Brandenburg Gate whenever he stood up to address the crowd, but large numbers of them did scream his name when he appeared while some did indeed faint or swoon and some even charged the stage. The majority were content to stay in their places and keep their sexual fantasies to themselves. This was a different age, circumstances were vastly dissimilar and, above all, Hitler’s intention was not to entertain but to educate and convert. It is therefore hard to know if his appearance had the same effect on his female fan base as Paul McCartney or Mick Jagger. However, if Hans Baur was right about the adulation for the Führer bordering on hysteria, then some form of sexual arousal in those who sat and watched is not only possible but highly likely. Hitler had only a passing or peripheral interest in the women who gazed at him with such adulation. They were, in the main, beyond his reach just as any further contact with them was beyond his inclination. That was no accident. That was how he wanted it, that was how it was arranged. His public image and persona were far more important to him than any brief physical exchanges in a hotel bedroom or on the back seat of his Mercedes. He enjoyed the company of the panting, goggle-eyed women for a short time, enjoyed enchanting and bewitching them and to that extent his interest was little more than an extension of his political programme. Just as Jagger, McCartney and the rest were intent on selling records, so Adolf Hitler was concerned with selling his Party. His aim was to gain help in implementing his radical policies and advancing Aryan supremacy. Most times he succeeded quite easily. It remains difficult to judge Hitler’s real effect on the adoring fans once you take away the matter of mass hysteria. Most photographic 12\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 12\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nPopular Opinion: Myth and Truth\n\nrecords of the time were carefully controlled propaganda pieces and the roving cameras of Leni Riefenstahl, Heinrich Hoffmann and others were careful to pick up only the attractive, mesmerized faces of adoring women – mostly young adoring women. Nevertheless, written records do seem to support the visual ones. According to those who watched, as partisan supporters or as opponents, Hitler was worshipped and much of that adoration seemed to come from women. He, of course, took it all in his stride. Ultimately, the adulation of the women he met and charmed did little more than stroke his ego. It would have been hard for it to have done anything less and must be seen as a more private version of the acclaim he received from the large-scale gatherings like the Nuremberg rallies. If the rallies nourished him and kept him going in times of stress, the more private meetings with women who clearly adored him soothed his metaphorical brow and reinforced his opinion about himself. * For many years there was speculation about Hitler’s sexuality. That speculation continues to this day and some of the allegations are, to say the least, bizarre. The novelist Martin Amis has recently alleged that Hitler did enjoy the sexual act but, due to a hygiene fetish, preferred sex with his clothes on and disliked getting his underclothes messy.6 While we do know that Hitler sometimes changed his underpants three or four times a day, it must be remembered that Amis was writing and talking as a creator of fiction which, although it may have been informed by research, was ultimately made up or invented for the purpose of audience entertainment. At the other end of the spectrum even before the Second World War ended psychoanalyst Walter C. Langer prepared a report for the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS), claiming that Hitler was an impotent coprophile.* He also alleged that Hitler had feminine traits and might have been homosexual. With or without any clear evidence, many other writers have decided that he was totally impotent, some believing that he was a voyeur and an inveterate masturbator. The claim that his right testicle was undescended * Coprophilia: enjoyment and sexual pleasure gained from the sight and feel of human faeces.\n\n13\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 13\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nHITLER AND HIS WOMEN\n\nnot only gave rise to a ribald song but provided the base for many of the allegations about sexual inadequacy. The medical examination he was given following the Beer Hall Putsch and his arrest in 1923 confirmed that Hitler did in fact have only ‘one ball’, as the song goes. There was also the rumour that he was suffering from penile hypospadias – an extremely small penis which forced him to urinate from a hole at the base of the shaft rather than from the tip. The allegations go on and on, wide ranging and constant. If they are only half true then many of the other stories or legends about Hitler’s hidden life – his love affairs with Geli Raubal and Eva Braun, for example – cannot possibly have any veracity. Hard factual proof is not available and you are left with the old adage: ‘You pays your money and you takes your choice.’ Even so the accusations remain. Sometimes, you feel, they will never go away. While the most damaging of these accusations has been that of coprophilia, the most persistent has been that Hitler was a homosexual. Either practising or latent, the charge of homosexuality has been an accusation that Hitler, alive or dead, has been unable to dislodge. There has been much speculation but no evidence for this although many would say that, with regard to the accusation of homosexuality, his enjoyment of women’s company could well be a nod in the right direction. It is, at best, a dubious and somewhat fragile connection. Many of his adult friends and colleagues, men like SA leader Ernst Röhm, long-term supporter Rudolf Hess and bodyguard Ulrich Graf, were either homosexual or had gay tendencies. It was not something either Hitler or his supporters ever chose to hide. That does not automatically place Hitler in the same section of society but for a long while homosexuality was rife, and tolerated, in Nazi organizations like the SA. The intense fury with which homosexuals were later persecuted in the Third Reich – over 50,000 eventually being sent to the concentration camps before the regime finally fell – might possibly reflect a reaction and a degree of political necessity by Hitler and his cronies. Rudolf Hess, who was nicknamed Fraulein Anna and Black Emma by other Nazis, was alleged to have had an affair with Hitler whilst they were together in Landsberg prison. His devotion to Hitler was certainly all-encompassing but that does not prove that he and his adored Führer were lovers in the physical sense of the word. 14\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 14\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nPopular Opinion: Myth and Truth\n\nAt the same time, the perverted nature of Hitler’s alleged coprophilia and sexual encounters with his niece Geli and possibly with one or two others were lurid enough to remain in everyone’s memory. Party members and comrades like Ernst Röhm were even confident enough to refer to the practice, albeit in a somewhat guarded and oblique way, in Hitler’s presence: He [Hitler] is thinking about the peasant girls. When they stand in the fields and bend down at their work so that you can see their behinds – that’s what he likes, especially when they’ve got big round ones. That’s Hitler’s sex life.7 Hitler apparently remained tight-lipped but silent during Röhm’s tongue-in-cheek tirade! His thoughts have remained unrecorded but, interestingly, it was not long before Ernst Röhm perished during the Night of the Long Knives. Walter Langer, writing from a psychological base, has alleged that the only way Hitler could control his coprophagic tendencies was to remain aloof from deep and meaningful relationships. If so, it could explain why Hitler chose to remain distant from the majority of his female admirers, keeping them at arm’s length in order to prevent intense emotional feelings: ‘As soon as such feelings are aroused, he feels compelled to degrade himself in the eyes of the loved object and eat their dirt figuratively, if not literally.’8 It is all fascinating stuff but there is absolutely no evidence that any of this is true. Like the others, Langer is guessing, albeit making guesses that, as much as anything else, are fuelled by education and professional knowledge. The writer Ian Kershaw is just one of many historians who question the value of the stories. He argues that: Rumours of Hitler’s sexual perversions are … based on dubious evidence. [They are] little more than a combination of rumour, hearsay, surmise and innuendo, often spiced up by Hitler’s political enemies.9 Blackening Hitler’s character, blackening the career and personality of any public figure for that matter, was a common occurrence in the wild and criminal underworld in which Hitler lived and worked. It was 15\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 15\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nHITLER AND HIS WOMEN\n\ncertainly no worse than the articles and stories that were run by the rabidly anti-Semitic Julius Streicher in his paper Der Sturmer or the lies and rumours that Hitler and the Nazis were soon spreading about their Jewish and Communist opponents. In this more enlightened and accepting modern age the obvious response to all of this might be quite simple: so what? But in the 1920s and 1930s homosexuality in particular was still a criminal offence and carried the toxic stain of perversion. Adherents were considered ‘less than men’ and this was a smear that Hitler, both before his rise to power in 1933 and after he had become Chancellor of Germany, could simply not afford to see bandied about too freely. Always a contradictory character, Hitler was both repelled and fascinated by sex. To him the worn-out, degraded prostitutes that he encountered or saw during his time as a down-and-out in Vienna and Munich held no sexual appeal. To him they were merely evidence of the moral decadence of the Austrian and German nations. Whether or not the pimps who matched them with clients and took their money were actually Jewish is a matter of conjecture. However, Hitler certainly believed and alleged that they were, thus adding one more prejudice to his seemingly limitless range of phobias and hatreds. Disliking prostitution did not stop Hitler carefully observing the women of the streets as they went about their work. It was, as he tried to explain, part of his social education. There were rumours of him using prostitutes, even of his being treated for syphilis which he had supposedly caught from one of them, but yet again the accusations remain just rumours. They fascinate readers and students but cannot be proved or disproved. Hitler certainly enjoyed being ‘in the dirt’, figuratively and literally. His period in the doss houses of Vienna and Munich could and should have been much shorter as he had the means and the talent to escape what others would regard as a degrading experience. He could have painted much more than the occasional postcard. There was a ready market for such art but it would have taken a degree of effort that Hitler did not seem to possess or, at best, wish to use. It was only the outbreak of the First World War that forced him out of the malaise into which he had sunk. To the end of his days he looked back, if not fondly then certainly proudly, to his time in the slums of Austria and Germany. 16\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 16\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nPopular Opinion: Myth and Truth\n\nHitler’s time in the doss houses gave him credibility in the eyes of the labouring classes but, more importantly, allowed him to observe others at work and play, in extremis and in moments of success. However, his voyeurism – and there is really no other way to describe it – certainly did not prevent him enjoying the company of what he regarded as a ‘better’ class of women. At such times, when he did allow himself to subside into the soft pool of femininity that he loved so much, his behaviour was both coquettish and flirtatious. He was certainly not above remarking favourably to people like Hans Baur and his chauffeurs Erich Kempka and Emile Maurice on the appearance of young women and girls they chanced to pass in the street. As a child and as an adult Adolf Hitler remained a man of extremes. His rages were so violent that he could easily be reduced to tears by events that others would casually dismiss. He would occasionally throw himself to the floor and foam at the mouth. Almost anything could ignite his rage. In particular if he was crossed or contradicted – a trait that grew worse the longer he was in charge and the closer he came to the end – his eyes would flash and a stream of obscenities would pour forth. Yet once the fury had been unleashed or freed his behaviour might give way to mild and accepting moments of peace and relaxation. It hardly stopped him being a monster of depravity but it did show that there was more than one side to this man of many contradictions. His secretary Christa Schroeder has commented: There was not just one Hitler, but several Hitlers in one person. He was a mixture of lies and truth, of faithfulness and violence, of simplicity and luxury, of kindliness and barbarity, of mysticism and reality, of the artist and the barbarian.10 Some of his behaviour towards women, particularly in the early days, was decidedly odd. He was, for example, quite likely to make sudden and unexpected declarations of love to beautiful women, regardless of their station or position. It was an element of his impetuosity, something that he and many others would regard as part of his charm. It was a deliberate ploy. He was unschooled, just an ordinary working-class lad who had none of the refinements and manners of those brought up in a more privileged environment. And, of course, people loved it. 17\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 17\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nHITLER AND HIS WOMEN\n\nHis friend and early financial supporter Ernst Puzi Hanfstaengl once entered his own sitting room and found Hitler, a regular visitor to the Hanfstaengl home, on his knees, declaring undying passion for Helena, Puzi’s startlingly attractive American wife. Puzi did a double-take but Hitler was not embarrassed to be discovered like this and Helena, who found the whole thing quite amusing, was realistic. Hitler had no interest in her: his love and his lust, she told Puzi, were reserved solely for the task of attaining power. She was correct. Such passions were not real, being little more than the mood of the moment for a young man who was always liable to undergo sudden changes of behaviour. If he ever developed emotional passions for Helena they quickly faded and it was not long before Hitler was professing a similar affection for Puzi’s sister Erna. There was undoubtedly something of the retarded or undeveloped adolescent in Hitler’s sudden attractions and passions. Such moments were invariably hopeless or destined to remain unfulfilled, exactly like his adolescent infatuations back in Austria, exactly like the adolescent infatuations of almost any growing and developing boy. As Helena Hanfstaengl realized only too well, Hitler’s protestations of love and admiration were just shallow statements. They were really little more than the emotional outpourings of a semi-grown man, someone still finding his way around the dangerous and threatening adult world. Hitler’s protestations of love were advances that would lead him and the woman to whom they were addressed absolutely nowhere. Nor were they ever intended to. Helena found it faintly amusing but many others did not. They took him seriously and fell for the line. To some extent it was also the actor in him, that compelling, almost overpowering urge to be centre stage in everything he did. Here again he was playing the part that the situation demanded – or, rather, the part that he felt the situation demanded. All of his life he had little ability to differentiate between what he wanted and what others either needed or wanted. His wishes and desires always came first. As the world was to discover, it was a tragic failing. Both Helena and Erna Hanfstaengl were in positions of social power and were able to help him gain access to people and places that he knew would be important in his rise to the dizzying heights of international diplomacy. Therefore, use them he would. Professing love and admiration for beautiful women like the Hanfstaengls was undoubtedly 18\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 18\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nPopular Opinion: Myth and Truth\n\na case of Hitler operating in the microcosm, making protestations of eternal love or friendship, promises that he would not or could not ever keep. You might easily say he was practising for a performance on the wider world stage. When he moved to the macro environment, promising rejuvenation and the reclamation of Germany’s rightful position in the world, then that was something rather different. That was the moment when Adolf Hitler became considerably more dangerous. Clearly, then, Adolf Hitler liked women. He enjoyed spending time in their company and would laugh and joke with them along with everyone else in the party. But he would also use them and maybe, on occasions, abuse them as well. During the final epoch-ending days of the Reich, as he approached the end of his life, Hitler unashamedly used his female staff in the Bunker and the other places where he hid out in Berlin, turning them into unofficial group therapists. He was under stress and he had nowhere else to turn. His long-time secretary Christa Schroeder was clear about the benefits Hitler gained from quiet, intimate meetings with his staff: Hitler happened to pass the Staircase Room at teatime, saw us sitting there and asked if he might join us. This hour of easy chatter was so much to his liking that he later came to tea almost daily. The Staircase Room was a place where he felt unburdened and I always had the impression that what he said there came from a secret memory box which at all other times he kept locked shut.11 As always it was Hitler’s needs that were dominant, driving the burnedout dictator forward, even as his end approached. His needs demanded these idle moments away from the problems of a dying regime but no one should ever interpret his actions as displays of regret. Hitler regretted nothing he had ever done and remained practical, unrepentant and driven until his final day. There is an obvious and perhaps unfortunate comparison to be made between the women in his life and with, of all things, his favourite dog Blondi. Blondi, a large and powerful German shepherd, was a creature that he adored and would fight to the death to defend and keep safe. 19\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 19\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nHITLER AND HIS WOMEN\n\nHitler seemed to enjoy having his photograph taken but apart from formal studio portraits by Heinrich Hoffmann which were an essential element of his political profile, the best and most revealing are when he is shown posing alongside Blondi. On these occasions he is natural and very much ‘at home’. And yet, at the end of his life, without any hint of regret, Hitler used the animal to test the efficiency and power of the fatal cyanide he would soon give to Eva Braun. The dog was dead within minutes, leaving Hitler unconcerned and a pragmatist to the end. While he enjoyed being in the company of strikingly beautiful women, entertaining them and admiring their good looks, Hitler freely acknowledged that he had a preference for a somewhat different sort of girl. He always distrusted men who failed to admire a woman’s beauty but he was equally as clear that there were some women you admired and others that you held close to you. It was a degree of compartmentalization that did not stop with the women in his life but was a technique that helped him balance so many balls in the air at one time. He had no real deputy to whom he could delegate decisions or actions. Rudolph Hess was a mere cypher, at least until he decided to parachute into Scotland in a ridiculous attempt to end the war. Göring, Himmler and Goebbels were more concerned with advancing their own careers and lining their own pockets than they ever were about the future of Germany. At the end of the day everything in the running of the Third Reich emanated from Adolf Hitler. It is impossible to imagine the regime existing without him just as it is impossible to imagine him on the arm of someone like Marlene Dietrich. In the days before he became Chancellor he and his chauffeur Emile Maurice would drive around the streets of Munich looking for attractive women. Hitler would excitedly point out those he considered beautiful. Sometimes they would stop and Hitler would treat the women to tea but that was as far as it went. Being seen to grow close to a ravishing beauty or to hold a torch for some well-known celebrity would, he felt, cut him off from other women. Whether that was a conscious or sub-conscious decision it was still an important consideration. He needed the great mass of femininity, the German women who so adored him, to support the Nazi Party and, once he had achieved ascendency, to maintain the position of supreme power in Germany. Right or wrong, it was an attitude which meant that while he could enjoy the beauty of others, he could never claim it as his own. 20\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 20\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nPopular Opinion: Myth and Truth\n\nAlways totally sure of his political and military intentions, Hitler was less convinced when it came to personal relations. The fear of rejection was always there, lingering like an impending abscess beneath the surface of the gum. Why bother with the unattainable when his power and position could guarantee him acceptance elsewhere: ‘His personal preference was for a simpler, sweet type of girl. “I would far rather choose some pretty little typist or salesgirl as my partner,” he once commented.’12 He did not elucidate further but it was a revealing attitude that manifested itself in the shape of two women from either end of his life, his mother and his long-time mistress. There was no fear of rejection from a Klara Hitler or an Eva Braun, both of whom were totally committed to him and to his welfare. His mother Klara had, arguably, already sacrificed her life for his sake. Eva, as his mistress and wife, would willingly do so in the years ahead. Hitler accepted such sacrifice as his right. If they loved him as they claimed then the women he most trusted would not stop short at taking the ultimate step and putting their lives at risk, just as he had done with his greatest love of all, Germany. If he was prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice, the unspoken but still omnipresent expectation was that others would do the same. It was an attitude that did not begin and end with his women but remained with him throughout his years of power. At the same time, it was not just great beauty that caused him to take a step backwards. He had always held a hatred for intellectuals, ever since his failure at school and in his unsuccessful attempt to gain entry to further education: ‘These impudent rascals [intellectuals] who always know everything better than anybody else … The intellect has grown autocratic, and has become a disease of life.’13 If intellect, generally, was a problem for him, intellect in women was doubly annoying, terrifying even. Consequently, Hitler particularly disliked getting too close to women of intellect and intelligence and would avoid them if at all possible. Between them, beautiful women and intelligent women offered a threat that he neither wanted nor accepted. Non-challenging partners who would agree with his opinions and accept his dictates were more agreeable all round. Best stick to the little typist or shop assistant. His preference for this type of woman can be seen in the first and last great loves of his life, his mother Klara, and his companion of 21\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 21\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nHITLER AND HIS WOMEN\n\nfourteen years, Eva Braun. The former he had no option but to accept; she was his mother and he was bonded to her in a tie of affection that lasted nearly fifty years after her death but she was, and remained until her death, little more than an Austrian peasant woman with little understanding of the wider world. The second, Eva Braun, was a deliberate choice. To most of the population of Germany she was unknown and was deliberately kept so. Many of those who were aware of her existence, intimate Party officials and staff at the Berghof, failed to see the appeal. Yet she was chosen by the most powerful man in Germany, arguably in Europe, precisely because of her non-threatening and accepting personality. When he died Adolf Hitler had come full circle, from the close and comforting arms of a woman who loved him and nurtured him into life to the close and comforting arms of another woman who also adored him and stood beside him as he left a world and a people he had come to hate. In between the two sets of comforting arms that meant so much to him – even though he did not really know it – he had experienced beauty and passion, power and influence, in women who had helped make him the man he became. Love, if he knew the meaning of the word, had not unduly bothered him and he had unashamedly used the women he encountered. As with so many of the relationships in his life he had taken what he needed from the encounters with little or no concern for the women involved. Arguably the first and last loves of his life were his only true loves; everything else – including possibly his much-lauded affair with Geli Raubal – was mere experience. That at least was emotional commitment of a sort but it was hardly the deep and meaningful commitment that his soul, troubled and troubling as it was, really required. There might well be debate about the extent to which Hitler’s women influenced his policies and actions but there can be no doubt about the affection he felt for them as a gender or about the way that certain of them helped mould and develop his character.\n\n22\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 22\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Loving, Dysfunctional, Dangerous Family: Klara, Angela and Paula\n\nAdolf Hitler was born at 6.30 in the evening of 20 April 1889. His place of birth was the small town of Braunau am Inn, on the frontier between Austria and Germany. Being born on the Austrian side of the divide was an annoying but not disastrous accident for the incipient German dictator. He had little time for the archaic and already tottering AustroHungarian Empire and from an early age had visions of the country of his birth joining with her neighbour to the north and west in a panGermanic state that would control the whole of Europe. The time of his birth, with night beginning to fall, was nothing if not appropriate. Hitler was always a creature of the night, preferring to work through the hours of darkness, rise at mid-morning and stay out of the brittle sunlight of southern Germany. On a more esoteric level he was also a man who brought darkness to the world. It was a darkness so intense and malignant that its like had rarely, if ever, been seen before. Hitler’s birth, at 6.30 in the evening at the beginning of a period of gathering gloom, was somehow fitting – a foreshadowing of the larger and greater darkness yet to come. His father Alois was a customs inspector for the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a big, broad and brutal man who drank heavily and was not averse to using his fists on his wife and children. He had trained first as a cobbler and then served for a time as an NCO in the Austrian army, something that was useful in helping to progress his career with the customs service. It did nothing, however, to make his personality gentle or accommodating. Alois was illegitimate and originally known by his mother’s name Shicklgruber. Despite considerable searching, the father of Alois – Hitler’s paternal grandfather – remains unknown. It is a fact that has led to various speculations including the spurious and unfounded rumour that this missing grandfather might actually be Jewish. 23\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 23\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nHITLER AND HIS WOMEN\n\nAlois was legitimized in 1876 when his mother married Georg Hiedler, a miller’s assistant from the Waldviertel region of Austria, and thereafter went by the name of Hitler. Alois was married three times, his third wife Klara Poelzl being the mother of Adolf Hitler. Twenty-three years younger than her husband, Klara was of peasant stock but spent most of her early working life as a domestic cleaner and servant. She was an accepting, pious woman and a loving mother to her children, in particular the young Adolf, as well as Alois Junior and Angela, the children of her husband by his second wife. Klara was originally employed as a servant in the Hitler household, often being regarded and reported as a foster daughter to Alois. With Alois’s second wife already unwell and, as it transpired, terminally ill, it was perhaps inevitable that she and her employer/foster father should begin a romantic relationship. When he was free from the shackles of his sickly second wife it was equally as inevitable that Alois should turn to Klara as a readymade mother and housekeeper. Klara was related by blood to her husband. As second cousins their union was forbidden by the Catholic Church and Alois had to make a special appeal for them to marry. Dispensation was given but the fact that they were related may have affected the health and blood stock of the children from the marriage. At least three of them died when in infancy. Out of the six children that Klara bore for Alois only two – Adolf and Paula – survived into adulthood. And Paula, the last of Klara’s children, was reportedly a little simple. Adolf was a sickly child and Klara was terrified that he might, like his siblings, die young. So, she cossetted him and doted on him all her life. Hitler’s half-brother Alois Junior later went on record, telling the world that Klara spoiled the ‘precious’ little boy and that he had been forced to underatke many of the chores that should, by rights, have been Adolf’s. As Alois Junior had been replaced by the newly born child, young Adolf, in the affections of his father, it is unclear just how unbiased a record his views actually were. During his career as a customs officer Alois Hitler was posted to various towns along the Austrian–German border. When Adolf was still little more than a toddler the family moved, first to Passau and then to Linz where the future warlord and dictator spent the formative years of his childhood and adolescence. This bustling border town was where, at least to begin with, Adolf Hitler went to school. The third largest 24\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 24\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nA Loving, Dysfunctional, Dangerous Family\n\ncentre of population in Austria, Linz was well equipped with theatres and concert halls. Sitting astride the River Danube, the town lay only thirty kilometres from the Czech border and was ideally placed to garner influence and interest from German, Austrian and Czech cultures. Alois was already over 50 when Adolf was born, a man set in his ways and unresponsive to new ideas and thoughts. A monarchist and a firm supporter of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Alois was a typical midrange or minor official of the Hapsburg regime. He enjoyed parading in his uniform and was happy with the esteem that greeted him whenever he walked down the street or entered his favourite tavern in the evenings. In 1895 Alois retired to Hafeld where he spent his time drinking in alehouses and keeping bees. By now, however, a gulf had opened up between Alois and Adolf. Alois wanted his son to emulate him and join the customs service: it was a good, solid profession with prospects for a young man who was educated and enthusiastic. Adolf did not know what he wanted to be but he knew that he certainly did not want to join the customs service. As he later wrote, for the first time in his life he was forced into a position of ‘open opposition’. The thought of sitting chained to an office stool, spending his life filling in forms, was abhorrent to him. Perhaps, more importantly, he told his father how he felt and continued to feel. It was honest enough but it was a recipe for disaster. Hitler dabbled with several false starts – he would join the church or perhaps enlist in the military – before, at the age of 12, deciding that he would become an artist. If Adolf Hitler was appalled by the thought of becoming a civil servant, Alois was even more enraged by what he perceived as his son’s flippant, almost feminine desire to draw and paint: ‘Artist? Not as long as I live, never!’ As the son had inherited some of the father’s obstinacy, besides having other qualities of his own, my reply was equally as energetic … At that our struggle became a stalemate. The father would not abandon his ‘Never’ and I became all the more consolidated in my ‘Nevertheless’.1 The resulting series of confrontations were invariably physical, violent clashes that saw the young man beaten on a regular basis. Neither party would back down but after each beating, Klara was there to soothe her 25\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 25\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nHITLER AND HIS WOMEN\n\nboy and bathe his wounds. She tried hard to act as a barrier between the two warring Hitlers, protecting and shielding Adolf, slipping him money to take him out of the house into the sanctuary of the town streets whenever Alois’s temper exploded in fury. The beatings did eventually stop. If Hitler can be believed it came about as a result of reading in his favourite Karl May cowboy book that it was a sign of courage to bear pain stoically, without murmur or complaint: I decided that when he beat me next time, I would make no sound. When it happened – I knew my mother was standing anxiously by the door – I counted every stroke out loud. Mother thought I was mad when I reported to her with a beaming smile, ‘Thirty-two strokes father gave me!’ From that day I never needed to repeat the experiment, for my father never beat me again.2 Hitler by this stage was sure that he had a great destiny, a future that would reward both him and the Germanic peoples. He respected his father and, probably quite naturally, given the ferocity of his outbursts, feared him. But he did not love him. Alois was a hard man to love. Uncommunicative, gruff and brusque, he rarely spoke to Klara, let alone his son. Alois might have shown some initial degree of affection for the infant Adolf but that emotion soon vanished in the face of petulant attitudes from the spoiled – not to say ruined – little boy. Like so many precocious children Adolf Hitler simply did not know when to close his mouth, nod in agreement and stay silent. Far more significant than any early childhood disagreements was the timing of the disputes. The gulf that opened up between father and son became particularly bitter at the onset of young Hitler’s adolescence. Beginning with Adolf ’s reluctance to accept the customs service as a future career, the artistic and even foppish ways adopted by his son at the onset of the adolescent period infuriated Alois Hitler. Alois was not the man to understand and make allowances for emotional and physical changes in the young man. In his opinion Adolf should have been unswerving in the acceptance of his father’s wishes. Klara invariably took the son’s side in any almost argument or dispute, albeit silently and surreptitiously, and this simply made matters worse. 26\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 26\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nA Loving, Dysfunctional, Dangerous Family\n\nIt is difficult to imagine two more diametrically opposed individuals than Alois and Klara Hitler. There must have been love of a sort, yet the antipathy of Alois was so strongly marked that one cannot help but wonder how the two of them were ever attracted to each other. She was sweet and some would say quite pretty, a quiet and conscientious housewife who took pride in her spotless house and hearth. Some reports say that she was a little simple. She was, perhaps, naïve and saw few of the problems that modern observers would identify in her marriage. Alois, the man and the breadwinner, was in charge and it was therefore Alois who dictated the rules of the family. That was how it was, she felt; that was how it would always be. It did not stop her trying to protect Adolf, the love of her life. Alois stood in complete contrast to his wife. He was efficient at his work – although lack of formal education had stalled his career path, something that might have caused him resentment – but, like many state officials, he was very conscious of his position. He expected to be obeyed and saw little use for the social niceties in life. Short-tempered, standing on his dignity whenever there was a dispute, he was a tyrant and a bully. Adolf Hitler was helpless and unable to respond to his father’s brutal behaviour in any way other than maintain a proud and dignified silence, à la Karl May. He was himself the main target for the violence and was not yet strong enough to respond in a similar fashion. On at least one occasion, while still very young, he was beaten senseless by his irate father. He put up with it, enduring the violence with a combination of stubbornness and pride. Only when the violence and the anger were turned against his mother did he become really upset – even if he could not do anything much about it. Despite what might appear as a loveless marriage, Alois and Klara had six children: Gustav, Ida, Otto, Adolf, Edmund and Paula – but, as was so often the case at the end of the nineteenth century – few of them made it to adulthood. In addition, the children from Alois’s previous marriage, Alois Junior and Angela, also helped fill up the house. In complete contrast to his feelings for his father, the young Adolf certainly loved his mother. Like all spoiled children he was sometimes off-hand with her, expecting and getting what he wanted, when he wanted it and how he wanted it. Now, in hindsight, it is easy to see how this annoyed and even infuriated the thwarted Alois who must have sat and 27\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 27\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nHITLER AND HIS WOMEN\n\nfumed at what he perceived as the soft handling of his wayward son. His only consolation was the beer he drank each night in the local tavern. Adolf Hitler was 13 years old when his father suddenly died. Apparently in robust health, his death was a surprise to everyone. A stroke took him painlessly and quickly, thereby eliminating the father figure at the head of the family but also removing the conflict in the Hitler household. Ever afterwards, in the wake of her husband’s tragic death Klara stuck rigidly to the view that she and Alois had had a good marriage. To the end of her life – in public at least – she regretted his passing, believing that the children had suffered emotionally because of his absence from their lives. Whatever she felt for her husband, her love for young Adolf never faltered. She had spoiled him before Alois died but after the bereavement Adolf became her whole world. His care was her guiding principle: she would sacrifice anything to keep her son safe. As a pampered child, Adolf Hitler had resented the attention Klara had to give to her younger children, of whom only Paula survived infancy and childhood. He hated seeing her give help and comfort to a sibling, even though all of the time he knew that her love for him was still there and would, in due course, be focused solely on him once more. It taught him a hugely important lesson, however. The knowledge that Klara’s love would soon, once again, be focused on him alone had not stopped him storming off in temper whenever his desires or plans were thwarted. He learned early in life that rage – or, better still, assumed rage – could be a powerful tactic. The death of Alois in January 1903 might have been hard for Klara but it provided an unexpected opportunity for Adolf. He said nothing, at least not while his mother was still grieving, but soon resolved that the death of his father would relieve him of the great weight that he had been carrying on his shoulders: studying for entry into the civil service. At first Klara saw no alternative. She would stick to the plans Alois had always had for Adolf and, without too much thought on the matter, attempted to encourage the reluctant youngster to continue studying for the civil service examinations. It was, she felt, no more than her duty as a wife and widow to follow the desires of Alois. Adolf, always the stronger willed of the two, had other ideas. The young man kicked and protested and, eventually and as always with Klara, got his way. 28\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 28\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nA Loving, Dysfunctional, Dangerous Family\n\nBetween them Hitler and Klara agreed that he would leave the Realschule in Linz which was preparing him for the civil service and enrol, instead, at another school in Steyr. The curriculum at this second school was reportedly easier and, with less emphasis on the sciences and technology, was better geared for a would-be artist. That suited the embryonic painter and, for a while, it seemed as if Adolf Hitler had cleverly exchanged the rigours of an environment he hated for something far more palatable. Steyr was too far away from home to allow daily travel and Hitler had to lodge in the town during the week. He found accommodation with an official of the local court but, even so, he tried to get back home to Linz – the family had moved there after Alois’s death and where conditions were that much more homely – whenever he could. There have been rumours that Hitler was forced to leave the school in Linz because of some indiscretion with a female student. The claim has never been substantiated and must, therefore, be relegated to the scores of other unproven legends associated with Hitler. Regardless of this, he looked forward to his change of school, viewing it as a new opportunity. Inevitably, there came a harsh meeting of dreams and reality. Formal education held little interest for him and he did no better in this new school than he had done in the old one. It was not long before he was paying scant attention to his studies. He sat in class with his nose buried in the cheap, second-rate cowboy books of Karl May that he kept concealed in his desk. Anything was better than reading the texts that were set for him by his teachers. He did not get on with his teachers, most of whom he regarded as stupid, even moronic. Similarly, he despised the majority of his peers. Pampered and spoiled, he demanded attention and wanted to be regarded as the leader amongst the group rather than earn such dues in a more subliminal manner. His classmates resented and ignored his directions but Hitler failed to see their reaction and refused to back off. Despite his lack of effort, his avowed aim now was to try for a place in the Academy of Fine Art in Vienna. Not for an instant, either in his mind or in his mother’s, was there any thought that the Academy might reject him. He was talented, they both knew, and so he deserved the place that would certainly be offered when the time came. Hitler continued to do badly in school and finally, in 1905, he stopped going altogether. Klara did not raise too many objections and in 29\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 29\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nHITLER AND HIS WOMEN\n\nMein Kampf he cloaked his decision to drop out by claiming a sudden and debilitating illness that seriously affected his lungs. The illness, Hitler later wrote, required rest of at least a year away from school and from any form of serious study: What I had secretly desired for a long time, and persistently fought for, now became a reality. Influenced by my illness, my mother agreed that I should leave the Realschule … Those were happy days which appeared to me almost as a dream.3 Hitler was only too well aware of his mother’s paranoia over his health. He knew exactly how to play her and he did so without compunction. Whether his illness was real or invented, in hindsight for the benefit of his readers, he was determined to leave school. The worry and pain that this caused Klara was never considered – these were his ‘happy days’. It was a technique he was to come back to many times in his career. The idyllic paradise of these post-school years was made up of long dreamy hours in the countryside or idly roaming through the streets of Linz. He was supposed to be preparing his art work, making sketches and working out compositions ready for the entrance exam at the Academy. In reality he did little more than sit in street cafés, swan around and dream. Arguably, without the restrictions of attending and working in school, Hitler became an independent and freedom-loving young man. In particular he was free to study and read whatever he liked. He now began to fully develop the interests that were to consume him in later life – German nationalism, the study of history and a passionate love of music, particularly the symbolic and powerful operas of the German composer Richard Wagner. Shortly after the death of Alois, Klara had sold their house in Hafeld and moved back to Linz where the family took up residence in a small apartment that was cramped but cosy. Linz meant something special, both for her and for her family, and the cramped conditions in the apartment were more than compensated for by the pleasures of the town and the surrounding countryside. Alois Junior had left the family home when he was just 14, not long before his father died. Driven out by the anger and intolerance of 30\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 30\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nA Loving, Dysfunctional, Dangerous Family\n\nAlois Senior, he had begun a wandering and wayward life that took him, amongst other places, to England and to several local prisons where he served time for theft. As far as Adolf Hitler was concerned, it meant one less body in the apartment and one less person to compete for Klara’s attention. There was little money in the Hitler household as Alois’s Austrian government pension was small and barely enabled the family to survive. Hitler did nothing to help ease the strain on Klara and the rest of the family. As he was no longer attending school he could and should have taken a job of some description and brought into the home some much needed cash. That was unthinkable for him. Why should he demean himself by a thing like work? Klara was there to provide whatever was needed. She did so willingly and Hitler’s demands for money – the inevitable demands of a spoiled and over-protected child – were nothing if not constant. Financial restrictions did not worry him and for some time Adolf Hitler was supremely happy. The idle life of dreaming, some might say planning, and living at leisure in a style he could ill afford, suited him perfectly. It was, in many ways, a perfect preparation for the doss house days that were soon to come. Nothing, it seemed, could prick his bubble until, early in 1906, disaster struck. That year Klara Hitler discovered a lump in her breast. At first, convinced that it was nothing serious, she ignored it but soon the pain became intense and in January 1907 she was forced to consult Dr Bloch, a local physician. She was diagnosed with breast cancer. Hitler, who was now spending several weeks at a time in Vienna, supposedly studying art in the galleries and museums but really wallowing in the sub-culture of the Austrian capital, was called home. He was astounded when Dr Bloch informed him that Klara had not only contracted cancer but had left it too late for treatment and that her condition was now terminal. As with any child or young person who is told of the impending death of a loved one, Hitler was distraught. He might have sponged on Klara, abused her love and generosity, but there was no doubting his affection for her. She had become the one constant in his life and the prospect of losing that supportive presence was hardly to be borne. His sisters were of little use to him in this time of trouble; they were as upset as him. The one person who was able to offer support of any 31\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 31\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nHITLER AND HIS WOMEN\n\nkind was the family doctor. Even so, Dr Bloch surprisingly left it to him to tell Klara of his diagnosis. In itself that was a huge emotional blow and it shocked Hitler out of his selfishness, at least for a while. He even took on some of the household chores, caring for Klara and tending to her needs. Dr Bloch continued to make regular visits to do what he could for Klara and the family. He watched the concern and compassion shown by the young Adolf and commented that he had never seen anyone so overcome with grief as Hitler, not just at Klara’s deathbed but in the long and harrowing months leading up to it. In a last attempt at saving Klara’s life, she was persuaded to undergo the horrendous ordeal of a double mastectomy. The operation took place at the Sisters of Mercy Hospital in Linz but it was too little too late as the cancer was already eating into the pleural tissue of her chest. In constant pain, Klara soon required daily injections of morphine to make her comfortable. They did little good. With no health service then available, the treatments had to be paid for and all they managed to achieve was to deplete the meagre financial resources of the family. In October 1907 Klara’s condition deteriorated sharply. Confined to bed, she lay in agony, knowing that it was only a matter of time before the end. On a regular, desperate basis, she was now receiving treatments with iodoform, an early type of chemotherapy. The treatment involved re-opening the mastectomy cuts on her chest and inserting massive wads of gauze that had been soaked in iodoform into the wounds. Cancer treatment was still in its infancy, medical practitioners having neither the skill nor the equipment to offer what was really no more than experimental and ad hoc processes that might or might not work. The use of iodoform was an attempt to burn out the cancer cells, a brutal last-ditch attempt to save Klara’s life and it failed. The treatment was incredibly painful but Klara bore it stoically. Her throat became paralysed, she was unable to swallow and it was obvious to everyone that she was slipping away. She died on 21 December 1907 from the toxic side effects of the iodoform. Adolf Hitler was beside himself with grief. He had never before lost somebody he cared about and such torment ripped at his heart. To experience such emotional pain was a unique emotion for him. Hitler was never to forget his mother and the love she naturally bore and gave to him. In the face of her death a huge pool, a deep well of love, 32\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 32\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nA Loving, Dysfunctional, Dangerous Family\n\naffection and compassion for the woman who had given birth and reared him, began to develop in Hitler. It was a love that never died but only grew in power and complexity over the years. Klara had given her love unreservedly, asking for nothing in return. And now, only now when his mother had gone, was Hitler able to see that. He had taken everything for granted, loving her admittedly, but only rarely allowing her to realize that his love was also strong. Although they had always been close, it is possible that Hitler did not realize quite how much he loved Klara until the diagnosis of terminal cancer. By then, of course, it was too late to do anything more than grieve. It is all too easy for any writer or historian to fall into the trap of becoming an amateur psychologist and conclude that Hitler grew into a disturbed adult because of his upbringing. Discussion on that particular issue comes down to nature or nurture: was Adolf Hitler born bad or was he made bad? You pay your money and take your choice on that one. Many writers have bandied about theories like the Narcissus or Oedipus complexes. However, it is more than likely that young Adolf Hitler was no more disturbed than many teenage boys who have endured a traumatic experience in their lives. Even a statement like that cannot be proved, one way or another. The last laugh on that particular issue remains with Hitler. Nevertheless, he did have all the credentials for those labels that psychologists and social workers love to attach to their clients. On the one side there was a father he feared and possibly hated. On the other was a mother he adored but whose role in the family was that of an oppressed and downtrodden partner of a man who was both brutal and bullying. Losing both parents in quick succession would have caused any adolescent pangs of regret and sorrow. Klara was buried on Christmas Eve in Leonding, her last wish being to rest alongside Alois. It was a painful and emotional ceremony, Hitler standing alone at the grave after everyone else had left the cemetery. Dr Eduard Bloch had taken an unusual but genuine interest in the case and it was entirely appropriate when family members called at his surgery to express their thanks and gratitude: Although his sisters came to Dr Bloch a few days after the funeral and expressed themselves fully, Adolf remained silent. 33\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 33\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nHITLER AND HIS WOMEN\n\nAs the little group left he said, ‘I shall be grateful to you forever’ … The bottom had obviously fallen out of his world.4 In 1934 Hitler honoured his mother’s memory by naming a street in Passau after her. As Chancellor of Germany it was a posthumous gift well within his power to bestow. Probably more significantly, in 1940, with the persecution of the Jews escalating, Hitler gave a personal order allowing the part-Jewish Dr Bloch and his wife to emigrate from Austria to the United States. It was an unusual but significant gift, a form of gratitude to the man who had tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to save his mother. Klara was Hitler’s first love. It was a platonic and all-consuming affection and was arguably the greatest love of his life. Hitler’s childhood and adolescence probably seemed to him to be full of women – women who fawned on him, spoiled him and helped to give him an inflated view of his own skills and abilities. It is perhaps an obvious statement to make but to a large extent the members of his family were the people who helped form and mould his adult personality – and in Hitler’s case those family members were women. Apart from his mother, the other women in the home were his two siblings – his half-sister Angela and full sister Paula. Angela was born in 1883, the second child of Alois Hitler and Franziska Matzelsberger, then Alois’s second wife. Angela’s mother Franziska died the year after her daughter’s birth and Angela and her brother, also confusingly called Alois, were brought up by Klara Poelzl – Klara Hitler as she soon became. Adolf Hitler was born six years after Angela. As often happens with children who suddenly acquire a baby brother or sister, she and her new half-brother were thrown together and became quite close. He always remembered her with affection – indeed, she was the only member of his family, apart from his mother, to be mentioned in Mein Kampf. A beautiful girl, high spirited and full of life, Angela had been strictly supervised by her father who carefully controlled and regulated the boys from the town who were soon calling on his daughter. It was something that she resented more and more the older she became. Despite thinking that her mother overindulged and spoiled Adolf, Angela took a leaf out of Klara’s book and fussed and petted her baby brother who was happy to be mollycoddled in this way. As he 34\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 34\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nA Loving, Dysfunctional, Dangerous Family\n\ngrew from infancy into childhood, the fussing continued. It was, Adolf felt, no more than his due. Paula Hitler was six years younger than Adolf and the youngest surviving child of Alois Hitler. Unlike Angela, she and Hitler did not get on particularly well during their childhood years. They might have been too alike in their characters or, more likely, Adolf resented the sudden appearance of a new baby who demanded the attention that he was sure should have been his and his alone. Whenever he spoke about Paula to his friend August Kubrizek he always referred to her as ‘the kid’, a dismissive but not totally unpleasant description. Given some of his more colourful comments about teachers, politicians and peers, made at around this time, it could have been a lot worse. Despite what was reported as a strong filial affection between them, Adolf and Paula apparently quarrelled regularly during their childhood years. They were constantly bickering with each other, arguments and spats that often ended in blows. Paula later recorded that she could still feel her brother’s slaps across her face. Alois Junior invariably took Paula’s side in the arguments, something that only made the situation worse. Paula and Adolf may well have argued but mostly she was a quiet, passive girl who was easily led by her older brother and half-brother. Hitler undoubtedly had a degree of innate affection for his sisters, Angela in particular, but it was only to a limited degree. He was never overly fond of either of the two girls, at least not in any demonstrative way. He called them ‘stupid geese’ and held a low opinion of their intelligence. But whatever he thought of them, his sisters did provide a solid framework for his childhood, offering comfort and support when Alois was at his most unbearable and violent or when Klara was engaged on other tasks. If he could not get comfort from Klara, Hitler knew that his sisters would provide surrogate affection. Spoiled, fussed over, argued with and battled against – that was Hitler and his youthful relationship with his sisters. And yet, with Klara Hitler always there, always overseeing and indulging, it was a relatively close-knit family. Klara might have received little in the way of affection from her husband but she was always able to pour her emotions into the care and safety of her children. If they could find the time or the inclination, the siblings might just give it back. 35\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 35\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nHITLER AND HIS WOMEN\n\nKlara had lost so many of her children, Gustav and Ida dying in the diphtheria epidemic of 1887/8, Otto perishing within days of his birth and Edmund dying from measles in 1900. Adolf was ‘her pet’ as everyone remembered and Klara was damned if she was going to lose him. Paula, her only other remaining natural child, inevitably suffered in the face of such devotion. The family was effectively welded together by Klara. As a unit it had inevitably begun to disperse as the children reached adulthood but Klara’s death at the end of 1907 – just two years after her husband – finally broke up the family. The offspring of Alois and Klara each quickly went their own separate ways. Alois Junior had gone off to train as a waiter and begun a peripatetic life style that saw him working in England and marrying an Irish girl before finally returning to Germany where he opened a restaurant in Berlin. It apparently became a popular drinking and gathering place for members of the SA. In September 1903, eager to be away from her father’s strict regime, Angela had married Leo Raubal, a tax officer, setting up home not far away from Klara in Linz but out of the immediate reach of her father. Adolf Hitler and Leo Raubal did not get on. He was, after all, a member of that despised clique, a civil servant. Perhaps as a consequence of this, Hitler had limited contact with Angela for several years after her marriage. Leo Raubal died in 1910 and Angela moved, with her three children, to Vienna. There she worked as manager of the Mensa Academia Judaica, a hostel for Jewish students. Decent and hardworking, she physically defended her Jewish students against attacks by mobs during racist rioting in the city, barring their entry into the hostel with her body. Despite being in the same town as Hitler for several years, the pair lost touch and did not re-establish contact until after the war in 1919. Angela had been Hitler’s favourite sibling but the struggling artist had no interest in rekindling old dreams and feelings. In the days before the First World War he probably did not even know that Angela was in the same city. By 1919 things had changed. He was now a decorated war hero – proudly wearing his Iron Cross First Class – and was already on the first rung of the ladder that would lead him, finally, to the very top. He had moved his base and was now a resident of Munich, an altogether more cosmopolitan environment than Vienna. 36\n\nHitler_and_His_Women_P3.indd 36\n\n22/06/20 2:57 PM\n\nA Loving, Dysfunctional, Dangerous Family\n\nIn 1924 Angela also moved to Munich. Her daughter Angelika, Geli as she was known, went with her. Geli was an attractive girl who immediately caught Hitler’s eye, even at this early stage, but at the time of the reconciliation of brother and half-sister she was too young to unduly bother his libido. That would come later. In due course Angela became Hitler’s housekeeper at the Obersaltzberg near Berchtesgaden, a post she held for several years, and Geli again accompanied her mother.

Hitler took no notice of his sister’s disapproval, even granting Eva a position of honour on the platform at that year’s Nuremberg Rally. Angela, who was also there, protested and told Hitler that Fraulein Braun, as she always called Eva, had deliberately drawn attention to herself. Hitler immediately hit back and within a very short period Angela was dismissed from his service. There was no doubt that by this time Angela was unwell and the rift with Eva Braun gave Hitler the excuse he needed. The rigours of keeping house, welcoming foreign diplomats and running a large establishment were now beyond her. Family loyalty clearly meant nothing to him. Angela’s heart had been causing her problems for some time and in 1936, after leaving her brother’s employmen"
