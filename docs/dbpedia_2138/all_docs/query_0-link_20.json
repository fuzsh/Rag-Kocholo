Her mother appeared in several theater plays and her younger sister, Zorka Janů, was also a movie actress. Lida Baarova's first love affair was with the film director Karel Lamač. She was renowned for her beauty, with Czech movie director, Otakar Vávra commenting that, \"Her beauty likely infatuated every man she met.\" After being discovered by talent scouts for the German movie studios, Lídá Baarova left Prague for Berlin.\n\nThe road to fame\n\nIn Berlin she met Gustav Fröhlich, an actor in the German cinema, and starred in several films with him. In 1935, following her successful appearance in the German film \"Barcarole\", she received several job offers from the Hollywood studios. She turned them down, but later regretted it and told her biographer, Josef Škvorecký:\n\n::\"I could have been as famous as Marlene Dietrich.\"\n\nAfter her engagement to Gustav Fröhlich, she and her fiancé moved to the Schwanenwerder peninsula on the outskirts of Berlin, where their house on the (later named) Karl-Marx-Straße 8 was close to the residence of Joseph Goebbels on Inselstraße 8. Joseph Goebbels was a minister in Adolf Hitler's administration, with a decisive voice in German movie production. Lída Baarová met Joseph Goebbels while working for Ufa films. They started an affair that lasted for over a year and caused her breakup with Gustav Fröhlich.\n\nAfter Goebbels' wife Magda learned about this affair, she complained to Adolf Hitler. Hitler was the godfather of Goebbels' children, and sympathetic towards Magda; he asked Goebbels to end the affair. Goebbels offered his resignation instead. He wanted to divorce his wife, marry Lída Baarová, and leave Germany with his Liduška, (Czech diminutive of Lída, connoting love), as he affectionatedly called her, for Japan. However, Hitler did not accept his resignation. On October 15, 1938, Joseph Goebbels attempted suicide.\n\nShortly afterwards, Lída Baarová received a call from the German police that she was a persona non grata and was given consilium abeundi to leave Germany. She went to Prague and, in 1941, to Italy, where she starred in such movies as \"Grazia\" (1943), \"La Fornarina\" (1944), \"Vivere ancora\" (1945), and others. After American troops occupied Italy, she returned to Prague, where she dated her old friend Hans Albers, another of Germany's movie idols. In April 1945, Lída Baarová left Prague for Germany, to join Albers in his country house on the shores of Lake Starnberg. On the way, she was taken into custody by the American military police, imprisoned in Munich, and later extradited to Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe post-war years\n\nIn Czechoslovakia, Baarová faced a death sentence for her work with the Germans during the war, but she was able to prove that she worked in Germany before the war and received only a prison sentence. In prison, she was often visited by Jan Kopecký who, like many others, was infatuated with her. Kopecký was a close relative of a prominent politician in the post-war government of Czechoslovakia who arranged Lída's release from prison. Jan Kopecký and Lída Baarová were married in 1949 and formed an itinerant troupe playing marionettes before they escaped to Austria. From there, Kopecký immigrated to Argentina, leaving Lída behind to recuperate in the sanatorium of Dr. Lundwall.\n\nIn Austria, Lída attempted a comeback, but Anton Walbrook, who was persecuted during the war for his sexual orientation, withdrew from a film where he was cast with her. To escape the resulting negative media, she left for Argentina, where she lived in extreme poverty. She decided to return to Italy. Her husband stayed in Argentina and they were divorced in 1956. Back in Italy, she appeared in several films, including Fellini's \"I Vitelloni\" (1953), where she played the wife of a rich merchant. In 1958, she moved to Salzburg, where she performed in a theater. In 1970, she married Kurt Lundwall, a physician 20 years her senior. In the same year, Rainer Werner Fassbinder gave her a part in \"The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant\".\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin wall\n\nIn the 1990s Lída Baarová reappeared on the cultural scene of the Czech Republic. She published her autobiography and a movie, \"Lída Baarová's Bittersweet Memories\", appeared in 1995 and won an award at the 1996 Art Film Festival in Trenčianske Teplice, Slovakia.\n\nLída Baarová suffered from Parkinson's disease and died in 2000 in Salzburg, while living alone on the estate she inherited after the death of her second husband, Dr. Lundwall. If she ever felt guilt about her past, she rigorously suppressed it. \"There's no doubt that Goebbels was an interesting character,\" she observed in 1997, \"a charming and intelligent man and a very good storyteller. You could guarantee that he would keep a party going with his little asides and jokes.\n\nHer ashes were interred in Prague's Strašnice cemetery, where she rests with her parents and sister Zorka Janů.\n\nFilmography\n\n* Zivota sladké hořkosti Lídy Baarové (Lída Baarová's Bittersweet Memories, 1995)\n\n* The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (1970)\n\n* Il Cielo brucia (The Sky Burns, 1957)\n\n* Retorno a la verdad (The Truth Will Set You Free, 1957)\n\n* El Batallón de las sombras (The Forgotten Ones, 1957)\n\n* Rapsodia de sangre (Ecstasy, 1957)\n\n* Todos somos necesarios (We All Matter, 1956)\n\n* Viaje de novios (Honeymoon, 1956)\n\n* La Mestiza (The Mestiza, 1956)\n\n* Miedo (The Fear, 1956)\n\n* Gli innocenti pagano (What Price Innocence? 1953)\n\n* Pietà per chi cade (Compassion, 1953)\n\n* I Vitelloni (The Loafers, 1953)\n\n* La vendetta di una pazza (Revenge of a Crazy Girl, 1952)\n\n* Carne inquieta (Restless, 1952)\n\n* Gli amanti di Ravello (The Lovers of Ravello, 1950)\n\n* La Bisarca (1950)\n\n* Vivere ancora (Still Alive, 1944)\n\n* L' Ippocampo (The Sea-Horse, 1944)\n\n* Il Cappello da prete (Priest's Hat, 1944)\n\n* Ti conosco, mascherina!
