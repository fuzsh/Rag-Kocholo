Little Susanne (a true story) patronized the bar together with her parents for many years. Whenever her parents had a drink, she had to have one, too. In the beginning, this was freshly squeezed orange juice, later the legendary bartender Kurti put some Cassis and when Susan was 13 years old, the drink – still in the making – was enhanced by Tonic Water. On her 16 birthday a dash of Campari was added and when she became 18, the drink was topped with some Vodka. All this together made the ‘Susanne’, as we know and enjoy it today.\n\n*****\n\nEven Richard Nixon – at that time still US Vice-President – felt compelled to write a personal letter to the head of the province thanking him for his hospitality and giving special praise to the Goldener Hirsch for its excellent cuisine. ‘The luncheon at the Golder Hirsch was one of the most well-appointed and delicious I have ever attended, and I hope you will extend my compliments to Countess Walderdorff.’ **** Nobody who can do small talk like the affable headwaiters of the restaurant. On a good day you might hear them – just like I did – cover the following topics: ‘On today’s menu we have venison. The first stag was shot on 15 May …brown trout thrives best in meadow streams …there are crickets and lots of flies and mice there. Did you know that the Canadians even use mice as bait? It’s true. And did you know that the Arnsland marsh used to belong to the archbishop of Salzburg?… Since you are just enjoying the duck, let me tell you: My wife and I saw a duck with eight chicks on the pond at Leopoldskron. Next day one of the chicks was missing. After a week there was only one left. The pike got them all. … In London make sure to visit Harry’s Bar near the Connaught. It’s wonderful!’ ***** Fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent invented the dinner at the bar and added an entirely new dimension to the traditional aperitif. Following his dinner at the bar, the low, small round tables were converted into hydraulically extendable dining tables. These even had fittings that made it possible to join them together. Nowadays, Peter Handke, Karl Lagerfeld, Sunnyi Melles and Helmut Lohner have come to appreciate this stroke of genius. ***** The former host of the hotel was Countess Walderdorff. Her unconventional ideas became legendary and there are many anecdotes to prove it. For example, once after a premiere of Fidelio Countess Harriet approached one of the tables in her restaurant. She was still under the spell of this beautiful opera and asked an elegant couple: ‘Wasn’t it wonderful?’ ‘Yes’, said the gentleman, ‘the venison was outstanding.’ ‘I’m talking about the performance of Fidelio!’ Harriett von Walderdorff replied indignantly. That particular couple never again managed to get a table at her restaurant. ****** After his first concert, when Japanese conductor Seiji Ozawa (here with Anne Sophie Mutter) arrived at the Goldener Hirsch and was greeted with an ovation, he was so surprised that he quickly disappeared behind the curtains of the cloakroom. Shortly afterwards, he reappeared, bowed, disappeared and reappeared etc. until Harriet Walderdorff took charge of this situation by leading the young Japanese to Karajan’s table. ***** The Festival is the social highlight of the Salzburg year. On the morning of a grand performance you can’t help but feel the butterflies in your stomach. Herbert von Karajan – like all grand maestros – was one of the greatest crowd pullers in the history of music. Between 1956 and 1964 he was Director of the Viennese State Opera. During the Easter Festival – initiated by him – he always stayed at the Goldener Hirsch. The city quivered in anticipation before one of his legendary concerts. Champagne flowed at the Goldener Hirsch. It seemed as if the entire house was ‘live’. The restaurant, the bar, the first floor, the Herzl - any table that had room on it for a couple of plates had been reserved weeks in advance. Finally the moment had come. It wasn’t dinner that arrived; no, it was the maestro himself. Karajan entered the room, people applauded, some jumped up cheering and the maestro followed his wife Eliette to their corner table – number four – smiled at the ovations and was served Selchkarree with dumplings and Sauerkraut. He usually drank red wine from one of the famous green wine glasses and simply enjoyed himself – as did his audience, who adored and loved him.\n\n*****"
