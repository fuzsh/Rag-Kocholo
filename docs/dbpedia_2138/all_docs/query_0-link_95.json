        "text": "Pál Sugár, Paul Sugar\n\ndirector, screenwriter\n\nBiographical data unknown.\n\nThe place and date of birth of Pál Sugár are unknown. He first appears as a director at Thalia film studio where, in 1918, he made a film version of Victor Hugo’s drama Ruy Blas with the title Vagabond (A csavargó). Jenő Törzs played the lead in the film that has now been lost, with Lia Putty (who went on to enjoy a major international career in films) playing lady-in-waiting Casilda, and Ilona Bánhidy as Queen Maria.\n\nIn the same year, Sugár transferred to Star, one of the leading film studios of the day, where he was an actor in a brief comic scene, in The Lost Button (Fületlen gomb, dir: Jenő Kéméndy, 1918). In the scene we see painter Adalbert Zoltay (Pál Sugár) and his wife Malvin (Lucy Wett), who have a happy marriage in their villa in Buda. The idyll continues until they discover a button on the carpet and are unable to decide whose clothing it came from. The quarrel then sparks a fight between the maid and the butler. It appears that the conflict will end in divorce, with even the parents unable to calm the young ones down. The married couple have already started to share out their household possessions when a new tenant turns up for the apartment. At this critical moment, they find another button on the ground, which means that both sides were right all along and peace is restored.\n\nFor more photos, click on the gallery:\n\nThe next time we see Sugár at Star is as a director. In 1918, he made the Art Nouveau-style melodrama After the Storm (Vihar után) about a simple girl, Hedda, who abandons the love of the honest carpenter for a count. However, the count is only toying with Hedda, who is unable to return home and in her shame she attempts suicide. She throws herself into the river but fishermen pluck her out and take her home. The count soon gambles away all his fortune and in his hour of need he remembers Hedda, who has returned to her old life and wants nothing to do with him. The fate of the rejected man is sealed: he shoots himself.\n\nIn one year, Sugár also directed three comedies here: Rented Mansion (Bérelt kastély), The Escapees (A szökevények) and an anthology farce, The Remedy for Love (Szer a szerelem ellen).1 He remained active during the Republic of Councils of 1919, when he shot The Statue (A szobor) and The Alpine Tragedy (Alpesi tragédia). After the overthrow of the Republic of Councils, like many other artists in the film profession he, too, left Hungary and went to Germany. In Munich, in 1921 he was screenwriter on Carl Boese’s film A Walk Through Hell (Der Gang durch die Hölle), and then in Berlin he directed The Glowing Alley (Die glühende Gasse, 1927). This film had trouble passing the censor, with it being banned in the first round because the tone was considered immoral and every character in the story was characterized by some general evil. The premiere of his next film was delayed for similar reasons, although this was shot in Hungary.\n\nIn 1929, he received a request from Géza Steinhardt, who with his newly founded production and distribution company was attempting to resurrect the long-moribund Hungarian film production.2\n\nSugár travelled home and directed the film Slave Bird in partnership with Lajos Lázár. The love and crime story was made in Budapest with a mixed German-Hungarian cast.\n\nThe heroine, Anna (Lissy Arna), ends up in prison because of her lover, who had persuaded her to steal. The girl cannot forget the man so she convinces the good-hearted prison doctor (Charlotte Susa) to let her out for a single night so she can see him once again. Jenő (Hans Adalbert Schlettow) is a womanizing hotel waiter who has not remained faithful and is having relationships with three women at the same time, the exotic dancer (El’ Dura), the new room maid (Olga Kerékgyártó) and Madárka (Ida Turay). He plans to rob the hotel safe and escape together with the dancer, but Anna stops the scheme. Having persuaded Jenő to give up his bad ways, she also keeps her word and returns to prison. In subject and in its methods, this motion picture is a characteristic piece of late silent filmmaking. However, neither the expressive camera work (cinematographers: József Bécsi and Adolf Otto Weitzenberg) nor the fast-paced plot proved successful. The censor also tried to ban Slave Bird because certain scenes were declared immoral and the story as a whole was seen as not having an appropriate moral lesson.3 It finally received an export licence and, in the second round, authorization to screen it in Hungary, but only for viewers aged 16 and above. When it featured on the programme of Omnia on 30 December 1929, it had to compete with talkies and by that time silent films no longer captured the imagination of audiences.\n\nSugár returned to Berlin and his name appeared in several productions. In 1934 he made a short feature film entitled Strupps and was screenwriter on the maritime adventure La Paloma – A Song of Comradeship (La Paloma – Ein Lied der Kameradschaft, Karlheinz Martin, 1934). The following year we find him in Vienna, where he was screenwriter for George Jacoby’s movie Lieutenant Bobby, the Daredevil (Leutenant Bobby, der Teufelskerl, 1935). Contemporary reports say he entered his screenplay into a competition and won 10,000 schillings and the opportunity to make a film out of the script.4 In this jolly story, an Austrian officer (Gustav Fröhlich) travels to London to meet his recently married sister (Lizzi Holzschuch) at a costume ball. However, while he cannot find his sister he does come across somebody else, the beautiful Lady Milton (Lída Baarová).\n\nAt this point we lose sight of the career of Pál Sugár. In general, there is only partial information about his career anyway. Various film databases list just one or other piece of his oeuvre and sometimes he is treated as being different persons in connection with films recorded under various creative names. Three of his films are held in the National Film Institute – Film Archive collection, all three having come from the Austrian Film Archive. The short comedy The Lost Button is preserved here along with the melodrama After the Storm and Slave Bird, which Dutch private collector Jan Zaalberg passed to the Austrian Film Archive, where it was successfully identified. 4k digital restoration and presentation of Slave Bird has been realized in the Season of Classic Films programme of the ACE - Association des Cinémathèques Européennes with the support of the MEDIA strand of the Creative Europe programme of the European Union in 2023."
