Each tells the story of the 48-year dictatorship in Portugal. A haunting depiction of oppression and torture. Film Critics Prize, Dok Leipzig 2010.\n\nThe photographs capture their subjects frontally and in profile. They are official pictures, part of the record of repression taken by the dreaded PIDE, the secret police. What can a portrait photograph reveal about a political system? What can a picture taken 35 years ago tell us about our own society? Based on photographs taken following the arrest of political prisoners during the Portuguese dictatorship (1926-1974), 48 aims to convey the mechanisms by which a dictatorial regime seeks to self-perpetuate. In place of a face lined with its terrifying memory marks, there are photographs, floating up out of the darkness, staring back relentlessly, pouring words out of their asymmetries, reflecting on their time spent in prison. By means of an innovative cinematographic approach Susana de Sousa succeeds in creating a film of universal impact. The film takes the viewers to the darkest realms of physical and psychological ordeals via words and still images. A poignant yet quiet outcry against oppression and inhuman treatment.\n\nproducer: Ansgar Schäfer\n\neditor: Susana de Sousa Dias\n\ncamera: Octávio Espírito Santo\n\nsound: Armanda Carvalho\n\nproduction info:\n\nKintop\n\nCampo Pequeno, 50-2º Esq.\n\n1000-081 Lisboa, Portugal\n\ntel.: + 351 21 795 72 68\n\ninfo@kintop.net\n\nwww.kintop.net\n\nfilmography\n\nStill Life (2005)\n\nAgnus Dei: Lamb of God in International Panorama\n\nAlejandra Sánchez / France & Mexico / 2010 / 81 min / Spanish\n\nAbused by a priest at the age of 11, Jesús, now 26, decides to bring criminal charges against his attacker, and confronts him in person. FIPRESCI Prize, Dok Leipzig 2010\n\nAgnus Dei is a candid documentary on the thorny subject of pedophilia in the Catholic Church. As an 11-year-old altar boy Jesús, now 26, was abused by a priest. Father Carlos, a priest and paternal figure respected by the community and seen as an unimpeachable authority, intimidated Jesús into long years of silence. Years later, however, Jesús decides not only to tell his story but also to bring criminal charges against his aggressor, and confront him in person. This is the story of his journey, a mandatory hiatus on the road to forgiveness, born of a deep-seated need to come to terms with the past. Jesús is torn between brotherly love and anger toward his sexual predator in this film full of nuances that gives a name and a face to a problem stigmatized by silence.\n\nproducer: Carole Solive\n\neditor: Ana García\n\ncamera: Érika Licea, Pablo Ramirez Duron\n\nsound: Sylvianne Bouget, Ana Garciá Ana Garciá\n\nmusic: Tareke Ortiz\n\ndistribution info:\n\nMaëlle Guenegues CAT&Docs\n\n18, rue Quincampoix Paris\n\n75004 France\n\ntel: +33 1 4459 6353\n\nmaelle@catndocs.com\n\nwww.catndocs.com\n\nselected filmography\n\nBajo Juárez, the City Devouring its Daughters (2006)\n\nAlgeria, Images of a Fight in Evidence: Archival Footage in Documentary\n\nJérôme Laffont / Belgium / 2009 / 52 min / French\n\n“The camera is a weapon,” proves René Vautier, who defied the French-imposed censorship during the Algerian war of Independence and joined the battle of competing images on the side of the independence fighters.\n\nAs with all later conflicts, the Algerian War of Independence in the early 1960’s became a high-stakes target in the battle of competing images. Behind the war itself was a media war which was almost as crucial in contesting the sympathy of the world for the opposing points of view. As a counter to the propaganda movies made in support of the French military campaign, a few directors such as René Vautier devoted themselves to documenting the struggle from behind the lines with the independence fighters. Much of this footage – at times moving and at times harrowing, often very beautiful – was banned in France. Much of it has been lost and some even destroyed. A compelling film which raises important questions about the power of filmmaking and the purposes it serves in documenting – or manipulating – reality.\n\nproducer: Michel Khleifi\n\neditor: Joachim Thôme\n\ncamera:Naël Khleifi\n\nsound: Nicolas Jolym, Matthieu Roche\n\nproduction info:\n\nSourat Films Co. & Centre de l'Audiovisuel à Bruxelles (CBA)\n\n28 avenue des Villas, B-1060 Bruxelles, Belgium\n\ntel.: 32 2 375 04 75 / 32 4 73 99 53 18\n\nfax.: 32 2 375 04 75\n\nCentre de l'Audiovisuel à Bruxelles (CBA)\n\nMaison de la Francité, 19f, avenue des Artsm Bruxelles, 1000, Belgique\n\ntel.: +32(0)2/227.22.30 / +32(0)2/227.22.39\n\ncba@skynet.be\n\nhttp://www.cbadoc.be\n\nfilmography\n\nRésister n’est pas un crime (2007)\n\nAutumn Gold in International Panorama\n\nJan Tenhaven / Austria & Germany / 2010 / 94 min / Czech & English & German & Italian & Swedish\n\nFive senior athletes prove that being 80, 95, or even 100 years old is just a minor inconvenience when becoming a world champion is at stake. A stunning film about human dignity and the power to live. Audience award, One World FF, Prague, 2011\n\nThis film offers a sensitive, formally elegant, and cheerful portrait of five athletes competing at the 18th international senior citizen World Masters Championships in the Finnish city of Lahti. The makers of this documentary convincingly show us how well one can preserve a healthy spirit, a vigorous mind and admirable levels of fitness in an aging body. The protagonists include the Viennese centenarian Alfred Proksche, who paints female nudes in his spare time, the 94-year-old Italian discus thrower Gabre Gabric-Calvesi, 93-year-old Herbert Liedtke, a ferocious sprinter from Stockholm, and Jiří Soukup, an 82-year-old high-jumper from Hradec Králové. For them, preparing for the championships, like the individual competitions themselves, is primarily a race against time. Despite this, they hope that their performances next year will be a little bit better.\n\nproducer: Christian Beetz\n\neditor: Jürgen Winkelblech\n\ncamera: Marcus Winterbauer, Martin Langner\n\nsound: Patrick Veigel, Oliver Grafe, Oliver Prasnikar\n\nmusic: Andy Baum\n\nproduction info:\n\nGebrueder Beetz Filmproduktion Köln GmbH & Co.

In the past year, the number of asylums seekers in Hungary has risen above 4000. Following a rigorous application and screening procedure, only ten percent of the applicants are granted refugee status. After staying in the camps in Békéscsaba and Debrecen, they are moved to the Refugee Reception Center in Bicske. The “chosen ones” can live here for one year, during which social workers, language teachers and various NGOs try to prepare them for a new life in Hungary. Caught Between Two Worlds is a dramatic journey into the depths of refugee existence and what it means to start from scratch in a country that is prepared to host you, but remains foreign.\n\nproducer: Sára László, Marcell Gergő\n\neditor: Péter Sass\n\ncamera: Rudolf Péter Kiss\n\nsound: Péter Benjamin Lukács\n\nmusic: Hildur Gudnadottir, Salif Keita\n\nproduction info:\n\nCampfilm Production\n\nKároly krt. 3/c\n\n1075 Budapest, Hungary\n\nsara@campfilm.eu\n\ntel.: + 36 20 922 2655\n\nselected filmography\n\n3 Esküvő (2009) / Hajónapló (2009) / Apaföld (2008) / A vizsga (2006) / A Tárca (2005)\n\nCalling the Ghosts. A Story about Rape, War and Women in Windows to the Past: Balkan War Reflections\n\nMandy Jacobson & Karmen Jelinčić / USA / 1996 / 63 min / Bosnian & Croatian\n\nTwo women from Bosnia-Herzegovina are caught in a war where rape was as much a weapon as bullets. Having survived the notorious Omarska concentration camp, they lobby to have rape included in the international lexicon of war crimes.\n\nThe first-person account of two women caught in a war where rape was as much an everyday weapon as bullets or bombs. Jadranka Cigelj and Nusreta Sivać, childhood friends and lawyers, enjoyed the lives of \"ordinary modern women\" in Bosnia-Herzegovina until one day former neighbors became tormentors. Taken to the notorious Serb concentration camp of Omarska, the two women, like other Muslim and Croat women interned there, were systematically tortured and humiliated by their Serb captors. Once released, the pair turned a personal struggle for survival into a larger fight for justice, assisting other similarly brutalized women and successfully lobbying to have rape included in the international lexicon of war crimes by the UN Tribunal at the Hague. Chronicling the two women's experience and their remarkable transformation, Calling the Ghosts is an indispensable resource for deepening understanding of human rights abuses and combating violence against women in the global arena.\n\nproducer: Mandy Jacobson\n\neditor: Suzanne Rostock\n\ncamera: Mario Delić\n\nsound: Kristen Thomas, Mario Vargović\n\nmusic: Tony Adzinikolov\n\ndistributor:\n\nWomen Make Movies\n\n462 Broadway, Suite 500WS\n\nNew York, NY 10013\n\ntel.: + 1 212-925-0606\n\ninfo@wmm.com\n\nselected filmography\n\nMandy Jacobson: Wide Angle - Road to Riches (2003) / Locked Up (2001) / Calling the Ghosts (1996)\n\nClosing in on Tanja in International Panorama\n\nLeo de Boer / The Netherlands / 2010 / 90 min / Dutch & English & Spanish\n\nIn 2002, Tanja, a young Dutch woman, joined the Colombian guerilla movement FARC. Years later, her diaries are found, describing her loneliness and disillusionment with the struggle. Is there a way out for her?\n\nDuring a raid on FARC rebel camps in 2007, a diary written by Tanja Nijmeijer is found. Enthralled by the vision of a leftist rebel movement fighting for the freedom of an oppressed people, this small-town student-teacher decided to join the guerilleros in the Colombian jungle. After the publication of her diaries, Tanja Nijmeijer hit the headlines worldwide. In her diaries she complains of patriarchal relations in her unit and her lost sense of purpose in continuing the fight. There were no more reports about Nijmeijer after the diaries came out. Filmmaker Leo de Boer makes contact with Dutch FARC-expert Liduine Zumpolle, who disclosed the diaries. For decades she has been working in a Columbian guerrilla reintegration program. De Boer visits her and decides to go and search for Tanja in Colombia.

Branded as traitors by Palestinians, the entire family fled to Israel seeking the asylum that had been promised by Ibrahim's Israeli “operator.” Over a two-and-a-half-year period, as each day passes with no progress towards citizenship, tension builds within the family. Alienated and humiliated, Ibrahim's wife Yusra, three teenage sons and two daughters bear the consequences of Ibrahim's decision while struggling to assimilate into Israeli society.

Locals talk about the old and new face of the area.\n\nThe Corvin Project initiated in 2003 was the largest and most awarded Central European city development project. It envisioned the full transformation of cca. 22 acres territory in the VIIIth district of Budapest, which implied the demolition of all buildings in the given area. Both the local government and the investor wanted to get rid of the “slums” by relocating more than one thousand families who could not afford buying property in the old-new area. The protagonists of Corvin Variations are all local residents who have been relocated in the course of the project. Three relocated families recall with nostalgia the old community and the promenade that now lives only in their memories.\n\nproducer: András Muhi, Inforg Stúdió\n\neditor: Bence Bartos, Ági Mógor\n\ncamera: Klára Trencsényi\n\nsound: Rudolf Várhegyi, 4Cut\n\nmusic: Hanna Honthy, Miklós Preiszner\n\nproduction info:\n\nInforg Stúdió\n\n1092.

An unsettling story of glory and decay set in the Danube Delta. Audience Award / London International Documentary Film Festival, 2011\n\nThere is no road to Sulina. You can only get to this bizarre place by river or by sea. Nevertheless, Sulina is not an island. Squeezed into the land between the many branches of the river, Sulina is the town of the Danube Delta. In the past, almost 100 years ago, the town was the third largest harbour in Europe. Today, Sulina is slowly dying, dreaming about a united Europe. What has happened to this place, isolated from the world? In 1933 Eugeniu Botez, a commandant of the harbour of Sulina, wrote a novel called Europolis under the name of Jean Bart. A year later he died. In this strange novel Jean Bart prophesies that one day nothing will be left of the town, once full of life. With the death of Europolis Europe will be slowly dying in agony. A few years later his prophecy started to come true.\n\nproducer: Penko Roussev, Alexander Binder\n\neditor: Toma Waszarow\n\ncamera: Konstantin Zankov, Dimiter Mitov\n\nsound: Eric Spitzer-Marlyn\n\nmusic: Nikolai Ivanov\n\nproduction info:\n\nKostadin Bonev\n\nCompl.

The beauty of memory and love through a dense layer of grief.\n\nLife proceeds at a gentle pace in Ahatovici, a picturesque village in the green hills outside Sarajevo. But Ahatovici was far from quiet in 1992 when, during the war in Yugoslavia, the village fell into Serbian hands. Almost all the men were taken prisoner and brutally murdered and the village was burnt to the ground. Only the women and children were spared. The film tells the story behind this forgotten genocide. The murdered men are commemorated in the stories of their wives, mothers and daughters, and through the few remaining photographs and personal belongings. A memory is attached to each object, but that someone was a good husband does not appear from a photograph, but from the way his wife, talking about him, caresses the picture and presses it against her chest. Through the enveloping grief, the film looks for the beauty of remembering and of love.\n\nproducer: John Appel\n\neditor: Patrick Minks\n\ncamera: John Appel\n\nsound: Piotr van Dijk\n\nmusic: Hesperion XXI\n\nproduction info:\n\nAppel & Honigmann / VPRO Television\n\nInterkerkelijke Omroep Nederland (IKON)\n\nBergweg 16\n\n1217 SE Hilversum\n\ntel.: + 35 672 7272\n\nikon@ikon.nl\n\nwww.ikonrtv.nl\n\nselected filmography\n\nOblivion (2008) / Emoticons (2007) / Forever (2006) / Framed Marriage (2005) / Give Me Your Hand (2004) / Food for Love (2004) / Crazy (2000) / Hanna lacht (1999) / De juiste maat (1998) / 2 Minutes Silence, Please (1998) / The Underground Orchestra (1997) / O Amor Natural (1996) / Goodbye (1995) / Metal and Melancholy (1994) / Ghatak (1990) / Your Opinion, Please (1989) / Mindshadows (1988) / The Front Door (1985)\n\nGranito: How to Nail a Dictator in Evidence: Archival Footage in Documentary\n\nPamela Yates / USA / 2011 / 103 min / English\n\nWhat is the role of a documentary filmmaker in the events she chronicles? A 1982 documentary film When the Mountains Tremble becomes forensic evidence to help prove a genocide case against a military dictator.\n\nGranito is a story of destinies joined by Guatemala’s past, and how a documentary film, intertwined with a nation’s turbulent history, emerges as an active player in the present. In 1982, fledgling filmmaker Pamela Yates went to Guatemala to make a movie about the civil war devastating that country. The resulting documentary When the Mountains Tremble centered on guerrillas — including student protestors and indigenous Mayan people — fighting the country’s repressive military government at the time when the outcome of the conflict was uncertain. While filming, Yates was allowed to shoot the only known footage of the army as it carried out the genocide. More than 20 years later, after a change in the government of Guatemala, the country began to investigate the slaughter of the Mayan people, and a war crimes tribunal in Spain even set out to prepare a case to indict the former leaders of the country. Yates realized that excerpts and outtakes from her earlier film might aid the prosecution, and this case forced her to look back and question the role she had played as an observer and filmmaker.\n\nproducer: Paco de Onís\n\neditor: Peter Kinoy\n\ncamera: Melle van Essen\n\nsound: Richard Fleming, Alvaro Silva Wuth\n\nmusic: Roger C.

A look at the years of battle between ‘Pride’ and ‘NoPride’ supporters in Riga, and the way political manipulation has shaped the debate.\n\nIn the summer of 2005, the first festive lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people’s parade took place in Riga. Following the example of similar LGBT parades in Western Europe, they decided to call it “Pride.” Yet the good intentions spiraled into a chain of conflicts and controversies. Powerful emotions dramatically split Latvian society; the people involved were showered with human excrement and holy water, families were torn apart, jobs lost, and a priest expelled from the church for openly admitting his homosexuality. Jesus, the devil, patriotism, and human rights were invoked to support different views on the issue, and the press had a field day reporting on the ongoing scandal. Kaspars Goba followed the events for five years, starting from the first Pride Parade in 2005 to the decision not to hold Pride in Riga in 2010. The extensive footage collected over this period offers unprecedented insights into the opinions and life stories of the individuals on both the ‘Pride’ and the ‘NoPride’ fronts.\n\nproducer: Ieva Ūbele\n\neditor: Gatis Belogrudovs, Visvaldis Zarakovskis\n\ncamera: Kaspars Goba, Marģeris Eglītis, Inese Apse\n\nsound: Oskars Doma, Jānis Zaneribs\n\nmusic: www.extrememusic.se, Edgars Ozoliņš\n\nproduction info:\n\nElm Media\n\nGanību dambis 15\n\nRīga, LV 1045, Latvija\n\ntel: +371 283 66800\n\nelmmedia@elmmedia.lv\n\nhttp://www.homo.lv/\n\nselected filmography\n\nCity of Sweets (2010) / Exploring Nature: Five Stories (2009) / Engure.

In Texas, a woman struggles against the criminal justice system for her son to survive, while he awaits execution for 14 years.

Lacking power and legitimacy, and battling its own family network and clan-based divisions, the interim government has had a hard time to stabilize the country politically, economically, and socially. All this is documented through interviews with several top officials, former president Askar Akaev in his Moscow exile, and “people on the street.” From Bishkek to the southern city of Osh, over the breath-taking highway uniting North and South through the Tian-Shan mountain range, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, Russians, Meshketian Turks, and other ethnic minorities share their anger, frustrations, and hopes.\n\ntrailer\n\nhttp://chemodanfilms.com/the-interim-country-trailer/\n\nInterrogation in Windows to the Past: Balkan War Reflections\n\nNamik Kabil / Bosnia and Herzegovina / 2007 / 42 min / Bosnian\n\nAn investigation of the trauma and denial, which have become a dominant – but silent – dimension of everyday life in the post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nDirector Namik Kabil interviews a group of eyewitnesses of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in a rusty, dingy, deserted shed. They sit at a table, plastic cup of coffee and ashtray within reach, harshly lit by fluorescent light - as if it were an interrogation. Kabil films them with a handheld camera, against a background of grimy tiles, asking elementary questions about the war. \"When did the war start for you?\" \"What did you eat?\" \"Did you see dead people?\" \"Did you learn anything from the war?\" And especially, \"do we need to talk about the war?\" With one exception, they all think they do, but they say many people prefer to keep silent about it. \"It's like when you have an elephant in the middle of the room,\" a woman says, \"and everyone pretends it's not there.\" They talk about their experiences in Sarajevo, in the trenches or abroad, about their dulled feelings, about the solidarity during the war. But despite Kabil's repeated attempts to find out who shot at them, the interviewees still lack the courage to discuss it. \"We didn't shoot at ourselves\" is one woman's way of evading the question. But to the question as to who won the war, the answer is unanimous: \"No one.\"\n\nproducer: Amra Bakšić Čamo\n\neditor: Timur Makarević\n\ncamera: Almir Djikoli, Boris Jugo\n\nsound: Igor Čamo\n\nmusic: Dino Šaran\n\nproduction info:\n\nSarajevo Center for Contemporary Art - SCCA\n\nObala Kulina bana 22\n\n71000 Sarajevo\n\nBosnia & Herzegovina\n\ntel.: + 387 33 665 304\n\nwww.scca.ba\n\nselected filmography\n\nMagnet (2011) / Vjernici (2009) / Nightguards (2008) / Crna hronika (2004)\n\nInto Eternity in International Panorama\n\nMichael Madsen / Denmark & Sweden & Finland & Italy / 2010 / 75 min / English & Swedish & Finnish\n\nThe world's final resting place for nuclear waste is soon to be sealed for 100,000 years. How can we prevent distant future generations from thinking they have found hidden treasure, or the pyramids of our time?\n\nEvery day, large quantities of highly radioactive waste created by nuclear power plants are placed in interim storage, which however is vulnerable to natural disasters and societal changes. In Onkalo, Finland, the world’s first permanent repository is being hewn out of solid rock to bury this waste. Onkalo is a gigantic network of tunnels being carved out of bedrock that will start receiving Finland’s nuclear waste in 2020. Once the repository is full, in about 100 years, it will be closed and will hopefully remain sealed for at least 100,000 years. Into Eternity takes viewers deep into the Onkalo facility as it is being constructed and asks Onkalo representatives, scientists, theologians and others to address fundamental but challenging questions, including how to warn distant generations of the deadly waste our civilization left behind? How do we prevent them from thinking they have found the pyramids of our time, mystical burial grounds, or hidden treasures? The film not only raises questions about the possibility of long-term nuclear waste storage, but also invites reflection on the limits of science and human knowledge, along with our responsibility to future generations and the heritage we leave behind.\n\nproducer: Lise Lense-Møller\n\neditor: Daniel Dencik, Stefan Sundlöf\n\ncamera: Heikki Färm\n\nsound: Nicolai Linck, Øivind Weingaarde\n\nproduction info:\n\nAUTLOOK\n\nMagic Hour Films in co-production with Atmo Media Network & Film i Väst & Mouka Filmi\n\nDK-Baldersgade 6\n\n2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark\n\ntel.: +45 3964 2284\n\npost@magichourfilms.dk\n\nwww.magichourfilms.dk\n\nProducer Lise Lense-Møller\n\npost@magichourfilms.dk\n\nselected filmography\n\nTo Damascus (2005) / Celestial Night: A Film on Visibility (2003)\n\nInvisible Strings- The Talented Pusker Sisters in Hungarian Panorama\n\nÁgnes Sós / 2010 / Hungary / 70 min / Hungarian\n\nIf your greatest rival were the person who you loved the most how would you break free from her shadow?

Kabul Dream Factory tells the story of an exceptional Afghani woman, Saba Sahar, who combines a career as a policewoman with one as an actress and film director as she fights for society to recognise the independence of Afghani women. The film accompanies her as she tries to bring her new film project to fruition. Meetings with potential financial backers and attempts at getting support from western aid organizations sketch out the positions of the western donors as well as internal power hierarchies. Only gradually does Sahar lift the veil of privacy and, with her nine-month-old baby on her lap, open herself up to an almost idyllic future at the end of the story. Her utopian dream of the autonomy of woman becomes embedded in hopes and memories as Sahar taps out the rhythm of a song by an old Afghani singer on her little daughter’s temple.\n\nproducer: Nils Bökamp, Felix Kriegsheim\n\neditor: Alexander Fuchs\n\ncamera: Alexander Gheorghiu\n\nsound:, Sebastian Heidinger\n\nproduction info:\n\nBoekamp & Kriegsheim GmbH\n\nEisenbahnstrasse 11\n\n10997 Berlin, Germany\n\ntel.: + 49 30 609 800 880\n\nmail@boekampkriegsheim.com\n\nwww.boekampkriegsheim.com\n\nselected filmography\n\nDrifter (2007) / Lichtenberg (2004) / Der Prinz / Ludwig Zwo / Harakiri (2003) / Pelikanismus – Das Tobias Delius 4tet (1999) / Ahab im Altersheim (1998)\n\nKarla’s Arrival in International Panorama\n\nKoen Suidgeest / Belgium & Spain & USA / 2010 / 90 min / Spanish\n\nA 19-year-old and her baby daughter live in a park in the Nicaraguan capital.

Already an addict for four years, Katka is looking forward to leading the normal life, finding a boyfriend, and starting a family.

Her life is spiralling downwards in a desperate cycle of theft, the search for drugs, moments of unhampered joy and more theft. After she breaks up with Láďa prostitution becomes her main source of income. Katka's awareness of the hopelessness of her existence and serious liver disease finally lead her to embark on methadone substitution treatment.

Others see him as a martyr, who stood in President Vladimir Putin's way and was therefore \"removed\" for political reasons to a Siberian jail, where his sentence was recently extended. But why did Russia's richest man return to the country from abroad when he had been given clear signals that he would be arrested and convicted? The director sets out to examine the circumstances surrounding the entire case, and even succeeds in recording a short interview with Khodorkovsky himself, the only one that was given during his imprisonment and court hearings. By way of interviews with relatives, colleagues and politicians, the filmmaker tries to ascertain the real reasons behind Khodorkovsky's detention.\n\nproducer: Cyril Tuschi\n\neditor: Claudia Simonesci\n\ncamera: Cyril Tuschi\n\nsound: Martin Frühmorgen\n\nmusic: Arvo Part\n\nproduction info:\n\nLALA Film, Cyril Tuschi\n\nSophienstr. 18, 101 78 Berlin\n\ncyril@lalafilms.de\n\nhttp://www.khodorkovsky-movie.com/\n\nselected filmography\n\nSlight Changes in Temperature and Mind (2004) / TURN!

Out on assignment to do a reportage on a prostitute for TV, filmmaker Ohad Itach meets Sophia, a drug-addict who prostitutes herself to earn money for yet another dose. Sophia is both strong and weak, vulnerable and impervious. Arriving in Israel from Moldova in the 1990s left her unstable and yearning for more. Sophia’s well-educated parents were unable to control their only daughter as she rapidly descended from singer in a rock-band to drug addict. Yet the family does give up hope of seeing their daughter come clean. Sophia’s wrenching journey into darkness and her struggle to come back to life without drugs is intimately documented by Ohad Itach, whose chance meeting with Sophia led not only to a powerful film, but to the possibility of moving forward.\n\nproducer: Ohad Itach\n\neditor: Yoav Raz\n\ncamera: Haim Asias, Ohad Itach\n\nsound: Alex Claude\n\nmusic: Ophir Leibovitch\n\nproduction info:\n\nTrue production Ltd.\n\n14 Chen Blvd\n\n64071 Tel Aviv, Israel\n\ntel: +972 50 759 0060\n\nThe Maelstrom: A Family Chronicle in Evidence: Archival Footage in Documentary\n\nPéter Forgács / Hungary & The Netherlands / 1997 / 60 min / English\n\nFamily gatherings, birthdays, outings, weddings – a rich family home movie archive.

When Budhia displays an uncommon talent for long distance running, Biranchi nurtures his gift, heralding him as a folk hero for the impoverished masses, and maybe even for India itself. But after golden child Budhia breaks down during a world-record 65 kilometer run at the age of four, public opinion begins to turn against the guru and his disciple, and soon the two are swept up in a maelstrom of media controversy and political scandal. Following Budhia's roller-coaster journey over five years, Marathon Boy is a Dickensian tale of greed, corruption, and broken dreams set between the heart-pounding world of marathon running, the poverty-stricken slums and the political intrigue of a modernizing India.\n\nproducer: Gemma Atwal, Matt Norman\n\neditor: Peter Haddon\n\ncamera: Matt Norman\n\nsound: Ajay Bedi, Subramanian Mani\n\nmusic: Garry Hughes\n\nproduction info:\n\nGemma Atwal\n\nOne Horse Town Productions\n\n5 Downs Park West, Westbury Park, Bristol.

Marcela married Jiří in 1980. She could not foresee that she would have problems with her flat and her mother-in-law, that she would give birth to a daughter, and that only 2 years later she would divorce. Unraveling before our eyes is the authentic story of an ordinary woman in an inadequate social environment and a less than satisfactory relationship. As the couple began to drift apart, the filmmaker focused more and more on Marcela. The documentary sees her through not only everyday problems and disappointments but also the considerable shocks she has endured: her divorce, the birth of a son with severe developmental problems, and the sudden death of her daughter, Ivana - a tragedy that leaves Marcela caught between her despair and desire to end her life and the responsibility she bears for her remaining son.\n\nproducer: Kateřina Černá, Pavel Strnad, Anna Becková\n\neditor: Alois Fišárek, Lenka Polesná, Zdenek Patočka\n\ncamera: Jan Malíř, Miroslav Souček, Vlastimil Hamerník\n\nsound: Zbyněk Mikulík, Petr Provazník, Jan Valouch\n\nMarriage Stories 20 Years Later – Ivana and Václav in Helena Třeštíková Retrospective\n\nHelena Třeštíková / Czech Republic / 2006 / 57 min / Czech\n\nMore than two decades after their marriage, the film follows up on Ivana and Václav, and wonders whether their personal and professional dreams have come true since their marriage in 1980.\n\nIn 1980, architecture students Ivana and Vašek decided to manage both family life and professional ambitions. They had maried a year earlier and had recently welcomed a baby into their lives. As the two tried to keep up with their studies while looking after their child in a cramped apartment, the couple displayed optimism about their future despite their taxing circumstances. In 1999, Trestikova paid a visit to Vaclav and Ivana on the occasion of their twentieth anniversary, and found that not everything had worked out as they had hoped; Vaclav's career in architecture didn't pan out and now he runs a furniture store that's slowly going broke while the stress of looking after their five children has pushed Ivana to the edge of a nervous breakdown.

Due to difficult housing conditions, they started living together only three years after their wedding. Though they already had two children at the time, the immaturity of their early marriage as well as their completely different characters soon started to take their toll. While energetic Stanislav kept moving forward in life, towards new interests, a new job and a new relationship, ambitionless Zuzana, whom motherhood prevented from making her own way in life, remains passive and is having difficulties finding a new partner.\n\nproducer: Anna Beckov\n\neditor: Zdenek Patočka\n\ncamera: Vlastimil Hamerník, Miroslav Souček, Richard Špůr, Jan Malíř\n\nsound: Jan Valouch, Miroslav Šimčík, Vladimír Nahodil, Zbyněk Mikulík\n\nMiner’s Day in International Panorama\n\nAndrey Gryazev / Russia / 2010 / 62 min / Russian\n\nUnemployment, drugs, violence, and love in a deserted Russian mining town.

The mine has closed, but the old residential blocks remain, still housing families of ex-miners, many of whom lost their jobs and direction in life. How do these families survive if there are no jobs for anybody over 35? The film focuses on the relationship between Sasha and Irina. After an unsuccessful attempt to find work in Moscow, 37-year-old Sasha returns home to his disabled wife and looks for a job, receiving continuous rejections on the grounds that he is “too old.” Irina’s brother, recently released from prison after serving a sentence for homicide, moves in with them. His desire to start a new life is challenged by prison traumas and addictions.

Founded by his father in 1936, the petrol station remained in Taszi’s hands through the most troubled times in recent Hungarian history – World War II, post-war nationalization, and the fall of the socialist regime in Hungary. The documentary reconstructs the struggles of a man who managed to hold on to a gas station and keep it open in an era when it was virtually impossible to run a private business, and who fought for 40 years until finally he officially won his petrol station back after the regime change. The proud owner is still working and motorists passing by on road no.7 can still fill up at his place, just like 76 years ago.\n\nproducer: Miklós Havas\n\neditor: Attila Kékesi\n\ncamera: Rudolf Péter Kiss\n\nsound: Miklós Havas\n\nmusic: Ferenc Darvas\n\nproduction info:\n\nHB Production\n\nNaphegy u. 38.\n\n1016 Budapest, Hungary\n\nhabanamedia@gmail.com\n\ntel: + 36 30 375 4486\n\nselected filmography\n\nA forradalom arca – Egy pesti lány nyomában (2006) / Béke poraikra (2004) / Vargabetű (2002) / A kor szelleme (1998) / Hajni (1994)\n\nThe Other Chelsea – A Story from Donetsk in International Panorama\n\nJakob Preuss/ Germany & Ukraine / 2010 / 87 min / Russian\n\nA real billionaire has to own a soccer team.

Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich bought the English club Chelsea, Georgian Merab Jordania bought the Dutch Vitesse; and Ukrainian billionaire Rinat Akhmetov pumped millions into his hobby, Shakhtar Donetsk. This documentary is about two of the team’s fans: coal miner Sasha sits among the common people in the terraces, while local politician Kolya is proud to share the VIP box with the Ukrainian political and business elite. The billionaire Akhmetov invests heavily in the club, which is becoming a major European force during the season followed by the film. Yet this sporting success funded by an oligarch’s fortune only seems to highlight the wider social and political stagnation of the region.

Sterling Award, Best US documentary, Silverdocs, Silver Spring, 2011\n\nOur School follows three Roma children from a small Transylvanian town in Romania who are among the first participants in an initiative to integrate the ethnically segregated Romanian schools. In 2006, Alin, Benjamin, and Dana set out from their dead-end segregated school for the city, optimistic for education and new friendships with Romanians. The children’s hopes and innocent optimism quickly soured as they met with low expectations and further isolation. Shot over four years, this tender vérité portrait fosters an intimacy in the children's profound reality and admiration for their indomitable spirit, which is punctuated by shocking instances of prejudice and ignorance. Their story touches on issues ranging from institutionalized racism, public education, and the intractability of poverty, culminating in an outrageous finale that cements the Roma children's struggle in the annals of egregious human rights violations.

Growing up with a rough and self-centered father, the sisters had to learn to be more responsible and independent than other teenagers. The girls are impressively mature, they solve their own problems, support each other in all circumstances. When the younger sister’s health begins to deteriorate, they make another attempt to rebuild family relations that have been neglected by adults for years. Having established telephone contact with their mother, who was deprived of her parental rights, they learn that she has moved to France.

A satirical look at Colombia’s bloody and painful recent history.\n\nIn the mid 1980's, Pablo Escobar was the world's most powerful drug dealer, and the third richest man in the world. He built a two–thousand-acre secure compound, deep in the Colombian jungle, complete with a lavish mansion and guest houses, stables, nightclub, a full-size concrete dinosaur park, and a private zoo housing hundreds of exotic animals, including two hippos that were settled into a man-made lake. Following his assassination in 1994, Escobar's assets were seized by the Colombian Government. 'Hacienda Napoles' was pillaged and destroyed: now only ruins remain and the animals have all disappeared. Except for the hippos. Far from starving to death, they have thrived and multiplied, making local fisherman fear for their lives and livelihoods. Pablo’s Hippos follows the 30-year career of the hippos -from their arrival from Africa through their gradual development into the new lords of the rivers - a parallel to Colombia’s own socio-economic adaptation and survival through 30 years of narco-trafficking and times of civil war and struggle.

Best Documentary at IDFA 2010\n\nOne family, three generations, facing globalization in Indonesia. At the start of the film, grandmother Rumidjah has left the bustle of Jakarta to live in the countryside. But when her adolescent, smart Tari granddaughter turns out to be too much for her son Bakti to handle, Bakti asks his mother to return to the city’s slums to provide the girl with a sense of values and purpose in life. Tari is growing up in a time of increasing openness. The people around her are allowed, and even expected, to express their opinion about everything. Indonesia is experiencing the growing pains of a Western-style generation gap, a new phenomenon in the Muslim country. The entire family sees in the intelligent Tari a chance to raise their status and escape the slums of Jakarta. Rumidjah is pressuring Tari to finish school with honors and be the first in their family to go to university. However Tari wants what all teenagers want – mobile phone, fun with friends while her family works themselves to the bone to pay her tuition fees. Using the microcosm of this family, which is presented in great detail, this documentary also reflects all the fundamental issues concerning life in contemporary Indonesia - corruption, conflict between religions, generation gaps and a growing divide between rich and poor.\n\nproducer: Hetty Naaijkens-Retel Helmrich\n\neditor: Jasper Naaijkens\n\ncamera: Leonard Retel Helmrich, Ismail (Ezther) Fahmi Lubish\n\nsound: Ismail (Ezther) Fahmi Lubish\n\nmusic: Fahmy Al-Attas, Danang Faturahman\n\nproduction info:\n\nHetty Naaijkens-Retel Helmrich\n\nScarabeefilms\n\nLloydstraat 5\n\nRotterdam\n\n5052 WP Netherlands\n\ntel: +31 13 530 0276\n\nhetty@scarabeefilms.com\n\nwww.scarabeefilms.com\n\nwww.positionamongthestars.com\n\nselected filmography:\n\nPromised Paradise (2006) / Shape of the Moon (2005) / Flight from Heaven (2003) / The Eye of the Day (2002) / Jemand auf der Treppe (1994) / Moving Objects (1992)\n\nRegretters in International Panorama\n\nMarcus Lindeen / Sweden / 2010 / 60 min / Swedish\n\nTwo men who went through sex-change operations, but later changed their minds, talk about their lives, gender, and regrets. Best Documentary, Prix Europa, Berlin, 2010\n\nOrlando and Mikael, born as men, go under the knife in the hope of finding their true selves, only to realize that life on the other side isn’t what they dreamed of. Mikael underwent surgery in the mid-90s as a 50-year-old, while Orlando was one of the very first sex change patients in Sweden in 1967. Mikael now dresses as a man again and is trying to persuade his doctors to restore his original gender. The surgery done, he finds himself trapped inside a strange body that isn't his, and feels lost between genders. Orlando tells the story of his 11-year marriage to a man who presumed that he was a biological woman, until one afternoon his secret was revealed. Today, Orlando is an androgynous dandy, donning a single diamond earring. He enjoys living as both: sometimes man, sometimes woman. Now well into their 60s, the two meet for the first time to talk about their lives as well as the one defining regret they share, their sexual reassignment.\n\nproducer: Kristina Åberg\n\neditor: Marinella Angusti, Kristin Grundström\n\ncamera: Erik Persson, Andréas Lennartsson\n\nsound: Agnieszka Lewalski, Jens Johansson\n\nmusic: Martin Willert\n\nproduction info:\n\nKristina Åberg\n\nAtmo Media Network\n\ntel.: +46 8 462 26 90\n\nkristina@atmo.se\n\nwww.atmo.se\n\nRené in Helena Třeštíková Retrospective\n\nHelena Třeštíková / Czech Republic / 2008 / 83 min / Czech\n\nIn and out of prison for twenty years: an intimate portrait of a man on the margin of society.\n\nA petty offense as a teenager earned René a prison sentence, and set him off on a life of crime.

Who is to be held responsible?\n\nBogotá, November 6, 1985. 35 heavily armed members of the M-19 guerilla movement storm the Palace of Justice, home to Colombia’s Supreme Court. Hundreds of people are taken hostage, including almost all of Colombia’s Supreme Court judges. The guerillas have a clear demand – they want the President put on trial. The government refuses to negotiate, and the military open fire on the building. For 27 hours, Bogotá’s central plaza is transformed into a brutal and bloody battlefield, resulting in nearly a hundred deaths, including 34 guerillas, along with eleven Supreme Court judges and many employees of the courts. Twelve others are unaccounted for. Many believe they were “disappeared”—removed from the building by government forces, tortured, and then killed. Twenty-five years later Colonel Plazas Vega, who commanded of the operation, is indicted for their disappearance. The case becomes a touchstone for the integrity of justice in Colombia.\n\nproducer: Bruni Burres, David Jammy, Maritza Blanco, Miguel Salazar\n\neditor: Megan Gill\n\ncamera: Roberto Quintana, Miguel Salazar, Mauricio Vidal\n\nsound: José Jairo Flórez\n\nmusic: Camilo Sanabria\n\nproduction info:\n\nPivot Pictures\n\nInternational Center for Transitional Justice\n\n5 Hanover Square, 24th floor\n\nNew York, NY 10004-2614\n\nwww.la-toma.info\n\nselected filmography\n\nAngus Gibson:\n\n21 Up, South Africa: Mandela’s Children (2007) / Heartlines (2007) / Singing the Changes (1988)\n\nMiguel Salazar:\n\nStolen Land (co-director) (2009) / The Battle of Science (2007) (co-director) / Hammer (2005)\n\nSons of Perdition in International Panorama\n\nTyler Measom & Jennilyn Merten / USA / 2010 / 87 min / English\n\nHow many mothers do you have? How many wives would you dream of? A behind-the-scenes look into Warren Jeffs’ polygamous community and the lives of those who decided to escape from it.\n\nRemote Colorado City on the Utah-Arizona border is home to the \"Crick,\" a Fundamentalist Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) community. This is the oldest polygamist compound in the United States; here men have several wives and raise their children by the strict code imposed and guarded by the FLDS’ prophet Warren Jeffs. In 2003, Jeffs began a systematic effort to cleanse his flock in preparation for the end of the world. He banned public schooling, gentile books, recreations, and excommunicated all his rivals and critics, marrying their women and children to other men. Hundreds of teenage boys escaped the community, giving up their families and salvation in the hope of an independent life. Sons of Perdition follows three boys after they leave the isolation of Colorado. With limited educations and rarely a stable address, they face enormous obstacles. All the boys have big dreams – starting with the hope of attending high school – yet they long desperately for contact with their families. With unprecedented access, directors Tyler Measom and Jennilyn Merten follow the teenagers for three years after their departure, creating powerful portraits of individualities struggling to be born despite the challenging traumas of the past. A timely, critical look at faith, family and religious exile in mainstream America.\n\nproducer: Julie Goldman, Tyler Measom, Jennilyn Merten\n\neditor: Jenny Golden\n\ncamera: Tyler Measom\n\nmusic: Mark Geary, Karl Odlum\n\nproduction info:\n\nLeft Turn Films\n\n205 E.

An insight into the bureaucracy that made the Holocaust possible.\n\nA German in the upper echelons of the Nazi party, Adolf Eichmann was in charge of the expulsion of Jews, Gypsies, and Slavic ethnic groups from the Reich between 1938 and 1941, and then of their deportation from Europe to the death camps. In 1960, he was captured by the Israeli Secret Service in Argentina. His subsequent trial in Jerusalem was one of the first filmed public trials. Eyal Sivan assembled excerpts of this footage to create a tightly edited and compelling documentary about a bureaucrat who fulfilled his duties during a time of war. Eichmann steadfastly insists that his part in the Holocaust was neither active or evil: he was only following orders. Inspired by Hannah Arendt's book Eichmann in Jerusalem, a Report on the Banality of Evil, the film offers profound insight into how the Holocaust was facilitated by bureaucracy and a subservient mindset that allowed people like Eichmann to claim ignorance and shuffle responsibility for atrocious crimes around like so many carbon-copy forms.\n\nproducer: Armelle Laborie, Eyal Sivan\n\neditor: Audrey Maurion\n\ncamera: Leo Hurwitz\n\nsound: Nicolas Becker, Philippe Baudhuin\n\nmusic: Jean-Michel Levy, Nicolas Becker, Krishna Levy, Yves Robert, Béatrice Thiriet\n\nproduction info:\n\nMomento!\n\n38, rue de la Chine 75020 Paris France\n\ntel.: +33 (0)1 43 66 25 24\n\ncontact@momento-films.com\n\nwww.momento-films.com\n\nEyal Sivan\n\nwww.eyalsivan.net\n\nfilmography\n\nJaffa, The Orange's Clockwork (2009) / Citizens K.

The troup has become a vehicle for political resistance in Europe’s last dictatorship, and it proves why the show must go on.\n\nAs the European Union's sanctions seal Belarus from the outside, Lukashenko's control of the media closes it from the inside. But an oddball band of thespians are determined to fight the censorship. Banned by the state, Free Theatre performs in secret locations and texts the venue to audiences. Every play could be their last. Husband and wife team Nikolai Khalezin and Natalya Kolyada have devoted their lives to the theatre. They give voice to the outsiders of Belarusian society: the gay, the disabled, the mentally ill, and they provide a vehicle for political resistance in Europe’s last dictatorship. Actors such as Jude Law and Sienna Miller have expressed their support for the members of the Free Theatre. The dramatist Tom Stoppard has provided financial support to the ensemble. Staging a Revolution provides an intimate look into this underground world; a world that, for their own safety, Nikolai and Natalya may ultimately be forced to leave behind.\n\nproducer: Mathew Charles\n\neditor: Juan Luis Passarelli\n\ncamera: Mathew Charles, Albina Kovalyova\n\nmusic: Lucy Mulgan, Sergei Shnurov\n\nproduction info:\n\nMathew Charles Daffodil Media\n\n25 Church Crescent, London\n\nN10 3NA U.K.\n\ntel: +44 773 791 2505\n\ninfo@daffodilmedia.com\n\nwww.daffodilmedia.com\n\nselected filmography\n\nMathew Charles: Beyond the Pink Curtain (2009)\n\nThe State of Weightlessness in Evidence: Archival Footage in Documentary\n\nMaciej J.

Combining interviews with Russian cosmonauts with never before seen archival footage of the early Soviet space program, The State of Weightlessness explores our place in the universe. Cosmonauts ranging from Herman Titov, who in 1961 became the second man in space, to Valeri Polakov, who spent 241 days in orbit in 1988, reveal facts that were previously suppressed about the life of astronauts before, during, and after missions. These men also divulge the equally carefully hidden dark side of the space program: the enormous fear of death as they left and returned to Earth, and the rigorous medical and psychological experiments that left many maimed for life.\n\nproducer: Maciej J.

Even though they fought on different sides, they all agree on its tragic absurdity.\n\n“Do we still need to keep talking about the war?\" is the motto of this documentary by Goran Dević, who has decided to conduct confessional interviews with three men actively involved in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Serb Novica Kostić tried his best to avoid conscription but failed. During the war he was wounded and he now recalls how easily a person can be turned into a \"killing machine.\" Rough-edged and slightly cynical Croat Narcis Misanović joined up voluntarily and was convicted after the war of the murder of 16 Serb civilians. Ivica Petrić saw his father and brother killed in front of his eyes. At the age of 11 he was already working in a military canteen and a few years later was fighting in the ranks of the Bosnian army. These interviews, recorded during car journeys, bring the fratricidal conflict home to the viewer. Even though the three fought on different sides, they all agree that the war was inhumane and absurd, and that today everybody behaves as if nothing happened.\n\nproducer: Nenad Puhovski\n\neditor: Vanja Siruček\n\ncamera: Jure Černec, Tamara Cesarec\n\nsound: Hrvoje Grill, Zlatan Čehić\n\nProduction info:\n\nFactum Documentary Film Project\n\nNova Ves 18/3\n\n10 000 Zagreb, Croatia\n\ntel.: + 385 1 48 54 821\n\ninfo@factumdocumentary.com\n\nselected filmography\n\nDon Juan: Excuse me, Miss!

The film follows his amazing journey: from saying mass in a church in Poland to life as an observant Jew in a religious kibbutz in Israel. Romuald is torn between his two identities, between being Romuald Waszkinel and being Jacob Weksler.

The role of image and media in capturing and re-telling recent history.\n\nIn the fall of 1989, history was being written across Eastern Europe, including Romania. Demonstrators in Bucharest occupied the television station and broadcast continuously for 120 hours, establishing the television studio as a new historical site. Between the day of Nicolae Ceausescu's last speech on December 21, 1989 and the first televised summary of his trial on December 26, 1989, both amateur and professional cameras recorded events at the most important locations in Bucharest. The filmmakers collected and edited the “videograms” to provide a rigorous chronology of the Romanian uprising and also to tell the story in a new media-based form of historiography. The film is built up of clips from amateur videos, official demonstration footage, and excerpts from a demonstrator-controlled Bucharest TV studio. An investigation into how the mediated image not only records but also embodies historic change.\n\nproducer: Harun Farocki\n\neditor: Egon Bunne\n\nmusic: Bobby Buchler\n\nproduction info:\n\nHarun Farocki Filmproduktion\n\nharun.farocki@farocki-film.de\n\nwww.farocki-film.de\n\nselective filmography\n\nIn Comparison (2009) / Respite (2007) / Nothing Ventured (2004) / War at a Distance (2003) / The Creators of the Shopping Worlds (2001) / Prison Images (2000) / Der Finanzchef (1998) / Worte und Spiele (1998) / The Interview (1997) / Still Life (1997) / Der Ausdruck der Hände (1997)\n\nVortex in Hungarian Panorama\n\nSzekeres Csaba / Hungary / 2010 / 75 / Hungarian\n\nUnemployment and despair in the Roma community of Told – the whirlpool of poverty and the feeble hopes of breaking out.\n\nVortex was filmed over a period of six months in the village of Told, on the border with Romania in the north-eastern part of Hungary. It captures the everyday lives of Roma families, their battle to make a living despite the harsh conditions exacerbated by unemployment, poverty, and discrimination. The film focuses on the experiences of three families, their fears of losing their children, and the ever-present challenges of finding enough food to eat and wood to heat their houses. One of Vortex’s protagonists is Juli, who is determined to leave the village at any price. Another family struggles to save their son suffering from cancer, yet another is concerned about their five-year-old who does not talk.

The power of art to transform and the alchemy of the human spirit. Audience Award, Sundance Film Festival, Berlinale, IDFA, 2010\n\nFilmed over nearly three years, Waste Land follows successful art photographer Vik Muniz as he journeys from his home base in Brooklyn to the world's largest garbage dump on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro in his native Brazil. There he photographs an eclectic band of “catadores”—self-designated pickers of recyclable materials. Muniz’s initial objective was to “paint” the catadores with garbage. However, his collaboration with these inspiring characters as they recreate photographic images of themselves out of garbage reveals both the dignity and despair of the catadores as they begin to re-imagine their lives. What begins as a search for artistic inspiration quickly develops into a deeper level of social engagement - for the artist, for the filmmaker, and for the audience. Muniz manages something that modern art rarely does: he changes their lives. Just as the garbage is transformed into art, these human rejects gain a new sense of self-worth.\n\nproducer: Angus Aynsley, Hank Levine\n\neditor: Pedro Kos\n\ncamera: Dudu Miranda\n\nsound: Patrick O’Sullivan\n\nmusic: Moby\n\nproduction info:\n\nAlmega Projects\n\nAngus Aynsley\n\ntel.: +44 207 4797 410\n\ninfo@almegaprojects.net\n\nselected filmography\n\nCountdown to Zero (2010) / Blindsight (2006) / Devil’s Playground (2002)\n\nWhen China Met Africa in International Panorama\n\nMarc Francis & Nick Francis / France & UK / 2010 / 75 min / English & Mandarin\n\nOn the front line of China’s growing presence in Africa, the lives of a Chinese farmer, a road builder, and the Zambian trade minister reveal the expanding footprint of a rising global power.\n\nWhen China Met Africa observes three men who represent different aspects of the budding relationship between China and Zambia. The Chinese propensity for hard work impresses Zambia's Trade Minister Felix Mutati, who is resolved to to secure millions of dollars of investment into the Zambian economy by providing China with every opportunity it needs to mine and build. Mr Liu is one of thousands of Chinese entrepreneurs who have settled across the continent in search of new opportunities. He has just bought his fourth farm and business is booming. His attitude resembles that of a neo-colonialist landowner as he instructs his workers from behind a fence. Engineer Li Jianguo is a project manager in northern Zambia. He is a loyal servant of the Chinese state-owned company commissioned by the Zambian government to lay a road. The intimate portrayal of these characters reveals the expanding footprint of a rising global power - pointing to a radically different future, not just for Africa, but also for the world.\n\nproducer: Marc Francis, Nick Francis\n\neditor: Hugh Williams\n\ncamera: Marc Francis\n\nsound: Nick Francis\n\nmusic: Florencia Di Concilio\n\nproduction info:\n\nSpeak-it Media Studio 2U\n\nLeroy House, 436 Essex Road\n\nLondon N1 3QP, UK\n\ntel.: +44 20 7226 0444\n\nmedia@speak-it.org\n\nwww.speak-it.org\n\nwww.whenchinametafrica.com\n\nfilmography\n\nBlack Gold (2006)\n\nWonderful Gladiators in Hungarian Panorama | Student Reviews\n\nZsófi Kabarcz / Hungary / 2011 / 52 min / Hungarian\n\nA film about the Baltazar Theatre - a unique professional theatre company in Hungary whose members are mentally challenged actors and actresses.\n\nThe Baltazar Theater is the only Hungarian professional acting group whose members are mentally challenged. The company was founded by Dóra Elek in 1998, inspired by the Belgian Théatre du Plantin. Though the actors are mentally disabled, their performance is measured by standard expectations rather than according to their abilities, so the stakes are high and the work is tough. The film follows the company during rehearsals for their new play 11 Commandments, revealing hard work, tensions and many interesting questions raised by the play itself.
