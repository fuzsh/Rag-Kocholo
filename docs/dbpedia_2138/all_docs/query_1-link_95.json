Several visits to the German Federal Archives in Berlin-Lichterfelde, Freiburg and Koblenz were necessary to be able to trace evidence of Hitler’s film viewing and interventions. Denazification files held at the State Archives in Freiburg shed light on Leni Riefenstahl. Material relating to post-war trials of the director of Jew Süss, Veit Harlan, held at the State Archives in Hamburg shed light on that film and Harlan’s involvement. The Regional Archive of North Rhine-Westphalia proved a useful source of information on Fritz Hippler, responsible for making several Nazi films, including The Eternal Jew. Berlin’s Regional Archive contains denazification material on a number of Third Reich directors and actors. Invaluable information relating to Hitler’s film viewing was also found at the Institute for Contemporary History in Munich. Foreign Office files in Berlin were also consulted, as were the Gerdy Troost papers held at the Library of Congress in Washington, which provided insights into Hitler’s involvement with the film company Bavaria. Every one of these archives provided me with all the support I could have wished for, and for this I am truly grateful. Above all I am grateful to Dr Elizabeth Ward, who acted as my research assistant x\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nwhile I was researching the book. She spent as much time in archives as I did, and identified important material. Her interest in the project meant a lot. Thanks are due also to Heather McCallum of Yale University Press for suggesting the project, and for her patience throughout: I very much appreciate her support of my work over the years. I benefited hugely both from Heather’s and Marika Lysandrou’s comments on earlier drafts of this book, as well as from those of Yale’s external readers. I would also like to thank Nottingham Trent University both for granting me research leave when it was most needed and for providing financial support. Financial support was also generously provided by the Humboldt Foundation in Germany; this enabled me to undertake an important two-week research trip to Berlin. My wife, Helena, has had to endure my various research topics over the years and, to help me with this book, she sat through several Nazi films that were, to put it mildly, not very entertaining. As often was the case in the past, her observations helped to shape my thoughts. For this, I am more grateful than I can say. Thanks, too, go to Dr Paul Moore of Leicester University for inviting me to speak on the topic of the book, and for the comments made by students and other members of the audience afterwards. They inspired me to think some matters through more thoroughly. Nottingham, May 2017\n\nxi\n\n1 Fritz Lang’s Die Nibelungen (1924) was possibly Hitler’s favourite film. The story of Siegfried, speared in the back by Hagen, resonated with Hitler because it seemed to anticipate the supposed ‘betrayal’ of the German army by democratic politicians in November 1918.\n\n2 Hitler greatly admired Greta Garbo, and he personally intervened in September 1937 to ensure that Camille, an American film starring Garbo, would be shown in German cinemas despite the fact that its director, George Cukor, was Jewish.\n\n3 Goebbels gave Hitler a present of twelve Mickey Mouse films for Christmas in 1937. Hitler was delighted by the gift. He also ordered up Mickey Mouse films through his personal adjutant, Wilhelm Brückner.\n\n4 A still from John G. Blystone’s Swiss Miss (1938), starring Laurel and Hardy, whose films Hitler greatly enjoyed. The humour of Laurel and Hardy owes much to the pre-talkies era, and Hitler, who was sceptical of film dialogue, appreciated the visuality of their films.\n\n5 Hitler welcoming the return of the Legion Condor in Berlin, 1939. Hitler provided military support to Franco in the Spanish Civil War, but kept this secret. He commissioned a film on the Legion Condor which was shown to German audiences when the Legion returned, in 1939, in an attempt to justify its involvement.\n\n6 Hitler consulting with Leni Riefenstahl at Nuremberg prior to the 1934 Nuremberg Rally. He met with Riefenstahl several times to discuss her film of this rally, Triumph of the Will, which he commissioned from her. Following the purge of the SA, Hitler needed a new rally film which would emphasise the SA’s loyalty to him.\n\n7 Scene from Leni Riefenstahl’s Triumph of the Will (1935). Riefenstahl’s second rally film, even more than her first (Victory of Faith), provided spectacular views of Hitler standing at the centre of massed Nazi organisations, suggesting a deep bond between Führer and followers.\n\n8 The premiere of Leni Riefenstahl’s Olympia, her film of the 1936 Olympic Games, at the Ufa Palace in Berlin, 20 April 1938. Nazi flags and Olympic flags hang side by side. Olympia created the illusion that Nazi Germany was a movement tolerant of the outside world.\n\n9 Hitler congratulates Riefenstahl at the premiere of Olympia in Berlin, 20 April 1938. Riefenstahl ensured that Olympia was first shown on Hitler’s birthday. This was a good marketing ploy on her part, but it also meant that the film was immediately associated with Hitler and his political interests.\n\n10 Hitler and Goebbels on the set of Gerhard Lamprecht’s film Barcarole in early 1935. It was probably during this visit to Ufa’s film studios that Hitler met Lída Baarová, a Czech actress. She may have reminded him of his half-niece Angela Raubal, who committed suicide in 1931.\n\n11 When Goebbels’ relationship with Lída Baarová threatened to ruin his exemplary Nazi marriage, Hitler insisted he break off the affair, which Goebbels reluctantly did. After Baarová left Germany for Prague, she struggled to find work in German films, and Hitler intervened in an attempt to help her out.\n\n12 A still from Victory in the West (1941), a Nazi propaganda film about the conquest of France. It was made by the army, not the Propaganda Ministry. Goebbels and Hitler took exception to its unideological celebration of the soldier’s life, and Hitler reacted by increasing Nazi propaganda within the Armed Forces.\n\n13 Otto Gebühr as Frederick the Great in Veit Harlan’s The Great King (1942). This was one of a number of Nazi ‘genius’ films, which suggested parallels between great historical figures and Hitler. Hitler used The Great King, which depicts vacillating generals, to give his own generals a dressing down.\n\n14 Ferdinand Marian as the title character in the notorious anti-Semitic feature film Jew Süss (1940), directed by Veit Harlan. Jew Süss brings to the screen many of the anti-Semitic cliches in Hitler’s My Struggle. Harlan’s film was used to support the Nazi ghettoisation, deportation and genocide of Jews.\n\n15 Advertising for the Nazi ‘documentary’ The Eternal Jew (1940). Images from it and Jew Süss ‘were endlessly replicated in Nazi anti-Semitic posters or publications, all over the Reich and occupied Europe’ (Saul Friedländer). The Eternal Jew includes an excerpt from Hitler’s 30 January 1939 speech threatening the annihilation of the Jews.\n\n16 Hitler in the last Nazi newsreel, March 1945. Over the course of the war, Hitler became more and more reluctant to show himself in Nazi newsreels: he was afraid audiences would notice signs of ill health. Here, he is seen receiving members of the Hitler Youth. The newsreel implies that the Reich’s defence now depends on youngsters.\n\n17 Henny Porten, one of Hitler’s favourite actresses. She had made a deep impression on Hitler when he saw her for the first time on screen while on leave in Lille during the First World War. During the Third Reich, she refused to divorce her ‘half-Jewish’ husband Wilhelm von Kaufmann-Asser, and appealed to Hitler for help.\n\nxii\n\nIntroduction\n\nHitler’s interest in the arts has in key respects been exhaustively documented: there are studies about the books Hitler read,1 about his preoccupation with architecture,2 and about his passion for Wagnerian Opera.3 His personal involvement in the Great German Art Exhibitions between 1937 and 1944 is well known.4 We know much about his personal taste in art.5 The interior design of Hitler’s domestic space has also been expertly investigated.6 Much less, however, is known about his interest in film. A typical view can be found in Frederic Spotts’ classic study about Hitler’s attitude to the arts, which informs us that, while Hitler enjoyed watching movies, he had no interest in film as an art form and ‘left it to Joseph Goebbels to exploit cinema for propaganda purposes’.7 This view is reflected implicitly in the numerous studies of film in the Third Reich. Due consideration has been given by scholars to the crucial role of ‘Film Minister’ and Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels,8 and of the Propaganda Ministry more generally, in steering the Nazi film industry.9 In this context, reference is usually made to Hitler’s film viewing, his expectations of film and his occasional film censorship.10 There have also been important publications on the American film industry and its reaction to 1\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\nNazism, in which mention of Hitler’s interest in film is made.11 But the impression one gains from most books on the Third Reich film industry is that there would be little to be learned by examining Hitler’s involvement more closely.12 This book sets out to show that, in fact, much can be learned from doing so. My argument is not that Hitler was more important than Goebbels when it came to overseeing film production. I am claiming, however, that Hitler was more than a passive consumer of feature films, watched night after night at his mountain residence, the Berghof. At a number of points during the Third Reich, Hitler directly or indirectly encouraged the creation of Nazi films that promoted his political visions and agendas. Hitler well understood the persuasive power of film. In My Struggle, he wrote: ‘in a much shorter time, at one stroke I might say, people will understand a pictorial presentation of something which it would take them a long and laborious effort of reading to understand’.13 More than Goebbels, Hitler believed feature film directors should be given a chance to make documentary films. Real events were to be filmed not just with the right dose of propaganda, but also with the aesthetics and dramatic techniques of feature film so that the political message could be conveyed to maximum effect. Hitler also stepped in on several occasions to ban films, allow them when a ban was looming, or ask for changes. These interventions, to be sure, were sporadic, and usually occurred because Goebbels consulted with Hitler over controversial films. That they occurred, however, demonstrates that Hitler was the ultimate arbiter in film matters. His decisions for or against films were motivated by a range of considerations: ideological, political, diplomatic and military. This book points to an apparent contrast. Privately, Hitler consumed all manner of films, from the epic to the trivial, and not just German ones. In public, for the most part at least, he wanted to be associated only with films carrying a serious political message. Private film viewings suggest the lazy armchair consumer, his attendance of film showings in public suggests the robust ideologue. At least in the pre-war period, there is evidence that Hitler privately watched 2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nand sometimes enjoyed films either made by or starring Jews (or both). Occasionally, he saw to it that certain actors with Jewish spouses or of a Jewish background, actors he admired, were to a degree protected from the effects of Nazi anti-Semitism, even as he was calling for Goebbels to produce more anti-Semitic films. And, while Hitler enjoyed American films in private, and quite probably watched Gone with the Wind (1939) after American films had been banned from German cinemas, in public he pronounced a strong dislike of American culture. Film, for Hitler, was trivia and entertainment on the one hand, and a vehicle for supporting Nazi ideology on the other. Hitler seldom talked about film in his public pronouncements. His speeches on the subject of culture – notably at the Nazi Party rallies – often avoided concrete references to individual cultural products. Instead, he spoke in lofty and vague terms about art, architecture, sculpture, music and theatre, though rarely film. His engagement in the Great German Art Exhibitions, his architectural commissions, not least for the New Reich Chancellery building, and his plans for rebuilding Berlin generally (‘Germania’) seem to confirm his greater interest in art and architecture. Yet he probably spent as much, if not more time watching films than poring over architectural plans. And in commissioning Leni Riefenstahl’s Nazi Party rally films, he had, arguably, more success than he ever did with the German Art Exhibitions. So disappointed was Hitler in the products of Nazi art that ‘he could not even bear to have the paintings around him’.14 Riefenstahl’s Nazi-period films were much more to his liking. During the first years of the war, Hitler personally monitored every weekly newsreel before it reached cinema screens. In doing so, he ensured the newsreels showed what he wanted, and were provided with the commentary he considered the most appropriate. But he was not just thinking of the present: the newsreels were to be a lasting document of what he hoped would be the triumph of Nazism. Hitler regarded the representation of Nazism in celluloid as a gift to the future. Nazi art is now largely forgotten; ‘Germania’ remained a pipe dream, and the New Reich Chancellery was 3\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\ndemolished. Riefenstahl’s films, however, as well as any number of Nazi weekly newsreels and other Nazi films with which Hitler is associated, are widely available today on the internet or on DVD. No other aspect of Nazism’s artistic legacy enjoys the dubious privilege of such wide circulation in the present. It is time, then, to explore the importance of film for Hitler. The opening chapter begins by looking at Hitler’s private film-viewing habits, and by asking to what extent film might have influenced him. It then examines the numerous claims about Hitler’s ‘favourite film’. One has to tread carefully here, as clear evidence is hard to come by. And, while some candidates for ‘favourite film’ do seem likelier than others, in the end what matters, perhaps, is not so much Hitler’s supposed preference for individual films as the fact of his seemingly limitless consumption of whatever films the Propaganda Ministry was able to provide. The eclecticism of his film tastes is what is striking. While Chapter 1 looks at Hitler as film consumer, the focus of Chapter 2 is on his film politics. It explores his reasons for banning, or resisting the imposition of a ban, on specific films. The second part of the chapter analyses two of Hitler’s most significant film interventions: his commissioning of documentary films on the sterilization of the disabled (Victims of the Past, 1937) and on the Spanish Civil War (In Battle against the World Enemy, 1939). Hitler, then, was centrally involved in the gestation of two important Nazi film projects promoting ideas fundamental to his worldview: the need to ‘protect’ the Germans against the mentally and physically handicapped, and to resist the global aspirations of Bolshevism. Chapter 2 ends with a discussion of a different kind of intervention: Hitler’s commitment to large-scale film-related building projects. The Reich was to have a truly representative film studio and cinema to reflect the status Hitler accorded to film. Chapters 3 and 4 turn attention towards a much better-known set of film commissions by Hitler: Leni Riefenstahl’s Nazi Party rally films Victory of Faith (1933) and Triumph of the Will (1935), and her film of the 1936 4\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBerlin Olympics, Olympia (1938).15 After the Nazis attained power in January 1933, several feature films depicting the defeat of communism reached German cinema screens. But such films soon outlived their usefulness, as the Nazis consolidated their control over Germany and political conflict became a thing of the past. Hitler personally gave the highest priority to the filming of an event which more than any other was intended to symbolize the end to national strife. The 1933 and 1934 Nuremberg Rallies called for Germans, literally, to rally round the Nazi leader in disciplined formations. Hitler wanted the message of the rallies to be conveyed on cinema screens across the country. As the Riefenstahl chapters show, Hitler arranged for her films to be financed, thereby ensuring she did what he wanted. Olympia may appear to be a tribute to the international spirit of world Olympics, but Hitler did not ask Riefenstahl to make it for this reason. Her film was conceived by Hitler as a form of masquerade: it would help to conceal Nazism’s real character, its plans for European hegemony and racial war. Hitler used the cinema in a variety of ways to promote Nazism. Chapter 5 looks at his visits to German cinemas. For the most part, he only showed himself in cinemas when films with politics or political subtexts with which he wished to be associated were running. Such visits conferred an official seal of approval on particular films, and were stage-managed so that the films concerned were explicitly harnessed to the wagon of Nazi propaganda. For Hitler and Goebbels, the cinema was not just about entertainment, it was also a political space. Cinemas became auditoriums for the broadcasting of Hitler’s speeches, and Hitler was, of course, shown in weekly newsreels and a variety of documentaries, with figures resembling Hitler in one way or another also being a characteristic of Nazi feature films. While Chapter 5 demonstrates how the cinema was mobilized to immerse audiences in the sight and sound of Hitler, Chapter 6 looks at the way actors were mobilized by Hitler. Actors, especially actresses, were frequent guests at Hitler’s private soirées. When Goebbels found the films shown on such occasions dull, he consoled himself with the fact that 5\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\nthe company was attractive: ‘at the Führer’s. Films, as always. Rubbish! But the women were nice!’16 However, there was more to Hitler’s cultivation of actresses than the wish to be surrounded by pretty women.17 The attention he and Goebbels lavished on actors generally was designed to secure their loyalty, a loyalty they were expected to demonstrate in a variety of ways, from appearing at diplomatic receptions to participating in propaganda films. It is unlikely, however, that Hitler, in contrast to Goebbels, had sexual relations with actresses. The chapter ends with a discussion of Goebbels’ relationship with the Czech actress Lída Baarová. Hitler’s reaction to Baarová, and to Goebbels’ infatuation with her, illustrates the clear difference between him and his propaganda minister when it came to affairs. This book is divided into two halves. Chapters 1 to 6, with one or two exceptions where developments discussed span the pre-war and war period, focus on the peacetime years of Hitler’s rule, 1933–39. The remaining four chapters concentrate on the war years. One reason for this division was practical. Thematic chapters running from 1933 to 1945 would have been impossibly long; and I wanted to spare the reader the effort of having to repeatedly think her or his way back from the end of the war to the beginning of the Third Reich. There is also a conceptual reason for the division into pre-war and wartime chapters. Obviously, life changed fundamentally with the start of the Second World War. It changed in the world of film, too – not least for Hitler himself. As Chapter 7 shows, Hitler radically reduced his private feature film viewing, and stopped watching films in German cinemas, from the day the Nazis invaded Poland. But he kept an eagle eye on the production of German documentaries about the Nazi war effort, notably the films Campaign in Poland (1940) and Victory in the West (1941). Chapter 8, in turn, shows that he also kept very much in touch with the production of anti-Semitic films, the most notorious of which were the feature film Jew Süss (1940) and the Nazi ‘documentary’ film The Eternal Jew (1940). A lot has been written about these films,18 but Hitler was more central to their creation than is commonly assumed. They reached German 6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ncinemas in late 1940, just as the Nazi radicalization of anti-Semitic policy was developing towards genocide. The chapter explores the impact of Jew Süss on German and non-German audiences. Its dissemination accompanied Hitler’s genocidal programme at each of its stages. After 1 September 1939, then, Hitler’s preoccupation with film became bound up with the Nazi war in one way or another. This is underscored by his regular previewing of the weekly Wochenschau, or newsreel, the focus of Chapter 9. Hitler, as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, took it upon himself to personally vet the newsreel coverage of events.19 After defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, as it became harder and harder to provide images of German military success, Hitler gradually lost interest in the newsreels.20 And as his health deteriorated, so he became less and less willing to show himself in them. For years, film footage of Hitler had been an essential part of Nazi documentaries and newsreels, which sought to convey the impression that the Führer was indispensable. Again and again it was stressed that he was committed to defending the Reich against a host of enemies – and that Nazism was about self-defence was a message Hitler encouraged in the film projects in which he was involved. Hitler’s withdrawal from the newsreels as of 1943 left some German cinemagoers, at least, feeling abandoned and rudderless. The final chapter returns to the subject of actors. Convinced of the importance of film for both relaxation and propaganda during a gruelling war, Hitler ensured that many of Germany’s leading actors were exempted from military service; they returned the favours bestowed upon them by doing their bit to help prosecute Hitler’s war. The current book is not about Nazi film production: there are already several studies on that topic, or key aspects of it.21 However, the second half of the chapter, like the concluding section of Chapter 5, looks closely at important Nazi propaganda films to demonstrate how they reflected the range of Hitler’s ideology and how flexible they could prove, adaptable to the situations in which they were deployed. Right to the end of the war, Goebbels did all he 7\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\ncould to keep the film industry going, despite the effects of Allied bombing. On 30 January 1945, Hitler’s final speech to the nation on the radio calling for determined resistance against the enemy coincided with the premiere of the final Nazi cinema blockbuster, Kolberg, about Germans holding out against the French during the Napoleonic wars. Almost to the very end, Hitler’s politics and Nazi film worked together.\n\n8\n\n1\n\nFilms at the Berghof HITLER’S HOME CINEMA\n\nBetween 1933 and September 1939, Hitler spent a considerable amount of time watching feature films. He watched films in the Reich Chancellery in Berlin, and above all at his Bavarian residence, the Berghof. There is even evidence he planned to have a film projection unit installed in his car by the firm Telefunken.1 Hitler was, as his bodyguard and courier Rochus Misch put it, a ‘film addict’.2 He watched adventure films, crime thrillers, film dramas, historical epics, musicals, revue films, comedies, romance films, westerns, cartoons – anything. Some of his film preferences we might expect; others are surprising. Hitler the private film-viewer indulged the passive, lazy side of his nature, but he also cultivated international tastes. Ideological reflexes sometimes determined his responses, but often he allowed himself to appreciate film as film. This was a Hitler the German public did not know.\n\nThe Evidence Hitler’s film viewing is testified to by those who worked for or knew him. Julius Schaub, Hitler’s adjutant and general factotum, writes of the almost 9\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\nincontrovertible routine of Hitler’s day, in which film played a central role. Hitler would sleep all morning, getting up in time to greet his guests for lunch. After eating, everyone would walk to the Kleines Teehaus, which lay to the south of the Berghof. During this outing, Hitler would present himself to the public, standing under a specially planted tree on the approach road to the Berghof (he couldn’t take the sun). He would shake hands and let himself be photographed. At the Teehaus, after refreshments, there was usually a siesta between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. Then it was back to the Berghof for the evening meal. Every day until the eve of war, according to Schaub, films were shown after dinner, and Hitler watched every one of them.3 Schaub once remarked to film director Veit Harlan that he, Harlan, should not imagine that Schaub’s life was fun: ‘Last night,’ Schaub said, ‘I had to watch three – yes, three! – films, and this morning another one. And that on an empty stomach. The Führer has got unbelievable stamina when it comes to films. Unfortunately I am not remotely interested in them. Believe me, I’m living in a golden cage, and I will never escape to freedom.’4 Schaub also had to endure Hitler’s passion for Wagner. Christa Schroeder, a personal secretary of Hitler, relates that Hitler’s entire entourage fell asleep during a performance of Tristan and Isolde. When Hitler’s photographer Heinrich Hoffmann began to slump over the balustrade of the proscenium box, Hitler had to wake Schaub to get him to wake Hoffmann; Chief Adjutant Brückner continued snoring in the background.5 Ernst Hanfstaengl, Hitler’s confidant before he fell out of favour, later recalled that Hitler’s favourite evening pastime was watching films.6 Hitler’s valets, Heinz Linge and Karl Wilhelm Krause, make mention of the Führer’s extensive film-watching habits in their memoirs,7 as does Berghof manager Herbert Döhring in his.8 Schaub was not the only one to suffer under Hitler’s obsession. Heinrich Hoffmann bemoaned the fact that Hitler – as with his favourite pieces of music – ‘delighted to have endlessly repeated those [films] that had pleased him; and when I was staying with him, I had no option but to watch them too’.9 Fritz Wiedemann, Hitler’s personal adjutant until 1939, had sympathy for Hitler’s need for distraction, but why, 10\n\nFILMS AT THE BERGHOF\n\nhe later asked in his memoirs, did this have to take the form of films? ‘The year has 365 days, and there were not many days on which there were no film showings.’10 The atmosphere at Hitler’s private movie evenings was invariably relaxed. Valet Heinz Linge writes that, in contrast to a public cinema, there was no church-like silence during the viewings: those present made lively comment, and there was often much laughter.11 According to Albert Speer, Hitler usually sat next to Eva Braun, and to other female guests, with whom he would engage in whispered conversation. Sometimes he would stare broodily into the open fire of the Berghof ’s Great Hall, where the films were shown. At such moments, everyone else would fall silent so as not to disturb him in his ‘significant thoughts’.12 Unlike Stalin, who liked to issue instructions concerning the Soviet film industry and ideology in general when watching films, Hitler, during the showings themselves at least, refrained from such direct interventions.13 Speer reports that viewings frequently went on for three to four hours, so at least two films were shown on many occasions. While others emerged stiff and numb from these lengthy sessions, Hitler, remembers Speer, seemed revitalized, and liked to discuss the performances of the actors (or, rather, actresses, while Eva Braun held forth on the male actors) before moving on to other conversation topics.14 Stalin watched films with his inner circle in the Kremlin cinema. Hitler preferred the environment of his home or the Reich Chancellery. At the Berghof, the cinema screen was concealed behind a Gobelin tapestry on one side of the Great Hall, while the projection unit was hidden away behind another tapestry on the other side, directly opposite. The hall was known for its massive panorama window, which could be lowered and ‘was intended to open up monumental views of the surrounding landscape’.15 The tapestries, in turn, could be raised to allow the world of artifice and make-believe to enter Hitler’s home;16 afterwards, the tapestries returned to their original positions, and the Great Hall was restored to its function as reception and meeting room. The room’s double purpose reflected the two sides to Hitler’s life, sides that unfolded in the same physical space, yet were kept separate. The film showings were nevertheless usually a social occasion. Hitler did 11\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\nsometimes watch films alone, or with his adjutants and valets. Karl Wilhelm Krause relates that, when Hitler was in a bad mood, he asked for an amusing film to be shown, such as Gustav Ucicky’s 1937 film of Heinrich von Kleist’s famous play, The Broken Jug.17 Most of the time, though, the film showings were part of the Berghof ’s after-dinner social calendar. Hitler would entertain himself and his guests with a film or two of his own choosing. At some point during dinner, Krause would present Hitler with a menu of ‘four to six films from Germany and abroad’. This list was often compiled from films just received from the Propaganda Ministry. Hitler then made his choice.18 If a film displeased him, he had it stopped, and asked for another one (regardless, it seems, of the opinion of the gathering). Among the guests were Nazi leaders and their wives, as well as actors and film directors. The Berghof ’s staff were also invited to watch the films. In fact, Krause claims it was Hitler’s express wish that they attend, both at the Berghof and in Berlin.19 Hitler clearly believed in the beneficial effects of cinema on those working for him. Therese Linke, Hitler’s cook, recalled that a cinema was constructed from wood for the many workers employed around the Berghof; there were free showings three times a week.20 Anna Plaim, who worked as a maid at the Berghof, also remembers a cinema for the soldiers stationed there. The film showings were organized by the Nazi leisure organization Strength Through Joy.21 Goebbels’ diaries frequently comment on his film viewings with Hitler, particularly in the years after the Nazis came to power. Mostly, they watched contemporary German films, but American films also featured. In March 1934, for instance, they watched Frank Lloyd’s film Cavalcade (USA, 1933), a sweeping historical epic covering the 1899–1933 period and addressing events such as the Boer War and the sinking of the Titanic. Hitler and Goebbels must have enjoyed it, because they watched it again in May 1934.22 And, in April 1934, they watched Gregory La Cava’s Gabriel over the White House (1933). One might have expected Hitler to admire a film depicting the dissolution of Congress and the apparent establishment of a dictatorship in the USA. According to one film scholar, 12\n\nFILMS AT THE BERGHOF\n\nGabriel over the White House was ‘the first major fascist motion picture’.23 But Goebbels reports that Hitler did not quite know what to make of it: he found it too ‘theoretical’ and ‘modern’, an indication perhaps that Hitler believed the most effective form of political cinema to be one that relied more on image than voice.24 Further evidence of Hitler’s film viewing is provided by the extensive correspondence between Hitler’s adjutants and the Propaganda Ministry regarding the sending and return of films. This correspondence was conducted, to judge at least from extant records at Berlin’s Federal Archives, between January 1936 and July 1939. Most of the films sent on by the ministry were those that had recently become available, either in Germany or abroad: Hitler kept up to speed with new or forthcoming releases. Occasionally, he explicitly asked for particular films to be acquired. One of these was Carl Lamac’s The Hound of the Baskervilles (1937), which Hitler wanted to be permanently available at the Berghof.25 Hitler is known for his dismissal of occult and mystical trends within National Socialism, but this did not stop him admiring The Hound of the Baskervilles or Hans Deppe’s 1934 film The Rider on the White Horse, another film in the Berghof archives. The gloomy supernaturalism of both films clearly appealed to him.\n\nHitler’s Likes and Dislikes Apart from the occasional reference to Hitler’s opinions of films in Goebbels’ diaries, the only explicit source we have for these are notes taken by Hitler’s adjutants over the 1938–39 period.26 These were passed on to the Propaganda Ministry in terse, even monosyllabic terms, usually in the form of ‘good’ or ‘bad’, or variations thereof. On 24 April 1939, for instance, the ordnance officer Ludwig Bahls informed the ministry that Hitler had found Josef von Báky’s light-hearted 1939 film The Stars of Variety ‘good’, and Veit Harlan’s The Immortal Heart (1939), about the assumed inventor of the watch, Peter Henlein, ‘very good’. By contrast, Peter Paul Brauer’s comedy I’ll Be Back in a Minute (1939) was considered ‘not particularly good’. 13\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\nHitler took strong exception to Paul Martin’s romantic comedy Woman at the Wheel (1939) starring Lilian Harvey and Willy Fritsch. He dismissed it as ‘very bad, disgusting’. He did not like Tarzan, either – it was ‘bad’: whether this was the original 1932 film or a later one is not clear. Bahls also reports that Hitler broke off the showing of a 1934 film, Prosperity Crooks, directed by Fritz Kampers, because it was ‘bad’.27 On occasion, Hitler’s adjutants report simply that Hitler ‘left the room’. Film scholars can only be disappointed by such brief comments. What exactly might have constituted a ‘bad’ as opposed to a ‘very bad’ film, for Hitler? Occasionally, at least, Hitler’s adjutants do provide reasons why Hitler liked or disliked a film. The reasons are as briefly noted as Hitler’s overall assessment, yet they do tell us one thing: Hitler did not always or only judge films by their contents. On 19 July 1938, after spending part of the day with Unity Mitford, his English admirer, Hitler watched Herbert Selpin’s I Love You (1938), a comedy starring Viktor de Kowa and Luise Ullrich. In the film, a ladykiller is outsmarted by the woman he wants to seduce. It would be tempting to see in Hitler’s choice of evening viewing an indication of romantic interest in Mitford, but all we know for certain is that Hitler liked I Love You because it was ‘well acted’.28 And, in fact, this expression of approval occurs several times. On 13 June 1939, Bahls told the Propaganda Ministry that Hitler had found three films ‘well acted’: Fritz Peter Buch’s Detours to Happiness (1939), a light comedy about a philandering husband; Carl Boese’s Hello Janine (1939), a ‘Revuefilm’ (a musical with dance elements) with Marika Rökk; and the more serious Border Fire (1939), a feature film about smuggling, directed by Alois Lippl.29 Hitler at times distinguished the quality of the acting from that of the film, as in the case of the 1938 German-Spanish production Nights in Andalusia, a musical directed by Herbert Maisch, and starring Argentinian actress Imperio Argentina; he praised her performance while dismissing the film as ‘bad’.30 On a typical whim, Hitler, an admirer of Imperio Argentina, ordered the Propaganda Ministry in April 1937 to ‘win her over’ for the German film industry.31 She proved a costly 14\n\nFILMS AT THE BERGHOF\n\nacquisition, arriving from Havana complete with car and chauffeur, and posing huge wage demands.32 Soon, the German film industry was trying to avoid engaging her.33 Hitler was also a fan of boxer Max Schmeling’s actress-wife Anny Ondra. He lamented that Hans Deppe’s Fools in the Snow (1938) was ‘not particularly good’ and had made little of Ondra’s acting skills.34 Hitler appreciated good acting and a director’s ability to bring out an actor’s talents. He had, after all, himself learnt to act. In 1932, he had taken voice training lessons from the singer Paul Devrient.35 Devrient had also taught Hitler the importance of gesture, rhythm and rhetoric. Hitler’s response to film, then, was often informed by an interest in the effectiveness of performance. Indeed, when he criticized Hans Steinhoff ’s film Dance on the Volcano (1938), it was not because it appeared to call for revolution (albeit in nineteenth-century France), but because he did not like either the directing or Gustaf Gründgens’ acting.36 We cannot always assume that Hitler’s dislike of a film was grounded in a rejection of its ideas, narrative or milieu. Other factors may have played a part. On 15 September 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain made his way to Germany to meet with Hitler to discuss the Sudetenland crisis. After negotiations at the Berghof, in the course of which Hitler appeared to retreat from his intention to resolve the Sudeten issue if necessary by means of violence,37 Hitler relaxed by watching the film Four Apprentices (1938). It was directed by Carl Froelich, one of Hitler’s favourite directors, and starred the young and talented Ingrid Bergman. Yet Hitler did not like the film.38 His mood may not have been the best after the discussions with Chamberlain. Perhaps he disliked it because it depicts the attempt by four women to prove that their function in life is not simply to serve as housewives, but then, at the end, they all end up hitched. On 16 September, Hitler continued to discuss the Sudetenland, this time with Konrad Henlein, the leader of the Sudeten German Party, and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. In the evening, he sat down to watch Robert Stemmle’s By a Silken Thread (1938), a German film about a prisoner of war who returns to Germany from Japanese internment after the First World War and invests in the 15\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\nproduction of artificial silk. One would have expected such a theme to appeal to Hitler, who, after all, had committed the National Socialists to an economic programme of autarky. But Hitler found By a Silken Thread ‘not good’.39 Perhaps, then, the Sudeten crisis was indeed clouding his mood. But he could still appreciate the 1932 German romantic comedy Cheeky Devil, directed by Carl Boese, which he watched on 17 September.40 Interpreting his reactions as noted by his adjutants remains a difficult task. Surviving lists of films kept at the Berghof do tell us something about Hitler’s film tastes, which, on this evidence, are both predictable and surprising. Some of the listed films conform completely to Hitler’s ideological expectations. In December 1937, Goebbels gave Hitler a present of thirty-two films ‘from the last four years’ of German (and Austrian) film production.41 If anyone knew Hitler’s film preferences well, it was Goebbels, and he will have been sure to give Hitler films the latter admired. The titles found their way into a ‘List of Archive Films’.42 One of the films was the feature film The Higher Command (1935, directed by Gerhard Lamprecht), about an attempt by an English lord to forge a treaty between Austria, England and Poland against Napoleonic France. It could be read as providing historical support for Hitler’s post-1933 diplomacy, which aimed at isolating France and forming alliances (e.g. the 1934 German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact) to undermine its interests. Goebbels also gave Hitler a copy of Veit Harlan’s The Ruler (1937), celebrating an autocratic industrialist, and of Carl Froelich’s schoolteacher drama The Dreamer (1936). The Dreamer ends with a call to youth to ‘steel and overcome themselves’ for the future, a message of which Hitler would have approved. A second list of films kept at the Berghof, the ‘List of Permanent Stock’ from 1935,43 contains a number of Frederick the Great films, one of which, Hans Steinhoff ’s The Old and the Young King (1935), was also on Goebbels’ list. From the mid1930s, Hitler could regularly draw, at home, on filmic representations of Frederick whenever he needed to reinforce his sense of identification with him.44 At such moments, it must have seemed to Hitler as if these Frederick films had been made just for his own private consumption, allowing him 16\n\nFILMS AT THE BERGHOF\n\nprivileged historical access. The ‘List of Permanent Stock’ also includes Nazi classics such as Franz Seitz’s Storm Trooper Brand (1933), depicting the SA’s (the Nazi Storm Troopers’) fight against communism, and Hans Steinhoff ’s Mother and Child (1934), centring on the triumph of the maternal bond. Other films kept at the Berghof, however, suggest a more unbuttoned Hitler. When Goebbels gave Hitler his present of films in 1937, it was supplemented with twelve Walt Disney Mickey Mouse films: ‘He is delighted,’ Goebbels confided to his diary: ‘he is so happy about this treasure, which, I hope, will give him much joy and help him to relax.’45 Goebbels also included in his present a copy of Willi Forst’s Masquerade (1934), which he knew Hitler liked.46 Masquerade was an Austrian operetta film, the plot of which turned around the question of who acted as a model for a near-nude portrait. Set in 1905, the film simultaneously celebrates and gently satirizes the decadence of fin-de-siècle middle-class Vienna. Hitler could react allergically to films that celebrated Austrianness.47 But he clearly admired Masquerade. The ‘List of Permanent Stock’ also contains surprises. Among the films listed are several Weimar Republic films, such as F.W. Murnau’s silent classics Faust (1926) and Tabu (1931), a semidocumentary film set on the South Sea island of Bora Bora. Leontine Sagan’s 1931 film Girls in Uniform is the biggest surprise. Set in a girls’ boarding school run in accordance with a strict regimen, its lesbian undertones and critique of the Prussian education system led to it being banned in the Third Reich, but not from the Berghof. Hitler admired films about Frederick the Great, yet could also appreciate Girls in Uniform, in which the autocratic and unpleasant school director, with her walking stick, is clearly meant to embody a female equivalent of Frederick. Hitler’s interest in Weimar Republic film is a recurring theme. When the Reich Chancellery in Berlin sent on a list of films to the Berghof in the summer of 1937, Hitler’s secretary Bormann wrote back to say Hitler did not want a list of films currently running, but of films ‘from the earlier period, that is to say from the time between the end of the war until about 1932’.48 The 17\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\nChancellery duly obliged, and Bormann requested seventeen films presumably at Hitler’s bidding.49 The majority of these were German, and mostly lighter fare, such as Kurt Gerron’s A Mad Idea (1932), about a Munich painter, or Hanns Schwarz’s film operetta Monte Carlo Madness (1931), starring Hans Albers and Heinz Rühmann.50 For all his public dismissal of the culture of the Weimar Republic, in private, Hitler consumed the Republic’s film production constantly. There are other discrepancies. He admired Masquerade despite the fact that it starred Adolf Wohlbrück. Wohlbrück left Austria in the course of the 1930s; he was an anti-Nazi, a homosexual and would have been classified by the Nazis as ‘half-Jewish’. Hitler’s public condemnation of the supposed dominance of Jews in German culture did not stop him appreciating their artistic gifts, or ordering up films directed by Jews. Kurt Gerron was Jewish; he fled the Nazis in 1933, only to be murdered in Auschwitz in 1944.51 The Austrian-Hungarian director Leontine Sagan was of Jewish descent. Billy Wilder, a Jew who fled the Nazis 1933, wrote the script for Emil and the Detectives (1931), another of the films on the ‘Permanent Stock’ list. Hitler’s pronounced anti-Americanism was similarly shelved when it came to private film viewing. We can be sure he watched the twelve Mickey Mouse films Goebbels gave him in December 1937. In fact, Hitler had already ordered up five Mickey Mouse films for the Berghof through his chief adjutant Brückner in July 1937.52 There is no clear record of whether Hitler watched any Charlie Chaplin films. But he was a fan of Laurel and Hardy. Hitler’s adjutants record at least three viewings of Laurel and Hardy films: in June 1938, Hitler watched and enjoyed Way Out West (1937, directed by James W. Horne) and Swiss Miss (1938, directed by John G. Blystone), and, in November 1938, Hitler viewed and appreciated Block-Heads (1938, also directed by John Blystone).53 Block-Heads he found good because of its ‘nice ideas and funny jokes’.54 One can imagine Hitler sympathizing with its opening scene, in which we see Stan Laurel still patrolling a First World War trench twenty years after the war has finished. The message here – that, for some, the war has never ended – is 18\n\nFILMS AT THE BERGHOF\n\none Hitler would have well understood.55 Hitler’s appreciation of Laurel and Hardy demonstrates his approval of strongly visual cinema, cinema still rooted in the pre-talkies era – which the three films cited certainly are, for all their dialogue. His appreciation of German-made films from the pre-1933 era, many of them silent, stems from the same approval, and his seeming dislike of dialogue.\n\nHitler’s Favourite Film It is tempting to try to identify, among the films Hitler watched, the one he liked the most. That would make it possible, in theory, to get a sense of exactly what he expected film, in an ideal scenario, to achieve. It might also make it possible to gain some deeper insight into Hitler’s psychology, if one accepts – and this is a big if – that one film can somehow explain Hitler. Accordingly, various suggestions have been made as to what Hitler’s ‘favourite film’ was. Unfortunately, none of these is really convincing. One candidate, according to a quick search on Google, is the Walt Disney production Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). This suggestion may have something to do with the influence of Kate Atkinson’s 2013 novel Life after Life, where Hitler is a fan of Snow White: he sees himself ‘as the saviour of Germany, and poor Germany, his Schneewittchen, would be saved by him whether she wanted it or not’.56 In 2008, the director of a Norwegian Museum claimed to have discovered cartoons showing characters from Snow White that had been drawn by Hitler during the Second World War.57 This turned out, not surprisingly, to be a hoax,58 but the claim nevertheless helped to sustain the notion that Snow White had some kind of special meaning for Hitler. Snow White, with its death potion and notions of magical rebirth, is certainly close to the Wagnerian world Hitler inhabited, and it tells a tale of jealousy and wickedness confronting true beauty, corresponding perhaps to Hitler’s understanding of post-Versailles Germany as a country beleaguered by the hostility of inner and outer enemies. Yet we have no clear evidence Hitler ever saw Snow White. It was ordered for the Berghof in February 1938 and 19\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\nwas expected to arrive in two or three weeks, but we cannot assume from this that it did. And even then, we have no trustworthy record of what Hitler thought of it.59 Precisely the same constellation of speculation and lack of evidence obtains in the case of another film that was rumoured to be Hitler’s favourite: Merian C. Cooper’s King Kong (1933). In his 1970 autobiography, Ernst Hanfstaengl, once a friend of Hitler, wrote: ‘one of Hitler’s favourite films was King Kong, as we all know the story of a giant ape who falls in love with a woman no bigger than his hand and goes berserk over her. A terrible story, but Hitler was fascinated by it. Hitler often talked about it and watched it often.’60 In 2015, the German historian Volker Koop published a book called Why Hitler Loved King Kong but Banned Mickey Mouse. King Kong stares menacingly at the reader from its cover.61 Koop speculates as to why Hitler loved King Kong. Was it because of the film’s superb use of trick photography? Did the attractive Fay Wray appeal to him in the role of the helpless victim? Or did the melodramatic downfall of King Kong move him?62 The Bavarian writer Herbert Rosendorfer – perhaps tongue-in-cheek – even claims that Hitler saw King Kong at least 300 times, the last time being in the Reich Chancellery in April 1945.63 Yet, as with Snow White, we have no reliable evidence that Hitler ever saw King Kong, nor has his opinion of it been passed down if he did. Given his massive grudge against Hitler, Hanfstaengl is not the most trustworthy of witnesses. In February 1937, fed up with Hanfstaengl’s proneness to exaggeration and with his negative comments about the German troops fighting for Franco in the Spanish Civil War, Goebbels and Hitler played a practical joke on him by making him believe he was to be dropped behind enemy lines in Spain. Hanfstaengl thought he had fallen prey to an assassination attempt.64 His autobiography takes revenge by, among other details, associating Hitler with a film about a monster ape. It is possible, of course, that Hitler watched King Kong. It is possible he saw in the threatened purity of Ann Darrow an analogy with Germany or with the German race. Hitler was a self-declared animal-lover.65 Hans Baur, 20\n\nFILMS AT THE BERGHOF\n\nHitler’s pilot, recalls that Hitler would cover up his eyes when films showing animal hunting were being shown, asking to be told ‘when it was all over’. Then again, the ostensibly squeamish Hitler liked films sent to him by a ‘friendly Maharajah’ that showed ‘men being torn to pieces by the animals they had set out to hunt’.66 This suggests a liking on Hitler’s part for that moment when the hunted becomes the hunter, the victim the aggressor, where the captive goes berserk – themes in King Kong, and leitmotifs in Hitler’s understanding of Germany’s relationship with its neighbours, who had imposed upon it the ‘shackles’ of the Versailles Treaty. But it is worth stressing that the German censors at the time objected to King Kong on the grounds that it violated ‘German racial sentiment’ by portraying the love of a gorilla for a white-skinned woman.67 In the end, that Snow White and King Kong should be thought of as Hitler’s favourites tells us more about us than Hitler. Behind these suppositions is a desire to find the answer to Hitler in an archetypal fairy story about innocence and evil, or a morality tale about the danger posed to civilization by its failure to control destructive primordial energies. Psychohistorian Robert Waite tells of an ‘experienced analyst’ who, in connection with Hitler’s supposed admiration for King Kong, claimed it was ‘easy to read Hitler as the huge gorilla – but he was only that in part. He was also, at the same time, the helpless sweet little blonde.’68 Hitler’s obsession with the film, in other words, can be traced to a psychopathic sadomasochism. To say this is drawing rather large conclusions from very little evidence would be an understatement. Of all the films thought to be Hitler’s favourite, the most serious candidate is surely the silent two-part epic The Nibelungs (1924). Hitler’s photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann, claimed to have seen this film with Hitler ‘at least 20 times’.69 Goebbels describes Hitler as being deeply impressed by The Nibelungs.70 Given Hitler’s passion for Wagner’s Ring cycle, this is perhaps not surprising. Hitler, in My Struggle, draws comparisons between recent historical events and the Nibelung saga. He accuses ‘Jewish world finance’ of more or less mobilizing an international army against ‘the 21\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\nhorned Siegfried’ Germany in the First World War.71 At another point, Hitler credits himself, following one of his early Nazi Party speeches in 1920, with having ‘stoked a fire’ in whose ‘flames the sword would be forged that would restore freedom’ to the ‘Germanic Siegfried’, and ‘give life again to the German nation’. ‘I felt the goddess of inexorable vengeance getting ready to seek redress for the perjury of 9 November 1918.’72 For Hitler, Siegfried was the victim of betrayal – he had been speared in the back just as the German army had been ‘stabbed in the back’ in 1918 by left-wing politicians. But he was also the hero who would revive Germany. After Hitler came to power, the new German Reich was identified with the heroic and triumphant Siegfried, while productions of Wagner’s Ring presented Alberich and Mime as scheming Jews. The director of The Nibelungs, Fritz Lang, had a Jewish mother, and when Goebbels first saw the film in 1924 he dismissed it as a ‘typically Jewish concoction’, though feeling obliged to recognize that ‘the Jew knows how to direct’.73 But he changed his mind, and by 1929 was calling Lang’s film ‘the pinnacle of German achievement’.74 The answer to this volte-face may be found in Goebbels’ belief that ‘the Jew has the fateful mission to help the sick Aryan race recover its sense of self ’.75 In the Third Reich, the Nibelung saga generally came to stand for the struggle between Judaism and Germanic strength. Lang emigrated in 1933. Although his film was reshown shortly after the Nazis came to power,76 Goebbels and Hitler set about initiating the production of a new film about the Nibelungs.77 Goebbels refers to conversations he had with Lang’s former wife and scriptwriter of the original film, Thea von Harbou, and to what must have been a first draft of the script.78 According to Goebbels, Hitler wanted the new film to be a sound film (despite his distrust of film dialogue), and it was to be ‘really monumental. Educational material for schools. The definitive work.’79 Hitler returned to the idea in September 1940, again telling Goebbels he wanted ‘a truly grand and monumental film about the Nibelungs’. The director Veit Harlan seemed enthusiastic about the project when Goebbels spoke to him about it,80 but, in the end, nothing came of it. In frustration, Hitler 22\n\nFILMS AT THE BERGHOF\n\neven suggested synchronizing the old Fritz Lang film, at least for schools – whether he was thinking here of music, or music and words, is not clear. Nothing came of this either.81 One commentator has suggested that any new Nibelungs film would have involved too much economic risk.82 But the more likely reason the project never got off the ground is because a story about treachery and revenge lost its relevance once the Nazis had overcome the ‘shameful’ legacies of the First World War and the Weimar Republic. Goebbels’ propaganda machine tried to convince the German people in February 1943 that the battle of Stalingrad had been comparable with the self-sacrificial struggle of the Nibelungs at Etzel’s court (where they were massacred to a man) or the Battle of Thermopylae. According to a Security Service report, the Germans, while open to such comparisons, wanted there to be more ‘reticence’ in the use of terms such as heroism, martyrdom and sacrifice.83 So, even if Goebbels was able to draw on the Nibelung notion of heroic collective martyrdom as of 1943, there was clearly a limit to how much he could do so without exhausting the patience of his audience. Hitler, like most of us, probably had several favourite films. This, certainly, would seem to have been Goebbels’ view. In April 1939, he prompted the German film industry to give Hitler a special gift: an album made from parchment paper containing the titles of Hitler’s favourite films along with facsimile signatures from participating actors.84 Unfortunately, I was unable to trace it.\n\nThe Influence of Film Hitler’s admiration for particular films tells us little about how they might have influenced him, and, while the archives provide us with the dates films were sent to the Berghof, rarely do they indicate which days he watched them on. In a few cases, however, they do, so that one can explore, to a limited extent, possible correlations between viewings and Hitler’s other activities. On 19 June 1938, for instance, Hitler sat down to watch an 23\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\nAmerican film directed by Louis King about a group of gangsters who hold up freight trucks to steal merchandise – Tip-Off Girls (1938). A few days later, he signed off a law which made setting road blocks with intention to rob punishable by death. Daily Mail journalist Craig Brown recently took film historian Ben Urwand to task for suggesting that Tip-Off Girls might have influenced Hitler to pass this law.85 According to Brown, this represents a ‘bogus shackling of cause (Hitler watching a film) and effect (Hitler issuing a new order)’.86 Brown has a point. For a start, Hitler did not appear interested in Tip-Off Girls: he stopped the showing.87 Besides, there is no evidence for Urwand’s claim that Hitler requested the film from the Propaganda Ministry (at least not in the sources Urwand cites).88 And Brown is right that Hitler would have signed the law anyway, especially in view of the murderous car-robbery exploits of the Götze brothers, whose trial was under way in Berlin at the time. Urwand implies that Hitler came up with this law. It was more likely the brainchild of the Ministry of Justice, which was keen to ensure there was a legal basis for executing the Götzes. Nevertheless, that watching (what he did of ) Tip-Off Girls might have reinforced Hitler’s support for the law is not a completely unreasonable claim.89 Nor would it be unreasonable to suggest that his support for it was bolstered by his viewing of Nights in Andalusia (1938) a mere matter of hours before signing off the law. In Nights in Andalusia, prisoners being transported for forced labour purposes are set free in an ambush.90 Hitler did not always choose films from a list presented to him, but sometimes asked for a specific film to be shown from one of the various Berghof archives. This was the case on 29 June 1938, when he watched the German film Mazurka (1935), directed by Willi Forst and starring Pola Negri, one of the films given to him as a present by Goebbels. Mazurka premiered in midNovember 1935, and Hitler first viewed it about the same time; according to Goebbels, Hitler was enthusiastic.91 Negri later claimed that Hitler had Mazurka screened ‘during his bouts of chronic insomnia’. He would, so she wrote, ‘demand my picture in the early hours of the morning’, often two or three times a week. Negri surmises that its ‘story of mother love’ reduced him 24\n\nFILMS AT THE BERGHOF\n\nto tears.92 Whatever the appeal of the film’s sentimentality to Hitler, he may have requested it on 29 June for another reason. Earlier in the day, Hitler had confirmed the death sentence for the Götze brothers. Mazurka is about a singer called Vera who takes justice into her own hands to prevent the composer Michailow abusing her daughter in the same way he abused her: Vera shoots Michailow spectacularly in a theatre. In the end, she receives a mild sentence, with the prospect of amnesty, from an understanding court. Mazurka, in other words, demonstrates the importance of preventing a repeat offence – which is precisely what was achieved by executing the Götzes. Hitler’s adjutant noted that Hitler’s response to the film, predictably, was positive.93 Hitler’s choice of Mazurka as evening viewing helped to confirm his own sense of the need for drastic preventative action. On 28 September 1938, in the midst of the Sudetenland crisis, Hitler watched Léo Joannon’s Alert in the Mediterranean (1938), a French film.94 His reaction to it was not recorded. In Alert in the Mediterranean, the captains of British, French and German ships unite to rescue passengers from a boat in danger of being engulfed in poisonous smoke. Hitler had threatened to attack Czechoslovakia unless the Czechs ceded the Sudetenland, and the morning of 28 September was taken up with feverish diplomatic activity as the British, French and Italians tried to get Hitler to back down. He agreed to delay the threat of hostilities for twenty-four hours. It is, to say the least, a remarkable coincidence that Hitler should watch a film about French–German–British collaboration on the eve of negotiations with France, Britain and Italy over the future of the Sudetenland.95 That Alert in the Mediterranean put Hitler in a less aggressive mood for these negotiations is conceivable. Of course, Hitler’s mood largely depended on a sense of having outmanoeuvred France and Britain, who, in the early hours of 30 September, agreed to the cession of the Sudetenland. Soon, however, as Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw has argued, any pleasure Hitler might have got out of the Munich Agreement had evaporated.96 Cheated of his chance to seize the Sudetenland by force, he made up for his disappointment by invading the rest of Czechoslovakia six 25\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\nmonths later. It may be going too far to claim that Hitler’s true motivation for watching films was to allow himself to be seduced by them.97 But watching them certainly enabled him to play out possible scenarios in his mind, and they were a way of providing confirmation of his view of the world, or of his sentiments at any given time. On 3 October 1938 – the Sudetenland had been occupied on 1 and 2 October – Hitler and Goebbels watched part of a film financed by Mussolini, Carmine Gallone’s Scipio Africanus (1937), a heroic epic celebrating Scipio’s victories against Hannibal in the Second Punic War. The film was designed as propaganda in support of Mussolini’s colonial aspirations in Africa. Hitler and Goebbels no doubt saw in it confirmation of their own colonial ambitions, this time directed towards Eastern Europe.98 It was not just feature films that could provide confirmation. Leni Riefenstahl recalls an occasion at the Berghof in August 1939 when the evening’s cinematic fare consisted of newsreels. One showed Stalin reviewing the troops in Moscow. The close-up shots of Stalin in profile seemed to preoccupy Hitler: he kept leaning forward and scrutinizing them. After the viewing, he asked for the reel to be shown again. When Stalin’s face reappeared, Hitler could be heard saying: ‘This man has good features – it surely must be possible to negotiate with him.’ Riefenstahl goes on to remark that German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop was dispatched to Moscow two days later; three days on, the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany was signed, paving the way for Hitler’s attack on Poland.99 This tale sounds apocryphal, but Christabel Bielenberg, the British wife of Peter Bielenberg, an opponent of National Socialism, heard a similar account from Walther Hewel, Ribbentrop’s liaison officer to Hitler in the Foreign Office. Hewel spoke to her about Hitler’s ‘uncanny intuitions’ before citing the Hitler–Stalin Pact as a key example: I was privileged to be there in the Berghof, when the seed of that masterstroke was sown in the Führer’s mind. We were watching films 26\n\nFILMS AT THE BERGHOF\n\n– the Führer finds his sole recreation in watching films – and we were watching a news reel of Stalin reviewing the Russian troops on May Day. The Führer insisted that the film should be run through again and again, and each time, when the close-up appeared of Stalin’s face, he ordered that the film should be stopped. STALIN – HALT! Stalin – Halt! It was most dramatic. After about the tenth run-through, the Führer held up his hand. ‘Enough,’ he said, ‘enough, that is a real man; with him I will make a Pact.’100\n\nGoebbels also reports that Hitler had ‘seen Stalin in a film, and he immediately liked him. That was really the moment where the German-Russian coalition began.’101 Does this prove that the Hitler–Stalin Pact resulted from Hitler’s viewing of a newsreel? Or would this be a ‘bogus shackling of cause and effect’? At the very least it proves that Hitler found in the newsreel visual corroboration of his sense that he could do business with Stalin – a confirmation theatrically staged to his audience as a moment of intuition. But visual corroboration is significant. Viewing films and newsreels had an influence on Hitler, even if it would be rash to suggest that political action flowed directly from it. Film viewing may also have influenced Hitler’s views of other countries, reinforcing existing prejudices. Hollywood was not free of blame when it came to Hitler’s ‘complete misrecognition’ of the USA and its inhabitants, writes Hitler’s former adjutant Fritz Wiedemann: ‘the many gangster films made in the USA, a great number of which Hitler watched, encouraged in him a view that might be valid in relation to some characteristics of the Americans, but does not hold true in general’.102 According to historian Klaus Fischer, Hitler regarded the USA as a ‘“mongrel nation”, as racially polluted as it was decadent and materialistic’.103 Gangster films will have confirmed this view. Yet, as Fischer also points out, Hitler admired America for its ‘powerful industrial capacity and its creative Nordic stock’.104 Similarly, he did not just draw sustenance for prejudice from American films, he genuinely admired some of them; he would hardly 27\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\nhave consumed so many – westerns, comedies, cartoons, as well as gangster films – had this not been the case. Such was Hitler’s interest in Englishlanguage films that he watched them in the original when they had not yet been dubbed. In early May 1936, the Berghof was sent two American film comedies, Clarence Brown’s Wife vs. Secretary (1936), starring Clark Gable and Jean Harlow, and Fred Guiol’s Breakfast in Bed (1930) – in the original English. Included in the same package was a 1935 French film, Marcel L’Herbier’s Sacrifice of Honour, with German subtitles.105 Other films in the original English sent to Hitler’s home over the 1936 period include the Shirley Temple films Captain January (1936, directed by David Butler) and Now and Forever (1934, directed by Henry Hathaway). They also include William Wellman’s Robin Hood of El Dorado (1936), Fritz Lang’s Fury (1936), King Vidor’s So Red the Rose (1935), Sidney Franklin’s The Dark Angel (1935), George Archainbaud’s The Return of Sophie Lang (1936), and Charles Barton’s And Sudden Death (1936), a drama about an heiress who falls in love with a traffic policeman. Hitler watched films in a variety of foreign languages apart from English. On 31 January 1936, for instance, the Propaganda Ministry sent Walpurgis Night (1935) in the original Swedish.106 Propaganda Ministry dispatches to the Berghof in 1936 included French films such as Vladimir Strizhevsky’s Volga Boatmen (1936), Claude Heymann’s The Brighton Twins (1936), Maurice Tourneur’s Samson (1936) and Léo Joannon’s Mad Girl (1935). Hitler was presented with a summary of the plots of films during dinner.107 Given his at best rudimentary grasp of English and French, this was usually the only orientation he received. According to his doctor Hanskarl von Hasselbach, however, it was actually through watching films in French and English that he improved his knowledge of these languages.108 That Hitler watched foreign films that had not been dubbed or subtitled indicates the Propaganda Ministry was not always able to satisfy his appetite; sometimes, there were just not enough German films available. Hitler does not seem to have been concerned about not understanding all the detail of films in a foreign language (although 28\n\nFILMS AT THE BERGHOF\n\nsometimes the ministry provided translations of the dialogue). This again confirms his rootedness in the pre-talkies world, his interest in the movement and power of images, one of the reasons he chose Leni Riefenstahl as his personal director.109 It bears out the argument of a recent book by Wolfgang Pyta which focuses on the importance of visuality to Hitler.110\n\nThe Other Hitler German newspaper-readers in the Third Reich would have known Hitler watched films. The Nazi Film-Kurier celebrated Hitler’s approaching fiftieth birthday by praising Hitler’s services to the film industry. There is no other statesman in the world, we read, who watches as many films as the Führer. ‘As long as the Führer watches films and gives them awards, the people will want to see them too.’111 Two days later, the Film-Kurier reported on a present of films made to Hitler ‘designed for the Führer’s film collection’.112 In one of photographer Heinrich Hoffmann’s various picture books about Hitler, Hitler’s chief adjutant Wilhelm Brückner wrote that Hitler found time ‘between the pressing questions of the day’ to watch German and foreign films in the Reich Chancellery.113 What the Germans did not know was that film viewing took up most of Hitler’s evenings, and that it acquired an obsessive quality from the mid-1930s through to the start of the war. It would have surprised Germans, too, to learn of Hitler’s limitless appetite for musicals, revue films and comedies, many of them made in Hollywood. Hitler was careful to avoid any hint reaching the German public that his film watching was anything other than serious-minded. Nazi newspapers did report on his liking for certain films from the Weimar Republic, but that he consumed all manner of films made in the Republic was also not common knowledge. Nor was it known that he watched films with Jewish directors and actors. In My Struggle, Hitler had railed against the Jews as the ‘intellectual creators’ of ‘dreadful’ and ‘shoddy’ films and plays: ‘that was pestilence, worse than the Black Death’.114 He had stressed the need to ‘purify our theatres, art, literature and press from the manifestations of a rotting world 29\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\nand place them in the service of a morally principled idea of state and culture’.115 This need ‘to purify’ does not seem to have applied to his private film viewing habits. While some Hollywood films produced or directed by Jews, or starring Jewish actors, were banned in pre-war Nazi Germany, others were shown and enjoyed. On occasion, Hitler himself decided whether they were to be shown in German cinemas. This was the case with Camille (1936), for instance, starring Greta Garbo, whom Hitler much admired. The director, George Cukor, was of Jewish background, but Hitler decided Camille should run in Germany nonetheless.116 One wonders at what point Hitler might have considered a film simply ‘too’ Jewish, although the Polish film The Young Forest came into this category: Hitler banned it because there were Jews involved in writing the script, directing the film, playing the music and acting in it.117 There is evidence Hitler sometimes broke off watching films which featured Jewish actors or had been directed by Jews, such as Louis Friedlander’s Stormy (1935),118 and Charles Vidor’s The Great Gambini (1937).119 But he could have broken these films off for any number of reasons. He watched and enjoyed the Laurel and Hardy film Swiss Miss, even though the lead female role was played by Grete Natzler (Della Lind), who had left Nazi Germany in 1933 because of her Jewish background. The ambivalence of National Socialism towards American culture, which was rejected on ideological and often racial grounds but was standard fare in German cinemas, can be traced to Hitler himself. The public, political Hitler denounced supposed trivialization through Hollywood, but indulged in it privately at the Berghof. Goebbels was no less Janus-faced. Hitler’s film viewing confronts us with an apparent paradox. Hitler’s anti-Semitism, antiAmericanism and his rejection of the Weimar Republic ‘system’ were deep beliefs, passionately held doctrines. But his response to film was not always determined by ideological or racist preconceptions. For the private Hitler, films could transcend the – for him – problematic circumstances of their production.\n\n30\n\n2\n\nFrom Bans to Commissions HITLER INTERVENES IN THE FILM INDUSTRY\n\nPrior to the outbreak of the Second World War, Hitler endeavoured to watch every German and foreign feature film released in Germany. He also decided on the fate of films when the Propaganda Ministry was unable to make up its mind whether to pass them or not.1 Aesthetic considerations usually played little if any part in Hitler’s interventions. They were mostly informed by a mixture of ideological principle and sensitivity to the immediate political situation. Moreover, Hitler played a central role in commissioning not only Riefenstahl’s Nazi Party rally films, but also films promoting eugenicist and anti-Bolshevist policies. That film mattered to him as a political tool is amply demonstrated by his various building projects.\n\nBanning Films On 13 November 1933, Goebbels called on Hitler at midnight. They discussed – and may have watched – a feature film called Abel with the Mouth Organ, a seemingly harmless tale, directed by Erich Waschneck, about a balloon and a sailing boat on the North Sea. The main female 31\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\ncharacter, Corinna, falls in love with an American she calls ‘Hurry’. Abel falls unhappily in love with Corinna, but at the end sets sail with his two male friends. Goebbels described the film as ‘terrible tasteless shit’, and Hitler was furious.2 He clearly perceived in its imagery and narrative a celebration of the male body, male bonding and homosexuality. Matters were presumably not helped by the fact that one of the male characters was played by a homosexual actor, Hans Brausewetter; in 1936, Brausewetter was sent to a concentration camp on account of his sexuality. Goebbels banned the film,3 and used the ban as an excuse to begin a restructuring of the German film company Ufa.4 The ban did not affect showings abroad, however. The exiled German writer Thomas Mann saw Abel with the Mouth Organ in Zurich in February 1934. He liked it for the same reasons that Goebbels and Hitler disliked it. In his diary, Mann wrote: ‘from the cinema, I went into the café near the hotel feeling satisfied, indeed delighted after seeing [. . .] “beautiful” young bodies’. Mann’s response can be read as an indication of his own homosexual leanings,5 that of Goebbels and Hitler as an indication of their homophobia. Hitler would have disliked Abel with the Mouth Organ no matter when he saw it. But political circumstances were not without influence. On 12 November 1933, the Germans had gone to the polls to vote in the first Reichstag elections held in what was now a one-party state. Over 90 per cent of those who voted approved the Nazi list. Hitler and Goebbels, buoyed by the results, reacted to the innocuous Abel with the Mouth Organ with particular moral selfrighteousness. About a month later, Hitler was confronted with the first potential diplomatic difficulty caused by a Nazi film. The film was Gustav Ucicky’s adventure drama Refugees (1933). Quite in keeping with Nazi Germany’s negative attitude towards the Soviet Union, it portrayed the Bolshevist persecution of Volga Germans, who are rescued from their plight by a heroic German modelled on Hitler – played by cinema heart-throb Hans Albers. Refugees was due to be premiered in early December, just as Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov was visiting Berlin. 32\n\nFROM BANS TO COMMISSIONS\n\nGerman–Soviet relations were at a low ebb, and Litvinov had been pushing for a military alliance with France following Germany’s departure from the League of Nations and World Disarmament Conference in October. Banning Refugees might have done something (if not much) to defuse German–Soviet tensions, but Hitler decided against a ban.6 Instead, he delayed the premiere by a day or two; Refugees was first shown, behind Litvinov’s departing back, on 8 December 1933. The minimal postponement was Hitler’s way of appearing to make a concession without really making one. By contrast, when it suited him, he opted to intensify a diplomatic spat over a film. In 1937, Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek protested to Werner von Blomberg, Germany’s minister of war, about Herbert Selpin’s adventure film Alarm in Peking (1937). Set in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion, it portrayed the Europeans as noble and condemned the violence of the Chinese. Goebbels wanted the film banned,7 but, on 30 June 1937, Hitler refused. Goebbels, dutifully changing his mind, wrote in his diary: ‘where would it lead if we allowed historical films to be vetted by the countries portrayed?’8 Hitler made Goebbels write a detailed letter to the Chinese ambassador explaining the decision not to ban the film. Even when the Chinese threatened a protest demonstration, Hitler would not give way.9 Relations between Germany and China had been deteriorating, with China moving closer to the Soviet Union, and Germany to Japan. When Japan declared war on China on 7 July 1937, Hitler expressed full support for his ally in the Anti-Comintern Pact. Refusing to ban Alarm in Peking was a clear statement by Hitler of his disregard for the Chinese. Anti-communist considerations were never far from Hitler’s mind, and they could induce him to impose as well as refuse bans. This was the case with White Slaves (1937), a historical epic directed by Karl Anton and starring Camilla Horn, one of Germany’s truly international film stars.10 White Slaves was set in Sebastopol at the time of the Bolshevik revolution, and depicted the violence of the revolutionaries. ‘Führer has banned it,’ Goebbels wrote in mid-October 1936: ‘realistic, taken from Bolshevism. Very borderline.’11 When speaking to Horn about the ban, Goebbels 33\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\nmaintained that Hitler had found the film pro-communist.12 Goebbels imposed on Horn to convey demands for changes to the director, Anton.13 Goebbels personally oversaw the reworking of the film: ‘I myself have revised the manuscript. Now, it has a profile.’14 On 18 December 1936, he proudly noted that Hitler had lifted the ban.15 In June 1937, Goebbels complained about another Nazi film focusing on the Bolshevik revolution, Herbert Maisch’s Strong Hearts (1937): ‘it has the same mistakes as White Slaves. Too bourgeois and simple, without contour or contrasts.’16 In opting to show Bolshevist revolutionary amorality, violence and class conflict, Third Reich directors were not going far enough. Hitler and Goebbels wanted historical portrayals of communism to correspond to contemporary Nazi ideas about a world-historical struggle of ideologies, especially in the context of the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact, details of which were being worked out in the autumn of 1936. For this reason, Goebbels introduced a final scene into White Slaves where the global threat of communism, and the need to fight it, is spelt out. Directors could produce propagandistic films, then, and still fail to meet expectations, or even commit a faux pas in Hitler’s eyes. This was certainly true of Luis Trenker, of whose mountaineering films Hitler was a fan. In 1937, Trenker directed a feature film called Condottieri. Set in early sixteenth-century Italy, it focuses on Giovanni di Medici’s struggle to regain his father’s castle from Cesare Borgia with the help of mercenaries, and on his commitment to the idea of a united fatherland. Associations with the present were reinforced by modelling the condottieri on Mussolini’s Blackshirts, and by employing sixty members of Hitler’s own personal bodyguard formation, the SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler, to play the mercenaries.17 Unfortunately for Trenker, the importance given to Catholicism in his film did not go down well with Hitler and Goebbels. Goebbels complained about Trenker’s tendency to ‘lose himself too much in mystical-Catholic magic’.18 ‘Not a heroic film,’ wrote Goebbels, ‘but a film by the Catholic Action.’19 Trenker claimed later that Hitler angrily left the room after viewing a scene in which the condottieri genuflect before 34\n\nFROM BANS TO COMMISSIONS\n\nthe Pope: ‘he had probably expected his SS Leibstandarte to be put to a different use’.20 Hitler was informed of protests in Munich against the film’s Catholic focus, and Goebbels ordered cuts.21 Hitler and Goebbels were in something of a dilemma. On the one hand, they did not want to support a film which appeared to celebrate Catholicism, especially not at precisely the moment of the Pope’s encyclical criticizing Nazi ideas, ‘With Burning Concern’, had been read out in German Catholic churches.22 On the other hand, the film, a German-Italian coproduction, celebrated the idea of nationhood and national strength, and served as a cultural affirmation of German–Italian friendship. Banning it, moreover, would have irritated the Italians.23 The dilemma resulted in shifting policies. The film premiered on 25 March 1937. It was then withdrawn following a staged protest in the Rhineland when Hitler Youth members hurled rotten eggs at the screen during the controversial scene in the Vatican.24 By this stage, Hitler had lost patience with the film and with Trenker,25 but Goebbels ensured that cuts were made,26 and Condottieri was rereleased.\n\nSoliciting Hitler’s Views Another director who, like Trenker, had built up reliable ideological credentials only to blot his copybook was Karl Ritter. Ritter produced and directed a whole stream of nationalist feature films after the Nazis came to power, such as Traitors (1936), which warned of the threat posed by foreign spy networks to the Nazi armaments industry, and Leave on Word of Honour (1938), which follows the fates of four German soldiers at the end of the First World War; despite the fact that revolution is in the air, none of them opts to desert. In late 1937, Ritter himself took a period of leave from national duties when he decided to make a fantastical and baroque musical comedy called Capriccio. If Trenker in Condottieri had mixed nationalist propaganda with Catholicism, which was problematic enough, in Capriccio Ritter seemed to have abandoned propaganda in favour of farce. Goebbels tried to stop Ritter making the film, but as the 35\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\nproject was already well advanced he restricted himself to issuing a severe warning: ‘Ritter should only make large-scale political and national films.’27 When Goebbels watched Capriccio in May 1938, he was horrified: ‘terrible filth. Supposed to be a musical comedy. Trivial, boring, frivolous and tasteless. A disgrace for Ritter.’28 Hitler, who viewed the film in June, was equally horrified, pronouncing it ‘particularly bad [. . .] shit of the highest order’.29 The film’s spirit of utter disrespect is striking. It lurches between bad taste, frivolity and a refreshing satire of the Nazi entertainment industry. More by accident than design, Ritter had arguably produced the Third Reich’s most interesting film, but, for Hitler and Goebbels, it was unacceptable. From depicting masculine heroism in his previous films, Ritter had switched focus to a sword-bearing woman dressed up as a man. Scenes in a bordello might also have caused offence, and the Reich Music Chamber did not like the music (‘a mixture of swing and Beethoven’).30 Yet, on 16 June, Ritter received the ‘miraculous news’ that Capriccio was to be released ‘without changes’, and Hitler’s devastating critique a few days later did not delay the premiere, which followed in August.31 Nevertheless, Goebbels did ensure that Capriccio did not run for long,32 and Ritter’s indiscretion also contributed to an important decision by Goebbels. On 16 June 1938, the very day that Ritter received the ‘miraculous news’, the Propaganda Ministry explicitly asked Hitler’s Adjutants Office to inform it of every film Hitler viewed, and of his opinion.33 This request was honoured from June 1938 through to at least July 1939. Goebbels interpreted Capriccio as a symptom of a deeper malaise in the German film industry, and stated his intention to ‘take more drastic measures against film saboteurs within Ufa’.34 On 12 May 1938, he issued a ‘serious warning’ to the chiefs of production.35 Goebbels wanted Hitler’s views of films in writing as a source of support in his struggle for total ideological control of the now more or less state-owned Ufa. He also wanted them because he was fed up of interference from other quarters. In 1935, Hitler had issued an edict forbidding individuals, professional groups or organizations from trying to bring about the censorship of films 36\n\nFROM BANS TO COMMISSIONS\n\nsimply because they or members of these groups were portrayed negatively; only the Propaganda Ministry had the right to exercise censorship.36 But this did not stop complaints. In 1938, the German press took exception to Victor Tourjansky’s Faded Melody (1938) because one of the characters was a disreputable journalist, while doctors objected to the way they were depicted in the Austrian film drama Mirror of Life (1938), directed by Géza von Bolváry.37 Having Hitler’s views on films would make it easier to react to such criticisms, and enable Goebbels to be sure that opinions on film emanating from the Berghof really were Hitler’s.38 Knowing what films Hitler had watched, moreover, would help Goebbels find out if films were being sent to Hitler behind his back. German branches of American film companies sometimes sent films directly to Hitler, usually in the hope he would overturn a ban.39 In October 1937, for instance, Paramount asked Hitler to consider lifting the ban on Alexander Hall’s Give Us This Night, Wilhelm Thiele’s The Jungle Princess and Cecil B. DeMille’s The Plainsman, all released in the USA in 1936.40 The Jungle Princess was passed by the Film Censorship Office in March 1938, despite its Jewish director William Thiele, and The Plainsman in March 1940.41 How useful Hitler’s views really were to Goebbels in his control of the film industry, however, remains guesswork. A few days after the Propaganda Ministry’s request to be kept informed of Hitler’s viewing, Hitler was complaining to Goebbels about an overemphasis on professional problems in German films. Instead, Hitler wanted to see the portrayal of ‘human problems’. Goebbels vowed to do his best,42 but Hitler’s complaint rather suggested he understood the objections of some professions to German films.43 More often than not, Hitler’s negative reactions to films had little impact on whether or not they were released.44 Thus his poor opinion (‘bad’) of Harald Paulsen’s Woman Comes to the Tropics – an admittedly preposterous melodrama set on a plantation in Cameroon – did not lead Goebbels, who also disliked the film (‘boring and nonsensical’), to take any action.45 It opened in cinemas on 28 July 1938. If Goebbels had hoped to use Hitler’s comments as a lever to apply pressure of whatever kind on 37\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\nthe German film industry, by late 1938, Hitler was applying pressure on Goebbels by using his film viewing to punish his propaganda minister. Goebbels’ growing infatuation with the Czech actress Lída Baarová was threatening to ruin his marriage, career and relations with Hitler. Hitler’s anger at the situation prompted him to slap bans on two films in order to embarrass Goebbels and bring him to his senses. Affected by the bans were two feature films, Carl Junghans’ Old Heart Goes on a Journey (1938)46 and Rolf Hansen’s Life Can Be So Wonderful (1938).47 Old Heart Goes on a Journey provided an at times unflattering portrayal of a farming community, while Life Can Be So Wonderful focused on problems created by housing shortages. Interestingly, the censorship problems faced by both films demonstrate only too well why filmmakers in the Third Reich often avoided depicting social issues: there was always a danger such portrayals would be understood as a critique of Nazi policies. Hence there was a preference for depicting problems in professional milieus seemingly removed from politics.\n\nDocumentary Film and Sterilization Hitler usually only intervened in the fate of individual feature films at postproduction and distribution stage, but his engagement in documentary film was more fundamental, and responded to longer-term goals as well as more immediate political concerns. This was the case with the twenty-fiveminute documentary short Victims of the Past (1937), which set out to justify the forced sterilization of the mentally and physically disabled. The Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring had been passed on 14 July 1933, allowing for the sterilization of German citizens deemed to be suffering – in the opinion of pompously named Genetic Health Courts – from supposed genetic disorders. Soon after, the Racial Political Office of the Nazi Party began to make short films to support this legislation, such as The Fathers’ Sins (1935), The Inheritance (1935) and The Hereditary Defective (1936). The most notorious in this series was Victims 38\n\nFROM BANS TO COMMISSIONS\n\nof the Past, directed by Gernot Bock-Stieber, and co-written by BockStieber and Rudolf Frercks of the Racial Political Office. It was commissioned by Hitler following his viewing of The Hereditary Defective, which he found good, but clearly felt needed improving.48 And it was Hitler who had the idea of taking a more ‘professional’ filmic approach to the subject;49 the Propaganda Ministry collaborated with the Racial Political Office to ensure this would happen. Apart from The Inheritance, the precursors to Victims of the Past were silent 16mm movies, using captions to encourage the desired interpretation of the film. Victims of the Past was a sound film, with a voice-over and an at times dramatic score connecting the individual sections. This served to reinforce its drastic message.50 It claimed the disabled were a financial drain on the community; that they lived in palatial care homes, while many Germans lived in poverty; and that if they continued to procreate at a greater rate than the healthy, the Germans would soon be a nation of imbeciles. It is possible that Hitler first watched Victims of the Past in October 1936.51 If so, then a repeat viewing was required in early 1937, when Goebbels had a copy sent to Hitler’s Adjutants Office with a request that a decision be taken on whether it could be shown, a decision Hitler had reserved the right to make.52 Goebbels duly noted that Hitler found Victims of the Past ‘very good’, and that the film ‘has to be shown in all German cinemas’.53 After a joint viewing, Goebbels and Hitler reiterated that the film should be deployed ‘as quickly as possible [. . .] in all German cinemas within the framework of a normal and suitable film programme’.54 This was to be the first public showing of such a film; earlier Racial Political Office films about the disabled had been designed for internal Nazi Party viewing and presented in an explicitly ‘educational’ framework, with accompanying lectures.55 Objections to showing the film publicly were made, but overruled. Frercks, for instance, wrote to Goebbels’ secretary Karl Hanke, impressing on him that even if he, Hanke, could not approve of all the ‘repulsive’ images, it was necessary to show the nation the ‘hard and unsparing side of ethnic life’. Frercks also implied that the severity of 39\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\nthese images represented a direct response to Hitler’s instructions.56 In April, the showing of Victims of the Past was made mandatory.57 Following a viewing for party leaders and representatives of Nazi organizations in Berlin – Hitler was not present – the film made its way round Germany’s 5,300 film theatres. The Reich Propaganda Leadership, writing to all Gau Film Offices, stressed that Hitler had insisted every ‘people’s comrade’ must see Victims of the Past, and collaboration between the Racial Political Office and the Gau Film Offices was to be streamlined to ensure his order could be followed.58 No cinema in the Reich was exempt from showing the film.59 Victims of the Past lent visual and textual support to one of Hitler’s more axiomatic pronouncements in My Struggle: ‘he who is not physically and mentally healthy and worthy cannot be allowed to perpetuate his suffering in the body of his child’.60 Like its predecessor sterilization films, only more forcefully, it seeks to convince the viewer that it is both God’s law and natural law not to allow the genetically enfeebled to procreate. In the words of Michael Burleigh: ‘insidiously, the films appropriate the language of mercy, morality and religion in order to subvert them the more effectively’.61 That Hitler triggered the production of a propaganda film about the disabled for general release was a reaction to the public unease the sterilization laws had caused, with the Catholic Church in some cases expressing open disapproval. Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick even issued a circular asking government institutions to take measures in response to such ‘agitation’ against the law.62 The sequence in the film showing a bride-to-be seeking advice from a doctor on genetic health was clearly designed to promote acceptance of the October 1935 Marriage Health Law. At the same time, the film’s obsessive dwelling on images of infirmity aims to unsettle audiences so that any potential resistance to the planned radicalization of policy that resulted in euthanasia is nipped in the bud. Euthanasia, under cover of war,63 was always what Hitler had ultimately envisaged, but it was clear to him it was not going to be a popular measure 40\n\nFROM BANS TO COMMISSIONS\n\nwith most Germans.64 At points, Victims of the Past associates mental illness with Jewishness, tapping into anti-Semitic sentiment to mobilize resentment and fear. Hitler was confident, clearly, that confronting German audiences with images designed to repel would have the desired effect. Here again was his faith in the visual. Yet he stopped short of directly confronting audiences with visual documentation of euthanasia. In August 1939, Philipp Bouhler, chief of Hitler’s Chancellery, and Martin Bormann showed Hitler and others a film called Unworthy Life. To judge from the description of the viewing by Hitler’s army adjutant, Gerhard Engel, this was a film about children’s euthanasia, the first steps towards which were coordinated as of mid-1939 by Hitler’s Chancellery on Hitler’s express orders. Bormann suggested to Hitler showing the film in cinemas, but Hitler’s doctor, Karl Brandt, rejected the idea: what would you say, he asked, if you discovered one of your own children in the film? Hitler rejected the idea of a public screening in this instance, presumably agreeing with Brandt’s assessment that it would ‘cause unrest’.65 There are moments in the gestation of Victims of the Past where the brutality of Goebbels and Hitler comes sharply into focus.66 On 4 December 1936, Goebbels commented on having seen ‘a film from the lunatic asylums to justify the sterilization laws’: ‘horrifying material [. . .] your blood freezes just watching it’.67 A few days later, he writes in his diary of a ‘nice little’ dinner party attended among others by Eugen Klöpfer, Heinz Hilpert and Lída Baarová.68 The evening’s entertainment consisted of a film about the ‘hereditarily ill’ that was ‘strongly applauded’, followed by a ‘bad’ French film, and then The Hound of the Baskervilles (‘suspenseful and entertaining’). Goebbels showed what was probably Victims of the Past to his guests as a titillating horror show, something to enjoy over a drink or two, without a thought for the debasement of the disabled in the film or their fate under Nazism. On 10 February 1937, Hitler, after seeing Victims of the Past, suggested to Goebbels adding a photograph of Helga, Goebbels’ four-year-old daughter – to provide a ‘nice final image’.69 Goebbels took up and developed the idea. Ten days later, he sent Hitler a 41\n\nHITLER AND FILM\n\nfilm roll showing his children, presumably seeking Hitler’s approval for the images to be included.70 ‘Victims of the Past with our children at the end,’ Goebbels enthused; ‘all three are so sweet!’71 The final version of the film does include a clip of three children playing. These are almost certainly Helga, Hilde and Helmut Goebbels. They are used as an example of healthy German children, contrasting with the images of debility that "
