Copyright Â© 2015, Richard Ivey School of Business Foundation Version: 2017-01-20 It was October 14, 2014, and Josie Walsh, president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Providence Healthcare (Providence) in Toronto, was in her office, thinking about the October 27 strategic planning retreat with her board. Appointed president and CEO in 2011, Walsh had led Providence through massive change and turnaround, from potential crisis to financial health and innovation in four, short, action- packed years. Two critical questions demanded her attention. How could she integrate and embed the values that had helped her drive change and foster collaboration within Providence and with its key partners? What could she do to sustain positive change at Providence Healthcare through her values-based leadership and to win the support of key stakeholders well into the future? She reached for the phone to call key members of her team for their input. A VALUES-BASED LEADER Josie Walsh joined Providence Healthcare as vice president of programs and chief nurse executive in 2001. Walsh had extensive health care experience, held a master's degree in Health Sciences (Health Administration) and was a Certified Health Executive with the Canadian College of Health Leaders. Her joining Providence was a near-perfect alignment of her virtues as a leader with the needs and values of the organization. Her commitment to Providence was visceral: her own parents had received care at Providence, sharply focusing her views of what worked well and what needed to be radically changed in the health care system. Compassionate care, dynamic partnerships, high accountability and trust were integral to both the leader and the organization. This confluence helped drive success at Providence and was instrumental to enabling change and innovation. Walsh's competencies, her commitment to Providence and her character shaped the design and execution of radical transformation at Providence. The notion of personal character as a driver of leadership and organizational success had come sharply to the forefront after the global economic meltdown of 2008, as CEO after CEO stood indicted for gross negligence, egregious fraud and monumental greed. Increasingly, character-based leadership had become very much part of the management conversation. Research by Ivey Business School academics Jeffrey Gandz, Mary Crossan, Gerard Seijts and Mark Reno explored the key dimensions of leadership character and its relevance to good corporate governance (see Exhibit 1).

Humility helps leaders to learn and grow. Integrity builds trust and fosters collaboration. Collaboration empowers teamwork. Justice shapes decisions that are seen as being fair and reasonable. Leaders need courage to make difficult decisions, take bold actions and challenge the status quo. Temperance helps leaders take a balanced view and reasonable risks. Accountability means leaders own their decisions, commit to them and expect others to do the same. Humanity powers empathy and understanding of others. Transcendence shapes a leader with vision, purpose and optimism. And finally, judgment equips a leader to focus and balance these virtues to meet the needs of both internal and external stakeholders. Of these dimensions, Walsh had been recognized by both internal and external stakeholders, particularly for her courage, collaboration, accountability and integrity. These characteristics helped her lead Providence Healthcare through a tsunami of change. Her values-based leadership drove change and innovation at Providence at a time when major change was needed to ensure the future of the organization. PROVIDENCE HEALTHCARE: \"HELPING PEOPLE. HEALING LIVES.\" Established by the Sisters of St. Joseph in 1857 as the House of Providence to look after the needs of the poor, ill, homeless and vulnerable, Providence Healthcare had a 158-year history and strong values of compassionate care and responsive innovation (see Exhibit 2). As a leader in rehabilitation, palliative care, long-term care and community programs, Providence provided inpatient and outpatient care to more than 5,000 individuals annually. A rehabilitation hospital differed from acute care hospitals: patients of a rehabilitation hospital typically stayed for longer periods and required care from a broader spectrum of health professionals. Providence Healthcare included six rehabilitation units, one palliative care unit, the outpatient clinics of Providence Hospital, the Cardinal Ambrozic Houses of Providence with 288 residents who needed long-term care, and an Adult Day Program, which included caregiver workshops, support and education. Also part of the organization, Providence Healthcare Foundation was a fundraising organization that supported programs and equipment at Providence, with a goal of raising $3.5 million 1 for 2014/15. In 2013/14, Providence Healthcare had 1,100 employees and physicians, 350 volunteers and annual income of $88.5 million. Of this amount, $74.8 million came from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care through the Toronto Central Local Health Integration Network (TCLHIN); $7.4 million in income from patients and residents; $2.7 million from amortization of contributions to capital assets; $2.9 million from other incomes and recoveries; and $0.7 million from operations and equipment. Providence's focus on compassionate care, a part of its Catholic tradition, came through in its mission, vision and values. 2 These tenets of care were redefined in 2013 by 260 employees, physicians, donors, health care partners, volunteers, patients and families as part of the organization's transformation. Compassion, hope and healing were the pillars of Providence's mission to the community. Providence's six values encompassed sanctity of life, human dignity, compassionate service, community, social justice and social responsibility. Providence Healthcare took its values seriously; each January, staff who exemplified the organization's key values in their work were honoured with awards for \"Living Our Values.\" Providence even had a dedicated director of mission and values, Sister Mary Anne McCarthy, a sister of St. Joseph of Toronto. A highly unionized and diverse environment with a wide range of health care professionals, Providence was one of the largest rehabilitation hospitals in Ontario. It served a growing demographic: an aging population with multiple and complex needs. 1 All currency amounts are shown in Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. 2 Providence Healthcare, \"Mission, Values and Vision,\" www.providence.on.ca/about/mission-values-and-vision accessed November 24, 2014.
