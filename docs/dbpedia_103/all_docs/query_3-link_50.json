        "text": "NEWMAN CLUB / ST. MICHAEL’S COLLEGE / VICTORIA COLLEGE /\n\nNewman Club of the University of Toronto (NEW-UN)\n\nLocation: 89 St. George Street, Toronto, Ontario, M5S 2E8 (corner of Hoskin Avenue and St. George Street; on the University of Toronto campus; across from the Robarts Library)\n\nOpened: 1913\n\nAlternate or former names: Newman Centre, Newman Centre for Catholic Life on Campus\n\nPre-1998 municipality: Toronto\n\nType of school: University-associated club\n\nHistory:\n\nNewman Centres were established in many countries to provide pastoral care to Roman Catholic students attending secular universities. The writings of Cardinal John Henry Newman (1801-1890) inspired the movement. The Toronto Newman Centre is housed in the Wilmot Deloui Matthews house (completed in 1891). Matthews (1850-1919) attended Toronto Normal School before entering his father’s grain business and becoming a successful and influential Toronto businessman. The Romanesque Revival two-and-one-half storey building is constructed of red clay, terra cotta bricks, and plum-coloured Credit Valley sandstone, with many decorative touches. It is similar in style to the former Gooderham house at the northeast corner of Bloor and St. George streets, which is currently (2018) the home of the York Club. The Newman Club is under the direction of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toronto, and is associated with St. Thomas Aquinas Church—sometimes referred to as the Newman Chapel—next door.\n\n1900-1912: Enrolment of Roman Catholic students at the University of Toronto increased. St. Michael’s College was at the time a separate university. The Newman Club formed to give these students a welcoming place on the U of T campus, with “emphasis on the union of faith and reason.” Newman balls and banquets were part of the social life.\n\n1913: Archbishop Neil McNeil purchased and furnished 97 Joseph Street (on St. Michaels’s campus) for the club. The Newman Club chapel was also on St. Joseph Street at that time. The archbishop invited Paulist priests from New York to be chaplains. They remained in charge until 1936. The executive included a president, two or more vice presidents, and treasurer—all of whom were students. A rector or chaplain, the editor of The Torch publication, and an alumni representative rounded out the governing group.\n\n1915: Newman Alumni Association held its first annual dinner. The tradition continued until the 1980s.\n\n1921 Dec 27: Letters patent received. The purpose of the limited company in Ontario was: To establish, provide, furnish and maintain quarters for students attending educational institutions in the City of Toronto, and to assist in the religious, moral, physical and mental welfare of such students.\n\n1922: The Newman Club moved to 89 St. George Street. Senator Frank P. O’Connor, president of the board for a number of years, was a prominent guarantor of the purchase of this property from the Wilmot D. Matthews estate. The new address was on the U of T campus. The ballroom—which had been added to the house in 1898 by architect George Martel Miller—served as a chapel while architect W.W. Holmes designed a new chapel.\n\n1926 Sept 26: Cornerstone laid for the chapel, named for St. Thomas Aquinas, patron saint of students.\n\n1927 Mar 27: Chapel inaugurated and blessed by Archbishop Neil McNeil. The coach house of the Matthews house had been demolished to make room for the Gothic Revival chapel, built of Credit Valley and Indiana limestone. Maximum occupancy: three hundred.\n\n1934: When the club leased a neighbouring property at 107 St. George Street as a women’s residence, 89 St. George became the men’s residence.\n\n1934: The club held a testimonial dinner at the King Edward Hotel for Senator Frank O’Connor’s 50th birthday.\n\n1946: The Archdiocese of Toronto became the owner of 107 St. George.\n\n1950: Third Newman Club pilgrimage to Rome. Chaplain—Rev. J.E. McHenry—and some Newmanites met Pope Pius XII.\n\n1951: The Archdiocese conveyed 107 St. George Street to the Newman Club Ltd.\n\n1957: James Cardinal McGuigan asked the Basilian Fathers to manage the Newman Centre. Rev. T.A. McDonald was the first of the Basilian chaplains.\n\n1958: The Newman Foundation of Ontario—incorporated as a charitable foundation—replaced the Newman Club Ltd. Students were now members of the Newman Foundation. The foundation’s purpose: To advance religion at the University of Toronto and other institutions of higher education in and around the City of Toronto.\n\n1963: Newman Alumni Association held a Gold Jubilee Reunion.\n\n1970: U of T expropriated the 107 St. George Street property; the Newman Foundation paid for it.\n\n1971: U of T agreed not to expropriate 69 St. George Street and St. Thomas Aquinas Chapel.\n\n1976: The Ontario Heritage Foundation designated the 89 St. George Street property to be of architectural value.\n\n1994: Resident students were designated Student Campus Ministers, a role established by Fr. Thomas Rosica.\n\n1995: Archbishop Aloysius Ambrozic established St. Thomas Aquinas as a quasi-parish.\n\n2002: Newman Centre participated in World Youth Day, Toronto.\n\n2010: Josh Canning assumed the newly-created position of Director of Chaplaincy Services.\n\n2012: The University of Toronto recognized the Newman Catholic Students’ Club (NCSC) as a student club of U of T.\n\n2013 June 9: Newman 100 Years celebration. Mass followed by a festival of music, food, and exhibits of Newman’s history.\n\nNOTE: Much of the history given above came from displays featured at the 100th anniversary fête, which were prepared by the Archives of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toronto (ARCAT).\n\nWebsite: newmantoronto.com\n\nMemorial transcribed:\n\nNEW-UN-a: (WWII): Illuminated list designed by A.J. Casson. “For King and Country / Members of / Newman Club of University of Toronto / who have volunteered for active service / with / Canada’s fighting forces.” Six columns of names; given names followed by surnames. Names are in random (not alphabetical) order. No key. List does not specify which war, but the presence of women’s names, and the use of an A.J. Casson document, indicate World War II. The memorial hangs in St. Thomas Aquinas Church (or Newman Chapel) close to a stained glass window honouring Thomas Aquinas and Cardinal Newman, and their writings.\n\nNOTE: Brian Horgan, a lifetime member of the Irish Regiment of Canada, who has several McDonough relatives on the Newman list, says that some of these U of T students would have been too young for active service, but went through training in case they were called upon later. His father, Gerald Horgan, a major in the Irish Regiment, also on the Newman list, did go overseas in 1943.\n\nSt. Michael’s College (SMC-UN)\n\nLocation: 81 St. Mary Street, Toronto, M5S 1J4 (south of Bloor Street West; between Bay Street on the east and Queen’s Park Crescent on the west)\n\nOpened: 1852\n\nAlternate or former names: University of St. Michael’s College in the University of Toronto (official name), St. Mike’s (informal), Bay Street Fighting Irish (nickname)\n\nPre-1998 municipality: Toronto\n\nType of school: University. Federated College of the University of Toronto since 1910. Religious affiliation: Roman Catholic Church\n\nHistory:\n\nMotto: Goodness, Discipline, Knowledge\n\nStudent Newspaper: The Mike (bi-weekly; began 1947)\n\nColours: blue and yellow; green added later\n\nSt. Michael’s College was founded in 1852 as a boys’ school to provide what we would today call a combined high school and university education. In 1950, the high school division of the college separated from the college, and moved to new quarters at St. Clair Avenue West and Bathurst Street, under the name St. Michael’s College School. St. Michael’s College, the university component, remained on the St. George campus of the University of Toronto. Thus, the school and the university share history, particularly in the faithfulness of their religious outlook, and in their reputations of having strong sports teams—especially hockey. A Toronto Daily Star feature in March 1949 listed one sign of spring as “lads from St. Michael’s College taking home their hockey equipment for summer storage.”\n\nSt. Michael’s College School can be found elsewhere on this website. See under: Independent Schools.\n\nFrom its earliest days, St. Michael’s attracted recent Irish immigrants and Canadians of Irish descent. The predominantly Anglo culture of Toronto at the time was often unwelcoming—even hostile—to Roman Catholics and to the Irish in general. St. Mike’s nickname of “Bay Street Fighting Irish” stemmed from another Roman Catholic institution that welcomed the Irish: the University of Notre Dame in Indiana—known as “The Fighting Irish.” References in the sports pages of local newspapers reinforced the theme. Headlines such as “Ghosts Rout Irish” meant that the Cobourg Ghosts had defeated St. Michael’s College 19 to 0. (Toronto Star, October 17, 1949.)\n\nContinuing their Irish interests, St. Michael’s College runs a strong Celtic Studies program, offering undergraduate courses on the languages and culture of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. The program attracts visiting professors and scholars—many from Ireland.\n\nSelected Dates in the Development of St. Michael’s College:\n\n1852: Michael Power, the first Roman Catholic bishop of Toronto died in 1847 from typhus he contracted while helping victims of the disease. His successor, Bishop Armand Comte de Charbonnel, who had emigrated from France, noted that there was no university-level theological training for the approximately 5,900 residents of the city identified as members of his flock. He wrote to the Basilian Fathers of Annonay, France asking if they would develop an appropriate educational institution in Toronto. Later that year, the Reverend Jean-Mathieu Soulerin arrived, and with four other Basilians, opened St. Mary’s Lesser Seminary. Classes began that fall.\n\n1853: Bishop de Charbonnel merged St. Mary’s Lesser Seminary and St. Michael’s College—which had just started at the secondary school level under the Christian Brothers—into St. Michael’s College. Father Soulerin was the first Superior of the new institution. Overall, the Basilian Fathers organized studies at high school, college, and seminary levels. Training young men for the priesthood was a priority.\n\nCaptain John Elmsley (1801-1863) retired from the Royal Navy, and a convert to Roman Catholicism, donated four lots of his Clover Hill estate to St. Michael’s College in one of his many acts of philanthropy. Elmsley managed the extensive land holdings of his father, also John Elmsley (1762-1805) who had been chief justice of both Upper and Lower Canada. The estate land given to St. Michael’s was adjacent to the University of Toronto. A condition of the gift was that a parish church be built on the property. This led to the establishment of St. Basil’s Church.\n\n1855: Incorporation of the college granted royal assent.\n\n1855 Sept 15: Cornerstone laid for St. Basil’s Church.\n\n1856 Sept 14: St. Basil’s Church opened for worship.\n\n1856 Sept 15: St. Michael’s College opened.\n\n1881: St. Michael’s became affiliated with the University of Toronto. Students could get a degree through University College, but St. Michael’s would teach its own philosophy and history from a religious point of view.\n\n1909: First St. Michael’s student to graduate from the U of T.\n\n1910: St. Michael’s became an official Federated College in the University of Toronto.\n\n1911 May: A class of six students graduated.\n\n1946: Marshall McLuhan was among the first lay faculty members hired. A convert to Roman Catholicism, he taught English, but became famous internationally for his studies of the effects of mass media on society.\n\n1969: St. Michael’s Faculty of Theology became one of the founding colleges of the Toronto School of Theology.\n\nThe grounds of St. Michael’s College currently form the eastern end of the U of T campus—with Victoria College to the north; Regis College to the south. There are currently (2019) twenty-two buildings belonging to St. Michael’s, many named for people important to the college’s history or religious focus. A few of these are:\n\nJohn M. Kelly Library: After a number of locations and expansions, the new library opened in 1969 at 113 St. Joseph Street. In 1978, it was renamed for John M. Kelly, president of St. Michael’s from 1958 to 1978. The main collection dates back to the 1852 founding of the college. A catalogue dated 1892 listed 3,401 volumes. In 1929, the opening of the Pontifical Institute of Mediæval Studies spurred the organization of many scholarly texts from small collections around the campus. In 2019, described on its website as “the largest federated college library at U of T,” it notes special emphasis on: Roman Catholic theology, the Middle Ages, book history and media, Celtic Studies, English, French, Italian, Slavic, and German literature. The collection of St. Michael’s College yearbooks dates from 1910.\n\nPontifical Institute of Mediæval Studies: When founded in 1929 by French mediævalist Étienne Gilson and Henry Carr of St. Michael’s College, this was the only specialized graduate-level institution in its field. In 1939, Pope Pius XII granted the institute a papal charter. Studies at first based on the teachings of St. Thomas Aquinas broadened to include other academic disciplines. Recognized internationally for its scholarly research.\n\nCarr Hall: Designed by Ernest Cormier, who also designed the Supreme Court building in Ottawa. Named for Father Henry Carr, (1880-1963) a Basilian who promoted Roman Catholic colleges at secular universities. In the early 1900s, he modernized the curriculum of St. Michael’s College, turning what had been a modest institution into a noted arts college.\n\nPublished history:\n\nFriedland, Martin L.
