        "text": "Alright, Ontario parents, let’s dive right in. Picking the right high school for your kid? Yeah, it feels like you’re choosing their future in a way, doesn’t it? With all those options and opinions, it’s like trying to find a needle in a haystack. But guess what? We’ve got a cheat sheet for you.\n\nHave you heard of the Fraser Institute Ranking Report Card on Ontario’s Secondary Schools 2020? It sounds pretty official, but it’s basically your one-stop shop for school performance. This lets you sort through how different schools are doing, compare them, and figure out what’s best for your child. It’s a lifesaver for parents, making the whole “Which school?” question a bit easier to tackle.\n\nHere’s the deal. If you’re lucky enough to choose between a few schools, this Report Card is your secret weapon. It not only points out which schools are nailing the academic game but also shows if they’re stepping up or slipping down over time. So, when walking through school halls and talking to teachers, you’ll have some solid info to back up your questions.\n\nBut hold on a second. While this Report Card is super helpful, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. There are other places to get info, too, like websites from Ontario’s Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO), the local bigwigs of education, and even the school boards around town. Oh, and never underestimate the gossip – err, valuable input – from other parents, especially those with kids already in the school.\n\nAnd let’s not forget while good grades and top rankings are excellent, they aren’t everything. Schools offer so much more than just academics. There’s a whole world of programs and activities out there that the Report Card might not touch on but could be perfect for your kid.\n\nSo, to wrap it up, the Report Card on Ontario’s Secondary Schools 2020 is a fantastic starting point. But mix it up with some other resources and a dash of parental intuition, and you’ll be on your way to finding the right fit for your kiddo.\n\nBest of luck with the school search!\n\nOntario High Schools Ranking – Top 50 Best High Schools in Ontario\n\nRankingSchoolScore 2018-19Rank 2018-19City1Wali ul Asr9.91/739Caledon2Markville9.42/739Markham3St. Michael’s Choir9.42/739Toronto4Canadian Intl.
