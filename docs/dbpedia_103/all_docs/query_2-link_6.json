        "text": "Valdor prepared a Site Servicing and Grading Plan and a Stormwater Management Report for a new secondary school. The project required extensive design co-ordination with the consulting team including the mechanical engineer for the co-ordination of services to the building. Co-ordination was also required with the consulting engineer for the surrounding subdivision for which the engineering design was not yet complete. In addition, co-ordination was required with the Region of Peel with respect to their planned upgrades to their adjacent arterial road.\n\nValdor was able to develop a design which allowed the school site to proceed in advance of both the subdivision servicing and the Region’s re-construction of the arterial road. This required extensive discussions with the City and Region staff to demonstrate that the site could be\n\nadequately serviced without the completion of these surrounding works. The design of interim drainage works was necessary to satisfy the municipality before a building permit could be issued for the school.\n\nValdor was able to successfully integrate continuous design changes resulting from changes to the adjacent subdivision design as well as design changes to the arterial road improvements. Changes to the subdivision design included service connection adjustments and grading revisions. Changes to the arterial road design included a significant adjustment to the horizontal alignment which required that the school building be shifted further into the site. The efficient integration of these changes were necessary to expedite the approvals process in order to achieve the School Board’s scheduled occupancy date.\n\nValdor was retained to prepare a site servicing & grading plan for an addition to the West Derry Village elementary school in Mississauga. This project had a very aggressive design and construction schedule which was necessary in order that most of the work could be completed during the summer months while the school was closed. Particular attention was paid to the existing site grading to establish necessary grading transitions to the new addition while minimizing the area to be disturbed.\n\nThe parking lot was expanded to provide additional parking spaces and improved traffic flow. The expansion of the parking lot involved adjustments to catchbasins and manholes to ensure that adequate drainage is provided.\n\nThrough a review of existing and proposed site conditions Valdor was able to demonstrate that a stormwater management report was not necessary which expedited the municipal approvals process.\n\nThe project required extensive design co-ordination with the consulting team including the architect, mechanical engineer and landscape architect. A unique challenge of this project was to determine the location of existing services on the site and to design the relocation of these services in a manner which would minimize disruption. Contract administration services were also provided which involved on site inspections during servicing and final certification of works.\n\nValdor prepared a Site Servicing and Grading Plan and a Stormwater Management Report for a replacement building for St. Conrad Catholic Elementary School. The project required design co-ordination with the consulting team including the mechanical engineer for the co-ordination of services to the building.\n\nValdor was able to develop a design which allowed the existing site services to remain so that the existing school building could continue operating until the new building was ready for occupancy. This required consideration for construction staging and a temporary storm sewer outlet for the new building.\n\nA stormwater management analysis was undertaken to address the City’s Wet Weather Flow Criteria including quantity control, quality treatment and water balance. Based on the results of the analysis, the design incorporated various mitigation measures including underground stormwater detention pipes, a tank for landscape irrigation and permeable pavers.\n\nNew sanitary, storm and water service connections were co-ordinated with the municipality including the capping of existing services once the original building was demolished. With regards to the new storm service connection an analysis of the downstream municipal system was undertaken to confirm that adequate capacity was available to accommodate the re-development of the site."
