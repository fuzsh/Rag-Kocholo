        "text": "With growing Muslim population in Europe and recent influx of migrants, it is vital to analyze schooling options available to Muslim parents in terms of Islamic studies in public and private sector. This research will accordingly help Muslim community and governments to plan their way forward in a number of ways such as teacher training, curriculum design, operating private schools and other aspects. In current study, we have analyzed a large body of academic research, news and opinions of various community members. Our findings from this explorative research identify a number of difference from country to country. Some countries consider confessional education where-as other provide it in a non-confessional manner. Some have complete separation between Church and state whereas others are heavily influenced by Church and accordingly reflect this in their educational policies. We also find out that financial situation of Muslim communities is generally not very strong and they are reliant on foreign funding to meet their basic religious needs e.g. having a place of worship or a mosque. Most of this support is found to be coming from Turkey or Saudi Arabia. Our findings also highlight the importance of Sunday or weekend schools as most of the communities where adequate confessional Islamic knowledge is not available through public education system and Islamic schools cannot be established, they are helping the communities in imparting religious knowledge they consider important for their children.\n\nWith growing Muslim population in Europe and recent influx of migrants, it is vital to analyze schooling options available to Muslim parents in terms of Islamic studies in public and private sector.

It is a highly critical decision to choose a language or a set of languages for inclusion in curriculum in a manner that would be most productive at personal, community and national level. What we need to see in our next generation has to be ‘sowed the seeds for’ today. Our study present an overview of choices related to languages inclusion in curriculum for Muslim children from the perspective of acquiring local languages, Arabic, English and other international languages. Findings suggest that learning this set comprising of 4 languages is already practiced in different cultures and institutions. However selection of languages to be included in mix needs be carefully considered. Paper also highlights factors that govern influence of a particular language globally or for communities and recommend a set of languages that can be adopted for curriculum with further research."
