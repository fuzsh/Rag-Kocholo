I know that playing in college is a once in a lifetime opportunity that could change my whole life.\n\nI am a team leader(Team Captain) and I always encouraging my teammates. I am very coachable and the hardest working players and one of the hardest working recruits youâ€™ll find.\n\nIn the classroom, I study hard and maintain a high GPA.\n\nI want to attend a college where I can push myself in the classroom and on the field. I am open to all options and want to ultimately find the right college match at the highest level of competition possible. I hope to become a great role model to all my peers and make my parents proud."
