        "text": "#HBM Prices to Increase by 5‚Äì10% in 2025, Accounting for Over 30% of Total #DRAM Value, Says TrendForce Corporation üí° Avril Wu, TrendForce Senior Research Vice President, reports that the HBM market is poised for robust growth, driven by significant pricing premiums and increased capacity needs for AI #chips. HBM's unit sales price is several times higher than that of conventional DRAM and about five times that of #DDR5. This pricing, combined with product iterations in AI #chip #technology that increase single-device HBM capacity, is expected to dramatically raise HBM‚Äôs share in both the capacity and market value of the DRAM market from 2023 to 2025. Specifically, HBM‚Äôs share of total DRAM bit capacity is estimated to rise from 2% in 2023 to 5% in 2024 and surpass 10% by 2025. In terms of market value, HBM is projected to account for more than 20% of the total DRAM market value starting in 2024, potentially exceeding 30% by 2025.

This growth‚Äîreaching US$18.35 billion‚Äîwas driven by rising contract prices for mainstream products, with the price increase being more significant than in 4Q23. As a result, most companies in the industry continued to see revenue growth. The top three suppliers experienced a decline in shipments in the first quarter, demonstrating the industry‚Äôs off-season effect. Additionally, downstream companies had higher inventory levels, which led to a significant reduction in #procurement volume. As for ASP, the top three suppliers continued to benefit from contract price increases seen in 4Q23. With inventory levels still healthy, there was a strong intention to raise prices. #Mobile DRAM saw the highest price increase out of all applications thanks to strong sales of Chinese #smartphones. On the other hand, the price increase for consumer DRAM was the lowest among all applications, as manufacturers still need to clear their inventories.
