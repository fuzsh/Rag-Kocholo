        "text": "July 6, 2019\n\nThough separated by distance, the cousins were close.\n\nOn visits to the Greater Toronto Area to reconnect with family members, Atlanta-born and raised Dr. Ransford Morel-Hyman Jr. always felt strongly connected to Lloyd Skeen who died suddenly in February 2003 shortly after celebrating his 32nd birthday.\n\n“He was definitely one of my favourites,” said Morel-Hyman who was the Master of Ceremony at the 16th annual ‘Dream Never Dies Foundation’ (DNDF) scholarship awards ceremony on June 2 to honour Skeen’s memory. “He was motivated, peaceful and very caring. There were times when some relatives would pick on me and it was Lloyd who came to my defense.”\n\nAlways giving praise to motivate people was a quality of Skeen that stood out for Morel-Hyman who was the second African-American to receive a PhD in Computer Science Engineering from the University of South Florida.\n\n“Even if you did something that in your eyes was insignificant, Lloyd would make you feel on top of the world,” he noted. “He was supportive and a role model.”\n\nAfter Morel-Hyman’s father passed away in July 2009, he started a scholarship in his Jamaican-born dad’s name that’s presented annually at the DNDF event.\n\nHe presented two scholarships, each worth US$1,000, this year.\n\nThe recipients were Chantal Phillips and Kristin Wu.\n\nAmong the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Medicine’s Black Student Application Program (BSAP) first cohort, Phillips recently completed her first year in medical school.\n\nDeveloped in consultation with students, faculty, staff, Black community members and Black medical professionals, the BSAP is an optional stream for Black applicants who self-identify as Black African, Black Caribbean, Black North American and multiracial students who have an identify with their Black ancestry.\n\n“My mother was a personal support worker throughout my childhood and it was clear how much she cared for her patients,” Phillips said. “Having her as an example of what an empathetic health care provider looked like gave me insight and sparked my desire to emulate that in my own career.”\n\nRacial inequality in access to health care services is a major concern for the Western University Medical Sciences & Psychology graduate.\n\n“As much as I hope to spend some time clinically doing one-on-one personalized clinical care, the area of health outcomes being significantly lower for Black and Indigenous People is one that I am going to be engaged in,” said the Western Future Black Physicians founding President who completed high school at Turner Fenton Secondary School in Brampton.\n\nWu graduated this month from Fletcher’s Meadow Secondary School and is enrolled in the University of Waterloo Mathematical Physics program.\n\nNearly $20,000 in scholarships was presented at the annual awards ceremony in Mississauga.\n\nIfeoluwa Kolade was the recipient of the $2,000 Darlene & Derek Quashie scholarship.\n\nThe York University Residence Life co-ordinator will start Law studies at Osgoode Hall in September.\n\n“I have always had an interest in human rights law,” said the McGill University International Development & Economics graduate.\n\nMigrating from Nigeria at age eight, Kolade did a four-month internship in 2015 at the Geneva International Centre for Justice and was the War Child Canada (McGill Student chapter) treasurer for 29 months.\n\nTurned on to aviation five years ago, Andrew Winchester recently graduated from Centennial College’s Aviation technician-Avionics maintenance program and begins an apprenticeship next month at Flying Colour Corp. in Peterborough.\n\n“I was looking to the trades and considering carpentry when I stumbled on this aviation program,” he said. “I have a son that’s due in August and I am so happy that I am on the right track where I will be able to take care of him.”"
