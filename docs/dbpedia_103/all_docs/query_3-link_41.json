        "text": "On July 1st 1989, only five years after its foundation, and shortly after establishing missions in Italy and Peru, the Institute of the Incarnate Word (IVE) arrived to the United States of America (USA). Promptly on their arrival to New York City, Fr. Carlos Walker, IVE and Fr. Jose Lochedino, IVE commended themselves and all their work to an image of the Immaculate Conception gifted by Fr. Carlos Loyola, a good friend of our founder Fr. Carlos Buela, IVE.\n\nIn 1992, after more than two years of pastoral work in the USA, Fr. Walker was assigned by Bishop Thomas Vose Daily as pastor of St. Gabriel’s Parish in the Diocese of Brooklyn. The presence of the Institute quickly spread throughout the USA with the addition of various parishes in diverse states such as: Massachusetts, California, Pennsylvania and Maryland.\n\nThe year 1995 marked the arrival of the IVE in Guyana and in 1998 the Institute arrived in Canada, thanks to His Eminence Aloysius Cardinal Ambrozic, Archbishop of Toronto. He entrusted the Institute with the care of St. Augustine of Canterbury Parish. Finally in 2012 the IVE established its first mission in Mexico, at St. Felipe de Jesus in the Yucatan’s capital city of Merida.\n\nIn 1997, in the Diocese of San Jose, California, the Institute opened its first Novitiate House within the Province, taking as its patrons the North American martyrs, St. Isaac Jogues and Companions. Several years later, the Institute moved the novitiate house from California to Mt. Rainier, MD.\n\nOn September 7th, 1998, the Institute opened its first seminary thanks to the help of His Eminence James Cardinal Hickey, then Cardinal-Archbishop of Washington, D.C. The Venerable Fulton Sheen House of Formation, as it was named, originally opened its doors in Cheverly, MD, and later moved to Chillum, MD due to the need of more space for the growing number of seminarians.\n\nIn 2008, in order to provide young men in high school with an opportunity to beginning following their vocation, the province opened the Saint Jose Sanchez del Rio Minor Seminary in Mankato, MN."
