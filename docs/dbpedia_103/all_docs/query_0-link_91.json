        "text": "With growing Muslim population in Europe and recent influx of migrants, it is vital to analyze schooling options available to Muslim parents in terms of Islamic studies in public and private sector. This research will accordingly help Muslim community and governments to plan their way forward in a number of ways such as teacher training, curriculum design, operating private schools and other aspects. In current study, we have analyzed a large body of academic research, news and opinions of various community members. Our findings from this explorative research identify a number of difference from country to country. Some countries consider confessional education where-as other provide it in a non-confessional manner. Some have complete separation between Church and state whereas others are heavily influenced by Church and accordingly reflect this in their educational policies. We also find out that financial situation of Muslim communities is generally not very strong and they are reliant on foreign funding to meet their basic religious needs e.g. having a place of worship or a mosque. Most of this support is found to be coming from Turkey or Saudi Arabia. Our findings also highlight the importance of Sunday or weekend schools as most of the communities where adequate confessional Islamic knowledge is not available through public education system and Islamic schools cannot be established, they are helping the communities in imparting religious knowledge they consider important for their children.\n\nThe critiques of the community have been arguing that Muslims have misplaced priority. They want to send their children to madrasas rather than to modern educational institution. “we discover that for some reason or the other many Muslims in the country choose to cut themselves off from the mainstream of social change and progress, they persist with Madrassah education to the neglect of general education for their children, they discourage female education and generally pursue methods which cannot but act as a hindrance in their march towards social advancement”, argued H.M.Patel (Kamal Sandesh: October 16-31, 2015). But, it has been found that due to poverty most of the families are not been able to send their ward to school. A high drop-out has been reported among the Muslims. Between the age of 6-13 years, 4.4 percent of Muslim students are out-of-school as compared to 4.2 percent of Scheduled Tribes children. To deal with this situation, overall budget on the education should be increased by the government, both at the centre and states.\n\nMuslims are a religious group who make up about 4.8% of the population in the United Kingdom. Over 500,000 Muslim children attend public schools where Christianity is basically taught alongside different religions, church schools that promote different Christian sects and teach Christianity, or one of the over 120 Muslim schools where Islam is taught. In this study I will examine the place of religious education practices by taking one of the Islamic schools receiving state support under the UK education system, which supported their educational activities in the 2012-2013 academic year. The school that is the topic of my investigation was opened in 1983 as a pre- and primary school; in 1998 it began to utilize the state support that parish schools benefit from. The school is a superior school through its representative strength of Muslims on the points of providing religious continuity in a Christian and secular society and creating an Islamic environment. This school, which captures academic success, provides students from an early age with education in the scope of basic Islamic research under three basic headings: Islamic studies (akaid, morality, siyer, Koranic commentary, and hadiths), the Arabic language, and Islamic art and music. In this context, Muslim students of different races and cultures have an educational environment where they can learn their own religions around the common component of Islam. This school, which adopts a religious educational approach over denominations, supports religious education through social and cultural activities outside of the course curriculum, such as are in parish schools.\n\nThis chapter provides a general theory of the salient concerns affecting Muslims in education across the globe today, from Muslims in Muslim majority countries to Muslims as minority citizens. From concerns around resource investment in educational infrastructure to anxieties over curricula and pedagogy, matters affecting Muslims in education differ the world over, where Muslims in education can often conjure up more uncertainties than positives. The experience affects not only young children at the nucleus of the attention but also parents, teachers, education managers, as well as wider society. In rationalizing the political and sociological milieu in different societies, it emerges that the themes of religion, ethnicity, and gender are as significant as ideology, culture, and policy, but that they are set within the context of secularization, desecularization, sacralization and the re-sacralization of Islam in the public sphere. In order to generate a philosophical, spiritual, and intellectual evaluation of Muslim education across the world, this chapter synthesizes the apprehensions that are internal and external , local and global, and which affect all Muslims, minorities and majorities.\n\nThis article examines the need for the Muslim community of Britain to educate their youth with regard to a Muslim 'way of life'. The aim of this study is to examine the theological basis for Islamic education. It further explores the status of Muslim schools in Britain with regard to culture and religion. This study highlights the exclusiveness of Islamic education owing to Muslim ethnic cultures and the necessity for a more intercultural-oriented Islamic education.\n\nMuslim parents share many of the same ideals that other religious parents do when considering comprehensive religious schools. For those who see Islamic schooling as a viable option, supporters claim that these schools help to (1) preserve the culture and customs passed down from generation to generation, and (2) provide Muslim children with a proper identity consonant with one’s home environment, thereby ensuring a positive sense of self. In this article the author will explore the role that Muslim parents play in Islamic schooling; in particular the author will examine the reasons why those parents who favor Islamic schools do, and what they hope to gain either for themselves or their children by enrolling them."
