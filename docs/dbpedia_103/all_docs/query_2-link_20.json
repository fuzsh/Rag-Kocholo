After this date, the faithful would gather once a week in a rented protestant church, Grace United Church, at 156 Main St. N., at 12:30 pm. None of this would actually take place if it was not for the efforts and a big heart of Father Stanisław Bąk OMI, who as the first pastor of St. Maximilian Kolbe, strove to reach out and minister to many of his countrymen and women who settled in this neighbourhood.\n\nFirst three parish groups were established, namely the lectors, altar servers and Renew group.
