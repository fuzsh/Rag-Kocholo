(1970). Where do we go from here? (p. x).\n\nCitations in the educational biography provide context for Gerald Emmett Carter's thinking and writing.\n\nThe following excerpt is from an introduction to a volume of a series reflecting on the needs of adults with the changes following Vatican II. Introduction. Mariella, S., K. B. Osborne, A. Panzarella, J. Peterson, J. M. Petulla. (1970). Where do we go from here? (p. x).\n\nIt is to meet this need that the present series has been devised. As I understand the purposes of the authors and editors, this is something relatively new. It is an attempt to express \"in intelligible and discussable\" form the basic problems of the theological day.\n\nThe psychology behind the attempt is that \"No man [sic] can give of his own wisdom to another man.\" The only answers, even in the faith, are \"my\" answers. The assent of faith must be personal, loving, and convinced. It must also be enlightened. We are attempting here not exactly to give answers, but to suggest the direction in which the answers lie. We are not attempting to present pat solutions which anyone can read and find peace. This is not the peace of our day. The mood is reflective rather than dogmatic, suggestive rather than indicative. It will help no one who is not prepared to help himself. But having read the essays, I am convinced that they are, on the whole, a sound presentation of insights into the Church of today and the problems facing the Catholic of today.\n\nI would not have this statement interpreted as saying that I agree with everything written in these texts. Indeed I would consider such a condition as something of a tragedy. One of the lessons which we have learned is that there are many areas in which honest Christians must disagree somewhat, in order to clarify the truth. As a bishop, however, I would not be writing this introduction if I thought there was anything herein which was contrary to the teaching of the Church. But one can be a faithful Catholic and still find a great deal of leeway in the investigation of our relationship with God and God's relationship with us. What a dull Church this would be if we all had to agree with one another about everything. But I am sure that anyone who reads these essays, and discusses them with an open and intelligent approach, will come from the process much wiser and even much surer of his faith than he was when he began. This in itself is very good.\n\nRecommended Readings\n\nHiggins, M. W. & Letson, D. R. (1990). My Father's business: A biography of His Eminence G. Emmett Cardinal Carter. .
