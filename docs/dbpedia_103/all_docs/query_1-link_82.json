Here’s where\n\nThe 85 spots were quickly filled, while 50 children were put on the school’s waiting list.\n\nSeveral callers told Stafford they want their children in the Catholic school system despite not being religious.\n\nDid you have to line up or put your kid on a waiting list for a good school?
