        "text": "Dear Peel District School Board Families:\n\nFurther to our communication earlier this week, we are writing to share some additional information, including updates and reminders on:\n\nNew effective date for Elementary Learning Model Switch\n\nSchools to remain open on September 30 - National Day for Truth and Reconciliation\n\nOnline Learning Family Handbook\n\nElection Polls at Two PDSB Secondary Schools\n\nSchool-based COVID-19 vaccination clinics\n\nProtect yourselves and others from COVID-19\n\nWe apologize for the length of this email. Please read the information thoroughly and reach out to your school directly if you have any questions.\n\nWe thank you for all patience and understanding as we continue to navigate this evolving landscape of teaching and learning.\n\nSeptember 29, 2021 is the new effective date for Elementary Learning Model Switch\n\n(Note: The following information is important. Please connect with your school for support if you require assistance with translation.)\n\nFor those elementary families (JK-Grade 8) who switched their child(ren)’s learning model from in-person to online or from online to in-person, please note that the effective date of this switch has been changed to Wednesday, September 29, 2021. Your child(ren) must remain in their current learning model until this time.\n\nThis extension is required to verify data related to the learning model switches and to ensure staff are appropriately assigned to the newly adjusted classes. Please have your child(ren) continue in their current learning model until Wednesday,September 29, 2021. For child(ren) who will be home until this revised date, online learning materials will be available for them to continue their schoolwork at times convenient for your family.\n\nWe appreciate your patience as we work to ensure your child(ren)’s educational, social and emotional needs are met in their selected learning model.\n\nSchools to remain open on September 30 - National Day for Truth and Reconciliation\n\nAs you may know, the Government of Canada recently passed legislation to designate September 30, the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, a federal statutory holiday for all federally regulated employees.\n\nWe would like to inform all PDSB families that September 30 has not been declared a statutory holiday in the province of Ontario and therefore schools will remain open on that day. This national day ensures the opportunity to recognize and remember the legacy of colonialism through the Residential School System, which more than 150,000 First Nations, Métis and Inuit children were forced to attend between the 1870s and 1997.\n\nOn Sept. 30, students and staff will engage in meaningful learning experiences to learn the history, legacy and impact of the Residential School System on First Nations, Métis and Inuit families, as well as develop ways to participate in reconciliation.\n\nOnline Learning family handbook\n\nModern Learning is more about the journey than the destination. As we uncover and acknowledge our past and commit to a better future, a focus on models of learning that centre student identity is needed. Equitable assessment practices must be transparent and focused on student excellence and well-being. Learning environments must honour critical thought, adaptability, innovation, understanding that these concepts look different and have different implications for each learner.\n\nTo guide students and families who are currently learning online, we developed the 2021-22 PDSB Online Learning family handbook, available on the board’s Reopening Plans page.\n\nFamilies who have additional questions can speak with their online school teacher or principal.\n\nElection Polls at two PDSB secondary schools\n\nElections Canada has approved two PDSB secondary schools -- Stephen Lewis Secondary School and John Fraser Secondary School -- for use as polling stations on Monday, September 20,2021. To reduce the number of people onsite at each school and to help keep students and staff safe, all classes at these two secondary schools will be moved to online learning, within the Community Learning Model, for the entire school day on Monday, September 20, 2021.\n\nIf your child(ren) attends Stephen Lewis Secondary School or John Fraser Secondary School, please DO NOT send them to school on Monday, September 20, 2021, as all classes will be online for the entire school day.\n\nTo learn if you’re eligible to vote at these two PDSB sites, please visit Elections.ca where you can enter your postal code to identify your specific polling location.\n\nSchool-based COVID-19 vaccination clinics*\n\nWe would like to remind you that COVID-19 vaccination clinics hosted by Peel Public Health are continuing to operate out of the following schools for Peel residents.\n\nBelow is a list of school-based COVID-19 vaccination clinic locations as well and their availability.\n\n*Dates and times are subject to change.\n\nAll school-based clinics accept walk-ins or you can book an appointment online. For more information, regarding what is needed to know before coming to these clinics, please refer to https://www.peelregion.ca/coronavirus/vaccine/appointment-prep/\n\nProtect yourselves and others\n\nWe would like to remind you once again that as responsible members of the community, we need to take an active role in protecting ourselves and others from COVID-19. Please ensure that you are following all PDSB protocols to ensure the health and safety of students and staff in schools."
