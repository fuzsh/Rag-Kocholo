        "text": "Toronto's 10th Roman Catholic Archbishop was installed during a special service Tuesday morning at St. Michael's Cathedral. Thomas Collins took up the responsibilities saying he enjoys the work.\n\n\"I love being a priest, I love being a bishop,\" Collins said Tuesday morning.\n\n\"It's an honour, it's a privilege, it's a grace and I'm just so grateful for the Lord to call me to this mission to serve the church as a priest and as a bishop.\"\n\nArchbishop Collins replaces Aloysius Cardinal Ambrozic, who announced his retirement in December.\n\nOn Dec. 16 the Vatican announced that Collins, who was serving as the Archbishop of Edmonton, had been appointed to lead the largest Catholic diocese in Canada.\n\nDuring Tuesday morning's service, Ambrozic had high praise for the man replacing him.\n\n\"It's nice to have a very fine bishop whom I have admired for a long time and also who has a scripture doctorate like myself,\" Ambrozic said.\n\nThe transition for Collins is a big one. Edmonton's diocese has about 350,000 Catholics. By comparison, Toronto has about 1.6 million followers in 223 parishes.\n\nThe job change came as a surprise to Collins. When he was told by the Vatican of his new appointment, his only response was \"Oh.\"\n\nCollins added that he is looking forward to meeting his new parishioners.\n\nA native of Ontario, Collins did theological and other religious study in London and Rome, including at the prestigious Gregorian Pontifical University.\n\nCollins was ordained a priest in 1973 for the diocese of Hamilton, and went on to serve in various posts, including rector of St. Peter Seminary in London, where he had previously studied from 1995 to 1997.\n\nIn 1997, he was ordained a bishop, transferring to Edmonton in 1999.\n\nHe is the 12th Bishop and 10th Archbishop of Toronto to lead the diocese since it was established in 1842."
