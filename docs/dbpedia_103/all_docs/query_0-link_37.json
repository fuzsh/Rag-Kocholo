        "text": "Canada is considered one of the most multicultural countries in the world due to the richness of its diverse cultural heritage. It is evident that among these various groups, black Canadians are succeeding in making their mark in Canada’s history.\n\nBy becoming the first African-Canadian to achieve success in a specific field, role models pave the way for aspiring enthusiasts to overcome racial barriers.\n\nFor instance, the Honourable Jean Augustine was the first African-Canadian woman elected to the Parliament of Canada. She also introducted a motion to have February declared as Black History Month in Canada. The honourable Lincoln Alexander was the first African-Canadian elected to the House of Commons, as well as the first African-Canadian Lieutenant Governor of Ontario.\n\nIn particular the Right Honourable Michaëlle Jean represented racial, linguistic, cultural and political diversity in Canada, as the first black African-Canadian Governor General.\n\nOriginally from Haiti, Michaëlle Jean brings the English and French linguistic and historical heritage together. Her family was forced to emigrate due to persecution under the Duvalier dictatorship. Jean’s multilingual capabilities enabled her to effectively preside as the Governor General of Canada. She is versatile in the two official Canadian languages (English and French), as well as Haitian Creole, Italian and Spanish. Her fluency in these languages is a true asset seeing that she is able to interact with many different communities of people.\n\nIn addition to her linguistic facility, her warm and inviting personality allowed her to be welcomed among various groups. Jean’s ability to mix culturally with all peoples was exemplified when she attended an Inuit ceremony, in which the custom was to eat a piece of raw seal heart. Despite the fact that she was condemned for her actions, critics failed to realize that she was respecting the Inuit culture as a guest in their community.\n\nJean was capable of representing black Canadians in a dignified manner, by overcoming differences and social barriers, in order to build relationships with other cultures and races. She also prides herself in supporting young people through the Michaëlle Jean Foundation as one of her major social projects.\n\nIn terms of political contribution, Jean elected to use her power and influence to work towards equality for everyone. As an escapee from the Duvalier dictatorship Jean understood the breadth of political and economic oppression experienced by many new Canadians.\n\nShe is currently a UNESCO Ambassador, providing support for Haiti to recover from the destruction of the 2010 earthquake. In addition she exhibits pride in her Haitian heritage through her distinctive coat of arms in Rideau Hall. For the first time black people have a coat of arms that represents the triumph of black ancestors from slavery, as well as the African and black presence in Canada at the federal level of government.\n\nOn Canada Day in 2009 my Grandmother, Dr. Yvonne Brown, brought my brother and me to Parliament Hill in Ottawa to participate in the celebration. As the crowd spilled over into Wellington Street, I recall the astonishment I felt upon seeing Michaëlle Jean, a black woman, beside Prime Minister Stephen Harper. It is that memory that led me to choose Jean for this essay. Her remarkable achievements have motivated me as a young black woman.\n\nJean had to overcome racial and gender biases in order to be nominated to hold high office. She combines a generosity of spirit with a consciousness of her Haitian heritage to be successful in all her roles. Jean is an activist who combines her enormous intellect with her kind regard for humanity to achieve justice and equality.\n\nIt is important as African-Canadians to remember our predecessor’ constant struggle for equality. Without their determination we would not have been able to achieve emancipation from slavery, nor attain civil and human rights equal to our white counterparts.\n\nOur ancestors have been able to succeed due to the efforts of peoples such as Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr., and our very own Michaëlle Jean. Their achievements have exemplified the ability of black people worldwide to provide a shining beacon of leadership in the pursuit of equality.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nGalloway, Gloria. “Governor-General applauded, denounced for eating raw seal.” www.theglobeandmail.com .
