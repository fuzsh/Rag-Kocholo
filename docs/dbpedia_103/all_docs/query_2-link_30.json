        "text": "November is the month of Remembrance. For Catholics this is a special time of year, as we are reminded of the importance of the feasts of All Saints Day and All Souls Day.\n\nAll Saints’ Day, celebrated on November 1st, reminds our community of those men and women (both known and unknown) who have lived faithful lives in the Church. On this day, we remember our saints in our prayers and ask for their prayers and intercessions. The historical roots of this celebration have to do with those martyrs who died in the early Church. Later, Pope Gregory VII declared this day to be the date we remember all who lived and died for their faith.\n\nAll Souls Day, November 2nd, is a Roman Catholic day of remembrance for friends and loved ones who have passed away. The day purposely follows All Saints’ Day in order to shift the focus from those in heaven to those in purgatory. It is celebrated with masses and festivities in honour of the dead. While the Feast of All Saints is a day to remember the glories of Heaven and those there, the Feast of All Souls reminds us of our obligations to live holy lives and that there will be purification of the souls of those destined for Heaven.\n\nIndigenous Veterans Day was established in Manitoba in 1994 and has since spread across the country to the other provinces and has been renamed National Indigenous Veterans Day, recognized annually on Nov. 8. It’s a day to recognize and acknowledge the many contributions and sacrifices of Indigenous peoples not only to Canada’s war efforts but to its peacekeeping reputation.\n\nOn November 11th, Canadians all across the country stop and honour those who have served, at home or overseas, in World War I, World War II, Korea and in all peace missions all around the world. Memorial services pay tribute to the more than 100,000 brave Canadians who were killed in the service of their country. The World War I Armistice was signed on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. As such, we stop and remember on the 11th hour of November 11th.\n\nWe are pleased to let you know that picture day is Thursday, November 18th! Students will be able to take individual photos, however, no full class photos will be taken at this time. Please note that we currently do not have a re-take day scheduled and may only have one if necessary and subject to photographer availability.\n\nIf your child is currently in one of our remote learning classrooms, their teacher will share your timeslot with you. If you choose to have your child's photo taken, please make every effort to come at your scheduled time as we must keep cohorts separate.\n\nHave a look at our photo day reminder from Edge Imaging for more details.\n\nAs we continue to follow public health guidelines for Covid-19 prevention, we'd like to remind you of some important protocols we must follow at the school as per Peel Public Health directives.\n\n1. Parents and Visitors to the School: There are absolutely NO visitors allowed in the school unless by Principal approved appointment. This is to ensure safety of students and staff and for contact tracing purposes.\n\n2. Pizza days, Lunch moms and lunch drop off are no longer available. Students will need to come to school with a full lunch and snacks.\n\n3. Morning Entry Procedures: All students have been assigned a door to enter the school in the morning. This is the only door they are permitted to use. There is no yard play. Students will enter the building upon arrival and head straight to their classrooms. Staff are on duty in the school to assist this process. Kindergarten will continue to use their K classroom doors.\n\n4. Recess/Breaks: Students will have their recess breaks within their assigned zones in the school yard and will remain with their cohorts for recess. School staff will support students in this.\n\n5. Afterschool Exit: Staff will be assisting students to load the busses. Students have been assigned specific seats and they have all been issued Bus ID cards. The cards have student seat number listed. Please review this with your child as they will lose their bus privileges if they do not stay in that seat. The seating lists have been shared with the Bus drivers as well. Where ever possible, students are seated either with a sibling, with a classmate, or alone. Please note that this is not always possible and that each bus is considered a separate cohort for students.\n\n6. Masks: Just a reminder that masks are mandatory for all students The expectation is that students maintain a physical distance of 1 metre from other students; this protocol is very similar to last year's expectation."
