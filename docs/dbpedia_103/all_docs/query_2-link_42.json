        "text": "Gill 1\n\nSatvir Gill\n\nMr. Eduful\n\nHRE-4M\n\n14 November 2022\n\nMorality and Ethical Thought Midterm Assignment\n\nUltimate Purpose; Common Good vs Infinite Good: Throughout Unit 1, our guiding question explored ways to search for the good. Using major topics from Unit 1, answer the following question: What is Good?\n\nWhat is good? When Good is put under the spotlight with the intent of defining it, we come up with numerous viable answers. We can say it is God’s will or the nice thing to do, but when we dig deeper, we realize Good is the morally and ethically right action that makes people around you happy. This brings up the question of who determines what is the appropriate thing to do, if that is in fact the correct answer to our million-dollar question. We need to investigate further while employing a critical lens to be able to respond to the question of what is good, and the three worldviews are an excellent location to start our investigation. The Cosmocentric perspective holds that all of creation is infused with spiritual energy and that it is a reflection of nature, which is at the center of our universe. An example of those who identify with the Cosmocentric worldview are the Indigenous people that are spiritually connected to the land of North America, who use their connection filled with love for nature to attain what is good. Moving on, the theocentric viewpoint places God at the centre of all reality. Christians are an example of a group who invest in this viewpoint, where the goal of life is to discover the route that returns one to God through the saviour and Messiah, Jesus Christ, allowing them to attain good. Additionally, the Anthropocentric worldview is the belief that humans are at the centre of all things, where individuals adhere to humanism, which centres on the needs of only the people. The Anthropocentric view essentially implies that as human and moral agents, we must use our free will to attain good. With our deepened and highly knowledgeable understanding of the three world views, we can begin to gain traction on our journey of pinpointing the true definition of what good is. Branching off the comprehension of the three worldviews, one must comprehend the complex concepts of ethics and morality. The word &quot;ethics&quot; is derived from the Greek word &quot;Ethika,&quot; which means having to do with excellent character. The pursuit of goodness that humans aim for is subordinate to ethics. Ethics are the principles that are accepted in relation to certain behaviours within individuals, concerning society and organizations. The vast ethical framework that gives humans a way to organize their acts while still staying morally and legally acceptable also paves the way for morality. The word &quot;morality&quot; is derived from the Greek word &quot;Moralitas,&quot; which denotes manners, traits, character, and behaviour and says “do not cause pain”. The individualized guiding principles of right and wrong behaviour are known as one’s moral compass, guiding them from personal beliefs built upon ethics. Morality describes how ethics is interpreted in light of a person&#039;s beliefs and ideals. The foundation of morality is ethics, which explains how people form their own ideas and then relate them to form &quot;social norms&quot; (that further lead to social determinism) that pressure people to act in certain ways within society. Based on our understanding of ethics and morality, one may conclude that doing what society dictates is right is good. However, in the case of our exposition, one must also consider the philosophical definition of what is good and right in order to formulate and comprehend the answer to what good truly is. Beginning with Aristotle and his\n\nGill 2\n\ntheory of teleological ethics, which stems from the Greek words “telos” meaning “end” and “logos” meaning “science”. Aristotle believes that a person can only find true happiness in community. According to teleological ethics, in order to identify the good, one must be a rational thinker because everything and everyone in the world strives to attain some good. Teleological ethics also states that we should avoid excess (such as consumerism and commodity forms) and seek moderation (balance in life). Moreover, the discussion of Emanuel Kant and deontological ethics examines both theoretical and practical reasoning, with theoretical reasoning being what people do and practical reasoning being what people should do. Kant continues by discussing the relevance of the highest good in one&#039;s life as well as how good is the goal of a moral existence as both moral and human agents. God, freedom, and immortality, according to Kant, are the three things that can lead to the attainment of the supreme good. Kant also discusses the responsibility and duty of individuals as well as the maxims that claim everyone would always make the right decision if given adequate time to consider their options. Finally, we will discuss Levinas and rational ethics, where Levinas addresses the uniqueness of the face and how good is limitless. According to Levinas, God is present in everyone, and that goodness transcends mere existence. He thinks that the uniqueness of the face of everyone can reveal God and good as everyone was made in God’s image and retains a part of God. After considering the three philosophical perspectives on what constitutes virtue, our definition of good can be formulated once again to be the search for true happiness. Although this new definition can satisfy our needs to a certain degree, we must continue in order to generate a definition that satisfies the question as a whole. According to Bishop Robert Barren, it is not power, pleasure, wealth, or honour that are good, because these four things only produce transient joy which may be taken away from anyone at any time for any reason. According to Bishop Robert Baron, knowing the truth “the reality of God” is what brings true bliss. The only one who can satisfy our insatiable longing for happiness is God, and he alone is the only solution. This implies that goodness equals God, which is in fact the truth we began our search for. With the application of this knowledge, we can go further as good is split into two categories, the infinite good and the common good. The truth that serves the vast majority of people is the common good. Ethics and morality are necessary to achieve good because they give everyone an equal chance to search for the truth and happiness. On the other hand, the kingdom of God&#039;s Heaven, which is where humans can be one with God, is the ultimate purpose for everyone (the infinite good), as revealed by the beatitudes and Bishop Robert Barrens&#039; idea on Beatitiudo. It is beyond this world in which humans live and we must continue our search beyond the material world itself, allowing us to attain good."
