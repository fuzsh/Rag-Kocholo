His biography is a remarkable one, a journey from Slovenia to an Austrian refugee camp and to Canada where he became Cardinal Ambrozic, Archbishop of Toronto. He was the ninth Archbishop of Toronto and the fourth Cardinal of English-speaking Canada, preceded by Cardinals McGuigan, Flahiff, and Carter.\n\nEARLY YEARS\n\nAloysius Ambrozic was born in Gaberje, Slovenia, January 27th, 1930, the second of seven children. He attended elementary school in Dobrova and high school in Ljubjana. In May of 1945, the entire family fled to Austria, where they lived in the displaced persons camps. In these camps, he completed his high school education.\n\nIn September of 1948, the Ambrozic family emigrated to Canada and settled near Toronto. Soon after, Aloysius entered St. Augustine's Seminary to study philosophy and theology. When he entered in September he knew only a few words of English. By Christmas he had become fluent in his new tongue. He soon topped his class in every subject. The staff recognized him as a genius. He excelled even in recreation. Many seminarians spent their free time climbing Scarborough Bluffs at the south of St. Augustine's Seminary property. A contemporary says of Aloysius Ambrozic: \"He was the greatest cliff climber 'ever;' he was able to reach the peak of the highest cliffs.\" Because he excelled in all subjects, the teachers at St. Augustine's already foresaw him as a Seminary professor.\n\nPRIESTHOOD\n\nOn June 4, 1955 Aloysius Ambrozic was ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of Toronto by James Cardinal McGuigan. He first served as curate at St. Teresa's parish in Port Colborne for one year. He then taught Latin for a year at St. Augustine's Seminary. In the years of 1957-1960, he took post-graduate studies in Rome, where he received a Licentiate in Theology at the Angelicum and a Licentiate in Sacred Scripture at the Pontifical Biblical Institute.\n\nReturning to Toronto, he taught Scripture at St. Augustine's Seminary from 1960-67. In 1967, he began further studies in Germany and obtained a Doctorate in Theology from the University of Wurzburg in 1970. From 1970-76, he was professor of New Testament Exegesis at the Toronto School of Theology and was Dean of Studies at St. Augustine's Seminary from 1971-76.\n\nBISHOP\n\nHe was ordained Auxiliary Bishop of Toronto in May 1976, under Archbishop Philip Pocock. His responsibilities with the Archdiocese included pastoral care of the Central Region and of the ethnic communities. During the school year of 1984-85, he made a pastoral visitation to all forty-three of the Catholic high schools of the Archdiocese to strengthen and support religious education programs. He was a member of the Christian Education Commission of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops. He was active in the revision of the Canadian Catechism. He was elected one of the four Bishops to represent Canada at the 1990 Roman Synod on the Formation of Priests.\n\nARCHBISHOP AND CARDINAL\n\nIn May 1986 he became coadjutor Archbishop of Toronto under Cardinal Carter and ascended to the position of Archbishop of Toronto on March 17, 1990. He also served on the Roman Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants (1990), the Congregation for the Clergy (1991), the Pontifical Council for Culture (1993), and the Congregation for Divine Worship (1999).\n\nIn 1998, he was created a Cardinal by Pope John Paul. His first words at St. Michael's Cathedral were \"I have been introduced as Prince of the Church, yet I only wish to be shepherd and servant of all.\"\n\nIn 2002, he hosted World Youth Day in Toronto, the greatest gathering of young people in the history of Canada. He also helped elect Pope Benedict XVI in the 2005 papal conclave in Rome.\n\nCULTURE WAR\n\nCardinal Ambrozic faced two major problems. The increased secularization of society expressed first in anti-life legislation in public society and its consequent impact on the Catholic school system, specifically through increased theological dissent among teachers. The latter organized themselves in a group of eventually some 1200 teachers, with Joanna Manning and the bi-weekly Catholic New Times as their mouth pieces. Dissent eventually evolved into heresy and open opposition.\n\nOn the family front in the culture war, Cardinal Ambrozic undertook challenging actions. His interventions often came at the behest of pro-life activists who sometimes pressed uncomfortable nerves.\n\nIn 1999 he spoke against a Supreme Court ruling granting spousal benefits to practicing homosexual couples warning presciently that it would \"serve to undermine our traditional understanding of marriage and family, and the nature of spousal and conjugal relationships.\"\n\nBy 2003 as the same-sex 'marriage' battle was in full swing he sent a letter to all Toronto parishes urging priests, \"It is imperative that we speak publicly and clearly about what is referred to as 'same-sex marriage.\n\nIn 2005, he wrote to the Prime Minister asking for legislation to protect traditional marriage and warning that public schools would be forced to teach children that homosexual 'marriage' was equivalent to traditional marriage. He backed the famous marriage rally in Ottawa which saw 15,000 Canadians make a last ditch effort to protect marriage.\n\n[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]\n\nMore troubling than merely having to take part in the culture war in the public square, was having to clean up the mess in-house. Weeks after it was revealed that a Toronto priest had filed an affidavit in support of same-sex 'marriage', Cardinal Ambrozic suspended Fr. Tim Ryan's priestly faculties.\n\nOne of the most difficult stances Cardinal Ambrozic made in support of life was to stand up publicly against Development and Peace and many of his brother bishops represented by the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (CCCB) over the March of Women in 2000.\n\nIn 2000 D&P was funding a pro-abortion and pro-lesbian feminist cause known as the March of Women. While the March was also in support of legitimate women's rights such as relief of poverty, oppression, and discrimination against women, the organizers were decidedly pro-abortion and pro-lesbian, and included those motifs powerfully in the March of Women agenda.\n\nIn the United States, bishops totally boycotted the March for those reasons,. In Canada, however, the CCCB backed the March. However, Cardinal Ambrozic led the way for a handful of bishops to publicly object to the participation and funding of the pro-abortion March. He instructed ShareLife to cut funding to D&P by $15,000 in protest to the Catholic agency's support for the March. In a letter to all priests in the Toronto archdiocese, Cardinal Ambrozic wrote, \"many of our clergy and laity have queried the involvement of Development and Peace. The association of D&P with this group is indeed unfortunate and we need to make a definite statement to disassociate our archdiocese with this movement through D&P.\"\n\nIt was not easy though for Cardinal Ambrozic to bear the criticism he received over his leadership in this regard, especially from his brother bishops. To indicate how severe the division was it is instructive to recall that despite his public protest, D&P and the CCCB released a public letter of reaffirmation of their support for the March of Women. Beyond that, six Canadian bishops concelebrated a Mass for the March of Women--all at a time when only one Canadian bishop (a retired one) was celebrating the Mass for the annual March for Life in the national capital.\n\nOn other occasions Cardinal Ambrozic's personal positions were not always shared by those within his chancery. At times communication with the Cardinal was difficult. He often felt pushed by pro-life Catholics to undertake difficult choices and at times tempers flared.\n\nThe annual Toronto Red Mass dinner hosted by the Toronto Catholic Lawyers' Guild, was another focus for disagreement. The annual dinner which is followed by the Red Mass--usually celebrated by the Archbishop of Toronto--was having a keynote address by former Prime Minister and Progressive Conservative Party Leader Joe Clark, a Catholic who supported both abortion and same-sex unions.\n\nAs the date for the dinner approached various Catholic lawyers and politicians were boycotting the dinner due to the scandalous selection of the keynote speaker. However, organizers of the dinner were sure that the Cardinal would attend, and celebrate the annual Mass. Then, just a couple of days prior to the event, information was conveyed that the Cardinal would not be attending the Red Mass dinner. \"He had another commitment.\"\n\nThe Cardinal did however celebrate the Red Mass. With former Prime Minister Clark sitting front and centre, Archbishop Ambrozic delivered a homily that likely still remains with many to this day. Speaking of \"the suffering of the babies who are being aborted,\" the Cardinal said, \"the people who are pro-abortion think that somehow they don't feel the horrible pain that accompanies every death. I don't know one piece of living flesh that doesn't feel the pain when life is being gouged out of it.\"\n\nRETIREMENT AND DEATH\n\nJust short of age 76 Cardinal Ambrozic retired on December 16, 2006. Upon his retirement the Cardinal issued a Statement in which he said in part:\n\n\"I have been privileged and truly blessed to have served as a bishop for 30 years and as Archbishop of Toronto for 16 years. In this time, I have come across many wonderful and faithful Catholics who have given of themselves for the love of the Church. I have always been grateful to serve in an Archdiocese so rich in diversity--it is one of our greatest gifts and as someone who came to this country from overseas, I have grown to appreciate the uniqueness of each parish, each community, each ethnic group.\"\n\nAfter a period in which the Cardinal was able to enjoy his retirement in prayer, study, reading, visiting friends and regular walks, he came down with a particularly vicious illness called Progressive Supernuclear Palsy (paralysis). It is a rare disease that gradually destroys the nerve cells in the parts of the brain that control eye movements, breathing and muscle co-ordination. The loss of nerve cells causes palsy or paralysis that slowly gets worse as the disease progresses. The palsy affects ability to move the eyes, relax the muscles and control balance. There is no known cure.\n\nWhen Cardinal Ambrozic could no longer be cared for in his home he was admitted to the Cardinal Ambrozic Houses of Providence in the Providence Health Care Centre on November 23, 2009. He was looked after night and day by male nurses. Although most days he assisted at Mass in a wheel chair, he was unable to concelebrate. A quiet celebration was held on his 80th birthday in the presence of relatives and priests of the Houses of Providence. Although he was present, the Cardinal was unable to participate.\n\nAfter years of intense suffering, Cardinal Ambrozic died at about 9 a.m. in the Scarborough General Hospital on Friday, August 26, 2011. He was 81 years old and had been a priest for 56 years. Interment was at Holy Cross Cemetery, where Archbishop Pocock and Cardinal Carter are also interred.\n\nGENERAL ASSESSMENT\n\nAlthough he was an intellectual giant, Cardinal Ambro zic shunned publicity. He sold the mansion in Rosedale where Archbishop Pocock and Cardinal Carter entertained guests, and bought a small house near the Chancery Office where he could enjoy peace and quiet.\n\nHe had a deep empathy for the difficulties endured by refugees and immigrants and served on a number of committees to help them. He was faithful to the Church's Magisterium in opposing the teaching of sex-education in Catholic schools, same-sex marriage, the ordination of women, and abortion. A retired Catholic schoolteacher, K. McGilly said the Archbishop secretly gave bursaries to students out of his own pocket. He made sure they never found out the source.\n\nBesides his knowledge of Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, His Eminence was fluent in Slovenian, German, Italian and English.\n\nAs Father Ambrozic, he published The Hidden Kingdom, a Redaction--Critical Study of the References to the Kingdom of God in Mark's Gospel (Washington, 1972). In 1974, he wrote Remarks on the Canadian Catechism. He has written many articles of a professional and popular nature. His articles were published regularly in the Catholic Register.\n\nA LEGACY\n\nThe memorial card printed after the death of Cardinal Ambrozic gives us his philosophical, theological and spiritual legacy:\n\n\"It is Jesus to Whom we look. It is Jesus Whom we imitate It is Jesus Whom we follow. It is Jesus Who is with us so we can be with Him. Yes, we work with others. Yes, we learn from others. But in Jesus we find our ultimate identity and purpose. He is the Alpha and the Omega for each one of us and for every human being.\n\n--Aloysius Cardinal Ambrozic\"\n\nMay he rest in peace!\n\nObituary by Msgr.
