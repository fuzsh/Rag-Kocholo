I have a thorough understanding and knowledge of the game. My coach(es) and teammates would describe me as a team leader and tough defender, and can always rely on me to do my best. I have been captain/co-captain since 2021. I am both right and left footed, and have great core strength. I recognize my weaknesses and I'm working hard to improve on them. I am a lover of all sports, but soccer is my passion."
