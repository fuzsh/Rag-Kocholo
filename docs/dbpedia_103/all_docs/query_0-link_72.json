She quit her profitable yet unfulfilling corporate course her Latchman ’91 made a decision that changed the job, disposed of most of her belongings, and moved to Belize, Central America to do missionary work. In her words, “I wanted more out of my life. I had heard about this mission and I decided to take a big risk. I have never looked back.” She found herself working with 25 other international volunteer first-year teachers at a small missionary school, and recalls, “It was a real eye-opening experience. Those who worked at the school were so dedicated. I was in awe of them and also of the students, many of whom had to walk miles to get to school. Even though there were little or no employment prospects for them and no university to go to, they were just very happy to go to school and learn.” The living arrangements in Belize were basic: no hot water nor St. Mary’s orphanage in Malawi, Africa.

Although Bonita Latchman gave up a profitable busi- ness career, she has no regrets and could not be happier with the decision she made back in 1994. “I have applied what I learned in those countries, and my life is all the richer for it. I am confident that the students we took to Africa feel the same.” She tries to teach her current students the basic lessons she learned – to be grateful for what you have and to try to make a difference, however small, in the world. Of her present calling she says, “It is not always a perfect career, but it is often inspiring – I’m very happy being a teacher.” 8 By Christine Henry ‘96 Bonita Latchman at the 2nd graduation of Mt.

On 12 March, he told us, “Pope John Paul II called for and presided over a special service in St. Peter’s Basilica during which, in the name of the Catholic Church throughout the world, the following prayer was offered: God of our Fathers, you chose Abraham and his descendants To bring your name to the nations: His Eminence Edward Cardinal Cassidy and Rabbi Dow Marmur, We are deeply saddened by the behaviour of those Rabbi Emeritus of Holy Blossom Temple, Toronto (Photo: Michael Attridge) who in the course of history Have caused these children of yours to suffer, its theme, “Understanding Islam,” and is open to the And asking your forgiveness public.

Continuing Education / The Newman Centre Continuing Education at St. Mikes — Taking Leadership Seriously As a leader in Catholic Education for 150 years, St. Michael’s takes seriously its contribution to the for- mation of the leaders of tomorrow. College alumni have for many years personified the success of the undergraduate education which they received while enrolled in degree programs. More recently, our alumni circle has grown to include graduates of Certificate programs offered through the Continuing Education Division. We think it is worth noting that among Ontario’s thirty-four English Catholic school Newman Hall and St. Thomas Aquinas Chapel, 97 St. Joseph St. c. 1914 (Photo SMC Archive) boards, 12 Directors of Education have experienced either degree credit or certificate based professional learning at St. Michael’s. Along with ever increasing St Michael’s College and numbers of supervisory officers, principals and school chaplains, these alumni have become ambassadors for Catholic leadership throughout the the Newman Centre province. For nearly 90 of its first 150 years of service to Catholic educa- tion, St Michael’s College has been a close partner in the A partnership between St. Michael’s and the Newman Centre of the University of Toronto.

By David Wilson Leading cultural figures from Cape Breton gave “demonstra- tion” talks, in which they presented their own work, and located it within a broader historical and social context. In the morning session, prominent folklorist Seamus Watson told several Cape Breton folk tales, discussed the different genres of storytelling, and commented on the connection between language and folk culture. Lorrie MacKinnon, a Gaelic enthusiast living in Toronto, followed with a fascinat- ing talk on the poetry, themes, and melodic origins of the Gaelic songs she had discovered in the Mabou Ridge region. Lorrie sang excerpts from several of those songs. After lunch, David Greenberg, the well-known Cape Breton- classical cross-over musician, spoke on the history of Cape Breton fiddle music. As an unexpected bonus, he brought along Donald MacClelland, a legendary fig- ure in Cape Breton’s fiddle tradition. Together they played some wonderful strathspeys, jigs and reels. Since Donald is in his eighties, and rarely plays in public these days, it was a truly memorable moment.
