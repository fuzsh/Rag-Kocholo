But the teen somehow remained onboard and travelled on to York University without the other students.\n\nHe was last seen on surveillance video at 2:10 p.m. in the area of Steeles Avenue and Keele Street at York University.\n\nWhen he arrived there, he boarded another bus that took him back to Mississauga, said Campbell.\n\nCampbell said the school board is investigating what happened, and what measures need to be put in place to prevent similar situations from taking place."
