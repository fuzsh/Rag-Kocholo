        "text": "This page is about the city in Canada. For other uses, see Brampton (disambiguation).\n\nBrampton is a city in the Canadian province of Ontario. Brampton is a city in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and is a lower-tier municipality within Peel Region. The city has a population of 656,480 as of the 2021 Census, making it the ninth most populous municipality in Canada and the third most populous city in the Greater Golden Horseshoe urban area, behind Toronto and Mississauga.\n\nIndigenous peoples have inhabited the Brampton area for thousands of years and the city is situated on the traditional territory of the Huron-Wendat, Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabeg. Named after the town of Brampton in Cumberland, England, Brampton was incorporated as a village in 1853 and as a town in 1873, and became a city in 1974. Immigration has greatly increased Brampton's population, from 10,000 in the 1950s to over 600,000 today.\n\nThe city was once known as \"The Flower Town of Canada\", a title referring to its large greenhouse industry. Nowadays, Brampton's major economic sectors include advanced manufacturing, retail administration, logistics, information and communication technologies, food and beverage, life sciences, and business services.\n\nHistory\n\nMain article: History of Brampton\n\nSee also: List of mayors of Brampton, Brampton Fall Fair, and Brampton Library\n\nPrior to the 1800s, all real business in Chinguacousy Township took place at Martin Salisbury's tavern. One mile distant at the corner of Main and Queen streets, now the recognised centre of Brampton, William Buffy's tavern was the only significant building. At the time, the area was referred to as \"Buffy's Corners\". By 1834, John Elliott laid out the area in lots for sale, calling it \"Brampton\", which was soon adopted by others.\n\nIn 1853, a small agricultural fair was set up by the newly initiated County Agricultural Society of the County of Peel, and was held at the corner of Main and Queen streets. Grains, produce, roots, and dairy products were up for sale. Horses and cattle, along with other lesser livestock, were also sold at market. This agricultural fair eventually became the modern Brampton Fall Fair. In that same year Brampton was incorporated as a village.\n\nBy 1869, Brampton, with a population of 1800, was the county town of Peel in the Township of Chinguacousy. It was a Station of the Grand Trunk Railway. The County buildings were erected c. 1869 of freestone and white brick.\n\nA federal grant allowed the village to found its first public library in 1887, which included 360 volumes from the Mechanic's Institute (est 1858). In 1907, the library received a grant from the Carnegie Foundation, set up by United States steel magnate and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, to build a new, expanded library; it serves several purposes, featuring the Brampton Library. The Carnegie libraries were built on the basis of communities coming up with matching funds and guaranteeing maintenance.\n\nA group of regional farmers in Brampton had trouble getting insurance from city-based companies. After several meetings in Clairville Hall, they decided to found the County of Peel Farmers Mutual Fire Insurance Company. In 1955, when the company moved to its third and current location, 103 Queen Street West, it took the new name of Peel Mutual Insurance Company. It reigns as the longest-running company in modern Brampton. Harmsworth Decorating Centre was established in 1890, as Harmsworth and Son, operated out of the family's house on Queen Street West. The current location was purchased on September 1, 1904, after a fire destroyed their original store. Purchased for $1,400, the 24 Main Street South location is the longest-operating retail business in what is now Brampton.\n\nEdward Dale, an immigrant from Dorking, England, established a flower nursery in Brampton shortly after his arrival in 1863. Dale's Nursery became the town's largest and most prominent employer, developed a flower grading system, and established a global export market for its products. The company chimney was a town landmark, until Brampton Town Council allowed it to be torn down in 1977. At its height, the company had 140 greenhouses, and was the largest cut flower business in North America, producing 20 million blooms and introducing numerous rose and orchid varietals and species to the market. It also spurred the development of other nurseries in the town. Forty-eight hothouse flower nurseries once did business in the town.\n\nIn 1974, the two townships of Chinguacousy and Toronto Gore were incorporated into Brampton. The small pine added to the center of the shield on the Brampton city flag represents Chinguacousy, honouring the Chippewa chief Shinguacose, \"The Small Pine.\" After this merger, outlying communities such as Bramalea, Heart Lake and Professor's Lake, Snelgrove, Tullamore, and Mayfield, were developed.\n\nIn 1963, the town established The Flower Festival of Brampton, based on the Rose Festival of Portland, Oregon in the United States. It began to market itself as the Flower Town of Canada.\n\nIn a revival of this theme, on 24 June 2002, the City Council established the \"Flower City Strategy\", to promote a connection to its flower-growing heritage. The intention was to inspire design projects and community landscaping to beautify the city, adopt a sustainable environmental approach, and to protect its natural and cultural heritage. The Rose Theatre was named in keeping with this vision and is to serve as a cultural institution in the city. In addition, the city participates in the national Communities in Bloom competition as part of that strategy.\n\nThe Old Shoe Factory, located on 57 Mill Street North, once housed the Hewetson Shoe Company. It was listed as a historical property under the Ontario Heritage Act in 2008. Today it is occupied by various small businesses. The lobby and hallways retain details from 1907. Walls are decorated with pictures and artifacts of local Brampton history and old shoe making equipment.\n\nA self-guided historical walking tour of downtown Brampton called \"A Walk Through Time\" is available at Brampton City Hall and online free of cost.\n\nDevelopment of Bramalea\n\nMain article: Bramalea, Ontario\n\nDeveloped as an innovative \"new town\", Bramalea was constructed approximately 40 kilometres northwest of Toronto. Located in the former Chinguacousy Township, it was Canada's first satellite community developed by one of the country's largest real estate developers, Bramalea Limited. The name \"Bramalea\" was created by the farmer William Sheard, who combined \"BRAM\" from Brampton, \"MAL\" from Malton (then a neighbouring town which is now part of the city of Mississauga), and \"LEA\", an Old English word meaning meadow or grassland. He sold the land to Brampton Leasing (the former name of the developer) and built one of Bramalea's first houses on Dixie Road.\n\nThe community was developed according to its detailed master plan, which included provisions for a parkland trail system and a \"downtown\" to include essential services and a shopping centre. The downtown's centrepiece was the Civic Centre, built in 1972 to include the city hall and library. Directly across Team Canada Drive, a shopping centre named Bramalea City Centre was built. These developments were connected by a long underground tunnel, planned to provide protection from winter weather. But, the tunnel has long since been closed due to safety issues. Urbanists have also found that pedestrians at street level make for much livelier and safer streets. Other features included a police station, fire hall, bus terminal, and a collection of seniors' retirement homes.\n\nEach phase of the new city was marked with progressing first letters of street names. Development started with the \"A\" section, with street names such as Argyle, Avondale, and Aloma. Developers then created a \"B\" section, \"C\" section, and so forth. Children on the boundaries of these divisions would regularly compete in street hockey games, pitting, for example, the \"D\" section versus the \"E\" section.\n\nThe community was initially developed with a large number of recreational facilities, including tennis courts, playgrounds, hockey/lacrosse rinks and swimming pools. An extensive parkland trail and sidewalk system connects the entire community.\n\nRegion of Peel\n\nIn 1974, the Ontario provincial government decided to update Peel County's structure. It amalgamated a series of villages into the City of Mississauga. In addition, it created the new City of Brampton from the greater portion of the Townships of Chinguacousy and Toronto Gore, including Bramalea and the other communities such as Claireville, Ebenezer, Victoria, Springbrook, Churchville, Coleraine, and Huttonville. While only Huttonville and Churchville still exist as identifiable communities, other names like Claireville are re-emerging as names of new developments.\n\nThe province converted Peel County into the Regional Municipality of Peel. Brampton retained its role as the administrative centre of Peel Region, which it already had as county seat. The regional council chamber, the Peel Regional Police force, the public health department, and the region's only major museum, the Peel Art Gallery, Museum and Archives, are all located in Brampton.\n\nThis change had its critics among those with a strong sense of local identities. Bramptonians feared urban sprawl would dissolve their town's personality. Bramalea residents took pride in the built-from-scratch and organised structure that had come with their new city and did not want to give it up. Others in Bramalea accept they are part of Brampton, and they make up the tri-city area: Brampton, Heart Lake, Bramalea.\n\nIn 1972, Bramalea had built its civic centre. Two years later, when Brampton and Bramalea merged, the new city's council chambers and other facilities were installed in the Bramalea building. They were moved from Brampton's modest downtown locale. The library systems of Brampton and Bramalea were joined, resulting in a system of four locations.\n\nSome have questioned the future of Peel Region as encompassing all of Brampton, Mississauga, and Caledon. The Mississauga council, led by Mayor Hazel McCallion, voted to become a single-tier municipality and asked the provincial government to be separated from Peel Region. They argued the city has outgrown the need for a regional layer of government, and that Mississauga is being held back by supporting Brampton and Caledon with its municipal taxes.\n\nDevelopment as a city\n\nThe early 1980s brought new residential development, as Brampton released large tracts of land to developers. In 1995 the large new suburban community of Springdale was developed, contributing to what people consider urban sprawl. This area had its largest boom in 1999, when development started to appear as far north as the city's border with Caledon. The region has designated this border as the line of demarcation for urban development until 2021. Neighbouring communities not part of Peel Region have also been dramatically affected by the city's sudden spurt. The end of Brampton and start of Georgetown, for example, has no identifiable boundary.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Cineplex Odeon closed the Capitol Theatre in Brampton. The City bought the facility in 1981 under the leadership of councillor Diane Sutter. It adapted the former vaudeville venue and movie house as a performing arts theatre, to be used also as a live music venue. It was renamed the Heritage Theatre. Renovations and maintenance were expensive. In 1983, Toronto consultants Woods Gordon reported to the City that, rather than continue \"pouring money\" into the Heritage, they should construct a new 750-seat facility with up-to-date features. This recommendation was adopted, and the city designated the 2005/06 as the Heritage Theatre's \"grand finale\" season. The city funded construction of the new Rose Theatre, which opened in September 2006.\n\nCarabram was founded in 1984, the result of volunteers from different ethnic communities wanting to organise a festival celebrating diversity and cross-cultural friendship. The name was loosely related to Toronto's Caravan Festival of Cultures. Carabram's first event featured Italian, Scots, Ukrainian, and West Indian pavilions. By 2003, the fair had 18 pavilions attracting 45,000 visitors. The national government of Canada had an anchor pavilion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and for Carabram's 25th Anniversary in 2009.\n\nResponding to a growing multi-cultural population, the Peel Board of Education introduced evening English as a Second Language (ESL) classes at high schools. Originally taught by volunteers, the classes eventually were scheduled as daytime courses taught by paid instructors. In the 1980s, the public and Catholic board expanded its languages programs, offering night classes in 23 languages. These were introduced due to requests by parents, who wanted their children to learn their ancestral languages and heritage. Brampton has a very large South Asian population, which is expected to grow at a high rate.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Mayor Ken Whillans gained approval and funding for construction of a new city hall in Brampton's downtown. The facility was designed by local architects and constructed by Inzola Construction. Whillians did not get to see the opening of the new hall because of his death in August of that same year. With the return of city government to downtown Brampton, politicians and businesses allied to revitalize the core.\n\nChanges continue to reflect the growth of the city. In 1992 the City purchased the Brampton Fair Grounds, to be used for other development. The Agricultural Society relocated in 1997 outside the boundaries of the city to Heart Lake and Old School roads. In 1997 the Health Services Restructuring Commission (HSRC) decided to amalgamate Georgetown and District Memorial Hospital, Etobicoke General Hospital, and Peel Memorial Hospital as the William Osler Health Centre. It became what is now the province's 6th-largest hospital corporation.\n\nBrampton's 2003 Sesquicentennial celebrations boosted community spirit, reviving the tradition of a summer parade (with 100 floats), and creating other initiatives. To commemorate the town's history, the city under Mayor Fennell reintroduced floral projects to the community. These have included more plantings around town, the revival in 2005 of the city Parade, and participation in the Canada Communities in Bloom project.\n\nCurrent events\n\nSet to open in 2017, The New Peel Memorial Centre for Integrated Health and Wellness will provide Health and Wellness services to the community. Some of these services include Senior Services, Day-surgery services, Mental Health Services, and Diabetes Services.\n\nErin Oaks Kids Center for Treatment and Development's 121,000 SQ FT campus is set to open in 2017. The new Brampton facility will serve children with disabilities and their families.\n\nIn 2015, the province announced funding for the Hurontario Light Rail Transit project along Hurontario Street from Port Credit in Missisauga to Steeles Avenue in Brampton. This is a 1.6 Billion Dollar Investment. Construction expected to start in 2018.\n\nIn 2015, the new City Hall Expansion (West Tower) was completed. Its purpose was to meet the needs and demands of new and future administration space for the city. It is connected to old city hall by the pedestrian bridge over George Street.\n\nIn 2014, the province announced a massive expansion and redevelopment project to the existing highway #410 in Brampton. The project includes widening the highway, resurfacing the highway, new overhead signs, lighting, medians, an HOV lane, new guardrails, landscaping and ponds.\n\n2010-2014 saw the creation and expansion of the ZUM transit system. ZUM services connect Brampton residents within major destinations in the City, as well as outside the city with Routes heading to employment corridors in Woodbridge, York University (Toronto), Humber College (Toronto), and Square One (Mississauga). ZUM is expected to further expand into 2016 and 2017.\n\nIn 2010, The Bramalea City Center underwent a massive expansion, renovation, and new higher end retail. This was a $165,000,000 investment.\n\nIn September 2007, the new Rose Theatre opened its doors in downtown Brampton. By 2008, the facility had attracted over 137,000 patrons, surpassing its five-year goal in its first season. As hoped, the theatre has been a catalyst for downtown revitalization. Since its opening, new businesses have opened, established businesses have renovated their storefronts, and several high-rise residential condominium projects are either under construction or in the planning phases. In December 2007, the Toronto Star published an article entitled, \"Brampton comes alive,\" which documents the latest in the city's revitalisation plans and progress.\n\nIn May 2012, the Brampton City Council voted unanimously in favour of a secondary bid as a hosting city for the 2015 Pan Am Games being held in Toronto. The initial plan had the City of Brampton as one of the hosting venues for the summer games. But, following a venue plan change, it appeared that was not likely. Ian Troop, the CEO of the organisation committee, said that changes needed to be made as \"the benefits of clustering are that you create economies of scale, the goal for our refined and improved venue plan is to reduce the operational complexities of the event, save costs, deliver an athlete-centred Games that facilitates great performance and create a much richer spectator experience.\"\n\nGeography and climate\n\nBrampton has a total land area of 265 square kilometres (102 sq mi). The City of Brampton is bordered by Highway 50 (Vaughan) to the East, Winston Churchill Boulevard (Halton Hills) to the West, Mayfield Road (Caledon) to the north (except for a small neighbourhood, Snelgrove, which is part of Brampton despite extending somewhat north of Mayfield Road) and the hydro corridor (Mississauga) to the south except at Finch Avenue (at this point, Finch Avenue serves as the border between the two cities).\n\nBrampton features a continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) which is typical to much of Peel Region and the rest of the Greater Toronto Area.\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical populations Year Pop. ±% 1858 50 — 1871 2,090 +4080.0% 1881 2,920 +39.7% 1891 3,252 +11.4% 1901 2,748 −15.5% 1911 3,412 +24.2% 1921 4,527 +32.7% 1931 5,532 +22.2% 1941 5,975 +8.0% 1951 8,389 +40.4% 1961 18,467 +120.1% 1971 41,211 +123.2% 1981 149,030 +261.6% 1991 234,445 +57.3% 1996 268,251 +14.4% 2001 325,428 +21.3% 2006 433,806 +33.3% 2011 523,906 +20.8% 2016 593,638 +13.3% 2021 656,480 +10.6% Brampton annexed Chinguacousy—which included the highly populated community of Bramalea—and Toronto Gore Townships in 1974.\n\nThe 2011 population count was revised in 2016.\n\nIn the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Brampton had a population of 656,480 living in 182,472 of its 189,086 total private dwellings, a change of 10.6% from its 2016 population of 593,638.

At its growth rate of 10.6% since the 2016 census, Brampton was the fast-growing of Canada's largest 25 municipalities.\n\nBrampton is among the most diverse cities in the country. As of the 2016 Census, the largest ethnocultural background in Brampton is South Asian, accounting for 44.3% of the population. Other backgrounds include European (26%), Black (13.9%), Filipino (3.4%), Latin American (2.4%), East Asian (1.7%), Southeast Asian (1.4%), Arab (1%), and West Asian (0.9%).\n\nThe largest religion in Brampton is Christianity (50.5%).

Other religions with a notable presence include Sikhism (18.8%), Hinduism (12.1%), and Islam (7.1%). Proportionally, Brampton has one of the largest Sikh and Hindu populations among all Canadian cities. Buddhists make up 1.3% of the population. Nearly 10% of the population does not identify with a particular religion.
