With that, let’s take a look at 10 people with humble beginnings in this lovely city:\n\nMichael Cera\n\nREAL NAME: Michael Austin Cera\n\nAGE: 29\n\nHIGH SCHOOL: Heart Lake Secondary School\n\nKnow for his quirky whims, and awkward comedic delivery, Michael Cera is an actor that we know from beloved movies including Superbad, Juno, and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Many of us remember the Brampton native in Arrested Development, too, and since then has become a rising star.\n\n2. Russell Peters\n\nREAL NAME: Russell Dominic Peters\n\nAGE: 46\n\nHIGH SCHOOL: Chinguacousy Secondary School/ Judith Nyman Secondary School\n\nWe all know him for his comedic genius and iconic phrases, including “Somebody gonna get a hurt real bad!” Russell Peters is an Indian Canadian comedian who was raised in Brampton, and doesn’t shy away from letting the world know about his upbringing in this city by paying homage in his work.\n\n3. Roy Woods\n\nREAL NAME: Denzel Spencer\n\nAGE: 21\n\nHIGH SCHOOL: Turner Fenton S.S.\n\nSigned to Drake’s label OVO Sound, Roy Woods has been making a name for himself in the music industry with hits like “Gwan Big Up Urself” and “Get You Good”.

Alessia Cara\n\nREAL NAME: Alessia Caracciolo\n\nAGE: 21\n\nHIGH SCHOOL: Cardinal Ambrozic Catholic S.S.\n\nAt only 21 Alessia Cara is already one of the world’s top pop artists. Starting out on Youtube, Cara’s debut single “Here” garnered major attention in 2016. Since then she’s captured the attention of Def Jam Records and the rest of the world: she dropped a successful debut album, toured with Coldplay, opened up award shows, and recently won two MTV Video Music Awards.\n\n5. Tory Lanez\n\nREAL NAME: Daystar Peterson\n\nAGE: 25\n\nHIGH SCHOOL: Fletcher’s Meadow S.S.\n\nTory Lanez is another musician who grew up in Brampton and began rapping at the age of 9, performing at 16 and releasing mixtapes as early as 2009.

Not to mention, he has collaborated with some artists including Meek Mill and YG.\n\n6. Shawn Ashmore\n\nREAL NAME: Shawn Robert Ashmore\n\nAGE: 37\n\nHIGH SCHOOL: Turner Fenton S.S.\n\nProbably most recognized for his roles in the X-Men movie franchise and the Smallville TV series, Shawn Ashmore grew up in Brampton, with his twin brother and fellow actor Aaron Ashmore.

While he didn’t attend high school in Brampton, he is nonetheless a person worth noting. He was drafted into the OHL in 2008, then was the second overall draft pick of the Boston Bruins, and soon after won the Stanley Cup in 2011.\n\n9.

There’s plenty more that we’ve probably missed, but it is clear that this city is a hotbed for success!"
