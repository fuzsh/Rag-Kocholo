It employs roughly 5,000 teachers; about 3,000 at the elementary level, and the remaining 2,000 at the secondary school and continuing education level.[citation needed]\n\nIts headquarters is on Matheson Boulevard West in Mississauga.[5] The board was previously known as the Dufferin-Peel Separate School Board (DPSSB) before 1998.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board is the successor to the Dufferin-Peel Separate School Board (French: Conseil des écoles séparées catholiques de Dufferin & Peel), which was established in 1969 by the merger of eight small separate boards.\n\nAs of 1986 the Dufferin-Peel Separate School Board was Ontario's second largest Catholic school board.[6] On January 1, 1998, the DPSSB was renamed to DPCDSB and its French schools within the board became part of the Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud.\n\nBy 1999 the district had a co-operative transportation service with the Peel District School Board. During that year its school operation costs were $4.65 ($7.86 when adjusted for inflation) per square foot. The funding guidelines by a ministry[clarification needed] were $5.20 ($8.79 when adjusted for inflation).[7]\n\nAround the time of the DPSSB's existence, the board operated six francophone schools.\n\nSchool bus transportation\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to local transit systems Brampton Transit and MiWay (Mississauga Transit) there are a number of transportation providers under contract for the DPCDSB:[8]\n\nAttridge Transportation\n\nCook Bus Lines\n\nDenny Bus Lines\n\nFirst Student Canada\n\nParkview Transit\n\nSwitzer-Carty Transportation\n\nSchools\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 1999, there is one dual DPCDSB-Peel District School Board Catholic-secular public school.[7]\n\nContinuing Education\n\n[edit]\n\nBlessed Trinity Catholic Centre For Learning\n\nBrian J.

Critics argue that the practice of fully funding separate schools exclusively for the Roman Catholic faith is discriminatory to other religions (the United Nations has twice criticized the province for this policy)[citation needed]. Supporters of the current Catholic education system point out that it has existed, in one form or another, since Confederation, and that the Constitution Act, 1867 enshrines the right to government-funded religious education to all Catholics. The opposition argues that this is an appeal to tradition, and point to other provinces in Canada which amended the constitution to abolish Catholic school funding. It is up to the school principal whether or not non-Catholics are enrolled.[9]\n\n“Black Boys” book\n\n[edit]\n\nThe board encountered controversy in 2019 when a book, titled The Guide for White Women Who Teach Black Boys, was shown on the principal's desk. This sparked various online debates on the internet. The book, written by American researchers and published in 2017, provides help and advice for teachers to create learning environments in which black students feel nurtured and engaged.[10]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nOntario portal\n\nCatholicism portal\n\nSchools portal\n\nPeel District School Board\n\nUpper Grand District School Board\n\nList of school districts in Ontario\n\nList of high schools in Ontario\n\nArchdiocese of Toronto\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
