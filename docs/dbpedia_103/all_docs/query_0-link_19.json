Also provided below is a general update on the status of Provincial negotiations.\n\nCUPE\n\nCentral bargaining has been taking place at the provincial level between the Ontario Catholic School Trustee Association (OCSTA), which represents Catholic school boards, the Ministry of Education, and various bargaining units, including the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), which represents a number of work groups at the Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board.\n\nTentative Agreement Reached with CUPE\n\nOn November 2, The Council of Trustees Association, CUPE and the Provincial Government reached a tentative agreement on the central terms of the collective agreement. Having signed this tentative Memorandum of Settlement, CUPE has agreed to suspend central job action.\n\nThe details of this tentative agreement and the ratification process have not yet been released to boards.\n\nIn terms of returning to regular duties for CUPE staff, we recognize this will occur over a few days within the regular work period.\n\nPlease note that the following work groups are part of the CUPE bargaining units in Dufferin-Peel:\n\n1. Custodial/Maintenance\n\n2. Clerical\n\n3. ICT\n\n4. Library Workers (Technicians)\n\nOECTA\n\nOn August 25, a tentative agreement was reached with the province, OECTA and the Ontario Catholic School Trustees Association (OCSTA), which represents Catholic school boards at the provincial table.\n\nAll Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board teachers (Elementary, Secondary and Occasional) are represented by The Ontario English Catholic Teachers Association (OECTA).\n\nNext steps include the ratification process.\n\nCentral negotiations continue with non-teaching union groups representing other educational workers.\n\nPlease check the following sources for updated information.\n\nDPCDSB Website: www.dpcdsb.org\n\nTwitter @DPCDSBSchools\n\nTelephone Information line for a recorded message - 905-366-5770\n\nGeneral Information about Collective Bargaining, Agreements and Negotiations\n\nThe collective agreement is a written contract of employment covering a group of employees who are represented by a teacher federation/trade union. The agreement contains provisions governing the terms and conditions of employment. It also contains the rights, privileges and duties of the employer, the teacher federation/trade union and the employees.\n\nCollective bargaining is a process in which a teacher federation/trade union and an employer negotiate a first collective agreement or the renewal of a previous collective agreement. The School Boards Collective Bargaining Act has now created a two-tiered bargaining process where certain items are negotiated centrally and other items are negotiated locally.\n\nIf during the central or local negotiation process, the employer and the union do not agree on the terms of the agreement either party may ask the Ontario Minister of Labour to appoint a conciliation officer. Under the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act the conciliation process applies separately for central and local negotiations.\n\nConciliation is a legally required step prior to job action.\n\nIf following conciliation, a collective agreement is still not achieved, the conciliator reports to the Minister of Labour that parties were unable to reach an agreement.\n\nThe Minister then issues a notice informing the union and the employer that he or she “does not consider it advisable to appoint a conciliation board.” This notice is known as the “no board” report.\n\nIssuance of a no-board report commences the statutory timeline to the parties being in a legal position to enact job action. Job action may legally begin on the 17th day after the issuance of the no-board report.\n\nUnder the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act, notice of job action must be provided at least 5 days prior to the commencement of job action. This 5-day notice can be provided within the statutory time period related to the no-board report.\n\nUnder the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act, OCSTA is the bargaining agent representing the interests of Catholic school boards at the central negotiation table.\n\nLinks to Resources for More Information:\n\nMinistry of Education - Labour Disruptions FAQs\n\nMinistry of Labour\n\nOntario Labour Relations Board\n\n↧\n\nNight School\n\nThe Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board offers evening credit courses under the Ontario Secondary School curriculum guidelines.

The online reporting tool is now available board-wide.\n\nBully Prevention and Awareness Faith Resource Package: A resource package containing prayers, reflections and a liturgy has been distributed to our Dufferin-Peel schools. This will aid in increasing bullying awareness with a focus on creating a Catholic community of culture and caring.\n\nPoster Campaign: A series of posters created by Dufferin-Peel students is being distributed to all schools. Each poster incorporates the header, “Stand Up! Against Bullying”, as well as, “Let us allow God to fill our hearts with his goodness and mercy.” (Pope Francis).

EQAO also makes recommendations for improvement which educators, parents, policy makers and others in the education community use to improve learning and teaching.\n\nThe EQAO assessments are based on the expectations outlined in The Ontario Curriculum. These assessments provide quality information on the achievement of students and add to the classroom assessment information teachers gather about individual students during the school year.\n\nFor more information about the EQAO Assessments, visit http://www.eqao.com/\n\nUsing the Results\n\nThe EQAO assessment results should not be used to rank schools. Instead, the results should be used to improve teaching and learning. Ranking schools provides no information about why scores are high or low, and can lead to simple and possibly misleading comparisons that ignore the particular circumstances affecting achievement in each school. Ranking also distracts from addressing the more important issues of how to improve learning for all students.\n\nEQAO Parent Resources\n\nParent Homepage\n\nPrimary and Junior Reading, Writing, and Mathematics Assessments\n\nGrade 9 Mathematics Assessment\n\nGrade 10 OSSLT\n\nBoard Reports\n\n2014-15 EQAO Elementary - School Board Report\n\n2014-15 Board Grade 9 Math EQAO - School Board Report\n\n2014-15 Board OSSLT - School Board Report\n\n↧\n\nPrimary Junior Results\n\nThe Primary Assessments of Reading, Writing and Mathematics are conducted each year by EQAO at the end of Grade 3. These assessments measure student achievement of the provincial curriculum expectations in reading, writing and mathematics to the end of the primary division (Grades 1, 2 and 3).\n\nThe Junior Assessments of Reading, Writing and Mathematics are conducted annually by EQAO at the end of Grade 6. These assessments measure student achievement of the provincial curriculum expectations in reading, writing and mathematics to the end of the junior division (Grades 4, 5 and 6).\n\nThe primary and junior assessments test what students know and how well they apply their knowledge and skills in everyday situations, by requiring students:\n\nto read and respond to passages\n\nto write\n\nto solve mathematical problems\n\nStudent work on the assessments is evaluated according to the expectations in The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 1-8. A four-level assessment scale that reflects the four achievement levels in The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 1-8 is used to evaluate each student’s work. These four levels are:\n\nLevel 4: Achievement exceeds the provincial standard.\n\nLevel 3: The provincial standard. This score identifies a high level of achievement of the provincial expectations.\n\nLevel 2: Achievement that is approaching the provincial standard.\n\nLevel 1: Achievement that falls below the provincial standard.\n\nBoard Results\n\nResults from the spring 2015 administration of the EQAO primary division and junior division assessments of reading, writing and mathematics demonstrated that high proportions of Dufferin-Peel students continue to meet or surpass the provincial standard in Grades 3 and 6. Students attending Dufferin-Peel Catholic schools have demonstrated consistently high performance in EQAO reading and writing in both Grades 3 and 6 over the last five years. The board continues to dedicate a wide range of supports to schools to focus on improving learning in mathematics, as well as other subject areas, for all students.\n\nSchool Results\n\nBelow are the 2014-15 primary and junior EQAO reports for elementary schools, categorized by family of schools.\n\n↧"
