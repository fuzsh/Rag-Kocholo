        "text": "Nicholas Fiore - BIO\n\n\"Broadcast Voice of the Oakville Blades\"\n\nPlay by Play Broadcaster & Social Media Contributor\n\n​\n\nI grew up a resident of Brampton my entire life.\n\nI have a high school diploma from Cardinal Ambrozic Catholic Secondary School and also two college diplomas from Humber College in the Media Foundations and Radio-Broadcasting Programs.\n\nI played rep competitive soccer since I was 4 years old and also played rep ball hockey.\n\nI was on the Vaughn Top Guns Provincial Team for ball hockey and I was an soccer Goalkeeper for Aurora FC and Pro Stars FC in League 1 Ontario, a Semi-Professional Soccer League. I also Broadcasted in the same Semi- Professional League as a Soccer Commentator.\n\nI started broadcasting with the Canadian Soccer League, along with being a newscaster and reporter on 96.9FM Radio Humber. I also started my hockey broadcasting career 6 years ago, where I gained two years of experience with the Brampton Bombers in the GOJHL and now I currently am the \"Voice of the Oakville Blades\" as their Play by Play Broadcaster in the OJHL, entering my 4th year with the Blades.\n\nI have broadcasted hockey for 6 years now and I have earned a Buckland Cup and Dudley-Hewitt Cup championship as a broadcaster to my name after the Oakville Blades won the Ontario Junior Hockey League and the Central-Canadian tournament in Cochrane, Ontario in the 2018/2019 season. I then travelled with the Blades to Brooks, Alberta where the team competed in the National Junior A Championships, finishing third place overall, bowing out at the semifinal game, as I was apart of the best season ever in the Oakville Blades franchise history.\n\nI have created my own “NEW Sports Talk Show”, called: MAMMA MIA THIS IS FIRE TALK.\n\nWhich is mainly viewed on YouTube with Episode releases there and on audio platforms which include: Spoitfy and Apple Podcasts. As well as social media activity on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok.\n\n⁃ A little inside scoop, my most well known GOAL catchphrase is belting out: MAMMA MIA!"
