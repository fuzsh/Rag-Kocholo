Bishop Maurice E. Piat of Port-Louis, the priests of the diocese of Port-Louis, and the family of Cardinal Margéot, will meet in the cathedral at 10:30 a.m. for a prayer before the coffin leaves the church.

From there, the procession will go by bus until the corner of Desroches and Monseigneur Leen streets, to finish the way by foot. The coffin will be carried in procession and will be deposited in front of the crypt.\n\nThe funeral mass at Monument Marie-Reine-de-la-Paix\n\nThe public wishing to pay a last homage to the Cardinal Margéot is advised to go directly to Monument Marie-Reine-de-la-Paix to attend the funeral mass. Father Jocelyn Gregoire will conduct a time of prayer between 11:00 and 12:00 to help the public to collect itself. The mass of the funeral will begin at noon, in the presence of high dignitaries of the State of Mauritus. Bishop Piat will concelebrate the mass with Archbishop Augustine Kassuja, apostolic nuncio; Bishop Gilbert Aubry of Saint-Denis, La Réunion; Archbishop Odon Marie Arsè Razanakolona of Antananarivo, Madagascar; Bishop Denis Wiehe of Seychelles; and Mgr. Alain Harel, apostolic vicar of Rodrigues and cousin of the late cardinal; and the priests of the diocese.
