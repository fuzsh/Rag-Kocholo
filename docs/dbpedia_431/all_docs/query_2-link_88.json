        "text": "DALLAS, Feb. 13, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Neiman Marcus announced the launch of a Lela Rose tabletop collection available exclusively at NeimanMarcus.com, marking the fashion designer's first collaboration in the home category.\n\nIn partnership with Neiman Marcus, Rose created a special tabletop collection that includes a white lace and linen napkin and placemat set ($100) as well as a set of four assorted dessert plates ($135). Each dessert plate in the set features a unique design inspired by master chef Ferran Adrià's complex approach to food.\n\n\"We are proud to be partnering with Lela Rose on this collection,\" said Gerald Barnes, Chief Merchant, Neiman Marcus Direct. \"Neiman Marcus has always felt that art enhances the quality of people's lives and so it seemed natural that we would collaborate with Lela on this collection.\"\n\n\"Entertaining is woven into my lifestyle, so creating a tabletop collection is a natural extension,\" said Lela Rose, designer. \"I am inspired by Adrià's artistic approach to food; each piece I designed reflects the energy and creativity in his masterpieces. This collaboration allowed me to apply my design philosophy of mixing color and texture to tabletop for the first time.\"\n\nAbout Lela Rose\n\nLela Rose was raised in Texas and went to school in Colorado where nature, its surrounding landscapes, and the sublime colors it offers have long been an inspiration. Today, Lela continues to draw from these early influences as she designs clothes for the modern sophisticated woman who embodies a spirit of effortless elegance.\n\nAfter graduating from Parson's School of Design in 1993, she went to work with two esteemed designers, Richard Tyler and Christian Francis Roth. There she honed her love of couture fabric as well as fanatic attention to detail. In 1998, Lela's vision and passion compelled her to create her signature collection, Lela Rose.\n\nThe brand is built on an entertaining lifestyle aesthetic and a design philosophy of creating hand finished clothes that exude a casual luxury and refinement. By adding whimsy to elegance through brilliant color and handcrafted details, Rose has brought a fresh point of view to modern American fashion.\n\nFor additional information please visit, www.lelarose.com.\n\nAbout Neiman Marcus Group\n\nNeiman Marcus Group LTD Inc. operations include the Specialty Retail Stores segment and the Online segment.
