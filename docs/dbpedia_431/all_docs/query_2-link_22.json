In February 2011, Marcus was inspired to explore his love for teaching, and reached out to the Claiborne Fundamental Magnet School in his hometown of Shreveport, LA. He gave three 45-minute presentations, titled “Music is the Universal Language, the students at Claiborne.\n\n“A main goal of mine was to influence the kids to continue in their musical endeavors until they’ve surpassed the end, but the primary theme was helping kids realize that music speaks a beautiful language to us every single day.”"
