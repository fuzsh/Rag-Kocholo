        "text": "This article examine Rose’s claim in Hegel Contra Sociology that Hegel’s philosophy, properly understood, is able to provide a better way to do sociology. It understands this claim as one of method and metatheory: by better appreciating the logic of sociology and the social nature of logic, and the relationship between theory and metatheory, social theory may be less prone to make certain errors. Rose found in Hegel’s logic and phenomenology the way to such understanding. By pushing Rose’s work in a direction she did not explicitly take it, this article shows how it nevertheless addresses some central debates in sociological theory. It finds that her version of Hegelian conceptual knowing can speak to and cope with issues of logic and the sociology of knowledge, the repeated recurrence of contradictions and antinomies in sociology, and issues of emergence and the social totality. It finds a possible source of the repeated recurrence of positivism in sociology suggested by Rose’s critique of neo-Kantianism: faulty methodological self-understanding. Rose’s work on social theory can then be seen as in part offering a better account of what good sociology already does. While in no way imagining that this approach does justice to the whole of Rose’s thought, it shows her fiercely theoretical work is effective not only in philosophy but also in sociology, which is consistent with her dismay at their disciplinary separation. NB Telos owns the copyright.\n\nGillian Rose’s magnum opus was her second book, Hegel Contra Sociology (1981). Preceding this was The Melancholy Science: An Introduction to the Thought of Theodor W. Adorno (1978), a work which charted Rose’s approach to the relation of Marxism to Hegel. Hegel provided Rose with the standard for critical thinking on social modernity, whose threshold she found nearly all others to fall below, including thinkers she otherwise respected such as Adorno and Marx. Rose read Marx as an important disciple of Hegel who misapprehended key aspects of Hegel’s thought. According to Rose, this left Marxism at the mercy of prevailing Kantian preoccupations such as the dichotomy of \"theory and practice,\" etc. Rose’s misunderstanding of Marxism limits the direction and reach of the rousing call for a \"critical Marxism\" with which she concluded her book. Rose failed to note how Lukács and Adorno deeply internalized the Hegelian problematic of Marxism, how Marxism was not the (mis)application but the reconstruction of the Hegelian dialectic under the changed social-historical conditions of capital. But Rose’s perspective remains that of Hegel -- pre-industrial capital.\n\nThis article explores the conviction that the durability of communities is contingent, at least in part, on the conception of reason in play. It proposes that prospects for building and sustaining community are enhanced to the degree that rationalistic theories of rationality are rejected. The resulting equivocation in the processes of rule-making, moral thinking, analysis, and critique, while problematic, will be preferable to the alternative and caricatured approaches premised on a strong division between reason and its so-called others. This desirable equivocation involves an analysis of the role of trust in human relations and a revised conception of reason developed by philosopher and social critic Gillian Rose (1947-1995). Through an analysis of Rose's commentary on the folk legend of Camelot and the phenomenology of friendship, this article tries to show how relations constrained by alterity can be transformed. So from the back of her shrine the Sybil of Cumae Chanted fearful equivocal words and made the cave echo With sayings where clear truths and mysteries Were inextricably twined. Apllo turned and twisted His spurs at her breast, gave her her head, then reined in her spasms. S e a m u s Heaneyl This essay proposes that prospects for building community are diminished to the degree (1) t h a t reason is conceived of as instrumental, technical, pure, and objective; and (2) that law Robin Lathangue is assistant professor of contemporary studies, religion and culture at Wilfrid Laurier University in Brantford, Ontario. He is the author of numerous articles and book reviews on public intellectuals, political philosophy and theology. His current research is on romantic conceptions of reason, ethics and cosmopolitanism, and radical orthodoxy.\n\nIn this article I wish to present what I consider to be Genevieve Vaughan's best contributions to the writings on the gift. I also consider their relevance to material feminist/ecofeminist and psychoanalytic theories in full recognition of their applicability across a much greater range of academic disciplines. Since we are now grappling with the Covid-l9 pandemic, and its gender impact, I situate my thoughts in this particular context of patriarchal pathology. I explore how Genevieve’s theories and activisms could be applied to help us deal with and get out of these recurrent crises of capitalistic patriarchy. Most importantly, politicians and laypeople should consider what this theory has the potential to change in the post-coronial world of “business as usual”—after all, life will not return to “normal” after the Corona crises. I also provide some examples from my own research to show how revolutionary Genevieve’s ideas are in terms of changing how we perceive cognition, life, reality and the very roots of language, knowledge and the construction of gender identity."
