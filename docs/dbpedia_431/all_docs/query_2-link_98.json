        "text": "For a second straight year, St. Louis Battlehawks LB Mike Rose is headed to the NFL. Rose was a standout defender for the Battlehawks yet again, which has led to him signing a contract with the New Orleans Saints.\n\nRose spent the 2023 XFL season with St. Louis, but didn’t get to play in every game due to injuries. Still, he went to the NFL after the year was over, spending some time with the Miami Dolphins.\n\nAfter returning to the Battlehawks, Rose was crucial to the success of Donnie Abraham’s defense in the. He started in all eight games he played in, totaling 45 tackles, two interceptions, and two TFL’s. Mike was one of the top graded defensive players in the entire UFL, with a 90.6 Defensive Grade via PFF.\n\nIn addition to his quality playmaking, Mike Rose is one of the smartest players in the league. Both Anthony Becht and Abraham spoke very highly of Mike throughout the season, given his leadership on and off the field.\n\nUnfortunately, injuries would get the best of Rose in the playoffs. He played just seven snaps before exiting the XFL Conference Championship game, and would not return to the matchup.\n\nDespite this, a healthy Mike Rose impressed New Orleans after his workout today, and now heads back to the NFL. At 24 years old, Rose has plenty left to give at the professional level.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWithout the national platform that the UFL provided Mike Rose with, who knows if this opportunity would have been possible. You can stay up to date with all UFL to NFL signings with our official tracker."
