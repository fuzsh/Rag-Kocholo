        "text": "Disruptive industry leader becomes Principal, will help grow firm's urban property-redevelopment service line across North Carolina\n\nRALEIGH, NC, April 8, 2019 /PRNewswire/ - John Linderman, Avison Young Principal and Managing Director of the company's North Carolina region, announced today that highly regarded urban property specialist Marcus Jackson has joined the firm in Raleigh-Durham.\n\nEffective immediately, Jackson becomes a Principal of Avison Young. As a member of the U.S. capital markets group, he will grow the company's property-redevelopment service line across North Carolina. Jackson brings more than 25 years of commercial real estate industry experience to Avison Young, most recently as managing director of Trademark Properties in Raleigh-Durham.\n\n\"We are excited to have such a disruptive industry leader and real estate visionary as Marcus join our team in Raleigh-Durham,\" comments Linderman. \"Marcus will work with Avison Young Principal and land practice leader Tara Kreider to identify and secure strategic development and redevelopment opportunities across all asset classes, including land, in and around the urban markets of North Carolina.\"\n\nLinderman continues: \"Marcus has established himself as an urban-redevelopment opportunity specialist. He will continue to serve an existing list of clients and work with new clients as identified here at Avison Young. He will deploy his rising brand to seize opportunity from property owners' and users' continued flight to walkable communities, especially downtowns. He will combine his intense locational knowledge with our product specialists to help drive business growth for our clients and our company.\"\n\nDuring his career, Jackson has helped negotiate more than $400 million worth of investment real estate sales transactions while being held accountable for the successful development of more than 2 million square feet of space. For much of his career, he has been immersed in mixed-use and urban assets, primarily in Atlanta, South Florida, Richmond, VA; Washington DC and the Triangle and Triad regions of North Carolina. Jackson focuses exclusively on urban investment services including brokerage, capital markets solutions, asset repositioning and development advisory.\n\nPast and current clients include: Progress Energy (Duke Power), Woodfield Partners, William Peace University, Queens University, Greymont Development, Atlantic Pacific Companies, AXA Equitable, LNR Properties (now Starwood) and numerous small-to-medium-sized operating businesses and families who in the past acquired urban industrial sites and urban office buildings and subsequently sold or repositioned their real estate assets for significant gains.\n\nPrior to joining Trademark, Jackson held managing director and senior vice-president positions with Colliers International, Jackson Stoddard Associates, Carter, Highwood Properties and Lend Lease in Raleigh-Durham and Atlanta while also serving clients in other urban markets.\n\n\"I'm ecstatic about joining Avison Young and having the opportunity to work with the capital markets team,\" says Jackson. \"Avison Young's key personnel in the Triangle were the initial drivers for me. Tara Kreider and I had partnered together extensively in the past. We enjoyed working together and closing deals for our firm and clients. I have known John Linderman for 20 years and regard him as a highly ethical and proven leader in North Carolina. After also being also attracted to Avison Young's global depth and its disruptive challenger role in the industry, I knew the decision to join the company would be a simple one for me.\"\n\nJackson is active in the industry as a member of the Urban Land Institute's Triangle District Council. In the community, he is Chair Emeritus of Artspace Raleigh as well as a member of the group's building committee. He is also a member of Downtown Durham Inc., the Downtown Raleigh Alliance and Downtown Greensboro Inc., which promote economic development; the Brewers Association and the North Carolina Brewers Guild. He holds a Master of Business Administration degree in marketing and information technology from the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business and a Bachelor of Science degree in marketing from Virginia Tech.\n\n\"Marcus will be a valuable addition to our company's U.S. capital markets group as we expand the capabilities of our team in North Carolina and across the United States,\" adds John Kevill, Avison Young Principal and Managing Director, U.S. Capital Markets. \"His expertise in development greatly adds to our ability to provide solutions to local and national clients. His sales acumen and demonstrated commitment to collaboration and partnership make him an ideal fit for Avison Young.\"\n\nAvison Young is the world's fastest-growing commercial real estate services firm.
