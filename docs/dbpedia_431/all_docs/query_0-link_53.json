Biostatistics and Bioinformatics offers four educational degree programs: the PhD Program in Biostatistics, the Master of Biostatistics Program, the Master of Management in Clinical Informatics (MMCi) and the Clinical Research Training Program (CRTP). B&B is also the administrative home of the inter-departmental PhD Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics.\n\nThe department currently has more than 63 primary and joint faculty members and 25 secondary faculty members. Biostatistics and Bioinformatics offers five graduate programs, the PhD and Master of Biostatistics, the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB) PhD, the Clinical Research Training Program (CRTP) and the Master of Management in Clinical Informatics (MMCi).\n\nWebsite\n\nChair: Howard Wayne Francis, MD, MBA\n\nAssistant: Irish Hamilton\n\nBusiness Manager: Chris W. Tobias\n\nOffice: 4000 Yellow Zone, Duke Clinics\n\nCampus PO Box: DUMC 3805\n\nPhone: (919) 684-3834\n\nThe Department of Head and Neck Surgery & Communication Sciences currently comprises 64 diverse faculty members and clinical associates involved in patient care, research, education, and community engagement.\n\nFaculty members provide comprehensive, multidisciplinary, hospital-based care, including the regionally and nationally recognized clinical programs of the Duke Skull Base Program, Head and Neck Cancer Program within the Duke Cancer Institute, Duke Voice Care Center, and Duke Hearing Center. Research in the Department leverages the expertise across Duke University and includes the translation of discoveries in basic science into new treatment paradigms, the investigation of new clinical treatments and approaches to the management of head and neck and communication disorders, and the study of health delivery strategies and their impact on clinical outcomes and population health. Research led by faculty in the Department is funded by the National Institutes of Health, Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), Department of Defense (DOD), industry and philanthropic support.\n\nThe Department also commits itself to community engagement as a fourth mission area, with the goal of fostering innovative and equitable health solutions at the population level through outreach, partnership, and cultivation of a diverse and inclusive workforce. The department matches three residents every year for its 5-year residency program in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, and a fourth for a 7-year research intensive residency training program funded by an NIH training grant. Two one-year research fellowships are offered to medical students also funded by the same grant. Fellowships are currently available in Rhinology and Endoscopic Skull Base surgery, and Otology/Neurotology.\n\nThe department’s vision encompasses a continuum of discovery and commitment to training the next generation of leaders, with the goal of advancing the care of head and neck and communication disorders and promoting healthier connections.\n\nWebsite\n\nChair: Gerald Arthur Grant, MD\n\nAssistant: Tami Tuck\n\nBusiness Manager: Kathy Tobin\n\nThe Duke Department of Neurosurgery is a preeminent program at the forefront of patient care, research, and education, with more than 50 clinical and research faculty and 21 residents and seven fellows.\n\nSince becoming a department in the School of Medicine in 2015, Duke Neurosurgery has experienced remarkable growth in all areas, including clinical volume, patient access, patient outcomes, philanthropy, resident satisfaction, and culture and wellness.\n\nInvestigators receiving over $13 million in grant funding in 2020, and the department ranks fourth in the country for NIH funding among neurosurgery centers.\n\nThe world renown Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center is housed in the Department of Neurosurgery. In recent years, the department developed the first Division of Global Neurosurgery, which is now self-sustainable; a NeuroInnovations programs that spans the university; a Spine Division in partnership with Duke Orthopaedics; and the Duke Center for Brain and Spine Metastasis, which is now the fastest-growing clinical program at Duke. Faculty provide care at Duke University Hospital, Duke Regional Hospital, Duke Raleigh Hospital, Durham Veterans Affairs Hospital, and Alamance Regional Medical Center.\n\nWebsite\n\nChair: Erik Paulson, MD\n\nAssistant: Maria Nelson\n\nChief Administrative Officer: Jeanne Kirschner\n\nOffice: 40 Duke Medicine Circle, Room 2560, Red Zone, Duke South\n\nCampus PO Box: 3808\n\nPhone: (919) 684-7289\n\nThe Department of Radiology is committed to providing the highest quality imaging services, reporting, safety, education and support of innovative laboratory and clinical research.\n\nWe embrace a diverse and inclusive community of patients, students, staff, learners, and faculty. Our product is most successful when we work as teams.\n\nOur clinical operation is comprised of nine subspecialty divisions that include Abdominal Imaging, Breast Imaging, Cardiothoracic Imaging, Community Division, Interventional Radiology, Musculoskeletal Imaging, Neuroradiology, Nuclear Medicine and Radiotheranostics, and Pediatric Radiology. We have over 100 subspecialty clinical faculty, 52 residents and 32 fellows that serve 11 locations. Our residency is among the most competitive in the country and Radiology is a required clerkship for every Duke University medical student. Our radiologists work closely with referring physicians to provide state-of-the-art radiologic care and service to our patients.\n\nOur research operation is focused on improving patient care by discovering innovation in the imaging field. We have centers and faculty devoted to artificial intelligence, cutting edge applications of MR, pre-clinical small animal imaging with a focus on In-Vivo microscopy, and translational molecular imaging. We have 30 dedicated research faculty and 12 research-focused labs.\n\nWebsite\n\nDirector: Heather Whitson, MD, MHS\n\nOffice: Room 3502 Busse Building, Blue Zone, Duke South\n\nCampus: DUMC 3003, Durham, NC 27710\n\nPhone: (919) 660-7500\n\nEmail: AgingCenter@duke.edu\n\nThe Duke Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development (Duke Aging Center) is a multi-disciplinary hub for the promotion of healthy aging across the lifespan and management of social and medical complexities in late life. With more than 150 affiliated faculty members from across the University and Medical Center, and millions of dollars annually in aging-related research funding, the Center is a vital national resource for the study of aging.\n\nCurrent research includes: studies of resilience to late-life stressors; age-related functional decline; genomic, proteomic and metabolomic biomarkers of aging; exercise; osteoporosis; Alzheimer’s disease; health equity; cancer and aging; viral diseases of aging; depression in later life; caregiver stress; and religion/spirituality and health. The Center is dedicated to advanced training and innovative education for the next generation of gerontologists and geriatricians, and to expanding, connecting, and enhancing the field of aging-related research at Duke and beyond.\n\nWebsite​"
