        "text": "Review Panel\n\nThe review panel consists of distinguished Baylor College of Medicine educators from across different departments, schools and centers. Panel members are prior Norton Rose Fulbright recipients.\n\nReview Process\n\nThe first step is a review of the application portfolio to make sure it meets the submission and eligibility criteria. Then, the portfolios are assigned to a primary, secondary, and tertiary reviewer. During the panel meeting, these reviewers present the applicant's portfolio and propose initial scores based on criteria. Following a discussion, all members of the Review Panel score the portfolio. A successful applicant is one for whom at least 75% of the reviewers score the portfolio at 80% or higher, and the average of all reviewer scores is 80% or greater.\n\nInformation to exclude\n\nPlease be mindful not to include any material that violates HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) rights of patients or FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Acts) rights of learners. Do not include any solicited or unsolicited letters, notes, cards, or documents from patients or patients' family members (current or historical). Please do NOT solicit letters of support from your current trainees. It is, however, acceptable to include solicited or unsolicited letters, notes, and cards from supervisors, colleagues, members of the health care team, past trainees, and employees/ staff. Please make sure that such support letters do not contain references to patient information or identifiers. Do not include any documents that reveal the academic performance of learners where the learner is identified. Please redact information related to the performance of identified peers or colleagues."
