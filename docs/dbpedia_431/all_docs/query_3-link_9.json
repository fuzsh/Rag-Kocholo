        "text": "Rose Sisters Chips is an up-and-coming snack that has been beating the odds and growing at a quick pace.\n\nThis week Ari talks to Jonathan Marcus, President of Rose Sisters Brands and discovers the origin of their family's chip recipe, the story of getting started, and how they moved from co-packing to self-manufacturing.\n\nStarting at zero, Rose Sisters Brands began with no knowledge of food manufacturing, but took a crash course, first at Rutgers University and then through life experience with the own co-packer.\n\nThey quickly learned what they needed and felt they could do It more efficiently themselves. Now they are working through automating their processes - one step at a time.\n\nA fun and lively discussion that also touches on automation, marketing, distribution, and customer feedback.\n\nJonathan Marcus, Rose Sisters Brands\n\nWebsite: https://www.rosesisterschips.com/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/rosesisterschips/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosesisterschips/\n\nJonathan's LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-c-marcus-487113/\n\nAri Santiago, CEO, CompassMSP\n\nCompany Website: https://compassmsp.com/\n\nCompany LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/compass-msp/\n\nPodcast Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MadeinAmericaPodcast\n\nPodcast LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/made-in-america-podcast-with-ari\n\nPodcast YouTube: https://youtube.com/c/MadeinAmericaPodcastwithAri\n\nCompany LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/compass-msp/\n\nAri's LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/asantiago104/\n\nPodcast produced by Miceli Productions: https://miceliproductions.com/\n\nPodcast executive production by Gael Communications: https://www.gaelcommunications.com/\n\nJonathan and Ari discuss:\n\nCo-packing\n\nFood manufacturing\n\nAutomation\n\nCustomer feedback\n\nMarketing\n\nDistribution"
