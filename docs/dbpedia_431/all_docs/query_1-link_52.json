        "text": "As a plastic surgeon, I strive to take the very best care of my patients that is possible. My areas of clinical focus include cleft lip/palate; craniofacial disorders (such as plagiocephaly, craniosynostosis, and hemifacial microsomia); craniomaxillofacial trauma; ear anomalies (such as microtia); functional and cosmetic rhinoplasty; obstetrical brachial plexus palsy; and vascular anomalies (such as hemangioma and lymphatic or venous malformations). I feel honored and privileged to be entrusted with the care of my patients, and I take this responsibility very seriously. Each patient’s particular situation is unique. Therefore, in consultation, we will discuss your concerns and agree upon a plan that will yield the best outcomes possible.\n\nBefore scheduling your appointment, we strongly recommend you contact your insurance company to verify that the Duke Health location or provider you plan to visit is included in your network. Your insurance company will also be able to inform you of any co-payments, co–insurances, or deductibles that will be your responsibility. If you proceed in scheduling an appointment and your health insurance benefits do not participate with Duke, your out of pocket liability may be higher. We will contact you regarding your coverage and patient liability. If you are uninsured, learn more about our financial assistance policy."
