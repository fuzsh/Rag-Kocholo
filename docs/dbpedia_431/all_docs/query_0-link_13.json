        "text": "1996 Diploma in Psychology (Dipl. Psych.)\n\n2000 PhD in Psychology (Dr. rer. nat.)\n\n2006 Habilitation, Venia legendi in Cognitive Neuroscience.\n\nMarkus joined Durham University (UK) in April 2007. Prior to this he held positions at the Ruhr-University Bochum (Germany), University of Auckland (New Zealand) and Marmara University Istanbul (Turkey). Markus’ research covers the full range of topics that comprise biological and neuropsychology, from spatial cognition to attention, from neuroendocrinology to social cognition. He has made a particular contribution to the understanding of hormonal modulation of cognition and functional brain organisation by proposing and developing the “hypothesis of progesterone-mediated interhemispheric decoupling”, the idea that sex hormones modulate the interaction between the left and right cerebral hemispheres. More recently he proposed and developed a biopsychosocial approach of cognitive sex/gender differences. This work has been published in over 100 academic papers, in journals such as Archives of Sexual Behavior, Cortex, Hormones & Behavior, Journal of Neuroscience, Neuropsychologia, Neuroimage, Psychoneuroendocrinology, and Intelligence. Markus is committed to supporting and shaping the future of psychological science and has held roles as panel member and grant reviewer for funding bodies, including international research councils in Austria (ÖAW), Belgium (FNRS, FWO), Canada (NSERC), Germany (DFG), Israel (ISF), Ireland (SFI), The Netherlands (NWO), Switzerland (SNF), and the UK (British Academy, ESRC, MRC, Welcome Trust). He is member of the Advisory Board at Brain & Cognition and became Editor at Laterality in 2019."
