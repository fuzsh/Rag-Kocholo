In 2007 Albertus awarded him an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree in recognition of his \"remarkable and prolific career\" creating works that \"continue to challenge and delight the eye and the spirit.\" He was the husband of 55 years to Julia Moriarty Hayes '57. Two of his sculptures grace the Albertus campus: one at Walsh Hall, and another at the Hubert Campus Center. For more about Hayes's life and career, click here."
