        "text": "Durant is often described along the lines of “the most colorful and least liked” of all the men involved in the building of the railroad. He was a verbose, overconfident, and ruthless conniver who both provided the steam to connect the nation and orchestrated the biggest financial scandal of the century. It stands to reason that his daughter, Ella, would be forged from the same fire that he employed to connect a divided nation. However, it appears as though Ella spent very little time with her father. After all, leading the greatest engineering endeavor in the nation’s history and juggling dozens of land and stock schemes left little time for family bonding. Yet, the Civil War had not changed the country so much that the husband and father did not control his home and its inhabitants absolutely.\n\nInformation about Ella’s early life is sparse. She was schooled in private institutions in the U.S. and Europe and was considered a bright student. She was fluent in French, German, Italian, and Arabic. At age 20 she was living the lavish life of an American heiress in London, attending parties and cultivating friendships with some of the greatest literary minds of the era. Letters indicate that Ella’s mind was recognized as readily as her beauty; however, her aspirations were interrupted in 1875 by her father’s newest financial trouble.\n\nCertainly, it would’ve been a culture shock to go from London to the wilderness of New York state. Whatever Ella’s feelings on the matter were, they are not known to us now. The only account of her time there comes from an article she wrote for the New York Times, titled “Old Days in the Adirondacks.” The memories recalled are, perhaps, tinted with that rosy hue that only time can produce. Overall, Ellla’s time at the camp seemed to pass uneventfully. She shot a bear that was stealing food, she made roofing tiles when they were needed, and she jovially remembers once stealing a boat from a a resident guide and trapper known as “snake eye.” Even though the man thew a tornado of a tantrum when he caught her, she says that after apologizing to Snake Eye he, “was not only modified by my words, but ever after we were fast friends.”\n\nIn the end, William Durant was remembered with esteem as “the original promoter of the Adirondacks as a place of recreation for the moneyed classes.” Héloïse was not remembered much at all. Her literature never gained a notable following and there is no record of the time she spent with luminaries in London or elsewhere. We have no first-hand account of anything that she did or thought after leaving her father’s home in 1881. Her obituary notes that she was an author and mentions her involvement in clubs, but gives little detail aside from that. Any personal belongings that she had at the time of her death were passed along to her son. Ella’s son married the artist, Lillian Tiffany, but the couple never had children. It is possible that whatever mementoes or personal belongings Ella might have left are now lost.\n\nThe personal collections of her father and brother are housed in a numerous libraries, but outside of a handful of letters kept at Syracuse University, we have no way to know the inner thoughts of Héloïse Durant.\n\nIn 2017, a scrapbook was discovered that was dated 1854-1920. It was passed on from a distant relative, Howard Rose, to a family that kept it in their attic for over 30 years without knowing what it was. Inside there were love notes to Ella, certificates, a family tree, and sundry articles. The bulk of the content focused on the lawsuits. Even though the scrapbook supposedly belonged to Ella, it was found in a portfolio bearing the insignia of Lillian Tiffany Rose. This was not the the notebook of a woman who had spent her life writing and fighting to be heard. We can still hope that somewhere there is a yet undiscovered notebook that will shed some light on this prolific, yet elusive figure.\n\nWomen throughout history have struggled to be remembered. Typically, the women of wealth and power are more successful in gaining recognition, but even they can be pushed to the margins of history. There are hundreds, even thousands, of women like Heloïse Durant Rose who demonstrated bravery, tenacity, and creativity, but are nonetheless only remembered for the men that they interacted with, if they are remembered at all. Often their legacies will be lost forever, but sometimes with just a little digging we can find something that they left behind."
