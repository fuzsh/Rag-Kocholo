        "text": "Our president, Marc Guerrero, met yesterday with one of the most experienced football #executives at the top of European football, the new appointed Manchester United's CEO, Omar Berrada. There is an undeniable fascination with professional #football clubs the world over. But whilst the star players, head coaches and owners typically dominate the headlines, one of the most important figures in any club is undoubtedly its #CEO. What made CEOs successful in the past is no longer enough. The #context in which they operate has become fundamentally more #complex and traditional approaches to leadership are now insufficient. In the past, sporting success led to business success. That relationship is being reversed. In this #changing and increasingly stressful #environment, CEOs must bring to bear a unique blend of skills, experiences, and perspectives, as well as a knowledge of how to leverage the support of the board of directors, to help them run their football club.\n\nChelsea versus Aston Manor: Conflict of Titans In the domain of English football, scarcely any installations work up as much expectation and fervor as a conflict among Chelsea and Aston Manor. These two noteworthy clubs, with their rich practices and energetic fan bases, have a well established contention that goes back many years. Yet again as they get ready to go head to head, how about we dive into the set of experiences, elements, and key variables molding this lastingly exciting Read More https://lnkd.in/gUGATXkE\n\nHere's how Northampton Town Football Club (Official)'s crowds compare to Carlisle United FC Stevenage Football Club, Burton Albion Football Club, Leyton Orient Football Club , Lincoln City FC, Exeter City Football Club and every other League One club this season. So far Cobblers have welcomed 41,563 fans to home games this season. But how do those crowds compare with the likes of Oxford United Football Club, Exeter City Football Club, Lincoln City FC, and the rest of League One? Here we look at the alternative League One table, based on crowd averages. The figures are correct to Tuesday October 10 and come from the transfermarkt.co.uk website. Figures run from lowest average crowds to highest. https://lnkd.in/ddHpGtfB\n\nSt Pauli: Bundesliga promotion and leftist principles combine (with ‘death head’ flag) These are not normal characters, nor is this a normal story — but then St Pauli are not a normal club. Owned entirely by their members and probably more famous for their left-wing values than their football, they have styled themselves as the sport’s conscience. The cost of which is to be seen as a place where causes and inclusivity are more important than the score. ... writes Sebastian Stafford-Bloor in The Athletic. Oke Gottlich, who has been St Pauli’s president since November 2014, says: “Most people from conservative football believe participation, democracy, membership-driven models can‘t be successful. I want to run against this wall as long as I can. Even if it leaves me with a bloody head, I don’t care. I want something with the labels of participation and transparency to succeed, not just this old model where there is one captain — one guy with a lot of money or a lot of power.” As St. Pauli ascends to Germany's top football division, it carries not only the hopes of its fans but also the banner for sustainable and ethical sports management. Their success is proof that integrity and community spirit can coexist with competitive sports, making their story a beacon for clubs worldwide striving to unite tradition with modernity. St. Pauli is more than just a football club. More insights in today's #PlaymakersBrew. #StPauli #Football #SportsBusiness"
