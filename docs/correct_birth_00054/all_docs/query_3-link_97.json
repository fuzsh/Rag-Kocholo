        "text": "FORMER Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna has died aged just 49 after a long battle with cancer.\n\nThe ex-world No1 passed away peacefully surrounded by family in her native Czech Republic yesterday.\n\nNovotna won 24 WTA singles titles in 14 years on the professional women’s circuit, along with 76 doubles titles.\n\nThe Czech player had lost both 1993 and 1997 Wimbledon finals before finally winning in London beating Nathalie Tauziat in 1998.\n\nNovotna won the hearts of tennis fans around the world when she burst into tears after losing to German great Steffi Graf in 1993 and was consoled by the Duchess of Kent.\n\nWTA chief executive Steve Simon said: “Jana was an inspiration both on and off court to anyone who had the opportunity to know her.\n\n\"Her star will always shine brightly in the history of the WTA. Our condolences and our thoughts are with Jana's family.\"\n\nNovotna was renowned for her aggressive serve and volley game and achieved a career-high singles ranking of number two and was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\n1994 wimbledon winner Conchita Martinez paid tribute to Novotna on social media.\n\nShe said on Twitter: \"How sad to start the day with this terrible news, Jana Novotna leaves us too soon. DEP RIP JANA , you will be missed.\"\n\nMen's Wimbledon winner turned pundit Pat Cash said: \"So sad to hear that fellow Wimbledon champ Jana Novotna has passed, a sweeter nicer and more talented athlete you would never meet.\""
