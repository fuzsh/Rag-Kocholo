        "text": "Barbora Krejcíková (born December 18, 1995) began playing tennis at the age of 6 and entered her first ITF events in 2010. Krejcíková was coached by fellow Czech player Jana Novotná in her youth. In 2013, she ranked No. 3 in junior rankings when she won one singles title and three doubles titles that year. Krejcíková made her WTA debut in 2014 at the Gastein Ladies where she played doubles, and her single debut was at the Tournoi de Quebec. She went on to find major success in doubles with her partner Katerina Siniaková in 2018 when they won that year's French Open and Wimbledon Championships. Together they became the world No.1 doubles players for 2018. At the 2021 Rolland Garros, Krejcíková took surprise victories off Maria Sakkari and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to win the women's singles on top of winning the women's doubles that same event."
