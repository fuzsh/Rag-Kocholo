        "text": "Former Roland Garros champion Barbora Krejcikova has had a resurgent fornight at Wimbledon. Having entered the grass-court Grand Slam with just seven wins for the season in singles, the Czech is through to the quarterfinals for the first time, where she'll face another former winner in Paris, Jelena Ostapenko, on Centre Court.\n\nThe big payday that comes with such an achievement would make the Czech's late mentor, former Wimbledon Jana Novotna, pretty happy, too. As she waited out yet another rain delay at this year's Championships that affected her doubles match with Laura Siegemund on Tuesday, Krejcikova revealed the funny piece of advice that Novotna once gave her in a Q&A with fans on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"I donât have an exact answer to be honest. I still think about her A LOT so she is still teaching me in some way,\" Krejcikova wrote. \"I think her advices would be more accurate now.\n\n\"But funny thingâshe was very keen on me starting to fly in a business class as soon as I could afford it.\"\n\nThe questions she answered weren't just about her off-court interests. Krejcikova is a noted fan of tennis (unlike some of her peers) who likes to catch matches courtside whenever she can at a tournament, but her favorite live match was a childhood memory.\n\nFittingly, it was doubles (Lucie Safarova and Nicole Vaidisova against Dominika Cibulkova and Daniela Hantuchova) in 2008, where the futer Grand Slam winner served as a ball kid.\n\nShe loved watching Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, \"adored\" Justine Henin, and would also change two rules of the sport if she could.\n\n\"More time for serve than 25 seconds,\" she wrote. \"And tbh I am not a fan of grunting, especially when itâs inconsistent, meaning when your opponent start to grunt or grunts louder during key points, it can be disturbing.\""
