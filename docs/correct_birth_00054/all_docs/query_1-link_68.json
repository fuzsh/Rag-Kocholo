        "text": "Czech tennis player Jana Novotna has died at the age of 49 after a long battle with cancer.\n\nNovotna won the Wimbledon singles title in 1998 after losing in the final in both 1993 and 1997.\n\nDuring a 14-year professional career, Novotna won 24 singles titles and reached a career-high number two in the singles rankings in 1997. She was a prolific and top-ranked doubles player, collecting 16 major titles in doubles and mixed doubles.\n\nThe Women's Tennis Association (WTA) said Novotna died peacefully surrounded by family in the Czech Republic.\n\nMartina Navratilova, the tennis great who was also born in what was then Czechoslovakia, tweeted: \"The tennis world is so sad about the passing of Jana Novotna. I am gutted and beyond words. Jana was a true friend and an amazing woman.\"\n\nThe 1998 Wimbledon title was Novotna's only major singles crown, seeing her eventually triumph after two losses in the final at the All England Lawn Tennis Club in 1993 and 1997. She also lost in the 1991 Australian Open final.\n\nWhile she finally captured Wimbledon singles title she won over the centre court crowd five years after wasting a big lead in the decisive set in a tough three-set loss to Steffi Graf.\n\nUnable to hide her disappointment, Novotna cried on the shoulder of Britain's Duchess of Kent at the prize giving ceremony and was gently comforted by the royal, who told her: \"I know you will win it one day, don't worry.\"\n\nNovotna ultimately had her moment five years later when she beat Nathalie Tauziat in straight sets to win Wimbledon. At the time, she was the oldest first-time winner of a major singles title at age 29.\n\nThere wear tears again from Novotna, this time of joy, and the Duchess of Kent was present again to congratulate her.\n\n\"She was a true champion in all senses of the word, and her 1998 triumph will live long in the memory,\" Wimbledon organisers the All England Club said in tribute to Novotna.\n\n\"The thoughts of all those at Wimbledon are with her family and friends.\"\n\nNovotna won hearts around the world\n\nFellow Czech and four-time major singles champion Hana Mandlikova, who coached Novotna for her Wimbledon win, said: \"It's hard to find words. Jana was a great girl and I'm happy that she won Wimbledon after all. It's so sad when someone so young dies.\"\n\nNovotna won three Olympic medals, silver in the doubles at the 1988 Seoul Games and silver again in the doubles and bronze in the singles in Atlanta in 1996. She also won the Fed Cup with her country in 1988.\n\nShe was inducted into tennis' Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\nEven after retiring in 1999, Novotna was desperate to stay involved in tennis and became a commentator and coach.\n\n\"I'm dependent on tennis,\" she said in an interview two years ago. \"A day without it would be terrible.\"\n\nMembers of the current Czech Fed Cup team said Novotna \"supported us in the stands any time she could be there. We'll miss her.\"\n\n\"Jana was an inspiration both on and off court to anyone who had the opportunity to know her,\" WTA chief executive Steve Simon said.\n\n\"Her star will always shine brightly in the history of the WTA.\""
