        "text": "Who was Jana Novotna?\n\nNovotna was born in 1968 in Brno, Czech Republic.\n\nShe turned pro in 1987 and was primarily known for her success as a doubles player.\n\nDID JANA NOVOTNA KEEP ILLNESS A SECRET?\n\nNovotna was initially coached by Mike Estep before going under the wing of four-time Grand Slam singles champion Hana Mandlíková.\n\nAt the peak of her powers in the 1990s, Novotna features in one of the most enduring images in the long history of Wimbledon after famously being consoled by the Duchess of Kent after losing the 1993 final to Steffi Graf.\n\nShe was known for her battling qualities, though, and overcame another final defeat in 1997, this time to Martina Hingis, to finally get her hands on the trophy in 1998, beating Frenchwoman Nathalie Tauziat.\n\nThat ended up being her only grand slam title in singles, though she was prolific in the doubles, winning 24 grand slams and ticking off the full set of Wimbledon, the French Open, the Australian Open and the US Open.\n\nNovotna also represented her country with success, claiming silver medals at the 1988 and 1996 Olympics as well as a bronze in Atlanta.\n\nShe was the world number one ranked player in doubles in 1990 and got as high as number two in the singles in 1997.\n\nWho has paid tribute to Jana Novotna?\n\nWTA chief executive officer Steve Simon said: \"Jana was an inspiration both on and off court to anyone who had the opportunity to know her.\n\n\"Her star will always shine brightly in the history of the WTA. Our condolences and our thoughts are with Jana's family.\"\n\nFormer British number one Jo Durie paid tribute to Novotna's spirit on court.\n\nShe said on Twitter: \"Oh no how terrible sad. All thoughts to her family and friends. So glad Jana won Wimbledon. Such a fighter on court & a wicked sense of humour.\"\n\nFormer American doubles star Pam Schriver added: \"Jana was as kind as she was athletic, as smart as she was competive. I can't believe she is gone this soon. Her smile lives forever young.\"\n\nFormer British player Andrew Castle, now a commentator for the BBC, said: \"What a terrible shame. She was good fun of an evening, a champion on court, so tough to play against. And her smile was wonderful.\"\n\nMartina Navratilova tweeted: “The tennis world is so sad about the passing of Jana Novotna...I am gutted and beyond words- Jana was a true friend and an amazing woman…”"
