Acknowledgments Several individuals directly inspired this project and gave me their unflagging support. Professor Moshe Lazar, a key member of my committee, taught a translation course in the Summer of 1990 that rekindled my interest in translating poetry and fiction. My friends and colleagues Pamela Gilbert and Robert Johnson encouraged me to turn my translations of Jaroslav Seifert into a dissertation project. Josef Raab was both a devoted friend and editor of the first On the Waves ofTSF version. My kind and patient mentor, Professor Jay Martin, chaired this \"unorthodox\" project and generously gave of his time and vast knowledge. His psychoanalytical training proved especially helpful in times of distress that seem inevitable in projects of this magnitude. I also owe thanks to the members of my guidance and my dissertation committees: Professors Paul Alkon, Michael Heim and David St. John for their enthusiasm and assistance. Dean Richard Ide deserves thanks for co-sponsoring my research trip to Prague in May 1994. There, at the beautiful Klementinum, the Czech National Library, I received competent and tireless help from the staff, mainly Vera Tafatov£ and Ludmila Ulrichova. Jana Kalserovd at the city archives in Pilsen likewise aided my research. I am immensely grateful for the support of Jaroslav Seifert's daughter Jana Seifertova-Plichtova. My parents provided valuable linguistic and research assistance. But most of all, I am indebted to them for always having been readers and for having spoken in strange tongues whenever they did not want their little ones to understand and finally for uprooting me and making me comfortable in more than one country.

Abstract The Early Poetry o f Jaroslav Seifert: Translation Theory and Practice The centerpiece of the dissertation is my translation of four collections of poetry by Czech poet and 1984 Nobel Prize winner Jaroslav Seifert: City in Tears (1921), Sheer Love (1923), On the Waves ofTSF (1925), and The Nightingale Sings Poorly (1926). I am the first professional translator of the four volumes, authorized by the estate of Jaroslav Seifert. Chapter I is a biographical overview charting the poet's life and career. It briefly outlines important influences, Seifert's political and aesthetic affiliations and provides a historical context for the translated volumes. Chapter II offers a close look at Seifert's development during the 1920s and explores the poetics as well as the historical events marking the shift of the Czech avant-garde artists union Devgtsil from the doctrine of proletarian art to poetism. I also discuss the major native and international influences that converge in Seifert's early poetry. Chapter III focuses on the individual four collections and traces their respective genesis in the context of DevStsil, their changing aesthetics, and their publication history. Close textual readings of major themes and of important individual poems complete this discussion. The existing English translations of Jaroslav Seifert's works and their theories are the main emphasis of Chapter IV. I show why some of the few translations to-date are unsatisfactory or even erroneous. This section also serves as a rationale for my own translation theory and practice. Next, Chapter V contains my original translations of the poet's first four books that are guided by the idea of congeniality. I also follow the originals, each in its first printing, in typography, layout and pagination. Finally, Chapter VI consists of full annotation for each volume, supplying explanatory notes where appropriate and necessary. R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner.

Though Seifert's career remains vivid as part of the history of the Czech national consciousness, and the appearance exists that the details of his life must be well-known, even the native reader can turn to only a few brief biographical sketches and Seifert's own charming memoir VSecky krdsy sv&ta [All the Beauties of the World] for biographical information. How is it that this poet, whose prolific output spans more than six peripatetic decades of this century and who remains one of the best-known and best­ loved writers of his country, is personally still relatively obscure? In fact, only one monograph, Zdenek Pesat's excellent portrait Jaroslav Seijert (1991) is the only work giving more than a perfunctory sketch of his life and writings. The reasons for this relative dearth of published biographical information are political and reflect Czechoslovakia's many painful transformations during Seifert's lifetime (1901-1986). Like many artists and intellectuals actively involved in the reformist Prague Spring, after its subsequent annihilation by the Warsaw Pact invasion in August 1968, Seifert along with his reviewers, critics and philologists was mainly relegated to writing \"for the drawer.\" At best manuscripts were copied and circulated by readers as samizdats, with little chance of official publication in Czechoslovakia. Emigre publishing houses in Canada, Germany, Switzerland and other countries filled an important void, but did not have the financial means and practical access to mass distribution and, naturally, to the Czech readership at home. Czechoslovakia's isolation since the Communist takeover in 1948— changing somewhat with a \"thaw\" in 1956 and the Prague Spring of 1968— worsened again during the time of \"normalization,\" the bleak and politically unchanging 1970s and had clear repercussions on the cultural and literary exchange with the West. During this R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner.

In fact, many of the country's best writers and artists either lived in exile or suffered hardships at home in low-paying, degrading jobs and were barred from publication. At the same time, the 1970s were a time of detente when most Western countries pursued non-confrontational policies and instead chose to advance human rights causes in more remote regions of the world, rather than in their own European \"backyard.\" All too overt support of dissident writers would have nm counter to this goal of not offending neighboring Eastern European communist regimes, among which Czechoslovakia was especially rigid ideologically. Thus, it was difficult to find a \"market\" in the West for literature produced by dissidents, even when manuscripts were successfully smuggled out of the country. Despite the difficulties, Seifert, along with other Czech artists and intellectuals, signed Charter 77, a document affirming the Human Rights Declaration of Helsinki and saw two of his works translated into English. According to Zdenek Pesat, the Czech government was seeking a modus vivendi with Seifert, whose works published prior to 1968 were put out repeatedly in reeditions while his new manuscripts were ignored. In exchange for his silence on human rights matters, the official authorities promised Seifert publication of his new books, an arrangement which Seifert often broke (Pesat 213-214). The international publicity resulting from the establishment of Charter 77 and Seifert's national acclaim granted him, as it did for Vaclav Havel, certain clout and relative immunity. Seifert continued to intervene on behalf of people persecuted by the hard-line regime and, consequently, even as his new books started appearing with minor censorious deletions in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the critics were not allowed to write about them.

Unprepared, booksellers were not in the slightest able to meet the demand of the reading public for translations of Seifert's poetry or even information about his career. One slim volume, Im Spiegel hat er das Dunkel, put out by a small publishing house in 1982, was all of Seifert's poetry available in German. The anthology consists of selections from Morovy sloup [The Plague Column] and DeStnik z Piccadilly [An Umbrella from Piccadilly].1 Likewise, in the English-speaking world, very few translations existed: Lyn Coffin's translation The Plague Monument (1980), was published in the U. S. by SVU Press, run by the Czechoslovak Society of Art and Sciences. This rendition of Seifert's work strikes the reader as wordy and unpoetic, yet, naturally, it was a step in the right direction. Similarly, Paul Jagasich's and Tom O'Grady's The Casting of Bells (1983),2 while well- intentioned, reveals the translators' grave linguistic deficiencies, resulting in misunderstandings, inaccuracies and downright misrepresentations of Seifert's text. A lack of understanding both of Seifert and his time is obvious in subsequent translations by Paul Jagasich, published in a handful of copies by the author, whose prolific activity can at best be described as amateurish. Finally, translations by Ewald Osers of The Plague Column and of An Umbrella from Piccadilly were published in England in 1979 and in 1983, respectively.^ Osers is precise and his knowledge of Czech profound, but 1 Written in 1968-70, The Plague Column was first published in an exile edition (Koln: Index, 1977) before finally seeing publication in Czechoslovakia in 1981. An Umbrella from Piccadilly was circulated in samizdat copies between 1978 and 1979 in Czechoslovakia and was likewise first published abroad (Mtinchen: Poezie mimo domov, 1979) before appearing in Prague in 1982 with one deletion due to censorship (Mestan 224). 277ie Casting of Bells is a translation of Odlevdnt z v o n u (1967). ^By Terra Nova Editions, London & Boston and by London Magazine Editions, London, respectively.

For an in-depth look at the just-mentioned translations please see Chapter IV. Obviously, following the Nobel Prize award, more translations appeared, among them most memorable and informative the anthology The Selected Poetry of Jaroslav Seifert (1986), assembled by George Gibian and translated by Osers and the nearly impeccable translation and facsimile edition of On the Waves of TSF (Aufden Wellen von TSF) in German by the Austrian publisher Hora Verlag. English-language criticism was likewise difficult to get by. Robert Pynsent's Czech Prose and Verse (1979) is a useful general \"survey of Czech literature from 1774 to 1939\" and anthology at the same time.4 However, the author resorts to labeling Czech writers as \"obnoxious\" (Jakub Demi) or calls Helena Malffova, Ivan Olbracht's common-law wife, \"an overrated incompetent\" (lxiv, lxviii). As opposed to this, Alfred French's 1969 book The Poets of Prague: Czech Poetry Betioeen the Wars is a benevolent and sensitive treatment specifically of the Czech avant-garde of the 1920s.^ The translations of excerpts from Czech poetry, provided by the author and other translators, are fairly useful, printed as they are in both languages. Yet a book of this scope and general accuracy should not contain such obvious untruths as that Jaroslav Seifert celebrated a Paris that he had never seen (46). Seifert visited Italy and France, and Paris, in 1923 and on two subsequent occasions. Yet, paradoxically, Seifert was no literary unknown, even in the West. After all, the Swedish Academy selected him from many names in 1984 (Graham Greene, Jorge Luis Borges and Claude Simon, among others were discussed that year) for its annual 4Robert Pynsent.

According to Cestmir Peciva,6 the linguist and slavist Roman Jakobson had long championed Seifert and among the Swedish slavists professor L ’ ubomir Durovic from Lund was a strong advocate of Seifert since 1973. Peciva describes the selection process, during which until February 1 each year the Academy receives about 100 suggestions from 600 academics and former laureates world-wide and whittles this list down to about five candidates by June 1. Then, eighteen Academy members meet every Thursday at a nearby restaurant to debate the roster of remaining candidates. When the Swedish Academy officially announced the award to Seifert on October 11,1984, it stated that he had been one of the candidates for a long time, thus dispelling the impression that his nomination was due to political or \"trendy\" considerations (Peciva). The Nobel Prize award was of course a political matter in communist Czechoslovakia that was resisting glasnost and perestroika until late in 1989. The Writers Union responded with embarrassed silence viewing the honor bestowed on Czechoslovakia's greatest living poet as political willfulness (Pesat 214), while the authorities attempted to control Seifert's sudden world-wide fame. They hindered access to the ailing poet, who at the time of the award was hospitalized and received the happy news with some delay. In fact, as Seifert's physician and friend, Alois Volkman reports, he was barred from visiting the poet, with whom he had met every Friday for years. Ostensibly to allow the Nobel laureate much-needed rest, the government effectively held him captive in his hospital room, guarded by two officers of the much-feared State Police. 6In an article in the Munich-based Czech emigre newpaper Geske slovo, excerpted on the dust-jacket of Jaroslav Seifert, Knizka polibkti.

Seifert. Never heard, never read.' It was not his fault that he was not sufficiently informed because there is hardly any information about Jaroslav Seifert\" (61-62). Prazdk rightly goes on to blame the communist regime for effectively silencing scores of writers and artists for more than four decades, until the \"Velvet Revolution\" of 1989, which restored democracy in Czechoslovakia. Of course, Czech readers knew Seifert's works well. To them, he was synonymous with modem poetry and increasingly a household name since the mid- 1930s. People learned his poems by heart; to this day readers rapidly snap up any reprint of his books. Eva H. Plattner notes that during the twelve years preceding the 1984 Nobel Prize 300,000 reprints of Seifert's earlier poetry were published in Czech; these all sold out in Prague bookstores, especially when the award was announced (73). And this front place in a nation of approximately ten million readers of Czech (not counting the five million Slovaks— part of the Czechoslovak federation until 1993 — who likewise understand, and some of whom may read Czech). George Gibian points out that the number of copies published —and sold—of works by Czech poets is frequently several times larger than that of American poets in the United States, which has a population twenty times greater. Or, to put it in another way, perhaps fifty times as many books of poetry are bought by Czechs as by Americans. (1) To comprehend what Seifert and other writers, poets and artists in general, mean to the Czechs, it is important to understand the specific relationship between artists and the public. A small nation that has had occasion to mistrust its political R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner.

This has been the situation since the National Revival started in the late 18th century and continued well into the 19th century, when the Czechs were struggling to maintain their language, culture, and traditions vis-a-vis Habsburg domination. Since then, in times of trouble, the Czech people turn primarily to their artists and intellectuals for solace and for leadership. Jaroslav Seifert himself fully understood, welcomed, and even demanded the responsibility of being the conscience of the nation. He knew that as a poet he was the bearer of historical truth: It is obvious that poets and writers of prose fiction are much more engaged with the truth than painters and musicians because they work with words and speech; obviously, too, we are talking about the truth that lies beneath the surface, that exists solidly behind the appearance of things. Furthermore, the readership encounters die author's words with a great willingness to trust, to believe; the readers are bound to believe that they are going to gain in experience, they seek to identify with the author's words; they want to find expressions of their own experience in literature. But they want to see that experience enriched, structured, expressed by an artist, a poet, so that it will acquire a new value. However, I would like to go further, to generalize this demand on the poet's being the conscience of the nation to include everything that is connected with the truth. Most simply, this means that every person should live and act as a responsible human being in relation to one's self, to one's children and to society as a whole. That everyone should view his or her life in an historical context and live as a human being responsible to history. (Heneka et al. 126)^ Vaclav Havel formulated this postulate of \"living in truth\" most famously in his essay \"The Power of the Powerless.\" Seifert does not invoke heroism, but a solid, basic human decency, perhaps in the sense of the German term Zivilcourage along the lines of a classical Aristotelian view: \"When I write, I try not to lie— that's all. If one cannot tell the truth, at least one must not lie— just keep silent\" (Heneka et al. 127). Although this may imply that at times intellectuals may be valued more for their character, courage ^All translations from the Czech are mine unless otherwise noted.

Even to his fellow artists Seifert's actions were a yardstick they applied to their own behavior. Speaking for his generation, Cenek Praz&k calls Seifert \"a seismograph of honor\" that provided comfort and guidance amidst the ups and downs of Czechoslovakia's changing fortunes and its many national catastrophes during this century (62). Moreover, Seifert's humble origin, unassuming manner, and unaffected simplicity won him the hearts of his many readers. Chapter I of this dissertation is a biographical overview charting the poet's life and career with particular emphasis on the 1920s that saw publication of his early poetry. It briefly outlines important influences, Seifert's political and aesthetic affiliations and provides a historical context for the translated volumes. Chapter II offers a closer look specifically at Seifert's development as an artist during the 1920s and details the poetics as well as the historical events marking the shift of the avant- garde artists union Dev&sil from the doctrine of proletarian art to poetism. It also discusses the major native and international influences that converge in Seifert's early volumes of poetry. Chapter III focuses in turn each of the four collections and traces their respective genesis in the context of DevStsil, the changing aesthetics informing each of them and their publication history in magazines of the time. Close textual readings of major themes and important individual poems complement this discussion. The existing English translations of Jaroslav Seifert's works and the theories behind them are the main emphasis of Chapter IV. I attempt to show why some of the few translations to-date are unsatisfactory or even erroneous. Moreover, this section serves as a rationale for my own translation theory and practice.

Chapter VI, finally, consists of full annotation for each collection of poetry with the American reader in mind, supplying explanatory details where appropriate and necessary. An appendix was added to accommodate the long poem \"A Girl,\" that Seifert included in his second edition of City in Tears (Appendix A) and to make available to the reader an excerpt from the poet's charming memoir All the Beauties of the World (the episode \"The Kitchen Clock\" in Appendix B). Though I am aware of the limited audience for poetry, much more so for poetry in translation coming from a small nation, I translated the four volumes and wrote about them with full conviction that there is a need for deeper understanding of this artist, his time and place. After all, the Nobel Prize award ten years ago secured Seifert a lasting place in world literature and today's climate of multiculturalism seems to favor marginalized or lesser known literatures and writers.

Not surprisingly, the book, one of only two long prose pieces Seifert ever wrote, is subtitled Stories and Memories. This also indicates Seifert's explicitly stated intent: to gossip about the dead, but benevolently and with affection, not sparing himself (ABW 10). Vitriolic attacks and vicious settling of accounts, so common in the recent autobiographical genre, are noticeably absent in Seifert. Seifert knew and befriended many important Czech writers, poets, painters and other artists and intellectuals, particularly in the feverish and artistically productive third decade of the 20th century. His memoir can also be seen, then, as a narrative monument to those who otherwise might unjustly be forgotten and whose 1 For biographical data I am most indebted to Zdenek Pesat's 1991 informative monograph Jaroslav Seifert as well as to its critical precursor Dialogy s poezii (1985), and to Antonin Mestan's entry on Seifert in his concise history of Czech literature <jeska literatura 1785- 1985. For social history I consulted Vgra Olivovd, dskoslovenske dSjiny 1914-1939; Ferdinand Peroutka, Budovanistatu-, Podiven, &$i v dSjinach nave doby and Vaclav Cerny, PamSti, vol 1. ^ The book is the product of a collaboration between the two eminent exile publishing houses Index in Koln and Sixty-Eight Publishers in Toronto, Canada on the occasion of the author’s eightieth birthday.

The book is not an autobiography in any strict sense, furnishing dates and abiding by chronology; rather, it is an elliptical, partly repetitive narrative in poetic prose, a tribute in episodes and vignettes to deceased friends and associates, to passing, to long-lost youth and to the sensual \"beauties of the world,\" Seifert's life-long recurring theme, dating back as far as the closing poem of the same name in his second collection Sheer Love (1923). Seifert does not pretend to be an exact historian; instead, his narratives often take the shape of stories he likes to tell his granddaughter about his youth (ABW 394). Seifert, then a septuagenarian, wrote his memoir during the early 1970s when a look into the past perhaps afforded more consolation than the bleak present, which was marked by the recent crushing of the Prague Spring and the reinstatement of a immutably rigid hard-line communist regime when Seifert's new poetry was not publishable in Czechoslovakia. But the work is devoid of bitterness or self-pity. Although the gloomy seasons, fall and winter, resound through the narrative, and symbolically correspond to the eve of the reminiscing aging poet's life, many self-ironic anecdotes and humorous remembrances emanate a lighter air and counterbalance the nostalgia and loneliness of someone who is the sole survivor of a great generation and the last to tell about it.3 Yet Seifert's characteristic affirmation of life is the stronger current in this tension; even in his scarce criticism of others, he is discreet, understanding, mild, and forgiving towards human foibles. His modesty seems unaffected; in fact, he stresses his 3 For a taste, literally, of the flavor evoked by Seifert's narration, please refer to my translation of the vignette \"The Kitchen Clock\" (section 55 in the original) in Appendix B.

In Knizka polibku [The Book of Kisses]/* he discusses this lifelong uneasiness and self-restraint when his public persona was concerned, and explains that he preferred to speak about himself in verse and used the \"I\" to invite the reader's identification with him and to express universally felt emotions. Of modesty he assumes that it can function as part of an author's stylization, which may be inescapable: \"After all, at the bottom of the most modest human soul there surely slumbers a small flame of vanity\" (KniZka 116). Looking back with the indulgence of old age, Seifert good-humoredly chides himself for youthful pride when, at twenty, he saw his first book of verse appear to universal accolades from Czech critics (ABW111). As in his poetry, Seifert primarily lives through the senses. Continually, he vividly evokes simple pleasures and frames his memories by focusing upon the help of smells, perfumes, colors, flowers, music and the taste of wine and food. The olfactory and tactile explorations of a magical-seeming external world are accompanied by his representation of the innocent wonderment of a young, naive m ind— his own. Seifert admits to the healthy appetite of a sybarite (ABW 317ff.), resembling more the inclinations of an unsophisticated gourmand than those of a polished gourmet. For example, it is characteristic that his fond memories of Roman Jakobson are inextricably tied to the latter's incomparable Russian blini, for which Seifert even supplies the recipe. Still, Seifert does not count outright hedonism among his vices (ABW 356) perhaps because his tastes are so earthy and plain, thus absolving him from guilt. Seifert unequivocally denounces the affectations of \"the so-called bohemia\" and insists 4 This book was published by the Swiss emigre publishing house Konfrontace in 1984 as a tribute to Seifert, who had just received the Nobel Prize for literature. It is an anthology of Seifert's poetry no longer available or suppressed along with reminiscences and congratulatory notes by Czech dissidents and exiles.

But unlike many of his peers with decidedly middle-class, \"bourgeois\" roots, Seifert was a genuine proletarian and did not need to fashion himself into one when it was a stylish mannerism among leftist- leaning intellectuals. Jaroslav Seifert was bom on September 23,1901 in Zizkov, a working-class neighborhood of Prague. It is this environment that richly informed not only his early poetry, but to which he kept returning in his mature work— long after moving to the quiet and idyllic suburb of Brevnov in June 1938, where Seifert lived until his death, and which he often jokingly called \"wuthering heights\" (ABW 462), apparently in playful reference to Emily Bronte's novel, or \"windy hill in the Abbacy of Brevnov.\"5 In his memoir, Seifert likewise frequently harks back to his Zizkov youth in what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire before and during World War I. He recalls a life of poverty and want, even as he records the experience, rich in sensual impressions, which fueled his abundant imagination. He attempts to perceive the lyricism of the everyday squalor and feels closely tied to Zizkov because it was a place of initiation, most prominently, into romantic and erotic love, which for Seifert are inseparable. All this gradual discovery is shrouded in mystery in the naive bashful youngster's vision; and one reason for Seifert's lasting charm may be the fact that all his life, in his works, he retained some of the innocent naivefe and sense of awe. Though Seifert's family suffered genuine hardship, his wonder and its lyrically idyllic stylization is even noticeable in accounts of the more difficult moments of Seifert's Zizkov youth, which, along with Seifert's kaleidoscopic narration, exactly 5 In an unpublished letter to the critic and close friend Bohumil Polan dated March 21, 1966.

He describes the densely populated squalid tenement blocks from the 19th century, built for commercial profit and speculation and without much consideration for their occupants. In recalling the \"mournful melody of decay and the smell of poverty\" in which people struggled for their meager happiness, he declares: \"I fell in love with even the uninviting dead-end streets, full of dust, soot and lousy grass between cobblestones\" (ABW 88). The gray, gloomy and often dank buildings had galleries or walkways on which women washed laundry and loudly sang popular songs. Seifert recalls how in one his childhood homes these walkways sometimes turned into theater boxes, when the tenants gathered there to watch an amateur troupe performing in the enclosed yard below. The living conditions were trying: The only water faucet was located in the open gallery and served seven tenants. There was no laundry room, so the women set up their wash-tubs in the hallways, kitchens or the tiny dark yard, which was replete with large rats. Bathrooms were rare and Seifert delicately avoids detailing the lack of amenities in his early environment (ABW 252). Zizkov was teeming with pubs and wine bars; there was one in every four or five houses. As a boy, Seifert would sit on neighborhood steps with his friends and watch the drunks and listen with keen interest and curiosity to their sentimental love songs and boisterous rowdy tunes. Seifert's mother, a devout Catholic, tried to counter this influence with attendance at evening mass and baroque church hymns. Seifert admits that powerful inspiration for the poetry to come sprang from all these disparate sources (ABW 181). Young Jaroslav also loved cemeteries. He often played on the nearby Olsanske cemeteries, partly out of necessity, because Zizkov boasted very few parks, and partly because one of Seifert's younger sisters, who had died in infancy, was buried there. Moreover, daily funeral processions passed by his house. He R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner.

Ironically, the cemetery twice became the setting for Seifert's first glimpses of human love and sexuality— first, when he chanced upon a couple passionately kissing in the dusk on a spring night, and on a later occasion when a playmate briefly and coyly exposed her genitals. Both encounters, each also linked to fragrances in his memory, impressed him deeply: \"To this day I wander with this first revelation of woman\" {ABW283). A sense of longing and mystery envelops these first experiences and Seifert confesses to an early attraction to his female classmates' sweetly-smelling hair that he yearned to touch, but, overwhelmed by his shyness, could not dare to do so {ABW89). Seifert's parents apparently successfully and tolerantly reconciled the disparate worlds of the poet's early experience. His mother, \"a quiet, lyrical Catholic, heeding God's laws and those of the Church\" shook off the grim daily routine by attending mass. Religion, Seifert writes, \"was her poetry\" {ABW 283). His father was a social democrat and atheist, often taking his son to rallies and party meetings. Zdenek Pesat convincingly argues that the happy coexistence of these two influences profoundly impressed themselves on Seifert and ensured that the poet was never prone to radical excesses, in life or his work, but always strove to reconcile differences and to harmonize extremes {Seifert 10). Certainly, the young boy effortlessly alternated between the two worlds, sometimes on the same evening when intoning socialist songs at political meetings or attending people's rallies after singing long Marian hymns and standing next to his mother in the church pew. The mutual respect Seifert's parents had for one another's convictions was apparent in the modest wedding gifts they exchanged: The bride gave a silver watch- R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner.

The groom bought a gold necklace with a cross for his future wife. Particularly during World War I both gifts were often pawned until eventually they were auctioned away and permanently lost due to Seifert's father's unemployment. Seifert remembers long lines in which all family members took turns waiting before closed storefronts for meager food rations during the war. The worsening supply of food and all other essentials in the Austro-Hungarian Empire culminated in March 1918 when entire populations suffered hunger and weakened by insufficient diet, many workers contracted tuberculosis which spread epidemically. Strikes ensued which paralyzed the war industry and further destabilized the moribund system, thus paving the way for the founding of the first Czechoslovak Republic in October 1918. Seifert's father was a trained locksmith, but longed to become an entrepreneur, a vocation for which he evidently lacked talent, as Seifert observes. For a short time he worked as a clerk in a small loan company but after it defaulted, he lost all his savings and incurred crushing debt. He then borrowed still more money and unsuccessfully tried to make a living by selling oil paintings, mostly copies of famous portraits like Murillo's Immaculata, made to order by a poor painter with seven children whom Seifert's father kind-heartedly yet ineffectually more or less subsidized. Even then, it seems, the young Jaroslav saw his father's actions as quixotic. The painter was noi without talent but had to engage in this hack work to survive. Seifert's father in turn never bargained but paid generously and promptly. Soberly the son admired the negotiating skills of the painter, noted their absence in his progenitor and even believed that he discerned pity for the elder Seifert in the painter's demeanor. And so, inevitably, the father never made a living out of this entrepreneurial R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without perm ission. 17 effort. During the worst days of the war, when coal was rare, the Seiferts burned the remaining paintings with their frames for fuel. Afterward, Jaroslav's father briefly held a job in a factory, but the plant soon ceased operation. Later he found employment in an orthopedic shop manufacturing prosthetics for maimed soldiers— a job he kept until his death. The family frequently moved from one Zizkov apartment to the next, partly in response to its changing fortunes and therefore the amount of rent it could spend. Seifert comments with compassion on his father's string of misfortunes: \"Another misspent life, full of bitterness and disappointment. And mother softly cried\" (ABW 83). Although Seifert on several occasions asserts that he loved both his parents \"limitlessly\" and equally, there are two interesting, somewhat equivocal passages that shed a more subtle light on his relationship to each parent. The first concerns an incident that occurred when he was fourteen or fifteen years old. As he tells it, a dandyish young Seifert disliked helping his mother push a make-shift ugly cart to bring home whatever coal she could find. One day, feeling ashamed to be with her, he dodged his mother when he saw her in the street burdened with a heavy sack of coal. Looking back on the shallow pride of his youth, the autobiographer reproaches his youthful self for cruelty and cowardice even as he still affectionately empathizes with the folly of adolescence. The other remark is Seifert's confession that he loved the father more and felt closer to him because their characters were more alike while predominantly feeling sorrow and pity toward his mother for the sad lot she endured. This is only superficially surprising from a writer who is best-known for his 1954 collection Maminka [Mother], which most readers without much concern for the creative process and its fictionalization understand too literally as an autobiographical tribute to R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without perm ission. 18 Seifert's own mother (A BW 288). Again, Seifert's narrative is a telling and retelling partly of the same events, yet in subtle variations that sometimes may even appear contradictory; for example, the consistent lyrical idealization of innocence, youth and its freedom from worry are called somewhat into question when Seifert uncharacteristically insists that children are often plagued by anxiety and that his own childhood was anything but happy, primarily overshadowed by his fear for his father who was fifteen years older than his mother (ABW375). But contradiction only reinforces the character of this memoir; this is how memory operates, loosely, associatively, inconsistently. The subtle shades of retelling perhaps create a more adequate approximation of \"truth\" than a single, presumably straightforward presentation could. In the summers and for the Christmas and Easter holidays Jaroslav often traveled to the nearby town of Kralupy, the birthplace of his mother (it is there that Seifert was buried upon his death on January 10,1986). In one sense it was not a significant change of scene for the boy from Zizkov as Kralupy then was already fairly industrialized and Seifert recalls the town's smelly brook and unsavory air. Due to its refineries, Kralupy in March 1945 became the target of heavy Allied bombing in a rare attack on Czechoslovak soil, then Nazi Germany's \"Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia.\" Seifert fondly remembers his maternal grandfather, who opened the boy's eyes to beauty on long nature walks and when planting trees with a local association devoted to decorative improvement of the town. Moreover, this grandfather shared the young Seifert's love of poetry and acquainted him with the works of 19th century Czech poets. The idyllic depiction of Seifert's childhood is never more pronounced than when he tells stories about his boyhood— for instance, his vicarious enjoyment of a R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner.

More often than not, he pressed his face onto the window glass of the delicatessen store and feasted his eyes and nostrils. Being poor, Seifert could only enjoy sweets on rare occasions. As to the deli, his mother shopped more cheaply across the street where the eyes of the sardines in an uncovered barrel strangely moved Jaroslav. To the little boy the exclusive store was an unapproachable place of worship, an exhibition, a piece of art. Without an inkling of bitterness, Seifert employs subtle humor based on hyperbole, highly believable though from the perspective of a deprived, curious youngster. The storekeeper, Mr. Kolman, \"recomposed\" his rare delicacies in the window daily. The boy traveled the world with the help of the artfully arranged foreign cheeses, fine wines, and delicate meats— very much as he had been enchanted, at a still younger age, by exotic foreign names and images in his small stamp collection. This deprivation and a gratification delayed until long into adulthood perhaps explain Seifert's reliance on the senses (when one perception, say, the visual or the olfactory, by necessity replaces the actual tasting and ingestion) and his later guiltless sybaritic indulgence in food and drink. And even in adulthood, Seifert frequently approached and experienced things second-hand, often only after prodding from his more cosmopolitan and sophisticated friends, who initiated him not only into the appreciation of fine food and wine, but more crucially, of course, into the world of modem art. It perhaps also attests to the simplicity and poverty of Seifert's youth that many seemingly normal adolescent pursuits were inaccessible to him before he reached adulthood, such as bicycling or swimming. Seifert's older friend, the renowned Czech novelist Vladislav Vancura,6 the first president of the leftist avant-garde group DevStsil, 6 It was Vancura, who wrote the brief but lofty foreword to Seifert's first book of verse C ity in Tears.

Amused, Seifert recounts how the lessons failed, and so did Vancura's attempt to teach Seifert to shoot an airgun. Similarly, the insistence of Seifert's friend, fellow Dev&sil member and avant-garde theoretician Karel Teige, that Seifert learn ballroom dancing, was doomed from the start— not solely because Seifert did not feel a natural inclination to such activities but perhaps because they were not an intrinsic part of his upbringing in contrast to the lives of his more middle-class or even patrician friends. Seifert simply writes that he was shy and could not afford a tuxedo (ABW 391). As far as formal schooling is concerned, Seifert fondly remembers his Zizkov gymnasium. Initially he was a good student, excelling in Latin, which he loved, and in religious education. His religion teacher invited Jaroslav to serve as an altar boy in the obligatory Sunday school services and Seifert ministered to his needs with great enthusiasm. Later, however, the student was disillusioned by the cold, unconvincing professionalism of the priest's daily routine, devoid of mystery and loftiness. His ardor waned in the face of dissimulation. But later Seifert did find the magic he was seeking, in the romantic long poem Maj [May] (1936). This work by Karel Hynek Macha, the foremost Czech romantic poet, was and still is immensely popular. It was reprinted in about 200 editions. In it Macha used to the full the musical potentialities of the Czech language and the work inspired many poets (Mestan 59). It certainly fascinated Seifert. So, it seems, Seifert was early attracted to the magic and truthfulness of words. Seifert never seemed to have had any doubts that poetry was his calling. From the time he entered school, Jaroslav declared he would be a poet, despite the laughter from fellow students (ABW 71). Later, when asked about his life plans, he matter-of- R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner.

While still in school, Seifert befriended two other Zizkov youths, Ivan Suk and Frantisek Nemec, who shared his love of poetry; the three tried to write first verse together; all three published poetry. Indeed, in 1921 Seifert was to be the last of the trio to see his first collection in print. After getting an early start with Neumann's help, the Zizkov three went their separate ways. But even as his apprenticeship in poetry developed, Seifert's success in school declined. WTien Jaroslav's grades began to slip in ninth grade, Suk suggested to him they alter the final grade report. This small deception went undetected and boosted the friendship of the two conspirators. In tenth grade Seifert gave up hope for improvement. His friend Nemec, threatened with failure, concocted a suicide attempt scheme, in which Seifert was implicated. Ultimately the school expelled him. It is evident that the budding poet had tired of his formal education. As their interest in schooling faded, the three began visiting the library of the Worker's Academy in the social democratic Lidovy dum [People's House], where they read \"everything we got our hands on,\" but most of all poetry (A B W 254). There they formed a circle called \"Association of 'Non-National' Students,\" but their ideological orientation was eclectic and vague. Organized in social democracy, then the left-most party, they flirted with anarchism, in 1919 most prominently represented by the poet S. K. Neumann (\"our literary and political God,\" A BW 378), whom they venerated from afar in the hope of making the acquaintance of Neumann. Seifert and his friends spent time at the famous Cafe Union, an anarchist meeting place. However, the youthful group of anarchists quickly dissolved after an unsuccessful assassination attempt against the Czechoslovak Prime Minister Kram&r, a lone act committed by one of its young radical anarchist members.

Seifert came of age in a time of political turmoil and was subject to several diverse influences which eventually shaped his political orientation. The first Czechoslovak republic formed in 1918 and only two years later saw strikes which masked an unsuccessful communist coup attempt. However, the imposing figure of the popular first president, Tom&s Garrigue Masaryk (1918-1935), guaranteed a high degree of continuity and stability, even after the world economic crisis in 1929. The new republic's constitution was centralist like its French model, and France was also its most important political ally. Nevertheless, even this democratic government struggled with labor unrest and social upheaval, partly fueled by communist forces; the government resorted to censorship against the radical press. In 1920 the social democratic party split into a moderate, democratic faction and a radical Bolshevik wing. The latter adhered to the idea of a class struggle modeling itself after the Soviets and in 1921 officially became the Communist Party with its own newspaper, Rude pravo, to which Seifert frequently contributed throughout the 1920s. The 1917 October Revolution and glowing first accounts of the sweeping changes in Russia energized leftist-leaning intellectuals. Revolutionary poetry by Alexander Blok and Vladimir Mayakovsky appeared in print (Seifert himself translated Blok's long poem The Twelve with the help of Roman Jakobson). But there were other, even more important, influences. Around 1920 the Czech avant-garde, led by its chief theoretician Karel Teige, began to discover Guillaume Apollinaire; and in 1920 the playwright, novelist and critic Karel Capek published his brilliantly translated anthology of modem French poets Trancouzskd poezie nove doby. R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without perm ission. 23 Both events had a profound effect on the development of the new Czech poetry, so did recent developments in the fine arts: cubism, futurism, dadaism as well as the naive paintings of the Duanier Henri Rousseau. Seifert recalls the important impact upon him of Apollinaire's poetry, how struck he was by Zone and Alcools (A B W 289). The eminent Czech literary critic and writer F. X. Saida encouraged Seifert to explore older French poets, and particularly to try his hand at translating Verlaine, which Seifert did most extensively between 1929 and 1933. This other sphere of influence was important: The native Czech poets of the previous poetic generation of the late 19th century as well as literary peers with whom Seifert was closely associated. At the outset, during the early twenties, he was strongly under the sway of S. K. Neumann and the program of the so-called proletarian poetry but gravitated later more towards Karel Teige and his \"poetist\" conception of modem art. It is a decade that in Seifert's recollection seems an endless stream of daily meetings and heated debates about art, literature and politics in Prague's many literary cafes and wine bars. Some of his friends wrote, translated, composed at cafes, had \"their\" tables there and could be found in their favorite establishments day in, day out. S. K. Neumann, who attracted a large following among young writers and artists, always liked Seifert best among them (Pesat, Seifert 21). Seifert reciprocated with almost naive, touching veneration. In his home he kept a framed reproduction of Neumann's photograph, with a picture of the Virgin Mary underneath it {AEW 279). He dedicated his first collection of poetry, City in Tears (1921), to Neumann. The two collaborated on several publications as editors. At the same time, Seifert's creative imagination soon began to chafe under Neumann's categorical insistence that Seifert adhere to the programmatic directives of \"proletarian art\": advancing social revolution, attacking the injustice of the capitalist system, becoming a voice of the working masses R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without perm ission. 24 and generally \"shocking the bourgeois\" (who reacted tamely and quite fearlessly, as Seifert remembers). Neumann, although he introduced the two men, disliked Seifert's intensifying friendship with Teige and his attendant drift towards \"poetism,\" the artistic program that Teige conceived after transforming and repudiating the idea of proletarian art. Karel Teige, only a year older than Seifert, was instrumental to the poet's early development and Seifert repeats on several occasions how much he admired his erudition and liked his personality. Seifert credits Teige with domesticating Apollinaire's poetry in Prague, after Capek had \"invited\" the French poet there by bringing him to Czech readers in his famous translations. Seifert suggests that the immensely rich crop of poets and writers of his time should rightly be called \"Teige's generation\" to acknowledge the impact of Teige, now largely unjustly forgotten. The two saw each other almost daily, either in Teige's large home library where also the first Dev&tsil meetings were held, or in one of the many cafes they frequented. It was Teige, Seifert says, who opened the world of art for him, particularly in the light of the poet's insufficient proficiency in foreign tongues {ABW 151,446). Teige apparently taught him to love and appreciate poetry as well as the fine arts. Teige was a graphic designer and studied art history. He wrote authoritative essays on art, literature, film, architecture, among other things. His command of French was excellent and he knew a great deal of modem poetry by heart. Seifert reminisces how he first heard Apollinaire's \"Sous le pont Mirabeau\" and Verlaine's poetry recited by Teige in the original the day they met. It was also Teige who took him on Seifert's first trip to Italy and France in 1923 to familiarize the poet with modem art as he rigorously defined it. At this same period in the early 1920s, Seifert began his long professional journalistic career, although he remained primarily passionate about literature and R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without perm ission. p o etry After joining Rude pravo for a short while in 1921 and following a brief stint in the Moravian town of Brno, where he worked as an editor in the communist paper Rovnost, Seifert returned to Prague only a few months later. From 1922 until 1929 he worked for the Communist bookstore and publishing house and, concurrently, until 1925, was the chief editor of the scathingly satirical weekly SrSatec. Between 1927 and 1929 he took over Neumann's post and ran Reflektor, a communist biweekly magazine. He wrote reviews and reports of plays, books, films, lectures. Generally speaking, Seifert's development in the 1920s ranges from youthful experimentation and the naive absorption of several crucial influences, to his formation, late in the decade, of a style that was entirely an individualistic expression of his own personality. Of course for most of the 1920s he was working for communist party publications. This finding of his own voice, perhaps not surprisingly, coincided with his expulsion from the communist party and his breaking with the avant-garde artistic circle Dev&sil in 1929. The artistic association Devittsil initially arose from Teige's programmatic theses in late 1920 which then were entirely identical with proletarian art but later evolved into a uniquely Czech modernist movement, poetism. DevStsil increasingly began to unite artists on ideological grounds, most prominently communists, and its membership fluctuated strongly (Pesat, Seifert 17). As the decade progressed, the organization turned dogmatic, Stalinist, thus outliving its creative significance for Seifert and the Czech cultural landscape {ABW 445). DevStsil (literally \"nine-power\") is the Czech name for butterbur, the \"mysterious and singular medicinal herb which in its name bears the magical number nine\" and thus was chosen by the founding members who happened to be nine, among them two painters and two architects. The herb itself R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without perm ission. 26 the artists had discovered in a recent book by the brothers Josef and Karel Capek (ABW 152)7 Poetism, the denial of established art and celebration of everyday objects or popular entertainment— like the circus, film, and dance halls— was not a traditional artistic program but was meant as a way of perceiving the world that was to become poetry itself. It was to be the art of life, the ability to live and enjoy. Seifert recalls his Paris trip with Teige in 1923, and Teige's unbending orthodoxy, when the poet was forced to sneak into the Louvre secretly because Teige respected nothing but ultra modem art and what he perceived as its immediate precursors. Modem art, to Teige, was conceived in the circus, on the cinema screen or the brightly illuminated boulevards with their neon signs. The Louvre Teige passed with disdain, but waxworks, galleries selling contemporary paintings, the Folies Bergeres, jazz bands, cafes, and music halls were a must. Similarly, Charlie Chaplin became a cult figure. The new modem art ceased to be art— this was the motto, coined by Ilya Ehrenburg, which the poetists adopted. Characteristic for poetism was its playfulness and unfettered creativity, stressing emotion and imagination over logic. This was accompanied by formal looseness, that is, casual, irregular rhyme patterns, slant rhymes, colloquialism, word play. In his second collection of poetry, Sheer Love (1923), Seifert not only reflected elements of this artistic conception, but in turn apparently influenced Teige's poetist theses (Pesat, Seifert 48-49). Poetism, therefore, was essentially congenial to Seifert's ^The accounts of how Dev&tsil got its name vary, so do explanations of the symbolism of this particular wildflower. Drews assumes that it was chosen partly because the butterbur is among the first plants to blossom in the spring (85). Petasites officinalis apparently is a malodorous herbaceous plant, whose blossoms sprout before its leaves do (Brousek 57).

The poet's sympathy for the suffering of the poor never diminished, but his vision was more differentiated than stem propagandists insistence on class struggle in proletarian poetry would allow. His unpretentious proletarianism was innate, not acquired and to an extent shaped his life- vision. Poetism, as Teige conceived it, attracted many new members to Dev&sil and shaped Czech poetry in the mid-twenties. The new program's task was to extol and to encompass \"all the beauties of the world,\" as the final poem in the collection Sheer Love suggests in title and content. It is interesting that Seifert chose this very title for his memoir, thus nostalgically returning to the time of his youthful experimentation. Seifert's third collection, On the Waves ofTSF (1925), is entirely in the poetist vein. It is the quintessential expression of the movement, the most consistent application of \"poetry as play\" (Pesat, Seifert 61), although this does not mean that it wholly disregards serious themes. The playful element is evident even in the book's flippant dedication to Seifert's poetist friends. More importantly, it is expressed in Teige's original typography. Almost every poem is set in different fonts, in varying sizes. This graphic layout underscores the whimsical nature of many poems; so does the poet's attempt simultaneously to contain the fascinating phenomena of the modem world as he witnessed it on his recent trip to France. It is also a tribute to Apollinaire and to modern poetry. The unconventional graphics are part of a provocative, irreverent gesture that culminates in printing the brand name of condoms \"Ollagum\" next to the poem \"Nightlights.\" In late 1926, however, Seifert published The Nightingale Sings Poorly, which on the one hand continues and even perfects semantic play, but more strongly than On the Waves ofTSF already rings a different, a more wistful tone. Seifert excels at associative word combinations that, like his previous book, rely heavily on the resources of the R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner.

Several poems at the end of the collection reflect Seifert's recent trip to the Soviet Union (1925), which he undertook as part of an official delegation, with Teige and other writers and intellectuals, for the \"Society for economic and cultural friendship with the New Russia.\" Seifert's response to this journey seems mixed. His verse suggests that he was not oblivious to the turmoil and violence in post-revolutionary Russia— in contrast to his early revolutionary zeal. In his memoirs there is no mention of this visit. In January 1928, after several years of acquaintance and romantic involvement, Seifert married Marie Ulrychova from Jicin, a town which figures so prominently in Sheer Love. A year later a rare prose publication Hvfody nad Rajskou zahradou [The Stars Above Paradise] appeared, consisting of autobiographical pieces that humorously look back at the author's childhood, coming-of-age, and artistic affiliations during the 1920s. Seifert's retrospective orientation signals the beginning of a new phase. The year 1929 marked a turning point for Seifert. Most critics, foremost among them Zdenek Pesat, agree that the collection Carrier Pigeon manifests a transition of poetics that foreshadows Seifert's mature work of the 1930s. The poet still has not become introspective and maintains his preoccupation with external sensory details, but the collection initiates a trend toward internalization and intimacy (Pesat, Seifert 77). His political disillusionment is evident; revolutionary fervor is replaced by skepticism. The same year Seifert, along with six other writers, signed a letter of protest against the policies of the new pro-Stalinist party leadership under Klement Gottwald and was subsequently expelled from the Czechoslovak Communist Party. This also meant that professionally he was barred from its party press. His friends Teige, the great poets Vitezslav Nezval, and Frantisek Halas among others, published a counter­ declaration, thus taking a radically opposed, confrontational stand to Seifert. It was a R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without perm ission. 29 divisive break. Soon thereafter Seifert's fellow Dev$tsil member, the critic and journalist Julius Fucik, successfully voted to have Seifert also removed from this once artistic but now increasingly dogmatic, communist group (cf. A B W 445).® Similarly, Seifert's affiliation since October 1929 with the artistic group Leva fronta [Left Front], that promised loosely to unite leftist intellectuals, was short-lived. As became evident in the 1950s, the communist party would not forgive Seifert's deviations, especially since he always stood by his decision and yet never ceased to adhere to moderately leftist, social democratic ideas. During the thirties he often entered into polemic battles with the radical left, mainly with Julius Fucik. Looking back, Seifert writes that neither the break with communism nor with Dev&sil upset him much, because he felt that the artistic association had outlasted its purpose. But he deeply regretted the estrangement from Teige. They both tried to keep up their friendship, but saw increasingly less of each other. In the thirties Teige and Nezval imported surrealism to Prague, maintaining intense contacts with its French proponents, but Seifert did not participate in this development (A B W 446). Surrealism did not interest him (AWB 415). Until 1949, when he devoted himself exclusively to writing poetry, he continued working as an editor of literary and cultural columns predominantly in the social democratic and labor union press and brought out five ®The accounts vary when it comes to the details surrounding this major shake-up in the ranks of DevStsil. As opposed to the version remembered by Seifert, Vitezslav Nezval recalls that it was in fact Fucik, who took the side of the absent Seifert when the expulsion was discussed. Looking back, Nezval is understanding of the poet's search for individuality and artistic independence: \"We lost Seifert. In many respects he liberated himself from what were sectarian rituals after all because the 'terror of avant-gardism' ceased to hold sway over him. His own voice was coming to the fore under different layers and Seifert was seeking to establish his own tradition\" (Seifert, JeStgjednoujaro 133). According to Effenberger, Seifert and his fellow writers were not expelled but left on their own after formulating their manifesto directed against the new leadership of the communist party (610). Pesat describes the event as expulsion (Seifert 104). R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner.

In the early 1930s Seifert's poetry turned inward and centered on the motifs of death and the passage of time but also incorporated images from the Czech landscape and the beauty of Prague. His poetry became more traditional or perhaps even \"neo- classicist\" (Mestan 223) in the sense that it exhibits concrete imagery rather than surrealism or ideological abstraction, and thrives on intense sensory experience. All this is conveyed in a form that has grown symmetrical. Rhyme patterns and metric schemes become regular, the metaphors less sweeping, the stanzas parallel and the melody less syncopated but smooth. Pesat points out that this development coincided with Seifert's intense translating of Verlaine's poetry (Seifert 92) ? Another influential element that he sees is Seifert's very own expression of \"poesie pure\" (93) in contrast to his previous work that embraced social revolution. In the face of deepening economic crisis, along with the rise of nationalism and fascism, the poets in the early 1930s seemed overcome with skepticism and disillusionment when it came to radical societal change. However, Seifert found an outlet not only in his journalism but also in occasional verse that he published regularly in daily newspapers. Occasional verse increasingly became his means of dealing with the dilemma of poetry and action. He wrote a moving and well-received series of poems to commemorate the death of Tomds G. Masaryk, the nation's charismatic first president, who died in 1937. A year earlier he assumed a critical stance in his book of satirical verse Zpivdno do rotadcy [Sung into the Rotary Press] against the overblown official celebrations of the centennial anniversary of Karel Hynek Macha's death. He ^It is not Seifert's first exposure to Verlaine's verse but probably his most intensive as he translated between 20-25 of Verlaine's best-known poems in order to publish a selection of about forty pieces.

Concurrently, his book of poetry Ruce VenuSiny [The Hands of Venus], which won Seifert a national prize, was suffused with Macha's spirit, celebrating the quiet heroism of endurance and human striving (Pesat, Seifert 94). His journalistic pieces consistently pinpointed social injustice and the abysmal differences between the haves and the havenots. With the very real threat of fascism and war looming, Seifert looked back upon his earlier poetist and proletarian verse as romantic \"boisterous revolutionary talk responding to a reality that in comparison to today resembled a bucolic idyll\" (Pesat, Seifert 109-110). The poet not only denounced fascism when the Spanish civil war broke out and co-edited an anthology in support of the Spanish democracy (Pesat, Seifert 118) but used his considerable clout to respond both in journalistic prose and in his verse to the contemporary crisis: the Moscow trials, fascist Italy's war in Abyssinia, the expansionist tendencies of Nazi Germany, among others (Pesat, Seifert 127).10 In 1938 Czechoslovakia fell victim to Hitler's aggression. France, Czechoslovakia's ally, along with Great Britain, succumbed to Germany's pressure and ceded the Sudetenland, mainly inhabited by the German minority, to the Nazis. The infamous Munich Treaty failed to secure peace in Europe and to stop Hitler's expansion. Rather, it paved the way for Germany's incorporation of the remaining Czech lands into the Reich as the so-called \"Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia\" in March 1939. Slovakia became a puppet state dominated by Germany. Seifert responded to the threat to Czech political and cultural sovereignty in his rousing collection l^The Soviet show trials in 1936-37 divided the European left, but Seifert was unequivocal in his opposition to the Stalinist purges. He wrote three poems that he published in the social-democratic daily Pravo lidu to protest the brutal sentences against Lenin's politburo and the protagonists of the October Revolution (\"Jaroslav Seifert v PrAvu lidu o moskevskych procesech 1936-37\" 6). R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without perm ission. Zhasn&e svStla [Put Out the Lights], published in late 1938, again to considerable acclaim and readership. The poet took up the responsibility to act as a spokesman of his people, particularly in times of imminent danger to nationhood. The collection, much like Seifert's wartime verse, invokes Czech history and cultural icons to remind the readers of past resilience and overcoming of national catastrophes. The native land is eroticized in a deeply-felt lyrical tone. With this sincere, natural and intimate expression of what the Czech people felt and needed Seifert truly assumed the task he had cherished since flirting, in his first collection of poetry, with the role of the revolutionary bard, who would lead the masses on the barricades. The hope for survival and the search for solace motivated Seifert's thematic turn to the nation's past and to \"eternal verities\" during the war years. He commemorated the immensely popular Czech novelist Bozena Nemcova— whose Babiika [The Grandmother] has become a classic printed in about 350 editions since 1855 (Mestan 78). In a 1940 collection, SvStlem odSnd [Clad in Light], similarly, the central theme is the city of Prague and its glorious past, tied to the poet's autobiographical reminiscences. Seifert clearly identifies himself as the poet of Prague; to the city he clings intimately, for it provides him the consolation he seeks in this time of crisis. In his representation of the city he arrives at a fundamental affirmation of life in all its natural manifestations. Likewise, in Kantenmj most [The Bridge, of Stone] (1944) Prague is the setting for personal reminiscences, simple pleasures like the coming of spring, and feminine beauty. All this is not a sign of escapism, but an attempt at finding, on native grounds, adequate symbols, as the only possible means of reaching an audience, contributing a semblance of resistance despite wartime censorship, and allowing people to read between the lines— a skill the Czechs have repeatedly been forced to learn in the course of their modem history.

Seifert's basic \"heliotropic\" disposition and tonality parallel Mozart's, as George Gibian rightly points out (11) and as Seifert himself amply attests in his memoir. The gentle criticism raised by his poet friend Frantisek Halas against The Bridge of Stone is telling: Halas liked the collection but did not think poetry should sound \"sweet and alluring\" in times like World War II: \"Nowadays poetry should howl like autumn wind, bark like dogs let loose and shriek like birds of prey.\" Seifert agrees with Halas but adds that he was unable to do so: \"I love Mozart and I wanted to believe that the song of the flute can open the gates to the cathedral of Wisdom\" (A B W 72). This is why Seifert did not share Nezval's obsession with the occult. And this also accounts for Seifert's reaction when a fellow poet once gave him an exotic bottle containing curare: Without a moment's hesitation he flushed the poison down the toilet (A B W 51). This sensibility, so atypical in the 20th century, survived despite the several national and personal crises Seifert witnessed in his lifetime and it coexisted with his lifelong commitment to social causes. A crucial moment that sheds light on the poet's attitudes is his brush with death during the final days of World War II when the Czechs, expecting Allied forces to arrive shortly in Prague, rose against their German occupiers on May 5,1945. Unfortunately, it took the Soviet Army five more days to reach Prague, while American forces nearby were ordered not to advance towards the capital; therefore, many ordinary Czech citizens died during the brief uprising. During this time Seifert was once again at Lidovy dum, clandestinely preparing a new post­ liberation daily newspaper with a few of his editor colleagues. German soldiers pursuing fleeing Czech fighters who hid at Lidovy dum entered the offices, arrested Seifert along with the editorial staff, and marched the men across town to a barracks wall in Karlin, where they were expecting to be shot. For a long anxious moment they were simply left standing at the wall— until at last they were exchanged for German R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner.

In his memoir Seifert remembers Dostoyevski's masterful, calm narration of his execution that was reversed at the last minute. Seifert's own narration of his excruciating moment is characterized by unheroic simplicity and attention to evocative details. During the march he recalls his childhood, sweet smells and how he used to walk hand in hand with his girlfriends. He shares a last stale piece of bread and cheese with a fellow captive, notices people hiding behind curtains, wonders what they are having for lunch and remembers a drawing of a nude woman on a toilet wall in his youth. That he does not think of death he asks the reader not to consider courage or heroism. He simply did not reckon with death although it was near (ABW 263). The collection Prilba hliny [A Helmetful of Earth] (1945) lyrically celebrates new­ found freedom and the liberation of Prague by the Soviet Army, which coincided with the arrival of spring, the time of renewal and rebirth. After the war, Seifert again took up journalism. Until 1949 he worked for the labor union daily Prace and edited a series of poetry publications. As before World War II, he wrote commentaries and small feature articles responding to the political and cultural situation, and he published occasional verse commemorating anniversaries, the passing of public figures, or celebrating his literary friends. These poetic memorials were collected in Ruka a plamen [The Hand and the Flame] (1948). Both of the next two collections are collaborations between Seifert and a popular Czech painter, in which the poems were written to accompany the pictures. Humoristic elements as well as folklore, natural beauty, and the changing of the seasons converge in a child-like vision that complements the two well-known illustrators of children's books. Seifert also writes a fairy tale Koulelo se koulelo [It Rolled and Rolled] and returns to the world of the late-romantic and early- R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner.

The reasons both for Seifert's excursion into children's literature and for his return to a theme adapted from Nemcovd's The Grandmother are tied to another momentous political change. This latest work brings into focus the rigid political and artistic norms of \"socialist realism\" established after the communist coup in 1948 which imposed a brutal Stalinist dictatorship on the country. Paradoxically, the communist critics denounced Song About Victoria on terms that could not, in fact, be more removed from the truth in their assessment of Seifert. One Stalinist era critic blamed the poet for his \"estrangement from the people\" because he chose a protagonist who pays for her passionate nature with insanity and death (she is struck by lightning). Moreover, the critic detected nihilism and pessimism in Seifert and indicted him for \"using poetry against the people, to mock everything that our working people hold dear\" (Hejl 101). Communist critics also blamed Seifert for escapism and for \"Catholic mysticism\"— a development that they presumably already detected long before Seifert broke with the communist party in 1929 (Hejl 100). So, during the communist period, Seifert's earlier break with communism returned to haunt him. It is evident that the criticism had little to do with artistic merit. Pesat points out that Maminka [The Mother], that appeared only a few years later and even received a national prize, was similar in nature and poetics to the earlier work that had drawn such vicious attacks (180). The book is markedly different from the servile poetry of the time. It is an homage not solely to Seifert's own mother but to motherhood as a whole, to positive human values and the home. Unlike his colleague Nezval and other artists after the war, especially following the communist coup in 1948, Seifert chose not to become a propagandistic tool of the Stalinists. In addition, he did not keep his contempt R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without perm ission. 36 for such poetry to himself. In 1948 he and poet Vladimir Holan were heard in a bar comparing contemporary French and Soviet poetry, very much to the detriment of the latter. Only an intervention on his behalf by Frantisek Halas and a forced apology saved Seifert from an internal inquiry by the national writers association and perhaps even from imprisonment. Seifert's private correspondence with critic and friend Bohumil Polan offers a few rare glimpses of the writer's frustrations and tribulations at the time while his memoir mentions this bleak period only sparingly. The letters also show the extent to which the author's health was beginning to fail. Seifert was repeatedly hospitalized during the 1950s and the 1960s with various ailments that impaired his ability to walk. In a letter dated March 30,1950 and written at the spa Jesenik the poet addresses the recent controversy surrounding his book: \"Victoria was censored in several places, so that the idea, modest by the way and not directed at anything— is lost. I thought of Victoria's bolt of lightning and of slow time that so quickly killed Nemcov^. Even that is gone.\" He continues, \"I have never been very ambitious, even less so today. After all, an earwig underneath a stone does not have to be a coward.\" Much later, on March 13,1961, in a letter where he complains about illness and pain, Seifert explains his motivation for writing children's poetry earlier: \"I wrote verse for children because I could not write for adults. By the way, if you look closely, it is verse for grown-up readers.\" He claims that he does not know, understand or appreciate children's literature, or its problems and goes on to say that he likes children, but dislikes teachers and editors of children's magazines and ends on a dark note: \"All that this has gotten me, as you know, is only that I am considered 'the poet who wrote Mother.' But this does not upset me anymore because I view many things from the lofty height of utter indifference and quite often I am looking forward to my R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner.

Quite the contrary.\" A little later that year, on July 15,1961, Seifert with unwonted sharpness condemns It Rolled and Rolled: \"Those worthless verses I only wrote because I was forced to do it and I am very sorry for them. [...] But they were published and now they are even preparing a new edition and there I must acknowledge them though I don't want to.\" Seifert's human decency and courage came to the fore during the period of de- Stalinization in 1956 at the 2nd Writers Congress. He was the only one to come out in support of imprisoned and silenced colleagues and to demand their rehabilitation (Hejl 100). In his speech he stressed honesty thus echoing his early classical idea of the poet as Aristotelian truth-giver and maker: \"When anyone else keeps the truth to himself, it can be a tactical maneuver. If the writer keeps the truth to himself, he is lying.\" He went on to say: \"It is wonderful if poets are prodding politicians, but I dare say that it is less wonderful when it is die other way around\" (Pesat, Seifert 188). In another letter he thanks Polan for continued friendship and support \"in the time in which we are living. In this time of lies, whose atmosphere is sometimes unbearable to breathe\" (Letter Nov. 26,1959). The poetry Seifert produced while hampered by illness is marked by contemplation of the ephemeral nature of life, the fleetingness of time and the need for love. Seifert is preoccupied with these themes in his memoir where he says about life: \"Sometimes it seems to me that it passed like shivers down my spine\" (ABW308). Koncert na ostrovS [Concert on an Island] (1965), like the collection Praha [Prague] (1964), which is thematically tied to the poet's many preceding poems about his native city, marks an important change in form. Seifert abandons the melodic, song-like character of his poetry, dispenses with rhyme, adopts a natural conversational tone and opts for directness of expression rather than imagery.

Before the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia on August 21,1968 crushed hopes for reform and a \"socialism with a human face,\" Seifert published two collections of poetry in quick succession: Halleyova kometa [Hailey's Comet] and Odlevdnizvonu [The Casting of Bells] (1967). Both are characterized by diction that is increasingly prose-like; thematically, erotic love and femininity return, so does confessional and contemplative verse as well as reminiscences. The invasion and subsequent military occupation of Czechoslovakia cut short the time Seifert could devote to his next collection Morovy sloup [The Plague Column]. Seifert thought of this book as his last and conceived it to a great extent as a parting gesture. Love, aging and death are central themes, so is poetic stock-taking at the end of a long, rich, difficult life. During this new national crisis Seifert again did not hesitate to take on the responsibility that followed from his standing as \"the conscience of the nation.\" He was elected chairman of the Czech Writers Association at its 1968 congress and led a task force in the national writers association (that included both Czech and Slovak writers), formed to rehabilitate authors persecuted under the previous communist regime. Milan Kundera remembers Seifert's authority and unbending stance: I keep seeing him before me. He walked with difficulty, on crutches. And perhaps due to the illness, when he was sitting, he seemed like a rock: immovable, solid, firm. We felt relief, when he was with us. What justification of existence can a small doomed nation give? The justification was here: the poet, square-shouldered, crutches leaning against the table, the tangible proof of the genius of the nation, the only glory of the powerless. (53) The few letters to Polan during this trying time describe the frenzied pace at which the 67-year-old Seifert exercised his much-needed leadership role: \"I am R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without perm ission. 39 staggering through the world— from my bed to the [Writers] Association and back. They burdened me with a lot of things; it would be too much for a healthy man\" (Letter Mar. 23,1969). A year later, shortly before a new hard-line association replaced the one Seifert's was chairing: At first it was troublesome for me. I don't know the political game well enough. I also lack political eloquence. But the worst was that I had to hobble to those high places with the utmost exertion and pain. And I had also sharpened my quill for a few last verses, which I can't get to. Not that I don't have the time. But it is weighing me down like a stone. (Letter June 26,1970) Until his death in 1986, Seifert was barred from this organization. His collection The Plague Column, circulated in samizdat typescripts, first appeared in an exile edition in Germany (1977) and was later published in Czechoslovakia (1981). The new hard­ line regime was often at a loss how to deal with the poet, whose authority in his homeland as well as abroad increased rather than lessened, even through the years that his new works would not be published— except for DeStnik z Piccadilly [An Umbrella from Piccadilly] (1979), which had been copied and circulated since 1978, but about which critics were not allowed to write. In the collection Seifert maintained his inner autonomy and continued in the vein of his contemplative, reminiscing verse acknowledging the inevitable proximity of love and death and anticipating the latter almost longingly. Seifert's popularity, moral authority, and international acclaim among literary insiders granted him a certain immunity to intervene on behalf of human rights causes; most importantly the signing of Charter 77 in 1977. The 1984 Nobel Prize for literature embarrassed a regime that would have preferred to ignore the international attention the award caused. Seifert's last collection Byti bdsnikem [To Be a Poet] (1983) continued the confessional character of the previous book and exuded a calm, resigned attitude toward life and impending death. For a last time the poet again celebrated the city of R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without perm ission. 40 Prague. On January 10,1986 he died and was buried in Kralupy. His funeral drew large crowds of mourners (and consequently the attention of the police). In his congratulatory letter, dated October 11,1984, on the occasion of the Nobel Prize award to Seifert, Vaclav Havel succinctly formulates the reasons why the poet has long deserved this honor: Not only because your poetic work has long... become common property, that is, everyone who is the least bit interested in literature got it under his skin, so to say; not only because you have long been something of a living symbol of the continuity in modern Czech literature; but also because with your moral stance—unpretentious and all the more lasting—you embody the best tradition of a responsible civic stance of a writer in this country. (104) Despite the many turbulences in his life, some aspects of the poet's sensibility and life remained remarkably constant: His deep, natural rootedness in his proletarian origins; his ability to address universally shared human experience, like love and death, in an accessible, yet profoundly relevant manner; his simple appetites and reliance on the senses; and his lifelong ties to the place of his birth, to Prague, to Czechoslovakia— devoid of pathos or fanatical nationalism. Finally, Seifert himself tells us who he was in a poem that ends with a tribute to his wife of many years: AUTOBIOGRAPHY Sometimes when talking about herself, mother would say: My life was sad and hushed, I walked on tiptoe. But when I became mad and stomped a bit, on the shelf mom's cups would lightly ring and I had to smile. I'm told that the moment I was bom, a butterfly flew in through the window and sat on mother's bedstead, but a dog howled in the yard as well. Mother thought this was an ominous sign.

But when into the present days I gaze wistfully as if into empty frames and a dusty wall is all I see, it was marvelously exquisite. I cannot forget many moments, which were like bright blossoms of all possible colors and hues, while evenings filled with perfumes resembled blue grapes concealed in the leaves of darkness. Passionately I read verse and loved music and wandered, ever surprised, from beauty to beauty. Yet when for the first time I beheld a naked woman's image, I began to trust in wonders. My life has passed by swiftly. It was much too short for my long yearnings, which were endless. Before I knew it, life's end had drawn near. Death will soon kick ajar my door and enter. Terrified and shocked then I will hold my breath and to breathe just forget. May it not be denied me still in time to kiss the hands of the one, who patiently with my steps walked and walked on and on and loved most of all.

Native Influences It is perhaps fair to say for the sake of simplification that Seifert's sensibility in the 1920s shifts somewhat from predominantly native and (indirectly) revolutionary Russian influences (very pronounced in the first collection City in Tears but less so in Sheer Love), to a more cosmopolitan, exotic, international world view, dominated by French themes, in On the Waves ofTSF. Seifert's fourth collection The Nightingale Sings Poorly is both a culmination of his poetist work of the 1920s and a crossroads to the more intimate, introspective poetry of the 1930s. This change reflects Seifert's orientation away from the dictates of propaganda and engage proletarian art represented by S. K. Neumann and by the artistic association DevStsil until 1922, towards poetism, an aesthetic program of poetic play arising from life in the machine age and its popular culture, as programmatically defined by Karel Teige. This development likewise parallels Seifert's coming of age both as a man and an artist, his evolution towards more independence from his mentors, and, the first-hand insights gathered from his trips to Italy and France (1923) and the Soviet Union (1925). The evolution of Seifert's \"proletarian\" sensibility would have been impossible without the presence in him of a strong \"folk element,\" the influence of his mother's Catholicism, his strong roots in the working-class milieu of Prague-Zizkov, and the impression upon him of the native Czech literature that he read. It is apparent in his memoir that Seifert truly revered several writers, many of whom he was to know personally. Foremost among them in that first phase of the 1920s was S. K. Neumann, his mentor, critic and fatherly friend, w ho— as Seifert acknowledges— was the first to discover in his own verse the squalid Zizkov as subject matter for modern poetry (ABW 197). To Neumann, who was instrumental in getting Seifert published, the young poet R eproduced with perm ission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without perm ission. 43 dedicated his first collection of poetry. Neumann's poetry and poetics underwent many transformations, most importantly perhaps from Bergsonian vitalism and the pragmatism of the so-called \"Generation of 1914,\" to which he belonged, to proletarian poetry of the early 1920s. This heterogeneous group of authors that published the influential Almanac far the year 1914, was dominated by the brothers Josef and Karel Capek. The \"Generation of 1914\" is generally seen as the beginning of the Czech avant- garde. It embraced the philosophers William James and John Dewey, whom Karel Capek read in the original. The Capek b"
