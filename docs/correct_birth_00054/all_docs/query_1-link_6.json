        "text": "Czech tennis player. Born on October 2, 1968, in Brno, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic).\n\nTennis champion Jana Novotna was born in 1968 in Brno, Czech Republic. Her career began in 1986, she turned professional in 1987, and, by the time she announced her retirement after losing in the third round to Anke Huber at the U.S. Open in 1999, she had won 24 career singles, 72 doubles titles, and earned over $10 million. Novotna's long-sought victory at Wimbledon in 1998 helped her make the decision to bow out. \"I said throughout my career that winning one Grand Slam would be a dream come true for me. It finally did happen.\""
