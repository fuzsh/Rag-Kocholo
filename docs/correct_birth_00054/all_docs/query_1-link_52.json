        "text": "Wimbledon has again thrown up a surprise, with Barbora Krejcikova claiming the title with a three-set victory over Jasmine Paolini on Saturday.\n\nThe former French Open champion sealed a second Slam singles crown, with the 31st seed winning 6-2, 2-6, 6-4 against the world No 7.\n\nKrejcikova was not an expected winner but continues a strong Czech heritage at the All-England Club.\n\nWe look at the five Czech-born women to lift the singles title at Wimbledon.\n\nMartina Navratilova – 1978-79, 1982-87, 1990\n\nWhile Navratilova won her record nine Wimbledon titles as an American citizen, she was born and raised in Czechia – and was on Centre Court rooting for compatriot Krejcikova today.\n\nThe former world No 1 won her first singles major at SW19 in 1978, beating Chris Evert, before beating her great rival again in the 1979 final.\n\nShe won a record six straight titles from 1982 to 1987, and then picked up a ninth and final title in 1990, beating Zina Garrison in the final.\n\nJana Novotna – 1998\n\nKrejcikova’s mentor and long-term inspiration, the late, great Novotna’s triumph 26 years ago is one of the most memorable in Wimbledon history.\n\nNovotna was agonisingly close to winning the title in 1993 before crumbling against Steffi Graf in the final, before losing to Martina Hingis in 1997.\n\nHowever, it was third time lucky for her on Centre Court, beating Nathalie Tauziat in straight sets to finally claim the title that had previously eluded her.\n\nBarbora Krejcikova: 3 key factors behind Wimbledon victory over Jasmine Paolini\n\nWATCH: Barbora Krejcikova pays emotional tribute to Jana Novotna after she stuns Wimbledon favourite\n\nPetra Kvitova – 2011, 2014\n\nAt her peak, few can come close to Kvitova on grass courts, and it is no surprise that both her major triumphs have come at the All England Club.\n\nAfter reaching the last four as an unseeded player in 2010, Kvitova progressed to the final in 2011 and downed Maria Sharapova in straight sets to claim the first of her two crowns at the tournament.\n\nThree years later she was back in the final once again, and delivered one of the greatest displays in women’s singles finals history, dropping just three games to thrash Eugenie Bouchard and lift the Venus Rosewater Dish for a second time.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova – 2023\n\nOne of the most surprising champions ever, Vondrousova become the first ever unseeded woman to lift the title with her triumph a year ago.\n\nThe Czech had threatened on the big stage previously, reaching the French Open final in 2019 and winning Olympic silver in Tokyo, but had never done well at Wimbledon.\n\nHowever, after beating Jessica Pegula and Elina Svitolina, Vondrousova then defeated Ons Jabeur to claim her first major title on Centre Court.\n\nBarbora Krejcikova – 2024\n\nVondrousova was unable to defend her title, losing in round one, but Krejcikova has ensured the title remains in Czech hands for another year.\n\nThe 31st seed was unfancied coming into the tournament, but beat Danielle Collins and Jelena Ostapenko in back-to-back matches to reach the last four.\n\nThere, she stunned title favourite and former champion Elena Rybakina, before downing Paolini on Saturday."
