The aim of this study is to analyse the amount of PA in Czech university students' daily lives. The research on university students was conducted as part of nationwide research on PA in the adult population of the Czech Republic. A total of 906 students at eight selected universities were asked to participate in this study. The response rate was 79.5%. We analysed data from 641 university students: 318 male [mean age 21.63 Â± 1.73; mean Body Mass Index (BMI) 23.50 Â± 1.91] and 323 female (mean age 21.08 Â± 1.53; mean BMI 21.23 Â± 2.20). The students wore Yamax SW-701 pedometers continuously for seven days. With respect to BMI, the recommendation of 10,000 steps per day on an average day was met by 76% of men and 68% of women of normal weight, 67% of male students who were overweight or obese and 85% of female students who were overweight or obese. Of all monitored days, in both females and males, the number of steps taken on Sunday was significantly lower (p<0.0001) in comparison to other days of a week. No significant differences were found in the number of steps taken among students of normal weight, students who were overweight and students who were obese on any of the monitored days. The majority of Czech male university students are of normal weight. Only 9% of students meet the criterion of 10,000 steps every day. Approximately two-thirds of students meet the 10,000 steps daily criterion on four or more days per week. The lowest number of steps is taken on Sundays; this finding supports the need for intervention programmes to enhance PA on weekends.\n\nPhysical activity in the lifestyle of Czech university students: Meeting health recommendations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSigmundovÃ¡, Dagmar; ChmelÃ­k, FrantiÅ¡ek; Sigmund, Erik; FeltlovÃ¡, Dana; FrÃ¶mel, Karel\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe decline of physical activity (PA) in adults as well as children and youth is a worldwide phenomenon.

Corresponding mirror segments use substrates of flat silicon wafers which are coated with thin iridium films, as this material is promising high reflectivity in the X-ray range of interest. The sputtering parameters are optimized in the context of the expected reflectivity of the coated X-ray mirrors. In near future measurements of the assembled mirror modules optical performances are planned at an X-ray test facility.\n\n[The age of formation of Czech clinical medicine].\n\nPubMed\n\nSvÃ¡b, J\n\n2002-11-22\n\nEra of Emperor Francis Joseph I is said to be a golden age for the Czech nation. It can be found in numerous panegyric articles to any jubilee of the emperor's rule. What was formally dictated by respect brought by education and by the system of the Greek and Roman tradition adopted in Austria in Middle Ages, seams to be valid today as most of the contemporary technical and economical progress roots within those days. The Czech cultures namely music and art reached international acknowledgement. Though with difficulties, Czech achieved in education and in science as a full-fledged language. After the year 1848 an average citizen was entitled to such freedom as never before. Technical, economical and cultural progress enabled real ascent of the Czech society and its social differentiation. In sixties, after the Austria-Hungary Alignment, Hapsburg government undertook no serious restrains. Such development was nothing unusual. Similar one underwent after the period of storms all European societies from south to north and form west to east. They brought ideas of the French revolution and years 1848/1849 are therefore called \"the spring of European nations\". In all countries where revolutionary ideas were represented and various countermeasures were accepted, governments were forced to accept temporary arrangements (in Austrian monarchy it was the promise of constitution, language compromise etc.). Nevertheless, in the second half of the 19th century the most important condition for further revival was the long period of peace and stability of international relations. The internal stability of the Austrian monarchy was achieved for long time by the Austria-Hungary Alignment in 1867. After the lost battle at Hradec Kralove in summer 1866 it became clear that contemporary centralistic organization of the state, balancing between absolutism and constitutionalism is not further tenable. Years long pressure of patriotic forces in the parliament brought about division of the\n\nA joint university-government technical editing program\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nStohrer, Freda F.; Pinelli, Thomas E.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nThe NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) and Old Dominion University have designed a mutually useful technical editing program. A university team made up of an English instructor and two graduate students - one from English, one from engineering - works with a senior editor from LaRC to prepare technical reports for publication. A round-robin technique gives the university team editorial commentary from both language and technical specialists; the senior editor from LaRC supervises reports through final publication. To date, the system has provided LaRC with a respectable product and university students with valuable on-the-job training.\n\nHuman research ethics committees in technical universities.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoepsell, David; Brinkman, Willem-Paul; Pont, Sylvia\n\n2014-07-01\n\nHuman research ethics has developed in both theory and practice mostly from experiences in medical research. Human participants, however, are used in a much broader range of research than ethics committees oversee, including both basic and applied research at technical universities. Although mandated in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, non-medical research involving humans need not receive ethics review in much of Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Our survey of the top 50 technical universities in the world shows that, where not specifically mandated by law, most technical universities do not employ ethics committees to review human studies. As the domains of basic and applied sciences expand, ethics committees are increasingly needed to guide and oversee all such research regardless of legal requirements. We offer as examples, from our experience as an ethics committee in a major European technical university, ways in which such a committee provides needed services and can help ensure more ethical studies involving humans outside the standard medical context. We provide some arguments for creating such committees, and in our supplemental article, we provide specific examples of cases and concerns that may confront technical, engineering, and design research, as well as outline the general framework we have used in creating our committee.

SSS research was conducted with Cooperation from the Scientific and Technical Research (COST) program, with financial support from the Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports. This study is part of a project entitled the \"Health and Social Status of Immigrants and Asylum Seekers in the Czech Republic\" (registration number OC 10031), which was started in 2010 and concluded in May 2011. The study included 246 respondents of which: 69 (28.1%) had emigrated from Vietnam; 93 (37.8%) from the Ukraine; and 84 (34.1%) from Mongolia. In terms of qualitative strategies, 13 individual immigrants and asylum seekers were personally interviewed. This research was thus conceived as being both quantitative-qualitative, which included the use of the appropriate technical tools (i.e., questionnaires and interviews with select immigrants and asylum seekers). SSS was determined using the Pearson's chi-square test, as well as through correspondence and cluster analyzes. Sign schemes were used to detect select significant relationships in contingency tables. The minimum significance level chosen was Î± â¤ 0.05. When examining the SSS of select nationalities, differences were observed in the perception of subjective social status. The correspondence analysis results clearly show that Ukrainians best perceived their social status (within the selected parameters). One measure of subjectively perceived social status related to Czech language proficiency (i.e., one criterion was the comprehension of spoken Czech; e.g., whether the respondent could read or speak Czech, or how they assessed their own Czech proficiency). The SSS study clearly revealed typical links among select nationalities living in the Czech Republic, and highlighted risks related to the degree of integration (and its relationship to\n\nBenchmarking in Czech Higher Education: The Case of Schools of Economics\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPlacek, Michal; Ochrana, FrantiÅ¡ek; Pucek, Milan\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis article describes the use of benchmarking in universities in the Czech Republic and academics' experiences with it.

These institutions operate a distributed system of seismic, GPS, magnetic, gravimetric and geodynamic observatories. The operational and personal costs of CzechGeo/EPOS are mostly covered by the Ministry of education, sports and youth within the support of twelve large research infrastructures in the Czech Republic. Web pages of the project www.czechgeo.cz are being built as a data portal which should integrate all the data and services provided by the involved institutions and research infrastructures. Seismic portal offers selected portions of digital data from permanent, local and temporary seismic stations, locations of seismic events in the country and worldwide, daily seismograms from permanent observatories and local seismic network Webnet, seismic bulletins and catalogs, and macroseismic observations on the territory of the Czech Republic. Magnetic portal involves besides real-time magnetograms also recent state of geomagnetic activity and its forecast for the next day. GPS portal will provide preprocessed data from regional GPS stations. Building the national portal is closely related with the development of the Preparatory phase of the EPOS (European Plate Observing System) project.\n\nMonitoring of the Green Roofs Installation in Brno-City District, Czech Republic\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRebrova, Tatiana; Beckovsky, David; Selnik, Petr\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn spite of the rapidly growing interest to the green roofs, there is insufficient information about their local quantities and areas in Czech Republic as well as in Central Europe. There is a lack of technical information that leads to the further development, application and environmental contribution of green roofs under local climatic conditions. The purpose of the research is to follow the tendency of how the process of green roofsâ popularization is performed in the Czech Republic and to determine basic parameters of the installed green roofs. These parameters include total quantity, area and the most common roof vegetation type (extensive or intensive); how many green roofs were installed over the last years and as a result, how the proportion of the green roofs to the conventional ones is changing. For initial evaluation Brno-City District was chosen as the next stage of university environmental project EnviHUT following the genesis of green roofs under local weather conditions.\n\nPharmacy Practice and Education in the Czech Republic.\n\nPubMed\n\nNachtigal, Petr; Å imÅ¯nek, TomÃ¡Å¡; Atkinson, Jeffrey\n\n2017-10-09\n\nThe PHARMINE (\"Pharmacy Education in Europe\") project studied the organisation of pharmacy education, practice and legislation in the European Union (EU) with the objectives of evaluating to what degree harmonisation had taken place with the EU, and producing documents on each individual EU member state. Part of this work was in the form of a survey of pharmacy education, practice, and legislation in the various member states. We will publish the individual member state surveys as reference documents. This paper presents the results of the PHARMINE survey on pharmacy education, training, and practice in the Czech Republic. Czech community pharmacies sell and provide advice on Rx and Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines; they also provide diagnostic services (e.g., blood pressure measurement). Pharmacists ( lÃ©kÃ¡rnÃ­k in Czech) study for five years and graduate with a Magister (Mgr., equivalent to M.Pharm.) degree. The Mgr. diploma is the only requirement for registration as a pharmacist. Pharmacists can own and manage community pharmacies, or work as responsible pharmacists in pharmacies. All practising pharmacists must be registered with the Czech Chamber of Pharmacists. The ownership of a community pharmacy is not restricted to members of the pharmacy profession; the majority of pharmacies are organised into various pharmacy chains. There are two universities providing higher education in pharmacy in the Czech Republic: the Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Kralove, Charles University, which was established in 1969, and the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Brno, which was established in 1991. The pharmacy curriculum is organized as a seamless, fully integrated, five-year master degree course. There is a six-month traineeship supervised by the university, which usually takes place during the fifth year.

The purpose of the research was to document, describe, interpret, and analyze the diversities and universalities of professional and generic care for this cultural group, to provide culturally congruent care to Czech Americans, and to explicate the role of politics as an influence on care patterns, health, and well being. The researcher's former transcultural ethnonursing study in Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1991 served as a stimulus for this in-depth study on politics and care. Twelve key and twenty general informants were interviewed. Five major themes were identified. The researcher discovered that the capitalist economic market structure of the United States influenced informant lifeways in all dimensions of Leininger's Theory of Culture Care Diversity and Universality, as depicted in the Sunrise Model. Specific care patterns discovered included care as choice, care as responsibility, and care as helping each other. Findings related to professional and generic care supported researcher predictions that generic culture care patterns would be important to immigrants. Provisions for culturally congruent nursing care were articulated based on research findings.\n\nPharmacy Practice and Education in the Czech Republic â\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNachtigal, Petr; Å imÅ¯nek, TomÃ¡Å¡; Atkinson, Jeffrey\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe PHARMINE (âPharmacy Education in Europeâ) project studied the organisation of pharmacy education, practice and legislation in the European Union (EU) with the objectives of evaluating to what degree harmonisation had taken place with the EU, and producing documents on each individual EU member state.

The Album is published at the Technical University in Chisinau (The Republic of Moldova). Two chapters of this album present major interest: 1) Space research at the Technical University of Moldova 2) The Foucault Pendulum manufactured at the same University under the supervision of the Rector of University, Dr. Hab. of Technical Sciences and Member of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Moldova Ion Bostan. The parameters of the Pendulums are: m=102 kg L=17,24 m T=8.35 sec. >From the first chapter We learn that 3 astronauts: Frank Lee Culbertson, Vladimir Dezhurov and Dumitru Dorin Prunariu are Doctors Honoris Causa of this University. As well we can found in the album informations about the Microsatellit \"Republic of Moldova\" built also by a team from the same University. It is ready to fly, but many depends on the funds for launch the Satellite. The Foucault Pendulum presents also interest in view of its possible applications to detect the influence of the relative position of the Sun and the Moon on Earthquakes. As is well known the tidal gravitational Force varies, depending on the relative position of the Sun and the Moon.\n\nCzech Registry of Monoclonal Gammopathies - Technical Solution, Data Collection and Visualisation.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrozova, L; Schwarz, D; Snabl, I; Kalina, J; Pavlickova, B; Komenda, M; JarkovskÃ½, J; NÄmec, P; Horinek, D; Stefanikova, Z; Pour, L; HÃ¡jek, R; Maisnar, V\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe Registry of Monoclonal Gammopathies (RMG) was established by the Czech Myeloma Group in 2007. RMG is a registry designed for the collection of clinical data concerning diagnosis, treatment, treatment results and survival of patients with monoclonal gammopathies. Data on patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinaemia (WM), multiple myeloma (MM) or primary AL (\"amyloid light-chain\") amyloidosis are collected in the registry. Nineteen Czech centres and four Slovak centres currently contribute to the registry. The registry currently contains records on more than 5,000 patients with MM, almost 3,000 patients with MGUS, 170 patients with WM and 26 patients with primary AL amyloidosis, i.e. more than 8,000 records on patients with monoclonal gammopathies altogether. This paper describes technology employed for the collection, storage and subsequent online visualisation of data. The CLADE-IS platform is introduced as a new system for the collection and storage of data from the registry. The form structure and functions of the new system are described for all diagnoses in general; these functions facilitate data entry to the registry and minimise the error rate in data. Publicly available online visualisations of data on patients with MGUS, WM, MM or primary AL amyloidosis from all Czech or Slovak centres are introduced, together with authenticated visualisations of data on patients with MM from selected centres. The RMG represents a data basis that makes it possible to monitor the disease course in patients with monoclonal gammopathies on the population level.Key words: Registry of Monoclonal Gammopathies - RMG - registries - monoclonal gammopathies - CLADE-IS - data visualisation - database.\n\nChallenges and Opportunities: Two Weeks of Teaching Technical Communication at Suzhou University, China.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDing, Daniel; Jablonski, John\n\n2001-01-01\n\nRelates the authors' experience teaching technical writing for two weeks at Suzhou University in China.

The main objective is to produce a valid and reliable test to measure students' prerequisite knowledge to learn engineering technology mathematics. It is crucial to have a valid and reliable test as the results will be used in a critical decision making to assign students into different groups of Technical Mathematics 1. The placement test which consists of 50 mathematics questions were tested on 82 new diplomas in engineering technology students at a technical university. This study employed rasch measurement model to analyze the data through the Winsteps software. The results revealed that there are ten test questions lower than less able students' ability. Nevertheless, all the ten questions satisfied infit and outfit standard values. Thus, all the questions can be reused in the future placement test at the technical university.\n\nGeospatial Data for Computerisation of Public Administration in the Czech Republic\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCada, V.; Mildorf, T.\n\n2011-08-01\n\nThe main aim of the eGovernment programme in the Czech Republic is to enhance the efficiency of public administration. The Digital Map of Public Administration (DMVS) should be composed of digital orthophotographs of the Czech Republic, digital and digitised cadastral maps, digital purpose cadastral map (ÃKM) and a technical map of municipality, if available. The DMVS project is a part of computerisation of public administration in the Czech Republic. The project enhances the productivity of government administration and also simplifies the processes between citizens and public administration. The DMVS project, that should be compliant with the INSPIRE (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community) initiative, generates definite demand for geodata on the level of detail of land data model. The user needs that are clearly specified and required are not met due to inconsistencies in terminology, data management and level of detail.\n\nVerification of the radiometric map of the Czech Republic.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatolÃ­n, Milan\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe radiometric map of the Czech Republic is based on uniform regional airborne radiometric total count measurements (1957-1959) which covered 100% of the country. The airborne radiometric instrument was calibrated to a 226 Ra point source. The calibration facility for field gamma-ray spectrometers, established in the Czech Republic in 1975, significantly contributed to the subsequent radiometric data standardization. In the 1990's, the original analogue airborne radiometric data were digitized and using the method of back-calibration (IAEA, 2003) converted to dose rate. The map of terrestrial gamma radiation expressed in dose rate (nGy/h) was published on the scale 1:500,000 in 1995. Terrestrial radiation in the Czech Republic, formed by magmatic, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks of Proterozoic to Quaternary age, ranges mostly from 6 to 245Â nGy/h, with a mean of 65.6Â Â±Â 19.0Â nGy/h. The elevated terrestrial radiation in the Czech Republic, in comparison to the global dose rate average of 54Â nGy/h, reflects an enhanced content of natural radioactive elements in the rocks. The 1995 published radiometric map of the Czech Republic was successively studied and verified by additional ground gamma-ray spectrometric measurements and by comparison to radiometric maps of Germany, Poland and Slovakia in border zones. A ground dose rate intercomparison measurement under participation of foreign and domestic professional institutions revealed mutual dose rate deviations about 20Â nGy/h and more due to differing technical parameters of applied radiometric instruments. Studies and verification of the radiometric map of the Czech Republic illustrate the magnitude of current deviations in dose rate data. This gained experience can assist in harmonization of dose rate data on the European scale. Copyright ÃÂ© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Emperor's approval was received 26th june 1862 and in july PurkynÄ was elected the first president. The same illuminated personalities were the founders of the Casopis lÃ©karÅ¯ ceskÃ½ch--the Czech medical Journal which has remained the most important Czech periodical until the present time. The aims of the Society were to cultivate medical science and promote Czech language in medicine. Weekly scientific sessions, medical periodical and publication of monographs related to medicine were the means how to achieve the aims. The Czech Medical Society became soon the centre of medical science in Bohemia. Its members were among the foremost fighters for the use of Czech language in Charles university and their relentless effort helped much to the establishment of the Czech Univerzity in 1882 and Czech medical faculty a year later. In subsequent years the Society was also involved in professional problems related to social health insurance, medical fees, ethical problems and other relevant questions such as the establishment of medical chambers. The activity of the Czech medical Society was never interrupted during its 130 years of existence, although there were several difficult periods in its life, mainly during the first and second world war and also in the past 40 years. In spite of the atomization of medicine the Czech medical Society has been continuing its eminent mission to create communication and establish close links between the medical science and practical medicine by systematically bringing new knowledge in medicine and biology to general physicians and by putting together physicians, surgeons and basic scientists. The task for the future is seen in optimal transfer of new knowledge and ideas from scientists to practicians and vice versa; and to take care of the highest possible moral and ethical standard required for humane\n\nAging in the Czech Republic.\n\nPubMed\n\nAndel, Ross\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe goal was to provide an overview of main issues relevant to aging in the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic is a former Eastern Bloc nation of about 10.5 million. Older adults are overrepresented relative to those under age 15. Life expectancy currently hovers around 78 years (75 for men/81 for women), a number slightly higher than most of Eastern Europe but lower than most of Western Europe. Cardiovascular diseases account for about 50% of all mortality, which is one of the highest rates in Europe and therefore of particular concern. Lifestyle habits, especially high alcohol consumption, a high rate of smokers, and high-fat diet relative to most other European countries and the United States, combined with relatively low expenditures for health promotion, appear important in the context of high cardiovascular mortality. Long-term care is funded mostly by state and local governments. The country has tried to address issues associated with insufficient capacity and low quality in long-term care, a particularly prominent problem in the Czech Republic compared with other European countries. The recently established International Clinical Research Center brings new possibilities for collaborative research in the Czech Republic, including research specific to aging. Improving long-term care and establishing methodologically sound longitudinal data sets are among the most pressing issues, although sustaining the pension system strained by increasing life expectancy, low retirement age, and extensive government-sponsored benefits has also recently emerged as a critical issue.

The Czech capital also played host to the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union, first in 1967 and, more recently, in August 2006. Astronomy in the Czech Republic is shared between the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences and several leading universities, in Prague, Brno and Opava, among others. The Astronomical Institute operates the Ondrejov Observatory, with a 2-m optical telescope and a 10-m radio telescope. Czech astronomers are very active in many fields of this science, such as solar and stellar physics, and the study of interstellar matter, galaxies and planetary systems. Created in 1962, ESO, which quite fittingly means 'ace' in the Czech language, provides state-of-the-art research facilities to European astronomers and astrophysicists. ESO's activities cover a wide spectrum including the design and construction of world-class ground-based observational facilities for the member-state scientists, large telescope projects, design of innovative scientific instruments, developing new and advanced technologies, furthering European co-operation and carrying out European educational programmes. Whilst the Headquarters are located in Garching near Munich, Germany, ESO operates three observational sites in the Chilean Atacama desert. The Very Large Telescope (VLT) is located on Paranal, a 2 600m high mountain south of Antofagasta. At La Silla, 600 km north of Santiago de Chile at 2 400m altitude, ESO operates several medium-sized optical telescopes. The third site is the 5 000m high Llano de Chajnantor, near San Pedro de Atacama. Here a new submillimetre telescope (APEX) is in operation, and a giant array of 12-m submillimetre antennas (ALMA) is under development. Over 1 600 proposals are made each year for the use of the ESO telescopes.\n\nNorth Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University Drug Education Policy.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWelborne, Sullivan; And Others\n\nThis drug education policy statement for North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University establishes two educational objectives: to develop an educational program that increases the university community's knowledge and competency regarding controlled substances and to increase the skills required to take corrective action for potentialâ¦\n\nThe Vision of Students Enrolled in European Technical Universities Regarding Tomorrow'S World\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDuÅe, Dan-Maniu; NemeÅ, CÄtÄlin\n\n2014-11-01\n\nStarting from Michael Rendell and his team's \"Managing tomorrow's people\", this paper sets out to build a possible future of leadership in European technical universities. We can ask ourselves if European technical universities could exist in a Blue, Green and Orange World. How would they look like and how efficient would \"corporate\" universities be, assuming that the Blue World would prevail in the next 10 years. What should their development strategies be and what labor markets would absorb its graduates? What if universities would be in the Green or Orange World? What leaders should they have then? Starting from these questions we try to construct possible scenarios for a European reality\n\n[Warning about risk of invasive infections in splenectomized patients.

There is no producer of GPR in the Czech Republic, sets of different producers are used, particularly Geophysical Survey Systems, Inc. (USA) and MALÃ GeoScience (Sweden). The measurement results are mostly processed by software Radan, Road Doctor Pro, ReflexW and RadEx. The only technical specification in the Czech Republic is TP 233 issued by the Ministry of Transport, which describes the diagnostics of roads by GPR. Apart from a basic description of the method and a measurement system, it mentions possible applications. The only application where accuracy is mentioned is the locating of dowels and tie bars in concrete road pavements, which states that if calibration is performed, the expected depth accuracy is up to 1.0 cm. The following R&D project is currently in progress: New diagnostics methods as a supporting decision tool for maintenance and repair of road pavements - their contribution and ways of their usage (2012-2014) The project aims to test possible non-destructive methods (particularly GPR and laser scanning), make recommendations when and how to use specific methods for individual applications and for changes in technical specifications. The following R&D projects have been recently completed: Position of dowels and tie bars in rigid pavements and importance of their correct placement to pavement performance and service life (2012-2013) The project included an analysis of individual NDT methods used for the location of dowels and tie bars and for testing of their accuracy - GPR, MIT-scan and GPR in combination with a metal detector.

The project ``Geological research of HLW repository in Czech Republic`` was initiated during 1990 by the Ministry of the Environment of the Czech Republic and by this project delegated the Czech Geological Survey (CGU) Prague. The first CGU project late in 1990 for multibarrier concept has proposed a geological repository to be located at a depth of about 500 m. Screening and studies of potential sites for repository started in 1991. First stage representedmoreÂ Â» regional siting of the Czech Republic for perspective rock types and massifs. In cooperation with GEOPHYSICS Co., Geophysical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences and Charles University Prague 27 perspective regions were selected, using criteria IAEA. This work in the Czech Republic was possible thanks to the detailed geological studies done in the past and thanks to the numerous archive data, concentrated in the central geological archive GEOFOND. Selection of perspective sites also respected natural conservation regions, regions conserving water and mineral waters resources. CGU opened up contact with countries with similar geological situation and started cooperation with SKB (Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co.).

Since that time, many achievements have been registered, and many unexpected difficulties have cropped up. This may be the right moment to take some time out to analyse the state of the programme and to determine the direction for its future development. An extended SWOT analysis can serve as a useful tool for this purpose. Originally, SWOT analyses were used exclusively by for-profit organisations aiming to evaluate their perspectives, develop strategies and make plans in order to achieve their objectives. More recently, it has been used in a wide range of decision-making situations when a desired end-state is to be defined. Here, an extended SWOT analysis is used to formulate possible beneficial strategies for advancing anti-radon policy in the Czech Republic. Â© The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press.

The distinguished visitor was shown the technical installations at the observatory, and was present when the dome of one of the four 8.2-metre Unit Telescopes of ESO's Very Large Telescope opened for a night's observing at Cerro Paranal, the world's most advanced visible-light observatory. \"I'm delighted to welcome President Klaus to the Paranal Observatory and to show him first-hand the world-leading astronomical facility that ESO has designed, has built, and operates for European astronomy,\" said ESO's Director General, Tim de Zeeuw. President Klaus replied, \"I am very impressed by the remarkable technology that ESO has built here in the heart of the desert. Czech astronomers are already making good use of these facilities and we look forward to having Czech industry and its scientific community contribute to the future E-ELT.\" From the VLT platform, the President had the opportunity to admire Cerro Armazones as well as other spectacular views of Chile's Atacama Desert surrounding Paranal. Adjacent to Cerro Paranal, Armazones has been chosen as the site for the future E-ELT (see eso1018). ESO is seeking approval from its governing bodies by the end of 2011 for the go-ahead for the 1-billion euro E-ELT.

Several new members of this viral family have been described during the last decade. Human polyomavirus 9 seems to be a novel pathogen of transplanted patients according to some studies. The aim of our study was to determine the presence of human polyomavirus 9 in patients after kidney or stem cell transplantation (SCT) at the University Hospital in Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. Overall 100 patients, 65 after kidney transplantation and 35 after SCT, were included into the study. At least three follow-up samples from each patient were examined for human polyomavirus 9 DNA presentation with the two previously described in-house PCR protocols. Despite the frequent reactivation of human CMV (14.3% in kidney transplantation and 63.3% after SCT) or BK polyomavirus in our patient group, there was no positivity for human polyomavirus 9 either in blood samples or urine samples. One of the possible reasons for this discrepancy versus previous published studies could be a relatively low proportion of patients treated by induction therapy before kidney transplantation in our study cohort.

PurkynÄ (ÄOS ÄLS JEP) builds on intensive collaboration at all levels of medical care during the organisation of oncological care. Over 77,000 malignant neoplasms are diagnosed in the Czech Republic annually. Every year, over 27,000 patients with a malignant tumour die in the Czech Republic. A total of over 450,000 patients with malignant tumours or patients with a history of an oncological disease are living in the Czech Republic. The specialised society analyses available data about the treatment history and offers them to the individual regions; it also plans population based treatment costs which are then discussed with the healthcare payers. The Czech National Cancer Control Programme (NOP) presents a strategic outline for the management and development of the treatment, and facilitates the communication with all stakeholders and the public. The ÄOS ÄLS JEP Society includes a specialised section responsible for data analysis, which provides a complex agenda of population based data, estimated numbers of treated patients, standards for reference of survival analysis and a system of collecting required clinical data. Even with a growing incidence, the Czech Republic shows a stabilised mortality in all cancer diagnoses. Screening programmes for breast, colorectal and cervical carcinoma are ongoing.

As part of the human adaptation to dairying, the human lactase LCT-13910C/T mutation (which propagates adult expression of lactase) developed, spread and participated in the adaptation to dairying. This variant is associated with lactase activity persistence, and its carriers are able to digest lactose. We compared the frequencies of lactase 13910C/T (rs4988235) genotypes in Czechs/Slavs (N = 288) and Czech Gypsies/Roma (N = 300), two ethnically different groups where this polymorphism has not yet been analysed. Allelic frequencies significantly differed between the populations (p < 0.0001). In Czechs/Slavs, the lactase persistence T allele was present in 76% of the individuals, which is in agreement with frequencies among geographically neighbouring populations. In the Czech Gypsy/Roma population, only 27% of the adults were carriers of at least one lactase persistence allele, similar to the Indian population. In agreement with this result, dairy product consumption was reported by 70.5% of Czechs/Slavs and 39.0% of the Czech Gypsy/Roma population.

In November 2011, we invited all departments of obstetric anesthesia in the Czech Republic to participate in a prospective study to monitor consecutive peripartum obstetric anesthesia procedures. Data were recorded online in the TrialDB database (Yale University, New Haven, CT). The response rate was 51% (49 of 97 departments); participating centers represented 60% of all births in the country during the study period. There were 1943 cases of peripartum anesthesia care, of which 1166 cases (60%) were anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Estimates were weighted based on population distribution of cesarean delivery among types of participating centers. Neuraxial anesthesia was used in 55.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52.8%-58.5%); the distribution of anesthesia techniques differed among type of participating center. The rate of neuraxial anesthesia in university hospitals was 55.6% (95% CI, 51.5%-59.6%), 32.4% (95% CI, 26.4%-39.0%) in regional hospitals, and 60.7% (95% CI, 55.2%-66.0%) in local hospitals. The reasons for cesarean delivery under general anesthesia were emergency procedure (67%), refusal of neuraxial blockade by parturient (30%), failure of neuraxial anesthesia (6%), and preoperative administration of low-molecular-weight heparin (3%). Postcesarean analgesia was primarily provided by systemic opioid (66%) and nonopioid analgesics (61%), solely or in combination. Epidural postoperative analgesia was used in 14% of cases. Compared with national neuraxial anesthesia rate data published in the 1990s (6.7% in 1993), there has been an upward trend in the use of neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery during the 21st century (40.5% in 2000) in the Czech Republic. The rate of neuraxial anesthesia use for cesarean delivery has increased in the Czech Republic in the last 2 decades. However, the current rate of general anesthesia is\n\nPrevalence of genes encoding extracellular virulence factors among meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates from the University Hospital, Olomouc, Czech Republic.\n\nPubMed\n\nSauer, P; SÃ­la, J; StosovÃ¡, T; VecerovÃ¡, R; Hejnar, P; VÃ¡gnerovÃ¡, I; KolÃ¡r, M; Raclavsky, V; PetrzelovÃ¡, J; LoveckovÃ¡, Y; KoukalovÃ¡, D\n\n2008-04-01\n\nA rather fast and complicated progression of an infection caused by some strains of Staphylococcus aureus could be associated with the expression and co-action of virulence factor complexes in these strains.

K.; Lai, C. S.; Lee, M. F.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nMental health is a part of our daily life that is often experienced. As a student, mental health issue often encounters a variety of difficult challenges at the higher education institution. A student with good mental health can handle and cope the normal stress of life, capable work productivity, enhance academic performance and able to make contribute to the community. However, rapidly transformation and changing of society have been impacted on studentsâ mental health, and it will be deteriorated and negatively impact on students if it absence of preventive controlled. This study aimed to identify the element of mental health among the technical university students. A total of 11 experts were selected to analyze the fuzziness consensus of experts. All collected data was analyzed by using the fuzzy Delphi method and the result shows that there are 4 elements of 8 elements that fulfill the requirement consensus of experts, which threshold value is equal and less than 0.2, the percentage of the expert group is more than 75%. The four elements were depression, anxiety, stress, and fear are often experienced by technical university students. In conclusion, precocious actions have to be taken by university and counseling center, parents and non-government organization in order to mitigate the mental health problem faced by students to improve the quality lifestyle students at the university.\n\nMultiple Intelligence Distribution of Prospective Teachers: The Case at Yildiz Technical University\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nÃelikÃ¶z, Mine\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study is to find out whether intelligence distributions differ or not according to gender and departmental variables by determining the dominant intelligence (Multiple Intelligence) distributions of prospective teachers studying at Yildiz Technical University Education Faculty.

This work brings the latest information on MM epidemiology in the Czech population. The Czech National Cancer Registry is the basic source of data for the population-based evaluation of MM epidemiology. This database also makes it possible to assess patient survival and to predict probable short-term as well as long-term trends in the treatment burden of the entire population. According to the latest Czech National Cancer Registry data, there were 504 new cases of MM and 376 deaths from MM in 2014. Since 2004, there has been a 26.9% increase in MM incidence and an 8.3% increase in MM mortality. In 2014, there were 1,982 persons living with MM or a history of MM, corresponding to a 74.4% increase when compared to MM prevalence in 2004. The 5-year survival of patients treated in the period 2010-2014 was nearly 40%. The available data make it possible to analyse long-term trends in MM epidemiology and to predict the future treatment burden as well as treatment results.Key words: multiple myeloma - epidemiology - Czech National Cancer Registry - Registry of Monoclonal Gammopathies - Czech Republic.\n\nA Bibliography of Czech Teaching Materials.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHenzl, Vera M.\n\nThis bibliography, compiled to meet the needs of linguists and teachers who intend to teach courses in Czech to foreigners and are in need of materials to develop a practical and linguistically sound curriculum, is organized under the following headings: (1) dictionary and encyclopedic materials, including monolingual Czech dictionaries andâ¦\n\nThe History of the Physics Department of the Technical University of Moldova\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRusu, Alexandru\n\n2016-02-01\n\nA very complete outline of the history of the Physics Departament of the Technical University of Moldova has been given, since its foundation in 1964.

Already in 1991 the Ministry of Environment entitled The Czech Geological Survey to deal with the siting of the locality for HLW disposal and the project No. 3308 ''The geological research of the safe disposal of high level waste'' had started. Within this project a sub-project ''A selection of perspective HLW disposal sites in the Bohemian Massif'' has been elaborated and 27 prospective areas were identified in the Czech Republic. ThismoreÂ Â» selection has been later narrowed to 8 areas which are recently studied in more detail. As a parallel research activity with siting a granitic body Melechov Massif in Central Moldanubian Pluton has been chosen as a test site and the 1st stage of research i.e. evaluation and study of its geological, hydrogeological, geophysical, tectonic and structural properties has been already completed. The Melechov Massif was selected as a test site after the recommendation of WATRP (Waste Management Assessment and Technical Review Programme) mission of IAEA (1993) because it represents an area analogous with the host geological environment for the future HLW and spent fuel disposal in the Czech Republic, i.e. variscan granitoids. It is necessary to say that this site would not be in a locality where the deep repository will be built, although it is a site suitable for oriented research for the sampling and collection of descriptive data using up to date and advanced scientific methods. The Czech Republic HLW and spent fuel disposal programme is now based on The Concept of Radioactive Waste and Spent Nuclear Fuel Management (''Concept'' hereinafter) which has been prepared in compliance with energy policy approved by Government Decree No. 50 of 12th January 2000 and approved by the Government in May 2002.

Measuring the efficiency of hospitals in order to boost resource productivity in healthcare organizations is extremely important. The aim of this study was to measure technical efficiency and determining status of resource allocation in some university hospitals, in Tehran, Iran. This study was conducted in 2012; the research population consisted of all hospitals affiliated to Iran and Tehran medical sciences universities of. Required data, such as human and capital resources information and also production variables (hospital outputs) were collected from data centers of studied hospitals. Data were analyzed using data envelopment analysis (DEA) method, Deap2,1 software; and the stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) method, Frontier 4,1 software. According to DEA method, average of technical, management (pure) and scale efficiency of the studied hospitals during the study period were calculated 0.87, 0.971, and 0.907, respectively. All kinds of efficiency did not follow a fixed trend over the study time and were constantly changing. In the stochastic frontier's production function analysis, the technical efficiency of the studied industry during the study period was estimated to be 0.389. This study represented hospitals with the highest and lowest efficiency. Reference hospitals (more efficient states) were indicated for the inefficient centers. According to the findings, it was found that in the hospitals that do not operate efficiently, there is a capacity to improve the technical efficiency by removing excess inputs without changes in the level of outputs. However, by the optimal allocation of resources in most studied hospitals, very important economy of scale can be achieved.\n\nTechnical efficiency and resources allocation in university hospitals in Tehran, 2009-2012\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRezapour, Aziz; Ebadifard Azar, Farbod; Yousef Zadeh, Negar; Roumiani, YarAllah; Bagheri Faradonbeh, Saeed\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground: Assessment of hospitalsâ performance in achieving its goals is a basic necessity.

In our review, the specific disease is dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease. This paper aims to provide more information on the partial costs per patient that are calculated according to the aggregated data from publicly available sources as well as from the results of authors' own investigation. The University Hospital in Hradec KrÃ¡lovÃ© and the General Health Insurance Company of the Czech Republic participated in this research. The elementary research objective was to compare the costs per patient diagnosed early onset, to those of the patient diagnosed later. The Czech Republic lacks information regarding dementia. Therefore, these issues require attention. The methods used in this paper included time series analyses, methods of direct questioning, interviews with experts, and analyses of medical documentation. These methods were combined to exploit their particular advantages and to ensure the issues discussed, were covered. The investigation showed that the underpinning of patients with Alzheimer's disease at early onset is advantageous from an economic perspective, because the cost of outpatient care is much lower compared with that of inpatient care. The international comparisons of the volume of care provided should be approached with great caution. These are based solely on the facts of various expert estimates and are not usually supported by hard data. Yet, they still illustrate the overall view of our ability to take care of people with dementia. According to experts, care in the Czech Republic significantly lags behind the rest of developed Europe. While services are provided to 26% of people with dementia in Germany and 50% in France, the experts estimate that services are provided to only 10% of the population in the Czech Republic.

Foods for the initial data set were selected from the list of foods included in the Czech Food Consumption Basket. Selection of 24 priority components was based on the range of components used in former Czech tables. The priority list was extended with components for which original Czech analytical data or calculated data were available. Values that were input into the compiled database were documented according to the EuroFIR standards within the entities FOOD, COMPONENT, VALUE and REFERENCE using Excel sheets. Foods were described using the LanguaL Thesaurus. A template for documentation of data according to the EuroFIR standards was designed. The initial data set comprised documented data for 162 foods. Values were based on original Czech analytical data (available for traditional and fast foods, milk and milk products, wheat flour types), data derived from literature (for example, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, eggs) and calculated data. The Czech FCDB programme has been successfully relaunched. Inclusion of the Czech data set into the EuroFIR eSearch facility confirmed compliance of the database format with the EuroFIR standards.

A review of literature and relevant sources. The trajectory of gambling patterns in the territory of the Czech Republic in the 20th century reflected broad socio-political changes. Those included significant expansion between the wars, strict state control and bans on some gambling activities during the communist regime and finally dynamic development characterized by a boom in electronic gaming machines (EGMs) and increasing accessibility of gambling facilities after 1989, which aggravated gambling-related problems. Many municipalities have banned EGMs, which has created conflict in regulation at state and municipal levels. The draft gambling law prepared in 2014 aims to clarify the regulatory framework. Before 2012 there was only sporadic research interest in gambling, but in 2012 the first complex research on gaming and problem gambling in the Czech population took place. The estimated prevalence of problem gambling is currently 2% in the population aged 15-64 years. Preventive measures, counselling and treatment services for problem gamblers are limited. Weak and ineffective regulation of the gambling market in the Czech Republic during the past 20 years, despite the large growth in gambling, has led to inadequate prevention and response to problem gambling which has become a considerable public health, social and political issue.

Uukuniemi virus has been proposed as a model for tick-borne phleboviruses. However, the number of available sequences is limited. In the current study we performed whole-genome sequencing on two Uukuniemi viral strains isolated in 2000 and 2004 from Ixodes ricinus ticks in the Czech Republic. Both strains cluster together with Potepli63 strain isolated in the country in 1963. Although the Czech strains were isolated many years apart, a high identity was seen at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, suggesting that UUKV has a relatively stable genome.

Health care ranks among the largest public sectors in OECD countries. Efficient governance of hospitals requires the responsible and effective use of funds, professional management and competent governing structures. In this study hospital governance practice in two health care systems â Czech Republic and New Zealand â is compared and contrasted. These countries were chosen as both, even though they are geographically distant, have a universal right to 'free' health care provided by the state and each has experienced periods of political change and ensuing economic restructuring. Ongoing change has provided the impetus for policy reform in their public hospital governance systems. Methods Two comparative case studies are presented. They define key similarities and differences between the two countries' health care systems. Each public hospital governance system is critically analysed and discussed in light of D W Taylor's nine principles of 'good governance'. Results While some similarities were found to exist, the key difference between the two countries is that while many forms of 'ad hoc' hospital governance exist in Czech hospitals, public hospitals in New Zealand are governed in a 'collegiate' way by elected District Health Boards. These findings are discussed in relation to each of the suggested nine principles utilized by Taylor. Conclusion This comparative case analysis demonstrates that although the New Zealand and Czech Republic health systems appear to show a large degree of convergence, their approaches to public hospital governance differ on several counts. Some of the principles of 'good governance' existed in the Czech hospitals and many were practiced in New Zealand. It would appear that the governance styles have evolved from particular historical circumstances to meet each country's specific requirements\n\nFacing Global Challenges: A European University Perspective.
