        "text": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nYou know summer’s basically here when Bravo is gearing up to drop a new Summer House spinoff. Summer House: Martha’s Vineyard follows a group of 11 Black entrepreneurs sharing a space together during the hottest months of the year, and it’s definitely going to bring all the drama. IThe long-awaited series will begin airing on May 7, so buckle up and grab your popcorn. On the menu? Raucous pool parties, scandy bedroom scenes, and Risky Business-style entrances.\n\n\"If you don't know, Black excellence is Martha's Vineyard, and Martha's Vineyard is Black excellence,\" one of the cast members says in the trailer. And here's something you might not already know: Martha’s Vineyard actually has a long history of hosting Black vacationers, and it was “one of the first beach destinations where African Americans could vacation and purchase property,\" per Black Enterprise.\n\nOf course, everyone's favorite part of a new show is getting to know the cast. Spoiler alert: A lot of them already know each other. In fact, Jasmine, Jordan, Shanice, and Bria are all former coworkers…but they’re not necessarily friends. Yikes. And some of the guys used to be fraternity brothers.\n\nSo, here’s everyone you’ll see on Summer House: Martha’s Vineyard, in addition to their jobs, relationships, and Instagrams.\n\nNick Arrington\n\nOriginally from Harlem, Nick works at Deloitte as a brand manager in sports sponsorship activation, but he's also interested in running and fashion in his free time, per his LinkedIn and Bravo bio. (In fact, he even styles grooms for their weddings, and he styled Diddy for the Oscars this year!)\n\nFrom his IG, I can tell Nick is super stylish guy with an impressive resume: He's posted pictures from marathons he's run, places he's traveled, and events he's worked at, like the Masters. Buuut, he also has \"model\" in his bio and already posts #sponcon for his nearly 9,000 followers, so...red flag for a future partner?\n\nHe's a \"self-proclaimed romantic,\" and has high standards—including wanting a future wife who \"must be in shape and have a skincare routine that matches his own,\" the bio continues. Maybe Nick will make for good television?\n\nSee the original post on Instagram\n\nJasmine Ellis Cooper\n\nJasmine was born in the Midwest, raised in Atlanta, and currently lives in NYC, her Bravo bio says. And honestly, she's done it all, career-wise; while she's a screenwriter now, she used to be a Playboy Club bunny with castmates Jordan, Shanice, and Bria, and even lived out of her car when she first moved to New York, according to her bio. She dabbles in acting, per her LinkedIn.\n\nJasmine has a \"polished and poised exterior but is loved for her quirky humor,\" the bio reads. Oh, and she recently married cast member Silas in June 2022, per her IG. The two she met on Hinge, and the Vineyard is extra special to them because Silas asked her to be his GF the first time they visited together!\n\nAccording to Jasmine's 'gram, she loves hanging out with family, traveling, and being with her hubby.\n\nSee the original post on Instagram\n\nSilas Cooper\n\nSilas is Jasmine's husband and a first gen Liberian-American who lives in New York with his wife, per his Bravo bio, which also made sure to highlight that \"he attended Ivy League schools and is a member of prestigious fraternities and organizations.\" (He has ΑΦΑ in his IG bio, which stands for Alpha Phi Alpha, the oldest intercollegiate African American fraternity.)\n\nFrom his IG, it looks like Silas likes to travel, hang out with family, go to Disney World, and explore New York City.\n\nSilas works in finance but is also an officer in the Army Reserve and has been a \"regular\" on the Vineyard for seven years, Bravo wrote. Plus, according to his Instagram, he got his Juris Doctor (JD) degree, which means he went to law school.\n\nSee the original post on Instagram\n\nJordan Emanuel\n\n\"An outgoing jack of all trades\" is how Jordan's Bravo bio describes her. She posed for Playboy and was actually the fourth and final Black Playmate of the Year, Bravo writes. It was during this stint that she met Jasmine.\n\nJordan graduated from the University of Miami, according to her LinkedIn, and her Instagram bio identifies her as a \"NYC DJ, model, and potato enthusiast,\" which I love. She leads the non-profit, Women With Voices, hosts a podcast, Amplified with Jordan Emanuel, deejays, and created a swim line, 844SWIM, per her IG and the outlet. (Bravo also mentions that she likes to get all up in the drama, so keep your eyes peeled for her!)\n\nJordan's also interested in music, fashion, and food, her bio says.\n\nSee the original post on Instagram\n\nBria Fleming\n\nBria is an international lady! She recently crossed the Atlantic to be with her boyfriend, Simon Marco, who \"swept her off her feet\" at the Cannes Film Festival, according to her Bravo bio and IG.\n\nShe's a fashion entrepreneur who works hard to enjoy the ~finer things in life~, her bio says. Bria's Instagram bio says she's the founder and CEO of three beauty and fashion brands: Bria Beauty Cosmetics, Bria Beauty Skin, and House of Louisa. So, I'm not saying she might be hoping to plug her products on Summer House, but I'm not not saying that. P.S. She's besties with Shanice.\n\nBria also has a little pup who she co-parents with Simon, Milo Fleming, who's trying to make it as an actor in this tough world.\n\nSee the original post on Instagram\n\nShanice Henderson\n\nShanice is already my fav because she's a Tampa Bay Buccaneers fan. This \"quintessential party girl\" from Phoenix is always up for a good time, her Bravo biography states. Since she was a Playboy Bunny with Bria, Jordan, and Jasmine, they're all close buds.\n\nShe's been working as a dental receptionist in Arizona since 2020, according to her LinkedIn. In her free time, it looks like Shanice loves to travel, work out, hang out in her bikinis, and attend music festivals, from her IG.\n\nWhile Shanice is still healing from her last relationship, she's still on the hunt for a hubby—preferably one who's \"tall and athletic,\" per her bio. (Maybe she and Nick will be a match?)\n\nSee the original post on Instagram\n\nAmir Lancaster\n\nI'm convinced this man needs to be a model. However, Amir works in real estate in Austin and is a \"new development expert,\" according to his IG bio.\n\nAmir has actually never been to Martha's Vineyard during the summer, according to Bravo, and his dating life is \"full of different flavors of the week.\" I don't know what that means, but I will point out this photo he posted from February at a wedding that has me asking a lot of questions.\n\nAmir is close with his mom and wants to find a woman worthy of bringing home, his Bravo bio reads. Other than that, it looks like he's all work, all the time, from his Instagram.\n\nSee the original post on Instagram\n\nJason Lyke\n\nHailing from New York, NY, but born and raised in Chicago, Jason is a senior flight attendant for \"one of the top airlines\" where he serves celebrity clients, his Bravo bio says. According to his Instagram bio, though, he's an \"Actor/Model/Singer & Mental Health Advocate.\" (He even has an IMDb page and is credited for a role in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 2.)\n\nOther than that, he's an entrepreneur and currently has projects having to do with skincare and beard oils, and he's got a \"vigorous work ethic,\" the bio continues.\n\nFun fact: Jason used to be roommates with Jasmine, so they're close friends. In his free time, he loves to be the life of the party—dancing and socializing—but he also tends to be the therapist of his friend group and in the middle of the drama, per Bravo.\n\nSee the original post on Instagram\n\nPreston Mitchum\n\nFirst thing to know about this man: Preston is dapper AF. The Washington, D.C.-based attorney is a total \"social butterfly,\" Bravo writes, and also spends time as an activist, Georgetown University adjunct professor, cable news show contributor, and political and legal writer, according to his LinkedIn. Phew! Plus, he's the founder and CEO of PDM Consulting, per his IG—is there anything Preston can't do?!\n\nPreston is besties with Silas (they were fraternity brothers), and he has a partner of two years, Donald, who won't be coming with him to the Vineyard, his Bravo bio says. Preston adores the Vineyard, so he can't wait to return.\n\nSee the original post on Instagram\n\nSummer Marie Thomas\n\nSummer's Instagram bio may say \"actor,\" but she's aiming for a career in screenwriting and works as a production coordinator in Los Angeles, Bravo reports. Raised in Pasadena, California, Summer is a \"force to be reckoned with,\" her Bravo bio says, and she went to Sundance in 2019 where she met Jasmine, so they've stayed friends.\n\nIt looks like Summer's interests also lie in snowboarding, traveling, and going to the beach, per her IG, which also has some modeling photos.\n\nSee the original post on Instagram\n\nAlex Tyree\n\nAlex, who was born in Ohio, is a Brooklyn-based artist, creative director, and music curator, according to his IG and Bravo bios. He founded and currently hosts Feel the SPACE, a music community, and he used to help run Spike Lee’s boutique creative ad agency—Spike DDB, according to his website. He's friends with Jasmin and fraternity brothers with Nick, his Bravo bio continues, and now, he's looking for a serious romantic partner with whom he can create a deep connection.\n\nAlex's hobbies include journaling and meditation, per Bravo, and on Instagram, he posts a lot about music, some model shots, and other inspirational posts. Okay, Alex!! I see you.\n\nSee the original post on Instagram\n\nYou Might Also Like"
