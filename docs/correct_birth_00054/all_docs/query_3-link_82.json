        "text": "Former Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna has died aged 49.\n\nThe WTA announced the news on Monday morning in a Twitter post.\n\nThe statement read: “It is with deep sadness that the WTA announces the passing on Sunday, November 19, of Jana Novotna, aged 49.”\n\nNovotna won the Wimbledon women's singles title in 1998 and was beaten by Steffi Graf in the 1993 final.\n\nThe Czech had been battling cancer and died surrounded by her family at her home.\n\nNovotna was at the peak of her powers in the 1990s, winning 24 singles titles, but her success at SW19 was her only grand slam victory.\n\nHaving been beaten in by Martina Hingis in the 1997 final, Novotna exacted her revenge a year later by downing the Swiss in the semi-final and went on to defeat Frenchwoman Nathalie Tauziat to lift the crown.\n\nIt was a moment of redemption for the likeable Novotna, who was in tears after losing the 1993 final to Graf and was consoled by Duchess of Kent at the trophy presentation.\n\nShe reached the final of the Australian Open once and the semi-finals of the French Open and US Open twice, while also enjoying prolific success in doubles, winning 12 grand slam titles.\n\nWTA chief executive officer Steve Simon said: \"Jana was an inspiration both on and off court to anyone who had the opportunity to know her.\n\n“Her star will always shine brightly in the history of the WTA. Our condolences and our thoughts are with Jana’s family.”"
