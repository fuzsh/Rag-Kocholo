        "text": "Perfect start by Krejcikova as she starts the game with a forehand winner. Paolini then goes long with a backhand up the middle.\n\nDouble fault by Krejcikova, 30-15. That was the pressure there. Krejcikova backhand down the line is long. Huge point coming up now.\n\nKrejcikova backhand long, break point Paolini. The Czech was extremely tight there. But the crowd are fully with Paolini here.\n\nPaolini forehand down the line, Krejcikova meets it with a backhand volley winner, deuce. Paolini forehand long, championship point. She is furious with herself.\n\nKrejcikova backhand down the line is long, back to deuce we go! Paolini forehand winner, the crowd are on their feet. Break point to the Italian.\n\nBig ball striking by Krejcikova and she finds the sideline with an inside out forehand winner, deuce again. 99mph Krejcikova ace out wide, second championship point.\n\nKrejcikova slices a nervy backhand into the net, deuce No 4. Paolini backhand return into the net, she can’t believe she missed.\n\nThird championship point. Paolini backhand return long. GAME SET CHAMPIONSHIP KREJCIKOVA!\n\nThe crowd are already trying to get behind Paolini after this fast start by Krejcikova. And it seems to work as Paolini fights back from 0-30 to lead 40-30 with a forehand winner.\n\nBut the Italian goes down the line with a backhand and the ball lands just long. Krejcikova gets a break point when Paolini goes long with a backhand.\n\nBrilliant from Paolini as she disguises backhand wonderfully to hit a drop shot winner. Krejcikova is putting a lot of pressure on Paolini with her consistency off both wings but a rare unforced error on break point keeps the Italian in the game.\n\nKrejcikova return long and Paolini gets up and running in the final.\n\nHello and welcome to coverage of the Wimbledon women’s final between Jasmine Paolini and Barbora Krejcikova.\n\nAfter a thrilling 12 days, we have arrived at the finals weekend and today we will have a first-time winner of the women’s singles title following fightbacks from both players from a set down to win in finals sets in the semi-finals.\n\nPaolini was one of two Italians to reach the last four in the men’s and women’s draws and Jannik Sinner is the world No 1.\n\nIt is a golden era for tennis in Italy and Paolini says they are all inspiring each other.\n\n“I think now we are many Italians doing great things. I think we are inspiring each other, no? Also, I have to say in Italy there are many, many tournaments, like challengers, ITF, juniors.\n\nI think every player shows that something can be possible. Jannik is showing that. In Italy now it’s normal to have Jannik No. 1. Normal, no, but he’s doing unbelievable things.\n\nI think he lost three matches this year, so it’s unbelievable to have him in that position. I think it help all the movement behind, no?\n\nNow we have many, many players that are doing really, really well, apart Sinner, of course.”\n\nFor Krejcikova, who knocked out 2022 champion Elena Rybakina on Thursday, she is bidding to add to her 2021 French Open title and expects a difficult match on Centre.\n\n“I expect a difficult match,” she said. “I expect it’s going to be a big match for both of us. I expect a lot of fighting from both sides. Yeah, I expect, I mean, very, very, very nice match.\n\n“We have a huge tennis history in Czech Republic at the Wimbledon, but also at any other majors. I mean, when I was growing up, I had a lot of players that I could look up to.\n\n“It’s great that right now I’m also a slam champion and I’m in the finals of Wimbledon.”"
