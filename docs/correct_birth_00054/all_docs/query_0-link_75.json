        "text": "Květa Válová is, along with her sister Jitka, one of the most significant figures of Czech art of the 20th century's second half. Both studied at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague, and became in 1954 members of the group Trasa, with whom they exhibited. Along with Adriena Šimotová, Alena Kučerová and other artists she ranks among the most prominent representatives of New Figuration. Květa Válová lived her whole life with her sister in the blue-collar environment of the town of Kladno, which became for here and important source of inspiration. Already in the 1950s she was creating an extensive group of robust figures of labourers, metal founders and rollers. As with her sister Jitka, her main means of expression was drawing, although her paintings are very different in expression from Jitka’s. Characteristic for Květa Válová are massive static figures expressing a deep interest in matter as such, in matter as human burden. Existential matters are depicted in her work in the form of boulders, rocks and walls. In the beginning of her work small figures get lost as it were between massive crags, and in the early 1970s they transformed into a form of large massive blocks directly growing out of the landscape. Květa thus reached the culmination of her search, reaches a close connection between a person and the land. She applies this finding in her work over the next few years in charcoal and pastel drawings that have a monumental, heavy effect and a marked symbolic character. Around the turn of the 80s she created a series of pictures capturing what can even be interpreted as a conflicting tension in which boulders smash into each other. The picture’s spatial arrangement, in contrast to that of Jitka Válová, is more clearly divided and achieves a strong social feeling in its subjects. Květa Válová and Jitkou Válová have taken part in several dozen exhibitions in the Czech lands and abroad. But she did not live to see her last great retrospective in 2000. Her work is represented in many Czech and foreign collections."
