        "text": "Jana Novotna‘s life was marked by rarity and brilliance. The Czech tennis player captivated the world with her unique serve-and-volley style, a skill that became increasingly rare among female players during her career. Her prowess on the court set her apart, making her a standout figure in the tennis community. But in keeping with her trend of rarity, Jana’s departure from this world was as unexpected as it was heartbreaking, leaving a void that still resonates deeply. The impact of Novotna’s death rippled through the tennis community. Even the great Serena Williams couldn’t hold back her emotions.\n\nNovotna passed away from ovarian cancer on November 19, 2017, at the age of 49. Her departure was not just a shock for her then-mentee Barbora Krejcikova, but for the entire tennis community as well. For the tennis great Williams, Novotna’s passing away was equally painful, who admired watching the Czech in the locker room. Speaking in the New York Times interview from 2018, Williams had let her honest emotions flow out.\n\n“I was devastated to hear about that.” Novotna had kept her diagnosis and treatment details private and even Williams was unaware of her illness. “I actually never knew she was battling with cancer. But, yeah, she’s definitely missed for me because usually after the matches, I’d see her there.” Continuing further, she remarked about the legacy that Novotna left behind. “But I know that her legacy and legend will live on. She did a lot for tennis. I feel honored that I had a chance to get to know her.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nInterestingly, Serena played her first Wimbledon in 1998, and it was the same year when Novotna clinched the title. Novotna’s glorious career spanned 14 years when the world saw her winning 24 WTA singles titles and 76 doubles doubles titles. Her demise was equally painful for Krejcikova, who still seems to remain impacted by her death.\n\nKrejcikova hails from the same hometown, Brno as Novotna. As she was transitioning from junior to the professional circuit, she gathered the courage to meet the former Wimbledon champion after stumbling upon an article that informed her of Novotna’s background. Their camaraderie soon developed and Novotna started training Krejcikova in 2014. Fast forward to 2024, when the Czech reached the final of Wimbledon, she could not help missing her mentor.\n\nAfter defeating Elena Rybakina in the semifinals, the 2021 French Open winner recalled the conversations she had with her late coach and shared that she still misses her presence. “I remember thinking about Jana a lot. I have so many beautiful memories and when I step on the court here I’m just fighting for every single ball as that is what she would want me to do.” When commentator Annabel Croft consoled her saying Novotna would be “looking down on her,” Krejcikova was seen weeping inconsolably.\n\nBut Jana who kept her own battle private, never failed to extend a helping hand to her fellow players.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nNovotna’s incredible help to Martina Navratilova as the latter battled cancer\n\nIt was for the first time in 2010 when Martina Navratilova faced a non-invasive form of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma. This had not just surprised her, but many in the tennis community as well. But, Novotna left no stone unturned in extending a helping hand to the 18-time grand slam winner.\n\nAfter Navratilova passed away in 2017, tennis journalist Anuradha Santhanam detailed the help extended by Novotna. “Jana Novotna would drive Martina Navratilova to radiation therapy during Martina’s own battle with breast cancer in 2010. Today, she lost her own. RIP,” she said in a tweet. Navratilova herself had expressed her grief over the passing away of her friend.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nTaking to Twitter, Martina wrote, “The tennis world is so sad about the passing of Jana Novotna…I am gutted and beyond words- Jana was a true friend and an amazing woman…”\n\nAs Wimbledon draws to a close yet another year, it will be interesting to see if Barbora Krejcikova can win the title to offer one of the best tributes to her late coach."
