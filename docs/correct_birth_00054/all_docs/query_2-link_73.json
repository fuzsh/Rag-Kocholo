        "text": "Never mind that she's the third-ranked woman tennis player in\n\nthe world. Never mind that she has been in the top 10 for six of\n\nthe last nine years. Never mind her 20 singles titles, her 68\n\ndoubles crowns or the $8.7 million she has racked up in career\n\nearnings. On the strength--or weakness--of three horrendous\n\nGrand Slam matches, Jana Novotna has been forever branded a\n\nchoke artist, a contemptuous term for athletes who wilt under\n\npressure.\n\nNovotna has worn a choke collar since the 1993 Wimbledon final,\n\nwhen she was within a point of taking a 5-1 lead over Steffi\n\nGraf in the third set, only to double-fault her way out of\n\nvictory. \"I didn't expect Jana to choke like that,\" 1977 champ\n\nVirginia Wade told a BBC audience.\n\n\"Jana's the biggest choker I've ever seen!\" seconded Novotna's\n\nformer doubles partner Gigi Fernandez, who was in the booth with\n\nWade that day.\n\nIt was all too much. During the presentation ceremony, Novotna\n\nrested her head on the duchess of Kent's shoulder and wept.\n\nTwo years after swooning and sobbing, \"No-No Novotna, the lady\n\nfrom Choke-oslovakia,\" as she was called by a San Francisco\n\nsports columnist, squandered an even more commanding lead in the\n\nthird round of the French Open. She had six match points for a\n\n6-7, 6-4, 6-0 win over unseeded teenager Chanda Rubin but blew\n\nthem all, and then missed three more at 5-4 before losing the\n\nfinal set 8-6. Novotna only made things worse by telling the\n\npress, \"I didn't really feel I had the match under control.\" At\n\n5-0, 40-0 in the final set! Say what?\n\nLast summer Novotna stood once more at the threshold of a\n\nbreakthrough. The scene was again the final at Wimbledon; the\n\nopponent this time was 16-year-old Martina Hingis. Novotna\n\nouthit and outran Hingis and won the first set 6-2. Hingis\n\nsquared the match with a 6-3 win in the second before Novotna\n\nbroke to a 2-0 lead in the deciding set. Novotna was a point\n\naway from 3-0 when Hingis took over, sweeping the next five\n\ngames and winning the set, match and championship 6-3. This time\n\nthe culprit seemed more a strained abdominal muscle than a\n\nmental clutch, but the pattern, alas, was all too familiar.\n\nWhile no one disputes Novotna's artistry--she's the last pure\n\nserve-and-volleyer in the women's game--she may at times be too\n\nsmart for her own good. \"You can be too intelligent,\" concedes\n\nher coach, Hana Mandlikova. In situations that call for instinct\n\nand simplicity, Novotna gets gummed up in thinking and\n\ncomplexity. \"In this game the mind is very difficult to\n\ncontrol,\" says Fernandez. \"Jana is not especially gifted in that\n\narea.\"\n\nNovotna stoutly disagrees. The 1993 Wimbledon debacle, she says,\n\nwas strictly a failure of her game plan. Her game is that of a\n\nrisk-taker who goes for winners without fail. In that final\n\nNovotna stuck to the same charging-and-chipping strategy that\n\nhad upended nine-time champ Martina Navratilova in the semis. \"I\n\nwanted to win myself, instead of waiting for Steffi to lose,\"\n\nshe says. \"Unfortunately, she started playing better and I did\n\nnot. Does that make me a choker? How many chokers get to the\n\nWimbledon finals?\"\n\nFor a player whose game is sometimes ruined by tension, Novotna,\n\n29, looks the picture of placidity while lounging around a\n\ntennis club in East Sussex, England. \"I don't think I'm a\n\nchoker,\" she says a bit wearily, \"but I've got a label on my\n\nback that says, 'At the most important point of a big match,\n\nJana will choke.' The label is almost impossible to get rid of.\n\nI could win three straight tournaments, and people would still\n\nsay, 'Yes, she's playing well. But remember the Wimbledon final\n\nwhen she choked?'\"\n\nIn a sport populated with doughy women, the 5'9\", 139-pound\n\nNovotna may be the best-conditioned player on tour. She is also\n\nan overachiever who, despite a fragile forehand, has pushed her\n\nway toward the top through sheer grit. \"She's not naturally\n\ngifted,\" says Mandlikova. \"Everything she achieves is through\n\nhard work.\"\n\nWhich brings us back to the concept of choking. \"When you choke,\n\nit shows you're trying hard and you care,\" says tour veteran\n\nNicole Arendt. \"You put yourself on the line, and if it doesn't\n\nwork, you lose. It's one thing to choke, another to tank. When\n\nyou tank, you don't care anymore.\"\n\nNovotna had to learn to care. \"Growing up, I never thought that\n\nsomeday I'd be Number 1,\" she says. \"I had no dreams, no goals.\n\nI picked up tennis for fun.\"\n\nShe was a gymnast until the day her 6'5\", 220-pound father,\n\nFrank, picked her up at practice in Brno, her hometown in what\n\nwas then Czechoslovakia. \"My coach said, 'Oh, my god!'\" Novotna\n\nrecalls. \"'You're going to be a big girl. There's no future for\n\nyou in gymnastics.'\" So at the advanced age of eight, Novotna\n\nretired from the sport.\n\nHer mother, Liba, suggested tennis. \"I liked the sport, but I\n\ndidn't want to play every day,\" Novotna says. \"But when I did\n\nplay, I had an incredible desire to win.\" When she lost, she\n\ncried. At 12 she cried so much that Liba told her, \"Tennis is\n\nvery fair: You can win or lose. You cannot have both. So, do one\n\nor the other and learn from both, and don't cry if you lose. If\n\nI see you cry once more, I'll never let you play again.\" The\n\ntears stopped. \"I was still crying,\" Novotna confides. \"It's\n\njust that nobody saw me, and gradually I stopped altogether.\"\n\nThe duchess of Kent's dry cleaner might demur.\n\nNovotna was a decent junior player but certainly not a phenom\n\nwho caught the public's imagination. \"Perhaps I succeeded\n\nbecause I never had any pressure,\" she says. Nor did she have a\n\nkiller instinct. \"Steffi was born with it,\" Novotna says.\n\n\"Monica Seles, too. I had to be taught to want to win at all\n\ncosts.\" Teaching her to kill was Mandlikova, a Czech whose\n\nsemibrilliant career featured victories in every Grand Slam\n\nexcept Wimbledon.\n\nThey met eight years ago at Wimbledon, where Novotna had reached\n\nthe quarters. At the time, she was 14th in the world and\n\nholding. Complacency had settled in. \"I could have quit tennis\n\nand bought a house back home and been comfortable,\" Novotna\n\nsays. \"But I had this fire within me. I wanted to do better and\n\nneeded someone who could make something of that fire. I wasn't\n\nlazy, I just needed someone to push.\"\n\nMandlikova came to shove. \"Jana was too nice for a top player,\"\n\nshe says. \"She wasn't aggressive or decisive enough.\" For four\n\nyears Novotna resisted Mandlikova's efforts to change her. \"We\n\nhad so many disagreements!\" says Novotna. \"It's only in the last\n\nfour years that I've stopped fighting and found a happy medium\n\nof being very concentrated on the court and enjoying myself off\n\nit.\"\n\nExcept for a nine-year-old West Highland terrier named Flippy,\n\nthe 36-year-old Mandlikova is Novotna's best friend. Both women\n\nspend much of the year in the Czech Republic--Novotna in Brno\n\nand Mandlikova in Prague--and often drive to European\n\ntournaments together. \"I don't like to fly,\" Novotna explains.\n\n\"In planes I feel like I have no control.\"\n\nNovotna's fear of flying is rivaled only by her fear of Graf,\n\nwho has won 26 of their 30 matches, including all but one of the\n\nlast 16. \"I left Czechoslovakia for the first time when I was\n\n14,\" Novotna says. \"I got to the tournament, and the only player\n\nI'd heard of was Steffi. I played her in the first round and\n\nlost in three sets.\"\n\nShe has been losing ever since. With her nemesis sidelined at\n\nlast year's Wimbledon, all that stood between Novotna and the\n\nwinner's trophy was Hingis--until the injury that had forced\n\nNovotna out of the doubles began causing her pain in the second\n\nset of the final. By the third set Novotna was limping slightly,\n\nand the nerveless Hingis bounced her around the court.\n\nThis time Novotna did not need a shoulder to cry on. There was\n\nno disgrace in this defeat. She may not have risen to the\n\noccasion, but she hadn't collapsed.\n\n\"I still want to win at least one Grand Slam tournament,\"\n\nNovotna says. \"As long as my body holds up, I'll try.\"\n\nAt last year's awards ceremony Novotna playfully snatched the\n\nwomen's singles trophy from Hingis and brandished it aloft in\n\nmock celebration. \"Jana deserves to win this title,\" Hingis said.\n\nThis year, maybe she will.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: SIMON BRUTY [Jana Novotna in game]\n\nNo one disputes the artistry of the last pure serve-and-volleyer\n\nin the women's game."
