Her star will always shine brightly in the history of the WTA,\" WTA Chief Executive Steve Simon said in a statement.\n\nNovotna was a three-time Olympic medalist and a member of Czechoslovakia's 1988 Fed Cup championship team.\n\n\"She always supported us from the stands when she could. We will miss her,\" the Czech Fed Cup team said on its Facebook page. (Reporting by Jason Hovet, Robert Muller and Ian Chadband; Additional reporting by Michael Kahn; Editing by Peter Graff)"
