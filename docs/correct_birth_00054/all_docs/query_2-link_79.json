        "text": "Barbora Krejcikova will attempt to emulate her late mentor and friend Jana Novotna when she faces Jasmine Paolini in the women's singles final at Wimbledon.\n\nThe 28-year-old Czech wiped away tears as she paid tribute to Novotna after making an incredible comeback to defeat Elena Rybakina in Thursday's semi-final.\n\nNovotna, Wimbledon champion in 1998, died from ovarian cancer in 2017 at the age of 49.\n\n\"I just miss her very much, I miss her so much,\" said 31st seed Krejcikova after reaching her first Wimbledon women's singles final.\n\n\"Definitely I remember thinking about Jana a lot. I have so many beautiful memories and when I step on the court here, I am fighting for every ball and I am sure that is what she would want me to do.\"\n\nNovotna lost in the Wimbledon final in 1993 and 1997 before triumphing in 1998 when she defeated France's Nathalie Tauziat.\n\nKrejcikova first met Novotna when her parents took her, aged 18, to the former world number two's house to ask for advice.\n\nNovotna saw something special and became her coach, mentor and friend until she died."
