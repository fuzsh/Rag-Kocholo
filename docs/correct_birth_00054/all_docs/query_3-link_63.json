        "text": "Last October Barbora Krejcikova was inteviewed by the New York Times after her impressive season highlighted by her first Grand Slam singles title at the French Open.\n\nAt this year’s Roland Garros Krejcikova lost the first set against Krystina Pliskova in the first round. She then won her following four matches in straight sets against Ekaterina Alexandrova, Elina Svitolina, Sloane Stephens and Coco Gauff en route to her first Grand Slam semifinal. Krejcikova fended off a match point before beating Maria Sakkari 7-5 4-6 9-7.\n\nKrejicikova beat Anastasya Pavlyuchenkova 6-1 2-6 6-4 in the final of the French Open to become the first Czech woman in 40 years to win Roland Garros to win the Roland Garros singles title.\n\nKrejcikova was ranked world number 33 in the world and was playing just her fifth main draw in a Grand Slam singles tournament.\n\nThe 25-year-old Czech player followed in the footsteps of her compatriot Hana Mandlikova, who won the French Open in 1981.\n\nKrejcikova never dreamed of a professional career. After winning a local junior tournament, she received an André Agassi promotional poster, but she does not remember what she did with it.\n\n“I always loved tennis, always wanted to play, but only played for fun. I did not wallpaper my bedroom with posters of great Czech players, hit balls against a wall late night. I only realized later, when I was 16 or 17 and playing Junior slams, that this was something that I would love to do, that I wanted I wanted to be in the same locker room as the superstars and play against them someday. It’s something I have always dreamed about. Winning here, my first doubles title, then winning the mixed ones. Now I was just telling myself, it would be really nice if I can get the Grand Slam in all three categories. I cannot believe it. It’s unreal that it’s actually happening. A girl from a little city in Czech Republic where we have six courts. My journey is inspiring because nine months ago I was actually out of the top 100. I had the label that I am a doubles player. Nine months later, I am actually a singles Grand Slam champion”, said Krejcikova.\n\nKrejickova started the 2021 season at a career-high of world number 65 in the WTA singles Ranking. Before this season the Brno-native player was known mainly as a doubles player and won two Grand Slam doubles titles at Roland Garros and Wimbledon with her partner Katerina Siniakova in 2018.\n\nThree years ago, Krejcikova was ranked outside the world’s Top 200 in singles, but she reached world number 1 in doubles with Siniakova.\n\nKrejcikova reached her first WTA 1000 final at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships last March. She beat Maria Sakkari, Jelena Ostapenko, Svetlana Kuznetsova, Anastasia Potapova and Jil Teichmann before losing to Garbine Muguruza 7-6 (8-6) 6-3 in the championship match. As a result, Krejikova rose to a career-high world number 38.\n\nKrejcikova beat Sorana Cristea in the final to win her first WTA singles title in Strasbourg.\n\nKrejcikova reached the fourth round at Wimbledon in her first tournament as a Grand Slam champion, before losing to eventual champion Ashleigh Barty. The Czech player went on to win her third title of the season at the WTA 250 in Prague, breaking into the top 10 of the WTA Ranking for the first time in her career.\n\nShe continued her great period of form during the North American hard-court season, when she reached the quarter final in Cincinnati before losing to Ashleigh Barty in straight sets. Krejcikova beat Garbine Muguruza in straight sets in the fourth round at the US Open to reach her second Grand Slam quarter final before losing to Aryna Sabalenka.\n\nKrejcikova won 29 of her last 33 WTA matches to qualify for the WTA Finals in Guadalajara. She scored a record of 45 wins to 17 defeats in singles matches and tied for third on tour with three titles.\n\nKrejicikova reached a career-high number 3 in singles and is the first player to qualify for the WTA Finals in Guadalajra in singles and doubles since Karolina Pliskova.\n\n“What happened this season, it’s really hard to describe it. It’s just perfect. It was an amazing season and really my big breakthrough. I am really glad that things went the way that they went”.\n\nKrejcikova and her compatriot Katerina Siniakova won five WTA doubles titles in 2021 at the Gippsland Open in Melbourne, the Madrid Mutua Open, Roland Garros and at the Akron WTA Finals in Guadalajara and the Olympic gold medal beating Belinda Bencic and Viktorija Golubic 7-5 6-1 in Tokyo.\n\nThey beat Karolina and Krystina Pliskova in an all Czech quarter final match, Bernarda Pera and Magda Linette in the semifinal, Bethanie Mattek Sands and Iga Swiatek in the final to claim their second Roland Garros title. Krejcikova became the first woman since Mary Pierce in 2000 to win both the singles and doubles titles in the same edition of the French Open.\n\nThey also reached the doubles final at the Australian Open before finishing runner-up to Aryna Sabalenka and Elise Mertens in the final.\n\nKrejcikova went on to become the only player to qualify for both the singles and doubles tournaments at the WTA Finals in Guadalajara. Krejcikova and Siniakova won the WTA Finals doubles title, beating Hsieh-Su-Wei and Elise Mertens 6-3 6-4.\n\nKrjcikova has followed in the footsteps of her compatriots Vera Sukova, who reached the Wimbledon final in 1962, Martina Navratilova, who reached two Grand Slam finals while she was representing Czechoslovakia in 1975 and then she won 18 Grand Slam titles, including Wimbledon, after she won to the United States. Petra Kvitova won two Wimbledon titles. Karolina Pliskova reached the Wimbledon final before losing to Ashleigh Barty in the championship match.\n\nCzech Republic won six of the eight Fed Cup Finals from 2011 to 2018. Krejicikova played the doubles matches in two editions of this tournament in 2018 and 2019. She made her singles debut at this tournament, which has now renamed Billie Jean King Cup, in Prague last November.\n\nKrejicikova won the 2013 European Junior Championships in singles and doubles. In the same year Krejcikova and Siniakova claimed junior titles at the French Open, Wimbledon and at the US Open.\n\nKrejicikova played the qualifying tournaments at the four Grand Slam events 16 times from 2014 to 2019 and advanced to the main draw only once. She trained for several years at the TK Agrofert Prostejov, the same club where Kvitova trained.\n\n“I used to watch Petra Kvitova a lot, and I always wished that I could hit some balls with her. Then we were on the Fed Cup team together, and now I have a different perspective. It’s just crazy”, said Krejicikova.\n\nKvitova believes that doubles success has contributed to make Krejicikova a better singles player.\n\n“It’s the variety of her game and how she is seeing it from the doubles as well. She has a kick serve too which which not many players have. She has drop shots, slice, topspin, serve and volley, whatever, it’s all there”, said Kvitova.\n\nKrejicikova and her mother Hana knocked on the door of Jana Novotna’s house in Brno, looking for advice. Novotna, who won the 1998 Wimbledon title, agreed to work with Krejicikova and became her mentor. Novotna died of cancer on 19 November 2017 at the age of 49. Krejikova paid her tribute to Novotna.\n\n“I would say that the connsection to Novotna was a huge guiding light for me, and I really appreciate that she gave me her time and wanted to help me and not someone else. Even when everyone else was in the top 100 and I was playing International Tennis Federation tournaments and qulaifying, she always told me: ‘Be patient, you are going to be like me. Keep improving me, and you will get there one day and, out of nowhere, I am here”, said Krejcikova."
