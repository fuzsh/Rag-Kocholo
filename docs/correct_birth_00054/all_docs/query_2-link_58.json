        "text": "Bio Jana Novotná was a former professional tennis player from the Czech Republic. She played a serve and volley game, an increasingly rare style of play among women during her career. She won the women's singles title at Wimbledon in 1998 and was runner-up in three previous Grand Slam tournaments. Novotná also won 12 Grand Slam women's doubles titles and four Grand Slam mixed doubles titles. She had a highest singles ranking of No.2 in 1997 and achieved a No. 1 ranking in doubles.\n\nJana Novotná turned professional in February 1987. In the early years of her career, she was known primarily for her success as a doubles player. In the early 1990s, Novotná began to have success in singles once four-time Grand Slam singles champion Hana Mandlíková became her coach. Previously Mike Estep had been her coach.\n\nThis enormously appealing athlete from the Czech Republic was a complete player who crafted the serve-and-volley game with stunning effectiveness. No one in the women’s game has exhibited more command at the net. Novotna’s relentless aggression was backed up by a solid ground game. Winning Wimbledon in 1998 was surely the crowning moment in her career, but she also won 12 majors in women’s doubles and four mixed doubles titles.\n\nJana inducted into International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\nNovotna died peacefully at her home, on 19 November 2017, after a long battle with cancer."
