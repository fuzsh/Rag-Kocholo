        "text": "Harry Harrison’s Make Room! Make Room! has come out of the hat and will be the subject of this month’s reading group.\n\nThis classic work of science fiction from 1966 was one of the most popular nominations for our climate theme – and with its story of scarce resources and subsequent societal breakdown, it looks like a prescient novel.\n\nWe’ll be able to test just how prescient because Harrison set his dystopia in the then distant year of 1999. As incredible as it may seem to some of us, that’s now a long time in the past. It will be interesting to see how well Harrison’s predictions measure up to reality.\n\nWhile we’re making comparisons, I’m also curious to see how the novel stacks up against the film it inspired, the 1973 classic Soylent Green. Famously, there’s at least one crucial difference – and look away now if you’re one of the few people left in the world who doesn’t know what Soylent Green is: there’s no cannibalism in the novel. In Harrison’s book, “soylent” is made of soybeans and lentils. This is a point on which the novelist had strong opinions, believing that making Soylent Green out of humans was a sensationalist trick: “What’s wrong with cannibalism? I’ll tell you what’s wrong with cannibalism – humans put on meat too slowly.”\n\nQuotes such as that helped cement his reputation in the SF community for being (as Christopher Priest put it in his 2012 obituary) “amiable, outspoken and endlessly amusing”. Harrison was also a prolific and highly respected elder of the scene. Born in 1925, he wrote more than 50 novels and won numerous awards – as well as a place in the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2004. He was also one of the main writers on the Flash Gordon newspaper strip in the 1950s and 1960s and a dedicated Esperanto speaker, saying he learned the language when he was bored during his conscription in the US Army Air Corps. He even wrote the first Esperanto SF story: Ni venos, Dokrora Zamenhof, ni Venos! (We will come, founder of Esperanto, we will come.) Military service also gave him the hearty resentment of authority that fired up novels such as Make Room! Make Room! I’m looking forward to reading it and I hope you’ll join me."
