        "text": "'Revelatory. Harry Harrison's novel about Earth on the edge of disaster is both bracing and cathartic ... impressively prescient' Guardian\n\nThe planet's population has exploded and resources are stretched to breaking point. And, in a sweltering, overcrowded New York City of 35 million desperate inhabitants, a police detective must try to solve a murder. The basis of the cult film Soylent Green, this eerily prophetic novel is a nightmarish vision of a world in meltdown.\n\n'A cautionary tale of what might happen if American consumption goes unchecked' Los Angeles Times\n\n'An author with a serious purpose and a subversive wit' Christopher Priest"
