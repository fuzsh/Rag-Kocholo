        "text": "Harry Harrison (1925-2012) was an American novelist of science fiction, best known for his Stainless Steel Rat character. His novel Make Room! Make Room! was loosely adapted into the film Soylent Green, starring Charlton Heston. Before he starting writing, Harrison was an artist for EC Comics series Weird Fantasy and Weird Science.
