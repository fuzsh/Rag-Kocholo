        "text": "The world is crowded. Far too crowded. Its starving billions live on lentils, soya beans, and —if theyre lucky—the odd starving rat.\n\nIn a New York City groaning under the burden of 35 million inhabitants, detective Andy Rusch is engaged in a desperate and lonely hunt for a killer everyone has forgotten. For even in a world such as this, a policeman can find himself utterly alone….\n\nAcclaimed on its original publication in 1966, Make Room! Make Room! was adapted into the movie Soylent Green in 1973, starring Charlton Heston along with Edward G. Robinson in his last role."
