        "text": "July 19, 2020\n\nThis was a trip through memory lane for me. I thought I would encoounter a lot of new (to me) stories, but a lot of these I remembered from collections I read as a teenager, often translated to Dutch (in the anthologies that my father had). A lot of them I had forgotten I'd read. This was not a drawback to me, as they were all great stories, and I liked finding out which of these I had read before. Harry Harrison is one of the greats of the SF-field and this collection makes it clear why. As one of the few of the SF-greats he likes to add humour to his stories, sometimes in wry asides, but he also likes to write parodies of the genre. He is well known from the humoristic series 'The stainless steel rat' and he has the 'ultimate space opera' on display here: 'Space rats of the C.C.C.' which had me grinning throughout. 'If' made me chuckle in its parody of the time travel tale. 'Captain Honario Harpplayer, R.N.' was fun too. Also Harrison was socially conscious. He has several stories about the wrongs of racism (one in a nominal utopia that still has biases in selecting which embryo's to cultivate - 'Brave Newer World'). The story 'Mute Milton' is a powerful little tale. Harrison was one of those authors that was at his best when he was angry at something, an injustice in particular. His passion then comes through in every word! He was also concerned about environmental topics, especially the problem of overpopulation. A couple of stories here touch on that subject, as does his well know work 'Make room! Make room!' that was filmed as 'Soylent Green'. The story 'Roommates' takes place in that universe and is suitably grim. 'A criminal act' takes more of a darkly humorous interpretation ... There are several stories here about the clash between reason and superstition. The opening story 'The streest of Ashkelon' is a hard hitting story, in which a priest lands on a planet with rational aliens, who want to put his beliefs to the test ... It has a tragic (but great) ending. The same theme comes to the fore in 'Rescue Operation', where an alien spacecraft is downed in the Mediterranean and the superstition of the locals means the pilot can't be saved. Very well written. 'I Always Do What Teddy Says' made a big impression on me as a teenager. I don't think morality is formed this way and morals are separated from each other in this way, but the story is powerful enough to still work. Chilling. 'The Mothballed Spaceship' was a fun tale in the 'Deathworld'-universe. Some stories didn't work that well. The metaphor in 'By The Falls' was labored and 'The Ever-Branching Tree' was a biology lesson in transparant disguise. Still, a fun collection for afficionado's of the SF-genre."
