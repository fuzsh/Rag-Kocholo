        "text": "Harry Harrison (1925 - 2012) was born in Connecticut and lived in New York City until 1943, before being drafted into the United States military. After WW2, he settled in the United Kingdom.\n\nHis contribution to science fiction writing is almost unparalleled: Deathworld, the Stainless Steel Rat series, Bill, the Galactic Hero, Stars and Stripes Forever, and West of Eden are all classics of the genre. He received the Nebula Award, the Golden Scroll of the Academy of SF Film, Prix Jules Verne (Sweden) and the Premio Italia. He was also a member of the SF Hall of Fame."
