        "text": "June 26, 2021\n\nMcDonald's springs to mind!üëçüêØ\n\nMonsanto too!\n\nMay 3, 2018\n\nHere is a 1966 novel about 1999 which is good, honest, miserable fun. The main guy who is a cop gets to be really happy for about two pages and after that it‚Äôs back to worrying about absolutely everything.\n\nIt‚Äôs New York City and the population has skyrocketed to 35 million. The whole damn country has kind of collapsed. There are no more private cars. Tobacco is a thing of the past. There are meateasies! This is because you can get your meat but you have to know where. But pretty much everything is now scarce because Americans in the 30 years between 1966 and 1999 ate everything and used up everything whilst all having ten kids who then had another ten kids each, it seems.\n\nYou wouldn‚Äôt want to live in this version of New York City. You wouldn‚Äôt want to even visit it for ten minutes.\n\nCHUNK!\n\nThis humble word is Harry Harrison‚Äôs absolute favourite. No idea why. If you had a shot of vodka each time he uses the word CHUNK you‚Äôd be dead of severe alcoholic poisoning before page 90. My own favourite word is GALLIMAUFRY but you don‚Äôt see me shoehorning it into every review willynilly. Willynilly is another of my favourite words.\n\nBILLY NO MATES - A THEORY\n\nMy latest literary insight is that in most novels, especially thrillerish ones, the protagonist has no friends. (Check the last three novels you read.) I think this is because it would make the story too complicated and annoying for the author & would get in the way of the action. Make Room! Make Room!‚Äôs two main characters begin with one sort of friend for him* and none for her. Novelists, this is very unrealistic. People have friends! Even I have friends!\n\n*Our hero‚Äôs friend is nothing more than a SOCK PUPPET so that Harry Harrison can explain his ideas of how overpopulation killed the USA and will kill the whole human race unless we embrace birth control. The message of this novel couldn‚Äôt be clearer if Harry Harrison personally came round to your house and nailed it to your forehead. With another copy to be cellotaped to your bedroom mirror.\n\nHARRY ADMITS : I GOT IT WRONG\n\nIn a one page afterword written in 2008 at the age of 83 HH says : ‚ÄúHow right were my predictions? Pretty bad in most of the general details‚Äù but then he does say there‚Äôs too many damn people and the developed world is soaking up all the planet‚Äôs resources. Which we know. He predicted the population of NYC would increase from 8 million in 1966 to 35 million in 1999 which is RIDICULOUS. But there is now a city ‚Äì Chongqing ‚Äì which Wiki tells me has reached 30 million. And others aren‚Äôt far behind (Shanghai, 24m, Delhi, 21m). The biggest population growth is in the developing world, and this tells us that HH didn‚Äôt understand the part which says that there is a correlation between affluence and family size. So the families of western people shrank over the 20th century (I can see this in my own family ‚Äì grandparents generation 9 or 10 children; parents‚Äô generation two or three; my own generation one or two or NONE.)\n\nI LIKED IT!\n\nEven though it‚Äôs a bit of a miseryfest, it zips along and HH has a real relish for all the horrible details.\n\nA CHUNKy three stars from me.\n\nFebruary 11, 2012\n\nColor me happy and more than a little surprised to be decorating this review with as many stars as I am because I went into this novel with pretty subdued expectations. I would say expectations on par with those I hold for the latest cinematic embarassment by Mr. Dickoless Cage. I know that's not very nice, but I will never, never forgive that talent-free ass bozo for effectively castrating Ghost Rider in front of the general public, despite being a self-described fanboy of the character. The guy should be tied up in a Pulp Fiction style basement and JAMhandled by the gimp.\n\nWOW, okay...I am way off on a tangent here aren't I?...let's get back to the book.\n\nWhere was I? Oh yeah....\n\nSo leaving aside shitty actors with no ability, this is an excellent novel and a very welcome surprise. Written in 1966 (but taking place in 1999) the story posits a world reaping the results of massive over-population and the depletion of natural resources....which of course we know could NEVER really happen and is just one of those wacky SF ideas these weirdo writers come up with. Hmm? Anyway, while loosely framed as a mystery involving a hard-boiled detective investigating a murder, this plot device is really just a means by which the author explores the future society of New York City (population 35 Million, as opposed to the just under 10 Million of present day 2011).\n\nWhat really grabbed me by the fruits about the story is the terrific sense of place the author establishes through random, but well chosen, details about life in this \"future\" New York. Harrison is able to seamlessly weave into the narrative the most fascinating snapshots of the world without resorting to big, drawn out expositional paragraphs. I was very impressed by his control over his story. This novel is a lesson in exceptional world-building.\n\nWe learn significant background details such as information involving food riots, foodstuffs made from plankton, soy bean and lentil steaks, ever increasing prices of commodities, water shortages, debates about birth control, and that all of the characters suffer from physical ailments resultng from mal-nutrition or disease. The author provides this well fleshed, intricate picture of the world without dropping major dumps of info that would clog up the natural flow of the story.\n\nWell done, sir. Well done indeed.\n\nIn addition to the exceptionally delivered background info, the characters are very much three dimensional and act pursuant to complex and subtle motivations. This kind of high level development is unusual for this kind of short 60's science fiction novel. Again the author exceeed expectations and his ability to do that consistently is worthy of serious kudos.\n\nTo sum up, this is a terriific story. While not up to the \"all time great\" status of a book like Stand on Zanzibar (which is my standard for this kind of science fiction story), this is certainly an outstanding story and among the best of its type that I have read.\n\n4.5 to 5.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!\n\nSeptember 20, 2019\n\nA science fiction classic\n\nQuite unlike the movie, Make Room, Make Room is a gloomy, glimpse into a New York burgeoning with too many people. The movie that is loosely based on it is Soylent Green. Andy Rusch is a city cop who is overworked and underpaid. He has one friend, Sol, an old man who also shares a room with him. During the investigation of a bigwig's murder, Andy meets a gorgeous woman who was the mistress of the newly deceased. They hit it off. As Andy investigates the crime, he and Shirl get closer, but will she be satisfied with a common man after living the high life in a world in which very few live decently?\n\nSeptember 20, 2019\n\nA great book, depressingly enjoyable.\n\nIt's amazing but I don't think i have ever read this book before. So when it came up as a Group Read for the \"Apocalypse Whenever\" group, I voted for it and bought a kindle copy. One of the best decisions i've made.\n\nIt is set during 1999 in New York and proceeds all the way to the millennium. Now obviously it is 19 years past that date, and so it is interesting to see what Harry got right , and boy was it a lot. That said some of the \"future\" as portrayed by Harry is an over exaggerated view of what occurred.\n\nPopulation out of control, horrendous pollution, over use of all the Earth's natural resources are just some of the issues facing the Earth and more especially the citizens of NY in this novel. Into this add a police force that is severely understaffed and over stretched . A police force that might spend only a few hours on each of the numerous murders that occur on a daily basis. That is until a \"fixer and supplier\" for some very wealthy people is murdered. Then pressure is brought to bear on the police force to solve this case quickly and not to just let it go. Add into the mix a beautiful girl, an old man with memories of pre problem days, a loyal and trustworthy bodyguard, a group of demonstrators known as the Eldsters (that'd be me üò¨ ) , some religious nuts thinking the end is nigh and a young boy on the run.\n\nA great story, depressing but enjoyable in the fact it is wonderfully written.\n\nJune 26, 2024\n\nMake Room! Make Room!, one of the best predictive science fiction works of its time, and one of the most underrated too, foresaw in 1966 that the end of the century would be a time out of hell for New York City, opening the flood gates to an even more hellish new millennium: Climate change and scorching heat burning the planet down; the world bursting at its seems with extreme overpopulation; serious food and housing shortages; barely any water to drink and as a consequence, the lack of a vital infrastructure pushing the masses into crime... Not an ideal place at all. The book shows how people from different backgrounds cope under these utterly dire living conditions.\n\nAgainst this hellish backdrop we focus on Andy, a police detective tasked with investigating the seemingly mysterious death of the ultra rich mobster Mike O'Brien, Big Mike. During the investigation Andy starts a relationship with Big Mike's hired lover, sugar baby, live-in sex worker, whatever you want to call her, Shirl, who then moves from Mike's gloriously luxurious house with running water and food aplenty into the poor, two room shack he shares with his roommate Sol, an older man who produces his own electricity by riding a wheelless bike.\n\nMeanwhile there are uproars outside, especially the older generations are constantly rallying against the system. The way older people and their political understanding are portrayed is utterly interesting, especially for our times; this exact generation which back in the day was quite revolutionary is being dismissed and looked down on now.\n\nAs lead character, Andy is actually quite bland, to be honest, he is kind of an everyman and replaceable with many. He holds values like integrity and honesty and has traditional expectations from his relationship with Shirl; he is kind of a romantic expecting to find a true love he can provide for and take care of (but does not have the financial means to do so). Too bad Shirl is a tough and realistic business woman disguised as a naive young girl, and who is only following the rules this cruel new world has taught her in order to survive - namely to go with whoever can provide for her, pay her money for her company, which Andy can't do.\n\nSol, on the other hand, is created to be every reader's dream character - old, wise, funny, smart, and familiar with the time and conditions the reader lives in, a time where food is not scarce, where running water and electricity are not luxury goods, but basic human needs. So being a person who knows both how wonderful life could be and his harsh reality, he possesses the kind of clarity the other characters lack. As he states, the crux of the matter is birth control. Since the invention and growth of modern medicine, or death control as he calls it, the number of people on Earth has been multiplying uncontrollably, causing the current state in the book. All the sadder that today we are again moving backwards, moving away from the need to control birth on this planet (as we control death) and finding a way to distribute resources so that every person can live in dignity. We're nearing our catastrophe by the minute actually.\n\nBy using as many characters as possible from different backgrounds, Harrison also presents the survival options for the groups in question; Billie Chung, for instance, as a young man of Asian background living in a type of China Town, leads a much harder life than Andy or Shirl, the latter, as a pretty white girl, has found the option of sex work for herself to live in luxury. She too has to pay a price and keep company to men who aren't always nice to her and the sexism she encounters and faces smiling politely is infuriating. Still, it's her job. Then there's Billie's mother, who leads a life of extreme poverty as an Asian woman and mother.\n\nEveryone is miserable and as the new millennium is rang in, it is a bitter sort of new beginning which offers neither hope nor joy.\n\nThis is the Shine and Shadow dark read for June'24!\n\nMay 25, 2017\n\n‚ÄúSo mankind gobbled in a century all the world‚Äôs resources that had taken millions of years to store up, and no one on the top gave a damn or listened to all the voices that were trying to warn them, they just let us overproduce and overconsume until now the oil is gone, the topsoil depleted and washed away, the trees chopped down, the animals extinct, the earth poisoned, and all we have to show for this is seven billion people fighting over the scraps that are left, living a miserable existence‚Äîand still breeding without control. So I say the time has come to stand up and be counted.‚Äù\n\nIs overpopulation still a thing? When was the last time you heard it discussed? I don‚Äôt know the answer to that, there are opposing views on whether overpopulation still poses a significant threat to all of humanity or, since population growth has stabilized in many countries, some demographic analysts are saying that it is no longer a serious matter. Nowadays climate change is generally viewed as a more pressing issue.\n\nIn the 60s overpopulation was perceived as a major threat and it is one of the dystopian tropes often used by sci-fi authors. Several ‚Äúoverpopulation‚Äù sci-fi novels have become classics of the genre, John Brunner‚Äôs Stand on Zanzibar, The Sheep Look Up by the same author, and Robert Silverberg‚Äôs The World Inside spring to mind. However, for me, the one emblematic sci-fi book on this subject is Harry Harrison‚Äôs Make Room! Make Room!.\n\nMake Room! Make Room! was first published in 1966, it is set in the (then) future of 1999, starting in August and ends shortly after midnight of January 1st, 2000. In this version of 1999, the global population is seven billion, food, water, electricity and living accommodations are scarce. In New York, where the novel is set, millions of people are living on the streets, public transportation is no longer in operation, and all basic necessities are strictly rationed. Wheat crackers have become a staple food, and meat is mostly only available in an artificial form called ‚Äúsoylent meat‚Äù, produced from soya beans.\n\nBut how do you tell a story about overpopulation? The concept does not seem to lend itself to conventional plotting. Harrison does this by focusing on just a few protagonists rather than writing an epic but fragmented novel about a large cast of characters. Detective Andy Rusch is the main character of this book, he shares a cramped little apartment with Sol, a retired engineer. Andy is assigned to investigate a murder of an ‚Äúimportant businessman‚Äù called Michael O‚ÄôBrien who is, in reality, a gangster with political connections. O‚ÄôBrien lives in a walled off luxury apartment with access to unlimited electricity and water supply, they even have air conditioning. This is where Andy meets Shirl Greene, O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs girlfriend who was living with the murder victim and now has to move out. The two predictably form a relationship. To the readers the identity of the killer is not a mystery; it is a destitute teenager who attempted to burgle the apartment, and was caught in the act by O‚ÄôBrien and accidentally killed him in self-defense.\n\nThe first half of the book is so focused on the murder investigation that I did wonder how this is a novel about overpopulation, let alone a sci-fi novel. However, the dystopia is always there in the background, in the state of Andy‚Äôs apartment, the people lying on the street that he has to step over to get into his home, his roommate powering their refrigerator by hooking it to a bicycle and cycling like mad. In the second half of the book, the murder investigation fades into the background and an accident causes sea water to seep into the water supply which is quickly shut down. Water become even more strictly rationed and is only available from ‚Äúwater stations‚Äù which has to be carried home in bottles and buckets. Children are beginning to contract kwashiorkor, a form of severe protein‚Äìenergy malnutrition hitherto nonexistent in the US. Living condition deteriorates throughout the narrative and a massive city-wide riot seems imminent.\n\nMake Room! Make Room! paints a grim and depressing picture of an overpopulated New York, it frighteningly depicts the dehumanizing effect of overpopulation. The way of life we take for granted is not sustainable under such conditions, even the simple human interrelationships between family members and friends are corroded by the constant suffering and hardship. Make Room! Make Room! is not a fun read as such, it is too harrowing for that, but it is a good, thought-provoking read. It is quite well written, with a clear straightforward prose, the characters are well developed and sympathetic. The fact that the actual year 1999 was nothing like this is not a reason to dismiss this cautionary tale out of hand. For all we know, Harrison has only overestimated the timing but the catastrophe he depicts here is still possible.\n\nNotes:\n\n‚Ä¢ The film adaptation of Make Room! Make Room! is much better known than the book. It is a 1973 movie called Soylent Green. It departs from the source material in many details (especially the titular foodstuff), but is true to the book‚Äôs spirit.\n\n‚Ä¢ Q: Is overpopulation still a problem?\n\n‚Ä¢ A: Yes / No / Maybe\n\n‚Ä¢ Harry Harrison is one of the popular sci-fi authors during the 60s through to the 80s, his popularity declined a bit from the 90s onward. Sadly he passed away in 2012. Make Room! Make Room! is atypical of his output. He tended to write fast-paced, lighthearted sci-fi adventures, like his signature series The Stainless Steel Rat, my personal favorite of his book is West of Eden.\n\nQuotes:\n\n‚ÄúThe millennium is here, now, upon us a populous world of souls awaiting His call. This is the true millennium. False prophets said it was the year one thousand, but there are more people here in this single city than there were in the entire world at that time. Now is the hour, we can see it nearing, we can read the signs. The world can hold no more, it will crack asunder under the weight of the masses of people.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe can go without washing for a while, it won‚Äôt kill us, and when the water is connected up again we can all have a good scrub. It‚Äôs something to look forward to.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFace it, this city is through. What they need here is animal trainers, not policemen.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThis whole country is one big farm and one big appetite. There‚Äôs just as many people down South as there is up North and, since there‚Äôs no public transportation, anyone who tried to walk to the land of sunshine would starve to death long before he got there. People stay put because the country is organized to take care of them where they are.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNew York City trembled on the brink of disaster. Every locked warehouse was a nucleus of dissent, surrounded by crowds who were hungry and afraid and searching for someone to blame. Their anger incited them to riot, and the food riots turned to water riots and then to looting, wherever this was possible.‚Äù\n\nJuly 8, 2012\n\nFirst thing, Forget about the movie Soylent Green which was based on Harry Harrison's novel about overpopulation, Make Room! Make Room!. There is no Charleston Heston screaming , \"Soylent Green is people!\" and nothing about cannibalism. What we have instead is a very effective and disquieting look at a future where overpopulation is rampant and food and water sources are depleting. While he centers his story around a New York detective and a \"accidental\" murder, Harrison is more interested in depicting his character's more personal responsse to their environment. Sol (beautifully played by Edward G. Robinson in the movie and the best thing about the film) is most memorable with his ability to remember the past and his examination of where they went wrong. His soliloquy on birth control still rings true today. Yet all the novel's protagonists are nicely developed. Considering the topic, this is actually a fairly subtle novel and one of the best novels by veteran Sci-fi writer Harrison. Highly recommended with a strong four stars.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\nDepressing, would be the first word that comes to mind.\n\nHarry Harrison had me interested in his characters within the first two chapters of this book. Sounds like a good start. But then he deviated a bit from what I thought was the main plot to explain how a relationship might work and be strained in the future world of 1999.\n\nIt's crazy to think that we have surpassed Harry's population numbers and don't quite live in the dystopic world he depicted. We are, however, a population running on fumes. There's nothing in the tank, but we still huff on those sweet gases we call credit. We build up, we build out, we level nature for more farmland to feed the masses, we even have billionaires trying to escape to Mars. How can it be solved? Can it be solved? Culling might be frowned upon--depending on who you ask.\n\nThe birthcontrol pill was a recent invention when this book came out. Harry Harrison had his characters delve into monologues about the importance of birthcontrol, which was probably quite popular with the youth at the time thanks to the sexual revolution, and he even went into criticisms of the Catholic church and its stance on the topic. Again, probably not popular, but this was a cautionary tale of the future's plight. You don't always get a solution tabled by a sci-fi author.\n\nWhen the book was over, I found myself wondering, 'What was the point of this book?' I usually do that anyway, but only after I find a book particularly engaging, but with Make Room! Make Room! my thoughts were of frustration. Until I started thinking about the static nature of the character. This guy was shown avenues of change, but he refused to tread. Or he did tread, but then circled back around to his old route. By the end of the book, he was back at the starting line. Was Andy an allegory for the whole human race?\n\nThere was a lot happening in the '60s and this book is as culturally relevant as a song made about the Vietnam War. I enjoyed the read, but by the end I couldn't help but wonder: 'Is that all there is?'\n\nDecember 13, 2022\n\n‚ÄúSoylent Green is ‚Äì !‚Äù But I‚Äôm not going to *tell* you what Soylent Green is, dear reader ‚Äì even though chances are you already know. What I am going to do, rather ‚Äì with a copy before me of the original 1973 Soylent Green movie tie-in edition of Harry Harrison‚Äôs 1966 novel Make Room! Make Room! ‚Äì is offer a meditation on how the novel and the film, taken together, offer intriguing variations on the premise of a police procedural set within a vastly overpopulated New York City of the near future. This year of 2022 ‚Äì the year in which Soylent Green is set ‚Äì seems a good time for reflections of this sort.\n\nOutside the science-fiction community, author Harry Harrison might not be as well-known as other 20th-century science fiction writers ‚Äì Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Philip K. Dick, Robert A. Heinlein, Frank Herbert ‚Äì but within the SF (*not* ‚Äúsci-fi‚Äù) community, he was popular, and his work was well-loved. There are plenty of SF buffs of the present day who still turn with pleasure to Harrison‚Äôs ‚ÄúStainless Steel Rat‚Äù series of picaresque semi-comic novels about a raffish thief and con artist who nonetheless wins the reader‚Äôs sympathy because of the way he lives by a discernible moral code. Outside the SF community, by contrast, Harrison is almost certainly best-known for Make Room! Make Room!, a work that may have had its inspiration in the then-widespread anxiety regarding overpopulation.\n\nMake Room! Make Room! begins on August 9, 1999 ‚Äì at which time, the author tells us, ‚Äúthere are ‚Äì give or take a few thousand ‚Äì thirty-five million people in the city of New York‚Äù (p. 6). It is understandable that Harrison might have been anxious about such a scenario unfolding; he had clearly done his homework, as a list of ‚ÄúSuggestions for Further Reading‚Äù at the book‚Äôs end lists no less than 39 books on the topic of overpopulation, including works by Bruno Bettelheim, Erich Fromm, John Kenneth Galbraith, Arthur Koestler, and Harrison Salisbury.\n\nNew York in the August 1999 of Make Room! Make Room! is a bleak place indeed. Overpopulation has caused the world‚Äôs food supply, and energy supply, to crash. Vast numbers of unemployed people crowd the streets. Parking-lots full of dead cars provide last-ditch housing for the city's many impoverished and jobless people; others simply sleep outdoors. In place of taxis, rickshaw-style ‚Äúpedicabs‚Äù take the relatively fortunate from one place to another. And fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, and particularly fresh meat are out-of-reach luxuries for all but the super-wealthy. The best that one can hope for ‚Äì and just the rumor of this food‚Äôs availability is enough to start a riot at the local market ‚Äì is a shipment of ‚Äúsoybean and lentil steaks‚Äù (p. 21) ‚Äì soylent.\n\nThe novel‚Äôs protagonist is Detective Andy Rusch of New York‚Äôs 12-A Precinct, who is abruptly pulled off his already excessive caseload of unsolved crimes and sent to investigate the murder of one Michael O‚ÄôBrien, at the upscale Chelsea Park North apartments on West 28th Street. O‚ÄôBrien was one of those few fortunate wealthy who could live in relative comfort; in a nice touch, Harrison gives this apartment building ‚Äúcrenellated battlements and towers‚Äù (p. 51), and even a drawbridge, as if to emphasize how late 20th-century American society has reverted to a medieval state.\n\nBut O‚ÄôBrien is dead, murdered with a tire iron; and because O‚ÄôBrien was a mobster with ties to the power elite of New York, Rusch is put under considerable pressure to solve the case quickly. Other things that make this case different, for Rusch, include the novel experience of the air-conditioning system in O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs apartment ‚Äì ‚Äúcool air surged out, fresh on Andy‚Äôs face‚Äù, and ‚ÄúEvery minute in the air-conditioned room made Andy feel better‚Äù (pp. 51, 53) ‚Äì and the presence of O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs beautiful young mistress Shirl. Both Andy and Shirl are truly outsiders in O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs world, and soon they become lovers, sharing a stolen season in the brief time before O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs relatives are able to claim his apartment and possessions.\n\nA person of interest in the O‚ÄôBrien murder case is one Billy Chung, a young Taiwanese American whose history reflects more of the trauma that Harrison‚Äôs near-future New York City has endured. Billy and his family live in ‚ÄúShiptown,‚Äù a harbor area of derelict ships whose cabins provide homes for thousands of Taiwanese refugees displaced from their island home when the Taiwanese government made an ill-advised decision to invade mainland China. Billy sometimes likes to dream that his derelict-ship home is an actual working ship, out somewhere on the high seas, with him as the ship‚Äôs captain, and the crew ‚Äúdown below on the decks doing all the things a good crew did while he guided the ship up here for all of them‚Äù (p. 100). But a series of bad choices that Billy makes in the course of his day-to-day attempts to scratch out a living make it seem increasingly likely that his path and that of detective Andy Rusch will one day intersect.\n\nOne of the most interesting features of Make Room! Make Room! ‚Äì and something that I wish author Harrison had provided more of ‚Äì is the way the novel provides occasional glimpses of the world beyond New York City. Once O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs apartment is closed off to Andy and Shirl, Shirl moves in with Andy and Andy‚Äôs roommate Sol ‚Äì an older man who can provide testimony regarding the way the world was before the population crisis began. While Andy is off on his seemingly hopeless search for the perpetrator of the O‚ÄôBrien murder, Sol tells Shirl why moving away from New York would not solve anyone‚Äôs problems:\n\n‚Äú[T]here‚Äôs no place to go. This whole country is one big farm and one big appetite. There‚Äôs just as many people down South as there is up North and, since there is no public transportation, anyone who tried to walk to the land of sunshine would starve to death long before he got there. People stay put because the country is organized to take care of them where they are. They don‚Äôt eat well, but at least they eat. It needs a big catastrophe like the water failures in the California valleys to move people out, or the Dust Bowl ‚Äì which I hear has now become international and crossed the Canadian border.‚Äù (p. 131)\n\nWhen Shirl protests that things must be better in some other part of the world, Sol indicates that there is no hope to be found in the prospect of international relocation:\n\n‚ÄúAll of England is just one big city and I saw on TV where the last Tory got shot defending the last grouse woods when they came to plow it up. Or you want to go to Russia maybe? Or China? They been having a border war for fifteen years now, which is one way of keeping the population down ‚Äì but you‚Äôre draft age and they draft girls there, so you wouldn‚Äôt like that. Denmark, maybe. Life is great there if you can get in ‚Äì at least they eat regular ‚Äì but they got a concrete wall right across Jutland and beach guards who shoot on sight because so many starving people keep trying to break into the promised land.‚Äù (p. 131)\n\nOne of the striking features of Make Room! Make Room! is that, unlike other dystopias like 1984 or The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale, it is not a story of a government tyranny. A democratic form of government still seems to be in place ‚Äì there is a ‚ÄúPresident‚Äôs Emergency Food Planning Board‚Äù (p. 143), and the Congress is debating population-control bills ‚Äì but the population crisis has clearly moved beyond the government‚Äôs ability to deal with the problem in any meaningful way.\n\nAnd it is here that one of the least desirable features of Make Room! Make Room! makes itself apparent, as Sol becomes, all too clearly, a mouthpiece for author Harrison‚Äôs strongly held feelings regarding the birth-control issue. To Andy, Sol angrily denounces the futility of the U.S. Senate‚Äôs attempts to pass an emergency bill, when, as he sees it, the real issue is ‚ÄúBirth control, that‚Äôs what. They are finally getting around to legalizing clinics that will be open to anyone ‚Äì married or not ‚Äì and making it a law that all mothers must be supplied with birth-control information. Boy, are we going to hear some howling when the bluenoses find out about that!‚Äù (p. 155)\n\nIn a later conversation with Shirl (whose attitude toward birth control reflects her Catholic upbringing), character Sol becomes even more transparently a mouthpiece for novelist Harrison‚Äôs feelings regarding the birth-control issue, while Shirl becomes little more than a straw woman whose objections Sol systematically demolishes. When Shirl refers to the proposed Emergency Bill as a ‚ÄúBaby-Killer Bill,‚Äù Sol insists that ‚ÄúYou know well enough that birth control has nothing to do with killing babies. In fact, it saves them. Which is the bigger crime ‚Äì letting kids die of disease and starvation, or seeing that the unwanted ones don‚Äôt get born in the first place?‚Äù (p. 159)\n\nAnd when Shirl tries to suggest that birth control is somehow a violation of natural law, Sol sarcastically replies that ‚ÄúDarling, the history of medicine is the history of the violation of natural law. The Church ‚Äì and that includes the Protestant as well as the Catholic ‚Äì tried to stop the use of anesthetics because it was ‚Äònatural law‚Äô for a woman to have pain while giving birth. And it was natural law for people to die of sickness. And natural law that the body not be opened and repaired. There was even a guy named Bruno [Italian scientist Giordano Bruno] that got burned at the stake because he didn‚Äôt believe in absolute truth and natural laws like these. Everything was against natural law once, and now birth control has got to join the rest‚Äù (pp. 159-60).\n\nSol's frustration with resistance to birth control -- and, perhaps, author Harrison's -- may reflect the fact that, just one year before the publication of Make Room! Make Room!, the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled, in Griswold vs. Connecticut (1965), that the state of Connecticut could no longer criminalize birth control for married couples.\n\nThink about that for a moment. An important state of the American Union -- today, one of the most progressive and affluent states of the U.S.A. -- had gone to the highest court in the land to defend its \"right\" to declare that a husband and wife could not decide for themselves how many children they wanted to have. A married couple, under the laws that prevailed in Connecticut (the \"Constitution State\"!) before 1965, could not have sex without facing the possibility of a pregnancy, and could not use birth control without having to worry about a bedroom raid by Hartford or New Haven police officers. With such outdated laws, and such medieval thinking, at work in American life, at a time when the United States of America was reaching for the stars (or at least the moon), it's no wonder if author Harrison was angry regarding the birth-control issue.\n\nPerhaps because some of Sol‚Äôs reflections might seem anti-Catholic, as when he says that ‚ÄúI suppose we can mostly blame the Catholics‚Äù for the problems of overpopulation in his world, and insists that the Catholic Church should ‚Äúaccept the thing [meaning the necessity of birth control] and give the suffering human race a break‚Äù (p. 175), Harrison makes a point of giving his novel a sympathetically rendered, religiously devout character. Named (appropriately) Peter, this character tries to reconcile his religious beliefs with the brutal realities of the world he sees around him.\n\nEncountering Detective Andy Rusch in Times Square as New York City prepares to celebrate the transition from 1999 over to 2000 (and you thought the Y2K computer problems were a bother), Peter quotes the well-known passages from Revelation about an end to death and sorrow and tears, about Jesus Christ making all things new. A tired and embittered Andy tells Peter that nothing has changed; the millennium has not come yet.\n\n‚ÄúNothing changed?‚Äù Peter shouted. ‚ÄúIt is Armageddon, it must be.‚Äù Terrified, he pulled his arm from Andy‚Äôs grip and started away, and then turned back when he had only gone a pace.\n\n‚ÄúIt must end,‚Äù he called in a tortured voice. ‚ÄúCan this world go on for another thousand years, like this? LIKE THIS?‚Äù Then people came between them and he was gone. (p. 200)\n\nDetective Andy Rusch has no answer to Peter‚Äôs expression of anguish. Neither, the reader senses, does novelist Harry Harrison.\n\nWatching Soylent Green after reading Make Room! Make Room!, I found that both works have their merits. It is not, for me, a matter of one being better than the other; it is more like a case of comparably interesting variations on a theme. Indeed, in some ways Soylent Green has a plotline whose elements are more tightly interwoven than is the case in Harrison‚Äôs novel.\n\nIn Richard Fleischer‚Äôs 1973 film, the detective protagonist is not named Rusch, but rather Thorn. As in the novel, the detective protagonist has a roommate named Sol; but now, Solomon Roth is a ‚Äúbook,‚Äù a college professor turned research assistant whose job is to gather evidence for Thorn‚Äôs investigations. The murder victim this time is named Simonson, and his murder is deliberate, not random; it turns out that he is an executive for the Soylent corporation that provides the movie‚Äôs overpopulated society with ‚ÄúSoylent Green‚Äù crackers that are supposedly made from plankton gathered from the world‚Äôs oceans. Shirl is in the movie, too, but now she is called ‚Äúfurniture‚Äù; beautiful women are provided as living accessories to luxury apartments for ultra-wealthy men.\n\nThe dehumanizing references to intellectuals as ‚Äúbooks,‚Äù and to women as ‚Äúfurniture,‚Äù are reinforced by the methods of crowd control dramatized in the film. In Harrison's novel, the regular food riots by starving and infuriated New Yorkers are controlled by self-activating barbed wire that is dropped from helicopters; in Fleischer's film, riot control is administered by \"scoops\" -- dump trucks with bulldozer-style blades that scoop up rioters and dump them into the truck bed, as if these hungry people were dirt or debris or garbage. These instances of dehumanization foreshadow the movie‚Äôs ‚Äúbig reveal‚Äù regarding the actual source of Soylent Green ‚Äì a powerful metaphor for a society that is devouring itself. At a 50-year remove from the release of the film, it is easy to forget how troubling the movie‚Äôs surprise ending was for viewers of the time.\n\nToday, the world population is actually larger than what novelist Harrison anticipated; according to the United Nations, the population surpassed 8 billion in November of this year. But the nightmare scenario of Make Room! Make Room! and Soylent Green has not become a reality ‚Äì yet.\n\nOctober 1, 2018\n\nOddly enough, I kinda expected something hokey before I read this, but instead, I just got a dystopian nightmare of overpopulation.\n\nThis isn't unexpected or a bad thing. After all, I've seen Soylent Green and felt the huge impact of the scene where the old man Saul mouths the BIG SECRET through the plane of glass. I remember the riots, the pressure, the senseless violence, and the massive levels of injustice AND stupidity that brought us to this state.\n\nAnd yet, after reading this novel, that sense is more visceral, more realistic, and a lot less sensational. Yes, there's massive injustice. Just look at the Squatter law that gives priority to squalid massive families regardless of any consideration, or the way no detective is able to do his job because life is already worthless.\n\nFor '66, this nightmare world that has used up all resources by 1999 and has ignored or actively fought all birth control or warnings, has resorted to sticking its head in the sand.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nWell, fortunately, our modern world is getting well-adjusted to living with less... and less... and some technologies are letting us live with a bit less squalor than predicted in this novel... and a New York City of 35 million in the novel is pretty damn close to what some cities are reaching now, true, but the quality of life is NOT as bad as predicted in Harrison's novel.\n\nOf course, in some ways, the violence, the poverty, and the cultural clamp-downs are WORSE in our world. It's odd to see our 7.7 billion people displayed against the novel's measly 7.0 billion. And yet... it's interesting because most of the world is a dustbowl and the only place to safely live .. on the dole .. is the big cities, so everyone migrates there.\n\nI'm just saying this is a really fascinating world-building exercise. I love books that predict or fail to predict in really big ways. :)\n\nDoes anyone want any meat flakes? It's just snails... right? Yum, yum.\n\nApril 2, 2012\n\nGood morning class! Now, hands up everyone who knows what Soylent Green is made of. Ah, that's very good. I'm glad to see you read your assignment.\n\nI'm sorry, we're not quite finished yet. What is the book's original title? No, of course it isn't a trick question. You should have read it a little more carefully...\n\nFebruary 5, 2016\n\nOf course I remember the movie Soylent Green. I saw it at the drive-in gazillions of years ago, and many times since. But let me tell you, as dramatic as the movie is, with Charlton Heston as main character Andy Rusch giving the infamous scream of Soylent Green is PEOPLE!! there is actually no soylent green in the book at all. There are red crackers, seaweed crackers, brown soylent (soy/lentil) steaks and eventually small soylent burgers supposedly with a smoky-barbecue flavor. So there is no eating of people here. There is not much eating of anything, because there is simply not much food. Or water. Or electricity. Or personal space. And this makes the book feel much more terrifying, because it is easier to imagine our world becoming exactly like Harrison's New York City.\n\nWritten in 1966, the story takes place during the last six months of 1999. Okay, we do all know that the world survived the big leap from the year 1999 to the year 2000. But Harrison's dedication shows us what he was concerned about at the time he wrote this book. To Todd and Moria ~~ For your sakes, children, I hope this proves to be a work of fiction.\n\nThere are 35 million people in New York City. Andy Rusch is one of them. He is a detective on the police force, sharing living space with an old man named Solomon Kahn. Andy is assigned to investigate a homicide, and at first it seems to be cut and dried, another case to be dealt with as quickly as possible and forgotten. But due to a bit of paranoia and misinterpretation on the part of certain people in control of things behind the scenes, pressure is put on the police force to find the killer, not simply to mark the case closed without a proper investigation. In the process of his more thorough detective work, Andy gets to know the victim's girlfriend Shirl, who becomes very important in his own life. The reader spends time with the killer, we even see him commit the crime, but does Andy ever catch him?\n\nBut the police procedure is only a tiny part of the story. The main theme is the lack of everything that makes a city a decent place to live. Water and food rations are small and often cut. Electricity is iffy, there are no cars on the streets, but they do fill once-vacant lots where homeless people crowd into their abandoned bodies for shelter. Of course some people do manage to live in air-conditioned luxury, and even buy beef from the meatleggers. There are always people who can get you things for the right price and others who have that price. Overall the feel of the book is grimy, hot, sticky,\n\nhopeless, and extremely crowded.\n\nSolomon spends time in the second part of the book talking about why the country has turned out the way it has, and his words feel like something we could be hearing today. Or perhaps should be hearing today. As I said earlier, it is very easy to imagine our world becoming Andy's world. A few natural disasters, a little more climate change, one or two dozen more crooked politicians, lots and lots of more people and there we are.\n\nI agree with Harrison's wish in his dedication. However, it does seem that we are well on the way to making this statement by Solomon a reality:\n\nOne time we had the whole world in our hands, but we ate it and burned it and it's gone now.\n\nFebruary 19, 2018\n\nSigh... Where to begin? This is my second, and probably last Harry Harrison novel. I know that he's considered one of the best science fiction writers of his time, and I can't disagree... But it's not his time anymore, and in my opinion, his writing just doesn't stand the test of time. He shouldn't feel too offended though, this opinion applies to quite a few writers whose work shows its age, and not in a George Clooney \"Gets Better With\" kind of way.\n\nThe ideas and concepts I can appreciate. The overcrowding, the overpopulation, the over-consumption and the warnings to future us to not let it happen that way... This stuff I can appreciate. My favorite parts of the book were Sol's railing against the anti-birth control agenda, and Peter the homeless preacher's despair at it NOT being the end of the world when the clock strikes midnight on Jan 1, 2000. \"A thousand more years of THIS??\"\n\nThese bits were the most real and tangible and human parts of the book for me. The rest was just set dressing... Or outdated attitudes that irritated me more and more as the book went on.\n\nSexism and misogyny, racism, classism... I have a hard time ignoring these things just because the book is 50 years old and things were different then. My thinking is, if Harrison was so ahead of his time thinking about overpopulation and a woman's right to choose whether to have kids or not, then he should also... I dunno, not objectify and make it out that their only value lies between their legs. Woman after woman was described as greedy, hard, cold, and bitchy... And also, coincidentally, usually overweight and lazy, too. Except Shirl, who was exceptionally beautiful... And who sells herself because that's what beautiful girls do in a hard world. There is apparently no other work or options. Fuck for money and place and privilege, or barely subsist on rations and \"love\". Maybe if her ass got a job and didn't sit at home like a suburban housewife, they might've had an easier time of life, and she wouldn't have been so resentful of Andy being gone 20 hours a day DOING HIS JOB. Ugh.\n\nI just expect a bit more from someone who seems to think, in both of the books I've read of Harrison's, that women are capable and equal to men, but in every action writes them the exact opposite way. It bugs me.\n\nAnd let's not even start the rant on how Asians were depicted. FML. \"Chink\" this and \"chink\" that. SERIOUSLY. I can't get down with that shit.\n\nI seriously never thought I'd ever say that my favorite parts of a book would be the PREACHY bits. Wow.\n\nAnyway. So. Everyone sign up for the Voluntary Human Extinction Project... Or more realistically... Lobby your representatives for better birth control options - and NOT just for women - and safe abortion facilities, because, last I checked, it is still legal in the US, though some would rather unwanted babies be born to families that can't support them. Because that makes sense. Grrr...\n\nPlan your families... We have the technology. Or we overpopulate and consume even more than we do now, and everyone in our children's or grandchildren's future suffers.\n\nThat is all.\n\nJuly 16, 2024\n\n‚ÄúOne time we had the whole world in our hands, but we ate it and burned it and it‚Äôs gone now.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe got a plague of people, a disease of people infesting the world. We got more people who are living longer. Less people have to be born, that‚Äôs the answer.‚Äù\n\nThese two sentences could be from any current eco-thriller, but in fact they were written in 1966 by Harry Harrison, in one of the most prescient Sci-Fi novels I have ever read: Make Room! Make Room! Overpopulation was not yet thought to be a worry, but much later Harry Harrison explained:\n\n‚ÄúIt was really the first book, fiction or nonfiction, about overpopulation. The idea came from an Indian I met after the war, in 1946. He told me, ‚ÄòOverpopulation is the big problem coming up in the world,‚Äô (nobody had ever heard of it in those days) and he said, ‚ÄòWant to make a lot of money, Harry? You have to import rubber contraceptives to India.‚Äô I didn‚Äôt mind making money, but I didn‚Äôt want to be the rubber king of India!\n\n‚Ä¶ But I started reading a bit about overpopulation, and got the idea for the book. It stayed in my head as I watched the population trend going the wrong way.‚Äù\n\nJust two years later Dr. Paul Ehrlich was to publish his enormously popular ‚ÄúThe Population Bomb‚Äù, which sat on my shelves for decades depressing the heck out of me, and‚Äîalong with a couple of other seminal works‚Äîinforming my life choices. It was a deliberately confrontational popular book, using shock tactics with what sometimes amounted to a hectoring tone. Some of the statistics Paul Ehrlich used for this have been shown to be flawed, because one research study he used was suspect, but too often now it is conveniently dismissed as alarmist. Many of the predictions and much of the data was sound; only the lengths of time were premature.\n\nThe fact remains that ‚ÄúThe Population Bomb‚Äù alerted the world to an insidious problem, and one we have yet to solve, despite the populations in many wealthy Western nations now being relatively stable. The birth rate in these ‚Äúfirst world‚Äù countries has levelled off to the point where we are approaching zero population growth; the number of people remains stable because births and deaths occur at similar rates. However, populations are still rising in underdeveloped countries. Yet those poorer nations are the lowest consumers of the Earth‚Äôs bounty; it is the technology and commodity-driven developed countries which gobble up far more of the resources. And in many impoverished nations, where birth control is shunned, the population continues to grow at an alarming rate.\n\nIt may be startling to some reading Make Room! Make Room! now, to realise that the contraceptive pill had only been legalised in the United States in 1965, just one year before this novel was published, and that some other forms of contraception only came to be legalised in the next decade. In the UK, ‚Äúthe pill‚Äù had been available on the NHS since 1961, prescribed by some doctors and the family planning organisation. Even so it was still new, and there was not automatic entitlement; some individuals and religious groups made vociferous objections. In Make Room! Make Room! the US government positively encourages everyone to have more and more children, despite there being no way of sustaining the ever-increasing population, and the global population has reached seven billion people, which must have been an almost unimaginable number for 1966.\n\nThe location of New York was deliberately chosen. The author was born and grew up in New York‚Äîalthough until recently I had mistakenly thought he was English. Harry Harrison did live here for 30 years, which is perhaps why. New York is a good choice of setting: the archetypal large city in a prosperous industrialised country. It is even fairly familiar to many outside the United States, either through travel or through the media.\n\nHowever, twinned with the problem of New York City‚Äôs rapidly increasing population, there is also another problem. There is not enough food or water for everyone, there is a shortage of resources, and a crumbling infrastructure with all the various systems breaking down.\n\nOveruse of resources leading to a dysfunctional society was already a common enough theme in science fiction. But such fiction was usually set in the distant future. One reason why Harry Harrison‚Äôs idea was so compelling was that he depicted a near-future society: one which many of his readers and their children would live to see. To make environmental issues a necessary consequence of overpopulation was also forward-thinking. He set Make Room! Make Room! just 33 years later, beginning the novel in August 1999, and ending it at the turn of the century.\n\nMake Room! Make Room! is thus a science fiction novel with a serious theme, but it is never boring, as it conveys this by means of a gripping story. There are actually two stories interwoven here, and at one point I realised I was reading what amounted to a gangster thriller! It functions well as a detective novel about a hunt for a killer. The other thread follows a small group of people in New York, but what the characters actually do isn‚Äôt what we focus on. It is watching how each individual reacts, and tries to cope, as their society descends into chaos. What we then have is a addictive and tense story.\n\nThe hero of the novel is a New York detective, thirty year-old Andy Rusch, who shares a tiny one-room apartment with an ‚ÄúEldster‚Äù, called Solomon Kahn. This works really well dramatically, because Sol can remember the old days, before the world became so overcrowded and before resources like water and electricity became so scarce. Therefore he can remember a time which was contemporary for the original readers, and which seems positively idyllic compared with the novel‚Äôs present. It is the Eldsters who are most vocal in their objections, holding marches and rallies in protest‚Äîjust as they did in their youth‚Äîdespite their current fragility and poor health.\n\nSol is a retired engineer, and while Andy Rusch is out at work, Sol pedals his adapted bike to provide extra power for their most valued items: an old television set and a refrigerator. He also grows herbs from precious seeds, and cooks as creative and interesting meals as he is able to, with the basic rations they are allocated of grain, soya and kelp-based processed food and drinks such as ‚Äúkofee‚Äù which is clearly ersatz coffee.\n\nThe description of food made me smile, as textured vegetable protein made from soya beans, various types of spilt and whole lentils, and kelp (a sort of seaweed) as ingredients in vegetarian food were staples of my diet from the mid-70s onwards; it is the American fast-food diet which seems alien. But although the ‚Äúsoylent steaks‚Äù were luxury items in this future world, they were seen as poor substitutes, as the wealthy had access to meat. The stark truth was that most of the population were existing on inadequate rations of grain-based food; I assume something like grits, or Graham crackers, (neither of which are familiar to me).\n\nWe enjoy the witty dialogue between the two, as they spar with each other. It is easy to empathise with each of them, trapped in what is a truly nightmarish future, where merely stepping outside their minimally tolerable shared room might entail stepping over the sick and dying individuals in the streets, and sometimes even their bodies, if they have not been collected.\n\nThe third major character in the novel, and overlapping story is a teenager from Taiwan, Billy Chung, who is invariably mistaken for a Chinese boy by everyone (including Chinese people). His housing seems remarkably prescient to me, because it is the equivalent of Britain‚Äôs shameful ‚Äútemporary‚Äù off-shore barges provided for asylum seekers and refugees. Even the polito-economic justifications seem familiar. Billy‚Äôs daily environment is a disease-ridden, decrepit, death-trap in the future Manhattan, and he resorts to stealing to survive, although he does not share any of the food he steals with his family.\n\nThe basic plot of this story thread is that Billy breaks into a home in a luxury apartment building, having believed that the resident was out. But the man who lives there is in the bathroom, and emerges to catch Billy red-handed. Billy panics and hits Mike O‚ÄôBrien with a jemmy, accidentally killing him, and then runs away. What he does not realise is that ‚ÄúBig Mike‚Äù O‚ÄôBrien was a racketeer: the leader of a Mafia-like gang.\n\nAndy Rusch is brought in to track down Big Mike‚Äôs killer. Most murders in New York are allocated a maximum of 2 weeks before being dropped, but O‚ÄôBrien had friends in high places. Because Billy Chung had scrawled a heart on the window to make sure he broke into the right apartment, senior police officers believe that a rival gang (whose name is Italian for heart) may be trying to muscle in on O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs territory. Andy Rusch is instructed to stay on the case.\n\nHe becomes romantically involved with O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs mistress, Shirl, and she moves into his apartment when a new owner takes over O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs apartment. For a while Rusch, Shirl and Sol all tolerate each other sharing the small apartment\n\nPerhaps because of when it was written, there is a dearth of female characters. Shirl is the only one who has much time devoted to her; we briefly meet a gangster‚Äôs sister and a neighbour, but both of these are there merely to move the plot along, as are a dysfunctional family who argue their ‚Äúsquatters‚Äô rights‚Äù because there are so many children, and are moved into Andy Rusch‚Äôs apartment despite Shirl‚Äôs objections.\n\nThis had been prompted by Sol contracting a fatal dose of pneumonia, after he went on a protest rally. The family had been waiting near the morgue, so that they could claim the dead person‚Äôs living space. Shirl immediately locks herself away, hating these new squatters, and leaves. Andy Rusch spots her at the end, having attached herself to some new rich people.\n\nHe successfully tracks down Billy Chung as the killer of O‚ÄôBrien, but the police are no longer interested, as the theory of a rival gang had fizzled out. Andy Rusch is demoted for disobeying orders. His colleague tells him of a better standard of living well away from New York, but in the end he decides to stay put, and see it out as a uniformed policeman on the beat as the 20th century draws to a close.\n\nThe author writes in a very direct style, and the novel is remarkably engaging, considering its understated opening, descriptions of hopeless squalor and its bleak ending. We see the contrasts with the privileged, wealthy folk living in style and partying in their apartment blocks, with ample fine foods and wines, and rare luxuries such as air conditioning and running water for showers.\n\nHarry Harrison did a fair amount of research himself before writing Make Room! Make Room! extrapolating from the data available in 1966 about the United States‚Äô food resources relative to its population size. By these means Harry Harrison painted a vivid picture of what the world would be like when it has to support such a massive population. He makes us feel the reality of what living in this future dying world might be like for ordinary people. Interestingly, Paul Ehrlich was to write an introduction to the novel for one of the later American editions.\n\nHowever, there is always a sense of disconnect reading any story which was set in the near future, when we have already passed that time a while ago. Quite a few readers now would not have even been born at that ‚Äúfuture‚Äù time. As Harry Harrison wrote in an afterword in 2005:\n\n‚ÄúWe are now living in the world that I wrote about then; the future has arrived. But how right were my predictions?\n\nPretty bad in some of the details. I have never believed that science fiction predicts the future. It does not. There are predictions made in the literature, but they are hunches, guesses, hopes.‚Äù\n\nAs I read this, and his comment on what had not come to pass, I was thinking that these were trivial details, and that the main thrust of his novel was spot on. Then I read:\n\n‚ÄúUnhappily for mankind the population details, food shortages and oil consumption I wrote about have proven to be too horribly correct. We live now with ever decreasing supplies of petroleum. Prices have gone up‚Äîand they will never come down again‚Äîas world supplies are depleted and used up. Right around the world our ever-growing population is already running out of food. Starvation on a global scale is already here.‚Äù\n\nThe end of the novel marks the start of the 21st century, when the population of the United States has just hit 344 million people. This must have seemed almost unimaginable back in 1966, when the United States population was approaching 192 million people. But in reality in 2011, the world‚Äôs population passed the seven billion mark, and by 2023, it had reached almost 340 million people in the United States alone. Harry Harrison may not think he was predicting the future we were destined to have, but he was not that far off.\n\nMake Room! Make Room! marked a change of direction for Harry Harrison, who had been more involved in writing space operas until then. In fact his connection with Sci-Fi began when he left the Army, bored and disillusioned, to study Art. He became a commercial artist, and by the end of the 1940s he was running a small studio which specialised in selling illustrations to comics and science-fiction magazines. For years he had thought of himself as a commercial artist rather than a writer.\n\nHarry Harrison then moved on to editing some of the magazines he sold, and writing for science-fiction magazines, moving initially to Mexico and Britain, and from there to Italy, and then to Denmark, staying for seven years, before moving to California. By the mid-1970s he was back in the UK, and Ireland, and remained in the UK as I mentioned for 30 years. Yet it is difficult to imagine a more American feel to a novel than that of Make Room! Make Room.\n\nIn 1965, just a year before Make Room Make Room was published Harry Harrison and the British writer Brian Aldiss published the first issue of the world‚Äôs first serious journal of Sci-Fi criticism, ‚ÄúSF Horizons‚Äù. The two were longstanding friends who shared ideals, and together they worked to improve the way science-fiction literature was published, criticised and understood. They were concerned about deeper issues than Sci-Fi had traditionally been, and went on to edit many anthologies of short stories, each one illustrating the major themes of science fiction.\n\nThis then was the setting for Harry Harrison‚Äôs first serious novel, although the change of tone was an early indicator of his later work. Make Room! Make Room! told a great story whilst exploring the possible consequences on society of both unchecked population growth, and the hoarding of resources by a wealthy minority. Both of these subjects were close to his heart.\n\nI have wondered how to rate this book. In a way the structure is a little too visible. We see that the murder investigation is what Alfred Hitchcock called the macguffin. It keeps us reading, because it sets the events in motion and puts the characters at risk, so that we want to know what happens to them and can observe their reactions. We see that Shirl is really a passive character, there just to react to the others. We see that Sol is the wise seer, and that often his words (spouted at Shirl) are really the author‚Äôs own observations and cautions.\n\nNevertheless Sol is an irresistible character. There are also noble characters with a strong moral code, such as Tab Fielding the bodyguard, who strives to do the right thing but is defeated by his personal commitments. There are out-and-out villains who are out only for themselves, such as the judge, and O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs sister. There are fringe lunatics such as Peter, who eagerly awaits the new millennium, believing that the end of the world is nigh.\n\nEven though it is more than three weeks since I finished reading this book, I cannot get it out of my mind. Part of it has a ‚Äúmale-centred gaze‚Äù, but this is of its time, and mostly reflects the various characters‚Äô attitudes, rather than the author‚Äôs. There is remarkably little stereotyping, and a good ethnic mix. It remains as relevant now as it was when it was first written, as a ground-breaking book. I feel it deserves 5 full stars.\n\nYou watched the film ‚ÄúSoylent Green‚Äù but never read the book it was based on? Well the one film made in 1973 is only a loose adaptation; for instance Billy Chung is played by a white boy with blond hair, which completely misses the point of a perceived immigrant underclass. I can also guarantee that if there is only one thing you remember from the film, you will not find any trace of it in the novel. It is also probably the reason why Harry Harrison rarely talked about the film.\n\nThe advertising material, posters and reviews all blazed the slogan ‚ÄúSoylent Green is Made of People!‚Äù But this is an invention by the filmmakers, deliberately shocking to arrest the public‚Äôs attention. It downgrades the message of the book, making it somehow less realistic, (even though for many ethical vegetarians it may seem hardly less shocking than much factory farming. It seems the next logical step, for a meat-eating society. Would you eat your dog, cat, or pet lamb? No? Why not? Are there any circumstances when you might? But that is a topic for another time and place.)\n\nRead the book! It tackles issues head on, without getting side-tracked by cheap manipulative horror tactics. The reality of this future world is horrific enough without.\n\nSol‚Äôs wisdom:\n\n‚ÄúSo mankind gobbled in a century all the world‚Äôs resources that had taken millions of years to store up, and no one on the top gave a damn or listened to all the voices that were trying to warn them, they just let us overproduce and overconsume until now the oil is gone, the topsoil depleted and washed away, the trees chopped down, the animals extinct, the earth poisoned, and all we have to show for this is seven billion people fighting over the scraps that are left, living a miserable existence‚Äîand still breeding without control. So I say the time has come to stand up and be counted.‚Äù\n\nAnd Harry Harrison‚Äôs:\n\n‚ÄúI am not happy about being correct; I wish it had been the other way around. I wish we had controlled population growth and developed green energy sources.‚Äù\n\nBut he remained optimistic, saying:\n\n‚ÄúPerhaps we still can ‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶ If science fiction can teach us one thing‚Äîit is that we have the power to change.‚Äù\n\nAugust 16, 2022\n\nThe Trust the ScienceTM has made everyone live longer, eliminated diseases and cut child mortality but now the planet has gone to shit and who's to blame, none other than those damn Catholics and their disapproval of cheap, safe&effectiveTM contraception.\n\nIt's not a good detective novel, or a science fiction novel, or even a dystopia novel. Just environmentalist antinatalist crap and worst thing, Soylent Green isn't even made out of people.\n\nMay 13, 2024\n\nMake Room! Make Room! is a dystopian book published in the late 1960s set in New York City in 1999. The city is populated by 35 million people so as you can imagine, it‚Äôs crowded and resources are stretched thin and rationed. The story follows detective Andy Rusch as he investigates a murder case whilst simultaneously struggling to cope with being overworked and different crises (extreme weather, rations cut in half, water points closed up for months, hospitals being crowded and lacking medicine, etc.).\n\nI was a bit surprised reading the book because the synopsis made it sound like the core of the book could be a murder case when, in fact, it was just the overpopulation issue. We get to know the murderer very early in the book and while we follow the case, what matters is the ensemble of characters: Andy, Sol, Shirl, and Billy (and I guess Peter). They all experience scarcity and overpopulation in very different ways. None of them lives through it easily. Shirl‚Äôs case is interesting because her ‚Äòworld‚Äô is perhaps much more comfortable yet it comes with a price she isn‚Äôt happy to pay, so even in her ‚Äòbetter‚Äô case, there are no winners.\n\nI felt the different perspectives colluded in one of Sol‚Äôs last tirades against the government: prepare, prepare, prepare. But his suggestions and what the book proposes as ways to deal with things are quite extreme. I do want to say, I truly adored the dialogue in this book. Sol was my absolute favorite character with brilliant bits like: ‚ÄúFunniest show on earth. They‚Äôre trying to push this Emergency Bill through ‚Äî some emergency, it‚Äôs only been a hundred years in the making ‚Äî and you should hear them talking all around the little points and not mentioning the big ones.‚Äù Or perhaps this one that I think it‚Äôs the core of what Harry Harrison is trying to convey with this book: ‚ÄúWe got death control ‚Äî we got to match it with birth control..‚Äù\n\nMy one reason not to give this a 5 stars is perhaps because it feels dated. Obviously, it was written decades before I was born and I understand that. Yet much of it sat weirdly with me. 1) I don‚Äôt know what my thoughts are about Shirl. She‚Äôs just an uneducated woman who gets lucky after winning a beauty contest and then jumps from man to man, and while I really liked her and I found she looked out for herself‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm not sure about my feelings towards her. 2) This book features things that are problematic now, maybe not then and there (LSD, nuclear facilities, lots of religion first/doomsaying, etc.). 3) I didn‚Äôt find the book racist, though there was racism. (Also as a side note, I recently read Everything That Rises Must Converge: Stories by Flannery O'Connor which was published a year before this one and holy moly that was unreadable because of how racist it was. And in that book, I couldn‚Äôt say if it was the characters or the author).\n\nI‚Äôm reading this with my book club Shine & Shadow and I‚Äôm typically the party pooper who hates everything, so I‚Äôm thrilled to not be the hater this time around. Woop woop.\n\nSeptember 11, 2021\n\n\"The coal that was supposed to last for centuries has all been dug up because so many people wanted to keep warm. And the oil too, there‚Äôs so little left that they can‚Äôt afford to burn it, it‚Äôs got to be turned into chemicals and plastics and stuff. And the rivers ‚Äì who polluted them? The water ‚Äì who drank it? The topsoil ‚Äì who wore it out? Everything has been gobbled up, used up, worn out. What we got left ‚Äì our one natural resource? Old-car lots, that‚Äôs what. Everything else has been used up and all we got to show for it is a couple of billion old cars that are rusting away. One time we had the whole world in our hands, but we ate it and burned it and it‚Äôs gone now.\"\n\nNo thrilling cyberpunk future, here. Just 35 million people piled up on top of eachother in New York City.\n\nThe book doesn't have much of a plot, and is more of an overview of a world rife with overpopulation and near complete exhaustion of natural resources, following a couple of characters in the year 1999, ending with the New Year of 2000.\n\nThe worldbuilding is strong and imaginative, with a strong environmental message, which some will probably find preachy - personally, seeing how awfully we're handling the climate crisis at the moment, we can do with a lot more preaching.\n\nAlso interesting, the movie is only tangentially related to the book - the movie has an actual plot, although the whole soylent green revelation is completely absent from the book.\n\n3.5 stars\n\nOctober 12, 2020\n\nHaving seen the movie Soylent Green at the age of ten or so, back in the seventies, and learned this was the book that inspired it, I immediately tagged it a \"Must Get To.\" I came across a nice hard cover 20 or so years back and let it wait its turn.\n\nI expected it to be different from the film and was pleased of how so. I have found all of Harry Harrison's writing to be above average (from what I have read thus far - not that much actually, only a couple Stainless Steel Rat books, some from the Deathworld series and maybe some other thing or two - it‚Äôs been a while), and his strength is especially high with humour. This 1966 novel set in 1999 has some of that but is definitely not a humorous or a typical Harrison novel. It is anything but uplifting and deals with serious issues from the viewpoint of the mid-sixties. Some of this is a bit dated (I won't list my objections - but they are reflective of the time it was written) but much of it is very relevant and was prophetic of our current time. The main issue was over population, which seems less of a concern today than it was fifty years ago, but he nailed the over exploitation and consumption of resources and the stress on the planet‚Äôs environment: air, land and sea, in spite of multiple warnings from experts. All this infused into a fast paced detective story.\n\nI would easily list it as one of the decade‚Äôs best.\n\nJune 13, 2020\n\nSoylent Green was a favourite film with my father's side of the family. Often referenced and spoken about yet, it wasn't until I was a grown woman that I finally saw it (because my husband was appalled that my 70's film viewing had been so lacking; he considers it to have been a fantastic decade for film). Anyway, upon viewing Soylent Green, I had to concur that it was a great story. So as I am wont to do, I sought out and bought the book. Then it sat in my TBR pile for the last five years waiting to be read. I was in no rush because I already knew the gist of the story. But the joke was on me, you see, because Make Room! Make Room! is seriously not the same story as Soylent Green!\n\nNow, I can accept the story diverging greatly but there was another problem. It was slow and worse, a bit plodding. The murder happens fairly quickly but the investigation often takes complete detours into Andrew (the main character and cop investigating the murder) having it off with Shirl (murdered victim's girlfriend). Unfortunately, Shirl has about as much character development in the film as she does the book. Also, unfortunately, Shirl is in a lot more of the book.\n\nSol appears but is just the old man who shares lodgings with Andrew who also imparts what life was like in the past before the climate and animal life was destroyed and the world wasn't at peak over-population. He's also our lone link to the political goings-on in this hellscape. There's a bill that Congress is to vote on having to do with birth control and Sol explains how birth control could have staved off humanity's rampant consuming that has ravaged the earth. There is no Book or Exchange here but Sol still comes out to be one of the more interesting characters and aspects of the story.\n\nWe also get to meet Billy (who murders Big Mike) and it was his character that I found the most interesting and the best thread of the story. In the film, his character is a literal throw away & I don't even know if his name is mentioned. But here, Billy has a whole life and perspective and quite well conveys the misery and futility of living in this place. I was pulling for him and was sad when he met his end. Also adding an interesting part to his story is that Big Mike was involved in organized crime and his bosses are worried that his murder is the first move on their territory from another syndicate in New Jersey. It's why the investigation is pushed at all because it's made quite clear that no one would care about this murder otherwise. If Billy'd killed any other guy, he'd likely have got away with it.\n\nSo what about Soylent Green? Alas, it's not a thing. Food is scarce but here they eat weedcracker and protein burgers, oatmeal, meat flakes, and if really wealthy, meat from the Meateasy. Lots of people, but not in comestible form.\n\nI'm glad I finally read this. What I enjoyed, I really enjoyed.\n\nFavourite quotes :\n\n\"You‚Äôve got night sticks and you have gas, use them when you have to. You‚Äôve got guns and they‚Äôre best left in their holsters. We don‚Äôt want indiscriminate killing, that only makes things worse.‚Äù\n\n\"But doing something means that people must change, make an effort, use their minds, which is what most people do not like to do.\"\n\n\"I blame the stinking politicians and so-called public leaders who have avoided the issue and covered it up because it was controversial and what the hell, it will be years before it matters and I‚Äôm going to get mine now.\"\n\nSeptember 4, 2013\n\nIt's the future - 1999 in fact! Over 7 billion humans, 35 million of them in New York City where a cop, a gangster's moll and a street kid all collide on their no longer separate searches for food and water security. Shanties, tent cities, people living in ships and cars that can't move because there's no more oil. Sounds like Harrison only got the date wrong...\n\nIt's an odd book tackling the question of over-population back in the 1960s when it seems to have first been taken seriously (though not by policy makers, plainly). The story is told quite seriously which may come as a surprise to folks familiar with Harrison's OTT spoof/satires starring the Stainless Steel Rat and the points are made deftly - except towards the end when one of the characters turns into a talking head and starts handing out lectures about contraception, Catholicism and politics. This spoiled matters somewhat by being too overt and heavy handed. It's also a bit of a shame that the only pleasant female character is the most minor one.\n\nI can't help contrasting this book with A Torrent of Faces in which a future population of 1 Trillion people is postulated. Rather than a dystopian New York there's a world city and no apparent mineral resource problem. Less realistic but more fun...\n\nOctober 2, 2019\n\nMaybe I am being unfair by rating this book 3 stars. It is difficult to read this book and to not think about the movie the whole time. The two are completely different. The bare bones of the plot is similar but that is about it. If you are thinking the book will have a twist ending like the movie, you will be sorely disappointed. . Which might make you think the movie is better than the book. If you can forget about the movie and you like dystopian futures with populations run amok and scarce resources then this is definitely a book you should read.\n\nOctober 29, 2012\n\nA fine piece of science fiction that grabs you from the start with it's world building and high quality writing and entertains for over 200 pages.\n\nSoylent Green might have been people but Make Room! Make Room! is a story about a detective investigating a murder in a future world with a drastic problem with over-population and a lack of natural resources. The detective aspect works as an interesting framing story that allows Harrison to explore the nuances of his world - food riots, vegan diets, welfare state, birth control, physical defects - without the use of mass amounts of exposition or the dreaded info dump. And yet he manages to write real and fully developed characters who interact with this future in their own unique and subtle ways.\n\nDespite being written in 1966 and set in 1999 the entire concept is still incredibly believable and some of the political messages made in the novel still haven't been tackled by our leaders and politicians. This must sit alongside The Death of Grass as one of the most intelligent responses in the science fiction canon to the ecological disaster that threatens our race and planet and best of all it doesn't have its own political agenda offering absurd L.Ron Hubbard like theories as the saviour of civilisation.\n\nI know Harry Harrison from his Stainless Steel Rat and Bill, The Galactic Hero books which seem to specialise in being a bit silly, but this works brings a whole new level of respect to his work. There are aspects of this book that have clearly influenced a lot of writers that came after him, Neal Stephenson builds a similar shiptown in Snow Crash for example and even describes it in much the same way. Yet still I can't bring myself to give it 5 stars. Don't let that dissuade you, this is one that you should definitely not miss if you're a fan of intelligent science fiction.\n\nJuly 29, 2023\n\nTempo fa vidi un film intitolato 2022: i sopravvissuti. Un film molto particolare, dove il problema della sovrappopolazione veniva affrontato in modo a dir poco apocalittico e devastante. Cos√¨ m'informai e scoprii che era stato tratto da un libro, appunto \"Largo! Largo!\". Fortunatamente lo trovai in una libreria dell'usato a poco, oggi √® praticamente introvabile.\n\nLa sovrappopolazione √® una problematica molto sentita oggi nel 2023, negli anni '60 del secolo scorso, periodo in cui √® stato scritto il romanzo, era solo una prospettiva di disastro, che poi √® effettivamente accaduta, anzi anche peggiore del previsto. Il problema non √® soltanto numerico, certo pi√π persone ci sono e pi√π risorse sono necessarie al loro sostentamento, ma l'ago della bilancia √® che siamo in tanti e troppo ingombranti, consumiamo troppo e creiamo tanti di quei rifiuti che solo a pensarci, seriamente, dovrebbe farci accapponare la pelle. Per esempio: circa il 30% del cibo che portiamo sulle nostre tavole va a finire nel bidone della spazzatura, fatto che dovrebbe indignarci, ma facciamo finta di niente, perch√® la problematica ancora non ci tange pi√π di tanto; un altro esempio sono i rifiuti tossici che spargiamo nell'aria e nella terra. Proviamo a metterci l√¨ in totale silenzio, cerchiamo di isolarci dalla cacofonia urbana e di riflettere su questo assunto... nessun essere vivente farebbe mai del male a se stesso, perch√® immettere gas tossici o stivare rifiuti radioattivi o quant'altro nella terra, vuol dire ammazzarsi con le proprie mani. Invece niente, s√¨ magari c'indignamo per quei 10 minuti di telegiornale, ma poi cambiamo canale su qualcosa di pi√π leggero per non deprimerci troppo, poveri cristi che lavoriamo tutto il tempo, abbiamo bisogno di leggerezza e divertimento, no? Eccheccaz...!\n\nOrmai siamo troppi, questo √® assodato, 8 miliardi: c'√® sempre una parte che vive sotto la soglia della sopravvivenza, sempre circa 30.000 persone, perlopi√π bambini, muoiono di fame, sete e stenti, poi circa 1 miliardo che vive di malnutrizione, malattie ecc... poi ci sono i \"paperoni\", immancabili, altrimenti che societ√† capitalistica sarebbe? Sono sempre meno e sempre pi√π ricchi e potenti. Infine c'√® la mediocrit√†, cio√® quelli che stanno in mezzo, la maggior parte della popolazione, vedono morire migliaia di persone cos√¨, ma girano la testa dall'altra parte e poi guardano con gli occhi lucidi, dal basso verso l'alto, i \"paperoni\", quanto vorrebbero essere al loro posto, caz...!!\n\nIl romanzo √® un poliziesco, ma √® solo di facciata, perch√® il vero obiettivo dell'autore, almeno da come l'ho interpretato io, √® far riflettere sulla problematica ambientale che stiamo vivendo noi ora nel 2023 e che al periodo della stesura, era in divenire o comunque agli albori.\n\nDa recuperare sia il libro che il film, perch√® si completano, creando una serie infinita di quesiti esistenziali, sociali e politici!\n\nNovember 24, 2013\n\nMake Room! Make Room! was the basis for the classic sci-fi flick Soylent Green. Of course, the scene that everyone remembers from the film - Charleston Heston yelling, \"Soylent Green is people!\" at the end - never appears in the book. Sorry, kids, no cannibalism in this rather slow read from the 1960s, but lots of commentary on the dangers of overpopulation.\n\nIt's actually a fairly depressing story about environmental collapse: the food is pretty much gone and it's hot all the time due to global warming (yep, we knew that was coming way back in the '60s. Good thing we got right on it and solved the problem before... oh, wait. Actually, we've done nothing). The situation for everyone is made worse by good old gridlock in Congress. That's actually one of the most darkly comic scenes in the novel: with overpopulation literally crushing the life out of the planet, Congress argues over the \"morality\" of allowing women to use birth control. It would be funny if it wasn't so sad and true to life.\n\nIt's not exactly a page turner and there is little if any redemption for any of the characters involved, but it is an interesting relic from the not-so-old days of old, one that reminds us that there really is nothing new under the sun.\n\nMarch 14, 2018\n\nThis was made in to Solvent Green with very odd cast of Charlton Heston & Edward G Robinson who was famous for playing gangsters it was his last movie & he was very ill when it was made.\n\nMy late mother hated this as was about suicide clinks for old people. She said was in very bad taste.\n\nThe book & the movie are different Harry Harrison famous for his Stainless Steel rat books often did comical books or even black comedy but the move was not comical I found it bit of sour taste special if you know what Green was? Hahaha\n\nApril 24, 2013\n\nConsidering that this classic novel of sci-fi was written in the 1960s, it's still quite a grabber and definitely worth reading. You're welcome to stay here for the short version or click here for the longer one.\n\nThe setting for Make Room! Make Room! is New York City, 1999, well beyond teeming with a population of 35 million people. Food is a precious commodity and water is rationed,except for the rich who have speakeasy-like secret meat markets for their shopping pleasures and can enjoy long showers in their guarded apartments.\n\nOne of the defenders of the people in this overpopulated New York City filled with desperate people is Andy Rusch who lives in a room next to Sol, an elderly man who fills Andy's head with his old stories & opinions. Andy is currently tasked with finding Billy Chung, the murderer of a wealthy criminal named Michael O'Brien, who most of the policemen are glad to see gone. Andy wonders why this guy's death is such a big deal. All he knows is that the word has come down from the politicians that he's to give the case top priority. Overworked, tired, with a little extra food ration for being a cop, he starts his investigation and meets Shirl Greene, girlfriend/mistress to the dead guy, who is about to be tossed out into the streets; Billy Chung manages to find a way to disappear, holing up with a former priest who is waiting for the turn of the millennium, for the new heaven and new earth. Each character represents a different segment of the population; the murder plot is the frame for the real point of this book, which examines the hell of \"an overpopulated future,\" as well as how things got to this state.\n\nWhile some reviewers say that the themes in this novel aren't relevant in today's world, I say a) read it again...you'll find plenty of issues that resonate today, and b) that it is an intriguing look at the looming issues of its time: overpopulation and the failure of the earth to sustain an out-of-control population was a real concern back then. Another prevalent criticism of this book was that it was nothing like the movie Soylent Green -- and failed to mention the secret behind the food. Really? Seriously? This book didn't even go down that path, so why on earth criticize it for something that Hollywood made up after the fact? Even Harrison, as his LA Times obituary notes, thought the film only occasionally \"bore a faint resemblance to the book.\"\n\nWhile Harrison's doom-and-gloom scenario of 35 million people in New York City never came to pass, the book shouldn't just be one you turn your nose up at. According to the author's obituary, Tom Doherty, founder of Tor Books, noted that Harrison saw science fiction as a medium that \"caused people to think about our world and what it could become.‚Äù That's one major reason I read sci-fi, although I have to admit I'm partial to older novels like this one. I liked it, and while maybe it's not the best sf novel I've ever read, it's definitely one I won't forget."
