        "text": "At first glimpse this sci-fi/dystopian novel confounded me. Harry Harrison conveys to me Stainless Steel Rat but the cover says Penguin Modern Classics. Having encountered the Stainless Steel Rat in my youth, (vaguely entertaining at the time, creating no desire to read more than one) the Modern Classic label is failing to convince. There’s that adage about books and covers… The back cover, however, tells a different story. Make Room! Make Room! is the basis for the film Soylent Green. OK. Now that’s interesting.\n\nMake Room! was written in 1966 and set in 1999. Harrison was concerned at the time with overcrowding, the over-taxing of natural resources and depletion of fuel reserves. His extrapolation rings true in many ways, and his vision of a possible future has some nice sci-fi touches. People pedalling like crazy to create electrical power, barbed ‘memory wire’ which writhes across the streets to contain riots, and soylent: a composite food stuff of soya and lentils.\n\nNo, really. It is soya and lentils. The film and the book head off rapidly in different directions, and this is my problem with the novel. Harrison creates a bleak and convincing world, backdrop to a pointless detective story and a failed romance, which neither require nor enhance his dystopian vision.\n\nSci-fi isn’t really my scene. And when I read it I invariably complain about lack of characterisation and bad dialogue. This one ticks both those boxes, and the plot is lacking too.\n\nIn fairness, some of my complaints arise because the book has, inevitably, dated. But although I found some of the arguments in favour of birth control, (an obvious concern in the event of critical over-population), facile and obvious, nonetheless, some of the ignorance that Harrison seeks to refute still exists today.\n\nAnd he doesn’t pull his punches in describing the difficulties of sustaining an ageing population (I did enjoy the Eldster protest marches) described by one of his characters as ‘death control.’ Death control, it is pointed out, is, as birth control, ‘against nature,’ and implementation of the one demands the utilisation of the other.\n\nLet’s finish on a strong note. This sentence I like:\n\n‘The fifth and original borough is Manhattan: a slab of primordial granite and metamorphic rock bounded on all sides by water, squatting like a steel and stone spider in the midst of its web of bridges, tunnels, tubes, cables and ferries. Unable to expand outward, Manhattan has writhed upward, feeding on its own flesh as it tears down the old buildings to replace them with the new, rising higher and still higher – yet never high enough, for there seems to be no limit to the people crowding here.’\n\nUnwise consumption, destructive consumption, unsustainable consumption. Harrison wasn’t wrong."
