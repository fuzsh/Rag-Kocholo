        "text": "About the Book\n\nA classic of dystopian SF--the basis for the movie Soylent Green--returns to print\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nThe world is crowded. Far too crowded. Its starving billions live on lentils, soya beans, and --if they're lucky--the odd starving rat.\n\nIn a New York City groaning under the burden of 35 million inhabitants, detective Andy Rusch is engaged in a desperate and lonely hunt for a killer everyone has forgotten. For even in a world such as this, a policeman can find himself utterly alone.... Acclaimed on its original publication in 1966, Make Room! Make Room! was adapted into the movie Soylent Green in 1973, starring Charlton Heston along with Edward G. Robinson in his last role.\n\nReview Quotes\n\n\"Harrison's fictions constitute one of the main monuments in modern SF.\" --Paul Di Filippo, SciFi.com\n\nAbout the Author"
