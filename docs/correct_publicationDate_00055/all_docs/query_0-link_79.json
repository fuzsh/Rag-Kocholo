        "text": "A seminal work of science fiction- an unnerving vision of the consequences of unchecked overpopulationThe planet's population has exploded. The 35 million inhabitants of New York City run their TVs off pedal power, riot for water, trample for lentil 'steaks', and sweat beneath a sweltering sun. Amid it all, a city cop tries to catch a gangster's killer and vie for the affection of a dangerous woman...Offering a disturbing vision of the future and a groundbreaking exploration of the dangers of overpopulation, Harry Harrison's Make Room! Make Room! is a keystone work of science fiction -- and the basis of the cult film Soylent Green.\n\nHarry Harrison (1925 - 2012) was born in Connecticut and lived in New York City until 1943, before being drafted into the United States military. After WW2, he settled in the United Kingdom.His contribution to science fiction writing is almost unparalleled- Deathworld, the Stainless Steel Rat series, Bill, the Galactic Hero, Stars and Stripes Forever, and West of Eden are all classics of the genre. He received the Nebula Award, the Golden Scroll of the Academy of SF Film, Prix Jules Verne (Sweden) and the Premio Italia. He was also a member of the SF Hall of Fame."
