        "text": "Each spring, Mystery Writers of America present the EdgarÂ® Awards, widely acknowledged to be the most prestigious awards in the genre. This years ceremony was cancelled, but the awards were given to the years best. If you are looking for some of the best offerings in contemporary mystery writing, look no further! Bonus: there's awards for true crime too, one of my personal favorite nonfiction areas.\n\nHere's the press release of this year's winners: http://www.theedgars.com/2020EdgarWinnersPressRelease.pdf\n\nList of nominees and winners: http://www.theedgars.com/nominees.html\n\nGood Girl, Bad Girl : a novel\n\nMichael Robotham\n\neBOOK\n\nMystery\n\nA girl is found hiding in a secret room in a house being renovated after a terrible crime. For weeks she has survived by sneaking out at night, stealing food for herself and two dogs that are kept in the garden. She doesn't appear on any missing person's file, or match the DNA of any murder victim. Six years later, still unidentified, the same girl is living in a secure children's home with a new name, Evie Cormac, when she initiates a court case demanding the right to be released as an adult. Psychologist Cyrus Haven is sent to interview Evie and decide if she's ready to go free, but Evie Cormac is unlike he's anyone he's ever met. She's damaged, destructive, and self-hating, yet possessed of a gift, or a curse, that makes her both fascinating and dangerous to be with--the ability to tell when someone is lying. Soon he is embroiled in her unique and dangerous world, his life in utmost peril."
