        "text": "BIPOC, Latinx, Asian, Pacific Islanders, Native American, and world authors are not new to the scene. They are not “trendy.” They’ve been around for ages. Unfortunately, many teachers (myself included) have not been concerned enough over their representation in the literary canon or the AP* Lit curriculum in general.\n\nFor many of us, that changed in the summer of 2020.\n\nI live in St. Paul, Minnesota. The murder of George Floyd was an eye-opener to the oppression of Black people for many residents in my area and around the world. This is especially true as his murderer, officer Derek Chauvin, used to live just down the road from my own home. I spent the summer of 2020 summer reading and researching racial oppression in my country, both in the past and in the present. It’s true, I am a white woman and that this may be unknown territory for me. However, I have teachers who look to me for guidance. I want to do right. I want to be helpful. This is my best attempt.\n\n*AP® is a trademark registered by the College Board, which is not affiliated with, and does not endorse, this website.\n\nInclusivity in AP® Lit: 2nd Installment\n\nThis is the second installment in a six-part series on inclusivity in AP® English Literature. I use “inclusivity” to refer to both the authors in the curriculum and the students in the classroom, but I’ll expound more on that in a later post. Week 1 focused on re-defining the meaning of “AP® Worthy” when it comes to choosing books. You can read that post here.\n\nThis article is simply a hub to record fiction, plays, novels, poetry, and nonfiction by authors for AP® Lit who are not white. You can use this list to expand your reading list beyond white authors, both personally and for your students. Furthermore, you can use it to explore more works by some of your favorite authors. For example, did you know Zora Neale Hurston wrote stories, poems, and nonfiction? There’s more to most authors than their 1-2 famous works!\n\nHere are some of the best recommendations I can offer, and I will continue to update this list in the future. I’ve included Native American and indigenous authors, Latinx authors, and other authors from Asia, Africa, and around the world.\n\nTo clarify, I have not read all of these texts (can anyone?). However, they are based on the recommendations of AP® English Literature teachers, titles from released AP® English Lit exams or the College Board website. I’ve gathered recommendations from admirable movements and organizations, including #disrupttexts, #thebookchat, and #teachlivingpoets. I’ve also included links to any resources on my TpT site that I have available to help teach these authors if you’re interested.\n\nNovels\n\nAbulhawa, Susan – Mornings in Jenin\n\nAcevedo, Elizabeth – The Poet X and Clap When You Land (novels in verse, both personal favorites)\n\nAchebe, Chinua – Things Fall Apart\n\nAdeyemi, Tomi – Children of Blood and Bone\n\nAdichie, Chimamanda Ngozi – Purple Hibiscus or Americanah\n\nAllende, Isabel – House of Spirits\n\nAlmada, Selva – The Wind That Lays Waste\n\nAlvarez, Julia – How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents or In the Time of the Butterflies\n\nAnaya, Rudolfo – Bless Me, Ultima\n\nBaldwin, James – Giovonni’s Room, Another Country, or Go Tell It on the Mountain\n\nBennett, Brit – The Vanishing Half\n\nButler, Octavia – Parable of the Sower or Kindred\n\nCao, Lan – Monkey Bridge\n\nCisneros, Sandra – The House on Mango Street or Caramelo\n\nChang, Jung – Wild Swans\n\nClarke, Breena – River, Cross My Heart\n\nCleage, Pearl – What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day\n\nCoates, Ta-Nehisi – The Water Dancer\n\nDanticat, Edwidge – Breath, Eyes, Memory, The Farming of Bones, The Dew Breaker\n\nDesai, Kiran – The Inheritance of Loss\n\nDíaz, Junot – The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\n\nDimaline, Cherie – The Marrow Thieves\n\nDivakaruni, Chitra Banerjee – One Amazing Thing (excerpt used in 2020 AP® Lit exam)\n\nEdugyan, Esi – Washington Black\n\nEllison, Ralph – Invisible Man\n\nEng, Tan Twan – The Gift of Rain (excerpt used in 2020 AP® Lit exam)\n\nErdich, Leslie – Love Medicine, Tracks, or Round House\n\nEsquivel, Laura – Like Water For Chocolate\n\nGaines, Ernest – A Gathering of Old Men or A Lesson Before Dying\n\nGyasi, Yaa – Homegoing (personal favorite)\n\nHaley, Alex – Roots: The Saga of an American Family\n\n“I am increasingly convinced that AP® English Literature and Composition by its very nature privileges whiteness and a white view of literature.
