        "text": "Awards ceremonies are back, baby.\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nYes, for the first time since 2019, your favorite writers actually got to dress up and attend a fancy party or two this year. From the Pulitzer to the Booker, the Nebula to the Edgar, here are the winners of the biggest book prizes of 2022.\n\nCongratulations to all!\n\n*\n\nPULITZER PRIZE FOR FICTION\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nAwarded for distinguished fiction published in book form during the year by an American author, preferably dealing with American life.\n\nPrize money: $15,000\n\nThe Netanyahus: An Account of a Minor and Ultimately Even Negligible Episode in the History of a Very Famous Family by Joshua Cohen\n\n(New York Review of Books)\n\n“Cohen has performed a literary miracle of sorts, transforming the shadowy, dour figure of Benzion Netanyahu into the protagonist of an uproariously funny book. In its skewering of the small-mindedness of academic culture, The Netanyahus conjures up the hilarity of David Lodge, and in its piercing gaze and over-the-top, transgressive moves, it evokes the late Philip Roth, who ripped open the soul of the American Jewish parvenu—and that figure’s grinding quest for respectability—like no one else …\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nIt is striking how much Cohen gets right about Netanyahu’s scholarship, the historiographical traditions against which he pushed, and the milieux in which he was formed, particularly the distinctive academic culture of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem … Cohen’s narrator captures something essential about the actual Netanyahu … Cohen lays out the twists and consequences of Netanyahu’s argument with exceptional acuity. But he is equally exceptional in tacking back to the comic.”\n\n–David N. Myers (The Los Angeles Review of Books)\n\nFinalists: Francisco Goldman, Monkey Boy (Grove) · Gayl Jones, Palmares (Beacon)\n\n*\n\nNATIONAL BOOK AWARD\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nRecognizes an outstanding work of literary fiction by a United States citizen.\n\nPrize money: $10,000\n\nThe Rabbit Hutch by Tess Gunty\n\n(Knopf)\n\n“The aspect of unreality—albeit carefully constructed unreality—is central to Ms. Gunty’s presentation of American malaise, which occupies an unstable realm between portraiture and allegory. It is never altogether clear whether her characters are in the grip of some transformative religious awakening or simply suffering from untreated mental illness. The ambiguity is the source of this novel’s remarkable nervous energy. A feeling of genuine crisis—unrooted but ferociously tangible—propels the narrative through its many twists to the catharsis of its bizarre ending …\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nThe tension is not uniformly unflagging. An extended middle section recounting Blandine’s doomed love affair with her high-school music teacher is out of proportion in both length and tone, seeming to belong to a more realistic coming-of-age debut. But this does little to offset the unnerving vision and conviction of the most promising first novel I’ve read this year.”\n\n–Sam Sacks (The Wall Street Journal)\n\nFinalists: Gayl Jones, The Birdcatcher (Beacon) · Jamil Jan Kochai, The Haunting of Hajji Hotak and Other Stories (Viking) · Sarah Thankam Mathews, All This Could Be Different (Viking) · Alejandro Varela, The Town of Babylon (Astra House)\n\n*\n\nBOOKER PRIZE\n\nAwarded for the best original novel written in the English language and published in the UK.\n\nPrize money: £50,000\n\nThe Seven Moons of Maali Almeida by Shehan Karunatilaka\n\n(W. W. Norton & Company)\n\n“By striking contrast, and even if the title promises book-club exotica, The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida is preternaturally irreverent about the manifold brutalities in Sri Lanka during its 26-year civil war … Karunatilaka’s novel breaks with conventional modes of storytelling to reveal humanness in a strange, sprawling, tragic situation … Karunatilaka’s book is supremely confident in its literary heterodoxy, and likewise in offering idiosyncratic particularities of ordinary Sri Lankan life well beyond the serious matters of politics, history, religion and mythology … But readers everywhere will find in such demanding specificity what we all seek from great books: the exciting if overwhelming fullness of an otherwise unknown world told on its own terms, and that frisson of unexpected identification and understanding that comes from working to stay in it.”\n\n–Randy Boyagoda (The New York Times Book Review)\n\nFinalists: NoViolet Bulawayo, Glory (Viking) · Percival Everett, The Trees (Graywolf) · Alan Garner, Treacle Walker (HarperCollins) · Claire Keegan, Small Things Like These (Grove) · Elizabeth Strout, Oh William! (Random House)\n\n*\n\nINTERNATIONAL BOOKER PRIZE\n\nAwarded for a single book in English translation published in the UK.\n\nPrize money: £50,000, divided equally between the author and the translator\n\nTomb of Sand by Geetanjali Shree, tr. from Hindi by Daisy Rockwell\n\n(HarperVia)\n\n“There is no one quite like Ma in contemporary literature, which is perhaps one reason why Shree, along with her translator, Daisy Rockwell, won this year’s International Booker prize … Indeed, in its boldness and experimentation—and in its likelihood of influencing a new generation of authors—this breakthrough novel recalls Shree’s fellow Indian-born Booker laureates, Arundhati Roy in The God of Small Things (1997) and Salman Rushdie in Midnight’s Children (1981) … Geetanjali Shree’s novel—which thoroughly deserves its Booker triumph—also seeks to ask who India belongs to.”\n\n–Sonia Faleiro (Times Literary Supplement)\n\nFinalists: Cursed Bunny by Bora Chung, tr. from Korean by Anton Hur (Algonquin) · A New Name: Septology VI-VII by Jon Fosse, tr. from Norwegian by Damion Searls (Transit) · Heaven by Mieko Kawakami, tr. from Japanese by Sam Bett and David Boyd (Europa Editions) · Elena Knows by Claudia Piñeiro, tr. from Spanish by Frances Riddle (Charco Press) · The Books of Jacob by Olga Tokarczuk, tr. from Polish by Jennifer Croft (Knopf)\n\n*\n\nNATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD\n\nGiven annually to honor outstanding writing and to foster a national conversation about reading, criticism, and literature. Judged by the volunteer directors of the NBCC who are 24 members serving rotating three-year terms, with eight elected annually by the voting members, namely “professional book review editors and book reviewers.”\n\nThe Love Songs of W. E. B. Du Bois by Honoree Fanonne Jeffers\n\n(Harper)\n\n“[A] sweeping, masterly debut novel … Jeffers has deftly crafted a tale of a family whose heritage includes free Blacks, enslaved peoples and Scottish and other white colonialists … Jeffers is an award-winning poet, and she is never doing just one thing with her text … Class and colorism are constant tensions in the novel, and Jeffers expertly renders a world of elite African Americans … The Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois is quite simply the best book that I have read in a very, very long time. I will avoid the cliché of calling it ‘a great American novel.’ Maybe the truest thing I could say is that this is an epic tale of adventure that brings to mind characters you never forget …\n\nThe sign of a great novel is that the author creates a world and when she moves her hands away, the world is still in motion. The idea being that, in the very best novels, every important detail is so lovingly attended to that the novelist’s intention is as invisible and powerful as gravity. The Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois is such a world.”\n\n–Veronica Chambers (The New York Times Book Review)\n\nFinalists: Colson Whitehead, Harlem Shuffle (Doubleday) · Joshua Cohen, The Netanyahus (New York Review of Books) · Rachel Cusk, Second Place (Farrar, Straus and Giroux) · Sarah Hall, Burntcoat(Custom House)\n\n*\n\nKIRKUS PRIZE\n\nChosen from books reviewed by Kirkus Reviews that earned the Kirkus Star.\n\nPrize money: $50,000\n\nTrust by Hernan Diaz\n\n(Riverhead)\n\n[An] enthralling tour de force … Each story talks to the others, and the conversation is both combative and revelatory … As an American epic, Trust gives The Great Gatsby a run for its money … Diaz’s debut, In the Distance, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the PEN/Faulkner Award. Trust fulfills that book’s promise, and then some … Wordplay is Trust’s currency … In Diaz’s accomplished hands we circle ever closer to the black hole at the core of Trust … Trust is a glorious novel about empires and erasures, husbands and wives, staggering fortunes and unspeakable misery … He spins a larger parable, then, plumbing sex and power, causation and complicity. Mostly, though, Trust is a literary page-turner, with a wealth of puns and elegant prose, fun as hell to read.”\n\n–Hamilton Cain (Oprah Daily)\n\nFinalists: Michelle de Kretser, Scary Monsters (Catapult) · Arinze Ifeakandu, God’s Children Are Little Broken Things(Public Space Books) · Susan Straight, Mecca (Farrar, Straus and Giroux) · Yoko Tawada, Scattered All Over the Earth(New Directions) · Olga Tokarczuk, The Books of Jacob (Riverhead)\n\n*\n\nWOMEN’S PRIZE FOR FICTION\n\nAwarded to a female author of any nationality for the best original full-length novel written in English and published in the United Kingdom.\n\nFinalists: Lisa Allen-Agostini, The Bread the Devil Knead (Myriad Editions) · Louise Erdrich, The Sentence (Harper)\n\nMeg Mason, Sorrow and Bliss (Harper Perennial) · Elif Shafak, The Island of Missing Trees (Bloomsbury) · Maggie Shipstead, Great Circle (Knopf) · Morowa Yejidé, Creatures of Passage (Akashic)\n\n*\n\nPEN/FAULKNER AWARD\n\nAwarded to the author of the year’s best work of fiction by a living American citizen.\n\nPrize money: $15,000\n\nThe Wrong End of the Telescope by Rabih Alameddine\n\n(Grove)\n\n“Alameddine’s spectacular novel is rendered through the refreshingly honest lens of Dr. Mina … Dr. Mina is the storyteller the refugees deserve: respected by the Europeans, but steeped in their traditions and history … This is the first novel I’ve read that gives ample room to the ugliness of certain camp volunteers (the bored, the coddled, those battling pangs of uselessness) and the many humiliations some inflict on the displaced. But calling out anyone who gave up a vacation to meet boats seems ungrateful, so the refugees smile for their rescuers’ camera-phones and keep quiet … Alameddine’s irreverent prose evokes the old master storytellers from my own Middle Eastern home, their observations toothy and full of wit, returning always to human absurdity …\n\nAgain and again, Dr. Mina cracks open the strange, funny and cruel social mores of East and West. She shows us that acceptance and rejection exist across borders and often manifest in surprising ways … Throughout the book, Dr. Mina addresses a blocked and disillusioned Lebanese writer who, having seen too much displacement and horror, finally breaks. I found this mysterious unnamed listener deeply poignant.”\n\n–Dina Nayeri (The New York Times Book Review)\n\nFinalists: Nawaaz Ahmed, Radiant Fugitives · Carolyn Ferrell, Dear Miss Metropolitan · Imbolo Mbue, How Beautiful We Were · Carolina de Robertis, The President and the Frog\n\n*\n\nPEN/ROBERT W. BINGHAM PRIZE FOR DEBUT FICTION\n\nAwarded to an exceptionally talented fiction writer whose debut work represents distinguished literary achievement and suggests great promise.\n\nPrize money: $25,000\n\nSkinship by Yoon Choi\n\n(Knopf)\n\n“The impossibility of fully knowing someone else, or indeed oneself (the inevitable lacunae!), is an eternal theme of fiction, framed in infinite ways. The immigrant experience, in which multicultural characters necessarily navigate these gaps, is one such frame, and Yoon Choi’s beautiful debut story collection Skinship (Knopf, $26) uses it to bring a rich and engaging new voice to contemporary American letters. With refreshing amplitude, patience, and (dare I say) wisdom, Choi’s stories explore the complexities of her characters’ diverse experiences … In each story, Choi evokes a world entire, an endeavor that extends beyond content into form.”\n\n–Claire Messud (Harper’s)"
