Now, she’s in the middle of a murder investigation.\n\nTo make everything worse, the neighbors claim Bigfoot is running around and the sheriff looks exactly like one of her main characters. But if anyone knows about death and dismemberment, it’s Tess. And she’s determined to find the murderer before anyone else gets hurt.\n\nNominees: The Lilian Jackson Braun Memorial Award\n\nSign up for the Murder & Mayhem newsletter and get the best mystery and thriller recommendations delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nFeatured photo: Ezra Jeffrey-Comeau / Unsplash"
