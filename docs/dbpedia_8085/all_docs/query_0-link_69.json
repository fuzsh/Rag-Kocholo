        "text": "The National Book Foundation, presenter of the National Book Awards, today announced Paul Yamazaki, principal buyer at City Lights Booksellers & Publishers in San Francisco, California, as the recipient of its 2023 Literarian Award for Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community. Starting out as a part-time clerk at City Lights in 1970, Yamazaki has mentored generations of booksellers, and his collaborative approach to bookselling has elevated countless authors, shaping the United States’ literary landscape for over 50 years. A champion for books, writers, publishers, and independent bookstores, Yamazaki will be presented with the Literarian Award by past recipient and revered bookseller Mitchell Kaplan at the 74th National Book Awards Ceremony & Benefit Dinner on November 15, 2023.\n\n“Paul Yamazaki’s career has had an irreplaceable, culture-shifting impact on bookselling, independent bookstores, and publishing at large,” said David Steinberger, Chair of the Board of Directors of the National Book Foundation. “Over more than five decades, Paul has brought exceptional national and global literature to readers in San Francisco and beyond. Yamazaki’s legacy has demonstrated the power of connecting the right book to the right reader at the right time, both to move book sales and to center voices that better reflect the country’s diversity of readers. The Foundation is gratified to be able to recognize his contributions to the national literary landscape with this lifetime achievement award.”\n\nAn advocate for considering the intersections of race, culture, and socio-economics in bookselling, writing, and publishing, Yamazaki has served on the board of directors of several literary and community arts organizations, including the Community of Literary Magazines & Presses (CLMP), Small Press Distribution (SPD), and the Kearney Street Workshop (KSW). As a bookseller at City Lights, Yamazaki reads widely and is committed to supporting the work of new and established authors across genres, from publishers small and large, in order to appeal to all kinds of readers. Under his stewardship, the bookstore carefully curates a collection of books that includes literary fiction, poetry, works in translation, and more that celebrates what Yamazaki calls “alternative literary voices,” and to which he credits the bookstore’s exceptionally diverse staff handpicking titles that reflect a variety of interests and life experiences.\n\n“A beloved member of the literary community, Paul Yamazaki and his devotion to the art of bookselling have influenced countless booksellers,” said Ruth Dickey, Executive Director of the National Book Foundation. “For over 50 years, Yamazaki has nurtured thoughtful conversations around books with writers, publishers, and readers, and he continues to be an inspiring force for the independent bookstore community. We are proud to celebrate his remarkable career with the 2023 Literarian Award.”\n\nIn the 1960s, Yamazaki participated in the San Francisco State College Strike—the longest student strike in US history that led to the establishment of the College of Ethnic Studies at San Francisco State College; was a vocal supporter of the Black Panther Party; and was arrested multiple times for protesting exclusionary policies and participating in “Stop the Draft” demonstrations, culminating in a six-month prison sentence. Yamazaki was released early after securing a job at City Lights and, as far as Yamazaki knows, is the only independent bookseller to become a bookseller directly after serving a jail sentence.\n\nYamazaki is the 19th recipient of the National Book Foundation’s Literarian Award for Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community, which is given to an individual or organization for a lifetime of achievement in expanding the audience for books and reading. Past recipients include Dr. Maya Angelou, Terry Gross, Kyle Zimmer, the literary organization Cave Canem, Doron Weber, Oren J. Teicher, Carolyn Reidy, Nancy Pearl, and most recently, Tracie D. Hall. Nominations for the Literarian Award are made by former National Book Award Winners, Finalists, and judges, and other writers and literary professionals from around the country. Final selections are made by the National Book Foundation’s Board of Directors. Recipients of the Literarian Award for Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community receive $10,000 and a solid brass medal.\n\nThe 74th National Book Awards will be hosted by Drew Barrymore and feature special guest Oprah Winfrey on Wednesday, November 15, 2023 at Cipriani Wall Street in New York City. The in-person Ceremony & Benefit Dinner, which will be broadcast live for readers everywhere, will include the presentation of the Foundation’s two lifetime achievement awards and the 2023 National Book Award Winners in the categories of Fiction, Nonfiction, Poetry, Translated Literature, and Young People’s Literature.

Programming takes place in Creole, Spanish, and English, reflecting the diversity of Miami.\n\nMitchell, with his partner Paula Mazur, established The Mazur Kaplan Company to bring books to the screen, both in film and television. His most recent release is Let Him Go starring Diane Lane and Kevin Costner.\n\nMitchell also hosts the podcast The Literary Life with Mitchell Kaplan, broadcast from Miami, where he lives with his wife, Rachelle.
