        "text": "Three months ago, I shared the thrilling news that Premeditated Myrtle had been nominated for an Edgar Award by Mystery Writers of America (along with some fun Edgar Allan Poe miscellanea). It’s been a bit of a wait, but last week we learned that not only was it nominated—IT WON!!!\n\nThis year the awards ceremony was all virtual, and they are mailing us the awards, ceramic busts of Edgar Allan Poe:\n\nI am incredibly grateful to MWA, and especially the (still top-secret) judging committee for Best Juvenile Mystery, fellow children’s mystery authors. Chair Bruce Hale (Edgar-nominee for his Chet Gecko series) presented the award:\n\nYou can watch the full awards ceremony here, neatly edited down to the presentations and acceptance speeches. (Best Juvenile is about the 17:30 minute mark. I was relieved it was early on in the program—I don’t think I could have stood the suspense otherwise!)\n\nEveryone has been so excited by the news! (See excited co-host of my acceptance speech, above.) To mark the occasion, I invested in a small (literally) token.\n\nAnd being gloriously on theme…\n\nWe are still riding high from Edgars excitement, and plans are afoot to bedeck the entire house (and apparently your Learned Author) in Poe regalia. (Poe paper dolls, Poe quilt fabric, Poe stickers, Raven buttons, Poe socks… Ahem.) I think this calls for a Cask of Amontillado and a viewing of one of my favorite Edgar Award-winning films, Call Northside 777."
