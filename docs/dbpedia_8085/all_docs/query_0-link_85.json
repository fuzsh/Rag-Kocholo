        "text": "For the first time since 2019, the James Beard Restaurant and Chef Awards ceremony is back in Chicago. Weeks after the James Beard Foundation announced the year’s slate of chef and restaurant finalists, the results are in, and chefs, restaurateurs, and other hospitality-world insiders have gathered at the Lyric Opera of Chicago for the splashy, red carpet event, with chef Kwame Onwuachi as host. (There was even a classic behind-the-scenes cold open, and Onwuachi delivered an opening monologue, complete with a joke about the Oscars slap.)\n\nFollowing the pandemic-induced hiatus and a 2020 controversy that raised questions about the integrity of the awards, the James Beard Foundation has made a number of changes, conducting an audit and subsequently diversifying the committees involved with the judging process. This year, the awards categories are also different than in pre-pandemic years, with an eye towards greater inclusivity.\n\nThe Rising Star Chef of the Year award is now called Emerging Chef. Edgar Rico, chef and co-owner of Austin’s Nixta Taqueria, took home that award, which no longer has any age restrictions. Chef Katie Button’s Asheville restaurant Cúrate won for Outstanding Hospitality, the award that’s taken the place of Outstanding Service and now recognizes a restaurant that makes “efforts to provide a sustainable work culture,” along with public-facing service. Plus, there’s no Outstanding Wine, Spirits, or Beer Professional award this year.\n\nThe regional categories were also shuffled in order to recognize more chefs: California, New York, and Texas now each comprise their own regional Best Chef categories, leaving room for a wider geographical spread of nominees in the West, Northeast, and Southwest categories. The award for California kicked off the regional categories, with Brandon Jew of Mister Jiu’s in San Francisco winning the first Best Chef award of the night. Later, Austin saw another win as Iliana de la Vega of El Naranjo accepted the Best Chef award for Texas. Chintan Pandya won Best Chef: New York State (a category dominated entirely by nominees from New York City) for Dhamaka.\n\nThe foundation’s efforts to highlight diversity have seemingly paid off in the major award categories too. Chai Pani, an Indian street food restaurant in Asheville, won Outstanding Restaurant; Owamni, a Native American restaurant in Minneapolis led by chef Sean Sherman, won Best New Restaurant; and Outstanding Chef went to Mashama Bailey of the Grey in Savannah, Georgia, who said to the crowd, “Thank you for supporting me, and thank you for betting on Black.”\n\nStraight ahead, see the full list of winners.\n\n2022 James Beard Award Chef and Restaurant Winners\n\nOutstanding Chef\n\nMashama Bailey, the Grey, Savannah, Georgia\n\nOutstanding Restaurant\n\nChai Pani, Asheville, North Carolina\n\nOutstanding Restaurateur\n\nChris Bianco, Tratto, Pane Bianco, and Pizzeria Bianco, Phoenix\n\nOutstanding Hospitality\n\nCúrate, Asheville, North Carolina\n\nBest New Restaurant\n\nOwamni, Minneapolis\n\nEmerging Chef\n\nEdgar Rico, Nixta Taqueria, Austin, Texas\n\nOutstanding Baker\n\nDon Guerra, Barrio Bread, Tucson, Arizona\n\nOutstanding Pastry Chef\n\nWarda Bouguettaya, Warda Pâtisserie, Detroit\n\nOutstanding Wine Program\n\nThe Four Horsemen, New York\n\nOutstanding Bar Program\n\nJulep, Houston\n\nBest Chef: California\n\nBrandon Jew, Mister Jiu’s, San Francisco\n\nBest Chef: Southwest (AZ, NM, NV, OK)\n\nFernando Olea, Sazón, Santa Fe, New Mexico\n\nBest Chef: Midwest (IA, KS, MN, MO, NE, ND, SD, WI)\n\nDane Baldwin, the Diplomat, Milwaukee\n\nBest Chef: Mountain (CO, ID, MT, UT, WY)\n\nCaroline Glover, Annette, Aurora, Colorado\n\nBest Chef: Northwest and Pacific (AK, HI, OR, WA)\n\nRobynne Maii, Fête, Honolulu\n\nBest Chef: Texas\n\nIliana de la Vega, El Naranjo, Austin, Texas\n\nBest Chef: Mid-Atlantic (DC, DE, MD, NJ, PA, VA)\n\nCristina Martinez, South Philly Barbacoa, Philadelphia\n\nBest Chef: New York State\n\nChintan Pandya, Dhamaka, New York\n\nBest Chef: South (AL, AR, FL, LA, MS, PR)\n\nAdam Evans, Automatic Seafood and Oysters, Birmingham, Alabama\n\nBest Chef: Southeast (GA, KY, NC, SC, TN, WV)\n\nRicky Moore, Saltbox Seafood Joint, Durham, North Carolina\n\nBest Chef: Northeast (CT, MA, ME, NH, RI, VT)\n\nNisachon Morgan, Saap, Randolph, Vermont\n\nBest Chef: Great Lakes (IL, IN, MI, OH)\n\nErick Williams, Virtue Restaurant & Bar, Chicago\n\nThe following wins were previously announced:\n\nAmerica’s Classics\n\nCasa Vega, Sherman Oaks, California\n\nCorinne’s Place, Camden, New Jersey\n\nSolly’s Grille, Milwaukee\n\nWo Hop, New York\n\nThe Busy Bee Cafe, Atlanta\n\nFlorence’s Restaurant, Oklahoma City\n\n2022 James Beard Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award\n\nMartin Yan\n\n2022 James Beard Humanitarian of the Year\n\nGrace Young\n\n2022 Leadership Awards\n\nMonica Ramirez of Justice for Migrant Women\n\nIrene Li of Mei Mei Dumplings and Prepshift\n\nErika Allen of Urban Growers Collective\n\nMavis-Jay Sanders of Drive Change\n\nThe Media Awards took place on June 11 — read the full winners list here.\n\nDisclosure: Some Vox Media staff members are part of the voting body for the James Beard Foundation Awards."
