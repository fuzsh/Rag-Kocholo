        "text": "Photo credit - Heath Whorton\n\nNationally-bestselling, Edgar Award-winning author Eli Cranor lives and writes from the banks of Lake Dardanelle where he is the \"Writer in Residence\" at Arkansas Tech University.\n\nHe is the author of Don't Know Tough and Ozark Dogs, which were both named \"Best Crime Novels\" of the year by the New York Times, among others.\n\nEli also pens a weekly column, \"Where I'm Writing From\" for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. To book an event or reach out to Eli directly, please use the \"Contact\" page. For signed copies of Eli's novels, please email [email protected].\n\n* Indicates required field\n\nEmail *\n\nI agree to receiving marketing and promotional materials *\n\n​Praise for Broiler\n\nAmazon Top 10 Best of the Month Pick for July\n\nA Minneapolis Star Tribune Best Books of Summer\n\nA Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Recommended Summer Read\n\nCrimeReads Most Anticipated Crime Fiction of 2024\n\nDeadly Pleasures' Most Anticipated Mysteries and Thrillers of 2024\n\n“Eli Cranor is one of the new big 'uns. I don't have the proper term for what he does with words, calm but knowing prose, and nearly Steinbeckian concern for his characters, their woes and petty victories, dreams and shitty jobs. There is conflict and tension and sorrow, but it's his people who stick.”\n\n—Daniel Woodrell, author of Winter's Bone\n\n“This gripping, gritty noir is Upton Sinclair on hormones, the Coen brothers deep-fried.”\n\n--Minneapolis Star Tribune\n\n“Not many writers would draw inspiration from such disparate subjects as postpartum anxiety and the squalid conditions in a chicken plant, and fewer still could do the two together justice, but Eli Cranor does one better: he makes them roar. Broiler is the most powerful kind of crime novel—relentlessly tense, ruthlessly observed, and deeply illuminating. It will sing you a lullaby as it grips you by the throat. I loved this novel.”\n\n—Katie Gutierrez, author of More Than You’ll Ever Know\n\n“Eli Cranor has a restless imagination that serves him—and his readers—well. Broiler is his latest Trojan Horse of a novel, a satisfying hunk of noir that tells us far more about the American South than those endless newspaper think pieces set in diners and gas stations. Want to understand what's going on in the United States right now? Read Eli Cranor.”\n\n—Laura Lippman, New York Times bestselling author of Prom Mom\n\n“Taut, harrowing, and charged with profound insight, Broiler pushes four unforgettable characters to the brim. What happens when hard work isn’t enough? Exploring class, ambition, mobility, and desire, Eli Cranor uses bolts of linguistic electricity to show how the things we want can sometimes blind us.”\n\n—Danya Kukafka, author of Notes on an Execution\n\n“Cranor delivers another top-notch Southern noir . . . Cranor depicts the inhumane conditions of America’s industrial food system with a vividness worthy of Upton Sinclair, and he matches the novel’s gritty realism with an anguishing and suspenseful revenge plot.”\n\n--Publishers Weekly"
