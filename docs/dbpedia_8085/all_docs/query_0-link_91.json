        "text": "Beginning today, the Mariners start a nine-game homestand with the Phillies, Tigers and Mets. Among the 26-man active roster, there will be four new additions, with one face likely familiar to fans at T-Mobile Park. Here is a quick rundown of the four acquisitions made at the trade deadline by the Mariners.\n\nRandy Arozarena­­\n\nAcquired from Tampa Bay in exchange for minor leaguers RHP Brody Hopkins, OF Aidan Smith and a player to be named later.\n\nArozarena debuted in 2019 for St. Louis but jumped onto the scene during the shortened 2020 season with Tampa Bay. The left fielder played in 23 games for the Rays in 2020 en route to winning the AL East Division Title and the American League Championship Series. He was named ALCS MVP after hitting .321 (9x28) with 1 double, 4 home runs and 6 RBI in the 7-game series vs. Houston.\n\nIn 2021, Arozarena was named AL Rookie of the Year over Houston’s Luis Garcia, Texas’ Adolis García and Cleveland’s Emmanuel Clase. He batted .274 (145x529) during his rookie campaign and hit 20 home runs with 20 stolen bases. In 2023, he earned his first All-Star selection, appearing for the American League in Seattle and finishing as runner-up in the 2023 MLB Home Run Derby with 82 home runs.\n\nIn nine career playoff series with the Rays and Cardinals, Arozarena has slashed .336/.414/.690 with an OPS of 1.104. Since the beginning of the 2019 playoffs, his .336 average is the second-best post-season average in the Majors, while his on-base percentage is third-best and slugging is fifth-best.\n\nSince June 1, Arozarena has hit safely in 36 of 49 games with a slash line of .287/.401/.509 and an OPS of .910. His .401 on-base percentage over that time ranks 10th-best in the Majors and fifth-best in the American League. As a member of the Mariners, he has hit .316 (6x19) in five games.\n\nYimi García\n\nAcquired from Toronto in exchange for OF Jonatan Clase and minor league C Jacob Sharp.\n\nA native of Moca, Dominican Republic, García joins the bullpen after having spent parts of 10 MLB seasons with the Dodgers, Marlins, Astros and Blue Jays. Over the past three seasons with Toronto, he is 10–9 with a 3.44 ERA (60 ER, 157.0 IP).\n\nGarcía has been a part of five postseason rosters and was an American League champion in 2021. He made four appearances in the 2021 World Series with a 0.00 ERA over 4.0 innings and opponents batted .077 (1x13) against him.\n\nThis season, he has posted a 36.0% strikeout rate, which is the highest of his career and the seventh-best in the Majors (min. 30.0 IP). Batters this season are hitting .149 (17x114) with a 0.76 WHIP, the lowest average against in his career and second-lowest WHIP.\n\nJustin Turner\n\nAcquired from Toronto in exchange for minor league OF RJ Schreck.\n\nA 16-year MLB veteran, Turner was a two-time All-Star with the Dodgers in 2017 and 2021. The infielder also finished in the top-10 of NL MVP voting on two occasions during his nine-year stint with Los Angeles. Among other awards, he received the prestigious 2022 Roberto Clemente Award for his work on-and-off the field.\n\nHe also has earned several accolades in postseason play as well. In 2017, he was named National League Championship Series co-MVP, alongside Chris Taylor, with Los Angeles after batting .333 (6x18) with 2 home runs and 7 RBI in the five-game series. Years later in the shortened 2020 season, Turner became a World Champion in his third career trip to the World Series.\n\nAmong active players, Turner ranks 11th in games played (1,631) and is tied for 11th in game-winning RBI (112). He returns from north of the border after hitting .257 (77x300) in 90 games during this season with Toronto.\n\nMuch like Arozarena, Turner has been red hot since the beginning of June, batting .306 (44x144) and adding a .399 OBP and a .396 slugging. In the 40 games he has started in since June 1, Turner has reached base in 32 of 40 and had 12 multi-hit games.\n\nJT Chargois\n\nAcquired from Miami in exchange for minor league RHP Will Schomberg.\n\nThe familiar face among the bunch, Chargois spent part of the 2021 season in Seattle. The right-hander has spent time in his career with the Twins, Dodgers, Rays and Marlins organizations as well. In his previous stint with the Mariners, he was 1–0 with a 3.00 ERA (10 ER, 30.0 IP) in 31 appearances.\n\nSince he was last in a Seattle uniform, the reliver has 107 appearances for Tampa Bay and Miami and going 9–1 with a 2.65 ERA (31 ER, 105.0 IP). He was a member of the 2021 Rays ALDS roster and the 2023 Miami NLWC roster. In five playoff appearances, he holds a 0.00 ERA in 4.0 innings pitched."
