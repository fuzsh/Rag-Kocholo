        "text": "Biography\n\nI grew up in Glendale Heights, Illinois. This is a small town in the Northwest suburbs of Chicago. I have been committed to the hospitality industry since I graduated from Glenbard North High School in 1995. Over the years, I have worked for many different hotel flags and management companies. I really enjoy working with people and leading teams to give the ultimate guest experience.\n\nI have been married to my wife Toyia for 9 years, and I have 14 year old son named Edison. We have a dog name Kobe who looks like Toto from the Wizard of Oz. In my spare time, I enjoy running and exercising, reading, drawing, and producing music."
