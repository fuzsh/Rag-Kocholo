        "text": "The award-winning string quartet, Kodak Quartet, is setting the world on fire with their passionate and energetic playing. They are highly regarded for their work with contemporary composers and for presenting traditional works with a contemporary flavor. Kodak Quartet formed in Rochester, New York while attending the Eastman School of Music and are currently based in New York, NY. Kodak's members hail from the US, Canada and France.\n\nThe quartet won the first prize at the 2023 Frances Walton Competition, and was honored with first prize and grand prize at the 2023 Coltman Chamber Music Competition. Their international performance career brings concerts to a great diversity of people, including concerts at Carnegie Hall, Merkin Hall, the Lunenburg Academy of Music Performance, the Banff Centre, and MISQA. They have appeared on KING-FM Classical Northwest and have been featured on NPR Live Sessions. They have also performed for thousands of children at non-traditional performance venues such as school concerts, movie theaters, concert halls, and other outreach programs such as Rob Kapilowâs âWhat Makes it Great?â and James Blachlyâs âListening as Leadership.â\n\nKodak Quartet has performed with GRAMMY-winning artists Time for Three, Kronos Quartet, and JACK Quartet. They have worked with members of the Alban Berg, American, Beethoven, Danel, Juilliard, Pacifica, Verona, and Ying Quartets, among others. The Kodak Quartet is currently the Cuker and Stern Resident String Quartet at the Mannes School of Music."
