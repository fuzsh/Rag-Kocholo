        "text": "The Fall of the House of Usher is filmmaker Mike Flanagan’s gloriously morbid remix of author Edgar Allen Poe’s best-known stories and poems, and it’s winning raves from critics (with a 92 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes). Even those totally unfamiliar with Poe probably found some glimmer of recognition amid the show’s nods to his best-known tales — such as “The Pit and the Pendulum,” “The Raven” and “The Cask of Amontillado” — given how Poe’s stories have threaded through pop culture over the last 175 years or so.\n\nBut even Poe superfans probably couldn’t spot all the references — because there are dozens scattered throughout the show’s eight Gothic episodes.\n\nSo here they are (The Hollywood Reporter compiled this based on notes supplied by the show’s production team — I’m not going to pretend to be this smart; also, there’s always a chance that a few references were nonetheless missed). Note also there are spoilers below, so if you haven’t finished watching the series, which dropped Oct. 12, consider doing that first and then return to this story.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nRoderick Usher (Bruce Greenwood/Zach Gilford) – based on “The Fall of the House of Usher.”\n\nMadeline Usher (Mary McDonnell/Willa Fitzgerald) – based on “The Fall of the House of Usher.”\n\nVerna (Carla Gugino) – her name is an anagram for Raven!\n\nAuguste Dupin (Carl Lumbly) – name comes from Poe’s amateur detective character in three of his tales.\n\nArthur Pym (Mark Hamill) – from “The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym.” His character and story also represent the common theme of comeuppance in Poe’s work.\n\nFrederick Usher (Henry Thomas) – Frederick’s name is taken from the story “Metzengerstein.”\n\nMorella “Morrie” Usher (Crystal Balint) – her name is taken from “Morella.”\n\nLenore (Kyliegh Curran) – name comes from the poem “Lenore” and is used in “The Raven.”\n\nTamerlane Usher (Samantha Sloyan) – her name is taken from “Tamerlane.” Her story of abandoning love for ambition also ties back to this story.\n\nWilliam T Wilson aka “Bill” (Matt Biedel) – name comes from the story “William Wilson.”\n\nVictorine Lafourcade (T’Nia Miller) – her name comes from the story “The Premature Burial.”\n\nCamille L’Espanaye (Kate Siegel) – named after the character from “The Murders of the Rue Morgue.”\n\nNapoleon “Leo” Usher (Rahul Kohli) – his name derives from “The Spectacles.”\n\nProspero “Perry” Usher (Sauriyan Sloyan) – name comes from “The Masque of the Red Death.”\n\nAnnabel Lee (Katie Parker) – based on the poem of the same name and symbolizes the common theme of lost love in Poe’s work.\n\nEPSIODES\n\nEpisode 1: “A Midnight Dreary”\n\nFortunato – the company’s name comes from “The Cask of Amontillado” antagonist (or ill-fated protagonist, depending on your point of view).\n\nDupin is an amateur detective in three of Poe’s stories.\n\nHouse of Usher – Dupin listening to Roderick’s confession throughout the midpoint conversation (present time) is reflective of the narrator in “The Fall of the House of Usher” story.\n\nLongfellow – is named after another poet during Poe’s time.\n\nEliza – is named after Poe’s mother.

The idea being that your mind is uploaded to a ‘cloud’ like database but your body is gone. Came from the discussion after reading ‘The Premature Burial.'”\n\nMadeline’s Egyptian artifacts are references to “Some Words with a Mummy.”\n\nThe Grampus references back to the boat in “The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym.”\n\nFrederick’s claustrophobia ties back to the character in “The Pit and the Pendulum.”\n\nEpisode 3: “The Murders of The Rue Morgue”\n\nCamille’s death is based on “The Murders of The Rue Morgue.”\n\nYoung Roderick recites the poem “Annabel Lee” in dialogue.\n\nVerna’s name tag as the security guard “Le Bon” is used in “Rue Morgue.”\n\nEpisode 4: “The Black Cat”\n\nLeo’s death is based on the story “The Black Cat.”\n\nBrevet – a name used in “The Man Who Was Used Up.”\n\nEpisode 5: “The Tell-Tale Heart”\n\nVictorine’s death is based on “The Tell-Tale Heart.”\n\nThe dialogue the preacher speaks at the funeral are verses from “Spirits of the Dead.”\n\nEpisode 6: “Goldbug”\n\nTamerlane’s story and death is based on “William Wilson.”\n\nThe sapphire eyes are inspired by “Some Words With a Mummy.”\n\nRoderick’s backstory on Pym is inspired by “The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym.”\n\nEpisode 7: “The Pit and the Pendulum”\n\nFrederick’s death is based on “The Pit and the Pendulum.”\n\nRoderick recites the poem “Annabel Lee” to Dupin.\n\nFrederick’s focus on Morrie’s smile and ripping out her teeth is inspired by “Berenice.”\n\nThe poem Verna recites to Madeline is Poe’s “The City by the Sea.”\n\nEpisode 8: “The Raven”\n\nRoderick recites verses from the poem “Annabel Lee” to Dupin.\n\nThe bricking in of Gris is based on “The Cask of Amontillado.”\n\nAfter Lenore dies, the scene in which a raven appears before Roderick at his estate is based on “The Raven.” The reveal of the texts Roderick has been receiving that say versions of “nevermore” are also tied to the story.\n\nThe mummification of Madeline is inspired by “Some Words With a Mummy” and “The Fall of the House of Usher.” The collapse of the house and death of Roderick and Madeline are based on “The Fall of the House of Usher.”"
