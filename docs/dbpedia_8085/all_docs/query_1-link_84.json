        "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nLet’s talk birds! Today I’m sharing these fiction books that use birds in its titles or stories. I’ve read a few of them and some others look good to me. Do you recognize any? What looks good to you?\n\nI read these:\n\nI loved One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and To Kill a Mockingbird. I read Silver Sparrow a long time ago and remember thinking it was okay.\n\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest by Ken Kesey: Boisterous, ribald, and ultimately shattering, Ken Kesey’s 1962 novel has left an indelible mark on the literature of our time. The unforgettable story of a mental ward and its inhabitants, especially the tyrannical Big Nurse Ratched and Randle Patrick McMurphy, the brawling, fun-loving new inmate who resolves to oppose her. We see the struggle through the eyes of Chief Bromden, the seemingly mute half-Indian patient who witnesses and understands McMurphy’s heroic attempt to do battle with the powers that keep them all imprisoned.\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee: Harper Lee’s Pulitzer Prize-winning masterwork of honor and injustice in the deep South—and the heroism of one man in the face of blind and violent hatred\n\nSilver Sparrow by Tayari Jones: With the opening line of Silver Sparrow, “My father, James Witherspoon, is a bigamist,” author Tayari Jones unveils a breathtaking story about a man’s deception, a family’s complicity, and the two teenage girls caught in the middle.\n\nWant to read:\n\nI have been meaning to read The Nightingale for such a long time! Red Sparrow looks really good to me and is the first in a series. It’s also been made into a movie. I think My Pen Is the Wing of a Bird, The Spectator Bird and The Wind-up Bird Chronicle look very good.\n\nThe Nightingale by Kristin Hannah: The Nightingale tells the stories of two sisters, separated by years and experience, by ideals, passion and circumstance, each embarking on her own dangerous path toward survival, love, and freedom in German-occupied, war-torn France—a heartbreakingly beautiful novel that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the durability of women. It is a novel for everyone, a novel for a lifetime.\n\nRed Sparrow by Jason Matthews: For fans of John le Carré and Ian Fleming and featuring “high-level espionage, pulse-pounding danger, sex, double agents, and double crosses” (Nelson DeMille), Red Sparrow is a timely and electrifying thriller that is impossible to put down. Now a major motion picture starring Jennifer Lawrence and James Edgerton.\n\nMy Pen is the Wing of a Bird by 18 Afghan Women: Eighteen Afghan women living in, speaking about, and writing from the country itself tell stories that are powerful and illuminating, unique and universal – stories of family, work, childhood, friendship, war, gender identity, and cultural traditions.\n\nThe Spectator Bird by Wallace Stegner: This tour-de-force of American literature and a winner of the National Book Award is a profound, intimate, affecting novel from one of the most esteemed literary minds of the last century and a beloved chronicler of the West.\n\nThe Wind-Up Bird Chronicle by Haruki Murakami: A “dreamlike and compelling” tour de force (Chicago Tribune)—an astonishingly imaginative detective story, an account of a disintegrating marriage, and an excavation of the buried secrets from Japan’s forgotten campaign in Manchuria during World War II.\n\nMaybe reads:\n\nI never read The Goldfinch when it came out and everyone was talking about it. So maybe to that one and these others…\n\nOther Birds by Sarah Addison Allen: From the acclaimed author of Garden Spells comes a tale of lost souls, secrets that shape us, and how the right flock can guide you home.\n\nThe Atomic Weight of Love by Elizabeth J. Church: In her sweeping debut novel, Elizabeth J. Church takes us from the World War II years in Chicago to the vast sun-parched canyons of New Mexico in the 1970s as we follow the journey of a driven, spirited young woman, Meridian Wallace, whose scientific ambitions are subverted by the expectations of her era.\n\nNight Bird Calling by Cathy Gohlke: From award-winning author Cathy Gohlke, whose novels have been called “haunting” (Library Journal on Saving Amelie) and “page-turning” (Francine Rivers on Secrets She Kept), comes a historical fiction story of courage and transformation set in rural Appalachia on the eve of WWII.\n\nBirds in Fall by Brad Kessler: One fall night off the coast of a remote island in Nova Scotia, an airplane plummets to the sea as an innkeeper watches from the shore. Miles away in New York City, ornithologist Ana Gathreaux works in a darkened room full of sparrows, testing their migratory instincts. Soon, Ana will be bound for Trachis Island, along with other relatives of victims who converge on the site of the tragedy.\n\nThe Goldfinch by Donna Tartt: A young New Yorker grieving his mother’s death is pulled into a gritty underworld of art and wealth in this “extraordinary” and beloved Pulitzer Prize winner from the author of The Secret History that “connects with the heart as well as the mind” (Stephen King, New York Times Book Review).\n\nThe Secret of Raven Point by Jennifer Vanderbes: From the award-winning author of Easter Island comes a powerful, “unputdownable” (Vogue) novel of love, loss, and redemption amid the ruins of war-torn Italy.\n\nBoy, Snow, Bird by Helen Oyeyemi: As seen on the cover of the New York Times Book Review, where it was described as “gloriously unsettling… evoking Toni Morrison, Haruki Murakami, Angela Carter, Edgar Allan Poe, Gabriel García Márquez, Chris Abani and even Emily Dickinson,” and already one of the year’s most widely acclaimed novels.\n\nInteresting covers but probably not:\n\nThese didn’t grab me and The Last Illusion‘s cover is just too jarring for me to take an interest!\n\nThe Astonishing Color of After by Emily X.R. Pan: Alternating between reality and magic, past and present, hope and despair, The Astonishing Color of After is a luminous debut novel about finding oneself through family history, art, bravery, and love.\n\nHow to Turn into a Bird by María José Ferrada: From the award-winning author of How to Order the Universe, María José Ferrada beautifully details the life and lessons of an unconventional man and the boy who loves him.\n\nWhen We Were Birds by Ayanna Lloyd Banwo: A mythic love story set in Trinidad, Ayanna Lloyd Banwo’s radiant debut is a masterwork of lush imagination and exuberant storytelling—a spellbinding and hopeful novel about inheritance, loss, and love’s seismic power to heal.\n\nHollow Kingdom by Kira Jane Buxton: A finalist for the 2020 Thurber Prize for American Humor! “The Secret Life of Pets meets The Walking Dead” in this big-hearted, boundlessly beautiful romp through the Apocalypse, where a foul-mouthed crow is humanity’s only chance to survive Seattle’s zombie problem (Karen Joy Fowler, PEN/Faulkner Award-winning author).\n\nThe Flock by J. Todd Scott: From J. Todd Scott comes a chillingly engrossing thriller about a cult survivor who must confront the horrors of her past to ensure the safety of the future. Ten years after a fiery raid kills her family, former cult member Sybilla “Billie” Laure has a completely new identity. She’s settled in rural Colorado with her daughter, hoping for a quieter life. But the world has other plans.\n\nWhen Stone Wings Fly by Karen Barnett: “Pitch-perfect research and incomparable heart paint every corner of the brilliantly colored canvas of When Stone Wings Fly. Readers, get ready: your newest split-time fiction experience rests in the hands of a master.”―Rachel McMillan, author of The Mozart Code\n\nThe Watcher by Ross Armstrong: A dark addictive thriller with the ultimate psychological twist. Lily Gullick, an avid bird watcher who’s also been spying on her neighbors, sees something suspicious through her binoculars and soon her elderly neighbor is found dead. Can Lily really trust everything she sees?\n\nOsprey Island by Thisbe Nissen: As summer begins on Osprey Island, preparations at the Lodge — the island’s one and only hotel — are underway for the busy season. On maintenance and housekeeping there’s Lance and Lorna Squire, Osprey locals and raging drinkers; and their irrepressible son Squee. There are college boys to wait tables and Irish girls to clean rooms. And a few unusual returnees, too: Suzy Chizek, single mom and daughter of the Lodge’s owners, who’s looking for a parentally funded vacation; and Roddy Jacobs, another former local, who has come back after a mysterious twenty-year absence.\n\nThe Last Illusion by Porochista Khakpour: From the critically acclaimed author of Sons and Other Flammable Objects comes a bold fabulist novel about a feral boy coming of age in New York, based on a legend from the medieval Persian epic The Shahnameh, the Book of Kings.\n\nAll blurbs from Amazon, Goodreads and my local library catalog.\n\nThanks for visiting—come back soon!"
