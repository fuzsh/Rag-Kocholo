        "text": "Are you looking for diverse short stories for high school English? I know it can be difficult running into the same titles over and over (though, to be fair, I do believe a lot of those titles have plenty of literary merit and rounded up a list of my favorite “classic” short stories right here). With that being said, there are also many diverse short stories that are fresh and relevant that students would love to read. No matter what the topic you may be looking for, there are anthologies that contain plenty of fresh voices that address issues facing teens today. Here are some of my favorites.\n\n#1: Fresh Ink edited by Lamar Giles\n\nFresh Ink is a compelling collection of short stories written by award-winning author Lamar Giles. The book addresses a wide range of important topics, from racial identity to the pressure of academic success. What makes Fresh Ink so powerful is the way that it captures the unique experience of being a high school student today. Giles deftly explores the complexities of teenage life, and the result is a book that is both moving and insightful. For any high school student who is looking for a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them, Fresh Ink is a must-read.\n\nThis website here contains a full list of the stories with content warnings. I found it very helpful in planning my own content.\n\nStandout Stories:\n\nEraser Tattoo by Jason Reynolds\n\nBe Cool for Once by Aminah Mae Safi\n\nKodama’s Ramen Shop by Ellen Oh\n\n#2: Meet Cute edited by Jennifer L. Armentrout\n\nI had the pleasure of using this collection of short stories in my own classroom and wrote a blog post outlining the collection in detail right here. The stories provide a refreshing take on love and relationships. There is a little something for everyone in this diverse selection of short stories.\n\nStandout Stories:\n\nThe Way We Love Here by Dhonielle Clayton\n\nOomph by Emery Lord\n\nThe Department of Dead Love by Nicola Yoon (consistently a student favorite)\n\n#3: His Hideous Heart edited by Dahlia Adler\n\nHis Hideous Heart is an excellent collection of very diverse short stories. In this compilation, 13 famous YA authors retell some of Edgar Allan Poe’s most famous works. This provides an excellent opportunity to explore point of view and theme if reading the stories back to back. These dark and spooky stories are perfect for high schoolers.\n\nIf you’re looking for a full list of content warnings, click here to browse.\n\nStandout Stories:\n\n“It’s Carnival!” by Tiffany D. Jackson (“The Cask of Amontillado”)\n\n“Red” by Hillary Monahan (“The Masque of the Red Death”)\n\n#4: Flying Lessons & Other Stories editing by Ellen Oh\n\nHigh school can be a tough time for students. They’re dealing with hormones, cliques, and the pressure to succeed. So it’s no wonder that many teens turn to books for solace and escape. And what better book for a high school student to read than “Flying Lessons and Other Stories”? This collection of short stories by award-winning author Ellen Oh is the perfect antidote to the stresses of teenage life. The stories feature a diverse group of characters, all of whom are dealing with their own challenges. But despite their different backgrounds, they all share one common trait: the courage to face their fears and fight for their dreams. With its strong protagonists and positive messages, “Flying Lessons and Other Stories” is the perfect book for any high school student who needs a little inspiration. (Click here for a full run-down from Common Sense Media.)\n\nStandout Stories:\n\n“Seventy-Six Dollars and Forty-Nine Cents” by Kwame Alexander\n\n“Sometimes a Dream Needs a Push” by Walter Dean Myers\n\n#5: Rural Voices: 15 Authors Challenge Assumptions About Small-Town America edited by Nora Shalaway Carpenter\n\nIn Rural Voices: 15 Authors Challenge Assumptions About Small-Town America, a diverse group of writers share their stories about growing up in small towns across the country. While each author has a unique perspective, there are some common themes that emerge throughout the book. Several of the contributors write about feeling like an outsider in their own community, whether because of their race, religion, or sexuality. Others discuss the challenges of living in a places where there are few opportunities and little support for those who want to make a change. Despite the challenges, many of the authors express a deep love for their hometowns and a determination to make them better places to live. In sharing their stories, they hope to challenge the negative stereotypes often associated with small-town America.\n\nStandout Stories:\n\n“Fish and Fences” by Veeda Bybee\n\n“Black Nail Polish” by Shae Carys\n\nHow should you incorporate diverse short stories in your classroom?\n\nMy favorite way to incorporate any short story in my ELA classroom is with response to literature activities separated into three categories: before reading, during reading, and after reading. I have found that this system really allows students to dig into the material and respond in an authentic way (so much more than a simple reading quiz!).\n\nYou can get my done-for-you resource that you can use with any short story right here. It includes 10 response to literature activities that you can truly use with any story in both digital and print formatting.\n\nIs there a short story or anthology of diverse short stories I may have missed in this post? Let me know in the comments below or follow me on IG or Facebook to join the conversation.\n\nHappy teaching!"
