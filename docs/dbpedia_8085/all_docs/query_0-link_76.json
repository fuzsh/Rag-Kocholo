She publishes in academic and extension publications, with recent efforts that include the Farmer-to-Farmer Case Studies: Enhancing Resilience of Farming in the Pacific Northwest, as well as co-editing and co-authoring chapters in Advances in Dryland Farming in the Inland Pacific Northwest.\n\nYorgey grew up in Oregon, where early exposure to vegetable and fruit breeding and food processing convinced her that she wanted to work on issues related to agriculture and sustainability. She earned degrees from Swarthmore College and the University of Washington.\n\nFaculty Excellence in Research Award\n\nShyam Sablani, Professor, Department of Biological Systems Engineering\n\nThis award honors faculty members for high-quality research or creative scholarship over the past three years, or in recognition of a continuous record of scholarly accomplishments.\n\nSablani’s research program is built around applications of materials science to develop innovative packaging solutions and improve the safety and quality of foods.

Traditionally, pest management education and extension has focused on the what and when to spray; the how to spray is overlooked. Combining expertise in horticulture, plant pathology, entomology, and agricultural engineering, this team provides research and translational extension education on “how, what, and when” aspects of spray application technology. Their efforts also help improve agricultural workers’ health, safety, and associated socioeconomics in rural communities.\n\nMembers include Biological Systems Engineering Professor Lav Khot (mentioned above for the Early Career Excellence Award); Michelle Moyer, Professor, Department of Viticulture and Enology; and Gwen-Alyn Hoheisel, Professor and Regional Extension Specialist.\n\nMoyer is based at WSU Prosser IAREC and has research and Extension responsibilities in wine and juice grapes, with an emphasis on integrated pest management. She is originally from a small town in southern Wisconsin, growing up working in her family’s wholesale and retail ornamental plant nursery and landscaping company. Moyer holds degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Cornell University.\n\nHoheisel holds Extension responsibilities in grapes, tree fruit, and small fruit, conducting applied research and education to meet planned goals, and focuses on sustainable pest management, blueberry horticulture, and application technologies. Doubling as Benton County Extension Director, she divides her time between two county offices and IAREC. Hoheisel earned degrees at the University of Maryland and Pennsylvania State University."
