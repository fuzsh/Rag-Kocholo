Some very odd and inexplicable incidents occur on this ranch, which may be haunted by cattle-rustlers from the 1800s. School Library Journal says, âThe emotional resonance in this appealing story is in how Rafa and other characters come to terms with transformative events in their lives in a very real and relatable way.â\n\nAbout the Author: Adrianna Cuevas is first-generation Cuban American and only the second Latina ever nominated for an EdgarÂ®. .
