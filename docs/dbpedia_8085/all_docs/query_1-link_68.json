        "text": "“Nowadays you can go anywhere in the world in a few hours, and nothing is fabulous any more” . This quote is from a very famous author named Roald Dahl that has made an award winning book called “ The Landlady”. “All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.” This quote is also said by another award winning author and his name is Edgar Allen Poe and has made many books. One of his amazing books is called “The Tell Tale Heart”.\n\n“ The Tell-Tale Heart” Interpretive Essay Is the complex character created by Edgar Allan Poe a calculated killer or a delusional madman. In the short story “The Tell Tale Heart” by Edgar Allan Poe, the main character has a mental condition which causes him to kill a neighbor. He believes that his neighbor has a “vulture eye” which is the reason why he killed him. Night after night, he watches the man and plans how to kill him. Then one night, he puts his plan into action.\n\nIn “The Tell-Tale Heart,” the writer kills the man because of his “vulture eye.” The writer states, “I loved the old man. He had never wronged me.” This piece of evidence from the text shows that the writer had nothing against this man whom he loved.\n\nRhetorical Techniques In The Tell Tale Heart\n\n434 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThe narrator believes himself to be very intelligent and clever when he goes into the old man’s room at midnight. Poe’s word choice of “caution” and “how wisely” represents the man’s view of his own sanity. Yet the act he performs and the reasoning behind his murderous intention convinces the reader that the narrator has lost his sanity. He plots and is driven to kill a man after claiming, “ I loved the old man.\n\nThe protagonist in “The Tell-Tale Heart” is the narrator, he is “very dreadfully nervous”, paranoid, and mentally ill. He cannot cognizes whether what he sees is real or unreal. He seems to be lonely and friendless. Also, he is a murderer. In spite of the fact that the narrator loves the old man, he kills him because he afraid of his blue “evil eye”.\n\nThe man says, “You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing.” Tying in with the arrogant tones as well, the man has a very dark mind and the readers get a glimpse of his thought train through first person. He explains he needs to “take the life of the old man and thus rid myself of the eye forever.” No sane person would kill over a color of an eye, but as he describes the old man’s eye, the audience begins to understand why he takes the life of the old man.\n\nExamples Of Delusion In The Tell Tale Heart\n\n1213 Words | 5 Pages\n\nThe Tell-Tale Heart was told in the first person point of view. The narrator (also the main character) was paranoid and admitting he is nervous yet still sane creating a sad and sinister, slightly intense mood for the reader. This foreshadows that the narrator must have done something deviant and that others attribute him to have gotten insane. The narrator then tells the whole story to justify his sanity. The different conflicts in the story can already be determined—both internal and external: firstly, that the protagonist’s own conscience is haunting him (man vs. self); secondly, that the protagonist needs to prove his sanity (man vs. society); and that the protagonist wants to get rid of the eye of the old man (man vs. eye).\n\nThe Tell Tale Heart Insanity Essay\n\n603 Words | 3 Pages\n\nDespite sympathizing and relating to the old man’s fear, the narrator still finds amusement in haunting the old man at the dead of night. This attests that the narrator cannot distinguish right from wrong because he does not grasp that what he is doing to the old man is immoral. He is invoking terror for the benefit of his own deranged addiction to the daunting eyeball. Furthermore, the narrator proves once again that he cannot tell right from wrong when he not only takes the old man’s life, but also goes on to describe how immensely prideful he is in how swiftly he did so. Committing an act of murder is no generous deed, yet the narrator consequentially flatters himself for killing and discarding the old man in a supremely clean manner.\n\n“He had the eye of a vulture- a pale blue eye, with a film over it,”[pg.81]. He had a very good eye that was pale blue with a film over it. At first the old man was a good friend to him and then he saw the eye and he had hatred on him. If you don't betray things you love and forgive them then bad things won't\n\nThe Tell Tale Heart Insanity Essay\n\n868 Words | 4 Pages\n\nOn the fourth page of the story, a quote states“—but I found the eye always closed, and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye”. The narrator doesn’t actually want to kill the old man but instead has an irrational fear of a fantasy of the Old Man’s “evil” eye and that is what drives him to commit the murder. The readers know this because the quote shows how the narrator has no urges to kill the man when the eye is not seen. Another quote that shows how the Narrator can not distinguish fantasy from reality is “The officers were satisfied.\n\nTell Tale Heart Thesis\n\n760 Words | 4 Pages\n\n“I've heard many things in the heaven and in the earth. I've heard many things in hell”(Poe). In the story The tell tale heart, a man ends up killing his old man over his “Vulture eye”. He loved the old man. But his “evil eye” vexed him and he decided to take his life.\n\nSuspense In The Tell Tale Heart\n\n1109 Words | 5 Pages\n\nThere are times in life where people do commit a small mistake, or a huge crime, but what really matters is if one will listen to their conscience. In “The Tell-Tale Heart” by Edgar Allan Poe, the main character lives with an old man who has an eye that “resembled that of a vulture--a pale blue eye, with a film over it.” The story revolves around the main character’s obsession over the eye, and how he got rid of it-- by murdering the old man. Towards the end of the story, the young man confesses to the police about his insane stunt after they searched his house. In “The Tell-Tale Heart,” Edgar Allan Poe focused on having the reader know more than the secondary character, using description, and using a first-person narrator, to build suspense.\n\nAnother common thing these two stories share is love. In “The Tell-Tale Heart” the narrator said that he had loved the old man, but he just could not stand his eye (“The Tell-Tale Heart” 81). “The Black Cat” begins similarly, with the narrator claiming his love of animals and how he was especially fond of them (“The Black Cat” 115). One of the biggest things that they have in common is that their insanity drove them to murder. “The Tell-Tale Heart narrator was\n\nThe Tell Tale Heart William Wilson Analysis\n\n922 Words | 4 Pages\n\nEven being the vastly different stories “William Wilson” and “The Tell-Tale Heart” have a few similarities with regards to the theme. For instance, both stories end in a denouement. Correspondingly, the conscience of the men in both stories makes them do something unexpected. William Wilson, at the end of his story, commits suicide. William Wilson meets his tragic end when Poe writes, ”In a large mirror I saw my own image, dabbled in blood...\n\nTheme Of Death In Edgar Allan Poe\n\n2063 Words | 9 Pages\n\nHis ways of witting these thrilling narratives made him one of the most famous authors in the English language. The story narrates the cruel and evil murder or an old man. At the beginning of the story we are presented with a man that is constantly helped by a younger caretaker, the narrator. This old man has a strong relationship with the caretaker and the caretaker even says he loves the old man."
