        "text": "11 April marks the birthday of Hungary’s beloved poet, Attila József. Thus, the day is also dedicated to Hungarian poetry and celebrating the genius of Hungarian poets. Since 1964, Hungarians have been celebrating National Poetry Day by sharing their favourite poems with each other and attending cultural events. Marking the cultural significance of today for Hungary, Hungarian Conservative chose five poems to share. All of these works of art are pillars of Hungarian cultural heritage.\n\nWith a Pure Heart by Attila József\n\nThe first poem is from Attila József, With a Pure Heart. It speaks about the youth’s state of mind. The poet, who was at university when he wrote the piece, got into serious trouble for it—he was prohibited to teach high school students due to the ´immoral´ and ´nihilist´ views expressed in the poem.\n\nWith a Pure Heart\n\nWithout father without mother\n\nwithout God or homeland either\n\nwithout crib or coffin-cover\n\nwithout kisses or a lover\n\nfor the third day – without fussing\n\nI have eaten next to nothing.\n\nMy store of power are my years\n\nI sell all my twenty years.\n\nPerhaps, if no else will\n\nthe buyer will be the devil.\n\nWith a pure heart – that’s a job:\n\nI may kill and I shall rob.\n\nThey’ll catch me, hang me high\n\nin blessed earth I shall lie,\n\nand poisonous grass will start\n\nto grow on my beautiful heart.\n\nTranslated by Thomas Kabdebo\n\nI Know Not What… by Miklós Radnóti\n\nThe second poem, I Know Not What… was written in 1944 amidst the troubled days of World War II by the Hungarian Jew Miklós Radnóti just ten months before his tragic death. The poem, that speaks of the love of homeland despite the dire circumstances, inspired one of the works by the renowned contemporary Hungarian composer and pianist Balázs Havasi.\n\nI Know Not What…\n\nI know not what to strangers this dear landscape might mean,\n\nto me it is my birhplace, this tiny spot of green;\n\nringed now with fire, it was, once, my childhood rocking me;\n\nI grew there as a fragile branch from the parent tree;\n\nO may my body sink back to that life-giving soil.\n\nThis land is home to me: for if a bush should kneel\n\nbefore my feet I know its name just as it’s flower,\n\nI know who walks the road, whither and at what hour,\n\nI know what it might mean if reddening pain should fall\n\ndripping some summer dusk down the lintel or the wall.\n\nFor him who flies above it, a map is all he sees,\n\nthis living scape of being but symbols and degrees;\n\nthe reader of the maplines has neither known nor felt\n\nthe place where the great Mihály Vörösmarty dwelt;\n\nwhat’s hidden in the map? yes, barracks, mills and arms,\n\nbut for me crickets, oxen, steeples, quiet farms;\n\nwith field-glasses he marks the crops and industries,\n\nbut I, the trembling labourer, the forest trees,\n\nthe twittering orchards, vineprops with their tended grapes,\n\nand the old granny in the graveyard where she weeps;\n\nand what is targeted as rail or factory\n\nis just a lineman by his signal-box to me,\n\nand children watch him wave his red flag for the guard,\n\nand sheepdogs roll and tumble in the foundry yard;\n\nand in the park the trace of loves who once loved me,\n\nthe honey taste of kisses sweet as bilberry,\n\nand on the way to school you’d not step on a crack,\n\nlet you’d forget your lesson or break your mother’s back;\n\nthe pilot cannot see that paving-stone, that grass:\n\nto see all this there is no instrument or glass.\n\nFor we are guilty too, as others are,\n\nwe know how we have siined, in what, and when and where:\n\nbut working people live here, poets in innocence,\n\nbreast-feeding infants with their dawned intelligence,\n\nand one day it will brighten, hid now in safety’s bark,\n\ntill peace shall write upon our land its shining mark\n\nand answer our choked words in sentences of light.\n\nWith great wings cover us, O guardian cloud of night.\n\nTranslated by Zsuzsanna Ozsváth and Frederick Turner\n\nChrist-Cross In the Forest by Endre Ady\n\nThe third poem selected by Hungarian Conservative for today was written by Endre Ady, Christ-Cross In the Forest. The poem speaks of the awakening atheism of the early twentieth century, yet remarkably, Ady finishes his work with the realisation and acknowledgement that one’s Creator deserves respect.\n\nChrist-Cross In the Forest\n\nSnow-covered Christ-cross in the forest\n\nOn a vasty, moonlit winter’s night:\n\nAn ancient memory. Once, sleigh-bell\n\nA-ringing, I chanced to pass that way\n\nOn a vasty, moonlit winter’s night.\n\nMy father, then still young and carefree,\n\nSang when he looked on a crucifix.\n\nTrue scion was I of my father,\n\nWho, sickened by graven images,\n\nSang when he looked on a crucifix.\n\nTwo pig-headed Magyar Calvinists,\n\nJust like Time we paused not as we flew.\n\nFather and son: a Yes and a No,\n\nThere we sat together singing and\n\nJust like Time we paused not as we flew.\n\nTwenty years have passed, and in my thoughts\n\nMy sledge flies that way now in the night\n\nAnd – courtesy that then I paid not –\n\nI now uncover and bow my head.\n\nMy sledge flies that way now in the night.\n\nTranslated by Bernard Adams\n\nTo the Hungarian by Dániel Berzsenyi\n\nNext, the work of Dániel Berzsenyi, To the Hungarian, was written in a Europe torn by the Napoleonic wars. Europe and the Hungarian nation within are depicted in a strong storm, a storm that is capable of tearing down the old world order that was believed to last forever. It is only great nations with true virtue and strict moral rule that can survive the storm, argues Dániel Berzsenyi. The piece, which was one of the favourites of István Széchenyi, who personally produced a German translation of it for his wife, also inspired the Hungarian composer Zoltán Kodály:\n\nTo the Hungarian (II)\n\nThe Seas of Sorrow boil with a rage, Magyar,\n\nthe cursed soul of wrathful Erynnis rules,\n\nbehold his blood-soaked dagger urging\n\npeoples of Earth into mindless combat!\n\nOne day took down the throne of old Prussia, proud;\n\nthe Adriatic Coast and the Baltic Sea\n\nare dyed with blood – the Cordilleras\n\nand the Haemi are consumed by tempests.\n\nThe lands of Baktra holler and scream of arms,\n\nthe Dardanelles give thunder above their banks;\n\nthe iron railings of the nations\n\ntumble and fall, ropes and reins a-breaking.\n\nYou with your Titus into the castle fort\n\nof your great elders wisely assembly sought –\n\nto guide our boat adrift to safety,\n\nover the breakers, by law and counsel.\n\nArouse your sleeping national genius!\n\nShould hurricanes howl, dangers galore await:\n\nI shan’t be scared. The screeching trumpets\n\nand the wild leap of the rampant horses\n\nI’ll oversee with courage. Not multitudes,\n\nbut souls and people free conjure miracles – –\n\nthis is how Rome the whole world conquered,\n\nBuda and Marathon wound up famous!\n\nTranslated by Adam Makkai\n\nThoughts in the Library by Mihály Vörösmarty\n\nThoughts in the Library by Mihály Vörösmarty is a meditation on human progress. The human suffering—this is the first Hungarian poem that includes a reference to the tragic fate of black American slaves—that the poet emotionally observes in the world makes Vörösmarty question the worth of knowledge, scientific discovery, and progress. However, by the end of the poem, the writer reaches the conclusion that humans have a mission on this Earth—‘to struggle according to our strength, for noble goals’.\n\nThoughts in the Library\n\nConsider, scholar, when you enter here,\n\non cast-off rags, man’s stigma freshly marked,\n\nwith words as stark as the dark winter night,\n\nthere looms, written blood-black, the awesome lesson:\n\n“while into misery millions are born\n\na few thousand might find in life salvation\n\ncould they but make use of the days of their lives,\n\nhad they the mind divine, the Seraph’s temper.”\n\nWhy all this rubbish? So, like sheep on grass\n\nwe may graze on it? Sated with fodder\n\nand idle hours synthesized by science amoral\n\nto waste God’s day, a nation’s energy?\n\nWhy this rubbish? From its stench I recall\n\nall the sins of the animal man – they reek!\n\nVirtue is written on this page, which once\n\nas rag has garbed an outlaw. This other page?\n\nperhaps – oh happy days of innocence –\n\nthe frail dress ripped from a ravished virgin,\n\nperhaps a lust-enraged whore’s negligee.\n\nAnd here on these leaves, the law whitewashed from\n\nremnants of bloody rebels and false judges,\n\nfrom masks of sanguine tyrants washed white;\n\nthe secrets of machines and of numbers laid bare,\n\nbut those who tore garments, stripped man naked,\n\nflayed dignity that bindings might be vellum,\n\nthese, unaccounted for, must render account –\n\nthey spin on Ixion’s tempest-driven wheel\n\nwithin the vortex, misery without end\n\nand, gnashing their teeth, wail in the dark outside.\n\nOn the madman’s sheets ponders a sage’s head;\n\nthe astronomer, on eyeless beggar’s rags\n\nmeasures bursting universes piled on end –\n\nlight and blindness, all on a flimsy page!\n\nThe coward and the captive, both hapless roles\n\nare bound forever in one book that sings\n\nof freedom and heroes hewing history…\n\nStainless sheets, pulped from traitor’s rags, now\n\nreward the friend and thus honor the faithful;\n\nyet over all, all-polluting, the Big Lie!\n\nThe Word, cursed by the pallid winding sheet\n\nits black image adorns, suffers damnation,\n\nrag-lure of countries, your name is library!\n\nWhere, then, is the volume that answers all?\n\nThe greater part of Man – where is his joy?\n\nIs the world no better for any book?\n\nYes! The more gloriously man’s societies arise\n\nthe greater the human refuse at the bottom.\n\nThe bursting breast of rags stuffed with man\n\nmust breathe contagion into the empire’s heart.\n\nShould we, after all, topple what countless brains\n\nhave wrought in the linked sunbursts of their minds?\n\nVoid the golden knowledge rare brains have\n\nchopped and torn away from the mines of time?\n\nHow many bright souls immolated themselves\n\nin vigil at the burning ruins of the heart\n\nto give purpose, strength and comfort\n\nto erring humans humbled by destiny?\n\nThose heroes of unrecognized merit\n\nwhom the contemptible public mocked\n\nwere praised after death, when praise cost but words:\n\ntheir thoughts beatified by the martyring mob!\n\nShould the great burn to ashes at the same stake\n\nwith rag peddlers, numbskulls, and mildewed hearts?\n\nGlow in embers with dark passion-panders\n\nindiscriminate? Good on account of bad, with them?\n\nNever! That which I said was pain.\n\nThe travail of many a bold spirit,\n\neven those luminous minds could not save\n\nthe sons of dust from sinking in the mud.\n\nThere is barely a corner of the world,\n\none little oasis on the barren sand\n\nwhere the most sought-after name is not that of Man,\n\nwhere the ancient rites of generation\n\nyield as heritage the name of Man!\n\nExcept for those who have been born to blackness,\n\nlabelled cattle by the glorious elite\n\nwho caress the dark image of God with whips.\n\nDespite all, despite all, one must travail –\n\na new spirit is fighting its way up,\n\nthrough the soul of man bursts a new approach –\n\nto nurture fruitful ideals in races\n\nprimitive, to culture finer sentiments\n\nthat they may embrace, at last, each other,\n\nand within their hearts reign love and justice.\n\nSo the lowest peasant may, in his hut,\n\nsay with assurance “I am not alone,\n\nmy brothers and sisters number millions,\n\nI protect them, and me they defend;\n\nfate, I fear thee not, despite thy dread will!”\n\nThat is why one must not succumb to despair.\n\nLet us, steadfast as ants, set down that which\n\nour brains, in the rare inspired hours, create,\n\nand when we have assembled every stone,\n\nwe’ll erect the Babel of a newer age,\n\nbuild it until it towers among the stars,\n\nand when we have looked through the gates of Heaven,\n\nhaving heard from without the Angels’ song,\n\nwith every drop of our earthly blood\n\naglow from elevated flames of delights,\n\nlet us then scatter like the ancient peoples\n\nand begin anew, to endure and to learn.\n\nIs this then our fate, and nothing our goal?\n\nIt is not – nor will be while the earth yields life,\n\nand its mortal sons are not turned to stone;\n\nwhat, in this world, is our task? To struggle,\n\nand to nourish the needs of the spirit;\n\nwe are Man, son to both the earth and sky,\n\nour soul is the wing beating toward heaven,\n\nbut we, instead of striving up to soar,\n\nwould rather, dully, like some bird beneath contempt,\n\neke out existence sucking mud from swamps.\n\nWhat, in this world, is our task? To struggle,\n\naccording to our strength, for noble goals.\n\nBefore us stands the fate of a nation –\n\nwhen we, from the irrevocable fall\n\nhave preserved it and restored it to its heights,\n\nfighting under the clear beam of the spirit,\n\nwe can say, returning to our ancestors\n\nin the dust: “Thank you, life, for thy blessings –\n\nthis has been great joy, yea, the Work of Men!”"
