But together, the artist and piano create music â€“ such beautiful music that most professional pianists choose to perform only on Steinway pianos. That is why the overwhelming majority of concert pianists and other performers choose Steinway. Please find all members of the artist roster in the list.\n\nThank you! Your message has been sent. You will hear from us shortly."
