        "text": "Introduction\n\nJózsef Terék is an outstanding Hungarian performer, and a popular musician of the Hungarian folk art scene appearing both in ‘Kívánságkosár’ show on Duna TV and on Dankó Rádió. His musical career started 31 years ago in his hometown, Tápiószele, but since then, he has performed on stages throughout Europe, America, Africa, Oceania and Asia, and also represented Hungary in 37 other countries performing at various world music festivals, theatres, universities, competitions for composers as well as professional conferences. He is also a multiple nominee of the UK Songwriting Contest and a multiple finalist of the International Songwriting competition representing his home country performing his own compositions. He is a contributing member in many folk dance groups, and a popular performer at several international festivals. For 5 years he was responsible for teaching Hungarian folk music at an international folk music and dance camp in Seattle, WA. He is a frequent guest with the ethnic Hungarians living in Western Canada.\n\nHis primary work takes us back to his homeland: Tápiószele, and 21 other settlements along River Tápió. He researches and collects folk songs and then, as a result, he converts them into CD and book formats as a way of preserving the cultural heritage of the region together with helping aspiring young folk singers and dancers. As a result of saving cultural values, there have been 26 CDs and 9 DVD-ROM released, and 21 books published since 2009, by which our values can be re-learnt, taught and mastered by anyone – and young people can bequeath these values to 3-4 generations to come. In publications and at folk concerts he plays the double bass.\n\nHis career as a soloist began in 2015 with the release of ‘Tárogató as a Hungaricum’ (publication and concert material). Paying great respect to the symbol of Hungarians as well as to the performers of tárogató (Turkish pipe), he launched a series of concerts titled ‘Tárogató Hungaricum’ aimed at showing the versatility of this musical instrument. One can listen to Rákóczi marches, the songs found in old Hungarian codices, verbunkos music, authentic folk music, Hungarian melodies, classical music, and popular pieces performed at these concerts. By incorporating his own pieces and renditions into the pieces, he has a unique musical program worthy of representing Hungary on the international scene.\n\nIn March 2018, they were the first Hungarian band to represent Hungary in the Philippines, and in 2019, they were the first Hungarian musicians to give a concert in the Middle East and Africa. In 2020, the Republic of Palau, located in the Micronesian archipelago, welcomed József Terék as the first Hungarian performer.\n\nBetween March 15, 2021 and September 15, 2022, in a total of 82 world competitions - in most cases as the only Hungarian entrant - he managed to compete with our Hungarian musical instrument, the tárogató, on all continents, in the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, United Arab Emirates, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Poland, Macedonia, Morocco, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, United Kingdom, Italy, Russia, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Serbia, Trinidad & Tobago, Ukraine, and the USA. At the world competitions, a total of 80 first places, 4 second places and 2 third places were achieved, in addition to which 21 special awards (letter of reference, certificate of appreciation, special art award) were awarded.\n\nProfessional achievements\n\n1. Collecting Folk Songs\n\nIn January 2009 he began collecting folk songs and folk music in his motherland, the 21 settlements in the Tápió region. As of today, this work is still in progress.\n\nHe visited nearly 200 local informants, musicians, folk craftsmen during a period of 7 years. These weekly personal meetings made such a powerful impact on him that kept him busy continuously recording and archiving the ethnographical works of his motherland.\n\nAs fate may have it, he is an unaccompanied researcher carrying out his tasks; so far the last person conducting similar academic research work was Ms. Katalin Lázár, senior research fellow at MTA, BTK (Hungarian Academy of Science – Research Center for the Humanities – Institute for Musicology) in 1981.\n\nIt can safely be said that the collected and discovered pieces of information prove the importance of Tápió region, which is as rich in folk music, folk songs, traditional fashion, folk dances and other fields of ethnography as any other region in Hungary.\n\nIn January 2009 he began collecting folk songs and folk music in his motherland, the 21 settlements in the Tápió region.

By seeking out and visiting the last remaining local informants, and collecting their materials, the currently still existing locally and regionally spread folk songs will be preserved. To complement all these with the previously completed research works, we could get a complete view of the folk song values in Pest County from the beginning of the 20th century till today. Following the footsteps of Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály, József Terék carries out the preparation of the summary of the above works in electronic and printed formats; additionally, he fully identifies and opens up the folk song values of the county, and reintroduces the local folk song values at the municipal level to incorporate them into the local educational curricula.\n\n2. Preserving Values, Reproduction\n\nHis major work since 2009 has been to arrange the already existing, systematic and published materials found in databases and his research files on folk songs and folk music into a special compilation. The settlements have their own recorded CDs for the purpose of preserving the folk songs and folk music of the area, which he performs by the help of his own band and by the lawful use of the archived recordings.\n\nHalf of the CD series has already been recorded together with the double CD, summarizing the 21 settlements. The other format of the summary has been the publication of a 535-page, A4-sized folk song book titled ‘100 év 1000 népdal a Tápió mentén’ (100 years 1000 folk songs from along River Tápió) containing 866 folk songs. Of the recorded songs, 674 can be listened to on the DVD-ROM attachment in their original and collected format by the collectors themselves.\n\nThe book titled ‘A Tápió-mente zenekarai a XX. században’ (Bands from the Tápió Region in the 20th Century) is a publication on the memories of the local folk bands, brass bands, and gypsy bands.\n\nHis major work since 2009 has been to arrange the already existing, systematic and published materials found in databases and his research files on folk songs and folk music into a special compilation.

Introducing Research Fellows and Associates\n\nHaving obtained the permit to conduct research, at the beginning of the research work he was given access to the complete database with reference to the 21 settlements in the Tápió region held at MTA, BTK (Hungarian Academy of Science – Research Center for the Humanities – Institute for Musicology) and also to the full Archives of the Museum of Ethnography.\n\nThe first written records of folk music in the Tápió region were compiled by Zoltán Kodály in 1905. He was followed by Béla Bartók in 1906. Unfortunately, sound recordings has only existed since the 1950s, therefore the collection made by Jenő Ádám in 1928 concerning the materials from Tápióság can only be found in the form of original handwritten notes. The complete list of names of researchers together with the list of names of the local informants are provided at the end of the folk song book titled ‘100 év 1000 népdal a Tápió mentén’ (100 years 1000 folk songs from along River Tápió).\n\nHis work was greatly helped by the following research fellows and associates:\n\nMr. János Bereczky PhD, Ms. Mária Domokos PhD, Ms. Katalin Lázár PhD, Ms. Olga Szalay PhD, Mr. László Vikárius CSc, Mr. István Németh, Mr. Mátyás Bolya, Ms. Teréz Kapronyi, and Ms. Krisztina Pálóczy. The permits to conduct researches and to publish the findings were provided by by Mr. Pál Richter PhD, Director of MTA BTK (Hungarian Academy of Science – Research Center for the Humanities – Institute for Musicology) and Mr. Lajos Kemecsi Dr., Head of the Museum of Ethnography.\n\nHe began to write his own PhD doctoral thesis on the values of the folk songs and folk music in the Tápió region with the help of his thesis advisor, Mr. Elek Bartha Dr., Deputy Rector (President) of the University of Debrecen.\n\nHaving obtained the permit to conduct research, at the beginning of the research work he was given access to the complete database with reference to the 21 settlements in the Tápió region held at MTA, BTK (Hungarian Academy of Science – Research Center for the Humanities – Institute for Musicology) and also to the full Archives of the Museum of Ethnography.\n\nThe first written records of folk music in the Tápió region were compiled by Zoltán Kodály in 1905.

Educational Activities (Folk Song Competition, Pest County Repository of Values)\n\nUsing the background materials and publications already in existence, a valuable and educationally significant folk song and folk music compilation has been put together, the knowledge of which may have a positive impact in primary, secondary and tertiary education alike.\n\nThe local folk music CD materials have already been incorporated into the music education in the local curriculum supplementing the National Curriculum. The previously mentioned book on folk songs can also be accessed in all libraries of primary schools in the Tápió region. Re-teaching folk songs can save the local values for an additional 2 or 3 generations.\n\nHis long-term objective is to incorporate this knowledge into the list of reference literature for high schools, colleges, and universities alike.\n\nIn February 2015 the compilation of folk songs and music of the Tápió region titled ‘A Tápió-mente népdalai, népzenéje’ was added into the County Repository of Values by the Repository Committee of Pest County. It was the very first to be added due to its unparalleled processing and reproduction value.\n\nIn order to spread and popularize our folk songs, Miklós Földváry Primary School of Arts, Tápiószentmárton together with Szivárvány Foundation, Tápiószentmárton initiated and started a competition called ‘Tápió-menti Népdaléneklési Verseny’ (Tápió Folk Song Competition), whose optional or compulsory songs must be folk songs from the Tápió region. Since 2015, the competition has been open for students attending primary schools or art schools in Budapest and Pest County.\n\nUsing the background materials and publications already in existence, a valuable and educationally significant folk song and folk music compilation has been put together, the knowledge of which may have a positive impact in primary, secondary and tertiary education alike.\n\nThe local folk music CD materials have already been incorporated into the music education in the local curriculum supplementing the National Curriculum.

Composing Music\n\nHaving a degree in classical, pop and folk music, he is interested in composing music by blending these individual musical styles while being an active member of an instrumental band. He frequently enters international composition competitions playing his own traditional Hungarian pieces, which are dominated by the typical Hungarian sound and in which the cymbal plays a central role.\n\nConcurrently with the above, he composes music for various bands including 4 for Dance, Tisza Táncegyüttes, Nógrád Táncegyüttes, Nyírség Táncegyüttes, and also creates his own musical ideas.\n\nHis very first own CD, with the title ‘The Long Way – Pieces of My Life’ containing his compositions was published in 2011, and it had a unique orchestration as its Hungarian melodies were blended and intertwined with both classical and pop music. In its arrangement, violins and the cymbal play their central roles, and they are accompanied by the piano, bass guitar and the percussions.\n\nTo continue the above materials, similar compositions are being composed and orchestrated and will soon be available to all.\n\nHaving a degree in classical, pop and folk music, he is interested in composing music by blending these individual musical styles while being an active member of an instrumental band.

Talent Management\n\nLocal youth in the Tápió region that are particularly talented in folk music or folk songs are given extraordinary attention and assistance. They are given the opportunity to practice stage and band performances with his band, be these performances at concerts or other events. Students are mentioned on and participate in repository CDs thus gaining wider reputation. By acting so, the band leader can provide a more predictable vision of the future for all entry-level musicians.Local youth in the Tápió region that are particularly talented in folk music or folk songs are given extraordinary attention and assistance.

Tarogato as a Hungaricum\n\nIn 2009 he started working on his project of tárogató (Turkish pipe), a significant and iconic Hungarian musical instrument which later, in 2014, became a Hungaricum. This musical instrument has a long history dating back several centuries, but in its present form it was finalized at the end of 19th century. The ‘reformed’ version of the tárogató was due to the efforts by József Schunda Venczel and János Stowasser. The technical capabilities of the playing mode of the instrument opened up and improved in almost all respects, yet the instrument itself failed to take its rightful place. Originally, the instrument was destined to be a classical orchestra instrument at an equal footing with the other instruments. József Terék’s tárogató performances are based on this concept. The instrument perfectly fits in each musical style and genre, and can play solo while presiding in a lead role in the orchestra. Virtuoso performances and the various sounds guarantee the unique harmonies of József Terjék’s band and those of his friends’ band – additionally, Hungaricums (cymbal, Hungarian folk songs and authentic folk music as well as the dance verbunkos alike) are also introduced."
