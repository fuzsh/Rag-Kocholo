Many are now on show at the Budapest History Museum (also called the Castle Museum). During the rebuilding that followed the destruction suffered in World War II, chambers dating from the Middle Ages were uncovered in the south wing (wing E) of the Royal Palace. They provide an insight into the character of a much earlier castle within today’s Habsburg reconstruction. These chambers, including a tiny prison cell and a chapel, were recreated in the basement of the palace. They now house an exhibition, the Royal Palace in Medieval Buda, which displays authentic weapons, seals, tiles and other early artifacts. On the ground floor, Budapest in the Middle Ages illustrates the evolution of the town from its Roman origins to a 13th-century Hungarian settlement. The reconstructed defensive walls, gardens and keep on this level are further attractions.

Among the library’s most precious treasures is the Corviniani, a collection of ancient books and manuscripts that originally belonged to King Mátyás Corvinus (see p24 –5). His collection was one of the largest Renaissance libraries in Europe. Also of importance are the earliest surviving records in the Hungarian language, dating from the early 13th century. The library was established by Count Ferenc Széchenyi in 1802. He endowed it with 15,000 books and 2,000 manuscripts. The collection now comprises five million items; everything that has been published in Hungary, in the Hungarian language or that refers to Hungary is here.\n\nMAGNIFICENT COLLECTION of books has been housed, since 1985, in wing F of the Royal Palace, built in 1890 – 1902 by Alajos Hauszmann and Miklós Ybl (see p119).\n\nLUDWIG MÚZEUM BUDAPEST KOTÁRS M∂VÉSZETI MÚZEUM Disz tér 17.

The western part of the city stands on nine hills, the highest of which is János (St John’s) Hill (see p161). Greater Budapest is divided into 23 districts numbered in the Roman numeral system (see p223).

Until that time, the Árpád dynasty, the first family of Hungarian kings, had ruled their domain from elsewhere. When, at the beginning of the 14th century, there were no male heirs to the Árpád throne, Hungary began a long period during which it was mainly ruled by foreign kings including the French Angevins and the Polish Jagie¬¬os. Under Mátyás Corvinus, a great Hungarian king, Buda became one of Europe’s most impressive cities.

Today, there are over 60 museums and galleries in Budapest, ranging from those with collections of international significance to others of much more local interest.

These include the spacious chambers of the restored Royal Palace, which in the 1970s and 1980s were designated as the premises of several Crest of the museums, including the Hungarian National Museum of Gallery. The largest museums – including the Commerce Hungarian National Museum and Budapest History Museum – also stage temporary exhibitions that are popular with both locals and tourists.\n\nM\n\nOST OF\n\nSculpture of Imre Varga at the gallery named after him (see p171)\n\nH UNGARIAN P AINTINGS AND S CULPTURE HERE ARE TWO important venues that should be on the itinerary of anyone interested in viewing the finest examples of Hungarian art. At the Hungarian National Gallery, seven chronological sections present paintings and sculpture dating from the Middle Ages up until modern times. The sequence begins in the Lapidarium, where fragments of recovered medieval stone sculptures from the castles of the first Hungarian kings are exhibited. As a rule, very few examples of Gothic and Renaissance art survive in Budapest because of the pillage inflicted by the Turks during their rule. However, a fine collection of altar retables from the 15th and 16th centuries are on display\n\nT\n\nin the Hungarian National Gallery. In the 19th century, Hungarian painting developed and flourished, at the same time reflecting all the major international modern art movements. The Hungarian style can be seen particularly in the works of Pál SzinyeiMerse, Mihály Munkácsy and László Paál. For sculpture, meanwhile, the main names to look out for are István Ferenczy, Zsigmond Kisfaludi Stróbl and Imre Varga. It is portraits, rather than paintings and sculpture, that are shown at the Hungarian National Museum. These provide a fascinating insight into the country’s history. The Vasarely Museum has a collection of 300 works by Hungarian-born artist Victor Vasarely. He moved to Paris in 1930 and became famous as one of the main exponents of the Op Art movement.\n\nE UROPEAN P AINTINGS AND S CULPTURE the finest European artists, from medieval times to the modern day, are also divided between two museums in Budapest. The Museum of Fine Arts has a magnificent collection of Italian paintings, dating from the 14th century up to the Baroque period, by masters such as Titian, Antonio Correggio, Paolo Veronese, Giambattista Tiepolo and Jacopo Tintoretto. However, it is the Esterházy Madonna (1508) by Raphael, that is the jewel of the Italian collection. Equally splendid is the exhibition of Spanish paintings, which is one of the largest in the world. Works by Goya include The Water Carrier (c.1810). There are seven canvases by El Greco and others by Francisco de Zurbarán and Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. Other galleries within the museum represent artists of the Netherlands and Germany, as well as British, French and Flemish masters. The museum also owns more than 100,000 drawings and engravings by the Old Masters, while its modern art collection includes some notable works. Modern European paintings can also be viewed in the Ludwig Museum BudapestMuseum of Contemporary Art. All the canvases belong to the Peter Ludwig Foundation of Germany. Highly prized works here include two paintings by Pablo Picasso, Mother and Child and Musketeer.\n\nM\n\nASTERPIECES BY\n\nwww.touristas.clan.su\n\nPablo Picasso’s Musketeer (1967), in the Ludwig Collection\n\nB U D A P E S T\n\nA T\n\nA\n\nG L A N C E\n\nlived and worked is the setting, and visitors can see the musical instruments that they played, scores, photographs and correspondence.

Relics from the Roman era can be found at the Aquincum Museum and at a handful of museums, including the Roman Camp Museum, in Óbuda. The most important national historic treasures are housed in the Hungarian National Museum. The Coronation Mantle, dating back to the 11th century, is included in this collection. Medieval seals and Gothic statuary are among the exhibits at Budapest History Museum. At the Museum of Military History, displays chart various Hungarian struggles for liberty, including the 1956 Uprising (see p34).

This is mainly due to the fact that the Turks, during their 150-year rule, turned all churches into mosques, which were later destroyed during the attacks on Buda and Pest by the Christians.

Only a few sacred buildings of architectural interest are situated on the outskirts of the city. The greatest period of construction took place in the 18th century, after the final expulsion of the Turks. Another Detail on phase occurred in the second half of the St Elizabeth’s 19th century, producing two of Budapest’s Church grandest places of worship: St Stephen’s Basilica and the Great Synagogue. Religious buildings were neglected after World War II, but thanks to restoration some have now regained their former splendour.\n\nM\n\nReconstructed Gothic window of the Church of St Mary Magdalene\n\nM EDIEVAL Mátyás Church and the Inner City Parish Church date originally from the reign of Béla IV in the 13th century. Glimpses of their original Romanesque style can be seen, although each church was subsequently rebuilt in the Gothic style. After being sacked by the Turks in 1526,\n\nB\n\nMátyás Church was given a Baroque interior by the Jesuits who had at that time taken it over. Finally, the church was returned to a likeness of its medieval character between 1874–96, when all Baroque elements were systematically removed and it was given a Neo-Gothic shape. The Church of St Mary Magdalene, built in 1274 in the Gothic style, was almost completely destroyed in 1945. All that remains intact today is the 15th-century tower with its two chapels. A Gothic window has also been rebuilt. St Michael’s Church, founded in the 12th century on Margaret Island, was completely destroyed by the Turks. However, in 1932 it was reconstructed from its original Romanesque plans.\n\nUniversity Church was built by an Italian architect, Donato Allio. Under Habsburg rule, the leading architects working in the city, András Meyerhoffer, Mátyás Nepauer and Kristóf Hamon, often chose to follow Austrian examples. University Church and St Anne’s Church are generally considered to be the most beautiful buildings in the city dating from this era. The former astonishes visitors with its beautifully carved stalls and pulpit, and with the paintings by Johann Bergl adorning its vaults. St Anne’s Church has a magnificent Baroque façade and reveals the influence of southern German Baroque in its oval floor plan. Inside, there is a lavish altar and pulpit designed by Károly Bebó. The Franciscan Church, which is situated in the centre of Budapest and dates from 1758, has a wide Baroque nave and a main altar created by Antal Grassalkovich.\n\nOTH\n\nS PIRES\n\nAND\n\nD OMES\n\nThe Gothic spire belonging to the Church of St Mary Magdalene and the Neo-Gothic spire of Mátyás Church are among Budapest’s main landmarks.
