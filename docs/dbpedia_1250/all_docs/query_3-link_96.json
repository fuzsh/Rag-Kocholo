        "text": "Nikitov is one of the best of the new Yiddish folksong ensembles. This is something seen far more often in Europe than in the US, where one might see Celtic folk band almost any night of the week, but Jewish folk has largely been relegated to a few numbers by a wedding band. On the other hand, neither is this a reworking of Yiddish folk music in new idiom, as say, Golem or Khevre, or for that matter German bands such as Aufwind. Rather, this is a very well-done collection of beautifully sung Yiddish folk songs from Europe, from America, including Yiddish theatre favorites, backed by an excellent group of musicians. And, just as American Jewish wedding bands will throw in the occasional Yiddish tune, here, the band takes on a couple of delightful violin/guitar/bass klezmer improvisations. Rather nice, that, too.\n\nSinger Niki Jacobs manages to impart a sweet, folky, compelling style that even embraces one of the few bearable version of \"Shabes, Shabes\", a song otherwise high on my top ten songs never to hear again. By eschewing theatre flash and renewing the song in folk idiom, she similarly makes \"Bai mir bistu sheyn\" bearable and gives new life and gravity to \"Az der rebe\", a song original written as a satire against Hasidim. Her version of \"Mayn rue plats\", Morris Rosenfeld's lament to the horrible working conditions in New York sweatshops, is the best I have heard since Miriam Dvorin's recording 20 years ago, with \"Umru mayne\" heartbreakingly beautiful. There is no particularly rare material on this CD. What is rare is the assurance and tightness of the arrangements, and the aural excellence of the result. This is the best Yiddish folk music I have heard since the Pete Rushefsky/Becky Kaplan CD earlier this year and is very much on par with that recording. What a pleasure!\n\n01.

His passion for life and his unique life experiences are evident in both the music and the lyrics. He is produces original melodies with outstanding improvisations that mirror the special talents of this rare human being. He uses Balkan rhythms and melodies within a jazz motif to tease the listener -- who is drawn immediately to the rhythm, the spectacular combination of instruments. He incorporates traditional instruments as well as modern ones, mimicking the ancient Balkan brass bands from the turn of the century, plus using the accordion to create the gajde-like (bagpipe) sound of the past. The clarinet often reigns supreme with improvisaitons that leave the listener breathless. His voice is mellow, distinctive and has a smokey, sensual sound. He wrote most of the lyrics and music on this CD. So far it is my favorite CD of his. Most of the songs are in the Roma language but a few are in the Serbo-Croatian language.\n\nCD CONTENTS: Track #1 \"Jasmina\" has a special violin accompaniment that is worth hearing ...\"Hanuma\" includes the traditional instruments, \"bassprim 1\" and \"bassprim 2\" along with percussion, violin, rhythm guitar, trumpet and accordion. It truly is a fine example of music from the Balkans. Track #5, \"Pena\" is outstanding and was selected to be included in the \"Gypsy Caravan\" CD by Putumayo. Saban fell in love with a girl in Sofia, Bulgaria, he kissed her and she suddenly left him ... disappeared like soap foam. He dedicates the song to her. I am particularly fond of the music and melody of #14, \"Pitao sam malog puza\" which is about a little snail, who is asked to sell his house to the singer. The snail reminds the singer that he squandered his money in gambling and card games and could have had enough to buy a house. He begs the little snail to take pity on him, it is fall time, the weather is cold, and the singer's luck ran out, his lover does not want him. One of the most important songs on this CD is, \"Pelo Me Sam\" which was written while Saban Bajramovic was languishing in jail ... when he did not know if he would survive the experience, live or die. It is written in the true gypsy tradition based on life experiences that were difficult but which look to the future with some glimmer of hope and survival ... nonetheless ... he accepts that his fate is in the hands of G-d, who determines all outcomes. Most highly recommended for anyone interested in Balkan, Gypsy, Serbo-Croatian, or improvisational jazz music.\"\n\nErika Borsos (erikab93)\n\n01. Jasmina\n\n02. Pelno Me Sam\n\n03. Hanuma\n\n04.

Three years ago he invited six of his colleagues, all fine musicians in their own right, to form the Elemér Balázs Group, and they have become a highly acclaimed band by now... The Group has been touring Hungary extensively, and they are regularly invited to festivals not only in their home country but abroad as well. ... The group is striving to create their own sound characterised mainly by the contrast of the female and male voices. In their music they mix ethnic songs with original compositions.\"\n\n\"Elemér Balázs is one of the best drummers around right now, in my opinion. He plays with such musicality and finesse and has the ability to listen inside each musical moment with the kind of spontaneous decision - making that allows everyone that plays with him to sound their best. He also has a wonderful touch on the instrument - I always enjoy the chance to play with him and to hear him.\"\n\nPat Metheny\n\n\"There are no longer borders in music.

Balval, a youthful and fiery quartet, co-opts the traditional melodies of Eastern Europe and the Balkans and swirls them with jazz, blues, rock and folk. The result is a multicultural, multilingual world music that begs to be heard. In fact, no one makes music quite like Balval. In an ideal world, the quartet will do for Eastern European music what the Buena Vista Social Club has done for Cuba, or what Tinariwen has done for music of the Sahara.\n\nIt doesn't take long to hear how the sounds from different modern genres exert themselves on Blizzard Boheme. Eastern European and gypsy traditions quickly morph into something fresh and fun, as on \"Tango,\" which becomes a coy frolic thanks to Awena Burgess' tart singing. The brooding \"Keren, Chavorale, Drom\" is sultry, very bluesy and a little playful. \"Blues\" is almost Chet Baker-esque in its languorous sweetness. \"Liza\" sounds like Leonard Cohen as filtered through the eyes of a Romanian gypsy.\n\nThere are experimental overtones here as well, with hints of Laurie Anderson, the Kronos Quartet and other adventurous artists. It's a credit to Balval that they can conjure up the spirit of those souls while at the same time remaining grounded in their unique neo-gypsy niche. Nothing is sacred. Everything is fair game when playing by their rules, which is basically not following any rules at all. The musical freedom is liberating.\n\nIn perpetrating this gorgeous chaos, Burgess is accompanied by violinist Rosalie Hartog, guitarist Daniel Mizrahi, bassist Benjamin Body, and percussionist Bachar Khalife. Together, the noise is brisk and blissful, crisp in performance and full of energy. The songs are sung in a variety of languages, from the Roma language, which is a beautiful mix of eastern chant and western vernacular, to Bulgarian, Hungarian, and Serbian. In fact, you can find Balval's Blizzard Boheme at the crossroads of all these marvelous and colorful cultures. \"Balval\" means \"the Wind.\"\n\n01.Ado Chavo [Hungary]\n\n02.Dumbala Dumba [Romania]\n\n03.Aman Lelo [Bulgaria/Azerbaijan]\n\n04.Tango [Moldavian Hora]\n\n05.Sude Phabaj [Hungary/Romania]\n\n06.Liza [Hungary]\n\n07.Jekha Chaja [Serbia]\n\n08.Keren, Chavorale, Drom [Hungary]\n\n09.Corro Som [Transylvanian Plain]\n\n10.Cirikli [Albania]\n\n11.Smelka [Russia]\n\n12.Blues [Hungary]\n\n13.An La Devla [Balkans]\n\n14.Loli Rokla [Czech Republic]\n\nAwena Burgess (vocals)\n\nDaniel Mizrahi (guitar)\n\nRosalie Hartog (violin)\n\nBenjamin Body (double bass)\n\nGuest:\n\nBachar Khalife (percussions)\n\nLink\n\npass: bluesmen-worldmusic.blogspot.com\n\n\"We released Rege in both Hungary and Slovakia in 1998.

Such are the folksongs and folk ballads passed down from generation to generation, dedicated to momentary and at the same time ageless emotions, destinies and events. Not only the beauty of the melodies, the refined and forever valid lyrics are fascinating, but also the whole body of traditions and beliefs hidden between the lines. These ’insignificant little songs’ are imprints of a traditional culture once flourishing, but now only surviving in scattered shreds. They have preserved countless secrets and messages, whose deciphering can be an immense pleasure for the modern listener. This belief has led me to compile this album.\n\nI have woven the fabric of a storyline, telling the path of woman’s life, from traditional songs, prayers, and excerpts from children’s games. Birth – marriage – death: the turning points of life are interwoven with the periods of childhood and of choosing a partner, followed by the decades of married life, where the life of the husband and the children is emphasized.\n\nI sing the story, and my musician companions paly the music arranged by Zoltán Kovács.

Good music is a world religion in which we are all believers. This includes folk music - while listening to it one feels that one belongs to others, to life... to each other.\n\nIt enables us to find the rightful place of everything in the world and does not allow the “colonization” of our senses. It survives everything - if nowhere else, in our souls.\n\nOn this festive album this is worthily revived in the interpretation of the now 20 year-old Méta. Because this material is festive. And, as such, it broadens horizons, lifts past over present, unites earth with sky. The world’s principles remain the same, while attitudes towards them are unique.

They play a mix of traditional East-European and gypsy music, plus their own compositions.\n\n\"How to describe the music of Dikanda? Acoustic folk rock meets haunting Eastern European female vocal? Klezmer rock? All of the above, plus more, comprises Dikanda's special sound - and that's only the first song on their album USZTIJO. Violin, accordion, standup bass, guitar and frame drum are featured; yet they rock like crazy - and meld perfectly with that haunting voice!\n\nTheir idea was to play music from across Eastern Europe, so songs and melodies from Poland, Bulgaria, the Ukraine, and Macedonia meet Jewish and gypsy music. Dikanda really knows how to build drama as well: check out cut 4 on USZTIJO, a cut called 'Amoriszej': it sounds like something American Jay Ungar might have come up with, but more adventurous with the percussion.\n\nSome bands take three or four listens of the complete cd to become fully involved and to appreciate the music: Dikanda had us all in the palm of their collective hands before the first song was halfway played.\"\n\nLink\n\npass: bluesmen-worldmusic.blogspot.com\n\nThe Jávori Sound Machine, founded by acknowledged drummer Vilmos Jávori in 2002, strives always to create a special atmosphere on stage with their energetic performance of an amalgam of Hungarian folk music, jazz, pop, and Latin rhythms.

There is a strong Flamenco influence that can be heard in Anti's playing - Spain being just one of the stops on the Roma Road. These two central figures are joined by Joco (József Balogh) on vocals and guitar; Csika (Zsigmond Rafael) on milk churn (that's right...) and bass vocals; Kornél Horváth on an amazing array of percussives (he also offers some percussion-related vocalizing, akin to that heard in recordings of tabla players from India); Zoli (Zoltán Orosz) on accordion; and Laci (Lászlo Molnár) on double-bass. Together they make some of the most infectious, honest and moving music you're likely to hear anywhere.\n\nThe songs here deal with life - plain, simple and complicated. There are songs of love and loneliness, of relations with neighbors, of the difficulties in finding suitable employment (who can't relate to that...?), and more.

The instrumental music traditions were preserved the most by the gypsies in Transylvania and Moldva. The art of beeing a musician descended from father to son for centurise and this is how those dynasties were born that served and shaped the music needs of village people. Today, however there is less and less possibility for them to play their music, as in many places people do not insist on the traditional, live music. Therfore precious this compilation, because all the bands you can hear on this album know and play such music pieces that originate from the era before the urbanisation of village life.\n\nThe recordings for this CD were made by Ferenc Kiss between 30 May and 1 June 1997 in Csíkszereda, Romania during the Primates’ Meeting held there.

Composers who are searching for new paths have found a flood of inspiration in the basic foundations of musical resources, most of all in folk music. In this amazing record by Katan you can find adaptations of Transylvannian-Moldavian-Hungarian folk themes and motifs.\n\nKata Horvati and Ancsa Papp sing these songs in such a pure, strong and powerfully expressive way that is a characteristic of performers who have truly mastered the forms of Hungarian Folk songs. And the musical \"accompaniment\" is an equally important companion to the new and well formed structures. It's one of the peculiarities and strengths of this album that different great artists who represent different genres of music play together. For example Mihály Borbély, a prominent figure in Hungarian Jazz culture, Ferenc Kisvári, who has played the drums on records that count as milestones in the history of Hungarian popular music, András Hajós, the singer songwriter of the band Emil.Rulez!, or Kit Walker, the American Jazz pianist, who played on Jai Juttal's record that has been nominated for the Grammies: they all gave to this record their own uniqueness and the atmospheres of the genres they play in, creating an interesting fusion with folk music.\n\nThere is a great variety of what is on offer in the markets of so called \"World Music\". Many \"musicians\" use melodies from folksongs and they just insert them into popular material without any imagination, in a shallow way, without making much mental effort.\n\nThe producers of Katan, Csaba Faltay and Ferenc Kisvári didn't just use the foundations of folk music, but they enriched the songs with their own special contributions and with incredible musical arrangements and unique musical structures.\n\nThe musical heritage the great Hungarian composers, Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály, the world famous adaptors of Hungarian folk music, was the inspiration for this album. The world of these great composers can be felt in the harmonisation and in the motifs of these songs, which is a kind of respectful bow from the creators of this album to those great musicians of the past.\n\n01 Gyűrű Dal\n\n02 Szováti\n\n03 Déva\n\n04 Rózsa\n\n05 Árva Madár\n\n06 Elmenek\n\n07 Koszorú\n\n08 Gergely Dub\n\n09 Bánat\n\nThe band Katan:\n\nKata Horváti - vocals\n\nAncsa Papp - vocals\n\nMusicians:\n\nKit Walker - piano\n\nMihály Borbély - wind instruments\n\nAndrás Hajós - vocals\n\nFerenc Kisvári- drums\n\nViktor Dudás - drums\n\nGábor Bruzsa - bass\n\nArnold Antoni- guitars\n\nZsófia Tallér - keyboards\n\nZoltán Istvánffy - electric guitar\n\nCsaba Gyulai - gadulka\n\nCsaba Faltay - keyboards\n\nLink\n\npass: bluesmen-worldmusic.blogspot.com\n\n\"Three masters of their art have joined to form the new Ferenc Snétberger Trio. With natural ease they bring together choice compositions, technical skills, improvisational drive and musical fantasy of the highest order.\n\nHungarian-born Ferenc Snétberger is among today's outstanding players on his instrument, one \"who can display intensity and passion even at a quiet volume\" (Cadence). Going for a synthesis of flamenco, classical, jazz and samba, he melts all these influences into a very personal style full of surprise, warmth, wonder and emotion. One of the leading jazz bassists of today, Norwegian Arild Andersen is famous for his full-bodied tone and his elegant playing. He has recorded dozens of great albums with the likes of Jan Garbarek, Bill Frisell, Stan Getz, Pat Metheny and Don Cherry. Italian-born Paolo Vinaccia has been living in Norway for 25 years and is a household name on the most creative Scandinavian improvisers' scene. His imaginative and colorful playing could be heard with Nils Petter Molvaer, Bugge Wesseltoft, Terje Rypdal, Palle Mikkelborg and others.\n\nThe trio's debut album \"Nomad\" hypnotizes the listener with breadth and clearness.\n\nWhen Snétberger, Andersen and Vinaccia start to play, it is like pure magic. Charming melodies, thrilling grooves, fiery improvisations, sudden turns and fragile moments evoke sceneries right out of dreamland. Founded in 2004, this unusual trio has quickly grown into a highly celebrated live act. Critics have called them \"a triangle of pan-European inspirations, an amalgam of mysticism and joy of life, dream paths and clear laughs, trance and dance\". The trio's music -- ranging from modern jazz drive and world beats to decent electronic sounds and vibrant lyricism -- catches the audiences by its sheer emotional power.\"\n\n01. Empathy\n\n02.

As the story unfolds the listener encounters playful, erotic and bloody poems set to original compositions, folk melodies and gypsy tunes, there are even some strong jazz influences as with the track Ius ultimate noctis, which uses the melody from the Billy Holiday song Strange Fruits.\n\nWeöres first published the poems claiming to have discovered them gathering dust in an achieve: he attributed them to an imaginary creator, an impassioned 19th century poetess named Lónyai Erzsébet, who – Weöres claimed - had sent her poetry to another poet because she was in love with him. By the time Weöres admitted to being the true author of the poems, the imaginary Lónyai Erzsébet had already become one of Hungary’s best-loved literary characters. A real woman in the hearts and minds of many - it was even believed that the passionate and troubled life story of Psyche mirrored Erzsébet’s own life, and theories about the woman developed in abundance.\n\nThe strength of the musical compositions on this disc is such that even non-Hungarian speakers will find themselves entranced by the world of Psyché and her imaginary creator.\n\nBea uses her impressive and accomplished voice to sing the poetry as close as possible to the spoken rhythm of the poems: “I want – as Lónyai Erzsébet said in one of her poems about her poetry - someone to feel the warmth of my breath…”\n\nAz utóbbi évek egyik legsikeresebb énekese saját válogatásában, a Palya Bea Quintet közreműködésével szólaltatja meg a 19. századi „költőnő” gyakorta frivol, de mindig őszinte verseit.

The band aims to expand the definition of Jewish diasporic music, by learning and reinterpreting songs and rhythms from all over Slavic and Balkan Europe. Lyrics are in Yiddish and aim to speak forcefully to the bloody history and intractable contradictions of Jewish diaspora and 'return'. With backgrounds in punk-rock, free-jazz, and other liberation musics, the all-acoustic playing on this record benefits from a genuinely spirited delivery and intensely original approaches to arrangements that never feel forced. This is modern folk music from Eastern European sources played strong, unburdened by antiseptic production and/or cheap sentimentality.\n\nSongs range from the propulsive to the sublimely restrained. \"Fishelakh in Vaser\" explodes with a pumping free-music rhythm section, \"Cretan Song\" is a staccato Balkan dance, and \"Ver Tantz?\" is an angry, politically-charged klezmer-punk original. Instrumentals \"Shvartze Flamen...\" and \"Nign\", along with the brilliant original \"Toyte Goyes\" (lyrics taken from a poem by Yiddish writer Itzik Fefer) are meditative and heartrending.\n\n01 Shvartze flamen, vayser fayer\n\n02 Papir iz dokh vays\n\n03 Fishelakh in vaser\n\n04 Cretan song\n\n05 Ver tanzt?\n\n06 Stav ya pitu\n\n07 Nign\n\n08 Toyte goyes in shineln\n\n09 Kalarash\n\n10 Forn forstu\n\n11 Skocne\n\n12 Moscowitz terkisher\n\n13 Di khasene\n\nThierry Amar: contrabass\n\nScott Levine Gilmore: mandolin, cymbalom, guitar, drums, violin, harmonium, voice\n\nGabe Levine: clarinet, guitar, bass clarinet\n\nJessica Moss: violin, bass clarinet\n\nwith\n\nJesse Levine: piano on 05; accordion on 09\n\nNadia Moss: piano on 12\n\nLink\n\n\"Every piece originates from authentic performers, the tunes have been arranged by the members of the group.

Once the style of LA MINOR was named as “Odessa beats”. It s the most precise determination in which LA MINOR live, create and perform.\n\nThe music of LA MINOR enriched by bayan (Russian accordion), saxophone, balalayka and tuba brings you back to the atmosphere of 20-40-es Soviet years and reminds the soundtrack to good old films about gangsters, tragic love and great swindlers of that time. Happy and nostalgic in the same time their music will not leave you untouched. Teeming with thieves and policemen, prostitutes and undercover agents, La Minor's Soviet-era street songs about the urban underworld strike an all-too-familiar chord with local art-house fans. But as the St. Petersburg band has learned on its frequent trips abroad, foreign audiences bring their own life experiences to the music.The collective consists of professional musicians.\n\nRight from the outset, the voclaist Slava Shalygin set out to emulate urban folk guru Arkady Severny. Severny's genre, now euphemistically known as Russian chanson, surfaced from the music underground after the Soviet Union's collapse, and has since become ubiquitous in popularized renditions on radio stations, at cafes and in taxicabs. But La Minor returns to the music's roots, with the sophisticated arrangements and deadpan delivery that originally marked the gangster sound.\n\nLa Minor is known for its careful choice of material, and for ignoring the standards in place of obscure gems of folk poetry.\n\n01.

They first used the name 17 Hippies in the fall of that year.\n\nIn 1996 they began to organize their own series of free concerts called Hippie Haus Tanz (Hippie House Dance). At this time Antje Henkel (clarinet), Elmar Gutmann (trumpet), and Ulrike “Rike” Lau (cello) joined the band. In 1997 Henry Notroff (clarinet) and Dirk Trageser (guitar & vocals) also were added, and live recordings of different concerts and rehearsal room sessions were compiled into their first CD Rock'n'Roll 13. In 1998 they played at the SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas and then toured in Texas and Louisiana. Later that year Uwe Langer (trombone) joined the band and they played in Paris for the first time.\n\nThey established their own record label and in 1999 released their second CD Wer ist das? (Who is that?). The French label Buda Musique released a compilation of both CD’s called Berlin Style, which was then also released in Italy. Volker \"Kruisko\" Rettmann (accordion) joined the band.\n\nIn 2001 the band wrote the score for the German movie Grill Point (Halbe Treppe) by Andreas Dresen and they performed in a cameo role in the film. A tour of Budapest, Prague, Vienna and France took place, and the second French album Sirba was released, featuring their first radio hit \"Marlène\". Kerstin Kaernbach (violin) also was added to the band lineup. Their first studio album Ifni was released in 2004. An extensive tour of Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Morocco and France ensued. Daniel Friederichs (violin) became the last member to join the current lineup. In 2006 the band made a tour of Japan and Spain and composed the music for the play Kasimir and Karoline, staged at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin.\n\nTheir style is a unique mix of Eastern European melodies and rhythms, with French chanson and American folk music. They sing mainly in German, English and French. In France their music is known as Berlin Style.\n\n01. Die Oros\n\n02. Mad Bad Cat\n\n03. Isa Auf Der Brucke\n\n04. Ershter Tants\n\n05.

It tried to make a unique connection between old and modern sound led by the expression \"from Kulin Ban's period up to nowadays\" and on that way it popularized the name of a very specific medieval sovereign.\n\nThe greatest challenges of the project were different affections in music and aspirations of the people involved. It wasn't easy to connect different music traditions and colour them with ambient hues. The very challenge was the greatest incentive as well. As the result, their first album of the same name was published in 2006 by PGP RTS.\n\nSince then \"Kulin ban\" has had many concerts and promotions. Conceptually, \"Kulin ban\" was trying to avoid the model of \"the western\" band system which behaves as a group of individual musicians that express themselves. The accent is on the community with its focus on the archetype in which musicians surpass themselves and become indeed one mind and one soul …they become one.\n\nSo, \"Kulin ban\" has never restricted itself to a determined number of \"group members\" or inflexible type of music concept on the stage. Freedom as a precondition of any movement, freedom of the artistic expression was, is and will be the priority for Kulin ban.\n\n1.Januske beluske\n\n2.Kad ja podjoh na bentbasu\n\n3.Zali Zare da zalimo\n\n4.Ja urani jutros rano\n\n5.Stojna moma brazdu kopa\n\n6.Od kako sam ja devojce\n\n7.Sobinka\n\n8.Ban brdo\n\nPart 1.\n\nPart 2.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Golem is neither a towering Jewish Frankenstein who defended the Jews of 17th Century Prague, nor a creature from “Lord of the Rings.” Golem is a 6 piece Eastern European folk-punk band.\n\nFronted by Annette Ezekiel - singer, accordionist, and 5-foot powerhouse; and vocalist, tambourine player, crazy-man Aaron Diskin; violin virtuoso Alicia Jo Rabins; trombonist extraordinaire Curtis Hasselbring; elegant upright bassist Taylor Bergren-Chrisman, and unstoppable drummer Tim Monaghan, Golem’s sound evokes wisps of old-world elegance filtered through the successes and disappointments of new-world dreams. Spending nights in Lower East Side immigrant-owned bagel shops and summers in Eastern Europe, Annette collects Jewish, Gypsy, and Slavic folk songs, and, with Golem, rewrites, adds, edits, and rearranges them along the way. These are the songs to which Eastern European grandparents danced over a century ago, and now Golem has its unwrinkled fans moshing to the same pulsing beats.\n\n\"The word on \"Fresh Off Boat\":\n\nLove stories? Check. Dances? Check. Warnings to future son-in-laws? Check. Dysfunctional families forcing kids to sell bagels on the street? That’s here too.\n\nAfter 2004’s Homesick Songs, GOLEM has paired with not-for-profit label JDub (Matisyahu, Balkan Beat Box) and producer Emery Dobyns (Patti Smith, Antony and the Johnsons, the Battles) for their latest release, Fresh Off Boat (a reference to new immigrants who call each other F.O.B.s). Thirteen tracks in five languages, the album hits stores August 8th, 2006, and features Phish bassist Mike Gordon, and legendary Patti Smith guitarist Lenny Kaye and more.\"\n\n01. Ushti Baba\n\n02.

Their new formation, Etnorom presents a unique range of fiery Gypsy music and dances from the Balkan Peninsula to Andalusia. The songs appear in exciting, new scoring by outstanding Romany musicians, who grew up singing and playing music and worked as members of Middle Eastern Europe's most famous Gypsy and folk groups. Etnorom's incredibly colorful repertoire includes; Gypsy music from Hungary, the Balkans, Serbia, Romania, Russia, Greece, Turkey, Spain, and - which is a real delicacy - the Arab world! The concerts are enriched with belly dance performed by Alexandra, and various Gypsy dances from the region. An \"audience dance participation section\" is often added to the show that gives the audience the possibility to learn belly dance moves and traditional Romany dances.'\n\nFrom band:\n\n\"EtnoRom has an alternative approach towards Gypsy music by merging the authentic tunes with contemporary world music, swing and jazz elements. Why is this approach new today, when world music is the main trend? Because EtnoRom managed to create a musical balance so that the music saves the extreme power of real traditional tunes and rhythms.\n\nEtnoRom's mission is to build contact between Romany tribes who wandered from Northern India and settled down in various parts of the world: In Northern Africa, Andalusia, Turkey, The Balkan Peninsula, Serbia, Russia, Romania and Hungary. In most of the cases the Gypsy people themselves don't know the music and dances of their brothers and sisters. EtnoRom aims to make Gypsy and non-Gypsy people know about the incredible diversity of Gypsy music. This mission, combined with the musical approach of the group has created a new, brave form of Gypsy music that roots in the authentic Gypsy basics and harmonically integrates other musical trends, as well.\"\n\n01.
