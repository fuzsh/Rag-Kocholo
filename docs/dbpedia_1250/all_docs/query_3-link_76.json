Austrian composer, conductor, teacher and administrator. Primarily a composer of operas, his style is characterized by aesthetic plurality- a mixture of romanticism, naturalism, symbolism, impressionism, expressionism and neue sachlichkeit; timbral experimentation, strategies of extended tonality and conception of total music theatre into the narrative of 20th-century music. His fame and influence were at their peak during the early years of the Weimar Republic when he was the most performed living opera composer after Richard Strauss. The decline of his artistic fortunes began with the mixed reception given to Irrelohe under Otto Klemperer in 1924 and the failure of Der singende Teufel in Berlin, 1928 under Erich Kleiber. After decades in obscurity, he has begun to enjoy a considerable revival in reputation in the German-speaking world and in the United States.

Dutch conductor, in addition to his acclaimed recordings of Richard Strauss' Ein Heldenleben, Mengelberg left valuable discs of symphonies by Beethoven and Brahms, not to mention a wildly controversial but gripping reading of Bach's St Matthew Passion. His most characteristic performances are marked by a tremendous expressiveness and freedom of tempo, perhaps most remarkable in his recording of Mahler's Fourth Symphony but certainly present in the aforementioned St Matthew Passion and other performances as well. These qualities, shared (perhaps to a lesser extent) by only a handful of other conductors of the era of sound recording, such as Wilhelm Furtwängler and Leonard Bernstein, make much of his work unusually controversial among classical music listeners; recordings that more mainstream listeners consider unlistenable will be hailed by others as among the greatest recordings ever made\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYB3-7Of58Q\"]YouTube - Willem Mengelberg conducts Egmont Overture[/ame]\n\n​\n\nin 1952 - Chris O'Connell, rocker is born.\n\nin 1952 - Alan Freed presents Moondog Coronation Ball at old Cleveland Arena, 25,000 attend 1st rock & roll concert ever.\n\nin 1953 - Robert Johnson, rocker is born.\n\nin 1953 - Shotgun Johnson, rock drummer (KC and the Sunshine Boys-Give it Up) is born.\n\nin 1954 - Harry Lawrence Freeman, composer, dies at 84.\n\nin 1956 - Elvis Presley appeared at the 4,000 seated YMCA Gymnasium in Lexington, North Carolina.

Greek-American inventor who founded Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company, now known as Fender Musical Instruments Corporation, and later founded MusicMan and G&L Musical Products (G&L Guitars). His guitar, bass, and amplifier designs from the 1950s continue to dominate popular music more than half a century later. \"The Strat\" he asked his customers what new features they would want on the Telecaster. The large number of replies, along with the continued popularity of the Telecaster, caused him to leave the Telecaster as it was and to design a new, upscale solid body guitar to be sold alongside the basic Telecaster instead. Western swing guitarist Bill Carson was one of the chief critics of the Telecaster, stating that the new design should have individually adjustable bridge saddles, four or five pickups, a vibrato unit that could be used in either direction and return to proper tuning, and a contoured body for enhanced comfort over the slab-body Telecaster's harsh edges. Leo and draughtsman Freddie Tavares began designing the new guitar in late 1953, which would address most of Carson's ideas and would also include a rounder, less \"club-like\" neck and a double cutaway for easier reach to the upper registers. Released in 1954, the Stratocaster has been in continuous production ever since. The Electric Bass: Leo also conceived an instrument that would prove to be essential to the evolution of popular music with the Precision Bass (or \"P-Bass\"), released in 1951. Up until this time, bassists had been left to playing acoustically resonating double basses/upright basses. Unlike double basses, the Telecaster-based Precision Bass was small and portable, and its solid body construction and four magnet, single coil electronic pickup allowed it to be amplified at higher volumes without the feedback issues normally associated with acoustic instruments. Along with the Precision Bass, so named because its fretted neck allowed bassists to play with 'precision'. The P-Bass and its accompanying amplifier were the first widely-produced of their kind, and it was the first bass to be fretted like a guitar; arguably, it remains one of the most popular basses in music today. 1960 saw the release of the Jazz Bass, a sleeker, updated bass with a slimmer neck, and offset waist body and two single coil pickups, as opposed to the Precision Bass and its split-humbucking pickup that had been introduced in 1957. Like its predecessor, the Jazz Bass/\"J-Bass\" was an instant hit and has remained popular to this day, and early models are highly sought after by collectors (complications of Parkinson's disease)\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMrwy5bJ-mk\"]YouTube - Leo Fender inventor of the Electric Bass Guitar[/ame]\n\n​\n\nin 1992 - Former nude model Vanessa Williams started a five week run at No.1 on the US singles chart with 'Save The Best To Last', a No.3 hit in the UK.\n\nin 1992 - Natalie Allyn Sleeth dies at age 61.

American banjo player, singer, songwriter, and comedian. Known for his plug hat, gold teeth, chin whiskers, and gates-ajar collar, he gained regional fame as a vaudeville performer in the early 1920s before going on to become the first star of the Grand Ole Opry in the latter half of the decade. Born in Smartt Station, Tennessee and sometimes known as The Dixie Dewdrop, his big break came in 1923, during a performance for the shriners in Nashville, he was spotted by Marcus Loew of Loews Theatres who offered him fifteen dollars if he was to perform at a theatre in Alabama. This led to many offers from other theatres in the Loew's Vaudeville circuit. In 1923 he began a tour in the south-eastern States together with fiddler Sid Harkreader and five other acts and recorded 18 tracks with Sid, before joining up with guitarist Sam McGee who was to become Macon's regular recording and performance partner, and between 1924 and 1938 he recorded over 170 songs. On November 6th 1925, they performed at the Ryman Auditorium, the future home of the Grand Ole Opry, for the benefit of the Nashville police force. The successful show took place only three weeks before WSM Grand Ole Opry was founded. Between 1930 and 1952, he was often accompanied by his son Dorris who played the guitar. In 1940 Dave, together with Opry founder George D. Hay, rising Opry star Roy Acuff, and Dorris Macon, received an invitation from Hollywood to take part in the Republic Pictures movie Grand Ole Opry. He continued to perform until March 1st 1952, 3 weeks before his death and he was inducted posthumously into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1966 (Dave sadly died at Rutherford County Hospital, his funeral was attended by more than 5000 people and his pallbearers were George D.

It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc (heart attack)\n\nTODAY'S MUSICAL SPOTLIGHT SHINES ON . . .\n\nin 1991 - Dave Guard dies at age 56.\n\nDonald David \"Dave\" Guard (born October 19, 1934, San Francisco, California - died March 22, 1991) was an American folk singer, songwriter, arranger and recording artist. Along with Nick Reynolds and Bob Shane, he was one of the founding members of The Kingston Trio.\n\nGuard was educated in Honolulu, Hawaii, at Punahou School in what was then the pre-statehood U.S. Territory of Hawaii. Upon completion of his final year of high school in 1952 at Menlo School, a private prep school in Menlo Park, California, he matriculated at nearby Stanford University, graduating in 1957 with a degree in economics.\n\nWhile an undergraduate at Stanford, Guard started a pickup group with Nick Reynolds and Bob Shane. Guard called his group Dave Guard and the Calypsonians, with a Weavers-style signature sound that was principally two guitars, a banjo, and rollicking vocals. Guard kept the group together after Reynolds and Shane left, changing the name of the Calypsonians to The Kingston Quartet. Then in 1957, when Reynolds and Shane agreed to team up with Guard again, the group changed its name to The Kingston Trio. Under contract with Capitol Records, the Trio became a huge commercial and influential success.\n\nGuard spent his early years first in San Francisco, and then his junior high school and high school years in Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii. Guard grew up hearing the soft vocal melodies and strummed guitars of Hawaiian music. He was particularly attracted to the unique rhythmic sounds of finger-picked slack-key ukulele and guitar music masterfully performed by the many of his neighbors and beach boys.\n\nGuard attended Punahou School, a private school established in 1849 by Hawaii's New England missionary families during junior high school and high school. Hawaiian culture and music played an important part in his school's educational program. Along with all his other classmates Guard early on learned to play Hawaii's ubiquitous ukulele in a 7th grade junior high school music class required of all students. It was in that class that Punahou's young 7th graders like Guard and his future Kingston Trio partner-to-be Shane learned the basics of playing the ukulele. The \"ukulele\" class made an impact on Shane, who during the next four years progressed steadily from the 4-string ukulele to the less toy-like and more professional appearing baritone uke, on to the tenor guitar, and finally to the 6-string acoustic guitar. According to Guard, his own first serious exposure to stringed instruments came from Shane, who taught him the rudiments of playing the six-string guitar.\n\nGuard participated in sports, and was a member of Punahou's ROTC battalion. In his junior year he participated in musical skits along with a number of other classmates who, like himself, had by that time also had become accomplished musicians. Guard left Punahou at the end of his junior year, completing his final year of high school at the Menlo School, a private prep school that helped him prepare for acceptance and matriculation at nearby Stanford University. At Stanford Guard was a member of the Beta Chi chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity.\n\nProfessional life and accomplishments (1955 - 1961)\n\nWhen Shane left the Calypsonians and returned to Hawaii to work in his family's business, Guard added two additional members, bassist Joe Gannon and vocalist Barbara Bogue, making the Calypsonians a quartet. Later, when Reynolds also left the Calypsonians, Guard replaced him with Don MacArthur to keep the quartet format intact, but by that time the national interest in calypso rhythms was waning, while Guard's musical growth was reaching out from calypso as well. Still appreciating Caribbean rhythms and vocals, but given his more eclectic folk music interests, Guard changed the name of the four Calypsonians to The Kingston Quartet.\n\nIn 1956 a publicist in the area, Frank Werber, offered his services to Guard and his bandmates, including Reynolds at the time. Werber's offer, however, was contingent upon replacing Gannon and Bogue, and shortly thereafter, both left the group. Guard and Reynolds contacted former Calypsonian member Shane (who was performing part time in Honolulu) asking him to join the reconstituted group. In 1957, back again as a trio as in their previous college days, they changed its name to The Kingston Trio.\n\nWith material gathered from a variety of sources, under Guard's musical arrangements and direction, the Kingston Trio quickly became a success. Guard, Shane and Reynolds worked well together. In addition to developing the characteristic \"Kingston Trio sound\" of the group's two guitars and a banjo, success came to the group from Guard's musical arrangements and renditions of folk and Irish ballads, Shane's talent for style and performance along with an innate knowledge of what pleased audiences, and Reynolds' management of the group's logistics.\n\nThe Kingston Trio with Guard recorded for Capitol Records; subsequent iterations of the group managed first by Werber and Shane and later by Shane alone recorded for Decca Records, Folk Era, Silverwolf, Pair, Collector's Choice Music, CEMA, and MCA, and had many hit songs in its initial ten-year run. The Kingston Trio's many songs include \"Tom Dooley,\" \"A Worried Man,\" \"Hard Travelin',\" \"Tijuana Jail,\" \"Greenback Dollar,\" \"Reverend Mr. Black,\" \"Sloop John B.,\" \"Scotch And Soda,\" \"Merry Minuet,\" \"Hard, Ain't It Hard,\" \"Zombie Jamboree\", \"M.T.A.\", \"Three Jolly Coachmen,\" and \"Raspberries, Strawberries.\"\n\nGuard was aware that among the Kingston Trio, he was the only one who could read music and who had some understanding of music theory; his partners basically played by rote, and the three of them sang in simple three-part harmony. With help from the Trio's bassist and musicologist David \"Buck\" Wheat, Guard embarked on a self-education program of learning more about harmony, and becoming more and more disenchanted with what appeared to him to be a lack of willingness or effort to \"improve\" on the part of his partners.\n\nBy late 1960, Guard's frustration and discontent with his partners, combined with an alleged embezzlement of the group's finances, had reached a point where he no longer wanted to work with Reynolds and Shane. Giving his partners notice that he intended to leave the Trio, and unwilling to cause the group he had founded to disband, Guard agreed to stay on with the Trio until his personal commitments were completed, and until Shane and Reynolds were able to find a suitable replacement for him. By early 1961 Shane and Reynolds had found a replacement for Guard. After a reportedly acrimonious meeting with Shane, Reynolds, and the Trio's business manager over the future of the Trio, Guard quit the group. The group continued to perform for six years as the Kingston Trio before disbanding in 1967, with John Stewart taking Guard's place.\n\nIn 1961, shortly after leaving the Trio, Guard formed a new group, The Whiskeyhill Singers, with Judy Henske, Cyrus Faryar, and Kingston Trio bassist David \"Buck\" Wheat. They toured and released an album and were asked to perform several folk songs on the Academy Award-winning soundtrack of How the West Was Won. Their voices can be heard on \"The Erie Canal\", \"900 miles\", \"The Ox Driver\", \"Raise A Ruckus Tonight\". Cyrus Faryar can be heard performing solo on the track \"Wanderin'\" and Dave Guard on \"Poor Wayfarin' Stranger\". Judy Henske featured solo on \"Careless Love\". Judy Henske was eventually replaced by Liz Seneff, but the Whiskeyhill Singers were disbanded in late 1962 after Guard left for Australia.\n\nDave Guard and The Whiskeyhill Singers recorded their first album at Henry Jacobs' studio at Sausalito, and it was released on the Capitol record label. A second album was recorded at the same private studio, but it was never released. The soundtrack to How the West Was Won was the group's final recorded appearance to be released commercially.\n\nIn late 1962 Guard moved with his family to Sydney, Australia, where he purchased a home overlooking the South Pacific Ocean at Whale Beach. He performed both under his own name, anonymously and under an alias as a supporting musician and vocalist on Australian recording sessions with, among others, Lionel Long, The Twiliters, The Green Hill Singers, Tina Date and The Tolmen. He also anonymously recorded many sound clips for radio and TV commercials. In 1964, Guard became the folk music consultant on the ABC-TV program Jazz Meets Folk, and he hosted his own ABC-TV national variety show, Dave's Place, on Sunday nights for 13 weeks in late 1965. Four episodes of Dave's Place featured Judy Henske as a guest performer.\n\nUntil his return to the United States in 1968, Guard gave guitar lessons and, with the help of his wife, Gretchen, wrote a book, Colour Guitar, describing a unique guitar teaching method relating music theory to a 12-valued chain of chords with color.\n\nGuard's relationship with the Trio remained strained while he was in Australia. According to Guard, while he was in Australia, he was never in contact with Reynolds and Shane, and he never heard any of their albums.\n\nFollowing his return from Australia 1968 and his wife's 1970 graduation from Stanford with a degree in art, Guard and his wife collaborated in researching, writing, and publishing a book on the ancient Irish folk tale, Deirdre of the Sorrows, followed by a second book about a 400-year old Hawaiian folk tale.\n\nAfter the breakup of the Singers in 1961, Guard had returned to Hawaii. Always a folk music eclectic, Guard attempted to publicize the slack-key sounds of Hawaiian folk guitar. Guard worked closely in Honolulu with slack-key guitar icon Gabby Pahinui to record and produce Pure Gabby, an album of classic Hawaiian melodies played with slack key tunings. Guard tried to interest major record companies with Pure Gabby, but met with little interest, and he shelved the project. In 1978, ten years after his return from Australia, at the urging of Singer colleague, Cyrus Faryar, who had heard Guard's Pure Gabby tapes, Guard contacted Hula Records of Honolulu about Pure Gabby, which agreed to take the recordings and distribute the album.\n\n[edit] Later years\n\nIn 1981, Guard reunited with Shane and Reynolds for a PBS fundraising concert and program entitled \"The Kingston Trio and Friends Reunion.\" He also made occasional concert appearances with John Stewart, his replacement in the Trio who was by then a respected and successful solo performer. In addition to writing and recording, Guard also found time to produce the video Workout for Equestrians with Ingrid Gsottschneider for Golden Arrow Enterprises.\n\nIn the 1970s, Dave Guard recorded a live album at The Ice House in Pasadena. His backing group on this album was The Modern Folk Quartet, which included former Whiskeyhill Singer Cyrus Faryar. The album was turned-down by Capitol and was never released.\n\nDuring the 1980s Guard continued to perform as a soloist and teach music. He did four tracks on a 12-track cassette recorded to accompany the \"All Along the Merrimac\" tour of New Hampshire and a final solo album, Up & In (1988), which received mixed reviews. One interesting aspect of both of the last two releases was Guard's performance of the Kingston Trio standard \"Scotch and Soda,\" which he had arranged in 1956 but which for thirty years had been performed in The Trio only by Bob Shane.\n\nOver the years following his return to the US, Guard worked with a number of people, including Alex Hassilev, Mike Settle, Judy Henske, Cyrus Faryar, Tim Buckley, Tommy Makem and David White.\n\nDave Guard remarried during this time, and lived with his wife in Los Altos, California.\n\nGuard had contracted lymphoma sometime after he moved to Rollinsford, New Hampshire. On March 22, 1991, aged 56, he succumbed to the cancer. His passing was noted and memorialized by the many good friends he had made and those he had helped both in and outside of the music industry during the ensuing years. In 2000 The Kingston Trio was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.\n\nHe was survived by his wife Gretchen, their children, Sally, Catherine and Tom, and Guard's mother, Marjorie. Guard's daughter Sally died in 2001, also from cancer.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ou2rg2_oa8\"]YouTube - Dave Guard: God Moves on the Water - Titanic[/ame]​\n\n22 MARCH\n\npage 1 of 2\n\n22 MARCH\n\npage 2 of 2\n\nin 1992 - Polygram Records officially announced that Tears For Fears had split up, Roland Orzabal continued using the name Tears For Fears.

He studied at the Leningrad Musical College from 1954 to 1957. There he learnt composition under Galina Ustvolskaya and piano under Mikhelis. Then from 1957 to 1963 he studied composition with Vadim Salmanov, Victor Voloshinov and Orest Evlakhov, and piano with L. Logovinski at the Leningrad Conservatory. He took a postgraduate course with the composer Dmitri Shostakovich from 1962 to 1965.\n\nHe taught at the Leningrad Conservatory from 1965, and became a professor there in 1986.\n\nTishchenko actively assisted in the secret delivery of the manuscript of Shostakovich's memoirs to the West. Later, however, he raised his voice in dispute against the authenticity of Testimony published by Solomon Volkov in 1979. In March 2006 he was announced as the first laureate of the 'Epokha Shostakovicha' prize instituted for the centennial of Shostakovich's birth. He died in Saint Petersburg.\n\nHis opus includes more than seven symphonies, two violin concertos, two cello concertos, a piano concerto, five string quartets, two cello sonatas, ten piano sonatas, a requiem, chamber and vocal works, the opera The Stolen Sun, the operetta A Cockroach, three ballets The Twelve, Fly-bee and Yaroslavna (The Eclipse), and incidental music for theatre and film.\n\nTishchenko's music style and composing manner shows him to be a typical representative of the Leningrad composers' school. He was very much influenced by music of his teachers Dmitri Shostakovich and Galina Ustvolskaya, turning these influences in his own way. He tried to use some experimental and modernist ideas like twelve-tone or aleatoric techniques, but was much more attached to the native traditions of his homeland. He demonstrated a kind of originality, scoring his Second Cello Concerto for 48 cellos, 12 double-basses and percussion (1969). Ten years later, however, he re-orchestrated it for a more practical combination.\n\nHe was honored by Shostakovich's orchestration of his First Cello Concerto, and repaid his master by the orchestration, editing and transcription of a few scores by Shostakovich. Tishchenko's Requiem, to the forbidden poem by Anna Akhmatova, written in the period of political stagnation in 1966, was a courageous cultural gesture.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBR-HWAPzTw\"]YouTube - Boris Tishchenko - String Quartet No. 3 (1/3)[/ame]​\n\n​\n\nin 1940 - Luis Gasca, rocker is born.\n\nin 1942 - Jimmy Miller, US pop drummer (Rolling Stones, Mot\"rhead) is born.\n\nin 1943 - Joseph Moiseyevich Schillinger, composer, dies at 47\n\nin 1944 - Michael Nyman, composer (Mesmer, Carrington) is born.\n\nin 1946 - Alexandru Zirra, composer, dies at 62\n\nin 1949 - Ric Ocasek, Balt, rock vocalist (Cars-Double Life, Bye Bye Love) is born.\n\nin 1953 - Chaka Khan, [Stevens], Great Lakes Il, rocker (Rufus-I am Every Woman) is born.\n\nin 1961 - Elvis Presley had his seventh UK No.1 single with 'Wooden Heart.'
