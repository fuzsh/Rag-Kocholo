        "text": "Composer: Imre Czomba\n\nWriter/Director Peter Foldy presents the cheeky comedy, Penetration, in the Dorie Theatre @ The Complex in Hollywood.\n\nCast: Trent Brown, Julia Henning, Swayde McCoy, Bree Wernicke\n\nThe Story: It’s the night before the 2016 Presidential election and young Cody Weber has taken a purity pledge with his conservative fiancé. No sex until they are married – but that doesn’t keep him from visiting an Internet chat room where he meets an attractive young model named Amanda. Overcome by guilt, Cody can’t go through with the encounter but is shocked when Amanda “appears” in his apartment. His roommate, Kyle, is thrilled that his best friend is back to his old self and after a night of laughter and revelation, the prospect of a threesome becomes hard to resist. Is Amanda an apparition or real? Regardless, Cody knows he has a life-changing decision to make.\n\nPeter Foldy (Writer/Director) received a Best Film and Best Director Award from the Planet Indie Film Festival in Toronto as well as a Jury Award from the Tambay Film Festival for his feature, “Silver Man,” that starred Eugene Levy, Joe Pantoliano, and Daniel Baldwin. He has garnered several Cine Golden Eagle Awards for his educational short films, as well as a number of music awards for his work as a recording artist.\n\nMusic Composer, Music Producer: Imre Czomba\n\nChoreographer: Sandor Roman\n\nWriter, Director: Zsolt Mesko\n\nStory:\n\nA brilliant artist, visionary scientist , ambitious architect , but what kind of man was Leonardo da Vinci? What he lived, he loved, believed in God? Production ExperiDance new dance show try to explore these issues , showing the life of Leonardo lesser known controversially exciting episodes.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance hero, bursting with diverse talents forever liberated thinking – but the dark side of the restless mind of countless unfinished work, aimless drift and find solitude . Shows the anatomy of the genius, this new ExperiDance 2 act show is a breathtakingly spectacular new production\n\nMusic Composer: Imre Czomba\n\nExperience and National Dance Theatre production in two acts\n\nThe creator places us into the recent past of 1969 and the present days of 2009 in Hungary. Our main characters are the twenty something of both eras, the invisible heroes who still believe, hope and trust, and if the situation requires, do in order to achieve wonders.\n\nThey are the Happiness Finders of the last 40 years, and today. To strengthen the message, the soundtrack is a compilation of the dance music of 2009 and the hits of 1969. Moral values, tradition, love, respect, honour then and now.\n\nThe production that features 17 legendary tracks, is an absolute hit with the audience.\n\nThe story is about twenties people from 2009 and 1969, who searching the happiness.\n\nWriter: Zsolt Meskó\n\nDirector-choreographer: Sándor Román\n\nDancers:\n\nBistei Judit, Cseke Ágnes, Deák Vince\n\nDénes Nándor, Falvai Miklós, Görög Zoltán\n\nHolman Enikő, Horváth Mónika, Iványi Tamás\n\nKiss Levente, Klausz Bernadett, Morvai Veronika, Nádas Judit, Patonai Norbert, Patonai Zsolt, Petrovics Petra, Péli Róbert, Pintér Ágota Lotti, Rajna Eszter, Reszneki Domán, Sátori Júlia,\n\nÚjszászi András, Vajda Nikoletta, Varga Attila, Varga Zsuzsanna, Vass Judit, Zsombori Miklós\n\nCostume designer: Ildikó Debreczeni\n\nScene designer: János Mira\n\nLight: Balázs Szimeiszter\n\nSound engineer: Bertalan Kupcsik\n\nMusic composer: Imre Czomba\n\nJoint work of National Dance Theatre and ExperiDance\n\nWriter: György Schwajda\n\nDirector-choreographer: Sándor Román\n\nDancers: Norbert Patonai, Bertalan Vári, Dénes Kovács , Veronika Morvai, Nándor Dénes, Zoltán Görög, Mónika Horváth,Júlia Sátori, Miklós Zsombori, Erika Jászka, Róbert Péli, Eszter Rajna, Zsolt Végső, Judit Vass, Zsuzsa Kun, Viktória Sipos, Annamária Borics, Tamás Iványi, Levente Kiss, Éva Papp, Dóra Ferkó, Albert Hernicz, Eszter Kutas, Miklós Falvai.\n\nGuest: Sándor Budai – violin\n\nCostume designer: Ildikó Debreczeni\n\nScene designer: János Mira\n\nLight: Balázs Szimeiszter\n\nSound engineer: Bertalan Kupcsik\n\nThe premier of the new joint production of ExperiDance and the National Dance Theatre is based on the epic comedy of János Arany. It is a two act dance performance, full of poetry, humour and dynamic choreography, that will even surprise the audience, who has come to know and enjoy the style of the dance group.\n\nSándor Román continues the success of “One Thousand and One Years” and taking it a step further by combining the motives of Hungarian folk dance and folk music, with many unknown elements of gypsy folklore, that are connected to the story itself.\n\nThe epic poem of János Arany (that was written in 1852 as a parody of the war of independence) is based on a true story:\n\nAt the end of the 17th century the Austrian troups led by General Puch assult the castle of Nagyida. When the Hungarian defenders, led by Captain Perédi, recognized their lack of power, food, and munitions, they escaped from the castle, leaving the gypsies with their leader Csóri to defend the castle. The elated hero gypsies celebrate with a big feast and dance, dreaming about glorious victory and good fortune. The story is told in two acts of humor and sweeping dance for our entertainment.\n\nInteresting information: this show was 5 weeks with great success in Teatro Neuvo Apolo Madrid.\n\nMusic Composer: Imre Czomba\n\nTwo-act dance performance\n\nJoint work of the ExperiDance Company and the Bolzan Urban Theatre\n\nConcept, script, direction: Manfredo Cicigoi\n\nScene and costume designer: Zsuzsa Molnár\n\nAssociate choreographer: Bertalan Vári\n\nDirector-choreographer: Sándor Román\n\nFinale song performed by: Szilvi Péter Szabó (Nox)\n\nThe lyrics of the finale song : Manfredo Cicigoi and Mihály Kalpintér\n\nThe dancer – Bertalan Vári\n\nThe ghosts of the metal (Iduna and Anudi) – Eszter Kutas, Ágota Lotti Pintér, Erika Jászka, Júlia Sátori\n\nProfessor Zweistein – Róbert Péli\n\nSog – Hernicz Albert\n\nProfessor Assistant – Kovács Dénes\n\nPippi – Sipos Viktória\n\nAnudi’s bodyguards – Norbert Patonai , Péter Takács\n\nAchilleus – Levente Kiss\n\nCleopatra – Éva Papp\n\nDancers: Judit Bistei, Annamária Borics, Péter Enyedi,Dóra Ferkó, Sándor Gál, Zoltán Görög, Mónika Horváth, Tamás Iványi, Zsuzsanna Kun, Veronika Morvai, EszterRajna, Judit Vass, Zsolt Végső, Miklós Zsombori\n\nExperiDance brings to life authentic folk dance traditions by mixing them with modern, eclectic dance elements enabling the current generation to identify with traditional roots. The Company’s creations move beyond impressive technical execution and also bear hallmarks of light humor and irony.\n\nThe grand-scale show STEEL presents The Legend of the Metal through history, demonstrating the role of the material in the development of humanity. The message of this international cooperation: Encounters of European countries and their cultures without borders. (Palace of the Arts)\n\nAbout the music:\n\nThe main difference between previous pieces and STEEL is that while they are both built on Hungarian folk music elements, STEEL uses West-European sounds dominantly.\n\nSymphonic themes are mixed with modern, contemporary sounds. The love theme, first introduced in the knight scene, becomes a love song performed by a singer by performance’s end. In the Hungarian version the song was performed by Szilvia Péter Szabó who is known from the pop group NOX.\n\nThe humor and the storm of dance music are also evidenced. The most dynamic and dramatic music can be heard at the end of the first act, called Perpetuum mobile. This music is full of shocking melody and rhythmic turns which make the visual show more complete.\n\nIn the second act we experience more modern music trends, like hard rock music. We hear interesting and less used instruments like the Australian didgeridoo, or jew’s-harp.\n\nThe curiosity of the piece can be attributed to the sounds of folk instruments like the flute and goat-horn used by the composer. Additionally, amusing “songs” like the “Arabic Song” and the “Jail Song” are also enhanced through the choreography of Sándor Román.\n\nIn Bolzano you hear two live musicians, Matteo Rosetto (guitars) and Mario Punzi (drums), but in Hungary the use of Dolby Surround sound makes the show and the experience more complete and unforgettable.\n\nThe musicians:\n\nGuitars: Zoltán Sipeki\n\nVocal: Adrien Fehér, Andi Jónás, Gábor Majsai, Imre Czomba, Sándor Román\n\nKeyboards, flutes, any folk instruments and computer programs: Imre Czomba\n\nMusic Composer: Imre Czomba\n\nCo-composers: László Rossa, Zsolt Gömöry\n\nDirector: Sándor Román\n\nChoreographer: Sándor Román\n\nDancer:\n\nA Teremtő – Norbert Patonai\n\nLucifer – Miklós Falvai\n\nÁdám – Róbert Péli\n\nÉva – Veronika Morvai\n\nAngyalok – Nándor Dénes, Zoltán Görög, Mónika Horváth, Júlia Sátori, Miklós Zsombori\n\nÖrdögök – Judit Nádas, Levente Kiss,Ágota Pintér Lotti, András Újszászi\n\nAlmost incredible but this year the Experidance Dance Company is only 10 years old.In last several years they could walk up to such genre heights and their performance could be seen to conquer on so levels and quantities that we can feel the Experidance trade name has been known for decades.In this case we can talk about a well-sounding trade name which has quarantined the quality and success right from the beginning. The Experidance along with Sandor Román’s about 30 years old professional career as a dancer, then as a director-choreographer – he produced this one decade-long success story – leaves iqueryable tracks in “Hungarian dance history-book”.\n\nAs a “Hungaricum”, the Company has lived more than 1300 full house shows and wins the palm on either inland shows or over the borders season by season. They is mentioned as the Ambassador of Hungarian Dance and had many tours far behind them in Spain, Turkey and China too.The biggest attraction of company’s history is going to provide “dessert” to the new and old spectators as well and the regular numbered ballet being completed doubly is going to appear on the scene with 40 members.The monumental repertoire steers the course of legendary “Ezeregyév” – Thousand and one year. Exclusively this evening the leading part will be danced by Sandor Roman again who can be proud of uncountable professional and state awards as an the company leader choreographer.On 15th of August a Gala Performance will be organized in Arena which will not only be a jubilee attraction of 10 years old Experidance but the feast of hungarian dance based on traditional values in the course of the conqueror company’s work.\n\nMusic composer: Imre Czomba\n\nDeathtrap is a play by Ira Levin in 1978 with many plot twists and references itself as a play within a play. It is in two acts with one set and five characters. It holds the record for the longest running comedy-thriller on Broadway and was also nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play. Deathtrap was well received by many and has been frequently revived. It was adapted into a film starring Christopher Reeve, Michael Caine, and Dyan Cannon in 1982.\n\nTwo-act thriller\n\nPéter Fekete – director\n\nSándor Veréb – costume\n\nEdit Ranschburg – scene\n\nRobin Daiglish – Sidney Bruhl\n\nDeborah Kim Javor – Myra Bruhl\n\nJames Frost – Clifford Anderson\n\nSarah Stanley as Helga ten Drop\n\nJohn Radio – Porter Milgrim\n\nA stage performance of the film (staring Michael Cain) from the famous novel by Ira Levin.\n\nAbout the Music:\n\nA symphonic thriller, which brings a new intensity to the stage performance."
