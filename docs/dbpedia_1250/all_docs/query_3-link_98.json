All of them are Hungarian inventions. Quite im pres sive for a na tion that num bers less than 15 mil lion, about the pop u la tion of Florida. Of these, only about two-thirds live in pres ent day Hungary, the others are in neighboring countries, or virtually all over the globe. Not only are they im me di ately rec og nized by their ex u berant mu sic—Liszt, Lehár and Bartók comes to mind—but by their scientific attainments. Hungarian scientists have won eleven Nobel Prizes in the twen ti eth cen tury. This small na tion is quite com pet i tive in the world of sports also. On the av er age, Hun gary’s ath letes were among the first eight in win ning med als in Olym pic Games, com pet ing against the world. But not only in sci ence, tech nol ogy and sports, Hun gar i ans also ex cel in arts. Men and women with some claim to Hun gar ian an ces try were nom i nated for Os cars 136 times be tween 1929 and 1996, or an av er age of two nom i nees each year. They won the golden stat u ettes on thirty oc ca sions. Who are these Hun gar i ans—or Magyars, in their own lan guage—and why are they so suc cess ful? This is an at tempt to ex plain. Al though they live in the very cen ter of Eu rope for over 1100 years, eth ni cally Hun gar i ans dif fer from their neigh bors. Nei ther Slav, nor Latin or Teu tonic, Hun gar i ans speak a lan guage that is linguistically closer to Jap a nese than to any Eu ro pean lan guage ex cept per haps Finn ish and Es tonian. Although today a small country, Hungary was an established Chris tian king dom gen er a tions be fore the Nor man Con quest. From the year 1,000 AD un til 1945 this king dom was in con tin u ous ex is tence. The country’s history is marked by three catastrophic events: the Mongol On slaught in 1241, the Bat tle of Mohács, dawn ing the Turk ish oc cu pa tion in 1526 and the Treaty of Trianon, the breakup of his toric Hun gary\n\n1\n\nPreface\n\nin 1918. How ever, it is not Hun gary’s his tory that will be ad dressed here, but the at tain ments of her peo ple. For those read ers who are in ter ested in a chro no log i cal re view of Hun gary’s his tory, Ste phen Pálffy’s work, The Kings of Hun gary is in cluded as an ap pen dix. The Hungarian character, if one may allow any such generalizations, may be de scribed by such man i fes ta tions as acute in di vid u al ism, per va sive sense of hu mor, a ten dency to show man ship and pas sion ate hos pi tal ity. On the seamy side, among three Hungarians you can expect five different points of view. Con trary to the An glo-American be hav ior pat tern, show ing ef fort is poor sports man ship for a Hun gar ian. “I par tied all night, never cracked the text book and aced the exam” is what a Hun gar ian stu dent would likely say, even though he might have stud ied through the night. But be hind the in do lent charm, lazy grace, char ac ter is tic to Hun gar i ans, there is of ten a far from lazy brain. They have a pro cliv ity to out wit their op po nents. The def i ni tion of a Hun gar ian, to quote one their world renowned sa vants, is “the per son who gets into the re volv ing door be hind you and gets out ahead of you.” Their his tory, punc tu ated by for eign invasions, sharpened their survival skills. Connoisseurs of wine, women and song, they have been called “the Irish of Cen tral Eu rope”. A sixteenth cen tury Eng lish trav el ogue de rided Hun gar i ans about their glut tony. In Hun gary, it is prob a bly con sid ered a vir tue. Hun gar i ans are peer less when it co mes to en ter tain ing their guests. Even those, who may dislike Hungarians must admit that, somehow, what ever they are do ing, they are ob vi ously quite good at it. This book is a tes ta ment to that. In the past half a cen tury, Hun gar ian con tri bu tions to the world in clude two mon u men tal ep i sodes. On Oc to ber 23, 1956, the Hungarian Rev o lution started. That was the first time in the his tory of World Com mu nism that an entire nation rose up against their Communist oppressors. On November 9, 1989, the Hungarian government decided to roll up the barbed wires, take up the mine fields, rein in the dogs and open Hungary’s bor ders to tens of thou sands of es cap ing East Ger mans. This\n\n2\n\nbrought down the Iron Curtain. As German Chancellor Kohl put it: “The Hungarians knocked out the first brick from the Wall. We will never for get it!” Hun gary’s role—with out a doubt—had been cru cial in the even tual col lapse of the So viet Un ion. The Cold War is over. Hun gary is not un der So viet dom i na tion any more, but pro gress ing steadily to ward com plete re-integration into the European com mu nity of nations. With the on set of a new mil len nium and entering the 12th century of Hungary’s statehood, Hungarians proudly look to ward their fu ture with grow ing con fi dence and an tic i pa tion. They are ready to re gain their place in the Eu ro pean community— pre serv ing their na tional iden ti ty at the same time. I ex press my sin cere ap pre ci a tion to Fran cis S. Wag ner for al low ing the use of his 1976 book Hungarian Contributions to World Civilization as a source for much of the ma te rial in this book. The HungarianLexicon pub lished by Hun gary’s Na tional Tech ni cal In for ma tion Cen ter (Bu da pest, 1992) was invaluable in collecting and check ing the data. Many thanks for those who as sisted in gathering and eval u at ing new information, par ticularly to Imre Balogh, Ralph Gracza, Gábor Hosszú, István Isépy, Károly Kapronczay, Marianne Krencsey, Szabolcs Magyaródy, Szabolcs Marka, Péter Raics and Ödön Starosolszky. With out their ex pert as sis tance this book would not have been com pleted.\n\nAndrew L. Simon Professor Emeritus The University of Akron\n\n3\n\nPronunciation Guide\n\nPronunciation Guide This book con tains many Hun gar ian names and a lot of other Hun gar ian words in book ti tles and such. Eliminating all ac cents would make some names un de ci pher able. For those who are not fa mil iar with the Hun gar ian language accents would present considerable difficulty. Hence it is use ful for the reader to be came fa mil iar with the ba sic con cepts of Hun garianpronunciation. Hun gar ian be longs to the Ural ic fam ily of lan guages. It is an “ag glu ti nating” lan guage, that is, a lan guage that uses large num bers of suf fixes and post-positions. Typical constructions in this system are the one-word phrases like “fejemen” on my head, which breaks down into “fej ” head, “-em-” my and “-en” on; and “utamon” on my way, which is put to gether by “út ” way, “-am-“ my and “on” upon. In Indo-European lan guages these re la tion ships are shown by sep a rate words; Hun gar i ans link them up as suf fixes. Yet the Hun gar ian lan guage is eas ier to learn than many oth ers, be cause it lacks oblig a tory gen der and the usual Indo-European agree ment rules be tween ad jec tives and nouns. In Hun gar ian the stress, the em pha sis, is al ways on the first syl la ble of a word, re gard less how long the word is, like in Eng lish the words Governmental , or Poet. For ex am ple the Gabor sis ters and called gaBOR in Eng lish and GÁbor in Hun gar ian. Hun gar ian is among the few lan guages that have their own an cient al pha bet, the so called Sekler (székely) Runic writing. It is, of course, fully suited to the Hun gar ian pro nun ci a tion, each sound has its own let ter. It was gen er ally writ ten from right to left, but there are ex am ples for the left to right ver sion, in a mir ror im age for mat. An ex am ple of the Sekler Ru nic writ ing is shown on the fol low ing page. This is the Sekler Anthem, a well known Hungarian song, written in Sekler Ru nic, in left to right for mat, in the Hun gar ian lan guage. There are many an cient rem nants, mainly in Transylvania, but some even as far as Is tan bul, of such Hun gar ian Ru nic writ ings. The Pau line Friars have\n\n4\n\nused a vari ant of it ex ten sively as late as in the 16th cen tury as a form of se cret code. In Transylvania, Sekler Ru nic writ ing was taught in schools even in the 18th cen tury. Due to Chris tian re li gious pressure, the ru nic writ ing has been sup pressed and re placed by the Latin al pha bet dur ing Hun gary’s early cen tu ries. Adap tion of the West ern al pha bet has ne ces si tated the in tro duc tion of let ter com bi na tions, dou ble let ters like cs, sz, ny, ty, etc., to han dle sounds of the Hun gar ian lan guage not pres ent in the Latin. Con cep tually, these double let ters are no dif fer ent from those in the Eng lish lan guage, like sh, ch, th and oth ers. The Latin al pha bet of the Hun gar ian lan guage con sists of 44 Ro man let ters and di graphs, let ter com bi na tions, as fol lows: A, Á, B, C, CS, D, DZ, DZS, E, É, F, G, GY, H, I, Í, J, K, L, LY, M, N, NY, O, Ó, Ö, Ä, P, Q, R, S, SZ, T, TY, U, Ú, Ü, à, V, W, X, Y, Z, ZS. The acute ac cent means a dif fer ence in vowel qual ity. For ex am ple O is the same as Ó, ex cept it is a lon ger sound. The dou ble acute ac cent—a di a crit i cal mark that is unique to the Hun gar ian lan guage—sim i larly in di cates that the umlauted vow els are lon ger.\n\n5\n\nPronunciation Guide\n\nHungarian Pronunciation1 A - as in Bob, lot, got (Brit ish); or saw, moth (US).

Quite alone in the western world, Hun gar i ans write their sur name first and their ‘first name’ sec ond. Only the East Asian na tions fol low the same rule. While many Hungarians have German, Polish, or other surnames, many real Hun gar ian names end with I or y. Just as in Farsi and Arabic, it sim ply means “from”. Filmstar Béla Lugosi , for ex am ple, came from the town of Lugos and the Hungarian filmstar in the 1960’s, Marianne Krencsey’s an ces tors came from the vil lage of Krencse. In an cient times the y end ing in di cated no bil ity and was pro hib ited to be used by non-nobles. A noted lib eral aris to cratic re former in the 19th century, whose name was Lenkey, changed it to Lenkei , to show his intention to reject his noble prerogatives, like being exempt from taxation. In the case of Ms. Krencsey, the Com mu nist film au thor i ties insisted on bill ing her as Krencsei , which sounded prop erly pro le tar ian for them. No bil ity was in her ited by all descendants, hence thou sands of Hun gar ian fam i lies had some claim to it. But most had no wealth to back it up. To day this is an in con se quen tial matter. Two qual i fi ca tions on the i or y end ing are in or der here. The fre quent Hun gar ian name, Nagy, mean ing big, ends with the di graph ny, not as it seems, with y. An other case is the an cient end ing -ffy, mean ing the son of some one, like Pálffy, son of Pál. When abroad, some Hun gar i ans elected to make ref er ence to their an ces tors no ble back ground. In Ger man speak ing coun tries the word von (pronounced phone, with a short o) is the in di ca tor of no bil ity. This is why\n\n9\n\nPronunciation Guide\n\nthe fa ther of su per sonic flight, Tódor Kármán, came to be known as The odore von Kármán. Another such example is the great mathematician John von Neumann, called margittai Neumann János in Hun gary. In ci dentally, these two ex am ples of Hun gar i ans of Jew ish faith hold ing hereditary no bil ity, firmly dis prove any claim of dis crim i na tion against Jews in Hun gary. In Franco phone coun tries, the equiv a lent of von is de . Hence a Hun gar ian no ble named Bakay, em i grating to Leb a non af ter the 1848-49 rev o lu tion, in tro duced him self as DeBakay and be came the pro gen i tor of the fa mous heart sur geon of Texas, Mi chael DeBakey. A uni ver sal prac tice dat ing back to the years of the Austro-Hungarian Em pire is the wear ing of the doc tors de gree as a part of one’s sur name. In the past, a ma jor ity of Hun gar ian doc tor ates were ac a dem i cally equiv a lent to a doc tor of ed u ca tion de gree from Podunk State. Hence it is easy to find an apart ment build ing in Bu da pest where all res i dents are Dr. This or Dr. That. Even more pe cu liar is the habit of Hun gar ian wives and wid ows to use their hus band’s name with a né end ing, mean ing ‘the wife of’. There fore Dr. Kiss Albertné, for ex am ple, could be the di vorced for mer wife of Al bert Kiss, who him self may have fin ished law school. If all this ap pears ri diculous to the reader, he or she should study the byzantine system of titles, appellations and the associated different grammatical forms that were in wide use be fore World War II. But, on the other hand, one may talk about a per son in Hun gar ian for a whole hour, with out ever giv ing a clue whether the person is male or female. Pol i tically cor rect fem i nists would have a dread ful time in Hun gary.\n\n10\n\nThe Conquest\n\nMilestones of Progress The Conquest His to rians, lin guists and ar chae ol o gists al most unan i mously agree that the Magyars are of Finno-Ugrian origin both ethnically and linguistically. Their an cient home some mil len ni ums ago was in the Kama River re gion, be tween the Ural Moun tains and the Volga River. How ever, the problem of their or i gin can not be re garded as com pletely solved. Folk lore and my thol ogy point to im por tant Asian anal o gies, that sci ence has un til now failed to fully clarify and uti lize. Quite re cently, there has been many arguments about their eth nic or i gin and an cient home, that may have been as far East as China’s West ern regions: Dzungaria, Xinjiang, Uygur prov inces. There have been Jap a nese sci en tific stud ies, though in con clu sive, that point to possible lin guis tic sim i lar i ties to Hun gar ian. Finno-Ugrian peoples formed a nomadic pastoral society. They were rel a tively ad vanced in an i mal (es pe cially horse) breed ing, knew the pri mor dial forms of ag ri cul ture, could make earth en ware and could weave and spin. Their dec o ra tive metal work is unique and ar tis tic. The ear li est re mains show sim i lar i ties to Per sian art of the Sassanide pe riod. The pa gan Magyars be lieved in an i mism. Other prin ci pal el e ments of their shamanistic faith seemed to be their be lief in the du al ity of the soul and body, the cult of the dead, the spir its of good and evil and the im mor tal ity of the soul. Prior to reach ing the Dan ube Val ley, the wan der ing tribes met and as similated a number of different peo ples and cul tures, Turk ish, Ira nian and others. Hence, when they appeared in the Carpathian Basin, the Magyars happened to be quite a mixture of many ethnic entities and their respective cultures. However, the dominant feature of their lan guage, culture and lifestyle remained Magyar. Their wanderings ac-\n\n11\n\nMilestones of Progress\n\nquainted the Magyar tribes with the then already well-established re li gions such as the Chris tian ity, Ju da ism and Is lam. In the light of all writ ten sources, these early Magyars at ti tude to other re li gions and races seemed to be quite tol er ant, if not friendly. The Con quest of the Dan ube re gion oc curred in the clos ing years of the ninth century A.D., about the same time the barbarians sacked Rome. Un der the lead er ship of Árpád about a half a mil lion Magyars—formed into seven tribes—settled in the re gion. Un der in tense pres sure from the attacking Pechenegs, it was a carefully planned withdrawal from the East ern foot hills of the Carpathian Moun tains. At the time of the Con quest, Slavs, Ger mans, Ital ians and some other peo ples al ready lived there. Their number was about the same as that of the Hun gar ian in vad ers. The Magyars, char ac ter is ti cally, did not en slave the na tive pop u la tions as did the ear lier rul ers of the re gion, the Huns and the Avars. Their eco nomic or der was built on the con tem po rary feu dal system and not on the barbarian exploitation of subjugated peoples. While the Huns and the Avars who ear lier oc cu pied pri mar ily the Great Hungarian Plains, the central base of the Magyar Conquest lay in Dunántúl (Transdanubia), the very edge of Western cultural sphere. These circumstances de ter mined the fu ture of this area for cen tu ries to come. In the formative period the old nomadic nation concept of the Magyars em braced all sep a rate na tion al ity groups who lived on the ter ri to ries un der Hungarian mil i tary and po lit i cal su prem acy. This fairly elastic con cept of na tionality saved the Magyars during their long and tragic strug gles against the Mongols, Turks and oth ers.\n\nChristianization For de cades af ter the Con quest, Hun gar ian war riors on swift horses for ayed into the dis in te grat ing Carolingian em pire and de feated its slow feu dal cav alry. His to rians say that at the time what the Vi kings did n’t hit, the Hungarians most likely did. Their military tactics were entirely un-\n\n12\n\nChristianization\n\nknown in the West. Sudden, un ex pected at tack, fol lowed by pre tended re treat to break up the pur su ing en emy’s for ma tions, fe ro cious ar row at tacks shooting backwards from their horses, then turning again for hand-to-hand com bat. Finally, a mil i tary di sas ter at Augsburg in 955 put an end to their light ning raids. Hun gar i ans had but two al ter na tives: to con tinue their semi no madic life style and per ish as did their pre de ces sors the Huns and the Avars, or adapt themselves to the feudal socioeconomic conditions of Western Europe by the adoption of Christianity. The Hungarians choose the lat ter. There have been efforts both from the Byzantine and the Roman Church to Christianize Hun gary. Some Hun gar ian tribes first took on the Eastern Orthodox religion before switching their allegiance to Rome. Some his to ri ans claim that the ques tion of Hun gary’s conversion has sig nif i cantly con trib uted to the break be tween East ern and West ern Catholicism. King Ste phen I, the Saint, reign ing between 1000 - 1038, founded the Chris tian king dom. Rather than join ing the Holy Ro man Em pire, Ste phen ac cepted the crown di rectly from the Pope, thereby en sur ing Hun gary’s po lit i cal in de pend ence, un like the King dom of the Czechs. Upon their con ver sion to Chris tian ity, the Magyars be gan the pro cess of adapt ing them selves to the Latin-speaking cul ture of feu dal Eu rope. From that time, until the end of World War II, the coun try re mained a king dom. Its cul tural life de vel oped within the frame work of Western Christian civilization. This profound change was carried out by the kings of the House of Árpád (cca. 890 - 1301) with the aid of foreign priests and missionaries (Slavic, German, French, Italian and others) who dis sem i nated Chris tian ity in Hun gary. Hun gary’s suc cess in in te grat ing her self into Eu rope is well in di cated by the strong dy nas tic ties that have de vel oped over cen tu ries be tween\n\n13\n\nMilestones of Progress\n\nthe House of Árpád and the other royal houses of Eu rope, rang ing from Scot land to By zan tium. There were scarcely any ma jor royal houses that were not re lated, one way or an other, to the House of Árpád. Af ter the ex piration of Hungary’s last primaeval king, there were numerous royal houses, Anjou, Jagellion and Habsburg claiming the throne by inheritance. Ste phen Pálffy’s The Kings of Hun gary, ap pended at the end of this book de tails these events. The intellectual growth of the country was remarkable. The most fa mous library of that time, the still existing Benedictine Library of Pannonhalma, was founded in 1001. The first ref er ence to a Hun gar ian college, established in the eleventh century in Veszprém, was made as early as 1276. However, the Age of Humanism and the Renaissance, much more than the cen tu ries of Me di eval ism, helped in spire the ge nius of the Magyars. Hun gar i ans were sent abroad to study as early as in the time of St. Ste phen, who es tab lished a dor mi tory for Hun gar ian sem i nari ans in Rome. The Mongol invasion in 1241 almost wiped out the cultural achieve ments of Chris tian ity by de stroy ing nearly all their mon as ter ies, schools and li brar ies. Hun gar i ans quickly re built most of these cul tural cen ters. In the ini tial phase of cul tural evo lu tion the ol ogy and his tory writ ing— an nals, chron i cles, leg ends and gestas—were the primary in tel lec tual ef forts. But quite un like the Ger man an nals and chron i cles, these Hun gar ian gestas were true national historias in the Medieval sense. From a meth od olog i cal point of view, these early forms of his to ri og ra phy were in flu enced by French, Ger man, Ital ian and Eng lish mod els up to the Age of Renaissance, when the country’s historical science tended to follow and imitate the works of the Italian masters. Until the reign of King Matthias Corvinus (1458 - 1490), gesta and chron i cle writ ing was al most ex clu sively the job of cler gy men, who in a num ber of cases were of fi cially des ig nated as court his to ri ans. In ad di tion to the royal chan cery, some ec cle si as ti cal bod ies (mon as ter ies, clois ters, etc.) were en trusted with no tarial functions. They were thus the precursors or early forms of public\n\n14\n\nRenaissance\n\narchives for issuing documents, diplomas and conducting verification procedures.\n\nRenaissance From the thirteenth century on, many young Hungarians frequented the uni ver si ties of Paris, Padova, Bo lo gna and pri mar ily those of Cra cow, Prague and Vi enna. The Uni ver sity of Vi enna had 4,600 Hun gar ian stu dents be tween its foun da tion in 1363 and the Bat tle of Mohács in 1526. Progress in the sciences is shown by the fact that several universities were founded in the last two cen tu ries of the Mid dle Ages: the Uni ver sity of Pécs in 1367 and the Uni ver sity of Óbuda in 1389. When these short-lived universities ceased to exist, the Archbishop of Esztergom, Joannes (János) Vitéz (1408 - 1472), founded the so-called Academia Istropolitana in Pozsony (now Bratislava, Slovakia) in 1467. Some what later, in 1497, Konrad Cel tis established the Sodalitas Litteraria Danubiana (Danubian Scholarly Society) in Óbuda and Vienna, pre sum ably in the pat tern of It aly’s Ac a de mia Platonica. The mem ber ship, consisting of Hungarian, German, Czech and Italian humanists, arranged sym po sia to dis cuss schol arly top ics. The Renaissance court of King Matt hias Corvinus, among its many-sided ac tiv i ties, as serted the pri macy of mun dane glory and in ter ests over tran scen den tal ism. His tor i cal, as well as bel le tris tic works re flected a specific philosophy of man, which did not have much in common with the Christian attitude of preceding centuries. Janus Pannonius (1434 - 1472), Bishop of Pécs and a mem ber of the royal court of King Matthias I, at tained Eu ro pean fame as a hu man ist poet and was also very pop u lar in It aly. Ja nus Pannonius was the first poet who sang of beau ties of Hun gary’s scen ery and her peo ple’s pa tri o tism. In ci dentally, the grave of Pannonius was found in 1991 un der the main al tar of the old sub ter ra nean part of the ca the dral of Pécs.\n\n15\n\nMilestones of Progress\n\nThe humanistic trend was an import from Italy. In 1486, Antonio Bonfini (1434?- 1503) be came a mem ber of the royal court of Matthias at Buda and was com mis sioned there by the King to re write the coun try’s past in Re nais sance spirit. King Matthias’ li brary, the “Corvina”, was one of the great libraries of contemporary Europe. Its holdings of some 3,000 to 5,000 volumes in Greek and Latin rep re sented here to fore hardly cul ti vated branches of human knowledge: philosophy, mathematics, physics and the social sciences. What remains of Matthias’ humanist library—168 codices— re sides in thirty cit ies of Eu rope and the United States. Hun gary has only forty-three of them. The printing of the Bible by Johann Gutenberg (ca. 1400-1468) was probably completed late in 1455 at Mainz, Germany. Seventeen years later, in 1472 András Hess set up the first Hungarian printing shop in Buda and printed the first book, Chronica Hungarorum in 1473. It was in the Age of Re nais sance that Hun gary, through the min is tra tions of King Matthias’ royal court, en tered the cul tural com mu nity of West ern na tions as an equal mem ber.\n\nReformation In the dawn of the Mod ern Age, Hun gary suf fered the most dev as tat ing defeat by the OttomanTurks at Mohács in 1526. The country was torn into three parts. Its west ern and north ern parts con sti tuted the Habs burg King dom, which later be came the Austro-Hungarian Em pire, the east ern part formed the Prin ci pal ity of Transylvania, while the cen tral part of the coun try re mained un der Turk ish oc cu pa tion for a cen tury and a half. The epochal principles announced by Calvin and Luther quickly reached Hungary. The Reformation and Counter-Reformation were turn ing points in the in tel lec tual de vel op ment of the na tion. The adop tion of the Ref or ma tion co in cided with the dual op pres sion of the na tion\n\n16\n\nReformation\n\nby the Turks and by the Habs burg dy nasty. The con quest of the coun try by the Turks and the anti-Hungarian pol icy of the Habsburgs put a prolonged halt to Hungarian cultural development. The Western-oriented for eign pol icy of the Habs burg Em pire and hence its ne glect of the Eastern front, was chiefly responsible for the long-lasting Turk ish oc cu pa tion. It af fected first of all the eth nic struc ture of its pop u la tion. Dur ing the reign of King Matthias, in the sec ond half of the fif teenth cen tury, the pop u la tion amounted to 4,000,000 of which roughly 80% were Hun gar i ans. At the end of the Turk ish con quest, more cor rectly in 1720, due to the con tin u ous strug gles with the Turks and their de por ta tions to the Ori ent, the pop u la tion had dwin dled to 2.57million. Hungarians be came a mi nor ity in their own coun try. Hungarians, like the Poles and Aus tri ans, view them selves as the de fenders of the West against the Ot to man Turks. Had they not stopped the on slaught of Is lamic Tur key, the Turks would have over run a Eu rope ex hausted by re li gious wars. As Eng lish his to rian and sec re tary of war, Thomas Babington Macaulay (1800-1859) said: “The Ko ran would now be taught in Ox ford.” Af ter the Turks’ de par ture, the set tle ment pol icy of the Habsburgs in the eigh teenth cen tury ag gra vated the al ready di sas trous con di tions. In or der to di vide and rule, they fa vored non-Magyar, chiefly Ger man, set tlers that cre ated is lands of eth nic minorities across the coun try. Faced with these con di tions, pro po nents of both the Ref or ma tion and Counter-Reformation tried to save the cultural heritage of the nation. The Reformation proved to be an effective counterbalance to the Germanizing ef forts of Habs burg Ca thol i cism. There was a pe riod of two decades when three fourths of the population were converted to Protestantism. Stephen Bocskay (1557-1606), Prince of Transylvania, battled for and gained equality under the law for Protestantism: The Treaty of Vi enna in 1606 guar an teed con sti tu tion al ity and re li gious freedom in Hun gary. Bocskay is im mor tal ized by the Me mo rial to the Ref or ma tion erected in Geneva.\n\n17\n\nMilestones of Progress\n\nWhile con tem po rary Eu rope gen er ally ac cepted the prin ci ple that each coun try should ad here to a sin gle re li gion, in Transylvania un der the rule of Hun gar ian princes the sit u a tion was quite dif fer ent. The Diet of 1564 proclaimed that each and every town and province in Transylvania should be given the free choice of its own re li gion. Ac cord ing to the Diet of 1571 three na tions, Mag yar, Sekler and Saxon2 and four ac cepted re li gions ( receptae religiones ), the Cath o lic, Lu theran, Cal vin ist and Uni tar ian, were rec og nized in Transylvania. The Transylvanian Diet was the first leg is la tive body in Eu rope to en act re li gious free dom. The Ref or ma tion greatly in ten si fied re li gious fer vor not only among the Protestants but among Catholics too, by way of reaction and as self-defense. In a mat ter of de cades, ow ing to the ap pli ca tion of the prin ciple “cuius regio eius religio” in the pro cess of con ver sion, Hun gary again be came a pre dom i nantly Cath o lic coun try. Protestantism remained alive in disputed areas between Turkish and Habsburg rule. In the Eastern region, centered around the city of Debrecen, “the Calvinist Rome”, the College of Debrecen, founded about 1538, pro vided a cul tural bea con. It was the alma ma ter of many leading Hungarian scientists. The Calvinist College was in continuous ex is tence un til it be came a state uni ver sity in 1914. To day, called Louis Kossuth Uni ver sity of Sciences, it proudly dis plays over 460 years of his tory. Because of the lack of local higher educational institutions in the six teenth cen tury, more and more Hun gar ian stu dents re sumed the old cus tom of fre quent ing for eign uni ver si ties. Prot es tants went pri mar ily to the University of Wittenberg which during the sixteenth century was attended by more than 1,000 Hun gar ian stu dents. A fair num ber of Hun gar ian youths stud ied at the uni ver si ties of Bo lo gna, Padova, Vi enna and\n\n2\n\nGermans who were invited to settle in Western Hungary centuries earlier .\n\n18\n\nReformation\n\nCra cow. In the 16th cen tury the Collegio Ungarico-Illyrico was es tab lished at the University of Bologna. In the seventeenth century Lutherans stud ied at Wittenberg, Cal vin ists went to the uni ver si ties at Hei del berg, Basel, Utrecht and Leiden in the Neth er lands and some even to Ox ford. From a cultural point of view, the in tro duc tion of the ver nac u lar lan guage in all branches of knowl edge was the truly unsurpassable ac com plish ment of the Ref or ma tion. Be gin ning with Bi ble trans la tions, by the end of the eigh teenth cen tury sev eral thou sand for eign books had been trans lated into Hun gar ian. Gáspár Károli’s com plete Bi ble trans la tion in 1590 rep re sented a mile stone in trans la tion lit er a ture. Gáspár Károli can be compared with Hieronymus and Mar tin Lu ther among the great est Bi ble trans la tors of the world. In 1635—a year be fore the found ing of Har vard Col lege—the leader of the Counter-Reformation, Cardinal Péter Pázmány (1570-1637) founded the coun try’s most pres ti gious uni ver sity (now Lóránd Eötvös University of Sciences, Budapest). A prolific writer, Pázmány created the mod ern pro saic style in Hun gar ian literature. Dur ing this pe riod, cul tural life de vel oped un der the in flu ence of the Ital ian Re nais sance and Ger man Prot es tant ism. In spite of the dis ad vanta geous cir cum stances of the Turk ish Age, more and more in di vid u als became engaged in promoting knowledge. Miklós Oláh (1493-1568), later Archbishop of Esztergom, wrote a remarkable, very reliable historico-geographical de scrip tion Hungaria (ca. 1536, published in Bel gium). As a friend and to some ex tent a co-worker of Desiderius Eras mus (d. 1536), he rose to the stature of a great celebrity. His protégée András Dudith (1533-1589), Bishop of Pécs—who later left the Cath o lic Church to become a Calvinist then a Unitarian—traveled throughout Eu rope and de vel oped work ing re la tion ships with out stand ing hu man ists. Dudith can be re garded as a poly math, who, as a pro lific au thor of Latin works, scru ti nized current ques tions of the ol ogy, clas si cal lit er a ture and nat u ral his tory.\n\n19\n\nMilestones of Progress\n\nEnlightenment Af ter Prince Ferenc Rákóczi II’s War of In de pend ence (1703-1711), con di tions fun da men tally changed. Scholars and sci en tists be gan in ter pret ing the world in terms of hu man val ues and ex pe ri ences. In the sec ond half of the eigh teenth cen tury it be came quite ev i dent that Hun gary en tered the pe riod of change from semi-feudalism to cap i tal ism. The coun try’s in tel lec tual life al ready seemed more and more in ter wo ven with the threads of the ra tio nal ist phi los o phy of the En light en ment and with the ideas that trig gered the French and the Amer i can rev o lu tions. These for eign influences helped shape the con cept of na tion as a his tor i cal en tity and put it in the fo cus of schol arly as well as pub lic at ten tion. Many a new lit er ary prod uct of that age, af fected by the pro gres sive trends of the con tem po rary West, ex pressed to some de gree an anti-clerical men tal ity. A ma jor step to ward spread ing ethnocentric knowl edge and secularism was taken by the is su ance in 1777 of RatioEducationist . József Ürményi, Dániel Tersztyánszky and Pál Makó were commissioned by Queen Maria Theresa to prepare this all-important educational reform plan. This, in es sence, placed pub lic ed u ca tion un der strict gov ern ment con trol and in tro duced ra tio nal ism at all lev els of schools. Ac cord ingly, in the ser vice of utilitarianism, curricula of mathematical and natural sciences, phys ics, writing, the read ing of news pa pers, book keep ing, phys i cal ed u ca tion, etc., were pre scribed. New dis tricts of school ad min is tra tion were set up, un der the lead er ship of high-ranking gov ern ment of fi cials. This re form plan ac knowl edged and ma te ri al ized the prin ci ple of state-church sep a ra tion. This whole pro cess of ed u ca tional re forms took place un der the in flu ence of Rous seau and the French En light en ment. Queen Maria Theresa’s decree on Sep tem ber 17, 1763, was ep ochal in the consequent development of a world class engineering education in Hun gary. She de cided to es tab lish an acad emy of min ing en gi neer ing for all her do min ions at Hun gary’s chief min ing town, Selmecbánya3 (now Banska Stiavnica, Slovakia). Teaching com menced in the fall of that year. Chemistry, metallurgy and mineralogy were taught by Vilmos Jaquin,\n\n20\n\nEnlightenment\n\nwhose yearly sal ary was set at 2 thou sand golden thalers, a princely sum at the time. Math e mat ics was taught by Miklós Boda, who was also re spon si ble to set up the li brary. In 1765 he was given 600 thalers to start buy ing books. Ad di tional fac ulty joined the acad emy in 1770, when the school gained full accreditation. Min er al ogy, ge ol ogy and pa le on tol ogy col lec tions were pur chased; a li brary and sev eral lab o ra to ries were built. Ini tial en roll ment was set at 140 and half of the students re ceived royal sti pends. High school di ploma, two years of prac ti cal ex pe ri ence in min ing and royal per mis sion were the ad mis sion re quire ments. A unique fea ture of the cur ric u lum was the in cor po ra tion of field and lab o ra tory work, to pro vide prac ti cal train ing along with a sci en tific one. The Academy’s teaching language was German until 1848. Between 1780 and 1848, the international fame of this in sti tu tion at tracted stu dents from Aus tria, Ger many, It aly, Po land, Rus sia, Den mark, France, Swe den and even from as far as Spain and Por tu gal. In 1794, dur ing the French Rev o lu tion, when the Paris École Polytechnique was es tab lished, Antoine Fourcroy4, in an ad dress to the rev o lu tion ary Na tional Con ven tion, recommended that the mining academy of Selmecbánya be adopted as a pat tern for the newly founded French en gi neer ing school 5. In 1808 a fac ulty of for estry was added. This en gi neer ing in sti tute ful filled a real mis sion be cause by 1850 it had turned out 1,275 en gi neers. By 1870, when the acad emy was 100 years old, it had six de part ments, and of fered four year de grees in min ing and met al lur gi cal en gi neer ing, as well as a three year de gree in for estry. In 1777 the Royal Sci en tific Uni ver sity, founded by Car di nal Pázmány in 1635, was trans ferred from Nagyszombat (now Trnava, Slovakia) to Buda. This was fol lowed with one of the most por ten tous steps of these reforms, the creation of the Institutum Geometrico et Hidrotechnicum. In\n\n4\n\nCo-discoverer of the element Iridium, neurophysiologist.\n\n5\n\nAlas, this is not acknowledged at the École Polytechnique today.\n\n21\n\nMilestones of Progress\n\n1782, this In sti tute of Sur veying and Hydrotechnics was cre ated by King Jo seph II, son of Maria Theresa. Or ga nized as part of the Royal Sci en tific Uni ver sity, this was Eu rope’s first uni ver sity-level train ing in sti tute for engineers. In 1857, the Institute merged with the former Jo seph Trade School (Ipartanoda) teaching mechanical engineering subjects and the new Polytechnicum was cre ated, en com pass ing all fields of engineering of the time. Its di rect de scen dant to day is the Tech ni cal Uni ver sity of Bu dapest, the alma ma ter of a stun ning gal lery of em i nent sci en tists and en gi neers known to the world. The two en gi neer ing in sti tu tions, the min ing en gi neer ing school and the hy drau lic en gi neer ing in sti tute, were set up as an answer to clearly de fined pub lic needs. The deep en ing mines called for higher tech nol ogy in dewatering, ventilation, smelting and other technological areas. Hydraulic en gi neers and sur vey ors, were sorely needed for flood con trol and land rec la ma tion. These early in sti tu tions later served as a sci en tific in fra struc ture—math e mat ics, phys ics, me chan ics and other en gi neer ing sci ences—for the rapid de vel op ment of newer en gi neer ing fields such as me chan i cal and elec tri cal en gi neer ing. This is the un der ly ing his tor i cal cause of the spec tac u lar suc cess of Hun gar ian en gi neer ing ed u ca tion. In spite of prog ress in the ed u ca tional field, a dis il lu sioned pro gres sive in tel li gen tsia and the Hun gar ian no bil ity turned against the pol icy of the Vi enna Im pe rial Court. How ever, their move ments could not be come polit i cally large-scale, partly be cause most of the pro gres sive el e ments were in tim i dated by the events of the French Rev o lu tion. But the es sence of the En light en ment, the idea of prog ress, re mained the chief goal of all hu man ac tiv i ties; so cial, eco nomic, po lit i cal and cul tural. Char ac ter is tically, the ideas of the French En light en ment came to Hun gary through Vi en nese chan nels due to the mod ern iza tion trends of Maria Theresa and her son, Jo seph II.\n\n22\n\nThe Age of Reform\n\nThe Age of Reform Hun gary was for tu nate that in a crit i cal pe riod, fol low ing the Na po le onic wars, a group of great lead ers arose. First and fore most, Count Ste phen Széchenyi, (1791-1860) son of a wealthy noble family must be men tioned. He vis ited France and Eng land and re turned im bued with progressive ideas. He wrote several books propagating modern economic and other con cepts, founded the Acad emy of Sci ences, and the Na tional Li brary; the Na tional Ca sino, ini ti ated flood con trol mea sures, navigation on the Danube, development of a flour milling industry, countrywide transportation system, universal taxa tion; prop a ga tion of var i ous sport ac tiv i ties, horse rac ing and so on. His po lit i cal op po nent, nationalist political leader Lajos Kossuth dubbed him “the Greatest Hungarian”. Széchenyi and his numerous associates, the cream of the Hun gar ian no bil ity, within a quar ter of a cen tury changed a con ser va tive back ward feu dal is tic coun try into a mod ern pro gres sive one. One of the central issues in the Age of Reforms (1825-1848) was the struggle for self-fulfillment of all ethnic minorities throughout the Habs burg Mon ar chy, es pe cially in Hun gary. All eth nic mi nor i ties hap pened to be more or less involved in these self-realization movements. Emotional prej u dices on all sides came to the fore in pub lic life. The con flict ing forces of na tion al ism sowed the seeds of the down fall of his toric Hungary. In 1825—at the ini ti a tion of Széchenyi, who of fered a year’s worth of his income in support—the Hungarian Academy of Sciences was founded. Through this the coun try grad u ally en tered the main stream of world civ i li za tion. Notably, the Acad emy of Sci ences ini ti ated its first for eign con tact, not with the flour ish ing royal in sti tu tions of Eu rope, but with the Philadelphia-based American Philosophical Society founded by Benjamin Frank lin in 1751. In or der to ex plain this un usual phe nom e non in an age when intercontinental travel was dangerous and took many months, let us re view its his tor i cal back ground.\n\n23\n\nMilestones of Progress\n\nContacts with America In Cen tral and East ern Eu rope, on the fron tier of Chris tian civ i li za tion small na tions had stood in the path of the ex pan sion of the Ot to man Em pire. In their his toric strug gle against Turk ish “hea then ism”, lit er ary men of na tions sub jected to Turk ish oc cu pa tion be came dis il lu sioned by the inept diplomacy of the great Christian powers and riveted their eyes upon the New World. The Hun gar ian Miklós Istvánffy (1583-1615) dis played the essential char ac ter is tics of such feelings; in his Historia Regni Hungarici he said that Amer ica was sim ply dis cov ered “for the glory of Christianity” (p. 16). In the decades to come, Hungarian Protestant sources often referred to the New World. In 1654 Gáspár Miskolczi Csulyák made men tion of Amer ica, New Eng land and New Plym outh in his book on independence6. The famed Sam uel Köleséri, 7 went fur ther in the preface of his collection of sermons by citing Thomas Hooker, an Eng lish Pu ri tan au thor who em i grated into Amer ica, among his sources. A few years later, in 1694, the first Hun gar ian book about Amer ica ap peared, a trans la tion of In crease Mather’s (1639-1723) De successu evangelii apud Indos Occidentales, in Nova Anglia, etc .8 During the last quar ter of the 18th cen tury, the ear lier de vel oped idea of the “bulwark of Christendom” was consistently being replaced by the content of the American Revolution and fo cused on the Dec la ra tion of Independence and the Constitution it self.

The land of opportunity and its promise of a brilliant future captivated, among others, the French Michel-Guillaume de Crevecoeur who already in 1782, in the early for ma tive pe riod of the Amer i can na tion said: “Here in di vid u als of all na tions are melted into a new race of men, whose la bors and pos ter ity will one day cause great change in the world. Amer icans are the west ern pil grims, who are car ry ing along with them that great mass of arts, sci ences, vigor and in dus try, which be gan long since in the East; they will fin ish the great cir cle.”9 The por trait of Amer ica has var ied from time to time, keep ing pace with general requirements of the cultural progress of mankind. Benjamin Frank lin hap pened to be the first Amer i can of great cul tural im por tance whose inventions helped create a very impressive image of scientific America. Through the invention of the lightning rod he became the premier sci en tist of the world in the eyes of con tem po rary Eu ro pe ans. A professor of mathematics at the University of Buda, Pál Makó (1723-1793)—author of the first Hungarian book on electricity— showed high re gard for Frank lin’s sci en tific ac com plish ments. 10 The rise in Frank lin’s pop u lar ity was so high that many con tem po rary po ets sang\n\n9\n\nLetters from an American farmer , etc. London, 1782.

Sándor Bölöni Farkas (1795-1842), a prolific scholar, did the pioneer work through his widely publicized travel notes12 of his brief sojourn in the New World (Sep tem ber 4 to No vem ber 24, 1831), dur ing which he trav eled 2,450 miles by land and wa ter. He said Amer ica, this “happy coun try” was cho sen by Prov i dence to dem on strate “whether hu man so ci ety is able to es tab lish a good ad min is tra tion through free elec tions in the ser vice of the happiness of man kind” (pp. 28-29). When Bölöni Farkas re turned to Eu rope, he bade Amer ica fare well in these ar dent words: “God bless you, glo ri ous coun try! Be the im mor tal guard ian of the no blest her itage of man kind! Stand as an ev er last ing model of en cour age ment for the souls of the en slaved!” (p. 343) Apart from the American system of democracy, the cultural life of Franklin’s Philadelphia made the deepest impact upon the thinking of Bölöni Farkas, illustrated with the following ex cerpts: “Many a trav eler says and writes that Phil a del phia is the most beau ti ful city of the world. . . But the var i ous di vi sions of sci ence stand in the most beau ti ful light in the city of Phil a del phia. It seems this city is the place of ed u ca tion for men of sci ence, the cra dle of sci en tific ac tiv i ties . . . The Amer i can Philo soph i cal So ci ety, founded in 1743 by Frank lin, is fore most among all sci en tific so ci et ies with its out stand ing li brary, nat u ral his tory and other col lec tions.”\n\n11\n\nSee, for instance, LÅrinc Orczy’s poem (1718-1789) in Oszkár Szimán’s above-quoted article.\n\n12\n\nS.

Soon the noted math e ma ti cian and as tron o mer, Ac ademician Károly Nagy (1797-1868), sailed to Bölöni Farkas’ “happy country” and contacted Peter Duponceau, president of the American Philo soph i cal So ci ety. As a re sult of this ini tial con tact, vig or ous cor re spondence was maintained between the American and Hungarian scientific in sti tu tions, lead ing to periodic exchanges of sci en tific in forma tion and equip ment. The original re cords are still ex tant in the Ar chives of the Amer i can Philo soph i cal So ci ety Li brary. Due to the 1848-49 rev o lu tion in Hun gary, and the sub se quent re pres sion, the highest institution of Hungarian science was compelled to weaken, or even sever, its care fully built up for eign re la tions. It might not be en tirely ac ci den tal that its 1852 ship ment (con tain ing vol umes 3-7 of the Acad emy’s Year book) was mailed on March 15, the an ni ver sary of the up ris ing. 14 The for eign ex change pro grams of the Hun gar ian Acad emy of Sci ences has increased greatly since those pioneering years. In the mid 1970’s, some 150 years af ter its found ing, the Hun gar ian Acad emy of Sci ences’\n\n13\n\nFor more information about their friendship see Dr. Elemer Jancsó, ‘Bölöni Farkas Sándor élete és munkássága\" (pp. 3-54) in Sándor Bölöni Farkas , Nyugateurópai utazás.

Ow ing to the les sons drawn from this po lit i cal strug gle for in de pend ence, it dawned on the in tel li gen tsia that there had ac cu mu lated by then numerous shortcomings in scientific and cultural policy. The modernization of the aims of the National Academy of Sciences came to fore. Mod ern iza tion in in dus try, trans por ta tion and ag ri cul ture and the country’s constitutional and economic bonds with Austria positively influenced this de vel op ment. Between the Austro-Hungarian Com pro mise of 1867 and the col lapse of the Mon ar chy in 1918 the rates of growth in all ar eas were enor mous. The ex pan sion of mod ern mar ket-economy served the progress of the mathematical and natural sciences of this era and proved a healthy stim u lus to the ad vance ment of the arts and hu man i ties. Three newly founded uni ver si ties were added to the net work of higher ed u ca tional in sti tu tions. By the end of the nine teenth cen tu ry the coun try’s prog ress in sci ences, arts and sports equaled the West ern Eu ro pean pattern. The strong economic integration of fifty-two million people composed of some fifteen different nationalities, using a common cur rency, the rule of uni form laws, individual free dom and rel a tive pros per ity made this age “the good old times” in later years. Not all was well, though. Ag ri cul tural modernization forced many peas ants off the land. Em i gra tion to the United States reached a crit i cally high level. Of Hun gary’s 18 mil lion citizens, about 1.5 mil lion left the coun try be fore the first world war. Two-thirds of these were eth nic Hun gar i ans. American Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan characterized these emigrants as fol lows: “The 20 mil lion odd im mi grants who ar rived be tween 1870 and 1910 were not the wretched re fuse of any body’s shores. They\n\n28\n\nInterwar Years\n\nwere an ex traor di nary, en ter pris ing, and self-sufficient folk who knew ex actly what they were do ing, and do ing it quite on their own, thank you very much. Just as im por tant, the Eu rope they left be hind had at tained a gen eral de gree of ci vil ity and le gal ity un known in its his tory. If po lit i cal rights were not al ways ad vanced, civil rights gen er ally were15 .” In deed, Hungary’s 1868 nationality law, for example, allowed ev ery cit i zen to use his native language when corresponding with government offices and com pelled of fi cials to re spond in the same. The nar row vi sion, ig no rance and ar ro gance of many Hun garian pol i ticians bode ill for the fu ture. Not that they were entirely re spon si ble for the even tual dis so lu tion of the coun try. The forces of prog ress, eco nomic as well as tech no log i cal, sup ported the need for “Magyarization”. For in stance, just as the British and French railways disallowed the use of Welsh and Breton, man ag ers of the Hun gar ian rail ways were ob vi ously right not to al low Croat to be spo ken in of fi cial busi ness. Yet this was one of the al leged slights lead ing to the partition. Fifty-three per cent of the pop u la tion of his toric Hun gary was eth nic Hun gar ian. Be fore one calls for a judgement that this fact was a sound reason for partitioning the coun try, it should be re called that “French was con sid ered a for eign lan guage by roughly half of the pop u la tion that came of age in France in the last quar ter of the nine teenth cen tury” 16 . But the idea of na tion al ism won in the Danubian lands and as a re sult, the re gion was Balkanized at the end of World War I. In stead of one large coun try en com pass ing many na tion al i ties in an ef fi cient eco nomic unit, now there were sev eral eco nom i cally inefficient small coun tries en com pass ing many na tion al i ties. Eth nic in tol er ance, ra cial ha tred, op pres sion pro vided fer tile ground for the to tal i tar i an ism that came later.\n\n15\n\nDaniel Patrick Moynihan: Pandaemonium: Ethnicity in International Politics, Oxford University Press, 1993, p. 136.\n\n16\n\nEugen Weber: Peasants into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France, 1870 1914, Stanford University Press, 1976, p. 67.\n\n29\n\nMilestones of Progress\n\nInterwar Years The con clu sion of World War I and the Treaty of Trianon (June 4, 1920) en tirely changed Hun gary’s po si tion in the fam ily of na tions. Hungary’s success in these trying times largely rested in her rather unique his tory in the re gion. To quote the for mer ed i tor of The Econ o mist , Gra ham Hutton17 : “There is no peo ple in Eu rope as strongly in di vid u al is tic as the Hun gar ian and the strat i fi ca tion of Hun gary’s so cial sys tem is as like that of Eng land as the Hun gar ian Con sti tu tion and lim ited mon ar chy in like the Eng lish equiv a lents. Per haps that is why the Eng lish and Hungarian versions of ‘democracy’—less essentially democratic than those of other lib eral régimes in Eu rope—have been more suc cess ful than those of the German Weimar republic, France, Czecho-Slovakia, Belgium. For both England and Hungary, with their vestigial aristocracy, their rig idly de fined class and caste bar ri ers which ev ery one vol un tarily re spects, thereby gain in na tional co he sion.” . . . “a peo ple not will ing to be tyrannized; a grudging collaborator in peace, but a formidable blackmailer and re bel in time of war.” Indeed, Hungary was fortunate that in times of crisis she had larger-than-life lead ers. Like Széchenyi, Wesselényi and Andrássy in the pre vi ous century, now Bethlen, Apponyi and Teleki, all mem bers of the historic Magyar aristocracy—and, incidentally, all of Anglo-American po lit i cal ori en ta tion—were at hand to lead the trun cated, crushed na tion. The coun try’s se vere dis mem ber ment caused se ri ous eco nomic and po litical problems and perpetuated its financial crisis. As a means of self-aid—psychologically quite understandably—the official cultural pol icy fa vored ide al is tic trends to save the na tional spirit from to tal col lapse. As a con se quence, the of fi cial line em pha sized the pro mo tion of the\n\n17\n\nHutton, Graham: Danubian Destiny , London: Harrap, 1939, p.197\n\n30\n\nCommunism and Its Aftermath\n\nhu man i ties over most of the branches of sci ences. Yet the most out stand ing cul tural pol i ti cian be tween the wars, Kunó Klebelsberg, min is ter of ed u ca tion, did much in or ga niz ing sci en tific re search at uni ver si ties and at in de pend ent in sti tutes such as the Tihany In sti tute of Bi o log i cal Re search. He also re vived the age old Hun gar ian cus tom of pro vid ing gov ern ment sti pends for uni ver sity students to study abroad. Even though the catastrophic set backs caused by the loss of World War I, the partition of the country and the economic and social collapse, Hun gary has underwent a star tling re sur gence in sci ence and hu man i ties dur ing the inter-war years. Just as the eco nom ics of the coun try had straightened out, the Great Depression hit. As things got better again, the winds of war stirred. For several years Hungary was a beacon of peace and free dom for ref u gees from the sur round ing coun tries es cap ing Na ziism. For ex am ple, Hun gary main tained the only Pol ish uni ver sity on the Con ti nent, to serve the ref u gees from Hit ler’s at tack on Po land. French POW’s es cap ing from Ger man prison camps were put up by the Hungarian gov ern ment in a re sort on Lake Balaton. But on March 19, 1944, German oc cu pa tion com menced. Soon, the de por ta tion of Jews be gan. The coun try was forced into all out war and the in ev i ta ble sec ond ca tas tro phe of the cen tury occurred. Hun gary lost almost ten per cent of her pop u la tion by the end of World War II. She also lost her free dom.\n\nCommunism and Its Aftermath Towards the end of World War II, Pres i dent Roo se velt’s en thrall ment with Joseph Sta lin at Yalta sealed the fate of the coun tries of East Cen tral Eu rope. For 45 years Hun gary was forced into the So viet Un ion’s sphere of influence and became one of its reluctant satellites. About 600,000 Hungarians, soldiers and civilians alike, were taken to Soviet prison camps, one-third of them per ished there. The de struc tion caused by the war rep re sented 40 per cent of the na tion’s wealth, cal cu lated to be equal to 4,400 million 1938 U.S. dollars. The reparations paid to the Soviet Un ion (and in some part to Czechoslovakia and Yu go sla via) amounted to\n\n31\n\nMilestones of Progress\n\n$ 300 m.. Ger many’s war time debt to Hun gary, amount ing to $ 280 mil lion was can celed. How ever, Hun gary’s debt to Nazi Ger many, $ 30 mil lion, had to be paid back, to the So vi ets. An ad di tional $ 150 - 180 mil lion damage to German properties located in Hungary had to be compensated, to the Soviets. These payments rep re sented 17 per cent of Hun gary’s an nual gross na tional prod uct. The So vi ets have dis as sem bled and took home about 8 per cent of Hun gary’s fac to ries. In ad di tion the vic to ri ous Soviets stole entire contents of galleries and museums, some 100 thou sand ar ti facts, paint ings, Per sian rugs, jew elry, gold and other valu ables. Hun gary was also com pelled to feed the en tire oc cu py ing So viet Army. As a re sult in the years af ter the war the coun try could feed the cit i zens only 560 cal o ries a day, com pared to the 2700 daily cal o ries be fore the war. It took un til 1953 to make all the re quired pay ments. Hun gary was not al lowed to join the Mar shall Plan that re vived West ern Eu rope. Pres i dent Roo se velt’s con sent to East ern Eu rope’s oc cu pa tion by the Soviet Union not only determined the economic and political fate of the coun try but its in tel lec tual ori en ta tion as well. Directives is sued by the Central Committee of the Hun gar ian Com mu nist Party have trig gered po lit i cal and cul tural changes. Intellectual work ers have been com pelled to con duct their work ac cord ingly. At the onset of Communist rule Hungary’s leading intellectuals underwent a pain ful ad just ment. Many es caped the coun try and con tin ued their sci en tific work in the West. Oth ers were re moved from their pre vi ous positions. Some, for example Simon Papp, the famous geologist of Hungary’s oil fields, were forced to continue their scientific work in prison. For the fate of peo ple in the hu man i ties the life of some writ ers are char ac ter is tic. Writers József Nyirö, Sándor Márai and Al bert Wass chose emigration, Gyula Somogyváry, another popular novelist and former head of Hun gar ian Ra dio, died in prison, the peas ant writer Péter Veres became a pow er less fig ure head for the Com mu nist Gov ern ment. Many oth ers ‘wrote for their desk draw ers’, if they dared. The uni ver si ties were filled with largely un qual i fied stu dents from worker and peas ant fam i lies (an early form of affirmative ac tion). Those who made it through were sent to the So viet Un ion for fur ther ed u ca tion. The best of jobs in the sci -\n\n32\n\nCommunism and Its Aftermath\n\nen tific es tab lish ments were re served for them upon their re turn. “Class war fare” be came a dom i nant and pain ful mantra. Life in Hun gary achieved Or well ian over tones. The an ni ver sary of the com ple tion of So viet oc cu pa tion, April 4, when the last square me ter of the country was conquered, was named Liberation Day. Hungarian POWs were kept in the So viet Un ion for years. Mean while each vil lage was adorned with a heroes mon u ment, for So viet ones, of course. Slav ish adoration of anything Soviet and denunciation of the old became the rule. The common expression ‘good old days’ became ‘cursed old regime’ in Com mu nist par lance. If some one has shown the slight est bit of hes i tancy about the new faith, he or she may dis ap peared over night, of ten never to re turn. The re or ga ni za tion of the Hun gar ian Acad emy of Sci ences along So viet lines in 1949 made possible the planning and coordination of all high-level intellectual activities under the guidance and supervision of the Acad emy. The Com mu nist cen tral plan ning and co or di na tion of scientific research necessarily were closely as so ci ated with the coun try’s economic plans. In line with this policy, research institutes were required to solve first of all those problems which are in one way or another con nected with the top ics of cur rent eco nomic de mands and re quire ments. This util i tar ian ap proach led to ig nor ing the pri macy of ba sic research over industry-focused interests and applications. Mean while, dur ing the Com mu nist con trolled de cades the num ber and size of re search or ga ni za tions di rected by the Na tional Acad emy of Sci ences in creased tre men dously. For ex am ple, the Cen tral Re search In sti tute for Chem is try op er ated with a staff that in cluded over 220 highly trained researchers, in addition to a huge group of support personnel. Sim i lar sized in sti tutes dealt with phys ics, com puter sci ence and sev eral other sci en tific fields. Com mu nist dom i na tion over all as pect of life ex tended over the sci en tific com mu nity led by the Hun gar ian Acad emy of Sci ences. While giv ing lipservice to ac a demic in teg rity, in re al ity the Acad emy be came the\n\n33\n\nMilestones of Progress\n\nhotbed of in tel lec tual pros ti tu tion and the hand maiden of the au thor i ties. The August duties of Soviet style scientific degree granting, research funding, approval of foreign travel and advising the government with “sci en tific ex pert” opin ions were enlaced with co vert per sonal in ter ests, cronyism and greed. The spon ta ne ously trig gered Hun gar ian Rev o lu tion in 1956 shook the Communist rule not only in Hungary, but throughout the world. To quote Yu go slav Com mu nist pol i ti cian and writer, Milovan Djilas, who received a prison sen tence for voic ing his opin ion in 1957: “With the re volt of the Hun gar ian peo ple a new ep och has be gan in the his tory of hu man ity. . . The Hungarian Rev o lu tion is per haps no less im por tant than the great French Rev o lu tion or the Rus sian Rev o lu tion. . . It marks the be gin ning of the End of Com mu nism.” Brit ish his to rian Hugh Sea ton-Watson, no friend of Hun gary and son of the vir u lent anti-Monarchy pro pa gan dist R. W. Seaton-Watson wrote18 , “Although Hungarians were often quoted in the past in Eng land as a peo ple of ex trem ists com posed of feu dal land lords and slaves who served Hit ler, the facts in 1956 have shown that Hun gar i ans were among the first who, for a short time, de stroyed a totalitarian regime, whilst the Czechs were stand ing ap plaud ing loudly with self-satisfaction and ma li cious joy at the bru tal sub ju ga tion of Hun gary by the So viet forces.” Even though the fight against the So viet tanks was lost in 1956, a slow liberalization began in Hungary, with gradually increasing freedom of scientific research, arts, and literature. The Communist authorities be came in creas ingly free-handed while they bor rowed enor mous amounts of for eign loans to main tain the “goulash com mu nism”, “the hap pi est barracks in the camp.”\n\n18\n\nLondon Times, March 16, 1960:\n\n34\n\nCommunism and Its Aftermath\n\nWith the end of the Com mu nist era much of the cen tral fi nanc ing of the bloated re search or ga ni za tions of the Acad emy of Sci ences was re duced sig nif i cantly. The in sti tutes were forced to seek out side fund ing through industrial, applied research. Many of the most qualified researchers went out of the coun try seek ing per ma nent or tem po rary as sign ments at universities and research organizations in Europe and in the United States. In 1998 there were 966 Hun gar ian re search ers work ing abroad, ac cord ing to a re port by the Hun gar ian Acad emy of Sci ences. Ten years af ter the demise of Com mu nism, by the end of the 1990’s conditions in scientific research have stabilized. Recognizing the high level of technical education and the availability of well trained talent, scores of West ern com pa nies have built man u fac tur ing plants and es tab lished re search or ga ni za tions in Hun gary. Com panies like IBM, Nokia, Ericson are a few ex am ples. Gov ern men tal pro grams, no ta bly a pro ject initiated by the National Technical Development Council in March, 1998, aims at the increase of multinational firms’ involvement in research and de vel op ment based in Hun gary. Giving back the con trol over re search to uni ver si ties is in creas ingly talked about. Such moves will as sure that the na tion’s numerous sci en tists will be able to uti lize their tal ents with out re sort ing to em i gra tion.

Wag ner Far from be ing merely a pop u lar av o ca tion or a charm ing and dec o ra tive pas time, Hun gar ian folk art is a mul ti form, high cal i ber man i fes ta tion of pro fes sional art istry. Hun gar ian folk art em braces the fine arts of paint ing, sculp ture, mu sic and dance as well as the ap plied arts of met al work, in clud ing, gold-, sil ver-, iron- and coppersmithery; leather work; carv ing from stone, wood, bone and horn; the mak ing of stained glass win dows; em broi dery, spin ning and weav ing and a mul ti tude of oth ers. Of them all it is tex tile work and ce ram ics that at tained the high est de gree of per fec tion. As with ev ery folk art, the di verse forms of Hun gar ian folk art mir ror the emo tions of its peo ple. In the case of the Hun gar i ans, an in erad i ca ble sense of hu mor, an ir re press ible joie de vi vre , an en thu si as tic love of cer emony and a pro found ap pre ci a tion of the aes thetic. The fu sion of func tionalism and aestheticism is a hallmark of the Hungarian artistic tem per a ment. Again as with any folk art, Hun gar ian folk art is an out growth of the peo ple’s life style, which in turn is molded by the coun try’s his tory. As such, the two his tor i cal fac tors leav ing the deep est im print on Hun gary’s folk art. These were the Turk ish oc cu pa tion of Hun gary and the Ital ian Re nais sance. The Turk ish in flu ence was es pe cially strong in embroidery. How ever, strong na tional tra di tion amal gam ated with ar tis tic abil ity made it pos sible to meld two such dif fer ent ar tis tic styles as East ern and West ern into a bal anced, har mo ni ous unity which was dis tinctly Hun gar ian in char acter.\n\n37\n\nThe Arts\n\nAs early as the ninth cen tury dec o ra tive arts flour ished among the Hun garian people—the Magyars—at a relatively high level. Although they were a semi-nomadic, eques trian peo ple at the time, dec o ra tion of cloth ing was wide spread. Con tem po rary eye wit nesses ex pressed amaze ment at the Magyars’ pro fi ciency and imag i na tion in fab ri cat ing and em bel lishing ar mor and at their mas tery of the dec o ra tive branches of the metal crafts and leather craft. Ninth cen tury bri dles, trap pings, har nesses, stir rups, arrowheads, sword blades and other artifacts bear witness to the Hungarian philosophy that what is functional need be simultaneously aesthetic. With out doing a com pre hen sive, in-depth sur vey of the Hun gar ian folk arts, so let us touch upon a few spe cific art forms. As to folk mu sic, it be hooves us to point out that such internationally renowned giants as Ferenc Liszt, Zoltán Kodály and Béla Bartók are in debted to the an cient folk mel o dies and har monic pat terns of their home land, which form the ba sis of their com po si tions. Among the wealth of folk dances the internationally best known and loved is the national dance of Hungary: the regal, dynamic and explosively pas sion ate csárdás (pro nounced Char’dahsh). Paint ing em braces, among other rep re sen ta tives, the ex qui site free hand adorn ments of the in te rior as well as the ex te rior walls of peas ant homes. These cheery, viv idly mul ti col ored works of art are es pe cially ev i dent in the town of Kalocsa, south of Bu da pest and near the Dan ube. The de signs in dec o ra tive folk art are pre dom i nantly flo ral, the most fa vored being tulips, lilies and carnations, with profusion of petals as space-fillers. Other motifs include fruits, such as the pomegranate and an i mals, with birds, es pe cially the pea cock, be ing the most pop u lar. Hu man fig ures are rarely de picted. Other char ac ter is tic is the pref er ence for cer tain col ors, es pe cially red and the rare use of oth ers, such as yel low and purple.\n\n38\n\nFolk Art\n\nCarving is a ver sa tile art. It is the herds man’s art. The ma te ri als he em ploys are gen er ally wood, bone and horn. He em bel lishes count less ob jects of his metier as well as per sonal use, in clud ing the han dle of his herds man’s whip, his pipe, match box and flute. Herds men ex cel at carv ing be cause the long, un event ful hours spent mind ing their flocks af ford the op por tu nity for much prac tice. But carv ing is by no means re stricted to the herds man or the me dia he uti lizes. Cases in point are fur ni ture, buildings—including details on peasant cottages such as arcaded porches, ga bles, roofs—ceil ings and bel fries of churches, gates and other struc tures which ex hibit elab o rate carv ings. In deed, in Transylvania the very shovel used for digging graves is splen didly dec o rated with carv ings, not to men tion grave mark ers. Also, it is a mat ter of re cord that in a prison of old a peas ant carved on a laun dry man gle board the story of how he had clob bered a tax col lec tor and the mal ice of the judges had landed him in the pokey. Em broi dery is one of the most in ter est ing of the folk arts. Its or i gins can be traced back to the elev enth cen tury when Queen Gisela, wife of Ste phen I, the first king of Hun gary, main tained a work room for em broi dery. As early as the fourteenth century professional craftsmen were producing em broi dery which was re nowned through out Hun gary and abroad. As a mat ter of fact, the mas ter embroiderer of the king of France between 1384 and 1417 was a man named Aden de Hongrie, which is trans lated Ste phen of Hun gary. In the six teenth cen tury Hun gary cre ated a new style of em broi dery which was a merger of East ern and West ern mo tifs, yet char ac ter is ti cally Hun gar ian. Items embroidered are endless, including bookmarks, saddles, boots, pil lows and bed clothes, cloaks and man tels, ta ble cloths and aprons. As a matter of fact, in the seventeenth century, Hungarians were ardently em broi der ing prac ti cally everything they could get their hands on, in clud ing la dies’ lin ge rie and gen tle men’s un der cloth ing. Em broi dery and na tive cos tume-making are in ter de pen dent and per haps the most sym bolic and ex pres sive of the Hun gar ian way of life. A\n\n39\n\nThe Arts\n\nsym met ri cally ar ranged flower clus ter or vine con sti tutes the dom i nant mo tif of Hun gar ian em broi dery, with a dif fer ent flower usu ally grow ing from ev ery branch of the stem. There are many vari a tions on this mo tif, some in clud ing fruits. About 25 stitches are known. Among the ma te ri als used for em broi der ing are gold and sil ver threads, coral, pearls, lace, silk, taf feta, satin and bro cade. De pending on the col ors, fab ric, style, em broi dery and the par tic u lar ar ti cle of cloth ing, the ob server of the Hun gar ian na tive cos tume was able to as cer tain the wearer’s sex, age bracket, so cio eco nomic sta tus, pos si bly his oc cu pa tion, the re gion of the coun try he hails from, mar i tal sta tus and the oc ca sion for which he is at tired. For ex am ple, older women wear more sparsely embroidered clothes and more somber colors than younger women, the fi ery red of youth grad u ally giv ing way with the pas sage of time to green, blue, then fi nally black. Un mar ried girls gen er ally go bare headed but on festive occasions wear a wreath-like headdress called a párt a (pahr’tuh). Older women wear coifs or ker chiefs, while young mar ried women with out chil dren sport the most sump tu ously or nate head dresses of all. An other ex am ple of the story na tive cos tume tells is the wear ing of a cer tain hand ker chief to re veal that a young man is en gaged. Called a be trothal hand ker chief and made for him by his fi an cee, each of its 4 cor ners is em broi dered in a dif fer ent pat tern and each Sunday the young man wears it to church he will dis play a dif fer ent cor ner. Hungarian lace makers, especially those of the town of Halas, have raised their ex qui site art to the level of the in ter na tion ally ac claimed Bel gian lace. In style there is no dif fer ence be tween the garb of the rich and poor. The only vari ance is that a wealthy per son would have a greater quan tity of costumes and they would be fash ioned of more ex pen sive and richly dec orated materials.Unfortunately, the wear ing of folk cos tumes has gone out of style as in dus tri al iza tion be came uni ver sal. To day, folk dresses are made for com mer cial pur poses, to be sold to tour ists.\n\n40\n\nFolk Art\n\nPot tery is one of the most var ied and col or ful branches of folk art. The Great Hun gar ian Plains (Alföld) is the seat of pot tery-making. There are two ba sic types of pot tery: mul ti col ored, glazed ce ram ics and un glazed, smoked black earth en ware. De sign and shape, of course, vary ac cord ing to oc ca sion and use. The widely known Zsolnay Factory began as a small china maker’s shop around the mid dle of the nine teenth cen tury. In just a few years, under the artistic leadership of Vilmos Zsolnay (1828-1900), this little shop was trans formed into a top notch fac tory. The Zsolnay Fac tory used the eosin formula invented by Vince Wartha in decorating its objets d’art. This in no va tion made the Zsolnay prod ucts fa mous in most Eu ro pean coun tries by the last quar ter of the nine teenth cen tury. Since the Zsolnay por ce lains were awarded the Grand Prix at the Paris World Ex hi bi tion in 1900 they gained pop u lar ity the world over. The roof of Bu dapest’s Coronation Church (Mátyás templom) is tiled with Zsolnay porcelain tiles. The ar tis tic achieve ments of the Zsolnay Fac tory have re sulted in a continuous chain of in ter na tional suc cesses which are well doc u mented in The Zsolnay Fam ily1 writ ten by Teréz Zsolnay and Margit Zsolnay Mattyasovszky. It would be sacrilegious to speak of Hungarian folk art, much less of pottery, without mentioning the world-famous porcelains of Herend. They are the crown ing glory of the folk art of pot tery. Be cause of its ex cep tional crafts man ship, beau ti ful and nu mer ous hues and imag i na tive wealth of de signs, it be came sought af ter by in ter na tional con nois seurs of art and those with ex qui site taste. The Herend fac tory has been in ex is tence since 1839. Herend por ce lain won ac claim at many in ter na tional and na tional ex hib its. Here in Amer ica at the 1853 New York Ex hi bi tion of In dus trial Art the di rec tor of the\n\n1\n\nA Zsolnay Család , Budapest: Corvina Press, 1974. 240 p., 48 illus.\n\n41\n\nThe Arts\n\nHerend fac tory was awarded a di ploma and a medal in rec og ni tion of the por ce lain’s su perb qual ity. At the 1855 World’s Fair in Paris, ev ery sin gle piece of Herend por ce lain was sold. Queen Vic to ria of Eng land or dered a very large Herend ta ble ser vice for Wind sor Cas tle. Need less to say, the Eng lish ar is toc racy flocked to fol low suit and own er ship of Herend be came all the rage. The 14th pres i dent of the United States, Frank lin Pierce, also joined the ranks of the many il lus tri ous own ers of Herend. King of Hun gary and Aus trian Em peror Franz Josef, still another customer, presented his mother, the Archduchess Sophia, with a tea set. Other cel e brated fig ures in the course of his tory to own Herend china in clude the Rus sian czar, Al ex an der II; King Vic tor Emmanuel of Italy; King Edward VII of England; and one of the Rothschild sci ons whose fam ily name is now borne by the fa mous de sign made es pe cially for him. Herend por ce lain is in creas ingly prized to day, a ma jor rea son be ing that it con tin ues to hold out as the only ma jor por ce lain fac tory in the world which has refused to tarnish its artistry by “going commercial”, so to speak and adopt ing as sem bly line meth ods and fully mech a nized pro duc tion. On the con trary, one has the as sur ance that ev ery piece of Herend china is hand painted by in di vid ual art ists and mas ters, each spe cial iz ing in a re spec tive tech nique. Al though the sec ond half of the nine teenth cen tury saw the golden age of folk art, it is far from stag nant today. The char ac ter is tic fea tures of an cient Hun gar ian folk art live on to be en riched by ever-evolving new ma te ri als, new ob jects and new styles to meet the de mands of the times.\n\n42\n\nArchitecture by Fran cis S. Wag ner Inspirations for medieval architecture in Hungary came from several cen ters of the West. The Ro man esque style was most closely linked with South Germany, Austria and Northern Italy. The Italian style is reflected in the grand Ca the dral of Pécs with its four tow ers, whereas the ab bey churches of Ják, Lébény and Zsámbék re veal the Ger man Ro man esque in flu ence. The con struc tion in the Gothic style of the Cor o na tion Church (Mátyás templom) in Bu da pest, shown on the in side cover of this book, be gan in the sec ond half of the thir teenth cen tury and was com pleted dur ing the reign of Matthias Corvinus (1458-1490). Internationally speaking, the reign of King Matthias and the de cades fol low ing boasted the most out stand ing phase of the coun try’s ar chi tec ture. The King was a pa tron of famous Italian masters and preferred the new style in ar chi tec ture. In church art, the beau ti ful Bakócz Cha pel (1507) in Esztergom Ca the dral (Ba sil ica) also shows the Ital ian in flu ence. A number of churches were built in these centuries which now deservedly are tourist attractions. Among them are the 14th century Church of St. Mi chael in Kolozsvár, (now Cluj, Ro ma nia), the sim i larly 14th century Parish Church of the Inner City of Budapest (Belvárosi templom), and the im pres sive early 15th cen tury St. Eliz a beth’s Ca the dral of Kassa, (now Kosice, Slovakia). In the six teenth and sev en teenth cen tu ries the mon u ments of the Turkish oc cu pa tion (mosques, min a rets, baths, etc., at Pécs, Eger and Bu da pest) ap peared and pre sented a vivid con trast to West ern art. Al though dur ing this pe riod some for tresses were erected (at Györ and elsewhere)\n\n43\n\nThe Arts\n\naf ter the new Ital ian mod els, fol low ing the Turk ish oc cu pa tion, it was the Aus trian and Bo he mian Ba roque which dom i nated the stage in ar chi tec ture. Among the most representative of the Baroque style are the Esterházy Pal ace at Kismarton (now Eisenstadt, Aus tria) across the Aus trian bor der built be tween 1663 and 1672, the huge Esterházy Pal ace at Fertöd (1764) and the Ly ceum at Eger (1765-1785). Very soon Neo-Classicism triumphed over the Baroque style. The re markable Cathedral at Vác (1763-1777) is one of its masterpieces. The mo tifs of Neo-Classicism cul mi nate in the strik ingly beau ti ful Ca the dral of Esztergom (1822-c. 1850) built by János Packh (1796-1839) and József Hild (1789-1867). A cre ation like wise rep re sen ta tive of neo-classic style is Mihály Pol lack’s (1773-1885) Hun gar ian Na tional Mu seum (1836-1845) in Bu da pest. Mihály Pol lack was the lead ing clas si cist of his age. He stud ied in Mi lan un der his brother, Leopoldo Pol lack (1751-1806), who was assistant to Piermarini. Mihály Pollack built several pri vate and pub lic buildings, completing the Theater and Assembly Room in Warsaw in 1832 and build ing the Royal Army Of fi cer School, Ludoviceum in Bu da pest from 1829 through 1836. The richly embellished Italianate Opera House in Budapest (1875-1884), a su preme ar tis tic achieve ment of Miklós Ybl (1814-1891), marks the peak of eclec ti cism. Sim i larly, the world-renowned Par lia ment Building in Budapest (1885-1902)—built for a country three times its present size—a work of Imre Steindl (1839-1902), is the apex of nineteenth-century eclec ti cism and the late re vival of Gothic ar chi tec ture. Af ter a while the movement of Art Nou veau re volted against eclec ti cism. Ödön Lechner (1845-1914) was one of the most bril liant crafts men of Art Nou veau ar chi tec ture. He also ad vo cated the cre ation of a na tional (Hungarian) architecture. The attractive Postal Savings Bank in Budapest (now called the Hun gar ian Na tional Bank) is one of Lechner’s many ar tis tic de signs. Fishermen’s Bastion on Budapest’s Castle Hill (Halászbástya, 1901-1902), built in a highly picturesque style of architecture, was de signed by Frigyes Schulek (1841-1919), who was in flu enced by me di eval\n\n44\n\nArchitecture\n\nart so deeply that he applied his craftsmanship primarily to the restoration of his toric mon u ments. In post war years, the coun try’s lead ing ar chi tects con formed their art to the eclec tic style then to Clas si cism, which trends have grad u ally dis ap peared. As of now, the most in ter est ing work is be ing done in the realm of in dus trial ar chi tec ture. The newly erected build ings of the Re search Institute for Iron and Metals designed by Jenö Lauber and József Szendröi, the Warehouse of Pharmaceutical Products at Köbánya (1954-1957) designed by Jenö Juhász, the Hotel “Aranyhomok” at Kecskemét built af ter the de signs of István Janáky, the Of fice Block of Chemolimpex in Bu da pest de signed by Zoltán Gulyás and the monumental Peo ple’s Sta dium de signed by Károly Dávid demonstrate that the coun try’s ar chi tec ture has em brac ed the uni ver sal ideas of modern architecture. Bio graph i cal sketches of some of the out stand ing mas ter build ers may help elu ci date the pro gres sive tra di tions char ac ter is tic of the Hungarian meth ods of train ing ar chi tects. László Warga (1878-1952) was brought up in Kolozsvár and stud ied at the Tech ni cal Uni ver sity of Bu da pest. While an em ployee of the city of Bu da pest from 1902 to 1927, he was in vited to be come the first pro fes sor at the newly cre ated chair for ur ban de sign at the Uni ver sity. He re tired from that po si tion in 1934, but for two years sub se quently he con trib uted his full-time ser vice with out pay. As a young man he was an em ployee, later the leader, of the sec tion for ur ban de sign at Bu da pest. His plan for the Tabán (an old sec tion of Bu da pest) won gen eral ac claim at the In ter na tional Ex hi bi tion for Ur ban De sign in Berlin (1910). Those of his plans dat ing from 1912-1913 al ready clearly ev i dence his in de pend ent ap proach. In 1913 in his plans for Kelenföld (a then newly de vel oped area of Bu da pest) he ap plied for the first time, and years in ad vance of any one else, the gar den city con cepts of city de vel op ment. This later be came gen er ally ac cepted by mod ern city plan ners all over the globe. His plans were noted for their bal ance be tween re quire ments of traf fic flow\n\n45\n\nArchitecture\n\nand eco nom ics on the one hand and aes thetic and health con sid er ations on the other. Warga emphasized the well-proportioned distribution of parks and even in sisted that these ar eas form a con tin u ous chain of green ar eas, later gen er ally re ferred to as “green belts”. His plans al lowed ev ery part of the whole to have a direct link to “open nature” parks or water bodies. His ideas had a de ter mi na tive ef fect on city plan ning all over the world. László Warga par tic i pated with great suc cess in ur ban de sign com pe ti tions within Hungary, for instance plans for Kassa (now Kosice, Slovakia), Miskolc, Székesfehérvár, Szombathely, Salgótarján). He was also suc cess ful abroad, for ex am ple in the in ter na tional com pe ti tions for the re de vel op ment of the in ner city in Can berra (Aus tra lia) and Bir ming ham (Eng land), the for tress area in Ant werp (Bel gium, 1910), the city of Brassó (now Brasov, Romania, 1911) and the city of Belgrade (1922). Warga mailed his plan for Bel grade from Paris in stead of Bu da pest in or der to avoid the anti-Hungarian prejudice rampant in Belgrade after World War I. When he won first prize and his identity was finally re vealed, it caused a sensation. His plans were acclaimed at the International Exhibition for Urban Design in London (1924) and in Tokyo (1925). His new ap proach mo ti vated sev eral large cit ies —New York, To kyo, Mi lan among them—to send a group of ex perts to study the meth ods of city plan ning em ployed in Bu da pest. Warga pre pared with spe cial care and love the plans for Kolozsvár. He do nated his time for this work, even af ter this over whelm ingly Hun gar ian-inhabited city came un der Ro ma nian rule af ter World War I and again af ter World War II. Mar cel Lajos Breuer (1902, Pécs,- 1981) left Hun gary to be come one of the best-known archit ects of our age. He went to London in 1935 and then to Har vard in 1937. Prior to his com ing to the United States, Mar cel Breuer worked in the Bauhaus work shop, which rep re sented a move ment ini ti ated in Ger many hav ing as its aim the in te gra tion of art and tech nol ogy. Breuer’s in de pend ent prac tice in the United States gained mo men tum only after World War II. One of his masterpieces is the Whitney Museum in New York City. Later, his practice spread to several other coun tries (Bijenkorf, Rot ter dam, 1953; UNESCO, Paris, 1953). His New\n\n46\n\nSculpture\n\nYork of fice was a world cen ter for widely ac cepted ar chi tec tural in no va tions. Breuer de signed sev eral build ings through out the world which are con sid ered as true re flec tions of his ge nius.\n\nSculpture Among medieval Europe’s artistic movements, Hungarian sculpture with its bronze hu man fig ures and eques trian stat ues, oc cu pied a spe cial place. In the sec ond half of the four teenth cen tury the Kolozsvári broth ers, Márton (Martinus) and György (Georgius), created several such bronze fig ures. In 1373 they sculpted the world-famous mounted fig ure of St. George which now stands in the courtyard of the Hradcany in Prague. Both the hu man fig ure and the horse are dis tin guished by vivid re al ism. The con cept of re al ism be ing al to gether un known in that age, the two broth ers in tro duced an en tirely new mode in the uni ver sal his tory of sculp ture. Ex ca va tions in the last de cades at the one time royal cas tles of Buda and Visegrád un earthed a lot of out stand ing stone carvings from the four teenth and fif teenth cen tu ries. At the Royal Court of King Matthias I myth o log i cal fig ures, foun tains from which wine flowed, red mar ble or naments, etc., rep re sented a tran si tion from the Gothic to the Re nais sance style. The im mense dev as ta tion of the Siege of Bu da pest in 1945 al lowed archeologists to ex ca vate at the site of bombed out sev en teenth century buildings, finding valuable treasures in fifteenth century and older ru ins un der neath. Huge num bers of stone art work were found as well in par ish churches, cha pels and in the man sions of wealthy aris to crats and of the bour geoi sie. But the Turk ish in va sion nearly put an end to the large-scale ar tis tic evo lu tion. As a re sult Ro man esque, Gothic, Renais sance and Ba roque se pul chral mon u ments are the main rep re sen ta tives of the var i ous stages of sculp tural de vel op ment in the six teenth and sev en teenth cen tu ries.\n\n47\n\nSculpture\n\nIn mediaeval times Hungary’s mines sup plied a large share of Eu rope’s gold. Hence Hun gar ian goldsmithery as sumed the lead in Eu rope dur ing the Gothic pe riod, that is, in the fif teenth and six teenth cen tu ries. Ev ery kind of technique flourished. The world-renowned Calvary of King Matthias I is an im por tant sam ple of the gold smith’s art. The Calvary is ex hib ited at the Chris tian Mu seum in Esztergom. Miklós Tótfalusi-Kis (1650?-1702) studied theology in Reformed schools in Transylvania and was the school master in Fogaras when he was in vited by Bishop Mihály Tófeus to travel to Hol land and su per vise the print ing of the first Hun gar ian Bi ble. He went there in 1680, plan ning to learn the printing trade as well as attending a university. However, war time con di tions caused the loss of all con tacts with his Hun gar ian su pe ri ors. Be ing left alone, he con cen trated on print ing the Bi ble. Af ter ar du ous work in cor rect ing the trans la tion, he rented a small print shop and printed the Bi ble, fol lowed by the Psalms and the New Tes ta ment. In the process he learned the de sign of typefaces—prob a bly learn ing his trade in Hol land from the mas ter type founder Dirk Voskens—and by 1684 he be came sought af ter for his ex cel lent font de signs. His fonts were in tro duced in England, Germany, and Italy. He even created fonts for the Greek, He brew, Ar me nian and Gruzian lan guages. In 1689 he re turned to Transylvania. His fonts are still pop u lar to day. Actually, Kis de signed the type faces that were pre vi ously at trib uted to Anton Janson, a Dutch man working in Leip zig from 1668 to 1687. These sturdy Dutch types were the ex am ples from which Brit ish type founder Wil liam Caslon de vel oped his in com pa ra ble de signs. The fact that Kis was the orig i nal de signer was uncovered by Englishman Harry Carter, with the aid of György Buday, in 1954. In re mem brance of Tótfalusi Kis, the body text of this book is set in his type faces. Par al lel to the re vival of pa tri o tism in the first de cades of the nine teenth cen tury, István Ferenczy (1792-1856) carved busts in stone or mar ble of eminent public figures of the national revival movement. Perhaps the most ar tis tic of these carv ings is the bust of Ferenc Kazinczy, a lead ing fig ure of the Hungarian literary revival. Be gin ning his stud ies in Vi enna,\n\n48\n\nSculpture\n\nFerenczy continued in Rome under the masters Canova and Thorwaldsen, the great est sculp tors of that pe riod. Miklós Izsó (1831-1875) learned the ru di ments of sculp ture in the stu dio of István Ferenczy and con tin ued his stud ies in Vi enna. Partly as a re action to the Habsburg rule, Izsó revolted against the rigid academic forms. Rural themes de rived from the sim ple life of peas ant peo ple were fre quent fea tures in his art. His Shep herd in Grief , is one of his many carv ings ex em pli fy ing his life-like style. The Austro-Hungarian Com pro mise of 1867 helped nour ish in tel lec tual life in Hungary. The de mand for art grew. The newly founded Bu da pest Acad emy ed u cated many a young sculp tor. Alajos Stróbl, János Fadrusz and György Zala were the most gifted among them, but Alajos St róbl (1856-1926) was the great est of them all. Stróbl pro duced many of the best monuments in Bu da pest—for in stance, the stat ues of fa mous musicians and writ ers, Ferenc Li"
