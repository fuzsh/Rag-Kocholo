Larger than most pockets yet kind to the purse, The Hutchinson Concise Dictionary of Music belongs to Foss's second category. Abridged from the acclaimed single-volume Hutchinson Encyclopedia of Music (1995), published in association with BBC 'Music' Magazine, and descended from the highly regarded Everyman (later New Every­ man) Dictionary of Music, this new reference work draws directly on a long and distinguished line of musical expertise, in particular the accumulated scholarship of those who were involved in editing or revising its 'family' volumes (notably Eric Blom, Sir Jack Westrup, and David Fallows, and latterly David Cummings and Tallis Barker). However, every inherited entry has been thoroughly scrutinized, information has been updated in the light of recent research and about 100 new articles commensurate with the Dictionary's declared purpose have been commissioned. The production of a more compact version of a large work that has already proved its usefulness requires a particular focus and a strict policy of selection. The chosen emphasis is the fundamentals of music, those technical and theoretical aspects which provide the foundation of any musical education. The volume thus comprises entries about the various musical genres, forms and the myriad instructions annotated in musical scores, biographies of composers (with lists of principal compositions), and information about significant works in the repertory, librettists, instruments and their mainstream repertory, instrument makers, theorists and musicologists, patrons, writers (on whose writings compositions are based), and some famous conductors in history. Excluded from\n\nIntroduction\n\nviii\n\nits contents are biographies of instrumental performers and singers (apart from some performers who are also composers and some celebrated castrati), publishers, critics and writers on music, producers, directors, teachers and choreographers, as well as information about theatres and festivals. With this sharp focus, The Hutchinson Concise Dictionary of Music addresses the needs of a wide range of users. Experienced and well-informed professional musicians, whatever many-volumed works of reference they may possess, occasionally have need also of one manageable book to which they can turn with the assurance that they will there be able to read a concise survey of some subject that interests them or find quickly some fact, name, date, musical term or opus number that has momentarily slipped their minds; avid concert-goers, enthusiastic CD collectors, and regular radio­ listeners will equally welcome one which will inform without being beyond either the scope of their pockets or the depth of their understanding; and music students, whether as entrants for national examinations in the theory of music or candidates for more advanced qualifications such as GCSE, 'A' level, and some courses in higher education, will also find it an invaluable information resource on many counts. The Dictionary has been endorsed by the Open University as a recommended reference work for some of its music courses - it is a set text for A214: Understanding Music: Elements, Techniques and Styles - and it is fitting that two distinguished scholars of the Open University's Music Department, Professor Donald Burrows and Dr. Barrie Jones have been associated with the careful selection and editing of its contents. The result of their labours is a balanced, coherent, and authoritative volume which provides an accurate and concise reference source for the core technical, biographical, organological, and other information vital to the comprehension and enjoyment of music. Remarkable for its high standards of scholarship, clarity of language, and the accessibility of its text, this Dictionary never makes formidable reading for the novice, pinpoints ample cross­ references for the reader's further edification, and gives excellent value for money. Comprising approximately 7,500 entries and over 100 musical examples, it offers an indispensable storehouse of information to the layman and serves as a useful reminder to the\n\nix\n\nIntroduction\n\nexpert as well as an invaluable research tool to the music student of all ages and in a wide variety of spheres.

An 'Accademia di Platone' was founded, on Plato's model, at the Medici court of Florence in 1470. The earliest academy of any importance devoted primarily to music was the 'Accademia Filarmonica' of Verona (1543); later ones included the 'Accademia di Santa Cecilia' at Rome (1584) and the 'Acca­ demia Filarmonica' at Bologna (1666).

Accents are dynamic, adding loudness; agogic, enlarging the beat (as in Viennese waltz rhythm); metrical, shifting the beat, as in syncopation; or timbre, as in melody accentuation using a wah-wah note. Normally the main accent is on the first beat after the bar-line, and in any music divided into bars of more than three beats there is usually a secondary accent, less strongly stressed. Strong accents are marked by the sign > or by the abbreviations sf (sforzando) or fz (forzando).\n\nto which a string instrument is timed.\n\naccordion musical instrument of the freereed organ type, comprising left and right wind chests connected by flexible, pleated bellows. The accordionist's right hand plays the melody on a piano-style keyboard of 26­ 34 keys, while the left hand has a system of push buttons for selecting single notes or chord harmonies. It was patented under the name of Handaoline by Friedrich Buschmann (1805-1864) in Berlin in 1822, and by Cyrill Damien (1772­ 1847) under the name Akkordion (German 'harmony') in Vienna in 1829.

A composite, bilingual version of this and Handel's Italian serenata (1708) received several performances in 1732. Galatea trans­ forms Acis into a fountain, after he has been killed by the jealous Polyphemus.\n\nAcis et Galate'e/Acis and Galatea opera by Lully (libretto by J G de Campistron), produced at Anet at an entertainment given for the Dauphin by the Duke of Vendome, 6 September 1686, first performed Paris, 17 September 1686.\n\nacousmatic music music in which the composer uses electronic or computer-based means to shape sounds directly, without the use of notation or performers. The original sounds may be recorded or synthesized, or both. More or less synonymous with electro­ acoustic music.\n\nacoustic term describing a musical instru­ ment played without electrical amplification or assistance, for example an acoustic guitar or acoustic piano. It is also a term used by musicians to characterize room response, an important factor in performance. A so-called 'bright' acoustic provides a lively reverbera­ tion while a 'dry' or 'm uddy' acoustic is lacking in response; see l>acoustics. The Royal Festival Hall, London, designed with a neoclassical dry acoustic, had electri­ cally assisted reverberation installed shortly\n\nand propagation, embracing psychoacoustics, a branch of communications science.\n\natronym any coded reference to a name using the letter-names of notes to form a motif. The most widely quoted is B-A-C-H, playing on the German note names B (Bb)-AC-H (Btj); Schumann's Abegg Variations 1830 is dedicated to his friend Meta Abegg; Berg's Chamber Concerto 1923-25 includes motivic references to himself and Schoenberg. D-S-C-H is the acronym for Dimitri SCHostakovich (German spelling, S being 'Es' or Eb), the basis of a monumental Passacaglia on DSCH 1961-62 by Ronald Stevenson. Boulez's tribute to Paul Sacher in Messagesquisse 1977 incorporates the French 'Re' for R.\n\naction the internal mechanism of a keyboard instrument, such as the piano, harpsichord, or organ, which links the keys to the strings or pipes when the keys are depressed. On a string instrument, it refers to the space between the strings and the l>fingerboard.\n\naction musicale (French ‘in two parts’) a term used by Vincent d'Indy for some of his operas, evidently on the model of Wagner's 'Handlung fur Musik'.\n\nact tune term used in 17th-century England for a musical intermezzo or entr'acte performance between the acts of a play.\n\nActus Tragicus name often given to Bach's church cantata no. 106, Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit. Composed c. 1707 for a funeral, adagietto (Italian a tempo) direction indicat­ ing a pace slightly quicker than adagio. Bestknown example is the fourth movement of M ahler's 5th symphony.\n\nadagio (Italian ‘at ease’, ‘leisurely’) in musical notation, indicating a slow pace, slightly faster than or approximately the same as Olento, depending on the historical period in which the music was written. It is also used as the title of a piece of music, or as the distinguishing title of a single movement. Adam,\n\nAdolphe\n\nCharles\n\n(1803-1856)\n\nFrench composer of light operas and founder of the Theatre National, Paris, in 1847.

Around 80 of his works were staged. He wrote about 20 vaudeville pieces for three Paris theatres, 1824-29, then an\n\nAdler, Samuel\n\n5 operetta, Pierre et Catherine, for the OperaComique in 1829, and his first opera, Danilowa, in 1830. He was allowed to study at the Paris Conservatory only as an amateur, but eventually became professor of composition there in 1849. His autobiographical Souvenirs d'un musicien/A Musician's Memories and Demiers souvenirs d'un musicien/Last Memories o f a Musician were published 1857-59.

His feu de la feuillee c. 1277 is one of the earliest French comedies. His Le Jeu de Robin et Marion, written in Italy c. 1282, is a theatrical work with dialogue and songs set to what were apparently popular tunes of the day.

Deeply influenced by the thought of Karl Marx, Adorno joined the influential Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt in 1931, becoming known as a member of the 'Frankfurt School' of sociolo­ gists. At the rise of Fascism he fled first to Oxford (1935-38) and then to the USA, eventually returning to Frankfurt as Professor of Philosophy in 1949. As a young man, Adorno studied composi­ tion with Alban Berg, and he remained a great defender of the New Music of the Second Viennese School, which he saw as the 'authentic voice' of 20th-century music. He wrote prolifically on music, combining a practitioner's knowledge of compositional technique with his philosophical training, producing writings of forbidding intellectual complexity, but also of undoubted and profound insight. He is particularly known for his studies of individual composers, such as Philosophy o f M odem Music (1948, on Schoenberg and Stravinsky), In Search o f Wagner (1952), and Mahler: A Musical Physiog­ nomy (1960).\n\nAdrastus (lived 4th century BC) Greek philosopher.

It produces an eerie harmony that rises and falls with the chan­ ging pressure of the wind. It originated in India and China, becoming popular in parts of central Europe during the 19th century. The instrument is named after Aeolus, the god of the winds in Greek mythology. Aeolian mode the mode or scale A -G , centred around and beginning on A, which uses only the notes of the C major scale. aerophone one of the four main classes of musical instrument used in the original OSachs-Hombostel system, the others being Oidiophone, Omembranophone, and £>chordophone. In instruments which are aerophones, the air itself is the primary vibrating agent. Subdivisions of aerophones distinguish be­ tween a wide range of types of instrument, but the class as a whole accommodates flutes and instruments of the orchestral brass family.\n\nAeschylus (525-456 BC) Greek dramatist.

She later kills herself when he is seen with former love Ines.\n\nAfrican music generally, traditional music from the area of Africa south of the Sahara desert. The continent of Africa is the home of thousands of different musical styles, but these divide roughly into two regional tradi­ tions: North African music, which is strongly influenced by Islam and Arab music; and the music of sub-Saharan Africa (sometimes called 'Black Africa'), which many people consider to be 'true' African music. The music of western, central, and southern Africa is based on l)rhythm much more than i>melody or l>harmony, and so ^percussion instru­ ments, especially drums, almost always play a prominent part. The huge number of different musical traditions and styles in Africa makes general­ ization almost impossible, although there are certain predominant features that enable a very crude breakdown of the continent into two separate musical cultures: that of the sub-\n\nAfrican music Saharan peoples, and that of northern Africa. Broadly speaking, this division is one be­ tween the truly indigenous music of the South, and the Arab-influenced music of the North. Within these two categories there are naturally many subdivisions, and some Afri­ can music falls outside either classification such as that of Madagascar and parts of East Africa, which has been influenced by the music of South East Asia; and music in Egypt and Ethiopia, influenced by Coptic Christian­ ity. Used loosely, however, the term 'African music' is generally taken to mean the tradi­ tional music of western, central, and southern Africa. m usic in sub-Saharan Africa The main distinguishing feature of practically all tradi­ tional music south of the Sahara is its basis in rhythm, rather than melody or harmony, and its consequent predominance of percussion instruments. Music is almost always a group activity with an emphasis on polyphonic forms resulting from group improvisation on short, simple themes, and Across rhythms formed by simultaneous performance of different rhythmic patterns. These rhythmic [)ostinatos appear complex to the western ear, partly because of their juxtaposition with one another, but also because of their frequent use of irregular subdivisions of the beat - for example, grouping a sequence of twelve beats as 4 + 3 + 5. The melodies in most African music are comparatively simple, being based on a Odiatonic or Opentatonic scale, often only consisting of a few notes, with a static underlying harmony; because of this, timed instruments have tended to remain few and simple, in contrast to the vast array of percussion instruments. vocal music The same basic principles apply as much to vocal music as instrumental music: unlike the monodic folk music of many other cultures, traditional African music is primarily polyphonic and rhythmic. It is also very much a group activity, consequently there is much less evidence of solo song, except in areas with some Islamic influence, such as Nigeria, where the griot intones or sings traditional stories. The commonest form of vocal polyphony is the call-and-response pattern, with a soloist im­ provising a melody between choruses, but there are many other forms of group im­ provisation in as many as eight different voices. Much instrumental music also imi­ tates the tone patterns of speech, and many musical instruments are able to 'talk': the socalled talking drums in particular are often used to communicate with one another, or to\n\n8 address the dancers, either praising them or giving instructions. drums The drum is the most commonly found of all instruments in African music, and is also the most varied. It has been suggested that this ubiquity is due to the drum's use as a means of communication as well as being a musical instrument, and this is certainly the case with the talking drums of Nigeria, but it is more likely merely a consequence of the primarily rhythmic musi­ cal language. African drums take many forms, from the simple hollowed-out tree trunk to the hourglass-shaped, double­ headed talking drums capable of varying pitch, but drummaking is a respected opera­ tion and the maker is usually a highly skilled artisan. The simplest form is the slit drum, made from a hollowed log with a slit running lengthways, either side of which the wood is carved to give two distinct pitches, but the most variety is found in drums with mem­ brane heads. Drumheads are made of a variety of animal skins, including goat, leopard, cowhide, sheepskin, and deer, and these are stretched over a resonant body, the most common forms of which are either cylindrical or bowl-shaped. Drums are made in a multiplicity of shapes and sizes: single­ headed, either open or closed at the other end; or double-headed. Although drums are often played by hand, variously shaped sticks of hardwood are also employed. Talking drums are tuned and capable of producing a number of different notes - the 'language' they speak is not merely rhythmic, but depends also on the relative pitches of the notes. other musical instrum ents It is not only the drums that are used to imitate language; almost all instruments in African music mimic speech patterns to a certain extent. Other percussion instruments include metallophones such as the gong-gong, a double bell, and various other gongs and bells; several versions of the xylophone, such as the balafon, which are made of a series of hard wooden strips arranged on a frame above gourd resonators; and the mbira or sanza (sometimes called the thumb piano or hand piano), made from a resonant board on which there is a set of metal tongues plucked with the thumb and fingers. There are also a number of string instru­ ments, the most common of which is the m usical bow - similar to the hunting bow, but attached to any of a number of resonators such as gourds, or in the case of the Ugandan\n\nground bow, a covered hole in the ground. Lute- and harp-like instruments are also found, particularly in central and western Africa, and include the l>kora, a 21-string instrument from Mali. Less common in subSaharan countries are bowed string instru­ ments, although varieties of fiddle are to be found in countries where there has been Islamic influence. Wind instruments, although widespread, tend to be simple in comparison. There are rudimentary horns and trumpets, and many examples of flute or whistle, and in the north of the region forms of the Arab oboe, but the melodic range of these instruments is limited. music in northern Africa Much of northern Africa has a basically Islamic culture, and the music of these countries is much more 'Arabic' than 'African'. Unlike sub-Saharan African music, it is primarily monophonic and melodic in structure, very often per­ formed by solo performers or soloists with simple accompaniment, and there is much less emphasis on rhythm. As a consequence, it uses comparatively few percussion instru­ ments in a secondary role to the many sophisticated string and wind instruments, which are usually Arabic in origin. influence of African music African music and its rhythms have influenced much of the ethnic music of other continents, including the distinctive rhythms of much Latin Ameri­ can popular music, and have formed the principal component of jazz. The move towards more complex rhythmic structures, and indeed a rhythmic rather than harmonic basis, in western classical music has shown itself in an increased use of percussion instruments - many of them African in origin - and has prompted many composers to study traditional African music. TTiis influ­ ence is most clearly seen in the work of the [>minimalist composers such as Philip [>Glass and Steve l>Reich, but has had an effect on the whole spectrum of western art music. modem African music Due to the colon­ ization of Africa, and particularly as commu­ nication improves worldwide, the dissemination of western culture has in­ creased: the process of influence now works both ways, as music from the west especially pop and rock music - can be heard in all but the remotest parts of Africa. Although this has meant the virtual disap­ pearance of traditional music in some urban areas, it has also given rise to hybrid forms: highlife was one of the first of these, appearing in the early 20th century in West Africa, followed by the now-familiar South-\n\nAgyptische Helena, Die\n\n9 em African kwela in the 1950s, ju ju in Nigeria, and Congolese in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nchoreographer Balanchine.

Originally a part of the Litany, it was first introduced into the Roman Mass towards the end of the 7th century. It is not present in the Ambrosian rite. Its text is tripartite in struc­ ture, and its music in its simplest form consists of three statements of the same melody. More complex plainsong settings exist and in the later Middle Ages numerous additional melodies were written. The Agnus Dei is naturally included in polyphonic settings of the Mass Ordinary, and in later settings of the same series of texts.\n\nagogic a musical accent, affecting pulse and rhythm rather than dynamics, increasing the duration of a particular note.

He is one of the most florid continental composers of the late 15th century, writing in a contrapuntal and decorative style. He served at the court of Galeazzo Maria Sforza, Duke of Milan, dur­ ing the early 1470s, as well as with Lorenzo the Magnificent in Florence. After a brief period at Mantua he returned to the Low Countries, and his name appears in the accounts of Cambrai Cathedral for 1475-76. After a second visit to Italy he entered in 1500 the service of Philip the Handsome, Duke of Austria (Philip I of Spain from 1504), whom he accompanied on jour­ neys to Paris and Spain. During his second visit to Spain Philip died of fever, Agricola apparently dying at the same time.

Nicolo's grandfather Andrea Amati (c. 1511-c. 1580) brought the violin to its classic form. Andrea Amati's earliest known violins were made with only three strings and it may have been he who first fitted the fourth string. He is known to have made small and large (the 'grand' model) violins and violas and to have made cellos, a set of which were commissioned by Charles IX of France after 1560 and some of which survive. The sound of his instruments is mellow and beautiful but less powerful than those of his successors of the Cremonese school, perhaps due to the highly arched belly which was a character­ istic of his violins and violas. Andrea was succeeded by two sons, Anto­ nio (1550-1638) and Girolam o (Hieronymus) (1561-1630), who continued in the same tradition as their father, often signing their instruments jointly as 'the brothers Amati, sons of Andrea'. Nicolo Amati, the son of Girolamo, is the most illustrious member of the family. His violins produced a great intensity and richness of sound, which he achieved by using thicker wood and reducing the elevation of the belly. By this time Cremona violins had won the reputation, which they still hold today, of being the best in the world. The fame of Nicolo and of his pupils, Guameri and Stradivari, has some­ what eclipsed the renown of Andrea and his sons, but they are remembered for their pioneer work in the introduction of a new craft into Italy.\n\nAmadori, Giuseppe (c. 1670-after 1730)\n\nAmbiela, Miguel (1666-1733) Spanish priest\n\nItalian composer.

Whole note, half note, quarter note, (for semibreve, minim, crotchet) are used, as well as concert master for leader, and so on. The most potentially confusing is the word 'tone' meaning British 'pitch': hence Americans tend to use 'tone row' for British 'note row', 'neighbor tone' for 'auxiliary note', 'whole step' and 'half step' for British 'tone' and 'semitone'.

It consists\n\nof three acts and a prologue, and the characters are the stock figures of the comme­ dia dell' arte, but the musical setting of their speech is in the form of madrigals for mixed voices. It has been supposed that the action was produced in dumb-show while the madrigals were sung behind the scenes, but a passage in the text which says that 'the spectacle is to enter by the ear, not by the eye' gives good reason to doubt this.
