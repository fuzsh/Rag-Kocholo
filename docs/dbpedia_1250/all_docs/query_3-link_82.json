The primary reason for this may be that these pieces are strongly linked to language (Hungarian, Romanian and Slovak folk texts), are for the most part untranslatable, and in translation are unsingable – thus even the children’s and women’s choruses often sung in Hungary (mainly for pedagogical purposes) are not popular outside Hungarian-speaking territories; and for sure, the majority of the compositions are extremely difficult, sometimes setting almost insurmountable hurdles before the performers. Yet these compositions, even purely in terms of number, represent an important thread in the composer’s work, and in terms of artistic value are worth no less than the more imposing pieces.\r\nAndrás Wilheim",
