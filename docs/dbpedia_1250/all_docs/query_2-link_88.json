        "text": "On the occasion of WOMEX we prepared an overview of the Hungarian folk and world music market with the help of Hungarian Heritage House (Hagyományok Háza), Fonó and Hangvető.\n\nThe concept of the brochure was based on WOMEX20 organized in Budapest – we considered it important to take advantage of the opportunities to make the market of Hungarian folk and world music as transparent as possible for professionals as well as people that are simply like this genre of music. We asked Balázs Weyer’s help, who, as a member of the WOMEX jury, The 7 Samurai, was able to meet first-hand Hungarian folk and world music productions that are ready for export. We also involved two of Hungary’s leading, well-known and internationally recognized market participants, Fonó and Hungarian Heritage House (Hagyományok Háza). They contributed with their extensive knowledge to the selection of bands.\n\nIn addition to the bands, we gathered a bunch of festivals with folk and world music performers; labels; venues where this genre of music programs can be found and which can provide opportunities for foreign artists to perform; organizations that can be a possible international partner institution.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 situation, WOMEX can’t be orgazined in its original form, so we decided to make the Hungarian World Music Guide available to everyone online. Our goal is to make the colorful and exciting Hungarian folk and world music scene more visible in the world – according to our plans, we will expand the brochure from time to time with additional bands and other market participants, and we hope to have the opportunity to welcome WOMEX again in Budapest in the future.\n\nThe Hungarian World Music Guide is available here for free!\n\nHungarian folk singer Ági Szalóki made her first solo album in 2004. The release of her new, ninth album was supported by the National Cultural Fund of Hungary (NKA). The nearly one-hour long, authentic folk music album consists of nine tracks. They include Hungarian folk songs and folk dance music from Magyarszovát, Szék and Buza (Mezőség region), Magyarbece (Nagyenyed region), Méra (Kalotaszeg region) as well as from Sárköz and Somogy (Hungary), and gipsy folk songs from Zala and Csík from the collection of Károly Bari. The album containing colourful photos and the full lyrics booklet also features Gergely Koncz, László Mester and Barna Mihálydeák, members of a folk music band, as well as other guest artists such as Szilvia Bognár, Ágnes Herczku and Bea Palya in the leaping dance of Sárköz, Ökrös Csaba in the song of Magyarbece, Máté Kalász in the song of Szék and Balázs Szokolay Dongó in the song of Somogy.\n\nCONTACT: management@szalokiagi.hu\n\nThe Hungarian formation Esszencia is made up of seemingly contrasting concepts: folk, classical and jazz music; old and young; new and old, women and men; joyful and sad; traditional and progressive. Yet, these contradictions originating from the diversity of our world naturally coexist in their music in a way which we all desire in our everyday life as well: through respecting and learning from each other. The band cannot be compared to other, traditional folk bands. Its members each are well-known and acknowledged artists and musicians. Playing music together is an expression of their joy to experience unity in their diversity and thus creating an inner harmony that is unique to them. With their openness they are able to create a sound unlike anything else that is honest and, of course, characteristically Hungarian.\n\nCONTACT: info@esszenciaprodukcio.hu / +36 20 454 0407\n\nOver the past fifteen years, Zagyva Banda has become a decisive representative of the Hungarian Táncház movement. The band was brought up with the Táncház Method which is recognized by UNESCO. Zagyva is currently one the most active folk music bands in Hungary. They play authentic folk music from the Carpathian Basin, but they also deal with the culture of other nationalities living in the area. They are especially solicitous for cultivating the traditions of Galgamente, since the members’ family roots stem from here. In 2011, at a competition organized for violinists playing traditional Hungarian folk music, the band’s first violinist, Gellért Boda won the bronze medal. Following that, they published their first CD. In 2012, they started recording a CD-series in which they work upon the music of different ethnographic landscapes. They are currently working on the third disc. In 2015 the members organized a live concert that is available on CD and DVD as well.\n\nCONTACT: zagyvakoncert@gmail.com\n\nA rising star of the folk scene, Junior Prima awardee Sára Tímár is well known among lovers of world and folk music in Hungary. An outstanding singer from the younger generation of the dancehouse movement, she has sung in countless bands and productions. She started her own band in 2009, and has given many concerts at home and abroad ever since. Her solo album came out in 2018 January with the title „What Shall I Call You” (Minek Nevezzelek..), which she presented at a sold out concert at the Liszt Music Academy. Her second album featuring Protestant psalms of gratitude was released the same year. She leads a folk music workshop and dancehouse at the Cultural Centre of Szentendre.\n\nCONTACT: timar.sara@gmail.com // Tímár Sára +36 30 427 7575\n\nThe deeply resonating voice and embellished singing of Júlia Kubinyi has earned her the Young Master of Folk Arts title in 2012, and Junior Prima award the following year. Still, most remember her as a finalist of the folk music talent show „Peacock”(Fölszállott a Páva) from 2012. She grew up with folk music, singing and dancing, performing at festivals at home and abroad, recording with bands since she was a child. She is a permanent member of Dűvő band since 2008, but also contributes to other folk music productions regularly. She is a recurring guest artist at the Hungarian State Folk Ensemble. Her solo debut album titled „I Walk Alone” (Magam Járom) came out in 2015.\n\nCONTACT: kubinyi.julia@gmail.com // Kubinyi Júlia +36 30 739 0601"
