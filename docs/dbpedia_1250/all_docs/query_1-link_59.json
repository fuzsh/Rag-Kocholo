        "text": "This year, prizes (open to young artists aged under 30) went to pianist Péter Kiss, pianist Marcell Szabó, violinist Géza Szajkó, violinist Bálint Kruppa, cellist Dóra Kokas, oboist Zsófia Mohai, trumpet player Tamás Pálfalvi, horn player Bálint Tóth, composer Mátyás Wettl and jazz pianist Krisztián Oláh. Two winners, Géza Szajkó and Bálint Tóth, were unable to collect their prizes in person due to prior concert engagements. During the awards ceremony arranged in the Glass Hall of Müpa Budapest, the young talents were commended by Péter Csiba, chairman-CEO of MVM Hungarian Electricity Private Limited Company, co-founder of the music Junior Prima Prize, and Andrea Vigh, president of the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music and chair of the jury. “This is the eighth time we have presented the prizes and so far we have rewarded 70 musicians and groups. We are convinced that what is of worth within our own country is of similar value at international level. Supporting talent is the best investment because there will certainly be a return on the investment in the future; gifted individuals get science, culture and the economy moving,” Péter Csiba said. Andrea Vigh emphasized the significant moral appreciation represented by the Junior Prima Prize, while the cash that goes with it represents vital support for the first trials. “Once again this year it was extremely difficult to select the 10 laureates from 25 candidates, since everyone was worthy of the prize. We will be able to see the winners again at concerts sponsored by MVM in the future.”\n\nPhoto: MTI / Zsolt Szigetváry\n\nPéter Kiss, pianist, started playing the instrument at the age of nine, graduating as a student of Attila Némethy and Balázs Szokolay from the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music in 2010.
