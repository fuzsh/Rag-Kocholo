In their arrangements, the music of Székelyföld, Moldva, Mezőség, Nyitra and the Somogy regions are brought to light.\n\nKubinyi Júlia – vocals\n\nZimber Ferenc – hammered dulcimer\n\nSzokolay Dongó Balázs – shepherd’s flute, kaval, bagpipe, long flute\n\nJúlia Kubinyi is a folk singer, who has received Hungary’s title of ‘Young Master of Folk Arts’ in 2012; then the Junior Prima award in 2013. Many people know her as one of the finalists in the 2012 Páva Folk Talent Contest which was broadcasted on the Hungarian National Television. Hungarian folk music and folk dance have been part of her everyday life since childhood. She has contributed her vocal talents to numerous recordings, Hungarian folk song competitions, and local and international festivals in Europe and overseas. Since 2008, she is the dedicated singer of Dűvő Ensemble, however she sings regularly as a guest artist with numerous Hungarian folk music formations. Since 2013 she is regularly seen as a solo singer in the Hungarian State Folk Enseble. In 2015 her own vocal works came to the forefront with her first solo recording: „Magam járom – On my way. „\n\nBalázs Dongó Szokolay plays folk music and folk-music-inspired improvisations on bagpipe, shepherd's flute and saxophone. His folk music arrangements and compositions were initially inspired by the elaborate study of the Carpathian Basin’s folklore. He later developed his own improvisational music style that carries the musical culture of old times but sounds modern and contemporary at the same time. Since 1990, Dongó has regularly appeared in the Hungarian music scene as a folk musician. Throughout the years, his hard work and ambition has had a great impact on how he expresses himself through the improvisational forms of historical and folk music. In 1994 he was awarded the title of ”Young Master of the Folk Arts”. In 2005, he was received the Artisjus prize and in 2016, he was awarded the Prima prize. He plays the shepherd's flute, bagpipe, soprano saxophone and a special Hungarian woodwind instrument called ”tárogató”.\n\nThe Junior Prima award winner Ferenc Zimber is currently a professional musician at the Hungarian State Folk Ensemble. At the age of eight, he began his musical education on the hammered dulcimer under the guidance of Tamás Petrovics in Székesfehérvár. Later he continued his musical studies at the Tibor Pikéthy Conservatory of Music in Vác, then at the Liszt Ferenc Music Academy as a pupil of Kálmán Balogh. He is a regular contributor to many authentic Hungarian folk music and world music ensembles. In 2009, along with the members of the Fondor Ensemble, they were awarded the title of “Young Masters of the Folk Arts” and together with the Buda Folk Band, came second place in 2014 on the World Music Charts Europe for their international success with their “Hungarian World Folk Music” album.\n\n1.
