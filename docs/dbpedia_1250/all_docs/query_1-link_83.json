        "text": "Starting Friday August 11th you can enjoy Between the Keys at its new time slot: Friday afternoons at 3:00 PM, with the rebroadcast Saturday evenings at 6:00 PM.\n\nFor this week's program, Between the Keys' creator, producer and host Jed Distler offers his annual all-Scarlatti episode. \"I began doing this during the holiday season, kind of as a counteractive to all of those Bach marathons and endless Handel Messiah performances,\" Jed explains. \"However, after a few years, I had the urge to present a Scarlatti program in the spring, so I broke tradition. But I've continued to present at least one all-Scarlatti episode per year. After all, this is such delightful, captivating, quirky and wide-ranging repertoire.\"\n\nJed's Scarlatti programs always offer a mix of established luminaries and artists who may not be household names, yet whose exemplary interpretations deserve wider recognition. The pianists featured on this week's episode include Sveinung Bjelland, Sheila Simpson, John Browning, Ronald Turini, Alexander Brailowsky, Bal√°zs Szokolay, Goran Filipic, Wolfram Schmitt-Leonardy, Valerie Tryon, Duanduan Hao, Pierre Hantai, Christian Ihle Hadland, Carlo Zecchi and Claire Huangci.\n\nBetween the Keys is an exclusive production of The Classical Network and WWFM.org"
