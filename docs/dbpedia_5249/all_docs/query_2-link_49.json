        "text": "Hi guys! I’m going to be flat honest with you: I just didn’t want to write this post yesterday. That’s really it. I was super unmotivated and that is literally the only reason this post is coming today rather than yesterday.\n\nI have a pretty fun subject to talk about today though! Today, I’ll be talking about the many love interests in the life of the one-and-only lovable Great Dane, Scooby-Doo! These interests can be one-sided or mutual but all the more interesting! Please keep in mind that there are SPOILERS in parts of this post in respect to the endings of episodes/movies/series. If you do not want to have any of this spoiled, I advise you not read this post and start binge-watching direct-to-video Scooby-Doo movies and What’s New, Scooby-Doo? (all on DVD), and Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated on Netflix.\n\nScooby’s been a flirt even in the first few episodes of the franchise itself. In the first minute of “A Decoy for a Dognapper” in Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, Scooby’s already trying to flirt with a pretty white dog being walked down the sidewalk. The dog is stuck up, however, and ignores him. Of course, for those who remember his episode, the dog-walker is jumped a few moments later and the dog is dog-napped!\n\nIn the same episode, Scooby is all cleaned up and looking fancy to pose as a decoy for a show dog that is under the threat of being dog-napped. During the walk, a stray dog spots the handsome Great Dane and Scooby sees her too! Shaggy breaks it up however, telling Scooby to keep walking. This didn’t roll over too well with the stray who proceeded to kick a trash can which spilled all over Shaggy.\n\nMoving on to The Scooby-Doo Show, Scooby had three interests in this series!\n\nThe first one was in “The Chiller Diller Movie Thriller” and this episode’s interest is actually a well-known one. Ever heard of Scooby-Dee? Scooby’s cousin? Yeah, Scooby along with Scooby-Dum both had an interest in their cousin Dee. Now, I imagine it was just innocent flirting but don’t forget they’re related!\n\nThe second interest was in “The Ozark Witch Switch” featuring a dog that belonged to the Hatfield family. This dog was interested in Scooby but Scooby wasn’t interested (especially after learning she had fleas!).\n\nThe third interest was in “A Scary Night With a Snow Beast Fright” in which Scooby was flirting with a female husky who thought he was cute as well. He even got a nose kiss from her to be melted out of a block of ice! How sweet!\n\nDuring the first season of the second Scooby and Scrappy Doo Show called “The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show”, Scooby took interest in a poodle in the episode “Scooby’s Swiss Miss”. This unnamed poodle met Scooby in the Chalet Suisse in the Swiss Alps.\n\nIn the third season of the second Scooby and Scrappy Doo Show called “The Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo Puppy Hour”, Scooby released a genie poodle from a bottle in “Scooby-Doo and Genie-Poo”. Genie-Poo took interest in Scooby for releasing her from the bottle and wished to bring Scooby back with her to her genie world.\n\nNow that we’re out of the 1900s, we’re going to be talking about some dogs that will probably be more familiar to you. The first up is probably the most well-known among all of Scooby’s love interests and that dog would be the golden retriever Amber from Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders (2000).\n\nAmber didn’t really like Scooby all that much in the beginning of the movie but Scooby grew on her and the two developed quite the affection for one another. Sadly the relationship could not be kept between the two because of Amber turning out to be an alien who had to return home with Crystal. (Note that the image below is from probably the most emotional animated scene of the entire Scooby-Doo franchise).\n\nScooby was heartbroken after Amber’s departure from Earth but he was able to move on and eventually found another interest in Scooby-Doo and the Monster of Mexico. He and the gang were on vacation in Mexico when he met Chiquita, a little Chihuahua who also took interest in Scooby. The two were flirting from the beginning of the movie and did not make any attempts to hide their affection for one another.\n\nIn season 3 of What’s New, Scooby-Doo?, we meet not necessarily a love interest but former girlfriend of Scooby’s. The gang returns to their hometown Coolsville in “A Scooby-Doo Valentine” when Shaggy and Scooby run into their ex’s, Rachel and Roxanne. Roxanne is a beautiful greyhound who still holds a grudge on Scooby after they broke up when Mystery Inc. left Coolsville. The two do not make up as Roxanne has moved on to dating a boxer.\n\nThe next interest is pretty well-known as well since she was introduced in Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated and remained a primary character for a majority of season 2. In “The Hodag of Horror”, we meet Nova, a pretty dog who belongs to Fred’s biological parents, Brad Chiles and Judy Reeves. After Chiles and Reeves betray Mystery Inc. in an attempt to steal the Planispheric Disk pieces they possess, Mystery Inc. steals Nova and keep her with Fred living secretly in the Blake mansion. Nova would end up being hurt and put in a coma in “The Horrible Herd” when Scooby loses grip of her hanging out of a helicopter. Nova falls into a stampede of mutant monsters and is found unconscious. It would turn out later, however, that Nova is also an alien called an Anunnaki. Nova’s now speaking-self is present in Scooby’s dreams and guides him and Mystery Inc. to uncovering and defeating the evil entity beneath Crystal Cove.\n\nLastly we have Shauna who appears in the DVD-exclusive episode “Scooby-Doo! and the Beach Beastie” which was released in May 2015. Scooby takes an interest in Shauna and Shauna returns the affection. The two flirted throughout the episode.\n\nWell those are all the love interests of Scooby that I could find!
