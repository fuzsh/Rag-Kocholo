        "text": "01 of 11\n\nMatthew Lillard (Shaggy Rogers)\n\nIn both Scooby-Doo and Monsters Unleashed, Matthew Lillard dons the signature goatee and green V-neck tee of Shaggy Rogers, who joins forces with his canine confidante to bring the mystery-solving gang back together at the beginning of the first film. However, the actor has expressed mixed feelings about what the franchise represented during a certain period of his career.\n\n\"I had this moment where I had done big movies, and I had been the lead in Scooby-Doo. I got paid a lot of money, it was a huge success, and I was like, ‘Oh I’m set. I’m going to now sort of control my own destiny. I’m a legit Hollywood sort of success,’” he told The Ringer in July 2017. “Which was actually the farthest thing from the truth, because I had really kind of pigeonholed myself to be this kind of [hack], on a movie that nobody respected and nobody really liked, and I was kind of like, people sort of thought of me as a hack at that time. At least I felt that way.”\n\nBefore Scooby-Doo, the Michigan-born actor had his first notable film credit in John Waters’ Serial Mom (1994). From the mid-'90s to the early-2000s, he went on to star in a variety of classic teen films like Scream (1996), SLC Punk (1998), She’s All That (1999), and Thirteen Ghosts (2001).\n\nAfter playing the goofy, over-the-top Shaggy in the live-action films, Lillard continued to voice the character in various animated projects, including Be Cool, Scooby-Doo, Scooby-Doo and Guess Who, and more. He also has reinvented himself as an actor with dramatic turns in Alexander Payne’s The Descendants (2011) and in episodes of Twin Peaks: The Return and Good Girls. Additionally, he played the main antagonist William Afton in the 2023 film adaptation of Five Nights at Freddy’s, a role he will reprise in the forthcoming sequel.\n\nSince 2000, Lillard has been married to realtor Heather Helm, with whom he shares three children: daughter Addison and sons Liam and Jackson.\n\n02 of 11\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar (Daphne Blake)\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar struts in the purple platform boots of the fashionable and upbeat Daphne Blake in both live-action Scooby-Doo flicks.\n\nIn February 2023, Gellar told Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live that the cast initially filmed a \"less-than-family-friendly\" version of the original Scooby-Doo. \"There was an actual kiss between Daphne and Velma that got cut. I feel like the world wants to see it. I don't know where it is,\" she said. \"There was a great line too that I'll never forget. We were having a fight, Daphne and Fred, and then I yell at him, 'And that ascot makes you look gay!' And I slam the door and they cut that, too.\"\n\nThe actress has been working since she was four years old, making her onscreen debut in the 1983 television film An Invasion of Privacy. She appeared on All My Children before landing the title role on the iconic WB series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. During this time, Gellar became somewhat of a scream queen with parts like the ill-fated Helen in I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) and the similarly doomed Cece in Scream 2 (1997), then starred in the 1999 cult classic Cruel Intentions.\n\nAfter Scooby-Doo, she went on to other projects like The Grudge (2004), its 2006 sequel The Return (2005), and Suburban Girl (2007). After taking a nearly decade-long break from film — during which time she reprised her Cruel Intentions character for an unaired television spinoff — Gellar appeared in the movies Clerks III (2022) and Do Revenge (2022). She also starred on Paramount+'s short-lived supernatural series Wolf Pack in 2023.\n\nAfter meeting on the set of I Know What You Did Last Summer, Gellar began dating Scooby-Doo costar Freddie Prinze Jr. in 2000. They married two years later and have two children, a daughter Charlotte and a son Rocky.\n\n03 of 11\n\nFreddie Prinze Jr. (Fred Jones)\n\nFreddie Prinze Jr. takes on the role of the blond ascot-wearing leader of the Mystery Inc. gang in both Scooby-Doo movies. However, later he openly expressed his regret for filming them.\n\n“There was too much bait-and-switch on the first one. The studio was not honest with me in any way, shape or form. They were not straightforward,” Prinze Jr. told TooFab in March 2023. \"I've been on two jobs where I've had regret [after] doing it, and Scooby was one of them.\"\n\n\"I didn't fully appreciate Scooby until it was seen and children came up to me, like, 'Oh my gosh,'\" he continued. \"All of a sudden I was like, 'Hey, man, we did good.' We did good, there's legit millions of people [who] love this movie. It wasn't the movie I wanted to make, but I appreciate that and it made me change my outlook on it.\"\n\nBefore Scooby–Doo, Prinze Jr. — the only child of stand-up comedian and actor Freddie Prinze — got his start as a teen heartthrob in films like The House of Yes (1997) and I Know What You Did Last Summer and its 1998 sequel. He also appeared opposite his Scooby-Doo costar Matthew Lillard in She’s All That and Wing Commander (1999).\n\nSince playing Fred Jones, Prinze Jr. headlined his own short-lived sitcom on ABC, Freddie; popped up in episodes of Boston Legal, 24, Bones, and Punky Brewster; and lent his voice to Kanan Jarrus on Star Wars: Rebels, as well as in Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker (2019). Additionally, he had a cameo alongside Sarah Michelle Gellar in Clerks III and starred in the Netflix holiday rom-com Christmas With You (2022).\n\nPrinze Jr. shares two children with Gellar, with whom he's been married since 2002.\n\n04 of 11\n\nLinda Cardellini (Velma Dinkley)\n\nJinkies! Linda Cardellini breathes life into the iconic Velma, the brains behind Mystery Inc. who's forever losing her glasses.\n\n\"Velma has been around since 1969; I just went trick or treating with my daughter and there were a lot of Velmas out there,\" Cardellini reflected on the character's legacy to EW in November 2022. \"So I love that she still has this place in culture that is sort of always active for decades.\"\n\nPrior to sporting Velma's signature bob haircut, the actress had her start as Lindsay Weir alongside a slew of now-famous faces on Freaks and Geeks. She then followed with the perm-wearing Chutney in Legally Blonde (2001).\n\nAfter Scooby-Doo, Cardellini landed the regular role of Samantha Taggart on ER; appeared in episodes of New Girl, Mad Men, and Bloodline; did voice work on Regular Show and Gravity Falls; and earned film credits for Brokeback Mountain (2004), Daddy's Home (2015) and its 2017 sequel, A Simple Favor (2018), and Green Book (2018).

However, Atkinson is most recognized for his titular role on Mr. Bean, a character he played across various TV and movie projects since 1990.\n\nPost–Scooby-Doo, he's continued to play Mr. Bean on Mr. Bean: The Animated Series and Handy Bean — as well as in several films — and starred in the Johnny English film franchise and on Netflix's Man vs. Bee. In 2023, he worked opposite Timothée Chalamet in Wonka.\n\nAtkinson has two children with his ex-wife, makeup artist Sunetra Sastry.

But it comes really naturally, and that’s half the trick, keeping it natural.... It’s like — 'hummmeeemmph!' — pretty much do that and I’m in,\" Fanning told Today in March 2004. \"Basically, there are three elements to Scooby: He’s happy, he’s hungry, or he’s scared. Pretty much, that warmup just covers the whole gamut of his emotions very quickly.\"\n\nBefore lending his voice to the iconic character, the Australian actor and stuntman performed for 14 years in the Police Academy Stunt Show at Warner Bros. Movie World in Queensland before managing the show for many years. The same year he voiced Scooby-Doo for the live-action film, he did stunts for the films The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course and Ghost Ship.\n\nFollowing Scooby-Doo, Fanning's latest on-screen credits include a 2009 episode of Sea Patrol and a 2016 episode of Wanted.

Is there anything you can find me?’ Two days later, my manager and agent called and they said, ‘Well, we have an offer for you to do Scooby-Doo 2,’” he told Tulsa World (his hometown newspaper) in August 2023. “I was on the phone in my son’s room, and I said, somewhat derisively, 'Scooby-Doo 2?' And then Henry looked up at me, and he said ‘You can be in Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?' And I said ‘All right, I’m going to do this.’”\n\nPrior to his appearance in the second live-action Scooby-Doo film, Nelson made his movie debut in This Is My Life (1990) and went on to feature in films such as Heavyweights (1995), Donnie Brasco (1997), The Thin Red Line (1998), O Brother, Where Art Thou (2000), and Holes (2003).\n\nFollowing his portrayal of Dr. Jacobo, the Juilliard-trained actor booked memorable roles, including Samuel Sterns in The Incredible Hulk (2008); Dr. Allen in Fantastic Four (2015); and the titular character in the Coen brothers' The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018).
