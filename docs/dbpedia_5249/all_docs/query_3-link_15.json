        "text": "Question and exclamation marks are used to indicate the mood of sentence. In other words, they indicate whether the sentence is in interrogative mood, exclamatory mood, or imperative mood.\n\nAn exclamation mark (also known as exclamation point) is used in exclamatory sentences. The exclamation mark is (!). Just like the other punctuations it can be used on different occasions:\n\nRemember, an exclamation mark is also used at the end of an imperative sentence or when there is a clause or word which indicates sudden interjections. Check out these examples:\n\nWhen the exclamation mark is applied to words inside the parenthesis, it is placed inside the parentheses. But when it is applied to the whole sentence, it is used outside the parentheses. Here are the examples:\n\nYou can also put an exclamation mark in parenthesis to emphasize a single word in a sentence or to show that a particular part of the sentence is surprising. Do not insert a space between the word and the parenthesis. For example:\n\nHe came closer to me(!) raised his hand angrily(!!) and then killed the cockroach above my head(!!!)\n\nIf the exclamation mark is applied to the words inside the quotation, then it is used inside the quotation marks, but if it is applied to the whole sentence, then it is used after the quotation mark. For example:\n\nSometimes a declarative sentence is followed by an exclamation mark and although it is not in the exclamatory mood, it has to be read with emphasis on particular words to indicate the sense of anger, sadness, unhappiness, etc. in the sentence.\n\nWhen interjections are used alone, they are followed by an exclamation mark. But when they are followed by a clause, they are followed by a comma, not an exclamation mark. For example:\n\n'Exclamation questions' are interrogative sentences that are not followed by a question mark; instead, they are followed by an exclamation mark, so they express the meaning and emotions of an exclamatory sentence instead of asking for an answer. For example:\n\nUsually, the interrogative words are followed by an auxiliary verb to make an interrogative sentence, but what and how sometimes use anastrophe (which means the order of words is inverted deliberately) to make a sentence in exclamatory mood. The important point is to use an exclamation mark at the end of the sentence. Here are the examples:\n\nThe question mark is used to indicate that the sentence is an interrogative one and demands an answer. Let us compare these two examples:\n\nIn the first example, the speaker is asking whether the person they are talking to is Jimmy or not. However, in the second example, the person is calling Jimmy.\n\nYou have to use a question mark wherever you need an answer, even when there are multiple questions to be answered. Here are the examples:\n\nDo not use a question mark before or after a comma or a period, unless there is an abbreviation that has a period in the end or the question is part of a title. For example:\n\nâHow will I know?â, by Whitney Houston is one of my favorite songs.\n\nAs mentioned before, question marks are used whenever an answer is required. So, you should not use a question mark with indirect question. Use a period instead. For example:"
