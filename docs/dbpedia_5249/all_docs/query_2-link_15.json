That lovable, easily frightened Great Dane, Scooby-Doo, makes his big-screen debut in this live-action/animated feature film. Scooby accompanies the Mystery, Inc. crime-solving sleuths--Shaggy (Matthew Lillard), Fred (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Velma (Linda Cardellini)--as they investigate a series of paranormal incidents at Spooky Island, a spring-break hot spot owned by Emile Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson). Before the supernatural secrets scare away the college crowd, the gang must crack the case, save themselves and, possibly, the world! Zoinks!",

        "text": "The pitch-perfect casting of the members of Mystery Inc. is what makes Scooby-Doo compulsively rewatchable. The plot is serviceable, and most adults will be able to unmask the villain long before the Mystery Inc. team does, but that doesnâ€™t matter.\n\nMay 22, 2024\n\nIf you can accept a pixellated pooch, you'll be rewarded with an entertaining, un-taxing romp that will delight fans and enthrall youngsters.\n\nJune 27, 2022\n\nIt's a compromised vision, to be sure, but this colorful and campy pseudo-parody of the classic Scooby-Doo cartoons still has plenty of fun in store for younger (and some older) audiences.\n\nJune 14, 2022\n\nWhile the loss of Gunn's risque original treatment is lamentable (and evident), what remains is fun, silly and reverent. Cardellini and Lillard fare best with material that is simultaneously nostalgic, childish and appropriately cartoony.\n\nJune 9, 2022\n\nSo, for one of the best rides this summer, grab your Scooby Snacks and sit back and watch 87 minutes of some of the best fun you've had since being glued to the television Saturday mornings as a kid.\n\nNovember 15, 2019\n\nEven its look is awfully cheesy and clunky, the SFX notwithstanding. Scooby Doo makes Stuart Little seem a Citizen Kane in comparison.\n\nJanuary 3, 2019\n\nEveryone got into the spirit of the movie (no pun intended) and made a cute film.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nWhat really makes this movie special is Matthew Lillard's inspired performance as Shaggy. It's not only a dead-on impersonation of the cartoon character, but it also comes with a certain kind of unique joy and a genuine soul.\n\nJune 22, 2017"
