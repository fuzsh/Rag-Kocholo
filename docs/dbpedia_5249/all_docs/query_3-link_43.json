        "text": "But while Alan Moore, Don Simpson, and Co. were issuing their dire warning about the panoply of comics being superseded by superheroes, some new faces in the independent comics world were in ascent.\n\nAlthough I was a young fan during the final throes of the phenomenon in the early nineties, I’m honestly surprised to still be seeing the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles around thirty years later. I’m sure Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird are probably surprised in their own way that something they created on a lark forty years ago is still going. It just seems so unlikely—not just that a premise that loose and defiantly nonsensical (and very specifically semi-parodying the comics industry in the early eighties) could become as popular as it did, but that it could survive past its initial peak and reinvent itself multiple times, successfully connecting with new audiences and creating multiple generations with their own version of the series. Very few pieces of pop culture have a sustained existence across multiple decades, and even fewer of them do so without ultimately eroding into a niche among niches (as many of the Wold Newton Family characters have)—and yet, somehow, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are among them. If you really detach yourself from the blinkered fan sphere and look at it, it truly boggles the mind.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nI haven’t had cable for a decade, but around this time of year I still like to imagine that somewhere on the hundreds of channels that make up the eternal background radiation, the original Rankin/Bass Christmas specials are still being aired, still staples of television over fifty to sixty years later (What, do these channels think they have anything more seasonally appropriate to show than Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman and the rest? Those absolute goons.) I find comfort in their continued ubiquity, and I still enjoy their distinctive, tactile aesthetics and stories that become stranger the older you get and the more you think about them. They are unique, and also uniquely tied to the holiday season, which makes them feel even more special.\n\nWe are only a few months removed from the death of R/B co-founder (and writer of the theme song for The Last Dinosaur) Jules Bass, and also frequent R/B character designer and MAD magazine contributor Paul Coker Jr., so it feels appropriate to write about one of lesser-known projects—but in particular, a lesser-known project that also happens to be a bizarre culmination of their decade+ run of holiday specials. So yes, if you couldn’t tell from the title, this is a 1979 feature-length special (which also got a theatrical run) that brings together Rankin/Bass’ two most famous Christmas characters (with Frosty being animated in stop motion for the first time), and pretty much all of the original crew is here—not just their voice actors, but also writer Romeo Muller (who wrote most of the original specials) and Johnny Marks, who, you know, wrote the song “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” in the forties. But, BUT, it’s not just those either—you also get the return of the Mickster, Mickey Rooney, reprising the role of Santa Claus from R/B’s Santa Claus Is Comin’ To Town and The Year Without a Santa Claus, so that’s another classic thrown into this blender. What kind of magical adventure could all these Yuletide characters get into in one movie? Would you believe that it’s one that feels ill-fitting to all of them, and doesn’t even take place on Christmas (although it originally aired during the holiday season?) This is a much stranger proposal than you might have thought.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nBut what is The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones, really (aside from a Simpsons joke)? It originally aired in November 1987 as part of the Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10 series of syndicated television films made in the waning years of Hanna-Barbera. This was a company that had become fairly diminished from their days of being the primary provider of animated television content, and in the late eighties and early nineties they really seemed to be trying to keep their old characters relevant. Around the time of these movies (all starring established H-B characters), there were new batches of Yogi Bear, Jonny Quest, and The Jetsons cartoons that were often mixed in with reruns of the originals, with the saddest part being that in terms of animation, it might be hard to tell the new and old stuff apart (you might be surprised to learn that The Jetsons was originally cancelled after one season, and so the vast majority of show’s run was made over two decades after it premiered.) As you could probably guess, both the new series and most of the Superstars 10 movies failed in their quest for relevancy and have largely been forgotten, with the exception of Scooby-Doo entries like Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School, which were re-aired more frequently and have even been referenced in recent cartoons…and this one, if only because of the aforementioned Simpsons joke.\n\nAside from all the other obvious similarities between the two series (i.e. they are basically the exact same show), The Flintstones and The Jetsons are similar in that they are both collections of all-time great character and world designs in desperate search of any entertaining use for them. The past/future reconfiguration of mundane urban life (in the sixties, I might add, and neither series ever really attempted to update since then) presented by these shows is very appealing, creating these distinct environments full of fun concepts (helped along by H-B’s stable of talented voice actors), which are mostly used as a vehicle for standard sitcom plots, except with dinosaurs and robots adding jokes on the side. I mean, that was always the point, wasn’t it? To prove that an animated show could be enjoyed by the average adult, they made shows that closely copied the kinds of things the average adult watched in the early sixties, no more, no less. Although The Flintstones was vastly more successful than The Jetsons was at the time (which is why it kept getting new shows from 1960s onward), they both managed to coast their way through the intervening decades of TV almost entirely on their original conceptual novelty, which was the part that the producers clearly put the most thought into anyway. And unlike Hanna-Barbera’s legion of Saturday morning cartoon characters, the characters of these shows rarely got thrown into the crossover crowd (and the exceptions, such as Fred and Barney’s appearance in that Yogi Bear Christmas special I wrote about, are treated as special occasions), so seeing them interact with fellow H-B creations still had some novelty by 1987 (whereas nowadays, both of them have been in direct-to-DVD movies with WWE wrestlers—and I’m still waiting to see if Fred and/or Barney make their way into that MultiVersus game.) Which is good, because novelty is all this TV Film Event has going for it.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nOne curious phenomenon from yesterday’s internet were articles listing failed television pilots that aired once and then vanished, oftentimes for very obvious reasons. While there were some failed pilots that looked like missed opportunities in hindsight and were passed around like glorious contraband by online fans (the high concept comedies Heat Vision and Jack and Lookwell! come to mind), most of them were self-evidently bad ideas that somehow convinced enough people to provide the money to realize their untenable visions. It wouldn’t be the entertainment industry if there weren’t a subsection of people with wild ambitions and no sense whatsoever.\n\nOne of the more intriguing-in-its-ludicrousness pilots that regularly featured in those proto-listicles was the 1992 NBC pilot/TV movie Steel Justice, which on paper feels like a parody of a high concept TV show pitch: what if a cop fought crime with Robosaurus? You know Robosaurus, don’t you? The giant mechanical monstrosity that has been making appearances at monster truck shows for over three decades? Crunches cars and breathes fire? Parodied on The Simpsons as Truckasaurus? Yes, I imagine some Hollywood executive went to a local motocross event, saw Robosaurus do its thing (or, I guess more accurately, it’s two things) and thought “that’s a TV show!” By that, of course, they meant that they could take the template of some other shows and then insert Robosaurus into it, which is really what most high concept pitches end up being—cop shows were a big thing then, and if Cop Rock showed us anything, it’s that viewers wanted their law & order dramas to be leavened a bit with completely incongruous elements. But Steel Justice is more than just a show where a police officer fights crime with a forty-foot robot dinosaur that exists solely to crush cars, the most efficient way of fighting crime—it’s also some near-future nonsense with a fantasy twist with sets that shout “this was shot entirely at Universal Studios and isn’t even trying to hide it.” Other than that, it is just a show where a police officer fights crime with a forty-foot robot dinosaur. A sure-miss scenario if there ever was one!\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe last collaboration between Rankin-Bass and Tsuburaya Productions we saw was the TV movie The Bermuda Depths, which I remember being a little odd. After watching The Last Dinosaur, the TV movie they made prior to it (which had an extended cut released theatrically in Japan), I’m starting to wonder if it might have been even odder than I remember, because this one is pure nonsense. You’d think a rather straightforward modern riff on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Lost World would not produce as wacky results as a ghost story that also involves a giant turtle, but you’d be surprisingly wrong! Somehow, this has every cliché in the book—a hidden land not so much populated by dinosaurs but hosting a small party of them, primitive humans, and a hunter out to bag the biggest game of them all—but you never really notice because you’re constantly questioning what is happening on screen. It’s funny that whoever wrote the Wikipedia entry for this spends so much of snidely putting down the special effects, when there’s so much other stuff to be boggled by.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThis and the next entry in the New Creature Canon have been chosen for a specific personal reason: I actually wrote about them on another website six years ago (almost to the day), but looking back, I really don’t like the approach I took. I was still all about the Internet smart-assery back then, trying way too hard to be funny, and it’s just not particularly interesting to read now—so, I want to give some of that subject matter its proper due. Not that these things are necessarily lost gems unworthy of some light mockery—they are, after all, film spin-offs of popular Japanese media franchises—but there could still be some material worth digging into.\n\nCase in point: Digital Monster X-Evolution (yes, that means it’s Digimon, but I’ll refer to it by its original Japanese title for clarity), a TV movie that aired in Japan in 2005 as part of a new merchandising push for the series by Bandai (the version I watched even included spots trumpeting the sponsorship and toy/video game tie-ins), which sounds especially cynical and only makes the actual product even stranger in context. Completely unrelated to the previous Digimon anime series, it’s the only entry that foregoes any human characters, and instead is entirely about the Digimon themselves and their lives within their computer data world—this is the rare monster story that is all monsters, all the time. It’s also the only Digimon TV/movie production that is animated in CG—which is interesting considering that it’s always had that computer connection—provided by Imagi Studios, the Hong Kong-based company that would later go on to make feature films based on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Astro Boy, and then not make a feature film based on going bankrupt because they were too busy going bankrupt. A TV-budget CG film seems like an iffy proposition, and you wouldn’t be wrong to think so, what with the lifeless-looking backgrounds (with the odd splashes of 0s and 1s floating around) and scenes with lower frame rates. But X-Evolution is so peculiar in general that it’s really easy to overlook that.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWe’ve had a bit of a nautical theme for the last few entries of New Creature Canon, and I’d call it a maritime monster month, but it actually took place over two months, so that would be a lie. Next up is October, and let’s say that I already have plans for then that will be…seasonally appropriate. Yes, that is an accurate, straight-to-the-point description of it.\n\nThe Bermuda Depths represents the third of three collaborations between Rankin/Bass and Tsuburaya Productions—yes, the people behind Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the creators of Ultraman, together at last! R/B frequently employed the talents of Japanese studios to make their television specials, so it’s not that much of a surprise—what was surprising was just how prominent Rankin and Bass’ names were in the opening credits, even compared to their other productions. Rankin is credited as co-writer, and Bass penned the lyrics for this thing’s very on-the-nose theme song. It almost feels like all those beloved holiday specials were what they made to pay the bills, but this represents what they really wanted to make.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe one thing that I find invariably fascinating whenever I take in the work of Osamu “God of Manga” Tezuka (one of the most respected and influential cartoonists of all time, if you didn’t know) is that it always comes off as his work, no matter what the subject matter is. He was inspired by the style of Disney and other American cartoons, adapted it to his own ends (he literally wrote the book on making comics), and in his five-decade-long career jumped from genre to genre (inventing a few along the way) and audience to audience (making kids comics and comics for adults, back and forth)—but his creations still maintained all the very cartoony elements that he utilized in, say, Astro Boy in the fifties and sixties. Look at most of his “serious” comics or animation projects (which includes philosophical Sci-Fi and fantasy, historical fiction, psychological thrillers, and erotica), you’ll still find highly exaggerated or cute characters in major recurring roles, or comical sequences right out of a Twenties Mickey Mouse short—it completely boggles the tone, but at the same time I have to admire the commitment. Tezuka wants to make stories with very important or personal themes (and he succeeds at just as much as he fails, given his voluminous output), but he never wants them to not be cartoons at their heart.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nBefore we get to the actual post (the 200th on this site): in memory of the late B-movie master Larry Cohen, I’d like to direct you to my post about his monster classic Q—The Winged Serpent from a few years ago.\n\nSometimes, a great title is all you need to have any sort of longevity—the name “Killdozer” is so blunt and over-the-top that it has somehow maintained some kind of cultural cache for over seventy years. There’s a band named after it, and to make doing video and image searches for it more difficult, there was even a real killdozer that went on a rampage in 2004. “Killdozer” probably got itself ingrained in the culture purely by being a fun thing to say, and so irregardless of its origins it kept being repeated, to the point where I knew the title without ever knowing where it came from.\n\nWhere it came from, though, is itself fairly interesting. The original “Killdozer!” novella was written by preeminent science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon (the guy who originally said that “ninety percent of everything is garbage” and was the inspiration, at least in name, for Kurt Vonnegut’s Kilgore Trout) in 1944, one of the many influential stories he wrote over his six decade career (another important monster story by him was “It” in 1940, which introduced the world to the concept of a monster made of decaying vegetable matter). It’s a quintessentially pulp concept, but also brought to us by one of the SF genre’s most important innovators, so I knew there had to be something more to it than just a story of a possessed bulldozer. I mean, a story about a possessed bulldozer (with a title that uses an exclamation point for emphasis) probably would have been embraced by the SF-reading kids of the forties regardless, but still.\n\nContinue reading →"
