I have wished if that person whose responsible for doing this for Cartoonito in EMEA was laid off by Discovery.\n\nIt's great that CN Arabic and Boomerang MENA were using them wisely, American and British voices for \"O, O, O, Cartoonito\".\n\nUnfortunately, it was supposed that they have used the program logo (with exclamation for new episodes) in the promo, or pasting Cartoonito logo just like in 2011-2013/2014 era, but they made the mascots big instead.\n\nI expected them to put effort in these bumpers. I wasn't getting too hyped though because knowing of the team, mut such big block was expected to get creative.\n\nAlso those of you complaining how long Cartoonito is, keep in mind we are either in work or school at 8a-2p (somewhere like Baltics and Romania until 3p). So at the end 6 hours a day for the time most of us aren't even home, I'm fine with it. Cartoonito used to last 12 hours in 2013.\n\nAt the end, a win-win for everyone.\n\nI expected them to put effort in these bumpers.

October\n\nSo if I want, I can still stay on Cartoonito all day for one month\n\n(don't mind me)\n\nSorry for being that late, the video editing took me some hard time..\n\nI can't say how surprised I am how much effort they managed to do for this \"unnew\" block.\n\nAnd here is a short version with Romanian opt-out, where even there they already made Cartoonito-branded ad break bumpers!\n\nIs it just me or is the first video's audio kinda unsynced in the middle of the video?\n\nI got the Tooncast October schedule and for the first time there will be no Halloween specials or the traditional Scooby-Doo month, the schedules remain intact.\n\nAnd answering a @Francisque late the reason that Boomerang was replaced by Cartoonito and not\n\nTooncast and because the channel is only one feed for Latin America with 3 audio tracks unlike Boomerang which had 4 feeds and could send local advertisements according to the country\n\nFixed video here\n\nYeah, don't ask me, Idk what happened either that caused half of the video to \"go nuts\"..\n\nApparently, Boomerang logo does not appear when the Cartoonito block starts. But in my country (Turkey) Boomerang Logo is also available. And the short information before the program starts is available on Cartoon Network.

It's written under the Boomerang logo.\n\nI was talking about CEE not using exclamation mark (it’s exclamation mark, not point; which is another word for full stop, dot, or period) and the show promo, or Cartoonito logo in it, unlike 2011-2013/14 era, instead of making mascots huge.\n\nAlso, there is nothing about Turkey there in my quote.\n\nIs it bad to say that I'm not a fan of the CEE Cartoonito block? All of its programming previously aired on Boomerang, so if you removed the Cartoonito branding it'd just look like a regular Boomerang CEE schedule.\n\nIf Cartoonito had replaced Boomerang in some EMEA markets, and have added Cartoonito content from 2011-2013, and also The Happos Family & Oddbods in the schedule during its trial transmission, rather than spamming it’s content in the past years, it’s going to be fine.\n\nAt that time, we would have been seen the full 1 minute promo, rather than the 30 seconds British one."
