        "text": "Perhaps West Philadelphia native Peter Boyle has already eased into semi-retirement, or maybe he’s just tired from counting all that ­Everybody Loves Raymond money. Whatever the reason, on the eve of the show’s final episode on May 16th, the 71-year-old didn’t sound quite as animated as he’s been throughout his long career. At times, Boyle cheerfully reflected on topics close to his heart (John Lennon, Ray Romano, Dirty Frank’s); others (a certain Gene Hackman vehicle) invoked his irritable Raymond character. But he was the monster in Young Frankenstein, and thus can do no wrong in the eyes of Exit Interview."
