        "text": "Writer-director Gregg Araki is known for a string of hip, teen-to-twentysomething pansexual romps, and for one flourish of brilliance: his 2005 film Mysterious Skin, the story of how two boys come to terms with the suppressed memory of having been abused by a paedophile. With Kaboom, Araki switches back easily into his signature style, which could be described as comedy, albeit in the affectless, Bret Easton Ellis mode, and shot through with strains of Lynchian rapture and trauma.\n\nThe film is dominated by adoring closeups of its leading player, Thomas Dekker, playing Smith, a young and sexually adventurous guy in his first year at college who, incidentally, scorns labels such as \"bisexual\". As we gaze upon Smith's lovely face, we are perhaps invited to be mad about the boy – like the director himself, perhaps.\n\nSmith's gay best friend Stella (Haley Bennett) is a laconic, hypercynical and not especially likable fellow student who is now having sex with sinister black-magic enthusiast Lorelei, played by Roxane Mesquida. Smith himself finds himself yearning to get laid by his ultra-straight roommate, a buff, blond surfer with the outrageous name of Thor, played by 90210 cast member Chris Zylka. The name is, as Thor helpfully explains, spelt like the super-hero. \"What's having sex with a guy like?\" asks Thor, in one woozy scene. \"It's raw,\" replies Smith, \"you know about all the plumbing. Things don't come as a surprise, the way they do with a girl.\" People are always waking bolt upright from dreams, to be greeted by a reality which doesn't seem very different from the fantasy.\n\nSmith is getting sex from a gay guy he meets on the beach, and from a British girl, nicely played by Juno Temple, who is pedantically named London. It is not clear if this is a nickname she has assumed to underline her Britishness, or if Araki simply assumes that our citizens are naturally named after our cities.\n\nAll this sex that everyone's having is not darkened and complicated by the agonies of infidelity or commitment issues, as it might be in another type of drama, but by bizarre supernatural predations and Smith's fears that strange pig-masked men are trying to kidnap him. He also fears that all this has something to do with a mysterious, auburn-haired girl who vanished from the student body some months before.\n\nDavid Lynch is clearly an influence: and yet somehow, with its creepy people in masks, its unsolved mysteries and the preponderance of vans, Kaboom also resembles nothing so much as an episode of Scooby Doo without the dog, and with an awful lot of penetrative sex.\n\nIt has an insistent silliness, an inconsequential quality and a likable, playful humour. The movie canters cheerfully along, and you have to take some time to acclimatise to its deadpan, jokey quality. Weird things happen. Scary things happen. And above all, sexy things happen: sex happens, a lot. But Araki's cast maintain the same cool, unfazed look when they have sex as when they are driving a van or shooting a gun out of the passenger-side window at someone who is trying to kill them. The title looks as if it should have an exclamation mark: its absence correctly conveys the movie's distinctive lack of recognisable human impact.\n\nThe films of Araki, like those of Larry Clark, are a reminder that despite the supposed sexiness and sexualisation of everything that surrounds us, the actual depiction of the sex act is still a relative rarity. Just as with this film, or with Michael Winterbottom's once-controversially explicit 9 Songs, there might be some critics who will declare themselves \"bored\" by the sex. These dismissals are disingenuous; like it or not, sex on screen is never entirely boring. My reservation about Kaboom is that the sex wasn't nearly explicit enough. Araki uses the old-school porn technique of closeups on people's faces; this may simply be a way to get it past the censor, but it has an oddly goofy, lovestruck effect, a sense that gazing into the faces of young, attractive people is its own reward.\n\nThere is something surprisingly inoffensive in a film which is genially aware of its own shallowness and makes a joke of it in the absurdly melodramatic final moments. Despite the resemblance, Kaboom does not resonate in the mind like something by David Lynch, and is not intended to. Knowing that Araki is capable of the more powerful Mysterious Skin, it is tempting to wonder if he intends the film to be a deceptively comic, metaphorical rendering of the same serious themes. But I doubt it. It's a quirky, freaky comedy, designed to be shown at cult \"midnight movie\" slots. Araki has a light touch; not all directors have."
