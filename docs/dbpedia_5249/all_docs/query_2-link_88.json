        "text": "I'm expecting red shirt Shaggy to be the one that comes with the spiked \"zoinks\" hair since the original one doesn't seem to have it and he's the most obvious Shaggy variant.\n\nI'm a little curious if we'll get desaturated versions of the gang like from the post-2010 DTVs too? I might like the muted colors a little better but I doubt there's enough variation for them to be their own thing. I think Mook, cold weather, hot weather, and What's New designs would be better for the rest of the gang.\n\nTanis or Flim-Flam would be good pack ins with Scrappy so he's not full price for a ~2\" tall figure.\n\nOther looks would be squinty eyed Velma without her glasses and gagged Daphne with included rope for when the bad guy has captured her.\n\nI wouldn’t mind them going hard into classic Hanna Barbera\n\nFlintstones, Jetsons, Yogi Bear, Quick Draw McGraw (with El Kabong as a reuse)\n\nSpace Ghost ( variants could include different effects for his different rays) , Zorak, Brak\n\nJace, Jan, Moltar\n\nBirdman\n\nMighty Mightor\n\nThe Herculoids\n\nJohnny Quest!\n\nyes I did watch a lot of Cartoon Network in the nineties, what gave it away?\n\nYour Daphne and Velma there got me thinking about what the accessories for the other gang members are. I think for Scooby, a scared/screaming face is guaranteed but the girls and Fred? I would like them all to have scared faces because it's not like the gang hasn't all run from a monster a time or two, but Shaggy and Scooby are usually regarded as the \"scared ones.\" With that in mind, I can see them including a glasses-free head with Velma and a gagged head with Daphne.\n\nShaggy has three accessories counting the alternate head, so maybe we're looking at:\n\n- Purse, gagged head, wrist/leg rope for Daphne\n\n- Squinty glasses-free head, book, loose glasses for Velma\n\n- Scared face, Scooby Snack, sandwich for Scooby\n\n- Fred... I guess maybe a net, a pointy finger and a \"we've got a mystery on our hands\" head sculpt?\n\nThis would fill out all of their shticks and be a bit funny. There's a good chance this line will get marketed to kids, who'll have great fun with pretending their toy is kidnapped by a masked maniac or struggling to see because of their disability in a high-danger area.\n\nI’d think every monster would have a neutral head, scary head, and unmasked head, maybe alternate neutral hands and grabbing hands, maybe a tied up with rope accessory for the Meddling Kids end of episode scene.\n\nEven an unmasked mask in a Hand (probably Fred’s) to complete the scene."
