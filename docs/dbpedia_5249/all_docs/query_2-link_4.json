        "text": "This article is about the first live-action film. For the Home Media releases of the film, see Scooby-Doo: The Movie (Home Media). For other uses, see Scooby-Doo (disambiguation).\n\nScooby-Doo, also known as Scooby-Doo: The Movie, is a 2002 live-action film based on the Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning cartoon of the same name, and was the first of the Scooby-Doo live-action films. Scooby-Doo was created on screen using computer generated imagery (CGI). The film was directed by Raja Gosnell, and written by James Gunn, based on a story by Craig Titley and Gunn. It was produced by Charles Roven and Richard Suckle for Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\nThe film was followed by a sequel in 2004, entitled Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed.\n\nPremise[]\n\nHaving been broken up for a couple of years, the gang are brought back together to solve the strange going-ons at a scary-themed resort, occupied by college students on spring break, and the eerie demonic monsters possessing them.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nAfter solving the case of the Luna Ghost (which was the factory janitor getting back at a girl he liked for not asking him out), Mystery Inc. argue over Fred taking credit for Velma's plan and Daphne always getting captured in every mystery, and the group breaks up, leaving Scooby-Doo and Shaggy, to take care of the Mystery Machine. Fred becomes a celebrity autobiographer, Daphne a martial arts expert, and Velma a NASA employee, while Shaggy and Scooby remain beach bums.\n\nTwo years later, the gang are reunited (against their wishes) as each is individually invited to Spooky Island, a \"frightfully\" popular theme park owned by Emile Mondavarious. Mondavarious tells the gang that students are mysteriously becoming mindless zombies and only utter pop phrases. Of course, Fred, Velma and Daphne do not agree to team up and so they go in different directions, despite Shaggy hoping it will be like old times.\n\nShaggy falls for a girl named Mary Jane, while Velma discovers a group of so-called demons that inhabit the island and seek revenge. A man named N' Goo Tuana and a masked wrestler try to spook Velma, but she ignores them. Daphne finds a voodoo man who tells her not to go the Spooky Island castle, but she goes anyway. Scooby gets attacked by a demon, but escapes him. The gang investigate the castle and Fred and Velma discover an odd kind of \"training\" video, as if there were real monsters living on the island involved in brainwashing. Daphne discovers an odd item called the Daemon Ritus. The bad guys nearly track them down, but they get away.\n\nUnfortunately, the demons attack and kidnap a bunch of tourists including Fred and Velma. Daphne learns that Fred and Velma have always been there for her whenever she got kidnapped and they never gave up on her, now she's not giving up on them. The following morning, everything seems to be normal, until Fred appears to be a mindless zombie, Daphne gets captured by the wrestler and becomes a zombie as well. Shaggy, Scooby and Mary Jane flee from the chasing zombies, but Scooby discovers that Mary Jane is a monster in disguise. When he tries to tell Shaggy that she's a monster, Shaggy ignores him, believing that he's just jealous. After a pursuit with the monsters, Scooby falls down a hole and Shaggy follows. He discovers a pool full of protoplasmic heads. He rescues Fred, Velma and Daphne from the pool and then steals the Daemon Ritus. Velma is the first to return to her body and then discovers that the demons were inside their bodies and died when they were exposed to sunlight. Velma also discovers that Fred and Daphne are in each other's bodies.\n\nThe gang is reunited, except for Scooby, and randomly switch bodies until they return to their own. They then encounter the voodoo man who explains that the demons will rule the world for 10,000 years if they get their hands on the Daemon Ritus and complete their ritual (the \"Darkopolypse Ritual\", as said by the voodoo man). But they also need a purely good soul as well: Scooby-Doo. Fred, Daphne, and Velma finally learn to appreciate each other and put their differences aside and work with Shaggy to save Scooby.\n\nThey set up a trap to save the world and destroy the demons, but it messes up and Fred and Velma discover that Mondavarious is the main villain. Shaggy tries in vain to convince Scooby to run before his soul is pulled from his body. Shaggy knocks Mondavarious out and rescues Scooby. Velma and Fred find that Mondavarious is a robot and the one controlling him is Scooby's nephew, Scrappy-Doo who wanted revenge on Mystery Inc., for abandoning him years ago.\n\nScrappy morphs into a giant monster named Scrappy Rex who he chases Scooby and Shaggy about. Fred and Velma flee from his minions while Daphne fights the wrestler on top of the island. Eventually, the gang's plan succeeds; everyone's souls are freed and returned to their rightful bodies and Scrappy Doo reverts to his true form. Shaggy finds the real Mondavarious in a hole and the police arrest Scrappy and his minions, and Fred decides to give Velma the credit she deserves. But before the gang can even relax, the news of another case for them arrives.\n\nIn the meantime, Scooby and Shaggy finally get their free all-you-can-eat meal, which includes very hot chili peppers.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nMain characters:\n\nMystery Inc.

These include: Velma ogling Daphne while she was bent over, Fred trying to seduce Daphne under the pretext of protecting her, and some explicit references to Shaggy & Scooby being stoners. These were removed from the final film, partly out of concern that the movie would garner a R rating with these scenes included.[1] Cleavage was even CGI'd away. A scene was filmed where Velma seductively serenades Fred and Daphne on top a piano while wearing a bra, embroidered with Rosie the Riveter, instead of her usual sweater. A cleaner version of this scene appears on the VHS.[2]\n\nAccording to the director's commentary, the line about Scrappy being corrupted by Daemon Ritus was added to assuage the concerns of parents who thought that Scrappy being the villain was confusing for children. From that same commentary, an alternate ending was filmed and test-screened where Old Man Smithers was revealed to be the villain. This explains his \"I'll get you for this!\" line at the beginning of the movie. It's unknown where the idea of adding Scrappy specifically came about, but Gunn believed the mythology dictated that his inclusion was a must, but turned him into a villain because he hated Scrappy, as he has gone one record multiple times.\n\nOver 400 cast and crew took over one of Australia's largest resorts (Tangalooma Island Resort) for 6 weeks, where the legendary Spooky Island film set was created.[3]\n\nNotes/Trivia[]\n\nMatthew Lillard and Freddie Prinze Jr., both co-starred in She's All That, Summer Catch, and Wing Commander. Prinze, Jr. also co-starred with Sarah Michelle Gellar in I Know What You Did Last Summer, and Gellar also made a cameo appearance in She's All That. Lillard and Gellar were also part of the Scream franchise, whilst Lillard played the antagonist in the first film, Gellar played the victim in the second film. In addition, Lillard had also acted with Gellar in the second Scream film, but as a different character in a minor cameo. He had also previously played a hippie in 1995's Hackers, setting the tone for how he'd portray Shaggy.\n\nThe Jim Henson Company constructed a life sized puppet of Scooby for the film but it was replaced with a CGI render.\n\nThere are some mature references, albeit mild, for the older audience, some of which poke fun at the \"realities\" of the characters:\n\nThe Luna Ghost is heavily implied to have groped Daphne.\n\nShaggy and Scooby are implied to be stoners, with smoke coming from the top the Mystery Machine and the song \"Pass the Dutchie\" playing, only to reveal that they're cooking from a mini-grill; \"Mary Jane\", which happens to be Shaggy's favorite name, is a drug euphemism; Shaggy isn't knocked out by the mist from the possessed Mary Jane, but instead delighted by it.\n\nVelma says \"Crap\", after first seeing Daphne at the airport.\n\nMondavarious says he doesn't wanna run into himself in a dark alley, which at night if women go to a dark alley, men can rape women.\n\nDaphne wants to open a can of Chinese \"whoopass\". Coincidentally, the original name for Cartoon Network's The Powerpuff Girls was The Whoopass Girls.\n\nDuring the possessed Fred's conversation with other college students, he uses the term \"biatch\".\n\nVelma consumes alcohol, getting drunk. It's also implied she's never had it before.\n\nAfter Scooby sees a creature out the window, he makes a commotion about it, and Fred reacts by telling him he hasn't been this embarrassed since the former cleaned his \"beans\" at Don Knotts's Christmas party.\n\nAfter Fred is initially freaked out by being in Daphne's body, he realizes the benefits, which irks Velma.\n\nShaggy's comparison of each member in the gang to banana split toppings can be interpreted in a variety of ways.\n\nThis film marks the first onscreen \"death\" of Scooby-Doo. A skeleton resembling Scooby appears in the Velma episode A Velma in the Woods.\n\nAfter his arrest, Scrappy says \"I would've gotten away with it too, if not for you meddling sons of-\" before being cut off.\n\nAt the time of the film's release, Scott Innes, who was the voice of Scrappy-Doo in this film, was also the voice of Scooby and Shaggy in the direct-to-video films and other miscellaneous appearances.\n\nFrank Welker, who performs the voice of Fred in the cartoons (and at that point soon to be Scooby-Doo), provides the vocal effects for the creatures who possess the tourists along with Jess Harnell .\n\nVoodoo Maestro isn't named within the film, with only the end credits identifying him.\n\nThe film marks Scrappy's first appearance since the 1988 telefilm Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf.\n\nVoodoo Maestro mentions that it is May.\n\nBoth Mystery Inc. breaking up and the real Mondavarious disappearing happened two years ago, meaning that when the gang out kicked out Scrappy-Doo, it must've happened not long before the Luna Ghost case.\n\nAccording to James Gunn, Shaggy is a vegan in this film in compliance to Casey Kasem's wishes.[4] Although, the next film forgets this, as Shaggy eats and references Burger King and/or KFC, fast food restaurants.\n\nIn an interview with Daily Radar, Gunn confirmed that events similar to the first two seasons of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! and both seasons of The New Scooby-Doo Movies took place in the movie's alternate continuity.[5]\n\nIn the British TV Show Primeval the character of Connor Temple mentioned that he had a crush on Buffy from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, who was played by Sarah Michelle Gellar. He then concluded the sentence by saying that he stopped liking her because she started hanging out with \"badly animated dogs\".\n\nOld Man Smithers may be a reference to a Wayne's World scene where they parody a Scooby-Doo episode and unmask Old Man Withers.\n\nThe DVD release of the film included a variety of printables accessible by inserting the disc into a PC.\n\nLinda Cardellini would later return to the franchise to play Hot Dog Water in Mystery Incorporated.\n\nThe original '90s script, written by Craig Titley, was a story about Shaggy going off to college at Kingston University. Interestingly, it included a line with Scooby swearing at an evil dognapper which segues right into James Gunn's take on the franchise. Jon Colton Barry, writer of Be Cool, Scooby-Doo! confirmed that his use of Kingston University was not inspired by Craig Titley's script.\n\nA long running rumor stated that Tim Curry (a long time Scooby-Doo fan) was originally going to star as Emile Mondavarious. However, he turned down the role because he found out that Scrappy was in the movie and like many fans he hated Scrappy. However, this rumor is completely false.[6]\n\nAnimation (CGI) mistakes and/or technical glitches[]\n\nNone known.\n\nInconsistencies/continuity errors and/or goofs/oddities[]\n\nThe demons that take over the humans, aren't given a specific name, they're just generalized as \"Creatures.\"\n\nScooby rather irresponsibly leaves his nephew out in the desert to fend for himself, such an action could lead to more serious consequences. But then again in this timeline he wasn't a puppy, he just had a gland disorder.\n\nDuring the scene when the monsters attacked the hotel, Daphne runs up the stairs wearing sneakers, instead of her pink go-go boots.\n\nShaggy wanting to leave the island and being fine with the monsters \"eating Fred and Velma\" seems very mean and cowardly even for Shaggy, considering Fred and Velma are two of his best friends.\n\nHow N' Goo Tuana's is allowed to live on the island, which is owned by Mondavarious, is unexplained.\n\nHow the creatures are connected to the Daemon Ritus and how Scrappy learned about either is also left unexplained.\n\nThe gang didn't get the monsters that left the island, and one of them could have been spared from the sun if they were inside.\n\nWhen Shaggy found the real Mondavarious, he had long, scraggly hair and a beard, but a few minutes later when he walks to the reporters, his hair is cut and is clean shaven.\n\nThe tiny henchman wasn't detained on the helicopter with the rest of the culprits. He was either overlooked or had also been possessed by a demon.\n\nThe film doesn't explain how and when Mary Jane got captured and possessed by the \"Creatures\".\n\nIt was never explained if Fitzgibbon and his friend at the Coast Guard tower were involved. From their reactions, they must have been involved. However, according to editor Kent Beyda, Fitzgibbon and his friend were possessed by demons.\n\nIn other languages[]\n\nLanguage Name Meaning Greek Scooby-Doo!: Ένας Τετράποδος Ήρωας Scooby-Doo!: A Four-Legged Hero\n\nHome media[]\n\nScooby-Doo VHS released by Warner Home Video on October 11, 2002.\n\nScooby-Doo DVD released by Warner Home Video on October 11, 2002.\n\nScooby-Doo VHS released by Warner Home Video on November 14, 2002.\n\nScooby-Doo VHS released by Warner Home Video on November 25, 2002.\n\nScooby-Doo DVD released by Warner Home Video on November 25, 2002.\n\nScooby-Doo DVD released by Warner Home Video on April 4, 2004.\n\nScooby-Doo Blu-Ray released by Warner Home Video on January 16, 2007.\n\nScooby-Doo Blu-Ray released by Warner Home Video on August 1, 2012.\n\nQuotes[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nVideos[]\n\nPosters[]\n\nPress Artwork[]\n\nMerchandise[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
