        "text": "Scooby Doo\n\nThis topic contains:\n\noverall comments and recommendations\n\ndetails of classification and consumer advice lines for Scooby Doo\n\na review of Scooby Doo completed by the Australian Council on Children and the Media (ACCM) on 10 July 2002.\n\nOverall comments and recommendations\n\nAbout the movie\n\nThis section contains details about the movie, including its classification by the Australian Government Classification Board and the associated consumer advice lines. Other classification advice (OC) is provided where the Australian film classification is not available.\n\nACCM review\n\nThis review of the movie contains the following information:\n\na synopsis of the story\n\nuse of violence\n\nmaterial that may scare or disturb children\n\nproduct placement\n\nsexual references\n\nnudity and sexual activity\n\nuse of substances\n\ncoarse language\n\nthe movie’s message\n\nA synopsis of the story\n\nMystery Inc disbands due to petty squabbles and jealousies but is reunited two years later when each of the team receives an invitation from Mr. Mondavarious to solve the mystery on Spooky Island. The group arrives to find a haunted amusement park where vacationing, rowdy punks are being turned into zombies resembling well behaved college students. There are plenty of monsters and evil villains on this island who perform all manner of horrific and supernatural deeds such as voodoo rituals and breathing out green vapour which renders the victim unconscious. The five heroes, Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby Doo decide it is better to work as a team to uncover the plot. Together they meet all kinds of dangerous situations which they tackle head on. There is much fighting and cartoon type violence where a lot of people get hit but are apparently unhurt. Daphne performs a major martial arts sequence in which she defeats a burly guard twice her size.\n\nThe team discover that the evil villain is stealing peoples’ “protoplasm” or soul which is then placed in a large swirling pool. The villain manages to take Fred, Daphne and Velma but Shaggy lifts their protoplasms out of the pool and returns them to their bodies. It takes some time for the protoplasms to find the right body with the consequence that Daphne is speaking in Fred’s voice and Fred is speaking in Daphne’s etc. until they get sorted out. By pulling off his face they discover that the evil villain in the body of Mr. Mondavarious is in fact Scrappy Doo who wants to take his revenge on the team for abandoning him when he was a puppy. We then see Scrappy Doo transform into a huge dog monster intent on taking over the world. The Mystery Inc team solve the day however and everyone is returned to their normal selves and Scrappy Doo is taken away.\n\nFred and Daphne get each other, Shaggy gets a girlfriend called Mary Jane and Velma meets a new boyfriend.\n\nViolence is often performed by the heroes, particularly Fred and Daphne, and is successful.\n\nIt has few real life consequences—it is unlikely Daphne could defeat a burly guard twice her size with all her martial arts expertise. Also no-one seems to get hurt or stays unconscious for long.\n\nThe movie is set in a comic context which includes the violent episodes—there is an element of unreality about the violence as in a cartoon, but younger children would not discern this.\n\nMaterial that may scare or disturb children\n\nFor children under seven there are many images and visuals that they may find scary:\n\nGhosts\n\nMonsters\n\nGrotesque creatures\n\nEvil looking real dwarves\n\nHaunted amusement park\n\nHaunted castle where objects come to life\n\nVelma and Fred narrowly miss being chopped in half by huge swinging blades\n\nMonsters breathing out green vapour\n\nMonsters roaring loudly\n\nGhost trying to set Scooby Doo on fire\n\nMonster totem pole that speaks\n\nTalking skeleton\n\nLoud drums\n\nMan performing voodoo ritual on a dead chicken with a large knife\n\nMary Jane’s face turns really evil and then she stretches it back to normal\n\nMary Jane speaks in a man’s voice\n\nWhen protoplasms are re-entering bodies, the bodies writhe and expel the monster from within, which then disintegrates\n\nScrappy Doo transforms into huge evil dog monster\n\nDaphne talking in Fred’s voice\n\nFor school aged children, much of the violence is unrealistic, which at this age they would be able to discern. However the Mystery Inc team are threatened by violent men which could be perceived as real. Scooby Doo is also threatened by monsters and with having to be a “pure sacrifice” for Scrappy Doo to achieve his ends. Some in the younger end of this age bracket could be scared by this.\n\nChildren in this age group may also be disturbed by the above-mentioned scenes.\n\nNothing further of concern.\n\nProduct placement\n\nNone noted.\n\nSexual references\n\nThere are some sexual references and innuendo in this movie, including:\n\nThe girls, particularly Daphne, wear skimpy clothes and reveal much cleavage.\n\nWhen Fred is inside Daphne’s body he says he can see himself (Daphne) naked.\n\nNudity and sexual activity\n\nNone noted.\n\nUse of substances\n\nThere is some use of substances in this movie, including:\n\nThere is innuendo of drug use by Shaggy. He is shown in his van with smoke drifting out of the top only to see that it is meat cooking. Also his girlfriend’s name is Mary Jane which is often a colloquialism for marijuana. When Mary Jane at one time breathes ‘green stuff’ on him he says “like wow”.\n\nThere is drinking of alcohol on the plane and on the island. Velma is given a drink “on the house” which is spiked and she appears drunk.\n\nCoarse language\n\nNone noted.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\nThe main take-home message of this movie is that it is okay to use violence if it beats the bad guy.\n\nValues shown in the movie parents may wish to encourage are friendship, teamwork and equal gender roles.\n\nValues shown in the movie that parents may wish to discourage are that violence is a way to solve conflict, attractive people are usually not bright, intelligent people wear thick rimmed glasses and well behaved college students are zombies."
