        "text": "#10: “Scooby-Doo! Abracadabra-Doo” (2010)\n\nScooby and the gang go up against a Griffin and a Banshee in this amusing romp. Along with debuting Matthew Lillard as Shaggy’s voice, “Abracadabra-Doo” marked a shift in art style for the movies, utilizing an aesthetic closer to the original 1969 series. Although Mystery Inc. ends up at not-Hogwarts to help Velma’s sister Madelyn, this film’s star is unquestionably Shaggy. Not only does Shaggy have a cute dynamic with Madelyn, but he also goes through quite an arc, proving that fear and bravery can co-exist. “Abracadabra-Doo” has a grand setting, plenty of memorable character moments, and a decent mystery.\n\n#9: “Scooby-Doo! Stage Fright” (2013)\n\nIn this one, Fred and Daphne have made it to the finals of Talent Star, a reality show that happens to be taking place in a haunted opera house. Taking inspiration from “Phantom of the Opera,” “Stage Fright” introduces a colorful cast of one-off characters who help elevate its recognizable premise. The mystery culminates in an exciting final act that involves a surplus of unmaskings, a high-speed chase, and some purposefully terrible jokes. While most movies do little more than hint at Daphne’s and Fred’s mutual feelings for one another, “Stage Fright” uses this relationship as its emotional core.\n\n#8: “Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders” (2000)\n\nFollowing two of the darkest “Scooby-Doo” movies, the franchise ditched horror for sci-fi to groovy results. While in New Mexico, the gang encounter aliens, a conspiracy, and even a touch of love. Although not entirely absent, “Alien Invaders” puts its mystery on the back burner, opting to focus on Shaggy’s and Scooby’s budding romances with Crystal and Amber instead. In a series filled with notable side characters, Crystal and Amber are especially wonderful, and they bring the best out of Scooby and especially Shaggy. While low on suspense, “Alien Invaders” makes up for it by being extra sweet and heartfelt.\n\n#7: “Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire” (2003)\n\nIn Australia’s outback, Scooby and the gang learn they have more to fear than just wildlife. This 2003 movie revolves around a music festival that happens to be attracting the attention of a trio of menacing vampires and one who looks kind of similar to “Fantasia’s” Chernabog. As the first movie released after the launch of “What's New, Scooby-Doo?,” “Legend of the Vampire” utilizes the series’ more colorful and light aesthetic, and it more than fits the story. Although the visuals are modern, the movie reunites some of the voice actors from “Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!,” which is always a positive.\n\n#6: “Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School” (1988)\n\nLike 1985’s “The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo,” “Ghoul School” goes full supernatural. Shaggy, Scooby, and Scrappy become gym teachers at a school for the daughters of iconic monsters like Dracula, the Wolfman, and the Mummy. “Ghoul School” ditches anything resembling a mystery for shenanigans, rotten food, a volleyball game, and a revolting baddie. Almost having a slice of life tone at times, “Ghoul School’s” episodic structure works in its favor since it puts the focus squarely on the characters, and the girls are all winners. At the end of the day, “Ghoul School” is funny and charming.\n\n#5: “Scooby-Doo! in Where’s My Mummy?” (2005)\n\nCompared to early horror-adjacent series, “What's New, Scooby-Doo” had more of an adventurous tone, and that extended to the movies released alongside the show's run. “Where’s My Mummy?” serves as a great example of this globe-trotting era of “Scooby-Doo.” The story feels larger-than-life, almost like a cross between Mystery Inc. and “Tomb Raider.” The gang head to the Sphinx in Egypt to surprise Velma, only for a curse to be unleashed by a group of treasure hunters. Moving at a blistering pace, “Where’s My Mummy?” doesn't have a dull moment, and the mystery concludes with a pretty clever twist.\n\n#4: “Scooby-Doo! and the Witch’s Ghost” (1999)\n\nBuilding on the success of “Zombie Island,” “Witch’s Ghost” drops Mystery Inc. in a town with a history of witch trials and the drive to milk it for a quick buck. Naturally, a witch’s ghost has been terrorizing the town, forcing the gang to get to the bottom of things. “Witch’s Ghost” has a ridiculously strong roster of secondary characters, with the Hex Girls proving to be so popular that the franchise would bring them back multiple times over. Tim Curry also voices Ben Ravencroft, so obviously, that character is the best.\n\n#3: “Scooby-Doo! Camp Scare” (2010)\n\nCamps and “Scooby-Doo” are synonymous with horror, so it only makes sense to combine the two. At the behest of Fred, the gang take up jobs as counselors at Little Moose, a camp so haunted, it almost has more monsters than campers. With multiple villains, dynamite, a broken dam, and an underwater town, “Camp Scare” throws out one splendid set piece after another. While the action is fun, the movie’s humor and characters are even better: Velma forms a touching friendship with Trudy, one of the campers; Burt and Darrel are lovable bit-part players; and Fred is lowkey hilarious.\n\n#2: “Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase” (2001)\n\nBringing to an end a tetralogy that started with “Zombie Island,” “Cyber Chase” is a celebration of “Scooby-Doo’s” past, present, and future. Through a series of unfortunate events, Mystery Inc. becomes trapped in a video game based on their adventures with a virus that wants to make sure they never leave. While always enjoyable, “Cyber Chase” really comes to life in its final act when the characters meet their 1969 versions and a whole host of classic villains. “Cyber Chase” provides closure to not just this run of movies but the overall franchise, allowing long-time fans to say goodbye to the characters they grew up with.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions.\n\n“Scooby-Doo! & Batman: The Brave and the Bold” (2018)\n\nBecause the Dark Knight & Scooby Complement Each Other Shockingly Well\n\n“Scooby-Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur” (2011)\n\nBecause a Shaggy-Centric Movie Is Always a Good Time\n\n“Chill Out, Scooby-Doo!” (2007)\n\nBecause This One Is All About Shaggy & Scooby\n\n“Scooby-Doo! Pirates Ahoy!” (2006)\n\nBecause This High Seas “Scooby” Adventure Is a Hoot & a Half\n\n“Scooby-Doo! and the Loch Ness Monster” (2004)\n\nBecause the Scottish Setting Offers a Welcome Change Of Scenery\n\n#1: “Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island” (1998)\n\nThis time, the monsters are real and not funny. Sparking a golden era for the franchise, “Zombie Island” is the closest a “Scooby” movie has come to pure horror. Tired of chasing people in masks, the gang goes their separate ways, only to reunite when Daphne sets out to find a real monster. “Zombie Island” plays around with both the audience’s and the characters’ expectations, delivering a captivating mystery with an effective twist, a chilling backstory, and creepy monster designs. Outside of the “Mystery Incorporated” series, some comics, and the “Supernatural” crossover, “Zombie Island” is “Scooby-Doo” at its darkest, all the while still respecting the franchise’s legacy. Also, “It’s Terror Time Again” is an incredible song."
