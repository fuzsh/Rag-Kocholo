        "text": "Once I saw Lee Van Cleef in For a Few Dollars More as a kid, he became one of my favorite actors. Although he’s done a lot of work outside the western genre (Escape from New York and Master Ninja immediately spring to mind), every time I close my eyes and envision Van Cleef, he’s wearing a cowboy hat. Because of that, this Legends post will feature four westerns starring the man himself, Lee Van Cleef.\n\nFirst up is…\n\nSABATA (1970) **\n\nLee Van Cleef stars as a badass named Sabata who rides around The Wild West kicking ass and taking names. When he finds out some no-good bastards robbed a bank, he guns them all down and returns the money to the town. Instead of asking for a reward, Sabata deduces the identity of the mastermind behind the robbery and hatches various blackmail schemes to play on the villain.\n\nI had already seen the sequels to Sabata (Return of Sabata and Adios, Sabata), but somehow never got around to seeing the original. Although I found the sequels to be enjoyable up to a point; neither of them really were all that great or anything. This one is slightly better than its sequels and is a tad bit more fun, but it’s still not very good. My biggest complaint was that the plot moseys along when it should really be kicking into gear. And while the film has some bright spots, there are considerable lulls in between the good stuff. It also suffers from about three too many false endings too.\n\nThe good news is that Van Cleef is excellent in this movie. He’s cool as a mother-humping cucumber as he uses an assortment of custom made guns (including a quadruple barrel pistol) to mow down his enemies. I also dug the scene where he posed as a painting to get the drop on some bad dudes. It was like something out of a goddamned Scooby-Doo episode. William Berger was also very good as Van Cleef’s sidekick-turned-rival who has a banjo that doubles as a gun. (Robert Rodriguez must’ve seen this before he made the El Mariachi movies.) Neither of their performances makes or breaks the movie, but at least their efforts keep you watching.\n\nOur next foray into Van Cleef cinema is…\n\nCAPTAIN APACHE (1971) **\n\nLee Van Cleef stars as a Captain of the Union army who also happens to be a full-blooded Apache. He’s investigating a murder victim’s last words (“April morning…”) and goes around roughhousing suspects in search for answers. The trail eventually leads to a slimy businessman (Stuart Whitman) who is looking to get rich and maybe even assassinate the President.\n\nCaptain Apache kicks things off with a great title sequence. Not only is it reminiscent of the Dollars films, it also features an awesome theme song sung by none other than Lee Van Cleef himself!!! (And yes this is one case in which having three exclamation points is justified.) Too bad the rest of the movie isn’t nearly as cool as that title track.\n\nDespite the cool title sequence, awesome music, the presence of Van Cleef, and the fact that it was written by Phillip (Night Train to Terror) Yordan; it’s still not very good. The film is especially frustrating because it takes a potentially intriguing idea (our hero doesn’t fit in with the whites or his Apache brothers) and does very little with it. Instead, the bulk of the flick concentrates on a murky conspiracy plot that frankly, isn’t very interesting.\n\nThe highlights are few and far between however. We do get one nifty freakout sequence in a cave, which is notable for happening two decades before On Deadly Ground. Sadly, as Van Cleef’s investigation wears on, you’re liable to get bored fairly quickly.\n\nAKA: Deathwork. AKA: The Guns of April Morning.\n\nOur next Van Cleef joint is…\n\nGRAND DUEL (1974) **\n\nLee Van Cleef plays a sheriff who helps a fugitive escape the clutches of a posse of bounty hunters. We learn that the dude is actually wrongly accused and is actively looking to avenge his brother’s death. Van Cleef however is keeping a secret that could jeopardize his newfound friendship.\n\nGrand Duel starts in fine fashion (I dug the scene in which Lee flashes back to remember how many bullets his quarry fired), but the film quickly runs out of steam early on. It also suffers greatly whenever Van Cleef isn’t on screen (which is a good chunk of the middle section of the film) and/or whenever someone isn’t getting shot the fuck up. Things perk up during the finale, but by that point, the flick had veered off the rails with no hope of recapturing its early promise. And although the twist ending is handled decently enough, it’s still pretty predictable.\n\nThe most notable thing about Grand Duel isn’t the dull pacing, the predictable plot, or the solid Lee Van Cleef performance; it’s the music. Quentin Tarantino fans will instantly recognize it from Kill Bill. At least in Kill Bill, it perfectly fit the operatic feel of that film. Here, it easily outshines the otherwise mundane flick.\n\nAKA: Hell’s Fighters. AKA: Storm Riders. AKA: The Big Showdown.\n\nAnd our final Lee Van Cleef film is…\n\nKID VENGEANCE (1977) ***\n\nLeif Garrett sees Lee Van Cleef and his desperadoes rape his mother and kill his father. He then tracks Van Cleef and his men through the desert and offs them in a variety of clever ways. He puts a poisonous snake in one guy’s saddlebags, sticks a scorpion in another dude’s boots, stones one guy, and hangs another. He eventually teams up with another man wronged by Van Cleef’s gang (Jim Brown) and together they set out to get some payback.\n\nKid Vengeance is quite simply the best Pre-Teen Wild West version of Death Wish ever made. Golan-Globus produced it so you know it’s quality stuff. But although it has a great cast and a compelling story, the film sorta loses its way as it goes along. In particular, the pacing flags once Brown starts helping Garrett to rescue his sister from Van Cleef’s gang. And to be completely honest, Garrett did a fine job at carrying the film all by himself and didn’t really need Brown’s help.\n\nNevertheless Kid Vengeance is still a solid and quirky little western. Say what you will about Garrett, but he does a really fine job here. The scenes where he curls up in the fetal position while his mother is being attacked is some mighty good acting if you ask me. He also dishes out his vengeance in a convincing manner too. It’s a shame about his subsequent personal problems because this film shows that he had the makings of a pretty good actor.\n\nLee Van Cleef is really good as the villain. With his scraggly beard and bandana, Van Cleef looks like a pissed-off hippie or something. Jim Brown is solid, although he has the thankless job of providing a pseudo-father figure to Garrett late in the game. And John (Deathdream) Marley (sporting a funny Mexican accent) has some good scenes as Van Cleef’s right hand man.\n\nBrown and Van Cleef were also in El Condor together.\n\nAKA: Vengeance. AKA: Vendetta. AKA: Take Another Hard Ride.\n\nNext week’s Legend: Robert De Niro."
