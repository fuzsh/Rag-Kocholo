        "text": "This phrase, supposedly uttered by Apollo 13 commander, Jim Lovell was, in its original rendering: \"Houston, we've had a problem. We've had a main B bus undervolt.\" However, the first notification to Houston that there was a problem was by fellow astronaut Jack Swigert, who used almost identical words. The official NASA chronology [9] lists the messages as:\n\n55:55:20 – Swigert: \"Okay, Houston, we've had a problem here.\"\n\n55:55:28 – Lousma: \"This is Houston. Say again please.\"\n\n55:55:35 – Lovell: \"Houston, we've had a problem. We've had a main B bus undervolt.\""
