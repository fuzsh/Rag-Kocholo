        "text": "With very little fanfare, Cartoon Network dumped the 2nd half of the second season of Scooby Doo! Mystery Incorporated! on air in April 2013 just like you and I would put out the trash. This show deserved a better send off than it got from its network hosts. In the space of eleven days, between March 25 and April 5, Cartoon Network with very little advertising showed all 11 remaining episodes of the second season, thus closing out what had, otherwise, been a delightful 52 episode run. Shame on you, Cartoon Network for doing this to one of your premiere franchises.\n\n*May Contain Spoilers*\n\nThis post contains spoilers about Scooby Doo! Mystery Incorporated! You can come back in a couple of days when I can guarantee the post will not be about this Cartoon Network show. Otherwise, you have been warned!\n\n*Contains Spoilers*\n\nThis was a fun show and one I’m sorry to see end. (And that’s something I never thought I’d say about any version of Scooby Doo.) While there weren’t as many pop cultural references in the second half of the season as there were in the first season and a half, there were still plenty to go around. From Daphne and Fred quoting Kirk and McCoy from Star Trek III: The Search for Spock as the Mystery Machine exploded, Babylonian prophecies, string theory, Twin Peaks, Velma’s exclamation of Schrödinger’s cat and sentient plants, the final 11 episodes fired on all cylinders.\n\nDuring these final episodes, the history of Mystery Incorporated from its Mayan beginnings to the present group was explored. We also learned that neither Ricky Owens (as Mr. E) or Professor Pericles were the real “big bad” of the series. Rather it was the Evil Entity, who has been manipulating all of the predecessors of Mystery Incorporated since the Mayan days. But the story editor of the series, Michael F. Ryan, saved the best for last.\n\nIn a huge shout out to Harlan Ellison’s famed Star Trek episode, The City on the Edge of Forever, after the Evil Entity is destroyed, the gang find themselves in a new world. It’s a world where all of the evil caused by the Entity throughout history has been undone. So, Fred’s parents, Brad Chiles and Judy Reeves never joined a mystery solving gang and aren’t the least bit interested in traps because they’re both obstetricians. Daphne’s parents want her to marry Fred (something they were opposed to in the other universe). Shaggy is an award-winning teen chef. Ricky Owens and Cassidy Williams are married and owners of the company Creationex and Professor Pericles is the company mascot. And Marcy (Hot Dog Water) is a very successful science student who seems to share a special relationship with Velma (adding fuel to internet speculation relative to Velma’s sexuality). But most importantly, the gang is in an alternative timeline where all the mysteries they’ve solved never occurred.\n\nBut the Ellison shout out doesn’t end here. It turns out there is a new Mr. E and he is in fact Harlan Ellison himself who slipped into the alternative timeline with the gang. He has admitted the gang into his class next semester in the college where he teaches, which by chance is located across country. So the gang fix up the van and head out of town to the sound of a laugh track and applause. At that point, you realize that you have been given the explanation for how these four humans and their dog got together, where they are going and why (and thus the origin of the original 1969 Scooby Doo, Where Are You!).\n\nThis version of Scooby Doo was never really child friendly, but it was always child watchable. This was Scooby Doo for adults and I enjoyed this program a lot. The first season is streaming on Netflix and the complete series is available on iTunes and Amazon. This, by far, was the best version of those meddling kids and their dog.\n\nFrom Animation Magazine comes a preview of Cartoon Network’s busy 2013- 2014 TV viewing season. And I have to be honest with you, I’m fighting the urge to take a two-by-four to someone’s head at Cartoon Network. It is… for the lack of a better term… disappointing.\n\nThe good news is, if you’re a fan of DC comics, that Teen Titans Go which will will premiere in April of this year, features the return of Robin, Starfire, Raven, Beast Boy and Cyborg . Sadly, if you’ve watched the DC animation block on Saturdays on Cartoon Network, I suspect we’ve already seen a preview of what you can expect. It will be a superhero series that focuses on “…the funny business that happens between saving the world and living together as teenagers without adult supervision.” There will also be another DC animation series called, Beware the Batman. Supposedly, “…this action-packed detective thriller deftly redefines what we have come to know as a ‘Batman show.’” Forgive me if I withhold judgment on that claim until the premiere which will be during the summer of this year.\n\nThe bad news for fans of DC comics is that apparently Green Lantern: The Animated Series and Young Justice were not renewed. This is particularly disappointing because these two well written shows, which appeal to older audiences, have an intensely loyal following that made themselves known to Cartoon Network when the shows were pulled off the air during the Thanksgiving/ Christmas holidays. Hopefully, Cartoon Network will allow the two programs to have some sort of a finale episode as opposed to simply pulling them off the air.\n\nAnd if you’re a fan of classic comic animation you cannot help but be distressed by the fact that there’s going to be a new Tom and Jerry show. You’ll forgive me if I don’t get enthusiastic about this announcement. Over the last 50 years, Warner Brothers and Hanna and Barbera have attempted to recapture the magic of the 1940s cartoon series and have failed miserably each time. The fact is the essence of those cartoons is almost impossible to capture in today’s politically correct, non-violent, Saturday morning TV environment (and we should simply stop trying).\n\nI am heartened that they are bringing back DreamWorks Dragons: Riders of Berk, Ben 10 Omniverse and Scooby-Doo! Mystery Inc. But missing from the list of returning shows is Star Wars: The Clone Wars. While I don’t have any confirmation as to why Star Wars isn’t coming back, I will speculate that Disney’s recent purchase of the Star Wars franchise from George Lucas may the reason. I wouldn’t be too surprised to see future Star Wars: The Clone Wars episodes on ABC family or Toon Disney (XD) or some other Disney owned property.\n\nThe list of returning properties and specials can be found at Animation Magazine. There are times when I hope that Cartoon Network finds itself and finds the audience that is out there – an audience that is desperate and hungry for the decent Warner Brothers properties. But I don’t think it’s going to be this year or next.\n\n*May Contain Spoilers*\n\nThis post contains spoilers about Scooby Doo! Mystery Incorporated! You can come back in a couple of days when I can guarantee the post will not be about this Cartoon Network show. Otherwise, you have been warned!\n\n*Contains Spoilers*\n\nWhen we last left our gang at Crystal Cove, Fred discovered that Mayor Jones, the man who had raised him, was not his real father, and broke off his engagement to Daphne to go search for his real parents. Shaggy’s parents sent him to military school and Scooby to a farm. Velma was branded a pariah to the group because she did not tell the rest of the gang what she knew about Cassidy Williams, also known as Angel Dynamite. Professor Pericles had two pieces of the puzzle and seemed quite content with himself even as Scooby Doo vowed to somehow get the gang back together. As far as cliffhangers went, this was a good one.\n\nSadly, I hate to admit it, but I’ve been disappointed by the second season of this program. Still, I think that for the most part, it remains one of the better written animated shows on TV. Over the last 15 episodes of the second season, it is managed to do shout outs to several cult series to include: Hart to Hart, The Shining, Jonny Quest and its own corporate history. It did answer several questions that I’d posed back in July of 2011, such as we now know Ricky Owens (Mister E) is the owner of Destroido, the biggest business of Crystal Cove. We also know that Doctor Benton Quest created Dynomutt (of Blue Falcon fame).\n\nAdditionally, we now know that Rickey and Cassidy Williams were lovers or at least in love at one point in their lives. And speaking of Cassidy Williams, I’ll be honest, I was disappointed at the sacrificing of this character to move the story along. I know that there will be some who say that she is still alive because nobody ever dies in Scooby Doo. I hope that’s the case, but underwater explosions are really bad news for those submerged in the water at the time; thus, I think that Cassidy is no more. By the way, the voice acting of this series has remained superb with Mindy Cohen’s Velma providing the series standard.\n\nI think what disappoints me the most about this second season is that they did not get the interpersonal relationships right the same way, they did get them right in the first season. For example, Marcy (Hot Dog Water), wonderfully voiced by the live action Velma, Linda Cardellini, was unceremoniously kicked out of the gang as soon as Daphne returned. That was wrong and clearly hurtful, but I expected Velma to call her group on it and she didn’t. Now maybe she didn’t because she wanted to continue to be accepted by her peers which had rejected her earlier. But Velma has always had a strong moral code and it was disappointing to see her not act on it.\n\nThat said, to me the high point of this 15 episode second season was the episode: Night Terrors. In this episode, which is a homage to the movie The Shining, Shaggy and Daphne (wearing only a robe and a towel) are caught by Freddie and Velma making out in Shaggy’s room. It was the scene that fan boys (and fan girls) of the 1985, 13 Ghost of Scooby Doo had been hoping to see for decades. In that series, you’ll recall, it was only Shaggy and Daphne (no Fred, no Velma) along with Scooby and Scrappy Doo who solved mysteries. Honestly, I laughed out loud at the scene and reveled in Shaggy’s clear enjoyment of the moment and Daphne’s clear embarrassment at the tryst once they’d been discovered.\n\nThis second season has ended and the only thing that we know for certain is that there have been previous incarnations of mystery incorporated – always consisting of four humans and an animal. And in each case, the team was destroyed by the animal going mad in some manner. I honestly don’t know when or if there will be a third season because Cartoon Network did a very poor job, in my opinion, in advertising the second season and I don’t think they’ll do any better with a third. But my DVR is set and I’ll be sitting on the edge of my seat awaiting the return of this series to answer the question that apparently has been driving this entire series: Nibiru is coming and it begins with the animal. Is the dog that dies, Scooby (not likely) or Nova? Or someone else? Guess we’ll just have to wait and see.\n\n* May Contain Spoilers *\n\nThis post contains spoilers about Scooby Doo! Mystery Incorporated. You can come back in a couple days when I can guarantee the post will not be about this Cartoon Network show. Otherwise you have been warned!\n\n* Contains Spoilers *\n\nWhen we left the gang last October, Norville “Shaggy” Rogers and Velma Dinkley had just broken up over Shaggy’s inability to commit to her vice his dog. Daphne Blake and Fred Jones had come to grips with their feelings for each other and were a couple.\n\nSince then, we’ve discovered that the mysterious Mr. E (a word play on the word mystery) is no other than Ricky Owens from the original Mystery Incorporated. We’ve also found out that Velma has discovered, but not shared with the rest of the gang, that Angel Dynamite, the Crystal Cove FM radio disc jockey, is really Cassidy Williams, also an original member of Mystery Incorporated. Finally, Daphne has discovered that Fred is clingy, but we know that it is probably because Fred’s mother left him when he was a baby.\n\nCassidy Williams is working with Ricky Owens against Professor Pericles (the parrot that has lived longer than any bird has a right to live) to discover the missing pieces of the planospheric disk. Fred asked Daphne to marry him and she said she would after they graduated from high school.\n\nLost yet? Well, if you haven’t been following all of the episodes, chances are very good you might be. The season finale for Scooby Doo, Mystery Incorporated is slated for 26 July, 2011. While I’m confident that the major storyline of what happened to the original Mystery Incorporated team will be answered, there are more questions now than ever. For example, what happened to Fred’s mom? Why do Cassidy and Ricky dislike each other so much? And speaking of Ricky Owens, he is clearly very rich. Does his money come from the only big business that seems to be located in Crystal Cove – Destroido?\n\nRegardless of the answers, this incarnation of Scooby Doo has not disappointed me one bit. The writing and directing have been top notch and the voice acting has been superb. Mindy Cohen truly has been fantastic as Velma. She has turned the “little Miss Know-it-all” into a very human character with trust issues. Hope you’ll join me as I clear my calendar for the season finale this month. It will be time well spent.\n\nIt looks like Cartoon Network will finally return to something resembling the much missed “Toonami” block of programming. Frankly, it’s about time because the popular “Toonami” went off the air about two years ago without a suitable replacement. I can only envision that someone at the CN corporate office finally asked if there were any properties that they could leverage into a cartoon and someone answering with a “Well, you know we own DC Comics, Warner Brothers movie studios and all of the Hanna-Barbara library, right?”\n\nSo this coming year, animation fans of Cartoon Network can look forward to:\n\nA new Ben 10 series (No Announced Title)\n\nThunderCats (which fans of the old 80’s series should probably take a “wait & see” attitude towards because it’s going to be “re-imagined.”)\n\nGreen Lantern – based on the summer movie.\n\nHow To Train Your Dragon – based on the book, not the movie.\n\nBatman: The Brave and the Bold – which was thought to be cancelled but will return.\n\nYoung Justice\n\nScooby Doo, Mystery Inc.\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars\n\nGenerator Rex\n\nBen 10: Ultimate Alien – Dwayne McDuffie’s guiding hand will be missed, but not for quite a few episodes.\n\nAlso, in 2012 there will be something called DC Nation. According to Diane Nelson, President of DC Entertainment, “DC Nation on Cartoon Network will be the first-ever dedicated broadcast destination to showcase the depth and breadth of the DC Universe.” Yup, I have no idea what that really means. It could turn out to be a half hour commercial for DC properties or it could be a “clip” show from past TV shows featuring DC characters. We’ll just have to wait and see what we really end up with.\n\nFinally, for the fifteenth thousand time, there will be another attempt to re-imagine the Loony Tunes characters in the modern world which will premiere in May. With the exception of a couple of World War II cartoons, CN would be better served to just air the original cartoons that Warner Brothers still has the rights to, than to constantly attempt to imitate the original. Just my opinion.\n\n*May contain spoilers*\n\nLast night, the 13th episode of Scooby Doo, Mystery Incorporated, “When the Cicada Calls” aired and I am shaking my head. Don’t get me wrong. I like this current millionth reincarnation of the talking dog and his four teenage friends. The problem I have is that the series is quickly falling into predictable and mundane plots. Yes, I know that no one has ever said that an episode of Scooby Doo is supposed to be as puzzling, yet as satisfying as an episode of Perry Mason, but sometimes it seems like the writers are not even trying.\n\nSo far, the series has done some really cool shout-outs to old Hanna-Barbera cartoon characters, like Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm, Speed Buggy and, not surprisingly, to their own corporate past villains and guests. These acknowledgments of the past, earn the writers points with older viewers, but what subtracts those points is laziness for using the original “Law & Order” model of TV scripting. What is the L&O model of scripting? Simply that the real villain/ criminal is NEVER the first suspect arrested. Knowing that, it isn’t hard to identify the real Scooby Doo villain of each episode within the first 10 minutes of the 23 minute cartoon.\n\nHowever, I have been willing to forgive the plot predictability because the series has excelled at showing inter-personal relationships. Velma Dinkley loves Norville (Shaggy) Rogers. Shaggy likes Velma, but chooses to love his dog more (I am so reminded of the Hawkgirl/ Green Lantern/ Vixen mashup from Justice League Unlimited). Daphne Blake really likes Fred Jones who acknowledges that he has feelings for Daphne, but loves building traps more. Finally, for the record, Scooby Doo loves Shaggy and is jealous of Velma.\n\nI will give the writers some credit for acknowledging an important facet of human nature. That is, when a very small group of men and women work together and constantly socialize with each other over a long period of time, bonds of attachment will form between individual group members which over time will become disruptive to the original group dynamic. If a new group dynamic can’t be achieved acknowledging the new bonds, then the group breaks down (and apart). We have already seen this take place on this show with the group breaking up for one episode after Shaggy rejected Velma for his dog and Daphne and Fred going out on a real date in last night episode. Also, in last night’s episode we saw an angry and rejected Velma hinting not too subtlety to Scooby Doo that she will outlive her rival for Shaggy’s affection and is not the least bit interested in being friends with the animal.\n\nThat brings me to something comedian, Ron White once said, “You can’t fix stupid because stupid is forever.” So after 13 episodes, here’s a personal opinion shouted out loud: Shaggy is stupid, not dumb, not an idiot, just plain stupid for choosing the dog over the human female. Newsflash for Norville Rogers – Great Danes only live for 7-10 years. You can always get another dog. It might be 2 or 3 decades before you find another woman willing to put up with your crap. Just saying!\n\nDespite my protest to the contary, the bottom line is I’m still enjoying this version of Scooby Doo, but I suspect that I will soon tire of the predictable plots unless they start moving more quickly to solve the overarching mystery the group discovered in the first episode. Scooby Doo, Mystery Incorporated is no “Secret Saturdays,” but it is still a good view."
