        "text": "Anthropomorphism\n\nAnthropomorphism is the concept of an object, concept or character that has human qualities or traits, such as speech, a level of intelligence similar or higher than a human's and self consciousness. \"Anthro\" means \"of human\" and related to the concept of humanity.\n\nCartoon Character\n\nCartoon characters are personas from cartoons, which are animated moving sequences that are usually drawn but can be computer animated and can come from television, movies, anime or even the web. They can be humans, animals, or even things usually not thought of as living.\n\nColor Cartridges\n\nCartridges are typically one specific color for a particular console. But, on occasion, a game is released with a different color either for a limited edition, special occasion, or for marketing.\n\nDetective\n\nSomeone who investigates unsolved crimes and other mysterious happenings, either for a living, as a hobby, or simply by chance.\n\nDog\n\nA dog is an animal, of which there are estimated to be 400 million of in the world. Said to be man's best friend, they naturally appear in many video games.\n\nDouble Jump\n\nA double jump is the ability to jump while already in mid-air to get some extra lift. In reality, double jumps are not possible and violate fundamental laws of physics.\n\nGame Titles That Are Also Questions\n\nGame titles that pose a rhetorical question to the player. Occasionally, these titles are accompanied with an exclamation point to form an interrobang.\n\nGames Based on Movies\n\nWhenever there's a new Pixar, superhero or Harry Potter movie they have to make one of these.\n\nGhost\n\nThese spooky entities are the spirits of the dead, returned from beyond their graves for generally sinister purposes. There's generally about even odds whether a particular ghost will be helpful or malevolent towards the living, but some ghosts just want to be left alone entirely.\n\nHigh Score\n\nIn many games there is a ranking system, the players with the highest point value are listed in a \"high score\" table.\n\nInfinite Pockets\n\nInfinite Pockets are a system of inventory often found in adventure games. The player character's pockets seem to be of an infinite size, capable of holding anything from peanuts, to garden rakes, to spare tires, yet none of this is reflected on the character.\n\nItem Combination\n\nUsually found in adventure games, when players combine two or more items to create one or more new items.\n\nLicensed Game\n\nThese games are based off of established licenses, such as movies, comics, or TV shows. Examples are the James Bond 007 and Spider-Man franchises.\n\nPirate\n\nBy definition, a pirate is a (mostly naval) robber without commission from a sovereign nation. While maritime robbery has been around since ancient times, Piracy had its highpoint during the 17th century. They are easily identified by the \"Jolly Roger\", which is the traditional name of the famous skull flag.\n\nPoint and Click\n\nPoint and click is an interface featured in a specific kind of adventure game, where players click on objects and characters to interact with them.\n\nTie-In\n\nVideo games that, for better or for worse, are based on an existing non-video game franchise. Usually drawn from movies, tie-in games have also been made about TV shows, novels, and even one-hit wonder pop bands."
