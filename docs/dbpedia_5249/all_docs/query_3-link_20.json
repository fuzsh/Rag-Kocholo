        "text": "Please note that this review does contain spoilers!\n\nSo I really loved this film! I'm super glad I decided to just pick up a DVD copy while I was at the store today, and cancel the pre-order which I think I had mentioned in one of the comment sections that I was originally going to wait for. I think this is the best Scooby film we've gotten in years, and was a breath of fresh air after Curse of the 13th Ghost and Return to Zombie Island.\n\nThe mystery felt very cinematic to me, and I enjoyed the inclusion of The Scarecrow much more than I thought I would. Even though he wasn't a main villain, he provided a great setup for introducing the living pumpkins. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed that so much of the movie was the pumpkins pursuing the gang. I think it could have been done in a very boring way, but the constant presence of the pumpkins made it creepier!\n\nâ€‹I loved all the old references to previous Scooby and Hanna-Barbera material as well. Between a Frankenstein Jr. float, a kid dressed as Blue Falcon, a Phyllis Diller mention, a Fred Flintstone costume, RED HERRING(!), and the Ghost of the Three Stooges, it really felt like a lot of love was put into this film. Am I the only one who would have liked to see the ghosts of the Three Stooges mystery though? I feel like that would have been really cool haha.\n\nI'm not sure if this was just my Scooby-oriented brain creating references that weren't there, but did those two vampire statues when Shaggy and Scooby went in the corn maze look like Dracula from \"A Halloween Hassle at Dracula's Castle\" to anyone else? It sure did to me.\n\nWe also got a reference to Fred's middle name, Herman, which is the first time it's been mentioned 15 years since Aloha, Scooby-Doo! from 2005!\n\nOne thing I really did not like in this film was the use of 60s bubblegum pop music during the chase scenes. I know they're trying to beckon back to Where Are You with that, and they did it in Return to Zombie Island too, but it just seemed out of place to me and I hope it doesn't happen again.\n\nThe one other big thing in this film is Daphne's personality is much more quirky and reminiscent of her Be Cool, Scooby-Doo! personality. I thought it was interesting Daphne wanted to become Elvira too, as Elvira kinda seems more gothy than \"in-fashion\" to me...so this version of Daphne wants to be a goth I guess? I'm here for it.\n\nSpeaking of Elvira, I thought her and Bill Nye fit in really well. They did not seem forced at all as guest stars, and I thought both of them definitely had roles to play in this film.\n\nI also was shocked that the sheriff was the villain! That was such a cool twist and I loved it!\n\nOverall, this film was an amazing Halloween movie that I will definitely be watching every year from now on around this time of year. This film is like SDMI and BCSD had a baby, and it's amazing. It's got a much darker tone that more recent films/series, but it also is pretty silly in some parts. Was this better than Goblin King? I love Goblin King so much, so it would be very hard to top that film. I think this comes close, but it's good in a different way from Goblin King. Goblin King is this very idealistic, magical film to me whereas this one is darker but also very cinematic in quality. I would highly recommend this film!\n\nTo conclude this review, I have to end it the same way the film did...so Elvira's hair is just a monkey? Hahaha\n\nTo continue with our \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\" theme this week (which was totally unintentional by the way, just coincidental), I'm reviewing a very special and very rare piece of Scooby media: the only A Pup Named Scooby-Doo comic ever made! This issue was published 1995, and was written by Bill Matheny and drawn by Scott Jeralds, both of whom worked on the original A Pup Named Scooby-Doo television show.\n\nBefore I go and further, I want to give a huge thanks to my friend Deandre (aka Scoobyfan4ever) for sending this comic to me so I could read and review it!\n\nWe started with \"The Pizza Delivery From Beyond,\" which feels like a lost episode of A Pup Named Scooby-Doo. It stays very true to the tone and style of the series, and all the characters are on-point with their younger personalities.\n\nWe get the normal assortment of minor characters, including this one random zoo ape lol.\n\nAnd speaking of minor mentions, we also get O'Greazy to return, who was a recurring character for three episodes of A Pup Named Scooby-Doo. I thought it was really cool how we learn his first name is Al.\n\nThe comic starts off with Shaggy narrating that him and Scooby are waiting for a pizza delivery, but they get way more than they bargained for when a monster pizza deliveryman attacks them. After a narrow escape, they alert the gang and attempt to solve the mystery.\n\nThe plot is very much something that could have happened in the show, even down to the villain design, which is really cool. I was very disappointed however, that Red Herring never appeared, and even more so that Freddy didn't accuse Red Herring!\n\nBut overall, it's a great short story and my favorite of the two.\n\nThe final story is titled \"Daphne Has Risen From The Grave!\" and features Daphne going exploring in some caves, and returning as a blood-sucking vampire. After she attacks Shaggy and Scooby and tries to turn them into vampires, they enlist the help of the gang.\n\nI enjoyed this story, but we quickly find out (spoilers) the culprit is just Daphne practicing for the school play and I felt that was a little cheesy.\n\nWe do get one inconsistency in this comic, however...the cave Daphne is \"turned\" in is discovered to be a place where Scooby Snacks are mined, but \"Wanted Cheddar Alive\" would beg to differ since they are made in the Scooby Snacks Factory in that episode.\n\nThis really felt like it could be an episode of A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, though. They captured the tone of the series perfectly once again, even down to Freddy accusing Scooby of being a vampire as one of his crazy conspiracy theories.\n\nIt's funny, Daphne turning into a vampire seems to be unintentionally foreshadowed in the beginning of \"The Ghost of Mrs. Shusham,\" when the animators forgot to animate her reflection in the mirror lol. (Actually, now that I'm thinking of it, it's further proof that she was a vampire in that one Scrappy episode, \"I Left My Neck in San Francisco,\" when she was never around when the vampire was and looked similar to the Lady Vampire of the Bay haha.)\n\nOverall, these two stories were a fun nostalgia trip for me! Though the stories were pretty short to be full episodes of the series, I could see them working as good 11-minute shorts like the three they did in the final season of A Pup Named Scooby-Doo. The one element I would say was off in an otherwise perfect representation of this series is they seemed to s separate Shaggy and Scooby by themselves for about half of each story, which is more of a trope in the series where they are adults, but not in A Pup Named Scooby-Doo.\n\nThank you again to Deandre for sending me these stories! This article would not have been possible without him!\n\nThis review will include some light spoilers, though I'm not going to reveal the culprit or anything like that. I will be discussing some details that happen throughout the course of the book.\n\nI thought this follow up to the first novel was really good! Even though we get a different author this time, Morgan Baden (instead of the author of the first book who went by the pseudonym Josephine Ruby), I thought the writing stayed really consistent and nothing felt strange or off-character to me compared to the first one.\n\nOnce again, this book seemed to have references galore. Our main villain of the book this time was The Lady Vampire of the Bay, originally from \"I Left My Neck in San Francisco\" of The Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show in 1979. She seemed to be described with the exact same appearance as the ghoulish vampire from the original episode.\n\nBesides the Lady Vampire, we also get sort-of a role reversed reference to A Pup Named Scooby-Doo where Shaggy's dad is a cop. Instead of that though, Shaggy's mom is a cop, whereas Shaggy's dad (named Samuel, in continuity with SDMI) is a hardened, somewhat unpleasant businessman. Without ruining the ending since I did say light spoilers, I have to say the very last page of this book leaves me on the edge of my seat for the next one!\n\nShaggy also eats vegetarian lasagna in the book, so it's potentially confirmed that Shaggy is a vegetarian in this universe.\n\nMoving on from the many references, I want to talk about how much I love Daphne's characterization in this. She's sort of the rich girl who we know and love from the main continuity, but she's also a bit insecure because of her parents divorcing among other teenage angst. It's hinted she was more bossy and stuck-up as a kid, which I really like since that sort of bridges that gap between her A Pup Named Scooby-Doo personality her the main continuity version, but she's sort of broken now because of all that's happened to her.\n\nDaphne also recounts the gang playing their pretend \"mysteries\" in an old van, presumably hinting at the Mystery Machine. I could see how this would be a turnoff for some, but I sort of like, just in this series's continuity, how they've played it up to have much of their adventures of Mystery Inc. being just kids playing pretend, and now they're faced with real mysteries for the first time. It's sort of neat and makes this series feel like a more realistic take on the franchise. I'm not saying I'd want this in every series, but it's a neat trope for these novels.\n\nBefore we move on from Daphne though, I absolutely have to point out that the word \"bougie\" has officially now been said in the Scooby-Doo franchise for the first time ever. This has been your official \"bougie\" count, now back to the review.\n\nFred gets a little bit more of a part in this than simply having women all draped around him like in the first novel. He seemingly hits on Velma a bit, which I found a little odd and I'm not sure if it was because she went on a \"no glasses\" phase and wore contacts, or if he was genuinely interested in her. I guess we'll have to see. Fred also helps solve the mystery in this novel, and I was happy to see him get a little more of a role.\n\nStill no Scooby whatsoever other than brief mentions, so let's move on to Shaggy. Building off his characterization in the first novel, he seems like a very laid-back, surfer dude type of guy. In a way, he also seems a little tortured as well, and unhappy with his situation with his father. We don't exactly know what that is though, but there seems to be a bit of a mystery still looming over Shaggy's family, so I'm excited to see where that goes!\n\nVelma went on a no-glasses phase in this novel, but later decided that it didn't matter what others thought of her. I thought this was a really nice coming of age message for young adults and was super glad they put this in there. Not really much more to say on Velma this novel, other than I love her personality in this and her snark/wit.\n\nI thought Daphne and Ram's interaction provided a super good message that's really relatable to young adults, or anyone honestly. (This paragraph is probably the most spoilery FYI, so you may want to skip to the next paragraph if you're worried about that). Daphne falling in love with him and opening up so much, only to be crushed and tricked by him is something that's relatable to a lot of us, especially in those teenage years. Many of us have probably met someone we really got along with, opened up to them, and then felt horribly betrayed when we found out the person was not who we thought they were, or even worse, took advantage of us. This happens to Daphne when Ram takes full credit for the story she wrote. I think this is a great, relatable message to have put in here, especially to show young adults that it's okay to feel betrayed and down or whatever, but what's important is that you feel confident in yourself. Some people are going to be untrustworthy or cruel when you open up, but what really matters is that you feel empowered and like who you are. I also liked how they tied it in to the societal phenomenon of men taking advantage of women's work and thinking of them as \"lesser\" simply because they are women.\n\nI enjoyed that the Hex Girls reappeared in this novel! It seems like they're going to be regular characters. On a related note, this is probably due to my own misreading, but I honestly thought the weird little interludes in third-person where the characters have supernatural encounters were something to do with the \"ghosts\" from the first book, but it happened again in this book, so I'm thinking now it's actually part of the overall mystery with \"The Vanished,\" the people who disappeared from Crystal Cove 300 years ago? I'm absolutely we're going to get an overarching storyline later on in this series diving into it further, and I can't wait to see where it goes!\n\nI'm really intrigued with this novel series and where it's going. The writing is spot-on, and develops the characters in such an interesting way. It also has a much more mature feel than really any Scooby series I've read before (with the exclusion of Scooby Apocalypse), but it's also really down to Earth and makes important social commentary. I would highly recommend reading this book, and the first one if you haven't already (you can check out my review for that here).\n\nThe next in the series, #3, comes out on February 2, 2021, so it's kind of a long wait based on how short of a period it was between #1 and #2. There's no info on the author, or title, or much of the plot, or anything really, but I am 100% buying #3 when it comes out. This has been a great series and I really hope this keeps going for a long time!\n\nThe movie only came out and hour and half ago and I'm already posting a review...you better believe I was refreshing that page over and over at 11:59pm EST until midnight. In fact, I'm still listening to \"On Me\" by Thomas Rhett, Kane Brown & Ava Max over the end credits as I type this lol.\n\nThis was an awesome movie! I thought the plot was amazing, as was the acting. I really didn't mind any of the new actors. All four of the main cast did a great job, and I thought Amanda Seyfried as Daphne was the standout actor for me. I loved Ken Jeong especially as Dynomutt and thought he was excellent in playing a more serious version of the classic character. Everyone else did a great job I thought as well, but Jeong and Seyfried really stuck out to me as doing a great job.\n\nThe kids also all did a great job, especially Daphne and Shaggy's. I'll admit, I was actually familiar with Iain Armitage, who played young Shaggy, as he's the main character in another show I love, Young Sheldon, which has referenced Scooby three times in its three seasons and I've written fun facts about it before!\n\nIn terms of the characterization, I thought everyone was spot on. No one seemed out of character, and the few supporting characters that had their characters changed all seemed reasonably so. I liked that Blue Falcon wasn't the original Blue Falcon, but rather his son Brian. It was a cool touch and I didn't mind the change-up there. I also really liked how Dynomutt was much more serious as a character. Despite his goofiness back in the 70s, this version of Dynomutt really worked for me.\n\nRegarding Captain Caveman, I was expecting him to be a much bigger part of the movie. He was in such a brief part of it, which I didn't think was bad, just more unexpected than anything. I honestly thought the other two Teen Angels were going be in the film too besides just Dee Dee! This must take place before that though, since Captain Caveman didn't seem to know her. Dee Dee was a really nice character as well, and I greatly enjoyed her presence as a strong feminine leader.\n\nI really liked Dick Dastardly as a villain. Jason Isaacs did an amazing job taking on the role, and Dick seemed like he was exactly like he was in Laff-a-Lympics (as Dread Baron...never watched Wacky Races personally). I absolutely adored the plotline of Muttley being lost in the underworld...it made me actually feel a little bit for Dick...until the end at least lol.\n\nIn terms of villains, Cerberus had an amazing design. He was a super cool villain and I almost wish he would have been just a little more prominent in the film!\n\nThe comedy was top notch and Scooby was super funny and witty. I especially enjoyed the IKEA joke and him randomly asking if Muttley was chipped haha. And speaking of comedy, Simon Cowell was certainly an interesting addition to the film lol. It was interesting how he wanted to invest in Mystery Inc. as a business and how he was repeatedly brought up throughout the film. It seemed like they almost combined the three groups of prior live action film series for this film...Shaggy and Scooby wanting to prove they're not screw-ups like in the first two, the origin story like the two prequels, plus all the robots and technology of Daphne & Velma.\n\nIt was also really neat how they had all the other Hanna-Barbera characters like Jabberjaw, Magilla Gorilla and Atom Ant (was that the third one?) become part of the Falcon Fury during the credits.\n\nI felt the plot was just top-notch and I love how it sort of felt like a mystery but a bigger, more expanded one that didn't necessarily have to do with a ghost/monster until the end, but still had the unmasking and all the clues. Such an aspirational plot definitely made for a great Scooby movie! I didn't mind that the mystery wasn't centered around a monster, and Dick Dastardly and his robots, as well as the looming threat of Cerberus, made good villains.\n\nWith references galore and such a tearjerking plot (especially that ending! I almost cried lol), this is an amazing film that I would definitely recommend as a must-watch for any Scooby fan.\n\nOh, and I've gotta say I liked that Blue Falcon's intro song was DJ Khaled lol. Well, I guess that's it for this review until another one comes out. (Extra points to anyone who gets the terrible pun I just made)"
