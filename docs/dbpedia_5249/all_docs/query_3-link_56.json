        "text": "As the character's adventure unfolds we see that certain arcs are “corrupted” by revenge, greed, or just plain ignorance. We linked the intensity of this descent to the intensity of our yellow look that we developed. I achieved this by mixing back the full look with differing levels of opacity to get peaks and valleys over time. I feel that the use of this device goes a long way in helping set the tone of certain moments. The idea is to be felt but barely perceived.\n\nHDR modulation\n\nEarly in testing, I received a note from the team that the skies were too busy vs what they designed and were used to seeing. I started to explore what was causing this reaction because I liked the look that I had first presented very much. Once I dug in a bit more, I found that due to COVID restrictions most of the approvals were done in SDR. This was the first time the creatives were seeing what was hiding in their data.\n\nYou can see that the trend line shows we used more range as the film progressed. You might think that the curve would correlate to the action scenes, but I noticed while gathering the data for this graph that it was actually coupled to the scenes with the most emotional weight. This was a first for me but I plan on using this technique on other shows going forward. I have always said just cause you have the range doesn’t mean you need to use it. HDR is like salt, a little goes a long way, and too much ruins the dish. I now feel it’s better to approach the extra range like punctuation that enhances key moments. If everything has an exclamation point it sort of loses its meaning.\n\nMastering\n\nWe spent two weeks on the HDR grade. I’m a big proponent of HDR first. It is your highest quality master and the one that will live on past the others. Once we had the HDR P3D65 1000nit master perfect, we moved on to the Dolby SDR trim. This was pretty straightforward except for a couple of scenes. There is a scene early on with a very flared vibe. The Dolby tools were not allowing us to get to where Chris wanted to play it. I was unable to achieve the toe compression in the shadows that I wanted no matter how I trimmed the lift up and gamma down (I call this the gamma shuffle.) Changing the analysis and the L3 mid data didn’t get us there either. We needed to use the higher precision tools found in the color corrector.\n\nBuilding the Look\n\nReelFX was the animation house tasked with bringing “Scoob!” from the boards to the screen. I had previously worked with them on “Rock Dog” so there was a bit of a shorthand already in place. I already had a working understanding of their pipeline and the capabilities of their team. When I came on-board, production was quite far along with the show look. Michael Kurinsky (Production Designer) had already been iterating through versions addressing lighting notes from Tony Cervone (Director) through a LUT that ReelFX had created. This was different from “Smallfoot” where I had been brought on during lighting and helped in the general look creation from a much earlier stage. The color pipeline for “Scoob!” was Linear Arri Wide Gamut EXR files -> Log C Wide Gamut working space ->Show LUT -> sRGB/709. Luckily for me, I would have recommended something very similar. One challenge was the LUT was only a forward transform with no inverse and only built for rec.709 primaries. We needed to recreate this look targeting P3 2.6 and ultimately rec.2020 PQ.\n\nTransform Generation\n\nThose of you that know me, know that I kind of hate LUTs. My preference is to use curves and functional math whenever possible. This is heavier on the GPUs but with today’s crop of ultra-fast processing cards, it hardly matters. So, my first step was to take ReelFX’s LUT and match the transform using curves. I went back and forth with Mike Fortner from ReelFX until we had an acceptable match.\n\nMy next task was to take our new functional forward transform and build an inverse. This is achieved by finding the delta from a 1.0 slope and multiplying that value by a -1. Inverse transforms are very necessary for today’s deliverable climate. For starters, you will often receive graphics, logos, and titles in display referred spaces such as P3 2.6 or rec.709. The inverse show LUT allows you to place these into your working space.\n\nAfter the Inverse was built, I started to work on the additional color spaces I would be asked to deliver. This included the various forward transforms to p3 2.6 for theatrical, rec.2020 limited to P3 with a PQ curve for HDR, and rec.709 for web/marketing needs. I took all of these transforms and baked them into a family DRT. This is a feature in Baselight where the software will automatically use the correct transform based on your output. A lot of work up front, but a huge time saver on the back end; plus less margin for error since it is set programmatically.\n\nTrailers First\n\nThe first piece that I colored with the team were the trailers. This was great since it afforded us the opportunity to start developing workflows that we would use on the feature.\n\nMy friend in the creative marketing world once said to me “I always feel like the trailer is used as the test.” That’s probably because the trailer is the first picture that anybody will see. You need to make sure it’s right before it’s released to the world.\n\nConform\n\nConform is one aspect of the project where we blazed new paths. It’s common to have 50 to 60 versions of a shot as it gets ever more refined and polished through the process. This doesn’t just happen in animation. Live-action shows with lots of VFX (read: photo-real animation) go through this same process.\n\nWe worked with Filmlight to develop a workflow where the version tracking was automated. In the past, you would need an editor to be re-conforming or hand dropping in shots as new versions came in. On “Scoob!”, a database was queried and the correct shot if available was automatically placed in the timeline. Otherwise, if not available, the machine would use the latest version delivered to keep us grading until the final arrives. This saves a huge amount of time (read: money).\n\nGrading\n\nColoring for animation\n\nI often hear, “It’s animation… doesn’t it come to you already correct?” Well, yes and no. What we do in the bay for animation shows is color enhancement; not color correction. Often, we are taking what was rendered and getting it that last mile to where the Director, Production Designer, and Art Director envisioned the image to be.\n\nThese were the primary considerations when coloring “Scoob!” Take what is there and make it work the best it can to promote the story the director is telling. Which takes me to my next tool and technique that was used extensively.\n\nDeep Pixels and Depth Mattes\n\nI’ve always said, if you want to know what we will be doing in color five years from now, look at what VFX is doing today. Five years ago in VFX deep pixels or voxels as they are sometimes referred, was all the rage. Today they are a standard part of any VFX or Animation pipeline. Often they are thrown away because color correctors either couldn’t use them or it was too cumbersome. Filmlight has recently developed tools that allow me to take color grading to a whole other dimension.\n\nI’m super proud of what we were able to accomplish on “Scoob!” using this technique and I can’t wait to see what comes next as this becomes standard for VFX deliveries. A big thank you to ReelFX for being so accommodating to my mad scientist requests.\n\nCorona Time\n\nLuckily, we were done with the theatrical grade before the pandemic hit. Unfortunately, we were far from finished. We were still owed the last stragglers from ReelFX and had yet to start the HDR grade.\n\nRemote Work\n\nWe proceeded to set up a series of remote options. First, we set up a calibrated display at Kurinsky’s house. Next, I upgraded my connection to my home color system to allow for faster upload speeds. A streaming session would have been best but we felt that would put too many folks in close contact since it does take a bit of setup. Instead, I rendered out high-quality Prores XQ files. Kurinsky would then give notes on the reels over Zoom or email. I would make changes, rinse and repeat. For HDR, Kurinsky and I worked off a pair of x300s. One monitor was set for 1000nit rec.2020 PQ and the other for the 100nit 709 Dolby trim pass. I also made H.265 files that would play off a thumb drive once plugged into an LG E-series OLED. Finally, Tony approved the 1.78 pan and scan in the same way.\n\nI’m very impressed with how the whole team managed to not only complete this film but finish it to the highest standards under incredibly trying times. An extra big thank you to my right-hand man Leo Ferrini who was nothing but exceptional during this whole project. Also, my partner in crime, Paul Lavoie, whom I have worked with for over 20 years. Even though he was at home, it felt like he was right there with me. Another big thanks.\n\nCheck Out the Work\n\nCheck out the movie at the link below and tell me what you think."
