        "text": "A new Scooby-Doo movie has already been completed.\n\nEven though it won’t be released.\n\nScoob!: Holiday Haunt’s filming has ended.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA new Scooby-Doo movie has already been completed, even though it won’t be released. Tony Cervone, the film’s writer and producer, announced on Instagram that filming of Scoob!: Holiday Haunt has ended.\n\nIn the post, Cervone uploaded a picture of a computer screen showing the movie’s title card. It has a Christmas-themed background with the words “Scoob!” and “Haunted Holiday” printed in red and green, respectively. The design of the exclamation point incorporates Scooby’s collar. Cervone stated in the article:\n\n“Well, we finished this thing today. A bittersweet conclusion to be sure. I really hope you get a chance to see it somehow. It’s a good one. I want to congratulate the directors @mkurinsky [Michael Kurinsky] and @bill.haller [Bill Haller] for doing an outstanding job. They understand the characters, comedy and spooky thrills so well. Thanks to @dinipaul [Paul Dini] for writing it with me.\n\nThanks to @meferm [Mitchell Ferm] for producing it with me. Thanks to our head of story @duseybear [John Dusenberry] and our Director of Layout @swc90046 [Stephen Childers] and to @terryhan_ [Terry Han] for keeping me somewhat on time. And thank you to our wonderful, wonderful gang – @iain [Iain Armitage], @mckennagraceful [Mckenna Grace], @ariana-greenblatt [Ariana Greenblatt], Pierce Gagnon and the one and only Frank Welker. Every minute with you was a pleasure.”\n\nThe 2020 movie Scoob! was originally planned to have a prequel called Holiday Haunt. It was intended for the movie to debut on HBO Max.\n\nWarner Bros. revealed in August that they had scrapped the project and would never see it through to completion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeslie Grace played the role of Batgirl/Barbara Gordon in the Warner Bros. television series, which also starred J.K. Simmons as Commissioner Gordon and Michael Keaton as Batman.\n\nBoth movies were reportedly cancelled because the studio wanted to concentrate on theatrical releases rather than those made for streaming, according to David Zaslav, the new CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThe films will reportedly be utilised as tax write-offs instead as part of the company’s cost-cutting strategies. Dini tweeted upon the announcement that Scoob!: Holiday Haunt will not be airing, “S—t next’ indeed. Yes, I’m co-writer, but also, why cancel a 95% finished holiday movie this close to Fall, when you’re guaranteed kids watching it from right after Halloween until at least New Years? Makes no business sense esp. as both kids & parents dug the WIP screening.”\n\nDespite the movie being scrapped, Cervone said on Instagram that work was still being done on the score. In the article, Cervone stated: “So what do you do when the movie is canceled, but you’ve already paid for the stage and the musicians? You record the damn score!”\n\nThe 2020 Scoob! movie is presently streaming on HBO Max. You can view the trailer and Cervone’s article below.\n\nAdvertisement"
