        "text": "This week for the Friday 5 I am looking at Scooby Doo movies. It is Halloween time and Scoob and the gang fit that perfectly, plus it’s family friendly. Scooby Doo was a big part of my childhood as it was for many maybe even you. Scooby Doo continues to put out movies that are direct to DVD or streaming and some are really good. Scooby Doo movies have been around since the 1980s and even have been known to do some crossovers with various characters and companies like Batman, Blue Falcon, KISS and the WWE. With so many to choose from it will be hard to narrow it down, and yes both live action and animated are being considered.\n\n5. Scooby-Doo Camp Scare (2010)\n\nThe most recent movie on the list is from 2010 and centres around summer camps and The Woodsman. The movie has great twists and turns and a memorable bad guy. This one also continues the trend of Fred and Daphne not jealousy even though they won’t admit their feelings. This one stands out especially with most modern films.\n\n4. Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2005)\n\nWe got the live action sequel Monsters Unleashed on the list. Some may wonder why not the first one, well it’s because there really many moments I remember like I do from the sequel. Whether it’s the potion experimenting, the Scooby Doo with an afro or the Cotton Candy Ghost scene it just sticks out more.\n\n3. Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf (1988)\n\nFrom the newest to the oldest on the list. The Reluctant Werewolf sees Shaggy as a great racer and when the Wolfman leaves, Dracula transforms Shaggy into a werewolf to have him compete in the annual monster car race. It’s up to his pals to help him win the race and transform back to human form. This one doesn’t feature the whole gang but just Shaggy, Scooby, a one off girlfirend of Shaggy named Googie and the final appearance of Scrappy until the 2002 live action film.\n\n2. Scooby-Doo and the Witch’s Ghost (1999)\n\nThe follow up the beginning of a string of movies that feature real ghosts sees Scooby and the gang travelling to the New England town of Oakhaven after being invited by horror writer Ben Ravencroft, where Ben and the gang discover the ghost of Ben’s relative, who was believed to be a witch is reeking havoc on the town. Lots of twists and turns ensue, which brings the memorable characters of The Hex Girls into the franchise. This one is a can’t miss especially as it comes to Halloween time.\n\n1. Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island (1998)\n\nTaking the top spot is the fan favourite. It also reflects the state of the franchise at the time as the scattered gang reunites to investigate the spooky New Orleans island. There on the pepper plantation, they encounter the pirate ghost of Morgan Moonscar and, much to their surprise, real zombies! This one also can boast a killer soundtrack.\n\n– Everett"
