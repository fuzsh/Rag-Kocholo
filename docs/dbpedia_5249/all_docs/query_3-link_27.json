        "text": "Monthly Archives: April 2013\n\nThe Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius\n\nIncluding the brutally long title, this show had a number of annoying, unrealistic things about it. Most often shortened to Jimmy Neutron, the program was about an 11 year old boy genius and his adventures. Okay, so the title is actually very appropriate and accurate. But it doesn’t leave much up to the imagination. Jimmy […]\n\nChowder\n\nMooselicker says: This is a guest piece written by Erik Hedlund. Is it just me or does that sound like the greatest viking name ever? I really hope if he’s not already, Erik joins a band with friends named Lief and Lars. It won’t matter if they’re any good. Their viking ancestry will sell the […]\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants\n\nEvery so often a quality children’s show will be released to the public. The world will make fun of it, and quickly realize how immensely cool it is. It’s a challenge to make a children’s show fun for adults and kids (and college students that are high) to enjoy, but SpongeBob SquarePants manages to tick […]\n\nAs the Bell Rings\n\nGentleman, remember that size does not matter. It’s what you do with what you have that is important. As the Bell Rings was a 4 minute show that would air throughout the day on Disney Channel from 2007-2009. With only 4 minutes to tell a story, As the Bell Rings had a lot of work […]\n\nPepper Ann\n\nThis piece was written by my good friend Chase Bowman. He doesn’t have a blog of his own (lame). I guess he doesn’t mind living a life where all of his talent is wasted. Or he has one of those job things. Either way, enjoy one of my new favorite Kidz Showz posts. “Pepper Ann, […]\n\n101 Dalmatians\n\nDogs rule. Every child should at some point have a dog. It teaches you to care for another living being. You will learn responsibility and other things adults try to avoid. One dog is fine to have, but trying having 100 more. The Disney film 101 Dalmatians never made it to Smell-O-Vision because of all […]\n\nFlash Forward\n\nMooselicker says: What you are about to read was written by a lady named Jessica MacArthur. She has a blog here where you can bother her if you feel the need to be a lousy human being. Or you can go there and not bother her and simply show some support. I’m not your mother. It’s up […]\n\nWizards of Waverly Place\n\nBefore she was statutorily raping Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez was a simple television star. She made her name on a show about wizards living near New York University so you know there is a lot of pretentiousness in the show. The show was much more than wizards living pointless lives in an overly sensitive environment […]\n\nBraceface\n\nMy brother and I really enjoyed Braceface for a lot of reasons. One reason was that we were at the perfect age to appreciate the embarrassing, yet normal life of Sharon Spitz. Maybe we related to Sharon because her mom, like our mom, was a therapist. Maybe we liked the fact that Sharon’s brother was […]"
