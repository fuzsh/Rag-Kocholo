        "text": "It's astonishing how malleable and long-lasting this franchise has been.\n\nThere's been an awful lot of total shit put out under the brand name, but every so often they'll do something really surprising and interesting, and it's all worth it?\n\nI'd never consider myself much of a fan, but more power to them for continuing to take risks and try new things with it.\n\nLoved watching the old cartoons as Kid, watched Mystery Incorporated for the concept and liked it, but that's pretty much it aside from the straight to vhs films from the 90s. The new guest star show looks neat but not exactly great, but its good that they went back to a more clssic look. Hopefullg they expieriment with that style in another MI style surprise or just let Netflix make MI Season 3 as a reboot/reimagination of Scooby Doo Where are You for the 50th anniversary.\n\n*Checks poll votes*\n\nPeeps thirsty for Thirsty Velma :V\n\nHappy 50th anniversary Scoob and gang. Shoutouts to Frank Welker for his contribution to this series!\n\nProps to Frank Welker for voicing Fred in just about every single one of his appearances for all fifty years. If that's not a record for the longest run voicing a single character by now, I don't know who beats him.\n\nWish they'd take a stab at recasting Shaggy, though. Matthew Lillard's alright, but he's never really nailed Casey Kasem's tone.\n\nAnd while we're talking about great one-off crossovers, let's not forget Bravo Dooby-Doo:\n\nI'll also give a shout out to Scooby-Doo! Team-Up, which is an extended love letter to all things Scooby-Doo, DC, and Hanna-Barbera in general. Every issue feels like proper, authentic Scooby, but it's also jam-packed with in-jokes and shout-outs that only older readers are going to get.\n\nI need to read this comic series. Is it the scooby team up books?\n\nAlso Merlin comes to mind far as GA villains go ;3\n\nProps to Frank Welker for voicing Fred in just about every single one of his appearances for all fifty years.

Every issue feels like proper, authentic Scooby, but it's also jam-packed with in-jokes and shout-outs that only older readers are going to get.\n\nWas that a jab towards Arrow?\n\nDon't forget their best incarnation, yet!\n\nIt really is the best.\n\nYeah I love Scoob and Shag\n\nWait, wait. Was that a gun, Scoob?\n\nYes, keep spreading the good word\n\nI need to read this comic series. Is it the scooby team up books?\n\nYeah.\n\nWas that a jab towards Arrow?\n\nOh, probably. The writer's prods at the fourth wall make use of references spanning decades of material, and Arrow wouldn't even be the most recent thing to come up.\n\nJust the other week me and a friend were talking about all the random scooby movies out there and I somehow got him to watch scooby doo and the reluctant werewolf in all its awfulness.\n\nIn return I found the KISS movie he mentioned on cartoon network and let my mind get filled with fuckery.\n\nFollowing day they aired that WWE racing one where Undertaker and Shaggy are teamed up in some kind of food mobile......\n\nit tickled the wrasslin fan in me, I gotta see the previous one with my man Kane in it.\n\nIt's still one of the most popular shows in the UK for kids believe it or not.\n\nThis is actually what spurred the conversation, my friend childminds a kid who carries the scooby torch into a new generation.\n\nHeck the boomerang channel is like 60% pure scoob\n\nFollowing day they aired that WWE racing one where Undertaker and Shaggy are teamed up in some kind of food mobile......\n\nit tickled the wrasslin fan in me, I gotta see the previous one with my man Kane in it.\n\nThe one with Taker is more fun, the Kane one is kinda standard whereas the latter is pure batshit, Blum as the Bad Guy, HHH goes full Fist of the North Star, Paige gives someone her phone...heh.\n\nThere are callbacks to the first one though.\n\nThis may have been the very first cartoon series I followed as a kid. Love the series, even though as an adult I realise the quality of some the shows was a little poor. Can't believe it's still going strong!\n\nHave there been any good Scooby games?\n\nOh man, how the fuck did I miss this. Time to watch some Scooby stuff this weekend.\n\nScooby Doo was definitely a big part of my childhood, and probably even helped contributed to me loving horror and spooky things in general. Where are You? is a classic, and I got to love the Scooby gang again in recent times with finally seeing Mystery Incorporated and re-watching Zombie Island last year.\n\nAnd Velma is the best of course.\n\nEdit: FUUUUUUUU- they made pops for a few of the villains. I so want the Space Kook one.\n\nIt's still one of the most popular shows in the UK for kids believe it or not.\n\nThe 2 live action DTVs and Mystery Incorporated were huge Cartoon Network ratings but halfway into S1 they decided to start sabotaging the schedule because it wasn't the comedy crap they wanted to focus on.\n\nAfter that ended they made Cartoon Network exactly the type of Scooby Doo series they wanted(pure comedy)\n\nand then sabotaged it before it even launched.\n\nThe newest series was going to bypass Cartoon Network entirely but after it was already in production and such CN wanted back in."
