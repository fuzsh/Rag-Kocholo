        "text": "I recently saw this episode on Nick Jr and I really want to discuss it! Here are some facts to get you informed:\n\n- Pup-Fu! is the only title in the entire series that carries an exclamation mark.\n\n- Pup-Fu! Is also the shortest title up to date.\n\n- In this episode, Foggy Bottom is introduced for the first time.\n\n- This episode is the first time Marshall successfully performed a tailspin without crashing (It took ya an entire season!)\n\n- Rocky's pup-fu uniform is the only one to include a pup-pack.\n\n- Mayor Humdinger's line \"Drat you Ryder and your meddling pups!\" is similar to the classic line from Scooby-Doo. (and possibly a reference)\n\n- The Hen-kido headbands worn by Mayor Goodway and Chickaletta are blurred in KBS Kids broadcasts and are fully whitened in Nickelodeon South Koreabroadcasts due to its resemblance to the Japanese Army flag. (Thank you Wikia)\n\nI would like to say that I loved this episode! Learning about Marshall arts (heh see what I did there) is an absolutely original idea!\n\nFor once in this episode, Mayor Humdinger actually acted like a real villain. Watch episodes like Pups Save a Ferris Wheel and you'll think he's become a victim of identity theft.\n\nAlso, this episode actually gave me the feeling of a real action/spy movie. The chase after Humdinger, the mystery, it was just amazing.\n\nOn the downside, I want to say that Marshall got a bit too much screen time. Some of them only had 2-3 lines the entire ep! I know these 'longer' episodes usually work on character developpment, but that 'quiet as a mouse' catchphrase starts to get annoying after saying it nine times (Yes, I counted!)\n\nOverall, decent episode! It's Season 2 Episode 19 on KissCartoon or Netflix. If you haven't watched it yet, I strongly advise that you do so right now. Until next time! ~Rocky"
