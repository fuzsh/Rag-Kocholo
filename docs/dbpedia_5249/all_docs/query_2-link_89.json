        "text": "2002’s Scooby-Doo is definitely one of the standout movies of my childhood, maybe one of the top 10 in my life.\n\nThe costumes were on point, the plot was unique, and on top of all that the casting was jam-packed with ’90s and ’00s movie icons like Matthew Lillard, Freddie Prince Jr, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Linda Cardellini and Australia’s very own, Isla Fisher.\n\nFor those who haven’t been blessed by this movie, the plot follows Mystery Inc. on one more adventure after they breakup due to strained relationships behind-the-scenes. The crew end up on Spooky Island (which is Queensland btw!) and have to work together to catch the monster(s) terrorising the tourists. Along the way, you’re introduced to a bunch of groovy characters that you’ll grow to adore.\n\nThe Scooby-Doo movie also got a sequel in 2004, titled Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, which is also an awesome watch!\n\nOne of my favourite moments in the original film is definitely the clever inside jokes and dialogue the writers came up with. While the movie is enjoyable for people at any age, it was delight rewatching the movie as I got older, discovering hidden jokes I wouldn’t have understood as a kid.\n\nSo I’ve plucked some of the best and most unforgettable quotes from Scooby-Doo! Enjoy!\n\n1. Velma: “I know you. All you care about are swimsuit models.”\n\nFred: “Look, I’m a man of substance. Dorky chicks like you turn me on, too.”\n\nWhat I love about 2002’s Scooby Doo is that I was way too young to enjoy these jokes, but this scene absolutely cracks me up. Like Fred is really trying to do the most to impress Velma and I’m glad he’s trying to be a good friend, but boy oh boy, did he add more fuel to the fire with this one.\n\n2. Scooby-Doo: “With Hot Sauce, RACHACHACHACHA!”\n\nThis is just an iconic moment when Scoob and Shaggy were low-key hot-boxing the Mystery Inc. van. Also they make this chocolate eggplant hot sauce burger look delicious, even though I wouldn’t touch that in my life.\n\n3. Shaggy: “We don’t go anywhere with ‘scary’, ‘spooky’, ‘haunted’, or ‘forbidden’ in the title.”\n\nScooby-Doo: “Or hydrocolonic.”\n\nShaggy: “Right, or hydrocolonic, but that’s for a whole different reason, man.”\n\nAgain, I was way too young to understand jokes in this film but this one just cracks me way up now that I’m a lot older. I love how this one just kinda slips in there.\n\n4. Daphne: “What do you mean I can’t have seven carry-on bags? That’s like, so economy.”\n\nI love the sass that Daphne has in this scene, it’s just so her. It’s definitely one of the moments in Scooby-Doo that we get cartoon Daphne Blake, as the live-action version is completely different to the classic one. Also she’s just so iconic that even her luggage matches her ‘fit.\n\n5. Mary Jane: “I’m Mary Jane.”\n\nShaggy: “Like, that’s my favourite name.”\n\nHehehe iykyk. When I discovered the joke behind this scene, the movie just got 100% more funnier.\n\n6. Mondavarious: “I can be pretty spooky when called upon, I can go rawr, rawr, claws, rawrrawrrawr.”\n\nWe love a good moment when a character does a ‘rawr’ in the scene! I also never realised that Mr Bean was in this movie, but his little “rawr xD” was adorable.\n\n7. Possessed College Kid: “Back off my grill, son!”\n\nUgh, these days I wish I could do this IRL to guys that annoy the hell outta me but as a kid this interaction really caught me off guard. (AND QUICK SPOILER!!!) Obviously, she was possessed by the monster creature things, but it’s just the random slang that cracks me up.\n\n8. Voodoo Maestro: “Here’s a clue: Purple is a fall colour. IT’S THE MIDDLE OF MAY.”\n\nI really wished that there were more scenes between Daphne and the Voodoo Maestro because their whole interaction is unforgettable. He did not need to read Daphne’s outfit to filth!!!\n\n9. Velma: “My glasses!”\n\nI had to chuck this one in for nostalgia’s sake. OFC she looses her glasses at the most important part of the movie and it’s just an iconic line for our fave crime-solving brain, Velma.\n\n10. Shaggy: “This is like the opposite of what I wanted to do today.”\n\nShaggy just says what we’re all thinking in times of stress.\n\n11. Daphne: “Now who’s the damsel in distress?”\n\nThis is one of the best moments in the film, as we see a massive character development in Daphne, who is no longer the girl who gets captured. Also this fight scene is so iconic!"
