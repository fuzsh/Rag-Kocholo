        "text": "My childhood was filled with so many amazing cartoons, from hilarious Spongebob Squarepants episodes to Codename: Kids Next Door. But, one staple that I always watched in my house was Scooby-Doo, a classic mystery dating back to the 1960s, something that both me and my parents could enjoy.\n\nFrom Scooby-Doo, there came tons of animated films, and live-action ones as well, further expanding the series. Today, I’m going to tell you the best Scooby-Doo movies to watch streaming right now, from some of the oldest ones out there to some newer movies.\n\nScooby-Doo and Scooby-Doo 2 (2002, 2004)\n\nThe live-action version of Scooby-Doo follows the Mystery Incorporated gang, who reunite after a two-year disbandment, to investigate a mystery at a popular horror-themed tropical resort, where strange happenings have been occurring.\n\nLook, I’ll be honest - there aren’t that many live-action versions of Scooby-Doo for a reason. It’s hard to really capture the style and mysteries of the series properly through a live-action lens, but I do think that the original live-action Scooby-Doo has its moments where it shines. I love the Scooby-Doo cast, especially Matthew Lillard’s Shaggy, but I also have to give praise to everyone else - Linda Cardellini, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Freddie Prince Jr., all of them really rocked it. Plus, I actually like the humor. Maybe I have low taste, but come on - Shaggy’s love interest’s name was Mary Jane? Shaggy always gets the munchies? That’s hilarious to me.\n\nThe second one isn’t as funny as the first, but I still think the cast was fun and it had plenty of enjoyable moments, and anyone could enjoy it if they’re a fan of Scooby-Doo.\n\nRent/Buy Scooby-Doo on Amazon.Rent/Buy Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed on Amazon.\n\nScooby-Doo And The Cyber Chase (2001)\n\nIn this animated film, Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase follows the gang when they visit a friend working at a university where a mysterious virus has broken free from the confines of its video game and wreaked havoc on the campus. But, when they are chasing down the monster, they suddenly become part of the game too.\n\nI love Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase for one simple reason - the very idea of getting beamed into a video game is freaking cool. I mean, we have all these awesome video game movies but no one ever talks about how awesome the idea of being in a game is. The gang has to fight through several levels against this virus to somehow come out on top, with interesting levels and different monsters, all capped off with a throwback to their original outfits at the end of the game - it’s so much fun.\n\nStream Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase on Boomerang.\n\nScooby-Doo And The Reluctant Werewolf (1988)\n\nIn this animated TV film, Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf follows Shaggy, Scooby, and Scrappy-Doo as Shaggy is turned into a werewolf. It’s up to Scooby, Scrappy, and Shaggy’s girlfriend to win a road-racing contest featuring classic monsters, such as Frankenstein and Dracula.\n\nThis is the oldest Scooby-Doo film on this list, and you can definitely tell from watching it. The regular gang that you'd see isn’t here, and there are a lot of elements that most Scooby-Doo movies don’t use that often (like Shaggy having a girlfriend, the inclusion of Scrappy-Doo, etc.). But, Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf has a lot of charm to it, mainly because it’s old and it’s always enjoyable to watch a film that focuses on Shaggy and Scooby.\n\nStream Scooby Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf on Boomerang through Amazon.\n\nScooby Doo! Legend Of The Phantosaur (2011)\n\nIn Scooby Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur, Shaggy actually discovers that he has a disorder that makes him overreact to things with fear, causing Mystery Inc. to break up, but he is given the chance to change this when he is hypnotized by a professor. However, even if Shaggy finds a way to overcome his fear, there is far more behind this doctor than anyone thought there was.\n\nEvery time I’ve seen Scooby Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur, I can’t help but laugh. While it’s a very original idea, this movie is really where that meme of Shaggy using all his “power” continued. It was in the live-action movies, but also continued in this where Shaggy can literally beat people up. His character in this movie makes it so much fun to watch, and it really is one of the underappreciated movies in the franchise.\n\nStream Scooby Doo! and the Legend of the Phantosaur on HBO Max.\n\nScooby-Doo On Zombie Island (1998)\n\nIn Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island, the gang, who had separated before from exhaustion of always just discovering crooks under masks, goes to New Orleans together to an island, only to discover that there are actual supernatural monsters - which turn people into zombies.\n\nMany fans of the series often credit this as a new era for Scooby-Doo films, because it’s one of the few that actually include \"real\" supernatural creatures instead of just someone behind a mask trying to cause trouble. What I really like about Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island is that it’s a lot darker than other Scooby-Doo films, and features plenty of zombie designs alongside a really fun story. Look, I’m the girl who loved The Walking Dead and its emotional finale -- how could I not love Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island? It’s the perfect spooky fest.\n\nStream Scooby Doo on Zombie Island on Boomerang.\n\nTrick Or Treat Scooby Doo! (2022)\n\nIn this Halloween fun-filled Scooby Doo movie, Trick or Treat Scooby Doo! follows the gang when they travel to a ski resort to uncover a villain, only to find out that it has a connection to every other villain that they have faced – a Halloween costume designer named Coco Diablo, which turns their world upside down.\n\nThis is one of the newest films out there, and honestly, I really enjoyed it. I think it’s a great film for people specifically that grew up on the show because there are some references to past movies or episodes with other villains, but it’s also just a fun story all-together. Plus, it also gives some great LGBTQ+ representation involving Velma – and I think it’s done really well. Just don’t check out the 2023 Velma show – stick to this version of Velma. Please.\n\nStream Trick or Treat Scooby Doo! on HBO Max.\n\nScooby-Doo! and the Goblin King (2008)\n\nIn Scooby-Doo! and the Goblin King, Scoob and Shaggy have to go into the underground, ruled by the Goblin King, in order to stop a mortal named The Amazing Krudsky, who wants powers and is threatening their friends, Fred, Daphne, and Velma.\n\nWhile this film doesn’t feature the gang as a whole that much, I like it for two reasons. One, it’s another Scooby-Doo film that features actual monsters instead of criminals, and two, it takes place during Halloween, my favorite time of year. A lot of Scooby-Doo movies don’t actually take place during the spookiest season, so that added aesthetic to the already-creepy yet fun series that is Scooby-Doo makes this such an enjoyable film to watch. Plus, it features Tim Curry - how can you not like him?\n\nStream Scooby Doo! and the Goblin King on Boomerang.\n\nScooby-Doo! Camp Scare (2010)\n\nScooby-Doo! Camp Scare follows the gang as they travel to Camp Little Mouse, Fred’s old summer camp, to serve as camp counselors. But, when they arrive and see that the camp is empty except for the head counselor and the Forest Ranger due to a camp legend becoming real, it’s up to them to figure out how to stop it.\n\nI know, this sounds an awful lot like the Friday the 13th franchise but without the blood and gore. To be honest, Scooby-Doo! Camp Scare offers that same thrill of a crazy person running around scaring people without it becoming a horror film. The mystery is fun to follow along and see who might be the person causing trouble, and the camp atmosphere makes it even better. Who knows - you might get attacked by the Woodsman next.\n\nStream Scooby Doo! Camp Scare on Boomerang.\n\nStraight Outta Nowhere: Scooby Doo! Meets Courage The Cowardly Dog (2021)\n\nMy childhood has come together. In Straight Outta Nowhere: Scooby Doo! Meets Courage the Cowardly Dog, the gang finds themselves in the middle of Nowhere when both Courage and Scooby are driven to dance away from their families due to a strange sound they hear, and there, they end up solving the mystery of a lifetime – with the most courageous, cowardly dog.\n\nThis movie is literally everything and more. While Courage the Cowardly Dog had plenty of nightmare fuel that truly showed dark scenes for a children’s show, it was one I watched a lot of, and so was Scooby Doo. Seeing these two come together for one movie, just to see them all together on the same screen, is something I will never take for granted, and I really love.\n\nStream Straight Outta Nowhere: Scooby Doo! Meets Courage the Cowardly Dog on HBO Max.\n\nScooby-Doo! And The Monster Of Mexico (2003)\n\nIn Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico, the gang decides to travel to Mexico when Fred’s pen-pal, Alejo Otero, invites him to visit him and his family there. After he sends the invitation, a big, long-haired monster begins to terrify the man’s town, called “El Chupacabra.” Now, the gang needs to find out who’s behind this mess, and take down the monster.\n\nAs a young, Hispanic girl, I loved this film for the setting and the amazing food that I was jealous that Shaggy and Scooby got to eat. As an adult, I can appreciate Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico for its twists, mystery, and everything else involved. Plus, I also love that the film ends with El Dia de los Muertos, otherwise known as The Day of the Dead, and all the traditions that it follows.\n\nIt may be a kid’s film, but the movie actually teaches a lot about Mexican culture and how beautiful it is, from its urban legends to the celebrations - and the delicious food.\n\nStream Scooby Doo! and the Monster of Mexico on Boomerang.\n\nScooby-Doo! And The Legend Of The Vampire (2003)\n\nIn Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire, the gang have arrived in Australia for a vacation, deciding to attend a music festival at Vampire Rock. Soon, when performers are attacked by a supposed vampire and are kidnapped, it causes many to fear coming to the music festival. Now, the gang must band together to discover who is behind the kidnappings, and if the vampire is real.\n\nScooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire is not like the other films that came before it. It’s certainly a lot lighter in tone, and even the visuals and the setting seem to follow that trend. But, it’s still an enjoyable mystery with some awesome costumes for the animated characters, and the music is ear-worm worthy.\n\nStream Scooby Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire on Boomerang.\n\nScooby-Doo! And The Witch's Ghost (1999)\n\nIn this animated film, Scooby-Doo! and the Witch’s Ghost follows the gang as they travel up to Massachusetts to visit the hometown of a famous mystery author. When they arrive, however, they find that the townspeople have been terrorized by the local ghost, a young woman named Sarah Ravencroft who was falsely accused of witchcraft back in the 1600s. Now, it’s up to them to figure out what is happening and how to stop the ghost from terrorizing the folks there.\n\nHands down, this is my favorite Scooby-Doo film. Not only does it match the aesthetic of Scooby-Doo perfectly, with this small town during the fall, and plenty of spooky moments, but it again features supernatural creatures that are not only creepy, but actually life-threatening in a lot of situations. Plus, Tim Curry again is featured in this one, and he is fantastic. His character is one of the best in this film.\n\nI won’t give away much if you haven’t seen it, but since October is coming up soon, this is definitely the film to watch to get excited for the spooky season.\n\nStream Scooby Doo! and the Witch’s Ghost on Boomerang."
