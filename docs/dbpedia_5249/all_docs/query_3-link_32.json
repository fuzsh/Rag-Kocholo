        "text": "Today I have an interview with Alex White about A Cool and Lonely Courage, which is currently on Kickstarter! This game is about women in occupied France in World War II and I asked Alex about the research involved. Read on to see more!\n\n—\n\nTell me a little about A Cool and Lonely Courage. What excites you about it?\n\nLast summer I was discussing the role of women in World War II with a friend, thinking about the courage which they had displayed and the encouragement that can give to us today. The next evening on the flight home I remembered a museum exhibit I had come across once about the women who worked as spies in occupied France, and the germ of an idea for the game formed – I’ve still got the half page of scribbled notes which are the underpinnings of the game even now! I wanted to design a game with simple rules that would allow us to tell emotionally complex stories.\n\nI followed this up by several weeks research into the women who served as part of the Special Operations Executive and I was rocked back on my heels by their history. They came from all kinds of backgrounds and faced incredible peril. A third of them were captured, tortured and executed, but they performed a vital role in the liberation of France. The photo below shows Violette Szabo, Noor Inayat Khan, Nancy Wake and Odette Sansom.\n\nI decided that I wanted the game to remember and honour the women who had faced such dangers. I’ve put as much history as I can as examples into the rules and made every effort to help the players understand the kind of circumstances these real women found themselves in. I’ve been delighted that many people have said afterwards that they want to find out more about these spies, and I’ve included a book and film bibliography in the rules to help people find our more.\n\nThe central mechanism of the game reflects the fates of war, and gives a tremendous replay value to it. Every time that someone plays, very different stories will result. Because the game is interested primarily in the relationships these women had with the people around them, and tracks the changing relationships during their time, it has the capability to be very emotionally engaging – even shocking. As one player, new to story games, said during a recent session “I can’t believe that I’m crying over someone that we just made up in the last hour”.\n\nThat’s a long response to a short question! But in a nutshell I’m excited about the capacity of this game to give the players genuine emotional experiences and a new respect for the women who did this for real.\n\nYou mentioned your research. What kind of research did you do? How did you find the right sources?\n\nWhen it comes to research, happily there are many books available! Historians have done all the hard work in research or working as biographers. I started by looking at some authors who have covered a number of the women who worked with the SOE such as Rick Stroud who wrote ‘Lonely Courage’ or Beryl E. Escort who wrote ‘The heroines of SOE: F Section: Britains secret women in France’. I followed this up with more in depth biographies of women such as Pearl Witherington and Nancy Wake.\n\nI supplemented this real life history by looking into some of the fiction based on these activities. I really enjoyed the young adult novel ‘Codename Verity’ by Elizabeth Wein, and I was able to obtain a 1988 TV series called ‘Wish me luck’ by Lavinia Warner and Jill Hyem.\n\nA friend of mine is an amateur historian of World War II and he was able to give me a lot of additional context about the situation in occupied France too.\n\nDid you reach out to the families of the women who you based the game on, whose likenesses you’re using, to gain their perspective or permission?\n\nNo, I didn’t attempt to reach out to any of the families – None of the public resources I had available referred to any family members much, and trying to track them down would have felt too stalker-y.\n\nWhat happens in play of A Cool and Lonely Courage? What do players do, and what are their hard questions?\n\nWhen it comes to playing A Cool and Lonely Courage, it goes like this:\n\nThere are a series of questions which each player answers to develop an initial view of their character – their background, how they speak french, the reason they joined up, a strength discovered during training and a weakness revealed by training. Whether they were going to be primarily a courier or a radio operator. Their code name, and the name of the circuit leader they would be working with in France (who is their first supporting character).\n\nAs the play starts, the players have to picture themselves in neighbouring cells, captured by the Nazis. They briefly introduce themselves, and they start telling each other their stories…\n\nEach player is dealt a hand of 6 cards, held face down.\n\nThere are going to be five chapters, and in each chapter every player will have a scene. The chapters are arrival (meeting the resistance), a mission with the resistance, an interlude which is a period of quiet and getting to know people, the chapter where you are captured, and a final chapter in prison.\n\nAs each player is going to have a scene they draw one of their cards, and the suit determines whether the focus of the scene is one of love, success, misfortune or death. The scenes will involve one or more supporting characters, adding to a selection in front of each player or reusing existing ones in later scenes. Other players take the role of the supporting characters in the scene.\n\nAs the chapters progress it will be natural to revisit some of the supporting characters and depending upon the fall of the cards you will see relationships grow, deepen, fracture or sometimes be tragically ended by death. Through playing out the scenes there is a real sense of personality in the supporting characters… and when a spade is drawn and the players set a scene where a lovely person has to die… that can feel really tough – but true to the sense of the wartime story that is being told.\n\nThe conclusion is a real point of decision. Everyone has one card left. They then secretly decide whether to keep that card for themselves or donate it to another player. When these decisions are revealed, anyone with two cards is rescued! Anyone with no cards is killed out of hand. Anyone with one card is sent to the concentration camps and if your card is black you die there, if it is red you survive.\n\nFinally, in the epilogue, the players think about what happened next to the survivors after the war. And who remembers those who died.\n\nIt is sometimes a little quiet at the conclusion of the game, as we think about the stories that have been told, and perhaps reflect upon the real women who the game is based upon.\n\nHow do you support players who might find this kind of play overwhelming or upsetting once they’ve jumped into it?\n\nOne of the things that has always been important when running the game is that everyone knows that there is an open door policy – anyone can excuse themselves for the game for any reason. They might want a break, or they might feel that they have to exit the game entirely. It is important that people know that this is an option at the start of the game, and that if during the game someone feels they have to step out it is important for the rest of the table to reassure them that is perfectly fine, and it won’t ‘spoil the game’ for anyone else.\n\nI’ve seen this used twice, once in a game that I was facilitating and once in a game a different person was facilitating. In each case it was easy to reassure the person that was fine, and they left with no worries that it would impair anyone else’s fun.\n\nOccasionally someone finds one particular thing that is brought up somewhat upsetting, and the game rules discuss right up front using Ron Edwards “lines and veils” or John Stavropoulos “X-card” mechanics to help avoid troublesome areas up front or during play.\n\nHow do you feel sometimes knowing the end of the story can affect play and the experience of the game?\n\nI think that knowing the end of the story actually plays really well. Although it may not be fashionable, I really loved the movie Titanic. We all know the ship sank, but it was interesting to see the stories leading up to that point. Indeed, it lent a bitter-sweet aspect to some of the stories. The same holds true in A Cool and Lonely Courage.\n\nKnowing that these stories end in capture can make the sense of small moments of joy or victory shine like candles in the darkness. And of course, the very end of the story isn’t known. You know that you are all in prison, but there is the question about what you do with your final card… to keep it or to give it away, once you know everyone else’s stories. The final end of each character isn’t known until the epilogue!\n\n—\n\nThanks so much to Alex for the interview! I hope you all enjoyed it and that you’ll check out A Cool and Lonely Courage on Kickstarter today!\n\nNote: As required by my standards, you’ll note that I asked Alex about whether he reached out to the families of any of those he’s writing this game based on. I understand Alex’s perspective, but as I have spoken of before, I care about whose stories we tell, so I wanted to ask to get that perspective.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nToday I’ve got an interview with Toby Strauss on the new game Jinkies! Jinkies! is currently on Kickstarter and is very Scooby-inspired, so I’m excited! I hope you like what Toby has to say below.\n\n—\n\nTell me a little about Jinkies! What excites you about it?\n\nFirst off, I was beside myself with happiness when you spelled Jinkies! with the exclamation point. During my research, I was amused that the original 1969 “Scooby Doo, Where are You!” used an exclamation point, and not a question mark, on the title card. Isn’t that odd? But I love it. There’s a certain energy to the (incorrect) punctuation that I find kitschy and charming. I couldn’t not use it for the game.\n\nJinkies! is a powered by the apocalypse adventure game based on the Hannah-Barbara cartoons from around 50 years ago. If you’ve ever seen Scooby Doo, Josie and the Pussycats, Jabberjaw, or Dune Buggy, you’re on the right track. Like Monsterhearts or Dungeon World, the players can choose from playbooks based on the archetypes from the shows. These characters go on adventures, unmasking bad guys and ne’er do wells pretending to be nefarious monsters.\n\nOne of the things that I’m especially excited about is how Jinkies! handles clues. Visual clues and puzzles are really hard to do right in tabletop RPGs. Most of the time, the GM drops the “path critical” clues in the laps of the players just to move things along. I really puzzled over how to handle clues until I realized something important: Hannah Barbara cartoons aren’t about the mystery. The mystery is just a setting. The cartoons are really about the adventure, the creepy suspect, and the wacky gang. Jinkies! approaches clues with the mindset that it is the adventure, not the clue, that’s important. This means that the bad guy for a given module can change from playthrough to playthrough, but I think that’s ok. This is why I used PbtA for my mechanics. Players and GMs in Jinkies! are just playing to find out.\n\nAnother thing that I love about Jinkies! is that there is no combat in the game. Interestingly, combat was in the very first draft of the game . . . and it was a disaster. The playtesters overwhelmingly rejected it; the genre is nonviolent by design and combat just didn’t feel right. Instead of swords and hitpoints, Jinkies! turns on scares and “fear” points. Its a great system that makes the world feel scary and dangerous without misplaced violence. I’m proud of how it turned out!\n\nHow do the mechanics work to result in scares and fear points, and what do those do?\n\nIf you watch one of the old Hannah-Barbara mystery cartoons, you’ll notice that no one gets hurt. Instead, there’s a sort of asymmetrical nonviolence between the protagonists and the antagonist. The protagonists act through ensnarement and logic–capture the bad guy and explain the crime. The antagonist acts through fear–if the kids are scared enough, they’ll run away and let the bad guy finish his misdeeds.\n\nI tried to mirror this in Jinkies! The player characters “assault” the bad guy by 1) finding clues, and 2) setting and triggering a trap for the bad guy. They cannot inflict fear points on the bad guy, but the bad guy can inflict fear on the player characters.\n\nFear works a lot like HP, but it is only inflicted by the bad guy, and it leads to fainting from fear, not physical harm. So let’s say the ghost pirate flies right through Joe the Leader. That’s pretty scary! Joe takes a point of fear.\n\nThere are a number of ways that fear can be mitigated. Several playbooks have the ability to avoid taking earned fear points (“Joe, using his inner strength, shrugs off the ghostly attack!”). The “weird one” playbook (think Shaggy from Scooby Doo) not only gets fear mitigation, he can use fear to fuel unique abilities. The weird one in these shows is always afraid–I couldn’t help but give him fear fueled powers!\n\nWhen it all comes together, its a surprisingly seamless experience. No one seems to miss combat and the asymmetrical nature of the game is almost invisible when the game is played.\n\nWhat was playtesting like for this game, with the elements of it being so cartoonish?\n\nA lot of my inspirations are obscure and probably unknown to many of my players–but almost everyone has seen something with Scooby Doo in it. The original cartoon aired way back in 1969 and there have been dozens of spin-offs, movies, and sequels–not to mention the lasting power of syndication. That ubiquity has made Jinkies! accessible to almost everyone who has played the game. The vast majority of my play testers have very naturally leaned into the cartoony roots of Jinkies! with little prompting.\n\nI can only think of a single play test where the game didn’t feel like a cartoon. The players decided play the game really straight. They even decided that their animal mascot was not magical and could not talk! It felt like Dragnet, or maybe a Nancy Drew mystery. It wasn’t a bad experience, but it also wasn’t a funny one.\n\nThat play test was early in my process and I did a bit of soul searching to try and figure out how to “fix” what had gone wrong. It just didn’t feel right. In the end, though, I didn’t change very much. Most people who sign up to play Jinkies! are looking for a light-hearted, cartoony mystery adventure. My game isn’t going to be all things to all people, and that’s ok. Better to focus on making it the best at what it is!\n\nHow are you changing PbtA fundamentals to suit the different tone and themes, like rewriting basic moves and so on?\n\nInteresting questions!\n\nIf a player came to Jinkies! from another PbtA game they would find the mechanics familiar. Jinkies! is still very much a “play to find out” game. There are basic moves, playbook moves, and animator moves. Jinkies! uses 2D6 for its randomizer. Very PbtA in the fundamentals.\n\nI diverge pretty heavily in the moves themselves. PbtA was developed for a very blood-thirsty setting, after all–and Jinkies! is based on a family-friendly cartoon! I excised ALL combat moves and added heavily to the investigative moves. I also changed the Animator moves, hewing closer to the genre than Apocalypse World moves could.\n\nI also break with most PbtA on principles. One of the guiding principles of Dungeon World, for example, is “think dangerously.” The world of Jinkies! is sometimes scary, but it is never dangerous. I’ve rewritten the principle as “think comedically.” Another principle I changed is saying your moves out loud. This is a big no-no in most PbtA games but I actively encourage it. The Hannah-Barbara formula practically requires naming your moves. When Velma tosses Scooby a treat, she doesn’t just give him a knowing nod, she inquires “will you do the task for a Scooby Snack?” Scooby snack, in this case, is TOTALLY a move, and the verbal component is a very important (and cartoony) part of creating the feel the game is after.\n\nWhat are you doing in regards to guiding table content safety, since there’s a lot of ways this could go a little gonzo or maybe just hit an unseen button of discomfort?\n\nTo the safety question: every RPG carries risks (bleed, content and trauma triggers, etc). Jinkies! is no different. In fact, I would argue that the risks of things going sideways are greater in Jinkies! than in D&D. First, it’s a comedy game. Comedy is, by definition, transgressive–and those transgressions can cut in surprisingly deep ways. Second, there is a certain subtext to the “teenagers with a wacky sidekick solving mysteries” genre that is off-color. The “Shaggy Busted” episode of “Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law” does a great job of poking fun at this subtext, if any of your readers are curious. Its fun and its funny, but it is also emotionally dangerous waters.\n\nI’ve attempted to have my cake and eat it too by baking in two presets for content control, “normal” and “Behind the Music.” I certainly don’t object to sex or drugs being in the game–so long as everyone at the table is comfortable with it. This way the players must actively choose the “blue” version of the game, and it prompts a lines and veils-type conversation.\n\nSecond, I recommend the use of an X card system. Even in a game where boundaries have been drawn ahead of time, things can get messy fast. I find that X cards are indispensable safety tools. Finally, I explicitly instruct against gameplay that I find to be irredeemably offensive, like racism or misogyny. For example, a common trope in 1970s Hannah Barbara cartoons is the villain kidnapping a woman. This is lazy storytelling, its sexist, and it makes the game suck for the player who has been removed from gameplay. Bigotry has no place at my table or in my game.\n\n—\n\nThanks so much to Toby for the great interview! I hope you all enjoyed the interview and that you’ll check out Jinkies! on Kickstarter today!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
