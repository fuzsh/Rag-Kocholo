        "text": "Home\n\nEpisode 130: The Cat Doesn’t Have Our Tongue\n\nEpisode 130: Cats Don’t Have Our Tongue is obvious when you listen as . . . we have a lot to say about cats and deliver a CATastrophic amount of poems about the cats you posted on the WPL Facebook page. Cat-lovers and poetry-lovers everywhere, unite! And . . . please listen.\n\nEpisode 129: Poetry in the Wild\n\nEpisode 129: Poetry in the Wild begins in a gas station where we ponder the Little Debbie Red Velvet Creme Filled Cakes that we aren’t supposed to eat though the alliteration of “Little Debbie can destroy your diet” is very appealing to us, and it ends with a note about tomatoes to Billy that is poetry of the best wild kind. Bunch of other stuff in between, too. LISTEN!\n\nEpisode 128: Poetry at the Post Office & Vet Clinic\n\nEpisode 127: Prediction Machines, Bigfoot & a Hip Campus\n\nEpisode 127: Prediction Machines, Bigfoot & a Hip Campus discusses the brain, the mind, memory and perception and a bunch of things that have to do with our noggins. Oh, and some Emily Dickinson in there, of course. Bill and Shaun are joined by Bill’s great-nephew Evan, who is very good at cutting through the nonsense. Brain jokes and sketchy knowledge of a variety of things ensue. NOTE: JW Ocker is the author of The United States of Cryptids, mentioned in the podcast.\n\nEpisode 126: Down the Dirt Roads\n\nEpisode 126: Down the Dirt Roads is a different kind of WPL episode, as Bill is out of town, and Shaun welcomes Faith Phillips, author of a book that will be the first one in the poetry museum’s fall CRIME, SHE SAID book club. We discuss growing up and walking down the dirt roads in Oklahoma and a true crime case here that she wrote the book Now I Lay Me Down about. The book will soon be a multi-episode true crime documentary.\n\nBook Club Info: CRIME, SHE SAID\n\nEpisode 125: Swept Away in a Sweeping Sweep\n\nEpisode 125: Swept Away in a Sweeping Sweep takes you on a journey through three poems recently left in the museum. Discussions about the muses, the sport of curling, line graphs, and more ensure.\n\nEpisode 124: The Cryptids are Coming!\n\nEpisode 124: The Cryptids are Coming! Rot-ro! It’s true, Scooby Doo, the 2025 exhibit at the Rural Oklahoma Museum of Poetry will be about cryptids, the hidden creatures of our imagination, folklore . . . and occasionally, real life! Shaun and Bill discuss Bigfoot, Chuck Norris (not a cryptid . . . or . . . hmm) and more in this episode.\n\nEpisode 123: On Not Vegetating in an Earth Corner\n\nEpisode 122: Closets I Have Known\n\nEpisode 122: Closets I Have Known is certainly about closets. Would we steer you wrong? Sweep you away? Lock you in? It’s also about brooms and witches. And brooms. Sweep. Sweep. Sweep. Poetry and bad jokes, of course, abound.\n\nEpisode 121: Responding to Advice with Horse\n\nEpisode 120: The Magical Petri Dish\n\nEpisode 119: The Mystery of the Second Person\n\nEpisode 118: Cardi B Poetry isn’t about her, but it’s a shameless attempt to get people to this website to listen to 30-frickin’ minutes of high-class entertainment about cards, not WAP. Yep, you read that right: CARDS. GREETING CARDS. It’s something people used to do. And verse ensued and some poetry, too . . . sometimes, not too often . . . but here and there.\n\nEpisode 117: What the Nose Knows\n\nEpisode 116: Bony Sodden Hulk\n\nEpisode 115: Bring on the Belly Laughs\n\nEpisode 114: Poetry Out Loud & Zesty\n\nEpisode 113: Boldly Fruity Acts of Barbarism\n\nEpisode 112: Message in a Bottle to Jupiter\n\nEpisode 111: Purrfectly Familiar\n\nEpisode 110: Make Art and Eat Cereal\n\nEpisode 109: Feeding Two Birds with One Scone\n\nEpisode 108: Potpourri for $200, Alex\n\nEpisode 107: The Voluptuous Texture of Spells\n\nEpisode 106: Barbie Boxed In\n\nEpisode 106: Barbie Boxed In delves into the shadow box art tradition, particularly those created by artist and podcast co-host Bill Guthrie for the Rural Oklahoma Museum of Poetry’s current exhibit Her Kind: The Witch in History, Popular Culture & Poetry. We chant about ekphrastic poetry and Barbie dolls, sailors and avatars and so much more.

What would Burt Lancaster of the 1968 film “The Swimmer,” based on the sublime story by John Cheever, do in a situation? Or, in other words, what would a group of folks who gathered to celebrate Yevgeny Yevtushenko’s birthday in the hamlet of 1,400 people, Locust Grove, Oklahoma, have to say about swimming, inspired by the Yevtushenko poem, as read by Zhenya Yevtushenko, his son?
