        "text": "In all honesty, I thought this episode was very middle-of-the-road. I loved the setting and the monster, but Neil and especially Bill's performances seemed very phoned in and it didn't seem like they were into it. The episode wasn't bad, it was just sort of \"meh\" and not anything noteworthy or memorable in the slightest. I did think it was cool that the background of that area where they tried to trap the Tardigrade was in the same style as the opening background for The New Scooby-Doo Movies intro.\n\nOne sort of general note I also had was that I feel like \"The High School Wolfman's Musical Lament\" may have been intended as the season finale, because it seems much more like one than this did. I guess they mentioned Bill and Neil knowing Urkel though, which I thought was funny. Also, notice that this episode is the second to not have an exclamation mark in the title.\n\nI know this was a pretty short review, but this was just really a very unmemorable episode!
