        "text": "Season 1 Actor Q&A\n\nLAUREN: Hello everyone! And welcome to the Fawx and Stallion Season One Actor Q&A. I am Lauren, co-producer, co-writer, co-director, etc of Fawx and Stallion, joined by my co-all of those things, Ian Geers. How are you doing?\n\nIAN: Doing awesome–right now, honestly, the best I've ever been.\n\nLAUREN: We got so many amazing questions for this Q&A–frankly, far more than we were expecting–right there at the homestretch of us asking for your questions. So we have actually split this Q&A into two separate Q&As. Ian and I will be talking about some of the writing based questions. And this Q&A is for our amazing cast of voice actors. We have three of our fantastic voice cast that have joined us to answer your questions today.\n\nIAN: Yeah, Two & A, if you will, because we'll have two Q and A's. We're gonna go on and introduce ourselves right now. First, we're just gonna–\n\n(LAUREN and IAN’s cat starts audibly sneezing in the background)\n\nWe're gonna go round and we're gonna go old school for this. We're gonna start—our cat is\n\nsneezing his ass off. I'm trying to get him to stop this is–\n\nLAUREN: Yeah, we have four voice actors here today. Actually, the the cat that you hear sneezing continually in the background? Is Llewyn who plays Ambrosius? And he's just ready to\n\nanswer some of your questions. You think he's wrapping up?\n\nIAN: All right, good. I\n\nLAUREN I think he's wrapping up.\n\nIAN So what we're gonna do is we're gonna go around, we're gonna ask for just your name, the\n\ncharacter you play, your pronouns, and how your character would take their tea.\n\nLAUREN Which was one of our lovely questions. Great question as an icebreaker.\n\nIAN So why don't we start off I'll start off just so I can do the embarrassing answers and stuff first,so you can feel better about saying whatever it is you want to say. My name's Ian, my pronouns are he/him/his–\n\nLAUREN –his name is Ian Geers.\n\nIAN Yeah, Ian Geers. That's the full one. And I don't play any character.\n\nKATIE: What–\n\nLAUREN You literally do.\n\nIAN That's wrong. I play McMurphy on the show. But I also–I am Lauren's co writer, co director, co everything else. And I take my–McMurphy takes his tea. Honestly, it is a cold glass of whole milk. It is a cold glass of whole milk that he drinks in a mug. Just make it look like sugar. I think once he found out sugar was an option. The world grew five sizes. Great, we’ll throw it\n\nover to Jeremy.\n\nJEREMY Hello, my name is Jeremy Thompson. He/him/his. I play Hampton Fawx and I have this feeling that Hampton takes his tea with as much in it as possible, I think. And I think everyone knows that two is the acceptable number of sugars in his tea, but he like sneaks more in there when no one's looking.\n\nIAN I do that with pumps of caramel in my iced coffee at Dunkin. Yeah. I know they put six\n\nin it. I'm just not telling them not to.\n\nKATIE Leslie Knope of him. Yeah.\n\nJEREMY I think there's probably a lemon wedge just for flair. And maybe a cinnamon stick too. I think it's gaudy and terrible.\n\nLAUREN He's a real maximalist in every way.\n\nIAN That's fantastic. Chris?\n\nCHRIS Yes. Hello. My name is Christopher Vizurraga. He/him/his. I play James stallion. And I believe that James takes his tea…It depends on time of day. First, I think first thing in the morning it's completely different than how it is in the afternoon versus how it is in the evening. In the evening it's just–it could just be whiskey and whiskey with lemon and a little bit of tea. And I\n\nthink in the morning A little bit of milk and I think one sugar. I think that's about all that he\n\nallows for.\n\nIAN Yeah, and he can taste it if there's any more than one in there. I get that, very particular. Katie.\n\nKATIE Hi, I'm Katie McLean Hainsworth, I play Madge Stallion, and I think Madge takes her tea one of two ways: either black or with gin. It is not dependent upon the time of day. Depending on\n\nthe situation, who she's with, what's happening.\n\nCHRIS Mood.\n\nIAN Brings new meaning to the term G and Tea. Anyway–\n\nLAUREN What?\n\nIAN Because the t–\n\nLAUREN OH. Yeah, just took a second, but I got there. I got there.\n\nIAN To you, Lauren.\n\nLAUREN Ah, hi. My name is Lauren Grace Thompson. I also play Sarah on the show. She/her pronouns. And I think Sarah is just the strongest tea you can make. One sugar, black. No milk. Yeah, she's just got to get through the day. I think she works like six jobs.\n\nIAN No, I get that.\n\nLAUREN She's like, “I'll find pleasure and other ways. This is purely functional.”\n\nIAN Won't we all? Yeah, that's great. Now we know everyone. Now we know everyone's particular tea orders. And–\n\nLAUREN –and that's really the only question we got. So good night.\n\nCHRIS This was fantastic.\n\nLAUREN This has been awesome. Thank you to our fans.\n\nIAN See you in season two.\n\nKATIE Singular fan who submitted one question,\n\nLAUREN One question submitted anonymously. Thank you,\n\nIAN Aka [Chris] Hainsworth (Commissioner Entwhistle), who was in the show. Oh, all right. Great. Yeah, we're gonna dive into some questions. Now. Lauren, you have our first one.\n\nLAUREN I have our first question from someone named Sara. This is for whoever wants to answer. “What is your favorite Sherlock Holmes story?” If you have one. I assume there may be some people who have never read any of the stories. Katie, it looks like you have your hand up.\n\nKATIE I have read all of the stories. And–and I and it's a cliche, but I really like The Speckled Band.\n\nLAUREN (excited) What?\n\nKATIE Yeah, I mean, it's got a snake in it. So like. That's the best one by far just for that\n\nreason.\n\nLAUREN I knew I liked you for a reason. Well, and also Katie, can you (just complete sidenote really quickly)--can you tell us, was there a project you did that research for, that you'd like to…this speaks to another question that's coming up about our favorite adaptation of Holmes.\n\nKATIE I'm contractually obligated to say that my favorite adaptation of Holmes is Christopher M. Walsh’s Miss Holmes and Miss Holmes Returns plays because I played Sherlock Holmes in\n\nthose plays, in which everything is the same except Holmes and Watson are women. And so, to\n\nprepare for that role the first time in 2016, I read and annotated every single story. I have the big compilation of of Sherlock Holmes, you know, just the hardcover thing and I read all 1200 pages and wrote down anytime there was a characteristic about Holmes expressed or spoken of by someone else or or internally thought of. I have a notebook in my–(laughs) This is embarrassing. Like Hampton Fawx. That's embarrassing.\n\nIAN Oh, that's fucking awesome. Yeah, you were awesome in that show.\n\nLAUREN Yeah. And then Chris, it looks like you have an answer to this–\n\nCHRIS Yeah. So on a related note, I've also played Sherlock Holmes in a staged reading of, of a new work back in, I think, I believe it was 2020. It was the first year of the pandemic. And it–the play was called Prima Donna. And it's, it's the Irene Adler story told from Irene Adler's perspective. So it's her. It's her story for the first half and then act two. It splits between Irene Adler and Sherlock Holmes and the story that's in I think it's Belgravia, a scandal in Bulgaria? [NOTE: Scandal in Bohemia]\n\nLAUREN Oh, my God.\n\nCHRIS Yeah. So that was really fun. That was one of the first pandemic projects that I did was\n\nthat play reading. And I got to play Holmes.\n\nLAUREN That's amazing. What's your favorite Holmes adaptation? Or not adaptation? What's your favorite story? In the canon?\n\nCHRIS Yeah, it's definitely the Irene Adler story. It's, it's just fantastic.\n\nIAN It’s a good one.\n\nLAUREN And then Jeremy, do you have an answer? Since you're–I'm realizing you're the only member of this trio that has not played Holmes.\n\nIAN This casting could not have gone better.\n\nLAUREN I would like to point out that we didn't know about any of this before we cast Katie or Chris.\n\nIAN We knew about Kate–\n\nLAUREN We knew about Katie.\n\nIAN We didn't know it was coming back.\n\nJEREMY It'd be great if I had a real surprise for you. But I have not played Sherlock Holmes. So yeah, that's the one I've missed. I–when I was a kid, my dad read my sister and I Hound of the\n\nBaskervilles as a bedtime story, sort of as an introduction to the characters. And then I've, I've,\n\nyou know, found little bits here and there. But a couple months ago, I picked up a copy of the\n\nComplete Sherlock Holmes, like part one, started reading through them. And I have to give a\n\nshout out to the very first story to A Study in Scarlet. Because I was, I was out working for the\n\nUtah Shakespeare Festival. And I sort of knew this, but I didn't know how hard it goes into the\n\nUtah angle. In the second half of A Study in Scarlet, you leave Watson's narrative entirely. You\n\nfollow someone completely different with Brigham Young, literally arriving in Salt Lake City, and\n\nrescuing this pioneer and the entire second half of the book goes very Under the Banner of\n\nHeaven, and like Murder Mormon territory, and it's wildly outlandish, but not entirely\n\ninaccurate. It's very strange, and then it turns back, but I also really loved it because it is\n\nHolmes and Watson kind of at the point where Hampton and James and Madge are–where they’re unknown, they get no credit at the end. Scotland Yard takes all the credit, they don't really care. And it also really gave me new respect–speaking of adaptations–for the Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law adaptations, because it is very, very silly. And actually, the more I read, the more respect I had for those movies, at least on a tonal, maybe not on a writing score, but on a on a total–\n\nLAUREN Take it back, Jeremy.\n\nIAN You don't believe Jared Harris could be a boxing champion??\n\nJEREMY Those are also the ones that, whenever I'm looking for something to just throw on while I'm packing or cleaning or doing something else, I can throw on either of those movies and I just love having them on the background.\n\nKATIE And I think I watch the BBC Sherlock when I need something on in the background. Sorry, Lauren.\n\nLAUREN I mean, we can turn right into the next question, which is: “Are you all Holmes fans? And what's your favorite adaptation?” We've already kind of been talking about that, about the Robert Downey Jr. Version. And, you know, the BBC version kind of took over my life for a\n\nseries of about four years, I have been very open about that. That's a whole thing. Ian, do you\n\nhave a favorite story or a favorite adaptation that you would like to talk about?\n\nIAN Um, one of the stories, when we were first writing the series, you and I watched a lot of the\n\nJeremy Brett. The Granada Holmes–\n\nLAUREN –which is my favorite adaptation, hands down, not even close–\n\nIAN And I just remember one of the books or of the of the stories that is really\n\nstuck with me from when I was a kid reading it, even though I've read quite a few of them, was\n\nThe Dancing Men. And I just love chalk drawings. And that's the main reason I like that one. But\n\nno, I just really liked ciphers. I like codes. Big fan of the movie Zodiac. Not the\n\nactions of the killer. I would also say in terms of adaptations, that kind of served as inspiration\n\nfor this. The Great Mouse Detective is one that I've always loved that I have, like I’ve just seen a\n\nton. But Scooby Doo is a huge reference point for me as well. And I don't think–you obviously\n\ndon't get Scooby Doo without Sherlock Holmes. And so we're kind of just like, you know, when\n\nyou put an adaptation through an adaptation machine through an adaptation machine through\n\nan adaptation machine, essentially what we're getting are just like some really great ingredients that we can use to create a similar kind of flavor dish.\n\nLAUREN I think that's really interesting because I think like the the Scooby-Doo-iness of it is, is\n\ninteresting in that, like Katie already mentioned, The Speckled Band, but that's like–my mom\n\nused to read me the stories before bed and she would read Sherlock Holmes and she would\n\nread Nancy Drew as my bedtime stories. And I think there's something about Speckled Band. I know a lot of people who read it as kids remember that story, because like, there's just a\n\nvivid imagery of it and like such a tangible feeling. And so much of that is just like, “we're waiting\n\nfor something to happen in this creepy house.” And I think that that's something that like–that\n\nmood carried on to like the Scooby Doo type things, and it's very fun. Does anyone else\n\nhave anything about their favorite adaptation? Katie?\n\nKATIE Yeah, I want to give a shout out to Neil Gaiman's adaptation, A Study in Emerald. I don't know where you get it now. I read it online like 20 years ago or something.\n\nLAUREN It’s available in some compilations, yeah.\n\nKATIE It's a great, great homage with a great twist at the end and it weaves in, you know, Cthulhu-ian horror, whatever, if you want to call that “weird horror” aspect of it. If you haven't read that one. I highly recommend it, very fun.\n\nIAN That's awesome. I want to give one last shout out one of my favorite–not even a Sherlock\n\nadaptation, an Arthur Conan Doyle adaptation. I want to give a huge shout out to the 2003 film\n\nShanghai Knights where Arthur Conan Doyle is a member of Scotland Yard that's assigned to\n\nJackie Chan's case. And at the end, they convinced him–he goes by Artie in the movie. At\n\nthe end, they convinced him to take down his stories and write books and then we get the\n\nreveal that he's Arthur Conan Doyle. And I will say it's stupid.\n\nLAUREN I called it\n\nIAN Oh yeah,\n\nKATIE I saw that movie when I was like 10 or 11.\n\nLAUREN I'd never seen it before.\n\nKATIE Like I've seen that but I don't remember that part, that feels wrong.\n\nIAN That shit has stuck with me ever since.\n\nKATIE! Oh, 7% Solution! With the guy who plays Merlin from Excalibur playing Sherlock and Alan Arkin playing…(searches for it)\n\nIAN Moriarty?\n\nKATIE: Freud.\n\nIAN (laughs) Oh, great.\n\nKATIE Trying to get him off cocaine. Can’t remember, I think it might be Jon Voight plays or Robert Duvall plays Watson in that one.\n\nLAUREN I just think it's hilarious that we have spent the first 10 minutes of our Q&A talking about this motherfucker Sherlock Holmes.\n\nIAN Yeah, fuck this guy! He’s not even in the show! Next question.\n\nLAUREN He's technically in our show–very briefly. Um, all right. So now on to our show. “For whoever wants to answer”–this is also from Sara–”which season one scene were you most excited to hear come together in the final cut?” So this can be for us as creatives or for you as actors, stuff you you wanted to hear your fellow actors do or stuff that you wanted to hear the music or the sound design? Jeremy,\n\nJEREMY I have to say that in reading it and recording it, I was so excited and so thrilled to finally hear the lava pit scene come together. There is so much happening at the same time. There's the mechanics of the pit. There's the conversation in the stands. There's the private voice and public voice that both James and Hampton are using during that fight and to hear the whole thing come together over the cliffhanger for one episode. And the beginning of the next one was just wild\n\nLAUREN That was a monster of a sequence because I think we recorded that–because there's so many people in the scene, that was I think like six different recording sessions. Plus,\n\nbasically everyone in the entire cast at the end of their final session, basically came in and did\n\ncrowd noises for that–we had a list of crowd noises that we needed. We had amazing music\n\nfrom our music designer, Baldemar. And then of course our fantastic\n\nIAN Sarah Buchynski, our sound designer who is who just absolutely killed it.\n\nLAUREN Like truly turned that around so quickly. And also was like making making foley sounds\n\nherself to like make that come together and really, like made it sound like\n\nIAN (joking) –really made a pit, literally made a drawbridge that would open up over the pit.\n\nLAUREN I remember, when Ian went to pitch that sequence. And I was just like, it's gonna be a fucking disaster in post production. But if it can sound good, it'll be great.\n\nIAN 17:38\n\nIAN I think I thought, Oh, I also wanted to know how that was gonna sound.\n\nLAUREN And y'all were great, because again, that was recorded in so many different sessions–it was great. You all just gave us so many options to be able to stitch it together.\n\nKATIE Yeah, I was excited to hear the Madge and Hampton Come to Jesus intercut with James and Archie in episode eight. I was very excited for Episode Eight.\n\nIAN Yeah, Episode Eight. Really, I told Lauren this so many times over the course of doing it, not to pat you on the back too much. But genuinely I was like, every time I heard a cut of an episode, I was like, this is our best one. And then just kept happening over and I was like, honestly, the honestly, the best one just became fact–but genuinely the episode eight was something that really–a lot of that was your idea. And a lot of it was your words and your dialogue. And I thought it came together.\n\nLAUREN It was a–yeah, it was a big turn into kind of a different, like more sincere energy that I think was a little bit of a leap and that really comes down to y’all’s acting that made it so\n\nbeautiful. And we really went out of our way to like, do the COVID tests and get the\n\nstudio so that y'all could be in rooms together speaking to each other face to face for those\n\nsequences. And I think that that investment really paid off. And you can you can tell that those\n\nwere people in a room together breathing together and like experiencing that together.\n\nKATIE I think before you cast me I sent you a note about that monologue at the bottom of page\n\nwhatever. Because I wanted to make sure it didn't get cut.\n\nLAUREN What's really funny about that is that we did readings of the whole show together before we'd officially cast it, but I think all three of you were part of that reading and it was just like–you were already cast.\n\nIAN We got our first picks for every character. Yeah, genuinely,\n\nLAUREN You were like, “Oh, I'd love to be considered for Madge” and we were like “Katie I'm not–we're not gonna make you work for it.”\n\nKATIE I was like “What do I have to do to be considered?”\n\nIAN We were like “literally just extend any bit of interest.” (laughs) That's awesome. Okay, next.\n\nKATIE I did also want to hear that–I think it's Episode Three where Madge and Hampton improvised their cover story?\n\nIAN Oh, yeah.\n\nKATIE Got to hear that put together.\n\nIAN That that was fun. Once we cracked that Hampton likes to play dress up, it really\n\nopened up a lot of doors for us. This is a great question. It's an easy answer. Who in the cast\n\nand crew do you think would most likely be able to solve an actual mystery?\n\nLAUREN Not just who's here right now. Anyone in the entire cast whether they're–\n\nKATIE I don't know if I can say the one that I think\n\nLAUREN You can say, I think I know the person you're thinking and he's been on the show\n\nKATIE Rob. The Narrator. Yeah. Yeah, he would definitely in a heartbeat.\n\nLAUREN Who is our Sherlock Holmes, yeah.\n\nKATIE I don't know what I'm allowed to say. I know we did the episodes and I feel like it's been a secret for so long\n\nLAUREN –that our narrator is also Sherlock–\n\nKATIE Yeah. Rob. Rob or Shawn (Archie).\n\nIAN Rob or Shawn, great answers. Nah, it’s you.\n\nLAUREN Who are you looking at? This is an audio–\n\n(laughs)\n\nIAN I’mlooking at Lauren, sorry. Lauren. Lauren would be the most likely to solve a mystery. That's not–we play the Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective games, which is like a kind of choose your own adventure murder mystery kind of a game. We play those almost every week. Lauren is very good at them, so much better than me. And you just like have mystery in your\n\nbones\n\nLAUREN Yeah, and we get mad that Sherlock Holmes beats us every single fucking time we\n\nplay that game\n\nIAN We’re reaching maximum amount of times we can say that fucker’s name on this podcast. Like we got three more. Max.\n\n(laughs)\n\nLAUREN I would like to put in a vote for Shawn, Shawn Pfautch, who plays Archie as well, I think that he could do it.\n\nIAN Two votes for Shawn. is he gonna win The Circle?\n\nJEREMY I'd have to–I don't know Shawn well enough. But I'd have to say that Lauren would be my vote as well. How well the script actually puts all of this stuff together. And also just knowing that it's not–like, I couldn't solve the mystery and I read the scripts all the way through to the end. And I still have to go back and be like–\n\nIAN That's because you read some of the drafts that I wrote where the mystery didn't make sense.\n\nJEREMY It's, I'm not the kind of person who tries to solve a mystery while I'm reading it. I'm just like, neat. Lay it out for me. It's just along for the ride. But yeah, I think Lauren's brain works\n\nthat way.\n\nIAN Chris, you gonna break this tie?\n\nCHRIS I think I've gotta go with Rob. .\n\nIAN Two for Rob. Two for Shawn.\n\nLAUREN Et tu Chris? Losing to Sherlock Holmes? Come on.\n\nKATIE Okay, now we only have two left. She just said it again.\n\nIAN Yeah, you just said it again.\n\nLAUREN And you know what, it was worth it. It was fucking worth it. To tear him down. He's fired.\n\nIAN This this is a question that comes knowing some of the lore of our of our show and some of\n\nJames's many financial ventures.\n\nLAUREN Also the ending of the show\n\nIAN How long until Fawx and Stallions start their first phonograph powered podcast?\n\nCHRIS Oh, it's in the works.\n\nIAN What's it called?\n\nCHRIS Talking on Wax? Waxing Poetic!\n\nLAUREN Oh my god.\n\nJEREMY Yeah.\n\nKATIE Oh, wow.\n\nIAN Fuck, that's good.\n\nLAUREN I do think James–because if you look at all of James's ideas, they're all actually successful ideas.\n\nIAN Ping pong, the phonograph and toilet paper? He's a smart man.\n\nCHRIS Very wise.\n\nLAUREN So he would invent the podcast, I fully believe. Maybe he does in Season Two, who's to say? Archie starts his little cozy baking podcast. I would love that for him. Yeah. So I'd say within probably within three months, I would say it's not distributions a little\n\ntricky in this time period, but he has the hustle needed\n\nKATIE Just door to door delivery of wax cylinder.\n\nLAUREN A subscription service. Little street urchin just brings it to your door and is like “new episodes.”\n\nKATIE Baker Street Irregulars just run around delivering it.\n\nJEREMY It’s like Netflix for podcasts.\n\nIAN “Have you downloaded the Herald app? Somebody stops your living room and shouts a story. So this is a question for Jeremy.\n\nJEREMY Okay.\n\nIAN Who has been in Hampton’s life longer? James or Ambrosius?\n\nJEREMY I…what I hesitate to answer about these questions is that sometimes not knowing is more fun.\n\nLAUREN Yeah. Yeah.\n\nJEREMY I have this feeling, also knowing Llewyn, our co star. I have this feeling that Ambrosius\n\nhas also just always been that old. I don't think Hampton has known Ambrosius as anything but an ancient cat. Perhaps Ambrosius has actually lived in the apartment longer than James or Hampton. Like we got the apartment, a cat was already living there.\n\nCHRIS Cat included. Yes.\n\nLAUREN I think that is a correct impulse.\n\nKATIE He's always been there\n\nJEREMY So I think that the technical answer is James just because I don't think Ambrosius has ever been anything but an old feline.\n\nIAN Yeah, I think there's–it's a one off episode. The first night in the apartment. They're having a\n\ngreat time, they think it's haunted. They keep hearing all these spooky sounds. Turns out it's\n\njust an old ass cat.\n\nLAUREN So yeah, James has been in his life longer only in the amount of time it took for them to find an apartment. Because as we know, he met James pretty much the second he got to town, right?\n\nJEREMY Bright lights, big city, stepped into the street immediately.\n\nLAUREN But he's known Madge longer than either of them.\n\nIAN Yeah, yes. All right, Lauren, you want to ask this next one?\n\nLAUREN Okay, great. Do any of the characters know how to play a musical instrument?\n\nKATIE Oh, God, not Madge. That would take so much patience.\n\nIAN And what do you think she would–like if her parents forced her to learn one instrument?\n\nKATIE Probably the piano?\n\nIAN Yeah, it's always the piano, the piano is where they get you\n\nLAUREN The Victrola?\n\nKATIE Yeah, just something awful. She would not be–she would not practice. She would\n\nrather be doing anything else.\n\nLAUREN Do you think in, like, the modern day if she got like, some drums?\n\nKATIE Oh, yeah. You could really release.\n\nLAUREN Yeah, I don't think she'd be good at it.\n\nIAN Madge could be a bongo queen. Yeah.\n\nLAUREN I think she's a big Stomp! fan.\n\nIAN I love that.\n\nCHRIS I would imagine that James at some point was taught the violin. And he either kept up with it and doesn't care to tell anybody or he's just completely forgot everything. And, and it's gone from the recesses of his mind\n\nKATIE –been replaced in the mind palace–\n\nCHRIS –he said never again.\n\nIAN I was gonna say, do you think he tells people if he doesn't remember it? Does he like–”it’s on my resume”?\n\nCHRIS Yeah, it could be a very, yeah, it could be a very shameful time in his life. He may have been.\n\nLAUREN Yeah, I do think his that he at some point, he must have invested in some sort of new musical instrument that is very easy to play.\n\nIAN The slide whistle.\n\n(IAN and LAUREN’s cat, LLEWYN, starts sneezing again in the background)\n\nLAUREN Yeah, he's like I invented the slide whistle. And it's actually–it requires a lot of skill, if you think about it! And like he's trying to convince people that it's–Yeah, our cats making crazy noises in the background, he’s mad–\n\nIAN We're not asking him any questions.\n\nKATIE I guess we got that other question wrong.\n\nLAUREN He's like, “Well, Ambrosius actually plays the flute.” And Jeremy, do you think Hampton plays any instrument? Do you think he ever tried to play the violin to be like Sherlock Holmes?\n\nJEREMY I think what he probably tried to play to be like Sherlock Holmes is the double bass. Because it's the same. I actually used to play the bass. But it's the same because I started playing the violin when I was a kid, but I wasn't fast enough on the strings. And they were like, oh, yeah, the bass is the same strings and fingering you just have all the rhythm parts. And so I I think Hampton maybe tried because it's like Sherlock Holmes but bigger and just failed miserably.\n\nLAUREN Yeah, and by the way, that question was from user @fangirl_kg. Thank you so\n\nmuch for your question.\n\nIAN Kilogram? What do you think the kg stands for?\n\nLAUREN I don't know.\n\nKATIE Karen Gillan.\n\nIAN Karen Gillan. Kevin Garnett.\n\nKATIE We just saw Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3, it’s fresh?\n\nIAN Oh, we gotta talk about it afterwards.\n\nLAUREN Amazing. What is everyone's favorite line on the show?\n\nKATIE I just listened to it.\n\nIAN Okay, yeah. What is everyone's favorite line on the show?\n\nKATIE It's my favorite line reading, I should say.\n\nIAN That’s valid.\n\nKATIE It is–how in the–I can't even try to do it. It's, “well how in the Pip Bin are we supposed to know?” from Jeremy, I've listened to just that line like 40 or 50 times.\n\nLAUREN So that is also the answer to a later question about “what is the nichest reference in this entire show?” There's like a question later on. That is what is the what is the most niche reference you have in there and it is that line because it is a reference to a BBC radio show called Bleak Expectations, which is one of the funniest things I've ever fucking heard. And believe the lead character's name is Pip Bin. And he invented the bin, as in the trashcan. It's the greatest\n\nKATIE I also like the line, “I don't know, 6? 24? But not the way I say it, I don't like the line reading that I gave.\n\nLAUREN Oh boo! I would now have chosen that take if I didn’t like it, Katie, there were other takes.\n\nKATIE I don't think I gave you any good ones.\n\nLAUREN Anyone else?\n\nJEREMY I think it's epitomized by, by Katie's version of “Hello, Sarah.” But just anytime, anytime that Madge hits on Sarah, in the least subtle way possible, it's amazing.\n\nLAUREN It's pretty great. I–yeah, there's–Katie has a line reading in episode eight. They, when she's trying to kind of get Hampton to realize that he's got his head up his own ass. And it's the it's the, “oh my god, it's you, you twat, I'm talking about you!” And it's–there's a character on Mythic Quest that you sound exactly like it's just stuck in my head.\n\nKATIE That's another one that I would have liked to another try at.\n\nLAUREN No, no, no, no, no Katie because it was perfect. And I also–there's a laugh that Jeremy does in–\n\nKATIE Oh god, I just–\n\nLAUREN In nine. The, like, I'm trying to distract you laugh he does. And it's funny because I\n\ntold Jeremy this literally yesterday. That is three separate takes worth of laughs that I just put\n\nback to back. I just took the takes back to back and I was like, That's it.\n\nIAN Yeah, there's–at the risk of killing the fun vibe. There's, as we said in episode eight, we do\n\nhave a little bit more of a sincere emotional turn in there. And one of my favorite lines and\n\none of my favorite line readings of your lines and one of Chris's line readings is the like,\n\n“Archie I think I messed up.” I just thought that was such a heartbreaking line reading and it really breaks my heart. But then I also will say a lot of a lot of my impulses as a writer for like\n\nbeing really verbose and really kind of just going as maximalist as possible is all imbued in\n\nTommy's dialogue as Crimeria. And hearing that dialogue come to life was a great joy.\n\nKATIE And because in the last Sherlock Holmes play I did–sorry, that's one more reference down.\n\nIAN That's one more time we can say his name.\n\nKATIE Tommy played the Moriarty character. And so we had finished recording this and then I went into rehearsal with Tommy, and had just heard that he was playing Crimeria.\n\nLAUREN We also had no idea.\n\nKATIE That was the first time I met Tommy, I walked right up to him. And I was like, You're Moriarty! And he was like, I know. And I'm like no, but your Crimeria too.\n\nLAUREN Crimeria wishes he was.\n\nIAN Yeah, I will say that was a–it was an interesting thing. I did an acting contract with Tommy like, four, three or four years ago. And the reason that Tommy's always been somebody I've wanted to work with, besides him just being like, incredible at what he does, and the nicest human being, is we did a D&D campaign and he did his voice as the character that he was\n\nplaying. And I just always remembered I was like that Tommy Malouf has got a really good\n\ndouchey British accent and I we gotta use that in something.\n\nJEREMY I was unprepared for that final episode–the full mustache twirly like evil genius off the rails. It was a joy to listen to.\n\nKATIE And those pauses!\n\nLAUREN God, yeah the long pause and the giant explosion of the like, “God this\n\nis just what parents said, May they rest in peace” is yeah. He just went into our home studio at\n\nour apartment and just rattled them off, it was great. Yes, fantastic. I also think Stallion in the bathtub doing his little tobacco cigarette song is–\n\nKATIE Basically every line in that episode is great.\n\nCHRIS That bathtub scene that has to be my favorite scene of the of Fawx and Stallion, just because it's at his lowest point. And it's written so well. And there was so much richness to delve into. And yeah, and you mentioned the line where he admits to Archie that he\n\nmade a mistake. And I thought that was absolutely pivotal to James's story and his arc\n\nthroughout the season. And, you know, he really, he really hadn't changed much up to that\n\npoint. He just been the sort of, you know, he's the guy who gets through it without trying too\n\nhard. And he did it and it was unfulfilling and I felt that that was so real. And I really wanted to\n\nhonor that. If I were to pick like my favorite line, just the the I mean, there was definitely a line\n\nthat I absolutely had to prepare myself for to get through without laughing was whenever\n\nJames is trying to be undercover, and he just has, it's just that “I'm George.”\n\nLAUREN Doesn't have have the skill for it.\n\nCHRIS He just does. It's not there. I love it. It was so difficult to do that in, in scene, because we were often recording all those together and just having to really stifle the laughter of, “God, I am so incompetent at this.”\n\nKATIE It was so precious to be able to record all those scenes together, but it was also very\n\nchallenging. Yeah,\n\nIAN I wonder if we can talk about that a little bit.\n\nLAUREN Our next question I actually think is my answer for that was probably about what\n\nyou're talking about? “What, if anything, would you change about the first season?” And I\n\nthink that I, if possible, I would just record everything in person. Yeah, I think that's what I what\n\nI would do. And I think it was so great for this series.\n\nIAN You were the one who really pushed for like, let's get back in the studio, let's like, have people together, let's like, we'll be able to riff easier, we'll be able to come up with new stuff easier. There'll be less of a time crunch. And I think that you made the 100% right call.\n\nLAUREN Yeah, we did. You know, we did a shit ton of COVID tests. And we, you know, made it work. And we also had–fun fact, we had Jeremy for, I think, I think you've recorded this whole season in nine days, Jeremy, something like that. Because Jeremy and I were on an acting tour out in Utah. And then we came back and you found out that you had you had gotten the summer in Utah, and you had to leave like nine days after we got back.\n\nJEREMY Yeah.\n\nLAUREN So it was also partially just like, okay, really fast and furious. Let's get these three in a\n\nroom together and just fucking knock these out. And it was really fast and furious. And I, you\n\nknow, it was very important, because I think none of the three of you, I think knew\n\neach other that in depth before this, which is also–\n\nKATIE Well, Chris and I did a show together a few years ago, and we're both ensemble members at Lifeline.\n\nJEREMY Yeah, but I–\n\nKATIE I think Jeremy and I–\n\nJEREMY Yeah, no, Katie, and I never met each other. And then Chris and I, probably a couple of times for Shakespeare stuff we would cross paths. But I think…\n\nLAUREN Yeah. So we felt like it was important that we get y'all in–we did a few zoom calls, where we just sort of talked about the characters and about their history. And then we threw\n\ny'all in the studio together and tried to do as much in chronological order as humanly possible.\n\nAnd I'm really excited to to kind of continue that in season two as much as as much as is\n\nabsolutely possible because we were also recording in a very, very tiny little makeshift studio\n\nthat had with like two microphones shoved in–we recorded in a box office of a\n\nstorefront theater, so like a very, very small space. And so we're very excited to get y'all more consistently in a studio where you can have your own microphone and you can breathe a\n\nlittle bit more. So I think that's the only thing I would really change. I love how it came\n\ntogether.\n\nIAN Yeah, anything else? So changed about the first season? No, nothing. It was perfect. And I have no notes for myself. I–no, I think that there's some stuff obviously. I'm sure that there's some jokes that are not going to age well in like six months, but it's it's–we had, we had a lot of fun. And I was really happy with the work that we all did. And so I don't, I wouldn't regret–I don't\n\nregret anything about the process. Yeah.\n\nKATIE I got nothing for this question.\n\nIAN Yeah. Yeah, whoever was trying to “get us” with this question? Not a gotcha!\n\n(laughs)\n\nLAUREN That was from AMC, who is very lovely, lovely fan of the show.\n\nIAN No, it's very nice. Thank you very much.\n\nLAUREN And thank you so much for that question.\n\nIAN The reason I paused was because the way the question looked–I briefly looked at it before the “what is everyone's favorite line in the show?” And then it says, parentheses, AMC, I\n\nthought it said “what is everyone's favorite show on AMC?”\n\nKATIE Better Call Saul.\n\nIAN Yeah. And I was gonna be like, it's interesting. I haven't seen Gangs of London. I've heard it's great.\n\nLAUREN I would have been like, is Interview with a Vampire on AMC?\n\nIAN It is!\n\nLAUREN Yeah. It's so good. Like I don't–I'm not gonna sidebar but it's quite–\n\nKATIE It's not better than Better Call Saul. No.\n\nLAUREN I think they’re trying to achieve very different things. Let’s just put it that way.\n\nIAN Yeah! Giancarlo Esposito barely turns into a vampire!\n\nKATIE But he doesn't not.\n\nIAN Yeah, I believe it. Next question! “What do you think the Fawx and Stallion crew would be\n\nlike, in modern times?” I assume by Modern Times they mean the Charlie Chaplin film Modern\n\nTimes. In which case, I would say that they would be hilarious in that movie.\n\nLAUREN And that's the nichest reference on the show.\n\nIAN Thanks. I appreciate it. Does anybody have a take on this? How would it be like in modern times?\n\nKATIE Oh, that's an interesting one. I think I'll be–the only thing that's leaping to mind is Seinfeld which almost isn't even modern anymore. It's it's such an old show, but i very–For whatever reason, I very much tie Madge and Elaine together.\n\nLAUREN Very, very big Seinfeld energy on Madge. Yeah, we agree. I love that.\n\nKATIE Yeah, she would feel very seen.\n\nIAN I think James would have to be like there as an influencer, like, some sort of parallel you could make to it. Or James has just gotten really good at like promoting other people's work and stuff like that. He's just a renaissance man that has no real set career path because he's doing a little bit of everything.\n\nCHRIS Yeah, right. You know, he's a, he's an independent investor. He can do whatever he wants.\n\nLAUREN Yeah, he's been on Shark Tank.\n\nKATIE I think he's one of the people on shark\n\nLAUREN One of the sharks, yeah. Anybody else have–There's also, we have another question from a separate person asking “if the characters lived in modern times, what kind of music would they listen to?” So I'd say that if either one of these you would like to answer, then go\n\nKATIE I cannot answer that one because I don't listen to modern music.\n\nLAUREN And I don't think Madge would either\n\nIAN I'll say when I was doing a lot of writing. I listened to a lot of–this is so dumb and\n\nembarrassing. I listened to a lot of–\n\nKATIE Andrew Lloyd Webber.\n\nIAN –yeah, it was all Starlight Express. Love Never Dies. It's just the D-Listers. No, when I was writing a lot of this I was listening to a lot of British music so it's like, I tried to stick to like British bands or like–there was a lot of–a lot of Arctic Monkeys was being listened to, a lot of Blur was being listened to, a lot of slowthai was being listened to, and like, Little Simz and like British rap weirdly became very big to listening to to get into the mode for this. The Daft Punk album that had Get Lucky on it was listened to a bunch while writing\n\nLAUREN You and I had very different musical touchstones. I was like yeah, a lot of pub rock. Mine was a lot of like The Fratellis Yeah, was a lot of my touchstone for this show. But like, ya know, I think a lot of like Vulfpeck too, weirdly, I don't know, just a lot of like, yeah, chill, like pub, pub rock, and like, a little bit of R&B. But I don't know, what do you think–I don't–Hampton probably doesn't listen to music. He's like, I'm above it.\n\nJEREMY Nothing's pinging for me with him. Nothing immediately music wise, when it comes to like, what would he be like in the in the modern day. I had a realization actually, I hadn't thought of this until you're just talking about TV shows. And a characterization that I might have stolen a lot of Hampton from is the recent TV adaptation of Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency. A show that was too beautiful to live. But yeah, but I think Dirk Gently might have a bit of modern day Hampton in him.\n\nIAN That's a good call.\n\nLAUREN I guess there's a little bit of–if you watch Only Murders in the Building, I think there's a little bit of Martin Short’s character, Oliver, there. Yeah, I think he also would probably–I think Hampton is the most likely to have a podcast in the modern day. Like, frankly, like five people are listening to it–\n\nJEREMY –despite his distrust of the technology in the season. I do feel that when he gets figured out how much he gets to talk. He's going to come up to James idea pretty–\n\nLAUREN I think yeah, I think ultimately, like if he gives it a shot, he's gonna realize it's exactly what he wants. And I think that again, no one listens to it. But I do think he's he has like big citizen detective energy. Like if you also if you watch like the new season of Yellowjackets, Elijah\n\nWood has a character on that, I think is very similar to the energy.\n\nIAN Yeah, trying to think just music…\n\nLAUREN I think it's just not even on his radar.\n\nKATIE It's and it's not on you-know-who’s [Holmes’s] radar either.\n\nJEREMY So I think that maybe he put on classical music because he thinks he's supposed to, but something like cold and mathematical?\n\nLAUREN Oh, yes. I think like, yeah, he saw that study that's like, all those bullshit studies\n\nwhere it's like, we had a bunch of students study while listening to Beethoven or study\n\nwhile listening to hip hop. And Beethoven won. And he was like, well, it's just Beethoven forever. I can't listen to any other music or I will fall behind. That's it. That feels very “him” to me.\n\nIAN Students are so stupid.\n\nLAUREN I feel like he listens to a lot of podcasts too. He's just like, I have to be learning. I can't be listening recreationally.\n\nKATIE True crime podcasts.\n\nLAUREN Yeah, or he's listening to like, you know, People's Pharmacy.\n\nIAN He's listened to a lot of my favorite murder.\n\nKATIE He's got those episodes memorized.\n\nLAUREN I think he needs something even drier. I think he's like he's going full like, you know, Radio Lab.\n\nIAN He thought Night Vale was nonfiction for the first two seasons.\n\nLAUREN And then James, I think is just locked into what's popular.\n\nCHRIS I think he could be–well on the show he's definitely into opera. And I feel like just if he were to–if you took James and put him in the modern day with, uh, you know the same kind of things that he's doing I think that he's curious and is like he probably has little niche tastes that nobody really knows. Like he really loves this like, “chill wave” or you know he's into like–”oh I found this this group when I was on vacation in Tahiti and I listened to their bongos all the time”\n\nKATIE He started the Gregorian Chant Wave of the 90s\n\nCHRIS Yeah he has these rich tastes that he's like plucked from all his travels and what he knows and loves and–\n\nLAUREN I think definitely he's the one that is most excited for his Spotify Wrapped at the end of the year.\n\nKATIE But then he immediately moves on\n\nIAN: it's like “I listened to like chillwave Peruvian flute music, how come it's saying that Taylor Swift is my most listened to artist?”\n\nLAUREN Because she probably is.\n\nIAN Next question. “What would”–this is a good one this is Katie. This is one's for Katie–”What\n\nwould the characters’ D&D classes be?” All of them.\n\nKATIE Oh, wow.\n\nLAUREN Just yours, we're gonna start with just you.\n\nKATIE You know, it's funny. It's a class I would never play, but I think Madge is the fighter. She's the put-upon, always-following-the-crazy-ideas-of-the-Bard and the sorcerer and the wizard and the other people who are so showy and stuff, but she still has a high charisma. Now this could\n\nbe influenced by the fact that I have never not pictured Gwendolyn Christie playing Madge when I have been recording or reading this at all. And she's taught–she was very much the the put-upon fighter in Game of Thrones, so yeah..but yeah, I don't think she has magic and I don't\n\nthink she trucks around with anything divine or primal. So she's, I think, Madge is a fighter. But I\n\nwould never play a fighter in my actual D&D games.\n\nLAUREN I think the trick of Hampton is that he thinks he's one class, but he's actually another. Yeah.\n\nKATIE I actually–I’m playing an actual d&d character that is–that is Hampton Fawx.\n\nJEREMY Yeah? What class?\n\nKATIE It's from–it's not from d&d, it's from Pathfinder. We're not going to get into that discussion\n\nright now. But it's an archetype of the bard that is called The Archivist. And so instead of like,\n\nwhereas normal bards will sing for inspiration to give their allies bonuses to hit and stuff like\n\nthat. She lectures them about what they're fighting so that they get bonuses to save against\n\ntheir special abilities and stuff like that. She has–she's Evelyn from The Mummy and I think she's the closest thing I've seen to Hampton. She has an ability called Pedantic Belaborment. She basically puts a creature to sleep by talking.\n\nJEREMY Oh, that's wonderful! Yeah, he probably thinks he's a wizard. But is that, yeah.\n\nIAN Yeah. What about James? Any idea, Chris?\n\nCHRIS I don't really play D&D, so I'm not too familiar with all the classes.\n\nKATIE Oh, cool. Awesome\n\nCHRIS So cool, guys.\n\nIAN You were cast this way for a reason, Chris. James is just Rege-Jean Page from the D&D movie.\n\nKATIE Paladin.\n\nIAN Yeah, he's a cool Paladin, or he's a drow. He's just a cool dark elf.\n\nKATIE Like yeah, it's like a rogue.\n\nIAN Yeah, yeah. Rogue.\n\nLAUREN I feel like a rogue because I feel like he does. He would also have like, basic magic. Like I feel like he would.\n\nIAN Yeah, that sleight of hand bullshit.\n\nCHRIS Okay, yes.\n\nIAN Yeah, this is going–you see all the fun you can have when you play d&d, Chris.\n\nKATIE Why aren’t we playing D&D right now?\n\nIAN Yeah, that's your other podcast.\n\nLAUREN Entire other podcasts for that.\n\nKATIE We have the party.\n\nIAN Alright. Love that. “What are some things”–I love this question. This is a great question. And this is–we're saying Sh–his name in this but this doesn't count. So it says, “what are some things that the Fawx and Stallion team can do better than Holmes and Watson?”\n\nKATIE Hide things in bustles?\n\nIAN Have bustles\n\nLAUREN That is fair. I mean, situationally, yeah, we don’t really know–\n\nKATIE Care about human beings. How about–\n\nIAN Damn, shots fired!\n\nLAUREN You played Sherlock Holmes!\n\nKATIE How do you think I know.\n\nCHRIS It's how she knows.\n\nKATIE I once screamed out in rehearsal, “I'm not here to be nice. I'm here to play Sherlock.”\n\nIAN That's great, put that on a t shirt. Hmm, some things that they can do…\n\nLAUREN I could answer this but I also think that would—\n\nIAN You don't want to tip our hand?\n\nLAUREN We don't want to tip our hands because I also think we talk about this–\n\nKATIE Oh, is it American accents?\n\nLAUREN Yeah, it's probably–we did do a when you hit 1000 followers on Tumblr, we\n\nwe held a poll for one fact about Sherlock Holmes that we would canonize in season two in our\n\nversion of Sherlock Holmes. And that was one of the options that Katie rallied extremely hard\n\nfor is that is the Sherlock Holmes cannot do an American accent.\n\nKATIE It's more personal.\n\nLAUREN It did not win.\n\nKATIE Lame. RIP, RIP.\n\nJEREMY I think we could probably mix a better drink.\n\nLAUREN Yeah. Oh, 100%.\n\nIAN Yeah, you guys can party more and better and healthier than they can. For all of your drinking, at least you're not like, on horse tranquilizers.\n\nLAUREN I think across the three of them, better work life balance. Yeah.\n\nJEREMY Because we're drinking together. We're not–when “that guy” does drugs, he's just doing them alone. It's not sad.\n\nKATIE I do think we sometimes tip that work life balance heavily into life.\n\nIAN And I'd rather have that, I'd rather have a tip over into life. The right one.\n\nLAUREN Yeah, this is–yeah, this is very much a question that I think we are looking to answer in thefuture. So I will not say too much more about that. But I do–to tiptoe around it. I think that our crew is maybe a little bit better about talking about their feelings.\n\nKATIE You think?\n\nLAUREN I think they got there. I think they're there. They're at the end of season one. Yeah. Great. On a lighter note–\n\nIAN Great question\n\nLAUREN –from Nikko with two K's. What would be everyone's favorite ice cream flavor?\n\nKATIE Chocolate not toffee.\n\nCHRIS I think James is a lemon sherbert kind of guy.\n\nIAN Yeah, you would. Something cool and refreshing and weirdly healthy. That makes sense.\n\nJEREMY Birthday cake.\n\nLAUREN Buddy!\n\nIAN McMurphy…McMurphy has never had ice cream before. And so when he discovers it, he goes fucking crazy.\n\nKATIE So much more to McMurphy than I've ever imagined.\n\nIAN But cotton candy would be his favorite. Lauren, Sarah.\n\nLAUREN Vanilla.\n\nIAN What?\n\nLAUREN I think she would. I think she–No I think, because I actually have been coming around to vanilla as a flavor. Because it's actually quite good.\n\nKATIE It's actually better than chocolate, not my favorite but–\n\nLAUREN It's better than chocolate. I think she would be very defensive of vanilla and be like, no, no, no. Technically it is more expensive to make it is a little more luxurious. I think she would appreciate it more. That's like–the work that goes into making–\n\nKATIE You’re talking French vanilla.\n\nLAUREN Yeah, I'm talking like really nice fuckin vanilla. Like the kind where you can see like the flakes of the vanilla beans in the ice cream. It's so smooth. And it's so rich. And it really does make you appreciate just like the foundation of ice cream. It's not just throwing a bunch of bullshit on top of it. It's like–no, we are celebrating the art of making ice cream.\n\nJEREMY Where did Sarah get the money for good French vanilla ice cream?\n\nLAUREN Well, I'm just saying that maybe at the end of this season, James fucking owes her something. Maybe he should fucking pony up and buy her some ice cream–\n\nCHRIS –start a business together.\n\nIAN I want to–I want to go back to the part where you said that vanilla is better than–?\n\nKATIE It is.\n\nLAUREN Yeah, it is.\n\nKATIE Not to Madge, but–\n\nLAUREN I did not always think that but now I do.\n\nIAN Jeremy, Chris, come on.\n\nCHRIS I mean, I can't say that I agree. But I'm also not going to tear down that choice.\n\nLAUREN Thanks, Chris.\n\nJEREMY As an ice cream flavor, I think maybe you can do more with it. Like you put more stuff in it as a base. But like–chocolate is like Rocky Road. That's like your go to.\n\nLAUREN Yeah, but we're not talking Rocky Road. We're talking about plain. We're talking about plain ice cream.\n\nCHRIS You can do a lot of stuff with chocolate too. Let’s not limit it.\n\nKATIE We're talking about its essence.\n\nLAUREN We're talking about–the only thing you're getting a pure scoop of either plain vanilla ice cream or plain chocolate ice cream\n\nIAN The same way that you're campaigning to have super fancy French vanilla ice cream with flakes of real vanilla bean and that–you can get a really good dark chocolate ice cream that's very rich and creamy.\n\nKATIE Well, not better than vanilla. It's not the same.\n\nCHRIS But is your average vanilla gonna be better than your average chocolate?\n\nKATIE Yes.\n\nIAN No.\n\nLAUREN Yeah, I would say yeah, I would say average chocolate kinda tastes like nothing.\n\nIAN WHAT?\n\nKATIE We always got the Neapolitan in my house.\n\nJEREMY No one said strawberry. No one's riding hard for strawberry.\n\nKATIE [My husband] Hainsworth makes a brilliant homemade strawberry ice cream that is so good. But you can't–it's too much, like it's overwhelming. You can't have it every day.\n\nLAUREN This is the longest answer for any of the questions so far.\n\nIAN I'm glad. I'm glad we're getting to the bottom of something. I'm reconsidering our engagement. There's a lot of stuff happening.\n\nLAUREN Well, the audience doesn't know that we're engaged.\n\nIAN Well, they do now. Two desserts at the wedding! All right. For the actors. Oh, yeah. Oh, this is a good one. Your favorite character that isn't yours?\n\nKATIE You're making me choose between my puppy and my kitten.\n\nIAN Yeah, you gotta choose between your chocolate and your vanilla.\n\nLAUREN This can be someone who's not even here.\n\nCHRIS Archie is probably my favorite character that's not mine. Yeah, he's, I've really like–it's just a really great side character, somebody who's is deeply involved in the plot and is invested. But is, is somewhat running counter to how the main story is going. But he's crucial. He's absolutely crucial to the story and you need him there. And Shawn just does such\n\na great job with it. Bringing it to life. And I just think it's so he's so sweet and so wonderful.\n\nLAUREN Yeah, that really a character really–when we did the subsequent drafts after casting Shawn, I think it really kind of came to life when we knew that it was his voice that was doing it. And I also just think, like, I look forward to season two. We can give him a little\n\nmore silly stuff to do because I think he he carried so much of the emotional weight of the first\n\nseason that I'm just like. Let's get let's get silly here and have some shenanigans happen.\n\nKATIE Yeah. Oh! George Kensington. George. Yes.\n\nLAUREN George! RIP.\n\nIAN I would say, honestly, two of my favorites that are not have not been mentioned yet. One is Sazarac. Tina. Tina Muñoz Pandya has a character, Furina Sazarac, who started off as one thing. And then just when Tina was in the booth, we just kept throwing weirder and weirder alternate lines at her.\n\nKATIE She was hard to record with too.\n\nIAN Yeah. And she just ran with it. It was great. And the other is the Commissioner, who Hainsworth (Katie’s husband) plays. Because, yeah, it was just so much fun. And that character, that episode is one of my favorites. And some of those lines are so ridiculous, and Hainsworth delivers them so straight. And it was just like, “we're just gonna do the Hot Fuzz scene from the beginning [of the movie].” And he was like “great!” And the performance is fantastic. I love that character.\n\nJEREMY I'd give another shout out to Tommy as Crimeria. I just was totally unprepared. For what that was gonna sound like, in the end, across the board. I loved being in the room with everyone who's on this recording and just wish for the opportunity to be actually in the room and play with more people. Because it–yeah, it's so much fun.\n\nLAUREN We're excited to get y'all in the room with a few more people that we will not disclose. Yeah, and I also just want to, like give a shout out to like our mini, you know–our “detective across the street.” I think Rob is a very exciting performer to have in that role. Because we've known him for so long and know what he can do. And you've only seen a very small sliver of it. And we're very excited to do that. And I I love that everyone in this cast has the ability to know exactly what we're going for and to go big and hit these huge comedic moments and know exactly the full like theatrical extent of it, but still stay grounded in such humanity to make something like episode eight work. So I'm, I'm really, really happy that we have the people that we do.\n\nIAN Yeah. The next question. Where–there! This kind of goes back. We were talking about this a little bit earlier. But if there's any more–”were there any moments” in your performance or in the writing of the show, I guess for us, Lauren, “that were inspired by niche references that most\n\nlisteners would not pick up on.”\n\nCHRIS This–so I'll just say that, part of my feeling with how James fit into the\n\ndynamic between James, Hampton and Madge–I really felt like, I remember hearing a quote from Richard Schiff, who played Toby Ziegler on The West Wing. He mentioned seeing the ensemble of actors around him, and kind of realizing that he needs to play a different–\n\neverybody's an orchestra, everybody is playing a different instrument, and his instrument\n\nneeds to be different than everybody else's. And he said that Toby is the oboe. And I–there's something about that, that really strikes me as kind of right for James. He’s there for crucial moments and is underscoring the whole thing, has some popup funny moments, but for the most part is really just there and supportive. And, you know, is, is doing his best to make sure that everybody is doing what they want to do. And I think that's, that was just one of the linchpins, for me, it didn't really dictate anything that I did with the character specifically, I wasn't trying to sneak in any Toby references or anything, but that was just an approach that I think worked for me.\n\nLAUREN I think that kind of worked beautifully for you. Because I think for so much of the first half of the season, you're so like, you're the one that's in the back, that's kind of the stabilizing force that's on kind of a low simmer. And then in this back half of the season one, when it just all kind of goes off the rails, it's even funnier because you've been so like–we talked about a lot of like, who's leaned forward and who's leaned back on the show, and we always kind of viewed like, Hampton is perpetually like leaned forward in his seat, he's leading with his head, he's running into things. And James is, in his own way, sort of just leaned back and is fine. And he's\n\nsettled. And he's happy with his life or thinks he is, until you know, one wrong sentence just\n\nfucking clicks the switch that you're like, “I didn't know that was an insecurity. And now I'm\n\nspiraling.” Which was very much how we talked about James just like, I'm doing fine. And then\n\nthe one thing you didn't realize was your worst fear gets confirmed. And then suddenly,\n\nI'm a version of myself I've never been. So I think that that really helps sell like that. He's in a\n\ncrisis in that second half.\n\nIAN Yeah. Um, there is–only one person has caught this so far. Shout out to James Ferrero, who plays the man in the very first scene of the show, the Piccadilly Purse Pilcher, or not him, but you know–he caught that the opening scene of episode five, of Archie's episode, in the diner, is just the first scene from Training Day. It's just the first scene from Training Day, the dialogue is slightly different, but even McMurphy does the like “You have pockets? Put your hands in the pockets, pull out your wallet, pay the bill.” Which is Denzel Washington's last line in that scene. And he says it, McMurphy gets to say it because I wanted to know what it was like to say a Denzel Washington line. But I don't know, we were talking so much about that episode in particular. And you were gone on [an acting] contract. And so it was like, “All right, I'm gonna\n\ngive myself like a week or so to write this, the first draft of this.” And so I just binged a lot of like,\n\ncop movie, my favorite movies about the police or movies with cops in them or TV shows about stuff. And Training Day was so, is so good, and also so silly. It was just ripe for parody. And it felt like it made a lot of sense that Archie's first day would feel a lot like Ethan Hawke’s first day\n\nLAUREN Yeah, and then you also have that that touchstone of the pop culture expectations of what it's like to work in the police force and then slowly break that down over the course of the episode, into kind of the drudgery, and the the way that it sort of breaks you down.\n\nIAN We also have in that episode, McMurphy's breakfast order at the diner is Reynold Woodcock’s breakfast order from Phantom Thread. So there's stuff like that, if you're if you're into that stuff, yeah, we got it in.\n\nLAUREN Yeah. I really love that. Luckily, we all caught in the room in episode eight when Hampton’s having his break down, the “Are we just supposed to wait five more years for\n\nSherlock Holmes to fall off a fucking cliff before we get another shot?” I think the smallest like niche thing that I have had and that also only one person has caught is in the minisode, the bonus minisode, episode 10. Watson has a moment where he asks “was that just like incredibly terrible?” And Holmes basically just straight up is like “yeah, it is.” And that's exactly an exchange, that is one of my favorite exchanges from The Solitary Cyclist episode of the Grenada Sherlock Holmes. Watson's like, gone off to the country–Holmes has sent them there to be like–\n\nIAN You have to come up with a new name.\n\nLAUREN Okay, “The Detective” sends him out just to to be like, “I need you to stick this\n\nout and see if this creepy shit’s happening,” and then Watson just absolutely biffs it, just doesn't\n\ndo it right. And he goes like, “You didn't fucking tell me how to do it.” And then Holmes–”The Detective” is just like you absolutely fucked it up. And Watson just goes, Did I really do so incredibly badly? Holmes just turns around and says, “yeah.” David Burke’s Watson has the most crestfallen look on his face I've ever seen in my life. I love him so much. That was my little–my little reference for that particular series that–I love them so much.\n\nIAN Yeah, part of our writing style is very, kind of very mosaic built. Like it's there's a lot of references to media or, or, you know, books, television shows, music, stuff like that, that we that we love, and trying to put it through whatever our lens is. But we still try and sneak in quite a few just to make things kind of fun for us.\n\nLAUREN 1:06:15\n\nYeah, but the actual nichest thing is that Bleak Expectations BBC Radio Show joke.\n\nIAN Yeah. Next question. I can't read that. Can you read that?\n\nLAUREN Oh, yeah. This is something that we were talking about. Just the other day, Jeremy and I one on one. This person says, “As a cat loving aromantic asexual person myself Hampton, being aromantic asexual, which we have talked about a couple times, really means a lot to me. How did that aspect of his character come about while you were developing him? Was it always part of his character? Or was it a choice that you realized along the way? We've talked about this a little bit on Tumblr, and a lot of people have been kind of reaching out to us about some of the intimations and talking around the fact that Hampton is, is asexual. And we talked about it a little bit on our Tumblr, but this is kind of the first time we've talked about it [on the show]. Um, and I think that was something that in our, in an earlier version of the script was not necessarily a part of him. It was specifically before we had cast Jeremy.\n\nIAN Literally, when Lauren and I were like, first throwing around the idea of the show. Yeah,\n\nLAUREN Yeah, [he] was kind of a completely different person. And then Jeremy came in for\n\nthe readings. And we did a few more passes on the character. And I remember, it was like one\n\nexchange in Episode Seven that I think Jeremy and I were talking about when we were on tour,\n\nthat that exchange where Madge just is like ogling the girls’ ankles. And and is like,\n\n“You know what? You were thinking it too Hampton.” And he's like, “I wasn't, I really wasn't.” And I think Jeremy, it was you being like, I actually really don't think that–I mean, you\n\ndon't think he was thinking that.\n\nJEREMY You may have already been thinking along those lines at that point, that Hampton was not going to have a register for that sort of thing. But I remember you did at least\n\nin the reading ask me about it and you're like, “What do you think of that line?” And I said,\n\n“Yeah, I think he's–” because I went to Madge and then back to Sarah, “I really wasn't”--and working on the timing of that and being like, “yeah, no, I think he's totally honest.”\n\nLAUREN Yeah, and not overcompensating, he really just doesn't care. I think.\n\nJEREMY it's something that doesn't matter to him, doesn't register to him, and is wonderful to play with as a blind spot. The other line that I loved is along those lines as a blind spot, is James's “Wouldn't it be great if they had a place like this, but for men?” It's not that, not that\n\nHampton’s totally unaware of other people's romantic and sexual urges, but they are not\n\nsomething that registers for him, or not the first thing he thinks of when deducing other things\n\neither.\n\nLAUREN Yeah, I think it's something that was–that felt pretty organic as a development once once we started going through revision drafts the character. It's also, you know, something that\n\na lot of versions of Sherlock Holmes kind of tiptoed around, that being a part of his identity. And so it felt like that was something that we saw an opportunity to explore and actually integrate into the character from the beginning and have that be something that he doesn't feel any particular angst about. And doesn't feel like you know, doesn't feel like there's anything wrong with him. And also I've talked many times about how the central love story, I think, of the show is, at least his first season, Hampton and Madge. And that is not romantic and not sexual, but is a love and is a love story. And just because Hampton doesn't have the word for for that doesn't mean that I think he isn't aware of it or that like any of his friends really have a problem with it. Also when we have so many different types of queer characters in the show, that just felt like it kind of developed organically with what we were doing.\n\nIAN Yeah, we were pretty dedicated early on to the characters and their and their sexualities or, or, you know, gender assignments, anything like that, like it all came about very organically. And all felt like it served the story and felt like it served a theme that we were interested in of the people who are living during these time periods and may be interested in the same things, but weren't getting the same exposure as the other people as the as the–the consulting detective and Watson, for instance, but I–\n\nLAUREN Just letting ourselves say Watson however many times we’d like.\n\nIAN We're giving that guy a break.\n\nLAUREN He's a good dude.\n\nIAN But yeah, but we were also very, very adamant about the fact that we never wanted any of their personal struggle or conflict to stem from their identities, that these are all characters that are proud of who they are proud of where they come from, and, and that those things help empower them, like to solve the mystery or do whatever become the best versions of themselves. But also at worst, you know, in Madge’s case, it's like whatever imagined sexual assignment was, or identity it was going to be, it's like Madge is still gonna try and fuck somebody in the coatroom, that's just Madge. It doesn't matter what the gender of a person is, like. So we just really, we were more into, into again, just trying to figure everything through that thesis that that Madge eloquently puts out in episode eight, “The stories haven't made room for us. So like, Fuck the stories.”\n\nLAUREN Yeah, I think that's not even like–about to go into kind of a complete tangent. Like that line isn't necessarily about, you know, the subtext of those stories or the potential of those stories of containing queerness or anything like that. I think it's more about just, we're waiting for those stories that have been around forever to represent ourselves, when why don't we just fucking forge our own path and do that and so it was important that like, that Hampton\n\nalso, frankly, be a part of that. And I think it felt really natural to have that be a part of his\n\nidentity.\n\nJEREMY Yep. As for the cat loving part, that came very easily. I grew up with two cats Jean Claude and Cosette.\n\nLAUREN Although you do have a dog right now that you're living with.\n\nJEREMY I live with–my roommate’s dog's name is Watson, and it is named after the detective's friend.\n\nLAUREN Two actors here who have played Sherlock Holmes. And one who has a dog named after Watson.\n\nJEREMY I'm basically Mrs. Hudson in this arrangement.\n\nLAUREN She's hot, apparently, so good for you.\n\nIAN Great. For Katie: What does Madge like best about herself? We got a lot of Madge fans. Madge Army rise up.\n\nKATIE Her height?\n\nIAN Yeah, yeah.\n\nKATIE Unavoidable.\n\nIAN Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love that.\n\nLAUREN I think she's–yeah, I love it.There's very few appearance things that I'm like, “No, this is fact.” Because I firmly believe like, no, the great thing about audio is that a different version of this character lives in every person's mind. And isn't that cool? But I'm like, if you fucking try to tell me Madge isn’t tall. I will be like, No, we wrote the show. She's fucking tall. Sit down.\n\nKATIE Yeah, which is which is fun being in the studio and being by far the shortest person of the\n\ngroup. But yeah, I think–I know it sounds shallow. But it isn't. It's an unavoidable thing she owns\n\nand it's meaningful to her.\n\nLAUREN And her pointy elbows.\n\nIAN I will say, as a tall person. It does take a while. Chris, I wonder if you feel this way. It does take a little bit to own that height. There is a shame to get over.\n\nCHRIS Yeah, I'm still working on it. You know, you don't fit through certain doorways.\n\nYou can't walk under trees. I try and you know, move around, you know, too fast. I get new\n\nscrapes on my elbows and my hands and things. You know, just being aware of your body and\n\nspace is hard. And it's, it's harder when you're tall.\n\nIAN I'm everybody's least favorite person at a concert.\n\nLAUREN Oh, yeah. Ian's got a whole complex about it.\n\nIAN Yeah, it's–genuinely I have a whole complex\n\nCHRIS Like you're the best person for that situation. But you're also the guiltiest.\n\nIAN Yeah. Okay, great–we're in the homestretch. “Which character is most likely to have their whole day ruined by a horoscope?” This is from Talfryn.\n\nLAUREN What a great question. Great question.\n\nKATIE So this reminds me of Rounders, when they say “when you're at a table and you're looking around at everyone and you can't figure out who the patsy is, it must be you.” I feel my answer to this question is probably Madge.\n\nIAN Katie, I love your answer. And I love even more the fact that you referenced one of my favorite movies.\n\nJEREMY I don't know. I think it might…my vote might be James. He tried to ignore it. He'd be like, no. And then as things go it would nag at him. The denial in the back of your brain. It's not that it's not that it's not that it's not that until until the dam breaks.\n\nCHRIS I think he would. Yeah, I feel like James just like, “I don't want to see the horoscope. Tell me what it says.”\n\nLAUREN “I do. I do. I'm gonna need to see it. I'm gonna need to see it.”\n\nCHRIS “What is this bullshit? Oh. Oh, it's gonna come true, isn't it?”\n\nIAN I don't know if McMurphy's day would be ruined by his horoscope. But I think you would be\n\nshocked at how accurate they are\n\nKATIE Let's not forget the maids.\n\nIAN Oh, yeah, that's true. They would 100% of their time.\n\nLAUREN Also, Jonathan Crimeria 100%.\n\nKATIE He'll get the paper shut down. Yeah, he would have edited he would have a retraction printed.\n\nLAUREN I think I am gonna need each character's star sign soon, though.\n\nIAN “Do any of James, Madge, and Archie have celebrity crushes? I feel like Archie would massively have the hots for John Watson. And Hampton probably platonically aspires to be Oscar Wilde.” I don't know who asked this question. But this is great.\n\nLAUREN This is great.\n\nKATIE I think Madge is too busy having crushes on capable and/or unavailable real people. I don't think–yeah, I don't think she would bother.\n\nLAUREN She has crushes on like the girl that's making her coffee. Yeah.\n\nIAN Madge gets real turned on by–what's her name–Madame Defarge from Tale of Two Cities, she's like real into her. She's like, “Sew me a sweater and start my revolution, baby.”\n\nCHRIS I don't think that James has a celebrity crush because he knows all of them. And he knows that they're not that impressive.\n\nIAN What was James's outfit at the Met Gala this year?\n\nCHRIS Man. I'm trying to–I'm trying to think now, just my favorite looks from the Met Gala this year. Pusha T had a great one. It's like piano keys looking kind of thing on one leg and then on the opposite torso and then on the opposite arm. And I thought that was a really cool look.\n\nIAN Yeah, it's that or it's Brian Tyree Henry's look like all of like the feathered and–\n\nCHRIS Yeah, that was awesome.\n\nLAUREN I feel like Harvey Guillen’s outfit–that like beautiful pink peacoat Yeah, that was also pretty great. It's like a floor length tail on it. It was great.\n\nIAN He's not rockin just a simple tuxedo. He understands the assignment.\n\nLAUREN He understands that men are fucking pathetic if they show up to the Met Gala in just a fucking regular tux and they should be ashamed and kicked out immediately. I catch you in a regular suit, men, get out of the Met Gala.\n\nIAN Yeah. Pierce Brosnan. We're coming for you.\n\nLAUREN I can't answer this question. Because I have very strong feelings that will probably be answered in the show.\n\nIAN Yeah, the next question: How many seasons are you going for? The more the better.\n\nKATIE All of them.\n\nLAUREN How many is all?\n\nKATIE till I die.\n\nIAN Yeah, yeah. Great answer.\n\nCHRIS Until you change then the name away from Fawx and Stallion–you take Stallion out. Then I suppose my time is up.\n\nIAN Fawx and McMurphy.\n\nJEREMY Oh, Lord, yeah, that might be where I sign off. But until then I'm on board.\n\nLAUREN Oh, goodness. Well, Ian, would you like to answer the question?\n\nIAN Yeah, why not? How many seasons are we gonna go for? I–do you want to get super specific on that?\n\nLAUREN You had the questions ahead of time…Do you want to answer?\n\nIAN Yeah, sure. As of right now–this may change–as of right now we have a five season plan. So that's the short answer.\n\nLAUREN Yeah, it could be–with what we have planned, it could be as few as four. But it could potentially be more.\n\nKATIE Are you gonna kill us at the end?\n\nCHRIS Spin us off! Give a spin off series. There we go.\n\nKATIE It's a spin up but it's still just the three of us.\n\nCHRIS It's just the three of us still. Just three titles.\n\nLAUREN They just get new names.\n\nIAN It's honestly it's just the three of you going back and re recording from the first season, but the three of you are playing every character. And you're gonna have to divvy up those roles.\n\nLAUREN There is going to be a spin off, but it's just called Ambrosius– exclamation mark.\n\nKATIE No, question mark!\n\nLAUREN Ambrosius question mark.\n\nIAN I want the title of the show to reflect the audience's reaction to the news of the show.\n\nLAUREN Yeah, there are–there are a few assurance I will make. None of you are dying\n\nand Ambrsius is not dying. Like there we go. You're good. But McMurphy? Question mark. Unclear. We'll see. We'll see if he earns his place in the ensemble.\n\nKATIE He's got such a rich backstory now. I feel like you have to pay that off.\n\nIAN This is why I love D&D, too. Yeah. Anything is canon as long as you say it. In a voice. Yeah.\n\nOkay. Oh, this is this just gonna be a prediction I want to throw out for Chris. “How many times\n\ndo you think James is going to be abducted in season two?”\n\nCHRIS Oh, I hope at least once more. I think–I mean, hopefully James has learned a lesson or two and will not be so easily caught. However, that scene was just too good. Yeah, not–\n\nLAUREN There are two.\n\nCHRIS That's right! Yes! You got it. Yeah, we gotta have more.\n\nLAUREN He just makes it look cool and hot. You know?\n\nIAN Yeah, I always imagined when we would write the scenes of James being\n\nabducted even when he's like in the stocks at the end or when he's like, tied to the\n\nchair with Oskar. I always imagined the scene in Casino Royale with Daniel Craig tied to the chair getting his ass whipped.\n\nLAUREN Because I always feel like it is important to remember that James is quite hot. Yeah, that's the thing is like, no, he's making it work. He's in distress. Somehow. It's still working.\n\nJEREMY Yeah, a little bit Ewan McGregor tied to the post in Attack of the Clones.\n\nLAUREN Oh, yeah. You're like, “hope this doesn't awaken anything.” And I would say my answer to how many times will James be abducted in season two is as many times as it takes for the plot. All right. We are in the homestretch. I love this next question. “If you could pitch one future storyline or bit or piece of backstory for your character to the creators, what would it be?”\n\nIAN We're here, we're listening, and we are in the process of writing two\n\nLAUREN You are not allowed to pitch something that we've already told you happens in season two. Because there are things that we have told you about season two, we have basically soft pitched to you all on your season two arcs. You're not allowed to pitch anything that you know\n\nhappens.\n\nCHRIS Okay, here's mine for James. James is, I think that he is secretly a natural and accomplished, amazing horse rider. I think that he–I think that it just comes naturally to him. And I think it doesn't even–he doesn't even know how he does it. He just could get on a horse and look magnificent as fuck, and do anything that he wants.\n\nIAN Wow, he's like Toshiro Mifune..\n\nCHRIS Yes\n\nIAN That's incredible. Oh my god.\n\nLAUREN Clickety clack clickety clack. This is me canonizing this immediately. Yes, he's a Stallion that is riding a stallion Yes. Anyone else?\n\nKATIE I would like to see Madge get an advice column in the Times or The Standard. I don't know which one, perhaps both, syndicated. Yeah, I think that's what I would like to see.\n\nLAUREN I think that's what the world needs obviously. Clearly like what she did for Hampton\n\nIAN “Are You There, Madge? It’s Me, Person.”\n\nLAUREN Jeremy I see you thinking I see you cooking.\n\nJEREMY I'm thinking of ideas. None of them are coming out great in my brain. I'm not a writer. This is why I don't do this. The best predicament that I could think of for Hampton–I don't\n\nknow how you do this in an audio drama–would be for him to lose his voice for a little bit.\n\nIAN Oh my god.\n\nJEREMY I don't want to write myself out of the show. Maybe he's just out an entire episode. KATIE Honestly, we try to guess through charades. What he's trying to say. Please write that.\n\nLAUREN If the listeners could see Ian's face right now. Just had a lightbulb moment of like, oh,\n\nWow.\n\nIAN that's cool. I'm just thinking of how you would do that here. Yeah.\n\nJEREMY I have no idea. That's not my job.\n\nIAN No, it's mine now, Jesus! That's a great idea. The other two–we're fine. But that was great.\n\nLAUREN We really only have two final questions for everyone tonight, and then we are going to say goodbye. Until the next time that we hear you all. Um, so I would like to ask all of you, what\n\npiece of advice would you give your character going into next season? Do you want to take your McMurphy answer while they ponder on it?\n\nIAN Sure. I would tell McMurphy. Honestly. No notes. Keep doing what you're doing.\n\nLAUREN That's not true. You know, that's not true.\n\nIAN No, I would tell McMurphy that he doesn't need to worry about what other people think about him as much.\n\nLAUREN Yeah. Oh, that's beautiful. Don't worry about it. Yeah. I would tell Sarah, let your rich friends send you on a vacation, girl. You deserve it.\n\nCHRIS James could probably use a little empathy training.\n\nKATIE 1:26:42\n\nI think I’d tell Madge that wherever she is, she's probably earned it.\n\nIAN Whoa, wow, that is deep. Wow.\n\nLAUREN Also much needed, shit.\n\nIAN That's a swift kick in the back of the pants, and also something that'll pick me up. Wow.\n\nYeah, damn. All right, Jeremy. Follow that one up.\n\nJEREMY I think I would tell Hampton…I would try to encourage any hobby, any downtime, like so like, what's on your reading lists? But how can you be still for a bit? Just to encourage some casual relaxation and find some time for himself. That's not frenzied and running around. To Be quiet with his thoughts.\n\nLAUREN I don't think he wants to be with this.\n\nJEREMY Well, neither do I. I give this advice to myself too. Yeah, but there's a lot of crossover here.\n\nLAUREN I heard Katie say, Don't drink so much.\n\nKATIE For all of them.\n\nLAUREN Maybe just a little bit less? Maybe? No. That sounds like a horrible idea.\n\nIAN Never say so many great shenanigans that come from drinking too much.\n\nLAUREN All right. And then finally, this is from me this because I kind of want to just end on a little bit of a looking forward note.\n\nIAN Yeah, the note on the doc says “saving the best for last: my question.”\n\nLAUREN As I mentioned, we've kind of soft pitched most of season two to y'all. And a lot of your character arcs and some of the bits that we've been pitching to you. And so we just ask if there's anything that you would like to tease for season two that you are excited for? Do be vague. But what’s something that you think you are excited to work on with your character if you have anything.\n\nIAN And don't be mad if–if the reaction from the public when they listen to this is negative–we\n\nchange that in the script. This is not us trying to kind of take the temperature of the culture of\n\nour friends who listen to the show.\n\nKATIE I'm gonna go first, because mine's not gonna be very satisfying, but I'm looking forward to working with someone that I'm excited to work with.\n\nJEREMY I'm excited for a Hampton’s attempt at public relations\n\nLAUREN (laughing) Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I think it's gonna go super well.\n\nCHRIS I'm just excited to know what James's next entrepreneurial opportunity is.\n\nLAUREN It's certainly a step up.\n\nIAN Yeah. Some might say framing device worthy.\n\nLAUREN It might be central to the plot, you could even say. It may hit new heights, even.\n\nIAN Yeah,I am excited for–We're trying to think of how to put this in a coy way. Yeah. I'm excited for our characters to be equally bolstered up and knocked down several pegs at the same time and often by the same thing.\n\nLAUREN That's always I think, yeah, I think there is a–there is a certain question that we had of, you know, “what happens if you get what you want, but it's horrible?” And I think that's always a fun question. And I'm very excited for some new cast members that we've got.\n\nIAN We've got some fun people playing.\n\nLAUREN So yeah. But yeah, James's entrepreneurial ventures are something to be quite excited about.\n\nIAN Genius. Yeah. Now we'll go around and if anybody has anything that they would like to plug, yeah, other projects, other projects are working on that are available or anything you want. We are going to–if you're in the Midwest area this summer, Chris and Lauren and myself will be at the Michigan Shakespeare Festival. Do you want to come see some of us act some Shakespeare? Yeah.\n\nLAUREN I directed an episode of Unwell.\n\nIAN It's so good.\n\nLAUREN For their final season, I was their assistant director and really, really proud of that. It's a fantastic show. It's wrapping up now. So it’s really good time to jump on. I also guest wrote an episode of Where the Stars Fell for their season that's airing right now, which was super fun. It's a body swap episode. So it gets–it's sort of just like a monster of the week silliness type of episode. And it's a great show. So I'm very excited about that. And then we're just working on season two this. Yep. Anybody else? Katie, I know you have another show.\n\nKATIE Yeah, I'm a full time cast member on Dark Nexus, which is a pathfinder actual play podcast and immersive audio experience where a group of longtime friends attempt to survive unspeakable horrors. And Pisa’s Strange Aeons weird horror adventure path. Really fun new episodes every Monday. We're just started back to\n\nLAUREN And who is your DM?\n\nKATIE Our D–I’m sorry it’s a GM.\n\nIAN It's a GM in Pathfinder and Starfinder.\n\nKATIE: It’s Rob Kauzlaric, who is the narrator and Sherlock Holmes on our podcast.\n\nIAN Yeah, also, that show is fucked up.\n\nKATIE I know. You should hear our Patreon-only actual play of the Silent Titans adventure path, which I'm pretty sure you two are familiar with. It is so fucking weird. But it's a great deal of fun to play.\n\nLAUREN Ian got all of us basically killed within one turn. Yeah, so that was fun. That was really cool.\n\nKATIE My character–this is a spoiler, but I just turned into a flock of birds.\n\nLAUREN Yeah, how many? How many is a flock?\n\nKATIE It's…more than you can count. It's so many birds. So I yeah, I turned into a flock of birds and flew away. Got a new character.\n\nJEREMY Yeah, I've got–I'm coming up on, I think it's the next episode that's going to air of Where the Stars Fell for an episode of their season. Yeah, yeah. Not the episode that Lauren worked on. But it was a blast. I play an idiot. Surprise, surprise.\n\nLAUREN With a different accent this time.\n\nJEREMY With a different accent. Yeah.\n\nIAN That's awesome. Chris.\n\nCHRIS Just like you said before, the Michigan Shakespeare Festival. I'll be up there this summer. Along with Ian, Lauren. Sean Pfautsch, who played Archie, will also be there. Yeah. Rob, our narrator, is one of the directors. So yeah, it's gonna be a–there's quite a reunion.\n\nLAUREN Yeah, a lot of us are going to be there.\n\nIAN It's shocking how we all got to know each other. And now we're still working together. How did that happen? Exactly. Friendship and proximity. Two of my favorite ingredients. This is a–that's about it for us on our end. Lauren, do you have anything else you'd like to say before we wrap up?\n\nLAUREN You know, I don't–we will be having another part of this Q&S. That's just Ian and I talking about writer stuff that'll be coming up probably a week after this one comes out and keep an eye out for that. And we will be doing a crossover with Where the Stars Fell, which we're looking at an early fall release, on that one, potentially. And then we will probably be crowdfunding season two of this show and then getting that to you as soon as possible. We're writing it now.\n\nIAN Yeah, absolutely.
