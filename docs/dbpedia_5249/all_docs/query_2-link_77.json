        "text": "August 7, 2024 12:48 PM Subscribe\n\nI recently watched Chastity Bites and it was a movie for adults (or at least teens) that had big Scooby Doo, Nancy Drew, Hardy Boys, Three Investigators, [Insert Series Name here] energy.\n\nIt was:\n\nsilly and camp\n\nnot afraid of groan-worthy jokes\n\nabout an unofficial, too-serious teen investigating a mystery\n\n... and the mystery wasn't just any mystery, it was a monster\n\nat least partly about the interpersonal dynamics between the main character, her best friend, and another dude who gets involved in the case\n\nfilled with sapphic (sub?)text\n\nMy ideal Scooby story is about how the supernatural doesn't exist, but this totally counts even though the monster really was a monster in this case. All they needed was a 5-minute exposition dump about how the main character was Velma in high school before she met the gang, and it could be canon.\n\nIt made me wonder if there are other movies that have big teen investigator energy, without actually being an official Scooby / Nancy Drew / whatever movie.\n\nI'm definitely up for loose interpretations... if there are a dozen attributes that make up a Scooby experience, a movie having 4 of the 12 is probably enough, if the vibes are right.\n\nAbout Ask MetaFilter\n\nAsk MetaFilter is a question and answer site that covers nearly any question on earth, where members help each other solve problems.
