Different patterns of contralesional passive movement fMRI according to pattern of recovery in severe hemiplegic stroke patients.\n\nJi-Young Kim1, Jeehye Seo2, Hui-jin Song2, Seong-Uk Jin2, Jang Woo Park2, Moon Han2, Jong Su Baeck2, Hee-Kyung Kim3, and Yongmin Chang4\n\n1School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Jung-gu, Korea,2Medical & Biological Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Korea,3Applied Chemistry, Kyungpook National University, Korea,4Molecular Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Korea\n\nStroke patients with hand function in severe hemiplegic are known to be determined their prognosis at acute period of stroke. Brunnstrum motor recovery stage (BMS) and motor evoked potential (MEP) have been used to predict prognosis in stroke patients well. Using the BMS and MEP, stroke patients who have no MEP of affected hand or no hand movement with BMS 1 in 4 weeks from onset of stroke were usually regarded as that with poor prognosis. Nevertheless, most patients regarded as poor prognosis could recover their hand function. Recent researchers revealed functional connectivity of homologous primary motor cortex as a prognostic factor in stroke patients. The aim of this study is to (1) compare inter-hemispheric functional connectivity scores with in homologous M1 among stroke patients groups which showed different recovery patterns by means of resting state fMRI and (2) find good prognostic phenomeni to severe hemiplegic stroke patients who had no hand movement with BMS 1 and MEP response by means of fMRI with passive movement.\n\n0803.\n\nImproved DMN connectivity in patients with unilateral stenosis of internal carotid artery after carotid stent placement: A resting-state fMRI study\n\nFeng-Xian Yan1, Tsong-Hai Lee2, Ho-Fai Wong3, and Ho-Ling Liu1,3\n\n1Department of Medical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan,2Department of Neurology and Stroke Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Taoyuan, Taiwan,3Department of Medical Imaging and Intervention, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan\n\nThis study aimed to investigate the default-mode network (DMN) and task-positive network (TPN) connectivity changes in patients with unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis before and after carotid stent placement. Sixteen patients underwent resting-state (RS) fMRI and DSC perfusion MRI scans one week before and six months after stenting. RS functional images were analyzed with seeds defined as a spherical ROI within PCC and a PCC mask. This study found impaired functional connectivity in DMN and TPN, which could recover after the stenting. The results were not directly related to regional perfusion deficits and thus likely linked to the neuronal origins.\n\n0804.\n\nSpontaneous depolarization waves in medetomidine sedated Sprague-Dawley rats detected by fMRI\n\nArtem Shatillo1, Joanna Huttunen1, Antti Airaksinen1, Juha-Pekka Niskanen1,2, and Olli Grohn1\n\n1Department of Neurobiology, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland,2Department of Applied Physics, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland\n\nSpreading depolarization (SD) waves are typically observed only under pathophysiological conditions. We detected spontaneously occurring SDs in 9 Sprague-Dawley rats during 1 hour long BOLD fMRI study under medetomidine sedation. Total of 17 waves were detected lasting for 193.3 � 58.8 sec in one cortical ROI, propagating with speed of 2.93�0.6 mm/min. Observed propagation pattern and involvement of subcortical regions is atypical for �classical� spreading depolarization described in literature and needs further investigations.\n\n0805. Language-related resting state connectivity in aphasia\n\nShiree Heath1, Lyndsey Nickels2, Anthony Angwin3, Anna MacDonald1, Sophia van Hees1, Kori Johnson4, David Copland1, and Katie McMahon4\n\n1Centre for Clinical Research, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia,2Macquarie Centre for Cognitive Science, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia,3School of Health & Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Queensland, St Lucia, Queensland, Australia,4Centre for Advanced Imaging, University of Queensland, St Lucia, Queensland, Australia\n\nThe current study sought to identify differences in resting state connectivity between language-related regions in unimpaired speakers and individuals with aphasia. Results show distinct patterns of connectivity for the two participant groups. Controls demonstrated greater connectivity than participants with aphasia between contralateral regions in the opposite cerebral lobe. Compared to controls, participants with aphasia showed greater connectivity in both ipsilateral and contralateral regions restricted to two specific regions in the temporal and parietal lobes. This pattern may indicate that the major disruption in connectivity for individuals with aphasia exists between homologous regions in the two cerebral hemispheres.\n\n0806. Cerebral responses to Valsalva manoeuvre consists of multiple components reflecting different aspects of autonomic function in patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome\n\nJiabao He1, Julia L Newton2, and Andrew M Blamire1\n\n1Newcastle Magnetic Resonance Centre, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, United Kingdom,2Institue for Ageing and Health, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, United Kingdom\n\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is associated with cognitive problem and autonomic dysfunction, where the patient shows abnormal responses to autonomic challenge such as the Valsalva manoeuvre (VM). Valsalva manoeuvre provokes phased physiological response in blood pressure and cerebral blood flow, resulting in a complex cerebral response.In this work, we conducted dual echo GE fMRI to monitor the tissue water density and cerebral oxygenation level during the VM in CFS patients, and found that the BOLD signal dynamics correlated to measures of autonomic activity. Different components of cerebral reponses are related to various aspects of autonomic control.\n\n0807. Motor dysfunction in Parkinson�s disease and Multiple System Atrophy and the effect of dopamine drug\n\nMohit Saxena1, Senthil S Kumaran2, Vinay Goyal1, and Madhuri Behari1\n\n1Department of Neurology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, Delhi, India,2Department of N.M.R., All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, Delhi, India\n\nSynopsis: Parkinson�s disease (PD) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) are characterized by motor dysfunction. In this fMRI study we tried to observe any difference in the BOLD activation pattern with respect to the progression of the disease, with reference to the effectiveness of the dopaminergic therapy.\n\n0808. A Dynamic Causal Modeling study in empathy for pain stimuli with fibromyalgia\n\nHuijin Song1, JeeHye Seo1, Seonguk Jin1, Hee-Kyung Kim1, Moon-jung Hwang2, Kyung Jin Suh3, and Yongmin Chang4\n\n1Medical & Biological Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea,2GE healthcare, Seoul, Korea,3Radiology, College of Medicine, Dongguk University, Gyungju, Korea,4Medical & Biological Engineering, Diagnostic Radiology, molecular medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea\n\nFibromyalgia(FM) is disorder of unknown etiology1, characterized by chronic widespread pain and are often accompanied by symptoms of sleep disturbance, anxiety, memory problems, fatigue, and exhaustion. Previous functional imaging studies of FM mainly focused on pain by physical stimuli or functional connectivity. However, there is no emotional and cognitive effective connectivity study with FM. Therefore, the aim of this study investigates the effective connectivity using dynamic causal modeling and difference of pain network between FM patient and healthy controls in the empathy for pain stimuli. Based on our finding that the DLPFC delivers controlled pain information and intensity to insula, and insula assesses the information and perceives the pain intensity with ACC. In this study, in patients with FM, the effective connectivity between DLPFC and insula was decreased, but effective connectivity between insula and ACC was increased. Therefore, the role of DLPFC in emotional pain processing is associated with control of pain intensity and inhibitory system. If the DLPFC has a deficit or a dysfunction, patients under chronic pain perceive the more pain intensity than normal.\n\n0809. Primary Visual Cortex Activation Induced by Tactile Stimulation in Individuals with Retinitis Pigmentosa\n\nSamantha I. Cunningham1, James D. Weiland2, Pinglei Bao3, and Bosco S. Tjan3,4\n\n1Dept. of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States,2Dept. of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California,3Neuroscience Graduate Program, University of Southern California,4Dept. of Psychology, University of Southern California\n\nFMRI was used to assess the inter-subject variability of visual cortex reorganization in individuals suffering from retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a degenerative retinal disease resulting in tunnel vision and eventual loss of sight. BOLD responses were measured as RP and sighted control groups completed two tactile discrimination tasks during successive scans in a 3T Siemens scanner. We found that vision deprivation leads to elevated activation of the visual cortex elicited with tactile stimuli, while the degree and location of activation in the primary visual cortex correlates with the degree and location of visual field loss.\n\n0810. Comparison of Ballistocardiac Artifact Removal Algorithms for Detection of IED\n\nSung Suk Oh1, Yeji Han1, Joong Koo Kang2, Eun Mi Lee2, and HyunWook Park1\n\n1Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea,2Neurology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea\n\nA simultaneous recording of electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an effective method for epilepsy diagnosis. Using the temporal information of interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) detected in the EEG signal, the brain region related to the epilepsy can be detected with high spatial resolution in the fMRI data. To detect the IEDs more accurately, however, the measured EEG signal is analyzed after removing the ballistocardiac artifact (BA), which is induced by subject��s heartbeat in a high magnetic field. In this study, three different BA removal methods, such as AAAS (advanced average artifact subtraction [1]), OBS (optimal basis set [2]), and ICA (independent component analysis [3]), were applied to the epilepsy data and their performances were evaluated in terms of preservation and restoration of the IED shapes.\n\n0811. Amplitude of low frequency fluctuations and functional connectivity in resting state fMRI among PTSD\n\nXiaodan YAN1,2, Mariana Lazar1, Victoria Cressman3, Leslie Prichep2, Clare Henn-Haase2, Irene Lee2, Rachel Yehuda4, Thomas Neylan5, Daniel Sodickson1, and Charles Marmar2\n\n1Radiology, New York University, New York, NY, United States,2Department of Psychiatry, New York University, New York, NY, United States,3Department of Psychiatry, Manhattan VA Medical Center, New York, NY, United States,4Department of Psychiatry, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States,5Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States\n\nNeural mechanisms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are increasingly being investigated with neuroimaging techniques; however, previous studies have conflicting findings partly due to the differences in designed tasks and targeted behavioral variables. Using resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI), the present study examined the amplitudes of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) as well as functional connectivity (FC) patterns associated with PTSD among 38 combat veterans (19 diagnosed as PTSD+ and 19 PTSD-, with the two groups matched on age, gender, education level and ethnicity). Compared to the PTSD- group, the PTSD+ group showed significantly decreased ALFF at the thalamus, precuneus, dorsal frontal cortex (DFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and increased ALFF at ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, and ventral frontal cortex (VFC). PTSD+ demonstrated primarily decreases of FC-s, particularly seeded at the thalamus, PCC, precuneus. ALFF values at DFC were negatively correlated with PTSD severity, whereas those at vACC and thalamus were negatively correlated with severity of re-experience symptom. ALFF at insula and VFC were negatively correlated with depression and dissociative symptoms respectively, and those at precuneus were positively correlated with emotion regulation capacity. These results suggest that spontaneous brain activity is associated with PTSD pathology.\n\n0812. Functional Connectivity in Blast-Induced vs. non-Blast-Induced Traumatic Brain Injury\n\nErik B Beall1, Stephen M Rao2, Micheal D Phillips1, and Mark J Lowe1\n\n1Radiology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States,2Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States\n\nTraumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a heterogeneous neurologic disorder. Past research has provided hints that blast-induced TBI represents a distinct clinical subtype, with a distinct injury mechanism causing more widespread and more homogeneous diffuse axonal injury. We compare primary motor cortex functional connectivity in blast-related and non blast-related mild to moderate TBI participants and controls with an orthopedic injury. We find that in blast-TBI participants, subcortical medial thalamic connectivity to primary motor cortex is specifically increased compared to non blast-TBI participants.\n\n0813. A semi-automated fMRI method to determine language lateralisation in neurosurgical candidates\n\nKarlene M Fraser1,2, Ruth O'Gorman2,3, Jozef Jarosz4, Gareth Barker2, and Jonathan Ashmore4\n\n1Neuroimaging, South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom,2Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, London, United Kingdom,3Centre for MR Research, University Children's Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland,4Neuroradiology, King's College Hospital, London, United Kingdom\n\nLanguage fmri is becoming a standalone clinical procedure for the pre-operative assessment of neurosurgical patients, but one possible confound to the interpretation of language fMRI is that the apparent (bi)laterality of language regions depends heavily on the selected statistical threshold. This study aims to develop a simple, semi-automated post-processing method to determine language lateralisation for presurgical fMRI patients. Using this method, laterality index plots were successfully generated for all participants and were in agreement with expert neuroradiological assessment, suggesting that this method provides a simple but robust quantitative assessment of language laterality.\n\n0814. Investigation of a drug with potential fast-onset efficacy in affective disorders: pharmacological MRI of the 5-HT2A receptor agonist psilocyn in the rat.\n\nAisling Spain1, Alexandre Khrapitchev1, Trevor Sharp2, Nicola R. Sibson1, and Chris Martin1\n\n1Gray Institute for Radiation Oncology and Biology, University of Oxford, Oxford, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom,2Department of Pharmacology, University of Oxford, Oxford, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom\n\nExisting pharmacological treatments for affective disorders suffer from a lack of acute efficacy. Hallucinogenic drugs are potentially useful as treatments for depression and anxiety disorders, however further investigation of their physiological effects is necessary. To understand the acute effects of hallucinogen administration in vivo, 4 male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered the serotonin 2A receptor agonist, psilocyn and underwent BOLD imaging. Increases in BOLD signal were observed in prefrontal and subcortical areas, in structures implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. These results illustrate the utility of fMRI in screening drugs for acute efficacy in mood disorders.\n\n0815. Using Reliability to Predict Validity in Clinical fMRI\n\nTynan Reid Stevens1, Steven D Beyea1, Ryan CN D'Arcy1, and David B Clarke2\n\n1IBD-Atlantic, NRC, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada,2QEII Health Science Centre, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada\n\nThe accuracy of presurgical fMRI is inherently related to the threshold method used to create the activation maps. We aim to demonstrate that choosing thresholds that optimize reproducibility leads to high correspondence with the gold standard, cortical stimulation (CS). Eleven patients were tested by presurgical fMRI, and observed while CS was performed in the operating room. Functional MRI maps were optimized for reliability, and the distance from each CS point to the nearest activated voxel was calculated. Reliability optimization reduced the CS-to-fMRI distance by 1-8 mm compared with traditional threshold methods.\n\n0816. Limbic scars: Functional and structural MRI reveal long-term consequences of childhood maltreatment\n\nHarald Kugel1, Anja Stuhrmann2, Victoria Beutelmann2, Peter Zwanzger2, Thomas Lenzen2, Dominik Grotegerd2, Katharina Domschke2, Christa Hohoff2, Patricia Ohrmann2, Jochen Bauer2, Christian Lindner2, Christian Postert2,3, Carsten Konrad4, Walter Heindel1, Volker Arolt2, Thomas Suslow5, and Udo Dannlowski2\n\n1Department of Clinical Radiology, University of Muenster, Muenster, NRW, Germany,2Department of Psychiatry, University of Muenster, Muenster, NRW, Germany,3Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Muenster, Muenster, NRW, Germany,4Department of Psychiatry, University of Marburg, Marburg, HE, Germany,5Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, SN, Germany\n\nChildhood maltreatment is a strong risk factor for the development of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in later live. In this study, the neurobiological bases of these associations were investigated. Both, depression and PTSD have been associated with increased amygdala responsiveness to negative stimuli as well as reduced hippocampal gray matter volume, therefore we speculated that childhood maltreatment results in similar functional and structural alterations in previously maltreated but at present healthy adults. fMRI and voxel-based morphometry were applied to investigate the alterations.\n\n0817. Lateralization of temporal lobe epilepsy using resting fMRI connectivity mapping\n\nVictoria L. Morgan1, Hasan H. Sonmezturk2, John C. Gore1, and Bassel Abou-Khalil2\n\n1Vanderbilt University Institute of Imaging Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States,2Neurology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States\n\nTemporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common form of epilepsy in which seizures originate from the hippocampus and adjacent structures. Resection of these structures can effectively reduce or eliminate seizures when onset is accurately lateralized. We investigated resting fMRI connectivity from each hippocampus in controls and TLE patients who were seizure free after surgery. A network between the right hippocampus and the ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus was detected that potentially distinguishes between patients with left and right hippocampal seizure onset with high sensitivity and specificity. If validated, this technique may be practical to include in MRI presurgical examinations.\n\n0818. Histological Basis of Diffusely Abnormal White Matter in Multiple Sclerosis: Evidence for a Primary Lipid Abnormality\n\nCornelia Laule1,2, Vlady Pavlova1, David K.B. Li2,3, Guojun Zhao2, Piotr Kozlowski2, Anthony L. Traboulsee3, and G.R. W. Moore1,3\n\n1Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada,2Radiology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada,3Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada\n\nGiven the potential prognostic importance of non-lesional white matter abnormalities in MS, histological studies are warranted to elucidate the pathology underlying the MRI-defined phenomena of diffusely abnormal white matter (DAWM). Post-mortem MS brain was examined with multi-echo T2 relaxation and histological staining. DAWM showed substantial decreases in myelin water fraction (-30%) and myelin phospholipids (-29%, -24%), with much less involvement of the myelin proteins (-11% to -5%). Lesions demonstrated more severe abnormalities than DAWM, with decreases in both myelin lipids and proteins. Our findings are consistent with a primary lipid abnormality that antedates myelin protein loss in DAWM.\n\n0819. Total sodium concentration is increased in lesions and normal appearing white matter in Multiple Sclerosis\n\nDavid Paling1, Bhavana Solanky1, Frank Riemer1, Claudia AM Wheeler-Kingshott1, Raju Kapoor1, David H Miller1, and Xavier Golay2\n\n1NMR Research Unit, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, London, United Kingdom,2NMR Research Unit, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, London, United Kingdom\n\nMapping total sodium concentration in multiple sclerosis (MS) may be a useful method of assessing pathophysiological processes including increase in intracellular sodium concentration, and increase in proportion of higher sodium concentration extracellular fluid from axonal loss. We acquired total sodium concentration maps in 10 patients with MS, and 6 controls. Increased sodium was seen in lesions as compared to the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in MS (48.6mM vs 36.6mM, p<0.001) and in NAWM in MS as compared to controls (38.1mM vs 35.5mM, P=0.09). Further studies are underway to understand the pathophysiological significance of these findings\n\n0820. Combining SIENA and SIENAx for improved quantification of grey and white matter atrophy\n\nMishkin Derakhshan1, Sridar Narayanan1, D. Louis Collins1, and Douglas L Arnold1\n\n1Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada\n\nWe propose a novel technique for a more sensitive measurement of tissue-specific atrophy by combining the precise, longitudinal edge-displacement approach of SIENA with the tissue classification feature of SIENAx. The method is evaluated using (1) scan-rescan data and (2) simulated atrophy data and (3) is applied to a multi-centre relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis dataset.\n\n0821. Lesion Morphology at 7 Tesla MRI differentiates Susac Syndrome from Multiple Sclerosis\n\nTim Sinnecker1, Jens Wuerfel2,3, Thoralf Niendorf4, Friedemann Paul2,5, Ilka Kleffner6, and Jan D�rr2,5\n\n1NeuroCure Clinical Research Center, Charit�-Universit�tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Berlin, Germany,2NeuroCure Clinical Research Center, Charit�-Universit�tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany,3Institute of Neuroradiology, University of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany,4Berlin Ultrahigh Field Facility, Max Delbrueck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany,5Clinical and Experimental Multiple Sclerosis Research Center, Charit�-Universit�tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany,6Department of Neurology, University of M�nster, M�nster, Germany\n\nClinical and paraclinical findings including MRI findings at 1.5 T MRI in Susac syndrome often enough overlap with respective findings in MS. In fact, many patients with Susac syndrome are misdiagnosed as having MS. Realizing the brilliant signal to noise ratio at 7 T, we here studied 4 patients affected with Susac syndrome, and report substantial differences in both deep white matter and corpus callosum lesion morphology between Susac syndrome and MS. Our data i) suggest that lesion morphology at 7T supports differentiation between Susac syndrome and MS and ii) provide new insights into the pathophysiological mechanism underlying Susac syndrome.\n\n0822. Quasar arterial spin labelled MRI shows increase in white matter arterial transit time and perfusion in MS\n\nDavid Paling1, Esben T Petersen2, Daniel J Tozer1, Claudia AM Wheeler-Kingshott1, Raju Kapoor1, David H Miller1, and Xavier Golay3\n\n1NMR Research Unit, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, London, United Kingdom,2University Medical Center, Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands,3NMR Research Unit, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabiliation, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, London, United Kingdom\n\nAlteration in cerebral blood flow (CBF) has been noted in MS, however whether this represents change in metabolic demand, or dysregulation of perfusion control mechanisms is not established. We used the QUASAR arterial spin labelling sequence which simultaneously quantifies CBF and arterial transit time (ATT), the time taken for labelled arterial blood to transit to the capillaries, in patients with relapsing remitting MS and healthy controls. Increase in white matter ATT (1.1 vs 0.94s, P=0.05) and CBF (20.4 vs 17.1 mls min-1, p=0.02), and increase in grey matter ATT (0.99 vs 0.85s, p=0.05) was seen in MS. These findings suggest alteration in perfusion control in MS.\n\n0823. Multi-modal post mortem MRI at 7T to detect and quantify multiple sclerosis cortical grey matter pathology\n\nOlivier E. Mougin1, Niraj Mistry2, Penny A Gowland1, Nikos Evangelou2, and Klaus Schmierer3\n\n1Sir Peter Mansfield Magnetic Resonance Centre, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, Select, United Kingdom,2Institute of Neuroscience, Nottingham, Select, United Kingdom,3Barts and The London School of Medicine & Dentistry, Blizard Institute, Centre for Neuroscience & Trauma (Neuroimmunology Group), London, United Kingdom\n\nTo explore their potential to detect cortical grey matter pathology we acquired T2 weighted (T2w), T2*w, double inversion recovery, phase-sensitive inversion recovery, and magnetization transfer ratio using fixed post mortem MS brain. Voxels of 0.35mm isotropic gave a clear delineation of the grey matter, both non-lesional and lesional. Our results suggest T2w and T2*w MRI are currently the best techniques to detect cortical grey matter lesions in post mortem MS brain.\n\n0824. Brain morphometry in late-infantile Metachromatic Leukodystrophy\n\nSamuel Groeschel1,2, Christine i Dali3, Philipp Clas2, Christiane Kehrer1, Marko Wilke1,2, and Ingeborg Kr�geloh-Mann1\n\n1Department of Pediatric Neurology & Developmental Medicine, University Children's Hospital, Tuebingen, Germany,2Experimental Pediatric Neuroimaging, University Children's Hospital, Tuebingen, Germany,3Department of Clinical Genetics, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nMetachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) is a metabolic disorder leading to demyelination and neurological deterioration. We assessed cerebral gray and white matter volume as well as the volume of demyelination in relation to disease course, using a multispectral MRI segmentation approach (T1w and T2w). Eighteen patients with late-infantile MLD and 48 typically developing children of the same age range (20-59months) were analyzed. Interestingly, in MLD patients GM volume was found to be reduced already early during disease course, when their WM volume did not differ. Demyelination load increased with disease duration and motor deterioration. This may serve as reference for therapeutic intervention.\n\n0825. Multi-channel registration of FA and T1-weighted images to standard space: patients with Multiple Sclerosis\n\nEloy Roura1, Torben Schneider2, Pankaj Daga3, Marc Modat3, Nils Muhlert2, Jordi Freixenet1, Declan Chard2, S�bastien Ourselin3, Xavier Llad�1, and Claudia A M Wheeler-Kingshott2\n\n1Computer Vision and Robotics Group, Department of Computer Architecture, University of Girona, Girona, Spain,2NMR Research unit. Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, United Kingdom,3Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London, London, United Kingdom\n\nIn this work, we tested the performance of 4D multi-channel registration of T1-weighted (T1w) scans and diffusion tensor (DT) data to standard space in Multiple Sclerosis and healthy subjects. The Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template was chosen as target. We compared results with single-modality registration (3D) to their corresponding template. For healthy subjects the 4D multi-channel approach performed as well as the 3D approach when co-registering T1w and DT images to MNI atlas space independently. For patients the multi-channel approach improved the co-registration in the boundaries of the ventricles and also in the cortex compared to the 3D approach.\n\n0826. Histogram analysis of Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity: Distinguishing Tumefactive Demyelinating Lesions from High-Grade Glioma using DTI\n\nB. LIU1, X. LIU2, W. TIAN3, T. Zhu4, S. Ekholm5, and J. ZHONG4\n\n1Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, United States,2Department of Radiology, University of Rochester, United States,3Department of Radiology, University of Rochester, Rochester, United States,4Imaging Sciences, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, United States,5Department of Radiology, University of Rochester\n\nIt is of significant clinical importance to differentiate between Tumefactive demyelinating lesions (TDLs)and high-grade gliomas(HGGs) to avoid surgical biopsy. However, this goal is difficult to achieve by conventional MR imaging alone. The objective of our study is to determine retrospectively whether quantitative histogram analysis of FA and MD values can be helpful in distinguishing between TDLs and HGGs. We compare the FA value and MD value for both enhanced Tumefactive demyelinating lesions(TDLs) and enhanced high grade glioma(HGGs) with the matched location. Results showed that TDLs and HGGs could be differentiated by using the histogram method.\n\n0827. Decreased Creatine in NAWM Suggest a Reduced Gliosis in Natalizumab Treated MS Patients\n\nAnders Tisell1,2, Johan Mellerg�rd3,4, Olof Dahlqvist Leinhard1,2, Charlotte Dahle5, Jan Ernerudh6, Magnus Vrethem7, Anne Marie Landtblom3,4, and Peter Lundberg2,8\n\n1Division of Radiological Sciences, Department of Medicine and Health Sciences, Link�ping University, Link�ping, Sweden,2Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization (CMIV), Link�ping University, Link�ping, Sweden,3Neurology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Division of Neuroscience, Link�ping University, Link�ping, Sweden,4Neurology Clinic, UHL, County Council of �sterg�tland, Link�ping, Sweden,5Clinical Immunology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Link�ping University, Link�ping,6Clinical Immunology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Link�ping University, Link�ping, Sweden,7Neurology and Clinical Neurophsiology, Department of Clincal and Experimental Medicine, Link�ping University, Link�ping, Sweden,8Depts of Radiation Physics, Link�ping University and Radiation Physics, UHL, County Council of �sterg�tland, Link�ping, Sweden\n\nAbsolute quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used for assessing the effects of natalizumab treatment on the metabolism in normal appearing white matter of MS patients. A significant change in creatine concentrations during extended treatment (three years) was observed. As creatine is more abundant in glia cells than in neurons this change suggests a reduction of glia concentration. Although higher concentrations of myo-inositol, choline containing compounds and total glutamine+glutamate were observed in the patients compered to healthy controls, the concentrations did not change in the patients as a consequence of the therapy.\n\n0828. Automatic lesion detection in white and grey matter using T1-weighted and FLAIR images\n\nJavier Gonz�lez-Zabaleta1, Norberto Malpica1, Ana Ramos2, Juan �lvarez-Linera3, and Juan Antonio Hern�ndez-Tamames1\n\n1Neuroimaging lab., Center for Biomedical Technology, Universidad Polit�cnica de Madrid and Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Pozuelo de Alarc�n, Madrid, Spain,2Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain,3Hospital Ruber Internacional, Madrid, Spain\n\nCortical lesions in multiple sclerosis are characterized by simultaneous hiperintensity in FLAIR images and hypointensity in T1 images. We have developed a method for automatic lesion detection that includes tissue segmentation correction, lesion detection and quantification. We have evaluated the technique in a study on Multiple Sclerosis, including 21 controls and 15 patients. All subjects were correctly classified with our method. All the algorithms have been included in a plugin for 3D Slicer.\n\n0829. Cervical cord lesion characterisation in Multiple sclerosis (MS): A pilot study with application to MTR\n\nMarios C Yiannakas1, Hugh Kearney1, Olga Ciccarelli2, David H Miller1, and Claudia A.M Wheeler-Kingshott1\n\n1Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom,2Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom\n\nThis study proposes a pipeline from acquisition to data analysis to characterise for the first time multiple sclerosis lesions in the cervical cord from MR images acquired with different contrasts. Proton density (PDw) and T1-weighted (T1w) images are acquired. Lesions are segmented using established methodologies. Magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR) measurements of the lesions, normal appearing white-matter (NAWM) and grey-matter (NAGM) are obtained and compared with healthy controls. The mean MTR of PDw lesions is very similar to the T1w lesions but more lesional tissue is visible on the PDw images than T1w.\n\n0830. Strength of connectivity to the anterior cingulate predicts processing speed in Multiple Sclerosis\n\nKatherine A Koenig1, Erik B Beall1, Jian Lin1, Blessy Mathew1, Lael Stone2, Robert Bermel2, Stephen Rao3, Bruce Trapp4, Micheal D Phillips1, and Mark J Lowe1\n\n1Imaging Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, United States,2Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, United States,3Schey Center for Cognitive Neuroimaging, Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, United States,4Neurosciences, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, United States\n\nIt has been shown that functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) from the anterior cingulate (ACC) shows correlation with cognitive function in MS. In the current study, fcMRI from the ACC for 47 MS patients and 24 healthy controls was correlated with performance on the SDMT. In patients, SDMT performance was significantly correlated with right ACC connectivity to the left caudate (r = 0.55, p=0.00006) and inversely correlated with right ACC connectivity to the left medial frontal gyrus (r = -.64, p=0.000001). Controls showed no significant correlations.\n\n0831. 1.5T versus 3.0T MRI texture analysis in the normal appearing white matter of multiple sclerosis patients\n\nYunyan Zhang1, and Luanne M Metz2\n\n1Depts of Radiology and Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada,2Dept of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada\n\nTen MS patients were imaged at both 1.5T and 3.0T within 48 hours using identical MRI protocols. T2-weighted MRI were corrected for non-uniformity and then were co-registered between scanners. Pixel-wise MRI texture was computed using polar Stockwell transform, from which the texture of normal appearing white matter (NAWM) regions were extracted. There was a similar pattern of regional variability in NAWM structures between field strength while texture heterogeneity was generally greater at 3.0T. No texture laterality was seen between bi-hemispheric NAWM. Texture analysis may be feasible at different scanners with different field strength by controlling for contralateral NAWM.\n\n0832. Characterizing Normal Appearing and Diseased White Matter in Multiple Sclerosis Using Quantitative MRI\n\nJanne West1,2, Anne Aalto2,3, J. B. M. Warntjes2,4, Olof Dahlqvist Leinhard1,2, Anne-Marie Landtblom2,5, �rjan Smedby2,6, and Peter Lundberg1,2\n\n1Department of Radiation Physics, Link�ping University, Link�ping, Sweden,2Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization, Link�ping, Sweden,3Division of Diagnostic Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Link�ping University, V�stervik, Sweden,4Department of Clinical Physiology, Link�ping University, Link�ping, Sweden,5Department of Neurology, Link�ping University, Link�ping, Sweden,6Department of Radiology, Link�ping University, Link�ping, Sweden\n\nSubtle regions of diffuse signal intensity are often seen in T2-weighted images of MS patients. These regions, not attributable to normal appearing white matter (NAWM) or WM-lesions are called dirty-appearing white matter (DAWM). Recent studies have proposed that these regions may be an important marker for disease progression. In this study it was investigated if quantitative MR could be used to identify DAWM in a group of 10 MS patients. DAWM was compared to NAWM, WM-lesions and healthy white matter in a control group. This study indicates that DAWM may be a different pathological process detectable by quantitative MRI.\n\n0833. Cerebellar Peduncles Intrinsic Damage in Multiple Sclerosis: Association With Clinical Disabilty\n\nPaolo Preziosa1, Maria A. Rocca1, Sarlota Mesaros2, Elisabetta Pagani1, Tatjana Stosic-Opincal3, Jelena Drulovic2, Giancarlo Comi4, and Massimo Filippi1\n\n1Neuroimaging Research Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy, Italy,2Clinic of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Yugoslavia,3Clinic of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Yugoslavia,4Department of Neurology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy, Italy\n\nA voxel-wise analysis to diffusion tensor (DT) MRI tractography and T2 lesions metrics of the middle (M) and superior (S) cerebellar peduncles (CP) was applied to quantify their structural damage in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and to assess its relationship with clinical disability. Compared to healthy controls, MS patients showed widespread diffusivity abnormalities along these tracts, which were more pronounced in clinically impaired patients. Compared to unimpaired patients, patients with overall and cerebellar clinical impairment had a higher probability of having T2 lesions in CPs. MS-related clinical impairment is due to both focal damage and diffuse white matter tract injury.\n\n0834. Patterns of regional gray matter atrophy associated to PASAT and SDMT performances in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis patients\n\nGianna Riccitelli1, Maria A. Rocca1, Elisabetta Pagani1, Vittorio Martinelli2, Marta Radaelli2, Andrea Falini3, Giancarlo Comi2, and Massimo Filippi1\n\n1Neuroimaging Research Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy, Italy,2Department of Neurology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy, Italy,3Department of Neuroradiology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy, Italy\n\nWe assessed the correlation between the regional distribution of gray matter (GM) atrophy and performances at the symbol digit modalities (SDMT) and paced auditory serial addition (PASAT) tests in 51 relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients. PASAT scores were correlated with GM atrophy in the caudate nuclei, the cerebellum and several regions mainly located in the fronto-temporo-parietal lobes, while SDMT scores were correlated with GM atrophy in the left cingulum, the parietal lobes and the bilateral cerebellum. The results suggest that deficits at SDMT and PASAT are associated to distinct patterns of regional distribution of GM atrophy in RRMS.\n\n0835.\n\nDetection of Radiation Therapy Induced Cerebral Microbleeds in Gliomas: Does High Field Mean High Yield?\n\nWei Bian1,2, Christopher Hess1, Susan Chang3, Sarah Nelson1,2, and Janine Lupo1\n\n1Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States,2Joint Graduate Program in Bioengineering, University of California San Francisco & Berkeley, San Francisco, CA, United States,3Neurological Surgery, University of California San Francisco\n\nThe goal of this study was to compare the detection of radiation-induced cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in glioma patients between 3T and 7T and magnitude and SWI reconstructions. Ten patients who received prior radiation therapy were scanned using T2*-weighted gradient-echo imaging at both 3T and 7T. Our results showed that although the sensitivity of CMB identification increases with field strength, the heighted susceptibility artifacts present at 7T often limited their detection. To achieve the highest detection rate of CMBs for these patients, SWI should be utilized even at 7T, and tumor location should be considered when deciding field strength.\n\n0836. Analysis of1H MRSI data of brain tumours usingLCModel and whole tissue representations\n\nFelix Raschke1, and Franklyn Howe1\n\n1Clinical Sciences, St George's University of London, London, United Kingdom\n\nThis study takes forward recently published work using the widespread analysis tool LCModel for the analysis of 2D MRSI data of gliomas. LCModel is designed to estimate individual metabolite proportions by fitting a linear combination of metabolite spectra to an in vivo MR spectrum, but here is used to fit representations of grade II and grade IV tumour spectra and normal white matter. Colormaps and histograms are used to visualize the fitted tissue proportions and allow the clear discrimination of grade II and grade IV gliomas.\n\n0837. Persistent Restricted Diffusion Abnormalities in bevacizumab-treated Glioma Patients: Relationship to Outcomes\n\nSandy Mong1, Ben M Ellingson2, Timothy F Cloughesy3, Kim J Hyun4, Albert Lai3, Phioanh Leia Nghiemphu3, Leili Mirsadraei5, William H Yong5, and Whitney B Pope4\n\n1Radiology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, United States,2UCLA,3Neurology, UCLA,4Radiology, UCLA,5Pathology, UCLA\n\nThe aim of this study was to characterize the evolution and prognostic significance of persistent diffusion restriction abnormalities in patients with malignant glioma treated with bevacizumab. These patients demonstrated greater time to progression, time to survival from initiation of bevacizumab treatment and overall survival compared to matched controls. Advanced imaging correlated these diffusion signal abnormalities with hypoperfusion and decreased activity on PET scans. Histopathological examination of a resection specimen confirmed necrosis in one patient. Thus, the presence of diffusion restricted lesions in patients with malignant glioma appears to reflect treatment effect rather than hypercellular tumor in a majority of cases.\n\n0838. Spinal cord MR spectroscopy in neoplastic lesions\n\nAndreas Hock1, Fuchs Alexander1, Peter Boesiger1, Anke Henning1, and Spyros S. Kollias2\n\n1University and ETH Zurich, Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Zurich, Switzerland,2Institute of Neuroradiology, University Hospital of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland\n\nSingle voxel 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides information about biochemical processes of neuronal tissue which is complementary to conventional MRI examinations and is therefore a promising tool for investigation of various spinal cord pathologies. In this work, a protocol for spinal cord MRS allowing robust and high quality spinal cord acquisitions was developed. The results show specific changes in the metabolite fingerprint of tumor patients compared to controls and patients suffering from multiple sclerosis.\n\n0839. Characterization of Brain Tumours with Spin-Spin Relaxation: Preliminary Investigations Reveal Unique T2 Distribution Profiles\n\nCornelia Laule1,2, Thorarin A Bjarnason2,3, Irene M Vavasour2, Anthony L Traboulsee4, G.R. W. Moore1,5, David K.B. Li2,5, and Alex L MacKay2,6\n\n1Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada,2Radiology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada,3Diagnostic Imaging Services, Interior Health, Kelowna, BC, Canada,4Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada,5Medicine (Neurology), University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada,6Physics & Astronomy, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada\n\nOur case study attempts to better define the distribution of T2 components in 3 different types of human brain tumours (glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma, meningioma). We used a 48-echo T2 relaxation sequence and employed no apriori assumptions about the number of exponential components contributing to the T2 decay. T2 relaxation time was increased in tumour and each tumour showed a distinct T2 distribution profile. Tumours have complex and unique compartmentalization characteristics and multi-echo T2relaxation may be useful in evaluating different classes of brain tumours on the basis of their T2 distribution profile. Further study with a larger sample size is warranted.\n\n0840. Multivariate pattern analysis of in vivo MR imaging parameters for detecting transformations to a higher grade in patients with recurrent low grade gliomas\n\nAlexandra Constantin1, Llewellyn Jalbert1, Adam Elkhaled2, Rupa Parvataneni2, Annette Molinaro2, Joanna Phillips2, Soonmee Cha2, Susan M. Chang2, and Sarah J. Nelson2\n\n1University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States,2University of California, San Francisco\n\nA multivariate diagnostic model was built to estimate the probability that a recurrent low grade glioma had progressed to a higher grade based on in vivo MR imaging parameters. The model was able to discriminate between recurrent low grade gliomas that upgraded versus those that remained grade 2 with 93% cross-validation accuracy and 84% bootstrapping accuracy, based on the 75th percentile normalized choline height, the 25th percentile recovery to baseline of the perfusion susceptibility curve, the 75th percentile ratio of choline to n-acetylaspartate height, and the maximum choline height inside the T2 lesion.\n\n0841. DSC-MRI PERFUSION IN HIGH GRADE CEREBRAL TUMORS: SOLUTION OF LEAKAGE EFFECTS IN A SIMPLE CLINICAL IMAGE PROCESSING PROTOCOL.\n\nGuy Umberto Poloni1, Enrico Marchioni2, Giovanni Magenes3, and Gloria Castellazzi4\n\n1Neuroradiology, Fondazione \"Istituto Neurologico Casimiro Mondino\" IRCCS, Pavia, PV, Italy,2Neurology, Fondazione \"Istituto Neurologico Casimiro Mondino\" IRCCS, Pavia, PV, Italy,3Bioengineering Department, Universita' degli Studi di Pavia, Pavia, 27100, Italy,4Bioengineering Department, Universita' degli Studi di Pavia, Pavia, PV, Italy\n\nDSC-MRI represents the widespread approach in neuroradiology for the PWI of cerebral tumors, limited in its efficacy by the breakdown of the BBB associated to high grade cerebral tumors. A multi-parametric approach was adopted to overcome technical limitations of the technique on 30 consecutive untreated patients affected by glioma of grades ranging from II to IV. A voxel-wise analysis of the perfusion T2* relaxivity curves, adopting a higher number of parameters than standard and an increasing level of sophistication of the pre-analysis, was performed demonstrating an improved sensitivity to cerebral hemodynamic alterations, particularly in regions where BBB injury occurs.\n\n0842. Evaluation of a new multimodality voxel-based imaging biomarker for therapeutic response assessment in GBM\n\nBenjamin Lemasson1, Thomas Chenevert1, Theodore Lawrence2, Christina Tsien2, Pia Sundgren3, Charles Meyer1,4, Larry Junck5, Jennifer Boes1, Jean-Christophe Brisset1, Stefanie Galb�n2, Timothy Johnson6, Alnawaz Rehemtulla1, Brian Ross1, and Craig Galb�n1\n\n1Radiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States,2Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States,3Radiology, University of Michigan, Ann arbor, Michigan, United States,4Biomedical, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States,5Neurology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States,6Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States\n\nThe purpose was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of MRI based T1 and rCBV maps analyzed using a new multi-parametric response map (mPRM) base on a voxel-based analysis for early chemoradiation response prediction in patients diagnosed with high-grade gliomas. The percentage change, PRM and mPRM techniques using T1 and rCBVmap were used to assessed tumor response 1 and 3 weeks mid-treatment of 23 patients bearing glioma. mPRMT1+/rCBV- significantly identified patients resistant irrespective of tumor volume delineation and the time point mid-treatment used. This new approach could become a powerful tool to analyze multiparametric and/or multimodal data.\n\n0843. Measurement of 2-hydroxyglutarate in gliomas by optimized 1H-MRS at 3.0 T\n\nChangho Choi1, Sandeep Ganji1, Abhishek Banerjee1, Ivan Dimitrov1,2, Ralph DeBerardinis1, Craig Malloy1, Bruce Mickey1, Robert Bachoo1, and Elizabeth Maher1\n\n1University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, United States,2Philips Medical Systems\n\nWe report noninvasive measurement of an oncometabolite, 2-hydroxuglutarate, in gliomas by TE-optimized 1H-MRS at 3T in vivo. The PRESS TE was optimized, with numerical and phantom analyses, as 97 ms for maximizing the 2HG multiplet at 2.25 ppm. This method was applied in 19 glioma patients, together with short-TE PRESS (35 ms). 2HG was detectable by both methods, but CRLB was smaller in the TE = 97 ms data than in the TE = 35 ms data. The TE = 97 ms method, with properly-calculated basis sets, may provide reliable detection of elevated 2HG compared to the short-TE method.\n\n0844. Early Serial Functional Diffusion Mapping in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma During Combined Chemoradiation and Anti-angiogenic Treatment\n\nPavlina Polaskova1, Marco C. Pinho1, Kyrre E. Emblem1, Jayashree Kalpathy-Cramer1, Dominique Jennings1, Elizabeth Gerstner2, A. Gregory Sorensen3, Alexander S.R. Guimaraes1, and Tracy T. Batchelor2\n\n1A.A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging / Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, Massachusetts, United States,2Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center / Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts,3Radiology, Harvard Medical School\n\nSerial graded functional diffusion maps (fDM) provide a new insight into a glioblastoma patient�s response to therapy. It is challenging to choose one early time-point that would accurately predict the response to therapy, because the timing of significant changes (anti-vascular effect vs anti-tumor effect) is strongly dependent on the type of therapy. By looking at multiple time-points, our longitudinal assessment allows us to show early trends rather than one-time imaging changes. We found that continuous relative decrease in ADC at early time-points as shown by longitudinal FDM is associated with shorter survival.\n\n0845. 2-Hydroxyglutarate in Gliomas with IDH Gene Mutation Using High Resolution 1H-NMR Spectroscopy of Tissue Extracts\n\nH-M. Baek1, I. Marin-Valencia1, T. Mashimo1, Z. Zhao1, R. DeBerardinis1, R. Bachoo1, C. Malloy1,2, and E. Meher1\n\n1UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, United States,2VA North Texas Health Care System\n\nThis study represents, to our knowledge, the first in vitro measurements of absolute quantification of 2HG levels in IDH1/2 mutated tumors using high resolution 1H-NMR spectroscopy. The levels of 2HG in this work had a range of 0.55 - 3.51 mol/g from seven glioma samples with IDH1/2 mutation (e.g., 3 WHO grade II and 4 WHO grade III). In addition, Glu levels were found to be lower in IDH1/2 mutant tumors compared to IDH1/2 wild type tumors (P < 0.0001). This result may reflect that IDH mutations cause a decrease in Glu and/or -ketoglutarate production and an increase in 2HG.\n\n0846. Contrast leakage in high grade glioma measured with independent component analysis of dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI\n\nPeter S LaViolette1, Alex D Cohen2, and Kathleen M Schmainda1,2\n\n1Radiology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States,2Biophysics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States\n\nThis study measures the difference between the two separate contrast agent boluses in patients with high-grade glioma using regions of interest (ROIs) defined by a novel unbiased independent component analysis (ICA) approach.\n\n0847. Survival Analysis for Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Measures in Children with Embryonal Brain Tumours\n\nMatthew Grech-Sollars1, Dawn E Saunders2, Kim P Phipps3, Jonathan D Clayden1, and Chris A Clark1\n\n1Imaging and Biophysics Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health, London, London, United Kingdom,2Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, London, United Kingdom,3Department of Neuro-oncology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, London, United Kingdom\n\nApparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) measures have been shown to be related to tumour cellularity. We measured the gradient change in ADC values from the oedema into the tumour core (ATCT) in 58 children with embryonal brain tumours and correlated this with survival. More negative values of ATCT were found to be related to a lower survival probability. ATCT was shown to be a sensitive biomarker that correlated with survival in childhood embryonal brain tumours.\n\n0848. Ex-vivo infiltrative brain tumor histologically correlates with decreased ADC and increased rCBV as measured with functional diffusion and perfusion maps\n\nPeter S. LaViolette1, Melissa A Prah1, Mona Al-Gizawiy1, Elizabeth J Cochran2, Scott D. Rand3, Jennifer Connelly4, Mark G. Malkin5, Wade M Mueller6, and Kathleen M Schmainda7\n\n1Radiology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States,2Pathology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States,3Radiology, Medical College of Wisconsin,4Neurology, Medical College of Wisconsin,5Neurology & Neurosurgery, Medical College of Wisconsin,6Neurosurgery, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States,7Radiology and Biophysics, Medical College of Wisconsin\n\nThe aim of this study was to examine areas of overlapping dark ADC and bright rCBV in a human case of high grade glioma and compare to ex-vivo tissue acquired following death in this case report.\n\n0849. Predicting spatial patterns of recurrence for glioblastoma using multi-parametric MRI classification\n\nVanessa H. Clark1, Michel Bilello1, Priyanka Bhatt1, Xiao Da1, Elias Melhem1, Arastoo Vossough1, Ron Wolf1, Christos Davatzikos1, and Ragini Verma1\n\n1Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States\n\nWe aim to provide a spatial map of predicted tumor recurrence in subjects with glioblastoma which can be used to guide treatment towards improving quality of life and survival. Using 14 subjects and 9 imaging modalities, we use support vector machine classification to generate a probability map representing tissue with imaging characteristics similar to recurring/non-recurring tissues. With average 97% specificity, 27% sensitivity, and 0.79 AUC, these probability maps show potential for multimodal imaging and classification to predict patterns of tissues likely to recur that are not obvious to the human eye, including prediction of tumor recurrence at specific time intervals.\n\n0850. Correlation of MRI-OEF and PET-OEF neuroimaging data for study of hypoxia in brain tumors\n\nParinaz Massoumzadeh1, Hongyu An2, Joshua Shimony1, Dhanashree Rajderkar1, Anna Carlson1, Jon Christensen1, Zhang Xiaodong2, Daniel Marcus1, Keith Rich3, and Tammie Benzinger1\n\n1Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, United States,2Department of Radiology, University of North Carolina, School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, United States,3Neurosurgery, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, United States\n\nCerebral hypoxia can potentially impact treatment outcome and brain tumor patient survival. Preliminary results of a non-contrast MR procedure for measuring brain and brain tumoral OEF are presented and compared with the results obtain using the noninvasive 15O-PET technique. Although good correlation between OEF-MR and OEF-PET is obtained, and both method show abnormality in tumor area, some discrepancy between the two methods is observed which requires further investigation.\n\n0851. Comparision of 3D pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (PC-ASL) with dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) perfusion MRI\n\nRakesh Kumar Gupta1, Rishi Awasthi1, Prativa Sahoo2, Bhaswati Roy1, Sanjay Behari3, Bal Kishan Ojha4, Nuzhat Husain5,6, and Ram KS Rathore2\n\n1Radiodiagnosis, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India,2Mathematics & Statistics, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India,3Neurosurgery, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India,4Neurosurgery, Chatrapati Sahu ji Maharaj Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India,5Pathology, Chatrapati Sahu ji Maharaj Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India,6Pathology, Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of medical Sciences, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India\n\nForty (27 male and 13 female; mean age=43 yrs) untreated consecutive patients (25 high grades & 15 low grades on histopathology) with a postoperative diagnosis of either high or low grade glioma were imaged using 3D PC-ASL and DCE MRI. On Student�s independent t-test, all the DCE derived metrics except ve (p=0.29) were found to be significantly higher in high grade as compared to low grade glioma (p<0.001), whereas ASL derived CBF did not show any significant differences (p=0.62). We conclude that DCE-MRI proved to be superior in differentiating high grade from low grade glioma as compared to 3D PC-ASL technique.\n\n0852. Predicting response to hyperbaric oxygen radiotherapy treatment in high grade gliomas using Magnetic Resonance Imaging techniques\n\nNuria Arias1, Jes�s Pacheco-Torres1, and Pilar L�pez-Larrubia1\n\n1Biomedical Research Institute, CSIC, Madrid, Madrid, Spain\n\nA variety of studies have reported a direct link between low tumoral oxygenation and resistance to therapies. Several treatments have been specifically developed to modulate hypoxia in order to improve treatment success, like breathing a gas with high oxygen content during radiotherapy. It would be desirable to know a priori those tumors sensitive to this modulation. In the present work we use BOLD, sensitive to vascular oxygenation and blood flow, and TOLD contrast, sensitive to tissue oxygen level, to detect in a rat glioma model those tumors that would improve their response to radiotherapy by breathing pure oxygen during radiation.\n\n0853.

It has become clear, however, that Gd-enhanced MRI (Gd-MRI) does not reflect prognosis, thereby necessitating a more robust imaging evaluation system for monitoring WT1 immunotherapy. In order to meet this demand, we have performed a voxel-wise parametric response map (PRM) analysis of 11C-methionine PET (Met-PET) in WT1 immunotherapy and compared the data with the overall survival after WT1 immunotherapy initiation (OSWT1). This study describes the limited value of Gd-MRI and highlights the potential of voxel-wise PRM analysis of Met-PET for monitoring treatment response in immunotherapy for malignant gliomas.\n\n0855. Spin- and Gradient-echo PWI with correction for T1- and T2(*)-related contrast agent extravasation effects\n\nHeiko Schmiedeskamp1, Matus Straka1, Thomas Christen1, Jalal B. Andre2, Seema Nagpal3, Laurence Recht3, Reena P. Thomas3, Michael E. Moseley1, Greg Zaharchuk1, and Roland Bammer1\n\n1Department of Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States,2Department of Radiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States,3Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States\n\nAlthough multiecho sequences, such as Spin- And Gradient-Echo (SAGE) EPI, are inherently insensitive to T1-related CA extravasation effects, PWI processing can be biased by R2*- and R2-leakage effects. In this study, an approach used to correct for T1-effects was adjusted to account for R2*- and R2-related extravasation effects. The separation of ∆R2,e(*) from ∆R2,p(*) was achieved through pharmacokinetic modeling of CA passage through the brain. Hereby, a leakage constant ki was derived, facilitating improved assessment of brain tumors with DSC-PWI.\n\n0856. Repeated Split Sample Validation to Assess Logistic Regression Model of DTI in Differentiating Glioblastomas from Brain Metastases\n\nSumei Wang1, Sang Joon Kim1,2, Matthew R Voluck1, Ronald L Wolf1, Donald M O�Rourke3, Harish Poptani1, Elias R Melhem1, and Sungheon Kim4\n\n1Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States,2Radiology, University of Ulsan Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea,3Neurosurgery, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States,4Radiology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States\n\nOne hundred and twenty nine glioblastomas and 74 brain metastases were included in this study. FA and MD were measured from the enhancing and immediate peritumoral region. FA values from the enhancing and immediate peritumoral regions for glioblastomas were significantly higher than those for brain metastases. Repeated split sample validation confirmed that FA and MD from the enhancing part is a robust model for the distinction between glioblastomas and brain metastases.\n\n0857. Diffusion Tensor and Kurtosis metrics along the corticospinal tract in patients with intracranial tumors show complex WM involvement\n\nDanielle Van Westen1, Filip Szczepankiewicz2,3, Markus Nilsson2, Freddy St�hlberg2, Jimmy L�tt1, and Pia C Sundgren3\n\n1Center for Medical Imaging and Physiology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden,2Department of Medical Radiation Physics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden,3Diagnostic Radiology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden\n\nThe usefulness of DTI- and DKI-metrics along the corticospinal tract (CST) for demonstrating white matter (WM) involvement in patients with intracranial tumors was evaluated by comparing estimates in patients and healthy controls. Edema, displacement, and infiltration of the CST significantly affected the metrics along the CST in the vicinity of intracranial tumor in individual patients. However, findings were complex and a larger material is required to assess the sensitivity of DTI- and DKI-metrics and possibly redefine the criteria for the each type of WM involvement; patterns described for visual assessment did not fully account for WM involvement.\n\n0858. Quantitative Magnetization Transfer in Human Glioma\n\nGerard Thompson1, Sha Zhao1, Goeff JM Parker1, and Alan Jackson1\n\n1University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom\n\nQuantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) has been used to study white matter diseases. qMT bound fraction (f) is considered to be a proxy of WM myelination. Since glial tumors arise in and invade white matter, changes in f may represent both affected white matter, and diagnostic information about the solid tumor component. Here we demonstrate that while f is not specific at distinguishing glioma grade or subtype, it is sensitive for the detection of solid tumor, and tumor and age-related white matter change in vivo. We also demonstrate that f can be derived accurately without the need for B1 correction at 3T.\n\n0859. Quantitative 2D chemical shift imaging of glutamate in brain tumour patients\n\nBradford A Moffat1, Liubinas Simon2, Katherine Drummond2, Andrew Morokoff2, Terrence O'Brien3, Chris Kokkinos4, and Patricia M Desmond1\n\n1Radiology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia,2Surgery, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia,3Neurology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia,4Radiology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia\n\nGlutamate concentration in human brain tumours has been quantified from 2D CSI PRESS imaging. We present HPLC validation of this technique. A High Correlation with HPLC data suggests 2D CSI is an excellent biomarker of in vivo Glutamate concentrations.\n\n0860. Spatial Proximity Between Subventricular Zone and Glioma in Human Patients\n\nRong Wang1, Jiaqi Ma1, Bolang Yu1, Ed X. Wu2, and Jian Yang1\n\n1Department of Radiology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China,2Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging and Signal Processing, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China\n\nAlthough brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) are demonstrated in glioma, the origin of BTSCs remains controversial. Neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in subventricular zone (SVZ) which is the largest neurogenic region in adult brain. So SVZ is considered to be the most likely source of BTSCs. This retrospective study showed that gliomas exhibited spatial proximity to SVZ when compared to metastatic tumors, implicating and supporting the possibility that the genesis of gliomas and brain tumor stem cells may originate from the mutational NSCs in SVZ.\n\n0861. Perfusion MRI accurately guides the biopsy of tumor-rich tissue during Stereotactic Biopsy\n\nB. J. Mulligan1, I. S. Grunfeld1, L. C. Baxter1, J. M. Eschbacher2, A. C. Dueck3, S. Liu1, K. A. Smith4, S. W. Coons2, J. E. Heiserman5, J. P. Karis5, J. Debbins1, P. Nakaji4, and L. S.

We examined the utility of using Perfusion MRI (pMRI) to guide stereotactic biopsy in cases of recurrent tumor. A pMRI Fractional Tumor Burden (pMRI-FTB) was calculated from the relative Cerebral Blood Volume to differentiate between post-treatment radiation effect (PTRE) and HGG recurrence. pMRI-FTB showed strong correlation with the biopsy-derived histologic tumor fraction (r = 0.90), indicating that this may be a useful method for guiding surgical biopsies.\n\n0862. Dynamic contrast-enhanced quantitative simultaneous permeability and perfusion imaging of human brain tumours with one-second temporal resolution\n\nErik S Poulsen1, Leif Ostergaard1, Patricia M Desmond2, C Kokkinos2, Kate Drummond2, and Brad Moffat2\n\n1Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience (CFIN), Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark,2Department of Radiology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\n\nDynamic 3D contrast-enhanced imaging using a k-space sharing technique (TWIST) permits whole brain coverage with high special resolution at a temporal resolution of ~1 sec. Hence, simultaneous permeability and perfusion imaging of brain tumours can be acquired without the drawbacks of routinely used dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) technique. Permeability and perfusion measurements could serve as biomarkes of tumour grade and patient outcome. If validated, tumour vasculature pheno-typying using these biomarkers could be applied to any solid tumour. Quantitative data from ~20 brain tumour patients will be presented in comparison with DSC.\n\n0863. Quantitative Measurements of Permeability and Blood Volume in Meningiomas using Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast-Enhanced Perfusion Imaging\n\nSumei Wang1, Ronald L Wolf1, Edward B Lee2, Harish Poptani1, Elias R Melhem1, John YK Lee3, and Sungheon Kim4\n\n1Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States,2Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States,3Neurosurgery, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States,4Radiology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine whether permeability and rCBV measurements can help in determining the histologic grade and subtypes of meningiomas. Thirty-one meningiomas underwent DSC studies. All the perfusion parameters including corrected rCBV, uncorrected rCBV, Ktrans, Ve and Vp were measured from the enhancing part of the tumor. Our result showed that corrected rCBV is helpful in differentiating atypical from typical meningiomas, whereas Ktrans and Ve measurements are useful in distinguishing different subtypes of meningiomas.\n\n0864. Early perfusion changes in patients with recurrent low-grade gliomas treated with everolimus (RAD001) under a phase II clinical trial\n\nMichael Wahl1, Christopher Kazu Williams2, Janine Lupo2, Susan Chang3, Daphne Haas-Kogan1, and Sarah Nelson2,4\n\n1Radiation Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States,2Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States,3Neurosurgery, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States,4Bioengineering and Theraputic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States\n\nEverolimus is an inhibitor of mTOR, a molecule in a signaling pathway activated in most low-grade gliomas and known to have angiogenic effects. In this phase II clinical trial, patients with recurrent low grade gliomas are treated with everolimus and followed with serial multimodal MRI while on treatment. We observe a significant decrease in DCE perfusion MRI parameters, including FBV (a measure of capillary density) and Kps (a measure of vascular permeability). This represents the first clinical demonstration of antiangiogenic effects of everolimus, and raises the possibility that perfusion parameters can be used as early markers of treatment response.\n\n0865. Comparisons of in vivo physiological imaging and histological characteristics for tissue samples from regions of gadolinium enhancing and non-enhancing tumor from patients with GBM\n\nRupa Parvataneni1, Ramon Barajas1, Annette Molinaro2, Gabriela Bourne1, Emma Essock-burns1, Joanna Phillips3, Soonmee Cha1, Susan Chang2, and Sarah Nelson1,4\n\n1Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California, San Francisco, California, United States,2Neurosurgery, University of California, San Francisco, California, United States,3Pathology, University of California, San Francisco, California, United States,4Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco\n\nThe purpose of this study was to obtain image guided tissue samples from regions of suspected tumor in untreated GBM patients and compare ex vivo histopathology features with in vivo imaging biomarkers in order to characterize enhancing (CE) versus non enhancing (NE) tumor. Our study showed that DSC imaging parameters were associated with more malignant histology for CE regions, while DWI parameters were associated with more malignant histology in regions of NE tumor. These results are particularly important in delineating tumor margins during the initial surgical resection and in determining the optimal therapeutic interventions during subsequent stages of the disease.\n\n0866. MR imaging parameters are indicative of malignant transformation for low grade gliomas\n\nLlewellyn Jalbert1, Adam Elkhaled2, Joanna Phillips3, Rupa Parvataneni2, Soonmee Cha2, Susan Chang4, and Sarah Nelson2,5\n\n1Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States,2Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California, San Francisco,3Pathology, University of California, San Francisco,4Neurosurgery, University of California, San Francisco,5Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco\n\nGliomas are heterogeneous, infiltrating tumors of the central nervous system that include astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and mixed oligoastrocytomas. The prognosis for these patients can vary significantly depending on the grade of malignancy and histological characteristics, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). Previous studies have shown that ex vivo spectroscopy can discriminate between upgraded and non-upgraded lesions, but it there are significant limitations that remain in the assessment of malignant transformation using conventional MR imaging methods. This study has applied advanced in vivo magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy techniques to characterize parameters that are associated with malignant transformation.\n\n0867. Automatic assessment of high grade brain tumour tissue in MR images: What is tumour and what radiation injury\n\nYaniv Gal1, Stephen Rose2, Pierrick Bourgeat3, Nicholas Dowson3, Zeike Taylor4, Michael Fay5, Paul Thomas5, Olivier Salvado3, and Stuart Crozier1\n\n1School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia,2Centre of Clinical Research, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia,3CSIRO, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia,4Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom,5Royal Brisbane and Women�s Hospital, Brisbane, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia\n\nA method for automatic assessment of high grade brain tumour tissue in MR images is presented. The aim of the method is to differentiate between tumour tissue and radiation injured tissue. The method is validated qualitatively on two high grade brain cancer patients and demonstrates high potential.\n\n0868. Serial 3T Sodium MRI for the Assessment Therapy Response in Brain Tumors\n\nVincent Lee1, Anthony DeAngelo2, Jonathan Weimer3, Frank Lieberman4, Denise Davis5, Yongxian Qian2, and Fernando Emilio Boada2\n\n1Radiology and Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh, Piitsburgh, PA, United States,2Radiology and Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States,3Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States,4Neurology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States,5Radiology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States\n\nSodium MRI changes in response to the proliferative activity of brain tumors. In this work we demonstrate the use of 3D sodium MRI for following chemotherapy in brain tumor patients.\n\n0869. Assessment of Intratumoral Susceptibility Signals (ITSS) in Patients with newly diagnosed Glioblastoma using Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM)\n\nAndreas Deistung1, Ferdinand Schweser1, Sabine Heiland2, Martin Bendszus2, Wolfgang Wick3, J�rgen Rainer Reichenbach1, and Alexander Radbruch2\n\n1Medical Physics Group, Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology I, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany,2Department of Neuroradiology, University of Heidelberg Medical Center, Heidelberg, Germany,3Department of Neurooncology, University of Heidelberg Medical Center, Heidelberg, Germany\n\nOn susceptibility weighted images glioblastoma usually exhibit a large amount of intratumoral susceptibility signals (ITSS), enabling differentiation from other enhancing brain lesions. However, it is still unknown if these ITS signals correspond to calcium or blood deposits. Therefore, this contribution assesses ITSS in glioblastoma with quantitative susceptibility maps to differentiate between calcium or blood deposits. ITSS were classified as 80-100% hyperintense in 8 of 9 glioblastoma whereas only one of 9 glioblastoma was classified as 60-80% hyperintense, indicating that ITSS in glioblastoma originate from blood products. These findings may improve the understanding of the pathophysiology of glioblastoma.\n\n0870. Imaging of Hypoxia in recurrent GBM using 18F-fluoromisonidazole PET, MRI and MRSI\n\nYan Li1, Laleh Jalilian1, Youngho Seo1, Dave Wilson1, Miguel Pampaloni1, Henry Vanbrocklin1, Michael Prados2, and Sarah J Nelson1,3\n\n1Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California, San Francisco, California, United States,2Department of Neurosurgery, University of California, San Francisco, California, United States,3Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic sciences, University of California, San Francisco, California, United States\n\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the correlation between18F-fluoromisonidazole PET (18F-FMISO-PET) parameters and those from MRI, including perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) in patients with GBM for whom progression was suspected. Three patients diagnosed with glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) were studied at the time of suspected progression. The relationship of the PET parameters to the MRI-defined abnormalities was examined. Elevated CBV and PH values were detected in a region that corresponded with T/B>=1.1.\n\n0871. Areas of necrosis can act as a confounding factor in the functional diffusion map (fDM)\n\nMatthew Grech-Sollars1, Dawn E Saunders2, Kim P Phipps3, Jonathan D Clayden1, and Chris A Clark1\n\n1Imaging and Biophysics Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health, London, London, United Kingdom,2Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, London, United Kingdom,3Department of Neuro-oncology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, London, United Kingdom\n\nThe functional diffusion map (fDM) has been suggested as a tool for early detection of tumour treatment efficacy. Theoretically, on its own, a change in size in necrotic areas does not necessarily give an indication of whether the tumour is responding well to treatment or not. We analysed data from 11 patients with brain stem tumours and built fDM maps of the necrotic regions of the tumour from the ADC images. The fDM in necrotic areas did not appear to correlate with survival. We hypothesize that areas of necrosis can act as a confounding factor in the fDM.\n\n0872. Quantitative MR imaging of brain tumors: A step forward?\n\nDita Wagnerova1, Vit Herynek1, Alberto Malucelli2, Monika Dezortova1, Josef Vymazal3, Dusan Urgosik4, Martin Syrucek5, Filip Jiru1, Antonin Skoch1,6, Robert Bartos2, Martin Sames2, and Milan Hajek1\n\n1Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic,2Department of Neurosurgery, JE Purkyne University and Masaryk Hospital, Usti nad Labem, Czech Republic,3Department of Radiology, Na Homolce Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic,4Stereotactic and radiation neurosurgery, Na Homolce Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic,5Department of Pathology, Na Homolce Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic,6International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic\n\nThe specific correlation patterns between metabolic values, mean diffusivity and T2 relaxation times based on multivoxel analysis were observed for low and high grade gliomas, lymphomas, recurrent lesions and tissue changes by radiation/chemotherapy which enable not only tissue differentiation (healthy tissue, edema, tumor infiltrated edema, tumor; tumor recurrence vs. radiation necrosis), but also tumor type differentiation. Combination of several MR methods can be used for quantitative description of tumors to improve the outcome from MR examination of patients.\n\n0873. Automatic classification of high grade brain tumour MRI for improved resection and therapy planning\n\nYaniv Gal1, Stephen Rose2, Pierrick Bourgeat3, Nicholas Dowson3, Zeike Taylor4, Michael Fay5, Paul Thomas5, Olivier Salvado3, and Stuart Crozier1\n\n1School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia,2Centre of Clinical Research, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia,3CSIRO, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia,4Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom,5Royal Brisbane and Women�s Hospital, Brisbane, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia\n\nA method for automatic classification of high grade brain tumour MRI for improved resection and therapy planning is proposed. The method is validated qualitatively and quantitatively on MRI and FDOPA PET images and is found to increase the sensitivity of contrast enhanced MRI to high grade brain tumours.\n\n0874. Reductions in blood volume in normal white matter are found in glioma patients treated with bevacizumab\n\nVishal Patil1, and Glyn Johnson1\n\n1Radiology, NYU School of Medicine, New York, New York, United States\n\nDSC MRI measurements of relative cerebral blood volume, referenced to normal appearing white matter (NAWM), are frequently used in monitoring treatment response. Bevacizumab is the first FDA approved anti-angiogenic agent and has shown efficacy in glioma when used in combination with conventional cytotoxic agents. In this study we calculated NAWM CBV in three sets of patients groups; 1) never received bevacizumab, 2) received bevacizumab after initial diagnosis and 3) only after reoccurrence. Results show significant reductions in NAWM CBV after treatment with bevacizumab, suggesting that care need be exercised in the use of rCBV measurements to monitor treatment response.\n\n0875. Probabilistic MR Atlases of Biological and Interventional Phenotypes in Human Gliomas\n\nBenjamin M Ellingson1, Timothy F Cloughesy2, Whitney B Pope1, Taryar M Zaw1, Phioanh L Nghiemphu2, Kourosh M Naeini1, Robert J Harris1, and Albert Lai2\n\n1Radiological Sciences, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States,2Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, United States\n\nStudies support tumor location as playing an important role in prognosis, likely due to the genetic profile of tumor precursor cells and the stage in the development cycle that these cells transform (i.e. the glioma �cell of origin�). However, identifying such glioma �cells of origin� is still a major issue challenging the field of neuro-oncology. In the current study we have constructed �probabilistic atlases� specifying the most frequent tumor locations on MR for more than 400 patients. These atlases were stratified by different biological and interventional phenotypes to provide new insight into niche locations of specific glioma cells of origin.\n\n0876. UsingLCModel and whole tissue representations for the classification of single voxel1H spectra of paediatric brain tumours\n\nFelix Raschke1, Nigel Davies2, Martin Wilson2, Andrew Peet2, and Franklyn Howe1\n\n1Clinical Sciences, St George's University of London, London, London, United Kingdom,2Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom\n\nThis study takes forward recently published work using the widespread analysis tool LCModel for the direct classification of single voxel 1H MR spectra of the paediatric brain tumours Medulloblastoma (MDB), Astrocytoma (AG) and Ependymoma (EPD). LCModel is designed to estimate individual metabolite proportions by fitting a linear combination of metabolite spectra to an in vivo MR spectrum, but here is used to fit representations of complete tumour spectra. The best classification according to the highest estimated tumour proportion in a leave-one-out analysis compared well to previously published work with 100.0% and 87.7% for MDB vs. AG and MDB vs. AG vs. EPD respectively.\n\n0877.

Sodium MR imaging in pediatric brain tumors may detect regional areas within diffuse astrocytoma which may behave more aggressive."
