In mammalian cells, nuclease-mediated DNA double strand break is mainly repaired through the error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathway, eventually leading to accumulation of small deletions or insertions (indels) that can inactivate gene function. However, due to the variable size of the indels and the polyploid status of many cell lines (e.g., cancer-derived cells), obtaining a knockout usually requires lengthy screening and characterization procedures. Given the more precise type of modifications that can be introduced upon homology-directed repair (HDR), we have developed HDR-based gene-targeting strategies that greatly facilitate the process of knockout generation in cell lines. To generate reversible knockouts (R-KO), a selectable promoter-less STOP cassette is inserted in an intron, interrupting transcription. Loss-of-function can be validated by RT-qPCR and is removable, enabling subsequent restoration of gene function. A variant of the R-KO procedure can be used to introduce point mutations. To generate constitutive knockouts (C-KO), an exon is targeted, which makes use of HDR-based gene disruption together with NHEJ-induced indels on non-HDR targeted allele(s). Hence the C-KO procedure greatly facilitates simultaneous inactivation of multiple alleles. Overall these genome-editing tools offer superior precision and efficiency for functional genetic approaches. We provide detailed protocols guiding in the design of targeting vectors and in the analysis and validation of gene targeting experiments.\n\nConsequences of MEGF10 deficiency on myoblast function and Notch1 interactions.\n\nAuthor information: Saha M1, Mitsuhashi S2, Jones MD1, Manko K1, Reddy HM1, Bruels C1, Cho KA1,2, Pacak CA3, Draper I4, Kang PB1,2,5,6.\n\n1Division of Pediatric Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida.\n\n2Department of Neurology, Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n3Child Health Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida.\n\n4Molecular Cardiology Research Institute, Department of Medicine, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n5Department of Neurology and Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida.\n\n6 Genetics Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.\n\nJournal: Human Molecular Genetics\n\nDate of e-pub: May 2017\n\nAbstract: Mutations in MEGF10 cause early onset myopathy, areflexia, respiratory distress, and dysphagia (EMARDD), a rare congenital muscle disease, but the pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unknown. We demonstrate that short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of Megf10, as well as overexpression of the pathogenic human p.C774R mutation, leads to impaired proliferation and migration of C2C12 cells. Myoblasts from Megf10-/- mice and Megf10-/-/mdx double knockout (dko) mice also show impaired proliferation and migration compared to myoblasts from wild type and mdx mice, whereas the dko mice show histological abnormalities that are not observed in either single mutant mouse. Cell proliferation and migration are known to be regulated by the Notch receptor, which plays an essential role in myogenesis. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation studies show that Megf10 and Notch1 interact via their respective intracellular domains. These interactions are impaired by the pathogenic p.C774R mutation. Megf10 regulation of myoblast function appears to be mediated at least in part via interactions with key components of the Notch signaling pathway, and defects in these interactions may contribute to the pathogenesis of EMARDD.\n\nAuthors’ Response to Jesse D.

The objective of this study was to explore the feasibility of probe design from transcript sequences for TES application in calling sequence variants in peanut, an important allotetraploid crop with a large genome size. In this study, we applied an in-solution hybridization method to enrich DNA sequences of seven peanut genotypes. Our results showed that it is feasible to apply TES with probes designed from transcript sequences in polyploid peanut. Using a set of 31,123 probes, a total of 5131 and 7521 genes were targeted in peanut A and B genomes, respectively. For each genotype used in this study, the probe target capture regions were efficiently covered with high depth. The average on-target rate of sequencing reads was 42.47%, with a significant amount of off-target reads coming from genomic regions homologous to target regions. In this study, when given predefined genomic regions of interest and the same amount of sequencing data, TES provided the highest coverage of target regions when compared to whole genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and genotyping by sequencing. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling and subsequent validation revealed a high validation rate (85.71%) of homozygous SNPs, providing valuable markers for peanut genotyping. This study demonstrated the success of applying TES for SNP identification in peanut, which shall provide valuable suggestions for TES application in other non-model species without a genome reference available.\n\nBiopsychosocial influence on shoulder pain: Rationale and protocol for a pre-clinical trial.\n\nAuthor information: George SZ1, Staud R2, Borsa PA3, Wu SS4, Wallace MR5, Greenfield WH6, Mackie LN7, Fillingim RB8.\n\n1Duke Clinical Research Institute, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Duke University, Durham, NC 27715, USA.

Preventing chronic musculoskeletal pain requires multifactorial treatment approaches that address its complex etiology. Prior cohort studies identified a high risk subgroup comprised of variation in COMT genotype and pain catastrophizing. This subgroup had increased chance of heightened pain responses (in a pre-clinical model) and higher 12month post-operatives pain intensity ratings (in a clinical model). This pre-clinical trial will test mechanisms and efficacy of personalized pain interventions matched to the genetic and psychological characteristics of the high-risk subgroup.\n\nPotential participants will be screened for high risk subgroup membership, appropriateness for exercise-induced muscle injury protocol, and appropriateness for propranolol administration. Eligible participants that consent to the study will then be randomized into one of four treatment groups; 1) personalized pharmaceutical and psychological education; 2) personalized pharmaceutical and general education; 3) placebo pharmaceutical and psychological education; 4) placebo pharmaceutical and psychological education. Over the 5-day study period participants will complete an exercise-induced muscle injury protocol and receive study interventions. Pain and disability assessments will be completed daily, with primary outcomes being duration of shoulder pain (number of days until recovery), peak shoulder pain intensity, and peak shoulder disability. Secondary outcomes include inflammatory markers, psychological mediators, and measures of pain sensitivity regulation.\n\nThis pre-clinical trial builds on prior cohort studies and its completion will provide foundational data supporting efficacy and mechanisms of personalized interventions for individuals that may be at increased risk for developing chronic shoulder pain.\n\nClinicalTrials.gov registry, NCT02620579 (Registered on November 13, 2015).\n\nNeonatal sepsis in rural India: timing, microbiology and antibiotic resistance in a population-based prospective study in the community setting.\n\nAuthor information: Panigrahi P1, Chandel DS2, Hansen NI3, Sharma N4, Kandefer S5, Parida S6, Satpathy R7, Pradhan L8, Mohapatra A9, Mohapatra SS7, Misra PR10, Banaji N11, Johnson JA12, Morris JG Jr13, Gewolb IH14, Chaudhry R4.\n\n1Department of Epidemiology and Pediatrics, Center for Global Health and Development, College of Public Health, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.\n\n2Department of Environmental, Agricultural, & Occupational Health, Center for Global Health and Development, College of Public Health, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.\n\n3Division of Biostatistics & Epidemiology, RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.\n\n4Department of Microbiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.\n\n5Division of Social Policy, Health, & Economics Research, RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.\n\n6Department of Pediatrics, SCB Medical College, Cuttack, Odisha, India.\n\n7Social Pediatrics and Minority Health, Asian Institute of Public Health, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.\n\n8Neonatal Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Capital Hospital, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.\n\n9Center for Translational Research, Asian Institute of Public Health, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.\n\n10Disease Surveillance Laboratories, Asian Institute of Public Health, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.\n\n11Department of Microbiology, Indira Gandhi Medical College & Research Institute, Puducherry, India.\n\n12Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, Emerging Pathogens Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.\n\n13Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Emerging Pathogens Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville FL, USA.\n\n14Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Sparrow Hospital – Neonatology, Lansing, MI, USA.\n\nJournal: Journal of Perinatology : Official Journal of the California Perinatal Association\n\nDate of e-pub: May 2017\n\nAbstract: To examine the timing and microbiology of neonatal sepsis in a population-based surveillance in the Indian community setting.\n\nAll live born infants in 223 villages of Odisha state were followed at home for 60 days. Suspect sepsis cases were referred to study hospitals for further evaluation including blood culture.\n\nOf 12 622 births, 842 were admitted with suspected sepsis of whom 95% were 4 to 60 days old. Culture-confirmed incidence of sepsis was 6.7/1000 births with 51% Gram negatives (Klebsiella predominating) and 26% Gram positives (mostly Staphylococcus aureus). A very high level of resistance to penicillin and ampicillin, moderate resistance to cephalosporins and extremely low resistance to Gentamicin and Amikacin was observed.\n\nThe bacterial burden of sepsis in the Indian community is not high. Judicious choice of empiric antibiotics, antibiotic stewardship and alternate modalities should be considered for the management or prevention of neonatal sepsis in India.Journal of Perinatology advance online publication, 11 May 2017; doi:10.1038/jp.2017.67.\n\nBenzotriazole ultraviolet stabilizers alter the expression of the thyroid hormone pathway in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos.\n\nAuthor information: Liang X1, Li J2, Martyniuk CJ3, Wang J2, Mao Y2, Lu H2, Zha J4.\n\n1School of Ecology and Environment, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, 010021, China.

Due to their persistence and bioaccumulation, BUVSs have been ubiquitously detected in aquatic environments. Although the toxicological effects of BUVSs in aquatic organisms have been previously examined, the effects of BUVSs on the thyroid system have not been adequately addressed. In this study, we assessed putative thyroid disrupting effects of BUVSs (UV-234, UV-326, UV-329 and UV-P) in zebrafish embryos at 1, 10 and 100 μg/L for 96 h. The heart rate was assessed in zebrafish and was observed to be decreased by 6.9%-21.4% in exposure of tested BUVSs. We also observed that the transcript levels of HPT axis-related genes were affected by the 4 BUVSs tested in different ways. Specifically, mRNA levels of thyroid hormone receptors (thraa and thrb) in zebrafish embryos were differentially expressed and the direction of change in these transcripts was isoform and BUVSs dependent. Pathway analysis of the targeted genes measured indicated that cellular processes putatively affected by BUVSs included response to organic substance, regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, intracellular receptor signaling pathway, and hypothyroidism. Upon expansion of the network, novel genes involved in this predicted gene network may provide insight into the mechanisms of thyroid disrupting mechanisms of BUVSs. Taken together, our results indicate that BUVSs can potentially impact the thyroid system, and that this is dependent upon the type or structure of BUVSs.\n\nSalinity Response in Chloroplasts: Insights from Gene Characterization.\n\nAuthor information: Suo J1, Zhao Q2, David L3, Chen S4, Dai S5,6.\n\n1Alkali Soil Natural Environmental Science Center, Northeast Forestry University, Key Laboratory of Saline-alkali Vegetation Ecology Restoration in Oil Field, Ministry of Education, Harbin 150040, China. suojinwei@nefu.edu.cn.\n\n2Development Center of Plant Germplasm Resources, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China. zhaoqizq@yeah.net.\n\n3Department of Biology, Genetics Institute, Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology Program, Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA. lisaidavid@ufl.edu.\n\n4Department of Biology, Genetics Institute, Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology Program, Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA. schen@ufl.edu.\n\n5Alkali Soil Natural Environmental Science Center, Northeast Forestry University, Key Laboratory of Saline-alkali Vegetation Ecology Restoration in Oil Field, Ministry of Education, Harbin 150040, China. daishaojun@hotmail.com.\n\n6Development Center of Plant Germplasm Resources, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China. daishaojun@hotmail.com.\n\nJournal: International Journal of Molecular Sciences\n\nDate of e-pub: May 2017\n\nAbstract: Salinity is a severe abiotic stress limiting agricultural yield and productivity. Plants have evolved various strategies to cope with salt stress. Chloroplasts are important photosynthesis organelles, which are sensitive to salinity. An understanding of molecular mechanisms in chloroplast tolerance to salinity is of great importance for genetic modification and plant breeding. Previous studies have characterized more than 53 salt-responsive genes encoding important chloroplast-localized proteins, which imply multiple vital pathways in chloroplasts in response to salt stress, such as thylakoid membrane organization, the modulation of photosystem II (PS II) activity, carbon dioxide (CO₂) assimilation, photorespiration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, osmotic and ion homeostasis, abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and signaling, and gene expression regulation, as well as protein synthesis and turnover. This review presents an overview of salt response in chloroplasts revealed by gene characterization efforts.\n\nProfessor Yuichi Sugiyama: A Brilliant, Creative, Amicable, Charming and Humorous Pharmaceutical Scientist.\n\nAuthor information: Kusuhara H1, Obach RS2, Rostami-Hodjegan A3, Pang KS4, Hammarlund-Udenaes M5, Derendorf H6, Artursson P7, Huang SM8, Suzuki H9, Terasaki T10.\n\n1Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacokinetics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, the University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.

To provide an insight, we solved the X-ray crystal structures of a catalytically active Pyrococcus furiosus JAMM/MPN+ metalloprotease (PfJAMM1) alone and in complex with a Ubl (PfSAMP2) to 1.7- to 1.9-Å resolution. PfJAMM1 was found to have a redox sensitive dimer interface. In the PfJAMM1-bound state of the SAMP2, a Ubl-to-Ub conformational change was detected. Surprisingly, distant homologs of PfJAMM1 were found to be closely related in 3D structure, including the interface for Ubl/Ub binding. From this work, we infer the molecular basis of how JAMM/MPN+ proteases recognize and cleave Ubl/Ub tags from diverse proteins and highlight an α2-helix structural element that is conserved and crucial for binding and removing the Ubl SAMP2 tag.\n\nDe Novo Coding Variants Are Strongly Associated with Tourette Disorder.\n\nAuthor information: Willsey AJ1, Fernandez TV2, Yu D3, King RA2, Dietrich A4, Xing J5, Sanders SJ6, Mandell JD1, Huang AY7, Richer P8, Smith L6, Dong S6, Samocha KE3; Tourette International Collaborative Genetics (TIC Genetics); Tourette Syndrome Association International Consortium for Genetics (TSAICG), Neale BM3, Coppola G7, Mathews CA9, Tischfield JA5, Scharf JM10, State MW11, Heiman GA12.\n\n1Department of Psychiatry, UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA; Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases, UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.\n\n2Yale Child Study Center and Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.\n\n3Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA; Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Genetics Unit, Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA.\n\n4University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 9713GZ Groningen, the Netherlands.\n\n5Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, Department of Genetics and the Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.\n\n6Department of Psychiatry, UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.\n\n7Department of Neurology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, CA 90095, USA; Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.\n\n8Yale Child Study Center and Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA; Sewanee: The University of the South, Sewanee, TN 37383, USA.\n\n9Department of Psychiatry, University of Florida School of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.\n\n10Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA; Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Genetics Unit, Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA.

We have completed WES of 325 Tourette disorder trios from the Tourette International Collaborative Genetics cohort and a replication sample of 186 trios from the Tourette Syndrome Association International Consortium on Genetics (511 total). We observe strong and consistent evidence for the contribution of de novo likely gene-disrupting (LGD) variants (rate ratio [RR] 2.32, p = 0.002). Additionally, de novo damaging variants (LGD and probably damaging missense) are overrepresented in probands (RR 1.37, p = 0.003). We identify four likely risk genes with multiple de novo damaging variants in unrelated probands: WWC1 (WW and C2 domain containing 1), CELSR3 (Cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 3), NIPBL (Nipped-B-like), and FN1 (fibronectin 1). Overall, we estimate that de novo damaging variants in approximately 400 genes contribute risk in 12% of clinical cases.\n\nResolving relationships among the megadiverse butterflies and moths with a novel pipeline for Anchored Phylogenomics.\n\nAuthor information: Breinholt JW1,2, Earl C1, Lemmon AR3, Moriarty Lemmon E3, Xiao L1, Kawahara AY1.\n\n1Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.\n\n2RAPiD Genomics, Gainesville, FL 32601, USA.\n\n3Dept. of Biological Science, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL 32306, USA.\n\nJournal: Systematic biology\n\nDate of e-pub: May 2017\n\nAbstract: The advent of next-generation sequencing technology has allowed for the collection of large portions of the genome for phylogenetic analysis. Hybrid enrichment and transcriptomics are two techniques that leverage next-generation sequencing and have shown much promise. However, methods for processing hybrid enrichment data are still limited. We developed a pipeline for anchored hybrid enrichment (AHE) read assembly, orthology determination, contamination screening, and data processing for sequences flanking the target “probe” region. We apply this approach to study the phylogeny of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera), a megadiverse group of more than 157,000 described species with poorly understood deep-level phylogenetic relationships. We introduce a new, 855 locus anchored hybrid enrichment kit for Lepidoptera phylogenetics and compare resulting trees to those from transcriptomes. The enrichment kit was designed from existing genomes, transcriptomes and expressed sequence tag (EST) data and was used to capture sequence data from 54 species from 23 lepidopteran families. Phylogenies estimated from AHE data were largely congruent with trees generated from transcriptomes, with strong support for relationships at all but the deepest taxonomic levels. We combine AHE and transcriptomic data to generate a new Lepidoptera phylogeny, representing 76 exemplar species in 42 families. The tree provides robust support for many relationships, including those among the seven butterfly families. The addition of AHE data to an existing transcriptomic dataset lowers node support along the Lepidoptera backbone, but firmly places taxa with AHE data on the phylogeny. To examine the efficacy of AHE at different taxonomic levels, phylogenetic analyses were also conducted on a sister group representing a more recent divergence, the Saturniidae and Sphingidae. These analyses utilized sequences from the probe region and data flanking it, nearly doubled the size of the dataset; all resulting trees were well supported. We hope that our data processing pipeline, hybrid enrichment gene set, and approach of combining AHE data with transcriptomes will be useful for the broader systematics community.\n\nPhenotypic characterisation of cell populations in the brains of horses experimentally infected with West Nile Virus.\n\nAuthor information: Delcambre GH1, Liu J2, Streit WJ3, Shaw GPJ3, Vallario K2, Herrington J2, Wenzlow N2, Barr KL2, Long MT2.\n\n1Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, 80523-1617, USA.\n\n2Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, P.O.

FFPE from the thalamus and hindbrain were immunolabeled for microglia, astrocytes, B cells, macrophages/neutrophils, CD3+ T cells. Fresh frozen tissues were immunolabeled for CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte cell markers. Cell counts were obtained using a computer software program. Differences, after meeting assumptions of abnormality, were computed using a general linear model with a Tukey test (p<0.05) for pairwise comparisons.\n\nIn WNV-challenged horses, Iba-1+ microglia, CD3+ T lymphocyte, and MAC387+ macrophage staining were significantly increased. The T cell response for the WNV-challenged horses was mixed, composed of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. A limited astrocyte response was also observed in WNV-challenged horses, and MAC387+ and B cells were the least abundant cell populations.\n\nThe results of this study were limited by a single collection time post-infection. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of cellular phenotypes is needed for naturally infected horses. Unfortunately, in clinical horses, there is high variability of sampling in terms of days post infection and tissue handling.\n\nThe data show that WNV-challenged horses recruit a mixed T cell population at the onset of neurologic disease.

CD8+ T cell responses against the AAV capsid protein can, however, affect therapeutic efficacy. Little is known about the in vivo mechanism that leads to the cross-priming of CD8+ T cells against the input viral capsid antigen. Here we report that the TLR9-MyD88 pattern-recognition receptor pathway is uniquely capable of initiating this response. By contrast, the absence of TLR2, STING, or addition of TLR4 agonist has no effect. Surprisingly, both conventional (cDCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are required for the cross-priming of capsid-specific CD8+ T cells, while other antigen presenting cells are not involved. TLR9 signaling is specifically essential in pDCs but not in cDCs, indicating that sensing of the viral genome by pDCs activates cDCs in trans to cross-present capsid antigen during CD8+ T cell activation. Cross-presentation and cross-priming depend not only on TLR9, but also on IFN I signaling, and both mechanisms can be inhibited by administering specific molecules to prevent induction of capsid-specific CD8+ T cells. Thus, these outcomes directly point to therapeutic interventions and demonstrate that innate immune blockade can eliminate unwanted immune responses in gene therapy.\n\nRedox signaling in neurotransmission and cognition during aging.\n\nAuthor information: Kumar A1,2, Yegla B3, Foster TC4.\n\n1University of Florida, Neuroscience , 1049 Newell Drive , Brain Institute, Blg 59, Room # L2-132 , FLORIDA , Gainesville, Florida, United States , 32611-7011.\n\n21049 Newell DriveUnited States ; kash@ufl.edu.\n\n3University of Florida McKnight Brain Institute, 137847, Gainesville, Florida, United States ; britney.yegla@ufl.edu.\n\n4University of Florida, Department of Neuroscience, McKnight Brain Institute, Gainesville, Florida, United States ; foster1@ufl.edu.\n\nJournal: Antioxidants & Redox Signaling\n\nDate of e-pub: May 2017\n\nAbstract: Oxidative stress increases in the brain with aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Previous work emphasized irreversible oxidative damage in relation to cognitive impairment. This research has evolved to consider a continuum of alterations, from redox signaling to oxidative damage, which provides a basis for understanding the onset and progression of cognitive impairment. This review provides an update on research linking redox signaling to altered function of neural circuits involved in information processing and memory.\n\nStarting in middle-age, redox signaling triggers changes in nervous system physiology described as senescent physiology. Recent studies indicates N-methyl-D-aspartate and ryanodine receptors, and Ca2+ signaling molecules as molecular substrates of redox-mediated senescent physiology.\n\nWe review redox homeostasis mechanisms and consider the chemical character of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and their role in regulating different transmitter systems. In this regard, senescent physiology may represent the co-opting of pathways normally responsible for feedback regulation of synaptic transmission.\n\nIt will be important to identify the intrinsic mechanisms for the shift in oxidative/reductive processes. Intrinsic mechanism will depend on the transmitter system, the oxidative stressors, and the expression/activity of antioxidant enzymes. In addition, it will be important to identify how intrinsic processes interact with other aging factors including changes in inflammatory or hormonal signals.\n\nResults suggest that physiological rather than pathological mechanisms underlie for the initial diagnosis of cognitive impairment. Because redox signaling is reversible, it provides hope for early identification and treatment of cognitive decline.\n\nA KCNC3 mutation causes a neurodevelopmental, non-progressive SCA13 subtype associated with dominant negative effects and aberrant EGFR trafficking.\n\nAuthor information: Khare S1,2,3, Nick JA1,2, Zhang Y4, Galeano K1,2, Butler B2,5, Khoshbouei H2,5, Rayaprolu S5, Hathorn T6, Ranum LPW6, Smithson L2,5, Golde TE2,5, Paucar M7,8, Morse R9, Raff M10, Simon J10, Nordenskjöld M11,12, Wirdefeldt K8,13, Rincon-Limas DE1,2, Lewis J2,5, Kaczmarek LK4, Fernandez-Funez P1,2, Nick HS2,5, Waters MF1,2,3,5.\n\n1Department of Neurology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States of America.\n\n2McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States of America.\n\n3Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States of America.\n\n4Department of Pharmacology, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States of America.\n\n5 Department of Neuroscience, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States of America.\n\n6Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States of America.\n\n7Department of Neurology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.\n\n8Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.\n\n9Department of Neurology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH, United States of America.\n\n10Genomics Institute, Multicare Health System, Tacoma, WA, United States of America.\n\n11Department of Genetics, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.\n\n12Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institute, Center for Molecular Medicine, Stockholm, Sweden.\n\n13Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nJournal: PLoS One\n\nDate of e-pub: May 2017\n\nAbstract: The autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a diverse group of neurological disorders anchored by the phenotypes of motor incoordination and cerebellar atrophy. Disease heterogeneity is appreciated through varying comorbidities: dysarthria, dysphagia, oculomotor and/or retinal abnormalities, motor neuron pathology, epilepsy, cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction, and psychiatric manifestations. Our study focuses on SCA13, which is caused by several allelic variants in the voltage-gated potassium channel KCNC3 (Kv3.3). We detail the clinical phenotype of four SCA13 kindreds that confirm causation of the KCNC3R423H allele. The heralding features demonstrate congenital onset with non-progressive, neurodevelopmental cerebellar hypoplasia and lifetime improvement in motor and cognitive function that implicate compensatory neural mechanisms. Targeted expression of human KCNC3R423H in Drosophila triggers aberrant wing veins, maldeveloped eyes, and fused ommatidia consistent with the neurodevelopmental presentation of patients. Furthermore, human KCNC3R423H expression in mammalian cells results in altered glycosylation and aberrant retention of the channel in anterograde and/or endosomal vesicles. Confirmation of the absence of plasma membrane targeting was based on the loss of current conductance in cells expressing the mutant channel. Mechanistically, genetic studies in Drosophila, along with cellular and biophysical studies in mammalian systems, demonstrate the dominant negative effect exerted by the mutant on the wild-type (WT) protein, which explains dominant inheritance. We demonstrate that ocular co-expression of KCNC3R423H with Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor (dEgfr) results in striking rescue of the eye phenotype, whereas KCNC3R423H expression in mammalian cells results in aberrant intracellular retention of human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Together, these results indicate that the neurodevelopmental consequences of KCNC3R423H may be mediated through indirect effects on EGFR signaling in the developing cerebellum. Our results therefore confirm the KCNC3R423H allele as causative for SCA13, through a dominant negative effect on KCNC3WT and links with EGFR that account for dominant inheritance, congenital onset, and disease pathology.\n\nPreemptive Panel-Based Pharmacogenetic Testing: The Time is Now.\n\nAuthor information: Weitzel KW1,2, Cavallari LH3,4, Lesko LJ5.\n\n1Department of Pharmacotherapy and Translational Research, and Center for Pharmacogenomics, University of Florida College of Pharmacy, PO Box 100486, Gainesville, Florida, 32610-0486, USA. kweitzel@cop.ufl.edu.\n\n2UF Health Personalized Medicine Program,, Gainesville, Florida, USA. kweitzel@cop.ufl.edu.\n\n3Department of Pharmacotherapy and Translational Research, and Center for Pharmacogenomics, University of Florida College of Pharmacy, PO Box 100486, Gainesville, Florida, 32610-0486, USA.\n\n4UF Health Personalized Medicine Program,, Gainesville, Florida, USA.\n\n5Department of Pharmaceutics, University of Florida College of Pharmacy, Orlando, Florida, USA.\n\nJournal: Pharmaceutical Research\n\nDate of e-pub: May 2017\n\nAbstract: While recent discoveries have paved the way for the use of genotype-guided prescribing in some clinical environments, significant debate persists among clinicians and researchers about the optimal approach to pharmacogenetic testing in clinical practice. One crucial factor in this debate surrounds the timing and methodology of genotyping, specifically whether genotyping should be performed reactively for targeted genes when a single drug is prescribed, or preemptively using a panel-based approach prior to drug prescribing. While early clinical models that employed a preemptive approach were largely developed in academic health centers through multidisciplinary efforts, increasing examples of pharmacogenetic testing are emerging in community-based and primary care practice environments. However, educational and practice-based resources for these clinicians remain largely nonexistent. As such, there is a need for the health care system to shift its focus from debating about preemptive genotyping to developing and disseminating needed resources to equip frontline clinicians for clinical implementation of pharmacogenetics. Providing tools and guidance to support these emerging models of care will be essential to support the thoughtful, evidence-based use of pharmacogenetic information in diverse clinical practice environments. Specifically, the creation of efficient and accurate point-of-care resources, practice-based tools, and clinical models is needed, along with identification and dissemination of sustainable avenues for pharmacogenetic test reimbursement.\n\nThe bovine embryo hatches from the zona pellucida through either the embryonic or abembryonic pole.\n\nAuthor information: Negrón-Pérez VM1, Hansen PJ2.\n\n1Department of Animal Sciences, D.

In some species, hatching from the zona occurs preferentially from one or the other poles of the embryo. The situation for the bovine embryo, in which hatching precedes attachment to the uterus by more than a week, is unclear. The purpose was to describe whether hatching of the bovine embryo from the zona pellucida occurs preferentially from the embryonic or abembryonic pole.\n\nBovine blastocysts undergoing hatching were examined by light microscopy (n = 84) and epifluorescence imaging using antibodies for markers of epiblast, hypoblast, and trophectoderm (TE) (n = 26). The location of hatching was classified as being at the embryonic pole, if hatching occurred ipsilateral to the inner cell mass (ICM), or abembryonic, if hatching occurred contralateral to the ICM.\n\nA total of 55% of blastocysts exited the zona pellucida through an opening at the embryonic pole. In these cases, 68% of the cells emerging through the zona pellucida were derived from the ICM. The remainder of blastocysts hatched from an opening either contralateral or to the side of the ICM. In these cases, 87% of hatched cells were TE.\n\nFor the bovine embryo, there is nearly equal probability of hatching from the embryonic or abembryonic poles. Given that the surface area of the zona pellucida in contact with the TE overlying the ICM is less than for the remainder of the blastocyst, there is some preference for hatching through the embryonic pole. Thus, the bovine embryo is distinct from the mouse and human, where hatching occurs preferentially at the abembryonic pole.\n\nOld Plants, New Tricks: Phenological Research Using Herbarium Specimens.\n\nAuthor information: Willis CG1, Ellwood ER2, Primack RB3, Davis CC4, Pearson KD5, Gallinat AS3, Yost JM6, Nelson G5, Mazer SJ7, Rossington NL7, Sparks TH8, Soltis PS9.\n\n1Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and Harvard University Herbaria, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.

Phenological research, however, is often limited by the temporal, geographic, or phylogenetic scope of available data. Hundreds of millions of plant specimens in herbaria worldwide offer a potential solution to this problem, especially as digitization efforts drastically improve access to collections. Herbarium specimens represent snapshots of phenological events and have been reliably used to characterize phenological responses to climate. We review the current state of herbarium-based phenological research, identify potential biases and limitations in the collection, digitization, and interpretation of specimen data, and discuss future opportunities for phenological investigations using herbarium specimens.\n\nFatal Systemic Salmonellosis in a Florida Manatee ( Trichechus manatus latirostris).\n\nAuthor information: Vorbach BS1,2, Rotstein DS3, Stacy NI2, Mavian C4, Salemi M4, Waltzek TB5, de Wit M1.\n\n1Marine Mammal Pathobiology Lab, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, St. Petersburg, Florida 33711, USA.\n\n2Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611, USA.\n\n3Marine Mammal Pathology Services, Olney, Maryland 20832, USA.\n\n4Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, Emerging Pathogens Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32610, USA.\n\n5Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611, USA.\n\nJournal: Journal of Wildlife Diseases\n\nDate of e-pub: May 2017\n\nAbstract: A subadult male Florida manatee ( Trichechus manatus latirostris) stranded dead on Florida’s Atlantic coast in January 2015.

As a result of their pathogenic importance, B lymphocyte-targeted therapies have received considerable interest as potential T1D interventions. Unfortunately, the B lymphocyte-directed T1D interventions tested to date failed to halt β cell demise. IgG autoantibodies marking humans at future risk for T1D indicate that B lymphocytes producing them have undergone the affinity-maturation processes of class switch recombination and, possibly, somatic hypermutation. This study found that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ablation of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase gene required for class switch recombination/somatic hypermutation induction inhibits T1D development in the NOD mouse model. The activation-induced cytidine deaminase protein induces genome-wide DNA breaks that, if not repaired through RAD51-mediated homologous recombination, result in B lymphocyte death. Treatment with the RAD51 inhibitor 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2, 2′-disulfonic acid also strongly inhibited T1D development in NOD mice. The genetic and small molecule-targeting approaches expanded CD73+ B lymphocytes that exert regulatory activity suppressing diabetogenic T cell responses. Hence, an initial CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic modification approach has identified the AID/RAD51 axis as a target for a potentially clinically translatable pharmacological approach that can block T1D development by converting B lymphocytes to a disease-inhibitory CD73+ regulatory state.\n\nEvaluation of engineered AAV capsids for hepatic factor IX gene transfer in murine and canine models.\n\nAuthor information: Markusic DM1, Nichols TC2, Merricks EP2, Palaschak B3, Zolotukhin I3, Marsic D3, Zolotukhin S3, Srivastava A3, Herzog RW4.\n\n1Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32610, USA. dmarkusic@ufl.edu.\n\n2Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA.\n\n3Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32610, USA.\n\n4Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32610, USA. rherzog@ufl.edu.\n\nJournal: Journal of Translational Medicine\n\nDate of e-pub: May 2017\n\nAbstract: Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy vectors have shown the best outcomes in human clinical studies for the treatment of genetic diseases such as hemophilia. However, these pivotal investigations have also identified several challenges. For example, high vector doses are often used for hepatic gene transfer, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses against viral capsid may occur. Therefore, achieving therapy at reduced vector doses and other strategies to reduce capsid antigen presentation are desirable.\n\nWe tested several engineered AAV capsids for factor IX (FIX) expression for the treatment of hemophilia B by hepatic gene transfer. These capsids lack potential phosphorylation or ubiquitination sites, or had been generated through molecular evolution.\n\nAAV2 capsids lacking either a single lysine residue or 3 tyrosine residues directed substantially higher coagulation FIX expression in mice compared to wild-type sequence or other mutations. In hemophilia B dogs, however, expression from the tyrosine-mutant vector was merely comparable to historical data on AAV2. Evolved AAV2-LiC capsid was highly efficient in hemophilia B mice but lacked efficacy in a hemophilia B dog.\n\nSeveral alternative strategies for capsid modification improve the in vivo performance of AAV vectors in hepatic gene transfer for correction of hemophilia. However, capsid optimization solely in mouse liver may not predict efficacy in other species and thus is of limited translational utility.\n\nComparison between an exclusive in vitro-produced embryo transfer system and artificial insemination for genetic, technical, and financial herd performance.\n\nAuthor information: Kaniyamattam K1, Block J1, Hansen PJ1, De Vries A2.\n\n1Department of Animal Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville 32611.\n\n2Department of Animal Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville 32611.

In the AI system, sexed semen was used on the genetically best heifers only. In the IVP-ET system, all of the animals in the herd were impregnated with female sexed embryos created through in vitro fertilization of oocytes collected from animals of superior genetics for different traits of interest. Each donor was assumed to yield on average 4.25 transferable embryos per collection. The remaining animals in the herd were used as recipients and received either a fresh embryo or a frozen embryo when fresh embryos were not available. Selection of donors was random or based on the greatest estimated breeding value (EBV) of lifetime net merit (NM$), milk yield, or daughter pregnancy rate. For both the IVP-ET and AI systems, culling of surplus heifer calves not needed to replace culled cows was based on the lowest EBV for the same traits. A herd of 1,000 milking cows was simulated 15 yr over time after the start of the IVP-ET system. The default cost to produce and transfer 1 embryo was set at $165. Prices of fresh embryos at which an exclusive IVP-ET system financially breaks even with the comparable AI system in yr 15 and for an investment period of 15 yr were also estimated. More surplus heifer calves were sold from the IVP-ET systems than from the comparable AI systems. The surplus calves from the IVP-ET systems were also genetically superior to the surplus calves from the comparable AI systems, which might be reflected in their market value as a premium price. The most profitable scenario among the 4 IVP-ET scenarios in yr 15 was the one in which NM$ was maximized in the herd. This scenario had an additional profit of $8/cow compared with a similar AI scenario that maximized NM$, provided that surplus heifer calves could be sold at a premium price based on the superiority of the EBV of NM$. For the IVP-ET system to be at least as profitable as the comparable AI system during a 15-yr investment period, the surplus calves from the IVP-ET system needed to be sold at the premium prices. The break-even price of fresh embryos was estimated to be $84 for the exclusive IVP-ET system. This resulted in the same profit as the AI system, which maximized NM$ for a 15-yr investment period and in which heifer calves were sold at a premium price.\n\nPostnatal phenotype of dairy cows is altered by in vitro embryo production using reverse X-sorted semen.\n\nAuthor information: Siqueira LGB1, Dikmen S2, Ortega MS3, Hansen PJ4.\n\n1Department of Animal Sciences, D.H.

To test the hypothesis that bovine females derived by assisted reproductive technologies have altered postnatal growth and adult function, a retrospective cohort study evaluated survival, growth, and production traits of offspring derived by in vitro embryo production (IVP) with conventional (IVP-conv) or reverse X-sorted semen (IVP-sexed), multiple ovulation and embryo transfer, and artificial insemination (AI) in a large dairy herd. Live calves produced by IVP were born slightly heavier compared with AI calves. In addition, IVP-sexed calves had a higher cumulative mortality from 90 to 180 d of age compared with AI offspring. Mortality of IVP-conv and multiple ovulation and embryo transfer offspring was intermediate and not different from AI or IVP-sexed offspring. The altered phenotype of offspring from IVP-sexed extended to adult milk production. Cows derived by IVP-sexed produced less milk, fat, and protein in their first lactation compared with dairy cows derived by AI. Additionally, females born to nulliparous dams had a distinct postnatal phenotype compared with offspring from parous dams even when data were restricted to offspring of surrogate females. In conclusion, procedures associated with in vitro production of embryos involving use of reverse-sorted spermatozoa for fertilization result in an alteration of embryonic programming that persists postnatally and causes an effect on milk production in adulthood. Thus, some benefits of reverse-sorted semen for genetic improvement may be offset by adverse programming events.\n\nRecent Advances in Nanomaterials for Gene Delivery-A Review.\n\nAuthor information: Riley MK1,2, Vermerris W3,4,5.\n\n1Graduate Program in Plant Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA. mike.riley2@ufl.edu.\n\n2UF Genetics Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA. mike.riley2@ufl.edu.\n\n3Graduate Program in Plant Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA. wev@ufl.edu.\n\n4UF Genetics Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA. wev@ufl.edu.\n\n5Department of Microbiology & Cell Science, University of Florida, Cancer/Genetics Research Complex 302, 2033 Mowry Road, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA. wev@ufl.edu.\n\nJournal: Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)\n\nDate of e-pub: April 2017\n\nAbstract: With the rapid development of nanotechnology in the recent decade, novel DNA and RNA delivery systems for gene therapy have become available that can be used instead of viral vectors. These non-viral vectors can be made of a variety of materials, including inorganic nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, liposomes, protein and peptide-based nanoparticles, as well as nanoscale polymeric materials. They have as advantages over viral vectors a decreased immune response, and additionally offer flexibility in design, allowing them to be functionalized and targeted to specific sites in a biological system with low cytotoxicity. The focus of this review is to provide an overview of novel nanotechnology-based methods to deliver DNA and small interfering RNAs into biological systems.\n\nComplete Genome Sequences of Identical Zika virus Isolates in a Nursing Mother and Her Infant.\n\nAuthor information: Blohm GM1,2, Lednicky JA3,4, Márquez M2,5, White SK3,4, Loeb JC4, Pacheco CA6, Nolan DJ3,7, Paisie T3,7, Salemi M3,7, Rodríguez-Morales AJ8, Morris JG Jr3,9, Pulliam JRC1,3,10, Carrillo AS11, Plaza JD11, Paniz-Mondolfi AE12.\n\n1Department of Biology, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.\n\n2Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hospital Internacional Barquisimeto, Lara, Barquisimeto, Venezuela.\n\n3Emerging Pathogens Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.\n\n4Department of Environmental and Global Health, College of Public Health and Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.\n\n5Health Sciences Department, College of Medicine, Universidad Centroccidental Lisandro Alvarado, Barquisimeto, Lara, Venezuela.\n\n6Policlínica Barquisimeto, Barquisimeto, Lara, Venezuela.\n\n7Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.\n\n8Public Health and Infection Research Group, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira, Pereira, Colombia.\n\n9Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Health, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.\n\n10DST-NRF Centre of Excellence in Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA), Matieland, South Africa.\n\n11Health Sciences Department, College of Medicine, Universidad Nacional Experimental Francisco de Miranda, Punto Fijo, Falcon, Venezuela.\n\n12Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hospital Internacional Barquisimeto, Lara, Barquisimeto, Venezuela albertopaniz@yahoo.com.\n\nJournal: Genome Announcements\n\nDate of e-pub: April 2017\n\nAbstract: Complete genome sequences were obtained for Zika viruses isolated from the breast milk of a Venezuelan patient and her child, who was exclusively breastfeeding at the time.

While there are reported benefits for this flavonoid as a dietary supplement due to antioxidant properties, the full scope of its biological interactions has not been fully addressed. To learn more about the mechanisms of action related to quercetin, we exposed zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos to 1 and 10μg/L quercetin for 96h starting at 3h post fertilization. Quercetin up to 10μg/L did not induce significant mortality in developing fish, but did increase prevalence of an upward-curved dorsal plane in hatched larvae. To determine whether this developmental defect was potentially related to mitochondrial bioenergetics during development, we measured oxygen consumption rate in whole embryos following a 24-hour exposure to quercetin. Basal mitochondrial and ATP-linked respiration were decreased at 1 and 10μg/L quercetin, and maximal respiration was decreased at 10μg/L quercetin, suggesting that quercetin impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics. This is proposed to be related to the deformities observed during development. Due to the fact that ATP production was affected by quercetin, larval behaviors related to locomotion were investigated, as well as transcriptional responses of six myogenesis transcripts. Quercetin at 10μg/L significantly reduced the swimming velocity of zebrafish larvae. The expression levels of both myostatin A (mstna) and myogenic differentiation (myoD) were also altered by quercetin. Mstna, an inhibitory factor for myogenesis, was significantly increased at 1μg/L quercetin exposure, while myoD, a stimulatory factor for myogenesis, was significantly increased at 10μg/L quercetin exposure. There were no changes in transcripts related to apoptosis (bcl2, bax, casp3, casp7), but we did observe a decrease in mRNA levels for catalase (cat) in fish exposed to each dose, supporting an oxidative stress response. Our data support the hypothesis that quercetin may affect locomotion and induce deformities in zebrafish larvae by diminishing ATP production and by altering the expression of transcripts related to muscle formation and activity.\n\nRole of CC Cytokines in Spatial Arrangement of the Inner Cell Mass of the Bovine Embryo.\n\nAuthor information: Negrón-Pérez VM1, Vargas-Franco D2, Hansen PJ1.\n\n1Department of Animal Sciences, D.

Barron Reproductive and Perinatal Biology Research Program and Genetics Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.\n\n2Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Center for Epigenetics and Genetics Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.\n\nJournal: Biology of Reproduction\n\nDate of e-pub: April 2017\n\nAbstract: The process of spatial rearrangement of cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) that are destined to become hypoblast is not well understood. The observation that the chemokine CCL24 and several other genes involved in chemokine signaling are expressed more in the ICM than the trophectoderm of the bovine embryo resulted in the hypothesis that CCL24 participates in spatial organization of the ICM. Temporally, expression of CCL24 in the bovine embryo occurs coincident with blastocyst formation: transcript abundance was low until the late morula stage, peaked in the blastocyst at Day 7 of development and declined by Day 9. Treatment of embryos with two separate antagonists of CCR3 (the prototypical receptor for CCL24) decreased the percent of GATA6+ cells (hypoblast precursors) that were located in the outside of the ICM. Similarly, injection of zygotes with a CCL24-specific morpholino decreased the percent of GATA6+ cells in the outside of the ICM. In conclusion, CCL24 assists in spatial arrangement of the ICM in the bovine embryo. This experiment points to new functions of chemokine signaling in the bovine embryo and is consistent with the idea that cell migration is involved in the spatial organization of hypoblast cells in the blastocyst.\n\nInsights into the evolution of hydroxyproline rich glycoproteins from 1000 plant transcriptomes.\n\nAuthor information: Johnson KL1, Cassin AM2, Lonsdale A3, Wong GK4, Soltis D5, Miles NW6, Melkonian M7, Melkonian B7, Deyholos MK8, Leebens-Mack J9, Rothfels CJ10, Stevenson DW11, Graham SW12, Wang X13, Wu S13, Pires JC14, Edger PP15, Carpenter EJ16, Bacic A17, Doblin MS18, Schultz CJ19.\n\n1University of Melbourne CITY: Melbourne STATE: Vic POSTAL_CODE: 3010 Australia [AU].\n\n2University of Melbourne CITY: Melbourne STATE: VIC Australia [AU].\n\n3University of Melbourne CITY: Melbourne STATE: Vic Australia [AU].\n\n4University of Alberta University of Alberta, CW405 Biological Sciences CITY: Edmonton STATE: AB POSTAL_CODE: T6G 2E9 Canada [CA].\n\n5University of Florida Dept Biology Univ Florida CITY: Gainesville POSTAL_CODE: 32605 United States Of America [US].\n\n6University of Florida CITY: Gainesville United States Of America [US].\n\n7Universität zu Köln CITY: Köln Germany [DE].\n\n8University of British Columbia, Okanagan SCI 316, 1177 Research Road, UBCO CITY: Kelowna STATE: BC POSTAL_CODE: V1V 1V7 Canada [CA].\n\n9Univ Georgia CITY: N/A POSTAL_CODE: N/A United States Of America [US].\n\n10University of California, Berkeley CITY: Berkeley STATE: California United States Of America [US].\n\n11New York Botanical Garden CITY: New York STATE: NY United States Of America [US].\n\n12University of British Columbia CITY: Vancouver Canada [CA].\n\n13Chinese Academy of Sciences CITY: Beijing China [CN].\n\n14University of Missouri CITY: Columbia STATE: Missouri POSTAL_CODE: 65211 United States Of America [US].\n\n15Michigan State University CITY: East Lansing STATE: MI United States Of America [US].\n\n16University of Alberta CITY: Edmonton STATE: Alberta Canada [CA].\n\n17The University of Melbourne CITY: Victoria POSTAL_CODE: 3010 Australia [AU].\n\n18University of Melbourne CITY: Parkville STATE: Victoria POSTAL_CODE: 3010 Australia [AU].\n\n19The University of Adelaide Waite Agricultural Research Institute, RMB1 CITY: Glen Osmond STATE: SA POSTAL_CODE: 5064 Australia [AU] carolyn.schultz@adelaide.edu.au.\n\nJournal: Plant Physiology\n\nDate of e-pub: April 2017\n\nAbstract: The carbohydrate-rich cell walls of land plants and algae have been the focus of much interest given the value of cell wall based products to our current and future economies. Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs), a major group of wall glycoproteins, play important roles in plant growth and development, yet little is known about how they have evolved in parallel with the polysaccharide components of walls. We investigate the origins and evolution of the HRGP superfamily, which is commonly divided into three major multigene families: the arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs), extensins (EXTs) and proline-rich proteins (PRPs). Using MAAB, a newly developed bioinformatics pipeline, we identified HRGPs in sequences from the 1000 plants (1KP) transcriptome project (www.onekp.com). Our analyses provide new insights into the evolution of HRGPs across major evolutionary milestones, including the transition to land and early radiation of angiosperms. Significantly, data mining reveals the origin of GPI-anchored AGPs in green algae and a 3-4 fold increase in GPI-AGPs in liverworts and mosses. The first detection of cross-linking (CL)-EXTs is observed in bryophytes, which suggest that CL-EXTs arose though the juxtaposition of pre-existing SPn EXT glycomotifs with refined Y-based motifs. We also detected the loss of CL-EXT in a few lineages, including the grass family (Poaceae), that have a cell wall composition distinct from other monocots and eudicots. A key challenge in HRGP research is tracking individual HRGPs throughout evolution. Using the 1KP output we were able to find putative orthologs of Arabidopsis pollen-specific GPI-AGPs in basal eudicots.\n\nWhole genome sequencing reveals a novel deletion variant in the KIT gene in horses with white spotted coat colour phenotypes.\n\nAuthor information: Dürig N1,2, Jude R1,2,3, Holl H4,5, Brooks SA4, Lafayette C5, Jagannathan V1,2, Leeb T1,2.\n\n1Vetsuisse Faculty, Institute of Genetics, University of Bern, 3001, Bern, Switzerland.\n\n2DermFocus, University of Bern, 3001, Bern, Switzerland.\n\n3RJC, 53919, Weilerswist, Germany.\n\n4Department of Animal Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611-0910, USA.\n\n5Etalon Inc., Menlo Park, CA, 94025, USA.\n\nJournal: Animal Genetics\n\nDate of e-pub: April 2017\n\nAbstract: White spotting phenotypes in horses can range in severity from the common white markings up to completely white horses. EDNRB, KIT, MITF, PAX3 and TRPM1 represent known candidate genes for such phenotypes in horses. For the present study, we re-investigated a large horse family segregating a variable white spotting phenotype, for which conventional Sanger sequencing of the candidate genes’ individual exons had failed to reveal the causative variant. We obtained whole genome sequence data from an affected horse and specifically searched for structural variants in the known candidate genes. This analysis revealed a heterozygous ~1.9-kb deletion spanning exons 10-13 of the KIT gene (chr3:77,740,239_77,742,136del1898insTATAT). In continuity with previously named equine KIT variants we propose to designate the newly identified deletion variant W22. We had access to 21 horses carrying the W22 allele. Four of them were compound heterozygous W20/W22 and had a completely white phenotype. Our data suggest that W22 represents a true null allele of the KIT gene, whereas the previously identified W20 leads to a partial loss of function. These findings will enable more precise genetic testing for depigmentation phenotypes in horses.\n\nTet2 loss leads to hypermutagenicity in haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.\n\nAuthor information: Pan F1,2,3, Wingo TS4,5,6, Zhao Z7, Gao R1, Makishima H8, Qu G1,2, Lin L4, Yu M9, Ortega JR10, Wang J2, Nazha A8, Chen L4, Yao B4, Liu C1, Chen S1, Weeks O3, Ni H11, Phillips BL12, Huang S13, Wang J14, He C9, Li GM10, Radivoyevitch T8, Aifantis I15,16, Maciejewski JP8, Yang FC1,2, Jin P4, Xu M1,2.\n\n1Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, 1011 NW 15th Street, Room 411, Gautier Building, MC R629, Miami, Florida 33136, USA.\n\n2Department of Pediatrics, Herman B.

Although TET2 mutations frequently occur in various types of haematological malignancies, the mechanism by which they increase risk for these cancers remains poorly understood. Here we show that Tet2-/- mice develop spontaneous myeloid, T- and B-cell malignancies after long latencies. Exome sequencing of Tet2-/- tumours reveals accumulation of numerous mutations, including Apc, Nf1, Flt3, Cbl, Notch1 and Mll2, which are recurrently deleted/mutated in human haematological malignancies. Single-cell-targeted sequencing of wild-type and premalignant Tet2-/- Lin-c-Kit+ cells shows higher mutation frequencies in Tet2-/- cells. We further show that the increased mutational burden is particularly high at genomic sites that gained 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, where TET2 normally binds. Furthermore, TET2-mutated myeloid malignancy patients have significantly more mutational events than patients with wild-type TET2. Thus, Tet2 loss leads to hypermutagenicity in haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, suggesting a novel TET2 loss-mediated mechanism of haematological malignancy pathogenesis.\n\nESPRIT-Forest: Parallel clustering of massive amplicon sequence data in subquadratic time.\n\nAuthor information: Cai Y1, Zheng W2, Yao J3, Yang Y1, Mai V4, Mao Q3, Sun Y2,3,5.\n\n1Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China.\n\n2Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, United States of America.\n\n3Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, United States of America.\n\n4Department of Epidemiology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.\n\n5Department of Biostatistics, The State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, United States of America.\n\nJournal: PLoS Computational Biology\n\nDate of e-pub: April 2017\n\nAbstract: The rapid development of sequencing technology has led to an explosive accumulation of genomic sequence data. Clustering is often the first step to perform in sequence analysis, and hierarchical clustering is one of the most commonly used approaches for this purpose. However, it is currently computationally expensive to perform hierarchical clustering of extremely large sequence datasets due to its quadratic time and space complexities. In this paper we developed a new algorithm called ESPRIT-Forest for parallel hierarchical clustering of sequences. The algorithm achieves subquadratic time and space complexity and maintains a high clustering accuracy comparable to the standard method. The basic idea is to organize sequences into a pseudo-metric based partitioning tree for sub-linear time searching of nearest neighbors, and then use a new multiple-pair merging criterion to construct clusters in parallel using multiple threads. The new algorithm was tested on the human microbiome project (HMP) dataset, currently one of the largest published microbial 16S rRNA sequence dataset. Our experiment demonstrated that with the power of parallel computing it is now compu- tationally feasible to perform hierarchical clustering analysis of tens of millions of sequences. The software is available at http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/∼yijunsun/lab/ESPRIT-Forest.html.\n\nInsulitis in Autoantibody-Positive Pancreatic Donor With History of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.\n\nAuthor information: Jackson J1,2, Posgai A1, Campbell-Thompson M1, Kusmartseva I3.\n\n1Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.\n\n2Division of Maternal & Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.\n\n3Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL inkusmartseva@ufl.edu.\n\nJournal: Diabetes Care\n\nDate of e-pub: May 2017\n\nAbstract: N/A\n\nDisulfide bond disrupting agents activate the unfolded protein response in EGFR- and HER2-positive breast tumor cells.\n\nAuthor information: Ferreira RB1, Wang M2,3, Law ME2,3, Davis BJ2,3, Bartley AN1, Higgins PJ4, Kilberg MS5, Santostefano KE6, Terada N6, Heldermon CD7, Castellano RK1, Law BK2,3.\n\n1Department of Chemistry, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.\n\n2Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.\n\n3UF-Health Cancer Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.\n\n4Center for Cell Biology and Cancer Research, Albany Medical College, Albany, NY 12208, USA.\n\n5Department of Biochemistry, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32610, USA.\n\n6Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Laboratory Medicine, Center for Cellular Reprogramming, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.\n\n7Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32610, USA.\n\nJournal: Oncotarget\n\nDate of e-pub: April 2017\n\nAbstract: Many breast cancer deaths result from tumors acquiring resistance to available therapies. Thus, new therapeutic agents are needed for targeting drug-resistant breast cancers. Drug-refractory breast cancers include HER2+ tumors that have acquired resistance to HER2-targeted antibodies and kinase inhibitors, and “Triple-Negative” Breast Cancers (TNBCs) that lack the therapeutic targets Estrogen Receptor, Progesterone Receptor, and HER2. A significant fraction of TNBCs overexpress the HER2 family member Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). Thus agents that selectively kill EGFR+ and HER2+ tumors would provide new options for breast cancer therapy. We previously identified a class of compounds we termed Disulfide bond Disrupting Agents (DDAs) that selectively kill EGFR+ and HER2+ breast cancer cells in vitro and blocked the growth of HER2+ breast tumors in an animal model. DDA-dependent cytotoxicity was found to correlate with downregulation of HER1-3 and Akt dephosphorylation. Here we demonstrate that DDAs activate the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and that this plays a role in their ability to kill EGFR+ and HER2+ cancer cells. The use of breast cancer cell lines ectopically expressing EGFR or HER2 and pharmacological probes of UPR revealed all three DDA responses: HER1-3 downregulation, Akt dephosphorylation, and UPR activation, contribute to DDA-mediated cytotoxicity. Significantly, EGFR overexpression potentiates each of these responses. Combination studies with DDAs suggest that they may be complementary with EGFR/HER2-specific receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and mTORC1 inhibitors to overcome drug resistance.\n\nLPS Stimulation of Cord Blood Reveals a Newborn-Specific Neutrophil Transcriptomic Response and Cytokine Production.\n\nAuthor information: Mathias B1, Mira JC, Rehfuss JP, Rincon JC, Ungaro R, Nacionales DC, Lopez MC, Baker HV, Moldawer LL, Larson SD.\n\n1Department of Surgery, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida†Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida.\n\nJournal: Shock (Augusta, Ga.)\n\nDate of e-pub: May 2017\n\nAbstract: The neonatal innate immune system differs to microbial infection both quantitatively and qualitatively when compared with adults. Here, we provide the first genome-wide ex-vivo expression profile of umbilical cord blood (UCB) neutrophils from full-term infants prior to and in response to whole-blood lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Additionally, we provide cytokine expression prior to and following LPS stimulation. The genomic expression and cytokine profile are compared with LPS-stimulated whole blood from healthy adult subjects (HC).\n\nWhole blood from UCB (n = 6) and HC (n = 6) was studied at baseline or was stimulated for 24 h with 100 ngs/mL of LPS. CD66b neutrophils were subsequently isolated with microfluidic techniques and genome-wide expression analyses were performed. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was utilized to predict downstream functional effects. Additionally, cytokine concentrations in whole blood prior to and after 24 h of LPS incubation were determined.\n\nLPS stimulated whole blood from UCB demonstrated significant differences in both ex-vivo cytokine production and PMN gene expression. Mixed-effect modeling identified 1,153 genes whose expression changed significantly in UCB and HC after exposure to LPS (P < 0.001 with a minimum 1.5-fold change). IPA downstream predictions suggest that PMNs from UCB fail to effectively upregulate genes associated with activation, phagocytosis, and chemotaxis in response to LPS stimulation. Furthermore, whole blood from UCB showed increased interleukin (IL)-10 production to LPS, but failed to significantly increase several pro-inflammatory cytokines.\n\nLPS-stimulated whole blood from UCB exhibited a markedly suppressed inflammatory cytokine production and PMN innate immune genome response. These differences in gene expression and cytokine production may be an adaptive response to a prior fetal environment, but may also explain their increased susceptibility to infections. Characterization of these deficits is the first step toward developing prophylactic and therapeutic interventions.\n\nSemipermeable Functional DNA-Encapsulated Nanocapsules as Protective Bioreactors for Biosensing in Living Cells.\n\nAuthor information: Hong CY1,2, Wu SX1, Li SH1, Liang H1, Chen S1, Li J1,3, Yang HH1, Tan W3,2.\n\n1MOE Key Laboratory for Analytical Science of Food Safety and Biology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Analysis and Detection Technology for Food Safety, State Key Laboratory of Photocatalysis on Energy and Environment, College of Chemistry, Fuzhou University , Fuzhou 350002, China.\n\n2Department of Chemistry and Department of Physiology and Functional Genomics, Center for Research at the Bio/Nano Interface, UF Health Cancer Center, University of Florida , Gainesville, Florida 32611-7200, United States.\n\n3Molecular Sciences and Biomedicine Laboratory, State Key Laboratory for Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering and College of Biology, Collaborative Innovation Center for Molecular Engineering and Theranostics, Hunan University , Changsha 410082, China.\n\nJournal: Analytical Chemistry\n\nDate of e-pub: May 2017\n\nAbstract: The development of functional DNA-based nanosensors in living cells has experienced some design challenges, including, for example, poor cellular uptake, rapid nuclease degradation, and high false positives. Herein, we designed selectively permeable poly(methacrylic acid) (PMA) nanocapsules to encapsulate functional DNAs for metal ions and small-molecules sensing in living cells. Since functional DNAs are concentrated in the nanocapsules, an increasing reaction rate is obtained in vitro. During endocytosis, polymeric capsules simultaneously improve cellular uptake of functional DNAs and preserve their structural integrity inside the confined capsule space. More importantly, selective shell permeability allows for the free diffusion of small molecular targets through capsule shells but limits the diffusion of large biomolecules, such as nuclease and nonspecific protein. Compared to the free DNAzyme, PMA nanocapsules could reduce false positives and enhance detection accuracy. Furthermore, PMA nanocapsules are biocompatible and biodegradable. Through the controllability of wall thickness, permeability, and size distribution, these nanocapsules could be expanded easily to other targets, such as microRNAs, small peptides, and metabolites. These nanocapsules will pave the way for in situ monitoring of various biological processes in living cells and in vivo.\n\nFunctional characterization of LotP from Liberibacter asiaticus.\n\nAuthor information: Loto F1,2, Coyle JF1, Padgett KA1,3, Pagliai FA1, Gardner CL1, Lorca GL1, Gonzalez CF1.\n\n1Department of Microbiology and Cell Science, Genetics Institute, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida, 2033 Mowry road, PO Box 103610, Gainesville, FL 32610-3610, USA.\n\n2PROIMI Planta Piloto de Procesos Industriales Microbiológicos, CONICET, Tucumán, Argentina.\n\n3Department of Microbiology and Cell Science, Undergraduate Research Program, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.\n\nJournal: Microbial Biotechnology\n\nDate of e-pub: May 2017\n\nAbstract: Liberibacter asiaticus is an unculturable parasitic bacterium of the alphaproteobacteria group hosted by both citrus plants and a psyllid insect vector (Diaphorina citri). In the citrus tree, the bacteria thrive only inside the phloem, causing a systemically incurable and deadly plant disease named citrus greening or Huanglongbing. Currently, all commercial citrus cultivars in production are susceptible to L. asiaticus, representing a serious threat to the citrus industry worldwide. The technical inability to isolate and culture L. asiaticus has hindered progress in understanding the biology of this bacterium directly. Consequently, a deep understanding of the biological pathways involved in the regulation of host-pathogen interactions becomes critical to rationally design future and necessary strategies of control. In this work, we used surrogate strains to evaluate the biochemical characteristics and biological significance of CLIBASIA_03135. This gene, highly induced during early stages of plant infection, encodes a 23 kDa protein and was renamed in this work as LotP. This protein belongs to an uncharacterized family of proteins with an overall structure resembling the LON protease N-terminus. Co-immunoprecipitation assays allowed us to identify the Liberibacter chaperonin GroEL as the main LotP-interacting protein. The specific interaction between LotP and GroEL was reconstructed and confirmed using a two-hybrid system in Escherichia coli. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that LotP has a native molecular weight of 44 kDa, corresponding to a dimer in solution with ATPase activity in vitro. In Liberibacter crescens, LotP is strongly induced in response to conditions with high osmolarity but repressed at high temperatures. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) results suggest that LotP is a member of the LdtR regulon and could play an important role in tolerance to osmotic stress.\n\nAssociation of the HLA-B*53:01 Allele With Drug Reaction With Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Syndrome During Treatment of HIV Infection With Raltegravir.\n\nAuthor information: Thomas M1,2, Hopkins C2, Duffy E2, Lee D3, Loulergue P4, Ripamonti D5, Ostrov DA6, Phillips E7,8,9.\n\n1Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland.\n\n2Infectious Diseases Department, Auckland City Hospital, New Zealand.\n\n3Department of Internal Medicine, University of California San Diego.\n\n4Centre d’Investigation Clinique Cochin-Pasteur de Vaccinologie Cochin-Pasteur, Hôpital Cochin, Paris, France.\n\n5Department of Infectious Diseases, Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.\n\n6Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville.\n\n7Oates Institute for Experimental Therapeutics.\n\n8Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville Tennessee.\n\n9Institute for Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Murdoch University, Murdoch, Western Australia.\n\nJournal: Clinical Infectious Diseases : An Official Publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America\n\nDate of e-pub: May 2017\n\nAbstract: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a rare, severe adverse event during treatment with raltegravir. The occurrence of DRESS syndrome during treatment with other drugs is strongly associated with particular HLA alleles.\n\nWe performed HLA testing in 3 of the 5 patients previously reported to have developed raltegravir-induced DRESS syndrome and in 1 previously unreported patient. We then used virtual modeling to visualize interactions between raltegravir and the imputed HLA molecule.\n\nFive of the 6 patients who developed raltegravir-induced DRESS syndrome were African, and 1 was Hispanic. HLA typing was performed in 4 patients, all of whom carried both the HLA-B*53 allele and the HLA-C*04 allele to which it is commonly haplotypic. No other HLA alleles were shared by all of the tested patients. Given the approximate prevalence of HLA-B*53 carriage in African (20%) and Hispanic (6%) populations, the probability of all 4 patients being HLA-B*53 carriers, and 2 of 3 African patients being homozygous for HLA-B*53:01, is approximately 0.00002.\n\nThese data implicate the prevalent African allele HLA-B*53:01 in the immunopathogenesis of raltegravir-induced DRESS syndrome. Although the immunopathogenic mechanisms are currently unknown, virtual modeling suggests that raltegravir may bind within the antigen binding cleft of the HLA-B*53:01 molecule, but not within the closely related HLA-B*35:01 molecule. Further studies are necessary to confirm the strength of the association between carriage of the HLA-B*53:01 allele and raltegravir-induced DRESS syndrome, and the potential utility of HLA screening before raltegravir treatment.\n\nDynamic Gene Regulatory Networks of Human Myeloid Differentiation.\n\nAuthor information: Ramirez RN1, El-Ali NC1, Mager MA1, Wyman D2, Conesa A3, Mortazavi A4.\n\n1Developmental and Cell Biology, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697-2300, USA; Center for Complex Biological Systems, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697-2300, USA.\n\n2Center for Complex Biological Systems, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697-2300, USA.\n\n3Centro de Investigacion Principe Felipe, 46012 Valencia, Spain; Microbiology and Cell Science, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32603, USA.\n\n4Developmental and Cell Biology, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697-2300, USA; Center for Complex Biological Systems, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697-2300, USA.

Here, we derive dynamic gene regulatory networks for human myeloid differentiation using a 5-day time series of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. We profile HL-60 promyelocytes differentiating into macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages. We find a rapid response in the expression of key transcription factors and lineage markers that only regulate a subset of their targets at a given time, which is followed by chromatin accessibility changes that occur later along with further gene expression changes. We observe differences between promyelocyte- and monocyte-derived macrophages at both the transcriptional and chromatin landscape level, despite using the same differentiation stimulus, which suggest that the path taken by cells in the differentiation landscape defines their end cell state. More generally, our approach of combining neighboring time points and replicates to achieve greater sequencing depth can efficiently infer footprint-based regulatory networks from long series data.\n\nPharmacogenetic Associations of β1-Adrenergic Receptor Polymorphisms With Cardiovascular Outcomes in the SPS3 Trial (Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes).\n\nAuthor information: Magvanjav O1, McDonough CW1, Gong Y1, McClure LA1, Talbert RL1, Horenstein RB1, Shuldiner AR1, Benavente OR1, Mitchell BD1, Johnson JA2; NINDS SiGN (Stroke Genetics Network).\n\n1From the Department of Pharmacotherapy and Translational Research, Center for Pharmacogenomics, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville (O.M., C.W.M., Y.G., J.A.J.); Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Dornsife School of Public Health, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA (L.A.M.); College of Pharmacy, University of Texas, Austin (R.L.T.); Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Nutrition and Program for Personalized and Genomic Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore (R.B.H., A.R.S., B.D.M.); Department of Neurology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada (O.R.B.); and Geriatrics Research and Education Clinical Center, Baltimore Veterans Administration Medical Center, MD (B.D.M.).\n\n2From the Department of Pharmacotherapy and Translational Research, Center for Pharmacogenomics, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville (O.M., C.W.M., Y.G., J.A.J.); Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Dornsife School of Public Health, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA (L.A.M.); College of Pharmacy, University of Texas, Austin (R.L.T.); Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Nutrition and Program for Personalized and Genomic Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore (R.B.H., A.R.S., B.D.M.); Department of Neurology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada (O.R.B.); and Geriatrics Research and Education Clinical Center, Baltimore Veterans Administration Medical Center, MD (B.D.M.). julie.johnson@ufl.edu.\n\nJournal: Stroke\n\nDate of e-pub: May 2017\n\nAbstract: Functional polymorphisms (Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly) in ADRB1 have been associated with cardiovascular and β-blocker response outcomes. Herein we examined associations of these polymorphisms with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), with and without stratification by β-blocker treatment in patients with a history of stroke.\n\nNine hundred and twenty-six participants of the SPS3 trial’s (Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes) genetic substudy with hypertension were included. MACE included stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause death. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used. Because the primary component of MACE was ischemic stroke, we tested the associati"
