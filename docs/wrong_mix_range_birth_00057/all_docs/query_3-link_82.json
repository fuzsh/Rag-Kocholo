After graduating from the University of Michigan, I earned a master’s degree in Wildlife Ecology and Conservation from the University of Florida researching the responses of forest bat communities to fire. I then did my PhD in Integrative Biology from UC Berkeley studying the assembly of carnivorous plant-associated microbial communities.\n\nCourses\n\nFundamentals of Ecology\n\nUnit\n\nIntegrative Community Ecology Unit\n\nMahesh Bandi\n\nProfessor\n\nPhD Physics, University of Pittsburgh 2006.\n\nMS Physics, University of Pittsburgh 2004.\n\nMS Electrical Engineering, University of Pittsburgh 2002.\n\nBE Computer Science and Engineering, University of Madras 1998.\n\nMahesh grew up in India and received his Bachelors' in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of Madras (1998). Following a two year stint in the Indian software industry, he returned to academia and earned his MS Electrical Engineering (2002), MS Physics (2004) and PhD Physics (2006), all from the University of Pittsburgh. He then undertook postdoctoral terms at the Center for Nonlinear Studies and the Materials Physics Applications Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory (2006 - 2009) and the Applied Math.\n\nCourses\n\nAnalytical Mechanics\n\nDynamical Systems\n\nStability Analysis of Nonlinear Systems\n\nUnit\n\nNonlinear and Non-equilibrium Physics Unit\n\nCarlos Cid\n\nProfessor (Adjunct)\n\nPhD in Mathematics, Universidade de Brasília, Brazil, 1999\n\nBSc in Mathematics, Universidade de Brasília, Brazil, 1994\n\nCarlos Cid was awarded his PhD in Mathematics (in the area of combinatorial group theory) in 1999 at the Universidade de Brasília, Brazil. He moved to Europe in early 2000, to take on a post-doctoral researcher position at RWTH-Aachen, Germany. In Aachen he worked on applications of symbolic computation methods for solving systems of partial differential equations. In 2001 Carlos joined a network security startup in Dublin, Ireland, as a software engineer, where he stayed for 2.5 years.\n\nUnit\n\nApplied Cryptography Unit\n\nErik De Schutter\n\nProfessor\n\nBMed, DMed, HabMed from The University of Antwerp\n\nErik De Schutter was born in Antwerp, Belgium. He studied medicine and got his MD in 1984 at the University of Antwerp, where he subsequently specialized as a neuropsychiatrist. During his medical residency he started work on computational modeling of central pattern generation in the leech. In 1990 he became a research fellow at the California Institute of Technology where he developed his famous Purkinje cell model. He returned in 1993 to the University of Antwerp to start the Theoretical Neurobiology group, with a focus on modeling the cerebellum.\n\nCourses\n\nComputational Neuroscience\n\nUnit\n\nComputational Neuroscience Unit\n\nKenji Doya\n\nProfessor\n\nPhD (1991), BS (1984), and MS (1986), Department of Mathematical Engineering and Information Physics, The University of Tokyo\n\nI want to understand how we learn motor skill, make decisions, imagine the future, and communicate and collaborate with others. And understanding means I can build machines that can do the same or more. That is why I study reinforcement learning and probabilistic inference, and how they are realized in the brain.\n\nCourses\n\nAdaptive Systems\n\nBrain Computation\n\nIntroduction to Scientific Computing\n\nUnit\n\nNeural Computation Unit\n\nEvan P.

I was born in Montreal, Canada, and grew up North Carolina, USA, before pursuing undergraduate work at the University of Arizona and graduate work at the University of Texas at Austin. I was a fellow in the Society of Fellows at the University of Michigan from 2009-2012. Since 2012 I have been a faculty member at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology where I lead the Biodiversity and Biocomplexity Unit.
