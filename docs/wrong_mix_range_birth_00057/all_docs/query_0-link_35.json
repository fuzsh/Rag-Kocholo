But they continually returned to its motifs, suggesting its enduring philosophical value. With romance as but one example of ‚Äúabject science,‚Äù we invite papers that ask: How do literary forms (dramatic, narrative, poetic), stylistic strategies, or tropes model ways of knowledge-making alternative or instrumental to natural philosophy? How might the history of science look if we foregrounded such non-normative practices?\n\nüìÅ View Abstracts\n\nKatharine A. Craik, Oxford Brookes University\n\nMary T.

How does the field‚Äôs frequent consideration of leadership in Renaissance texts make us uniquely qualified for this work? How do Renaissance scholar administrators use their critical/historical perspectives to advocate for the humanities? How do we build skills in areas required for leadership that are not part of our scholarly training?

This two-part session will both model best practices for educators using objects as a close-reading exercise as well as give participants the opportunity to share, workshop, and refine their own pedagogical practices, taking skills and methods learned from/during the pandemic and incorporating them into regular teaching practices in person, online, or in a hybrid format.\n\nValerie Billing, Central College\n\nJennifer Black, Boise State University\n\nKatherine Blankenau, Mount Marty University\n\nAmy L.

What kinds of knowledge did comedy‚Äîwith its reliance on confusion and misrecognition, trial and error, tricks and devices‚Äîmake possible? What understandings of matter, environment, bodies? How did stage comedy engage non-dramatic genres of practical knowledge?

We will discuss what it means to write with‚Äîand against‚Äîa historical period that enshrines ideas about politics, class, race, ability, gender and sexuality that have led to the structural inequalities of today. We will pay particular attention to form: what does it mean to use the forms of early modernity in order to question the presumptions and hierarchies of that historical moment and its often damaging legacies for today?\n\nüìÅ View Abstracts\n\nToby Altman, Beloit College\n\nFrederick Bengtsson, University of Kentucky\n\nJoanne Diaz, Illinois Wesleyan University\n\nJoel M.

How do cunning figures wield their knowledge in different social or epistemic registers? Given the interpretative and performative possibilities of cunning, we encourage explorations of how the term and its values are culturally constructed on the Renaissance stage. We welcome investigations that intersect with questions of religion, race/ethnicity, gender/sexuality, disability, or histories of magic, philosophy, and science.\n\nüìÅ View Abstracts\n\nReut Barzilai, University of Haifa\n\nRoya Biggie, Knox College\n\nAni Govjian, Los Angeles, CA\n\nHilary Jayne Gross, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign\n\nJillian Linster, University of South Dakota\n\nIan Munro, University of California, Irvine\n\nAmos Rothschild, St. Thomas Aquinas College\n\nTanya Schmidt, New York University\n\nSeminar\n\nEarly Modern Data\n\nüìå Board Room 2\n\nLEADER: John Ladd, Washington & Jefferson College\n\nThis seminar invites papers on early modern data: the early modern obsession with information collected and arranged for later presentation or study.

While acknowledging this tension, this seminar explores how critical animal studies can engage productively with premodern critical race studies, disability studies, early modern trans studies, and more.\n\nüìÅ View Abstracts\n\nMary Adams, Western Carolina University\n\nBenjamin Bertram, University of Southern Maine\n\nRyan Campagna, University of Chicago\n\nMatthieu A.

But the similarities between the two writers go beyond simple influence or appropriation. Both are cultural icons whose works transcend popular culture and permeate literary, academic, and political discussions, and who are often seen as secular prophets. This seminar invites papers that consider the multiple lines of intersection between Shakespeare, Dylan, and the bardic tradition they represent.\n\nüìÅ View Abstracts\n\nMary Bly, Fordham University\n\nDanielle N.

How did the state come to exercise power through the management of biological life? What social, political, and religious factors combined to reconceive nations as populations rather than territories? How did this shift alter ideas about sexuality, disability, race, class, and literature? Papers may examine literary and non-literary texts on poor relief, life under plague, management of laborers, and colonial projects in Europe and around the world.\n\nüìÅ View Abstracts\n\nDrew Daniel, Johns Hopkins University\n\nKelly A.

We are also developing an open-source template for scholars who are interested in conducting censuses of their own for the surviving corpora of other early modern writers.\n\nüîó Visit Project Website\n\nDigital Exhibit\n\nREED and Taxonomies: Toward a Classification of the Early Modern Everything\n\nüìå Symphony Ballroom\n\nEXHIBITOR: Tanya Hagen, University of Toronto\n\nThis session showcases REED Online, the web-based, open access resource launched in 2016 by the Records of Early English Drama project as a successor to our print-based series. Producing REED in an electronic environment involves a large-scale rethinking of how we name and classify the myriad entities that a collection comprehends, particularly as we think toward broad interoperability with other digital humanities resources.\n\nüîó Visit Project Website\n\nDigital Exhibit\n\nRethinking the Canon: Integrating Corpus Linguistics into Traditional Literary Analysis\n\nüìå Symphony Ballroom\n\nEXHIBITOR: Lily Freeman-Jones, Queen Mary University of London\n\nThis project presents a doctoral thesis as an example of how corpus linguistics might be incorporated by a wider range of literary scholars, without digital humanities expertise. It also evaluates computer-generated and traditional manual methods to create a lexical field. In doing so, it ultimately aims to foster discussion about how and why we work the way we do today.\n\nDigital Exhibit\n\nUnfortunate Creatures: Pre-modern Natural Disaster Narratives\n\nüìå Symphony Ballroom\n\nEXHIBITOR: Ian F.

As monarchs with limits, and as particularly embodied agents of nationalism, queens both historical and imagined mark English and other cultural identities in specifically complex terms. This seminar will examine how queens act out race, gender, and nationalist power in divergent and emergent forms.\n\nüìÅ View Abstracts\n\nMichelle Ephraim, Worcester Polytechnic Institute\n\nTamara A.

Writers from preachers to playwrights had something to say about it. How was form used to ameliorate systemic hunger in England? How did writers experience food insecurity? How does their literary work relate to this experience? How do race, class, gender, and religion factor into written responses to hunger? How can we leverage the innovations of English writers to think through productive responses to 21st century food insecurity?\n\nEric Dunnum, Campbell University\n\nRebecca Lemon, University of Southern California\n\nAshley Sarpong, Yale University\n\nRob Wakeman, Mount St. Mary College\n\nEunwoo Yoo, University of California, Santa Barbara\n\nSeminar\n\nScreen Shakespeares: Form and Technology\n\nüìå Marquette IX\n\nLEADERS: Greg Semenza, University of Connecticut and Garrett Sullivan, Pennsylvania State University\n\nThis seminar focuses on how the formal and technological elements of film, video and television construct interpretations of Shakespeare. Participants are encouraged to think about ‚Äúscreen‚Äù Shakespeares broadly‚Äîin movies, TV programs, video games, etc.‚Äîwhile prioritizing lighting, framing, sound design, and tracking, as well as other non-traditional production elements that fuse together filmic and non-filmic Shakespeares (CGI and other animation techniques, and computer programming).\n\nBenjamin Broadribb, Shakespeare Institute, University of Birmingham\n\nMark T.

Deploying rigorous theoretical and methodological approaches can assist in illuminating more precisely how pop culture uses Shakespeare to uphold, contest, and (re-)shape existing racial imaginaries. We thus invite papers taking a wide range of disciplined approaches to consider the social and ideological implications of the triangulation between Shakespeare, pop culture, and race.\n\nüìÅ View Abstracts\n\nBrandon Christopher, University of Winnipeg\n\nClaire Dawkins, Stanford University Online High School\n\nVernon G.
