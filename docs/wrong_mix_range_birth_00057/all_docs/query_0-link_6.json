        "text": "Page 54 Yukio Mishima. This Album is not an invitation to add any photos in your photo stream or favourites that would have made my grandmothers blush. Thanks.\n\nKimitake Hiraoka (平岡 公威, Hiraoka Kimitake, January 14, 1925 – November 25, 1970), known also under the pen name Yukio Mishima[a] (三島 由紀夫, Mishima Yukio), was a Japanese author, poet, playwright, actor, model, film director, nationalist, and founder of the Tatenokai. Mishima is considered one of the most important Japanese authors of the 20th century. He was considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1968, but the award went to his countryman and friend Yasunari Kawabata.[5] His works include the novels Confessions of a Mask and The Temple of the Golden Pavilion as well as the autobiographical essay Sun and Steel. Mishima's work is characterized by \"its luxurious vocabulary and decadent metaphors, its fusion of traditional Japanese and modern Western literary styles, and its obsessive assertions of the unity of beauty, eroticism and death\".[6]\n\nBorn: Kimitake Hiraoka. January 14, 1925. Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan\n\nDied: November 25, 1970 (aged 45).

On November 25, 1970, Mishima and four members of his militia entered a military base in central Tokyo, took the commandant hostage, and attempted to inspire the Japan Self-Defense Forces to overturn Japan's 1947 Constitution. When this was unsuccessful, Mishima committed seppuku.\n\nEarly life:\n\nMishima in his childhood (c. April 1931):\n\nMishima was born in the Yotsuya district of Tokyo (now part of Shinjuku). His father was \"Azusa Hiraoka\" (平岡梓), a government official, and his mother, \"Shizue\" (倭文重), was the daughter of the 5th principal of the Kaisei Academy. Shizue's father, \"Kenzō Hashi\" (橋健三), was a scholar of Chinese classics, and the Hashi family had served the Maeda clan for generations in Kaga Domain. Mishima's paternal grandparents were \"Sadatarō Hiraoka\" (平岡定太郎) and \"Natsuko\" (なつ) (family register name: Natsu). He had a younger sister, \"Mitsuko\"(美津子), who died of typhus in 1945 at the age of 17, and a younger brother, \"Chiyuki\"(千之).[11][page needed]\n\nMishima's early childhood was dominated by the presence of his grandmother, Natsuko (Natsu), who took the boy, separating him from his immediate family for several years.[12] Natsuko was the granddaughter of \"Matsudaira Yoritaka\" (松平頼位), the daimyōof Shishido in Hitachi Province, and had been raised in the household of Prince Arisugawa Taruhito; she maintained considerable aristocratic pretensions even after marrying Sadatarō Hiraoka(Mishima's grandfather), a bureaucrat who had made his fortune in the newly opened colonial frontier in the north and who eventually became Governor-General of Karafuto Prefecture on Sakhalin Island. Through his grandmother, Mishima was a direct descendant of Tokugawa Ieyasu.[13] Natsuko was prone to violence and morbid outbursts, which are occasionally alluded to in Mishima's works.[14] It is to Natsuko that some biographers have traced Mishima's fascination with death.[15] Natsuko did not allow Mishima to venture into the sunlight, to engage in any kind of sport or to play with other boys; he spent much of his time alone or with female cousins and their dolls.[14]\n\nMishima returned to his immediate family when he was 12. His father was a man with a taste for military discipline, and employed parenting tactics such as holding the young boy up to the side of a speeding train. He also raided Mishima's room for evidence of an \"effeminate\" interest in literature and often ripped apart the son's manuscripts.[16]\n\nSchooling and early works:\n\nAt the age of six, Mishima enrolled in the elite Gakushūin, the Peers' School in Tokyo.[17] At twelve, Mishima began to write his first stories. He voraciously read the works of numerous classic Japanese authors as well as Raymond Radiguet, Oscar Wilde, Rainer Maria Rilke, Thomas Mann and other European authors, in translation. He studied German. After six years at school, he became the youngest member of the editorial board of its literary society. Mishima was attracted to the works of the Japanese author \"Shizuo Itō\" (伊東静雄), \"Haruo Satō\" (佐藤春夫), \"Michizō Tachihara\" (立原道造), which in turn created an appreciation for the classical Japanese poetry form of waka. Mishima's first published works included waka poetry before he turned his attention to prose.\n\nHe was invited to write a short story for the Gakushūin literary magazine \"Hojinkai-zasshi\" (輔仁会雑誌) and submitted Hanazakari no Mori (花ざかりの森, \"Forest in Full Bloom\"), a story in which the narrator describes the feeling that his ancestors somehow still live within him. Mishima's teachers were so impressed that they recommended the story to the prestigious literary magazine Bungei-Bunka (文藝文化), which belongs to \"Nihon Roman-ha\" (日本浪曼派, \"Japanese Romantic School\"). The story makes use of the metaphors and aphorismsthat later became his trademarks and was published in book form in 1944 in a limited edition (4,000 copies) because of the wartime shortage of paper. To protect him from a possible backlash from his father Azusa, his teacher and Bungei-Bunka’s members(Fumio Shimizu (清水文雄), Zenmei Hasuda (蓮田善明), etc.) coined the pen-name \"Yukio Mishima\". [18] In the magazine, Zenmei Hasuda praised Mishima’s genius as below, \"This juvenile author is also a heaven-sent child of eternal Japanese history. He is much younger than us, but is the birth of already mature\".[19] Then, on the day of embarking to the Java, Singapore, Johor(Southern Front of Pacific War) on October 1943, Hasuda told Mishima, \"I entrusted you with the future of Japan\".[20][21]\n\nMishima's story Tabako (煙草, \"The Cigarette\"), published in 1946, describes some of a pale love he felt at school when he teased from members of the school's rugby union club that he belonged to the literary society. And also, Shi o Kaku Shōnen (詩を書く少年, \"The Boy Who Wrote Poetry\") in 1954 is one of the short story based on school memories.\n\nMishima received a draft notice for the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II, and he barely passed the second class test on 27 April 1944. However, at the time of his medical check up on convocation day of 10 February 1945 he had a cold and the young army doctor heard rales from the lung which were misdiagnosed as tuberculosis so Mishima was declared unfit for service.[22][16]\n\nAlthough his authoritarian father had forbidden him to write any further stories, Mishima continued to write every night in secret, supported and protected by his mother, who was always the first to read a new story. Attending lectures during the day and writing at night, Mishima graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1947. He obtained a position as an official in the government's Finance Ministry and was set up for a promising career. However, Mishima had exhausted himself so much that his father agreed to his resigning from the position during the first year of employment to devote himself to writing.[16]\n\nPost-war literature:\n\nMishima wrote novels, popular serial novellas, short stories and literary essays, as well as highly acclaimed plays for the Kabukitheatre and modern versions of traditional Noh drama. Kemono no Tawamure (獣の戯れ, The Frolic of the Beasts) is considered a parody of the classical Noh play Motomezuka, written in the fourteenth century by the playwright Kiyotsugu Kan'ami. Mishima began the short story Misaki nite no Monogatari (岬にての物語, \"A Story at the Cape\") in 1945, and continued to work on it through the end of World War II. In January 1946, he visited famed writer Yasunari Kawabata in Kamakura, taking with him the manuscripts for Chūsei (中世, \"The Middle Ages\") and Tabako, and asking for Kawabata's advice and assistance. In June 1946, following Kawabata's recommendations, Tabako (煙草, \"The Cigarette\") was published in the new literary magazine Ningen (人間, \"Humanity\").\n\nAlso in 1946, Mishima began his first novel, Tōzoku (盗賊, \"Thieves\"), a story about two young members of the aristocracy drawn towards suicide. It was published in 1948, placing Mishima in the ranks of the Second Generation of Postwar Writers. He followed with Kamen no Kokuhaku (仮面の告白, Confessions of a Mask), a semi-autobiographical account of a young homosexual who must hide behind a mask to fit into society. The novel was extremely successful and made Mishima a celebrity at the age of 24. Around 1949, Mishima published an essay about Yasunari Kawabatain Kindai Bungaku (近代文学), for whom he had always had a deep appreciation.\n\nHis writing gained him international celebrity and a sizeable following in Europe and the United States, as many of his most famous works were translated into English. Mishima traveled extensively; in 1952 he visited Greece, which had fascinated him since childhood. Elements from his visit appear in Shiosai (潮騒, \"Sound of the Waves\"), which was published in 1954, and drew inspiration from the Greek legend of Daphnis and Chloe.\n\nMishima made use of contemporary events in many of his works. Kinkakuji (金閣寺, \"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion\") published in 1956 is a fictionalization of the burning of the famous temple in Kyoto. Utage noo ato (宴のあと, \"After the Banquet\"), published in 1960, so closely followed the events surrounding politician Hachirō Arita's campaign to become governor of Tokyo that Mishima was sued for invasion of privacy.[23] In 1962, Mishima's most avant-garde work, Utsukusii hoshi (美しい星, \"A Beautiful Star\"), which at times comes close to science fiction, was published to mixed critical response.\n\nMishima was considered for the Nobel Prize for Literature three times[24] and was a favourite of many foreign publications.[25]However, in 1968 his early mentor Kawabata won the Nobel Prize and Mishima realized that the chances of it being given to another Japanese author in the near future were slim.[26] In a work published in 1970, Mishima wrote that the writers he paid most attention to in modern western literature were Georges Bataille, Pierre Klossowski, and Witold Gombrowicz.[27]\n\nActing and modelling:\n\nMishima was also an actor, and had a starring role in Yasuzo Masumura's 1960 film, Karakkaze yaro (からっ風野郎, \"Afraid to Die\"). He also had roles in films including Yukoku (憂国, \"Patriotism, the Rite of Love and Death\") (directed by himself, 1966), Kurotokage (黒蜥蜴, \"Black Lizard\") (directed by Kinji Fukasaku, 1968) and Hitokiri (人斬り, \"Hitokiri\") (directed by Hideo Gosha, 1969). He also sang the theme song for Afraid to Die(lyrics by himself; music by Shichirō Fukazawa).\n\nMishima was featured as a photo model in Bara-kei (薔薇刑, \"Ba-ra-kei: Ordeal by Roses\") by Eikoh Hosoe, as well as in Nihon no bodybuilder tachi (体道～日本のボディビルダーたち, \"Young Samurai: Bodybuilders of Japan\") and Otoko (男, \"Otoko: Photo Studies of the Young Japanese Male\") by Tamotsu Yatō. American author Donald Richie gave a short lively account of Mishima, dressed in a loincloth and armed with a sword, posing in the snow for one of Tamotsu Yato'sphotoshoots.[28]\n\nIn 1955, Mishima took up weight training and his workout regimen of three sessions per week was not disrupted for the final 15 years of his life. In his 1968 essay Sun and Steel,[29] Mishima deplored the emphasis given by intellectuals to the mind over the body. Mishima later also became very skilled at kendo, traditional Japanese swordsmanship.\n\nAfter briefly considering a marital alliance with Michiko Shōda (who later married Crown Prince Akihito and became Empress Emerita Michiko),[30] Mishima married Yoko Sugiyama (瑤子)(daughter of Yasushi Sugiyama (杉山寧)) on June 11, 1958. The couple had two children: a daughter named Noriko (紀子) (born June 2, 1959) and a son named Iichiro (威一郎) (born May 2, 1962).\n\nWhile working on Kinjiki (禁色, \"Forbidden Colors\"), Mishima visited gay bars in Japan.[31] Mishima's sexual orientation was an issue that bothered his widow, and she always denied his homosexuality after his death.[32] In 1998, the writer Jiro Fukushima published an account of his relationship with Mishima in 1951, including fifteen letters between himself and the famed novelist. Mishima's children successfully sued Fukushima for violation of copyright on his letters.[33]\n\nIn 1967, Mishima enlisted in the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) and underwent basic training. A year later, he formed the Tatenokai (\"shield society\"), a private militia composed primarily of young students who studied martial principles and physical discipline, and swore to protect the Emperor of Japan. Mishima trained them himself. However, under Mishima's ideology, the emperor was not necessarily the reigning Emperor, but rather the abstract essence of Japan. In Eirei no koe (英霊の聲, \"The Voices of the Heroic Dead\"), Mishima denounced Emperor Hirohito for renouncing his claim of divinity after World War II, arguing that millions of Japanese had died in the war for their \"living god\" Emperor, and that the Showa Emperor's renouncing his divinity meant that all those deaths were in vain.[34]\n\nIn the final ten years of his life, Mishima wrote several full-length plays, acted in several films, and co-directed an adaptation of one of his stories, Patriotism, the Rite of Love and Death. He also continued work on his final tetralogy, Hōjō no Umi (豊饒の海, \"The Sea of Fertility\"), which appeared in monthly serialized format from September 1965.[35]\n\nMishima espoused a very individual brand of nationalism towards the end of his life. He was hated by leftists, in particular for his outspoken commitment to bushido, the code of the samurai, and by mainstream nationalists for his contention, in Bunka Bōeiron (文化防衛論, \"A Defense of Culture\"), that Hirohito should have abdicated and taken responsibility for the loss of life in the war.\n\nOn November 25, 1970, Mishima and four members of the Tatenokai (楯の会, \"Shield Society\"), under pretext, visited the commandant of the Ichigaya Camp, the Tokyo headquarters of the Eastern Command of the Japan Self-Defense Forces.[32] Inside, they barricaded the office and tied the commandant to his chair. With a prepared manifesto and a banner listing their demands, Mishima stepped onto the balcony to address the soldiers gathered below. His speech was intended to inspire a coup d'état to restore the power of the emperor. He succeeded only in irritating the soldiers, and was mocked and jeered. He finished his planned speech after a few minutes, returned to the commandant's office and performed seppuku. The assisting kaishakunin duty at the end of this ritual (to decapitate Mishima) had been assigned to Tatenokai member Masakatsu Morita, who was unable to properly perform the task. After three failed attempts at severing Mishima's head, he allowed another Tatenokai member, Hiroyasu Koga, to behead Mishima. Morita then knelt and stabbed himself in the abdomen and Koga again performed the kaishakunin duty.[36] This coup is called \"Mishima jiken\" (三島事件, \"Mishima Incident\") in Japan.\n\nAnother traditional element of the suicide ritual was the composition of so-called death poems before their entry into the headquarters.[37] Mishima planned his suicide meticulously for at least a year and no one outside the group of hand-picked Tatenokai members had any indication of what he was planning. His biographer, translator John Nathan, suggests that the coup attempt was only a pretext for the ritual suicide of which Mishima had long dreamed.[38] Mishima made sure his affairs were in order and left money for the legal defence of the three surviving Tatenokaimembers.\n\nLegacy:\n\nMuch speculation has surrounded Mishima's suicide. At the time of his death he had just completed the final book in his Sea of Fertility tetralogy.[32] He was recognized as one of the most important post-war stylists of the Japanese language. Mishima wrote 34 novels, about 50 plays, about 25 books of short stories, and at least 35 books of essays, one libretto, as well as one film.\n\nMishima's grave is located at the Tama Cemetery in Fuchū, Tokyo. The Mishima Prize was established in 1988 to honor his life and works. On July 3, 1999, \"Mishima Yukio Bungaku-kan\" (三島由紀夫文学館, \"Mishima Yukio Literary Museum\") was opened in Yamanakako.\n\nA Memorial service Deathday for Misima, called \"Yukoku-ki\" (憂国忌), is held every year in Japan on 25 November.\n\nA 1985 biographical film by Paul Schradertitled Mishima: A Life in Four Chaptersdepicts his life and work; however, it has never been given a theatrical presentation in Japan. A 2012 film titled 11:25 The Day He Chose His Own Fate also looks at Mishima's last day.\n\nIn 2014, Mishima was one of the inaugural honourees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco's Castro neighbourhood noting LGBTQ people who have \"made significant contributions in their fields.\"[39][40][41]\n\nDavid Bowie painted a large expressionist portrait of Mishima, which he hung at his Berlin residence.[42]\n\nAwards:\n\nShincho Prize from Shinchosha Publishing, 1954, for The Sound of Waves\n\nKishida Prize for Drama from Shinchosha Publishing, 1955 for Shiroari no Su (白蟻の巣, \"Termites' nest\")\n\nYomiuri Prize from Yomiuri Newspaper Co., for best novel, 1956, The Temple of the Golden Pavilion[43]\n\nShuukan Yomiuri Prize for Shingeki from Yomiuri Newspaper Co., 1958, for Bara to Kaizoku (薔薇と海賊, \"Rose and Pirate\")\n\nYomiuri Prize from Yomiuri Newspaper Co., for best drama, 1961, Toka no Kiku (十日の菊, \"The chrysanthemum on the tenth\", \"The day after the fair\")\n\nOne of six finalists for the Nobel Prize in Literature, 1963.[44]\n\nMainichi Art Prize from Mainichi Shimbun, 1964, for Silk and Insight\n\nArt Festival Prize from Ministry of Education, 1965, for Madame de Sade.\n\nPage 55/ Yukio Mishima.

Elements from his visit appear in Shiosai (潮騒, \"Sound of the Waves\"), which was published in 1954, and drew inspiration from the Greek legend of Daphnis and Chloe.\n\nMishima made use of contemporary events in many of his works. Kinkakuji (金閣寺, \"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion\") published in 1956 is a fictionalization of the burning of the famous temple in Kyoto. Utage noo ato (宴のあと, \"After the Banquet\"), published in 1960, so closely followed the events surrounding politician Hachirō Arita's campaign to become governor of Tokyo that Mishima was sued for invasion of privacy.[23] In 1962, Mishima's most avant-garde work, Utsukusii hoshi (美しい星, \"A Beautiful Star\"), which at times comes close to science fiction, was published to mixed critical response.\n\nMishima was considered for the Nobel Prize for Literature three times[24] and was a favourite of many foreign publications.[25]However, in 1968 his early mentor Kawabata won the Nobel Prize and Mishima realized that the chances of it being given to another Japanese author in the near future were slim.[26] In a work published in 1970, Mishima wrote that the writers he paid most attention to in modern western literature were Georges Bataille, Pierre Klossowski, and Witold Gombrowicz.[27]\n\nActing and modelling:\n\nMishima was also an actor, and had a starring role in Yasuzo Masumura's 1960 film, Karakkaze yaro (からっ風野郎, \"Afraid to Die\"). He also had roles in films including Yukoku (憂国, \"Patriotism, the Rite of Love and Death\") (directed by himself, 1966), Kurotokage (黒蜥蜴, \"Black Lizard\") (directed by Kinji Fukasaku, 1968) and Hitokiri (人斬り, \"Hitokiri\") (directed by Hideo Gosha, 1969). He also sang the theme song for Afraid to Die(lyrics by himself; music by Shichirō Fukazawa).\n\nMishima was featured as a photo model in Bara-kei (薔薇刑, \"Ba-ra-kei: Ordeal by Roses\") by Eikoh Hosoe, as well as in Nihon no bodybuilder tachi (体道～日本のボディビルダーたち, \"Young Samurai: Bodybuilders of Japan\") and Otoko (男, \"Otoko: Photo Studies of the Young Japanese Male\") by Tamotsu Yatō. American author Donald Richie gave a short lively account of Mishima, dressed in a loincloth and armed with a sword, posing in the snow for one of Tamotsu Yato'sphotoshoots.[28]\n\nIn 1955, Mishima took up weight training and his workout regimen of three sessions per week was not disrupted for the final 15 years of his life. In his 1968 essay Sun and Steel,[29] Mishima deplored the emphasis given by intellectuals to the mind over the body. Mishima later also became very skilled at kendo, traditional Japanese swordsmanship.\n\nAfter briefly considering a marital alliance with Michiko Shōda (who later married Crown Prince Akihito and became Empress Emerita Michiko),[30] Mishima married Yoko Sugiyama (瑤子)(daughter of Yasushi Sugiyama (杉山寧)) on June 11, 1958. The couple had two children: a daughter named Noriko (紀子) (born June 2, 1959) and a son named Iichiro (威一郎) (born May 2, 1962).\n\nWhile working on Kinjiki (禁色, \"Forbidden Colors\"), Mishima visited gay bars in Japan.[31] Mishima's sexual orientation was an issue that bothered his widow, and she always denied his homosexuality after his death.[32] In 1998, the writer Jiro Fukushima published an account of his relationship with Mishima in 1951, including fifteen letters between himself and the famed novelist. Mishima's children successfully sued Fukushima for violation of copyright on his letters.[33]\n\nIn 1967, Mishima enlisted in the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) and underwent basic training. A year later, he formed the Tatenokai (\"shield society\"), a private militia composed primarily of young students who studied martial principles and physical discipline, and swore to protect the Emperor of Japan. Mishima trained them himself. However, under Mishima's ideology, the emperor was not necessarily the reigning Emperor, but rather the abstract essence of Japan. In Eirei no koe (英霊の聲, \"The Voices of the Heroic Dead\"), Mishima denounced Emperor Hirohito for renouncing his claim of divinity after World War II, arguing that millions of Japanese had died in the war for their \"living god\" Emperor, and that the Showa Emperor's renouncing his divinity meant that all those deaths were in vain.[34]\n\nIn the final ten years of his life, Mishima wrote several full-length plays, acted in several films, and co-directed an adaptation of one of his stories, Patriotism, the Rite of Love and Death. He also continued work on his final tetralogy, Hōjō no Umi (豊饒の海, \"The Sea of Fertility\"), which appeared in monthly serialized format from September 1965.[35]\n\nMishima espoused a very individual brand of nationalism towards the end of his life. He was hated by leftists, in particular for his outspoken commitment to bushido, the code of the samurai, and by mainstream nationalists for his contention, in Bunka Bōeiron (文化防衛論, \"A Defense of Culture\"), that Hirohito should have abdicated and taken responsibility for the loss of life in the war.\n\nOn November 25, 1970, Mishima and four members of the Tatenokai (楯の会, \"Shield Society\"), under pretext, visited the commandant of the Ichigaya Camp, the Tokyo headquarters of the Eastern Command of the Japan Self-Defense Forces.[32] Inside, they barricaded the office and tied the commandant to his chair. With a prepared manifesto and a banner listing their demands, Mishima stepped onto the balcony to address the soldiers gathered below. His speech was intended to inspire a coup d'état to restore the power of the emperor. He succeeded only in irritating the soldiers, and was mocked and jeered. He finished his planned speech after a few minutes, returned to the commandant's office and performed seppuku. The assisting kaishakunin duty at the end of this ritual (to decapitate Mishima) had been assigned to Tatenokai member Masakatsu Morita, who was unable to properly perform the task. After three failed attempts at severing Mishima's head, he allowed another Tatenokai member, Hiroyasu Koga, to behead Mishima. Morita then knelt and stabbed himself in the abdomen and Koga again performed the kaishakunin duty.[36] This coup is called \"Mishima jiken\" (三島事件, \"Mishima Incident\") in Japan.\n\nAnother traditional element of the suicide ritual was the composition of so-called death poems before their entry into the headquarters.[37] Mishima planned his suicide meticulously for at least a year and no one outside the group of hand-picked Tatenokai members had any indication of what he was planning. His biographer, translator John Nathan, suggests that the coup attempt was only a pretext for the ritual suicide of which Mishima had long dreamed.[38] Mishima made sure his affairs were in order and left money for the legal defence of the three surviving Tatenokaimembers.\n\nLegacy:\n\nMuch speculation has surrounded Mishima's suicide. At the time of his death he had just completed the final book in his Sea of Fertility tetralogy.[32] He was recognized as one of the most important post-war stylists of the Japanese language. Mishima wrote 34 novels, about 50 plays, about 25 books of short stories, and at least 35 books of essays, one libretto, as well as one film.\n\nMishima's grave is located at the Tama Cemetery in Fuchū, Tokyo. The Mishima Prize was established in 1988 to honor his life and works. On July 3, 1999, \"Mishima Yukio Bungaku-kan\" (三島由紀夫文学館, \"Mishima Yukio Literary Museum\") was opened in Yamanakako.\n\nA Memorial service Deathday for Misima, called \"Yukoku-ki\" (憂国忌), is held every year in Japan on 25 November.\n\nA 1985 biographical film by Paul Schradertitled Mishima: A Life in Four Chaptersdepicts his life and work; however, it has never been given a theatrical presentation in Japan. A 2012 film titled 11:25 The Day He Chose His Own Fate also looks at Mishima's last day.\n\nIn 2014, Mishima was one of the inaugural honourees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco's Castro neighbourhood noting LGBTQ people who have \"made significant contributions in their fields.\"[39][40][41]\n\nDavid Bowie painted a large expressionist portrait of Mishima, which he hung at his Berlin residence.[42]\n\nAwards:\n\nShincho Prize from Shinchosha Publishing, 1954, for The Sound of Waves\n\nKishida Prize for Drama from Shinchosha Publishing, 1955 for Shiroari no Su (白蟻の巣, \"Termites' nest\")\n\nYomiuri Prize from Yomiuri Newspaper Co., for best novel, 1956, The Temple of the Golden Pavilion[43]\n\nShuukan Yomiuri Prize for Shingeki from Yomiuri Newspaper Co., 1958, for Bara to Kaizoku (薔薇と海賊, \"Rose and Pirate\")\n\nYomiuri Prize from Yomiuri Newspaper Co., for best drama, 1961, Toka no Kiku (十日の菊, \"The chrysanthemum on the tenth\", \"The day after the fair\")\n\nOne of six finalists for the Nobel Prize in Literature, 1963.[44]\n\nMainichi Art Prize from Mainichi Shimbun, 1964, for Silk and Insight\n\nArt Festival Prize from Ministry of Education, 1965, for Madame de Sade.\n\nThe capture of the southern gate of Tianjin. British troops were positioned on the left, Japanese troops at the centre, French troops on the right.\n\nMassacres by the Westerners: After the liberation of legations, the military, settlers, blinded by the presence of mutilated bodies, impaled bodies, heads placed in pyramids, and countless Christian Chinese corpses defiling the water wells, and in a state of decomposition in the ditches, commit the worst atrocities. They kill the people accused of being Boxers by the thousands, loot, rape, and be photographed on the imperial throne.\n\nThe Boxer Rebellion, Boxer Uprising or Yihetuan Movement was a violent anti-foreign, anti-colonial, and anti-Christian uprising that took place in China between 1899 and 1901, towards the end of the Qing dynasty. It was initiated by the Militia United in Righteousness (Yihetuan), known in English as the \"Boxers\", for many of their members had been practioners of the martial arts, such as boxing. They were motivated by proto-nationalist sentiments and opposition to Western colonialism and associated Christian missionary activity. The uprising took place against a background of severe drought and the disruption caused by the growth of foreign spheres of influence. After several months of growing violence against both the foreign and Christian presence in Shandong and the North China plain in June 1900, Boxer fighters, convinced they were invulnerable to foreign weapons, converged on Beijing with the slogan \"Support the Qing government and exterminate the foreigners.\" Foreigners and Chinese Christians sought refuge in the Legation Quarter. In response to reports of an armed invasion to lift the siege, the initially hesitant Empress Dowager Cixi supported the Boxers and on June 21 issued an Imperial Decree declaring war on the foreign powers. Diplomats, foreign civilians and soldiers as well as Chinese Christians in the Legation Quarter were placed under siege by the Imperial Army of China and the Boxers for 55 days.\n\nChinese officialdom was split between those supporting the Boxers and those favoring conciliation, led by Prince Qing. The supreme commander of the Chinese forces, the Manchu General Ronglu (Junglu), later claimed that he acted to protect the besieged foreigners. The Eight-Nation Alliance, after being initially turned back, brought 20,000 armed troops to China, defeated the Imperial Army, and arrived at Peking on August 14, relieving the siege of the Legations. Uncontrolled plunder of the capital and the surrounding countryside ensued, along with the summary execution of those suspected of being Boxers. The Boxer Protocol of 7 September 1901 provided for the execution of government officials who had supported the Boxers, provisions for foreign troops to be stationed in Beijing, and 450 million taels of silver—approximately $10 billion at 2017 silver prices and more than the government's annual tax revenue—to be paid as indemnity over the course of the next thirty-nine years to the eight nations involved. The Empress Dowager then sponsored a set of institutional and fiscal changes in an attempt to save the Dynasty by reforming it.The Righteous and Harmonious Fists (Yihequan) arose in the inland sections of the northern coastal province of Shandong, long known for social unrest, religious sects, and martial societies. American Christian missionaries were probably the first to refer to the well-trained, athletic young men as \"Boxers\", because of the martial arts and weapons training they practiced. Their primary practice was a type of spiritual possession which involved the whirling of swords, violent prostrations, and chanting incantations to deities.The opportunities to fight back Western encroachment and colonization were especially attractive to unemployed village men, many of whom were teenagers.[8] The tradition of possession and invulnerability went back several hundred years but took on special meaning against the powerful new weapons of the West.[9] The Boxers, armed with rifles and swords, claimed supernatural invulnerability towards blows of cannon, rifle shots, and knife attacks. Furthermore, the Boxer groups popularly claimed that millions of soldiers of Heaven would descend to assist them in purifying China of foreign oppression.[10] These beliefs are characteristic of millenarian movements of nativist resistance, especially the characteristic magical belief, shared by the Ghost Dancers of North America and the Kartelite Cults of Africa, that the believer could be rendered invulnerable to bullets.In 1895, in spite of ambivalence toward their heterodox practices, Yuxian, a Manchu who was then prefect of Caozhou and would later become provincial governor, used the Big Swords Society in fighting bandits. The Big Swords, emboldened by this official support, also attacked their local Catholic village rivals, who turned to the Church for protection. The Big Swords responded by attacking Catholic churches and burning them. \"The line between Christians and bandits\", remarks one recent historian, \"became increasingly indistinct.\" As a result of diplomatic pressure in the capital, Yuxian executed several Big Sword leaders, but did not punish anyone else. More martial secret societies started emerging after this. The early years saw a variety of village activities, not a broad movement with a united purpose. Martial folk religious societies such as the Baguadao (Eight Trigrams) prepared the way for the Boxers. Like the Red Boxing school or the Plum Flower Boxers, the Boxers of Shandong were more concerned with traditional social and moral values, such as filial piety, than with foreign influences. One leader, Zhu Hongdeng (Red Lantern Zhu), started as a wandering healer, specializing in skin ulcers, and gained wide respect by refusing payment for his treatments.[13] Zhu claimed descent from Ming dynasty emperors, since his surname was the surname of the Ming imperial family. He announced that his goal was to \"Revive the Qing and destroy the foreigners\" (\"扶清灭洋 fu Qing mie yang\"). The combination of extreme weather conditions, Western attempts at colonizing China and growing anti-imperialist sentiment fueled the movement. First, a drought followed by floods in Shandong province in 1897–1898 forced farmers to flee to cities and seek food. As one observer said, \"I am convinced that a few days' heavy rainfall to terminate the long-continued drought ... would do more to restore tranquility than any measures which either the Chinese government or foreign governments can take.\" A French political cartoon depicting China as a pie about to be carved up by Queen Victoria (Britain), Kaiser Wilhelm II (Germany), Tsar Nicholas II (Russia), Marianne (France) and a samurai (Japan), while a Chinese mandarin helplessly looks on.\n\nA major cause of discontent in north China was missionary activity. The Treaty of Tientsin (or Tianjin) and the Convention of Peking, signed in 1860 after the Second Opium War, had granted foreign missionaries the freedom to preach anywhere in China and to buy land on which to build churches.[16] On 1 November 1897, a band of armed men who were perhaps members of the Big Swords Society stormed the residence of a German missionary from the Society of the Divine Word and killed two priests. This attack is known as the Juye Incident. When Kaiser Wilhelm II received news of these murders, he dispatched the German East Asia Squadron to occupy Jiaozhou Bay on the southern coast of the Shandong peninsula. Germany's action triggered a \"scramble for concessions\" by which Britain, France, Russia and Japan also secured their own sphere of influence in China. In October 1898, a group of Boxers attacked the Christian community of Liyuantun village where a temple to the Jade Emperor had been converted into a Catholic church. Disputes had surrounded the church since 1869, when the temple had been granted to the Christian residents of the village. This incident marked the first time the Boxers used the slogan \"Support the Qing, destroy the foreigners\" (\"扶清灭洋 fu Qing mie yang\") that would later characterise them. The \"Boxers\" called themselves the \"Militia United in Righteousness\" for the first time one year later, at the Battle of Senluo Temple (October 1899), a clash between Boxers and Qing government troops. By using the word \"Militia\" rather than \"Boxers\", they distanced themselves from forbidden martial arts sects, and tried to give their movement the legitimacy of a group that defended orthodoxy.\n\nAggression toward missionaries and Christians drew the ire of foreign (mainly European) governments. In 1899, the French minister in Beijing helped the missionaries to obtain an edict granting official status to every order in the Roman Catholic hierarchy, enabling local priests to support their people in legal or family disputes and bypass the local officials. After the German government took over Shandong many Chinese feared that the foreign missionaries and quite possibly all Christian activities were imperialist attempts at \"carving the melon\", i.e., to divide and colonize China piece by piece.[23] A Chinese official expressed the animosity towards foreigners succinctly, \"Take away your missionaries and your opium and you will be welcome.\" The early growth of the Boxer movement coincided with the Hundred Days' Reform (11 June – 21 September 1898). Progressive Chinese officials, with support from Protestant missionaries, persuaded the Guangxu Emperor to institute reforms which alienated many conservative officials by their sweeping nature. Such opposition from conservative officials led Empress Dowager Cixi to intervene and reverse the reforms. The failure of the reform movement disillusioned many educated Chinese and thus further weakened the Qing government. After the reforms ended, the conservative Empress Dowager Cixi seized power and placed the reformist Guangxu Emperor under house arrest.\n\nThe national crisis was widely seen as being caused by foreign aggression. Foreign powers had defeated China in several wars, forced a right to promote Christianity and imposed unequal treaties under which foreigners and foreign companies in China were accorded special privileges, extraterritorial rights and immunities from Chinese law, causing resentment among the Chinese. France, Japan, Russia and Germany carved out spheres of influence, so that by 1900 it appeared that China would likely be dismembered, with foreign powers each ruling a part of the country. Thus, by 1900, the Qing dynasty, which had ruled China for more than two centuries, was crumbling and Chinese culture was under assault by powerful and unfamiliar religions and secular cultures. Chinese Muslim troops from Gansu, also known as the Gansu Braves, killed a Japanese diplomat on 11 June 1900. Foreigners called them the \"10,000 Islamic rabble.\" In January 1900, with a majority of conservatives in the imperial court, Empress Dowager Cixi changed her long standing policy of suppressing Boxers, and issued edicts in their defence, causing protests from foreign powers. In spring 1900, the Boxer movement spread rapidly north from Shandong into the countryside near Beijing. Boxers burned Christian churches, killed Chinese Christians and intimidated Chinese officials who stood in their way. American Minister Edwin H. Conger cabled Washington, \"the whole country is swarming with hungry, discontented, hopeless idlers.\" On 30 May the diplomats, led by British Minister Claude Maxwell MacDonald, requested that foreign soldiers come to Beijing to defend the legations. The Chinese government reluctantly acquiesced, and the next day an international force of 435 navy troops from eight countries disembarked from warships and travelled by train from Dagu (Taku) to Beijing. They set up defensive perimeters around their respective missions.On 5 June, the railway line to Tianjin was cut by Boxers in the countryside and Beijing was isolated. On 11 June, at Yongding gate, the secretary of the Japanese legation, Sugiyama Akira, was attacked and killed by the soldiers of general Dong Fuxiang, who were guarding the southern part of the Beijing walled city. Armed with Mauser rifles but wearing traditional uniforms,Dong's troops had threatened the foreign Legations in the fall of 1898 soon after arriving in Beijing, so much that troops from the United States Marine Corps had been called to Beijing to guard the legations. The German Kaiser Wilhelm II was so alarmed by the Chinese Muslim troops that he requested the Caliph Abdul Hamid II of the Ottoman Empire to find a way to stop the Muslim troops from fighting. The Caliph agreed to the Kaiser's request and sent Enver Pasha (not the future Young Turk leader) to China in 1901, but the rebellion was over by that time. Also on 11 June, the first Boxer, dressed in his finery, was seen in the Legation Quarter. The German Minister, Clemens von Ketteler, and German soldiers captured a Boxer boy and inexplicably executed him.[34] In response, thousands of Boxers burst into the walled city of Beijing that afternoon and burned many of the Christian churches and cathedrals in the city, burning some victims alive.[35] American and British missionaries had taken refuge in the Methodist Mission and an attack there was repulsed by American Marines. The soldiers at the British Embassy and German Legations shot and killed several Boxers,[36] alienating the Chinese population of the city and nudging the Qing government toward support of the Boxers. The Muslim Gansu braves and Boxers, along with other Chinese then attacked and killed Chinese Christians around the legations in revenge for foreign attacks on Chinese. Japanese marines who served in the Seymour Expedition. As the situation grew more violent, a second international force of 2,000 sailors and marines under the command of the British Vice-Admiral Edward Seymour, the largest contingent being British, was dispatched from Dagu to Beijing on 10 June 1900. The troops were transported by train from Dagu to Tianjin with the agreement of the Chinese government, but the railway between Tianjin and Beijing had been severed. Seymour resolved to move forward and repair the railway, or progress on foot if necessary, keeping in mind that the distance between Tianjin and Beijing was only 120 km. When Seymour left Tianjin and started toward Beijing, it angered the imperial court. As a result, the pro-Boxer Manchu Prince Duan became leader of the Zongli Yamen (foreign office), replacing Prince Qing. Prince Duan was a member of the imperial Aisin Gioro clan (foreigners called him a \"Blood Royal\"), and Empress Dowager Cixi had named her son as next in line for the imperial throne. He became the effective leader of the Boxers, and he was extremely anti-foreigner like his friend Dong Fuxiang, and wanted to expel them from China. He soon ordered the Qing imperial army to attack the foreign forces. Confused by conflicting orders from Beijing, General Nie Shicheng let Seymour's army pass by in their trains.Admiral Seymour returning to Tianjin with his wounded men, on 26 June. After leaving Tianjin, the convoy quickly reached Langfang, but found the railway there to be destroyed. Seymour's engineers tried to repair the line, but the allied army found itself surrounded, as the railway both behind and in front of them had been destroyed. They were attacked from all parts by Chinese irregulars and Chinese governmental troops. Five thousand of Dong Fuxiang's \"Gansu Braves\" and an unknown number of \"Boxers\" won a costly but major victory over Seymour's troops at the Battle of Langfang on 18 June. As the allied European army retreated from Langfang, they were constantly fired upon by cavalry, and artillery bombarded their positions. It was reported that the Chinese artillery was superior to the European artillery, since the Europeans did not bother to bring along much for the campaign, thinking they could easily sweep through Chinese resistance. The Europeans could not locate the Chinese artillery, which was raining shells upon their positions.Mining, engineering, flooding and simultaneous attacks were employed by Chinese troops. The Chinese also employed pincer movements, ambushes and sniper tactics with some success against the foreigners.Italian mounted infantry near Tientsin in 1900\n\nNews arrived on 18 June regarding attacks on foreign legations. Seymour decided to continue advancing, this time along the Beihe river, toward Tongzhou, 25 kilometres (16 mi) from Beijing. By the 19th, they had to abandon their efforts due to progressively stiffening resistance and started to retreat southward along the river with over 200 wounded. Commandeering four civilian Chinese junks along the river, they loaded all their wounded and remaining supplies onto them and pulled them along with ropes from the riverbanks. By this point they were very low on food, ammunition and medical supplies. Unexpectedly they then happened upon the Great Xigu Arsenal, a hidden Qing munitions cache of which the Allied Powers had had no knowledge until then. They immediately captured and occupied it, discovering not only Krupp field guns, but rifles with millions of rounds of ammunition, along with millions of pounds of rice and ample medical supplies. There they dug in and awaited rescue. A Chinese servant was able to infiltrate through the Boxer and Qing lines, informing the Eight Powers of the Seymour troops' predicament. Surrounded and attacked nearly around the clock by Qing troops and Boxers, they were at the point of being overrun. On 25 June, a regiment composed of 1,800 men (900 Russian troops from Port Arthur, 500 British seamen, with an ad hoc mix of other assorted Alliance troops) finally arrived on foot from Tientsin to rescue Seymour. Spiking the mounted field guns and setting fire to any munitions that they could not take (an estimated £3 million worth), Seymour, his force, and the rescue mission marched back to Tientsin, unopposed, on 26 June. Seymour's casualties during the expedition were 62 killed and 228 wounded. Qing imperial soldiers during the Boxer Rebellion Meanwhile, in Beijing, on 16 June, Empress Dowager Cixi summoned the imperial court for a mass audience and addressed the choices between using the Boxers to evict the foreigners from the city or seeking a diplomatic solution. In response to a high official who doubted the efficacy of the Boxers' magic, Cixi replied: Both sides of the debate at the imperial court realised that popular support for the Boxers in the countryside was almost universal and that suppression would be both difficult and unpopular, especially when foreign troops were on the march. Two factions were active during this debate. On one side were anti-foreigners who viewed foreigners as invasive and imperialistic and evoked a nativist populism. They advocated taking advantage of the Boxers to achieve the expulsion of foreign troops and foreign influences. The pro-foreigners on the other hand advanced rapprochement with foreign governments, seeing the Boxers as superstitious and ignorant. The event that tilted the Qing imperial government irrevocably toward support of the Boxers and war with the foreign powers was the attack of foreign navies on the Dagu Forts near Tianjin, on 17 June 1900. Locations of foreign diplomatic legations and front lines in Beijing during the siege On 15 June, Qing imperial forces deployed electric mines in the River Beihe (Peiho) to prevent the Eight-Nation Alliance from sending ships to attack. With a difficult military situation in Tianjin and a total breakdown of communications between Tianjin and Beijing, the allied nations took steps to reinforce their military presence significantly. On 17 June they took the Dagu Forts commanding the approaches to Tianjin, and from there brought increasing numbers of troops on shore. When Cixi received an ultimatum[when?] demanding that China surrender total control over all its military and financial affairs to foreigners, she defiantly stated before the entire Grand Council, \"Now they [the Powers] have started the aggression, and the extinction of our nation is imminent. If we just fold our arms and yield to them, I would have no face to see our ancestors after death. If we must perish, why not fight to the death?\"It was at this point that Cixi began to blockade the legations with the armies of the Peking Field Force, which began the siege. Cixi stated that \"I have always been of the opinion, that the allied armies had been permitted to escape too easily in 1860. Only a united effort was then necessary to have given China the victory. Today, at last, the opportunity for revenge has come\", and said that millions of Chinese would join the cause of fighting the foreigners since the Manchus had provided \"great benefits\" on China. On receipt of the news of the attack on the Dagu Forts on the 19th of June, Empress Dowager Cixi immediately sent an order to the legations that the diplomats and other foreigners depart Beijing under escort of the Chinese army within 24 hours. The next morning, diplomats from the besieged legations met to discuss the Empress's offer. The majority quickly agreed that they could not trust the Chinese army. Fearing that they would be killed, they agreed to refuse the Empress's demand. The German Imperial Envoy, Baron Klemens Freiherr von Ketteler, was infuriated with the actions of the Chinese army troops and determined to take his complaints to the royal court. Against the advice of the fellow foreigners, the baron left the legations with a single aide and a team of porters to carry his sedan chair. On his way to the palace, von Ketteler was killed on the streets of Beijing by a Manchu captain. His aide managed to escape the attack and carried word of the baron's death back to the diplomatic compound. At this news, the other diplomats feared they also would be murdered if they left the legation quarter and they chose to continue to defy the Chinese order to depart Beijing. The legations were hurriedly fortified. Most of the foreign civilians, which included a large number of missionaries and businessmen, took refuge in the British legation, the largest of the diplomatic compounds. Chinese Christians were primarily housed in the adjacent palace (Fu) of Prince Su who was forced to abandon his property by the foreign soldiers.Representative U.S., Indian, French, Italian, British, German, Austrian and Japanese military and naval personnel forming part of the Allied forces On the 21st of June, Empress Dowager Cixi declared war against all foreign powers. Regional governors who commanded substantial modernised armies, such as Li Hongzhang at Canton, Yuan Shikai in Shandong, Zhang Zhidong at Wuhan and Liu Kunyi at Nanjing, refused to join in the imperial court's declaration of war and withheld knowledge of it from the public in the south. Yuan Shikai used his own forces to suppress Boxers in Shandong, and Zhang entered into negotiations with the foreigners in Shanghai to keep his army out of the conflict. The neutrality of these provincial and regional governors left the majority of Chinese out of the conflict. They were called The Mutual Protection of Southeast China. The legations of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United States, Russia and Japan were located in the Beijing Legation Quarter south of the Forbidden City. The Chinese army and Boxer irregulars besieged the Legation Quarter from 20 June to 14 August 1900. A total of 473 foreign civilians, 409 soldiers, marines and sailors from eight countries, and about 3,000 Chinese Christians took refuge there. Under the command of the British minister to China, Claude Maxwell MacDonald, the legation staff and military guards defended the compound with small arms, three machine guns, and one old muzzle-loaded cannon, which was nicknamed the International Gun because the barrel was British, the carriage Italian, the shells Russian and the crew American. Chinese Christians in the legations led the foreigners to the cannon and it proved important in the defence. Also under siege in Beijing was the Northern Cathedral (Beitang) of the Catholic Church. The Beitang was defended by 43 French and Italian soldiers, 33 Catholic foreign priests and nuns, and about 3,200 Chinese Catholics. The defenders suffered heavy casualties especially from lack of food and mines which the Chinese exploded in tunnels dug beneath the compound. [58]The number of Chinese soldiers and Boxers besieging the Legation Quarter and the Beitang is unknown.1900, soldiers burned down the Temple, Shanhaiguan. The destruction of a Chinese temple on the bank of the Pei-Ho, by Amédée Forestier. On the 22nd and 23 June, Chinese soldiers and Boxers set fire to areas north and west of the British Legation, using it as a \"frightening tactic\" to attack the defenders. The nearby Hanlin Academy, a complex of courtyards and buildings that housed \"the quintessence of Chinese scholarship ... the oldest and richest library in the world\", caught fire. Each side blamed the other for the destruction of the invaluable books it contained. After the failure to burn out the foreigners, the Chinese army adopted an anaconda-like strategy. The Chinese built barricades surrounding the Legation Quarter and advanced, brick by brick, on the foreign lines, forcing the foreign legation guards to retreat a few feet at a time. This tactic was especially used in the Fu, defended by Japanese and Italian sailors and soldiers, and inhabited by most of the Chinese Christians. Fusillades of bullets, artillery and firecrackers were directed against the Legations almost every night—but did little damage. Sniper fire took its toll among the foreign defenders. Despite their numerical advantage, the Chinese did not attempt a direct assault on the Legation Quarter although in the words of one of the besieged, \"it would have been easy by a strong, swift movement on the part of the numerous Chinese troops to have annihilated the whole body of foreigners ... in an hour.\" American missionary Frank Gamewell and his crew of \"fighting parsons\" fortified the Legation Quarter, but impressed Chinese Christians to do most of the physical labour of building defences. The Germans and the Americans occupied perhaps the most crucial of all defensive positions: the Tartar Wall. Holding the top of the 45 ft (14 m) tall and 40 ft (12 m) wide wall was vital. The German barricades faced east on top of the wall and 400 yd (370 m) west were the west-facing American positions. The Chinese advanced toward both positions by building barricades even closer. \"The men all feel they are in a trap\", said the American commander, Capt. John T. Myers, \"and simply await the hour of execution.\"On 30 June, the Chinese forced the Germans off the Wall, leaving the American Marines alone in its defence. At the same time, a Chinese barricade was advanced to within a few feet of the American positions and it became clear that the Americans had to abandon the wall or force the Chinese to retreat. At 2 am on 3 July, 56 British, Russian and American marines and sailors, under the command of Myers, launched an assault against the Chinese barricade on the wall. The attack caught the Chinese sleeping, killed about 20 of them, and expelled the rest of them from the barricades. The Chinese did not attempt to advance their positions on the Tartar Wall for the remainder of the siege. Sir Claude MacDonald said 13 July was the \"most harassing day\" of the siege. The Japanese and Italians in the Fu were driven back to their last defence line. The Chinese detonated a mine beneath the French Legation pushing the French and Austrians out of most of the French Legation.On 16 July, the most capable British officer was killed and the journalist George Ernest Morrison was wounded. But American Minister Edwin Hurd Conger established contact with the Chinese government and on 17 July, an armistice was declared by the Chinese.[68] More than 40% of the legation guards were dead or wounded. The motivation of the Chinese was probably the realization that an allied force of 20,000 men had landed in China and retribution for the siege was at hand. Han Chinese General Nie Shicheng, who fought both the Boxers and the Allies.\n\nThe Manchu General Ronglu concluded that it was futile to fight all of the powers simultaneously, and declined to press home the siege.The Manchu Zaiyi (Prince Duan), an anti-foreign friend of Dong Fuxiang, wanted artillery for Dong's troops to destroy the legations. Ronglu blocked the transfer of artillery to Zaiyi and Dong, preventing them from attacking. Ronglu forced Dong Fuxiang and his troops to pull back from completing the siege and destroying the legations, thereby saving the foreigners and making diplomatic concessions. Ronglu and Prince Qing sent food to the legations, and used their Manchu Bannermen to attack the Muslim Gansu Braves (\"Kansu Braves\" in the spelling of the time) of Dong Fuxiang and the Boxers who were besieging the foreigners. They issued edicts ordering the foreigners to be protected, but the Gansu warriors ignored it, and fought against Bannermen who tried to force them away from the legations. The Boxers also took commands from Dong Fuxiang.Ronglu also deliberately hid an Imperial Decree from General Nie Shicheng. The Decree ordered him to stop fighting the Boxers because of the foreign invasion, and also because the population was suffering. Due to Ronglu's actions, General Nie continued to fight the Boxers and killed many of them even as the foreign troops were making their way into China. Ronglu also ordered Nie to protect foreigners and save the railway from the Boxers. Because parts of the Railway were saved under Ronglu's orders, the foreign invasion army was able to transport itself into China quickly. General Nie committed thousands of troops against the Boxers instead of against the foreigners. Nie was already outnumbered by the Allies by 4,000 men. General Nie was blamed for attacking the Boxers, as Ronglu let Nie take all the blame. At the Battle of Tianjin (Tientsin), General Nie decided to sacrifice his life by walking into the range of Allied guns.\n\nXu Jingcheng, who had served as the Qing Envoy to many of the same states under siege in the Legation Quarter, argued that \"the evasion of extraterritorial rights and the killing of foreign diplomats are unprecedented in China and abroad.\" Xu and five other officials urged Empress Dowager Cixi to order the repression of Boxers, the execution of their leaders, and a diplomatic settlement with foreign armies. The Empress Dowager, outraged, sentenced Xu and the five others to death for \"willfully and absurdly petitioning the Imperial Court\" and \"building subversive thought.\" They were executed on July 28, 1900 and their severed heads placed on display at Caishikou Execution Grounds in Beijing. Han Chinese General Dong Fuxiang was overtly hostile to foreigners and his \"Gansu Braves\" relentlessly attacked the besieged legations. Reflecting this vacillation, some Chinese soldiers were quite liberally firing at foreigners under siege from its very onset. Cixi did not personally order imperial troops to conduct a siege, and on the contrary had ordered them to protect the foreigners in the legations. Prince Duan led the Boxers to loot his enemies within the imperial court and the foreigners, although imperial authorities expelled Boxer troops after they were let into the city and went on a looting rampage against both the foreign and the Qing imperial forces. Older Boxers were sent outside Beijing to halt the approaching foreign armies, while younger men were absorbed into the Muslim Gansu army. With conflicting allegiances and priorities motivating the various forces inside Beijing, the situation in the city became increasingly confused. The foreign legations continued to be surrounded by both Qing imperial and Gansu forces. While Dong Fuxiang's Gansu army, now swollen by the addition of the Boxers, wished to press the siege, Ronglu's imperial forces seem to have largely attempted to follow Empress Dowager Cixi's decree and protect the legations. However, to satisfy the conservatives in the imperial court, Ronglu's men also fired on the legations and let off firecrackers to give the impression that they, too, were attacking the foreigners. Inside the legations and out of communication with the outside world, the foreigners simply fired on any targets that presented themselves, including messengers from the imperial court, civilians and besiegers of all persuasions. Dong Fuxiang was denied artillery held by Ronglu which stopped him from leveling the legations, and when he complained to Empress Dowager Cixi on June 23, she dismissively said that \"Your tail, is becoming too heavy to wag.\" The Alliance discovered large amounts of unused Chinese Krupp artillery and shells after the siege was lifted.\n\nThe armistice, although occasionally broken, endured until 13 August when, with an allied army led by the British Alfred Gaselee approaching Beijing to relieve the siege, the Chinese launched their heaviest fusillade on the Legation Quarter. As the foreign army approached, Chinese forces melted away. The Boxers bombarded Tianjin in June 1900, and Dong Fuxiang's Muslim troops attacked the British Admiral Seymour and his expeditionary force.\n\nForeign navies started building up their presence along the northern China coast from the end of April 1900. Several international forces were sent to the capital, with varying success, and the Chinese forces were ultimately defeated by the Eight-Nation Alliance of Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Independent of the alliance, the Netherlands dispatched three cruisers in July to protect its citizens in Shanghai. British Lieutenant-General Alfred Gaselee acted as the commanding officer of the Eight-Nation Alliance, which eventually numbered 55,000. The main contingent was composed of Japanese (20,840), Russian (13,150), British (12,020), French (3,520), U.S. (3,420), German (900), Italian, Austro-Hungarian and anti-Boxer Chinese troops.[83] The \"First Chinese Regiment\" (Weihaiwei Regiment) which was praised for its performance, consisted of Chinese collaborators serving in the British military.The international force finally captured Tianjin on 14 July under the command of the Japanese Colonel Kuriya, after a day of fighting. A Group Photograph at Quetta, Baluchistan (Chief Commissioner's Province), British India of some of the Officers of the 26th Baluchistan Regiment of Bombay Infantry of British India – before leaving India to go to China in 1900 to suppress the Boxer Rebellion (1899–1901).\n\nNotable events included the seizure of the Dagu Forts commanding the approaches to Tianjin and the boarding and capture of four Chinese destroyers by British Commander Roger Keyes. Among the foreigners besieged in Tianjin was a young American mining engineer named Herbert Hoover, who would go on to become the 31st President of the United States.[85][86]\n\nThe march from Tianjin to Beijing of about 120 km included about 20,000 allied troops. On 4 August, there were approximately 70,000 Qing imperial troops and anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 Boxers along the way. The allies only encountered minor resistance, fighting battles at Beicang and Yangcun. At Yangcun, the 14th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. and British troops led the assault. The weather was a major obstacle. Conditions were extremely humid with temperatures sometimes reaching 42 °C (108 °F). These high temperatures and insects plagued the Allies. Soldiers dehydrated and horses died. Chinese villagers killed Allied troops who searched for wells.\n\nThe heat killed Allied soldiers, who foamed at the mouth. The tactics along the way were gruesome on either side. Allied soldiers beheaded already dead Chinese corpses, bayoneted or beheaded live Chinese civilians, and raped Chinese girls and women.[88] Cossacks were reported to have killed Chinese civilians almost automatically and Japanese kicked a Chinese soldier to death.[89] The Chinese responded to the Alliance's atrocities with similar acts of violence and cruelty, especially towards captured Russians.[88] Lieutenant Smedley Butler saw the remains of two Japanese soldiers nailed to a wall, who had their tongues cut off and their eyes gouged.[90] Lieutenant Butler was wounded during the expedition in the leg and chest, later receiving the Brevet Medal in recognition for his actions.\n\nChinese troops wearing modern uniforms in 1900\n\nThe international force reached Beijing on 14 August. Following the defeat of Beiyang army in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese government had invested heavily in modernizing the imperial army, which was equipped with modern Mauser repeater rifles and Krupp artillery. Three modernized divisions consisting of Manchu Bannermen protected the Beijing Metropolitan region. Two of them were under the command of the anti-Boxer Prince Qing and Ronglu, while the anti-foreign Prince Duan commanded the ten-thousand-strong Hushenying, or \"Tiger Spirit Division\", which had joined the Gansu Braves and Boxers in attacking the foreigners. It was a Hushenying captain who had assassinated the German diplomat Ketteler. The Tenacious Army under Nie Shicheng received western style training under German and Russian officers in addition to their modernised weapons and uniforms. They effectively resisted the Alliance at the Battle of Tientsin before retreating and astounded the Alliance forces with the accuracy of their artillery during the siege of the Tianjin concessions (the artillery shells failed to explode upon impact due to corrupt manufacturing). The Gansu Braves under Dong Fuxiang, which some sources described as \"ill disciplined\", were armed with modern weapons but were not trained according to western drill and wore traditional Chinese uniforms. They led the defeat of the Alliance at Langfang in the Seymour Expedition and were the most ferocious in besieging the Legations in Beijing. Some Banner forces were given modernised weapons and western training, becoming the Metropolitan Banner forces, which were decimated in the fighting. Among the Manchu dead was the father of the writer Lao She.[citation needed]\n\nCorporal Titus scaling the walls of Peking\n\nThe British won the race among the international forces to be the first to reach the besieged Legation Quarter. The U.S. was able to play a role due to the presence of U.S. ships and troops stationed in Manila since the U.S. conquest of the Philippines during the Spanish–American War and the subsequent Philippine Insurrection. In the U.S. military, the action in the Boxer Rebellion was known as the China Relief Expedition. United States Marines scaling the walls of Beijing is an iconic image of the Boxer Rebellion.\n\nThe British Army reached the legation quarter on the afternoon of 14 August and relieved the Legation Quarter. The Beitang was relieved on 16 August, first by Japanese soldiers and then, officially, by the French.\n\nMassacres by the Westerners: After the liberation of legations, the military, settlers, blinded by the presence of mutilated bodies, impaled bodies, heads placed in pyramids, and countless Christian Chinese corpses defiling the water wells, and in a state of decomposition in the ditches, commit the worst atrocities. They kill the people accused of being Boxers by the thousands, loot, rape, and be photographed on the imperial throne.\n\nIn the early hours of 15 August, just as the Foreign Legations were being relieved, Empress Dowager Cixi, dressed in the padded blue cotton of a farm woman, the Guangxu Emperor, and a small retinue climbed into three wooden ox carts and escaped from the city covered with rough blankets. Legend has it that the Empress Dowager then either ordered that the Guangxu Emperor's favourite concubine, Consort Zhen, be thrown down a well in the Forbidden City or tricked her into drowning herself. The journey was made all the more arduous by the lack of preparation, but the Empress Dowager insisted this was not a retreat, rather a \"tour of inspection.\" After weeks of travel, the party arrived in Xi'an in Shaanxi province, beyond protective mountain passes where the foreigners could not reach, deep in Chinese Muslim territory and protected by the Gansu Braves. The foreigners had no orders to pursue the Empress Dowager, so they decided to stay put.\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion\n\nScroll down!\n\nMontblanc Friedrich II the Great Fountain Pen - Limited Edition 4810 (1999):\n\nFirst in a series of YouTube videos re: Frederick The Great Documentary - Biography of the life of Frederick The Great. youtu.be/vGLsE1wq3fg\n\nFor excellent pen photos please see Peyton Street Pens, Santa Cruz, CA, USA.\n\nwww.peytonstreetpens.com/montblanc-friedrich-ii-the-great...\n\nI received permission from Teri to post the photos that they took of this nice pen that I am currently unable to afford.

It does not surprise any of us that Margret chose to leave us on this day where women around the world are celebrating International Women's Day. Margaret is predeceased by her husband, Claude Mitchell, her two brothers Bill and Ted Learoyd and sister, Betty Speers. Margaret grew up in Cayuga, Ontario. She graduated with a BA from McMaster University and M.S.W from University of Toronto. Margaret served Canada overseas through the Canadian Red cross in Korea, Japan, Australia and Austria. Her work with the Settlement House in Toronto and the Neighbourhood Association in Vancouver established her as a pioneer in community development, a social work practice which persists in putting power in the hands of communities to make decisions affecting their lives. Prior to entering politics, she served as a Manager with the Vancouver Resources Board which integrated social services and decentralized service delivery and decision making. Margaret served in the House of Commons as an MP for Vancouver East from 1979 to 1993. She voted against a pay raise during this time and donated the additional pay to the Vancity Community Foundation which established the Margaret Mitchell Fund for Women. Margaret was, at her core, an advocate for women. In 1982, she stood up in Parliament to demand government action to stop domestic violence. When male members of Parliament responded by laughing as she addressed the issue, she furiously replied: 'This is no laughing matter, Madam Speaker.' Thousands of Canadians agreed, calling for immediate action to end violence against women and inspiring activism and services for women across the country. Many years later, she published an autobiography titled 'No Laughing Matter.' Margaret was the NDP critic in the House of Commons for Immigration, Housing, Status of Women, Health and Welfare, Multiculturalism and Citizenship. She was the first MP to have raised the issue of Chinese head tax in the House of Commons. Margaret pressed the government to decriminalize abortion, worked with First Nations Women for the reinstatement of status under the Indian Act and supported a national childcare programme. Margaret is the recipient of many honours and recognitions, including the Order of British Columbia and Freedom to the City, from the City of Vancouver. Margaret leaves behind several nieces and nephews and their families, many close friends and colleagues. With a wonderful depth of humour, integrity and passion, Margaret contributed profoundly to Canada and to the world by promoting equal rights, justice. This is her legacy, a legacy that will continue to empower and inspire all of us who admired, loved and respected her. A celebration of her life will be held at a later date. Special thanks to Care At Home Services for their professional care at home which made it possible for Margaret to stay at her own home right until the end. For anyone wishing to donate, she would ask you to continue her work on behalf of low income and racialized women in East Vancouver by contributing to the Margaret Mitchell Fund for Women held at the Vancity Community Foundation.\n\nDina Vierny, France:\n\nDescription: Dina Vierny was an artists' model who became a singer, French art dealer, collector and museum director.

After several changes of location it is now housed in a permanent building in the Kreuzberg neighbourhood.\n\nMoessinger had recently become a nursewhen she came into an 800,000 markinheritance from her father; it was this bequest that she used to start the Tempodrom in a circus tent.[2] Her initial funds were quickly exhausted and the following year the Berlin Senate agreed to contribute funds to keep the operation going.\n\nThe original location attracted noise complaints, and in 1985 the Tempodrom moved to a site in the Tiergarten, where it remained until displaced by construction of the new German Chancellery. At this time a new construction of the current building was proposed, and the tents moved to a temporary site during construction. In May 1999, the venue moved to another temporary location near the Ostbahnhof.\n\nIn 2001, a permanent venue was finally constructed on the site of the old Anhalter Bahnhof, whose war-damaged ruins had been demolished in 1960. While a small section of the old station façade was retained (and is still standing), the entire train shed was removed, leaving a large open area. The new Tempodrom was erected in the center of this area, with a playing field lying between it and the façade remnant, and a wooded area extending in the other direction towards the Landwehr Canal. The firm of Von Garkan, Marg und Partner (GMP) was retained to design the new building. The basic floor plan is square, accommodating three performance spaces as well as a bistro and various offices and restrooms, underneath a wooden-floored terrace which hosts a beer garden in season.[3] The two arenas are both circular, with the larger, centrally located space covered by a 37 metres (121 ft) steel and concrete panel roof intended to echo the form of the tents of the original site. This space can accommodate 3,500 patrons; the smaller arena seats 400. The third space is the \"Liquidrom\", a thermal bath/spa establishment featuring a 43 feet (13 m) diameter salt water bath fitted with underwater speakers to provide a multi-sensory spa experience, three saunas at temperatures of 55, 80 and 90 degrees Celsius, a steam bath room along with various massage services.[4] The 135,000 square foot (12,500 m2) building was completed in 2001 at a cost of nearly $36 million, over twice the original budget.[5]Scandal over the overruns led to the resignation of State Senator Peter Strieder [de], who was in charge of the Urban Development department.\n\nThe Tempodrom corporation went into bankruptcy in 2005 and was operated by a receiver, with Moessinger retiring as director. She and former Director Norbert Waehl were tried for embezzlement but were acquitted in 2008.[6] The Tempodrom is now operated by the Bremer KPS Group, who took over in April 2010 in the face of a foreclosure threat by Landesbank Berlin.\n\nTempodrom continues in operation and hosts a wide variety of events.\n\nNotable performers:\n\nAlanis Morissette\n\nAmy Macdonald\n\nBackstreet Boys\n\nBastille\n\nBjörk\n\nCeltic Woman\n\nThe Cure\n\nHarry Styles\n\nIggy Pop\n\nJames Taylor\n\nJamie-Lee\n\nJanet Jackson\n\nJoan Baez\n\nJosh Groban\n\nKeane\n\nKylie Minogue\n\nLorde\n\nThe Lumineers\n\nMatt White\n\nMonsta X\n\nNiall Horan\n\nNick Cave and the Bad Seeds\n\nNicki Minaj\n\nNorah Jones\n\nOlly Murs\n\nPet Shop Boys\n\nRamones\n\nRoger Hodgson\n\nSade\n\nSeverina\n\nSnow Patrol\n\nTake That\n\nTangerine Dream\n\nTears for Fears\n\nTori Amos\n\nTroye Sivan\n\nVanessa Mai\n\nVasco Rossi\n\nZara Larsson\n\nNotable events:\n\nGerman Masters, snooker tournament.\n\nJean M. Wong, Hong Kong:\n\nJean Wong - Ballet school principal\n\nWithin minutes of meeting Jean Wong at the Sha Tin studio of her ballet school, her love for her art and her students is palpable. Sitting ruler-straight on a chair, she nods approvingly at star pupil Lam Chun-wing and offers him valuable nuggets of advice about make-up and posture.\n\nWong, who founded the Jean M Wong School of Ballet 51 years ago, credits her mother with helping her find her calling as a ballerina and teacher. 'My mother had a very sharp eye for beauty, and I think that greatly influenced my life. She would take me to see Chinese operas and old Hollywood movies, which definitely made an imprint on my mind,' says Wong, who is from Shanghai.\n\nHer first artistic encounter was music when she learned to play the piano. She also learned to paint. Ballet came later and it was like love at first sight. 'My hobby and pleasure in life is ballet. Looking back, ballet combines all the arts - painting because of the sceneries, music and drama,' says Wong, who went to London to study at the teacher-training college of the Royal Academy of Dance in 1956. She returned brimming with ballet theories and was determined to put into practice what she had mastered. In 1960, and 'not knowing that I needed to pay rent, I just started my own school', Wong says. 'But I think I had so much passion that word soon spread and I had more students, including children from famous families.'\n\nWong says promoting the tradition of ballet in Hong Kong remains a challenge to this day. She says: 'You have to communicate with the children and the parents. Ballet doesn't have a long history in Hong Kong, so you don't expect [them] to understand its tradition.' Wong encourages her students and their families to buy ballet DVDs and to see ballet performances so that they can appreciate the art form.Of all things taught to her students, Wong considers discipline the most important.'You can't become anybody of importance without self-control, especially for a dancer,' she says. 'Everything in ballet has to be perfect. A desire to reach perfection is important for ballerinas.'\n\nWong says she inherited discipline from her father, a banker who was strict but generous. 'He helped a lot of people who were in difficulties. I think that was one of the reasons I started the Tsinforn C Wong Memorial Scholarship.' Established in 1973 as the Tsinforn C Wong Scholarship, it was renamed the Tsinforn C. Wong Memorial Scholarship in 1983 in remembrance of Wong's late father. Wong attributes her achievements to her 'sheer dedication and absolute commitment'. 'I'll never say 'that's enough',' says Wong, adding that she doesn't want to retire because for her retiring means moving backwards. 'I hate to think that I'm going backwards. I've always wanted to go forward. That's my motto.'\n\nFernando Giulini, Italy: (minimal on line)\n\nProfessionista nel settore Ricerca\n\nFCG CONSULTING Srl\n\nMilano, Italia.\n\nTatsuya Nakadai, Japan:\n\nTatsuya Nakadai is a Japanese film actor famous for the wide variety of characters he has portrayed and many collaborations with famous Japanese film directors. Wikipedia\n\nBorn: December 13, 1932 (age 87 years), Gohongi, Tokyo, Japan\n\nHeight: 1.78 m.\n\nSpouse: Yasuko Miyazaki (m. 1957–1996).\n\nChildren: Nao Nakadai.\n\nSiblings: Keigo Nakadai.\n\nTatsuya Nakadai (仲代 達矢, Nakadai Tatsuya, born Motohisa Nakadai; December 13, 1932) is a Japanese film actor famous for the wide variety of characters he has portrayed and many collaborations with famous Japanese film directors.[1]\n\nBorn: Motohisa Nakadai (仲代 元久)\n\nDecember 13, 1932(age 87). Tokyo, Japan\n\nOccupation: Actor.\n\nYears active: 1954–present\n\nHeight:: 1.78 m (5 ft 10 in)\n\nHe was featured in 11 films directed by Masaki Kobayashi, including The Human Condition trilogy, wherein he starred as the lead character Kaji, plus Harakiri, Samurai Rebellion and Kwaidan.\n\nNakadai worked with a number of Japan's best-known filmmakers—starring or co-starring in five films directed by Akira Kurosawa, as well as being cast in significant films directed by Hiroshi Teshigahara (The Face of Another), Mikio Naruse (When a Woman Ascends the Stairs), Kihachi Okamoto (Kill! and The Sword of Doom), Hideo Gosha (Goyokin), Shirō Toyoda(Portrait of Hell) and Kon Ichikawa (Enjō and Odd Obsession).\n\nBiography:\n\nNakadai grew up in a very poor family and was unable to afford a university education, prompting him to take up acting. He greatly admired American films and was a fan of actors such as John Wayne and Marlon Brando. He also picked up a liking of Broadway musicals, and travels once a year to New York City to watch them. Nakadai was working as a shop clerk in Tokyo before a chance encounter with director Masaki Kobayashi led to him being cast in the film The Thick Walled Room. The following year, he made a brief and uncredited cameo in Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai where he is seen for a few seconds as a samurai walking through town.[2] Nakadai's role in Seven Samurai is technically his debut as The Thick-Walled Room's release was delayed for three years due to controversial subject matter. His major breakthrough as an actor came when he was given the part of Jo, a young yakuza in Black River, another film directed by Kobayashi. Nakadai continued to work with Kobayashi into the 1960s and won his first Blue Ribbon Award for his role in Harakiri (his personal favorite among his own films) as the aging rōnin Hanshiro Tsugumo.\n\nNakadai appeared in two more Kurosawa films from the 1980s.
