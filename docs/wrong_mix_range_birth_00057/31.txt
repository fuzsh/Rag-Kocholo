This exhibition, curated by Alice Porembski and Sue Lang explores the background and works of this internationally-famous Redding woodworker who pioneered and perfected segmented turnings. An interned Japanese American during WWII, San Francisco-born Yosh Sugiyama moved to Redding in 1961 to direct the Shasta County Health Department laboratory. He retired in 1983 to focus on his lifelong passion for woodworking. His works can be found all over the north state and in collections worldwide.
