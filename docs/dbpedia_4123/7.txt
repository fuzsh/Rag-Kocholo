We are very pleased to share that Oldenburg Academy of the Immaculate Conception in Oldenburg, Indiana, selected Convicted: An Innocent Man, the Cop Who Framed Him, and an Unlikely Journey of Forgiveness and Friendship by Jameel Zookie McGee and Andrew Collins with Mark Tabb for the student body to read over the summer.

English Teacher and Student Learning Specialist Mary Gehring shared her thoughts about the program, which culminated in a visit by co-author Andrew Collins:

Over the summer, OA students read the book Convicted by Andrew Collins and Jameel McGee in connection with the Franciscan value of reconciliation, the value of study this year. Collins spoke at an all-school convocation, where he discussed his incredible story and how reconciliation played a role in his life, including bringing him closer to a man he wrongfully put behind bars, who is the co-author of this book. Collins also spoke about what it was like to write the book with Jameel and an editor. Students appreciated that he was open but not awkward and that he spoke to them as teenagers. They also were amazed at the level and kind of forgiveness the authors showed each other.
