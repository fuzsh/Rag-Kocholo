        "text": "How We Are Getting Through This Pandemic…\n\nBy: S. Olga Wittekind, OSF\n\nThe Sisters of St. Francis have been reaching out to others during this COVID-19 Pandemic. COVID-19 has affected the lives of each of us in many ways. Some of these impacts are direct. Many in Franklin and Ripley Counties struggle to maintain their households.\n\nWe advocated for paid sick days and the expansion of unemployment insurance so that people do not have to choose between going to work sick and paying their rent/mortgage or feeding their families. We advocated for a national moratorium on foreclosures and evictions. We also advocated for more testing and PPE for health workers for their safety and the safety of our communities. Every day we pray for each of us in our counties, the state of Indiana, the United States, and the entire world community.\n\nIn the convent we are taking safety precautions. One significant change the Sisters have made is in their meal protocol. We have changed the way meals are served—Sisters are served their food and they no longer serve themselves, eliminating serving utensils being passed from person to person. When lining up for meals they also distance themselves. The Sisters sit only two at a table, which has led to more knowledge of each other through the sharing and conversations.\n\nThe Activity Director, Mary Ellen Rinklin, has planned engaging activities. Since we are not able to gather in groups we are doing our activities from the Community Room and showing it over our closed circuit TV system. Our Stretch and Movement program has been a great success! Instead of groups of approximately 8 sisters we broadcast the program every day at 10:00 am to the Sisters’ TV. The silver lining to this is instead of participating in an exercise class once or twice a week the Sisters can tune in every morning Monday-Friday!\n\n​We normally show a movie every Friday afternoon but we have added 3 more hand-picked, uplifting movies a week to our schedule hoping to brighten Sisters’ spirits. S. Bernice Stenger and S. Olga Wittekind present “Tips for Well Being” each week presenting on spiritual renewal and how to keep healthy in mind, body, and soul. These programs help to release anxiety during this difficult time.\n\nSince the Sisters are not able to gather in groups, Mary Ellen has come up with some other activities. She has been “interviewing” two Sisters a week, one-on-one in an Oprah-type format. The objective is for the Sisters to tell their story and allow others to learn something new about their childhood, call to religious life, and growth in their ministries.\n\nSome of the Sisters ministering in their place of employment are actually still ON the front lines! One Sister goes to work most days at a Retirement Center in Cincinnati. She reports, “We are all VERY CAREFUL – we’ve worn masks for weeks, and now the residents do as well. For direct contact we also wear gloves. And washing hands NUMEROUS times a day is just ordinary for us. We keep our social distance, when interacting, and at meals.”\n\n​There have been blessings during these weeks. The Sisters have more time for personal prayer and contemplation and praying for all the sick and dying in our world. Puzzles have been made with butterflies—symbol of new life—as a remembrance of the coronavirus sequestered time. Each of you continue to be held in our prayers!\n\nWhole-souled\n\nBy: S. Barb Leonhard\n\n169 years ago today, Mother Theresa Hackelmeier arrived in Oldenburg, and our Community was founded. It seems that 169 years is not so long ago in the greater scheme of things. But when I put this date into a historical setting,\n\nI realized that in 1851 there were only 31 States in the Union. The CA gold rush was drawing people to the West; Isaac Singer invented the sewing machine; and Sojourner Truth gave her famous speech, “Ain’t I a woman?” at the Women’s Rights Convention in Akron, OH. Mother Theresa was indeed coming into a country where many changes were happening, and she would become part of those changes.\n\nWhen I try to imagine her journey to Oldenburg, her first days here and the challenges she faced, one thing that comes to mind is the absence of elders. At 24, she begins life in a new culture, with three young women looking to her to help them learn about religious life. She had no older women religious to whom she could turn for wisdom, advice, or comfort. Of course, she had Fr. Rudolph’s guidance, but when it came to discerning the shape of religious life for women in this new place, she must have longed for conversation with more experienced Sisters. Surely some of the patterns of life in her European community did not fit well here, and she would have to discover new ways.\n\n​One line in particular from today’s first reading seems to speak to Mother Theresa’s new beginning: “The way we know that Jesus remains in us is from the Spirit whom he gave us.”\n\nMother Theresa must have had moments of confusion and doubt about her new life here. Her confidence in the Spirit of God within her must have been tried again and again. We know precious little about her, but her decisions indicate that she was a woman of great trust. One of those decisions was to create a lifestyle grounded in prayer. Even in the busyness of that first year, when they were learning about religious life, starting gardens, and being trained to teach, she made sure that each Sister had an hour of adoration before the Blessed Sacrament each day. As I was re-reading the first chapters of the Poverello, I found myself pausing over S. Laverne’s choice of words.\n\nShe described Mother Theresa as giving “whole-souled” service to her new Community. “Whole-souled” implies that she held nothing back. The one thing that would have supported her in this full and generous life was her own prayer, her opening herself daily to receive of the abundance of God’s love and energy. How else could she have ever realized what the Spirit within her urged her to become? How else could those first companions have found within themselves the desire and grace to join her in this life? She modeled for them and for us what it was to trust the work of the Spirit.\n\nWe know that Mother Theresa arrived in Oldenburg on the feast of the Epiphany, and we frequently refer to the imagery of following the star. Today’s gospel takes us one step beyond that. As Jesus begins his public ministry, Mt is quick to tell us that it is in fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophecy: “The people who sit in darkness have seen a great light.” Mt is highlighting the fact that through his own times of intense prayer, Jesus realizes that he is called to be the light. Later in this same gospel Jesus tells his disciples, “You are the light of the world…. Let your light shine.”\n\nIt is prayer that helps us believe that those words are also for us. We are called to be light for the world –- lights of hope and of compassion; lights of tenderness and healing attention to the needs of others; lights of mercy and of generosity. Although it is a dangerous thing to suggest what someone else might say to us, I am going to do just that. I think that in her own way, Mother Theresa would say to us at this point in our history:\n\n“You are part of a long line of faithful women. Each one of them had her gifts and her hesitations, her doubts and her breakthroughs into deeper faith.\n\nTrust the light of the Spirit within you. Be the light for others. Take the time to immerse yourselves in prayer — so that you are more able to believe that the divine source of this light will never fade.\n\nHelp each other to recognize and trust in the Spirit within when it becomes difficult to feel it. You are not alone. You are always led and enlivened by the light of the Spirit. ”\n\nA Holiday Vision of Oldenburg circa 1951\n\nBy: Joe Adams\n\nEvery once in a while we uncover a gem in the archives department. Here is one of them describing the town of Oldenburg, IN in 1951. Although Oldenburg has moved into the 21st century the exterior of the town and convent look much the same today. We thought you might enjoy this article from a newspaper in the fifties by Joe Adams.\n\nWith a simple flip of the wheel you leave Road 46 and virtually the world and all its clamor and cares. For in one magic moment you are on a winding road, rolling through snow-mantled, serene and silent hills that stand as eternal sentinels above the story-book town of Oldenburg.\n\nThe throb of your motor, hitherto lost in the roar of traffic on the main road, now offends the brooding silences of the peaceful countryside. A redbird flutters away in alarm, its scarlet cloak flashing against the patches of snow on the hillsides. You drive along in the eerie hush of twilight and you wonder if this planet, whereon men – good and evil – struggle for survival, has suddenly and unaccountably stood still.\n\nThen as you make a final turn, you look down into a snug, little valley and behold the “village of spires.” The waning light of a relentlessly bitter December illumines the gilded spires of the churches, the convent of the Immaculate Conception and the Franciscan monastery. And the bells of Oldenburg, which seem always to be ringing, are now pealing forth a special message, and the words come spontaneously to the cadence of the chimes:\n\nRing out the old! Ring in the new!\n\nFor this is in truth a time for decision –\n\nTime to be earnest and honest and true\n\nAs the world’s way of life cries aloud for revision!\n\nRing in the new! And let the bells sing\n\nOf faith and of hope and of regeneration!\n\nHail to the new! And, oh, may it bring\n\nTo a fear-darkened world the light of salvation!\n\nAs you enter a community whose antiquity of 113 years is written in the fading bricks of many homes and institutions the bells, ancient and modern, fairly drench the place with melody. The triumphant tones gladden the heart and shut off the clamor and contentions of these troubled times from this Shrangri-La of the Old World simplicity.\n\nInevitably you come upon a walled-in brick building on the front of which is chiseled the legend: “Sisters of St. Francis. Immaculate Conception Convent. Founded 1851.” Now it is 1951 and though the world beyond might be in turmoil you find within these walls, as it has been down the hallowed years, peace unutterable. In the words of Sister Paschal, teacher, editor and librarian: “The convent is truly a happy place. For whoever has found God has found peace.”\n\nEspecially has it been happy since, on Christmas eve, the Sisters decorated the chapel, the dining hall and corridors and launched the yuletide program of services, carols and other events. And always some of the Sisters have kept vigil – as it is kept the clock around – in the beautiful Adoration Chapel. And you can be sure that on this night their supplications will be for world peace.\n\nAt this season of the year there is even a little gaiety at the convent, beginning with the Christmas tree ceremonies at which each Sister receives a small gift. And on Christmas Day and New Year’s Day, as on all great feasts, the rule of silence is relaxed. But there is a full liturgical program with masses, Vespers and Compline, Matins and Lauds, the rosary and benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. And during this period there are visits to the crib in chapel where some of the Nativity figures were fashioned by one of the Sisters, long since deceased.\n\nYou find no ornate Neon signs flashing on New Year’s eve here in Oldenburg and you hear no blaring horns as in the big cities, even though there were occasions in earlier days when the exuberance of the German settlers was fully expressed.\n\nNotably there was the spectacular demonstration which marked the completion of the new brick steeple on the church. On the afternoon of July 4, 1892, villagers heard some eerie yodeling which seemed to be floating down from the heavens. Looking up, they saw one of the workmen standing on the right arm of the church cross, 187 feet above the ground, dancing a jig and yodeling.\n\nThere are two taverns in the little town now but you would scarcely know they were in operation. One even proclaims, through the lettering on the ancient stone above the portals, that it is a saloon.\n\nDown the same street you come upon a sturdy stone building above the entrance of which is a slab bearing the date, 1845, and a crude carving of a sickle moon and a blazing sun. It probably is symbolic of something much more lofty but a facetious interpretation is that the moon represents a tired, thirsty traveler just arriving and the blazing sun stands for the same traveler as he departed, “all lit up.”\n\nBut on this New Year’s eve there is little hilarity in Oldenburg. You hear only the ever-vocal bells sending a message of peace and hope deep into the old and understanding hills.\n\n​Joe Adams\n\nBeing a Peace-Presence\n\nBy: S. Christa Franzer\n\nThe Sisters and Associates of St. Francis, Oldenburg, celebrate the Feast of St. Francis of Assisi on October 4th. This is a time of great celebration, but also one of reflection on our mission as peace-makers with all people and all creation. The following is a letter from our Congregational Minister, S. Christ Franzer, with words of peace and challenge to all. She begins the letter with “Peace and all good!”\n\nPax et bonum!\n\n​Thomas of Celano writes of this saint whose feast we celebrate today: “Francis went around the cities and villages, proclaiming the kingdom of God and preaching peace. . .” At that time, it surely seemed a new light had been sent from heaven to earth driving away the darkness that had so nearly covered the whole region that hardly anyone knew where to turn. He gleamed like a shining star in the darkness of night and like the morning spread over the darkness.”\n\nRecently I was re-reading a letter from the International Franciscan Conference. While they spoke of the year 2018, it seems that letter is equally true today:\n\n“In our time, in this year 2019, we too feel enveloped in a darkness\n\nthat daily sunshine does not dispel. Darkness in our society and in\n\nour church, insidiously pervading our lives and penetrating the lives\n\nof those we love and to whom we minister, often in crisis proportion.\n\nWe yearn for light, yet know we must become LIGHT to dispel the\n\ndarkness, a new light in our time as Francis was in his. We are called\n\nto see and to listen, called to be faithful and creative in our response\n\nof being a peace-presence within the turmoil. On this feast of Francis. . .\n\nlet us see how we can be a new light. Let us be heralds of peace, bringing\n\nour desire for peace to reality every day. . .”\n\n​\n\n“Being a peace-presence. . .” Can that be said of you? Of me? Are our words calming, rather than stirring up anxiety or fear? Do we affirm one another, rather than criticizing? “We are called to be creative in our response of being a peace-presence within the turmoil.” How are you responding to your call?\n\nMay we each bring peace and light into the dark corners of our world!\n\n​Feast Day blessings,\n\nS. Christa\n\nfor the General Council\n\nA New Ministry at the Motherhouse\n\nBy: Mary Ellen Rinklin\n\nA new ministry has emerged for the Sisters at the Motherhouse in Oldenburg, IN with the help of the Associates. Following you will find out the how, when and where of this new project. It started as a way to recycle plastic bags keeping them out of landfills and our environment and help the most venerable of our society by providing them warm and waterproof insulated sleeping mats.\n\nChris Knabe first learned of crocheting mats for the homeless from a nursing home in Sidney, OH where her mom-in-law was a resident. She thought it was a worthwhile project and took the idea to her parish, but due to other outreach programs it was never initiated. By what could only be God’s nudging and guidance of events, Chris was put in contact with a journalist from a community newspaper which published an article about the mats and amazingly her group was born.\n\nAn Associate of the sisters, Sue Friedmann, and a friend who works with Chris on the mat project thought the sisters in Oldenburg may like to be part of this program too so the project was pitched to the sisters in February of this year. Sue purchased the correct size crochet needles for the sisters and as the word spread plastic bags came pouring in by the car load! Initially there was a large response to help make the mats but tedious folding and cutting of the plastic bags and looping it into the “plarn “, (plastic yarn) proved to be very hard on aged hands so the group now consists of fewer sisters. They are: S. Jean Michael Sauntry, S. Pat Zartman, S. Janice Scheidler, S. Mary Louise Werner, S. Janet Born, S. Dianne Kaimann and S. Therese Wente. Also helping produce the mats are Evy Kuntz and Kim Garvey, friends of the sisters, who help teach religious special education.\n\nCrocheting the mats is a large commitment with each one taking anywhere from 65-70 hours or more to complete. So far the Oldenburg group has completed 7 mats with at least 4 more soon to be finished. The mats are distributed personally by two men from DCI Outreach in Cincinnati who walk the homeless camps handing them out. Recently there were several news stories concerning the homeless in downtown Cincinnati and several of these type mats were seen peeking out of tents and laying on chairs giving assurance that the work the sisters are doing is much needed and utilized.\n\nIf anyone would like to learn more about working on this project they can contact Chris Knabe at 513-777-0463.\n\nNavajo Mission of St. Mary’s Receives Mural\n\nBy: Chriss Murphy\n\nChriss Murphy, of Trinity Artistic Creations Expressions, created this mural in celebration of St. Mary Mission’s 100th Anniversary in 2020 where S. Pat Bietsch and S. Marlene Kochert minister in New Mexico. In Chriss’ own words she describes why she created the mural. “Here is the finished mural that I’ve been blessed to create at St. Mary Mission in Tohatchi, NM on the Navajo reservation. It has been an artistic, personal and spiritual journey for me over the past three summers. I dedicate it to God for blessing me with talent and a desire to be adventurous, and to my husband and faith partner, Glen, who cooperated with me while I was away for up to two months at a time over the past three summers, and who willingly financed the whole project. This project was a total volunteer endeavor of our time, talent and treasure and a gift given to St. Mary Mission to celebrate their 100th anniversary, the Navajo members of the parish and all Navajo people. Thank you to the Friars, Sisters and the beautiful Navajo people for their trust, encouragement and friendship while I did what was asked of me. You are my friends for life!”\n\nThis is a history and explanation of the mural. For over 100 years the Dine Bi Eineeshodi, the Navajo name given to the Franciscan Fathers, have been the bearers of the Good News to the Navajo people. This mural was inspired by my love and respect for my faith, the Navajo people, the Franciscan Fathers, Sister and Brothers who have devoted their vocations in service to the Catholic Navajo people through the three parishes that make up St. Mary Mission. It began with St. Mary Church in Tohatchi (the white clapboard building), followed by St. Anthony Church in Naschetti (the stone building) and with the newest church St. Joseph Church (the Quonset hut) in Coyote Canyon.\n\nOver 100 years ago the Franciscan Friars brought Christianity from St. Michael’s Mission in Window Rock, AZ when Father Berard Haile, at the bequest of the tribal leaders, traveled by horseback to the town of Tohatchi (in Navajo, “scratching for water”). In partnership with Navajo spiritual traditions, he established a devote community of faithful Roman Catholic believers that was dedicated on June 9, 1920.\n\nThe Navajo people and the church share the practice of , WOSHDII, the Navajo word for “ All Are Welcome”, as well as sharing a devotion to the Blessed Mother of Guadalupe and honoring St. Kateri Tekakwitha, the first Native American saint. All the colors in the main mural and the panels were inspired by the Navajo pottery, Navajo rug designs, the New Mexican turquoise blue sky and the surrounding Chuska Mountains.\n\nLooking toward the future of the growth of the mission on the Navajo reservation, we pray four times facing each sacred mountain direction, HOZHOO NAHASDLII , ‘when everything you are is in balance as the Creator intended for you”.\n\n​I am filled with heartfelt gratitude to the Navajo people, the Fathers, Brothers and Sisters of St Mary Mission, for the honor to express my interpretation of the 100 year history of the mission. This has been a journey of faith and growth in the gifts God has given me. I am so grateful for the lifetime friends I have made along the way and pray that God, our Father and Creator, continues to bless all the peoples of St. Mary Mission, today and for the next 100 years!\n\nS. Claire’s Ministry focuses on Care of Creation\n\nBy: S. Claire Whalen\n\nS. Claire Whalen, OSF has discovered a ministry in Indiana that saves energy, helps our planet and serves the future needs of local communities and homeowners. She is deeply involved with the statewide solarizing program to offer information sessions and incentives for homeowners and businesses to consider using solar energy to reduce their carbon footprints. Here is information about S. Claire’s focus on the planet and how to become involved in this project.\n\nHomeowners and businesses in southeast Indiana will have an opportunity to install solar panels in the fall of 2018 at a reduced price. The local solarizing team in this area will offer three summer information sessions to encourage residents to go solar this fall before economic incentives disappear in a few years. Attendees will learn about these incentives that can reduce the cost of installing rooftop solar panels to a third of what the cost was just a few years ago. At each of the solar information sessions, persons who are currently using solar energy will be present to share their experience with solar power and answer questions.\n\nSessions will be held at Batesville Library, July 18, at the Tyson Library in Versailles on July 25, and at the Lawrenceburg Library on August 16. Meeting times at all three libraries will be from 6:00-7:15pm. RSVP to Claire Whalen, OSF, by email, [email protected], or call 812-933-6514. Bring data about your monthly and annual kilowatt hour usage to estimate what a solar system might cost for your home.\n\nThis statewide solarizing program is a group buying arrangement that puts going solar within reach for almost every homeowner. Solar panel owners can take advantage of a 30% federal tax credit until the end of 2019. And businesses have additional incentives with a generous accelerated depreciation bonus in the first year. Additionally Duke Energy customers will be able to lock in net-metering until 2032 for their excess home-generated solar power.\n\nSolarize Indiana/Southeast local team joined the state-wide program last year concentrating on the Batesville and Oldenburg areas. This year they are expanding their coverage to more towns. They already held solar home tours and information sessions this spring in Greensburg, Batesville and Brookville. Persons who signed contracts before late April are scheduled for installations from mid-May through September, 2018. Persons who sign contracts this summer will have installations in the fall months.\n\nThe team of volunteers is contracting with Lohrum Electrical Company from Greensburg for a second year in a row to do the installations needed for 2018 because of its excellent personal attention to customers’ needs, but also because of its competitive pricing, professional expertise, and workmanship warranty. Also, the team wanted to choose a local company to promote our local economy.\n\nResidents from near-by towns attend these solar information sessions to share their experience with sun-power. Dale Irvin from New Marion and Robert Jester from Morris will be available to tell Versailles attendees how solar panels on their homes have saved them considerable money on electric bills. Irvin will also explain how the specific installation on his garage is “off the grid” with a battery system back-up when there is a power outage. All energy guzzling equipment—refrigerator, freezer, furnace and workshop machines–are located in the garage for that purpose. Attend one of the meetings to talk to the people who have already participated in this project to cut costs, use alternative energy and take care of creation simultaneously."
