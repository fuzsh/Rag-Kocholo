        "text": "Private, secondary school in Oldenburg, Indiana, United States\n\nOldenburg Academy of the Immaculate Conception is a private Catholic high school in Oldenburg, Indiana. The Alma Mater is \"virtue, honor, and education.\"\n\nThe school was founded in 1851 by the Sisters of St. Francis and Mother Teresa Hackelmeier. Oldenburg Academy received its commission as a high school in 1910. By the 1940s, the school stopped including elementary level students, becoming a high school only. In 1994, Oldenburg Academy incorporated. Currently, the school is controlled by a board of trustees rather than the original owners, the Sisters of St. Francis. The boarding program ended at the end of the 1998â€“1999 school year and male students were admitted from the autumn semester of 2000 onward. In 2020, the academy constructed a new athletic facility named the Hillenbrand Family Feldhaus.\n\nIn 1986, the enrollment reached 117 students. The current enrollment is 228 students.\n\n\"History\". Oldenburg Academy ."
