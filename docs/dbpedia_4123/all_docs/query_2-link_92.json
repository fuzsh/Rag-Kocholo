        "text": "A ONCE IN A LIFETIME INVESTMENT.\n\n​\n\nIn the spring of 2022, the Board at Meridian Hills Country Club asked its membership to approve a $13 million capital plan. The process was subject to significant scrutiny, as a prior version of the proposal failed to receive the threshold necessary for approval.\n\nOur comprehensive plan built new marketing channels to better communicate information, provided forums to ask and find answers to questions, and created a grassroots team to build support for the initiative among stakeholders. Out of the total votes cast, 78% voted in favor of the project and 22% against. To pass, the vote needed to hit 67%.\n\nTENDING TO A GARDEN OF INBOXES, STRATEGICALLY.\n\n​\n\nMother-daughter duo Kelly and Lindsey McVey launched the first-ever Indiana Peony Festival in 2021, vibrantly celebrating the state’s national flower. The festival’s expansion has been exponential, quickly charting as one of the fastest-growing events in central Indiana.\n\nHeading into its third year, the 2023 Peony Fest's success hung in a challenging balance. Growth needed to happen strategically, in a controlled manner, so as not to overwhelm available resources. At the same time, new visitors, returning attendees, and vendors needed specific communication to stay informed and motivated to participate.\n\nIndiana Peony Festival approached MTCHBX to manage this challenge through an innovative email marketing campaign launched in the few months before the event.\n\n​\n\nThe messaging not only extended the organization’s brand — it enhanced the Indiana Peony Festival experience. The campaign prepared attendees, shared exclusive experiences, and provided blueprints for additional streams of revenue for the Indiana Peony Festival to unlock with its 10,000+ attendees.\n\nStrategy means always keeping one eye on the future, so the day of the event, MTCHBX was on the ground! We hit the streets with cameras in hand and drones in the sky, capturing the festivities and filling our creative banks for next year’s event.\n\n​\n\nFrom launch to event tear-down, MTCHBX kept stakeholders in various segments engaged, inspired, and informed. We can't wait for 2024's Peony Fest!\n\nTESTIMONIALS TO PREPARE THE FUTURE.\n\n​\n\nEnrollment is crucial to any school, but especially to an institution like Oldenburg Academy of the Immaculate Conception. Faced with the uncertainties and isolation of COVID-19 in the midst of plans to pivot and grow, OA needed a trustworthy and human way to connect with potential students and their families.\n\nWe gathered several current OA families whose stories demonstrate the various ways that OA changes lives and builds a better future for students. To safely and efficiently produce a 60-second ad and 2-minute video experience that thoroughly capture these stories, we made ample use of equipment such as teleprompters and drones in addition to our standard methods of audio/visual recording. Our guiding touches through scripting, on-location direction, and polished post-production allowed OA to confidently include this project in the foundation of its new chapter."
