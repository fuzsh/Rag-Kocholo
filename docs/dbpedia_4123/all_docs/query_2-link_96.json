JS^OOiV after the foundation of the Convent and opening of the Academy, it was the privilege of the author of this sketch to dwell in the sacred pre- cincts, and to take part in the dear Sisters trials and consolations. She therefore deems it a pleasant duty to offer them sincerest congratulations and the best wishes of a grateful heart on the auspicious occasion of the Golden Jubilee of the Community. In token thereof, these reminiscences of the past five decades are dedicated. If these grateful memories contribute but a mite to the edification of the present generation of Sisters and pupils, the object of these pages shall have been attained and their purpose ac- complished. Sincere thanks are due on the part of the writer, and are hereby cheerfully given, to the Sisters who so kindly placed for reference the Annals of the Com- munity at the disposal of THE AUTHOR. Feast of the Sacred Heart, June, iqoo. TO MARY IMMACULATE. OUR MOTHER. TO THE VENERABLE SISTERS WHO CHERISH THE MEMORY OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CALLED TO THEIR REWARD, TO THE FRIENDS OF OUR YOUTH, THE PUPILS OF OLDENBURG ACADEMY, AND TO ALL WHO HAVE SHARED IN THE EXPERIENCES OF EARLY DAYS. THESE PAGES ARE AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATED BY ONE OF THEIR NUMBER. OUR FOUNDER We loved him for the life he led, — The life of priest and saint; ' Twas pure as morning's lily fair, Yea, free from worldly taint. We loved him for his gentle smile That dried the sinner's tear ; We loved him for his kindly word, So full of hope and cheer. He led us through the dark'ning gloom, A bright, resplendent star ; He led us to a brighter land, To dream of bliss afar. He was \"Our Priest\" — his life was pure, With sanctity aglow; He taught us virtue, mercy, hope, Therefore we loved him so. Rev. Francis Joseph Rudolf. 'ART llRST. J850— J860. CHAPTER I. Introduction. — Present Status of the Community. — Its Object, the Education of Youth. — Annual Return of the Sisters to the Mother-House. JWfil'E parable of the mustard-seed may well be it applied to the Oldenburg Community of Franciscan Sisters: \"The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard-seed, which a man took and sowed in his field; which is the least indeed of all seeds; but when it is grown up, it is greater than all herbs, and ■ becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come, and dwell in the branches thereof.\" (Matt, xiii., 31, 32.) Thus did our Divine Saviour illustrate the law according to which the natural and spiritual life is developed. The minute grain of seed which the husbandman entrusts to the kind bosom of mother Earth reposes quietly and securely, shielded from all adverse influence. Presently it is thrilled with organic life, an enliv- ening force bursts its bonds, and expanding its slender rootlets it firmly grasps the nurturing soil. It is greeted by the sun's life-giving rays ; it unfolds its branches, leaves and blossoms appear, and at last golden fruit is the reward of the labor and patience expended. (ii) 12 Historical Sketch. When we cast a retrospective glance at the establishment and progress of the Oldenburg Con- vent of Sisters of St. Francis, we shall find that Divine Providence has not departed, in its case, from this all-wise course. Arrived at the close of the first half century of its foundation, the future lies before us, a sealed book — a veiled vision. Let us, therefore, pause a while, and admiring the work of God as it is presented to our gaze, follow our guide through the sacred domain of memory. Great, indeed, are the changes wrought since the first days of the Convent, but their very achievement demonstrates the wisdom and pru- dence of its Founders. The stately halls of to-day echo their names and are pervaded by their spirit. The Oldenburg Community of Sisters of St. Francis of the Third Order Regular, now numbers about five hundred members. The Sisters conduct seventy-six parochial schools, one of them being assigned exclusively to colored children. Further- more, ten Academies are doing successful work in the field of higher education. The property of the Community consists of the mother-house, with four hundred acres of land, and twelve mission houses. The Convent never was the beneficiary of great legacies or charities. The object of the Institute is the education of youth; and whatever has been accomplished in the way of building and Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. ]3 acquisition of property, is the result of the faithful adherence to the spirit of poverty, so earnestly inculcated by the Seraphic Founder. The surplus earnings of the Community were not, indeed, laid aside as a provision for the future, nor for personal use, but devoted to the greater glory of God, and to the salvation of souls. Once only in their history did the Sisters have recourse to charity. When their first Convent building was destroyed by fire, the Most Rev. Archbishop Purcell of Cincinnati invited them to take up a collection throughout the archdiocese, of which kind permis- sion they gratefully availed themselves. The Community is governed by a Superior General, each mission by a local superior. The annual vacation the Sisters spend in the Mother- house, at which time the spiritual exercises of a retreat are made in common. The purpose of the following pages is to keep alive in the memory of the Sisters and their pupils, the numerous acts of self-denial, humility and obedience by which their predecessors laid deep and broad the foundations of the Com- munity. If we ask: \"Who built this house?\" the answer is, \"Poverty, charity and confidence in God.\" It is the tree grown from the mustard-seed, and after fifty years, expanding its branches far and wide, and bearing rich fruit in His honor to Whom alone honor is due. CHAPTER II. Devoted Sduls.— \"My God and My All f— The First Convent Building. — Toil and Poverty. WJHE ancient castles in Europe that rear their 1 hoary walls on a solitary mountain's crest, or nestle in a secluded wooded valley, have, as a rule, an apartment devoted to the preservation of the portraits of the family's ancestors and other souvenirs dear for memory's sake. This apart- ment is a sanctuary wherein the household mem- bers enter with silent awe to dwell musingly on the achievements and experiences of former times. The ancestors of the Oldenburg Sisters' Com- munity are those devoted souls who, fifty years ago, lived, labored and suffered in the spirit of their Holy Father, St. Francis. Retired from the world, unmindful alike of praise or censure, they made their own their Holy Founder's devise, \"My God and My All !\" They devoted their time, their toil and their poverty to the one grand work of saving souls, in accord with the object of their Institute. Silenced in death, they now rest from their labors, (14) Sisters of St. Francis, Oldexburg, Ixd. 15 but their works are eloquent reminders of their deeds. The first Convent building in Oldenburg was a primitive stone structure without pretension, what- soever, to architectural style or ornamentation. It was divided into cells for the Sisters, who devoted themselves to the service of God and the salvation of the little ones so dear to our Saviour's Heart. Its history is as simple as was its appearance. , CHAPTER III. The Rev. Francis Joseph Rudolf, Founder of the Com- munity and of the Convent. — His Arrival in America, and First Labors. — Arrival at Oldenburg. — Poor Condition of the Mission. — The First Parish School. — A New Church. — Resolution to Build a Convent. f^HE Founder of the Oldenburg Community of Sisters of St. Francis is the Rev. Francis Joseph Rudolf, of sainted memory. He was ordained priest, August ioth, 1839, at Strassburg, Alsace. While yet a student of theology, he had resolved to devote himself to the American mis- sions, but was induced to serve three years as curate in his native diocese. In 1842 he received his dimissory letters and started on his voyage to the United States. On the ocean he had twice the happiness of celebrating the holy Sacrifice of the Mass, at which, as he related later, he included all the souls that would ever be committed to his care. After his safe arrival at the port of New York, he made haste to report to his Ordinary, the Right Rev. Celestine de la Hailandiere, Bishop of Vin- cennes, Indiana, who received him with paternal (16) Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 3 7 kindness, and appointed him pastor of Fort Wayne, Ind. There he labored faithfully until October 29th, 1844, when he was sent to Oldenburg to take charge of that congregation, which was composed almost exclusively of German immigrants who had settled in the farming districts of that neighbor- hood. Though the young missionary had been inured to hardships of all kinds, and certainly did not expect a life of ease or worldly advantages, he was scarcely prepared for the privations awaiting him at Oldenburg. On his arrival, he found an unfin- ished log house which was called the \"church,\" a log hut, which served him for a dwelling, and another intended for a school. These were the accommodations awaiting the zealous missionary at the place in which Providence had destined him to accomplish his life work. Who can describe his emotions on first beholding it ! Even then his penetrating mind had grasped the importance of the school question, which since that time has engaged the attention of Church and State. One of his first acts was the appoint- ment of a teacher to aid him in preparing the children of his parish for their first Communion. Under the circumstances, he could not expect to find a graduate of a normal college to take charge of the class, but deemed himself fortunate in find- 18 Historical Sketch. ing a man willing and well instructed, and moreover of religious character, to act in the capacity of teacher. He took up quarters in a small room attached to the school house. The latter, however, was sadly in need of repairs to make it a fit habitation. The class comprised twenty children, fourteen of whom were to be prepared for first Communion. Their parents had taught them their prayers, but the work of instruct- ing them for the most important act of their lives was by no means an easy one, as many of them were unable to read. The school was opened, and a regular course of instruction outlined. The inhabitants of Oldenburg and the surrounding country were mostly Germans, but Father Rudolf was convinced of the necessity of having the children instructed in both languages, the English and the German, and we can easily imagine how the zealous priest's mind was continually occupied with the thought of perfecting his school and raising its educational standard. He prayed and hoped, and his prayers and hopes were destined to accomplish even greater things than his most sanguine expectations had anticipated. The neighboring settlements were even poorer than the one at Oldenburg. As a rule, they com- prised a group of ten or twelve struggling German Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. U> families living in primitive log' huts, bare of every comfort. In these huts, the missionary was often compelled to say Mass. Such were the surroundings in which Divine Providence had placed the Founder of the Oldenburg Community of Sisters of St. Francis. Still deeply impressed with the disastrous results of the French Revolution, which he had witnessed in Europe, he was convinced of the necessity of Catholic education; hence his zeal for the Catholic school. The thought of providing capable teachers for them became uppermost in his mind. In prayerful meditation, he was convinced that the foundation of a Convent whose inmates should devote themselves exclusively to the education of youth, was the best solution of the problem. The sacrifices and difficulties encountered in the prose- cution of this plan shall become known, and redound to his glory, only on the great day of retribution. Whoever is acquainted with the situation of the' immigrants during the first half of the nineteenth century, will realize the poverty and privations with which the struggling Catholic congregations had to contend. In Oldenburg, the first cope used at benediction of the Blessed Sacrament was made of a shawl, the gift of a pious woman, Mrs. H. Fisse, and another, Mrs. C. 20 Historical Sketch. Siefert, desirous of adding her share, cut the flowers from hers to adorn it. Though the papers of that day never mentioned this gift, it is, no doubt, recorded in the Book of Life, and will receive its reward from Him who said of the poor widow in the Temple, that she had given more than all the others. Obstacles and privations did not discourage the pious missionary, who was, in truth, a man after God's own heart, living by faith, and finding in his ardent love for God and man the strength and confidence necessary to sustain the heaviest burdens of life. His support at all times was his unfailing trust in God, which was rewarded by the success of all his undertakings. Dark as the future might appear to him, he never lost courage. Relying upon his divine vocation, he accomplished a work, on which the Almighty Himself has set the seal of His approval. After opening the school at Oldenburg, Father Rudolf resolved to leave the log church unfinished and to build a large new one of stone, and also a parsonage of modest dimension. To this purpose he devoted what was left of his paternal inherit- ance. Plans were selected and building operations were begun. The corner-stone was laid in 1846, and on the first Sunday of Advent in the same year, the first services were held in the new church, but Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 21 not until the month of April, 1848, was it com- pleted in all its details. By that time the parsonage was also finished. Built, as it was, of stone and containing four large rooms, the simple people of the parish regarded it with wonder and remarked that their pastor must be, indeed, a rich man to be able to build such a fine house. In that same year, 1848, the celebrated Jesuit missionary, Rev. F. X. Weninger, preached a mission in the new church. It was his first mission in this country, in which he had arrived only a few months before, and the beginning of a missionary career of forty years, during which he tra\\rersed the United States repeatedly from the extreme north to the distant south, and from ocean to ocean. On this occasion he expressed his desire to be buried at the foot of the memorial cross erected to mark his first mission in America. Besides the congregation at Oldenburg, Father Rudolf had to attend to a number of outlying missions, and he devoted as much time, labor and care to them as to the former. During his solitary travels from place to place, he was wont to recite the rosary aloud. Though unheard by men, his prayers ascended to heaven and brought many a stray soul back to God. Once as he rode through the woods praying aloud, as usual, an old farmer, who was looking for some timber to build a house, 22 Historical Sketch. saw and heard him without being noticed by the Rev. Father. The good man, desirous of speaking to his Pastor, hid behind a tree to await the conclusion of his prayers, but he appeared so absorbed in God, that his parishoner could not summon courage to address him. Father Rudolf was truly a good shepherd of the souls entrusted to his care, and his devoted flock regarded him as such. In all their trials and difficulties they had recourse to him. Yet there were some who caused him great anxiety and trouble. Whenever the glory of God, or justice and right were at stake, he was fearless and out- spoken. In one of his missions there lived a Protestant family. The mother desired to become a Catholic, and was instructed and received into the Church by Father Rudolf. Shortly afterwards he was informed of a circumstance which proved that the marriage of the husband and wife in question was null and void, and told the woman that as a Catholic she was bound in conscience to a separation. She left him; in consequence of which, he threatened to shoot Father Rudolf. When the latter, on his next visit, approached the place, a number of his parishioners met him and begged him to return, as Mr. N. was about to kill him. But the fearless priest replied: \"He may take my life, but my soul is not in his power.\" Sisters of St. Francis., Oldenburg, Ind. 23 And he rode straightway to the enemy's house. Calling the man, he said to him : \"I have been informed just now that you want to shoot me. Is it so?\" The poor man was stunned. He could only stammer that he was, indeed, provoked because his wife had left him by order of the priest. Father Rudolf explained to him that he had not made the commandments of God or the Church, but that it was his duty as pastor to enforce their observance, and then told him for what reasons his wife was obliged to leave him, exhorting him at the same time to make his peace with God. Though the man remained obstinate, he never again troubled the good Pastor. CHAPTER IV. Authorization to Found a Convent. — Building It. — Arrival of Mother Teresa. — Vesting of the First Members. — Nezv Arrivals. — Removal to the Con- vent and Taking Charge of the School. JjBjH'E years 1848 and 1849 passed without 1 having brought about the realization of Father Rudolf's clearest wish, that of founding a Community of Sisters of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis, for the education of the youth of Oldenburg and vicinity. With the permission of the Bishop of Vincennes, Right Rev. Maurice de St. Palais, he now addressed a letter to the Cardinal Protector of the Franciscan Order at Rome, in which he vividly described and truthfully stated the great difficulty of obtaining teachers for his poor schools, and entreated him to secure the Holy See's consent to the foundation of a Convent at Oldenburg for this purpose. His request was readily granted. After receiving the permission. Father Rudolf at once began preparations for the building of a Convent. Confidence in God and fervent zeal were his only capital. He wrote to Father Ambrose (24) J3 & > S Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg,, Ixd. 2o Buchmaier, a Franciscan missionary in New York City, asking him to secure some professed Sisters of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis, for the purpose of engaging\" in the work. Whilst Father Rudolf proceeded with the building of the Convent, Father Buchmaier visited Europe and looked about for Sisters willing to come to Olden- burg. His efforts were crowned with success in Vienna, the Austrian capital. The Mother Superior of the Sisters of the Third Order in that city, proposed the matter to her Sisters for reconsideration. Two of the number volunteered to devote their services to the distant mission ; and after obtaining the consent of the Franciscan Provincial, they started for America. That these two Sisters had a true conception of the difficulties awaiting them is apparent from the fact that one of them, who in her humility thought herself not endowed with the requisite qualities, returned home before reaching the port of em- barkation. Her companion, Sister Teresa, con- tinued alone on the journey and arrived safe in Xew York in December, 1850. Father Buchmaier, who had meanwhile returned, received her most kindly, and sent her to her destination. Sister Teresa arrived at Oldenburg on January 6th, 1 85 1. Father Rudolf welcomed her with a heart overflowing with gratitude to God for the 26 Historical Sketch. realization of his long cherished hopes. Pending the completion of the Convent., he rented a small house, which was to serve as a temporary home for the new Community, for whilst awaiting Sister Teresa's arrival., he had accepted three postulants. They now began their conventual life, devoting their time to prayer, study and work. After the completion of the Convent building, they were to be formally installed as teachers of the parochial school. Even now they began a course of study and instruction in religion — to the great vexation of a certain gentleman, who opened an evening- school in opposition, which, however, soon proved a failure. On April 21st, Easter Monday, 185 1, the three postulants were invested with the religious habit and entered upon their novitiate. They were called Sisters Michaela, Gabriela and Josepha. At that time a professor by the name of Probst made his home with Father Rudolf. Studying for the priesthood, he had already received minor orders, when he lost the use of his right arm, which defect incapacitated him for the sacerdotal office. Father Rudolf had kindly received him into his house and employed him in giving instructions, and other duties. A learned and pious man, he was glad to show his gratitude to Father Rudolf by instructing the Sisters in pedagogics. They were eager to Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 27 avail themselves of this opportunity of increasing their knowledge, for books on this and kindred topics were scarce amongst them. To Professor Probst, they are also indebted for guiding into their Community Miss Teresa Dreer, later Mother Antonia, whose acquaintance he had casually made at Rorschach, Switzerland. A young lady of superior education, gifted with noble qualities of mind and heart, she had resolved to enter the religous state and to devote her life to the education of youth, but had not yet made her choice of a particular Community. During his sojourn with Father Rudolf, the Professor wrote to her, describing the good she might accomplish in and for the struggling Community at Oldenburg. After consultation with her confessor, and with his approval, she departed for America, solely for the purpose of joining the Order in the Convent to which she had been invited. She arrived at Oldenburg, June ioth, 185 1, and was cordially received by Father Rudolf and the Sisters. October 31st, vigil of the feast of All Saints, the Sisters took possession of their new Convent. The Community consisted of five persons : Vener- able Mother Teresa, who had been chosen Superior General, three novices, and a postulant. The building was far from being completed, only the four walls and a roof constituted the present habita- 28 Historical Sketch. tion. In the refectory the casements were without windows: a partition of rough boards whose wide chinks admitted the wind and rain, enclosed the school room. The winter of 185 1 was very severe, and for weeks the cold was intense. The cutting1 north wind had free access to the scantilv furnished dwelling. The furniture consisted of a few trunks, some comforts and one bedstead. Boards nailed together did duty as bedsteads, tables and benches. By and by, a few tables and chairs were added, and the kitchen was furnished with the necessary utensils, which poor arrange- ments seemed a great improvement to the Sisters. In November, 185 1, the Sisters took definite charge of the parochial school. It then numbered twenty children, and each child was expected to pay a tuition fee of twenty-five cents per month. This, considering the small number of children, amounted but to a trifle, so that the Sisters depended for their support mainly on the charity of Father Rudolf and a few better-to-do families. Their scant provision was supplemented by hard manual labor and the most ingenious economy. Even the color of their religious habit is clue to their poverty. When the question presented itself whether to wear the traditional brown of the Franciscans, or black, the latter color was chosen because brown material was scarce and costly, Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 29 whereas black was easily procurable at a reasonable figure. And once adopted, the color of the habit was never changed. Despite their poverty, the members of the young Community were contented and happy, for they loved and cherished Holy Poverty, the spouse of their Blessed Father St. Francis, in whose spirit they had entered upon their career of sacrifice and self-denial. Great as their trials and privations were, their consolations were still greater. Their zeal was extraordinary — a zeal not manifest in less fervent souls, and hence its reward was also extra- ordinary. The two lots on which the first Convent was built were purchased by Father Rudolf out of his own private funds, from the Bishop, to whom they had been deeded by a family in return for the board and tuition of their son in the seminary. In the course of time, as their means increased, the Sisters' surroundings became more comfortable. CHAPTER V. Aspect of the First Convent. — The Parlor. — The First Chapel. — The Blessed Sacrament in the Chapel. — The Cells. — The Refectory. — The Community Room. HE general aspect of the Convent at the end of the year 1851, was far from imposing — a stone house, two stories high, severe in its sim- plicity. At the entrance a small vestibule, which served also as a parlor, on the wall a crucifix and a crown of thorns; its furniture, a small table and three chairs. From the door, a stairway led to a corridor in the upper story, in which were situated the chapel and the cells. The Chapel was a room twelve feet long by fourteen wide. The altar was made of a few boards covered with green cloth. The tabernacle was a wooden box, lined with silk. Two wooden candle-sticks completed the outfit. A large turnip, hollowed out and covered with gilt paper, did duty as an altar lamp. Two pictures on the wall and a few rude benches ended the equipment. Here the Sisters recited the office and other community prayers. (30) Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 31 Towards the end of 1852, the Bishop granted the Community the privilege of reserving the Blessed Sacrament in the Chapel. How fervently must their prayers have ascended to Heaven when they adored for the first time their Divine Lord dwelling amongst them in the Sacrament of His Love! Their poor Chapel now surpassed in real glory the splendors of Solomon's Temple ! The Sisters' lowly cells were furnished with a poor bed, consisting of a straw pallet, a pillow and a comfort, a small table with a crucifix and a copy of the \"Following of Christ\" on it, a priedieu, a chair and two sacred prints. MY CELL. 0 small and cherished cell, So calm, so pure, so dear, 1 love thee. O, so well, Because my Spouse dwells here. Away from wordly past, From pleasures that soon cloy. To thee I fled at last To find my sweetest joy. Rejoice, my soul, rejoice In sacred heavenly peace, Where wordly strife and noise And earthlv combats cease. 32 Historical Sketch. Thy life, espoused to God, Shall in this cell be spent, With consolations fraught That never, never end. 'Tis but too true, alas. I know it but too well, That trials will not pass The door of this my cell. But Jesus dear is nigh To comfort and to aid, With power from on high, His loving, trusting maid. And when this life is past, When I receive His call, I'll hear the words at last, The sweetest words of all \"Beloved and faithful spouse, O come, receive the crown Prepared in Heaven's house For such as thee, my own!\" The refectory was as scantily furnished as the rest of the house. Long, rough boards served for a table, and the seats and reader's desk were of the same material. Pictures, representing the Last Supper and the Good Shepherd, hung on either side of the crucifix, forming the only ornaments Sisters of St. Francis, Oldexburg, Ixd. 33 on the walls. Strict silence was observed during meals, and the whole Community listened atten- tively to the spiritual reading. The fare was simple, yet nourishing, and spiced with acts of mortifica- tion and self-denial. The community room was set apart for the performance of various kinds of needlework and other community exercises. The furniture con- sisted of a long table of the same description as that in the refectory, with a bench on either side. The Sisters' privations seemed often insupportable, but when all human resources failed, God's help was always apparent, and their trust in Providence never was betraved. CHAPTER VI. Approbation by the Holy See and Authorization to Receive the Profession of Members. — An Academy Begun. — Its First Pupils. — Taking Charge of the District School. — Nocturnal Choir. — New Build- ings.— Reception of Orphans. f^HE Sisters lived contented and happy amid the poverty of their surroundings, grateful for the privilege of a Convent, in which they could prepare themselves without distractions for the duties of their vocation. In the beginning of 1852 the Community received, in confirmation of the episcopal authorization, the approbation of the Holy See, with permission to admit novices to pro- fession. Thus the first step towards permanency had been made. The efforts of the Sisters now began to find recognition. We find, even at that early period, the humble beginnings of a boarding school, to which six pupils from the vicinity were admitted. The first two of these were Catherine Bennet, from Dover, Indiana, and Sarah Moormann, from Richmond, Indiana. Ten others followed soon afterwards. I 3 u < c u 5 < - < < u Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 35 June 2nd, 1852, the first three novices were admitted to profession, their vows being received by Father Rudolf and Mother Teresa. Rev. Father Stahl, of New Alsace, and Rev. Father Engeln, of St. Peter's, assisted at the ceremonies. The former delivered an eloquent sermon. August 15th, feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin, a postulant was vested with the religious habit and received the name of Sister Bernarcline, at present the oldest member of the Community. May God prolong her life for the celebration of her Golden Jubilee. December- 8th, feast of the Immaculate Conception, Sister Antonia pronounced her vows in presence of Father Rudolf, Mother Teresa and the Community. In the autumn of this year, the Sisters took charge of the district school. Catholics forming the population of the entire neighborhood, only Catholic children frequented the school, and it was easily arranged that the Sisters, after a successful examination, were appointed public teachers, with able Sister Antonia at their head. This arrange- ment continues to the mutual satisfaction of those interested at Oldenburg and in the neighboring villages to the present time. The number of pupils increased rapidly. The girls' class now comprised sixty pupils. The boys' class was taught by a male teacher. The Sisters devoted themselves with great zeal to their young charges. God's blessing rested 36 Historical Sketch. visibly upon the Community. Privations, however, were still the Sisters' daily portion. Father Rudolf aided them to the full extent of his ability, but at times he himself had not the wherewithal to pay even his hired laborers. During the spring the Sisters began to cultivate the ground around the Convent. It was overgrown with weeds and briars, full of stones, holes and mounds, the removal of which proved a very diffi- cult task. They cheerfully performed this hard labor, hoping for God's blessing, and it was not withheld. The day when a postulant arrived, or a novice was admitted to profession, was always one of rejoicing for the whole Community. Notwith- standing their arduous labors, the Sisters arose at midnight to recite Matins and Lauds. In addition to the community prayers, each Sister had an hour's adoration assigned to her every day. The fasts prescribed by the Church and the Rule, were strictly observed by the Sisters. Father Buchmaier continued a true friend and helper of the Community. He sent a number of postulants, who became good, loyal and useful religious. He also provided them with a supply of office books, which, like so many other things, were scarce when the number of Sisters had increased. Good Mother Teresa's consolation at witness- ing the cheerful self-denial with which the Sisters Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 37 endured their various privations, was great indeed. But her own example drew irresistibly, whilst her counsel and advice guided them. The year 1853 began auspiciously for the young Community. The Sisters' labors for the education of youth, and their other undertakings promised well. In May of that year, four postulants arrived from New York, who, assisted by Divine grace, had braved all obstacles in order to join the Com- munity, and cheerfully submitted, after their admission, to all the privations and austerities that awaited them. On the feast of St. Clare, August 1 2th, five postulants were received into the novitiate and named Sisters Cecilia, Aloysia, Paula, Angela and Alphonsa. The Sisters' garden, which had cost them so much labor, now yielded a sufficient supply of vegetables for the wants of the Community. One moonlight night, when the Sisters arose for their usual midnight devotions, they heard a noise in the garden. On investigation, they found two men helping themselves to a wheelbarrow load of vegetables. Surprised by the Sisters, the men fled, leaving the wheelbarrow behind them. They had stolen it from Father Rudolf. On the feast of St. Francis, October 4th, a postulant from New York received the religious habit and the name of Sister Ludovica. Sister Bernardine was admitted to the profession of her 38 Historical Sketch. vows on December 8th. Towards the close of the year 1853, the Community comprised thirteen members. Perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sac- rament was now introduced, and continued day and night without intermission. The number of Sisters steadily increased, and the educational training of the novices was entrusted to the intelligent and ardent Sister Antonia. It now became necessary to think of the enlargement of the Convent building. After mature deliberation, the addition of a wing was decided upon, and building operations were at once begun. About this time, in the spring of 1854, the Community bought forty acres of land, and because of their poverty they could not hire farm laborers, they cultivated the ground themselves. From this time forward the Sisters never suffered want. On the Convent grounds a barn and stable were built, and stock and poultry supplied, so that the Com- munity henceforth had a supply of milk, butter, eggs, etc. On the feast of St. Joseph, March 19th, two postulants were received and named, respectively, Sisters Stanislas and Veronica. The latter was Father Rudolf's niece, and had arrived from Europe within the preceding winter for the purpose of joining the Community. Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ixd. 39 The addition to the Convent was now in course of construction. Like the old part, it was built of stone and comprised two stories. The lower one contained a class room, the original one having long since become too small. A new Chapel was also provided. As remarked before of the original structure, the cells were in the second story. But for want of means, the building was not completed. October ist, four novices were admitted to pro- fession, and on November 15th, two postulants arrived from Battenheim, Alsace, Father Rudolf's birthplace. One of these, Miss Teresa Fischesser, who became ill during the voyage, died four months after her arrival. Hers was the first death that occurred in the Convent. As she had come with the intention of joining the Community, . she was invested with the religious habit on her deathbed, and received the name of Sister Brigitta. Notwithstanding the Community's poverty. Mother Teresa, at the suggestion of the benevolent Rev. Founder, sheltered from this year on, eleven needy little orphans. She began this work of charity, saying: \"As our good God cares for us so well, we must show our gratitude by providing for these poor little ones.\" And Providence did, indeed, continue to bless the young Community, for at this period the Sisters began to receive calls to take charge of schools in other congregations. CHAPTER VII. A New Chapel. — The First and Second Mission School. — Daily Mass in the Chapel. — Retreats. — Other Mission Schools. {N the spring of 1855, the new building was com- pleted. The Chapel was a great improvement on the small room hitherto used as such. Its dimension was twenty by thirty feet. The altar, although simple, was painted a pure white, and the kneeling benches, too, were of a better style than the old ones. The lowly turnip lamp was replaced by one of glass. Two oil paintings, representing St. Francis and St. Clare, adorned the walls. The Sisters, who had hitherto gone to the parish church for the reception of the Sacraments, now received them in the Chapel, as Mass was celebrated there from time to time. In March two postulants were admitted to the novitiate, and were henceforth known as Sisters Gertrude and Elizabeth. The latter had met Mother Teresa aboard the ship, when crossing the ocean, and was so attracted towards her, that she felt happy in her presence only. After remain- ing in Xew York for some time, she decided to (40) .-I a 3 Sd £-1 >. in S > ;• II Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ixd. 41 enter a religious Community. Her confessor directed her to Oldenburg. Who can imagine her surprise and joy when she found Mother Teresa at the head of the Convent there! This year, in May. the Sisters took charge of their first mission school at the request of Rev. A. Bennet, pastor of the congregation at Dover, Indiana. Sisters Bernardine, Gabriela and Ver- onica were sent there. The classes comprised one hundred children. For want of an organist two low Masses had been celebrated heretofore on Sundays. After the Sisters' arrival, they instructed the children in singing, and soon they were suffi- ciently advanced to sing the Latin text at High Mass. Sister Veronica presided at the organ. At the end of June the classes were in excellent condi- tion. As to the school house, it was a miserable hut; without plastering or ceiling. A dwelling not having been provided for the Sisters, the Pastor gave up his own house to them and sought lodging elsewhere. The good priest was very poor, but did everything in his power to help the Sisters. For them it was a hard beginning, indeed, fraught with trials and privations. In July the Sisters returned to the mother-house for the retreat and vacation. Two postulants, germane sisters, received the religious habit and were called Sisters Rose and Rosalia. 42 Historical Sketch. During the fall of this year, Rev. Leander Streber, O. F. M., of Louisville, Ky., requested the Sisters to found an establishment in that city. His petition had to be refused for want of a suffi- cient number of teachers. In September the Sisters returned to Dover, and at the urgent request of Rev. Father Koering, the Community took charge of the school at St. Leon, Indiana. The number of children there amounted to fifty. The school house and Sisters' dwelling were in a very poor condition. Such was the beginning of the Sisters' mission schools. They were untiring in teaching, and besides, devoted much time to the mission churches, decorating the altars and attending to the sacristy. We have already mentioned that the Sisters had Mass in their home Chapel only at intervals. Father Rudolf had, up to this time, no assistant, and besides Oldenburg, the spiritual care of a number of distant missions devolved upon him. In the autumn of 1855, he received an assistant in the person of Rev. P. Weber, and henceforth the Sisters enjoyed the inestimable privilege of attend- ing Mass in their Chapel every day. They duly esteemed this great grace, and were grateful, too, for the additional one of now being able to receive holy Communion at a regular hour, whereas here- tofore, they had been obliged to await Father Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 43 Rudolf's return from his missions, which was often of necessity, very irregular. In November, Father Koering requested the Sisters to take charge of the schools at Brookville, Indiana. The number of pupils was about thirty, and each child was expected to pay thirty cents for tuition per month. At present this school numbers one hundred and thirty-five children, who are taught by three Sisters. Added to this is an Advanced and Commercial Course. At first, to their sore regret, the Sisters at Brookville had Mass only once a week, at which they also received holy Communion. About this time the number of Sisters in the mother-house was twenty-five, scarcely sufficient for their ever-increasing tasks, and it cost them many an act of heroic self-denial to perform their daily duties. A young Sister, having been appointed for the fourth time during the week to keep the night watch before the Blessed Sacrament, thought it rather hard to keep awake till midnight so often. After the Sisters had retired to rest, she knelt before the Tabernacle and prayed : \"My dear Jesus, I can scarcely keep my eyes open. Waking or sleeping I am Thine, and my desire is, never to offend Thee. But pardon me, I must sleep a little while.\" Making the sign of the cross, she lay down before the altar and immediately fell asleep. She 44 Historical Sketch. awoke only when the clock struck one, and imme- diately hastend to the Mother Superior, to accuse herself of her fault, expecting a severe reprimand. But the good Mother merely said : \"Sister, you have been in the Convent so long, and you surely have heard that the saints, after remaining whole nights in communion with God, complained that daybreak arrived so soon. Compare your fervor with theirs.\" This mild reproof was never for- gotten. At the close of this year the Academy had rwenty-three pupils, and the orphans' department, twelve. On April 16th, 1856, two postulants were admitted into the novitiate, and received the names of Sisters Philomena and Dorothea. The retreat was this year conducted by Father Rudolf himself, the exercises being held in the new Chapel. In September, the Sisters took charge of the school at Wolf's Creek, one of Father Koering's missions, with the agreement that the congregation provide a dwelling-house for them and furnish provisions, in addition to a tuition fee of ten cents per month for each child. But, alas! this agree- ment was soon forgotten. The school house and Sisters' dwelling were the property of a parishoner who was to receive a monthly rent of eight dollars. When this was no longer forthcoming, he seized, Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 45 one evening, the Sisters' belongings, set them out into the public road, and ordered the Sisters them- selves to leave his premises at once. They returned to the mother-house, resigned to the decrees of Providence. The school in Blue Creek, or St. Peters, was also opened this year. In the fall, Rev. Father William Unterthiner, Superior of the Franciscans in Cincinnati, visited the Sisters. He remained three days, saying Mass in their Chapel and addressing the Community in most fervent and encouraging terms, daily. The history of the Community in the year 1856 records no remarkable events. Silently and perse- veringly each Sister devoted herself to her particular duties, thus attaining that peace of mind with which God rewards those that give themselves unreservedlv to Him. CHAPTER VIII. Destruction of the Convent by Fire. — The Blessed Sacrament Saved. — The Sisters Sheltered. — Father Rudolf's and Father Weber's Generosity. — Forti- tude of the Sisters and their Pupils. — The School Continued. {jlftHE year 1857 opened auspiciously, but ere long a^ proved a most disastrous one for the Com- munity. The latter had attained comparative pros- perity at the cost of many a sacrifice and privation, and now numbered twenty-eight members, who had charge of a boarding school and the parish school at Oldenburg, and of five mission schools. Grateful to God for His blessings, the Sisters and their pupils regarded, next to Him, Father Rudolf as their greatest benefactor. Venerable Sister Ann was admitted to her religious Profession just three days before the terrible visitation. January 23rd, feast of the Espousals of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in the afternoon at two o'clock, at the daily hour of the great silence, when every inmate of the Convent was religiously intent on her duties assigned, the sudden cry of \"Fire!\" speedily followed by the ringing of the church bells, Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 47 alarmed them. It was a bitter, cold day, and a deep snow covered the ground. From a defective flue the flames had been communicated to the attic of the Convent building, and soon the roof was a seething mass of fire. The cutting blast hastened the destruction. Means to extinguish the con- flagration were not at command, and soon a heap of blackened ruins marked the spot so recently the scene of activity, contentment and happiness. The people of the village and of the whole neighborhood had hastened to the scene of disaster, but all they could do, was to aid the Sisters in saving portions of furniture. They received the pupils and orphans into their own homes. Meanwhile the Sisters con- tinued to work in the cold and the snow, snatching from the ruins whatever they could of the goods they had acquired at the cost of so much labor and self-denial. When the alarm was given, Mother Teresa and another Sister were engaged in embroidering a chasuble. Not a thought entered their minds when they took up this work, that in a few hours their dear Chapel would be a heap of ruins. On seeing the flames, they hastily wrapped the chasuble and a few other articles in a blanket snatched from a bed, and hastened down stairs. Mother Teresa led. When they had hurried half way down the stairway, a piece of burning timber fell from the ■48 Historical Sketch. attic and struck her companion. After advancing a few steps, Mother Teresa swooned and fell to the floor. She was carried to the parsonage, where good Father Weber placed his own room at her disposal, whilst he was content to retire to a small apartment near the sacristy. She rallied only the next day. Her first inquiry was, whether the Blessed Sacrament had been saved and how the Sister fared who had been struck by the falling timber. They informed her that Father Weber had braved the danger of entering the burning building, and had rescued the Blessed Sacrament, that the Sister had not been hurt, and that all the Sisters and children were removed to a -place of safety. The greater part of the furniture, a number of books, and the contents of the linen closet had been saved. Of the building, the smoldering ruins alone remained. The cruel flames had devoured the fruit of seven years' toil and privation. When evening spread its mantle of darkness over the scene of the disaster, the Sisters knew not where to turn for food and shelter. They were still among the ruins, resolved to remain together. A good woman, Mrs. Peine, brought them some hot milk and bread. The sorely tried Sisters grate- fully partook of this meagre meal, heaven's canopy their only shelter. Good Mrs. Peine also provided them with socks, a most welcome gift, indeed, as the Sisters had worked in the snow all afternoon Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 49 and had no change of foot-wear. The physician and two Sisters were in constant attendance on Mother Superior Teresa. Indeed, all the Sisters seemed to have forgotten the calamity in their anxiety for the dear Mother's life. On the clay of the fire, Father Rudolf was at New Alsace attending to that mission, and on receiving the sad intelligence, he raised his eyes to Heaven and exclaimed, with Job : \"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; as it hath pleased the Lord so is it clone; blessed be the name of the Lord.\" (Chap. II, 21.) And then set out imme- diately on his return with a heavy, though resigned heart. Meanwhile the Sisters found refuge in the old log church, which was still standing and had served as a sort of barn. They had saved some bedding from the flames, but there was no thought of sleep that night, though the Sisters were glad to be sheltered against the inclemency of the weather. Their breakfast, next morning, consisted of half a cup of coffee, their dinner of a dish of beans and a slice of bread. ' One Sister, who never before had relished beans, remarked : \"Beans have never tasted as good as to-day.\" On returning\", Father Rudolf placed his own house at the Sisters' disposal, reserving only one room for his private use. The attic of the old log- church was converted, into a dormitory for the 50 Historical Sketch. Sisters. Classes for the Academy pupils were immediately resumed. A temporary room for the parish school was fitted up with remnants taken from the ruins, and lessons re-commenced. Mother Superior soon recovered, and devoted herself with unabated zeal to promote the welfare of the Com- munity. The patience and resignation with which the Sisters and pupils bore this trial, were a source of great consolation to her. Not a postulant, much less a novice, expressed a desire of returning home, and not one of the pupils left. On the contrary, a number of new ones applied for admission. The dear Sisters still living, who witnessed the destruction wrought by the flames, will never forget those days. Oh ! could they now embrace the dear departed, after the lapse of fifty years, on the very spot where they then stood, love of the Crucified and sisterly affection alone sustaining them in the hour of trial, how they would rejoice at the changes wrought since then, whilst contemplating the beautiful buildings and admiring the grand church with its majestic tower rising heavenward, and seeming to say: \"There, on high, we shall meet our loved ones, to part with them no more!\" The exquisite statue of Mary Immaculate, guarding the main entrance, is the gift of a dear pupil, a mute, but nevertheless most eloquent evidence of the affec- tionate attachment which binds the hearts of pupils and teachers to their Alma Mater. Sisters of St. Francis, Oldexburg, Ixd. 51 AFTER THE FIRE. Out in the wintry blast Cutting and cold. Homeless and shelterless, Lambs without fold ! Before them The black, smoking ruins of home, And o'er them The darkening, night-curtained dome; Where shall they turn for shelter and rest? Where shall the turtle-dove find her a nest?

Have they not followed their Crucified Love? Have not their hearts on God's altar been laid? Was not the holocaust Lovingly, trustingly, perfectly made? — Lo ! through the rifts of the deepening night Cometh the answer. In silvery light The stars of Orion's belt twinkle on high, A message of hope from the pitying sky : \"Them whom God loveth He toucheth with pain, But crowneth their losses with heavenly gain.\" Soft on their hearts, as the dew on the flower, But low in the dust by the storm and the shower, God's peace brought new strength When Hope wrestled with Faith in that terrible hour. No vain repining ! With brave hearts and true, With hands e'en more willing than able to do, They wielded the weapons of labor and prayer Till, replacing the old, rose a new home more fair. CHAPTER IX. The New Convent. — A Collecting Tour. — Charitable Gifts of Benefactors at Home and Abroad. — Laying of the Corner-stone of the New Chapel. — The Feast of the Immaculate Conception. — St. Joseph's Convent Bell. — A Pipe Organ. ENEWED sacrifice and a repetition of the former privations were now in store for the sorely tried Community. Mother Teresa's trust in God was unwavering. She encouraged the Sisters, in the words of their saintly Founder: \"Our good God has brought us together here; if this Com- munity is His work, He will help us, and we shall prosper; if it be the work of man, it will be dissolved. Let us pray that God's will be done.\" It was God's work, and it prospered. The walls of the ruined Convent had remained standing, but they were so insecure that they had to be torn down. The loss was a total one, as there was no insurance on the building. After due con- sideration, Father Rudolf and Mother Teresa resolved to rebuild the Convent. A week after the (-32) Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 53 fire, lumber for the new building was cut in the neighboring- woods. Despite their poverty, the Sisters until now never had recourse to charity. But in their present, straitened circumstances, they resolved to apply to the generosity of good Catholics. In the spring. 1857, Mother TeresaJ though ailing, went to Cin- cinnati accompanied by Sister Dorothea, to take up a collection in the archdiocese, having previously obtained Archbishop PurcelFs ready consent. He added a gift of ten dollars to his letter of recom- mendation. During their stay in Cincinnati, the Sisters were the recipients of the Duesterberg family's hospitality. They entered first upon this arduous task in St. John's parish, which was in charge of the Franciscan Fathers. The late Father Otho Jair, O. F. M., received them most kindly. Going from house to house, the Sisters collected twelve hundred dollars in the course of five weeks. With one exception, they met with great kindness when soliciting the Rev. Pastors' permission to collect in their parishes. Finally, as a result of their unwonted exertions, both the Venerable Mother and Sister fell ill, and were compelled to return to Oldenburg. Meanwhile, friends of the Rev. Founder, in Fort Wayne, contributed three hundred dollars to the building fund. The Missionary Association in 54 Historical Sketch. Munich, Bavaria, and Vienna, Austria, each sent a check for two hundred dollars, with a box of books and other useful articles. Towards autumn, Mother Teresa's health had sufficiently improved to permit her to undertake another collecting tour. With Sister Rosalia for her companion, she went to St. Louis, Mo., for this purpose, and here, too, readily obtained the per- mission of Archbishop Kenrick and Vicar General Melcher, but some of the Rev. Rectors refused to allow them to collect in their parishes, and the result of three weeks' labor was the meagre sum of four hundred dollars. The names of their benefactors are certainly recorded in the Book of Life, and the Community continues to pray for them every day. A poor servant girl who was able to contribute only five cents, declared, that from that day on she was successful in everything she undertook. To-day she is a wealthy woman, and well known for her liberality towards the needy, and to poor churches. During the summer, 1857, work on the new building was continued, and November 19th it was sufficiently advanced to permit the Sisters to occupy it. True, cold and dampness caused much suffering, but did not interfere with the Sisters' work. Two rooms, divided by folding doors, were used as a Chapel, in which Mass was celebrated. The altar, benches and confessional that had been Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 55 snatched from the fire, were now again used. A portion of the new Convent was divided into rooms for the use of the pupils and the orphans. In this year the following Sisters took the vows : Sister Elizabeth, April 22nd; Sisters Rose and Rosalia, November 19th; Sisters Vincentia, Mechtildis and Agatha, December 8th. In the spring, 1858, the corner-stone of a new and large Chapel was laid. The Convent building was pushed to completion. This year the Sisters, at the request of Rev. R. Weinzoepflen, took charge of the school at New Alsace. By December 8th, the Chapel was so far advanced that it could be used for divine service, and was accordingly dedicated, with all the solemnity possible under the circumstances. Most gladly would the Sisters have decorated it right royally for that day, the feast of the Immaculate Conception, but holy poverty had to serve as its choicest ornament, as the Community's means were exhausted. The good Sister Sacristan was not at all satisfied with the aspect of the bare walls, and contriving to find a piece of blue velvet, she trans- formed it into a sort of niche, which she decorated with white paper roses. True, the result was far from artistic, but we trust that our Immaculate Mother regarded rather the good will, than what it accomplished. 56 Historical Sketch. About this time the Sisters also purchased a small but sweet-toned bell for the Chapel. It was blessed and called St. Joseph's Bell. It is the same that to-day resounds from the belfry of the magnifi- cent new Convent Church. Under the firm and guiding hand of Father Rudolf, stimulated by his untiring zeal, and led on by Mother Teresa's piety and prudence, the Com- munity prospered visibly. Schools were given in charge of the Sisters in various parishes, and the Academy attached to the Mother-house received a steady increase of pupils, twenty-seven being now enrolled. The following Sisters were admitted to holy Profession, in 1858: Sisters Margaret, Philomena and Dorothea, May 3d; Sister Agnes, October 15th. In January, 1859, death claimed Sister Philo- mena. She fell a victim to typhoid fever at New Alsace. Five weeks later Sister Gabriela died of an apoplectic stroke. The sad loss of these two good members was severely felt by the little Com- munity. In March, the Sisters were entrusted with the schools at Yorkville and Morris, Indiana. As the number of orphans continued to increase, a separate house was built for them, adjoining the Convent, a part of which was reserved for the Academy pupils. For the latter a separate building was Sisters of St. Francis, Oldexburg, Ind. 57 planned, but want of means compelled the Sisters to postpone its erection indefinitely. The feast of the Immaculate Conception was again drawing nigh, and Father Sigrist, of Indian- apolis, had been invited to deliver the festival sermon. The day before this feast Father Rudolf was stricken with typhoid fever. His recovery was declared impossible by the physicians. The Sisters, as was their wont in all troubles, had recourse to the Mother of Sorrows, and prayed that the precious life of their dear and blessed Founder might be spared. And contrary to all human expectation, the good Father recovered, and was again able to celebrate Mass on the feast of the Most Holy Name of Jesus, January 14th, i860. About this time the Chapel received a number of gifts. From Rorschach, Switzerland, the Bau- hoefer family sent two large, splendid oil paintings, one representing the stigmatization of St. Francis, the other, St. Elizabeth distributing bread to the poor, and a check for two hundred dollars. A chalice, a ciborium, a silk chasuble and a beautiful missal were presented by other bene- factors. December 18th, 1859, three Sisters set out f 01- St. Louis, Missouri, on the invitation of Rev. C. Doebbener, who placed them in charge of Holy Trinity's school. The ground had been donated, 58 Historical Sketch. and the house bought for $6,000. They began to teach on January 2nd, i860, the classes comprising one hundred and thirty-five children. Thus, 1859 closed most auspiciously, and the new year was ushered in with good prospects. On the 2nd of February, i860, Sisters Raphaela and Petrina, and on the 2nd of July Sisters Johanna and Eustachia, made their final vows. Three of these noble souls are still actively at work as zealous and efficient as in the fervent days of early profes- sion. As the means increased, the Chapel was furnished with necessary articles. One of the first of these was a pipe organ, which was acquired at a cost of seven hundred dollars, a sum considered rather high at that time. Mother Teresa was most solicitous to have the services in the Chapel as solemn as possible. She devoted all the time she could spare from prayer and the training of her religious, to the making of church ornaments, vestments, banners, etc. But now the severest trial of all began to fore- cast its shadows on the young Community. Mother Teresa's health had been poor for several years. During the summer of i860, she was unable to leave her room. In the autumn she seemingly revived, and was able to assist at Mass on the feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin, September 8th. But the improvement was of short duration. A few days later, and the final message came. CHAPTER X. Mother Teresa. — A Sketch of Her Life. — Her Char- acter.— Her Solicitude for the Community. — Called to Her Reward. ENERABLE MOTHER TERESA, Found- ress and first Superior General of the Olden- burg- Community of Sisters of St. Francis of the Third Order Regular, had the privilege of being- trained to piety and virtue from early childhood by <ruly Christian parents. At the early age of nine years she was permitted to receive her first holy Communion. Directed by a pious and enlightened confessor, she made rapid strides in perfection, so that her director permitted and counseled her, even whilst she was in her early girlhood, to receive holy Communion weekly. From her entrance into the Order till her happy death, daily confession and Communion were her privilege. She was an ardent lover of our Lord in the Eucharistic presence and of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Amongst her favorite devotions, those to the holy Angels and to the Saints of the Order, were the most prominent. Her obedience, her fervent love of God and her affection • (59) (30 Historical Sketch. for her spiritual children, her firm reliance on Prov- idence and her fortitude in trials, were conspicuous traits of character, admired in her by all who made her acquaintance. A gentle and mild mother to her spirtual daughters, she was anxiously solicitous for their spiritual and temporal welfare, and they in return loved and respected her most sincerely and devotedly. An intrepid and heroic soul. Mother Teresa was tireless, active and unswerving in her chosen course. Implicitly trusting in God's assistance in all her undertakings, she left it to Him to crown them with success. Great was her solicitude for the development of the Community, and for its firm establishment in the work to which it was pledged. Her spirit of sacrifice was never daunted, though even the necessaries of life were often wanting. Prayer and love for those committed to her care, were resources that never failed her, and her acts of self-denial were a well-spring of continual bless- ings. She infused her spirit into her daughters. From her they learned to cherish their holy Rule, to love prayer, and to trust in God. As was remarked above, it was one of her first cares that the Sisters should have a Chapel, be it ever so poor, in which they might assemble for prayer, thereby to draw courage and strength from above to persevere in their arduous vocation. Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 61 Mother Teresa was gifted with a fine voice, and sang in the choir until her last illness. The new organ arrived shortly before her death, and she heard it played but once. After it had been placed in position, she requested Sister Antonia to play the hymn : \"Bin Bild ist mir in's Herz ge grab en\" — \"An linage graven in my Heart\" , which she took up and sang with soulful interpretation. This was the last time that the Sisters had the pleasure of listening to the voice of their dearly beloved Mother, in the Chapel. A few moments before she breathed her last, she requested the Sister in attendance, good Sister Mechtildis, to repair to the Chapel and pray fervently in honor of the Five Wounds, for a happy death. Mother Teresa died peacefully, and resigned to the will of God, September 27th, i860, sincerely mourned and sadly missed by her spiritual daughters. O Mother dear, in memory's sacred shrine, No love shall ever be compared to thine; Yet, to requite thy gentle, loving care, We offer not vain praise, 'but fervent prayer. The remains of the Sisters who had died before Mother Teresa, had been interred in the parish cemetery. They were now taken up and placed in a vault which had been constructed for the pur- 62 Historical Sketch. pose, on the Convent grounds. In the course of time a little Chapel was built over it. In this vault Mother Teresa's mortal remains were laid to rest. The deceased, up to this date are : Sisters Brigitta. Pacifica, Gabriela, Philomena, Agatha and Ven. Mother Teresa. At the time of Mother Teresa's death the Community numbered twenty-seven pro- fessed Sisters,, twelve novices and one postulant, and conducted six schools and one Academy. Later, when deaths in the Community increased, a cemetery was laid out in the Convent grounds. THE CONVENT BELL. Ring. O little Convent bell, Ring, and toll thy saddest knell!

IflBj Second. 1860—1870, CHAPTER I. Mother Antonia, Second Superior General. — A Pro- posed Removal Declined. — Purchase and Addition to the Building in St. Louis. FTER Mother Teresa's death. Sister Antonia was elected Superior General of the Com- munity, on the Feast of St. Michael. Trusting in God. she assumed the responsible duty of her new position. As related before, the Sisters had accepted December 18th, the charge of Holy Trinity School in St. Louis. The house that was to be their home was not finished on their arrival, and was so damp that they were obliged to keep up fire day and night. The number of pupils in the school was one hundred and thirty-five, not including the boys' class, which was taught by a male teacher. Dif- ficult as the beginning was, the school promised well. In the fall of i860, Father Rudolf visited the Sisters in St. Louis. During his sojourn in that city, he also called on Archbishop Kenrick. This distinguished pre- late urged him to transfer the Mother-house of his Community to St. Louis, and promised to aid him to the full extent of his ability if he did so. (65) 6G Historical Sketch. But the Ordinary of Vincennes, the Right Rev. M. de St. Palais, refused to entertain the proposal. Mother Antonia also was averse to the change, and Father Rudolf respectfully declined the Arch- bishop's offer, stating that, all things considered, he preferred to have the establishment remain in the place where it had so often and in so signal a manner experienced God's special help. The insti- tution had grown to its present importance, only at the cost of many a sacrifice of labor and means, and its removal would certainly occasion numerous difficulties. The lot on which the Sisters' house, in St. Louis, stands was donated to them by Rev. Father Doebbener. The school increased so rapidly, that five Sisters were employed at the end of i860, and they still continue to enjoy a merited success. The number of pupils has reached seven hundred, the music class comprises forty-five. Besides the well- graded classes in the parochial course of studies, the Sisters teach all the higher branches, scientific and commercial, with drawing, painting in oil and water colors, embroidery, plain and fancy needle- work, etc. In 1884, the Community built an addition to the Sisters' house, embracing two large class rooms, a community room, a parlor, three music rooms, a spacious dormitory and a fine Chapel. Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 67 Among the reminiscences of this mission, the Silver Jubilee, or twenty-fifth anniversary of the election of His Holiness Pope Pius IX. to the supreme pontificate, holds a foremost place. The day, June 16th, 1871, was observed with great solemnity in all the churches of St. Louis, and Holy Trinity's was not to be outdone by any. The Sisters, too, joined in the universal celebration. Their house was illuminated in the evening, its forty windows displaying each thirty-six lighted candles. On an easel in the vestibule was placed a magnificent picture of the Holy Father, which, with its corona of lights and flowers, presented a grand appearance. CHAPTER II. Extension of the Community's JJ^ork. — New Schools. — Death of Three Sisters. — A House at St. Vin- cent's, Prescott, Indiana. ZjpT^V ITH the extension of the Sisters' sphere of vlAi/ action, the cares and labors of Mother Antonia increased. Up to her election to the office of Superior General, she had been Directress of the Academy. Now she appointed Sister Dorothea to that office, but retained an active part in the instruction of the novices, and frequently visited the Sisters at their various missions, affectionately encouraging them in the conscientious fulfillment of their various duties. She often exhorted them to pray, not only to their own guardian angels, but also to those of the children under their care. She particularly recommended devotion to St. Ann as a powerful means of success in the difficult work of education. During the fall of 1861, the Sisters were entrusted with the care of the parish schools at Xew Vienna, Iowa; Carrolton, Kentucky; Newport, Kentucky; and St. Vincent's, Prescott, Indiana. At the latter place, the Community built a house for the Sisters. The school at Newport was 68 Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 69 accepted at the urgent request of Rev. Clement Scheve. In explanation of the solicitude which the Catholic Church bestows upon education, the fol- lowing remarks may not be amiss : The Catholic Church always has refused and always will refuse to concede, that education, divorced from Religion, fulfills the ideal of what education ought to be. Education divorced from Religion means, practically, education divorced from effective moral training. Hence the Catholic Church can never accept nor sanction any system of education which treats religion as a matter either of no importance or of secondary importance. Catholics are not opposed to universal educa- tion, nor to free education, nor to taxation for schools, nor to compulsory education, nor to methods and contrivances of whatever kind by which knowledge and enlightenment may be diffused through the masses of the people. In this direction, Catholics are willing and anxious to go as far as others. But they are opposed, necessarily and unalterably opposed, to any and all systems of education which exclude religious knowledge, or deny it to be the primal and most essential element of true human culture, and consequently insist that it should form the basis of instruction and disci- pline in the school, as in the family and Church. 70 Historical Sketch. As religious instruction cannot be introduced into the public schools of this country for obvious reasons, Catholics see no other way to train their children in the manner described above than to establish their own schools, despite the hardships entailed on them by the support of a double system of schools — the public and the parochial. The Sisters of the Oldenburg Community have achieved blessed results, which are in a great measure due to the effective training they receive. During the novitiate they are, first of all, schooled in the interior life of the soul, ever recollected and devoted to prayer and meditation. This is the well-spring of their admirable success. In the novitiate at Oldenburg, the Sisters are trained, moreover, in the duties of their vocation. Of the religious is demanded not an ordinary service of God, but rather a higher and more perfect one, as is evident from the nature and character of religious life. This science of perfection in the service of God is so sublime, and at the same time so directly opposed to human nature, that whoever is well grounded in it will cheerfully fulfill all other obligations. Hence the importance attached to it in all religious communities. As to her duties in the school room, the novice is trained in everything pertaining to them. She attends a regular course of instruction, embracing Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 71 all subjects that relate to pedagogy, and she soon learns this difficult task, because she had learned the more difficult one of self-denial. Thus we see that from the very foundation of the Community, the training of the subjects to be employed as teachers, has ever been regarded and treated as a matter of vital importance. In pro- portion to the development of the young Institution, the attention and care given to the regular Course of Study, were increased. Normals were inaug- urated at an early date, and zealously attended after the conclusion of each annual retreat. In connec- tion with these Normals, the examinations of teachers are held. They are conducted by the School Board, appointed by the Right Rev. Bishop, F. S. Chatard, the revered Prelate, so widely known for the interest he takes in educational subjects, who deigns, moreover, to take an active part in the exercises on these occasions. The careful grading of the teachers according to their progress in the various departments of study, serves as an incen- tive to renewed application. During the novitiate the novice is not under vows, but enjoys the full liberty of returning to the world at any time. Not until after pronounc- ing the perpetual vows, is she bound forever, on her part, to the religious state. As she is not coerced in any way to pronounce them, it will be 72 Historical Sketch. perceived that if she does so, she renounces personal liberty by her own free will. During- 1861, two good and able members of the Community died within a short time of each other, Sisters Veronica and Alphonsa. The former was stationed at St. Louis, Mo., when called to her reward, and is buried in Calvary Cemetery of that city; the latter died in the Mother-house, Olden- burg. The 26th of May, 1861, Sisters Pacinca and Otillia were admitted to Profession. ^W/^- \" - .: ' ~— :. OX u CHAPTER III. First Public Commencement at the Academy. — New School at Covington, Kentucky. — Father Rudolfs Silver Jubilee. — First Academy Building — Prop- erty in St. Louis Enlarged. ^JfftHE first public commencement exercises of the ar Oldenburg Academy were held towards the close of May, 1862. The examination in the Academy Course occupied the morning and after- noon sessions, concluding with the distribution of premiums. The beautiful dramas of \"Murillo's Mulatto/' \"Joan of Arc\" and the \"May Queen\" were well rendered and most favorably received. A most appreciative audience graced the occasion. Since then similar exercises have taken place annually. At the request of Rev. Ferdinand Kuehr, of Mother of God's Church, Covington, Kentucky, the Sisters this year took charge of the girls' school of that parish, beginning with one hundred and fifty pupils. June 27th, 1862, the following Sisters made their vows : Sisters Ursula, Genevieve, Regina, Catherine, Clara and Brigitta; Sisters Euphrosina (73) 74 Historical Sketch. and Mary Josepha in August. The latter died shortly after her profession, while stationed at Newport, Ky., and was there interred in the parish cemetery. August ioth, 1863. Rev. Father Francis Joseph Rudolf, the Founder and Spiritual Father of the Community, celebrated the Silver Jubilee of his ordination to the priesthood. The Sisters of Oldenburg, as well as the neighboring parishes of Enochsburg, Morris, St. Nicholas, St. Peters, St. Mary's of the Rock, and St. Philomena, observed this happy anniversary in the most solemn manner. Neither did Millhousen permit herself to be out- done by her sister missions, which were at one time under the firm and happy guidance of the zealous and saintly Rev. F. J. Rudolf. Clad in the beauti- ful and most costly sacerdotal vestments, which had been presented to him on this occasion, the venerable Jubilarian was conducted in procession from the Chapel to the parish church, which was tastefully decorated by the Sisters. They joined their most fervent thanksgivings with those which their Reverend Father and Pastor poured forth to God that day from a heart overflowing with gratitude. The festivities of the day concluded with a dramatic entertainment given by the pupils of the Academy. On this happy occasion, they surprised him with a line oil painting of himself, executed by the late and Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 75 much lamented artist, John Schmidt, Covington, Kentucky. \"O, twenty-five years full of labor and care, Yet happy and beautiful, gracious and fair ! Now wreathed in the Jubilee's silvery crown, With blessings much greater than wealth and renown ! \"The obstacles conquered, the victory won, And yet still the noontide of life scarcely gone. God bless thee, and grant thee a ripe age's gold, With joys and with triumphs thy life to enfold!\" In 1863, the number of pupils at the Oldenburg Academy had increased to such an extent, that a plan long before conceived had to be executed — that of erecting a separate Academy building. Work was begun at once and vigorously prose- cuted; and in October the building was ready for occupancy. The Rev. Founder well knew that even this large building would, in a short time, prove too small, but the funds were exhausted, and the needs of other houses counselled wise economy. The increase of pupils at Holy Trinity's School, St. Louis, made an addition to the grounds impera- tive, and an adjoining lot was purchased for the sum of six hundred dollars. The Community was now able to hire men for the farm work, therefore an additional tract of land was bought at Oldenburg, comprising forty acres. 76 Historical Sketch. Its cultivation resulted in sufficient produce for the Community. The years of this decade are almost cloudless. True, the cloud of war then hung over the land, and even the retired Community of Oldenburg heard rumors of dangers and anxieties, but these did not interfere with the regular routine of life in Convent or school. Frequently, visitors called at the rural solitude to assist at Convent celebrations or Academy exercises, and carried away with them impressions which resulted in spreading\" the Com- munity's reputation. The professions of this year were : March 25th, Sisters Julia, Mathilda and Bonaventura; June 27th, Sister Delphina; August 25th, Sister Crescentia; September 8th, Sister Barbara; December 30th, Sisters Blanche, Lucia and Amata. The novice, Sister Scholastica, died July 26th, same year. CHAPTER IV. Neiv Trials. — Acceptance of New Schools. — Increase of Pupils at St. Mary's School, Indianapolis. — Addition of an Academic Department. £{RHE placid course of events was, however, des- lr tined to be interrupted in 1864. Knowing well that God visits with trials and sufferings more fre- quently those whom He loves best, the Sisters bowed to the visitations of God, accepting them not only in the spirit of resignation, but also as an evidence of His growing love and favor. In February of this year, the dread scourge of small-pox appeared among the pupils. Three of them, and three Sisters were attacked in the most violent form. Mother Antonia took upon herself the care of the stricken, ministering to them with more than maternal tenderness, and all recovered. As a precaution, the Academy pupils, all but ten who preferred to remain, had been dismissed and classes were discontinued until April. The commencement exercises took place as usual at the end of June, and the Community's success in the Academic Department was, indeed, (\"> 78 Historical Sketch. a source of gratification., but in no wise resulted to the detriment of the parochial schools. On the contrary, applications were constantly made to the Sisters for the acceptance of new schools. About this time, the Right Rev. A. Carrell, Bishop of Covington, Kentucky., urged the Sisters to accept the school at Ashland, Kentucky, but insurmount- able obstacles hindered the progress of the new mission., and they were obliged to withdraw to the mutual regret of the Bishop and the Sisters. In their own State of Indiana, however, the Sisters took charge of a number of schools. In the Fall, 1864, the Rev. S. Sigrist, of Indian- apolis, desired Sisters for the girls' school of his parish, St. Mary's. Two were sent, and opened the classes with sixty-three pupils, which number in a short time increased to one hundred and twenty- five, and a decade later had attained that of four hundred and sixty. Since then, however, a number of new parishes with schools were organized in the city, and a slight decrease in the attendance at St. Mary's school is noticeable. In the beginning of 1883, tne Sisters at Indianap- olis opened an academic class, and the number of its pupils averages between thirty and forty. The commercial branches, drawing, painting, needle- work, etc., are successfully taught, and the depart- ment of music alone, numbers about fifty pupils. Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 79 During the same year, 1864, the Sisters responded to an invitation extended to them by Rev. J. B. Seepe, and took charge of St. Andrew's school at Richmond, Indiana. Two Sisters opened the school there with one hundred and sixty pupils. At present seven teachers are employed, and they have besides a flourishing music class of thirty- seven pupils. The following Sisters made their profession in the course of this year : Sisters Hildegard and Emerentina, May 3rd, 1864; Sisters Isabella, Dom- inica, Seraphine, Eleonora, Sophia, Philomena, Augustina and Coletta, August 25th; Sisters Teresa and Florentine, December 20th, at St. Louis. This year was a sad one for the Community. Six of the most promising members were called to their reward — they are : Sisters Rose, Lucy, Brigitta, Regina, Francisca and Delphina. Up to this period, the Sisters had faithfully continued in the holy exercise of perpetual adora- tion by night and by day, regardless of the inclem- ency of the season. The Right Rev. Bishop, alarmed by the increased number of deaths, prohibited, to the great distress of the Sisters, nightly vigils before the Blessed Sacrament. Adoration was kept up during the day with una- bated fervor. CHAPTER V. Extension of the Academy Building. — St. Ann's Oratory. — More Schools Accepted. — A House Built in Indianapolis. HE reputation of the Oldenburg Convent as a seat of learning, refinement and piety was now established, and with it, confidence in its stability,, which an ever increasing number of pupils secured. The foundation of its religious spirit had been laid on the basis of Christian virtues, possessed in no mean degree by those heroic souls who stand as beacon lights in the haze that now envelops its early morning. In the trials of life, which came to them as they come to all, [Mother Antonia had recourse to her usual help in difficulties, prayer, long and fervent. In 1865. the dreaded disease of small-pox again broke out among the pupils. Three of them and two Sisters were attacked, but this time the malady appeared in a milder form. But few of the pupils left at their parents' request, and the classes were continued. The number of pupils had reached one (80) St. Mary's Academy, Indianapolis, Ind. Donor: Miss M. Miner. Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 81 hundred and seventeen, and the Academy building now proved inadequate for the accommodation of the pupils. In consequence an addition was built, corresponding in size and form with the old build- ing. It was completed in November. One of its rooms was arranged as an Oratory for the pupils. Two of these, both bearing the name of Elizabeth, claimed the privilege of furnishing it. They are still living, and are ladies of distinction. The Oratory wras dedicated to St. Ann, the model of Christian teachers. Sweet happy spot, where holy peace forever Like a pure spirit broods with folded wings, Where virtue's radiant, ever-blooming flowers Are watched by Religion's crystal springs; Thou seemest in thy calm and quiet beauty From earth's wild strifes and sins and sorrows free; Thou reignest throned amid thy broad green woodlands A peaceful island in an emerald sea. And to my heart thou wilt be linked forever. Apart from all the gay world's gilded pleasures, Brave, patient souls within thy walls abide, Walking in toil and prayer and self-denial The lowly pathway of the Crucified ; And many a young heart nurtured by their kindness, Will think of them and thee when distant far. And look back to thy altar-lamp's pale shining, As once the shepherds looked to Bethlehem's star. 82 Historical Sketch. Some of youth's brightest, happiest days have glided In thy still shades, like streams of sunshine, by; And to the heart thou wilt be linked forever By memories that cannot fade or die. The silent prayers, hopes and consolations, The precious lessons, and the words of cheer In hours of trial, when all around seemed dark, Have sanctified this spot and made it dear. In the fall of 1865, the Sisters took charge of the school at Lanesville, Indiana, at the request of Rev. A. Munschina. At Indianapolis, the increasing number of pupils necessitated the building of a large house for their and the Sisters' accommodation. The congregation contributed one thousand dollars towards its erection. In the course of the year, Sisters Melania, Veronica, Balbina, Victoria, Felicitas, Perpetua, Alphonsa, Helena and Clementina, took their vows August 12th; Sisters Beatrice and Anastasia, August 25th. Sister Augustina died at Newport, Ky., October 22nd; Sister Maria died as novice in July, at the Mother-house. CHAPTER VI. Father Rudolfs Death. \" 'Tis hard to break the tender cord, \"When love has bound the heart; 'Tis hard to speak the farewell word, 'O Christian soul, depart!' \" |HE year 1866 was a fatal one for the Com- munity. Its noble Founder, good Father Ru- dolf, had been in ill health since the end of 1865. He was suffering from a severe cold, and his strength was visibly failing. He continued, however, to discharge his duties faithfully, regardless of cir- cumstances. His energetic will power struggled against the frequent fainting spells, induced by extreme debility, but to no avail. \"It is better that I prepare for death,\" he remarked when the Sisters insisted on calling a physician; \"for death there is no remedy.\" Father Rudolf preached his last sermon on Good Friday, 1866. The following days he spent almost entirely at the foot of the altar. Notwith- standing his great weakness, he repaired to one of his neighboring missions, Morris, for divine service on Easter morning. After this he returned to Oldenburg for solemn High Mass, at the close of • (83) 8-4 Historical Sketch. which he blessed two statues, one of St. Ann, the other, of St. Elizabeth. On the Sunday after Easter he celebrated the early Mass in the parish church. After communion he was heard to pro- nounce thrice the name of Jesus, and, fainting, he sank to the floor. Recovering from the attack, he was extremely weak. Nevertheless, summoning all his courage and strength, he again said Mass in the Convent Chapel, on Wednesday, after which he was taken to Cincinnati, to be placed in the care of the best medical attendants. But all efforts were in vain, his condition continued to grow worse. He returned to Oldenburg to settle his temporalities and prepare for death. Having received the sacraments repeatedly, and for the last time from the hands of his colleague and bosom friend, the late Rev. Wein- zoepfeln, he departed this life on the 29th of May, 1866, aged fifty-three years, one month and six days, in the twenty-second year of his uninterrupted labors at Oldenburg. The Very Rev. A. Scheideler, another warm friend of the deceased, assisted him to the very last. The dying Pastor, even in this supreme moment, was still solicitous for the spiritual needs of his parishioners. At his request, Father Weinzoepfeln had answered a sick call, and after some time, with his dying voice, inquired : \"Has the poor woman received attention?\" He then slept away in the Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 85 Lord, while his assistant, Rev. W. Doyle, was offer- ing for him the Holy Sacrifice. Thus ended a life of restless activity for the promotion of God's glory and the salvation of souls. His burning zeal received its reward, and his mem- ory will remain forever in benediction with his grateful flock and spiritual daughters, for whom he did so much, and to whom he left his earthly posses- sions. Bishop de St. Palais, who visited him during his illness, assisted at the funeral, as did seventeen priests, some coming from a great distance. Father Rudolf's remains were laid to rest in the parish church, which he built, and which through his untir- ing efforts, had received the distinction and privilege of consecration. His tomb is under the sanctuary, next to the altar of the Blessed Virgin. ' A marble tablet marks the spot. After the funeral, at which Rev. S. Sigrist, of Indianapolis, preached the sermon, the Right Rev. Bishop remained for a few days, to assist the sorely tried Community with his counsel and advice in their deep grief at their irrep- arable loss. One consolation they had, mournful as it was, their revered and sainted Founder had always celebrated the feast of Corpus Christi with the great- est religious splendor; and it was on that feast, that his corpse lay in state in their Chapel, before being borne to the parish church for interment. In Father Rudolf, the Sisters lost a generous 86 Historical Sketch. friend and true father, but gained, no doubt, a powerful intercessor at the throne of God. Yet, not a day passes on which the Sisters do not remember him in their prayers, that he may Rest in Peace ! REST IN PEACE. Thy peace, O Lord, be with the noble dead. The while his stainless record's page we read ! But sad the halls where he no more shall tread, The drooping hearts that miss the generous deed. Yet, give not way to grieving overmuch, Bereaved Community; for such as he Bring God's great kingdom near enough to touch The living proof of immortality. CHAPTER VII. Annual Retreat. — St. Aloysius School, Covington, Kentucky. — St. John's School, in the Same City. —Rev. Nicholas Wachtev, O. F. M., Father Rudolf's Successor. N July, 1866, the Sisters returned from their various missions to the mother-house. The annual retreat was conducted by Rev. Servatius Altmicks, O. F. M., of Teutopolis, Illinois. As the annual retreat will often be referred to in these pages, we deem it opportune to explain it here, once for all. But few people in the world understand what a spiritual retreat means. It means to retire, for a time, from the usual avocations and engagements of life into holy solitude, to treat with God on the affairs of eternity, on the world which is to come, on the \"one thing necessary.\" Is it asking too much to lay aside, for a few days, the daily cares to settle the one affair for which alone we are in the world? Religious ha\\re, indeed, renounced the world, as far as the one around them is concerned, but there is another world which they must also renounce. It is the world within, in the mind, heart and soul. A • (87) 88 Historical Sketch. noble effort of the mind, without any religious aid, such as Faith supplies, may suffice when it is a ques- tion of abandoning parents, friends and companions, whom we loved ; but when it comes to dividing our own being as if with a sword — of abandoning for- ever, not the perishing things around us, but the living, active, imperious will within the heart, — who has power, and resolve and fortitude for an achieve- ment like this? Where find chains strong enough to bind down the world and passionate emotions to the dominion of the spiritual? So it is even in the religious state. After years of labor, after sub- duing the will by fast and labor and vigil, even then it may be seduced by errors and fancies most disastrous to its peace. Hence the Apostle says : \"The natural man receiveth not the things which are the spirit of God.\" (I. Cor., II., n.) Nor is virtue to be depended upon, for nature rebels against it. Just at the moment when we imagine ourselves to be very humble, we may be suddenly overthrown by pride. Even in the most sacred places an idol may be set up in the heart, instead of Christ, the Lord. The retreat is intended for self-examination on these and kindred points, and the religious, having learned to know herself, will remove the obstacles from the path of perfection. She will take measures and look about for helps, to aid her in the future Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 89 fulfillment of duty. Thus the time of retreat is a season of spiritual renovation, and one of the most powerful means of obtaining- that greatest of all graces, perseverance. Hence the importance attached to retreats in religious communities. Having learned the difficult task of self-denial, the religious finds every other duty comparatively easy. At the opening of the school term, 1866, the Sisters were placed in charge of the school of St. Aloysius parish, recently founded in Covington, Kentucky. They began the classes with one hundred and sixty children. At present the number of pupils amounts to seven hundred and forty and a flourish- ing Kindergarten. Eleven Sisters are now engaged in teaching. A class of thirty pupils receives instruc- tion in music; others are taught plain and fancy sewing, embroidery, etc. The school of St. John's parish, in the same city, was also placed in the Sisters' charge about the same time. After Father Rudolf's death, the Bishop of Vin- cennes, Right Rev. M. de St. Palais, invited the Franciscan Fathers of the Cincinnati Province to take charge of the parish and Sisters' Community, at Oldenburg. On August 7th, two Fathers arrived — Nicholas YVachter and Jacob Menchen, O. F. M. The former was appointed superior and pastor, and became as such, Father Rudolf's sue- 90 Historical Sketch. cessor. After fulfilling the duties of his office with blessed results for nearly three years, he died at Cincinnati, for he had gone there for medical treatment, February 20th, 1869. He was succeeded by Father Louis Haverbeck. O. F. M., at present Provincial of the Franciscan Province of St. John the Baptist, who was spiritual Director of the Community for many years. Under his wise guidance, the Sisters continued to extend their work, and devoted themselves to it with zeal and perseverance. There was but one death in this year, Sister Gertrude, March 15th, at whose funeral the Rev. Founder officiated for the last time. A few days later, seven aspirants received the holy habit, the last ones received into the Sisterhood by the sainted Rev. Rector. Amongst the number was Sister Olivia, the present Mother General, to whom he had administered Holy Baptism and first Communion. CHAPTER VIII. The Chapel. — Schools at Lawrenceburg and Scottsz'ille, Indiana. — A Sisters' Dwelling in Brookville, Indi- ana.— A Lot Bought in Richmond, Indiana. -&■ f^HE Chapel, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Alary, under the mystery of her Immaculate Conception, was the favorite spot of the whole Com- munity. There Sisters and pupils assembled in times of distress and rejoicing ; there they assisted at Mass every morning; there the Sisters made their daily meditation and recited the divine office; there, each year, their retreat was made. It was the Com- munity's sanctuary, and cherished as such. Hence, Mother Antonia was intent on embellish- ing it as much as possible, and every year saw some new article of furniture, or vestments, decorations, etc., added. Xow a new silver sanctuary lamp and new stations of the cross were placed in it. The former was donated, the latter cost three hundred and seventy-five dollars. A Communion rail, too, was purchased at a cost of ninety dollars. During this year the Sisters were called to con- duct the parish school at Lawrenceburg, Indiana. In March, two Sisters went to St. John's, Scottsville, mil 92 Historical Sketch. Indiana, to make arrangements for the opening of a school in September. In Brookville, Indiana, the Sisters had hitherto lived in a dilapidated and cheerless old building; now Mother Antonia bought a spacious and com- fortable house for them. July 27th, 1867, the Right Rev. Bishop himself received the vows of fourteen Sisters. This good Prelate and Father loved to honor his spiritual daughters on these occasions, and to enhance the ceremonies by the additional charm of his lordly presence. The exterior circumstances attending the conse- cration of a soul to God may be more or less brilli- ant; the sacrifice is in the interior renouncement of the will in a holy self-denial, in the abandonment of hopes lortg cherished, in the rejection, in fine, of whatever fascinates the heart. This is the immola- tion, and a most marvelous achievement of grace, which triumphs over nature. This sacrifice is so astonishing, that worldlings do not believe in its sincerity, and invent all kinds of excuses and motives to degrade it. Insinuations of disappointment, pride, self-interest, and other base motives, are constantly alleged, but this attempt of the unbelievers to dis- honor it, only tends to establish the eminent virtue which these holy vows commemorate. The sacrifice is as honorable to the religion which inspires it, as Sisters' Residence, Brookville, Ind. St. Vincent's School, Prescott, Ind. St. Anthony's School, Evansville, Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg, Ind. 03 it is to those whose submission it consecrates. The religion which recommends such sacrifices can alone give to humanity its highest degree of dignity and force. It is the triumph reserved for the Gospel and the Divine Spirit of Truth. In September, the Sisters who had remained in the mother-house during vacation, returned to their missions. The Sisters' dwelling in Richmond, Indiana, was also far from serviceable. Mother Antonia bought the lot on which it stood, with the intention of build- ing as soon as the Community's means should allow. At the mother-house, the laundry was provided with the latest improvements, in order to lessen the labor of the Sisters, for whose health and general welfare Mother Antonia was at all times most solicitous. • Sisters Emerentina and Catherine died during this year. CHAPTER IX. Schools in West Covington, Kentucky, and New Albany, Indiana. — Ground Added to the Convent Property.— A House in N-ew Albany. f\"\\HE annual return of the Sisters to the mother- house is, indeed, a blessing, which they enjoy with grateful sentiments. It fosters mutual charity, recalls memories of trials and joys borne together, and stimulates them to give each other a good exam- ple. Children returning home after a long absence, cannot be gladder than the Sisters are at the prospect of meeting again their dear Mother and their loved co-religious. As usual, one week of the vacation was devoted to the annual retreat. At its close the Right Rev. Bishop, who had returned from Rome, came to receive the vows of a number of Sisters. In September, the Sisters opened a school in West Covington, Kentucky, and in St. Mary's parish, New Albany, Indiana, where their old friend, Rev. C. Doebbener, was pastor now. There, the number of pupils was two hundred and eighty in the beginning, whilst now it comprises six classes, with (94) ■ ■gift it sc j^ff \\i .. 1 1 Ft 1 ;B ,t HMBiilM 1 | ML * ••■• - 4^ ~~~~7^^ jJ^fS?—3^ St. Mary's Academy, New Albany, Ixd.
