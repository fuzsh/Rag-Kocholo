        "text": "CANTON − An Akron-based charter school operator has purchased the former St. Mary's of the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in southeast Canton.\n\nSummit Academy Management has paid the Catholic Diocese of Youngstown $525,000 for the 2.9 acre property, which includes the former church building, rectory, convent and school located at 1602-1634 Market Ave. S.\n\nMonsignor John Zuraw, vicar general of the diocese, this week confirmed the purchase which closed on May 21.\n\nSt. Mary's officially closed in November after 123 years.\n\nDenise Henry, director of communications for Summit Academy Management, said Summit Academy's Canton Elementary, which serves students in grades kindergarten through 8, has occupied parts of the church grounds since 2003.\n\n\"Summit Academy Community School for Alternative Learners (Canton Elementary) appreciates the opportunity to continue serving students, including many with special education needs, at this location,\" she said.\n\nSt. Mary's alums are still friends: The Girls of St. Mary's School in Canton: A 70-year sisterhood and friendship\n\nHenry said future plans may involve the relocation of Summit Academy Secondary School to the new property, adding that projected enrollments in Canton for the coming school year is 135 students.\n\nIn 2022, Summit Academy Management entered into a five-year lease agreement to house two of its schools in Malone University's DeVol Hall, but that deal has been scuttled.\n\n\"Summit Academy’s architect learned of unexpected structural requirements needed to convert DeVol Hall into a school building,\" Henry said. \"The additional construction would have added eight to 10 months to the project and would have been significantly over budget.\"\n\nAt one time, St. Mary's rectory was rented by a nonprofit to house homeless teen girls, and a portion of the school was leased by Head Start.\n\nSt. Mary's, which was established in 1899, merged with St. Benedict Church in 2011 under the diocese's Parish Reconfiguration Plan. Last July, the combined parish merged with St. Anthony/All Saints Church to form the St. Francis of Assisi parish.\n\nFollowing the final Mass at St. Mary's on Nov. 7, the church's sacred items and artifacts were removed by diocesan representatives.\n\nCatholic parish closes: Parishioners bid farewell to St. Mary's in Canton\n\nThis marks the second local diocesan property that has been acquired by a charter school. Wright Preparatory Academy, part of ACCEL public charter schools, occupies the former St. Paul Catholic Church and school at 1500 Superior Ave. NE.\n\nSummit Academy Management owns and operates 20 schools throughout Ohio, with a 21st to be added in July when Columbus Elementary and Middle Schools combine, Henry said.\n\nReach Charita at 330-580-8313 or charita.goshay@cantonrep.com.\n\nOn Twitter: @cgoshayREP"
