Collins spoke at an all-school convocation, where he discussed his incredible story and how reconciliation played a role in his life, including bringing him closer to a man he wrongfully put behind bars, who is the co-author of this book. Collins also spoke about what it was like to write the book with Jameel and an editor. Students appreciated that he was open but not awkward and that he spoke to them as teenagers. They also were amazed at the level and kind of forgiveness the authors showed each other."
