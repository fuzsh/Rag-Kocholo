Oldenburg Academy of the Immaculate Conception will be the outstanding co-educational Catholic college preparatory high school in southeastern Indiana, where students of diverse backgrounds are embraced and celebrated.

We will build and support an active campus ministry program, continue to develop a challenging academic curriculum, sustain our premier fine arts program, and offer a wide selection of athletic and other co-curricular activities. Technology will be incorporated throughout the curriculum and campus.

We will provide a positive working environment that employs a well-qualified and highly committed faculty and staff.

We will maintain a strong partnership with our sponsors, the Sisters of St. Francis, as well as community members and alumni. We will promote good stewardship of our resources to ensure the financial stability of the Academy.

The OA Alma Mater

ICA Faculty, 1929

Come, all ye friends of our loved Alma Mater

Come blend with joy your voices here today.

Broadcasting far and near the praise the glory

of this our school, the dear old O.A.

Refrain:

All Hail! All Hail to our loved Alma Mater,

whose standard safe will guide us in life's way:

Virtue, Honor, Education, Love of God and Love of Nation

is our heritage all hail to dear O.A.

â€˜Tis here we spent blessed youth's happy springtime,

at Oldenburg with loved ones fond and true

Here once again let us with true devotion,

pledge our heart's love and loyalty to you!
