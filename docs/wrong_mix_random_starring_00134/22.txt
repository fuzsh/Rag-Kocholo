We begin tonight with the threat of significant disruptions at the border heading into the busy summer season. Canadian airports and land crossings could see long lines as border workers have voted in favour of a strike mandate. Unions representing roughly 9,000 members say they could be on the picket lines next month. Ctv's quebec bureau chief genevieve beauchmin reports from near l'ecole border crossing. >> Reporter: canadians plans for a summer trip abroad could hit a roadblock. Canada border service agency workers handed their unions a strike mandate. A move supported by 96% of members who voted. >> Absolutely I can see people being frustrated, inconvenienced, upset. Annoyed. All of those things. It's not something that we want either. >> Reporter: cbsa employees are posted at land crossings, airports, marine ports, but also work as intelligence officers investigators. They want work conditions in line with those of other law enforcement agencies like the rcmp. >> We're looking for greater parity regarding salaries, protections around excessive discipline, protections around contracting out and equitable retirement benefits. >> Reporter: they also want telework options for those who can work at home when the public sector has threatened a summer of discontent over the government mandating more days in the office. But where the union sees an impasse, the employer, the federal government says a strike is unnecessary. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau: we recognize the hard work that they do every day keeping canadians safe at our borders. But we also know that the best labour agreements happen at the bargaining table. And that's exactly where the ministers are focused. >> Reporter: and the government says 90% of union members are designated as essential. They must provide services in the event of a strike. Still, the unions say their job action could lead motorists idling at international crossings for hours, like in 2021 when they brought in work to rule measures. It could also slow the flow of goods across these borders and spend any time here at the border crossing and you can see how trucks are flowing back and forth here. The unions say the window to avert disruptions is closing. Strike measures could come by mid-june.

In 2018 he barreled through a stop sign and into the path of a bus carrying the humbolt broncos junior hockey team. 16 people were killed, 13 injured. Ctv's stacey hein on what's next. >> Reporter: jaskirat singh sidhu is set to be deported to india following a decision from an immigration and refugee board hearing. >> So at a hearing like this, a really limited discussion. They have to determine if the person is a citizen or not. And if they've been convicted of a serious crime. >> Reporter: sidhu became a permanent resident a month before the humbolt broncos bus crash that left 16 dead and 13 others. He was a rookie truck driver who drove through a stop sign and into the path of the junior hockey bus in april of 2018. While some family members did not want to comment on sidhu's deportation, the father of logan boulet says, quote, bernadine and I are thankful for the decision today as we continue to believe that Mr. Sidhu should be deported from canada. We are prepared to remain

diligent in this belief even as Mr. Sidhu may launch further appeals. Crash victim ryan straschnitzki says he wishes sidhu happiness. >> Obviously you want the best for someone and best for humans and a human and you know there's no -- there's no negative emotions towards him and his family. >> Reporter: in 2019, sidhu pleaded guilty to dangerous driving offences and was sentenced to eight years in prison. He got full parole last year. Since sidhu was a permanent resident and not yet a canadian citizen, the canada border service agency agency recommended deportation. >> He has a family, a wife and child who are canadian citizens would probably cannot go back to india. So it would be extremely destructive to his life. >> Reporter: his lawyer says he won't be taken into custody immediately and can reapply for permanent resident status on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. He says that process could take a few months or a few years. Stacey hein, ctv news, saskatoon. >> Heather: canadians struggling under the soaring cost of groceries will be eagerly awaiting the results of a probe by canada's competition bureau. It's launched an investigation into the parent companies of grocery chains loblaws and sobeys for alleged anti-competitive conduct. Ctv's paul hollingsworth explains. >> Reporter: sobeys and loblaws already facing intense scrutiny over rising food prices find themselves on the receiving end of an investigation launched by the competition bureau of canada. >> Any time you're being investigated by the competition bureau, something serious is happening because they don't get involved all that often and I think it's a fairly novel case. >> Reporter: both grocery giants are accused of implementing restrictive covenants on their properties to limit competition in the retail grocery sector. A lack of competition is directly linked to the high price of food. >> When you try to control geography as a retailer, and you're suppressing competition, access, access to food, affordable food becomes an issue. >> Reporter: sobeys owner empire called the investigation unlawful. >> One of the allegations sobeys are making against this process is that it presents the competition bureau in a biased way. >> Reporter: millions of canadian shoppers are struggling with skyrocketing grocery prices. >> Terrible. Like I said, our pensions don't match up to what we're paying out I'll tell you that much. >> It doesn't surprise me, no, but some competition would be great. >> Reporter: dalhousie university law professor wayne McKAY says the competition bureau will be challenged to tune out public emotion. >> They have to come to it independently. They're not the overly influenced by political or public opinion. >> Reporter: he does think the competition bureau has enough to pursue the case going forward which means, he says, it's possible this case could lead to more competition and more affordable groceries. Paul hollingsworth, ctv news, halifax. >> Heather: the university of toronto has issued a trespass notice to pro-palestinian protesters. >> It's a notice of trespass, okay? >> Heather: special constables issued the order to people at the encampment on the school's downtown campus set up for more than three weeks. Demonstrators have until monday morning to clear out. If they do not leave, the university is vowing to pursue other legal steps. Both sides have agreed to meet again on sunday.

>>> A major ruling today from the U.N. international court on the war in gaza. It ordered israel to halt its the military operation in rafah. It adds more pressure on israel even though the court itself has no means to enforce the order. Ctv's jeremie charron is following the story. >> Reporter: inside this courtroom in the netherlands today, a landmark emergency ruling in a case brought forward by south africa accusing israel of genocide. >> Israel has not sufficiently addressed and dispelled the concerns raised by its military offensive in rafah. >> Reporter: a strict order from the world court. >> Israel must immediately halt its military offensive and any other action which may inflict on the palestinian group in gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction. >> Reporter: the president of the court ordered israel to open the rafah border crossing to allow humanitarian aid in, calling the situation in gaza catastrophic. >> Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau: canada's position has been clear for many, many weeks now. We need an immediate ceasefire. Hamas needs to lay down its arms, release all hostages, but there also must be no more military operations in rafah. >> Reporter: the court also called for the release of all remaining hostages and while its order is legally binding, the icj lacks the power to enforce it. >> The international court of justice doesn't have its own army, doesn't have it's own police. It depends upon the security council to implement its orders. >> Reporter: this is the third time the court has issued orders for israel to pull back and address the humanitarian suffering in gaza, but israel has been accused of ignoring their orders in the past. >> Israeli spokesmen have already announced that essentially israel will not comply with the order, that they will continue their operation. >> Reporter: israel has repeatedly dismissed accusations of genocide, insisting it has the right to defend itself from hamas. South africa's wider case here accuses israel of state-led genocide against palestinians, the ruling on that could take years, but the icj has denied israel's request to throw the case out. Heather? >> Heather: ctv's jeremie charron in ottawa.

>>> Ceasefire negotiations for the war in ukraine may be back on the table, but only one that rehe current battlefield lines. [Speaking in Alternate Language] russian president vladomir putin told reporters peace talks must resume but based on common sense. In ukraine, president volodmyr zelenskyy visited a printing house that was destroyed by a russian missile attack that killed at least seven people. >>> A group with links to the terror group isis may be behind a fatal shooting at a restaurant near toronto three years ago. The jury heard in court today that the victim was likely targeted because he wanted to expose his alleged killer. Ctv's jon woodward is tracking the story. >> Reporter: it was a bloody scene in may of 2021 in chicken land. Five people shot, 25-year-old naim akl died in an attack that shocked the city of mississauga. >> I just don't understand. >> Senseless. Really is, senseless. >> Reporter: at the time, police released this surveillance video of the gunman before and after the shooting. Part of the investigation that led to the arrest of three men. And led the crown attorney to tell a jury in the first degree murder trial of the brampton courthouse that akl had gone to work in abbasi's warehouse. The crown attorney said you will hear evidence that akl became aware the group pledged allegiance to isis. They weren't just buying and selling products. They had pledged allegiance to isis and money was being used to finance that organization sent back home to further that cause. He was planning to go to the authorities and betray the others. It's our position that the others came up with a plan to prevent that from happening, a plan to kill naim akl and his family. The plan was put into action with nav entering the restaurant, pulling a handgun and shooting seven times in less than 18 seconds. Witnesses told the court they saw a slender man rush from the restaurant and hop into the trunk of a waiting honda accord. It sped off. Inside, akl's mother had heard several pops. She was shot in the army and rushed in to see several other family members being shot including a son. She said I looked at him. He was looking at me. I could see the blood everywhere on the ground. I could do nothing. If she she said she called 9-1-1 and asked any driver in the gas station for help. Police pulled footage from 70 dash cams and surveillance cameras enroute to follow the route back to abbasi's business, a major break in the case. Jon woodward, ctv news. >> Heather: a ceremony is set to begin just hours from now in france where officials are preparing to return the remains of an unknown soldier home to newfoundland. The soldier represents the hundreds who never made it back. Ctv's garrett barry is in beaumont-hamel and introduces us to a group with a very special role in tomorrow's service. >> Reporter: they've been practicing all week. The pressure is on. Tomorrow's event is once in a lifetime. >> Big honour. Such a weight on your shoulders to perform to your highest standard really. It's to go out there, make sure you look the part, act the part. You're bringing home one of our own. >> Reporter: for the newfoundlanders in this group it's a very special job. Bringing a countryman home for the first time in a hundred years. >> Something as big as this is hard to put into words. Like to be a newfoundlander and as far as I can think back, everyone is a newfoundlander from where my family is from. >> Reporter: they'll walk alongside an unknown soldier as he heads back home to newfoundland. >> Everyone's going to feel very solemn. I think feelings are going to be a bit high. I'm proud to be there. >> Reporter: many put their hand up to walk alongside the casket, so it be picked is a real honour. >> There's a lot of history around it obviously. Being in the military, our family in the military. So I want to take it personal and it's a great honour. >> Just feel proud really. Feel proud. Represent canada. Represent newfoundland. You're here and it's a once in a lifetime opportunity. >> Reporter: that same group will accompany the unknown soldier on his final trip to be entombed at the national war memorial in downtown st. John's. It will happen july 1st, newfoundland and labrador's memorial day. Heather? >> Heather: garrett, a few people in the story are wearing a special flower that you also have on. Tell us a little more about that? >> These blue flowers are forget me notes, similar to the poppies worn on remembrance day. It was actually exactly a hundred years ago that the veterans association of newfoundland adopted these blue flowers as their official symbol. They sold them, part of the project to pay for war memorials. To this day, newfoundlanders and labradorians will wear the blue flowers to remember the sacrifice of newfoundlanders and labradorians in wars fought overseas. Heather? >> Heather: a very moving tribute.
