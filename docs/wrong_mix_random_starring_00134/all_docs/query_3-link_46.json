        "text": "Peixin Hou is currently serving as the Chief Architect of Open Software and Systems in the Central Software Institute, Huawei. He has been working in the software industry for over 20 years and has experience in operating systems, mobile software, media processing, and cloud computing.\n\nPeixin started his open source journey in 2000 and is now an active strategist and evangelist in the field. He is involved in defining various key strategies on open source for Huawei and leads the company’s FOSS development in areas such as Linux and containers. He also serves as a board or steering committee member in several open source projects, such as Cloud Native Computing Foundation and Core Infrastructure Initiative. Peixin has also represented Huawei on the board of Linaro.\n\nPeixin received his Ph.D. from the University of Surrey, UK in electronic and electrical engineering.\n\nGabriele is an open source leader and technologist at heart, having spent more than 10 years building thriving communities and delivering business value through open source. He thrives in working with open source communities to drive disruptive innovation, whether it’s for an early stage tech startup, a Fortune 500 firm, or a non profit organization.\n\nGabriele brings a wealth of expertise in executive and technical leadership, ranging from FinTech to enterprise collaboration, and from developer platforms to SaaS ARR business models. Previously Director of Product Management at Alfresco, Gabriele has now built the Symphony Software Foundation from the ground up, with the vision of creating a trusted arena for Wall Street to accelerate digital transformation, engaging in a new model of open source FinTech innovation. Gabriele is a PMC Member for the Apache Software Foundation and an advisor for Bankex.com. Based in San Francisco but originally from Italy, he’s a proud SSC Napoli supporter, a reggae music connoisseur and a South Park groupie.\n\nDaniela Barbosa serves as General Manager Blockchain, Healthcare and Identity at the Linux Foundation and as Executive Director of Hyperledger Foundation with overall strategic and operational responsibility for staff, programs, expansion and execution of Hyperledger’s mission. Daniela has more than 20 years of enterprise technology experience, including serving for four years as Hyperledger Foundation’s Vice President of Worldwide Alliances with responsibility for the member community as well as broader industry and business community outreach and overall network growth. She started her career at Dow Jones where she worked with the top global brands across various sectors, including finance, consumer and energy, to architect and deliver enterprise systems, ontologies and semantic web solutions. In the early 2000s, Daniela became involved in the early web 2.0 community helping to advance the concept of digital identity and data portability as the pathway for people to reuse their data across interoperable applications.\n\nLinus Torvalds was born on December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. He enrolled at the University of Helsinki in 1988, graduating with a master’s degree in computer science. His M.Sc. thesis was titled “Linux: A Portable Operating System” and was the genesis for what would become the most important collaborative software project in history.\n\nIn August 1991, Linus announced that he was developing the Linux kernel, proclaiming, “it won’t be big and professional.” In spite of his humble proclamation, Linux has become the world’s most pervasive operating system. Today the Linux kernel forms the basis of the Linux operating system and has permeated almost every industry and form factor.\n\nIn 2005, citing a lack of free and open source version control tools that met his needs for performance and scale, Linus created Git in only 10 days. Today Git is widely used in software development and for other version-control tasks such as configuration management.\n\nIn 2000, Linus was listed by Time magazine as #17 in the Time 100: Most Important People of the Century. Again, in 2004, Time named him one of the Most Influential People in the world. He was honored in 2008 with the Millennium Technology Prize by the Technology Academy Finland, “in recognition of his creation of a new open source operating system for computers leading to the widely used Linux kernel.” He is also the recipient of the 2014 IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award. A true tech titan, he was admitted to the Computer History Museum Hall of Fellows, joining the ranks of the tech elite including Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper, Tim Berners-Lee, Gordon Moore, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Steve Wozniak, and others.\n\nLinus remains the ultimate authority on the new code incorporated into the standard Linux kernel."
