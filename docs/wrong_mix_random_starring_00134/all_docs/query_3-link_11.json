Jack of all trades, a master of none.\n\nAlyssa is a Senior Manager, Community and Culture at Juxtapose, where she focuses on cultivating strong relationships and impactful engagements with the firmâs internal team and external network. She works closely with Juxtapose leadership to bring team-building and flagship events to life and drive the \"one firm\" culture forward.

Last but not least, I'm inspired when I work on challenging projects with a supportive team!\n\nWhat do you find most compelling about Juxtapose's model?\n\nI'm so intrigued by Juxtapose's incubator to investment model. I found the firm's strategy of developing, green-lighting, and CEO matching in-house to be particularly rare and exciting.\n\nWhat's the biggest learning experience youâve had?\n\nI made a massive career jump from co-working space operations to an HQ role as an event manager at the very start of COVID (March 2020). The role was a dream opportunity - I'd be running event programs for our Enterprise sales team globally. As soon as I started, the world shut down and in-person events became impossible. Our team had a choice to stay stagnant or pivot and offer unique ideas for virtual experiences while we navigated the unknown. We chose the latter. I look back on that time as an incredibly challenging but pivotal chapter in my career.\n\nWhatâs a cause thatâs important to you?\n\nAnimal rescue and rehabilitation! I'm on my 2nd foster dog and passionate about giving rescues a chance at a new life and loving home.\n\nDriven by curiosity and creating a sense of community in everything we do. Jack of all trades, a master of none.\n\nAlyssa is a Senior Manager, Community and Culture at Juxtapose, where she focuses on cultivating strong relationships and impactful engagements with the firmâs internal team and external network. She works closely with Juxtapose leadership to bring team-building and flagship events to life and drive the \"one firm\" culture forward. Before joining Juxtapose, Alyssa built her career at hyper-growth companies like WeWork and Figma, where she managed co-working spaces, led community teams in sales and hospitality efforts, and executed a diverse range of marketing programs from field events to marquee user conferences. Alyssa graduated summa cum laude from San Diego State University with an Integrated Marketing and Communications degree.\n\nWhat inspires you to do your best work?\n\nI'm inspired by seeing firsthand how event and culture initiatives impacts people and contributes to their loyalty and trust to a brand or organization. I find purpose in making thoughtful connections within an ecosystem and seeing companies or team members expanding through it. Last but not least, I'm inspired when I work on challenging projects with a supportive team!\n\nWhat do you find most compelling about Juxtapose's model?\n\nI'm so intrigued by Juxtapose's incubator to investment model. I found the firm's strategy of developing, green-lighting, and CEO matching in-house to be particularly rare and exciting.\n\nWhat's the biggest learning experience youâve had?\n\nI made a massive career jump from co-working space operations to an HQ role as an event manager at the very start of COVID (March 2020). The role was a dream opportunity - I'd be running event programs for our Enterprise sales team globally. As soon as I started, the world shut down and in-person events became impossible. Our team had a choice to stay stagnant or pivot and offer unique ideas for virtual experiences while we navigated the unknown. We chose the latter. I look back on that time as an incredibly challenging but pivotal chapter in my career.\n\nWhatâs a cause thatâs important to you?\n\nAnimal rescue and rehabilitation! I'm on my 2nd foster dog and passionate about giving rescues a chance at a new life and loving home.\n\nEnergized by thinking about business model innovations and where/how value gets created in dynamic ecosystems.\n\nAndy is Partner on the Concept Development team at Juxtapose, where he helps to lead company-creation efforts at the research phase, and supports our ventures from inception through their full lifecycle. Andy works closely with the user research & design, and talent teams, as well as with the firm's portfolio companies on capital markets efforts. Prior to Juxtapose, Andy founded a direct primary care business and was previously a private equity and hedge fund investor, first at Hellman & Friedman and later helping to start Thorntree Capital, a consumer- and internet-focused hedge fund where he led consumer and retail and international investing. Andy began his career at Bain & Company and is a graduate of Harvard College.\n\nWhat advice would you give to budding startup founders?\n\nDon't become seduced by your own narrative, focus on reducing the number of bets you are taking that you don't control (e.g., consumer behavior change), and bet on an economic model that has a lot of margin of safety early on (high LTV customers, low prevailing CAC, fragmented and unsophisticated competition).\n\nWhich industry or category do you enjoy working in most (and why)?\n\nI most enjoy working in healthcare, primarily because of the triple bottom lines. The best business models are pure net positives for the world - they create profit, but they also reduce costs, improve outcomes, increase access, and create better patient experiences. There are few industries where you can \"disrupt\" and leave just about everyone better off, including those you have \"disrupted\"!\n\nWhat's a framework you've found particularly insightful?\n\nI find prioritizing \"system-level value creation\" above all else to be an incredibly helpful north star - it is easy to get caught up in the business model to be built and the competitive dynamics too early on, but focusing first on \"how much value can I create?\" and \"for whom?\" clarifies the questions to ask and the work to be done, and ultimately allow you to confidently proceed to the rest of the work. If you can create a lot of new value for an important constituency, there is usually a compelling business to be built.\n\nWhatâs your favorite way to spend a Sunday?\n\nI like to go for a really long walk with my family in the country in the morning, eat lunch at a diner, come home and read a book on the couch, and cook a dinner that takes a long time to finish, where you can smell it all through the house.\n\nEnergized by thinking about business model innovations and where/how value gets created in dynamic ecosystems.\n\nAndy is Partner on the Concept Development team at Juxtapose, where he helps to lead company-creation efforts at the research phase, and supports our ventures from inception through their full lifecycle.

One of the most memorable examples of this was the entire organization (from intern to CEO) jumping in to close out all customer service tickets the evening before the winter holidays.

Itâs something I feel lucky to have been so close to.\n\nWhatâs one thing people donât know about you?\n\nI was born in Texas. My allegiance to sports teams sits squarely with Seattle teams, though.\n\nFavorite app?\n\nYouTube.

The impact this had on the organization was profound, and Iâm excited to work with people who embrace the same sense of teamwork.\n\nWhat's an example of a company that inspires you (and why)?\n\nMy dad has run a small business most of my life. I think small businesses help us most tangibly understand some of the core pillars of building a great business (at any scale), as thereâs nowhere to hide and customer feedback loops are super tight. Itâs about doing right by the end customer, aligning behind a team culture and mission, and ultimately showing up everyday and giving it 100%. Itâs something I feel lucky to have been so close to.\n\nWhatâs one thing people donât know about you?\n\nI was born in Texas. My allegiance to sports teams sits squarely with Seattle teams, though.\n\nFavorite app?\n\nYouTube. The more niche the content, the better.\n\nDev is a Special Advisor to Juxtapose, where he advises the Managing Partners and team on a variety of high priority internal and external initiatives.

Dev is a graduate of the University of Western Ontario.\n\nWhat's been your favorite moment working at Juxtapose?\n\nFor me, the best moments are those in-between ones, that happen during real in-person interaction. When you bring together a diverse group of talented, multi-hyphenate individuals, and let the natural gravity and tension of working together naturally allow for small moments of discovery, spontaneity, and insight.\n\nWhy do you believe in Juxtapose's success in the long-term?\n\nThere's an organic flexibility and creativity to how the firm operates that is different from other investment firms or creative organizations I've encountered. The juxtaposition of process and spontaneity, materiality with fluidity; these enable Juxtapose to bring the best of investment rigor with entrepreneurial creativity.\n\nWhatâs one thing people donât know about you?\n\nI have always loved books, and even more so the libraries that house the knowledge stores in those books! I am the creator of Sorted Library, an organization dedicated to promoting and preserving private libraries, and am currently building a 50,000-book collection, which will be housed at a permanent site that was recently acquired in Norfolk, Connecticut.\n\nWhat would you like to be remembered for?\n\nSomebody who you could come to with anything, for anything.\n\nDev is a Special Advisor to Juxtapose, where he advises the Managing Partners and team on a variety of high priority internal and external initiatives.

Prototype, test, iterate, and prioritize what really matters to them. Think about accessibility & all possible constituencies that will directly & indirectly interact with your product. Does it help or harm? Does it solve a real need? What impact will your product have in 1-5-10 years from today?\n\nWhat's a framework you've found particularly insightful?\n\nI like the â5 whysâ. Itâs a technique that's used to identify the root cause of a problem by asking âwhyâ questions five times. The idea is that each answer leads to the next question, helping to uncover progressively deeper insights.\n\nWhat brings you joy?\n\nI really enjoy teaching.
