        "text": "Welcome!\n\nThank you for your interest in the Corewell Health Helen DeVos Childrenâs Hospital/Michigan State University Pediatric Cardiology Fellowship. Located in one of the fastest growing cities in the Midwest, we are nationally ranked in multiple pediatric sub-specialties by U.S. News and World Report and offer a complete educational and clinical experience in our state-of-the-art, free-standing, tertiary care, childrenâs hospital.\n\nLike the city of Grand Rapids, our childrenâs hospital and pediatric cardiology fellowship program are hidden gems. The hospital has 241 beds, which includes a dedicated cardiac ICU, a separate medical ICU, and a large (>100 beds) level 4 NICU with a dedicated small baby unit. Located in West Michigan, we have the largest health system in the state of Michigan and our catchment area extends beyond our state borders. Within our childrenâs hospital, we have over fifty pediatric subspecialities, three residency programs and eight fellowships.\n\nOur pediatric congenital heart center is a high-volume program that cares for our patients from fetal life through their adult years. All pediatric cardiology subspecialties are well represented, including heart failure/transplant, cardio-genetics, and cardiac rehabilitation.\n\nOur fellowship program is based upon a robust and vigorous clinical experience with a large patient population, a committed faculty with diverse backgrounds, over a year of dedicated research time with extensive division and MSU support, and a dynamic educational curriculum.\n\nIn addition, our overall philosophy is what makes us truly unique. We recognize our fellows as colleagues from their first day of fellowship. Prioritizing learning and experience, we involve our fellows in every aspect of patient care and the evolution of the fellowship program. Using individualized graduated autonomy, we maximize the educational experience for every fellow. We are purposefully a small program, taking two fellows per year, so that we may provide each fellow exactly what they need to thrive. In addition, we do not have advanced fellowships, as we have chosen to not dilute the experience of our fellows.\n\nWe seek fellows that are committed to their learning, who wish to further the field of pediatric cardiology, and who are dedicated to providing excellent patient care. I wish you the best in the application process and I look forward to meeting you in the future.\n\nIf I can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.\n\nWarmest Regards,\n\nJulie Sommerfield-Ronek, MD\n\nProgram Director, Pediatric Cardiology Fellowship\n\nCorewell Health/Michigan State University/Helen DeVos Childrenâs Hospital\n\nClinical Assistant Professor, Pediatrics and Human Development\n\nMichigan State University College of Human Medicine\n\nFellows participate in a dynamic curriculum which includes weekly EKG rounds, cath case review, echo lectures, and surgical conference. Every other week, the fellows attend core curriculum lectures, EP lectures, and alternating board review and journal club. There is a monthly M+M conference as well as a monthly pathology conference.\n\nProgram aims\n\nTo provide a comprehensive training experience in all aspects of the care of children with heart disease and patients of all ages with congenital heart disease\n\nTo develop excellent academic pediatric and congenital cardiology specialists\n\nTo provide comprehensive training and increased experience in the performance and interpretation of critical diagnostic tests as well as current therapeutic strategies used in cardiovascular disease\n\nInpatient service and consultation\n\nUnder the supervision of faculty and staff, the fellow is responsible for the clinical management of hospitalized patients. This includes service on the general cardiology floor, as well as consultation services in the NICU, PICU, and throughout the hospital. The services include patients with newly diagnosed congenital heart disease, acquired heart disease, pre- and post-operative patients as well as those with arrhythmias and other heart conditions. The fellow has an intrinsic role in the education and supervision of pediatric residents.\n\nOutpatient clinic\n\nFellows acquire knowledge of general cardiology through a continuity outpatient clinic. Weekly half-day clinics afford the fellow an opportunity to get to know the patient and to serve as their primary cardiologist. These clinic encounters are staffed and supervised by faculty members, specifically chosen by prior trainees for their great mentorship and clinical acumen.\n\nEchocardiography\n\nDuring the first month in the program, fellows complete a comprehensive echo âboot campâ which includes extensive hands-on encounters. After this immersion experience, new fellows are prepared to perform and interpret echocardiograms early in training. During the first year, three and half months are spent in the Echo Lab with an additional three months over the next two years. Second-year fellows spend time performing transesophageal echocardiograms. Third year fellows focus on fetal echocardiogram, cardiac CT and MRI.\n\nFellows are guided in the acquisition and interpretation of images as well as generating a comprehensive report of the findings. Supervision is provided by faculty and experienced pediatric sonographers.\n\nCardiac catheterization and interventional cardiology\n\nThe fellows begin the experience with interventional cardiology in their first year, with two blocks in the cath lab. There is an additional rotation in the second year. Optional additional time can be spent in the cath lab during the third year. The fellows begin by obtaining access and gaining basic knowledge of cardiac catheterization. As expertise is gained, the fellows are given more autonomy in performing cardiac catheterizations, angiograms and interventions. The fellows present the hemodynamic data and angiograms at the weekly Congenital Heart Center conference.\n\nCardiac intensive care unit\n\nThe CICU experience includes management of medical and surgical patients under the supervision of cardiac intensivist and cardiologist. They work closely with our three cardiovascular surgeons in both the pre- and post-operative setting. Fellows complete four months in the CICU, one of which occurs during the second half of the first year.\n\nElectrophysiology\n\nDuring the three electrophysiology rotations, fellows interpret electrocardiograms, Holter and patch monitors with subsequent review with one of the faculty electrophysiologists. The fellows also participate in management of inpatients with arrhythmic disorders, perform and interpret intracardiac electrophysiologic studies and pacemaker implantations and ablations. The fellows learn exercise physiology through exercise and metabolic studies, both non-invasive and invasive. Additional time is spent in the electrophysiology clinic to learn the management of common arrhythmias in the outpatient setting.\n\nResearch\n\nThe fellows complete 14 blocks of research time, starting in the first year. Fellows are mentored by faculty members involved in research in all branches of pediatric cardiology. Additionally, they are expected to participate in a dedicated clinical research curriculum. Fellows present their research study findings at national and international scientific meetings, for which CME funds are provided.\n\nHeart failure and transplant\n\nFellows work with both pediatric and adult heart failure and heart transplant physicians. One month of dedicated time occurs in the second or third year with additional training available as an elective. The fellows also work closely with our heart failure specialists on complex patients admitted to the cardiac ICU.\n\nAdult congenital heart disease\n\nThe Adult Congenital Heart Disease Program is accredited by the Adult Congenital Heart Association as a Comprehensive Care Center. Fellows have one block in their second year and optional additional rotations as electives. The fellows also gain experience by taking care of adult congenital patients while on call. They are supported by board certified ACHD faculty.\n\nThank you for your interest in the Corewell Health Helen DeVos Childrenâs Hospital/Michigan State University Pediatric Cardiology Fellowship.
