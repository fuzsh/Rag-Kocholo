        "text": "Canadian politician and football player (born 1980)\n\nIbrahim \"Obby\" Khan (born 8 October 1980) is a Canadian politician, entrepreneur and former professional Canadian football centre who played for nine seasons in the Canadian Football League with the Ottawa Renegades, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, and Calgary Stampeders.\n\nIn March 2022, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba to represent the riding of Fort Whyte. He was elected in a by-election, following the resignation of former Premier Brian Pallister, narrowly beating Willard Reaves, the Liberal candidate and another former Winnipeg Blue Bomber.[1]\n\nIbrahim \"Obby\" Khan was born on 8 October 1980 in Ottawa, Ontario, to a Muslim-Canadian family of Pakistani heritage. For high-school, Khan attended Sir Wilfrid Laurier Secondary School and played football and rugby. He also played minor football for the Gloucester Dukes.\n\nIn university, Khan played CIS football with the Simon Fraser Clan, winning the J. P. Metras Trophy as the top lineman in Canadian university football in 2003. The following year, Khan was one of three Canadians to participate in the 2004 East-West Shrine Game, an all-star game for graduating college players, mainly from the United States.\n\nKhan was selected with the second overall pick of the 2004 CFL Draft by the Ottawa Renegades and signed with the team on 19 May 2004.[2] He dressed for the Renegades during the first two games of the 2004 CFL season but did not see action. In Game 3 versus Edmonton, he saw the first live action of his CFL career. In Game 7 versus Calgary, he got the first start of his pro career at right guard. In Game 8 at BC, he started for the second time in as many weeks against the Lions. In Game 9 versus Hamilton he backed-up Mike Sutherland at right guard. He also had a special teams' tackle. In Game 10 versus Edmonton, he backed-up Alexandre Gauthier at left tackle and had a special teams' tackle. In Game 11 versus Montreal, Khan began the game as a back-up and filled in well for centre George Hudson when he went down with a back injury. He started Game 12 versus BC he started as centre against the Lions.\n\nKhan started five of 15 games for the Ottawa Renegades in the 2005 CFL season, sitting out three games due to injury. He was one of the 'Gades most versatile offensive linemen, seeing playing time at guard, centre and tackle.\n\nIn the 2006 CFL season, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers acquired Khan as their first selection in the Ottawa Dispersal Draft. He was the only member of the Blue Bombers’ offensive line to start all 18 regular season games as well as the football club's East Semifinal contest with the Toronto Argonauts. Khan had never played centre at the pro level until being shifted there during training camp. Khan's solid play helped running back Charles Roberts rush for a league-leading 1,609 yards on 303 carries. His contributions did not go unnoticed. Khan was named the co-winner of the CJOB Offensive Player of the Game Award in Week 8 versus the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. He and the rest of the Bombers' offensive line turned in another performance in the East Semifinal. The Big Blue rushed for 200 yards, including 179 by Roberts, in a losing cause. Khan was recognized in the CFL's post-season awards as the Bombers' nominee as Outstanding Offensive Lineman.\n\nOn 25 April 2012, Khan announced his retirement after eight seasons in the Canadian Football League.[3]\n\nOn 14 August 2012, the Calgary Stampeders announced that Khan had come out of retirement and signed with the team. He was released by the Stampeders on 11 March 2013.[4]\n\nKhan owns and operates Shawarma Khan, a Winnipeg-based halal shawarma restaurant.[5] Shawarma Khan now has four locations within Winnipeg: Exchange District, Pembina Highway, Graham Avenue, and a concession stand at Investors Group Field under the name \"Shawarma Khan In a Snap\".\n\nKhan also co-created and co-owns Green Carrot Juice Company, a fresh cold-press juice business in three Winnipeg locations: Osborne Village, Airport, and Tuxedo.\n\nIn November 2020, Khan and business partner Ali Esmail launched GoodLocal.ca, an online marketplace for local Winnipeg businesses. GoodLocal, which co-owner Esmail wanted to name LoveLocalMarket, started out in the basement of Shawarma Khan (Graham Ave) and had 100 vendors. Good Local later increased their vendor count to 388, and generated $850,000 in sales.[6][7] On 26 November 2021, the company opened its first physical location in Winnipeg's Exchange District.[7]\n\nIn January 2022, Khan sought the nomination of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba's candidate in 2022 by-election in Fort Whyte.[8] On 12 February 2022, Khan won the nomination vote for the Fort Whyte by-election that was scheduled to take place on March 22 of that year.[9][10]\n\nOn March 4, 2022, opposition parties questioned a $500,000 grant that was awarded to Khan's business Good Local as part of a $1.5-million provincial program aimed to promote shop local efforts.[11] Of the $1.5 million, $500,000 was given to Khan's business, $409,000 was spent on various programs through the chamber of commerce, while $536,000 remained unspent.[6] Chuck Davidson, president of the Manitoba Chamber of Commerce, credited the grant for creating nine full-time jobs and eighteen part-time jobs at GoodLocal.[12] Liberal leader Dougald Lamont questioned whether the process for awarding this grant was fair; he also cited other business that did not receive financial aid from the government.[13] The PC Party responded to the accusations of favouritism by listing other financial programs that were implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.[13]\n\nOn 22 March 2022, Khan defeated Liberal candidate Willard Reaves, in an unusually close race for what had previously been a safe seat for the Progressive Conservatives, having previously been represented by two PC leaders (Pallister and, before him, Hugh McFadyen). This result was the first time a Progressive Conservative candidate had failed to receive an outright majority of votes in the riding, and the result was reported as a \"wakeup call\" for the PCs by the Winnipeg Sun.[1][14]\n\nKhan's election made him the first Muslim elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. Khan stated that the result was \"a huge honour\" noting that he was \"one of the first East Indians to play in the CFL, now the first Canadian Muslim to be elected [to the Manitoba Legislative Assembly].\"[15]\n\nKhan was re-elected in the 2023 provincial election. On October 24, 2023, he was appointed as the Shadow Minister for Finance and as the Shadow Minister for the Manitoba Public Service.\n\n2023 Manitoba general election: Fort Whyte Party Candidate Votes % Expenditures Progressive Conservative Obby Khan 5,442 47.87 −9.32 $45,760.93 Liberal Willard Reaves 4,213 37.06 +19.44 $19,578.06 New Democratic Trudy Schroeder 1,714 15.08 −2.81 $0.00 Total valid votes/Expense limit 11,369 99.61 – $66,506.00 Total rejected and declined ballots 45 0.39 – Turnout 11,414 64.37 +4.02 Eligible voters 17,732 Progressive Conservative hold Swing −14.38\n\nManitoba provincial by-election, March 22, 2022: Fort Whyte\n\nResignation of Brian Pallister Party Candidate Votes % Expenditures Progressive Conservative Obby Khan 3,050 42.51 -14.68 Liberal Willard Reaves 2,853 39.77 +22.53 New Democratic Trudy Schroeder 1,112 15.50 -2.38 Independent Patrick Allard 101 1.41 — Green Nicolas Geddert 55 0.77 -6.00 Total valid votes 7,174 Total rejected ballots 15 0.21 -0.33 Turnout 7,189 42.62 -14.57 Eligible voters 15,907 — -0.29 Progressive Conservative hold Swing -18.61 Source: Elections Manitoba[19][20]"
