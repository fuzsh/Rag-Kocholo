        "text": "Summary:\n\nDirector, Professor\n\nAssociate Member, Department of Biology\n\nGenetic and molecular analysis of visual system development in Drosophila melanogaster.\n\nResearch Interests:\n\nHydra, Regeneration, Drosophila, Developmental Biology, Cell Biology, Genetics\n\nThe ability to generate genetic variants has greatly aided the study of biochemical and developmental pathways. Given the success of this approach it is not surprising that genetics is being used to address a wide range of neurobiological questions including the generation of behaviour. My laboratory uses the larval visual system of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model system to investigate the mechanisms underlying the development and function of the nervous system. To that end, mutations or molecular tools are used to impair specific cell types and/or cellular interactions. Mutations found to disrupt the development of the larval visual system or the larval response to light can be used to identify molecules involved in these processes. Thus, my research program can be divided in two parts namely the genetic analysis of the larval response to light and the molecular genetic analysis of genes required for the development of the larval visual system. To address these questions a variety of techniques are used such as mutant analysis, molecular and cell biology.\n\nSummary:\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nAssociate Member, Biology\n\nDr. Kim Dej completed her undergraduate at the University of Toronto (St. George) in the Molecular Genetics program with a Major in Zoology and a Minor in Botany. During this time she developed an interest in genetics, chromosome structure, and transposable elements. She completed her PhD at Johns Hopkins University with Allan Spradling (Carnegie Institute of Washington) and went on to be a postdoctoral fellow at MIT with Terry Orr-Weaver (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research). She joined the McMaster community in 2004 where her teaching has focused on genetics, cell biology, research methods, undergraduate laboratory experiences, in addition to community engagement and science communication. Dr. Dej has taught in the Life Sciences program since 2009 and she has been a part of the evolution of the program. She has won several teaching awards including the McMaster President’s Award for Outstanding Contributions to Teaching and Learning, a McMaster Student Union Award (Science), an OCUFA Teaching Award, and a YWCA Woman of Distinction Award for Education and Mentorship.\n\nResearch Interests:\n\nnematode biodiversity; authentic lab research and the undergraduate experience; peer-mentorship and undergraduate student engagement; digital storytelling and student learning\n\nDr. Dej’s lab research with undergraduate students has focused on the cell cycle in Drosophila melanogaster and biodiversity in nematode species. In 2015 Dr. Dej became a MacPherson Teaching Fellow, which has allowed her to identify and expand independent undergraduate research opportunities on campus. This has been possible by focusing on training (the interactive Nematode Diversity Project eBook lab manual), space (The Applied Learning Lab for Undergraduate Research Excellence, or ALLURE), and funding (small grants that encourage peer-learning and collaboration in undergraduate thesis research). This is part of her broader interest in providing authentic research opportunities embedded in courses for undergraduates even in large courses and assessing the role these experiences play in engaging students. These opportunities are illustrated by development of the Amylase Gene Project (with Alastair Tracey, BIOL1A03), Personal Genome Testing (with Mihaela Georgescu, MOLBIOL2C03), and the development of the Living Systems Lab in the School of Interdisicplinary Science (various student, staff, and faculty collaborators, LIFESCI2L03 & LIFESCI3L03). In 2016 to 2018, Dr. Dej was a MIIETL Leadership in Teaching and Learning (LTL) Fellow. She has used this as an opportunity to partner with students in curriculum development, including assessing the impact on student engagement and learning of cohort-building and scaffolded peer-mentorship within interdisciplinary streams in the Life Sciences program. In partnership with the McMaster Children and Youth University (MCYU) and MacPherson student partners, Dr. Dej is leading the development of ebooks for elementary and middle-school students. Within this project, research is focused upon measuring the impact of the interactive digital storytelling on the learning in addition to the impact of community-engaged learning on university students.\n\nCourses:\n\nCMTYENGA2A03: Foundations in Community Engagement\n\nLIFESCI4N03 (Visualizing Science)\n\nLIFESCI2G03: Genes, Genomes, and Society\n\nDiscovery Program (through Arts & Science program)\n\nSummary:\n\nDr. Carolyn Eyles was the former Director of the Integrated Science Program and is a Professor in the School of Interdisciplinary Science and the School of Geography & Earth Sciences. She holds a B.Sc. in Environmental Sciences from the University of East Anglia, a postgraduate certificate of Education from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, and an M.Sc. and Ph.D. in geology from the University of Toronto. Her research interests lie in the fields of glacial sedimentology and environmental geology, and she has worked extensively in Alaska, Australia, Brazil, Iceland, Norway, Great Britain and Canada. She has over 75 publications in peer-reviewed journals and books and has co-authored two first year geoscience textbooks. Dr. Eyles is a practicing Professional Geoscientist of Ontario (P.Geo), and is a member of the Geological Society of America, the American Geophysical Union, and the American Geological Institute. Dr. Eyles is a 3M National Teaching Fellow and has won numerous teaching awards including an OCUFA Teaching Award, an Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance Teaching Award, and the McMaster President’s Award for Excellence in Instruction. Her current teaching duties include Earth Science components of interdisciplinary courses in the Integrated Science program and senior/graduate level courses in glacial sedimentology. She chaired the committee that designed and developed the interdisciplinary Honours B.Sc. Integrated Science Program and served as the program Director from 2009-2015.\n\nResearch Interests:\n\nGlacial sedimentology, urban and environmental geology, paleoenvironmental analysis\n\nSummary:\n\nProgram Coordinator, Honours Integrated Science\n\nDr. Chad Harvey is the instructor for the Life Science component of iSci 1A24. His educational background in the fields of invasion biology, zoology, and entomology certainly come through in his teaching style. As such, Dr. Harvey introduces a new “organism of the day” at the beginning of each lecture.\n\nResearch Interests:\n\nFoodweb ecology, conservation biology, biostatistics, pedagogical engagement, interdisciplinary curriculum design, research-based education\n\nFoodweb and community ecology of non-indigenous (invasive) species. My field and laboratory research attempts to determine the direct and indirect interactions and mechanisms through which non-indigenous species impact resident foodwebs and ecosystems. I employ a combination of empirical and theoretical tools to understand these interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales. My pedagogical research seeks to increase student engagement in the entire teaching and learning process. I pursue this through identifying the importance of interdisciplinarity in teaching. Why do I need to study math if I am interested in biology? Additionally, I seek to discover techniques and strategies that increase student involvement in the classroom, enhancing student activity in the classroom and their general desire to learn and apply learning concepts. My field and laboratory research attempts to determine the direct and indirect interactions and mechanisms through which non-indigenous species impact resident foodwebs and ecosystems. I employ a combination of empirical and theoretical tools to understand these interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales. My primary research interests deal with how populations of non-indigenous (invasive) species interact with resident species over multiple spatial and temporal scales. The main thrust of my research highlights the importance of indirect interactions as a mechanism by which non-indigenous species impact these systems. My research to date has combined these ideas with quantitative theory and empirical studies in a number of managed and natural systems. I use a number of statistical approaches, including multivariate and spatial statistics, to address both applied and fundamental questions. The ultimate goal of my research is to ascertain the key interactions by which non-indigenous species impact native ecosystems and how we may predict the outcome of these impacts for conservation purposes.\n\nCourses:\n\nISCI 1A24\n\nISCI 2A18\n\nISCI 3A12\n\nISCI 4A12\n\nISCI/ARTSCI 3IE1 – KENTUCKY CAVES\n\nISCI/ARTSCI 3IE1 – GRANT WRITING\n\nISCI 3IS3\n\nSummary:\n\nAssociate Director (Curriculum & Pedagogy),\n\nJoint Appointment, Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour\n\nDr. Ayesha Khan has a Ph.D. in behavioural neuroendocrinology during which she investigated the influence of in utero, dietary, and social factors on time to sexual maturity in developing females.
