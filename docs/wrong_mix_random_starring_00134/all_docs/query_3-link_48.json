She is also looking for narrative nonfiction from smart, passionate writers who offer a fresh or niche perspective. In all areas she’s especially looking to fill her list with books that celebrate LGBTQ+ voices and BIPOC cultures and perspectives. More details can be found on her Manuscript Wish List (MSWL) page. Among the authors she has worked with are Sahaj Kaur Kohli, Juno Dawson, Shubnum Khan, Asha Thanki, Tana French, Chanel Miller, Tracy Chevalier, Timothy Egan, Colin Dickey, Charlotte Alter, Jessica Goudeau, David Baldacci, Sara Blaedel, Flea, Abbi Jacobson, and more.\n\nAllie Merola acquires fiction, nonfiction, and poetry for Viking Penguin and Penguin Poets.

Across genres, she is drawn to writing with a sense of humor and projects that interrogate our political, social, and moral convictions. Since joining Viking Penguin in 2018, she has worked with authors including Zahra Hankir, Rebecca Makkai, Phillip B. Williams, Rita Bullwinkel, Bianca Bosker, Flynn Berry, Terrance Hayes, Sarah Thankam Mathews, Alice Notley, Rebecca Solnit, Rio Cortez, Sunjeev Sahota, and Alejandro Zambra."
