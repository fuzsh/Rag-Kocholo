The move marks a promotion for Rees, who previously served as the company’s senior vice president of finance and principal accounting officer. Rees, who joined Atossa in 2017, brings nearly three decades of extensive experience in accounting, business management, and finance to her new role. A statement from the company called the new CFO instrumental in the company’s financial strategy and operational oversight. “Heather’s partnership and contributions have been invaluable and key to the success of our company to date, which is why she was the obvious choice to become our new Chief Financial Officer,” said Steven Quay, CEO of Atossa. “This appointment is testament to her exemplary performance over the past seven years and the deep industry and functional knowledge she brings to the role.” More at #Proactive #ProactiveInvestors #Biotech #Biopharmaceutcials #Oncology #BreastCancer http://ow.ly/9oui105z4wh"
